When they posted the recipe, they changed it to say to use the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (I think in some places that is all that is available) but I don't actually use those (I don't like adobo sauce!) I use the plain dried/smoked peppers  Careful not to use too many, a couple should do it, as they reconstitute in the sauce, and one small pepper can add a good bit of spice.  I hope you all like it; it is a real hit with my family.

Used 2 chipotle peppers and 1 tbsp of adobe sauce for the perfect degree of spiciness without overwhelming the other flavors within the lasagna; sauteed fresh spinach, chopped very fine and added to the cream cheese; 2 zucchini's and sauteed mushrooms coarsely chopped and mixed into the sauce using petite diced tomatoes flavored with basil, oregano and garlic. Mixing the zucchini and mushroom into the sauce helped address the issue of the lasagna not having enough layers as many reviewers noted.  Quite possibly one of the best lasagna's I have ever had.  And I believe that says it all....

My friend and I were making some meals to freeze.  We made this recipe and we both couldn't wait, so we had it for dinner that night.  Both of our families loved it.  It was a little time consuming, but definitely worth it.  We used ground turkey and turkey sausage and it was delicious!  I can't wait to make it again.  Also, the recipe does make a lot.  We made 2 lasagnas out of the recipe without doubling it.   Thank you!

This was so yummy.  I am not a big Chipotle fan so I omitted this ingredient and it was still some of the best lasagne I've ever made.

Wonderful!  Whole family loved it - even my one year old!  Took forever to make - prep time was more like 2 hours if you simmer and brown everything right.  Definitely worth it, though.  I will absolutely make again! Thanks!

Beyond excellent!  So much flavor!  Like someone else said, I'll never boil lasagna noodles again --that was the bonus.  For our tastes, used 1 T. of the chipolte chili in adobo sauce (about 2 chilis), 3/4 t. sea salt, 3/4 t. black pepper and it was just perfect.  Also, used the diced tomatoes as others suggested. Had to use dried spices; 1 t. basil and 2 t. oregano.  Used 2 containers of mushrooms, Neufchatel in place of cream cheese and a slightly bigger bag of spinach.  Didn't have Asiago so doubled the amount of Parmesan.  I don't think it made a bit of difference using what I had on hand.  This was absolutely to die for!  This made one 9 x 13" and one 9x9".

Wow!  What a great lasagna, full of flavor!  This takes a little extra time but you will not be disappointed with it.  Do use a dish deeper than a standard 9x13 because it makes a pan FULL of lasagna.  If you do not have a deeper one use a cookie sheet covered in tinfoil on the next rack down under your 9x13.  I followed the direcitons exactly except I sliced my zucchini into rounds instead of lengthwise.  When I read the reviews for this the recipe submitter actually uses dried chipotle chilis but I could not find these at my local shopping places so I did use the chipotles in adobo.  I used 2 but next time will add 3 or 4.  They add a nice spiciness to the lasagna.  I served this with Lime Iced Tea and Harvest Salad from this site and store-bought garlic bread.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing Lori :)

I am picky about my lasagnas... but this was AWESOME!  I was a little skeptical of the cream cheese, but it was absolutely perfect!!  My husband doesn't like leftovers, but he can't wait to take this in his lunch to work tomorrow!  I'll definitely make this again!

Super yummy!  My husband couldn't get enough of it.  I did make a few changes and added about 5 chipotles and used a low carb lasagna instead.  It came out wonderfully!

I like to put just a little bit more spice in it to give it a kick. Try tabasco sauce or green tabasco for just a little bit more heat.

Delicious recipe! As other have commented, it is impossible to get three layers stacked in a standard depth dish of this size. I also found there was liquid at the bottom of the pan when the dish was finished, in the future I will drain some liquids out before layering. I'm not sure why the aluminum foil was included, I made two pans and the one without foil turned out better. Your call on that though.

Holy Cow!!!! This is awesome!! I don't care much for lasagna myslef but Hubs requested some for dinner and I must say I've been swayed! I made according to the recipe but added an extra chipotle pepper or three. It was hot. But we like hot. Wow! Don't skimp on the fresh spices and cheeses.

This was great, a different twist on original lasagna. I loved the spinach and zucchini. A little too spicy for us, so I just added the sauce of the chipotle peppers. Everyone liked it.

My favorite lasagna so far.  Absolutely delicious!  The complexity of flavors from the chipotle, spinach, and variety of cheeses is wonderful.  What a welcome option vs. the traditional lasagna!  I've received so many compliments on it, and requests for the recipe.  There are a few mistakes in the recipe though.  Cook time is shorter than 120 minutes, if you read the directions, it's actually 60 minutes.  Spinach added should state  "one package" instead of one pound (that's way too much).  I would also say the prep time is more like 45 minutes.

The recipe was great!! But i changed a few things. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and stuck to the traditional ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese. I also added chopped carrots into the mix, and used hot sauce instead of chipotle sauce. Reason is, i couldnt find it.

This was perfect for entertaining!  I made it ahead, enjoyed my dinner party and totally impressed my guests.  We weren't sure what kind of salad to serve it with...we ended up doing a mexican style salad, but italian would have been better.  The only change that I made was using shredded mozz instead of fresh.  OH, and gluten free noodles which worked just fine, we couldn't even tell the difference in this recipe.  It is alot of work, but I will make it again for sure.  Amazing lasagne!

I have tried many, many, MANY  lasagna recipes in my time, and this is hands down my favorite of all time!  I did use the chipotles in adobe sauce - about four I believe and it added just the right amount of heat!  YOU MUST try this recipe!  It is work but so completely worth it! Only thing was - nine lasagna noodles did not quite make enough for three layers, so it was more like two and 1/2 layers - it doesn't matter! YUMMMMMMMM!

This was amazing.  My husband's favorite to date, he says!  I had to leave out 2 ingredients though: I actually couldn't find chipotle peppers in my area so I just didn't use it and it still turned out wonderfully!  I also omitted the fresh oregano because I couldn't find any.  The basil is such a strong flavor anyway so I didn't miss the oregano.  Next time I'll look harder for the pepper since, after all,  the recipe has "chipotle" in the name.  But it was awesome and I can't wait to make it again!

I love this recipe. I used it a couple months ago, with rave reviews! I don't cook very often, but I eat all the time. This lasagna is the cat's meow. The cream cheese & spinach rather than ricotta, as well as the smoke from the chipotle peppers, not to mention the zucchini, asiago and fresh mozzarella make this lasagna feel like home. I had several people say it was the best lasagna they ever had.

Amazing lasagna!  This is only the 2nd lasagna I've made but it's by far the best I've ever tasted!  I like spicy stuff so used 2 peppers, but it's still not hot at all, but has great flavors!  I used ground turkey instead of the beef.  So delicious.  Don't like the tin foil lining, will do without next time.

Followed the poster's advice.  Even though I love Chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, I used (2) chopped, dried chipotle peppers and added them with the garlic, mushrooms and onions.  Wow.... great flavor!!  I also used about 4 oz of fresh spinach with the cream cheese and just added water until it was spreadable.  I fed my 4 year old nephew and my 80 years old parents and everyone in between and it was applauded by everyone!  Thank you Lori for the out-of-the-box recipe.

This lasagna is awesome! We made half without chipotle for the kids, and they loved it.

After making this recipe, I can see why it has such great reviews! The few issues I had were the same as mentioned by other reviewers: I reduced most of the ingredients by half (as suggested), and it still filled a deep 9X13 pan all the way to the brim, so I feel like some of the quantities are off. (I still have a container of the chipotle sauce mixture in my fridge.) Also, it requires more than 3 lasagna noodles to cover the bottom of a pan that size. I used cooked whole wheat lasagna, and it took 4. I would recommend putting down a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan (which most lasagnas do), because even though my pan was sprayed down well with olive oil, the pasta kind of stuck to the bottom. Other than those small glitches, the flavor is excellent. The changes I made were to make it vegetarian and to reduce the fat content: I used 1 pkg veggie crumbles for the beef, a blend of fat free cream cheese and low-fat ricotta, and also used reduced fat shredded mozzarella in place of the fresh (just seemed like it would be too rich). Used fresh spinach instead of frozen, sauteed and well drained, which I pureed in a food processor with the cream cheese/ricotta. I used 4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Even with these changes, which made it much lower in fat, it turned out well. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone. It is time consuming, however, so it definitely should be done on an evening when you are not in a hurry!

I don't think reviews have really done this recipe justice. 

Its fantastic. Have you ever had a good sausage pasta with a cream tomato sauce? Think of that as a base for this dish, with the added bonus of the chipotle peppers, fresh basil and fresh cheeses. 

It DOES take some work, Definitely a bunch of steps, but when it all comes to its probably the best lasagna I've ever had. 

NOTE: As others have said, the 9x13 couldn't hold all of the oozing goodness. I cut down some on the zucchini just so it wouldn't overflow too much and it still was spouting in my oven. You need something deeper for this. Also, DON'T do the aluminum foil, I have no idea why that is added in the recipe.

I made our vegetarian since I had no meat on hand, and I have to say it was amazing! With so much flavor in the sauce, we didn't miss the meat at all.  I added an extra pint of mushrooms in the sauce and used dried basil and oregano in place of fresh.  Also, I didn't have cream cheese so I just subbed Ricotta Cheese (about a pound or more).  Delicious!  Thank you :)

I like spicy food so I used 4 chipotle chilies instead of one.  I only used one pound of ground beef and left out the sausage and there was plenty of meat.  This was soooo good.

Absolutely fabulous. Brought to a work potluck and 4 people had to have the recipe. I added generous fresh herbs, and two adobo chilis (live in New Mexico so could have added a bit more, but most people will probably be happy with one). Also added diced tomatos instead of stewed. Didn't cook the noddles, just let pan sit in fridge overnight and checked to make sure it was not too dry before cooking. (I'll never cook noodles again!). Enjoy

Made exactly as written.  It was too cheesy.  Because of this each of us only had once piece.  We did not like the cream cheese taste and prefer Ricotta/Cottage Cheese in our Lasagna.  The meat sauce was awesome however.  The addition of the Chipotle chili and the Hot italian sausace made it!  Next time we make lasagna, we will use this meat sauce but put it in a more traditional lasagna recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used 6 chipotles. It was not spicy at all. Cant imagine how weak it would be with one! If I were to make again I would probably use like 20 peppers. I do not foresee that occurring as this was just meh and not worth the time or money.

Lori's Spicy Chipotle Lasagna is by far one of the best recipes for lasagna I have ever made!  The chipotle adds a nice smokiness to the sauce. The zuchinni soaks up the flavor of the sauce. It's really good in it.  This is a good dish to make when you are trying to "sneak" some veggies in for extra nutrition.  The cream cheese is a nice change from a ricotta or bechamel sauce and is a bit easier to make.  My family and I loved this lasagna!  My thanks to Lori!

I made this for a party and everyone absolutely raved about it.  It is a very nice change from the ricotta, sauce filled lasagna that I have made in the past.  This is definately a keeper.  Thanks for sharing Lori.

absolutely fabulous! i used 3 chipotle peppers in adobo and it had a little kick.  i was afraid at first it would be too spicy for my 7 guests.. but they ALL raved about it!!! a little labor intensive like all lasagnas, but the good thing is: it's a big recipe.  i used an 11x13 and 9x11 and used 15 lasagna noodles total.  will make again and again! :)

Oh my gosh. This was the best lasagna ever! My husband said it was his favorite out of any lasagna recipe he's ever had- even over his grandma's! I couldn't find the right peppers (I didn't see Lori's comment about using the dried/ smoked chipotle peppers until after I'd done my shopping), so I left them out. Next time I'll try it with the peppers. I also was unsure about not boiling the lasagna noodles beforehand, but since it didn't say anything about that I just threw them in there uncooked and it turned out great! As everyone else said there was a ton of food- I made 2 9x13 pans and froze one for later. But really, this was soooooo delicious!!

Great lasagna, was worried about the amount of cheese, although it tasted fine.  I used 4 fresh small chillies and added a head of broccoli which I steamed, then fried, to add a bit more green.  I also cooked the sauce for over an hour to add flavour. I had a 14 x 9 x 2.25 inch dish and it all fitted in it.  Will be definitely keeping this recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I, too, had trouble fitting it all in one pan, so I used two. Sadly, I forgot to add the basil and oregano. I even grow it in my garden. It still tasted great, though. Next time, I will add the herbs and use a very deep pan. Thanks for the recipe.

This is now my favorite lasagna recipe!  Everyone who tries it loves it.  I omit the chipotle chile because those are too spicy for my taste, but that is the only change I make to the recipe and it's perfect!

My boyfriend said that I had to go online and give this 5 stars for him :)  He also said that it was the best lasagna he had ever had and that it was restaurant quality.  I got a little flustered when making this for the first time and skipped the part where I add the basil and oregano!! It will be much better next time!

I had to scale the recipe to half because of what I had on hand.  This def. needs a deep dish lasagna pan for the full recipe!  I had to make some changes but mine came out de-lish!  I rinsed off my chipotle from the can diced it up and through it in with a 15oz can of diced tomatoes in sauce.  Used half fresh and half dry herbs.  The sauce is amazing and I can definitely imagine it in other things.  I had to use shred moz. but would like to try sliced next time.  For the spinach, I used fresh, about 8oz that I chopped then wilted in the microwave.  I was only able to use one layer of zucchini.  I will def. make this one again with ALL of the ingrediants on hand!

This lasagna is sooooo delicious!  I used gluten free lasagna noodles, 4 peppers and a spoonful of the adobo sauce, used jarred tomatoes from the farmers market that had basil in it already, and completely forgot to add oregano.  And it was still great!

This will definitely be replacing other lasagna recipes for us. The only adjustments I made were to use 4 chipotle chilis and use whole wheat noodles. This was fantastic!!

Outstanding!!....my neighbor just left with the last piece. Luckily I made 2 pans because there were nothing but raves all through dinner. I never change recipes here until I have made it once as written. Only thing was..I could only make 2 layers but I used the specified amount in the 2 layers and it was all good in the end. This is expensive to make (cheese is very expensive where I live) but absolutely professional quality and worthy of any dinner party.

This is an amazing recipe - even when you really mess it up! Some of us don't read as closely as we should - it says "one chipolte chile in adobo sauce, chopped" NOT one can of chipolte chiles dumped in the dish. I couldn't figure out why this was so BLAZING hot. I'm a weinie and all.... But even with the heat (layered under a blanket of sour cream) I could still taste the wonderful flavor and my crew who loves the heat really loved this. I expect to make this a lot, but in a milder fashion... thank you for this recipe!

This was sooo good. Definitely one of the best lasagnas I have had in a while. I did make one little change though. I don't like frozen spinach, therefore I bought fresh one. Sauteed it, then added the cream cheese, and added a little water, so it is not quite as thick. I also added one extra chipotle chile. Didn't make it too spicy IMO, as I don't really like spicy food. Delicious :)

Love this lasagna, delicious! I use 3-5 chipotle peppers, depending on who is eating it. With a little extra noodles, zucchini, and cheese, this recipe is enough for 2 pans. I only do 2 layers in each pan otherwise it spills over.  Works out well as I always try to make an extra pan to freeze when I'm making lasagna. I used turkey sausage and it turned out great. A definite crowd pleaser.

Truly amazing lasagna!  I used all sweet Italian sausage and no ground beef, omitted the zucchini and used 2# fresh mozzarella.  Received rave reviews to a group of foodie guests.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is the 1st time I write a review. This lasagna was absolutely delicious & full of flavor. I highly recommend it. I will make it again & again, but I will cook the lasagna 1st before i put it together. I thought it was a little hard on the ends for my personal taste.

Very Hearty! A keeper for company. My husband has asked me not to make regular lasagna again. I halved the recipe, only made 4 noodles (boiled before baking), 2 layers and baked in a 1.5qt oval dish. I found the chile in the mexican section of the store. I would use diced tomatoes next time to avoid large tomato pieces.  Also skipped the fresh herbs to save on cost (which is the main reason for my 4 rating) - for 1/2 size lasagna, cost about $25 with all the ingredients, particularly the variety of cheeses.

Used this recipe the first time I ever made lasagna, and needless so say I've never made another recipe. It's excellent. The store I was at didn't have chipoltles so I used 4 or 5 jalapenos instead, and it tasted so good I still haven't tried it with chipoltles. Why mess with a good thing, right? :)

This was probably the best lasagna I've ever had. I used a whole can of chipotle peppers because I like a lot of heat in my food. If you don't have a high tolerance for spicy food you might want to try less or substitute the Italian hot sausage for sweet Italian sausage.

My husband and I loved this lasagna!  I used one chipotle chile in adobo sauce, one pound of hot sausage (no ground beef), no mushrooms, diced instead of stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, dried instead of fresh herbs, no zucchini, no asiago, and shredded mozzarella.  Basically I used what I had on hand and it was great.  Thanks for sharing!

OMG this lasagna is delicious. I was surprised how much better it is than original lasagna..I subsituted ground beef for ground turkey and it was so good. I like how it had a little spice to it, but not too spicy.

This was a very good and flavorful dish. It was better than what I expected due to trying out so many lasagna recipes. I couldn't have more than once piece because the seasoning was so strong; I used the bottle kind and I think that it turned out being more than is actually supposed to be in there, even though the bottle said otherwise.  I think next time I will add another chipotle because I really liked that extra kick it gave. I'd say this recipe is a keeper and I'll be making it again.

I really enjoyed this. It is a bit time consuming but what lasagna isn't? Plus, it is so worth it. I used the entire can of chipotle in adobo sauce and it was super spicy. We love spice here in Louisiana though. Still the kids had a little bit of trouble with the heat but loved the overall flavor. Maybe next time I will only use 2-3 chipotles rather than 5.

this stuff is so darn delicious i could eat a whole pan.  ok, maybe not, but quite a bit!  you can make substitutions and add different spices or cheeses and every way i've made it, IT ROCKS!  all my friends loved the little kick of spice at the end.

This was excellent!  I didn't have chipotle chilis, just the sauce that they came in.  I put in almost 2 TBS and it still wasn't very spicy, but it gave a wonderful flavor.  The zucchini was a total hit with the family.  I didn't have any sliced mozzarella so I used provolone instead.  For some reason, I can't get the 3rd layer into the pan, so I only had two layers.   The entire dish was a huge success.  Thank you!

This is GREAT!  I had another lasagna I thought was my favorite but this is it now. A couple minor things I did, I used an entire small can of the chipotle chilies in adobe sauce because we like spicy, and it did not make it to spicy.  I used the no-bake lasagna noodles and fresh spinach I steamed, drained but did not squeez and it came out perfect!  Just adds a little different taste to a great dish!!

We, me and my boyfriend, loved this recipe!! we didn't add any zucchini and put about six chipotle peppers in instead of one because we like spicy food but other than that we did everything like it says and it was awesome! it makes a lot.. and like some people said kinda over flows on a 13 by 9 pan but that was fine with us! its not very noodly either but i like that to because you can taste the other stuff so much more. seriously have to try this recipe!~

OUTSTANDING!!!  The BEST lasagna I ever made--and I've made a ton of it!!!  I couldn't find the chipotle chile pepper in adobo sauce anywhere (live in PA, so my "international section" at the grocery store is very limited). Anyway, I eliminated it completely and used a little chili powder and Tapatio (had this left from when I lived in San Diego).  I added the chili powder and Tapatio to the meat mixture and the whole dish was AMAZING!!  I'm sure if you made it with the chipotle pepper it would be even better, but that's hard to imagine.  I would recommend making this in a larger pan than 9x13.  Mine was overflowing.  If you have a true lasagna pan, use that or you will run out of room.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is the best! I love that it does not have ricotta! I used chipotle salsa once, as market was out of canned peppers. Turned out just fine. FYI...the canned peppers freeze well for the next time you make the recipe. Thanks for a new twist on lasagne! I'm always asked for the recipe, and happily share ALL RECIPES website. Excellent!!

This is a great lasagna!  I omitted the mushrooms, used dried herbs, cut the spinach down to 12 oz. and used one zucchini.  I used one chipotle pepper, per the recipe and did not taste any heat from it, lots of flavor but no heat (which is what I was after).  Turned out wonderfully rich and delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Lori!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it has become our family’s favorite lasagna recipe, second place is a white chicken lasagna.  The only thing I do differently now is to use fresh spinach which I saute just until wilted.  I’m not a fan of frozen spinach.  I wasn’t sure about this recipe at first but it is truly outstanding.  The flavor is excellent!  The prep time is rather long so now I spend a day making a bunch of these for the freezer so we can have them whenever we want without the hassle.  I also don’t bother with the aluminum foil lining because if you grease the pan well it’s not necessary plus it often tears when serving the lasagna.

I have made many lasagna in my day, this by far is the tastiest ever - I get requests to make it for every holiday, or if we are ever asked to bring a tray of something for an event. People actually remember it... I was nervous about adding an entire chipotle pepper the first like 4 times I've made this - but just do it! it will not be too spicy - it is a perfect blend of flavors - Who ever posted this recipe - thank you our family LOVES it!!

This is the best lasagna EVER! After making it several times, I have made multiple "tweaks" to please my family's palate. First, I use olive oil cooking spray over all inside surfaces instead of putting foil on the bottom. Then,  I use two chipotle peppers plus one teaspoon of sauce, 24 ounces of mozzarella (pre-sliced logs in 8 ounce packages makes this easier), I slice my zucchini into thin rounds using a mandolin, use 1-1/2 cup each of Asagio and Parmesan cheeses (although I agree, any hard Italian cheese works fine) and I use up to double the noodles depending on the size of my pan. I parboil my noodles about 5 minutes; just like the way they come out better, although you can use "no cook" lasagna noodles. I strongly suggest you get a disposable deep dish roasting pan of split this up into two 9 x 13s or multiple pans. I may try shredding the mozzarella and zucchini next time just to get more coverage. Whatever tweak you decide to make, it is all delicious!

Very good creamy lasagna!  Made half recipe for two of us.  Didn't have stewed tomatoes so used one  ripe tomato diced and some leftover tomato sauce (no paste).  Used half package of frozen spinach, juice and all.  Put noodles in hot water to soften while making sauce.  Zipped up sauce, we like  a liittle heat!  Used spinach and carrots shredded for different layering.  Made Chef John's flaky biscuits while letting lasagna cool.  Yum!!!!

Awesome sauce ! Not all Italian sausages taste great so pick a brand which you like to use. I diced 2 green zucchini and added them to the sauce on the last 15min simmering stage. Everyone loved it. Meaty cheesy lasagna.

Absolutely amazing!!  The prep took a while but was worth it!  Used noodles that didn't require boiling and used a larger pan.

I am a vegetarian so I didnt put meat I substituted a meatless ground beef. This recipe is like no other lasagna I have ever had.  It is really delicious.  Everyone loved it, even the people who were not lasagna lovers.

This is great! Had it at a friend's house and asked her where she got the recipe.  I added more garlic and chipotles, but otherwise did everything in original recipe. 
Be warned that you need a deeeeeeep 13"x9" baking dish. I had a little of everything left over, but no worries. I'll make a mini one later.

One of the best new recipes I have tried in quite some time!  My family said they'd prefer this over ordinary lasagna anyway!  Be aware it is quite spicy.
