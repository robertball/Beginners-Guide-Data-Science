I made these cookies for my husband because the recipe sounded like one that his grandmother used to bake for him when he was a little boy. I had to substitute Kahlua for the brandy, but the result was fantastic.  This is a simple and delicious cookie.  I can't wait to make another batch.

This is a nice recipe for a delicate, light, melt in your mouth cookie.  Very much like an ice cream cookie.

Made this recipe today with French cognac & the black walnuts...EXCELLENT!!!  The cognac compliments the rich distinctive flavor of the black walnuts PERFECTLY!  Better than any pecan nut balls I've ever made or ever eaten.  Will definitely do regularly.

If you are going to use brandy, black walnuts are the way to go and should not be substituted for English walnuts.  There is just a "different" taste about them that pairs really nicely with the brandy.  Also, I was lazy and skipped the confectioners' sugar at the end.  I don't need cookies to be super sweet, and thought they tasted fine without the extra sugar.  This is quite a unique combination and I will definitely be using this recipe again.  I just wish black walnuts were a little cheaper!

These were really good!  I didn't have brandy so used bourbon instead and it didn't seem to hurt them!  Will make a great addition to my holiday goody plates.  Thanks!

This cookie wasn't bad.  I LOVE  black walnuts.  I am amazed at how many people in the area I now live have never had them.  Anyway, my dough was very sticky and made my hands super messy and the cookies came out with an almost greasy taste but when they sat overnite were much better.  I prefer another recipe I found here but wanted to try this one because it was easily made vegan.

Didn't have regular brandy so we used apricot brandy.  Also added just a splash of almond extract.  Loved!

A tasty use for black walnuts! I didn't have brandy, but Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur) worked very well. Another reviewer mentioned that rolling the balls was a sticky mess, so I dusted my hands with flour before pinching off the dough for each cookie (or two) and I found it really helped get a smooth ball with minimal stickiness. Black walnuts also make an intriguing  twist in your favorite chocolate chip recipe, and they make a terrific addition to banana bread. I recommend letting the banana bread rest overnight after baking so the flavors have time to mellow.

I think black walnuts have a very strong flavor so I used half cup of those and half cup of regular walnuts in the recipe. That was my only change. I thought they were still too strong black walnut flavor. The brandy flavoring was masked. But the cookie  had a nice texture and the dough was easy to work with.
