I've made this corn cake many times and I absolutely love it. It is especially delicious on top of chilli. I always double the recipe becuase it goes FAST. I've made some changes that make it even yummier and easier to prepare. I can't find masa harina so I always use all-purpose flour. Instead of water I use one 8.5 ounce can creamed corn. I don't bother processing the thawed corn -- it's perfect just thrown in. Also, I mix everything in one bowl -- much less mess and it turns out just as delicious.

This turned out great with a few modifications...mostly to make it healthier.  I used 1/4 c of butter (recipe calls for 1/2 c) and that was plenty.  Instead of 1/3 c of sugar I used 1/4 c Splenda, perfectly sweet enough.  I used 1/3 c all-purpose flour plus 1 T cornmeal in substitution of 1/3 c masa harina.  I used canned corn, which I did pulse in the blender with a little cream, though I don't think that is necessary if you don't want to do so.  I would have used creamed corn but I didn't have any.  I baked it in an 11X7 b/c I thought that fit into the 13X9 water bath easier.  Turned out just the restaurant...probably healthier though.  Will make again, probably double the recipe though so the pieces are thicker.

I used less butter and just ground up some corn meal for the masa harina, and it turned out great.  It was meant to be for dessert, but my gang didn't want to wait!  We'll definitely be makign this again.  Note: Make sure to read all the directions before you start - I made the mistake of putting the mixture into a pan that would not fit into any of my other baking dishes, so I had to move it to a smaller one!

This is wonderful!  It reminds me of what you get at Don Pablo's.  I couldn't find any of the masa harina except in a 10 lb bag and that was too much.  I did what a previous reviewer did and used a little bit of flour.  Will definitely make this again.

YUMMY!  My family told me this was better than you get at Chevy's or EL Toritos.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I think I may try the advice of another reviewer and lighten up on the fat though, a bit too decadent for every day, but what a treat it was on our Thanksgiving table.  I hope it can be easily doubled, so we'll have more next time!  Thank you for sharing!!!

My whole family loved this dish.  I used milk instead of heavy cream.  We will have this again soon.

This tastes exactly like the sweet corn tomalito they serve as a side at Chevy's! I used canned corn instead of frozen... this is SO good!

Mmmmm!  I made this today to go with grilled ribeyes, salad and apple pie.  I quadrupled the recipe except for the butter which I doubled and cooked it for 60 minutes in a 9 x 13 pan and it was perfect.  (I thought it was too sweet and personally would halve the sugar but everyone else thought that would be a bad idea!) I took someone else's suggestion, mixing the masa harina with warm water, adding the butter and sour cream (instead of heavy cream)and then adding the other dry ingredients.  I mixed the corn in last.  I did not have to use a mixer when fixed this way.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

This is a staple for any "Mexican Meal Night". Absolutely. I do make some changes though....but only because I wanted this recipe to be more of a "Pantry Item" type thing than it is as written. I use, and am happy with, 1/4 butter. I use 1/3 cup flour with 1 TBS Cornmeal mixed in, rather than the masa harina. I use I can cream style corn, rather than the frozen corn & cream. I skip the food processing step as well. Everything else stays the same.  The water bath does a great job with the texture of this dish. My kids love it. My husband loves it. It throws together in a snap; so I love it.

Like suggested by others, half the butter and just 3 tbsp. sugar, used sour cream instead of the heavy cream.  Just a procces improvement:  Cream the butter, mix the masa harina (tortilla flour) with the water(warm is better) and then add the butter.  If the water is warm, it´s more easy to to have a uniform batter, helps the butter to soften a little and doesn´t allows any crumbs. I also mix the sour cream in the masa/water/butter batter, ´cause it´s a "wet" ingredient and that helps to get an even distribution of the ingredients.  Then mix all the dry ingredients and add to the wet ones. Perfect results. Don´t skip the water bath.

This recipe was just like the corn cake I have tried in restaurants.  It was good, but I only used half the amount of corn the second time I made it.  Very good!

Sweet corn cake is one of my favorite treats! Once in a great while I have it as a reward or a pick me up. I have used this recipe which is fantastic, the best yet on several occassions and the last time I used 1% milk and Light Margerine(I can't believe it's not butter-light) And it was still VERY GOOD and less calories and fat. It still tasted rich and fulling.

I was looking for a copycat recipe for the sweet corn cake you get at El Torito Mexican restaurants and I found it with this! I absolutely love this side dish. The flavor is phenomenal. Usually I make a creamed corn casserole for Thanksgiving, but I am skipping it this year and I am going to have to make this instead.

If I could rate this more stars, I would. This is the BEST recipe for corn cake I have ever tried. My family LOVES IT! I usually triple the recipe and it is devoured by the end of the night.   I do 1 thing different in this recipe, though. Instead of using whole kernel corn, I use cream style corn instead. For a double recipe, I use 2 15oz cans and omit the heavy cream.   Best corn cake ever!!

I originally reviewed this recipe on 2/11/2007 and still attest to that.  This is the BEST corn bread recipe EVER! But it can be difficult to find the Masa Harina. My grocery store recently changed ownership and no longer carries it. Please know that the WHOLE FOODS MARKET chain carries Masa Harina in their baking aisle. I also read that a decent substitute for Masa Harina is Corn Meal but it must be ground very fine (i.e., like powder as is flour) in a processor.  I will try this substitute at some point and post another comment accordingly.

This was SO good. I might decrease the butter next time. I did like it the way it was but we need to cut out some of the fat. It was so easy to make. My picky daughter whom is 8 loved it. It reminded me of El Toritos cone pones from my child hood. Thanks for a great recipe. I will make it again and again.

Yum!  Tastes like Chi-Chi's and it's easy to make at home!  I prefer to bake in an 11x7 pan inside a 9x13 pan for a better surrounding water bath.

This was awesome! I took the advice of others and used creamed corn the second time I made it--much better with the creamed corn!

Perfect as is. It can be undercooked a little for that eat-with-a-spoon consistency, or cooked a little longer for a cut-into-squares-and-eat-with-your-hands consistency. Make it all the time now!

This was soooooooooooo good - just like the Cheesecake Factory.  I did cook it for 5 extra minutes without it in the water, to see if it would dry up a little and it came out perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was just like the corn cake at the local Chevy's.  Made it exactly as directed and it was perfect.  Family was so surprised that I could make this at home.  Thanks for sharing this, Lee Ann.

Yeah, this is the sweet corn cake you love from your fave tex-mex restaraunt! I always double because the recipe really is better suited to feed 4 instead of 6. It's totally ok to sub milk for the cream. There's always been something just a tad off about it though so next time I'll sub flour instead of masa harina to see if that helps, but great as is!

i love this stuff!! as others mentioned, it does not need as much butter or sugar as the original recipe. i used a little sour cream instead of heavy cream, and a little extra canned corn. be sure not to process it too much so it stays chunky. also i used cornmeal and flour (about half and half) instead of masa harina.

This tastes just like the Sweet Corn Cake served in Mexican restaurants.  It does seem a bit heavy with the butter--I will cut it down in the future.  I will definitely make this again.

very good. a little sweet for us. decided to sub masa for cornmeal for an all-masa cake, which gave it nice, smoothness and flavor. also in true "Nourishing Traditions" fashion, I soaked the flour in milk and water first. Amazing! And LOVED the real corn in it!

This corn cake is absolutely delicious!  My family loved it, even my picky husband. :)  I used regular flour instead of masa harina because that's what I had and I didn't use a food processor for the corn.  I definitely plan on making this again but I think I will use less sugar next time because it is very sweet.  All in all though this is a great recipe!

I'm addicted to Chevy's Tomalito and was dying for a way to make it at home - I tried some of the other corn cake recipes on this site, and this is - by far - the best...so buttery and creamy, and rich. I've made it numerous times, sometimes substituting all purpose flour or whole wheat flour when I don't have any masa harina, and each time it has come out great. Best tip I've seen so far in the rest of the reviews - substitute a can of creamed corn and leave out the milk. It tastes wonderful this way, and takes out an extra step :)

Delicious!!!  Better than any restraunt's version. I also added a small can of black beans and green onions and ate it with chili.  After reading other reviews I must make a comment: DO NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MASA HARINA it will NOT be the same.  All of the grocery stores in my area carry it and it's very inexpensive (Super Walmart had 3 brands)

I served this at a party and it was a big hit.  If you can not find "Masa Harina" look for "Corn Flour" they are the same thing! Also I was in a hurry and simply added the frozen corn without processing.  It turned out well.  Be warned if you use frozen corn without processing the batter appear a bit crumbly.  It melts quickly in the oven and bakes normally but turns out a bit chunkier in the end.

I have been looking for a recipe that is like the sweet corn cakes you get at Mexican restaurants.  This one is definitely it.  I will do as other reviewers suggested and reduce the butter to 1/3 C. It was a little too buttery for my taste, but it was still good.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Super yummy. Made it for a Mexican-themed party, and everyone LOVED it!!! I followed other reviewers altered the recipe with:
1 can creamed corn, no water, less on sugar, and smashed up some tortilla chips instead of the masa harina. Wonderful and simple recipe!

This was delicious!  I have been looking for a recipe close to corn bread casserole that is spruced up and a little something different than the original.  This is the recipe!  I lightened it up a bit by adding lite butter and only 1/4 cup, it seemed plenty, along with fat free half/half for the cream.  I didnt have masa harina so I used flour and a can of creamed corn for the whole kernel corn.  It turned out very good!  I did cook it about 5-10 min. longer, I think just because I used creamed corn it didnt set up fully and was more creamy.  But we liked it that way!  I may next time try not adding the water to it if I use the creamed corn so it will set up a little better, and then see which way we like it best.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Its so good!

I used the suggested alteration of using creamed corn instead of processed frozen corn and whipping cream (because I'm too lazy to bust out the processor!), and it still worked like a dream.  Just like El Torito's corn cake, which they don't seem to know about in the PNW.

Yummy!  I took the advice of others and used flour plus corn meal instead of the masa.  It takes longer to bake than the instructions.  I threw in a can of cream of corn and didn't bother putting the whole corn kernals in the food processor.  I like the texture better.  And of course I added a little more sugar so it was nice and sweet!

This recipe has become a staple at our house anytime we have Mexican.  I leave out the water and use a can of creamed corn, instead of frozen, and skip the food processor part.  I just dump it all into a bowl and stir it up.  Turns out fabulous every time!

Delicious!  I used flour instead of the masa herina, negated the cream and instead of water I used a half can of cream corn.  I also did NOT put the corn in the food processor.  Turned out WONDERFUL!

I made this exactly as written except I tripled it for a large party.  I thought it tasted delicious and everyone agreed.  I would, however, decrease the amount of butter.  I thought it to be too greasy.  The flavor was outstanding and I will definitely make this recipe again and decrease the butter to use 2/3 of the amount called for.

Let me just say....WOW!  If you've had this at your favorite Mexican restaurant and always wanted more, now is your chance.  This is so yummy and relatively simple to make.  A couple of suggestions...when it says to cover the pan with foil, cover it tightly and when cooling, leave the foil on so it stays moist.  Also, I used a full can of corn (drained) instead of the frozen and it worked beautifully.  I will make this recipe over and over again.  Thanks for sharing!!

Great Recipe!!   I did make some changes though based on a review I read and since I wanted to make it healthier. I used 1/4 c of butter (recipe calls for 1/2 c). Instead of 1/3 c of sugar I used 1/4 c Splenda. I used 1/3 c corn meal instead of masa harin since that is what I had on hand. Instead of the 1/4 c of corn meal, I used flour.  I used one can of cream corn and a 1/2  can of regular sweet corn and instead of the cream, I used skim milk!   This turned out great and tastes just like Chevys Fresh Mex sweet corn tamalito! YUM!

This was very good. I took another reviewers advice and only used about 1/4 cup of butter and also 1/4 cup of sugar. Oh, and I used 1 1/2 cups creamed corn so I didn't put any in the food processor. Everything else was the same. I think 1/2 cup of butter would be a little too much. I ate this with some leftover cheese enchiladas. *Yum*

Made this tonight to go with cheese enchiladas. Very good!
Since I can't have sugar I used 3 TBSP of a sugar substitute (Nature Sweet since Splenda doesn't do well in baked dishes). I took the advice of other postings and cut the butter in half. Everything else was as written. I liked it quite a bit but my wife thought it could have been a little sweeter. Next time I will increase to 4 TBSP of sweetener. 
I used an 8x8 pan and thought it came out a little thin so I think I will use a smaller pan or double it next time to add some thickness. Oh yes, there will be a next time!

EDIT 3/23/08: Made this again this weekend with the following changes. I doubled everything except the butter and sweetener (again, a non-sugar sweetener). I used 1/2 cup of sweetener and it was a bit sweeter. The wife liked it much better. Used half cream style corn and half frozen kernels that went through the processor. Baked it in an 8x8 and we liked the thickness MUCH better. I should have baked it for longer than the hour though--it never did set in the middle. Maybe 1 hour 15 minutes or so next time. Still 5 stars!

This recipe is AWESOME!  Tastes just like the sweet corn cake they used to serve at Chi-Chi's!!  The recipe says to process the corn..but I usually just throw them in whole and it still comes out great!  Everytime I make it my fiance wants a pan to himself!  Thanks for a great, no-fail recipe.

THIS IS AMAZING! My husband and I were in heaven!  Here are a few things that we did: 1)serve with corn on the cob (husked and save the husks); 2) cut a couple of corn tortillas in 4 pieces, spray with cooking spray and salt to taste; spray the corn husks with cooking spray; put both the prepared tortillas and the prepared husks on a cookie sheet and throw the cookie sheet in the oven with the corn cake for about 15 minutes; 3) prepare pico de gallo (tomatos, red onions, cilantro; guacamole (avocado, garlic salt, squeeze of lemon juice), and tostonis (puerto rican dish: boil a plaintan [Latin banana] in water for 5 minutes, peel off skin, chop in angled slices, fry until LIGHT golden in corn oil, take out of pan and press between lots of paper towels, put back in pan and fry until golden brown, take out of pan and place on paper towels, sprinkle with garlic salt); 4) place golden husks on plate with oven tortilla chips spread evenly (place 3 on each plate); 5) top each chip with one of the following: guacamole, pico de gallo, and light/fat free sour cream and also add tostonis to plate; 6) use an ice cream scoop to scoop the corn cake and place scoop in middle of plate (with the topped chips and corn husks surrounding); 7) add the corn on the cob to the plate.

I made this recipe and it's delicious. I'll be making it again. It tastes just like the sweet corn cakes served at the major Mexican restaurant chains. This same recipe, with minor variations, is repeated three times on All Recipes.com. The similar recipes are: Chi Chi's Corn Cake, Sweet Corn Cake and Sweet Corn Cakes.

Fantastic! I made as written except threw it all in food processor and left batter slightly chunky. Served as main dish. Topped with homemade southwest ranch sauce, salsa, and fresh cilantro. Heaven.

You could healthier it up but for the first time making it for our New Year's Eve party, I didnt want to.  My only changes were to use half&half, because it is all I had.  I also used Creamed Corn.  This was excellent.  Everyone loved it and kept going back for more!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is wonderful!  However, I usually just throw it all together and blend it with a hand mixer, You can substitute canned corn (omit the salt if salted) and use sour cream in place of the heavy cream (I think it tastes better this way anyhow)  It will cook faster if you drop the grate in the oven and preheat the water while you are blending the ingredients.  With the sour cream, this tastes just like it does at the mexican restaurants, and my husband begs for me to make it!

Big hit for cinqo de mayo!  Reminded me of El Torito side dish.  Used a can of creamed corn instead of frozen.  Perfect consistency, will make again since I had to buy a big bag of masa harina.

In college, I worked at the Chi Chi's restaurant in La Crosse, WI.  This has got to be the same recipe they used.  This corn cake is AMAZING!  In the past 8 days, I've made it 3 times.  It's that good!  I do prefer mine just a little sweeter, so the last two times I made it, I increased the sugar to just shy of 1/2 cup.  This corn cake reheats fantastically, too!  Thank you SO much for adding this recipe!  I'm making it again tonight!

Have tried other recipes - these are by far the best. Taste just like the ones at Cheesecake Factory!

Loved it! Just like the Cheesecake Factory but without the long wait and the price tag. Great with Mexican, BBQ, Chili, or just on its own. I used Bob's Red Mill coarse grind cornmeal (my favorite) and sweet corn (that I froze last summer). Make it just like it says...you won't be sorry!

My family loves the corn cake at Don Pablos, so I tried this recipe to see how similar it would be. It's very close with a couple modifications: reduce butter to 1/4 cup and substitute 1 can of creamed corn for the whole corn.

This was so good.  I didn't have any masa harina or half and half so I just used flour and milk and it came out fine, actually much better than fine.

I made this recipe on 6/5/03. I thought it was a cake version but the cake didn't rise. It is too sweet and too buttery and too soft. It comes out like a corn cream. I didn't like the recipe.  I found it unusual a cake with no eggs.  I just didnt like it.

I have been looking for this recipe for years! Yes, it's just like the restaurant version! I took other reviewers advice and reduced the butter to 1/3 cup and only used about 1 cup of corn and it turned out great! This will become a regular side dish for our Mexican meals.

Very,very good. The star of the dinner party. I had a bag of super sweet baby white corn in the freeze to use so I added just 2 tbls of brown sugar. This stuff was beautiful with a sexy texture and smelled like heaven. Way better than I expected.

This was great!  It tasted just like the restaurant chain!  I didn't have whipping cream so I subbed half and half and I don't think that you  would be able to taste the difference.  Also, the leftovers were really dried out so before I heated it up I poured some half and half and water in and mixed it up. It tasted like it was just made, so moist again!

I've read the other reviews, hardly ever comment on recipes but I do feel the need on this rare occasion to say that I have been wondering for a long time how to create this favorite Mexican treat. If you follow the recipe exactly - it is very flavorful, moist, delicious and the perfect consistency and just like what I have had in my favorite Mexican restaurants. I could not find Masa Harina, so I used All Purpose Flour and I couldn't even tell the difference! This is an All-Star Recipe!

Yum! Exactly what I was looking for. Very much like the chain Mexican restaurants. Nothing fancy, but great comfort food. I grated a little Jack cheese on top and doubled it using a 9x13. Will definitely make again!

The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because it calls for conrmeal. The 1st time I made it all I had was cornmeal mix and it was 5 stars! The second time I used just plain cornmeal and no where near as good.

This was such a great treat with our homemade chicken, black bean, and corn enchiladas. It did however take over an hr. I decided to follower another reviews suggestions on using creamed corn, less butter, spleda over the sugar and omitting the heavy cream. The taste was very good and felt light. Will definitely use again, maybe trying it in muffin pans next time. Thanks for a great recipe

Changed a bit, but was delish.  Don't know what masa havina is either.  Mixed softened butter and a can of cream corn.  Did 1/4 c of white corn meal instead of masa havina.  Then mixed all dry with butter/corn mixture, added water and cup of shredded colby cheddar.  Baked in casserole with cover and served with chili.

Not as "cakey" as I was expecting it to be. It's not bad, but I feel like it should have been a little more puffy. Was good, will make again sometime.

I made this exactly as writen except using canned corn instead of frozen. I was expecting it to be a bit creamier so I think I'll use canned corn next time and omit the whipping cream. It was still really, really good! I highly recommend it!

I really liked this dish as an alternative to everyday cornbread. I made this as a side-dish to a baked bean and smoked sausage meal. The only change I made is I used a can of whole kernel "Mexican" corn to add a bit of color. I will be making this again soon, but I will also double the recipe because it does go quick! So yummy!

Amazing!!! I love making this as a side dish with a lighter dinner, like steak salad. The only change I make is that I have never used heavy cream; I substitute whatever type of milk I have on hand and it still turns out perfect.

Amazing!!! Made this and the whole 8x8 pan was gone! My hubby ate most of it and loved it. I was skeptical because this didnt seem to be a lot of batter (which was very thick and kinda chunky). And this was my first time using masa harina which I found in Walmart. So prefectly sweet and tender. Reminded me of the corn cake that we get at a local Mexican restaurant that is scooped out with an ice cream scoop. Just delicious, I did use frozen white corn. Other than that...followed recipe exactely....Do Not skimp on the water bath....I really believe that the texture of this recipe is because of that. Worth every calorie! Love it...served along side of Ropa Vieja in a Slow Cooker in this site. Thanks!

i tried this two ways. The 3 star rating is for the recipe as written. the first time i followed the recipe as written.When the dish was ready to serve the end result didnt turn out how i expected it to. It was kinda tough and sticky. Tacky even.  The second attempt i made a few changes.  I normally ise the chichis packet to make thins and all you do is add butter and cream corn so thats what i did. I followed the recipes ingredients and measurments except - i omitted the frozen corn and heavy whipping cream. I substituted those for a can of creamed corn.  I prepared it by using a large bowl and combining all the dry ingredients.  Next i added the cream corn, butter and water. Mixed to combine.  Then i poured into the baking dish and baked.  The result was dead on chi chis.

Awesome!  Followed the recipe exactly (had some leftover masa I was looking to use up) and it turned out perfect.  Served it with some marinated chicken breasts topped with caramelized onions and avocado...delish!

Oh just inject the fat right into my thighs!  Why oh why did I decide to make this?  Now I know just how easy it is to make this tasty stuff.  This was just TOO GOOD!  I used one can of creamed corn in place of the frozen corn & whipping cream.  One can worked out exactly to 1.5 cups.  And since it was "creamed", I skipped the food processor step.  I also used splenda instead of sugar.  Total comfort food...corny carby goodness.  BTW:  This is EXACTLY the same as "Sweet Corn Cakes" by Sue202 and "Chi Chi's Corn Cake" by Saundra...trying to save you the step of comparing recipes like I do.

I was making chili  today and wanted to try something different, instead of the usual cornbread.  I love the sweet corn cake from ElTorito and have tried to make it before with no success.  I found this recipe and I am VERY happy with th results! First, I did not have masa harina or cornmeal ..I just used a package of cornbread mix.  I did use 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c sugar as recommended. I used a can of corn and measured out 1/4 c of the liquid and used that in place of the water. I only had half & half , so I used two Tbls of that. I baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes. It was not the pudding texture, but not as firm as cornbread, kind of in between. It went great with the chili!  My boyfriend said it was better than ElToritos and he was happy he gets more than a small scoop!   I will make this again!!!

Very yummy, made just as it said. Delish! Don't confuse masa harina (which is a corn flour) with harina de maise ( a course cornmeal.) masa harina is sold in the paper bags just like all purpose flour. It is corn flour specially prepared with lime. Also called instant masa mix.

My wife hates me for making this recipe! She wants carbohydrates like a cat wants a bath. She cant stop herself from dishing some onto her plate and going for seconds. I have been searching for a scoopable corn cake recipe since having it as a side at Chevy's resturant. This is as good or better! I am not a big cornbread fan, but this has been conjured from heaven. I tried to find a small bag of masa harina since this is the only recipe I have that calls for it. I could only find a big sack at Aldi's. After making it, I'm glad I got the big sack. I did not alter this recipe at all. It is perfect. I will alter it in the future though. I need to make a bigger batch. The 3rd time I made it, I forgot to add water. It still turned out delicious.

I made this with a can of creamed corn instead of frsh corn and left out the cream.  I also did not like the texture when I removed it from the oven so I left the foil off and put it back in the oven in the water bath for another 30 mins.  Nice and crumbly but firm with a fantastic crust on top!  I will be making this a lot!

These were wonderful with one modification...LESS BUTTER that's why I gave the recipe a four (sorry)!  I only used 1/4 cup and that was plenty.  My family raved over this recipe.

I LOVE this recipe!!  I doubled all ingredients in recipe but used some other comments to help--used only 1/2 cup butter, AP flour for the masa harina, omitted the water and heavy cream, used a 14.75 oz. can of creamed corn (didn't need to pulse in food processor).  I also wanted to make in the crockpot, since I was lazy and didn't want to heat the oven in July.  I cooked the mixture in my 5 quart crockpot for 4-5 hours on low, and it turned out perfectly!!  I will certainly make this one again!!

This is great.  Have you ever been to Cheese Cake Factory and ordered their tamale corn cake appetizer?  They serve their corn cakes topped off with chunks of avacado and pico de gallo on top.  Ok..so I did the same thing.  I can not imagine eating this without anything on top.  To me..it would not be NEARLY as good and kind of boring.  Try it with the topping for a 5 star recipe!!!!Otherwise, to me, it is just a 3-4 star thing.  The Masa Harina - was easy to find.  I just got it at the local Walmart in the baking aisle.

YUM.  That about sums it up.  I used cream corn instead of frozen and accidently put in a whole cup of butter (I don't know that that was so bad!) and it turned out WONDERFULLY.  We fought over the leftovers.  My cake looked a bit soupy after the alotted time, but LET IT SIT.  It turns out marvelous!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great restaurant quality recipe.  I made a day ahead of time and reheated with some shredded cheddar sprinkled on top.  Served with fajitas.  Will definitely make again.

I use creamed corn it make the cake more moist. I cut the butter to 6 T and sugar to 1/3 C.  If I don't have heavy cream I have used sour cream instead.

Wonderful, very similar to the corn cake found in several Mexican restaurant chains.  Like a previous reviewer I susbstituted all purpose flour for the masa harina with good results.

I made this exactly how the recipe calls and it was great! I then made it again but doubled the recipe and used 2 cans of creamed corn and no heavy cream and it was even better!  The creamed corn adds an extra sweetness so you can cut some of the sugar. I will say that I think 2 cans is too much corn, next time I'll use1 to 1-1/2 cans. Yummy recipe!

I made this last night as a side to Fajitas. It was a hit and everyone liked it a lot, however, I thought it was too buttery (if there is such a thing)! I would like to try it again with 3/4 or even 1/2 cube of butter and see if it is successful.  I don't like the idea of eating a whole Tablespoon of butter in every serving!

I was looking for a recipe that was similar to one at my favorite Mexican restaurant's corn cakes and this is it!  It is time consuming, but well worth it.  If you want to save a little time, use 
creamed corn.

Very good.  Just like the restaurants.  Next time I would reduce the butter just a tad and double so it is thicker in the pan.

Mine turned out crumbly.  I had reduced the fat.  Next time I'll leave it full fat, add a little extra water and keep the bake time to 45 min. 50 max.  But the flavor was great and just what we were looking for.

This is very good! The first time I made it for today's thanksgiving feast and it was gone quick! So I have to make another batch, and this time I doubled it. I didn't change any of the ingredients. Way better than the restaurant.

Oh... my.... word! This will accompany every mexican dish that leaves my kitchen from now until the day I'm old and senile. The only change I made was to use fat free half and half for the heavy cream. Simple delicious!

Not sure about this...it cooked weird and i ended up overcooking it cause I didn't know if it was done or not.  I wish I would have read the directions cause I automatically thought It would be a round little cake and I would fry it but then I started making it and realized it was just more like cornbread or something....I know...shoulda read the directions.

This was awesome.  I accidentally used herb butter, which I thought would mess it up, but it didn't.  I plan to make this again.

Very good - I used fresh corn and regular flour since I didn't have the mexican flour.  Will definitely make again.

Fabulous!  The only change I made was to use one small can of cream corn and a big can of whole-kernal because I had no frozen.  Will definitely make again!

This is sooo good. It's far from healthy so I don't make it often, but when I do we all enjoy it. I've also never used the heavy whipping cream, milk works just fine.

This is so delicious! It's not low on fat, with all that butter, but it's worth it. I use fat free half and half instead of cream because I usually don't have cream. My kids like it too. One of my kids can't eat wheat so it's nice that this happens to be gluten free. Yum!

This was absolutely wonderful!  I think I could cook this about 10 minutes less in my oven (I cooked for 50 minutes) so that it holds together a little better when scooped.  Or maybe I'll just make a double batch so that it fills up my glass baking pan a little more.  I used can niblet corn instead of frozen and served this with Acapulco Chicken.  Tasted great together!

I used a little frozen corn plus one can of cream corn. Added just a little water. Didn't have any masa so just used AP flour. Ridiculously delicious.

Good, but can be made much simpler and exactly as tasty! Throw 1 can creamed corn, 2tbs heavy cream, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/2 cup butter in med saucepan over med-high heat stirring constantly. When butter is melted add 1/2 cup corn flour (masa harina) and 1/2 cup corn meal and keep stirring, then within moments it's done. Maybe 5 minutes start to finish, and its perfect!

After reading the other reviews I decided to double the recipe. I doubled all the ingredients besides the butter I did the called amount and then half of that. I still baked it in the 8x8 pan and cooked it for about 80 minutes, it was amazing! Also the last 5-7 minutes I did remove the foil so the top wasnt so soft, but I did not let it brown. After sitting for >5min it was perfect to scoop =) Happy Eating!

Awesome...  Wonderful...  Can I continue? Just what I've been looking for for years.  (They use to serve it at a Mexican restaurant in California.)  It's a new Thanksgiving staple and a whatever-special-occasion-I-can staple.  ;)  Yes it's called corn CAKE. yum.  (oh and don't forget to make sure and cook it long enough, especially if doubling/tripling/quadrupling the recipe... what?  It was thanksgiving!)

This is really delicious.  I always make it when I make chili. I have made a few modifications.  Use only 1/4 of butter it is plenty.  I also use whole corn flour instead of masa harina.  2 cups of corn.  1/4 cup of sugar makes it sweet enough.  And in the place of the whipping cream and the water I use buttermilk, 1/2 cup total.  Comes out great every time.

It is sooooo good! I've been making this recipe for the last 2 years and everyone loves it! It will not feed more than four people and it's difficult to make large amounts because of the way is cooked in the oven with water.  I made this for my dad with splenda instead of the sugar and it tasted really good too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe, but I did make some modifications for a couple reasons. I tripled the recipe because I made this dish for a party at work. I couldn't find the masa harina, so I used flour instead. I used 3/4 cups of all-purpose white flour and 1 cup yellow corn meal. I took the advice of others and used less butter. I used 2 sticks (1c) of unsalted butter instead of 3. I also used 2 cans of creamed corn in place of the frozen corn. So I didn't have to put it in the food processor. I used 2% milk in place of cream. I had to bake mine for about 75 minutes total and that is probably because the batch was large. My co-workers gave rave reviews, so I will make this again. I guess I modified it quite a bit, but I was using what I had. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

This was so good. I used the creamed corn like some others did.  I didn't have masa flour, so I used corn meal and then put it into my chopper until it was very powdery.  Worked fine.

Everyone loved it.

If I could give this a hundred stars I would.  It was by far the best sweet corn cake we have ever had. Much better than anything you get at ANY restaraunt!!  I doubled the recipe and it was gone in 5 minutes (there was only 7 of us!!!).  I made it exactly as it was written and wouldnt change a thing.  Thank you SOOO much for the wonderful recipe!!!!

Definately double the recipe, except for the butter. Only use 1/2 c. I have made it both ways, and you can't tell any difference with less butter. Also, to avoid excessive dryness as some others have indicated, cook it for a little less time (I cooked my double batch for 65 minutes).

This was my first time making corn cake.  I found the flavor to be pleasant.  Not too sweet with a hint of saltiness.  I didnt think it was very sticky and instead rather crumbly thus the 4 stars.  Like another reviewer said, it is a little too decadent for every day but I might make this again on occasion.  Interesting dish.

I don't even like corn but I love this recipe. So so good. I also used only 5 tbls butter and 1/4 cup sugar and that was plenty. I used only about 3/4 cup corn. Any more would have been way too much!! Very good, but rich. Not for every day but for a treat, can't be beat!!

After having some excellent corn cake at a Mexican restaurant recently, I HAD to try and replicate it.  This recipe was perfect!  I substituted all purpose flour for the masa harina because it was what I had on hand.  I baked it for 55 minutes and it was great.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was good, but it tastes alot like the cornbread casserole made with the Jiffy mix, that is much easier, and I think even better. I thought I should add that I fed this to my inlaws. The next day we all went to Don Pablo's, my Mohter in law ordered the corn cake, took one taste of it, and said this isn't half as good as yours. Since she is one of the sweetest people in the world, quick to hand out compliments, this may not mean as much as it seems, but still.

Tasted awesome.  But don't do like I did and try to put it into mini-muffin pan to try and have molded littled cakes.  It's too soft for that, and it should be that.  So, it looke messy when I took them out, but that didn't matter after we tasted it.  Didn't change a thing; I cooked the recipe as written.

Oh my goodness was this phenomenal.  I had never heard of corn cake before, as we don't typically eat mexican food, but I made this to go with chicken enchiladas and this was so yummy!  You have to eat it after it has cooled for 10 minutes because it isn't as good after it cools to room temperature but my was this good!  I used a blender to chop the corn and that just worked out okay-  some kernels were processed and some were not but that made no difference.  I might even leave them whole next time and not bother processing them because this dish was delicious anyway!

I came accross this recipe when I was looking for a side dish for a mexican meal.  I have always been a firm believer in the theory that every meal should have a protein, a vegetable and a starch, but try doing that with a Mexican-themed party!  This recipe was perfect but I found that here in the South, they call this dish corn puddin'.  That's right, no G!  I double the recipe and bake it in a 13X9 pan.  It is fantastic! I make it every time I attend a Mexican-themed party and it is always a huge hit!  I get plenty of requests for the recipe.

Because I made this dish for company, I doubled the recipe and spread it in a 9x13 pan, which I set inside a broiler pan of water.  I was afraid I might need to increase the baking time, but one hour was perfect.  The directions were easy to follow and the result was out of this world.  Everybody agreed that this corn cake was better than what the restaurants serve.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Tastes just like corn cake popular in many SoCal restaurants that sell for a dollar or two for one small scoop! Perfect with spicy Mexican food, just take a small bite to soothe stinging taste buds. Yum yum yummy!

Delicious! Like the corn side dish you get at Chevy's..but more authentic tasting. I suggest doubling the recipe but still baking it in an 8x8.

Okay, based on others suggestions, I halved the butter and added the same amount of water to take the butter's place. I wish I would have cut down on the sugar though, it was way too sweet and I have a major sweet tooth. Otherwise, the family went crazy for it, it was very similar to the sweet corn tamales that I've had at a popular mexican restaurant chain.

These were deilicious.  I made them in individual ramekins and served them with chopped tomatoes and avocados on top, with a cilantro cream sauce and a chipotle cream sauce on top.  I think next time that I will change the cream to evaporated nonfat milk and cut down on the sugar.  They were plenty sweet for what I want to use them for.

Great recipe. I cut back the sugar to 1 tablespoon and added a couple of diced roasted jalapenos for a little bite. Delicious. New standard side dish for Mexican night in my house. Thanks!

i had to change some things due to what i had on hand, but it worked rather well.

7 T. butter (oops, i melted it)
1/3 c. regular flour
1/4 c. water
1 can cream-style corn
1 pouch (6.5 oz) Betty Crocker cornbread & muffin mix
1/3 c. sugar

that's what i did. less mess and still tasted fabulous!

I will definately make this again! My picky 2 year old ate a whole bowl! It was very delicious, although a little crumbier than I would have liked. Maybe next time I won't cook it as long, so maybe it will be a little more moist!

Oh my gosh! This was so delicious. We had family over and I served this along side fajitas.  Usually my fajitas get the attention, but this time, it was all on the sweet corn cake--totally yummy.  I wanted to make more the next day. Thank you for a great recipe.

Lovely taste and texture! My husband, my 2 year old and I ate the whole thing for dessert. I can see how this can be used as a sweet cake or with a savory dish. I think when I use it with a savory dish, I will add half the amount of sugar. I used smart balance to lessen the calories. I had to let it cool completely in order for it to be firm enough to cut out of the dish...I've never had anything like this before. It was quite good. Thanks for the recipe. Can't wait to experiment with it in the future.

Fantastic! My friend and I have been wanting to find this recipe since devouring the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes at Cheesecake Factory.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe! We topped each serving with a little chopped cilantro, tomatoes, avocado, and a sour cream sauce (sour cream + adobo sauce from a can of chipotle pepper).  They were fantastic!

I made this twice this Thanksgiving holiday. The second time I made it I doubled the batch, and in an 8x8 that means double the cooking time. Everyone LOVED this recipe and so did I. I will be putting this into regular rotation. Thanks!

I turned this dish into tastey corn tamales by using corn husks and foil to wrap small portions of the corn mixture and then placing the indivdually wrapped tamales in a pan 1/2 filled with water and letting them bake/steam for 45 minutes. They were a huge sucess. I have never recieved so many compliments.

Loved it!! Had company over the first time I made it and they loved it. They even asked how to make it so I know it was really good.

Our family loves this recipe! We always make a regular batch and a spicy batch (1 diced jalapeño mixed in and then sliced jalapeño placed on top). Broil for 5 minutes after baking, just to crisp the edges.

I've made this twice now and must say this recipe is very easy and delicious! Try the recipe as written before making changes and see how you like it. Don't make the mistake I did the first time around though, which made it a little dry for what I wanted (thought batter was too moist and buttery; added more cornmeal and masa harina). The second time around I stuck to the recipe as written and it was just like what I was looking for and very close to a local BBQ joint's corn cake! The only other changes I made were to make it lactose free (used vegan unsalted butter and coconut cream).  My husband enjoyed it both ways and rates it a 5, while I give it 4.5 because it is super buttery--good but so buttery. I might reduce the butter next time as suggested by other reviewers and will definitely be making this corn cake again! Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Wonderful just as written.  My husband and I had corn cake for the first time at a local Mexican buffet and fell in love.  This recipe matched what we had there exactly.

My guests liked it, but I didn’t.  I followed other reviews and reduced butter by almost half.  I definitely don’t think more butter would have been better.  Also, agree with others that there is too much corn in the recipe.  Also, used AP flour mixed with 1tbsp cornmeal instead of masa harina.  
I won’t bother making this again.  There has to be a better recipe out there.

We used to love this from chi chi's and found the mix when the restaurant went out of business.  Much better than the mix and easy too.  The first time I went by the directions exactly and the flavor was wonderful.  But too much butter.  Second time, I used tips from reviewers and found doubling the recipe-used 1/2 cup of butter, no water, 1 can of whole corn, 1 can creamed corn and the rest of the doubled measurements and it was just right to scoop from pan.  Delicious, thanks for the recipe and the reviews.

This is by far one of my favorite recipes! It is a hit with everyone I make it for. Yes, it's sweet, and yes it's not the most healthy recipe, but this kind of dish isn't supposed to be super healthy! This recipe is even better than the sweet corn cake you get at El Torito.
One thing to keep in mind is that this recipe doesn't make very much. It feeds my family of four, but when I have others over I double or even triple it!

I expected a cake that was more like a pudding or porridge than a layer cake. That's what I got, so I'm satisfied with the recipe in this regard. We liked both the flavor and texture, and found was just the right amount of "sweet" for us. The cook time and temperature were also just right. 

The reasons it's not a five star recipe: 
1) The method involves too many steps and results in too many dirty dishes. 
2) Call for 1 1/4 c or one 15 oz can creamed corn instead of the labor-intensive route of defrosting frozen whole kernel corn and then putting it through a food processor with a caution to not over-process.
3) 1/2 cup is FAR TOO MUCH butter. When the dish is served warm, melted butter runs out like syrup. 

Alternate method:

Preheat oven to 350ºF.

In a small bowl, combine masa farina, cornmeal, water and cream. Set aside.

In a medium or large bowl, cream together butter, sugar and salt. (I cut the sugar into the butter with a fork.) Stir in creamed corn,  cornmeal mixture and baking powder.

Pour into ungreased 8x8" baking dish. Cover with foil; place on center rack of preheated oven for 50 minutes. Uncover and cook for another 10 minutes. Test for doneness; when a toothpick inserted into the center of the dish comes out clean, the dish is done.

Serve warm.

Please note: this recipe does not yield a product which has the same texture as cornbread. It is more the texture of Yorkshire pudding.

I will remake with 1/4c or 1/4c + 2T butter.

This tastes just like the sweet corn cake that used to come on the side at Chi-Chis..  I used flour instead of masa harina since i couldnt find this at the store and also used milk instead of cream because i forgot to buy it and it turned out perfect!!

I took some reviewers' advice and cut the butter and the sugar in half.  The taste was good, but it turned out rather dry.  Next time I'll use the full amount of butter and see what I get!  :)

I LOVE the spoon bread at Don Pablos and this matches it!  But I live on an island I can't always get all the ingredients.  So, here's my "off the shelf" version".  2 packages Marie Calenders corn muffin mix, 2 eggs, 1 14.25 oz can sweet creamed corn, 1/4 cup melted sweet cream butter, a large "dollop" of sour cream (approx. 2 tbsp), and 3 tbsp honey.  Mix it all together, pour into greased 8x8 pan and cover with foil.  Place in water bath and bake for 50 minutes.  Then sprinkle with shredded mild cheddar cheese and bake for 10 more minutes.  Yummy!

I've been looking for a sweet masa recipe for a long while now. This recipe is perfect! I did everything according to the directions, except I didn't have frozen corn, so I had to use a can of white corn I had on hand. It still turned out great! I will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks for uploading this recipe!!

I tried this version, and it was delicious!  I didn't use the Mexican Harina, I used regular All-purupose Flour.  It still came out delicious - can't wait to do it again, or try another version.  I just love allrecipes.com, I'd recommend it to all levels of cooks.

A sweet creamy party in my mouth that I search for at Mexican eateries. Seriously, I think I ate half of it before I got it onto a dish. I used fresh corn that I cut from the cob which makes all the difference. Other than the corn, no changes.

great recipe!  We always had this dish at chi chi's.  Couldn't tell the difference.  The only thing I changed was I did not have the masa so I used 1/3 cup of jiffy corn muffin mix. I used milk as others did instead of cream.  Because I used the yellow self rising cornmeal I did not add baking soda or salt.  Turned out great.  There was no leftovers.  :@)

This was FANTASTIC!  We loved it as a side for enchiladas.  Made exactly as written...except I could NOT find masa flour locally, so out of desperation I used 1/2 white flour and half finely ground cornmeal to make up that 1/3 c that the recipe calls for.  The water bath is a must to get the right consistency, so don't skip that step.

This was sooo good!  I didn't do it with masa harina, just did the flour/cornmeal substitution someone had made, and it turned out great.  I also used one can of cream corn instead of frozen corn.  Even my husband, who doesn't like cream corn, said he would eat it again!  He went back for seconds and then complained because it was all gone after that!

I love this recipe! I am now known for Killer Corn Cake. Lee Ann you should name it that! My favorite part- sometimes I don't have cream and substitute milk and it still comes out just as good. Tonight we are trying it with some ortega chilis!

This was good, but I served it as a side and it was more dessert-like.  I loved the corn taste from the masa, but mine did not rise. I'm not sure it was supposed to rise.  If I make it again, I will decrease the sugar.  It reminded me of the classic corn pudding made with Jiffy mix.

This was great--JUST like the kind I love from the Mexican restaurants. The only thing was I should have increased a little baking time. I used a shallow baking pan and it was still a bit underdone after preheating and baking per the recipe. Good news was, the family loved it so much they didn't care!

This was so good! I didn't change a thing, and it turned out perfect. The texture is very soft and moist, somewhere between a pudding and a cake.

I've made this many times in the past two years and I always get asked for a copy of the recipe. I follow the recipe exactly but I always double it because it is so loved.

This was great and so easy! I wasn't about to buy a huge bag of the masa harina just for a 1/3 cup, so I used regular corn meal instead. I topped with green onions for a garnish and it was a hit!  I may try using some creamed corn next time in addition to the frozen corn. I also thought about adding a pinch of honey...

Oh my goodness- this is one fine dish!  I made a few changes based on reviews.    I didn't mess around with the salt, sugar, corn or water- I used one can of creamed corn instead.  That was a good choice.  This is delicious.  I'm glad it's so rich- that means you only want to eat a tiny portion.  Very good recipe- thanks for sharing it, Lee Ann!

Excellent. Everyone enjoyed this. Next time i think i may try to reduce the butter just to make this a little healthier, but the recipe is delicious as is.

I live in the UK and was looking for a recipe for sweet corn cake like you get in L.A. This recipe is exactly what I was looking for and so easy to make. I couldn't find mas harina so I subbed with flour like one of the other reviewers. I have made it twice and all of my UK friends have never had it absolutely love it!

Need to have the butter reduced as reccomended, and one can of creamed corn instead of all frozen corn added nice texture.

This was okay.  I thought it was very greasy.  I should have halved the butter like others suggested.  It was pretty grainy, too, which I didn't care for.

I didn't think this deserved 5 stars.  It's just ok.  It is grainy in texture and falls apart.  I prefer corn bread to this.  I followed the recipe except I halfed the butter like others suggested.  as for the sugar, I lessened it a little but it was still too sweet for my taste.  I think I'll stick to corn breads.

Delicious - tasted just like the sweet corn tomalito from Chevy's restaurant.   I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.   Unless you count being unable to control myself eating it!     If you know what the sweet corn side served at many Mexican restaurants IS, then you'll be happy with this recipe.  Read the description and look at the pictures to avoid disappointment that your "cake" didn't rise.  This isn't a traditional cake or a corn pancake - it's exactly what it says it is.    Next time I'll try a little less butter and creamed corn, but it's fantastic as is.

LOVED this! I will say I did have to change it just a bit just because I didn't have a few things called for. I was out of cornmeal but I just got some grits from the bulk food section a Whole foods. I put the 1/4 cup out grits in the food processor with the frozen corn to make in just a little more fine.  Also, I didn't have/don't use heavy cream so I subbed with 2 TBLS whole milk and 1 TBLS sour cream. Even my 3 and 7 year olds loved it, and they don't like anything! A keeper for sure!

i loved the sweet corn cake at el torito so i was really excited to try this recipe. In order to reduce the fat, I used margarine instead of butter.  It turned out a bit grainy and not nearly as moist as the corn cake I have had in restaurants.  I think the butter is necessary if you want that texture.

Very tasty stuff! It's a little bit too sweet and it didn't quite set the way I was expecting but it is definitely worth trying again with less sugar and a longer bake time.

This was so good! I had friends over for dinner and this was gobbled up.  I doubled the recipe and used canned corn cuz it was all I had.  I used one can of creamed corn and one can of sweet corn, it turned out a little too sweet, probably because of the canned corn, I may cut the sugar next time. I also used flour instead of the masa and used milk instead of water.  I omitted the cream.  It turned out so good.  I took the foil off last 15 minutes. Can't wait to make this again.

The flavor was very good, and reminded me of the corn cake we used to be able to get at Chi Chi's.  However, the texture was grainy and didn't hold together.  I thought it was strange that eggs weren't in the ingredients, and I'm wondering if anyone else had problems with the cake falling apart?  If I make this again, I will add at least one egg.

I'm not a huge fan of cornbread, so, I was skeptical but this was great!  It was easy enough to put together and had lots of texture and taste and went with the enchilada soup nicely.  Thanks for a keeper recipe-my entire family gave it a thumbs up.

Wow this is the first time something that had such a great rating was a flop for me.  I LOVE sweet corn cake at the restaurant and was craving it at home.  I had everything on hand so I decided to make it.   I am an experienced cook and followed the recipe but it was kinda gross.  I baked it for over and hour and it had a really grainy texture and the taste was funky…I think it might have been the masa harina.   I am going to try again.

I thought this was an interesting recipe, different for our normal style of meal as we don't tend to eat very much corn.  But, I was serving a spicy meat dish, was browsing on the site and thought this would be a good on the side.  I knew that, for our tastes, it would be too sweet, so decreased the sugar to about 2 TBSP and followed rest of the recipe as written. I agree about letting the dish sit for a few minutes as I thought it did change the texture for the better. The taste was quite good. Thank you, Lee Ann Clarke.

Exactly what hubby was looking for! I had never had it, and I was very pleased. Thanks for the great recipe! (this was the 3rd "corn bread" recipe I tried... hubby wasn't exactly specific with his request, until after the first two weren't what he was looking for.. hah!)

Great recipe!!!!  I lightened it up a bit by cutting the butter back to 1/3c, using fat free half and half instead of whipping cream (a must for the richness and creamines of the dish), also used less sugar.  Used fresh white corn cut off the cob, I think that really added to the flavor.  A new staple on "Mexican night" in our house!

Cornbread-Pudding-Cake.  That pretty much sums up the taste (sweetened cornbread) and the consistency (pudding-cake) that you get with this recipe.  And that may be what some people enjoy, but to me it was just weird.  I would give it only one star, but I give it 3 because my son, who abhors corn, actually ate it.

So good!  You have to try this if you like the corn cakes at Chevy's or Don Pablos.  The great thing about this is you get a much larger helping at home then you do there!  Sweet and creamy a great accompaniment to Fajitas!

This recipe is now a staple in our home - whenever I plan on making something remotely Mexican, my husband gets a grin on his face and says, "how about that corn cake thing?"  Needless to say, we never have leftovers.

Followed the recipe with good results.  Will make again, will probably reduce the sugar just a bit.  This went well with, believe it or not, hot dogs.  Seems like it would go well with any picnic foods as a side dish in addition to traditional Mexican fare.

With couple of alterations, this was really good.  First, I only used 1/4 cup butter, can of corn (drained), 1/4 cup sugar(it was plenty sweet) and milk instead of cream.

This was okay, but I don't think I would make it again.  The texture was not what I expected.  It was oddly flaky.  If I made it again, I would definitely add more salt.  I also wonder how it would be affected by using less butter b/c this is a pretty fattening side dish as is.

I was able to combine the ingedients the day before and refrigerate, then just put it in the oven the next day for a little longer than normal and it came out the same as making it fresh.  This is a real time saver for a party.

I'm pregnant and have been craving corn bread, but I really wanted a nice, sweet, moist corn bread... I found this recipe last night and begged my husband to make it for me today. With hesitancy and fear that he would mess up he agreed to do it. We both have just had the BEST corn bread EVER!!! He said followed the recipe to the teeth. The result was delicious corn cake with just the right amount of sweetness, texture, etc. We ate it with a spoon right from the pan. This is a great recipe and it reminds me of pamonha (Brazilian "tamale").

Yum! I'd call this spoonbread, but it's very good no matter what you call it. I used flour instead of the masa, didn't process the corn, and I used half sour cream, half milk for the cream.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! One of my favorite restaurants that used to serve something similar to this closed and i was devastated. This actually tastes just as good if not better. I loved it so much i immediately made a second batch and took it to work. Everybody there loved it as well. I found this recipe very easy to make, I didn't change a thing. I can't wait to make it again.

Great Taste.  I've cooked this in the oven according to the recipe and also in a slow cooker for about 3 hrs on high. Next time for the slow cooker version I'd add a little extra corn meal or flour to thicken it up a little.  Normally you reduce the liquid for a slow cooker recipe but I didn't want to be left with part of a can of creamed corn.

This is just like the one from Don Pablo's.  It's great!!  Couldn't find masa harina, so i substituted 1/3 C. flour & 1 T corn meal.  Turned out just fine.  Will make again soon!

Incredibly delicious!  I had the ingredients on hand to make this as the recipe states, but saw that another reviewer had used a can of creamed corn instead of frozen and eliminated the water so that's what I did (saved a little time).  My family inhaled it.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!!

What a great recipe, I didn't think it could turn out so well, almost exactly like the one at Don Pablos, the only thing I would change is the amount of salt, it wasn't enough for me, otherwise this recipe was a big hit!

Sooo good.  I was initially worried because I bought a huge bag of masa just for this recipe, and because I'm not exactly planning to make tortillas from scratch anytime soon, I thought it would go to waste.  After making this sweet corn cake, however, I know just where the rest of that masa is heading!  More corn cake!  Very buttery and sweet, great texture, and so easy to make: I dumped everything in my stand mixer and let it rip, then followed the baking/water bath directions exactly.  Instead of ice cream for dessert, my boyfriend went back for more of this! :)

This was delicious! Used all purpose flour in place of the masa harina and milk for the cream. Cut back slightly on the butter and sugar and it still turned out very moist and a great sweet corn flavor! A must try for a different twist with your mexican dinners.

I loved corn cake as a kid when my family and I went to the occasional Mexican restaurant.  I made this recipe after remembering this treat and not eating corn cake in over ten years. It is better than I remembered!  I made it as written without modifications, but I might make some of the suggested substitutions soon to reduce the fat content, as I've been making a lot of this lately!

good!  next time i will take other reviewers' advice in order for it to be great.  there was too much butter and too much sugar - needs to be cut in half.  also, i didn't have any masa harina so i used all purpose flour which didn't make a difference, i think.

This was absolutely amazing.  just like a restaurant that used to be around here made.  I love it.  Took it to an early Cinco de Mayo party and it was GONE!  I'm making it again today for another party tomorrow.
I made it exactly by the recipe, except I doubled it.  It was perfect!  thanks!

Yum!  I love this stuff when we get it at Chevy's and always wish I could have more.  Now I can.  I used one can of corn instead of frozen and used whole milk instead of cream.  I also cut back the butter to 5 Tbl and substituted 1/3 cup flour + 1 Tbl cornmeal for the masa harina.  I don't know what this recipe would taste like without those changes, but what I ended up with tasted pretty much exactly like what I get at Chevy's.

We were looking to recreate the spoon bread from Don Pablos, but this just wasn't quite it.  I followed the recipe as stated, but it wasn't as sticky as I thought it would be.  It was good, but I'm going to keep looking.

This corn cake was wonderful! My husband and I ate 3/4 of the whole thing at once. I didn't have any cornmeal so I just used all masa, which might have changed the texture but we couldn't tell. The flavor and texture were both great. And it was easy to make. I accidentally skipped over the instructions to bake it in a pan with water, which was probably why the bottom got brown, but it was still really good. I'll have to get that part right next time--I'll definitely make this one again.

I wasn't a big fan of this one, it was a bit bland for my tastes. I have liked the corn cakes I've tried in restaurants.

Very good recipe.  I used all the recommended quantities, but substituted creamed corn for frozen corn.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out very nice.  I also used the remaining whipping cream to make sweet  whipped cream topping.  The hot cake topped with cold whipped cream was superb even the next day. This recipe is a keeper.

This was good, but you can buy it at the store (El Torito brand in a yellow bag next to the corn bread, it's called Sweet Corn Cake) and it's just as good, so I wouldn't suggest making it from scratch.

I made this tonight it turned out wonderful. along side black beans and rice & black eyed peas,and left over a chicken casserole it was a great complament i used light sour cream in place of the heavy cream, and i cut back on the sugar i used 3 tbls instead of 1/3 cup,i also used can corn, i process 1/2 a cup of corn and left the other 1 cup whole, was a little cumbly next time i will try using cream corn , it should hold it together a little better. but all and all this is a great recipe.
thank you for sharing

This was good going down, but had a serious metal aftertaste.  Maybe I messed it up?  I'm going to try again and I promise to re-rate it if it's better.

This was so yummy.  Tasted like corn cakes from a restaurant.  Like others, I only used 1/4 c of butter, 1/4 c sugar and 3 tbls of whole milk instead of cream.  I also cooked it at a higher temp (400) halfway through because I needed to cook some chicken.  I topped it with a little sour cream.  It was gone in no time.  I will definitely be making this again very soon.

This made our Mexican Christmas dinner really special! I ground corn meal in my coffee grinder instead of buying masa harina, and used about half the amount of whole corn as recommended by another reviewer. It is delicious and just like what is served by a favorite restaurant!

Excellent recipe - comes out great every time. I used creamed corn instead of blending up the frozed and it worked fine. It was a little more moist - I will go back to making it with frozen the next time for a slightly firmer cake.

This was delicious...and as another reviewer said, exactly like the ones served as an appetizer at Cheesecake Factory. Knowing there was a half-cup of butter in there was a little scary, though, so I plan to try using SmartBalance or something similar next time. I topped my corn cakes with drizzles of low-fat sour cream (put in a plastic baggie with a hole cut in the bottom, to squeeze out the thin lines), diced tomatoes and (drained) black beans from a can. Wonderful, and a beautiful presentation. Thanks for the recipe.

Just like the corn cake found at a famous restaurant chain! This was great... the recipe makes more than enough for a side dish. Very good stuff.

This corn cake is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and it definitely tastes like corn cake found at many Mexican restaurants.  It was perfect and I will certainly make it again!

My family just LOVES this. I make two batches each time. I ground the corn up to a paste for one (the kids don't like the chunkier corn) but my husband does.

I had corn cake in a restaurant and desperately wanted the recipe. This recipe is wonderful! No changes needed. I make it all the time when we have a mexican meal.

Very good! Just what I was craving after eating Don Pablo's sweet corn cake. I entered it in our annual fall cornbread contest at work and won first place.  I liked the Mexican corn flour taste and used stone ground yellow cornmeal so it had a lot of flavor and texture.  Thank you!

I recently went to Don Pablos and I tried their corn cakes for the first time. I ended up loving them and couldn't get enough. I therefore searched on the internet for a similar recipe and came upon this one. I've been trying different things each time I make it. One word describes this recipe... FABULOUS! The whole family loves it! Thanks!

Excellent! Top with sour cream, tomatillo sauce (Fontera's is great), chopped tomatos, and cilantro and it is just like the sweet corn tamale cake appetizer at the Cheesecake Factory.  I removed a tablespoon of butter and used milk instead of cream - still fabulous.

I took this to a spanish themed dinner night at a friend's house and everyone loved it!!  We all agreed that it is the best corn cake we've ever had.  Even better than a famous restaurant chain!

This is a really delicious recipe. The only substitution was that I used half n half (that was all I had on hand) instead of the heavy whipping cream.  It reminds me of the packaged sweet corn cake mix that I always used to buy. Now I can make it from scratch using this recipe!

After combining user suggestions and 2 all-time reader favorite Southern Living recipes, I’ve found the perfect adaptable recipe that balances between too eggy, too soupy, too cakey, too sweet, and doesn’t ever veer off into bland territory.

This was a huge hit for my family. This is as close as it gets from the version we eat at our favorite Mexican restaurant. It didn't look like the picture shown, we used a ice cream scoop. I wish I would have gotten a photo but everyone ate it to quickly! A+

This has become a staple in our house.  Made just like the recipe (best when using masa) except we just about double the corn portion and do not put in processor.

My kids love this cornbread with chili or taco meat.  Have to double recipe every time to have leftovers.  My son is allergic to wheat flour and eggs so this is a great recipe for him.   Only change to recipe was I didn't put corn in processor and I added ingredients all to mixer one at a time. Absolutely love this!

I can't wait to make this again! This recipe is fantastic. If you've ever been to the cheesecake factory, this recipe is a dead ringer for the sweet corn tamale cakes they have there. I served this with some Mexican spiced chicken I had made in the slow cooker with some avocado and home made salsa. This is going to be a staple for sure. Awesome recipe!

Used half the amount of butter, cream corn and 2 TBS of Plain Yogurt instead of the heavy cream; mashed the whole sweet corn, and increased the baking powder to 1 TBS, omitted the water.  It came out perfect!!  The taste was like a corn tamale!!

Sweet corn cake does very much replicate the corn cakes which El Torito serves.  It is a very rich and delicious dish.  

For those who cannot find masa harina locally, it is corn flour.  If you have a mill, you could grind dried corn (the grain) on a fine setting.  I have even seen unpopped pop corn used for this purpose, when masa harina was not available.  

Corn meal is ground corn, but is ground with a coarser setting.  You could grind corn meal finer with a blender.

I made it as-is, no changes (besides doubling).  It was delicious, but very rich.  Next time I make it I am going to cut back just a wee bit on the butter and sugar.

This sweet corn cake was extremely dry.  However, the flavor was good so I added a little milk when I reheated it in order to be able to eat it.

I just made this. This is sooo delicious!!! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because I followed other's suggestions to half the butter and found that they were right. Had I used the whole stick of butter I don't think I could have eat it. I didn't have heavy whipping cream, so I used evaporated milk instead and it worked great. I didn't have frozen corn, so I used can corn (drained), and I didn't use the food processor. I creamed the butter first then added the masa and water and mixed that. After that I just added the rest of the ingredients to the same bowl, and mixed all with the hand mixer. There is no need to combine the other ingredients in a separate bowl. I will also use less sugar when I make it again tomorrow, YES, it was that good. I find that it was just a tad sweeter than I like, so I'm gonna try a 1/4 cup sugar instead of a 1/3 cup. However, I did have seconds and thirds hahaha, maybe that's why the sugar hit me. If you are only planning on having one serving, it may be fine with the amount of sugar called for. This tastes just like El Torito and Don Pablo's corn cake. I'm super happy I found this recipe!!!

Yum! I didn't have corn flour, so just used more corn meal, a finer corn meal.  Also used creamed corn for corn and took out whipping cream. Came out great!

I couldn't believe anyone saying this is too sweet. My family loved it and I didn't buy masa harina either. I couldn't see buying a sack for 1/3 cup so I honestly used regular flour. I did splash a touch of extra cream in at the end, but it was still so good. I would even be tempted to toss some extra sugar in next time as well. Definitely a keeper for me.

Pretty good base.  A little too much butter.  I found it a bit greasy.  Had to change it up a bit because I didn't have masa harina or frozen corn.  I used AP flour for the masa and a can of creamed corn in place of the water and frozen corn.  It was sweet and tasty.  I'll make it again, for sure.

I am trying different variations. Frozen vs. canned. My kids LOVE it and it reminds me of a Mexican restaurant side. The mass harina, although not necessarily named that, can be found in your grocery Mexican food aisle,  check the ingredients for masa and it may say "treated with lime". That's what mass harina is called. Happy cooking to all!

I made this but I made a couple of modifications. I added cream corn instead of whole kernel corn. Didn't feel like busting out the food processor :)
Because the consistency was more on the cake batter consistency, I skipped the water bath too. I would definitely make this again but I would make it with less butter as it seemed a little too greasy for me. Overall, I love this recipe.

It was amazing.  But, next time I will cut down on the butter and sugar.  I also used less frozen corn, just a handful is plenty.  When I make this again for guests, I will cut fresh corn off the Cobb I think for better flavor.  For me, I'll substitute Monk fruit sweetener for some of the sugar.  But it was divine, just too fattening.  I can sacrifice some of the taste, it was super rich and decadent, so no one will notice.  I used half and half even, tasted better than reataurants' corn cake.

I have made this a number of times, and it's practically a Thanksgiving necessity with my family. I have found, however, that making the single batch can result in the cake being slightly dry. Make a double batch in one pan, and the problem is solved!

I make this recipe again and again.  My kids love it!  My son and I are gluten free and this is a delicious recipe that uses no flour.   We quadruple the recipe but half the sugar and use only 3/4 of the fat.  (I've used oil and dairy free butter and they both work!)  Definitely recommend this recipe!

My favorite part of eating at El Torito is the sweet corn cake on the side of the meal.  I wanted a recipe that would make a similar cake at home, and this it definitely it.  And while it makes a great side dish, it's also good for breakfast, with a little molasses or honey.

Absolutely Fabulous!!!  Simple, yet elegant enough to accompany the most formal of meals.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Ive served this many times with many dishes and although it is made exactly the same each time, it seems to get the best response when served with a spicy dish like chili or spicy BBQ.

Oh yum. I will definitely be making this again! Made just as stated. Served with carne asada tacos. I read one review that said this was great topped with chili - I can't wait to try it that way this upcoming winter! By the way, this says it serves 6, but I actually think it's closer to 4.

I've made this exact recipe, however I found it on a different site.  It was way too buttery and crumbly, not soft and moist (puddinglike) as I had expected it to be.  I will make again with less butter to see if that helps, along with doubling the recipe as it was a very thin layer as-is.  Overall good flavor, just not the exact texture I was looking for.

ALSO, i went EXACTLY by the recipe, and it came out very moist, sweet, and delicious.. i might have had a tad bit more butter than what the recipe called for, so maybe add just a tad bit more butter if you want to make sure you get that moist taste. lol. definitely 2 huge thumbs way up! =]

I made this for a family gathering.  I always get nervous when I'm making most of the food because there are a few people on my husband's side who are great cooks.  This was amazing.  I had never made corn cake before so I wasn't sure what it was supposed to look like once done.  I ended up leaving it in for 60 minutes and it came out perfect.

Good, but next time I think I'll try cutting back the sugar and adding some honey.  I was missing a bit of that honey flavor.

Wow! Talk about perfection.  I am a huge fan of Don Pablo's mexican spoonbread and this recipe is just as good or better.  I understand the substitutions for making it a little lighter on the calorie front, however, it is perfect as it is.

I have been making Sweet Corn Tomalito from this site for a long time, but finally tried this recipe -- my husband & I both liked this one better!  It was very moist, sweet & had a great texture.  For my own preference, I think I will use less corn next time.  I also used 1 cup of cream-style corn instead of the water, and cut the butter in half.

FANfreakintastic!!!!Loved, loved, loved it.  Everyone loved it.  Huge hit with the mexican meal I made.  Made 3 times already.  A little more work than plain ole Jiffy mix, but worth it.  So sweet and moist.  Great recipe.

Delicious, I left mine in a little longer for a nice crisp crust that everyone raved about. I would make it again but will try to combine some steps to make it quicker.

it really tasted good but the cok must be off on the coonking time, i followed the directions and cooked for 50 mions and it was still watery so i put it back for 10 more and still it needed about another 5-10 mins but besides that my hubby loved it and my daughter thought it was okay. ps my daughter doest like to many foods at all so i wasnt surprised she thought it was okay. i will make this again.

This is a yummy & simple recipe.  I was half-way through baking it when I realized I forgot to add the water.  The measuring cup was still sitting on the counter - yikes!  I quadrupled the recipe for a dinner party & was minutes from serving it!  Luckily, the recipe is idiot proof because it still came out delicious and moist, despite my mistake.  Everyone at the party loved it & kept commenting how they've only ever had it at Mexican restaurants - assuming it must have been difficult to make.  Ha!

This is fantastic. I only made one change - used 1% milk instead of heavy whipping cream, and it still turned out delicious. I would definitely make this again, but will reduce the amount of sugar - I like sweet foods, but I find it a little too sweet for my taste.

I love this! I made it as-stated, but I think next time I make it I'll use less butter as other people suggested. It was definitely a little greasier than I expected, especially since it looked so dry going into the pan. But I will be making this again!

I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was.  I didn't have any of the masa harina so I just used whole wheat flour.  I omitted the water and in its place used a can of cream corn and added the frozen whole kernel corn without thawing it.  I ended up baking it for about 10 minutes longer than the directions.  It was very yummy and I would definitely make this again and again and again.

It is quite easy to make, just took alittle time getting all the ingrediants together. I did 2 batches, but kept the same qty for sour cream. I wanted to add 1 can of creme corn, but I don't have any then. I used a can of whole kernel corn instead. I thought it looked dry, but it turned out just fine after 25mins of baking. Smell amazing and tasted great!

Super sweet and good. It feels like a heart attack waiting to happen, so you might want to cut back a bit on the butter if your being health conscious. If you're going for an extravagant treat however, this would be a good one.

What can I say this was simple and so delicious. I made it for a Mexican party and everyone just loved it. My husband had a little taste and was jealous I was taking it to a party. I had to make him some too, so he would stop pouting.

So good! I was looking for something like Chevy's recipe. I made exactly as directed, the only thing I would do differently next time is less processing of the corn, so that there are more corn kernels. This is supposed to serve 6, maybe in the "tablespoon" sized portion of this that you might get at a restaurant - if you want a bigger portion (and who wouldn't?) I would scale the serving number up. I had this as a side with chili instead of my usual cornbread, and it was absolutely yummy.

Less sugar - 3 tblspn is much better and I have used milk in place of the cream which still turns out great.  I have made this over and over!

I love this dish when I get it at my favorite New Mexican restaurant and this is the closest recipe to what they serve.  Try it with masa harina from the freezer section (if available) for a nicer texture. Great for Thanksgiving or anytime! Add a teaspoon of cinnamon for added flavor.

I love the flavor of this dish, I would also follow other reviewers suggestions by cutting the sugar to a 1/4 of a cup and using creamed corn instead of pureed corn

i've used this recipe for approx 6 yrs now. i'd searched for a recipe similar to the "sweet corn tamale cakes" from cheesecake factory so that i could replicate it at home...i have to say that this recipe is spot on! i've since become a vegan and this recipe works well with replacing the heavy whipping cream w/ soy creamer and using vegan margarine insteat of the butter. i love it...although it's 6yrs late...thanx for posting!

This is really good just as written. My whole family loves it. I do think the texture is a little more to my liking with an egg added.  Sometimes I used a can of creamed corn and a can of regular corn, cutting down on the water and omitting cream, and that's good too.

I've been looking for a recipe like Chevys for a long time, and this is it. I couldn't find masa harina so I used 1/3 c flour and 1 T cornmeal like someone suggested. Cut back butter to 1/4 c and it was great. I will definetly make this again. Thanks so much!

I made the recipe exactly as written.  It was ok.  If you like sweet soggy cornbread then you'll love this.  I guess I was expecting something a little different.  It wasn't bad and the recipe works as written, but nothing spectacular.

I was skeptical at first about the pan with the water step but this is one of the best corn cakes I have ever made. My husband and I both agree this is a keeper.

This was so great! I followed the recipe to a T. I wasn't too keen on the Mexican corn flour-- it has a funny taste after each bite (just my personal preference). I think I may try regular flour next time. Also, will try other reviewers advice and only use about 1/4 cup of butter and also 1/4 cup of sugar to cut down the calories. But I will definitely be making this again (and doubling it)! Thank you!

Oh my goodness, this recipe is such a treat and such a fantastic side next to some fantastic mexican food! I made some shredded beef tacos will all the toppings and served the sweet corn cake on the side and it was a huge hit! I was even thinking this might be nice to make instead of corn bread for Thanksgiving this year! Truely delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

Fantastic!  I doubled the recipe and didn't have nearly enough for my party.  I didn't have masa harina so I used a mix of cornmeal and white flour.  I blended the corn with the cream and used 2 extra tablespoons, removing 2 T from the water.  I scooped them out with a cookie scooper.  Next time I'll try it with less butter.

Absolutely Scrumptious!! 

You need to use the Masa Harina (You can find this in Mexican Foods Isle, and It's just Corn Flour for Tortillas) to make it taste like it supposed to! Don't replace with All Purpose flour! I made just as the recipe called for, I did add less corn because I like mine with less corn. (I just added 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups) It was absolutely perfect. Do a double batch because one is not enough! I used an ice cream scoop to roll into balls and served over chili. Yummy!

We love this recipe. I took advice from
other reviewers and doubled the recipe. I
also used less butter, a little more than
half, and I used fresh corn off the cob
left over from a party the day before that had already been cooked. I would make it again.

Delicious and just like the restaurant version.  However, I used to have a recipe that called for baking in a loaf pan which I felt made it more "scoop-able". Baking in an 8x8 pan made it more like polenta.

I always make this with burritos, tacos, anything Mexican. You can use canned corn and it's just as good. Don't forget the 9x13 pan of water or it will turn out hard & crunchy.

I didn't realize when I tried this recipe it was the "exact" same recipe as the Sweet Corn Cake"s" recipe on this site!  We love these corn cakes but will cut back on the butter and sugar a little next time.  Served with Salsa Chicken recipe and Mexican Rice II.

This turned out really sweet and moist.  I halved the butter and used a can of creamed corn.  Next time I'll probably use a little less sugar.

This was very very yummy. It went great with my burritos and spicy corn salad. Easy to make and the whole family loved it. I don't have a processor so I mashed the corn as good as I could...seemed to come out fine. I didn't have masa harina (corn flour) so I subbed half all purpose flour and half corn meal. I also added a little vanilla. Next time I will definately double the recipe but try in a 8 x 10 pan. Thanks Lee Ann for sharing this delicious recipe.

Wonderful!  My husband, kids and I were all fighting over the last few crumbs.
We ate it with chili.  The spicy meat and beans along with the sweet bread were perfect together.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner today and there were zero leftovers.  I used a a bit less than half the amount of butter, milk instead of water, and a little less sugar.  Everyone loved it.

Great recipe!  I changed a few things, as suggested by other reviewers, to substitute for ingredients I did not have and to make it a bit less decadent.  I only used 1/4 cup butter, and regular white flour in place of the masa harina.  I used a can of corn and roughly blended it with a hand blender.  I made it with black bean soup, and there were no leftovers :-) Thanks for a new delicious side dish!

This moist and sweet corn pudding is WONDERFUL!!!
It goes really well as a side dish with Etouffee. This is a wonderful substitute for plain, dry corn bread.

I doubled the recipe (but left the butter as stated) and cooked it in an 8 x 10" pan inside the 9 x 12" pan. Very moist and really delicious. I serve it along side chili or Mexican food. Always a great hit!

If you like the corn cake at Chevy's and the Mexican chains, you will like this! I always take everybody's when we eat out. I'm sure this has happened to more than one of you too, I knew I didn't have the Hasa Mirina so I made a special trip to the store for it and was thrilled to find it, but, I could have sworn I had cornmeal, I've seen it in my cupboard so when it came time to pull it out, it was no where to be found...ugghhh!!!  I subbed some Marie Calendars corn bread mix for the cornmeal and it was just fine!  It has baking powder already in it so I just cut the amount called for in half. It tasted really salty before I baked it but after baking was fine. I looked at it when the time was up and it looked really runny so i kept it in another 5 minutes or so but wish i would have taken it out to set up because it was just a bit dry but it was still very good.

This was alright. It was way to fatty and way to sweet for us. After I took steps to lighten it up it came out very, very good and I will make this again using my modified recipe.

Never even thought to make this, saw this reference on the red enchilada sauce and tried it with my enchiladas. Made it with no changes (hoping that masa casera and masa harina are the same thing???) and it turned out perfect.  I used to love to eat this at Chevy's, this recipe is better! Thanks!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it did come out exactly like it was supposed to.  However, the texture of the corn meal was a bit too much for me.  I prefer a smoother taste and am looking for a recipe just like this without the corn meal.  I guess it's a southern style corn spoonbread.

This recipe is awesome! It also is very easy. I am somewhat of a beginner cook and the whole "water-in-pan" thing freaked me out a little at first, but just follow the instructions exactly and you'll have no problem! For all of you Wisconsin residents, this is about as similar to Pedro's corn cake as you're gonna get!

I've made this several times for other people and there is never anything left!!    I added more corn (for a total of appx. 2 cups) and, following other reviews, cut down the sugar and butter a bit.  

In a pinch I've used milk for the cream and regular flour for the masa harina.  Both substitutions have been fine (but not as good).

Big hit, made a double batch. Didnt taste as good the next day, but that was probably due to nuking it.

Very good!  Only difference, I added a little chopped onion and when served, I topped it with sour cream and pico de gallo. Yum! We had something similar at the Cheesecake Factory, which spurned my desire to find this recipe, thanks!!

I make this when I make my Mexican feast for work and for home it everyone loves it!  I do add 2 cups of corn instead of 1 1/2 cups and it doesn't mess up the consistency.  This cornbread is still moist the next day!  Excellent recipe, thanks Lee Ann!

I made this side dish for a Mexican-style feast.  Yum!  I was debating whether to use a mix to save time...I'm glad I went with the recipe.  It was worth it.

This tasted just like Chevy's corn cake.  I even made a mistake and forgot to put the foil on before baking.  But what is the foil for anyway?  I pulled it out and was tasting it and it was great.  I then realized I was supposed to bake it covered, so I put it back in the oven covered for another 10 - 15 minutes and it was still great.  I'll make it again either covered or not!
