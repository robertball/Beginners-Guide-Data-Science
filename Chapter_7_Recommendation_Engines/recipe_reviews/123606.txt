Angel, thank you for this great recipe!!  I have been baking bread for 30 years and really enjoy trying new recipes; this is, in my opinion, the BEST tasting white bread recipe I have ever come across!  If I could rate this recipe higher than five stars, I certainly would.

This bread rose beautifully and has a great texture--crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. My husband and daughter both loved this bread and agree it deserves five stars.

We made one loaf into cinnamon swirl bread--So good! Mix 1/4 cup + 2 TB. sugar with 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Roll out one loaf of bread before 2nd rising with a rolling pin. Sprinkle with cinnamon/sugar mixture and roll up. Pinch the dough at the end of the loaves so the cinnamon and sugar doesn't leak out while baking and lt rise as usual. It makes such good cinnamon swirl bread!!

I was looking for a simple white bread recipe that I could use to introduce my 7 year old to baking yeast breads with. (Baking a batch or loaf or pan of anything is one of our favorite things to do together!) This recipe was perfect! It filled my entire house with such a yummy aroma we were almost watching the the oven till we could pull it out and gobble up a slice. Super easy and my daughter was so proud of her very first loaf of bread! There is one problem we had though. We have to make more since the first batch was gone right away! Thank you for the recipe and the wonderful learning experience for my daughter!!

Absolutely easy and delicious!  My stepkids and I made it, and it turned out great, even though none of us had ever baked bread before!

This bread was so-o-o-o good!  I split the dough into one loaf of bread and about 12 cinnamon rolls.  Yum, yum, yum!  Next time I'm going to try using whole wheat flour to see what happens.

I am not proficient at bread-making... to the point where I don't even have a loaf pan.  SO, I skipped the punching-down of the dough & put the dough straight from the greased bowl, after its first doubling, into a square glass casserole.  I pre-heated the oven with the glass pan (empty) in the oven, so there would be no sticking issues.  I raised the baking temperature to 375, and it turned out wonderfully.  I was shocked.  I expected a gooey mess, but the whole loaf was devoured within 12 hours.

Very easy to make & so yummy! I only had to cook mine for 30 minutes at 350 degrees though. I doubled the recipe & used my kitchen aid mixter to knead it. It turned out fabulous & the loaves rose up so big! I only had to add 11 cups of flour instead of 12 (since I doubled the recipe). But wow, so easy & super yummy! My whole family loved this!

First time making bread with my stand mixer.   Turned out perfect with such a nice crust, texture and taste.   Made one white loaf and one cinnamon loaf.  YUMMY  No need to look any further for a good bread recipe.

Suprisingly I have had great success in using 100% whole wheat flour when making this recipe. I just use a little less than specified, 1T. yeast 2-3 T gluten powder and about 1/4 cup oil. It comes out light and fluffy. We love it.

This bread is absolutely delicious right out of the oven. However, once cooled, I found it to be a little too heavy. I'm not sure if I'm missing a critical step or if it's just that way. For now, I will keep looking for a recipe that suits my family better.

Not a fan of this bread.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but both times I made it, it came out WAY too dense.  Will not make again.

I chose to try this recipe to accompany homemade Lasagna tonight. Since it was so simple to make I really didn't have super high expectations, but it is very, very good with the texture of bakery bread or rolls. I think I ended up using just under 6 c. flour total.

Served this up warm with butter. To die for!

Unbelievably simple! This was my 1st stab at bread making and I thoroughly enjoyed it; I had no idea it would be so easy. I've now made 8 loaves; varying each of my successive batches.  I added 1/4 c of olive oil, 2 full bulbs of roasted garlic to one batch (yummmm) and brushed the top lightly with olive oil to keep the loaves from drying.  The next batch I passed on the 2nd rising (I just let it rise once for about 90 minutes) & mixed in 3/4 c mixed brown & white sugar with 2t of cinnamon and a cup of raisins.  After the rising I applied melted butter to the top of the loaves and sprinkled a mix of 1/4 c of mixed brown/white sugar. I'm making olive bread next!

Love this. Great recipe to play with. Tonight I tried the cinnamon swirl with it and it turned out perfect. I have also substituted a couple of cups of white flour for wheat flour and it tastes awsome. Especially when I topped it with sesame seeds. Thank you for this. LOVE IT!

This bread turned out great and the dough was so easy to work with. I made the Pepperoni Bread recipe using this instead of frozen white bread dough, which is more expensive and harder to work with. This dough was soft, pliable, and didn't stick at all. It baked evenly and went well with the pepperoni and cheese filling.

Very good, very easy! I've only made yeast bread a few times & haven't tried it in years, but this recipe was simple and easy to do. The bread is delicious! The crust is crusty, the center soft and moist.

SUCH a great recipe, and soooo easy, but may need to be baked for a few more minutes than the recipe states (as was the case with my oven). A good way to get non-bakers involved in the kitchen.

This is the first time I've baked homemade bread and this recipe is great. The bread turned out wonderful, soft and moist on the inside and the crust was crusty. My family loved it and this is the only bread that they want from now on. So no more store bought bread for them and I'll be in the kitchen alot more. Thanks for the wonderful recipe..

This is the simplest and most delicious white bread I've ever made!  I've been making bread for years and had a few favorite recipes that I shuffeled between. Thought I'd just add this to the rotation, but instead I'm going to make this my one and only! Great flavor and a particularly good texture.  I can't wait to try it as a cinnamon bread!

I've made bread a few things completely by hand (no mixer, no bread machine). Most of time, it's turned out moist but crumbly...but not this time! Thanks for this great recipe. It'll be my standard.  Also, made one loaf of this as cinnamon bread...OMG! I can't stop eating it!

I have never had success in baking my very own bread. This recipe is certainly the best for me. I am alergic to gluten so the next batch I make will be made with rice flour. I will let everyone know how it turns out! I am excited as buying gluten free bread in the store is WAY to expensive for my liking. Thank you for this recipe!!

I made it according to directions and just don't care for it. The flavor is incredibly bland and just not what I was hoping for. 

I generally make bread with milk and I believe I'll return to that recipe.

Is it just me?? I've made this twice now, going exactly as the instructions say, and I've made solid white bricks. Didn't rise, didn't brown. The problem is the flour... 6 cups is way too much. The dough is so stiff that it can't rise, and tears appear as you knead. I knew better than to keep adding flour, but it called for 6 cups so I forced in 6 cups. It isn't my yeast because I have several gorgeous beer breads on the counter as I type. It's this mix. I'm going to try it one more time, but cut the flour down to about 4 cups, and see what happens.
