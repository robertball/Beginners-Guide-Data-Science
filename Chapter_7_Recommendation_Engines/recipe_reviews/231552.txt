These are delicious!  Instead of using shortening or butter I used coconut oil. I used the same ratio and probably could have used 3/4 of a cup instead of a cup. I also used organic cane sugar. I think the key here is to use almond butter you grind yourself at the store. Over all a great recipe and awesome smells!!

My whole family LOVED these cookies.  So flavorful and delicious.  The only thing I changed what the time in the oven.  It says 8 minutes but mine came out crispy but not burnt.  I cooked the rest of my batches for 6 minutes and then took them out of the oven and sat them on the top of the oven for an additional 4 minutes.  This recipe made 60 cookies for me.

These were the best nut butter cookies I have ever eaten. I did change the recipe a little but used the same measurements.  I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white all purpose flour. Instead of white sugar I used Stevia in the Raw baking sweetener measured true to sugar. Instead of shortening I used real butter. Instead of a Hersheys Kiss, I used a chunk of a Snickers bar.  These were flaky and delicious. Will use this recipe again and again and again.

This is a winner of a cookie! Has a lighter flavor than a traditional peanut butter cookie. A little gooey to work with, but worth the effort. Original recipe says '24 servings'....but I made 48 huge cookies.

Delicious! I used crunchy almond butter from Trader Joe's (No one was eating it as is so making cookies with it was ideal.) I used a tad less sugar, and topped each cookie with mini chocolate chips, and baked them for 12 minutes. They came out lightly crunchy on the outside and soft inside. Overall, a little on the dry side, but still good. The family liked them a lot.  This batch made about 40 average-size cookies.

I made these today and they were delicious with 1 change. I always taste the batter of a new recipe before I bake them.  I noticed they were missing in the flavor department, so In addition to the vanilla extract, I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  These cookies were delicious. They taste like biscotti but are chewy like a peanut butter cookie. Also the batter made 36 cookies for me, not 24.

My Son needed to take almond butter and coconut oil to his culinary  class for an assignment. Well he brought home leftovers so decided to make almond cookies with the almond butter. Well was surprised to see other reviewers used coconut oil. Win win. I don't use shortening so didn't have it in the house anyway. I thought they were ok, but thats just because it's not my favorite kind of cookie. My Son liked them so thanks for a recipe where i was able to use items i don't usually have on hand.

I like these MUCH better than peanut butter cookies! :)    Mine didn't come out "chewy", I'd say that they were more "sandy" or more like shortbread - but we ate them warm.   They may have gotten chewy if we let them get cold.       I scaled for 6 cookies and used a food scale and metric measurements.     Cut back the sugars and used a combo of butter and canola oil rather than shortening.  I used King Arthur "White Whole Wheat" flour.  I meant to use half almond flour (as I have half a bag that I want to use up) and half flour... but I forgot to pull out the almond meal/flour.  Will make again!

I found it made a lot more than 4 dozen, and that was despite munching on the dough as we went. It had an enormous yield which was awesome.

The recommendation to space them 2 inches apart was excessive and not necessary. We found half an inch to an inch was perfectly acceptable and that helped us fit all those tons of cookies onto just a few trays.

I subbed with coconut oil instead of shortening. Definitely recommended using less, like 3/4 cup rather than 1 cup. Overall, great recipe and not sickening sweet. :)

These turned out tasty and were easy to make.  I substituted 3/4c of coconut oil for the shortening.   Added a dash of cinnamon and also made the dough a day ahead and kept it in the refrigerator to develop flavor.  
Be careful to monitor the baking time because there is a fine line between soft/hard cookie results.  Some I left in the  oven for 15 minutes, which came out with a crunchy texture, and the other half I baked about 10 minutes, which were chewy.

My younger sister, who hates peanut butter cookies loved these almond butter cookies. I used soft white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. These definitely earn a thumb's up from me!

This is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing. The only change I made was using coconut oil in place of the shortening. The coconut oil gave the cookies a really nice flavor. Will definitely make again!

Pretty good recipe. Makes many many small cookies. You will be putting at least 4 cookie sheets in the oven. For me, having only one cookie sheet, that was a pain but worth it. I only put in egg whites, no yolk. I also replaced crisco for olive oil. They were a bit greasy in the dough stage but baked well. 8 min was good in order to not burn. Nice mild taste, good for husband with dietary restrictions...also, made my own almond butter in the vitamix. Worked well. Guilt free. Put in a little less salt than it said. Next time I would put in full amount of salt since it makes so many cookies... Better and chewier when warm. Harder when comes to room temperature.

shortening or white sugar, so I subbed 3/4 cup coconut oil and used only 1 cup of dark brown sugar for sweetening. That was plenty sweet for us! Don't understand any reason for hot water, just mixed the baking soda with the vanilla extract and beaten eggs. I did not add salt, baking soda has plenty. I used the raw, unsalted Trader Joes chunky almond butter...next time I will use my own. I had a jar that I had wanted to try of this, thinking if it was good it would save me some time from making my own. Bleh. As usual, quality ingredients are the key to anything delish. Used my own vanilla extract too, with the caviar. There it all is mixing up in the KitchenAid, I added 1 cup of flour, then 1/4 cup increments - only used 2 cups of flour, but remember I didn't use the hot water, my almond butter was very chunky and dryish, and I use unbleached bread flour, so there are many reasons why I did not dump 2-1/2 cups in, just being careful! This dough was extremely easy to roll into 50 balls, which I then chilled. Very pretty too! Pressed a roasted almond in the top, dusted with raw sugar, baked for 6 minutes in 350 oven. These are light...not the strongly flavored peanut butter cookies from the old days. Next time I will stick a mini Reeses PB cup in the tops! Very nice base recipe, thanks so much!

I am quite surprised by these cookies. I used butter instead of shortening and only the 1 cup of brown sugar. My homemade almond butter is slightly sweetened, so I didn't think 2 cups of sugar was necessary. These are light in texture and flavor. I also added a few Trader Joe's sliced honey roasted almonds to top each cookie. Initially, I was a little worried because the dough seemed too light and fluffy (not enough flour), but they came out perfect. I used a cookie scoop so I didn't have to get my hands dirty. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
