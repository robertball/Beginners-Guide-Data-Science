This is a fantastic and easy recipe.  I followed others suggestions about increasing olive oil and decreasing salt.  And the sauce this creates is yummy.  I served it with roasted potatoes (olive oil, garlic salt, pepper and a little dried oregano).  As a salad, combined bibb lettuce, toasted almonds, mandarin oranges, red onion, with a blush vinaigrette.  The dinner was devoured and people continued to talk about it the remainder of the evening.

This smelled great as it was cooking, and was very tasty! I used a little more than the 1 teaspoon of olive oil (didn't measure how much more, but probably around 1 teaspoon?) because the mix looked too dry to be easily rubbed onto the pork. Also thought it was a little on the salty side, so next time may use around 1/4 teaspoon of salt instead.

Delicious, easy, cheap and low cal - what more can a girl ask for?  I served it with roasted red peppers and some leftover bowtie pasta with cilantro pesto and that was a perfect balance.

This recipe is a definite keeper, a new favorite at my house. The flavor is bright and smoky...yum!  The pork loins at my store weren't looking too good so I used some thicker cut pork chops and just cut them in half (across the middle) to make "medallions". I also put the cumin/lime mixture(I used 2 limes and had to almost double the rest of the ingredients for 8 medallions) on the pork and let it set an hour or so in the fridge to let the flavor sink into the meat. I used a little EVOO instead of spray in the pan, seared one side of the meat, (one note: you need to be careful your pan is hot enough to sear the meat but not burn your garlic in the lime/cumin mixture). Flipped them and added 4 cloves chopped garlic and the juice of 2 limes, I feel this makes the sauce, otherwise it's just lime juice and the flavor from the pork, the garlic gives it texture and amazing flavor since it mellows being cooked this way. I covered the pan after I added the lime juice because I didn't want it to just boil off before the meat cooked through. Served mine with a package of "bird's eye" roasted potatoes and broccoli in cheese sauce, brown rice (instant cooks in the perfect amount of time for this recipe!) with a can of "southwest" corn, black beans and red pepper. This is a super fast and easy dish with a surprising, different flavor, Thanks to rainyk for submitting! :)

This was an amazing dish.   I never imagined how this combination of flavors would work together.  We did the following:  1.  Added tons of fresh garlic - we are true garlic lovers.  Ten cloves or so, finely diced.  2.  Add just a little black pepper.  The pepper compliments the lime flavor nicely.  3.   Diced the meat into 1" chunks and cooked it at very high heat to get a nice browning.  Too low of heat causes over cooking.  We did use extra olive oil in the pan to encourage browning.  The result was bite sized pork with lime and garlic flavors.  We served it with black beans and rice.  It was amazing!

This was really tasty!  I added quite a bit more olive oil and about 5 cloves of garlic like other reviews mentioned.  Served with rice, carrots and edamame.  Delicious!

Excellent recipe - I followed the suggestion of others and cut back a bit on the salt (used 1/4 tsp) and added more olive oil (close to 1 tbsp).  Also used garlic powder instead of a garlic clove.  Next time I might make more of the seasoning mixture, as it ran a little scarce toward the end. Definitely a keeper!

Good.  I needed a lot more lime juice and zest than the recipe says to use.  There just wasn't enough for the whole tenderloin.  Also, I think it could use just a tad less cumin.

This was great! Easy to make, even for a beginner. I used 5 garlic cloves and a little extra oil, it was still pretty thick. Would like to have more sauce because it was perfect with white rice! I made festival's (a jamacian bread) and mojito's. YUM!

I really did like this recipe, it was for a change different from the regular pork grilling recipes. I couldnt use all of the meat on the day I was grilling , so used it the next.....my god what a difference, the flavor was sooo intense! My suggestion is then let it marinade for as long as ya can! Made Kebobs from the pork.......fantastic!

I've never been a big fan of pork tenderloin for the most part. However, this recipes is so good and so easy that I will never eat pork tenderloin any other way! I have made it twice..once with lemon and once with lime. The lime is a little better but the lemon is quite tasty as well.

Spectacular. That's all I can say. You really should change the picture on this dish. The appearance as shown dose not do the flavor any justice.  for sure a diamond in the rough, this dish has it all. I added a bell pepper medley as a garnish and did not alter the recipe at all. This is one of the best finds ever. I can't say enough about this dish. Thank you so much for your post.

Made this pretty much as written (I admit, I didn't measure exactly, and I doubled the recipe for leftovers) and it was fantastic. The only change I did was to use a swirl of oil in the pan instead of spray because I really hate the smell of the sprays. This was easy, quick, and loved by everyone in the family. I would definitely make this for company, too. Planning to use the leftovers in black bean and pork tacos. This one is a keeper!

Nice zesty flavor. The lime juice and red peppers add a nice touch. I browned my chops and then baked them in the oven with the pan juice (covered with foil) on 350 for 20 minutes. These were awesome.

I didn't really think it was that good (Sorry!). It was kind of bland. I ended up adding corn starch and water mixture to the gravy to thicken it up and lots of salt/pepper and some paprika. We don't be making this again. It sounded like it would be so good….

Made pretty much as is - minor seasoning adjustments (added some Cuban seasoning).  Served with steamed smoked basmati, black beans, and sauteed red, orange, and yellow peppers with zucchini.  Really enjoyed the brightness in the flavors.  Definite make again.

A great recipe, I really enjoyed it.  I tried this with chicken instead of pork (it's what I had) and it turned out quite good.  I increased the amount of olive oil and nixed the salt as a number of other reviewers suggested.  I think I would increase the cumin and garlic a bit next time as well.

This was good the first night. I might have cooked it a bit long. I would have also liked to taste the time a bit more.. I will add more next time.  chopped and reheated the next day and stuffed into a baguette with melted cheese and some lettuce! YUM!

I really liked this dish!   The only change I made was no salt, and I added an extra lime.   My husband is on a low sodium diet, and I've been trying to find things that use spice instead of salt.  this recipe is a keeper

This was quite flavorful and I liked the zest from the lime. I mostly did follow the recipe to a T and I liked the taste very much.  My only tiny addition was the use of 2 garlic cloves vs one. I used thin chops and they cooked ultra fast, like 4 mins per side. I only made 3 chops and I ran out of seasoning after two, I would recommend making twice the amount of seasoning if you are making more than two servings. I served this with fried Plantains... yummy! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I used Center Cut pork chops and pounded them thin. I added a bit more cumin and the red pepper flakes.  It tastes delicious and leave a nice tingle in your mouth.  I will have a sandwich with the leftovers.

My family loved this. I am the hero and it was so easy I should be ashamed. Served with orzo. Perfect recipe although I, like most cooks, don't measure olive oil.

I’m not sure if it’s the recipe or me, but I didn’t like this really at all and I love Cuban food. I felt the pork was chewy (could be me) and the spices weren’t quite there. I will continue my search for good Cuban food.

Big Hit!  This turned out great. I did thin the marinade with extra olive oil, and tossed all the meat together with it. Cook it only 4-5 minutes per side, and let it sit to finish cooking off the heat, and you get gloriously tender chunks of pork.

I thought this would come out bland, but to my surprise a very flavorful and tender pork. Quick and easy to make too! Made recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing. There is no need to marinade the meat. I can definitely see how other reviewers would want to use this as their go to pork recipe! The pork was simply delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

It was so good, I used pork cuts (cubes) instead of the loin and I served with black beans and corn, and rice. Definitely making this again!

We loved this!! Per others' recommendations, I made the following adjustments:
-Increased the olive oil and garlic
-Added freshly ground pepper to the spice mixture
-Cut the tenderloin into bite sized cubes

Once I covered the cubes with the seasoning mixture, I put it in the refrigerator for an hour or so, while I prepped the sides. 

I then cooked it with a bit more oil in a dutch oven. I made sure it was quite warm before I put the pork in, and I cooked for about 8 minutes, total, with the lid on. I flipped the cubes once, about 4 minutes in, before adding the lime juice.

It was so flavorful and tender. I will absolutely be making again.

This dish was beyond excellent.  The instructions prepared this dish perfectly.  I remade using lemon instead of lime to have multiple options.  I have pork tenderloin in the refrigerator to make again.

I made this for my boyfriend, who is Cuban. I don't eat pork that much but the aroma of the cumin, garlic and lime lured me to take a bite. It was delicious. I added the extra olive oil and garlic as suggested so that it would be a really good rub. Unfortunately, my boyfriend boosted the heat  a bit on the stove. I think he was trying to speed up the cooking process since it smelled so good  and he kept seeing me sneak a bite. Anyway, some pork lions became burnt. I caught it just in time so the rest weren't bad off.  He loves it; and I am hooked. Its a simple traditional meal I can make for him.  I am considering grilling this the next time I make it.

Simple, quick, and excellent.  Didn't have lime zest, so we just incorporated the juice into the seasoning mixture to make a "marinade," and the results were thoroughly enjoyable.  Strong work!

Easy, simple to make and a perfect balance of flavors. This is another recipe that seems too simple to be good. It is absolutely fantastic. I did use a little more olive oil and cut the pork up into bite-sized pieces. As a time-saver, I made a douple recipe and put half of the pork and marinade in a ziplock in the freezer. A week later I let it defrost in the fridge overnight and the next day it was just as wonderful as the fresh batch. Thanks for a great recipe!!

We loved it, I did have to improvise with lemon instead but can't wait to make it again and next time with lime!! (Made it for 3 and there wasn't a single bad word about it except I didn't think it would turn out as good as it did.) thank you for sharing your recipe!

This has become a regular at our house! We make the marinade as is with boneless pork chops. You might have to change the time, depending on the thickness of the meat, but it should be pretty self explanatory. What I wouldn't do is set the timer for each side of meat, but rather sit there and watch it. 
The pan juice is phenomenal. 
We serve with tostones and a rice/beans mixture. Pop on some traditional Cuban music on Pandora and you have an extra-great meal!

What great flavor! I was a bit skeptical about the lime zest, but oh my, I found myself looking for more to eat with my pork. While it takes a bit of time to prep (zesting the lime), it cooks up very quickly. I did increase the garlic and EVOO and will probably increase all seasoning next time...and there WILL be a next time soon!

This turned out amazing. The only change I made was that I marinated the steak for about 45 minutes in the zest, oil, cumin and added garlic, salt and pepper. Then went I went to cook it I sautéed a little onion along with the steak. It was very tender and flavorful and made the whole family happy.

5 Stars for flavor, and how easy it was! Such a small amount of ingredients that most people usually have on hand. If not cheap enough to buy. I paired it with a black bean and corn salad from this site. Fantiastic.
