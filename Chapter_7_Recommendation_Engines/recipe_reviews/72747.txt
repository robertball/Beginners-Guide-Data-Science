If you use 1/4 cup of the flour in this recipe and coat the blueberries before you put them in cake batter, the blueberries will not sink to the bottom.

This cake was fabulous!  I made the changes suggested by the previous reviewers (using lemon juice instead of extract and flouring the blueberries).  I also used frozen blueberries (I allowed them to thaw first).  Also instead of flouring the bundt pan, I sugared it--it makes a nice crunchy, sweet outer-layer.  Then I used the leftover lemon juice to make a lemon icing.  YUM!  My dinner guest left with a copy of the recipie.

Excellent recipe! A few changes I made were to use "buttermilk" instead of regular milk by mixing 3/4c milk with 1/4c lemon juice. I added 1T vanilla, and increased the lemon zest to the zest of 3 lemons. I glazed it with 1/3c lemon juice mixed with 1/2c sugar by immediately poking holes in the bottom of the cake while it was in the pan after baking, then brushing glaze as well on the top after removing it from the pan. Outstanding cake!!!

I love pound cake, and I have tried a bunch of recipes...this one makes a beautiful cake.  The cake rose right to the top edge of the tube pan, but I did have to let it bake about 20 minutes longer than specified, so be sure you test it with a wooden skewer before assuming it's done.  I followed the recipe as written with only a few minor changes: added one teaspoon vanilla extract in addition to the lemon flavoring, didn't measure the lemon zest - just used the zest of one large lemon, and added about a cup of diced fresh cherries I had and needed to use. I tossed the fruit with flour, and this kept them distributed throughout the cake without sinking.  The cake has a wonderful flavor and texture, and is easy to prepare.  This is a good basic pound cake recipe, and you could experiment with other extracts and berries.  I'm adding this to my pound cake repetoire!

Wonderful pound cake!  I've made this twice and found that there's too much batter for a regular 10" bundt pan so I leave almost 2 inches to spare for the cake to rise in the oven.  The extra batter made two 3 x 5 loaves in addition to the cake.  I used the juice of 2 lemons which I deducted from the amt. of milk used.  Used zest of both lemons as well.  Topped it with cream cheese and lemon frosting.  Be sure to coat the blueberries with a couple tsps. of flour so they don't sink.

My family and I thought this cake was delicious! Moist, fragrant, and tasty...MMMM. We served it warm with a small scoop of ice cream and homemade strawberry topping. I cut the rest of the cake into portions, wrapped each piece in plastic wrap (then stored in a ziploc in the freezer), and then reheated when I wanted a piece...again served warm (reheated in the convection oven) with a dollop of ice cream and strawberry topping. I also coated the blueberries with 1/4 cup flour and my blueberries did NOT sink. Like other reviewers, I used fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of extract, and I think I even used a little more zest than called for. The lemon flavor was mild, but definitely yummy. As always, I used all organic ingredients. Great recipe! We enjoyed it. Thanks LDYBRD (Ladybird, is it?).

Yum!!!  This cake was delicious!  I made this for our Easter Dinner and everyone thought it was very good.  The initial making of the cake was more than easy- it was literally a "piece of cake"  It took only about 20 minutes and then into the oven the cake went.  As previous reviewers did, I coated the blueberries in a little bit of flour to prevent them from sinking and it worked like a charm- the blueberries were evenly spread throughout the cake and none sank.  I then, once it cooled, spread a basic icing with a tint of lemon flavor on the top of the cake and it was delicious-  It had a light lemon flavor and the blueberries were simply magnificent.  Everyone raved and this recipe will most definitely be made again.  Thanks!

Great cake and right amount of moistness.  I like my lemon desserts really lemony so I used the zest of two lemons.  I floured the blueberries as another reviewer also suggested.  I added a little salt since I use unsalted butter..  I added a lemon glaze as well.  With all these little adjustments this cake would warrent 5 stars!

This is pretty good. Everyone I served it too LOVED it. I had to cook it about 20 min. longer than recipe called for and I added some extra lemon.  I really like lemon.

Wonderful pound cake recipe … just the way a pound cake should taste!  Not too sweet and yes, it’s heavy because it calls for all that butter; and isn’t pound cake supposed to be on the heavy side anyway?  I added more lemon juice than it called for to give it more of a zesty lemon zing – yum!  Family definitely LOVED this and will absolutely make again!!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because I know it's a good recipe! It's baking right now....but, you might want to add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla, it really enhances the flavor.

NOTE, this makes A LOT of batter! - I mean A LOT!!! I had the entire bunt cake pan full along with a small loaf pan. If you use a decorative cake pan like the one shown in the pict, you might need all that batter. If you are using a basic bunt/round cake pan, you might want to customize the recipe to 12 servings. That being said, I plan to place the small loaf in the freezer for a later date - so no problem!! something to look forward to later.

I've made the recipe twice now.  Once in a 10" bundt pan and once with 2 loaf pans.  Both times I needed to cook for 90 minutes.  Great recipe, will make again, but will add more lemon as I thought it was very subtle as per the recipe.

Yow wow!  This rocked!  Served for Easter dessert and leftovers were served again with the coffee cakes the next morning.  In addition to the lemon extract, I added about 1/4 c. fresh lemon juice plus extra zest.  I coated the blueberries with flour so they wouldn't sink.  That worked nicely.  There was too much batter for my stoneware bundt pan, so I was able to bake a smaller cake too.  It was far too jiggly after 60 minutes, but perfect at 80 minutes in the oven.  I combined juice and zest from one lemon with enough icing sugar to make a fairly runny glaze, which I drizzled over the finished cake.  The end result was nicely dense, just the way pound cake should be.  Will be making this one again, no question!

I have tried countless pound cake recipes and actually have a very good butter pound cake.  I needed to use up some bluberries so I thought I would try this.  However, this cake came out very greasy and gummy like for me.  I don't know...I will not make again.  I will stick to my tried and true and just add blueberries next time.

I added 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice in addition to the lemon extract and lemon rind.  I topped the cake with Lemon Glaze after it had cooled: 1/2 c lemon juice, 1 tsp lemon peel (or extract) and 1 1/2 c powdered sugar.  This recipe made more batter thank my bundt pan could contain, so I also made mini bundts which only required 30 minutes bake time. I am not a fan of pound cake, but this got rave reviews from other eaters.

Made this for a dinner party and it turned out great! Only modifications I made were adding a teaspoon of real vanilla, zesting two lemons and using their juice nd adding a teaspoon of lemon extract. I still thought it could have used a little more lemon punch, so next time I'll probably zest and juice a third lemon. But great recipe, and perfect year-round.

This cake was DELICIOUS! I baked it in a regular bundt pan with no problem. After it cooled I poured a glaze on it as well made of confectioner's sugar, lemon zest, and enough milk to give it the right consistency.

This recipe is just delicious! I found it to be very moist, I did tweek it a little adding about half cup of sour cream and lemon juice from half of the lemon I used, I also added pure vanilla. It turned out great! I had enough batter to fill a loaf pan as well. Next time I would add a few extra blueberries, there weren't enough for my liking, but other than that, it was delicious!!

This recipe reminds me of one my great grandmother made when I was very young. It is a nice heavy, moist, and flavorful pound cake. Very rich, and very tasty. I added a bit of the seeds from the vanilla bean, which intensified the flavors. Wonderful recipe - thank you for sharing.

This was beyond refreshing. Used hints from others and coated blueberries with flour so they wouldn't sink. I also used lemon juice instead of lemon extract, probably adding half again as much as called for in the recipe. The cake took 15-20 minutes longer to cook than the recipe says. This was a perfect cake for paring with a lemon cream sauce pasta and dry champagne for a special, elegant occasion. We skipped a glaze and covered the cake slices with homemade whipped cream.

I'm rating this in the middle until I can remake the recipe.  First off, the recipe batter is DELICIOUS.  Problem is that the amount far exceeded my 10" pan...and I should have known better and split the batter between 2 pans, but I was in a rush and now I've got smoke alarms going off in my house!  Most of the batter oozed on the oven floor and I'm running around venting the house. 

Also, because there is a higher-than-normal amount of sugar in this recipe, the top browned much quicker than in other cake recipes.  

I would give this 5 stars (as I was eating the batter!) for potential...but will have to try it again and make two cakes.

followed directions as written; however, added two tsp of lemon juice to mix and create a lemon juice/powder sugar glaze for the top.  It cooked 20 minutes longer than recommended.

I made this cake without the milk, but had to adjust the bake time to 1hour 30min. but it turned out BEAUTIFUL and DELICIOUS with a lemon glaze of powdered sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and milk, and garnish of blueberries and lemon slices. I'm making it again tonight!

Needed a glaze of water, lemon juice, and powdered sugar to bring it to life (hence 4 out of 5 stars), but everyone raved about the final product.   Frozen floured blueberries were great in this, though it made about a cup and a half too much batter for my bundt pan!

Amazing Amazing Amazing! Perfect Perfect Perfect!  I never follow instructions to the tee - I don't sift flour or measure anything very accurately, however I did coat the blueberries in flour, and used Limes instead of Lemons (lots, but still not enough we found) and stirred everything by hand with a good old-fashioned wooden spoon.  We cooked it an extra 10 minutes and it came out of the oven bouncy and fluffy with a crisp top - perfect perfect perfect!

I don't know if this always happens but I had soo much cake batter I filled a whole bundt pan and I had about 9 HUGE cupcakes, so far we've only tasted the cupcakes but they are delicious, I have a convection oven and not really thinking I did as the recipe said and set the oven at 350 I should have set it at 325 instead so the outsides where very crisp and well done... but other then that great! (I added vanilla and extra lemon zest)

We loved this!  Made cake as directed - no changes.  It’s rich  with a buttery flavor and very dense.  Makes a huge cake.  Very flavorful.  Made my own glaze with just powdered sugar and fresh squeezed lemon juice.  The tang was great with the richness of the cake.  Would definitely make again!

I made this according to the comments with lemon juice and topped it off with a lemon glaze. My family and friends didn't have enough great things to say and my sister asked me to make this cake for her birthday. I will absolutely be making this cake again.

The recipe called for 2 cups of butter (4 sticks). The pound cake cane out of the oven and it was uncooked! It was still dough and was as heavy as a rock. I guess that is why they call it pound cake. Try using less butter if you want to make this recipe.

First of all, this made a ridiculously huge amount of batter - it filled my 10 inch bundt pan and then rose another two inches above the rim during cooking.  Because there was so much the top burned before it was cooked through.  After an hour I turned down the oven, gave it another 7-8 minutes and then it was cooked but I had to trim off the burned top before I inverted it.  I agree with others that said it was a little greasy from all the butter.  Even my husband who will eat almost any dessert didn't care for it and we ended up giving the cake to my daughter to bring in to her workplace!  Will not be doing this one again....

This is a great recipe! I didn't have a bunt pan and from other reviewers mentioning it over flowed I baked it in a large spring form pan. Per other reviews I added more lemon zest, lemon juice and approx 1 T of vanilla. I also used 1C of buttermilk instead of regular milk. I coated the blueberries in flour as well, which made a difference. I made a lemon juice and powdered sugar glaze and spread it over the top as it cooled. I did have to bake it an extra 25 minutes at 325, as it got brown fast, but the toothpick wasn't coming out clean. Hubby enjoyed it so I call it a win. Will def make it again.

This is the best poundcake recipe I've come across. The result is a soft, moist, fine crumb with balanced buttery and sugar flavor. Really the perfect poundcake, in my opinion. I halved the recipe, as the full amount would have been too much for my bundt pan. I added a tsp of vanilla extract, and made a lemon glaze to really punch up the lemon flavor, which I found too subtle in the original recipe. I also coated the berries in flour. But I think the magic of this recipe is the ratio of ingredients, and/or technique to get the best cake texture or cake flavor--the fruit flavor you can always tweak or change.

I made changes to make it healthier. Instead of white flour I used 2 cups whole wheat & 2 cups brown rice flour.  I only used 1 cup sugar & substituted the other 2 cups for 'Stevia in the Raw' which is zero sugars but natural. I followed advice to coat blueberries in a 1/4 cup of the flour & it worked great to not have blueberries sink to bottom! I didn't use fresh blueberries but thawed out some frozen ones & it's perfect.I didn't use any glazes or icing, it is perfect as is! I don't live in high altitude but I'm in Austin Tx, yet it wasn't done after an hour. So I put foil on top top prevent burning & baked another 20 minutes on 325 degrees fahrenheit & it turned out perfect! Will definitely make this again!

Well, it came out looking beautiful, but doesn't taste anything like a pound cake. Tasty, but definitely not a pound cake.  The key to this is really knowing how to cream the butter, and sugar the right way.

Good flavor, but came out greasy and undercooked, yet VERY crispy at edges.  Next time I will cook at 325 for about 90 minutes.  I may cut back a little on the butter.

In defense of the cake, I did not have lemon zest so I bumped up the lemon juice (not extract) by a teaspoon. I did coat the blueberries also-great tip. I still felt like this was a pretty bland cake. Pretty and moist but no zip. I did nake a lemon glaze to go over it. Glaze - 1/3 cup melted butter, add 4 tbsp lemon juice and 2 cups powdered sugar stir and pour over cake. Good but probably not going to make again.

Recipe was perfect. I used two cups of coconut milk instead of regular. I used lemon juice and zest from large lemon. Next time I’ll increase the lemon juice and zest to 2 large lemons. I got three loafs out of the batter.

well, pound cake is supposed to use a pound of butter!  So I cut recipe in half, put it in a bread pan (the way it is traditionally made), eliminated lemon extract, and spooned in some blueberry jam... sort of swirled it in.  Turned out pretty good.  Liked all the hints about room temperature, etc.  really helpful and made a big difference in the texture of the batter.

This is buttery deliciousness that has wonderful flavor and texture.  The reason I am giving this four stars is because this recipe make too much batter for the required pan.  You would need 3/4 of the amount.  I used the extra in another small bundt pan to use up the excess.  To prevent the blueberries from sinking, take some of the flour and dust the blueberries before adding them to the batter.

The cake was delicious however with the moisture from the fresh blueberries it needed to bake an extra 15 minutes. I added a lemon glaze confectioners sugar and fresh lemon juice.

I followed the recipe exactly , turned out okay. I will not make this again. The pound cake came out way to soft / greasy. Most likely because of the milk. I thought the batter looked perfect until I added all that liquid. Pound cake is supposed to be dense. This was like a regular cake texture. And bc of all the milk it lost some of the lemon flavor and sweetness. The other blueberry pound cake recipe on here is amazing I will go back to that.

I used fresh lemon juice and floured my blueberries as someone mentioned. I iced the cake with fresh lemon juice and powdered sugar icing with some sprinkles. I added berries around the rim of the plate as well.

Batter is delicious but too much volume for one bundt pan. After 1 hour it was not cooked but over browning on top so I covered with foil and added 30 minutes. Still not done in middle and has spilled over.  :-{  Not impressed!

This cake is delicious. My friend, Melissa, and I picked blueberries on Door Mountain in Acadia National Park. I used them in this recipe. I made a 1/2 recipe and baked it in a loaf pan for 65 minutes. Topped it with confectionary sugar icing and we couldn't get enough. Fantastic results. Great recipe.

Excellent cake but entirely too much batter for a 10' bundt cake.  Baking time is more like 1hour and 20 minutes but this is a keeper after modifications.

Used a combination of blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. Didn't have lemon extract; used vanilla, and the grated rind of a whole lemon. It took 1 hour 20 minutes to bake, and 15 minutes to cool before removing from the pan. I will make this again. Delicious!

I made this using gluten free Cup 4 Cup flour, it was delicious and not too sweet. The cake was moist and I only replaced the flour  with gluten free flour and the lemon extract with real lemon juice. My daughter and I had fun making the cake and the entire family enjoyed with some vanilla ice cream. Simple and fun!

I made a few changes. I used the juice of three lemons instead of the lemon extract and I used all the rind from the lemons. I also mixed the berries with about a 1/4 cup of flour so they didn't sink.  I used about a teaspoon of vanilla.  I fit all of the batter in a regular bundt pan and I baked it for 90 minutes. I used a dark pan so I baked it at 325 degrees. Everyone loved it and I had to give out the recipe already! I will definitely be making again.

Followed it to the letter.  It makes too much batter, as others have noted.  I should have taken some out and made a second loaf pan.  It also needed to cook longer than an hour.  Probably would have been fine if I had reduced the batter.

pretty good! I didn't change anything because I like to try things as they're written and adjust it to my taste after ... a bit too lemony for my liking, but it baked up nice and came out moist! I also had to bake an additional 10 minutes.

I read some of the comments and adjusted the recipe accordingly.  Adding extra lemon to the batter and increasing the baking time helped make a wonderful cake.

This was a really good pound cake. I received many compliments on it. I did add 1 more teaspoon of lemon extract to make it a bit more "lemony". It took an hour and 20 minutes to completely cook, and then the top was a bit too done. I used the Lemon Icing from this site, but tweaked it, adding more lemon juice and using less confectioner's sugar so that it was thinner and more like a glaze than an icing. I filled the center with blueberries and scatered them over the top along with some strawberries dipped in white chocolate that I flavord with lemon too.

I had some blueberries that I wanted to use so I decided to try this recipe. I am only giving it 3 stars b/c the cake stuck to the bottom of the pan and was very dense. I only used four  eggs but I doubt two more would have made a difference. We have been eating it for breakfast as it tastes more like a muffin , than cake.

This recipe was overall a good recipe.  I found the batter was to sticky for my liking, so I added 1 cup of milk to lighten it up a bit. I also used lemon juice instead of extract.  I used this recipe for my Easter dinner and it was a hit.  I will definatly make it again. My kids ate the left overs for breakfast.

I think the cake was pretty good.  It just didn't seem sweet enough or something seemed like it was missing.   It was moist but not real moist.  It makes a really heavy cake.  I did as  suggested and beat the batter by hand while adding the flour, etc. I don't think my mixing bowl would have been large enough if I hadn't.
All in all it was okay but I don't think I would make it again.
