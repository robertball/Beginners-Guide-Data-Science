This is almost the same recipe my grandmother always used, except she did not add the vanilla or spices. They add a very nice touch to a classic dessert. I also use peaches in heavy syrup and do not drain them. So easy to throw together. I have also substituted two cans of mixed fruit in the place of the peaches and that is awesome as well.

This was sooo easy! I've made it twice so far, alternating the second time with hommade canned bing cherries. We all loved it with vanilla ice cream.

I doubled this recipe and put it in a 13x9 pan (which was borderline too small).  It took quite a bit longer to bake (probably an additional 20 minutes.  It was simple to make and had good flavor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I didn't have enough peaches so I put some old mangoes in as well.  It was still delicious!
