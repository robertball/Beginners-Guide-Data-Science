We had two .75 lbs tenderloins. Kept them in foil 10 minutes and barbecued for 4 minutes a side. (We like them medium rare, some pink showing). They came out excellent. Our family has another favorite pork tenderloin recipe, but this one may take over. Juicy and tender.

For this recipe, I used a one pound tenderloin. I kept all the measurements the same. I poured the spices in a ziplock bag with the pork and shook. Then I put the bag in the refrigerator for an hour. To cook, I poured in the oil and set the burner at medium-high. I seared the tenderloin and then poured in the glaze (keep some for your plate). Unfortunately, the medium-high temperature immediately boiled it, so I rolled the pork in the glaze before it evaporated or burned. I turned the heat down to medium and covered. I continued to turn my tenderloin every few minutes. It took about 30 minutes before my thermometer read 145°.  The seasoning had good flavor.
