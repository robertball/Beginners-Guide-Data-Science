I decided to try this recipe using some of my home grown tomatoes from my garden, peeling and smushing them up, about 2 cups worth. (I'm drowning in tomatoes!) I used it with a batch of homemade Rigatoni noodles made with my pasta maker. It was FABULOUS! So quick and easy! It's got the ease of a hamburger helper meal with the yummy factor of home style cookin!

I would add a large chopped onion to this recipe(for onion lovers) It would have a tastier flavor!

I sauteed some fresh minced garlic and a whole diced onion that I sauteed in a little EVOO with the mushrooms before adding the rest of the ingredients. After tasting it, I did add in some homemade italian seasoning. More sauce-y than meat-y. Probably not something I'd make again but good in a pinch.

Added diced onion and garlic with the meat as I browned it.  For my personal bowl I added crushed red pepper flakes.  Subbed the ground beef for Johnsonville Mild Italian sausage and the flavor really popped!
