I thought these were very good - and when I brought them to work to share, my co-workers LOVED them (= The common comment was that they were not too sweet. I used white whole wheat, and coconut milk [beverage], and Sugar in the Raw, also sprinkling a little of the sugar over the tops before baking. I do think that they would be good with chopped pecans or some golden raisins added, too. I got 15 regular sized muffins out of this recipe . . .

My 5 year old requested carrot muffins so I made these. I followed the directions  to the letter and smelled/tasted the batter before baking. It didn't have quite the same spice profile I am used with carrot cake so I added 1/2 tsp of allspice to the wet batter. Otherwise I didn't change a thing.

They turned out great, will make again.

An excellent recipe, easy and  tasty. I doubled the carrot, and added raisins and nutmeg, and it actually made 22 muffins, not 12

I did change it a bit. Used 1/2 c oil instead of butter just like most other muffin recipes. I added 1c raisins and 1c walnuts. Was a big hit!!

Giving this 5 stars, but I did alter the recipe as other commenters had suggested.  I doubled the cinnamon, added 1.5 tsp of nutmeg and used oil rather than butter (only because I didn't have unsalted and that was an easier substitution than figuring out how much salt to omit!).  I also did the brown sugar and cinnamon sprinkle on top.
First time making carrot cake of any kind and it turned out great!!

These were ok but more like just a plain carrot muffin. Not really like a carrot cake. Needs raisins and walnuts. I'll try a different recipe next time.

Just made them. Smelled heavenly so I decided to sample fresh out of the oven.... Super disappointed, the muffins are very bland. Time to try a different recipe.

These are bland. They have potential though. I'd try them again and make some flavor adjustments. Maybe double the cinnamon and some other complaining spices. I think I'm going to do a icing drizzle like on a cinnamon roll. Fingers crossed.

I just made these this morning, and they were awesome!  I did some substituting though, mostly out of necessity.  I was almost out of all purpose flour so I used some whole wheat pastry flour that's been sitting here since Valentines' day, and since the only milk we had was skim I used half a cup of that, and half a cup of whipping cream.  They turned out fantastic!

Will definitely make this again since it was a hit with my family. Didn't add any applesauce and cinnamon but I did add raisins and it came out moist and not too sweet with a lovely taste from the raisins.

A bit disappointed. They turned out very dense and didn't rise much at all (I even checked my baking powder to see if it was fresh).  I'll keep my old one.

A winner all around! Even my children who do not like carrots said they were good! I’ve made them several times now as they are such a hit! I do not make the icing though I’m SURE it’s good with it! We eat them more like a muffin haha I do have to substitute for the egg and dairy because of family food allergies but the recipe holds to its standard! One for the books for sure!!!

I thought these were wonderful! My family really enjoyed! I appreciated that it doesn't have nuts since my daughter is allergic to them. I ended up feeling really froggy and did home made apple sauce too. I added FRESH toasted coconut to the top that we shredded from an actual coconut! AND....no joke, the carrots were from our garden! I felt like I understood why women stayed in the kitchen back in the day. It must have been tough, but what  a labor of love it was. Is this a normal behavior for me? Heck no, I have a life! But it felt good to be Martha Stewart for the morning. Great recipe!

Made them for my little man. He loved them. I rather make stuff from scratch out of the ingredients I know where they came from.

Turned out great - didn’t change anything.  They are much less dense and more moist then some carrot cake muffin recipes I have tried.  I added this recipe to my favorites list.

We loved these muffins. Used vegetable oil instead of butter. Also added walnuts and raisins  Took them to our adult Sunday School class. They were a real hit. We will make them again soon.

The kids and I made this as a whim during a cold, rainy afternoon.  We used chunky apple sauce and and added a bit more of the carrot, so it has a nice texture.  A straightforward recipe with delicious results! It's been the highlight of our day!

I used the pulp from the juicer (apple,carrot ,celery),  substituted half the sugar for splenda, cut the butter by a third, and added some nutmeg and a little anise seed .  I also replaced a small amount of the flour for a ground bran flax mix.  they came out moist and sweet.

Very moist, dense and delicious! I added 1/2 cup of oatmeal so it would be more of a muffin. Really good overall but I feel like something is missing.
