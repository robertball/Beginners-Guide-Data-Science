This was easy to make and people at the office enjoyed it. Not too sweet but just right, more like a brownie with a layer of crunchy sweet pecans on top.

This was easy and good, but not as good as other pecan pie bars I've tried.

I was disappointed. The bottom crust was way too dry.

I made these, following the recipe with the exception of subbing walnuts that I had on hand for the pecans.  The topping was fine, but the base, it just wasn't good.  I was going to follow my gut and use a smaller pan and increase bake time.  If I do make these again I will do that.

Fantastic recipe!  I add a dash of cinnamon to the bottom and some bourbon and powdered tahitian vanilla to the top. Yummy.

Really easy to make (maybe easier than my favourite fudge brownie recipe), tastes like a pie! I used 4/5 of quantity of pecans suggested by recipe, and added milk chocolate chips. Great!

No changes. Let the top brown and the bars came out really dry. I wanted to make chocolate pecan pie as finger food for a party, but I was disappointed. Not sure I'll make it again.
