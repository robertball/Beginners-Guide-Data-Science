This is my recipe, but I noticed the All Recipes people changed it a bit. To let you all know who want to try it I used German salami which is spicy. I also did not put the salami on top of the chicken I put it on top of the sauce. If you want a really spicy pizza sometimes I will put a hint of the jerk sauce in the pizza sauce as well.

This was good!!!.  I made my own dough, used the exquisite pizza sauce fr this site.  I omitted mushrooms and salami but added pinapples, bacon and cheddard cheese on top of the mozorella. It came out tasteful.

This was so good.  I couldn't find jerk sauce so used jerk seasoning instead.  I also replaced the salami with bacon.  This is a nice change to your typical pizza recipe.

This was great! And easy to make, too.  The only change I made was using already cooked chicken breast.

This was pretty good! I didn't have much time in the kitchen so I didn't roast and peel the green pepper, and I also used canned chicken breast meat. While the pizza was very tasty, it wasn't as jerk-y as I expected. If I made this again, I would probably use dry Jerk seasoning rather than sauce. Anyway, this was nice for a change. Thanks, Aimee!

This is a very good recipe and a great change from the norm.  I don't think that the step with broiling the bell peppers is really needed and adds more work to a recipe that already requires significant prep.  Great variety of flavors though!

I add cumin, cilantro, lime juice and coriander to the sauce and add mango and red onion to the toppings.
