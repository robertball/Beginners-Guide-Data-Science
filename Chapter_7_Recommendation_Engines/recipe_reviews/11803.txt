Karen - Thank you for a GREAT recipe!!! All I did was double the sauce like others suggested, and I had a flavorful, lasagna with an excellent creamy sauce. What a keeper! Just make sure you season your chicken well before adding to recipe. I just bake mine with a little fresh ground pepper, poultry seasoning, garlic salt and cracked red pepper before baking. I will make this again and again! (No boil lasagna noodles work great with this and cut the work down!)

I have made this several times and everyone just loves it.  I have added in a layer of spinach a couple times just to sneak in a good veggie.  But its great either way.  Freezes well.  Using the 'no-boil' lasagna noodles makes it even easier.  I like to use a bit more cheese too.

I really liked this recipe.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese though, and I used 2 cans of the soup.  Plus I think I used more cheese than it called for.  It was really good.  I made it in 2 8x8 pans and then baked one to eat right away and just put the other one in the freezer to eat later.  When I was ready to eat it, I defrosted it in the fridge overnight and then baked it; it reheated really well!

Great recipe - although - I only used 9 lasagna noodles rather than 18 - I would think you would need to double the rest of the ingrediants to use 18.  My family loved it, thought it was delicious.

This recipe was delicious.  Of course, I'm the type of chef who loves to alter recipes just a touch so I used less lasagna noodles and substituted mozzarella cheese.  It would be great any way you do it.

I thought that this was a great one! Made it for my monthly dinner with the girls and they just loved it. The only thing that I changed was there was not enough liquid. I ened up putting about 1.5 cups of milk.

This recipe is excellent. I do suggest doubling the sauce, simply because it is delicious. We tend to like our food spicy so I add some crushed red peppers to the sauce for a nice bite. My husband dislikes chicken, but eats this up!! Very pretty presentation also, great colors.

Good ideas to work from - can only use 9 noodles, must increase liquid, needs some kind of flavor twist. I cooked two frozen breasts in a little broth for chicken which was plenty, added the broth to sauce, about half cup. I used some leftover evaporated milk and whole milk, total about 1 cup. Wasn't sure about the cottage cheese, but mooshed it a little with a fork and then combined with other cheeses - I cut down on the cheddar and used some italian mix. Seemed easier than traditional lasagna somehow, but probably the same amount of work. My husband liked it, but not the kids, though they don't like much.

This has become a favorite in my house.  Great to use up leftover chicken.  I do add layer of spinach.  Even better the next day.  Definately a keeper and one that I cook at least 2-3 times a month

I gave this a three, because it needed tweaking before it was okay... the noodles were too much and it didn't taste very good. So I tried it again Since there's only two of us in my house, I cut the noodles in half, and that made it taste alright. I ate it, and my husband did alright. But no one wanted seconds (which is rare in my house!) So this recipe was just so-so

I have been using this recipe for many years for a great entertaining recipe--I always find it too dry though and frequently double the sauce...especially if you use ricotta instead of cottage cheese (which I do).

The minute I found this recipe I was already making a grocery list.  Although it sounded great I didn't particularly enjoy this.  I made a small pan as I live alone and it was very hard to finish!  I won't be making this again simply because I don't know how to improve it to fit my tastes.

It was delicious, but I think the soup mixture needs to be doubled. I don't think there was hardly enough.

Not wonderful... not bad though!  I subsituted mozarella for cheddar just because I thought it made more sense...  I also doubled the sauce.  With extra noodles and filling I made lasagna roll ups which is a quick and easy alternative.  Think next time I would kick it up with some fresh herbs or white pepper.

This is similar in flavor to a chicken lasagna that my mom makes- which has always been a favorite of mine. This recipe, however, is less soupy and the veggies are bigger and more flavorful.

I liked this, but did change it up a little...instead of peppers I used spinach, and used a jar of Alfredo sauce instead of the soup.  The kids loved this white chicken lasagna!
