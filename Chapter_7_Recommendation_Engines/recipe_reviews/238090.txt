Okay, this is so healthy and I really wanted to love it...but when the description says 'dense', believe it!  I sliced it about 1/8" thick in hopes of making crackers, but they were just too hard.  On the bright side, my dogs go gaga over the 'crackers' for treats, so it wasn't a total waste of sublime ingredients :)  I am very health conscious when it comes to my pooches as well so I do feel good about giving this to them.  However I don't think I would make it again just for them due to the expense of the ingredients.
