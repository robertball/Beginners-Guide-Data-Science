It was delicious... nothing left over.  Very rich, but not too heavy.  Substantial meal.  Served with roasted veggies (brussel sprouts, carrots, red potatoes) and every plate was cleaned!

Question for experienced cooks (which I am not) -- can you do anything with the sauce that is left?  It was so good, I kept it but I don't know what to do with it!  Thanks...

Truly fall off the bone.  I pretty much stuck to the recipe.  I used dried rosemary and flour instead of corn starch.  I made the “slurry” in a bit of the beef broth and not water. Oh yeah, I used white wine.  I did not have any red on hand.
