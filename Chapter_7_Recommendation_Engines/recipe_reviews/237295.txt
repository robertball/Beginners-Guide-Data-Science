The recipe is calibrated well. I made a half batch and got three 1/4 cup measurements of batter. The batter was thin enough to slightly swirl around the pan. It is important to let it sit for those 10 minutes. The taste was ok, if you like coconut flour, you will enjoy the taste of this crepe. They don't roll well and they are a bit tricky to flip. Follow the instructions on flipping, make sure they are completely cooked on one side or you'll get pieces. They also have a texture that is not like a true crepe, it's not chewy but dry. Next time I will add an extra egg or as another reviewer states, start off with a smaller amount of coconut flour and work from there. Another alternative could be an addition of fat to the recipe. I noticed this recipe doesn't call for any fat in the batter, this may be a solution for the next time to add either coconut oil or olive oil directly into the batter.  Thank you kmacphee for sharing this recipe.

I was sitting at home just longing for crepes, but i had only coconut flour at home. I was excited to find this recipe, but  in the end was disappointed.  The batter was much too soft and hard to flip. I was only able to get about 3 crepes out of the pan successfully. those that i did eat i smothered in toppings because they had an extremely bitter aftertaste. I couldn't finish eating the crepes, I would not make this again.

This recipe did not work at all. The batter consistency seemed OK but it did not hold up when trying to take it off the griddle pan. I left it on longer to get it to dry out, but it burnt on the bottom. I tasted a piece of it once it cooked and it was OK in flavor. I am wondering if the batter should sit for awhile before making?

I needed a crepe recipe with coconut flour...quick! This was just what I needed. In my experience, you need a much smaller amount I coconut flour than regular flour, and my traditional crepe recipe would have had this same amount. They didn't roll well, and needed extra spreading, so next time I am going to try 1 tbsp coconut flour, then move up from there if it seems to need more.

The recipe is easy to follow. This my first experience and will likely make these crepes again.

The batter was way too thick to spread around as Crepes. More like pancakes, the flavor was ok but I'm not a fan of the texture.
