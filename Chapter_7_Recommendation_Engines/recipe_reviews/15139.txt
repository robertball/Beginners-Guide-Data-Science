Wow, good old fashioned comfort dessert at its finest! And who would have ever thought something so down home good could be so easy and quick to throw together? Knowing I'm repeating many tips already suggested, this is what I found worked well: Add 1/4 tsp vanilla and a little cinnamon to the batter, bake in an 8" square pan or equivalent sized baking dish,cut butter down to 6 tablespoons, and sprinkle with sugar during the last 15 minutes of baking. Have fun with your favorite flavors of pie filling - all work well. Mmmmmmmmm, grandmas always were the best bakers, yours included, Jan!

Very good and simple, but I'm giving it 4 stars because as written it would have been under a puddle of butter.  1/4
c. was plenty, and I added cinnamon to the batter. I have tried it with blueberry pie filling and cherry and they were both very good. Cut the sugar back to 3/4 c. and you will never miss it. I also baked in a round casserole dish instead of the 13x9" pan which would have been *very* thin.

HOLY MELTED BUTTER BATMAN! I give this recipe five stars, but only if the following amendments are made.  First, use a 4 or 6 quart round baking dish, not a 9x13 pan.  Next, cut the amount of butter down to 1/4 of a cup or less.  Using 1/4 of a cup of butter you will still get pools of melted butter on the top of the cobbler when you are done.  No worries though!  Simply spoon the butter onto the biscuits that have formed around the edges of the pan.  Make these changes and I think you will like this recipe.

I made quite a few changes to this, following some of the others recommendations, and it still needed more work than what I did. It was a good starting point I guess, but if prepared as specified, I think I would have been VERY unhappy with the results. first, I halved the butter called for, and found it to still be too much. I cut back on the sugar and it was still a little too sweet (and I used fresh cherries so no added sugar there). Putting it in a 9x9 was absolutely necessary; it would have been pancake thin in a 9x13. I added a healthy dash of cinnamon and allspice to the batter and it was very nice; I think if I hadn't done this it would have been pretty bland. So... this recipe can be a success only if you follow everyone else's advice about it. as is, no way.

I read everyone else's reviews and I took a little from each one.  I used 2 tablespoons of butter, which (to me) was enough because the butter didn't gather in the middle.  I also used 2 cups of cherries, but I think it could of used just a little more, maybe a half of a cup more.  I didn't add more because I didn't have it at the time.  Before I put it in the oven I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon and a little bit of sugar on top, which made it taste great.  I also put it in an 8X8 pan.  If I decide to double it, it will go in a 13X9 pan.  Overall, my husband and I enjoyed it.  Very easy and quick to make.

I, too, had this recipe handed down to me from my grandmother and mother, but I lost it when I moved a few years back. I was really thrilled to see it posted here. It is WONDERFUL when you substitute fresh peaches that have had sugar, butter and a lot of cinnamon added to it and heated to boiling. You pour that over the batter and it makes an almost lacy topping when it rises to the top. This is so delicious that a friend's son had me make this for almost 100 people for the dinner the groom's family hosts after they do the wedding rehersal. I can only say it was easy to make and when served in martini glasses with a dollop of whipped topping it was elegant as well as delicious. Everyone should try this recipe with their favorite fruit. The fruits and berries in the grocer's frozen food case makes this a sinfully simple dessert that is sure to be a sensation after any meal. I should say that peaches are the only fruit you add cinnamon to, with everything else I add a little vanilla to the fruit when I heat it up.

HOLY BUTTER!  I even cut two tablespoons out of the recipe, and it was overflowing with butter.  After letting it cool, the butter soaked into the crust more, however it was still pretty greasy.  The taste was ok--would have been better if the amount of butter was cut in half, or even less.

I recently made this for a large gathering and while I didn't have any, it earned rave reviews from everyone there. Drawing from other reviews, I used 1/4 C of butter, and made it in an 8x8 pan. I made four, two with a can and a half of drained pie blackberries in each and two with a can and a half of drained pie cherries in each. I also sprinkled sugar on top while baking. Thanks for such an easy recipe!

I love this recipe.   It is so easy and simple.  The recipe is still delicous with the butter reduced, as others have recommended in their reviews. I have made it multiple times.  It is also tastes great cold.

This is EXACTLY the way my grandmother made it. I didn't change a thing, I didn't add anything. It makes a rich cobbler, not a cake. It's to be served with cream or ice cream. This is the way midwestern cobbler is meant to be! Five Stars!!

Made this for dessert on fathers day and it was very yummy! I reduced the butter, but I think next time I may use the amount stated in the recipe. I was able to tilt the pan and spread the melted puddled butter around the top once it was out of the oven and had cooled. So good!

This was absolutely the easiest recipe ever!  The word "cobbler" has always intimidated me because I don't bake much.  But this was so easy and delicious.  I used a mixed berry pie filling from a can and it came out great!

I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used 1/4 cup Splenda; also reduced the butter as others suggested.  It turned out OK, gave 4 stars because its easy and still tasty.

Taking the advice of other reviewers, I cut the butter in half.  Other tweaks: added vanilla, added chopped walnuts, cut the sugar to 1/3 cup (it was plenty sweet) and baked it in a 7in round pyrex dish.  I used cherry pie filling and it came out fantastic.  Very easy to make and lovely results.

Very easy and Very good.  I only used about 1/4 C of butter...maybe a little more (hard to tell, Switzerland doesn't have measurements on their butter wrappers so I just lopped off a chunk).  I made it for the first time for company and used Blueberry Pie filling and served with a few small scoops of vanilla ice cream.  I know Blueberry Pie filling is less sweet than others and I also think the vanilla ice cream helped tone down the sweetness and the buttery taste of the cobbler.  Will definitely make it again.  Glad I tried it.  Even my husband, who doesn't care for "fruit" desserts, said it was very good!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good.  I've made this several times.  The best way was doubling everything but the butter and pie filling.  This made    a much higher cake as it's too flat otherwise.  It disappeared in no time.

This cobbler is amazing.  Best cobbler I've ever had and we used fat free vanilla icecream (its all we had) so thats really saying something about how good it is!!!  I used Buttermilk instead milk cause it sounded good.  Very happy to have discovered this recipe :-)

Scaled back the butter, added some cinnamon and vanilla like suggested, and this still wasn't quite what I wanted.  The bread was very dense and spongy instead of fluffy like I'd expected.   Overall it wasn't terrible but wasn't anything to write home about either.

Despite seeing the numerous suggested changes in the reviews, I decided to follow the recipe exactly.  DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE  The crust was just saturated with butter; in fact, that was all it tasted like. The only thing worth eating was the filling, which i could have saved myself an hour or so and just eaten it straight from the can.

Not a cobbler at all! More like cherry cookie bars. I used 3 cups frozen drained cherries and reduced the butter to 1/4 cup. All I had was a 10x14 pan, and it turned out about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick, but I don't think that even if the pan had been smaller it would have had any chance of being a cobbler as I know it (but I'm from the south and maybe this is a yankee cobbler?). However, even though it's ugly (I wouldn't serve it to company due to lack of presentation qualities) and not a cobbler, it does taste good and was VERY simple and easy to make (great for kids and easy to please men). Also, it only took 30 minutes to bake, not the recommended 50-60 minutes, as it is, I burnt the edges a little (but it's still good, easy to please man says the burnt edges are GOOD, he likes the crunch). I may make it again just because it's so easy.

Definitely use less butter. 1/4 cup would be fine. Less sugar is wise too - otherwise it is too sweet and I like sweet. And adding some vanilla and a bit (not much it is strong) almond would add some good flavor. Best to use a good quality brand of pie filling - otherwise it will taste kinda fast "foody." Sounds counter intuitive with all that butter but I would use pam with flour for the pan next time. Not my favorite cobbler but easy to put together.

This is a strange recipe where the butter is not mixed in to the dough, but melted separately in the baking pan. It's not the prettiest cobbler I've ever made, but the butter makes for light and crispy cobbler edges. It's also very easy and doesn't require many ingredients.

I rate this a 5 with some changes.  I took other people's advice and reduced the sugar to 3/4 C, the butter to 1/4 C, and added a 1/4 t vanilla.  I did, however, bake in a 13x9 glass dish, but only baked for about 35 minutes.  It's great!

This was the easiest cobbler I ever made. I did use a round dish to bake it in and it turned out very pretty. Will make again.

This recipe was great. So simple for a quick dessert. However, I did make a big change, instead of a 13x9 pan I used an 8 in square pan and as others did , I reduced the butter by 2 tablespoons (not cause I wanted to , but it was all the butter I had)I baked for 50 min and it came out beautiful. there was a bit of butter pooled in the center but I just spread it over the browned biscuit portion  and none of it was a bit greasy. I will use it again and again for cobblers. I might even try doubling it for a 13x9 pan as I have a very large family . Hope this is helpful.

I used drained, frozen cherries and added 1 tsp. vanilla to add flavour.  For even more flavour I sprinkled the top with cinnamon before baking.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and everyone thought it was delicious.  It was an extremely fast and easy way to provide a homemade dessert for supper.

I have recipe similar to this.but  it is 1/4 butter melted in square glass dish and 3/4 c milk and 1 1/2 tsp baking power.baked at 400. It is good as peach cobbler also if you use 1 large can sliced peaches with 1/2 of the juice from can.

Butter is really a matter of taste as is sweetness.  Some like a dab of butter on their cobbler when finished (just like ice cream).  I cut the sugar by more than 3/4 cup -- I like the tartness of the cherries to come through -- and topped it with a few Tbsp of brown sugar instead.  Yummy!

Very good, very simple.  My husband loves it.  I added about 1/4 tsp of vanilla and a few dashes of cinnamon to the batter to jazz it up a bit.  Definitely serve this with with ice cream!

Use 1/2 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons of butter. You will get such better results with these measurements for those ingredients.  The cake part is so spongy and delicious this way. I have tried this recipe with varying degrees of butter and sugar and feel these measurements turned out the best.  I also line the whole bottom of the baking dish with cherries.  I love fruit. It turns out great this way. I use a glass baking dish for the best results. I have tried using other baking dishes and they don’t bake the cobbler throughly.

This recipe is perfect as it is written. Yes, it has butter, it's a cobbler, come on!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9 Pan for 60 minutes. I have made this with cherry, apple, blackberry, blueberry & Peach pie filling. Each time was perfect. When taking it out of the oven, I thought OMGosh there is butter pooling up there and assumed it was ruined but while it cooled the butter soaked up into the cake parts. It was AMAZING! Ignore these "butter panic'ers" and enjoy a good old fashioned cobbler!

I've been using this recipe for several years and I love it just the way it is! I double the recipe except for the butter ( I only use the 1/2 cup) and I use it with all kinds of fruit pie fillings and I add a tablespoon of pure vanilla extract to the batter  (since my ingredients are doubled, you'd probably want 1-2 tsp. in a normal batch). I sprinkle cinnamon on top of the whole dish as soon as the crust starts to form and continue baking.  This is my dish of choice whenever I need to bring a dish somewhere and it never fails to get rave reviews. I'm trying it today with Carmel Apple pie filling, smells heavenly so far...

This is a good recipe, however cut the butter down to 4 tablespoons at the most.  Also add about 1 teaspoon of vanilla and ground cinnamon.  I also used an 8x8 glass baking dish and it came out perfect.

This cobbler was pretty yummy! But I agree with some other reviewers that 1/4 cup butter is PLENTY and that the cake part of the cobbler was very thin. I think next time I would double the rest of the ingredients and still reduce butter. I baked mine in an  8x8 pan for 55mins. I also added a little vanilla and cinnamon to the batter.  I had still had some pools of melted butter on top when I pulled it out of the oven. But I used it to soak the edges and corners. This wasn't AMAZING as some have put it, but it was definitely worth trying. I topped it with some French Vanilla Ice Cream while it was still hot and gooey from the oven.

Delicious! I used 100% whole wheat flour instead of all purpose but it was still a big hit! My kids wanted seconds. I only suggest to make sure to spread the fruit around a little or it stays in the middle and the "cake" rises up around it. :)

This was good, but not what I expected. Should have used a smaller dish than 13 x 9 because it was a little "flatter" and stuck to the pan, which I didn't expect. Very tasty though. Served with cool-whip and the kids gobbled it up!

My family went crazy over this recipe. They're not usually too fond of cherry cobbler, but i had them begging for seconds. The recipe wouldn't have been as good had the following changes not been made: WAY too much butter! all you really need is about 2 or 3 tablespoons. Also, I added an extra half-a-can of cherry pie filling. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be sure to make it again!

OK, I have to say, this is so simple and delicious. I cannot believe there aren't more reviews. I used NO butter, I never do, and sprayed the 9X9 pan with Pam. I used a can of black cherries in syrup and drained them. I cup up fresh strawberries and added a bit of sugar to them both. Cooked everything as said and it was so delicious!! Thank you for a recipe so wonderful!!

I wish that I would have read the reviews before I made this cobbler. Holy butter! It totally ruins the recipe and over powers the cherries. Next time I will try half the butter. Has potential to be very good.

Delicious!  The way I read the directions, the flour mixture is to be put in the pan first and then topped with the cherries?  That's what I did, and while it looks very little like the photo, it was very tasty.  I used fresh cherries, half the recommended amount of butter, whole wheat flour & substituted Splenda for the sugar, and it was a very good dessert.

I really enjoyed this simple, yet delicious dessert.  I used a round baking dish and I stayed with 1/2 c butter.  I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 c and added about 1/4 c of brown sugar.  I also added cinnamon to the batter.  Serve this recipe hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I give this recipe 5 stars because the quick-and-easy factor, combined with the wonderful result, fully deserves it!

I only write reviews on dishes I think are 5 star or better and this is one of them. I made this for myself for my birthday "cake". In order to fill the 9x13, I did a recipe and a half, except I left the butter at a half a cup. I know alot of people complained that there was too much butter, but I loved it. I am not on a diet and I love butter so I had no problems with it. Thanks for the recipe, I have been trying to find one like it for quite some time.

this recipe was quick and easy and if you cut the butter down to 3T you don't get it pooling at the top. Tasted great with a scoop of ice cream. I've made it twice now for a quick desert.

This the fastest, easiest dessert!  I couldn't believe a cobbler could be so easy and still taste Fantastic.  My only suggestion is to reduce the butter by about 1 or 2 tablespoons.  There was just a bit too much butter for me.  I will be making this for a long time, Thanks!!

A little to much butter but otherwise great. I added 1/2 tsp Almond extract and 1/2 cup cropped Pecans. I also used a 9x10 baking dish. Yummy.

I would give this recipe 5 stars in a heartbeat except as it is written, it calls for way too much butter. I used about 1/8 cup and that was plenty. Other than that, this recipe is perfect in every other way!

Simple enough for a beginner yet still a wonderful dessert for any crowd. A normal cherry pie recipe calls for 5 cups of cherries, with that in mind I would not use a 9x13 unless I added more cherries to the original recipe. I double the batter (except for the sugar which I felt 1 cup was enough) used 5 cups of cherries with 1 cup sugar added to them and used a 9x13 and it was fabulous.

recipe was okay. unlike other reviewers, i did not have the problem of butter pooling on top. i used 2 cans of no-sugar-added cherry pie filling, but other than that, i made no changes. i probably should have doubled the topping too. none of these are taken to account in my review. it just wasnt quite good enough, but still pretty good and smelled wonderful.

After reading some other reviews, I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and was fine. Divided sugar and Splenda evenly. Added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to dry ingredients.  Baked in an oval baking dish and turned out great. We loved it !  I topped my share with vanilla ice cream and my husband used whipping cream.

Mmm Mmm Good! I veganized the recipe, using Earth Balance (1/3 c.) in place of the butter and soymilk for the milk. Per the reviews I added in a 1/4 t. of vanilla and a couple of sprinkles of cinnamon (which I love) to the batter and reduced the sugar to 3/4c. Turned out really good with some nice crispy edges. Definitely bake in a smaller pan for thicker pieces. Great the first day piping hot with a scoop of soy ice cream and oh so good the next served cold by itself!

I found some of the other reviews very helpful but I also made some changes.  I doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan.  I used 2 cans of cherry pie filling & 1 can of (drained) tart cherries to have more cherries & less filling.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (for each recipe) and left the butter/margarine at 1/4 cup.  It was plenty.  My husband & guests loved it!

A little cakier than the cobblers I love. Otherwise it was good. Next time I may follow my grandma’s advice and rinse the pie filling can with water and add that to the mix.

I read the recipe, and read the reviews. I made it just the way it was written here.  It is delicious! I have no idea why a simple delicious recipe like  becomes a project  for some people. It browned nicely, no puddles of butter.  It turned out perfect. We loved it. And it’s delicious with a little ice cream!

Cut the butter down to 2 Tbs and it’s perfect!   I think this recipe is good as is, except for the butter. It must be cut down to 2 Tablespoons or you’ll have butter floating on the top after it’s baked.  The first time I made it, I cut the butter down to 4 Tablespoons and that was still too much, butter was floating on top and coagulated when I refrigerated it.  My personal tweeks:  I sift the flour, and I add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter when making cherry or blueberry.  When I make apple, I add to that a 1/2 teaspoon of allspice.  Sifting the flour makes a big difference in the texture of the “crust”.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the directions, with the help of a few other review suggestions and it came out PERFECTLY! I cut down the butter to 1/4 c, cut down the sugar to 3/4 c, and added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract and cinnamon to the batter and it came out great. Very sweet and the crust was to die for! Cannot wait to make this with different fruits!!

Easy, tasty, great for a spur of the moment dessert.
Not particularly impressive or exciting, but it doesn’t always have to be a flambé or baked Alaska, right?  
Down home good.

So I actually wanted this to fill a 9 x 13 pan so I I tripped the cherries and made 1.5x the crust and it fit perfectly.  I left the butter the same but would have definitely cut it back if I was making something smaller.  It was still almost to much.

Worked fine using the suggestions mentioned by others.  Reduced sugar to 2/3 cup, butter to 3 Tbs, added 1/2 God of cinnamon.  I insert the baking powder to 1.5 to and dotted the top with 1/3 pkg of cream cheese.  I baked this in my toaster oven covering the top with aluminum foil the last 10 minutes per chance it might burn. It was a hit.

Good basic cobbler.  I baked it in a round casserole dish (as suggested by another review.). I used cherry pie filling.  It was good with or without ice cream , warm or cold.

All these people who say they added this changed that and did it this way miss the point. I made it as presented, in the 9 x 13 " pan and found it wonderful. I will send a photo. Not too dark. Not pancake thin.  Not too sweet. Right amount of butter. For heaven's sake, some people could melt the pan trying to boil water.

My family and I love this recipe! I substituted two 15 oz. cans of drained  peaches for the cherry filling because that is what I had in my pantry. I also added a sprinkle of ground cinnamon to the top before baking because we enjoy the flavor. It turned out delicious, and I will definitely make this again using the cherry or other fruit filling that we may have a taste for.

10.19.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15139/cherry-cobbler-ii/ ... This reminded me of TV dinner cobbler.  I ate it, but didn't want another serving.  Because of the high sugar content in the filling, I reduced sugar to 2/3c in the batter. & used an 8x8 so 3T butter; an hour at 350.   The baked batter is kind of spongy,  but it worked.

This is an excellent cobbler!  Been in my family for years!  Only difference, we just start it at 350 and keep it there till cobbler is done. And we use self rising flour and leave out baking powder. The butter bubbles up into the flour and makes a nice crust. Sooo delicious!

This recipe is delicious but definitely needs to be modified; as written is too much butter and too large of a baking dish. Using a smaller baking dish (I used a 5x8 baking dish) and half as much butter, it's absolutely perfect. It's now a go-to dessert for me because it's so easy to throw together! I've made this twice with homemade cherry pie filling and once with homemade peach pie filling. I've even made it with 1/4c coconut oil when out of butter and it was great! It's a keeper!

First time making this cherry cobbler. Turned out excellent. If you like it  sweet use the 1 cup sugar, I used 1/2  also since I used a smaller pan I used only 1/4 cup butter as well. 
I made two of these at the same time baked them for 50-55 minutes. Took one to potluck meeting, i was given complements on how good it was,  also it was still warm when I got there and we had it. I would have to say it is one of our favorites and my go to for a quick perfect dessert!
Serve warm and use real butter! We ate the second one tonight! Still delicious, but best served warm.

I followed the directions and listen to some of the other reviews and used less sugar and less butter and added 1/4 tsp vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon . I cooked it in a round 4 qt dish.  The cobbler wasn’t too sweet which we liked but just fell short of being really good. We won’t be making this one again..

I was so happy to find this recipe at allrecipes.com.  I’ve been making this for 20 years just the way it’s written (except using heavy whipping cream vs milk) .  Got the directions and ingredients from a friend back in 1997.  My husband and I have never had a better cobbler - ever!  Rich - yes.  Delicious - incredibly so.  It’s so simple, easy and worth it.  I always have the ingredients on hand, too.  I usually make it with canned peaches, but we love it with cherry pie filling, too!

I used 2 cans of cherry pie filling. One was not enough. It was not sweet enough. It probably would have been better with whip cream or ice cream but not that good on it's own.

I used 3 tbs butter, added cinnamon to the batter, 1/3c white sugar, 1/3c brown sugar and I used fresh cherries. I also used an 8x8 glass pan.  I thought it was really good. The edges got pretty crispy @ 50 min. I would consider using even less sugar next time. It was incredibly easy and I will definitely make it again for a speedy dessert!

I used 3/4 c. butter. I melted butter in 9 in square baking dish in microwave while oven preheated to cobbler baking temp. I also only used 1/2 c. sugar since I was using a can of pie filling. I also made this as a gluten free recipe, which is why it is not as brown. GF flour blend plus 1 tsp xanthan gum or guar gum. I sprinkled cinnamon on top of apple pie filling before putting it in the oven. Then 15 mins before end of baking time, sprinkled cinnamon & sugar over the top & let it continue to bake until edges & top were lightly browned.

I made this but substituted the flour for gluten free 1 for 1 flour. It tasted great and the family loved it. Next time I make this I will cut the butter down and make it in a smaller pan.

Made it exactly as it before reading the reviews, so was wishing I had made some of the adjustments / tweaks..  However, it turned out great as is.   Was thawing out whipped topping to serve on top.  Husband couldn't wait until it thawed and thought it was best with the frozen whipped topping on the warm cobbler.  He even went back for seconds.  Not sure if I would make it differently next time or not, since he liked it as is.

Very quick and easy recipe, which is always a bonus if you're pressed for time. I read several reviews before making this, and even with making some adjustments from the outset, I still think the recipe could use more tweaking. The rating I have given it is based solely on the recipe as it is written. I only used 4 tablespoons of butter (I think it would have been fine to cut it down to 3). I baked the cobbler in a 2.5-quart baking dish. A 9x13 thins it out too much, in my opinion. I didn't think it was sweet enough, so I would probably add a little more sugar if I were to make this again.

After reading what others did, the only thing I did was to cut back on the butter. I used half of what the recipe calls for, and would still use  a little less. And I sprinkled sugar all over it before cooking. Delicious! Everyone loves it! I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. I will be making another cobbler

Didn't reduce the butter, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp salt to the batter, and doubled the fruit (2 cans no-sugar-added cherry pie filling). It came out very tasty, though a little less structured than I was expecting

This was really good, not too sweet and easy to make. I made it for a potluck at work and it got great reviews. I did make a couple of changes though. I used a 9x9 baking dish, I cut the butter in half, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture and sprinkled with a tiny bit of raw sugar after taking out of the oven. I baked mine for 45 minutes and it turned out perfect. I will definitely make this again. it was delicious!

I had a 30 oz can of cherry pie filling so I used 1 1/2 c flour 1 1/4 c sugar 1 1/2 t baking powder & 1 1/2 c milk - reviewers commented on needed more flavor in the cake mixture so I followed their direction & added cinnamon, allspice & vanilla - it just came out of the oven I had to cook it 1 hour 45 mins - I thought of using the broiler to add crispness to the top but worried it would do more harm than good (see pictures) - there was butter just gathering everywhere so I tilted it by propping it on a pot holder then used paper towels to soak up the butter then followed that with laying a paper towel across the top to get it out of the cherry filling craters ?? The "cake" is chewy & taste ok but it's too much like the texture of dumplings I've seen in others dumplings & that's just not my cup of tea - I used the 1/2 c butter called for in the original recipe due to adding more flour & sugar but I wish I would have used 1/4 c suggested by others maybe the cake would have been dryer - either way it's not one I would make again but thanks for sharing

I took other reviewers suggestions and halved the butter and added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. Then I added way too many frozen cherries (4-5 cups, I would guess), and overlooked the change in oven temp and cooked it for two hours on 275. I wasn't sure if it wasn't setting because of the extra liquid or the low temp. Finally I looked at the recipe again and upped the temp another 40 minutes or so.I did everything to ruin it and it was still great. This recipe is literally foolproof.

A really good cobbler, kids love it. Following reviewers advice, I cut the butter to 3 T. of oil, added 1 tsp. each of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter, and baked it in a 8x8. This was as good as cold as it was hot.

This was not a good cobbler.  I took the suggestions of others about reducing the butter, because I also thought it was way too much.  The batter came out chewy, and no flavor.

Great after I followed others advice so here's the changes I made:
3 Tbs. butter instead of 1/2 cup
Tbs. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. vanilla in flour mix
Put all sugar in flour mix except 1/4 cup and in the last 20 min of baking sprinkle that left over sugar on top.
I did this with cherries and then another with apples both were YUMMY!!!

made this tonight in a smaller dish than requested... with a dash of nutmeg and a tsp of cinnamon.. i also reduced butter slightly (2 TBSP).... it was delicious.  I remembered being given this recipe when i lived in NC and they called it "one cup cobbler". It was simple to make and an easy recipe to remember... YUM!

Excellent.  As suggested I always reduce the butter to 1/4c and add a tsp of Cinnamon.  This is my sons birthday "dessert" each year. Thanks.

I didn't really care for this recipe. The taste was okay. I used a square pan instead of a 9x13, so maybe the crust wold have been crispier, but it still lacked flavor. I definitely would NOT cut the sugar down, but it still needs something else. I'll try another recipe. Thank you anyway.

It was very good, but unless you really cut down on the butter, it's going to turn out bad.  I used half a stick and that still seemed too much, so I drained most of it so that is only coated the bottom.  Other than that, it turned out very nice.

This was pretty good.  I made it as the recipe called and had no problems with the butter.  It was more cake-like but still yummy.
