Loved this Fruit pizza the best. The puff pastry crust is much better than a sweet sugary crust since there's already sugar in pudding and natural sugar in the fruit. Will make this for my 4th of July family get together! Yummmm!

Beautiful presentation and very simple to make.  Next time I might add Triple Sec or a like type liquor to the pudding mixture to give it a little kick!  I also used mangos with blueberries and strawberries and kiwi.  You can really do any seasonal fruit.

This was tasty, but there were logistical issues.  The pudding ran over the edges of the puff (maybe I didn't poke it with the fork enough) and it was difficult to cut and serve without the fruit falling off.

It was alright, the pudding just needs more flavor.  Maybe by adding vanilla extract.  If not eaten quickly it does get mushy.
