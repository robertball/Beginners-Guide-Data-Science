Made these today, makes almost 3 dozen and they smelled great. They don't need even 20 minutes to bake, first batch I did 20 minutes and it was a touch too long. Would use this again.

You definitely can taste garam masala in these muffins, and the zucchini makes them moist.  One minor point which you can take or leave.  It makes more sense to me to mix in the cocoa powder with the dry ingredients rather than with the wet ones.   It's very hard to incorporate into the egg-applesauce-sugar mixture, as the cocoa tends to float on the top.  These definitely are cocoa flavored muffins, so if I make again, I think I'll use all peanut butter chips rather than milk chocolate-peanut butter chips.  Personally, I liked the peanut butter flavor better, perhaps it's just a taste preference.  I cut the zucchini lengthwise into quarters and used the fine shredding blade on the food processor (a lot easier than grating by hand 2 cups of zucchini), and it worked great.  Doubt that I'd make these too often, but it was a nice change for a muffin.

I needed to use up some extra zucchini and this was the perfect choice.  I used a little less sugar and cocoa powder and a bit more garam masala and they were a huge hit at work.

My husband and youngest son couldn't get enough of these cake like muffins.  While the batter didn't taste great, they baked up well. 

I didn't have garam masala, so I approximated a spice mixture of: 2 parts ginger, 1 pt cinnamon, 2 pts black pepper, 3 pts ground cumin, 3 pts ground coriander, 1/2 pts ground nutmeg, & 1 pt ground cloves.

I was curious about the addition of peanut butter chips and gaiam masala additions. I had tones of zucchini to use up and thought I would give this a try. They turned out nice. I added one ripe banana, and used a combination of whole wheat flour, cake flour and white divided equally. They were a big hit with my kids. They seemed moist and fluffy.

As I always do, I follow the recipe exactly at first. These are so delicious, moist, slightly spicy, chocolatey, with a hint of peanut butter. I wondered about the garam masala. I have used that in Indian food but never for baking. I think it works just fine. Whoever came up with the idea to use this spice mix in a chocolate zucchini muffin is a genius! If itâ€™s the idea of only the maker of these muffins then you are a genius! Well done.

Great flavor, texture is a little off for me. Changes; I made half recipe, using two medium eggs. Used yellow squash instead of zucchini, and used plain peanut butter chips instead of the fancy swirled ones. Nice and sweet. The egg could have contributed to the texture, but I also think these would benefit from using oil instead of applesauce :)

I was very disappointed in these muffins.  I prefer a moister muffin and these were very dry. Definitely not a keeper for me.

A real crowd pleaser, it reminds people of Texas Chocolate Cake. I double or triple the garam masala as I find it hard to taste otherwise.
