Delicious, vegan chili that satisfies your cravings for a warm and hearty meal. The sweet potato and tomatoes go very, very well together. I soaked my lentils for half an hour before cooking and this helped decrease cooking time a bit.

Great recipe - easy to make! My kids donâ€™t like spicy food too much, so I left out the poblano pepper and put only a little chili powder (less than half of what was in the recipe). Threw in a zucchini for something green. Everyone loved this dish!!

I made this for the first time last night and loved it! One of my favorite lentil recipes. I added extra sweet potatoes (about one medium sized potato extra) and used maybe 20% less broth just because I like chili to be less soupy and it turned out awesome! I'm sure I'll tinker more in the future but for a super easy recipe this turned out excellent!

Great base recipe, changed it up quite a bit though... Added fresh garlic to the onions , used canned chick peas, black eyed peas and white beans. Added fresh lime and zest and the juice of one lime along with freshly chopped cilantro as a granish...

Excellent healthy recipe. A real treasure.  I loved the sweet potato and would definitely add more next time. I used chipotle chili pepper, which was quite hot, so next time will use a bit less to tone down the heat a little. The avocado garnish is a great addition. Green and brown lentils can be used interchangeably, so go with what you have on hand. Can be served over brown rice too. Yum!
