This turned out very flavorful and filling, but was  pretty labor intensive for a weeknight quality meal. I definitely want to make it again, but next time I'll use a Costco rotisserie chicken.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used leftover pork that had been slow cooked and I omitted the red bell pepper because I did not have any. This was delicious and came together quickly,  especially since my meat was already done. I will make this again. Thank you for sharing.
