I was ok with this recipe before I made it then began to doubt it when I realized how not cheesy it was, I mean come on Enchiladas=Cheese to me!! But lo and behold it turned out really well, forgot all about the lack of cheese. I did sub fresh ingredients for the processed ones..1 1/2 c black beans for the canned...1 1/2 c. of diced fresh tomatoes and green chilies...home made tortillas and 1/4 c of fresh made picante sauce..and the Red Enchilada Sauce from this site for the 1 cup of salsa. I also took the advice of another reviewer and just put the cheese in with the filling instead of on top. Very Good with a big salad!

Quite tasty and healthy. A bit high on the salt, so next time I think we will dice our own tomatoes and chilies. We used an extremely hot Mexican picante, so reduced the amount to 1 Tbps. I would also recommend putting the cheese inside of the tortilla instead of outside. Otherwise, a definite winner.

Fantastic!! I followed the recipe with only minor modifications:  used enchilada sauce in the filling instead of picante, plus spread thinly in the bottom of the pan and poured over the rolled enchiladas before baking; omitted red pepper flakes; used one cup of rice instead of two.  I used eight eight-inch multi-grain tortillas and still had a bit of filling left over.  I also served the cilantro at the table, just because I didn't read the directions!!  These are just delicious.

I love the fact the tortilla will turn out a little crispy!

I didn't have picante sauce, so made Red Enchilada Sauce (from this site).

This was a really yummy recipe! I mixed a green tomatillo salsa into the filling instead of picante sauce. I used white rice instead of brown only because that's all I had (wouldn't reccomend that) and used a red bell pepper instead of green (just a personal preference). I reduced the amount of rice to a litte over a cup and it was perfect. I think it made the perfect amount of filling, it made 8 nicely stuffed enchiladas. I poured enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and then topped the enchiladas with more sauce. Served with salsa and guacamole from this site. I think next time I will double the sauce and add zuchinni to the  filling. *UPDATE*: I just made these again but added a habanero pepper, carrots, zuchinni, and sweet potato to the filling and it was awesome! I used red salsa in the filling and used more sauce on top. It was great.

This was a big hit with my family....My husband came running down the stairs when he smelled this one cooking and stated that he could eat it now and I was only in the stage of adding the rice to the rest of the ingredients! My brother had always stated that he didnt think he'd like mexican food because he had never eaten it, however, he loved this recipe. This has definitely been added to our family's vegetarian menu and it was prepared exactly the way you suggested. Thank you very much!

I made these over the weekend for my Vegetarian daughter and ended up eating them myself! These were AWESOME! It made enough filling for 12 enchiladas, not the 8 that the recipe stated, but amazingly good! I highly recommend this recipe and will be making it again!

These are superb! We like these much better than the usual chicken or beef enchiladas.  Instead of buying peppers and onions and all that separately, we substituted a cup of our favorite salsa in place of all of the beggies. It's all in the salsa anyway, already cut up for me, and Im saving a couple of bucks. We will keep this in our dinner rotation. Thanks so much!

A new vegan delight for us, I used Las Palmas Enchilada sauce (that's the one my mom always used when I was a kid...ahhh tastes like home...), I add some fresh or frozen corn, and for our vegan sensiblities left out the cheese.  Used corn tortillas instead of flour. DELICISIOSO!!!!  I found these to freeze and reheat well, so make a bunch for later!

When the filling is warm and the tortillas are warm, you really don't need that much oven cooking time!  In a preheated oven, 10 minutes is fine before putting on the cheese!  The leftover filling can be used to make part of this again another time! This makes a colorful, tasty meal!

To spice it up a bit, I used a mix of 1 1/2 Tbs of chipotle chili pepper and 1 1/2 Tbs of med hot chili power which gave it a nice mild smoky flavor. A keeper.

So outrageously yummy and spicy but not in a hot way. Don't miss having meat at all. Serving with sour cream next time.

Great vegetarian enchiladas.  The only change I made was to top them with enchilada sauce instead of salsa, because I had leftover enchilada sauce that I wanted to use up.  The whole family really enjoyed these for dinner.

Really, really good. I followed the recipe exactly; I just used picante sauce for the topping, too, rather than purchase a jar of salsa. I will make again and again!

These were fantastic!  I made a few changes though.  I did use enchilada sauce instead of the picante sauce and salsa.  I did not use the cilatro because I forgot to pick it up.  These were really yummy!  There was a great amount of spice too!  I'll be making these again!

Outstanding.. I somehow approximately doubled the rice, so I felt that it needed an extra can of beans. However, I added 3 freshly grilled & chopped boneless chicken breasts to the mixture at the same time I added the rice, so it all heated together. That made an amazing difference. I suggest using toothpicks to hold the tortilla together while baking. Highly recomended recipe.

I added shredded chicken and this dish is fantastic. With the chicken it makes quite a few more enchiladas, so buy extra.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious. I had my non vegetarian boyfriend and sister try it and they both raved about how filling it was. The flavors just pop and the nice thing is that I have left overs for tomorrow. The only thing that was a little off was how much rice you need. I only used about a cup and half and it turned out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I use this recipie for black beans and rice without the enchiladas.  I use a mix of rainbow peppers, half the onion, tomatoes with green peppers and celery (I can't find the proper canned tomatoes here), 1tbls of cumin (I really like the flavor).
Everyone asks for more and I have been asked a few times to make it again.

My whole family loved this! They were absolutely delicious.

Note: "picante" is Spanish for spicy and "salsa" is Spanish for sauce, so "picante sauce" and "salsa" are the same thing.

This is a fantastic EASY recipe - but I made some alterations because those were the items I had on hand.  Avacado Oil infused with lemon, frozen red/yellow/green peppers, and frozen onion.  I did puree the tomatoes just a tad (don't like chucky tomatoes).  Sooooo tasty!  I actually ate this for lunch and dinner 3 days straight.  Great base to add chicken to later (I'm a vegetarian, husband is not).  I will keep this in rotation, and also try freezing.

These were delicious! As a vegetarian, I gets so old having enchiladas that are just dripping with cheese and FAT! These tasted so good, and had just a bit of cheese. The only change I made was I combined a can of green enchilada sauce with mild taco sauce for the topping. Amazing!

excellent dish!  I used taco seasoning rather than "chili powder" but other than that I kept things the same.  I really enjoyed this, even though there wasn't as much cheese as other enchiladas I've had.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this vegetarian dish!  I subbed mild enchilada sauce for both the picante and salsa (needed to make it less spicy for the kids).  I poured a bit of enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan before I baked the enchiladas as well.  Also left out the crushed red pepper and chili powder because of the spice issues too.  I served it with homemade salsa to add the spice back for the adults.  Very good!

These are delicious, but just a warning, it makes a TON! I got 12 out of it and 1 with a salad is enough for me for a meal. So this is great recipe if you want to have lots of leftovers. I made just a couple of changes - used enchilada sauce instead of the picante sauce and added a sprinkle of cheese inside each enchilada. Another great vegetarian recipe to add to our rotation.

This was about a 3.5 star recipe.  It was a nice alternative to a meat enchilada and had a lot of flavor and since I added more red pepper quite a kick.  Will be making this healthier alternative again!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  You don't even miss the meat with these babies.  I used enchilada sauce instead of the picante.  I also added a smidge of the Mexican cheese inside the enchiladas.  You can top these with some light sour cream too.  They were spicy because I used Rotel with jalapeno peppers, hot salsa, and enchilada sauce.  But we loved them.  My husband said "You can make these again anytime!"  It's THAT good!

Excellent recipe! I did as others mentioned and put a little picante on the bottom of the bake-ware before the enchiladas. I also added cooked shrimp just before I rolled up the enchiladas which worked great. I didn't want to overcook them by putting them in the skillet with the mix, but doing raw that way would definitely add to their flavor! Very pleased, and will definitely make these again!

A few modifications made this a 5 star recipe: Instead of two cups brown rice, I put in 1/2 cup bron rice and 1/2 cup corn. I also used no-sodium added diced tomatoes & a small can of diced chiles (small can), instead of canned tomatoes + chiles. I omitted chili powder to maek sure it wasn't too spicy. I added a small amt of cheese inside each enchilada, per other reviews, & poured enchilada sauce (I used Trader Joe's enchilada sauce) on the baking dish before laying them down. Instead of salsa on top of each enchilda, I poured more enchilada sauce. I topped them with diced green onions. These were sensational and my non-vegetarian family was not only asking for seconds but also for the recipe! Thanks, Christie!

Very good for healthy eating! I did add some lean ground beef, can of green chilis, 8 oz can of tomato sauce, 1 cup of rice. Due to adding the meat I had something to make it more saucy and I only had one can of tom & chili so I had to elaborate.YUMMY!

Kids didn't like it (all under 10 years of age), but parents did.  Good meal.  Nice to have something vegetarian.  I did modify it.  I used red pepper instead of green, through in 1/2 cup of shredded zucchini, cut up 1.5 fresh tomatoes instead of canned, white rice instead of brown, put the cilantro in the bean/rice mix, and added cheese inside the tortillas.   I think it would taste a little better with some chicken.  Prep time was a little too long for my standards (lots of chopping).

WOW! I am one of those people who plans meals around what kind of meat to cook... my main reason for trying this recipe was to use up some leftover brown rice I had in the fridge... I was blown away by the taste, how easy it was to make, and the fact that I didn't miss the meat in it AT ALL! This is going into my regular recipe rotation, love it!

I took the easy way and used a favorite enchilada sauce for these, instead of the picante, spices  and salsa. Super easy to throw together and ingredients I always have. I put chunks of cheddar in with the beans and rice. It gave it a some nice cheesiness on the inside. And then topped with more cheese. I used the same amount of filling but only filled four tortillas. This will be great to make for meatless Mondays.

Healthy and simply delicious!  I made mine as a stacked enchilada casserole, since I'm not good at rolling tortillas to look like the picture.  I layered 1 layer of tortillas, 1 layer of filling, 1 layer of cheese, and then repeated with the leftover tortillas and some salsa on top.  It was spicy, hearty, and went nicely with a white table wine.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was absolutely fabulous.  I made it exactly as is and my husband and I both loved it.  We just added a dollop of sour cream to the top of ours.  These were great as leftovers too.  I just made it and i am already to make it again!!

Not sure what took me so long to try this one!  To make this super fast & easy used:  Frontera Red Chile Enchilada Sauce (1 pkg) and skipped the picante and salsa.  Used Trader Joe's frozen organic brown rice.  Used 2 tablespoons of reduced sodium taco seasoning and skipped the chili powder, cumin and pepper.  Came together super fast, super easy and super tasty.  Great for 'Meatless Monday."  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good, even my bean hating husband ate two of these. I used 2 cans of beans, and probably around 3 cups of rice. I also left the picante sauce out of the filling since I didn't want it to be too spicy for our 3 year old. These would have been great with corn, so I'll add that next time I make them.

I changed up the filling amounts slightly to use what I had on hand. I used 1 cup brown rice, 1 cup corn, 3 cups black beans (made at home not canned) 1/2 cup salsa and 2 tbsps homemade salt free taco seasoning, it made 16 enchiladas, I also used whole wheat tortillas, I omitted the cilantro as I don't like it, very good and enjoyed by everyone!

This is really tasty and a healthier spin on Mexican food, but with all the canned foods boy is it salty! I changed things up the second time I made it by dicing fresh tomatoes and chilies as well as cooking my own black beans. I also used a homemade picante and salsa recipe (you can find them online if you don't have one). It was much better and I didn't find myself reaching for the water after every bite. If you have the time I really do suggest the extra effort to limit the sodium. I made extra filling and just stuck it in the fridge to make again for lunch. I used whole wheat tortillas and lowfat cheese, you can even throw in some cottage cheese if it's to your liking. I think next time I'll add some corn to the mix. Tasty and worked out well for leftovers.

This was yum and super healthy!!! I used two fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned and used whole wheat tortillas.  I mixed the cheese with the filling mixture and it was yummy! I also topped the enchiladas with a homemade red enchilada sauce and baked for an additional 5 minutes.  These were FILLING! I could only eat half of one! Definitely tastes more like a wet burrito than an enchilada, but good nonetheless.

this dish was a huge hit! i took the advice of someone else's comment and also diced my own tomatoes and green chili instead of using canned (i used one full regular sized tomato and a VERY small amount of green chili). i didnt have picante sauce and didn't substitute it with anything-- just left it out-- and the enchiladas were still spicy and moist enough for my taste.
next time i think i'll try making my own enchilada sauce to put on top instead of using store-bought salsa, but since i'm a beginner anyway this was a great way to start out!

This was great. I did a couple substitutions based on what I had on hand/preference- no pepper flakes or cilantro and I used a mexcian blend of cheese instead of the cheddar. We didn't miss the meat at all, and it was very filling, one was enough for me. I will say that it wasn't particularly young child-friendly, it was messy (obviously) and had a little too much spice for them, but I loved it and it made good left-overs as well.

This is a nice vegetarian meal.  I try to do one meatless dinner each week and this is a winner.  I followed the recipe exactly but did add a little cheese into the rice/bean mixture as well.  Because I have young picky eaters I omitted the red pepper flakes and cut the chili powder to 1 tsp instead of 1 Tbsp.  It was still too spicy.  Next time I'll just cut the chili powder all together.  I'll also put a little salsa at the bottom of the pan before I put the enchiladas in.  The bottoms came out a bit hard for my taste. Oh and while it's not the most healthy add-on, some sour cream would be delicious with this!

Good basic recipe that you can easily modify to suit your tastes. I used a can of plain chopped tomatoes and a can of diced green chilies; that added a nice level of spice. I also used Trader Joe's enchalada sauce over the top. I also put cheese in with the rice mixture. I ended up with more rice mixture than what would fit in the tortillas; but that was find because that was tasty on its own.

Great!  I normally prefer corn tortillas for enchiladas but this ended up being very much like the wet burritos I like from the Mexican restaurants.  I cheated in the prep a bit-made Red Enchilada Sauce from this site, mixed a good amount into cooked brown rice and added the can of black beans.  Filled the tortillas (added cheese inside too) and then poured the remaining sauce over the top.  After baking, I served them topped with sour cream, avocado, cilantro, green onions & halved grape tomatoes.  Delicious!!

I loved this recipe!  I skimmped a little on the spicey stuff because I have small children.  I would call them burritos rather than enchiladas but they were deeeee-lish.  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow to eat them again!

I took the advice of others and used 1 1/2 cups of diced tomatoes rather than the canned tomatoes and I used 2 thai green chilies instead of the canned variety.  Everything else I kept the same and this recipe came out great.  Will definitely make again.

I loved these!  I added Monterey Jack cheese.  I also added sliced olives on top along with the cilantro just for garnish.  I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa and I left out the red pepper flakes. I used black beans I cooked myself instead of canned, and I used Mexican style diced tomatoes.  I can't wait to serve these to company.  Thanks for a great recipe!

MMM! This was soo good! I didn't change much, didn't use picante sauce, just poured some salsa into the rice mixture, and instead of using a regular onion i diced up some green onions and sauteed it with the garlic. The rice was so tasty I ate it as a side dish! Very good!

This recipe was great...I pretty much followed the directions.  I just made a couple changes...like another reader I didn't use the red pepper flakes instead I used chilli powder. I used Louisiana hot sauce instead of picante sauce and I also chopped up half of a jicama which added a nice crunch.  This was great with a nice salad!

Really good and simple.  I omitted the peppers and made Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce from the site, it good enough for simple homemade.  Next time I will double the Enchiliada sauce and mix some into the rice mixture, it did seem a little dry the next day.

All three kids and my husband loved this.  A little too spicy for my 2 year old but with sour cream he was pleased :)  Of course, the chili powder and crushed peppers can be omitted for spice sensitivities.  Next time I will use less rice and more beans.  I, also, did not have green peppers and they were still great!

Before we tried them, my husband was skeptical when he asked what kind of meat was in them and I said there wasn't any.  He loved them!  I used a frozen bag of brown rice.  My husband thinks he doesn't like brown rice, but he never noticed and I did not tell him.  I let the sauce simmer for about an hour.  I used the small fajita size tortillas and it made about 12.

Excellent recipe! They were delicious and healthy. I just used taco sauce on the top before the cheese. I love this. Definitely a new staple here. Tomatoes, raw onion and the cilantro on top just made it outstanding and quite pretty. Thanks for a great recipe!

this was a very tasy meal.  I added a bit more to stretch the recipe for my large family. I made the adult portions more spicy than the childrens.  It went over well with all.  Full for hours but not over full.  A keeper for my family!!!

this was really good. I added some ground turkey to mine because my family likes meat. I added cilantro to the beans and rice while it was cooking to give it more flavor. This was a little bit spicy to the kids but they still ate it. Next time I won't add the red pepper flakes. In all it made 18 enchiladas.

Wife and I made this just as written and it was delicious!  Next time we may add a bit more cheese as a guilty pleasure but what a great recipe!  Thanks, Christie for a reall good one!
Nice to see a healthy slant on an old basic favorite.
Man, are these tasty!  Hope everyone tries these out as the recipe calls for, and then decides to make any changes.

This is the perfect place to start when first attempting burritos or enchiladas. Once you try it you will likely want to change some things or add some ingredients to your liking, but this is a perfect starter recipe.

Loved these. I enjoyed these enchiladas in a new and healthy way. Who said you can't eat enchiladas and still make healthy choices. These fit the bill. I added 1 cup of frozen corn to these and I mixed the cheese in with the filling. I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa and put some on the bottom of the pan and laid the enchiladas on top and topped it with the rest of the salsa and a little more cheese. Excellent. I plan to make these on a regular schedule.

LOVED this! You definitely don't miss the meat, and if you puree the beans before mixing with rice, then it's even better. My husband doesn't like beans, so I did this and he didn't mind. I also followed other suggestions and substituted veggies with salsa slightly drained and used regular enchilada sauce, along w/corn tortillas. Delicious and fast to make.

This was really good!  I wasn't too optimistic, it just fit the ingredients I had on hand.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I LOVED how the tortillas were a little crunchy on the outside.  I did use taco sauce because I didn't have any picante on hand.  I will definitely be making this again!

These are DELICIOUS! I'm just finishing the leftovers for lunch and craving more already. The only thing I did different was add a little cheese inside and on top of the enchiladas because we like it around here!

These are awesome!  Followed the tips.  To prevent sticking, I still sprayed non-stick spray and then I did put enchilada sauce in the bottom of the dish.  I had some cooked shrimp leftover from another meal so I chopped them and added to the rice mixture at the end.  Topped them all with enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  Skipped the cilantro as we are not huge fans.  These are on the permanent dinner rotation.

These are amazing. Awesome flavor. I had a 10 oz can of rotel tomatoes with chilis. Instead of using cooked brown rice, I added a cup of veg. broth and 1 cup of instant brown rice to the filling. I filled 6 whole wheat tortillas and used veg. cheese. I will be making these again and again!

I made this as the enchiladas and it turned out really good.  But then I thought why not just make these regular burritos and put the cheese inside.  So I did and they turned out super awesome.  I did cut the cumin to 1/2 tsp and used whole wheat tortillas.  I froze the burritos and they reheated beautifully in the microwave (3 min on high).  An excellent recipe...thank you

I found this recipe using the Ingredient Search.  It was a great recipe that saved me a trip to the store.  My husband doesn't really like veggies much, but after I pulsed the tomatoes and onions through the chopper and used a full bag of cheese, he was sold.  I used the cheese on both the inside of the enchiladas and as a topper.  I tried both flour and multi-grain tortillas, and flour was the hands down winner.

This is really good, but I would probably use more beans and alittle less rice next time.  I used red, orange, and yellow peppers instead of green.  yummy!

This was delicious, my husband did not even notice that there was no meat and my vegetarian teenager thought they were awesome.  The only change we made was to use the "Red Enchilada Sauce" recipe from this site in place of the salsa to pour over the top of them at the end.  The spice in the filling was perfect for us, just the right amount of zip without tons of heat. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was really yummy to me. I did make changes such as using corn tortillas and putting 10 minutes enchilada sauce and cheese on top. I served with  spoon of sour cream and the chopped cilantro. I also used diced tomatoes instead of the spicy tomatoes because my kids don;t like the spice.

These were great- after my husband had eaten 4 of them over the course of a couple days, I mentioned that there was no meat in them and he said, "wait, there was no meat in those??". LOL!
I did sub enchilada sauce for the picante & for the salsa over top b/c I couldn't find the picante in the store and also added a little bit of cheese to the filling, but other than that, kept it the same. It wasn't all that spicy b/c I didn't use picante though, so in the future I think I'd saute some jalapeno in w/ the onions/peppers. Yum, thanks!

Being a vegetarian, this recipe appealed to me the
minute I saw it, and I'm glad it did, because it is so
good. I followed the recipe exactly other than using
white rice for the brown (and only 1 cup), increasing
the picante sauce to 1/2 cup and using the "Red
Enchilada Sauce" from this site in place of the salsa.
Even my non-vegetarian wife raved about how good
it was. 5 stars and highly recommended!!!

WOW, these were incredibly delicious! The only changes I made were using a yellow pepper instead of green, and canned enchilada sauce in place of the salsa/picante. (I didn't have the original ingredients on hand). I also used whole-wheat/high-fiber tortillas (Fajita-size) and they worked perfectly! Thanks for the recipe; it's a keeper!

I cut the recipe in half and still ended up with five very full enchiladas. Rather than being stuck with half a can of leftover diced tomatoes, I poured the remainder over top of the enchiladas, in place of the salsa called for. I don't think my husband was the biggest fan, but I enjoyed this dish and would make it again.

Wow! I expected good, but I didn't expect amazing. I really loved this recipe and followed it exactly for the filling. I found that it filled nine tortillas nicely and could only fit 6 comfortably in the 9x13 pan, so I put the other 3 into a smaller casserole dish. I used the whole cup of cheese on the larger pan though, so ended up using 1 1/2 cups total - same with the salsa on top. I used fat-free tortillas though, so the calorie-count ended up pretty much the same even with a little extra cheese! Thanks for the delicious and very healthy recipe!

I really enjoyed this! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I modified it a bit.  I covered it with enchilada sauce from a can instead of salsa because I like that better.  I served it with sliced jalapenos (from a jar) on top.
My boyfriend was not pleased when I told him I was making a vegetarian dish and almost picked up a burger on his way home.  But let me tell you he REALLY liked this and was upset I didn't make more (I used a smaller dish so I had about 6 enchiladas in there that we split).  I ended up making more with the left over filling in the microwave so he could have more!  He didn't miss the meat at all and this is not only healthier but cheaper to make!
I plan to make this every other week or so :)  Thank you, Christie!

Very good, but I found the filling a little squishy. Next time I'll add some canned corn for more flavor, and a better texture. Thanks, Christie!

One of the best vegan recipes I've tried yet!  My kids even loved it, which makes it a 5star plus! I used red/orange peppers to give more color, omitted red pepper flakes, white rice instead of brown, topped with red enchilada sauce.  I made some without cheese on top (vegan) and some with - they were both devoured. Made for a dinner party of 8 with 3 of us vegetarian, and everyone raved.

These enchiladas rock!! They are very flavorful yet also very healthy. I have made the filling up ahead of time and frozen it, which works great!I also have used enchilada sauce over the top instead of the salsa.

I tried this because I love both the taste and health benefits of black beans.  I didn't have picante sauce so I added a little salsa to the bean mixture and it worked great.  I needed more tortillas to use the filling.

These are really good enchiladas, but I prefer enchilada sauce over salsa.  I used the "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce" recipe from this site, and I put cheese inside the tortillas as well as on top.

These are fabulous! One of the best dinners in my rotation. I leave out the picante and crushed peppers, and it's still great. The 2nd time I made it, I didn't have shredded cheese and used con queso instead. I imagine you can improvise all you want and these will still be great! SO easy and a definite favorite with the family! Thanks for sharing!

This is a huge hit at our house and my new favorite enchilada recipe. I sometimes add chicken. We've tried enchilada sauce instead of salsa on top and we like it both ways.

These are fantastic! I simplified the recipe a bit and instead of the picante sauce, chili powder, cumin and pepper flakes i just added a can of my favorite canned enchilada sauce.The entire family LOVED them! These are so good we will eat them again and again. Thank you so much for the great recipe!

5 star Yumms!
   My husband is diabetic, so I didn't use the tortillas, too many carbs per serving for him.  But this was great just put into a casserole dish and baked without the tortillas.  We didn't notice the absence of meat in this dish, and it was better for us.  The family requested this dish be put into the meal rotation....often. :)

I'd received some green tomatoes from a neighbor so I made the green tomato salsa on this website and used it in this recipe.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T, making a most generous sized dinner for 4 of us.  This was so good, there was only 1 enchilada left.  This recipe is a real keeper.  We all loved it!  (no-one even missed the meat!)  I've been trying to make a meatless meal every week and with this combination of beans and rice, everyone still gets their serving of complete protein!  A winner for sure!

A big surprise for us: this lighter recipe trumped the heavier, fattier ones. The flavors are excellent and there's a nice amount of heat. We used whole wheat tortillas (thanks Costco) and I used a cilantro paste with the beans. Everyone approved.

My husband does not say much about his food but
could not stop talking about how good the
enchiladas were.  I followed the recipe but did leave out the red pepper flakes.  
This has become our only enchiladas recipe.

We are a very meat and potatoes family but I am trying to get us to eat better so I tried this recipe.  It was amazingly good!  Even my 2 little boys loved it.  I did add some frozen corn and used salsa instead of picante.  Will definitely make again!

This was an exceptional dish. I did not have any picante sauce, so I added extra  canned tomatoes, as they were spicy red pepper tomatoes. I also cut  back on the cheese. Other than those minor changes I made the recipe as written and it was great. There were no leftovers. Thank you posting the recipe

I am not a big cook, and I really enjoyed these enchiladas! Without the tortillas, it could be an Indian dish (tasted that way to me!) Im saving this to use again and again.  Plus, It seems  pretty healthy for enchiladas!

This was soooo GOOD! I had to make a few adaptations to fit what I had but don't think it changed the recipe much overall.

I used some diced Poblano instead of bell pepper and green chillies. I used a home made enchilada sauce instead of picante. Left out the red pepper flakes (kids don't like things too spicy). I also added 1/2 Lb of browned ground turkey. I know it's supposed to be meatless but I'm taking baby steps with the family :). No Brown rice so I used white and I also added sharp cheddar inside the rolled up tortillas.  This will definitely go into our dinner rotation!

These were extremely tasty! Instead of picante sauce, I used an enchilada sauce, the recipe for which I also found on this site. Will definitely be making these again, but will use less rice next time--this was a LOT of rice. But we did have some yummy yummy leftovers.

These were delicious and very simple.  We used enchilada sauce in place of the salsa, but I wish we hadn't.  I really like big chunks of tomato, so we will follow the recipe better.  Served with Tyler Florence's Mexican Grilled Corn.  Thanks Christie!

Delicious! I only made one minor change, because I had a can of enchilada sauce, so I poured it over the top before baking. Turned out perfect! My very picky family went back for seconds, and the leftovers disappeared before lunch rolled around the next day.

Easy to make and pretty delicious. My husband and I prefer green sauce so substituted it for the picante sauce and salsa. It makes a lot so I prepared half in a different pan and froze it. It was just as good when we baked those two weeks later!

This is fabulous!  I've made these twice now--once as is and once replacing the spices with Taco Seasoning I.  Honestly, it was a bit too spicy with Taco Seasoning I from this site.  What's great about these is how filling they are; I only need one and it fills me right up.  They are so flavorful too--very good with Azteca tortillas.  That brand makes this recipe practically melt in your mouth.  I will definitely be making this for years to come.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was very filling, delicious and we did not miss the meat at all. We will definitely be adding this recipe to our collection.

for healthy, this was good...for a texan meat-eating enchilada lover, this was okay. I also was able to make more than the recipe said, that is, 11.

Yum. Great vegetarian meal, and I'm not a vegetarian, so that's saying a lot. What's more, all of my family ate this and liked it, which is rare for all of them to like the same thing. A keeper. I did use sour cream to soften the spice for those who needed it. Also doubled the cheese for fear 1 cup wouldn't be enough. You know,  I think it would have been okay. Not a fat free cheese fan, so I did use regular cheddar. Thanks!

FANTASTIC! so good! and it felt GREAT to know it was healthy. even though i cheated and added just a little cheese and sour cream, plus some shredded chicken i had boiled earlier in the week. I also substituted the salsa for red enchilada sauce, but this is probably my new favorite food!

I didn't have any peppers or canned tomatoes in the house when I tried this.  I sauteed the onions & garlic first then added a fresh chopped tomato and substituted Newman's medium salsa for the canned tomatoes.  I also added a little picante sauce to the bottom of the pan.  It came out great!  My husband and daughter asked that this be added to our regular dinner rotation.

Very good.  I've made this a couple times with leftover meats.  Tonight I used shredded steak along with the bean/tomato/rice mixture, leftover white rice instead of brown, and Mexican cheese.  Very good and makes a lot!  I had 8 inch shells, and I made 10 of them.    These also freeze well and can just be reheated for a quick and healthy lunch.  It's not exactly what I consider "enchiladas," but it's very good.

This was an absolutely delicious recipe!  I did make the following changes to suit our family and I feel they enhanced the recipe a ton.  First off I did not put in the red pepper flakes due to the kids.  Next, I added cilantro and cheddar cheese to the inside of the tortillas.  Lastly, and I feel the most important, was I mixed the salsa that was to top the enchiladas with one can of cream of mushroom soup to give this recipe a little creaminess.  Oh my goodness... was it delicious!!!  Will DEFINITELY make this again.  Had great flavor and texture.  Also, my husband suggested adding grilled steak to the mix next time as well.  I think I'll try it, but was seriously delicious without any meat!  Try it! :))

We loved this. I only had 4 large tortillas so I just filled them up to the brim and poured the rest of the sauce on top. I also substituted the rice with chopped zucchini and it was a hit! Will definitely make again!

Made it with the Ten minute enchilada sauce from this site instead of picante sauce. Made only 1 cup of rice instead of 2.  Good recipe,but it's more of a smothered burrito then a enchilada.

Very good; you don't miss the meat at all.   It was even better the next day.  Hubby asked to make this a regular!!!   The only thing I did differently--I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa on top.  Also topped with a nice plain yogurt and green onions.   Delish.

SO good! Changes we made: 1 cup rice instead of two, one 8 oz. bag of shredded cheddar (half in enchilada/ half on top), subbed salsa for picante sauce in the filling and used enchilada sauce on bottom and top of enchiladas instead of salsa. We loved it! Will definitely make again soon.

Wow this was awesome! I used enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan, in place on the picante, and on top of the enchiladas. I probably only used about 1 cup of the rice, and I used chicken stock in place of water for the rice. I also added cheese ( 1/2 cheddar and 1/4 cup cream cheese) in the rice/bean mixture and a little cheddar on top. I used HOT Rotel tomatos so I didn't use any red pepper flakes because it was hot enough! There was a lot of filling left over after making 10 enchiladas, but it was great leftover the next day for lunch!

I loved this! We used half the mixture to stuff enchiladas one night, and put the leftovers in the fridge for lunch throughout the week. Also threw in some canned jalapeno slices, for a little added heat. Great recipe!

I had some left over home made refried beans that I had made from black beans. I followed the recipe for every thing else. We love it. Very good flavor. My husband didn't relize there was no meat in them until I told him. Very tastey and very filling. Thank you

Two thumbs up.   My son doesn't like real spicy so I cut the chili powder down to 1 teaspoon, and left the  spicy salsa off the top of a few of them.   My wife loved them, and we didn't really miss the meat.

I accidentally bought black beans with jalapenos in them for use in this recipe. I fished out the pieces of jalapenos because I knew my kids wouldn't eat them, but the spiciness of the jalapenos was throughout all the black beans and gave it the perfect spice for my family. I recommend using a red enchilada sauce instead of salsa to cover the enchiladas if you put more spice in the rice and bean mixture.

I have made this dish many times and each time it came out great. I like to boil my own beans and use the recipe for the '10-minute enchilada sauce'  for making sauce.

This dish was absolutely amazing - my boyfriend and I commented on how delicious it was throughout the whole meal.....and the following 2 days when we heated it for leftovers.  This recipe gave me WAY more than 8 servings, but in this case we were stoked because we loved these enchiladas! I am definitely making them the next time we invite meat-eating guests. My boyfriend swears they won´t care - or even notice- that there´s no meat.

To make this recipe vegan I just used soy Cheddar cheese instead of the real cheese. I didn't have any canned tomatoes so I just diced 2 fresh tomatoes instead. Instead of the picante sauce I used salsa (medium. I also didn't have any chili powder so I used chipotle red pepper flakes instead. Delish!!

This recipe was amazing.  My friends and I try to get together every once in a while and cook and everyone LOVED it... we ate way more than we should have.  I did use enchilada sauce instead of picante sauce (thats what we had on hand) and I put extra on the bottom of the dish and a bit over the edges of the tortillas so they werent dry where the salsa didnt hit.  I also added extra cheese, but thats because we all love cheese.  It would probably be just as good without it.  I will definately be making this again!

this was a great recipe!  I used quinoa instead of rice (cooks quicker) and only 1c cooked quinoa instead of the 2c of rice.  You could vary this based on the type of salsa you use and also add extra veggies (spinach, olives, corn, etc.) if desired.

I loved this recipe!  At first, just before I added the rice to the veggies and beans, I was afraid they would be too dry after baking, but no way!  I made them exactly as the recipe states, except that I didn't have the special tomatoes called for so I just added a 4oz can of green chilis along w/regular diced tomatoes, and I used some of the salsa in place of the picante sauce (didn't have that, either).  They had a bit of a pleasant bite, but not overly spicy, and the cilantro added exactly the perfect flavor to the finished product.  Great recipe!

I was a little skeptical before I tried this, but wow! was it good.  I made almost exactly as described except I added a couple tablespoons of hot sauce to the filling.  It gave it a nice tang.  This recipe will be going into our family's dinner rotation.  We aren't vegetarians, but it's nice to have an occasional meatless dish.

This was delicious. I added pepper and onions because I had them on hand and needed to use them before they went bad. I missed the sauciness I usually associate with enchiladas and will probably try the enchilada sauce from the site, but the versatility of the leftovers made up for it. I served the leftovers over brown rice, in quesadillas, over tacos shells...

these were great! i made them with my little twist but used this as a base. I made white rice then added to it canned salsa and a little extra salt, pepper, and cumin. Mixed in some chicken for those who ate meat and filled them inside of some simple and delish low carb wraps for a dinner thats no more than 300 calories! great dish, will make it again... Thanks!

As others recommended, I substituted Red Enchilada Sauce for the picante sauce and salsa.  I added 5 oz. of ground beef and ended up with 10 enchiladas.  I decided to freeze four in an 8X8 pan and will cook them at a later time.  I thought the recipe was a little bland though my husband enjoyed them.

I made this yesterday for my huband's family.  It was ok.  Instead of using the picante sauce, I used enchilada sauce.  I did add a teaspoon of salt for more flavor.  I also used fresh tomatos and jalapenos instead of canned.  Overall the taste was good, but the filling did still seem a bit bland.  I may add a little bit of salsa on top of the filling when rolling the enchilada to add more flavor.  Still it was quite a meal.  We were all stuffed.

This was an incredible recipe.  I forgot to add the rice in at the end, so, instead, I placed the rice all around the outside of the enchiladas to catch the juice.  And it was still great.

i had to make a lot of variations due to what i had on hand/could remember to get at the store when i inadvertantly forgot the list.

i didn't have green pepper, garlic cloves, diced tomatoes with green chiles, chili powder, or crushed red pepper flakes.

i wanted to get enchilada sauce but my work only had green and i wanted red so i got a jar of picante and no salsa.

i also used coriander, cayenne, and garlic powder as well as some mozarella and extra sharp cheddar.

it definitely turned out good but a little too spicy which was probably a combo of the substitution ingredients. over all a very economical reasonably healthy,  hearty meal!

This is a no-fail recipe! Everyone that I have made this for absolutely loved it, including die-hard carnivores. I haven't changed a thing, although there is plenty of room for modifications. Make this for a crowd, or eat on it for a few days!! It's wonderful reheated!

This recipe has become a favorite in our home.  I like that it is a healthy version of enchiladas.  Also, I can't have cheese or sour cream and without those, there aren't many enchilada options!  For my portion, I simply leave off the cheese.  The filling makes enough for 12 enchiladas.  For both the picante sauce and the salsa listed I used the "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce" from this site.  For the cheese I used colby/monterey jack blend.  (for my family)

This had too much filling.  I ended up with 12 enchiladas instead of 8.  I used fat free cheese instead of reduced fat and ended up tripling the amount - I put 1 cup in the rice mixture and put two cups on top.  I also had to double the salsa as there was not enough to cover the tops of the enchiladas (maybe because I had 12 instead of 8 of them).  I will make these again, with my changes.

This was VERY delicious to the point that I've made this recipe on at least 10 different occasions!  I've made a few alterations: instead of brown rice, I used white rice and I've rarely used salsa.  Since I like my food very spicy, I've added chopped jalapeno peppers and added extra hot / picante sauce!  Yeah, it's spicy alright!!  On a few occasions, I topped the filled tortilla with sour cream!  Wow!

Great recipe! We usually add a can of corn to the mixture really adds to the flavor, sometimes we substitute the rice for browned ground beef or use both! A definate hit in our home!

Although I needed to make a few substitutions to suit the ingredients I had on hand, the spirit of the recipe remained intact.  This was very good and enjoyed by all.  Anyone who likes this should try the Black Bean Cigar recipe on this site.  Very similar if rice is used instead of tator tots and maybe even a little yummier.

Just okay...I've made better without a recipe and I don't think salsa is a good replacement for a homemade enchilada sauce. I won't be making these again.
