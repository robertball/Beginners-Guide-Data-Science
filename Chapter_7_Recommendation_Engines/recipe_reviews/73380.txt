Wow! this is not for the faint of heart or those on a diet.  The flavor is truly rich and decadent and I loved! it every bite.  To alleviate my guilty pangs I used light sour cream, lowfat buttermilk and lowfat cheese.  I was worried it wouldn't bake properly however it came out fine.  It was a big hit with my family

Very tasty. I didn't find white cornbread mix, so just used yellow. I scaled down by half and baked in an 8x8 baking pan.

This was really good!!  We had an old family recipe at Christmas called "Onion Shortbread" and this was so close to that recipe.  Very rich.  Didn't change anything.

I had tried a recipe like this one years ago and really liked it.  I hadn't realized until following the directions that this had a "topping" which was different than my old recipe.   I have a picky family and one family member who doesn't like sour cream  or onions so I hid them inside.  I only had a cup sour cream so I added about 1/2 cup cream cheese... I know huh!  My picture will not accuratley portray what this recipe should look like because I used yellow cornbread mix and yellow regular corn, not creamed, I did sprinkle more cheese the last 5 minutes. ~ Loved it! :)

I thought this was very good...a nice change on cornbread. I loved the layer of fluffy/puffy cheese on top. I used 1/2 the sour cream as suggested in earlier reviews.....I don't think it would have matter either way. Added geen chilis...awesome! Make sure you cook it all the way or it could be mushy inside.

While the flavour was quite good, two cups of sour cream is too much....seemed to overpower the texture of the cornbread.   Plan to tweak this one again, reducing sour cream.

This was delicious and decadent.  The topping remained kind of liquidy (though I only used one cup of sour cream), which was a bit deceptive when trying to determine if the bread was done.  Everyone loved it!  I also added a can of chopped green chilis.

It was good, something different to try.  My husband isn't a big cornbread fan, but he even thought it was okay.  I'll probably make it again, but I will tweak it.

Wonderful flavor, I cut the recipe in half except for the onion (used a whole one) and cooked it in a 8x8 pan. Loved it! This would be a good side dish for a holiday meal.

This was awesome. I made some chili and rice and needed something to go with it and this was perfect. I only added about 1 C of sour cream but other than that I followed the recipe. Definitely will make this one again!
