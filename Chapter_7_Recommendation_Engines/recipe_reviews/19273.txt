This is an easy, chewy and delicious cookie! However, I did have to make a couple of adjustments to the amount of ingredients for my cookies to hold together well. I doubled the amount of marshmallows from 2 cups to 4 cups  and I also cut the almonds in half from 2 cups to 1 cup. When I first tried it with 2 cups of almonds, there were so much almonds that weren't being held together by the gooey part of the cookie and they just sat on top or fell off. 
These adjustments have fixed the problem and they now hold together beautifully.
I was also told by a friend that the chocolate graham crackers work the best and so when I went to the store, all they had were the chocolate graham cracker snack sticks which I thought was worth a try. Be warned- this was a really bad idea since they weren't wide and flat enough to be a good base for this cookie. Also, I tried using wax paper instead of the aluminum foil which also didn't fare too well. The foil with plenty of Pam really worked the best. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the melted butter and brown sugar mixture (as I had seen in another Caramel Heavenlies recipe) which made it even more delicious!

I've tried several different recipes to use up graham crackers that had been around a while at my job.  This one is the best!  Everyone loves it and those that bake always ask for the recipe.  I increased the marshmallows to 4 cups and the brown sugar and butter to 1 cup.  Once out of the oven, I use an icing spreader to combine the melted marshmallows with the almonds and coconut otherwise I've found they fall off the cookie.  I bet it would be very good with pecans too.

I make these at Christmas time to give as gifts along with other goodies. My whole family loves them and they are devoured within minutes. My only tip is that spraying the foil with a non-stick spray before putting the graham crackers on helps keep everything from sticking when you try and cut them up. The syrupy mixture you put over the graham's can make a bit of a mess if you don't use the spray.

I love these...they're sooooo good! I made them a long time ago and then lost the recipe. They're a cinch to make, but very sticky.  This time I had the benefit of the review posts to learn that you MUST thoroughly coat the foil-lined pan with non-stick spray. It makes a world of difference!!!

mmmm, i love these!  i use this recipe all the time with different variations as well.  the most popular so far has been the addition of peanut butter chips with the marshmallows and the substitution of dry roasted peanuts for the almonds :)  i always use a full cup of butter and brown sugar for the caramel because we are caramel nuts in this house!  these are so delicious and easy.  i sent them to work with my husband and everyone that baked asked for the recipe.

These are so easy to make.  I follow the recipe until I get to the coconut and the almonds.  I just eyeball until covered sufficiently.  I've made this the last two Christmas's and my guests think they are truly "heavenly".

These were very sweet, but not in a bad way.  I would call these a candy.  One must spray the foil, or you won't be able to get these off of the foil.  I found these to gooey and sticky to cut, I broke into random pieces.

Everyone loved these. I used melted caramel candies instead of butter and sugar, and these tasted amazing. I have a bag of them in the freezer now, to top ice cream or just snack on when guests pop by.

I love these!  I just made them, and can't stop nibbling.  I used my pizza cutter, and they cut very easily.  I think the trick is to wait until they are completely cool....Even though it was so hard to wait!  Yummy!!!

This was amazing!  I used a regular baking dish and no foil.  I sprinkled chocolate chips before I topped with coconut.  This taste just like a samoa girl scout cookie BUT even better!!

This is my kinda cookie!!! This was a fantastic way to use up a lot of leftover graham crackers (when camping season is over and we have several half-eaten, half-stale packages) and the rest of the tub of marshmallow fluff/creme. I was concerned the creme might run all over the place but it didn't at all. I spread it over the graham crackers about 1/4" thick, and proceeded with the recipe, eyeballing the amounts of coconut and almonds. Super easy! I shared them with a lot of people and got many compliments.
I've now tried using mini marshmallows and definitely prefer the mallow cream.  it guarantees your cookies will hold all your toppings and comes out with the perfect amount of gooiness!  I also used unsweetened coconut and thought it was yummy that way, took the sweetness level down a notch so you can eat even more!!! :)

These are rich and delicious. I sprayed my foil generously with Pam and didn't have any problems with sticking. I also layered my almonds with the marshmallows and coconut, and poured the caramel over it all. Worked just fine. I didn't have any sliced almonds in the house so I used chopped ones and actually liked these a lot better. They had more crunch and added a great texture to the cookies. This recipe has earned a place in our permanent family collection.

I have made this probably a dozen times.  Use ***PARCHMENT PAPER*** on top of the cookie sheet rather than foil to alleviate problems of stickiness from the bars to the cookie sheet.  It is carried in grocery stores the same area as foil.  There is no need to spray parchment paper.  The cookies will peel off easily once cut with a pizza cutter. I recommend at a minimum having 1 cup butter and 1 cup brown sugar for the sauce.  I Also used 3 cups of marshmallows.   Every time I make these they go fast.  There is always a demand for the recipe.  Thank you so much for submitting such an easy crowd pleasing treat!!

just great but the recipe from the 50s says to sprinkle the nuts  over the cookie then pour topping which makes the mixture hold the nuts in place.  I always used pcans but his is great.

These little guys were wicked sweet!!!  I didn't have any almond slices and maybe I shouldn't of used the sweetened coconut flakes. They were good, but a little too sweet for me.

These bars are like a homemade candy bar.  The toasted coconut and almonds make them so delicious and homey!  This recipe was shared with me, and now I've passed it along to many adoring fans.  Thank goodness they are SO EASY to make, because everyone loves them!

I used chocolate grahams and replaced the coconut with mini M&Ms. Looks really cute, and should definitely be called a candy bar.

I got this recipe out of a magazine about ten years ago and just now got around to trying them out.  I am really kicking myself for that, these are some of the best cookies I have ever tasted.  They are very easy to make (my 4-year old was able to do about half the work by himself)  I was skeptical when I saw that you just laid the crackers out (I was expecting to crumb them into a crust or something) but it works out beautifully. I have made dozens of cookie recipes, and I would highly recommend this one.

The taste of this was very good but they are very messy!  I cut them on diagonal and they did not look bad though.  I put the marshmellows, coconut and nuts on top of the graham crackers then poured the brown sugar and butter mix over that and did not have any trouble with nuts or coconut falling off.  These are a lot like Magic bars, Hello Dolly bars, Seven Layer bars (whatever you call them).

Had a request to make a "caramel" dessert & found this. Had all ingredients on hand. Used a cookie sheet lined with foil & sprayed with Pam. Made sauce with 1c. butter & brown sugar & stirred constantly over med heat. Added vanilla. Used 4+ c of mini marshmallows (whole bag). Poured sauce over & added coconut (about 1/2 bag) & almonds (much less than 2 c of almonds) & decided chocolate chips would be good too. Baked as directed & then swirled everything to make sure the toppings stuck. They were loved by ALL! YUM!!

This recipe is delicious!!!  Very easy to make.  I used more crackers than the recipe called for and I doubled the toffee mixture in order to make a larger recipe.  Everyone loved them!  I will definitely make them again and again!

I've made these many times and they always turn out great. The secret it to pour the butter mixture over the crackers slowly, back and forth to get good coverage. I always use Taste of Home's recipe because 2 cups of almonds and coconut is a little too much.

These tasted sooooo good.  I would have to agree with Sundropfairy's review that you should up the brown sugar and butter because there just wasn't enough to coat the whole tray.  Maybe if I had upped the marshmallows too mine wouldn't have come out a gooey-looking mess of deliciousness.

I have been making this recipe for years (with cinnamon as someone else posted) I have gotten rave reviews every time and they don't last long. I also use more marshmallows. I really don't even measure them. I just pour them on, using enough to ensure that everything will stick together.-luv2bake

I made this recipe to use up some marshmallows, graham crackers and candied almonds that had been laying around a while.  I halved the butter and brown sugar and sprinkled chocolate chips on top.  I didn't have any coconut so I left that out.  Good recipe for a quick treat.  Thanks!

These are quick and to prepare.  I agree with the others, coat the foil with cooking spray.  My family raves over them!

These are absolutely amazing and so easy! Increased the mini marshmallows. The graham crackers on the bottom make the perfect base because they're light end crispy and balance out the chewiness of the rest of the cookie. Use any kind of nut with the recipe. I've made it over and over, but they never last long.

My kids and I used to make this years ago, then lost the recipe.  I'm so glad to have found it again.  These are truly "heavenly" and will be a wonderful addition to my Christmas cookie trays.

Took these to work and everyone LOVED THEM. I added some choco/caramel swirl chips and also some pecans because I didn't have walnuts. Be sure to spray/grease foil liberally, cause these a REAL sticky.

Top was just browned but bottom was too dark in areas, good taste, kind of crumbly when you bite in, thanks for recipe.
