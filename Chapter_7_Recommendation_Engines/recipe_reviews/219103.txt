This was so easy & super fun!! Made it for a carnival at my son's elementary school. Not only were kids grabbed by it, but parents & super-cool-I'm-not-phased-by-anything high schoolers, too!!!
I dressed the part, of course! lol   Got the witch's cauldron & my costume at our local part store for just under $20....my bf knew where to get dry ice from a buddy, so it was free...well worth the cost for all the 
fun!! Will use over & over & over!! Thanks for such a simple, yet super idea!!!!!!!!

So fun! My first time dealing with dry ice, easy peasy. The kids loved the effect and the punch tasted great too!  I couldn't find grape sherbet so I did a berry sherbet with strawberry soda.
