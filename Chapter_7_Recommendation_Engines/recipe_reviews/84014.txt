I did double the bbq sauce ingredients, and I slow cooked for a few hours.  Round steak is a very tough meat, and does well with tomatoes (the ketchup) and the long, slow cooking. After I browned it I added all the other ingredients and simmered it on the stove for hours. It was very saucy and tender.  I thickened up the sauce and served it over mashed potatoes.  It was yummy.  I think I may add some green pepper and onion when I brown the meat next time.

This recipe turned out very bland and the meat was tough.  I would reccomend doubling the bbq sauce ingredients if anyone else wants to try this one.

This recipe is good, but the first time I made it I found it to be a bit lacking in flavor.  The second time I added some minced onion and fried it with the garlic and that seemed to do the trick because now it's perfect!

Holy smokes did this ever turn out well!  I added onions in with the garlic (after browning the meat, before adding all the other stuff) and I did bake it but at a lower temp for a longer time.  It turned out great, and that's saying something considering my lack of cooking skills!

It came out tender and good. I cooked it on the stovetop covered for 30 minutes on medium low before I put it in the oven. I also added season salt and onion powder to the sauce.

We had this tonight--its a keeper!  I doubled the sauce as suggested in the last post.  I also used bacon grease instead of vegetable oil.

Yum, Yum! Followed others advice and dbled the sauce ingredients except the vinegar. Also used regular mustard, not dry.Also added a quarter of an onion with the garlic. Meat was a bit tough (not bad), but I believe that was because of the steak I bought not because of the recipe. The sauce had a fantastic flavor to it. Will make again!

This recipe was pretty good. I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce ingredients and it made it very saucy. However next time i would only do 1.5 times more vinegar b/c it turned out very vinegary. Other alterations to the recipe i made were using liquid honey mustard instead of dry mustard and added a lil onion powder and used seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I also browned the steak then added the ingredients to a big sauce pan and just simmered it covered for about an hour and a half and it was fall apart tender.

This recipe worked really well for my husband's round steak moose meat. I especially loved the homemade barbeque sauce taste! If it tastes a little too vinegary, add some brown sugar and/or honey. I added a little of both and it was the finishing touch to make this recipe perfect! I also just cooked it on low on the stove top with a lid and the meat was as tender as can be for round steak. Will make again!!

This had way too much vinegar!  I had to add more sugar and ketchup to make this edible!  It might just be an error in the recipe because it also calls for way too much meat to feed 6 people.

Pretty good - I did get the round steak tenderized at the butcher's before I prepared the recipe.  But otherwise, did not change a thing!

The recipe wasn't hard to make. I set the temperature to 350 because my oven doesn't seem to cook right when set to 325. I kept the cooking time the same. The meat came out just fine. If I could change anything I would find a way to make the sauce thicker.

This recipe had too much vinegar for our taste.  We cooked it in the crockpot all day.  We'll try less vinegar next time.

This work out great with the odd cut of meat that I had a lot of (about 2-3 lbs).  I seared it and then threw it in a pan with all the ingredients plus a little extra bbq sauce (as others recommended).  I only baked it about an hour because the sauce was becoming paste.  My husband loved it!  The meat was so tender when done.  It also made great sandwich meat.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

So yummy. I'll definitely make this again. I won't cook it as long, because the pieces on the bottom were much more tender than the ones on top which got too dry. It was also very important to double the sauce. Very good!

Nice and easy recipe to make on the quick.  After reading other lack of flavor comments, I "helped it out" by adding some ready made barbeque sauce to the ketchup mixture.  Thanks!!

I used top sirlion instead of round steak . The meat cooked up in about an 50 minutes . I had to pull it out or it would have been overcooked.
The meat was a  little bit tough but the meat was still tasty. I would make it again.

Loved it. I personally had to cook the steak about 45 mins longer than suggested to get the tenderest round steak ever!Used half the meat cause that's all I had and kept the sauce the same. I loved it and so did hubs. Served with a corn succotash and roasted red potatoes. Amazing flavors and pretty easy:)

I actually cooked this tonight for dinner and used some of the suggestions in the reviews. I added minced onions when i sauteed the garlic and i cut back on the vinegar and salt. I also doubled up on the sauce ingredients, however, it came out really well (meat was tender as could be)but i felt it was too rich. I would suggest using this on a burger bun rather than as a main dish.  For those of you who like tangy, this is the recipe for you!

This was just what I was looking for to turn a tough piece of round steak into a really great, tasty dish!  It had been a long day, so I cheated and used bottled bbq sauce.  It was too hot to turn on the oven, so I cooked it on the pellet grill outside and I was amazed at how tender the meat turned out!  I served it with a wild rice side and my husband and I both loved it!

My family and I were very happy and impressed with this recipe. I did not have any go-to recipes for this type of meat and took a chance because of the ingredients that I had on hand. The meat came out very tender and juicy and very flavorful! Prep time was also a plus!

Followed the recipe and found the meat to be a little dry so I shredded it and added some BBQ sauce and put it on a buttered Hoagie roll. One of the best BBQ beef sandwich's I've had. Next time I'll butter the Hoagie roll add a little garlic salt and toast under the broiler.

Tender with good flavor.  Next time double the sauce , used 1/2 cup vinegar , do not double vinegar, it was kinda strong. Simmered in skillet for 30 min. before putting in oven. Sauce started to burn, use 325 degrees.

I halved this recipe, and then only used about 1 pound of steaks (about 3 smallish steaks) for that amount of sauce and we all LOVED how this came out! It was tender, and baked up very nicely in the sauce. My hubby added extra bottled BBQ sauce on the side for his, for dipping. Served with a baked potato and steamed broccoli for a delicious summery dinner.

Like others, I doubled everything except the vinegar. It was delicious, and was completely consumed!

The meat was very tough and chewy, something I had hoped that the long baking in vinegar & ketchup mixture (which usually tenderize meat) would have prevented.  The sauce itself tasted good, but the flavor didn't permeate the meat, which was very bland.  (I followed others' recommendations and added an onion and doubled the sauce, but this is not a keeper.)

This was just okay. I'll probably make it again, but not often.
