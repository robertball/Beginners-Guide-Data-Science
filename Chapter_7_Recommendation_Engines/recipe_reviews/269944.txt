This recipe was awesome!  I used a chicken sausage from COSTCO that I already had (and to cut the fat), and since I didn’t have a jalapeño, so I used a whole large poblano pepper diced.  I also thought it needed some more green color because we try to get dark green veggies in our meals, so I added a couple large handfuls of fresh spinach leaves right before adding the shrimp.  Lastly, I didn’t have jasmine rice, so I used long grain brown rice instead and cooked it a little longer (maybe 5 extra minutes).  The lemon juice at the end (I used juice from a whole lemon) gave it this nice tangy flavor (don’t skip that)... the whole family RAVED!  ‘Definitely making this again!  THANKS for sharing it!

This was very tasty and the leftovers were excellent.  I used almost 4 cups of chicken stock and substituted 6oz. Tomato purée for the canned tomatoes because my son doesn’t like tomato chunks in his food.  I also used only 1/2 a jalapeño as I didn’t want it too spicy.  It turned out great, just the right amount of liquid, and everyone enjoyed it.  I’m very picky about the recipes I keep, and this one is a keeper!

this was good. i used andouille sausage and white rice and like another reviewer ended up using a bit more chicken stock and cooking the rice  longer to get it fully cooked.

I made this a couple nights ago and the only substitute I did was long grain white rice instead of jasmine rice and it turned out AMAZING! Lots of flavor and even heats up well for leftovers. We will be adding this in to our meal plans. I’d love to try it with red beans next time.

Although the flavor is good, the cook time on the rice isn’t long enough. I adjusted cooking time for rice to 20 minutes and then added shrimp.

This is a great one pot meal!  I love meat so I used one and a half pounds of large shrimp, one pound of smoked sausage and a half pound of  loose smoked sausage. I used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of three and two cups of dirty rice and one cup of of jasmine rice. This turned out excellent! Will definitely be making this again! .

Very tasty. Love the kick of the cayenne and the brightness the lemon brings. I do think it needed more moisture. I won’t drain the tomatoes next time. Yummy dish!

My husband & I thought this was delicious! Our kids (ages 7,6 &2) said it was to spicy but they ate it.  I used 1/3 salt chicken broth and a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes which I felt was the perfect amount for all of the rice. I did not have jasmine rice so I used brown long grain rice instead. This recipe makes a lot so if your looking for something to eat through out the week or for a crowd give this a try. I served this with a salad as I did not know what to serve it with being I’ve never been to New Oreleans? Thank you for the recipe!
