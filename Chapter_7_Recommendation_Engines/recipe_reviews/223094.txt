Used reduced-fat cream cheese and reduced-fat mayonnaise with no sacrifice to flavor.  Can be used as a vegetable dip or spread on crackers or small pieces of bread for party sandwiches or would be great as  a bagel spread.  However you choose to use it, it's tasty.

Delicious! I added a clove of garlic and used the food processor on the vegetables. Everyone at my party loved it as a dip, so I made more and have been using it to make sandwiches on croissants with Gouda cheese and deli roast beef. Fresh, flavorful, and not bad for you!

I used reduced fat cream cheese and mayo as well and then added 1 cup low-fat shredded cheddar.  Super easy and tasty spread for buns or crackers

I doubled the recipe for a big party I as hosting and had lots of complements on it.  I loved the recipe as it was written. I will make it again.
