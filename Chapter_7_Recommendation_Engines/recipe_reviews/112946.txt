Good when it has cooled and the flavors had mingled but it's not what I was looking for. This is more for butter mochi lovers. I felt it's missing something. I also agree with dulcemanzana to bake it a little longer for the center to set not jiggly. The best part is the slighlty crispy sides.

We liked the taste of it but i think it needs more time in the oven. Will have to try this again.

Great texture and really yummy; my only gripe is that I don't know why it called for so much baking soda as it brought on strong alkaline/sodium bicarbonate flavor. I only used 1 tsp and the flavor was still pretty strong. Next time I'll only use 1/2 tsp. and see what happens.

Tried this for the first time ever. Came out lovely. This was a big hit with my close friend and her kids because they are gluten free. I did reduce the baking soda to 1 teaspoon as directed by another reviewer.

This was delicious! I used some of the ideas from other people who commented. I added less baking soda & cooked for a long time 55min. Turned out good. Still have that liquid like softness in the center but more formed. Thanks for the share!:)

I have made other Mochiko recipes with this rice flour. With this one I did add 4 eggs instead of 2 and had to cook at least 50mins so the center would cook. Came out fine. Much sweeter cause of the extra sugar. A good recipe.
