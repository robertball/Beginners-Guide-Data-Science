Mate....Ripper recipe. I went beanless and used red onion and made my own Italian dressing but the basis is a delicious recipe of both sweetness and spice.

This is the first recipe I have tried from the site that I did not like. Very blah..not worth the amount of money spent for the ingredients. No idea how it could be improved. Won't make again.
