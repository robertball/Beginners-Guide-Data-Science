I need to clarify a few things.  First, carnitas are heavily seasoned but not flavored.  Seasoning is basically salt but flavors mainly come from condiments.  I changed out the lard for water lowering the fat content and added orange based on flavors I found in restaarants in Mexico.  American tastes have added a tremendous amount of flavor enhancers(spices, chilies, etc. to the dish).  You can make this into whatever you want.  I prefer it crisped up in a little oil after it's shredded into chunks( and a little extra kosher salt sprinkled over it.  If you want more spice add this at this time.

Fantastic! My roast was frozen solid, so I threw it in the slow cooker whole, along with everything else. Cooked it on low for 9 hours and the result was amazing. Loved the subtle orange flavor and the bay leaf added a really great earthy tone to the meat. I shredded and then served the meat in flour tortillas with lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and a bit of plain yogurt. Will make again! Thank you!

Ken, this is a winner, a five star!  I bought that huge package from Costco that contains about 15 lbs of boneless pork shoulder.  That meat is a pain in the neck to cook with because of all the fat, but it's the fat that makes it tasty, too, so I endure the misery of cutting it off.  I actually cooked this according to directions in my Magnalite roaster on stovetop, and it took two batches to get the job done.  For the first batch I used all the salt, and then the second batch I used half that amount.  For my family, it will probably rest in between the two amounts.  Otherwise, the ingredients are just perfect because one flavor doesn't outdo another, and the resulting meat is very yummy.  I made a double batch of Mexican Rice II from this site to go with it, and I used the broth from the meat for half of the recipe.  Next time I will use the broth for ALL of it because it makes a spectacular replacement for the chicken broth, adding a depth of flavor to the rice that can't be duplicated.  Now I am glad that I saved the broth for my freezer for future uses.  What a perfect recipe!  Thank you!

Unbelievable! I can hardly shred the meat without eating at least half of it!  My only changes are to use limes instead of oranges (only because hubby doesn't like them) and I also throw it all in the crock pot like others have done.  When I serve it, to give it the same "texture" as my favorite mexican restaurant, (without the added calories) I put meat on a sheet pan and throw in a very hot oven for just a few minutes. Gives it the crispy edges that I love.   Wonderful recipe Ken- Thanks!!!

Wow this was awesome!  My whole family loved it and it smelled wonderful while simmering!  I had went online to browse lots of different ways of making this; some people simmered in lard, some peanut oil and I didn't like either of those methods so I used this recipe and was not dissapointed.  I did take advice I found for adding a can of cola to the water; or you could add a can of beer.   After two hours I took off the lid, took out oranges and bay leaves then turned up the heat and let the liquid cook down; it took about 15 minutes and then I let the meat brown in it's own fat... Delicious!  Thanks for the awesome recipe Ken!:)  Tip: wait until you've skimmed fat off top before adding all the spices... they tend to float too.

OUTSTANDING!! Did add a 1/2 bottle Bass Pale Ale beer and Chicken Stock plus little water, enough to cover pork. Also used a red onion instead of white and placed it all in a slow cooker for 3 hours. Came out sooo tender and very favorful. Served with white corn tortiillas, avacado, cilantro, sour cream, chopped roma tomatoes and homemade spanish rice. Yum!! My husband ate till it hurt, now that's says alot. Thanks so much Ken!

oh - my - merciful - heavens. Here's what happened. I got a deal on a bone - in shoulder. Over twelve lbs. I really do not like to fool with great big pieces of meat. Trust me, it was worth it. It's probably 30 mins away from removing from the oven. My daughter and I couldn't resist (I mean, the SMELL is amazing) So when I went to turn it, we picked off some done parts and threw them in the skillet with onions and peppers. We ate this on homemade tortillas with cheese. (I'm stuffed) It will have taken it 6 hrs. and 15 minutes at 325. I cut the yucky stuff off. Cut the oranges, onion and 1 lime in the bottom of my roasting pan ( I would have thrown the bay leaves in here, but I didn't have any.) I made a rub of the kosher salt (and yes, there is a huge difference. It will be too salty with table salt), cumin, garlic and peppercorns. I turned it a couple of hours after sticking it in. Before it all fell apart, I got the fruit and most of the onion and pepper corns out of the broth and added another cup of water. It wasn't quite totally off the bone last time I checked, but it had been shredded into the flavorful broth and I'm looking forward to enjoying this for quite awhile. Thanks, Ken. AWESOME recipe.

This was on my menu for new recipe night and is now going into my favorites!  The only thing I did different was, after I shredded the meat I placed in a skillet with a bit of oil to "crisp" up some of the meat.  I then added some of the broth back to the meat to keep it moist.  Served with Mexican Rice II and fresh guac.  This is a keeper!

LOVED it!!!  I used pork sirloin because that was what I had.  Threw everything into the crock pot on low for 9 hours.  Shredded beautifully.  This is going to be a regular supper here!

This was delicous. I've never had carnitas before so was unsure what to expect. After tasting it, my husband said, "Ok. Fajitas with pork," and he continued with a third serving. Served with "Homemade Flour Tortillas," "Best Spanish Rice," Salsa II, and "Easy Guacamole." I can't wait to use the leftovers for BBQ pork sandwiches.

I live in South Florida, home to some amazing Mexican/Cuban restaurants and Carnitas is one of my favorite. This is a great recipe that a made as written a couple times and have since finish tweaking (after a couple years of trying) to match what we get down here and it's pretty close. 1. I juice the oranges as I found cooking with the rind adds a bit of a bitter taste. 2. Added 2 seeded and halved jalapenos (this does not make it spicy because the seeds are removed, just adds flavor). 3. Added a bunch of cilantro (I wrap/tie the cilantro, peppercorns, garlic and bay leaves in cheese cloth. this makes the skimming easier and the peppercorns wont get stuck in the meat chunks, which happened for me). 4. Added a 10 oz bottle of Sour Orange (Badia or similar, usually found in ethnic section of food market). 5. Finally our Carnitas are served crispy. I break into smaller chunks (instead of shredding) and fry in a little canola oil in a cast iron skillet on high heat so the outsides get crispy. Serve with warm tortillas and crumbled Quesa Fresco (white Mexican) cheese. One more TIP.... IMPORTANT TO COOL AND STORE IN THE LIQUID UNTIL YOU USE  (I make the day before and refrigerate over night. This keeps the meat moist. I ALWAYS make extra, freeze the meat IN THE JUICE  and it stays moist and delicious! :-)

Allright, I tried it! Even took a picture while it was cooking. Did stovetop, couldn't wait. I thought the oranges would overwhelm this, but it doesn't. Good base for making shredded pork for many, many things! Used to make bbq sandwiches, pretty tasty!

Excellent recipe as is!  Sauteed the meat with some onions & green peppers and served with Spanish Rice, using the pork broth in the rice.  The other half is shredded up, sauteed with onions, peppers & mushrooms and added chipotle tabasco sauce and used that as a filling for enchiladas.  This is a tender, flavorful meat that can be seasoned as you please in any dish.

They were amazing! I did substitute a lemon for one of the oranges and I didn't have whole peppercorns so I used ground ones, but the result was still outstanding! I put the shredded pork under the broiler for a few minutes, which gets them nice and crispy and makes them taste like authentic carnitas (I'm originally from Mexico). I serve them on corn tortillas with chopped fresh onion and cilantro, plus a splash of lime juice.

Very Good, made twice, and I liked it better in the slow cooker!! Plus dont trim the fat, because it gives it such an awesome authentic flavor that is carnitas signature trait.  I also seared the roast on all sides before putting in the slow cooker for more flavor...I only used half the orange, squeezed the juice, and left the peels in there.  I didnt put it in there in chunks either, I just let it cook on low for about 10hrs and shredded it, removed the large pieces of orange, and onion, and returned to the juices before serving.....Very good.thx!

Excellent. Juiced 1 orange first but kept the skins in the pot for flavor, added 2 Tbs of lime juice, 1 Tbs oregano, some red pepper flakes, and freshly cracked peppercorns. Only used 2 cups of water. Made it with a dutch oven; first simmer on stove top and then into a 375 F oven for 2 hrs. Remove the meat and under grill to brown and crisp. The strained broth is worth keeping; great flavor.

This is a great recipe.  Simple and tasty!  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and we all loved it but it was a bit salty.  I have found that in a four quart dutch oven with a 3 1/2 to 4 lb. pork roast, cut into 2 inch chunks, that 1/4 cup of kosher salt tastes best with 5 cups of water.  With one orange and 1/4 cup lime juice and the rest of the ingredients as written this amount of liquid just covers everything with about an inch to spare to the rim of the dutch oven.  Thank you Ken for sharing this recipe with us!

Wow. I cant believe I waited so long to try this! It is amazing. I served this with a homemade salsa verde. The broth was so yummy that I strained it and will probably use it to make rice or for a tortilla soup. I will be making this often. I just wish I had made more! Thanks Ken!!

Thank you Ken!  I made this last night as the first thing for me to ever cook in my pressure cooker.  Had I reviewed it last night, I may have given it 4 stars, but I had leftovers for lunch today, then a snack, and again now for supper and the flavors have all really developed.  Fantastic!  The only change I made was to reduce the salt because I was  only using 1 1/2 lb of pork, but kept everything else the same.  Now I have a bunch of great broth to use another day.  Thanks to the pc, it only took 40 minutes, minus cool down time.  Thank you for sharing Ken!

Ken, this recipe is a definite winner! It came out so moist, tender, and flavorful. I served it up with cilantro, chopped onion, and homemade salsa and didn't even bother "wasting" the space in my stomach on tortillias. Why would I when there was such great tasting meat to be had? Anyone that has been wanting to make this but hasn't gotten around to doing so..make the time to do it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Thank you for the great recipe Ken!****update 10/30/10*****made this again but this time in the crockpot due to circumstances. As written was better but crockpot works good too. Leftovers were just as moist and flavorful.

Awesome recipe. Very easy to make, and very flavorful. Served them with pico de gallo and corn tortillas. Even my sorta picky 6- and 4-year-old daughters inhaled this. Superb.

WOW, this was great.  Did it stove top.  The meat came out moist and flavorful.    I cooked 11 lbs of meat, enough for the tamales we are going to be making and several other  meals.  Thanks for a great recipe Ken.

Simple and simply delicious! I wanted to make this for Halloween and knew it would be a busy day so I made it in a crockpot. I left the roast whole and browned it first on all sides. Then threw it all in the crockpot with some chicken stock. On high for six hours and .... perfection. Other than browning it first and using half the salt, especially with the additional saltiness from the stock, I followed the recipe as written. Even my picky stepdaughter raved about it. Can't wait to add some Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce and try it on a "French Bread Rolls to Die For" from this site. A new favorite for sure. Thanks Ken, you are a genious!

Excellent!  I also put everything in the crockpot; no time!  When I got home the house smelled wonderful, and it was delicious!  The best part; very healthy, guilt free!  Thanks Ken.

I was craving carnitas and didn't want to fight the cliche crowds, on Cinco de Mayo.  This was AMAZING!!!  I saved the broth, thickened it with a tablespoon of corn starch, brought it to a boil, and spooned a bit over the meat....after i shredded it, and placed it under the broiler for about 5 mins, to crisp the edges.  I have to say, this may be WAY better than what I remember having in the restaurants...and I live in Northern California, so Mexican food is pretty accessible here.  I followed the recipe exactly (but added one extra orange, because mine were small), my pork shoulder was approx 3.15lbs, and there were only 2 of us...we have enough for approx 1.5 more dinners for the 2 of us.  My husband had 3 small soft tortillas as tacos and I just had meat.  Maybe it shrinks....maybe we eat a lot.  But it was AMAZING!!  Thank you so much for sharing!!  :)  Feliz Cinco de Mayo!!

i was skeptical about the oranges, but went with it. glad i did! i didn't cut up my roast, and halved the kosher salt and just put it in the crock pot all day. my family really enjoyed this for taco meat. i wasn't crazy about the orange flavor when turning the leftovers into bbq sandwiches, but my hubby thought it was great and the kiddos ate it up, so all in all great recipe. it's a keeper!

I juiced my oranges and threw in the peels. I also added 1/2 cup lime juice and some chili powder. I brought covered the rest with water and brought to a boil and cooked uncovered for 2 hours on low. Then brought up to medium and let the meat fry in its own fat. There will be some water left but it will dissolve give it about 30 to 45 min. You might have to take out some liquid like i did but reserve it in case you need to add it back. It was so good!

Wow! This was outstanding. I started with frozen pork loin, threw in a crock pot with all the ingredients sans peppercorn (don't like pepper) but added a T of oregano. I squeezed the juice out of one orange and threw the other in the pot cut up as directed. After 8 hours on low, it was cooked perfectly. I removed and shred up the pork and then placed it into a skillet with a little hot oil and turned it occasionally to crisp up a fair amount of it. Topped it with some of the juice from the crock pot and voila! So good, you'll amaze yourself! The crispy parts were the best so be sure to leave it in the skillet a decent length of time. We served with flour tortillas and typical taco toppings but the pork is so good, I could've eaten it straight out of the skillet with my fingers and might've gobbled it all but my husband and teen son were begging to share. ;-)

This was just ok for me (lol I sound like Randy on American Idol!)  The BF liked it, but I think my oranges were too big (I used two like the recipe calls for, but they were pretty big, I probably should have just used one), I think I would have liked a less citrus flavor and more cumin.  HOWEVER, my hunk of meat was pretty lean, and it seemed to dry out some, so that may have also been part of why I wasn't thrilled with them.  Will try them again though.  Thanks Ken!

I have to tell you I have been wanting to make this for some time with the reviews everyone was giving this, but for some reason it scared me to make it. Now after the finished product...I don't know why I was scared at all. It didn't smell that pleasing to me in the beginning. But it was totally out of this world good with flavor and tenderness. My commissary didn't have trimmed pork shouled..it was either bone in or out...So I choose out. And it had a lot of fat on it...I left it the way it was, and the only thing I did different just because of a time issue, was I put it all in the crockpot and let it cook all day. And it turned out great, then I had to removed all the fat....that part wasn't cool but it was totally delicious and I discarded everything but the meat...I will make this again because the meat was melt in your mouth gooood!!! Thanks KEN!!

This was awesome!  The only things that I changed were that I used 1 orange, and 1 lime in the water rather than 2 oranges.  I think the lime adds a nice tart flavor,  it was AWESOME!  Thankfully we have leftovers to eat for dinner tomorrow, because this was GREAT!  After shredding, I squirted with lime juice and added a little additional cumin, to add some citrus flavor and make it a little browner in color, cause it looked kinda pale when it came out of the water...  Great job, Ken - This was amazing!!

Ok, I did change this recipe by adding ingredients I had on hand.  I'm rating it anyway because what absolutely made my carnitas was the oranges.  That beatiful underlying citrus flavor was just amazing.  Thanks, Ken!!

So good!  So easy!  And as a bonus...economical.  I threw the whole shoulder in the crock pot & shredded later.  Note to self:  next time only get 4-5 lbs.--8 lbs was way too big.

Excellent!  I made this in a crockpot using 1 small onion and one orange (only because I have a small crockpot and couldn't really fit more than that), and reduced the salt by about half.  I probably added about 2 cups of water - not enough to cover, since I was cooking this in the crockpot.  The pork was so tender and delicious - exactly like Ken's review where it's seasoned, but not strongly flavored.  In fact, I used about a third of the pork to make sweet and sour pork tonight, and there was no conflict of flavors at all.

Instead of using water to braise the meat, I used about 3 cups of freshly squeezed orange juice. I used way less salt and cumin than it called for. Cut it back to about 2 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp. of cumin. I also omitted the whole black peppercorns and just used freshly ground black pepper to taste.

So simple!  Made it for a "taco bar" night with the family and had never made it before...everyone raved over it!  I personally would have liked a little more "mexican" flavor to it, but I guess that's what all the fixin's are for anyway!

These carnitas are great.  After shredding, I like to fry in oil with sliced jalapenos.  We serve in corn tortillas with chopped onion, cilantro and avocado.  Refried Beans Without the Refry is a great side dish for these carnitas!

The orange gave it great flavor.  Nice contrast with a spicy tomatillo sauce rolled in a tortilla.

DH loved this and rates it a high 5.  I liked it, would have rated it a 4 myself.  Slight changes-I halved the recipe, made it in a 2-quart crockpot, using cubed frozen pork, no water, used 2 garlic cloves instead of 3 (personal taste).  Cooked it on "high" for 2 hours, then on "low" for one. Shredded the pork and returned it to the juice that formed in the crockpot for another hour.   We don't eat much pork, but DH is already requesting I make this again.   Thanks for the recipe, Ken.  8/29  Used the leftover pork & rice to make  pork enchiladas-the taste is even better the second day, and I have a new "taste" for work.  Thanks again!

Ken, you are an absolute genius when it comes to pork recipes! This is fantastic!! I used my crockpot and I used one huge orange and one lime like some of the reviews said. I crisped up the meat with olive oil in a skillet and topped with a homemade Colorado sauce. 'Nuff said...this recipe is a keeper!

Holy Guacamole! This is some fine stuff! Just kicking myself that I waited so long to make it! Only change was to cook it in my slow cooker - recipe exactly as written. Smelled fabulous and tasted even better! Made Mexican Rice II (Using broth from this) and Refried Beans w/out the Refry. Had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner over the last couple of days! And told DH I'd be content to eat it every meal from here on out!YUMMY!!! Thanks, Ken!

This was good, but probably not something that will become a regular meal in our house. I think most of the little things here and there I didn't particularly care for were due to the cut of meat rather than anything to do with the recipe or the method. I know fat is what makes meat flavourful and tender but I don't much like really fatty cuts. And it was darker in colour than I usually like pork to be. But it had nice flavour, smelled amazing while cooking, and was nice and tender. And my picky brother ate it all up (with sweet baby ray's) and said it was awesome, so you know you've got a good dish if he gobbles it up. I'd make it again, but probably with a different cut of pork and with cutting back a tad on the peppercorns, the peppery flavour came through a bit too strong for me. But pretty good! I see how this gets rave reviews: easy, cheap and good.

Another home run for Ken!  Dee-licious. I had a 2 lb pork butt (which Ken kindly informed me was the same as shoulder) and threw in the bone as well when cooking.  I halved the salt because I had less meat but kept everything else the same.  Served with Tomatillo Guacamole (from this site) and took Ken's recommendation of frying it in a bit of oil. Man was it delicious.  I made plans to make BBQ buns with the leftovers but we loved it so much in tacos we might just do that again! THANKS KEN!

I didn't like this very much.  It was too salty and I didn't like eating the peppercorns.  They were like little nasty landmines in my food.

This was delicious!  I had a pork loin roast to use and decided to try this.  The orange gave it a nice flavor.  I shredded it and used it for enchiladas and hubby said they were the best enchiladas I've ever made.  I think the key is to cool the pork in the liquid so it really absorbs the flavors.  Next time I'm going to try it with the pork shoulder, I'm sure it will be even better!

Yummy! We really enjoyed this. Super easy to make, I threw it all in the crock pot. Loved the light citrus flavor in the meat. I served it with Mexican rice and tortillas. My boys gave it 2 thumbs up! Always a good thing :) Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is amazing! I seared to pork first and thhrew everything in the crock pot on low for 9 hours. The orange flavor makes it soo great. My kids even liked it and when my husband came home he wanted to know what smelled soo wonderful. I will be making this often.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, well I used a slow cooker because I don't have a dutch oven and they turned out great.  I also followed Ken's review and fried them in a little bit of lard ( you said oil, but we like lard) and they were just as good as the ones I buy at the store.  Thanks for the great recipe, we will be making this agian =)

Great flavor, just go easy on the salt.  I used about 75% of what the recipe said and it was just beyond my comfort zone.  Everything else was really good.  I, too, was impressed with the oranges.  I wouldn't have thought to add those but they really worked.

Excellent! I doubled this recipe and made it in my gigantic stock pot. The only thing I would recommend to salt lightweights (like me) is to add 1/2 at the beginning and then any additional salt to taste at the end. The broth is fantastic! I strained mine through a coffee filter and froze it to used instead of chicken broth for pork chili. Great recipe, thanks!

2-5-2016  ~We enjoyed this well enough once it was in tortillas with a few fixings, but only because I reduced the salt to a mere one-third of the amount called for.  (And I did use the directed Kosher salt, not table salt)  Even then it was plenty salty.  Also, we appreciate the “simple” in the title, but in its simplicity we found it tasted heavily of just cumin… and salt.   We also missed the traditional step of crisping the meat up at the end, whether it’s by broiling, baking at 400 degrees for about 15-20 minutes, or briefly frying.

Grabbed the paprika instead of the cumin - I think I invented Hungarian carnitas; HOWEVER, the flavor rocked and can't wait to try them with the correct spices!  Old and befuddled, for sure!

A little salty, but GREAT flavor and super tender!  Had to boil down the juices because they were a little thin, but I'll definitely be making this again!

Delicious.. Seasoning was spot on! I had this in a whole wheat tortilla with green chili salsa, queso and cabbage. I wish I could eat more, but I have to save the rest for meals the rest of the week, I'll be making this often, that's for sure

These.Were.Awesome! The flavor was out of this world amazing and the whole family raved about them having multiple servings each! I didn't change a single thing with the original recipe (ingredients wise) although I only had half the meat the recipe called for so I simply halved the recipe to fit the amount I had. I also just threw everything into the crockpot minus the water because my pork was frozen. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Shredded it and served in a whole wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, and salsa verde. They were delicious! Thanks Ken for the delicious new recipe. We will definitely be making this again...very often!

Best I have ever had. I changed the recipe slightly. I added the following:
1) One (1) hatch pepper with seeds removed and cut into 1" sections
2) One (1) red bell pepper cut into long strips 1/2" wide.

I used coarse gound pepper (11/2 teaspoon) as I did not have peppercorns.

Cooked it in the oven at 250 degrees for 3 hours with the lid (baking dish)on and cooked it one (1) additional hour at 325 degrees with the lid off.

FANTASTIC!!!!!

Outstanding!
Used a boneless shoulder arm roast and a slow cooker.  Didn't cut it up before hand, but instead roughly shredded it after.  Other than that, used recipe as is.  No need to change or adjust ingredients at all. (And Kosher salt is a must; don't use table salt.)  I've tried other Carnitas recipes but this has the most authentic taste.  I put mine in a pan under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up the edges and used a little of the broth that it made to keep it moist (as some other users have).  So delicious, Ken!  This will be a regular in my house.

These were really good! I was sad I didn't have more left over lol. I really enjoyed the slight bitterness that the orange peel added. I also cooked this is a crock pot on low for about 8 hours, because I do not own a dutch oven. I used about 1.5 lbs of pork loin because it was what I had on hand, so which means I halved the recipe but I still used two Bay leaves, it added nice earthy flavor. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This was so great. The oranges made such a nice addition. I have to admit I cooked two pork shoulders the same day and, although I tested this one (alot;), I froze this one but I'm convinced the flavours will be even better:)

Amazing, the flavor I have been looking for in a carnitas recipe! I also cooked the trimmed pork butt whole in a slow cooker.  I kept all the ingredients as written.  Very happy with the results.

Oh WOW! This was unbelievably easy and so delicious. This was some of the best home cooking I've ever tasted. Foolproof too. I used 1/2 c lime juice and 1/2 c orange juice in place of the oranges and around 3 cups of water to cover in the pan. I used pork loin roast instead of shoulder. I was apprehensive about the salt as that is a LOT of salt, but used 3 T and it wasn't salty at all. My husband didn't care for this but that's okay: more for the rest of us! Thanks Ken in Ca. !

I don't eat pork too often, so I am glad I chose this recipe.  I followed it exactly and produced a meal that I was told was as good as any served in the taquerias in NYC.  I used the broth and an extra orange to cook rice, and made guacamole and green salsa.  The flavor in the meat is very subtle, but definitely there, so the leftovers can be used in a variety of other type dishes.  Thanks, Ken, for a terrific recipe.

Thank you for posting this recipe. I threw it all in the crock pot and it was so incredibly easy. The meat has a really good flavor. I had to substitute limes for the oranges but otherwise kept the recipe the same. I served it with Ken's  delicious Quick and Easy Corn Salsa, guacamole and flour tortillas. Everyone loved it. I can hardly wait to try it again with oranges. I did crisp the meat up as Ken suggests in his review but I don't really think it was necessary. It was good both ways.

Good basic pulled pork recipe. Perfect for taking cooked and adding to it for bbq or mexican style. A little bland, even though it seemed like I put in a ton of salt. If I made it again, I would probably add some spice.

VERY good!  I made this in my crock pot on low all day and the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I forgot to buy oranges, so I subbed limes and the result was delicious.  I also used a can of chicken broth instead of plain water.  I didn't have a problem with the recipe being too salty like others have complained about.  My favorite thing about this recipe is that it's not heavily seasoned with Mexican spices, so the meat can be used in other types of dishes, too.  We ate it wrapped in tortillas with cheese and sour cream last night and I'll be making BBQ pulled pork sandwiches with the leftovers tonight.  Awesome, versatile recipe, Ken!!

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN TODAY, BUT THIS TIME I FOLLOWED KEN'S DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER! YOU MUST TRY THIS ON THE STOVETOP!!! ALTHOUGH SLOW COOKING IS CONVENIENT, IT WON'T YIELD THE SAME RESULT. TO ACHIEVE THE CRISPY CARNITAS TEXTURE, I COVERED A LARGE COOKIE SHEET WITH MY MEAT, LIGHTLY SALTED IT (AGAIN) AND PLACED UNDER THE BROILER FOR SEVERAL MINUTES - PERFECTION! :) SHREDDED CABBAGE, PICO DE GALLO AND A SQUEEZE OF FRESH LIME WERE SIMPLE YET SUITABLE ACCOMPAINMENTS. THANKS, KEN. YOU NEVER LET ME DOWN. :-) This was just "OK" for me. I found my carnitas meat to be too salty for my liking. I thought about decreasing the amount of salt, but decided not to because the opinions on this matter were equally divided. On the contrary, my fiance thought that our meat was bland and not salty at all lol! To make this a bit more convenient, I slow cooked everything on low for 10 hours (while I was at work). Served in corn tortillas with all the fixins', Mexican rice & my fiance's AWESOME guacamole, this was a decent, no fuss meal. Thansks for sharing, Ken! :-)

I am usually nervous about trying recipes that don't have lots of reviews, but BOY am I glad I made this!  I doubled the ingredients (slightly less than double the salt), used a 7 pound boston butt, crock pot on high for 8 hours and O. M. Goodness!  I totally agree with the previous reviewer about the blend of flavors. . .so interesting and pleasing. . .so versatile. . .going to freeze the leftovers for some quick oven enchiladas.  Marinated onions and peppers in mojo sauce and sauteed them for fajitas.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!  I've had some bad luck lately, but my bad streak is over!

The name of the recipe only tells half the story!  This is not only simple, but delicious!  I did use a crockpot (easy, peasy).  And I did use a bone-in pork picnic roast (not so easy, peasy...the fat layer was a bear!).  Served this with guac, cilantro-jalapeno relish, lettuce, and black beans.  My kids were going back for thirds!

I have made several SLIGHT modifications to this recipe over the last year or so that I have used it...but not many.  You try it way it's shown and then play your own "game" with it.  Either way...you shall not be disappointed.  Worth the effort of beating up on that pork butt/shoulder!!  :)

Ohhhh, Mama!   DH said "Honey, this is a keeper!".   Didn't end up yielding the full amount, but that's because pieces kept falling into my mouth.  It's not my fault!  I swear!  But my DH even cleaned up after dinner to show his appreciation.  Thanks, Ken!  (I hate clean up)

BTW, I made this recipe following Ken's recipe exactly, as that's how I feel it should be done, not on somebody's tweaked version.

12/2/14 - Third time around on this recipe; again, making according to Ken's recipe, and now I'm mad at Ken.   Just got a "new" vehicle, which my husband was SUPPOSED to register today so I can drive it.   Well, he found out we were having Ken's carnita's tonight, and decided he's coming straight home for dinner.   Bad Ken, for such a great recipe.  And bad me for telling my husband what we were having for dinner.
BTW, peeps, use a cheesecloth or other cooking bag in which to place your bay leaves and peppercorn.   Makes life easier.

This was so simple and yet so great. My family and I loved it! I used chicken broth and half of a lager beer for liquid and I cooked it in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours.  After cooking I sauteed mushrooms and onions and then added the shredded pork.  Added some spices such as chili powder and cayenne.  One of the best recipes I have found.

I have tried this in the slower cooker as well. I do take one more step. I put it in the oven to get crisp. The orange juice makes all the difference in the world. Great recipe. P.S. I've also done this same recipe with beef. Yummy.

I would cut the salt in half and I think 1 orange would be sufficient. I give it the 4 stars because of the reduction in salt and orange. It would otherwise be too salty and the orange flavor would be too strong. One orange will give the dish a bit of orange flavor but not intefering with the flavor of the meat.

Great recipe. I've never had Carnitas before, and I stumbled across this recipe when I looked up "boneless pork dinner." I really wanted to try something other than pork chops with the boneless chops I had.

I cut the recipe in third because I only had a little over a pound of pork.  Worked very well. 

After the pork was cooked, I pulled the meat out, fished out and squeezed the oranges, fished a few of the peppercorns out as well, and then dumped the liquid into a blender and pulverized it into a sauce!  After tasting it, I hit it with a bit of sugar because *I* found it a little too sharp for me.

Served on heated corn tortillas with some shredded cheese, salsa, and sour cream with a bit of the sauce.  Super tasty.

Like I said, no idea what the real thing tastes like (so I'll have to go have some at a restaurant), but my husband says I need to add this to the rotation! :)

Very good carnita recipe.  I used all the ingredients, but cooked in the crockpot.  I liked the taste of the oranges in this and also think lime would be a interesting flavor to try.  I served this with 'Peppered Cilantro Rice' and 'Orange-Glazed Asparagus'.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ken.

Compliments are always abundant when I make this dish! I cook it in the crock pot on low for 8-10 hours to make it a little easier on myself and it turns out wonderfully.

I've made this several times and my family and friends LOVE it!  I always use at least a 5 lb roast to get tons of payoff for the work and time involved. I sear my chunks of roast in a hot pan before adding to a crockpot and cook for ~7 hours. Meat is always fall apart tender and so delicious. My newest innovation is to use the carnitas meat in tamales. AMAZING!

I've made this recipe several times now and it's a keeper just as it is.  For my taste, I cut back just a little on the salt and peppercorns.  That's just me, the charming and lovely girlfriend prefers the original recipe.  Substituting a can of cola for some of the water worked for me once, giving it some bubbling flourish in the kitchen for the benefit of anyone watching.  It is so tender, so much like what we get at SoCal taco shops.  Crisping the finished meat under the broiler for 3-4 minutes is a nice finishing touch.

This was easy and delicious.  It also made the house smell wonderful and the broth is awesome so I strained everything out of it and will use it for tortilla soup or some other dish requiring broth.   I also used the crockpot and only had 5 hours until dinner.  The meat was done and tasted great but I would have let it go longer to get the better texture.  Wonderful!

This recipe yields an excellent, flavorful pork carnitas that was very moist. I followed another reviewer's lead and used limes instead of oranges, and added more chile seasoning after shredding the meat. My guests loved it!

These were the best and so simple. I used lime instead of oranges because that's all I had. I also didn't use the kosher salt, instead I boiled it in chicken broth and added red pepper flakes for a kick. After the meat was tender, I shredded the meat and through it in a frying pan with a tablespoon of oil to crisp it up a bit.  This is going to be a favorite in my family.

Delicious! I halved the recipe. I subbed some of the cumin for whole coriander. I used a cup of beer, and the rest water to cover the pork mixture. I let it slow-cook in the crock-pot for roughly 6 hours. I've never had carnitas before (I'm not reall a fan of Mexican cuisine) and I have to say I will be making these again! The orange does something magical to the meat. When it was done and shredded, I chose to crisp it up in a tiny smidgen of oil then combined it with some "Best Spanish Rice" I'd prepared to serve with it. The meal wasn't overly saucy or highly seasoned, but it was very good. My toddler ate two little bowls full! This would be great in tortillas too :)

This recipe, as is, is incredible.  It makes the house smell amazing, and is highly adaptable to the meal you want to make, whether that's fresh tacos or a platter with black beans and rice.  I've even kept it warm in a crock pot as part of the buffet at a party.  People are amazed by the intense flavor, yet the recipe is so simple.  Placing the shredded meat under the broiler for a brief period is a good method to crisp up the edges, if you want to serve it that way.  The recipe is a keeper!

Made this recipe and followed all the directions...almost.  Did not add bay leaves or black peppercorns, but the meat came out so good!  I will make again for sure.  It was very easy with great flavor.  I did drain the meat to brown with a little olive oil and made tacos with homemade guacamole.  Yummmy!

I made this in the crock pot and it was very easy and delicious. I do think it calls for too much salt though.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was soooooo good! I did it in the slow cooker and smelling it all day made us hungry. We were not disappointed. I have a ton left over so I will be using that for other dishes. This will definitely be made many times at our house. Thanks for the recipe!! : )

These were Great. I used Limes instead of Oranges. (Didn't have any oranges) I served the pork with the onion and garlic mashed up into the meat. And used it for soft tacos. I also made a green chili sauce. It was a great dinner. Everyone was so stuffed from over eating. My husband wants me to make them again

This has become one of my families favorite dinners. We then put it together in white  corn tortillas with fresh cilantro and a good squeeze of lime. DEVINE! I put this in the slow cooker and come home to the heavenly scent. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe! I have passed it on to all my friends

I followed the recipe exactly and it was AMAZING! I am making these all the time now, it was so easy & the leftover meat worked well in a casserole. I did fry the meat to crisp it up before serving. Served with guacamole, next time will make Pico de Gallo, too. We thought it was salty, but not overly so. I can see why some people thought it was too salty, but we loved it that way! Great recipe, thanks Ken!

This dish was delicious!  I cooked my meat in a crock pot on low for 8 hours.  I added chicken stock instead of the water and I could only fit one orange into the pot because they were HUGE oranges.  I also cut back on the salt.  The meat came out fantastic....I like how it was lightly seasoned so you can use the leftovers in another dish.  I will be making this again Ken, thank you!!

I fixed this for dinner last night and it was so nice.I put it in my cast iron dutch oven and it got done way sooner than I thought it would. Meat was so tender and shredded so easily I had it on the table in no time. Loved the oranges in the stock and the fact it wasn't over seasoned while cooking. Made barbequed pork sands with it last night and will use the rest 'crisped up' as you say. Thanks for a really nice recipe, Ken. Will make it again.

Very nice flavor.  I followed the directions exactly except I put in the slow cooker for about 5 hours on high.  Shredded nicely.  I liked the flavor infused by the oranges but it wasn't overwhelming.  Thanks Ken for a great recipe!  Cheap but delicious.

Very good, very easy, very tasty.  I put a bone-in roast in my crock pot, filled with ingredients as directed and it all fell apart at dinner time.  Nice flavor; six year old DD could not stop raving about how good it is.  Thank you for sharing Ken!

Phenomenal! I popped everything in the slow cooker (including a frozen hunk of pork shoulder). I only had one orange so I substituted several calamansi fruits for the other orange. So good! My husband loves it.

I followed CookinBug's lead with the slow cooker. I was still able to trim the meat after it was cooked, and boy, was it tender! I served it with flour tortillas, avocado, tomato, and a splash of lime juice. The next day I pan-fried the leftovers and my kids gobbled it up almost before the table was set. A real winner!

Pretty good when you eat right away, but we had leftovers & froze for a couple more meals.  We ate one of those last night & it wasn't that great.  I think I'll stick with the Slow Cooker Carnitas  from now on unless I reduce the recipe even more from 5 servings to maybe 2 or 3.  Won't freeze this again & don't know if we'll even be able to use the others in the freezer.

We used this recipe for a "drive-thru dinner" fund raiser. Instead of cutting the meat and putting it in a dutch oven, we put the whole pork roasts in large pans. We then put water about half way up, covered, and cooked at 350o for 2 hours. They came out perfect. Although we gave an option of salsa or bbg sauce, the meat really did not need it. The flavor was great. My boyfriend who is picky made sure I saved this recipe.

Super economical AND delicious for the weeks when I have to stretch my dollars. I made a double batch, stirred in BBQ sauce to taste and served it on buns for a party. Guests cleaned up every bit and raved about the flavor. This might be my favorite recipe from ALR.

It is a little on the salty side, and it is not carnitas.  Flavor is OK if you don't call it carnitas.

Reduce salt by half but otherwise amazing. I love how flexible this meat is. I can use it during the week for tacos and then for fried rice. I like making it on a Sunday and enjoy it throughout the week.

Here another way to cook the pork ... preheat oven to 250 then cut slit at different points -top, side and bottom then place whole clove of garlic into slit rub with olive oil with salt and pepper all over place in large baking dish- fat side up then cover with foil cook for 10 hours.  If you a little crisp turn oven to 350 put some of shredded pork on baking dish for a couple of minutes.

This is good, but to reduce fat more, I use  pork sirloin roast which is much leaner than pork shoulder.  Also I cook it in a crock pot.

This has been on my list of recipes to try for years, and I've been missing out!  Delicious!  My daughter had to make a Spanish recipe for class, and we decided to do this--plus my friends and I were having a party where Mexican food was on the menu--double duty!  We made this twice in one week and LOVED the flavors of the pork.  Serve it on corn tortillas with shredded cabbage, tomatoes, & Amy's cilantro cream sauce (recipe from Allrecipes) and it was FABULOUS!!

Wow, Wow, Wow.  This smelled amazing all day (I put it in the crockpot) and it turned out incredible, the whole family was raving about it.  I did add half a lime and cut the Kosher Salt to 1/8 Cup, but other than that followed the recipe to a T.  I did not add any liquid since I cooked it in the crock.  The pork fell right apart.  Thank You Ken.

My family and I really enjoyed this. My two year old chowed on it, and he has been stubborn about eating anything lately. It was very moist and flavorful.
The reason I give it four instead of five stars is because it was too salty. I used table salt instead of Kosher salt, and of course AFTER I cooked it I read a review informing me that table salt would taste too salty. I guess it's sort of my fault, but it would have been great if that advice was somewhere in the recipe.
When I realized how salty it was, midway through cooking, I scooped out some of the broth, though it pained me to remove all of that other flavor, and I just added plain water. I also added a little brown sugar because sweet and salt complement each other. I added just enough to cut the salty flavor some, but not enough to make it taste sweet. This salvaged it and the meat tasted perfect.
Other adjustments I made were adding cayenne and fresh cilantro, and when it was cooked through I poured out most of the broth and put it in the oven for a few minutes to crisp up the edges, then I pulled the pork.
I also made a gravy for it with a roux and some reserved broth. That was way too salty as well, so I had to add more water and sugar. It was awesome. That gravy was a total experiment and I was fully prepared for it to fail, but it was really good.
Served with slices of avocado and tomato

Anyway, if you're like me and you don't have Kosher salt on hand, then use less table salt than you would if you had Kosher.

I took a reviewers idea to use orange juice instead of water. I forgot to put the quartered oranges in the pot, but I didn't miss it. The last half hour, I then put in the aromatics. Yummy!

I read all the reviews good and bad, yes All ! it was my first time cooking this and I already had concerns about the amount of salt and whether the orange rinds would make the meat bitter. BUT it turned out delicious!  I adjusted it for our taste as follows:  fOR 2.5 pounds meat (I did not cut in pieces) I added 1 scant tablespoon salt and 1/3 teaspoon cumin and 1 small orange. I cooked for exactly 3 hours and it was delicious and melt in your mouth tender! I will freeze the extra portions for tacos enchiladas, sandwiches and omelets. Totally Yum.

This was extremely easy to make and the results were excellent!  When it came to seasoning, I did not measure the salt, cumin or peppercorns, just added per my taste.  I will definitely make this one again.

I love carnitas and these were very good.  I did not have any oranges so I used 4 T. orange juice concentrate (I doubled the recipe because I had a 7 lb. roast) & I cooked it in the crockpot with very little water added. After it was done, I strained the juice from the meat and let it set overnight and skimmed the grease from the top.  I used the broth to make the Mexican Rice II as someone else suggested (which was also very good).  I sauted a quartered onion and some halved jalapeno's in some oil and served it along side rice, pork, refried black beans and flour shells. This is one of my favorite ways to cook pork because the meat can be used in so many ways...BBQ pork sandwiches, burritos, tacos etc.

Soooo delicious! I followed the directions except used a pork loin added some fajita seasoning and cut back on the salt. Made these into tacos with onion, cilantro and lime. Boyfriend was eating these up faster than I could put the tacos together!

I changed this recipe a bit and it turned out great!  I used what we have on hand; pork tenderloin.  I placed everything in the crockpot and cooked 4 hours on high and 3 on low because the meat was frozen.  If it was thawed I would do 8 hours on low. I added chicken broth and cut back the salt a bit.  After it was fully cooked I let it cool and shredded the meat.  Then add some oil to a pan and fried up the shredded meat for about 10 min. or until you get the desired crispiness.  I also spooned in some of the broth from the crockpot to help keep it moist.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Delicious even though I used a pork loin and cooked it for 6-8hours. My only change for next time will be to use a lot less salt. I'm not used to eating anything that salty! (hence 4, not 5 stars) I will probably cut the salt in half or by 2/3. The orange, cumin and bay leaf really come through nicely, but not overtly once finished. 

Also, I would use more more onion (to serve with the meat), a little low sodium vegetable or chicken stock, and take out the oranges after a few hours.

The recipe provided here is great!  The only changes I make are to 1) brown the meat before simmering, 2) use only 1 tbsp salt, and 3) shred the meat and put it in a pan on med-hi for 5-10 minutes before serving.  Also, if I'm eating these without sour cream or other fixings, I like to add bbq sauce to the final product.  Generally, I find that carnitas recipes are very forgiving; excepting cumin, all of the flavorings are easily substituted. For instance, if you don't have oranges, no problem! Add orange juice, or limes, or whatever strikes your fancy to the broth and the final product will still be delicious.

This a really flavorful way to cook a pork shoulder.  I had a huge shoulder that I had to trim away from the bone, so I just guessed that I had a little less than double the amount of meat called for.  I doubled all the ingredients, but I used only 1/8 cup of salt, just because I'd rather have to add it later than have used too much to start.  And, I only had one ginormous orange.  I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 8 hours.  This really turned out so great!

This is what I did with the remaining half pork loin. (Half this recipe; half "Milk Braised Pork Loin" from this site). I honestly didn't expect us to like this, because we're not really pork fans, and because I had to do this in the crockpot and did not get to do the "pan fry in oil" step. But we did like it! I omitted the salt entirely but used chicken broth in place of the water (half a cup is all I needed to use). I served this on tortillas, with sliced red bell peppers, chipotle salsa, cheddar cheese, and Chipotle Tabasco. I will add a diced jalapeno in the future, because everything is better with a jalapeno! Thanks for a great pork recipe, Ken!

Last night was about the 4th time I've made this and figured it was time for a review. This time I had only one orange and one lemon. Used both but added 1 TBS. brown sugar (because it was the 1 orange, 1 lemon thing) and it was as good as it was the first time.  I have no idea how many copies I've made of this recipe for guests who had to have it.  We love it crisped also. Just wanted you to know how special this recipe is and I always look forward to the next time we have it and can share it with friends. Thank you!

Loved it, loved it, loved it.  I think next time I will add even more garlic & salt.  When it comes to Carnitas, the more garlic & salt, the merrier.

These were extra simple since I had some shredded pork already in the freezer.  I put it in a pot with the spices and let it simmer for a while.  I didn't have an orange so used mango instead.  Kids shoveled the pork in.

This was my first time making carnitas and wanted something that was kid-friendly and easy to prepare. Got a winner here!!! My daughter loved it so much she kept coming back in the kitchen to taste while I was shredding it. She didn't want any other dressings on it, but just a tad bit of sour cream. Usually it's packed with sour cream and cheese or use bbq sauce because it was so tasteless.

This is the 2nd time I have made this. As CookingBug suggested I place the whole frozen roast in my crock pot and cook it overnight on low around 10 hrs. I also only use 1 orange and it still is very flavorful. I portion the cooked pork in containers and freeze them for easy and inexpensive meals. Can't wait for tacos tonight and bbq pork pizza, tamale casserole, and pozole for future dinners. I will be making this often. Thanks Ken :)

These are soooo good! I have made these a few times already...I do it in the slow cooker, and it is so flavorful and tender! I like to serve with carmelized onions and homemade guacamole. Definitely try these- you will not be disappointed!

this was easy and delicious. i did a little less than the 1/4cu salt and used a 4lb roast whole and frozen in the crock. also put another 1/2 orange in there. took my crockpot about 7hrs on low(mine cooks hot). oh the other thing i did was flip the roast about 3 hours in. didn't trim the fat off. just a fantastic meal using a 5$ piece of meat!

I made this in the crockpot overnight and it made the house smell wonderful!  The pork just melts in your mouth as my hubby says!  I plan on taking other reviews advice and frying up some of the pork before serving with tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and green onions... YUMMY!  Thanks Ken for a great recipe!

After all the awesome reviews on the Recipe Exchange I finally got around to making these and wonder what took me so long?  These were wonderful.  Easy and really good!  I did have to use limes due to DD's allergy and I made these in my slow cooker.  Husband and son gobbled this up and my hubby was  excited about taking leftoves for lunch.  Thanks Ken for an awesome recipe!

Excellent recipe. I ate 2! Will definitely be making this again. The only complaint other family members had was that by the time they put the salsa, cheese, and sour cream on, the meat was cold so I think the next time I will try putting the tortilla in a frying pan and add the toppings so they can warm up a little. Have leftovers so tomorrow night will add barbecue sauce and have pulled pork sandwiches. Great recipe Ken, thank you.

Made this for our super bowl party. I would be curious to try it with lime or some other citrus. It was very easy to make. I had to use a pork loin roast because that was all the store had and it still worked great. It was a litte salty for my tastes so next time I think we will cut back on the salt a bit. Made the house smell amazing :)

Delicious!  I put all of the ingredients in a slow cooker for 9-10 hours. That's it! Then layered the meat on a flour tortilla with peppers, salsa, and shredded cheese and quickly broiled this so the cheese melted.  Added a touch of sour cream. YUM!

It was very tender, which is a huge plus, but I felt like I could taste the citrus which wasn't quite what I want in my carnitas.  Still defintely worth trying and would make excellent pulled pork sandwhiches.

This was excellent.  Even those in my family that don't really care for pork loved it.  I couldn't get a pork shoulder or pork butt, so I used a pork loin roast.  Next time, I will wait until I have the shoulder or butt, because the loin tends to get a little dry when cooking with this method.  The only change I made was to throw a few cloves in with the other spices, because the carnitas that I have had before definitely had a hint of clove in them.  This certainly was not a necessary addition, and I don't think it really changed the taste of the dish.  Served it up with peppers and onions, guacamole and sour cream, and it got devoured. It will definitely be a keeper in my recipe box.

This is soooo good! I used a stockpot, and seared the roast on all sides first. This may or may not have been necessary, but it is just what I usually do when making a roast. This recipe was very easy to prepare, and the roast was so flavorful! Everyone went back for seconds.  I used about half the amount of salt, and I cut back to one teaspoon on the cumin. After shredding the meat, I poured some of the broth over it for moisture and extra flavor. Thanks, Ken from CA, for a great recipe!

4 stars because I altered recipe since I had bone in my 7 1/2 pound pork butt and couldn't cut into cubes. Also thought it called for too much salt.  Somewhat doubled the spices, except for the salt...reduced it to 2 Tbl, which was plenty. Didn't have oranges, so used 1/2 cup OJ and hot water to cover.  Cooked in crock-pot on high for about 4 hours until reached 190 degrees. Cubed meat would be great, because the outside seasoned part is better than the inside.  Sieved and poured juice on shredded meat. Saved remaining sieved juice for broth.  Delicious!  Everyone in my family loved it!

Made this as written and wouldn't change a thing! Easy and delicious with plenty of leftovers. I love pan-frying until crispy and serving in tortillas with Salsa Lisano. It's a favorite of everyone I've made it for.

Love it! This was my first attempt at carnitas and was not disappointed. I followed the recipe as close as possible only leaving out the cumin, as I didn't realize I was out (and I know will only make it better). I bought @5 lbs of meat so I used my electric roaster which worked perfectly. We used part of it to make our own burrito bowls and will probably have tacos next. Mmmmm, pork carnitas tacos...

I follow this recipe exact and my family LOVES it. The only thing I do different it once the meat is shredded I put it on a pan and in my oven on broil until the top is crisp that way we have some softer meat with crisp meat. Then we make the carnitas according to taste usually with cilantro, avocado, and some hot peppers (habanero or what ever your heat preface is). These are amazing. I like them more on corn tortillas which is healthier (bonus).

Awesome pork shoulder recipe! We make this in large batches, portion and freeze in vacuum sealed bags. This is a perfect base for many of our staple meals, tacos, burritos, pulled pork sandwiches. Use as is or add your favorite BBQ sauce. The recipe is spot on and the taste is amazing!

I LOVE this recipe. It is so great for serving a group of friends. I have made many times and it never gets old. Sometimes I fry it up in a little oil in a skillet to make it crunchy, which is how I like to eat pork tacos.

I loved these! I followed a few other readers in some modifications. I used pork loin.  I used 1 Tbls kosher salt and about 1 Tbls salt substitute just to cut down on sodium. (It was still a tad salty.) I added 1 Tbls mexican hot chili powder, used fresh cracked black pepper instead of the whole peppercorns. I used limes instead of oranges, and added 2 packets of sodium free chicken bouillon.  I cut the pork into good sized chunks, about 2.5"x2.5"x1" and cooked per instructions. When they were done, I dumped out the broth into a container (not sure what to do with it, maybe freeze and use it later.) And oh my, if you haven't tried this, forget the forks, take your hand mixer to the meat to shred it! Never again will I use forks to shred!! I tried, like other reviewers suggested, heating up a little olive oil and tossing the meat in. It didn't get crisp, but browned some of it for a nice flavor! I will definitely make this again!

I usually make a double batch of this using a nine pound shoulder roast, bone-in. Peeling the oranges before boiling makes picking through the meat much easier later, as does trimming off the outside layer of skin and fat (save those pieces to grind later for sausages). For best results, pan fry this in batches in vegetable oil so the meat crisps up beautifully; I then prefer to serve it in burritos with sour cream, black beans, rice and fruit salsa. Setting the broth aside and reducing it over medium heat makes for a delicious liquid in which to steam the rice.

Excellent recipe!! I made this with some steaks instead of the pork and it was amazing! Kids and husband were all impressed. After I shredded the meat, I put it in a pan on broil for about 10 minutes. I rotated the pan and drizzled the juices over the meat to keep it moist. I removed the orange slices about 2/3 of the way thru the simmering process.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used one orange and two key limes.  The citrus added a subtle but important flavor.  Be careful with the salt that you use -- if you only have table salt, use half the amount (1/8 cup).  My cut of pork included the bone.  After cutting off the majority of the meat, I included it in the slow cooker with all the rest.  Probably helped with the flavor.  Thanks to the reviewer that suggested putting the meat in a very hot oven for a few minutes just before serving.  Loved the crispy texture.

I must have made a mistake. Since the recipe called for 2 oranges quartered instead of 2 peeled oranges I threw the quartered oranges in peel and all. The flavor of the orange peel was over powering in some of the meat. I also used my pressure cooker, which may have compounded the issue. Did anyone else do this?

After it is boiled, split it in half and heavily dose it with garlic powder. Then bake it for a half hour before shredding. Not much more difficult, more traditional and more flavor.

The pork was excellent after it had been simmering for 1-1/2 hours.  After it cooled in the broth for an hour, it turned incredibly salty.  I would recommend skipping that last part.

This is the bomb!  I have already made this 3 times!  As others, I read a lot of the reviews and went with using limes instead of the oranges.  I also cut back on the Kosher Salt.  I use chicken broth in place of the water.  Cooked in my dutch oven on my stove top as directed.  Any left overs get frozen to use for camping when in need of a quick dinner!

This recipe is wonderful!  I changed up the spices a bit, threw in cilantro, bell pepper, serrano pepper. I too crisp it up in an iron skillet with a little bit of oil.  Serve  it on corn torillas with pico, more fresh cilantro, sour cream and avocado.  The broth is fabulous to use in gumbo!  I have many containers of it in the freezer!  YUM!

This was awesome!  I got many compliments from the gallery..  I have compared this to carnitas that I've ordered from a few restaurants, and this is much tastier.  I would highly recommend it.

Wow, outstanding!  I cut the salt in half and it was perfect for my taste.  Looking forward to making it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Meat was very tender.  To give the meat a more authentic carnitas taste I sauteed it in canola oils with jalapenos and cumin
