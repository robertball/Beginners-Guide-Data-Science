This was really good. I added four strips of cooked and crumbled bacon and used mayo instead of sour cream. I might cut back on the curry a bit next time. Thanks Yvette!

I made this with a pound of peas, and 3/4 pound of cheese, but I still kept with the one tablespoon curry powder and one tablespoon dill weed, AND IT WAS INEDIBLE.  It was too incredibly strong.  What's worse, it was the first time I'd made it, and I made it for a party, now I'm sure everyone who had some thinks I can't cook worth a bean! Perhaps the originator of this recipe meant to say ONE TEASPOON?????  and not ONE TABLESPOON???

This turned out rather bland and thick when I followed the recipe exactly, but a squeeze of lemon juice made all the difference in the world.  Next time, I'll substitute drained plain yogurt for at least half, if not all, of the sour cream, and add a liberal dose of lemon juice.  With the added tanginess, yum!

Great pea salad.  I didn't have any curry powder handy, so had to omit.  Also, I had to use some lemon balm vinegar that I had made this season instead of balsamic vinegar.  Still.... this came out VERY good!

This is absolutely delicious. I used a sprig of fresh dill and used sliced cheddar cut into pea size pieces so that everything's the same size. Don't know what curry powder really is, so I used Garam Masala. And substituted plain yogurt for sour cream as I had none on hand.Thanks for a great recipe.

My mom used to make something just like this.  She cut out the onion and spices and added chopped celery.  It was so yummy.

I made this a few years back for my husbands pot luck at work .. It was a hit! The only thing I have added consistantly through the years is sea salt to taste and chopped, sweet ,red pepper.

If an easy pea salad is what you want to make, then this is the one you need to make.  It also tastes like more work went into it than actually did.

We really like this, likely because we love curry!  I added a couple of strips of crumbled bacon, just because we also like bacon!  I made this with a 16 ounce bag of peas, onion powder (not a fan of raw onion in a salad), and shredded cheddar instead of cubed.  Will definitely make again!

12.4.15  I think this recipe would work better with 16 oz of peas, as  the other ingredients will dwarf and overpower this quantity of peas.  Basically, I cut back all of the ingredients for 10 oz of peas to suit my personal taste preference.  Youâ€™d better be a lover of curry powder because at 1 Tbsp, that will dominate the flavor.  On the positive side, all ingredients in this recipe work well together.  Would recommend that you start out modestly, taste, and just adjust the seasoning as you go.  I used reduced fat cheddar and reduced fat sour cream with no detriment to flavor.  I'm not one to modify somebody's recipe the first time, but felt it necessary in this instance.  My rating is based on the changes I made, not the recipe as written,
