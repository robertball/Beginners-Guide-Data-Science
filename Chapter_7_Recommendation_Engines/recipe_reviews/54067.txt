I chose this recipe based on its ingredients. Overall it was delicious and very satisfying. A few comments:

Taste: I could tell from the recipe that if I made it as printed, it might be a bit bland. So I added garlic to the beef/onion mixture, and I also added chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder. 

Prep time: It took me a LOT longer than 15 minutes to prepare. I don't cook every day, but I've been cooking since I was a kid, and I am pretty comfortable with a potato peeler and chopping knife. Unless you are quite a chef, count on maybe twice as long for prep.

Covering: I wish I had left it covered for more than the first hour... the top did get rather dried out. But maybe my oven is too hot.

Tomato soup: This added a really good taste! But it didn't go very far. Next time I might use twice as much.

This is a really wholesome recipe, and it gives you a lot of opportunity to modify it the way you like. In addition to the spices, I melted cheese on top at the end of the cooking, and I served it topped with some sour cream. Yum!

This is a very good recipe. I did not have tomato soup so I used a can of tomato sauce and a can of rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilis) I am also lazy so I did not peel the potatoes. I think next time I will cook the bacon before putting it in the oven because it was just a little greasy. Over all a good dish.

This recipe was a huge disappointment. It has potential but needs changes; if I ever make this again, I would mix the tomato soup throughout the meat mixture since only the top had flavor and the layers below were dry.  I would also coook this on a much higher setting like 425 since the potatoes were still hard after an hour of baking on 350.  The only redeeming quality was the flavor on the top where the soup was poured on.

From the "author":  allrecipes takes "liberties" with the recipes, which is fine but if you want it to be the way I make it...  I do not cook the ground beef and onion before adding to the recipe, and the potatoes are peeled and sliced approx 3/16" thick, not diced.  It goes:  Mix finely chopped onion into ground beef.  Put a layer of half of the sliced potatoes, then half of the ground beef/onion mixture pulled into marble sized bits and scattered over the potatoes, then half of the kidney beans with juice, then salt and pepper, repeat layers.  Top with condensed tomato soup then bacon slices. Then bake as directed.  Hope this helps...

I chose to leave out the bacon.and used prepared frozen hashbrowns to save time. Added some garlic and spices and served with a dallop of cream cheese on top. It was a hit with my husband.

I made several adjustments to the basic recipe.  I used only 1 pd of hamburger.  I also used 2 cans of condensed tomato soup. I used one huge can of kidney beans and one regular sized can.  I melted cheese on top of the casserole toward the last 10 min of the recipe and then used the broiler for 5 min to crisp and brown the cheese.  We love garlic, so I put a whole lot of that in there.  I threw in a bit of chili powder and ground cayenne pepper as well.  Turned out delish.

This recipe was tasty and easy.  I liked it because it calls for ingredients that I usually have in my house.  My husband added hot sauce to his to spice it up a bit.  Very good.

This recipe was very easy and delicious. I did add galic, cumin and chilli powder as some other reviews suggested. But also added diced tomato to it . Will make this again.

I must diagree with the other reviews.  While this recipe is great for quick prep I found it to be rather tasteless and has a very unappetizing appearance.  Sorry, I will not be making this again.

delicious!! Although I would probably do like someone stated and that is add more tomato soup so it's not so dry. I also added cheddar cheese and fried onions instead of the bacon.

I made a number of modifications, but this gave me the basis for a GREAT recipe! This is like a baked potato smothered in chili topped with cheese and sour cream - YUM.  I diced the potatoes (did NOT peel), sprinkled with Wahoo Chili seasoning and salt/pepper, layered with ground beef/onion, then whole can kidney beans, 1/2 LARGE can tomato soup, then repeated the layers. Cooked covered for 1.5 hours, then generously sprinkled shredded cheese on top and cooked for another 15 minutes uncovered. Served individual servings with cheese, sour cream and spring onions on top. Skipped the bacon altogether, but that would be great too. A new family favorite for sure!

I made this yesterday with a few changes. 1st used only 1 lb. of ground beef plus 1/2 lb. hot Italian sausage. 2nd. 1 large red onion sliced 1/8-in. thick then quartered 3rd. 2cloves minced garlic. 4th. 2 (15-oz.) cans Bush's Chili Beans (We do not like kidney beans). 5th. 1 pkg. frozen Potatoes O'Brien. Browned the meats in a skillet useing extra virgin olive oil. Removed the meats then sauted the onion and garlic in the leftover oil until tender. Then layered as directed in a 4 quart slow cooker, covered and cooked on high setting for 4 hours. Came out great and was quite moist.

This was really good, and so easy!  I keep cooked ground in the freezer already, so all I did was thaw that, do it w/ the onions, then piece it together.  All my kids loved it--the bowls were cleaned, and that spells success.

This is a great easy casserole.  I subsituted the tomato soup for sloppy joe sauce.  Wow!  It delivered a punch of flavor and was delicious. During the last 5 minutes of cooking I added a layer of crushed tortilla chips for a topping.

My family and I  really liked this recipe.  I added carrots and melted some cheddar cheese on the top the last 5 minutes of baking.  Another addition that might be good would be polish sausage.

I just made this and it was FANTASTIC! But with my own twist. I made a few changes- I only used 1 lb ground turkey, 1 can of light red kidney beans, 1 can pinto beans, 1 can tomato paste, and 3/4 a can of enchilada sauce. Poured everything over the potatoes at the bottom and topped with bacon and cheese!

This was so so good, the whole house loved it!

Very bland, but I didn't use the bacon, I didn't want the extra fat, so I guess that is why my final product ended up somewhat dry.  I think next time if I make without the bacon I will use a can of tomatoes in the liquid instead of the tomato soup.  I also added garlic powder and garlic salt to give it more taste.

This was OK.  My husband seemed to like it more than our daughter.  It seemed to me that the potatoes overwhelmed the dish and caused it to seem bland.  Maybe I used to many potatoes.  Maybe if it was made with pasta instead of potatoes.  For me there was something just a little off and I am not sure what it was.

This was one of my mother's recipes also, she loved to take it to Potlucks and always received rave reviews. I add shredded sharp cheddar cheese during the last 15 minutes of baking. If you want it spicer, add chili powder to the ground beef.

This was very good.  I added two cans of tomato soup instead of one because it would have been way too dry otherwise.  I also added about an extra 3 slices of bacon and I didn't add it until after it had been cooking for an hour.

I only rate this recipe a 4 because i think it could be made easier.  I boiled the potatoes after peeling and dicing.  while they were boiling I cut the bacon in small pieces and sauteed with 1/2 lb hamburger and onion.  I added 3 cloves garlic.  For the casserole I put the potatoes on the bottom and dumped (after straining the grease) the hamburger mixture on top of that.  I added 2 cans tomato soup on top and mixed w/ a can of corn.  I grated a little cheese on top put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 350. i just realized I didn't even use the kidney beans and it is still fantastic. It was fabulous and will probably taste even better tomorrow.  i think next time i will add diced tomatoes to the hamburger mixture.  this recipe is great start and I thank you for the idea.

I followed the instructions exactly (except adding some spices as other reviewers suggested, and I added some water) but it still turned out overly dry.  I will try to modify into a crock pot recipe, because the kids LOVED it and ate second helpings. I think cooking in the crock pot might help retain some moisture. Overall, this is good comfort food for a cold evening.

This is a good old fashioned casserole.  The bacon does get a little overdone on top..maybe bake the casserole until almost done before adding the bacon on top would help.  I used the leftovers as a base for breakfast omelets later in the week.  Turn out really impressive.

Very easy list of ingredients, easy to prepare.  Just need to make sure you have two hours of time to bake it.  Otherwise, it's a hit!!  Everybody loved it.

I'm not a big fan of ground beef so this recipe wasn't for me. My husband on the other hand loved this. I believe the word he used was "fantastic". The only changes I made were: I used 2 cans of tomato soup and drained the kidney beans. I will be making this again.

I thought this was dull, and so did my husband. Even after I added a jalapeno to the ground turkey (I substituted) and spiced it up, it still didn't do it for me. Perhaps I would give it another star if the potatoes had some zip.

I changed this recipe up quite a bit as it looked a little bland. I used stew beef instead of hamburger, added minced garlic and used tomato sauce instead of canned condensed tomato soup. To make the sauce a little richer I added about 1/2 cup of red wine. I also added sliced fresh mushrooms and baby sweet peas. My hubby is Portuguese and asked where I got the recipe from because it was exactly the same as a portuguese stew he used to eat growing up called Cacoila. Needless to say it made a big hit and will make again with my changes.

I made this for my family last night and nobody liked it. I ended up throwing half of it away. It sounded good, but was very disappointing.

I just wanted to say I have a recipe very much the same as this one except it calls for two cans of tomato soup instead of one. That makes all the difference it is never dry.

I came across this trying to find something different using a few things I had in the cupboard. I read through the reviews and came across the one from the original poster of this recipe and used what he wrote there. I enjoyed the potatoes sliced in this, paired nicely with the kidney beans. I did slice them thinly so they did cook in time stated. I also seasoned each layer with salt and pepper. I did use 2 cans of tomato soup on the top and when I poured it over I lifted around the edges of the casserole so it could seep down into it. Bacon crisped up nice. Over all we enjoyed it but next time (yes I will make it again) I think I will add some  minced garlic, chili powder and cumin. Like a previous reviewer had said this does remind me a lot of another dish called "Shipwreck" that uses rice.

I used 2 lbs of potatoes so it would fit in 2 qt casserole dish. I added 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and big pinch of tarragon to tomato soup. Be careful with bacon.  Mine burnt after 30 minutes uncovered at 350°.I thought it was good. Plenty of flavor. My husband did not like the texture because of kidney beans. I won't make it again for him. I liked it.

Thank you for this easy and so tasty recipe.  I used it as a boilerplate and had it ready in no time.  Vegetarian, so I nuked 3 MSF Griller patties and chopped them up.  Used 1 can of potatoes, rinsed and diced.  Added 1 can of  Rotel to the tomato soup and 1 can of corn, drained.  Drained the kidney beans, but did not rinse.  Used dried minced onion and garlic.  Topped with slices of Velveeta and sprinkled with black pepper.  A "cheater's version" but SO GOOD!

I wasn't sure whether I would like kidney beans with potatoes, but this was surprisingly really good. I precooked the bacon before I cooked the beef a little so there wouldn't be a big mess of bacon grease floating on the top. I would make this again!

I didn't cook the hamburger, just put everything into a crockpot and cooked it for 2 hours on high and 4 hours on low. Came out moist and tasty.

Yummy and even better the second and third day!  Like other reviewers, I like a little spice.  I added chili powder, garlic powder and cayene pepper to the hamburg and onion mixture and then used two cans of tomato soup.  I will be making this again.
