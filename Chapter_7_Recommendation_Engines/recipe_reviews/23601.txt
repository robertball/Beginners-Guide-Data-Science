This sauce is a little too thin.  To make authentic Italian tomato sauce is very easy.  For marinara sauce heat a couple of tbs of olive oil & saute crushed garlic and finely chopped 1/2 onion.  Add 1 large can of tomato puree, 1/2 can of water, basil, (additional garlic powder and onion powder, & italian spices if you wish), 1 whole carrot which you will remove before serving(this is to remove the bitter taste of some tomatoes & lessen the need to add sugar).  Cook on low for about 1/2 hour.  Add grated Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese to taste, additional salt & pepper and that's it.  Very simple.  To make a meat sauce, just brown ground beef or meatball mix, pour off the fat and add to the sauce.  You don't have to buy jarred sauce which is loaded with sugar and thickeners.  If you really need a sweeter sauce you can add some sugar, but I never do.  The jar sauce is just too sweet.

and I  believe the cheese sauce is velveeta or cheese wiz.  I use grated italian cheese. Can't imagine using cheese wiz!

I tripled up this recipe, but used 1 part tomato paste for every 3 parts sauce to make it a little thicker. I also used an extra clove of garlic, some garlic powder, basil, and a bay leaf. The recipe by itself isn't outstanding, but it puts you right at the point where you can do some fun things tailored to your own taste.

This was really good!  My youngest daughter even said "it smells just like the jarred stuff".    The whole family liked it.  I substituted 1 1/2 tbsp grated parmesan cheese instead of the prepared cheese sauce and also added an extra clove of garlic (garlic lovers here).  The only complaint?  There wasn't more!  I will definitely make this again but will double or triple the recipe.

This was really good. I added zucchini, mushrooms and beef. The beef really sucked up the juices, I would maybe add a little more water and tomato paste if adding beef. Great flavor, recommended!

I was out of oregano so I just used Italian seasoning instead.  Used this sauce for homemade chicken ravioli and it was great!  Super easy recipe that you can get going while you're doing other things.  Fabulous for a busy mom!

I cooked ground chicken with the garlic and onion then added the tomato sauce. Instead of water, I used chicken broth. I also used parm cheese instead of the processed cheese. Wow, it was great served with bow tie pasta!

This was great! As a single mom of a little girl, I have to balance meeting her picky eating habits to my budget (and limited culinary skills).

The ingedients I used for the 4-serving recipe cost me a buck, the recipe was so simple even I couldn't screw it up, and my daughter loved the sauce! I used half to make chicken manicotti (multiple servings from a whole roast chicken - which I also learned how to roast perfectly from allrecipes.com), and froze the other half to make spaghetti or lasagna in the future.

this is the first recipe i made from this site.  when i first tasted it, it didnt taste as good as i had expected but then after i added some extra garlic and parmesean cheese and let it simmer for about 45 minutes, it tasted 100 times better.  i also added some finely chopped ground meat.  i accented it with some pasta.  it definatly tasted good.

The sauce is still simmering, but it's exactly what I was looking for.  It tastes and smells great.  Perfect for our ex pat family with limited ingredients.  I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano.  I also doubled the recipe to freeze for later.  Thanks for a great basic sauce.

I followed the recipe but ended up adding some tomato paste at the end since it was far too thin without it.  We also found it kind of bland so next time I'll add more garlic and lots more Italian seasonings.  I'll also skip the water since I think that helped to make it way too runny.  It's a good basic sauce but it needs some additions/modifications to make it more than a 3 star recipe.

I don't know if this is a fair review of the recipe as written...I started out with intentions of making it by the book, but I didn't have cheese sauce or a reg brown onion.  So, I used red onion, left out the cheese sauce and water, added ground beef, garlic salt, and some green can parmesan cheese to smooth it out, and it was goooood. I'll make it again.

Delicious - especially for a super easy and quick-to-make marinara-type sauce. Great for a weeknight when you don't have a ton of time to cook. I made the recipe exactly as written, except for parmesan cheese instead of cheese sauce. It was so good and great as a topping for a cubed steak parmesan that I made! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe, except for the cheese sauce /sub Parmesan and this was very runny. We added ground beef to it.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to add 1 tsp of sugar and I used Italian seasoning in place of oregano. My husband Loved it, which is saying a lot since he grew up eating real Italian food. I didn't cook the onions and garlic prior, just threw everything together and let it simmer a couple hours. Will make again!

Good easy base.  Thank you for the recipe.  Easy to add to.  I would definitely add more garlic.  I used 2 cloves, still not enough.  And I added basil and bay leaf.  Very quick and easy.  Better the longer it simmers.

This had a homemade flavor, but also used up some cans of tomato sauce that needed using.  I added some basil as well.

I recommend this recipe!

This was a great starting point. I didn't have any tomato sauce so I made my own using 2 6oz cans of tomato paste. I followed the rest of the recipe like it instructs except for the cheese. I don't like using processed cheese so I went to grab parmesean and was out so I used gargonzola. I just sprinkled a good amount and added garlic salt and used 4 cloves of garlic. It was excellent. My children gobbled it up! Praise to the Lord for helping me on this one!

Pretty good sauce, but made as directed it would have been way too watery for my family. So I used a small can of tomato sauce plus a large can and also a medium can of tomato paste. I left out the processed cheese because we didn't have any. Instead of the oregano, I used a tsp. of Italian spices. Turned out alright, but seemed a little lacking on flavor. We will try this again though with Italian sausage.

Made this sauce tonight to go with stuffed shells. After reading the other reviews I added a large onion, lots more garlic and spices and used crushed tomatoes, instead of tomato sauce. Also added 1 can of tomato paste and only half the water to keep it thicker. Pretty good stuff.

This is the best pasta sauce I've ever had, hands down! I did skip the processed cheese sauce and just added shredded parmesan. Great with or without meat. Can't wait to make it again with my own fresh garden tomatoes.
