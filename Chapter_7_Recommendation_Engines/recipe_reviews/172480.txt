I had my first Monster Cookie at the snack bar at Target recently and came home determined to find a comparable recipe.  This recipe is perfect!  It's easy and produced cookies that tasted very similar to the ones at Target.  Only thing I did differently is add about 1/2 cup of cocktail peanuts (should've added more) and about 1/2 cup of Coconut (probably could've done with out it though).  Very tasty...crunchy yet moist and chewey.  I brought some to a gathering at my sister's and they were gobbled right up!

Unable to find a Monster Cookie recipe that wasn't too crispy or totally oatmeal based, I gave this recipe a go and it turned out great.  This also does well as a base recipe...feel free to add in as many "optionals" as you like.  I especially like to add chopped honey roasted peanuts or toffee peanuts.  These cookies are great "mailers", too!

SO GOOD!!  We put some Reece's pieces in as well, I am sure peanut butter M&Ms are worth a try too, but these were a bit hit just following the recipe... and so easy

I usually never use mixes for cookies, but these turned out awesome!  They are super easy and very chocolaty.  I used dark chocolate m&m's and only 1 cup of them and they still have plenty of chocolate.

These are the best!! I made them for my husband's birthday party and everyone gobbled them down!!  They were so easy I thought for sure they wouldn't taste good, boy was I wrong!!  I made huge ones and they were great!
