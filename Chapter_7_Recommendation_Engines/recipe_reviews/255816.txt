This is pretty good. Instead of stevia powder, I used brown rice syrup. I put half the mixture in popsicle molds and put half the mixture in the ice cream maker. They came out the same as far as texture and taste are concerned. Next time, I'll skip using the ice cream maker altogether as a lot of the ice cream was lost because it froze to the sides of the ice cream bowl. Top with some toasted coconut flakes. Thank you for the recipe.
