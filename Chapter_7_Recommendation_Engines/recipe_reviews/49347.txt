Absolutely delicious!!!  BUT, something was missing...I tried this recipe once before and it was great. But the second time around I addded ONE tablespoon of white vinegar to the garlic-oregano paste mixture and that DID IT!  The vinegar added an ever so slight tanginess to the meat which blended wonderfully with the garlic and oregano flavors.  Try it, your taste buds will thank you!

This recipe reminds me of Christmas Eve family gatherings thrown by my parents!!  Excellent.  I added 1 tablespoon of white vinegar (as per my parents' way of cooking it).  I didn't change any of the ingredients but I have a great way of cooking it that I adapted from my parents.  The pork should be cooked 1/2 hour per pound (10 pounds = 5 hours)--Cook with the fat side down in a covered roasting pan for the first half of the cooking time, then uncover and cook with the fat side up for the second half of the cooking time.  It'll turn out moist, very well cooked (which is extremely important when cooking pork!) and the fat side will be nice and crunchy, which, coming from a Puerto Rican family myself is the part that most people covet!!  Enjoy everyone, and THANK YOU for an awesome adaptation of a family staple!!!

We're garlic lovers, so we loved this pork!  I used a 6 1/2 lb. fresh picnic instead of a whole shoulder, and cut the skin off before preparing and cooking.  I cut the seasonings in half because of using a smaller cut, and used only about 2 teaspoons of salt because the amount called for sounded like too much.  I used dried oregano and it was fine.  The timing is not clear in the recipe, but I found I needed to bake my smaller roast about 2 hrs at 425, then I let it sit, covered, out of the oven another hour before slicing.  I was afraid it wouldn't brown by cooking it covered, but it did brown somewhat and yet stayed moist.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers for sandwiche tomorrow.

Què Rico! I made this for Sunday dinner and it was wonderful. I did not use pernil-I used a 2 pound pork loin roast because it was just my husband and I! I used all the ingredients for the rub except I scaled them down a bit: 4 cloves garlic, 3 teaspoons salt, 3 teaspoons pepper, 2 teaspoons oregano, 1-2 tablespoons olive oil and I used the advice of Latinacook and added 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. Delicioso! I served it with rice and some calabaza-it is fall after all! Great recipe Kenny! Gracias!

Very authentic taste. I also use some white vinegar and I make enough of the mixture to rub it outside of the roast as well. Lately I've been frying yucca instead of just boiling it. I cut the yucca in sticks, boil until cooked through and then fry them until golden and crispy outside. I sprinkle the yucca with garlic salt and then serve it all next to arroz con gandules. Very delicious!

It was so delicious it's almost too easy!! I added the tbsp of vinegar but I know it would have been just as good without so don't stress that part. I too substituted adobo for the salt & pepper (equal portion substitution) and used minced garlic. Rubbed the leftover paste all over. EVERYONE loved this recipe!!! Thanks for sharing!!

This spicy, moist, and succulant meat is absolutely delicious.  We couldn't stop eating it, even long after our meal was over.   It tasted like it was actually roasted on a spit.  I roasted it in a stoneware baker.

This was a wonderful dish.  I made this for a baby shower and was so worried that it wouldn't turn out but everyone loved it and wanted to take some home to share with their husbands.  I did add vinegar to the garlic paste, I also added a cup of chicken broth to the roasting pan and I uncovered the roast on the last 1/2 hour to give in a golden color.  I also selected a pork roast with the skin on and it turned out delicious with tons of flavor and tenderness.

Used the suggestion to add the white vinegar. This was fantastic. DH heartily approved and will definitely make again.

[update] This recipe works very well in a crock pot too. 1 hour on high and then low until 170oF internal. (sorry, don't recall how long that was).

I was having a large birthday party for my son and wanted a unique main dish that could feed a lot of people. I tried this recipe, and used the suggestion of adding a little vinegar to the garlic paste as other reviewers had done. IT WAS AWESOME! Everyone loved it and since the party I've been getting calls for the recipe. this is a very economical way to feed a lot of people. The 20 servings cost about $15 to make. GREAT RECIPE!

update: I have made this recipe several times since the birthday party. It's my go-to pork recipe! Want delicious pulled pork sandwiches or pork tacos? Put the roast in the slow cooker all day, and then use two forks to shred the meat..... AMAZING!!!

This is almost the exact recipe I use! But I replace the black pepper with a packot of Sazon which adds more flavor and a beautiful color and mix ingredients in a bowl. Around (or slightly less) 1/4 of cup of salt is perfect, but make sure to make plenty of slits to stuff the salt/garlic mixture in or some pieces of meat will be too salty. The only thing I do differently is the cooking method. I cook the pork fat side up in a 400º oven for one hour, then reduce temperature to 300º for about 4 hours. The meat comes out SUPER tender this way :). Also, if you want super tasty/tender meat, rub the night before and wrap in plastic wrap. Perfect every time!

Great recipe! My family raved that it was the best lechon they've ever had. I added a teaspoon of vinegar per other's comments.  I baked it at 350 degrees for two hours and then put it up to 425, until the internal temp reached 170.  Very tender and juicy!

Excellent, tasty recipe! I scaled it down for our family's needs. I used a lean pork sirloin roast and served without the yucca roots. It was a huge hit! One tip is to make sure you transfer all of the juices from the raw roast into the pan for cooking. It really helps to keep the roast moist. If you use bottled minced garlic (NOT the dehydrated variety), you can mix the ingredients together by hand to make the paste, which will leave you with more seasonings for your roast. In addition to putting the paste in the holes, be sure to rub it over all surfaces of the roast, as shown in the picture. My husband, who is not Puerto Rican, said this is the best food he has ever tasted!

This was unbelievable! I added white vinegar at the suggestion of other reviewers and I used a 2 pound piece of tenderloin because that's what I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband (who is Puerto Rican) loved, loved, loved it. Said it was great and totally authentic. Will definately be making again and again.

This brings the pork roast to a new level.  I multiple the recipe times 5 and use on a steamship pork roast- between 80-100 pounds.  We serve at all special occasions at the ranch and recommend it to all our guests.  i do not make the yuccas for these large meals, but otherwise follow the recipe.  I do use our large smoker to cook the meat.  We cook it between 10 and 12 hours at 180 degrees.  This is a winnner.

This is absolutely delicious. I usually hate to make pork roast because it's usually so bland but this is wonderful and so easy.  I used dried Italian seasoning since I did not have oregano by itself but otherwise made the recipe as is.  I also prepared it the night before and let it marinate in the fridge overnight.  I covered it with foil at the beginning to avoid the meat browning before it was cooked.  Once, it was cooked, I removed the foil to brown it.  It was delicious, well seasoned, and moist.

WAY too much black pepper and salt. It overpowered the roast and made it difficult to enjoy the other flavors. If I make this again, I will cut Black Pepper and salt by half.

I halved this recipe (5 lb roast) and added a tbs of cider vinegar to the paste as another user suggested.  With the leftover paste, I covered the entire roast (like a rub) and it turned out EXCELLENT.  Took it to a potluck dinner and it was a major hit!!  I wanted to jazz up the yucca so I mixed melted butter, chopped garlic fresh oregano and pepper - blended them all together and drizzled it over the fork tender yucca. DELISH - and a great compliment to the roast!!

This was a very tasty roast and came out very nice.  I just wasn't too sure about the stuffing instructions.  since it was a pork loin it had no strings.  I cut it in half and slit and stuffed the sides and put them together.  All was held in place with bamboo skewers.

Cut the seasonings down since I only had a 4lb roast. Cooked for about 1/2 hr per lb and was wonderful! Baked first with fat on bottom then the last 1/2 uncovered and baked with fat on top.

I used a 3-4lb pork shoulder instead of a picnic roast and did as suggested and used Adobo rather than salt and a tablespoon of vinegar.  Because I used a smaller roast, I reduced the amount of seasoning.  This was really good and moist.  Every one loved it.  I used a prepared yellow rice and mixed vegetables as sides.  Plan on having sandwiches with the rest. I will make this again!

this was soo good! for some reason my seasoning was more powdery then pasty? i used a 4 lb roast, and cut the ingredients in half, then spread the remaining seasoning on the top of the roast, and it was VERY overpowering. There was simply too much spice. this still gets a 5 becuase it was my error. all i did was brush off the excess seasoning and it was fine.

This was really good but I don't think cutting the roast got the flavor into the meat. Next time I will do a full split down the middle and fill the inside, then cover the outside. Very good and will try it  again.

I love this recipe but you do need to add the vinegar, the salt can be a bit much so I used about 2/3 of the 1/4 cup with better results.  This also helps with making leftovers which will not be too salty as in great chile verde.

UMMMM! This is delish! I used an 8+ lb. pork picnic. I added 1 T white vinegar. I used jarred garlic and dried oregano since that was what I had on hand. I baked at 425 for 2 hrs, fat side down, turned it, and continued baking for another 2 hrs, fat side up. I used my enameled cast iron covered dutch oven which really retains heat and moisture. Suberb! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic!!  My Colombian Wife says it is the best dinner I have ever made.  Don't forget to add the white vinegar.  Makes all the difference.  Thanks India520, your way of cooking this is perfecto!!

Absolutely delicious! .. I made a baste out of all the ingredients on here (garlic, salt, pepper, fresh oregano chopped in a food chopper) mixed with the olive oil and added a teaspoon of white vinegar to help tenderize the pork.  For a better taste, let marinade overnight ..   With the Yucca, I served with a Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Thinly chopped Garlic dressing (mojo).

OMG!  soooooo good :) I added a bit of worcestershire sauce. My family loved it, and I have made it 3 additional times. It is the best when you marinate the meat overnight.

What a wonderful example of how cultures are like recipes, the ingredients are all the same, it's just in how you put them together, lol.  I'm sure this is very Puerto Rican, but it's also very Italian, I have had it done this was as well as by rubbing the oregano and other spices out side and inserting whole cloves of garlic into the slits in the meat.  Also, turkey receives the same treatment with great results, garlic turkey is a favorite aorund the holidays with an Irish relative of mine.  It really IS a small world folks!

This is a great recipe. I have been making it this way for years only thing I do diffrent is i add 2 packets of Sazon seasoning which will give it a wonderful color and flavor, also, i use adobo instead of salt and pepper, and vinegar. I serve this with Arroz con gandules, which you can add a few spoons of the juices after the roast is done to the pot of rice. Gives the rice a fantastic flavor. I also serve this with tostones.

I make mine in the Reynolds Turkey size oven bags (this is for very large fresh hams).  The meat is very tender and it seems to take less time to cook.  Also, when cutting into the roast to put the spices in, I pierce a sharp steak knife as far as possible and throughout the roast .  That way you can really get the flavor in.

This was delicious and easy.  I cooked a small piece of pork which took 1 hour to cook.  I added the white vinegar as others have suggested.  I would make this again.  Very flavorful.  Even my picky son ate it.

This roast is delicious! It tastes so much like the one my grandmother usd to cook! The only change I made to this recipe was I added half a cup of Adobo all purpose seasoning with pepper instead of the 1/4 cup of salt and 1/4 cup of pepper. It took me oover 5 hours to cook my 8 pound picnic roast. My husband loved it!

Muy bueno! Excellent! First off... slice the fat so you can peel it back. Then stab holes and stuff seasoning in. Fold skin back over the meat srub rest of seasoning ovrr fat and   cookfat side UP. It comes out extremely moist that way  without having to cover it and the skin gets nice and crispy!..
For those that like to eat thd fat. I dont but some do!

Excellent Pork! I did add some Apple Cider Vinegar to the paste and cut the amount of Salt & Pepper to 1/8" cup each. I also added some Onion powder and Cumin to it. Had a 8 LB picnic.Great recipe.

So easy to make and man it was so good. I will definetly make this again. I boiled the yucca with some of the leftover oregano with stem and a whole peeled (5) garlic, strained and put over paper towel to dry. Fry and serve. Warning peeling yucca is like peeling a tree with a paring knife but it is so worth it at the end.

This is a great recipe (with some changes)! I followed advice of others and cooked the roast for 30 min per pound, beginning with the fat side down and turning at the half-way point. Great!!!!!

This is also the way I make this dish with a few differences.  First I rub the pork with lemon juice before seasoning.  After seasoning with mixture, I rub it with Goya Sazon (with culantro Y Achiote).

Great and amazing roast. I have to make it at least once a week. My family loved the way the roasted was so tasty and juicy. Plus I made a gravy from its own juices which was an even better kick. Great Great Great recipe.

I printed out this recipe as my husband wanted to make this. Needless to say he did not check the reviews to tweak the recipe as I asked him too. :) The roast was delicious EXCEPT he added the 1/4 cup of salt and pepper. WHOA! He said this recipe was very easy and simple to make except it came out way too SALTY! We will definitely be making this recipe again with probably only 2-3 teaspoons of salt and pepper and also adding in the white vinegar. I can see this recipe becoming a family favorite.

This was great even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't have a pork roast or fresh seasonings. I had pork chops and powdered seasonings. It was very flavorful and the kids ate it up. I will try adding the vinegar next time

This was amazingly delicious. I followed a reviewer's recommendation and added a tablespoon of vinegar and it was so good. The outside was a bit salty but that allowed the inside to be moist. I served mashed potatoes instead of yucca.

Wow, this was wonderful..only compliments from my husband and the kids.  I also used the "extra" paste to rub on the outside of the roast and found it added great flavour.  Thank you...this is very much a keeper.

This was an easy and delicious dish---reminded me of the island!!!  I had some of the oregano mixture left over and rubbed it all over the outside of the roast for extra flavor!   Thanks for sharing.  We will definitely prepare this again.  :o)

Very flavorful. My husband loved this recipe. However I also altered the recipe and added 1 table spoon white vinegar. Delicious!

Pork and I have a problematic relationship, but I try. Finally I have found a pork recipe I can’t screw up. I followed the advice of a couple of other reviews and added 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to my 7.5 lb roast. Popped it into my slow cooker (while I slow cooked at the pool) for 10 hours on low and OMG! Never ever gonna prepare a picnic shoulder any other way. Perfectly moist and tasty. Thank you!

I had to force myself to put the pork away before I finished off a eight-pound roast on my own!  This is simply wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to the paste.  Took 2 1/2 hours to cook an 8-pound roast in my Nu-Wave Oven.  
Thank you, Kenny, for this great recipe!

I will try this again because the taste was really good. My only problem with it was that it was a bit to much sodium. It may have been because I cut back the size of the meat to adjust to my small family.

This recipe was very good. I used a pork loin. I used adobo instead of salt and added a bit of vinegar to the paste. Besides inserting the paste into the slits, I also rubbed it all over the roast. I will definitely make again!

This was the best pork roast I've ever had!  I made several small cuts and filled with the paste.  The rest I just rubbed over the whole roast.  Yum!

Love this recipe!  Easy and quick to prepare. The only change I make to it is I slow roast it at 325 degrees for 2.5 to 3 hours. It comes out very thender. Next time I will try the vinegar too the last reviewer suggested. It sounds like a great idea.

Yummy! Similar to the one I make, but I use Adobo seasoning and 1 packet of Sazon con achiote and rub the meat vigorously with it!

I sauteed some onions and garlic in oil to put on top of the Yucca along with some salt, paprika, and herb mixture.  This blended well with some Yellow Rice I made that contained onion, garlic, and saffron.  I think next time I will include a little of the paste spices from the pork on the rice as well.  The flavors of all the dishes blended well together and made an absolute "Party in your Mouth".

I made this dish for 2 by using a 2 lb. pork roast. I cut back the ingredients accordingly, but I wish I had cut down the salt even more. I cooked the 2 lb. pork roast for 40 minutes and it turned out perfectly. It was so moist and flavorful. I think we're going to serve it at our Florribean themed wedding reception.

We really liked this recipe. We used a 4 lb. roast - it took 3 hours to cook. We added the tablespoon of white vinegar as others recommended, and it was very good. We had extra marinade, so we rubbed it all over the roast for extra flavor. Also added baby carrots and onion wedges, along with chicken broth in the bottom of the pan. We liked the yucca also - had a very similar flavor to potatoes. We will definitely make this one again.

This roast was great!! I couldnt stop picking at it while it cooked!! I added 1 packet of sazon, vinegar and adobe to the marinade. And I let the flavors marinate over night. Also when I cooked it I added half a can of chicken broth to the pan so it will stay juicy.

This smelled absolutely wonderful! I overcooked my roast a bit, so it was a bit dry, but will definitely try again and watch the cooking time more closely. The smell and flavor was too good to not give it another try!

This is a fantastic meal!  Whenever I ask my husband what he would like for dinner...this is in his top 5 for sure!  I am very liberal with the garlic and spices.  I always add just a touch of hot pepper sauce!  Highly recommended!  I like to serve this with a roasted potatoes and carrots!

This was delicious and fast compared to other roast recipes.  I omitted the olive oil since my roast was pretty fatty already. I also cooked it in a bed of root vegetables which I stirred every 15 minutes in the drippings.

Great recipe, I used the suggestion to add some balsamic vinegar and it added the punch needed. The only thing I didn't care for is that the garlic past turned green..is that normal? In any case, very tasty and highly recommended.

This roast was FANTASTIC!!!! Started by seasoning with Paula Deans "house seasoning" (1 cup Kosher salt, 1/4 cup garlic pwdr and 1/4 cup black pepper) and browning in large dutch oven on top of the stove on med/high heat. Cut the salt and pepper in half and increased the garlic to 10-12 cloves. Roasted at 325 for about 4 hours but determined when it was done with a meat thermometer. This one is definitely a keeper and will be on the table with our other meats on Christmas Day!!!

This was a very good pork roast.  I used a 5lb shoulder, therefore used half the amount of salt and pepper with the full amount of garlic. I did add the vinegar. I could have lightened the salt and pepper a bit more, it was quite salty.  Overall though, the meat was tender and juicy and very seasoned.

Just to note, I followed the recipe as far as preparing the meat, but slow roasted it on indirect heat on my gas grill.  I wrapped it in foil for the first hour and then opened the foil for the second hour and a half.  It was cooked perfectly.  In the warmer months, I use the grill for many roasts, turkeys, etc using that method.

My family loves highly seasoned foods so they thought this was terrific.  I would like to try cooking this on the smoker too.  I also like the idea of making a paste with the spices, evenly distributes them.  Leftovers the next day were delicious too.

Made this today. No oregano on hand; used Italian seasonings instead. Also added a bit of white (balsamic) vinegar, as recommended in past reviews, and threw some fresh onion in as well. Coated the outside with some of the paste, sprinkled some Adobo on the outside, and popped it in the oven. Came out pretty good. Definitely making this again.

Easy and delicious.  Next time I will double the paste so I can make a lot more slits into the meat and coat the outside to spread the deliciousness.  Will def make again. Picky kids liked, too.

Have made this multiple times now. Squeezed a few oranges and limes into the pot before adding the meat the first time, and used a bottle of Goya Mojo Criollo marinade last night.     Did not cover. Broiled for 10-12 minutes for color/crispiness then turned down to 350 until internal temp was 190-195. This. Is. AWESOME!!!!! Right now butts/blade roasts are the most economical meat I can find, as cheap or cheaper than chicken (bought a 10 lb roast for .99/lb). My family will get 3+ meals out of this DELICIOUS $10 piece of meat. Thank you Kenny, to you and your grandfather, for sharing this recipe.

Loved it. reduced the salt and pepper a little as I was nervous it would be too spicy, but it was fine.  Will do full quarter cup next time. Perfect dish for a crowd as it can sit in a warm oven while getting everything else ready. Goes well with Baked acorn squash with apple stuffing.
