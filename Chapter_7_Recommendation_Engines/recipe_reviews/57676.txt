We liked the extra depth of flavor that the bbq/steak & worster added.. didn't use as much of the bbq tho. Remember to flour the pieces first before egging and re breading.. it adheres much better.

Wow!!  Is exactly how I'd describe this recipe.  Made it yesterday and everyone devoured it!  I also marinaded the meat in the milk overnight and it was so delicious!  Will be on our regular menu!  Note: the lady rating this recipe a 1 because she "only likes drumsticks and wings", give me a break! You don't need to follow the recipe as is and if you don't like whole chicken, why use it? pshff

My wife REALLY liked this.  I'm not a chicken lover but I had seconds.  I marinated the chicken for six hours in the refer before frying. I don't see why so much oil is needed for frying.  I used about two tbls. oil in a non stick frying pan and the chicken came out a really golden brown and tasted really good.

This is wonderful chicken and will be on my table often.  I also marinated overnight in the buttermilk mixture. This is real Southern fried chicken like my grandmother used to make!  I found 375 too hot so cooked at 300.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Kiss the chef! This was fantastic spicey, moist, juicy on the inside, fried chicken when marinated overnight as suggested. It looks great too. I had to stop the kids from eating it all before it hit the dinner table. No leftovers and not a word during dinner good. That's a five star when the kids are quietly shoveling.

This was pretty good!  I loved the crunch,  and it maintained that even as leftovers.  I would perhaps not add the worchestershire sauce next time - it was a bit much,  but other than that,  good!

It might just be me but maybe I could get some helpful info. I did everything that was said and I tried it in the fryer and in the skillet both at 375F the chicken instantly burned the outside to a black crisp in both the fryer and in the skillet. I didn't want to waste anymore chicken so I put just egg as the batter and the flour mixture then it didn't burn. My husband who owns this account said that it was because we are in Utah and it needs to be at 350 but I'm pretty sure it was something in the batter any ideas on how to make this work? Fried Chicken is my "unicorn" when it comes to cooking and my husband LOVES fried chicken (poor guy) any help would be so helpful...

Not what I expected at all. The breading came out massively thick and softer even after cooking longer. Could have done something wrong but I don't think this is my kind of recipe. I would be willing to try again but will not dredge chicken more then once.

This recipe was AMAZING. My son likes drumsticks. I made a large serving of drumsticks, and my son devoured them!! I read reviews and made the following additions. I brined the chicken in a salt, apple cider, water solution for 2 hours. I added 2 teaspoons cumin & 1 teaspoon mustard powder to the buttermilk mixture. I also reduced the BBQ sauce as suggested. Then I marinated the chicken in the buttermilk mixture for 6 hours as suggested by other reviewers. I use tongs to handle the chicken when I dip between the buttermilk and flour. This keeps my hand from getting coated with the thick batter. I kept the temperature in the pan at 300 degrees so that I didn't burn the outside before the inside finished cooking. I think the brine definately made the chicken jucier. Thanks for the GREAT recipe. My son would love it if I made this recipe every day!

This was simple and tasty. We skipped the barbeque because it just didn't seemed to suit and seasoned to taste. We'll make this again, thanks.

I liked the idea of adding steak sauce, worcestershire sauce, and BBQ into the egg mix. I removed the skins because it never fries up good with it on. Oh, i don't think I added any buttermilk at all! But honestly, 4 cups for 1 chicken is too much, and you would be throwing most of the "batter" away.

Burned really bad on outside, and was still raw on the inside.  I made a second batch of chicken with just flour, salt and pepper, thinking it was my frypan, but the second batch turned out wonderful.

I use this recipe to make chicken strips.  Instead of the whole chicken I use chicken breast cut into strips. My kids ask for this on a weekly basis.

Very good recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp. of ginger  and it gave a very good and unique flavor to it,  a little reminiscent of KFC chicken.

I didn't like this at all.  It was incredibly messy to prepare, and the end result of the coating was thick and tasteless.  I was hoping for something lighter and crisper.

UGH!  Was very messy to make--this really did "goo" up, got very dark in color, and generally was not worth the effort.  I was looking for a more golden, light recipe.  I've had better luck with the fried chicken recipe on the back of the Crisco can!

Unfortunately I can't agree with all the reviews.  Followed the recipe to a "t".  The batter was much too thick & when dredging in seasoned flour mixture it just gooed up.  The temperature is way too high, it burned very fast.  I'll stick to just regular seasoned egg wash in the future.

The batter tasted really good, but didn't stick well to the chicken.   The final results looks nothing like the chicken in the photo....

This recipe was outstanding. The BBQ and wocestershire give the chicken an amazing sweet, deep flavor. I didn't have any steak sauce and didn't add anything else to make up for the difference, but it was perfect as it was. Also, I didn't have whole pieces but rather used boneless chicken strips. It was very juicy but cooked all the way through, and it remained juicy even as leftovers. I will be making this chicken for years to come.

This was a hit with the family. I never made fried chicken and this came out wonderful. I eliminated the three sauces the recipe called for. It just needed a bit more seasoning ( I guess if I added those three wet seasonings, the chiken would have been even better). Also, to fry chicken, the best thing is to let the oil heat up first or you'll end up with a soggy mess and oily chicken. I usually flick a small drop of water intot he pan to indicate how hot it is and if its ready for the chicken. The breading on  the chicken came out crunchy and perfect!

This sounds like how I do it except instead of bq sauce... try Texas Pete hot sauce. My brother works in a upscale restaurant here they use the texas pete and it's the best I have ever had.

The taste of the batter was good, but the suggestion to dip them twice was not good. The first pan I made the batter was so thick that it wasn't crispy all the way through and it would fall off. I made another pan though, dipping just once and they came out pretty good.

The breading was really good, but the directions were very poor.  Cooking until golden brown on both sides does not get the inside of the chicken near the bones cooked at all and for someone who's new at cooking (like me) those instructions were very misleading.  Even using boneless chicken, the inside still wasn't cooked thoroughly.

Has great flavor if you can keep the chicken from burning. I followed the rec to the "t" and the chicken burned as fast as I put it in the grease. So I tried baking it for 15 minutes at 400 then frying to try and keep a nice light color to the coating. Worked out much better and I didn't get that scorched flavor!

Absoolutely wonderful!  I fixed this for a family gathering and it was obviously a big hit.  I couldn't cook it fast enough, they were standing in line waiting for it to come out of the deep fryer.  The second time I fixed it, I wisened up and made it the night before and it was delicious served cold.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

The recipe may have been better in the hands of a better cook.  I've only been cooking "seriously" for about a year and just may not have this frying thing down yet.  I used a thermometer, but 375 was apparently too hot to fry the chicken without burning it.  Maybe it was the oil I used (vegetable), or maybe I should have put the chicken in the oil sooner - as it was, the chicken browned (nearly burned) way to quickly.  In fact, so quickly that I had to pop it in the microwave to make sure it was done all the way through.  The coating flavor was good though I had to use a little additional flour so I wouldn't run out.

yummy!! I marinated it in the buttermilk mixture all day and only dipped it into the flour mixture the one time and it came out delicious! I didn't have the steak sauce so I left that out. The one thing I would do differently next time is use chicken tenders as the pieces are more the same size and cooking time might be easier. Yes it's a little messy, yes it's a little time consuming, but you're making homemade fried chicken!! If you want fast food, go to KFC!

This was my first attempt at fried chicken and it turned out great, except a lot of the batter/breading fell off while I was cooking it.  I think this was due to my electric skillet though.  Next time I will batter/flour it once instead of doing it twice.  It was delicious regardless.  I let the chicken sit in the buttermilk mixture all day, and I just used chicken thighs because I had them in the fridge.   Will defiantly make this again!

I made these for my dad and brother because they don't like faux chicken and they loved them. I used chicken thighs and legs instead of a whole chicken because I didn't feel like cutting it up. Then after dipping 4 large thighs and 4 large drumsticks in the batter and flour mixture, I had atleast half of the liquid batter left. Next time I will use 3 cups of buttermilk and 3/4 cup barbeque sauce. Also, I used a deep fryer and they took forever to cook! I left them in the fryer at 375 F for 20 minutes and they were still pink in the middle so I finished them in the oven at 400 F for another 15 minutes so they wouldn't burn in the oil. Everyone who tried it liked it so I'm sure it was a good recipe but it definitely was a lot of work.

I was looking for a great recipe for Fried Chicken with coating that would not be soggy or fall off.  I found it.  If your coating is soggy you do not have your oil hot enough.   I am also not sure why others are criticizing the name of the recipe and docking stars for that.  A cook is allowed to name their recipe however they see fit.  To heck with all you who think this is not "southern".  It is as southern as Hot Sauce and Jambalaya in my book.  The coating is a bit messy, but somehow it was all worth it in the end.   It is a great, crunchy, and spicy coating.  This is not a traditional fried chicken recipe, but it is good and deserving of 5 stars.  Thank you Jason!!!  When I am in the mood, I will be choosing your recipe.

One thing that always annoyed me about fried food was no matter what seasonings I put in, frying seemed to kill them. Not the case with this batter! Now I know the secret is to put the seasonings in the liquid, then dredge in seasoned flour, as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made my own butter milk (1T lemon juice/1C milk) and marinated the chicken in the milk mixture and doubled the spices in the flour, but other than that followed the directions exactly.  Good stuff!

I gave this recipe a one for taste and procedure.  This was very messy and the chicken had no taste whatsoever.  I would've thought with all the seasonings, this chicken would come close to KFC.  Will not try this again.

I have to admit, this is a great recipe! I soaked the chicken overnight in buttermilk, made a difference in the moistness. I added a couple of spices that others had mentioned; 1 tablespoon celerysalt,1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp tyme, 1 tsp. ginger and to the buttermilk mix a tablespoon yellow mustard and then omitted the steaksauce(didnt have it). I fried the coating golden brown and then cooked it off in the oven, finger lickin'good!

perfect fried chicken.  just lower the heat some, I fried mine at 330 and it came out perfect.  I also use self rising flour and the coating is just so crunchy.  Marinated it overnight and it was perfect.

This was SO great--better than I expected!!! Halved the recipe and cut that amount of milk in half (I used regular 1% milk instead of buttermilk).  Used Heinz 57 for the steak sauce.  SO crunchy and great taste!  yumyumyumyumyumyum...

My family loved this recipe!! The great thing was, I have a daughter who does not like barbecue sauce, so I made her's then added the barbecue sauce for the rest of us.  I also did not have steak sauce so I didn't use it.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, as our family does not care for dark meat.  I also used a product called "cultured buttermilk."  It is a powdered mixture that you mix with water to make instant buttermilk.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Jason!

Wow!  These are great!  I almost gave up on using recipes that required buttermilk because they never come out right, but these are excellent!  I love the bbq flavor!  One suggestion is to marinate it in the buttermilk mixture, I did this (poked holes into the meat) and I could really taste the flavor in the meat. I used legs for this because that's all I had on hand and left out the steak sauce since we didn't have any. Everyone devoured it!  Will be making again, thank you!

A bit too sweet for my husband and I. The kids liked it though. Maybe a different bbq sauce would help, but I won't be making again.

The taste was really good. As other reviewers said, my chicken ended up black, but mine wasn't done on the inside. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, so I microwaved them to finish them. I will try again, but next time cut the breasts smaller.

My wife and I loved this recipe!! I used it with thinner cuts of boneless chicken breasts, also used pure olive oil and it was lighter. I added a little Lawry’s seasoning salt too. We will definitely be making this recipe again.

It was such an interesting mix of ingredients, I had to try it.  I didn't have steak sauce on hand and I used chicken breasts that I cut into "tenders".  Kids & hubby loved it. Will definitely try again.

Southern Fried? Not really. More of fried chicken with a twist. I don't deep fry, buttermilk, salt, pepper, and flour. TEXAS PETE HOT SAUCE was mentioned and is my favorite hands down! I use a deep iron skillet and Crisco oil. MH heat and turn when it reaches desired brownness. To vary off this original, I will add a little onion powder to the flour. Texas Pete, and iron skillet is the trick.

The instructions for this recipe are pretty poor.  Definitely do NOT try cooking this at 375 degrees - you'll get raw inside and burnt outside.  The flavors are good but do NOT try to double dip.  This recipe is very messy and was more of a pain than what it was worth.  We've found much better results frying chicken with just a dry coating of flour and your favorite seasonings.

I liked the flavor when it was done.  I think the liquid mixture could be cut in half because I had so much left over.  Little messy, but hey it was tasty.

As I am not a huge fan of any sort of bone-in meat, I used Chicken Tenders for this recipe and thought they turned out really well.  I marinated my meat in the buttermilk mixture for a few hours.  The tastes of the sauces really came through and the batter stuck really well to the meat.  I highly recommend trying this and will use this again!

I felt this recipe would've been better if i used a deeper pan to fry the chicken in....although my wife loved the batter...i dont think it would have made a difference to the taste.....alot of seasoning and i didnt taste flavor in the chicken itself

Use this recipe to teach 12 yr old. Batter was very good, we even deep fried the extra batter to eat like hush puppies.  Definately worth trying.

I have to say...  This is AWESOME!!!  I have always had trouble getting the batter to stick with my old recipe, but now...  no problem.  It isn't as messy as some are saying, in fact I had very little mess at all.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cause that is what I had on hand) that I cut into strips.  My family absolutely loved it, it also reheats great.  I will definitely be making this more often.

It was alright, could definitely taste the barbeque sauce and it was really difficult to coat because it needed a lot more flour mixture, otherwise it just turns into a dough like substance

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but mine turned out awful.  I ended up trying to finish it in the oven.  I don't think I've had something turn out so bad since before I got married 16 years ago.  I recommend a trial run of this before making it for company.

Just made this yesterday. Couple of suggestions: I tried the "double breading" this recipe suggests--dip in sauce, in flour, back in sauce, back in flour, and found my chicken was WAY over breaded.  Last half of my chicken pieces, I only "single breaded".  This breading/sauce combination was FABULOUS, however!!  LOVED the spike from the BBQ with the buttermilk. Also, I got a pre-cut chicken from Wal-Mart and the breast/ribs sections were really big.  When I make it again, I will cut the chicken myself, as the large pieces were unable to cook through before the breading started to burn.  Ended up pulling the breasts out and finishing them in the oven (still tasted pretty darn good, though!).  Cut the rest of the meat into smaller pieces before frying.  Even with all the problems getting the meat to cook, it got GREAT reviews from my company!!  And it reheats in the oven the next day very nicely.  Overall, GREAT fried chicken recipe!!

This reciped tasted very good! However, I, too, had problems with getting the batter to stick to the chicken. I will not double dip them next time. And, I will probably just left them marinate overnight in the buttermilk mixture. Overall, it tasted awesome and I'll make it again!

This was very good.  I soaked the chicken in the buttermilk mixture like others said.  That helped the flavor get down into the meat.  I think I'll keep using this one for a while.

This came out wonderful. We made it a second time with chicken breast and this time finished it off by coating it with some bbq sauce and baking at 350 for 5 minutes. The BEST!

This is the best tasting fried chicken I have ever made!  I used drumsticks and thighs, and it came out just fine.  Moist and juicy.  I did lower the heat, and fry longer, as I thought 10 minutes was too short for each side, but it came out golden and yummy.  This is definately something I will be making again.

Pow!  Now that's crunchy chicken!  Reminds me of the old Crispy Chik we used to eat as kids.  I love the breading and now have a fried chik recipe to die for!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it did not turn out. The chicken ended up a soggy mess. Definitely did not have the crunchy exterior that I expected.

This is the first time I have made southern fried chicken.  I didnt have enough buttermilk (only 280ml) but found it didnt matter.  The result was fabulous, compliments all round.  My boufriend and I like things really hot and spicy so next time I make this dish I will probably do what glittergirl94 did and double the spices

The base recipe is a good start, next time I will add additional seasoning to bring out the flavor more.

Everybody loved this recipe!!! Even my picky boys. I did marinated the chicken in the buttermilk mixture overnite, it was very tender and juicy. Definitely try using peanut oil and keep the temp around 300F. I only made legs and breasts, but everything turned out great! THANK YOU!

I did not like this recipe at all.  I found the batter too think and it was extremely difficult to cook in the frying pan. 

I am a "newer" cook so perhaps and this was my first attempt to make fried chicken so maybe someone with more experience would have better luck.

This was a really good recipe. I did one thing different. I put chicken in flour - egg- flour egg then into a bowl of potato chips that i had crumbled up. It gave it an extra crispiness. The next time i make this though i will put more seasoning in the flour. It was kind of bland, but other than that, the batter was great.

This batter is exactly what I was looking for. Next time I'll use a little more bbq and worcestershire for 'kick'. I'm anxious to use it on larger pieces of chicken, all I had on hand was a bag of wings - but the kids really loved it that way. Oh, I used a deep fryer so it was especially easy to cook.

Excellent!  I found that there was a lot of milk mixture left over. Next time I'll reduce it. I also found that 375 was too hot, and that 300 worked perfectly. I used an electric skillet to help control the temperature. I used boneless skinless chicken breast. I was all nice and juicy! Make sure you cut the breasts in half. My boys and I loved it!!! A must for picnicing!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! These are now a regular request in our household!! I use boneless skinless breasts and marinade for (almost) 24 hours. They are a huge hit!! The chicken strips require no dipping sauce at all and are moist and juicy. Thank you soooo much for this recipe!!

I followed the recipe as given to the letter. As soon as the hot oil (350 degrees) hits that batter the sugar from that BBQ sauce starts turning black, and then it turns to charcoal before the chicken is done. What a disaster. I had to peal the batter off it to get something the family could eat.

This chicken had a nice crunchy coating,  but lacked flavor.  I think it needed regular salt in addition to the seasoning salt.   Quite disappointing.

I made this last week for my husband wo LOVES my mom's fried chicken.  He ate it, but did not say he loved it like he does my mom's.  I HATED IT!  I switched hot sauce for the bbq sauce like the suggestion of another reviewer.  That didn't help it taste better.  There was so much "batter" you could hardly taste anything of the spices.  It was also VERY MESSY!  I will not make this again and will just stick with my mom's recipe.

Just read this recipe.  It is a lot like a recipe I found on America's Test Kitchen.  Will try it since I love fried chicken.  Oh, and for cooks who don't mind getting their hands dirty just try to press the coating on the chicken pieces with your hands.  I know it's messy but it helps the coating adhere to the chicken.  Good eating everybody !  Rated it a 4 star cause it sounds pretty good.

I don't care for fried chicken but my husband loves it. For his Birthday I made him this recipe. He loved it! So I tried a bite and was surprised how moist the chicken was and what a great flavor the coating had!! It was an easy recipe and tasted great.

Just made it - very disappointing.  Hunks of the breading didn't stay attacted and ended up burning to the bottom of the pan.  Also takes a lot longer to cook the chicken through.  No a complete disaster, as the chicken had a nice taste, even if no "fried" stuff around it.

What a mess! I was so excited about this recipe, I followed the recipe to a 't' but it burned, black burned, it was hard to flip with tongs because the breading would start coming off, the breading was burnt on the outside and the breading was not done on the inside. My husband said forget it and put the rest of chicken on the grill... Any advice on how to do this better next time, like I said, I was very excited about this recipe!

I have a question. I'm eager to make this recipe but don't have buttermilk on hand. Would it be the same if i make buttermilk with milk and lemon juice? I've done that for bran muffins and they turn out great! Please help, i've already cut up the chicken!!!!

I'm not a chicken fryer by far. But the chicken was cook thoroughly (has ALWAYS been my issue) and it was crunchy.  But that flour mixture could have used more seasoning. The outside was a lil bland but the meat itself was seasoned. I used Ranch seasoning for extra flavor. I love the buttermilk egg batter. I think that was the key to the crunchiness. And I coated with flour first, then batter, then flour again as suggested by another user. All in all I'm pleased and will used this recipe again and once I tweak the seasoning I'm sure I'll bump this up to ??????????

I heated the oil to 375.  The breading burned in under 1 minute.
