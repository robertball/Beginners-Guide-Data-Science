Very good and quick.  I doctored it up a little bit, added fresh mushrooms, some extra potatoes, carrots, green beans and used baby carrots and added a bit extra broth and spices, still the basic soup though and a good quick veggie soup.  Great to add almost any veggie or beef that you may have left over.
