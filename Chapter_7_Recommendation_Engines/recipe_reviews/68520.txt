I was surprised how great this stew-like recipe tasted, since it didn't have any onions or even garlic in it.  However, I did use only 1-15 oz can of diced tomatoes and 2-15 oz cans of fire roasted tomatoes (yum!)  I also used a package of frozen corn, cubed (1") 5 small yukon gold potatoes plus 1 tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning (the only seasoning I had).  I probably could have omitted the black pepper or only put in 1/2 the amount - as it was pretty peppery - but my husband likes pepper.  Plus I added about 1 Tbsp of freshly grated parmesan cheese to the top of each serving.  I also made corn bread muffins as suggested and it was a delicious combination.  Additionally I served with spinach salad made with a shallot and mustard dressing which really complimented the meal.  Also, make sure to use an extra large skillet or dutch oven as it makes quite a bit.  No need to drain - used juices to dunk corn bread in.  My husband is not a fan of tomato-based foods except for spaghetti meat sauce; So when he actually said it was tasty - I new it was a hit!

I didn't think this was going to taste very good with only salt & pepper seasoning. Although all of the incredients blended together and it was really good. Even better as leftovers. Thank you!

My whole family LOVED this dish. I did, however, make a few changes. I used 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef, used half of the called for pepper, added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, added 1 Tbsp. Italian seasoning, added 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, and used two 14.5 oz cans Italian diced tomatoes. I didn't have to add any water to cover all the vegetables. i had to use a Dutch oven because this recipe makes A LOT. It also took considerably longer than 20 minutes for the potatoes to cook (probably need to cut them smaller next time). Served with cornbread and every raved about it and asked me to definitely make this again!!!!

Delicious! I added Italian Seasoning, left out the potatoes and added onion and green beans. From a husband who thinks, "Not Bad" is a compliment, he raved over and over about how "Delicious" this is.

This recipie is very good if you like squash. It has a robust flavor if you use Italian style stewed tomatoes. I also used extra tomato sauce and let it simmer for a longer time letting all the flavors out.

After reading all of the reviews, I decided to give this recipe a try and take the reviewers' suggestions of adding some seasoning. I added a medium onion, some garlic and some Italian seasonings. My family enjoyed this recipe. We had some nice crusty bread with it and served it in bowls. It was good, but not our favorite. Nice for a cold evening. Easy clean up since it was all made in one large pot on the stove. Our family of 6 enjoyed it with some left for tomorrow's lunch.

I gave this a try to use up a lot of veggies I had on hand from this week's organic co-op harvest, and was surprised at how delicious it was, with a few modifications:   * I used ground turkey instead of beef, just because that's what I had on hand. In retrospect, this would be even more delicious made with Italian sausage instead.  * I cooked chopped onions and garlic in with the ground turkey.   * I had to use up a bunch of organic tomatoes, so I threw one large one in the blender with some rosemary, basil, and oregano (to make the "canned" pureed tomatoes), in addition to dicing a couple more.   * I added some chili powder to everything as it cooked.   * At the last minute, I decided to throw in a bit of goat cheese and a can of cannelini beans... I wasn't sure if this would improve the dish or ruin it, but they both turned out to be DELICIOUS additions.  The end result was mouthwatering... five stars and beyond with these modifications. My husband normally doesn't care for this type of "one-dish meal," but he raved about it and went back for seconds. My puppies were crying for it the entire time it cooked!  As some others mentioned, it took much longer than 20 minutes for the potatoes to cook... I think I cooked the entire thing for 40 or 45 minutes on low. Definitely worth the wait, but I wish I'd started earlier.

Very nice dish.  I used Italian herb-seasoned crushed tomatoes and that kicked it up a notch for a great taste.  I agree with another reviewer who said to use the liquid for bread dipping; draining the dish would be a waste of delicious sauce.  Also, as mentioned before, use a very, very large skillet or a dutch oven.  Thanks MRSHEIMANN for a good recipe.

Well this was quite enjoyable.  I did reduce the seasoned salt and pepper to 1 tsp and I added 2 tsp of Italian seasoning and 1 tsp garlic salt.  Still plenty peppery for me.  I only had a 15 oz can of crushed tomato, so I added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce as well.  The potatoes need about 30 minutes to cook.  As promised, great with cornbread!

I read some reviews before I started this recipe and added onion, garlic, 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, reduced pepper to 1 tsp. and cooked it in a stove-top dutch oven, however after simmering and stirring almost constantly for over 2 hours to keep it from burning on the bottom, my small cubed potatoes were still little stones and the mixture had all cooked down to a thick paste (read "hearty stew"!).  I finally resorted to fishing them all out and put them into a microwave dish with some liquid and cooked them for 3 minutes just so we could eat before midnight!   However the taste is worth the wait although a bit bland but next time I will precook the potatoes until almost tender and then add.  I think I will bump up the pepper but not to 1 Tbsp. and see what else I can spice it up with.  I also made corn muffins as suggested which were a fine addition to the meal.

We ate this as a stoup with an arugala mixed salad. I used ground buffalo meat (less fat) and did not have any zucchini, but I used plenty of yellow squash. For the tomatoes I used some leftover pasta sauce from the fridge and a can of Rotel. I also used a couple of small handfuls of frozen corn. My husband and nine year old daughter cleaned their bowls. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty (not mind-blowing), hearty stew! Per other reviews, I added some additional seasoning (garlic powder, chili powder), and used a can of Ro-Tel for part of the diced tomato portion. With these changes it turned out really well.

Great recipe!  I altered slightly by sauteing onion and garlic in a skillet prior to browning ground turkey.  Like some others, I used Rotel for the diced tomatoes and really loved the flavor.

This recipe makes a fairly bland panful of ground beef, tomatoes, and vegetables. Definitely would benefit from added seasonings. We sprinkled liberally with Cajun seasoning mix and ladled it over fresh-baked cornbread, which ended up making it a nice little meal. Perhaps some fresh herbs next time or something.

I ended up adding some Italian Seasoning, Onion and Garlic to add more flavor.  It definitely needed a little more something beyond what I added.  It was a good base and different seasonings could be added to it.  So I would probably make it again in the future, but not as is.

I loved this dish! I would add onions while frying the burger and a can of tomato sauce to it, because ours was not quite as juicy as the picture.

A mess!  For one thing the recipie is HUGE, I suggest cutting it in half.  For another it is not very flavourful, I put some cumin in it to make it palletable.

This one was really dissapointing...it had no flavor to it and neither my husband nor I liked it.
