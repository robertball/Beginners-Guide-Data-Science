Use an extra egg and top with streusel topping before baking (Bisquick, brown sugar, butter, & cinnamon).  These were fluffy and moist - not like cake or biscuits - just a perfect muffin (like the ones we get at the bakery).  Another topping option is to just sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on the tops before baking.  Yum.  A summer vacation favorite for my family.

Very good, moist... I always add more blueberries than asked for, and I think that helps them stay a bit more moist.

These are the muffins my mom always made and I was thrilled to find the recipe, since it isn't printed on the Bisquick box any more.  I always double the blueberries.  Moist, delicious. Love these muffins!

Fast, easy, and great flavor. I used a whole can of OregoN blueberries, drained and homemade baking mix. (recipe on AR). These turned out great and I can see using different fruits instead for different flavors muffins... thanks for the great base recipe. This is perfect!

I'm glad you wrote this. On the back of the boxes of Bisquick this recipe is no longer shown. Now, I have a few other suggestions. Instead of Blueberries, add nuts. Mixed salted or unsalted nuts, and marachino cherries. I like salted nuts the best. With the sweet bisquick, the salt from the nuts just adds a very special taste.  It's Dessert time!  PLEASE allow the bisquick muffins to stand  for a few minutes  BEFORE putting them in the oven.   Just 5 minutes is all that's needed, The tops of them get crusty.  Let me know how you like them. For an adult treat, have these nutty muffins as a snack while drinking a  beer. .Here's another secret. I oft times add a wee splash of beer to the nutty batter to make them rise even higher. Not a lot, just a wee splash.   Cheers to all. From NV

A very good and easy muffin recipe. I used the Heart Smart Bisquick, cut the recipe in half, and used the whole egg.

This is a quick and easy blueberry muffin recipe.  In order to make it low carb I used Carbquick (a low carb baking mix) and Splenda Sugar Blend.  I also used frozen blueberries that I thawed in the microwave for about 1 minute.  Since other reviews said that the muffins were dense like a biscuit, I decided to use one whole egg and add one egg white.  They turned out really light and fluffy. These were really yummy muffins.  My family of four ate the whole dozen for breakfast this morning.  Next time I will use a little more Splenda Sugar Blend to make the muffins a little sweeter.

Easy, effective, tasty, but stay unavoidably biscuit-ish (a little heavy and dry) despite my efforts to adjust the recipe so they are more like a light muffin. They are more moist after being refrigerated overnight but are lightest just out of the oven.

Kind of dry and fell apart easily. Fairly tasty, but wish flavor would have been more intense.
