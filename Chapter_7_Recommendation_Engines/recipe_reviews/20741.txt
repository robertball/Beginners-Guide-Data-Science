I think the issue people are having with the water-rice ratio is the result of the author using a different definition of a "cup" of rice.  Chinese people use the little cup that comes with a rice cooker to measure rice, roughly pronounced as "muk" and is maybe half (or even less) than a standard measurement cup. Congee is generally made with a water to rice ratio of around 10:1. possibly greater. This recipe implies 5:1 which is far too little water.  Hope this helps.

Hi Caroline, 

Really enjoy your reviews. Here is what I found on your question below:

"Hundred Year Egg
Also called century egg, thousand-year egg and Ming Dynasty egg , these are (usually) chicken eggs preserved by being covered with lime, ashes and salt before being shallowly buried for 100 days. The lime "petrifies" the egg and makes it appear that it has been buried for at least a century. After the black outer coating and shell are removed, a firm, amber-colored white and creamy, dark green yolk are revealed. They will keep at room temperature for up to 2 weeks or up to a month in the fridge . Hundred Year Eggs are usually eaten uncooked as an appetizer, often with accompaniments such as soy sauce or minced ginger. The flavour is pungent and cheeselike." 

This isn't my taste and would probably just use 2 hard cooked chicken eggs if I was making this recipe.

This recipe is completly authentic and delicious!  For anyone who hasn't had the benefit of having the recipe passed down from their mom...this is it!  Be sure to let the rice "marinade" in the oil and salt otherwise the congee will not have a creamy consistency.

Okay, so I've never made this recipe exactly according to the directions, but I've probably made it 30 times in assorted forms!  I use my crock pot and usually have to add another cup and a half of water.  Sometimes I add meat of some sort, sometimes peeled ginger and lemon grass, sometimes oyster sauce, sometimes I use chicken broth... We eat it plain sometimes and other times garnish it with hard boiled egg, green onions, cilantro, lime juice, etc.  Not sure how authentic it is when I make it, but we like it a lot and it is cheap if you use broth instead of meat.

This recipe is really an original and authentic recipe!! Many have posted comments about the hundred year old egg, the smell and etc. If you want the full ethnic taste, you must use the 100 yr old egg. If you are skeptical, just cut the egg up very very small and add it to the congee. This recipe is a must try!!! Also, if you're into spicy, I would recommend using an ASIAN sweet chile sauce. Put it on when you're ready to eat.

Just a comment.. the hundred year old egg can be found at your local asian/oriental store. It's an acquired taste, for sure - I personally love it, but the smell that comes from it may deter some people =)

Since moving away from home, I've been craving this... The egg is definitely an acquired taste, and its name doesn't make it easier either... My local Asian supermarket is 20+ miles away, so I cooked it a couple times without the egg. Its not as good, but still acceptable. Maybe there are other Congee recipes to come???

Thanks for this recipe!

Am rating this as the best, even though I changed the ingredients and quantities a bit, since I didn't have all the stuff and wanted to cook something different.  I used fish (tilapia) and unpolished brown rice, which is what I had handy, and it still turned out a winner. For this type of rice, it's better to use a bit more water; instead of 2.5 cups as called for 2 servings, I used 4 cups, since the brown rice needs to take in more water to get that congee texture. Thanks for the recipe!

We first tried congee in NYC's Chinatown and my husband wanted me to make some at home.  He loved this recipe, but I just used regular eggs.  I could have used the aged eggs, but my husband didn't like the idea.  Anyway, he loved it without.

I also used the 10:1 (water:rice) ratio which turned out perfect. An in lieu of the pork loin I substituted chicken thighs. Great comfort food on a cold day OR if you’re feeling a little ill.

I veganized this to make it cruelty-free and to pack it with nutrients, and it came out great.  I replaced the eggs with sautéed cubed tofu, sprinkled with turmeric and Kala Namak (black indian salt). I replaced the pork with vegetrian mock pork (fried wheat gluten) and added garlic, purple and green onions, spinach. shiitake mushrooms and red pepper.  I didn't have anything to replace the oyster sauce but I would have used mushroom sauce if I had any.  This completely solved my craving for the authentic meat version I use to have many years ago as a kid.  I'll definitely make this again!

This is very similar to my mom and grandmas recipe. I've been eating pork congee since birth. The only thing we don't use is the oyster sauce.

I am absolutely intrigued - what is an 'hundred-year egg'?!?!
***********
Thanks so much, RadiatingMom! I'm not sure it's quite my cup of tea, but it sounds fascinating! :)
