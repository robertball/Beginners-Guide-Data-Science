This was delicious, my only complaint was that I didn't get much of a marinade flavor. This was ok, because I liked the flavor of the meat, but I think that next time I will allow the meat to marinade overnight. Thanks for the recipe.

Like the other reviewer. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE let this sit for longer than 1 hour. I let mine sit for 8 and it was great. I don't have an outside grill so used the inside one and it was wonderful! This is my new steak recipe from now on. Thanks for the posting.

Really liked the flavor of this. Used with ribeyes. Next time, I may try to use rosemary combined with the thyme.
