A great go-to recipe that has become a staple! To fit what I have on hand, I use water in place of the buttermilk and canola or olive oil in place of the shortening. I also flip the quantities of whole wheat and all-purpose flour and typically add some milled flax seed. The great thing about this bread is that it's so versatile! If we are having an Italian-influenced meal, I add Italian seasonings (you could also add Parmesan cheese right into the dough, that would really add some flavor). I prefer using either brown sugar or honey, but I could see using maple syrup if you plan on serving this with some jam.

Finally, you can have fresh home baked bread without having to work or WAIT all day for it! This is a delicious yeast-less bread that was so easy to make I practically make it every day now! Thanks for making sure old world foods make it in the fast paced today we all share!

This recipe was great. I am on a yeast free sugar free diet. I substituted the sugar fro 2 pkgs of stevia (plant sugar) and 1 cup of butter milk for 1 cup of almond milk. I added some oregano and chili flakes. It came out flavorful and sweet. I even made it again but this time rolled into buns, which I served with chicken burgers.

I needed a quick flat bread and this was wonderful.  I didn't have any wheat flour on hand, but it turned out fine using all white.  It is easy to make and the kids enjoyed it.

This recipe is more like a flat biscuit than a true pita-like flat bread.  It was pretty tasty if you like biscuits.

I got lost at "Pat onto an ungreased 12-in. pizza pan", since I don't have a pizza pan and I had no idea how much to pat it down.  I ended up not patting it out enough, apparently, because after 30 minutes at 375deg it was still a little doughy right in the center.  However, the kidlet loved it, and it was a super easy bread recipe I will definitely make again.  I have to - I'm 1/16 Finnish, and it's the only Finnish recipe I know. =)

This was really good. I wanted something quick and easy to add to our steak dinner at the last minute and this worked well. It was like a  big, soft and fluffy biscuit. The leftovers will be great for breakfast with some butter and jam. Yum.

I thought this bread tasted bland to me. So the next time I made it, I added some honey (like 1/4 cup), and it turned out just right! The bread was wonderful!

Super easy and super yummy!  It was a nice flatbread that had a bit of sweetness to it.  I also chopped up flax seeds and added them for extra fiber and omega-3.  Will make again!

Easy as pie and totally tasty!  I brushed mine with a bit of butter for the last 5 minutes.  Served with hummus and fresh tomato.

Well, it wasn't nearly as flat as I envisioned it to be, so it's a bit of a misnomer, but it was good.  Fast option for homemade bread at dinner.

I made this today to try before Thanksgiving. I made it exactly as written and baked it on a pizza stone. It was delish!!!! DH was not convinced it would be good, but one taste and it was all over! What a great recipe!

Tastes great, but not sure if the final product is right. I used butter in place of shortening and lemon and 1% milk in place of buttermilk. The dough was really sticky and never really formed. It tastes so good though! And I love how easy it is to prepare. I don't think there will be any left for dinner tonight :)

This was just okay for us.
