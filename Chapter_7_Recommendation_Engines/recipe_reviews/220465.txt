This was a great salad. I didn't have onion so I used onion powder in the dressing and didn't have cucumber. I used a blend of arugula/baby spinach/herbs that was prepacked by the store. The grapes really made this salad pop. I look forward to making this salad again. It was a nice diversion from another plain tossed garden salad. The dressing was good with the blend but not very good by itself. Thanks for a great salad Rodrigouno.

Light and sweet, tangy.  I have made this now a few times, and love it.  I highly recommend trying this out.
