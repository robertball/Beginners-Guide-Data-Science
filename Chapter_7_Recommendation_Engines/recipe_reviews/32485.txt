Now that the summer weather is showing itself, I'm surfing around trying to find tasty drinks that will quench the thirst. This means avoidance of sugary sweet types. This recipe hits the spot! A little on the tart side, but a third packet of sweet and low or equal will take care of that. This was veeerrryyy refreshing. We really enjoyed it. Thanks sydney!

Oh dear! I knew it was going to need some sweetening, but even after adding 4 packets of Splenda, I could not get rid of the bitter taste of the water. Oh well. At least it wasn't an expensive disaster!

Try this with lemon lime soda instead of carbonated water.  A local fast food chain makes these, and they're really good.

Needs lots of sweetening before it tastes decent.

Based on the other reviews, I chose to use a sweetened soda instead of carbonated water. I chose Fresca. Our house was divided on this--my oldest boy and I LOVED it but my husband and youngest didn't care for it. I'll make this again, if only for me. This will be a refreshing drink this summer.

I added lemon lime crystal lite to the water (to taste) along with several freshly squeezed limes and zest. I may freeze a tray of cubes to add to this drink when I want a refreshing beverage.
