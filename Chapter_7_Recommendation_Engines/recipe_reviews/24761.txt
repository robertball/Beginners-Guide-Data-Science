This really was excellent, both in taste as well as presentation.  In deference to Hubs' sensitive innards I replaced half the jalapeno with minced green pepper and also cut back a bit on the cilantro, since he's of the camp whose taste buds believe it tastes like soap.  Flavorful, but in a supportive way.  It doesn't "step on the toes" of the main dish, in this case, "Bacon Wrapped Barbecue Shrimp," recipe also from this site.  I can see this as being a conveniently versatile rice dish too, the ideal complement to ANY meat or seafood entree simply by eliminating the cilantro and jalapeno if it doesn't fit.  As written, however, it's delightful.

Made 1/2 the recipe as written (used Basmati rice & white wine). Allowed the rice to fry in the oil/onions/jalapeno mixture for a minute or two before adding wine & broth/water (didn't bother to measure salt & pepper). It seemed like the ratio of rice/green ingredients was off (1 bunch of green onions = 1/4lb) but it wasn't! We really liked this, none of the flavors overpowered the other & it was just nice & fresh tasting. The jalapeno & cilantro doesn't mean it needs to be served alongside an ethnic dish - it's that neutral. Also for those afraid of the jalapeno, I scraped as much seeds & pith as I could so I was just left with the flavor of the pepper & none of the heat. Half the recipe easily served 6. Thanks Kimber, I'm really glad I tried this!

We really enjoyed this. I added the juice of one lime and a bit of zest too. Thanks for the recipe:)

Somehow I am just now seeing the reviews which is odd for me but I am thankful for they might have persuaded me to pass on this. I REALLY REALLY liked this recipe. So much in fact that this will be my go to when serving Mexican food. I even used the leftover with an Asian stir-fry and liked it in that too. Not sure what the others didn't like about this because I found the fresh cilantro, parsley, and green onion tops very fresh tasting and rewarding. 5 stars all the way. This was excellent!

This recipe packs a punch! It is spicy and oh so delicious! It is a great side dish with mexican food and it tastes even better with some melted mozarella cheese on top! I wasn't expecting this recipe to be anything special- but it is going to the top of the cookbook! Thanks!

Very nice. Pleasant change from standard Spanish rice with the red chili flavor. I only added a half of jalapeno because we're gringos. :)  But the rice came out fluffy and flavorful. The color and the crunch of fresh cilantro and scallions made it stand out. I served with slices of lime to squeeze over the rice dish. It really added zing. Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of this rice was tasty without being overwhelming.  It was great warmed up the next day.

Excellent rice as is, but even brighter with a couple of tablespoons of lime juice added just before serving.

Yummy! We are trying to switch to whole grains, so I made this with brown rice. It took much longer to cook than white rice, so I had to keep adding liquid. The result was a creamy, delicious dish very much like a risotto. I made the recipe exactly as written, but then just kept tasting and adding hot water until the rice was tender. Allow extra time for this recipe if you want to try it with brown rice. The only change I would make would be to reduce the parsley a little. The parsley, grassy flavor seemed a little too strong. Will definitely make this again!

The only ingredient I omitted in this dish was the jalapeno peppers as members of my family don't care for anything spicy. In its' place I used a whole green bell pepper. The prep and cook time was approximate. This turned out much better since everyone enjoyed this side dish. It is a pretty dish as well with the minced green flecks of bell pepper and herbs throughout the rice. The rice is tasty and flavorful with nothing overpowering each other (bell pepper, parsley, onions, cilantro). I thought I would be able to taste the cilantro since it is a stronger herb, however, I liked it in this dish. This is a nice change to plain white rice that we normally eat. The title of this dish fits perfectly!

Nice change from everyday Spanish rice when having a Mexican dish. I didn't have jalapeños, so used a Poblano pepper and Anaheim pepper....was still very good and maybe not as spicy.

I used basmati rice for flavor and added the juice of a lime to sweeten it a bit.

This is a very good recipe that offers all sorts of options for variations depending on what I have on hand at the time.  I cut it in half but otherwise kept the ingredients in the same ratio and we were very pleased with the results.  I use basmati rice and it took about 10 minutes longer to cook than the recipe said but I expected that.

I agree,  this was really good.   I used ordinary brown onion, not green as I don't care for green onion.  Also omitted the sherry as it's something I don't generally have on hand.   Used home grown parsley from the garden and cilantro from a tube (no fresh on hand).  Also added a bit of salsa verde as I had a bit leftover from another recipe.  Didn't have fresh jalapeño either so just used a few from a jar.  
Was easy to put together and I think the leftover will make a nice burrito lunch.   Also added a bit of green and red pepper, tho just a smidge as hubs and teen are not fans of capsicum.

This was disappointing.  I'm Asian so I'm always trying to find recipes to jazz up rice for my husband and I had high hopes for this one.  I think when it comes to cilantro, you either love it or you hate it.  I didn't put as much in it as the recipe calls for and we still didn't like it.
