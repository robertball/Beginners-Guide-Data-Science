I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out very bad--it was so dry and has no taste or consistency.  I am not sure if an ingredient is missing or what the problem was.

I added about 1 and 1/2  cup of milk as well as a 4th egg. The end result was a moist bread pudding that was very bland. The spices need to be increased.
