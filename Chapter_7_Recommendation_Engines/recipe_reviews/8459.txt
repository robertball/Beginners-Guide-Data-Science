I gave this recipe 3 stars for taste only, I am an experienced baker, cakes are my specialty. This roll cracked in several places despite rolling it and unrolling while cooling it as I do every roll I make. I also wonder why the originator posted that it takes 2 hours?? No way it takes that long. I had no fears going into this recipe except for the fact that the cake portion is most definitely not sponge cake which is what most easy/successful cake rolls are. I am still seriously doubting that this recipe needs baking soda, I think perhaps a change to powder might be in order as well as a change in the leavening{eggs} to produce more of a sponge. I will be working with this idea of producing a better pumpkin roll, I will be using my own cake roll recipe as a base as it starts with a sponge cake and has never cracked and I've made 100s of them. I'll post it when I get it perfect, until then look for my cake roll recipe, it's so good and so easy.

Oh wow this was wonderful! Among pumpkin pie, pecan pie, and choclate cherry cheesecake, this Pumpkin Roll was everyone's favorite dessert this Thanksgiving.  I too loved it and the filling is so yummy, I was scraping the bowl to get it all! ~~~~ I forgot to add the walnuts to the cake so I just tossed them in the filling and that was perfect, I think I will do that next time also.  The filling is not too sweet, just right!  I got so many compliments.  My one suggestion is use a lot of powdered sugar when dusting your cloth before rolling.  I skimped a little on the edges and my roll was almost stuck!!  But it came out just fine and was really easy to do. I put my roll right in the freezer for about an hour to let it set up and then stored it in the fridge until serving, wrapped tightly in non-stick aluuminum foil.  Yummy, easy, beautiful, and quick, what else could you want?!?

I tasted the roll right after I made it and thought it was a bit too sweet and a little dry. But after chilling it overnight, is was moist and very good! The chilling is mandatory before serving to guests. I added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.

This is the best pumpkin roll recipe EVER!  Last year my co-workers and friends wanted so many of them I had to start taking orders.  I made about 60 of them.  I am already up to 40 this season and will be making 20 more this weekend.  Everyone said they are the most moist and creamiest pumpkin rolls they have ever tasted!  Thank you so much for this recipe because now, in our small community, everyone thinks of me as the "Pumpkin Roll Queen", may the cream cheese live forever!

This is by far one of the best recipes around!  My son entered it into the county fair last year and he was a GRAND CHAMPION bake-off winner!  It netted him over $1500.00 too!!!

Some tips I've learned over the years:  Double the recipe (everyone requests a pumpkin roll from me for Christmas, so I double many times over).  When doubling, add the entire can of pumpkin...makes an extremely moist roll that way.

Line the pan with parchment paper...much less mess!

Chop the nuts (I prefer pecans) to cookie bit size (or buy them that way) and add them to the cream cheese filling.  The cake tends to hold together better with less cracking and the nuts give the filling a wonderful texture. 

I triple the filling mix for the 2 rolls (1/2 as much filling per roll), so there is a thick cream cheese layer throughout.  That's what everyone raves about.

Lastly, I wrap in plastic while they are still warm and place them in the freezer immediately....locks in the moisture.

Enjoy!

This is a really GOOD pumpkin roll recipe with the exception of the omission of how much salt to use.  Also, the ingredients include baking soda yet the directions use baking powder.  Which is it?

This was a great recipe. It was very easy to follow. As a novice baker, I was proud of the result. I found my family in the kitchen fighting for the last piece!

I had a friend ask if I would bake some goodies for her craft show/sale.  I had never tried pumpkin rolls before, but after reading the reviews I made a test roll and wowsers!  So easy for a first-timer like me.  I tried making multiple batches by blending more eggs at once, then splitting the mixture.  It worked, but I did 'remix' the eggs a bit before making the second and third batches.  I made 20 and they sold out in less than an hour.

This truly is a great recipe.  I've never made a roll of any kind, but my husband and I have been using this recipe for 3 years and now we have about a dozen orders a year for pumpkin rolls.  The big secret (if you're new to it like I was) is to make sure you beat those eggs the full five minutes and don't start till they are room temperature (about 30 min).  That is what gives it the spongy texture that makes it easy to roll.  I've never had ONE of these crack.  One other hint:  I never have cheesecloth and have used several substitutes.  One of my favorites (dont' laugh) is to cut up one of my husband's white t-shirts (make sure it's clean!!).  This not only works perfectly, but it's a great excuse to get rid of more of his tattered and tacky collection (after his first bite, he usually forgets his sacrifice).  I also don't bake the nuts into the cake.  I just put it in with the filling.  Less chance of error that way.  This is a great holiday recipe and people start asking for the pumpkin roll around Halloween. . .that's how good it is.

My first attempt at this and the roll cracked and split upon rolling it. Attempt #2 was a million times better. Here's what I changed: reduced baking soda to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder. Instead of using the towel to roll the cake up, I just used the parchment paper. I first sprinkled some powdered sugar on top of the cake, slid it off the baking pan, and rolled! Voila! It was awesome, easy, and delicious!I opted to leave the walnuts out of the cake but added them to the filling as someone else did and it was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe and I hope this helps!

This was the first cake roll I've ever made and it couldn't have been easier to make. It turned out perfect. Cake stays moist and doesn't dry out. Can't get enough of it.

I have been using this recipe for years, and everyone always raves about it. It is the easiest recipe. I don't use the nuts, b/c not everyone loves nuts. And I cook it on wax paper sprayed with cooking spray, I also don't use a linen towel to roll it, instead I use wax paper with powdered sugar sprinkled on it. So much easier, IMO.  Since they are so easy to make, I make 10-12 around Thanksgiving time and hand them out as small gifts. Everyone loves them. They keep very well in the freezer too!

Mmm, I love it.  This was easy to make (I've never done a jelly-roll cake before).  I used Neufachtel cheese (it's smoother than lowfat cream cheese) to reduce some fat from the filling.  I also used fresh pumpkin puree (see the preparation information on this website) and didn't add the nuts.  The batter is really runny, but it turned out great when baked.

I make these every year for Christmas since the first year was such a big hit. I'm up to about 35 a year and the list of people who want one as a gift keeps getting bigger. This is a must have recipe any time of the year!!! But I make my people wait for Christmas :):)

I made this for an Easter dessert and it was a big hit! Thanks for easy directions that also made for a quick clean up.  It was gone by the end of the day, next time I'll have to make more than one.

Great Recipe!  I have never rolled a cake and it turned out beautiful.  The pumpkin bread is perfect.  Next time I will add a bit less sugar to the cream cheese frosting, it was a little too sweet.  Definetely making for thanksgiving.  :)

This was a huge hit at my work Thanksgiving luncheon!!! It was really easy too, although I had a little trouble w/ the cake sticking slightly to the greased paper & also to the cotton towel...
Also, once it is left unrefrigerated for a little bit (on a buffet or whatever), it gets a little messy so I may pop it in the freezer briefly before serving next time to make it stay cool a little longer.

If you are looking for the ultimate pumpkin roll recipes your search ends with this one.  This is definately the best recipe ever.  I have been using this recipe for the past 4 years and nothing else compares.  I sell these at the holidays to make extra christmas cash and with sales well over 400 rolls I think that speaks for itself.  If you decide to make 5 rolls (one 29 oz can makes that) these freeze beautifully.  We found one roll about 7 mths after Christmas and it was just as moist and delicious as when first baked.

This was really amazing. I did use 4TBS of butter instead of 2TBS and I added 1TBS of Pumpkin to the Filling. Made it a bit more "pumpkin" and the filling was smoother and easier to spread.

I've made this twice today.  The first time I followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out okay.... the second time I read the reviews.  I kept all the ingredients the same but I used waxed paper instead of a towel and I think my mistake the first time was letting it cool completly.  The second time I only let it cool for about 30 minutes.  Much more easier to work with.

Been making this for years.  The trick is too not overcook it. It will crack if overcooked. I check it around 11 minutes and watch it closely.  I have had many turn out awesome and I have had a few flops.  Definitely a holiday favorite!

This did not turn out well for me.
I made this for my sister's welcome home and made it look like a sushi roll (she was coming back from a school trip to Japan). The cake was dry but manageable - there was very minimal cracking while rolling, but the filling was very dry and odd tasting as well. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

This roll was easy to do and didn't crack when rolling. HOWEVER, i didn't like the flavor of the cream cheese filling, too "pasty?". Also, you have to guess the amount of salt (about 1/2 teaspoon?) because it is in the directions but not in the ingredients list. Make sure you let it sit at room temperature before eating or it will be too tough and weird tasting.

This is the exact recipe I've used for years and I actually make these and sell them at thanksgiving to my co-workers. I have had a few crack but it was due to not spreading the batter evenly and not cooking long enough. I made fifty of these last year and only 2 cracked, I also season and bake the walnuts (sweet and spicy walnut recipe found on the back of the allspice bottle by mccormick) it gives the pumpkin roll an awesome flavor and it makes the walnuts softer!

I have made a lot of pumpkin rolls over the years and always use a different recipe and tweak it to meet my needs. This recipe was close to perfect as is. I used Pumpkin pie spice and a little nutmeg. I also put down fresh parchment paper on top of the towel before I wrapped it to be sure it did not stick. I put in freezer to cool. I did not use walnuts, as I never have and some people do not like nuts. I do think this would be a tasty addition, but I make them for gifts and wanted to be on the safe side. If this is your first attempt at a pumpkin roll: Your first 1 or 2 will not turn out as well as your next attempts. Make sure your cake is cooled enough. I use a "Pampered Chef" Cookie Stone and it is the perfect depth for the cake. It also bakes it perfectly, but make sure your oven is adequetly preheated before baking your first cake. The stone may increase your cooking time by 1-2 minutes. Do the minimum and then check it. If not springy yet, give it another minute...until it is. These make great Christmas gifts and I have even sold them to coworkers at Christmas to make a little extra cash!

Twice, I tried making the cake without it cracking when I rolled it - and both times it was a disaster.  The third try, I used essentially the same recipe but replaced the baking soda with baking powder (at the suggestion of another reviewer) - then it was fine.  If anyone has this problem, go with the baking powder instead.  The cream was delicious though...good luck!

Turned out well, easy to handle, a good basic pumpkin roll!  I found that I needed to add more confectioners sugar to the filling to suit my taste.  Thanks.

Easy to make and every liked.  I used pecans and chilled for more than 8 hours before serving.  Also - wait to dust with powered sugar right before serving, otherwise all the sugar soaks into the cake.

I am not a big pumpkin fan, so try this. Replace pumpkin with 2/3 to 1 cup cooked, mashed sweet potatoes. And 1 more tsp cinamon, 1/4 ginger, 1/2 tsp lemon juice. Bake same way and filling same. Much sweeter and my family loves it much better!  Good luck!

I've tried a few other pumpkin rolls, which were all good, but this one, oh boy!  The cream cheese filling ended up tasting like I put cheesecake in rather than a frosting.  Huge favorite with the family.

The recipe is great and the end product is wonderful. However, you forgot the salt! There isn't an amount in the recipe although further down in the instructions it tells you to put it in. I added 1/2 tsp per roll and it tastes great.

Tried this for the first time and boy was it a hit at work! Easy to do. I put the walnuts on top of the cream cheese filling before it was rolled so that they could be picked out if necessary.

This recipe was so quick (30 minutes) that I made another! I made 2 pumpkins rolls--1 with the nuts in the cream cheese and 1 with the nuts in the cake. My husband and I liked the one with the nuts in the cream cheese best.

I made this yesterday to serve as a dessert for our Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. I was very careful flouring and greasing (I used butter) the baking pan and waxed paper. I am so pleased that it turned out so well. There is a demo video on this site which helped explain the rolling up method. The directions in this recipe are quite clear too. I tried to be very patient and really took my time rolling, unrolling and rerolling. I let it cool off for a few hours. It was almost perfect - no major tears or cracks. Next time I will try to roll it a bit tighter. I don't usually like walnuts but with the other flavours they tasted very nice. I'm glad I have planned to bake a pie as another dessert because this pumpkin roll is more than half gone.
Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Very pretty and delicious. I made two rolls - on the second one I added some ground ginger (1/2 - 1 tsp.) and nutmeg (1/2 to 1 tsp.) I liked that roll a little bit better. I got rave reviews when I took them to a Halloween party. Will be making again!!

Very tasty, but I had a lot of trouble with the cake sticking to the pastry cloth, even though I had put quite a lot of sugar on it.  I will likely make this again, but I need to figure out the secret of rolling it up.  I'd give 5 stars if not for that, because it really is yummy!

I've been making this roll for the last 3 years and people die for it every single year!  I looooove it.  This year I made it for my office and my neighbors and it is always a huge hit and people always ask for the recipe.  I'm not a huge fan of nuts so I just leave that out - doesn't make any difference and the only other change I make is in the cream cheese filling I use 4 tbs of butter instead of 2, it makes it creamier and really takes the roll over th edge.  Its pure magic in your mouth!  Also, the recipe doesn't indicate this but I always trim the edges off before I package it for a gift - gives a better presentation and recipients can see the swirl.

The pumpkin roll was delicious and came out SUPER moist. It was gone in less than 24 hours. The one criticism that my family and friends had was that the cream cheese was too overpowering for the pumpkin flavor. This recipe would be better with a lighter filling like whipped cream, especially for someone who wants to actually taste more pumpkin.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was such a big hit with everyone that they asked me to make it again for Christmas!  The filling is delicious...just the right amount of sweet without being sickening.  I'd always thought that pumpkin rolls were complicated, but I couldn't believe how easy this was to make!  I made two back to back (one can of pumpkin makes two rolls with just a little left over), so the first one had a longer time to cool before I unrolled it since I was working on the second one at the time.  It was much easier to unroll than the second one, which I didn't let cool for as long.  If you're having problems with the cake splitting while unrolling, my advice would be to wait a while longer next time.

I thought this cake was just average. It has good texture, handles well rolling up, but cake flavor was just OK. Didn't have much of a pumpkin taste, couldn't even taste (or smell) the cinnamon. Might try again using pumpkin pie spice, but I'm not hopeful. Something is missing.

What a beautiful dessert!  I was a little nervous---when I spread the icing on, it looked a little thin (like I needed more).  I went ahead and rolled it and tried to roll it as tight as I could.  I couldn't wait to see what it looked like, so I cut the end off.  I was dissapointed!  It looked so whimpy!  I put it in the fridge and let it sit overnight.  The next day when we had guests over, I cut into it and it had "filled out" overnight!  It was so perfect; I couldn't have hoped for it to look any nicer!  And the taste had also developed, as well.  Thank you so much for a beautiful and easy sweet!!

This is AWESOME. I remembered this roll from when I was little and it turned out just as I remember. It was so easy and fun to make. I only baked 13 minuted to make sure it was moist and added a little extra cinnimon. Overall OUTSTANDING!!

I don't do a ton of baking, but I wanted something autumn-like for a bake sale that was taking place in October and I stumbled upon this recipe.  I was initially hesitant as I had never made a pumpkin roll, but everythi8ng turned out great.  The two rolls that I made were a huge hit!  I received so many compliments and several people asked me for the recipe.  

I found this recipe easy to follow.  I used greased/floured parchment paper, for the rolling, rather than a towel, and it worked out well enough for me.  

I made one roll with the nuts and one without.  Both rolls tasted equally great.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious! Everyone loved it. Very moist and creamy. The filling was the best part. Made exactly to recipe, minus the walnuts.

I have made this twice and it is always a hit. Just follow the recipe. Be careful about the timing on the cake. Also they do say a linen towel. I used linen the first time and a cotton waffle weave the next time. Linen works better. It was still a wonderful dessert. Highly recommend it.

The best ever! I messed around a little bit and think made it better, insted of using the regular canned pumpkin, i used the pumpkin pie mix and insted of baking soada used baking powder it makes it rise much higher and did not add any walnuts. I sell them every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas its a town fave lol

Easy and good as is.  I would like a "spicier" flavor, though.  Next time I will add more cinnamon, a bit of nutmeg, and ground cloves.

This was AMAZING!  We really loved it.  It was a great way to use the leftover pumpkin I had from another recipe.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and it turned our great!

I have not perfected this yet.  I have tried twice and both times the roll has been somewhat moist, making it difficult to roll and cut.  It could be my fault.  Next time I am going to completely let the roll cool before filling - I only let it cool 30 minutes or so.  I may even put it in the fridge prior to rolling.  Also, this is just too much filling for the roll.  The filling spills out and makes a mess.

I gave this one a four star rating.  I had no trouble rolling and unrolling the cake itself, and it had a great texture.  The downfall for me was that something in this recipe, either the cream cheese filling alone, or the marriage of the pumpkin roll and the filling, just didn't suit my pallet this time around.  (Normally I love cream cheese filling.) Luckily I made two of these rolls at the same time and I used maple buttercream to fill the second one.  OMG ... Heavenly!  My kids and I couldn't get enough!  I highly recommend trying this one with a maple  buttercream filling!!  Just use Wilton's basic buttercream recipe, but sub maple syrup for the water.  Make sure you wrap the roll in plastic wrap and chill it or it doesn't taste nearly as good.  Eng result is delicious!

Good recipe, I added pumpkin spice and nutmeg to the batter and added a little cinnamon to the filling! Very moist and shaped easily.  I would definitely wrap the roll in a soft kitchen towel to let cool completely and it shouldn't break or crack.  Yummy thank you for posting it!

I have been making this for years and lost my original recipe.  I picked this one and it was fabulous.  Just remember, oven temps may vary.  Make sure the cake is done completely before rolling in a towel or it will stick and fall apart. That happened to me with this one so I added 2-3 minutes onto the baking time with the next one and it worked perfectly.  Thanks!!!

I am not a professional baker.  This recipe turned out perfect, the cake did not crack, the filling is delicious. The only change I made was to roll in waxed paper instead of a T-towel because I feel uncomfortable rolling my food in material.  It works fine rolling in waxed paper and it also saves on washing an additional T-towel.

This is a near perfect recipe. I swapped out the baking soda for baking powder and added extra cinnamon, used 1/4th tsp of salt.   I had no problems "turning the cake onto the towel" .. but, when you go to unroll to frost I could certainly tell why everyone said to put a healthy amount of powdered sugar on the towel..  so REALLY coat your towel. My cakes only baked for 10 minutes until they were done at 375, so.   I doubled the recipe and made two rolls; mixing up the cake batters separate but making the icing double batch in the same bowl. Either I put a little too much filling on the first roll (which I don't think I did) or I could have used a bit more icing.. so, maybe make a smidge more icing if you're making two of these.   When consulting with my Grandmother (who insisted I wouldn't be able to make this Thanksgiving standard without her recipe) she informed me I probably would crack/break the first one I make and that I should make two, just in case -- but no, no cracks. I'm glad I made two though, they turned out wonderful.   Great recipe..  add nutmeg, swap out the soda for powder and don't bake quite as long. And maybe make more filling.   Thank you for sharing!

I made these for a Halloween bake sale this year but no one bought them haha. Maybe they were too expensive at $3 a slice but my roommate said she's pay that much for them lol. And now she will be eating most of them herself for free, lucky girl. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and allspice and 1/4 tsp ginger to give it more of a pumpkin pie taste. I used pecans instead of walnuts and like another reviewer recommended, I put the nuts in the frosting. Very yummy.

LOVE this recipe! I added an 1/8 teaspoon of allspice and an 1/8 teaspoon of ground cloves to the pumpkin cake to give it a little more spice flavor. I also changed flavoring in the filling to be 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. That gives it just a hint of almond that makes this a 5 star recipe! I don't use the nuts since so many people have an aversion to them, and so I've never had one crack upon rolling. I've been making these to sell in my cake business over the last 2 weeks and I have made 15 so far with several more orders for Thanksgiving! I pipe cream cheese frosting along the outside with a shell border in the top and then sprinkle shaved white chocolate. I add some white chocolate leaves and pumpkins for a fun fall flare! Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

Hi all,    Just got done making these pumpkin rolls for the first time!  They a sooo easy to make and delicious!  I found that using a baking spray such as pam worked better than the butter and flour when it comes to greasing the pan and parchmant paper.  Mine did stick a few times then I tried the baking spray.  I think I put to much powdered suger on my towel, when I unrolled it, the powdered sugar stuck to the roll and kinda crystalized...  like little hard rocks of powdered sugar.  But other than that, it was great, easy and delicious!  I used the 29 oz can of pumpkin and made 5 rolls very quickly!!  Happy baking!

My very first "roulette" type of dessert - and I am excited to say that it was NOT a disaster! :-)  I didn't have a 15x10 pan (mine was larger.. maybe 18x13?)..  but it seeemd to work just fine. :-)  The parchment paper/oil/flour is a must!  Rolling was easy, and mine did not break.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this twice during the holidays; once for the family Thanksgiving dinner and once for my hubby to take to the office Christmas thingy. Both times it was gobbled up. Everyone seemed to love it. I thought it was very good. I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had in the house. It's not diffucult to do and makes a pretty presentation.

Yummy! I haven't even had a roll yet (it's cooling) but my little nibbles here and there with a taste of the filling blew me away. 
I didn't use a dusted linen, but rather used waxed paper on both sides dusted with powder sugar.
We did have a couple cracks in the cake, but this is probably due to our error mostly (first time making a roll cake).
Next time I think I will add a little bit more pumpkin and add the walnuts in the filling rather than on the cake it's self.
We made this a few days before Thanksgiving in case it didn't work - but I think it might all be gone before the big day!

This is a very easy recipe!  It was very tasty, but just a tad dry...the cake that is.  I will change the cake up a bit and add a bit more spice as well... overall a good recipe.

An absolutely knock-out recipe. Not overwhelming 'pumkinny' - it just wowed the masses at  Fat Friday at work today!

Don't be put off by the rolling technique - it's much easier to make than it looks. There are videos online showing how to actually rollup the jelly roll.

this was a really good pumpkin roll recipe, though i agree with one reviewer that the sponge has a tendency to crack, and it is not as soft and "roll-able" as the usual jelly roll-type sponge is.

also, there really is no need to unmold the sponge onto a linen towel and roll it up and store it in the fridge and all that.  i work in a pastry kitchen and all we do is unmold the sponge onto a cooking rack, let it cool for a bit, then peel off the parchment paper and let it cool completely. and you could do the filling while this is baking and since it cools down pretty quickly, you could be done with everything in and hour or less. this really does not take two hours to make.

Well, I made 4 rolls with the intention of giving 2 away as gifts.  But didn't.  My family refused to share them they were sooo good.  Don't do anything to change the recipe.

this was good w/ some variations. i used 2xs as much filling and about 2xs as much pumpkin(made it much moister). i also used pecans instead of walnuts and added nutmeg too. at our thnxgiving dinner everyone there said it was the best they ever had.

I thought this recipe was wonderful and I am famous for messing up these rolls. No mess-ups here!!  I did add a tad more confec. sugar to the cream cheese mix.  I used an off brand and was not crazy for the taste.  The extra sugar helped.

I am not a great cook, I wouldn't even call myself good. But at a thanksgiving party on friday night, nine out of 15 people voulentarily offered compliments on my pumpkin roll. Infact, I was standing with my back to a couple and heard them say "Man this is really good, did you get the pumpkin roll, it's awesome!" All that for a guy who doesn't really cook. It was an easy recipe to make, I added about a half teaspoon of allspice and about a teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg, that really set it off. It was great, delicious and easy to make.

This pumpkin roll was easy and yummy! I was hesitant to try this as I am a rather new cook and never tried anything close to a pumpkin roll, but it was easy and turned out great...no cracks, no sticking, no problems!

This was my first pumpkin roll and it turned out excellent!  I wasn't sure about the rolling it up in a linen towel step - we searched and we don't have any linen towels!  So I used a smooth cotton one and had no problems.  This was a big hit w/ the hubbie & coworkers.

I followed the recipe exactly and my cake did not crack at all.  The cream cheese filling; however, was very soft and oozing out of the roll, but I think this was maybe because my cream cheese was too warm.  I even put some extra powdered sugar in to try to stiffen it up a bit but no luck.  It did taste delicious.  Thank you for sharing.

This is so good and fun to make that I have now made a few. I think it's very important to beat the eggs for the full 5 minutes and to use baking soda, not powder. Also, so it wouldn't dirty a towel, tried rolling the log in both wax paper and parchment paper...big mistake. Both logs rolled with paper sweated and did not look nearly as nice as those made by rolling in a towel, as suggested in the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a teaspoon of cinnamon to the filling, in addition to the vanilla (we are cinnamon fans). I think the nuts look so pretty baked on the bread. I did forget them once and added them to the filling. It tasted good but just didn't look as pretty.

This recipe is pure evil and addicting. People could not stop eating it. There were no leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out "picture perfect" according to my family and friends. I had never made any type of roll and was terrified to try at first, but I managed to roll it both times without any cracks. This is a keeper and I will certainly make all year long. I have already had several requests to make it again. I am hoping to get more than one piece for myself the next time :)

AMAZING! My family told me I'm not aloud to wait for holidays to make this. I had to make 2 for Thanksgiving. The only change I made was add a tablesppon(ish) of sourcream to the second one. It came out just a little more moist. But other than that a new family favorite!

I have been using this version for about 4 yrs now, The only substitution i made was using pumpkin pie spice instead of Cinn. Then 2 yrs ago philly cheese came out with a Pumpkin cream Cheese so now i use that instead of regular and these are to die for. Also add 1/4 tsp of spice to cream cheese. I like spice

I did not eat pumpkin pies because I personally could not tolerate the medicine-y taste. Six years ago, a close family friend made pumpkin roll for our Thanksgiving potluck and I was hooked :). We usually had to wait for the Holidays to get a taste of her pumpkin roll so that was a bummer :(. UNTIL I rolled the dice and clicked on this recipe! Dayum! :) This recipe is OUR favorite now and the only thing I tweaked was the amount of sugar in the filling. But otherwise TEN STARS! Thank you!

This recipe is really good. I have made it many times, and I have found that my family prefers to have real pumpkin gunk over the canned stuff. Also, I go by tasting and normally add a little more pumpkin then asked for, as well as a few other spices. My mom has taken some into work, and everyone loved it. They said it tasted better than the store bought one. I gave this 4 stars, because although it is really good, if improved a little, it is fantastic.

Taste was great, the cake consistency was moist. I gave this a 3 start because I tried making it twice and both times the pumpkin mixture came out sticky and very hard to roll up. It came out more like pumpkin bread...thick. I tried rolling it and the whole thing stuck together, I even tried using parchment paper to help...same result. Seems like something's missing here.

To make this even tastier, I used 3/4 teaspoon of vanilla butter nut flavoring instead of plain vanilla in the filling.  It makes a big difference.  also, I baked this for Exactly 15 min. and tipped it directly onto the towel without testing for doneness and it was perfect!  You can also use waxed paper instead of the parchment and treat it like the parchment paper and just peal it off  after it's tipped out.

It was unclear as to whether to roll with nuts out or in the middle, I rolled then into the middle! I found the recipe easy to follow other than that!

Delicious recipe! One thing I like about making pumpkin spice anything is that you can add a variety of spices to make it even more savory. I added 1/4 table spoon of ginger powder and a pinch of chinese 5 spice powder and nutmeg to give it a more complex taste. To clarify, when the recipe says to beat it for 5 minutes your egg/sugar mixer should look like creamy foam this was what I missed the first time around.

Absolutely delicious! I pulled mine out of the oven after 12 minutes and it was perfect and moist. Make sure there is a good coat of powdered sugar on the towel so it won't stick!

I love this recipe.  Very simple and easy to follow.  I refrigerated the roll overnight before adding the filling and had no trouble with it falling apart.

I LOVE pumpkin pie and was so excited to try this when a friend brought it to a get together. I was so pleased with the combination of the pumpkin cake and cream cheese filling! Plus it is so pretty! I was anxious to get home and try to duplicate it, found this recipe and made it without change except for the nuts (preference). Very good! I have made it several times since then and have played around with the spices. I find that cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg (or even the pumpkin pie spice blend you can purchase) make it even better! I am always asked for the recipe. If you are a pumpkin fan you must try this! Truly delicious!

i have made this about 6 times during Thanksgiving and it's always a hit. I have used fat free cream cheese and 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar on a couple of the rolls and it still gets a thumbs up!

As a novice baker, I wasn't sure I could make this, but it was easy. It tasted great. If you like carrot cake, you'll love this recipe. The only thing different I did was I added a couple shakes of almond extract to the filling and I used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts. Deee-lish. I just happend to watch a cooking show on TV and they made a roll cake. So I used the tip of starting the roll with your hands and then ust use the towel to push it along and roll it. Not sure if it made a difference. But it was my first roll cake and it didn't crack! Next time, I'm going to make a chocolate sauce and drizzle it over this cake. Yummy.

This is one of the best pumpkin rolls I have tasted.  Only change I made is to add a bit of pumpkin spice to the batter and the filling. I will make this again and again. Thanks!

Made this yesterday, and may I say it was totally AWESOME!!  I made exactly to the letter, and the only problem I had was a crack in cake when doing final roll, was towards the middle so was easily hidden.  I will be making this roll many, many time....thanks BUCHKO

My first jelly roll, and it worked out really well--no cracking or falling apart, or anything.  I cut down the sugar in the batter to about 2/3 of a cup, and next time, I think I'll do the same with the filling; it was a little too sweet for my taste.

I've made a few different pumpkin rolls, this one is the best by far. The cream cheese icing is even better, this is the best cream cheese filling recipe ever and I plan on using it for any other recipe that calls for cream cheese filling. Thanks!!!!

I've been making these for years. If I remember correctly, my husband proposed to me not long after I made him his first pumpkin roll. He even licks the bowl and beaters after I make the icing! You can't go wrong with this recipe, it is a keeper for sure.

Personal recipe says bake at 350 for 15 minutes.  Also...turn cake onto waxed paper and roll up leaving at least 5 minutes.  Unroll and spread cream cheese filling on layier and roll up again.  Wrap tightly in foil, refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

This is one of the best things I've ever cooked.  I made it for a company bake off and took 1st prize.  The only thing I've changed is that I double the filling (which makes a big difference).

This is a huge crowd pleaser, I have created a tradition that requires me to bring a pumpkin roll to every event and location I attend during the holidays. I have other recipies that I have used in the past, But I think I will stick to this one from now on.Very good, fairly easy to make. Just follow the directions. I have been adding ground cloves, nutmeg & a little ginger to the cake so it taste more like the pie. Thank you for submitting this Roll

I make this recipe every Christmas for dessert.  It is beautiful and so delicious.  It may take a try or two to get down the towel method.  Also, make sure you have a nice big shallow pan so it isn't to thick.

My roll did crack, but this was my first time making any sort of roll, so I will not blame that on the recipe yet.  I took this too a Thanksgiving dinner at my in-laws last night, everyone loved it!  I had always been afraid to try it, but this year I talked myself into it.  Am I ever glad I did, it was not as intimidating as I always imagined it to be!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very good pumpkin roll recipe.  I didn't change a thing except I did not have nuts, so the first one I made was without nuts.  I definitely prefer the nuts added.  I went to the store and bought nuts and made 3 more.  I love pumpkin rolls and I will definitely use this recipe.

Good and easy.  I left out 1/2 the sugar for the filling and it was just right.  My daughter really liked it and it was pretty.

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving to give us more choices for dessert. Everyone loved it and told me it's going to be a definite staple on our Thanksgiving dinner table 'or else!'... :)

Everyone loved this recipe! I actually doubled the amount of spices and found I still could have added more. I also added some of that amount into the frosting I had made beforehand so that it could blend together. I'll definitely make this one again

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!  Since moving to CA from PA, no one has ever even heard of pumpkin roll- so I had to make it myself.  This recipe is amazing.  It is just like the recipes from home.  I make this around Thanksgiving and make them for my husband's co-workers and boss and for our friends out here- everyone loves it.  Great recipe, thanks again!

Oh we LOVE this one!!! It's definitely one of my favorites. We throw in a bit of ginger, nutmeg and cloves as well. We did not have walnuts last time, but pecans worked well instead.

I made this pumpkin roll for my son's Thanksgiving pre-school party. It came out perfect the first time! Believe me when I say I am not a baking genius. As a matter of fact, this was my first attempt at baking period. The reviews were overwhelming. Note: If you make it for school, make it without the nuts. The only suggestion: Ingredients for the cake and filling are not marked and separated. I almost threw all of the ingredients (cake & fillng) into the cake mix. I told you I was'nt a baker. Great recipe.

I have made this recipe twice and we love it. I followed the recipe and did not have any problems. I was a litte confused about how long to let it cool before adding the filling. I decided to let it cool about 20 minutes and it turned out great. Thanks!

This was mostly a great recipe. My biggest complaint was that the cake was sticking to the linen cloth and also cracked in several places. It was also a little too cake-like(too dry). The filling was wonderful though!

I was given this exact recipe independent of this website and was blown away by how many people have been using it.  Always a great hit at parties, I always end up making just one more.  Last year was up to 5.

Very good.  I did add some nutmeg and a touch of ginger to the batter.  My end pieces did not have much filling and had to cut them off.  Next time, I would cover the ENTIRE cake with filling before rolling it back up.

Success!  This was my first effort at making a pumpking roll and it came out perfect!  We had friends over for a Christmas party and I have always loved pumpkin rolls. I was leary about making something that might not turn out when I was pressed for time. Well, this was not only easy, but everyone LOVED it. I made the recipe exactly as written except I used pecans instead of walnuts. I dusted it with powdered sugar and served with a dollop of whip cream. YUM! The recipe was taken home by several of my guests. Thanks for the keeper!

I didn't really like the filling recipe (too runny), however, the pumpkin roll was okay. After it baked, it didn't turn out as sweet as I thought it would, which was a nice surprise. Plus, the layer was thinner than I thought it would be. The taste of the roll was pretty good though.

This is the first pumpkin roll I've ever made and it turned out wonderful. You have to be careful not to overcook the cake, and like other users said, let it cool completely before you unroll it.  I compared it with other recipes and added more cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg, which was great. I was expecting a more dense cake and was suprised but pleased with the spongy texture. I think it will be more like what i expected after it is frozen.

YUM!  First time I made a roll of any kind.  Turned out great.  The roll was moist and beautiful.  I added a pinch of nutmeg and used pecans instead of walnuts.  I got 2 rolls out of this recipe.

This recipe deserves far more than five stars!!! What a hit! I would not be allowed in the door for Thanksgiving dinner without at least a few of these! I had been using a similar recipe for the last few years, but the waxed paper always seemed to stick to the cake.  This recipe is so easy...and no problems with the waxed paper. Thank you, Nancy!!!

Made it 2 times this season. I am not a baker.  Ive bought some from people around the holidays to avoid store bought.  This recipe is easy.  So moist and delicious. First time i didnt have wax paper n my pan was a little small used the towell. Came out perfect!! 2nd time...same small pan but have wax paper to line it with and i used wax paper sprinkled with c. sugar to roll the cake. I noticed some recipes call for pumpkin spice but this was AWESOME untouched. Till i bought a cheap can of pumpkin that literally taste like pumpkin.  A little more cinn or anything will fix that cuz this recipe is perfect!!!!  Let the cake cool!!!!

I've made this several times with great results. I've  also tried swapping out the pumpkin for strawberry or peach puree. Also delicious! :-)

I made this recipe according to the directions and it was a big hit at our weekly family football get-together. I will definitely make it again, probably for a Thanksgiving snack or dessert.

OMG. What have i done? Mine is horrible! Did anyone else not have the right size pan? I can’t find a 15x10x1”. I have the traditional cookie sheet and a glass dish that’s more for lasagna or brownies. I used the smaller one bc i didn’t want it to be too thin in a 17” pan. I let it cook 5 minutes longer, it’s sticky, under done, broken in like 3 places. Stuck to the towel. Everything is wrong... anyone? I even fancy myself a bit of a baker, but EPIC fail here... help!

This is the same recipe that I have been using for pumpkin roll for over 30 years (so obviously a keeper).  It always gets high praises ... many have asked for the recipe, and it is always requested to bring for Thanksgiving dessert.  I am  not a fan of nuts, so I have always omitted the walnuts but  that is the only difference in the way I make it vs. what is written here.

My favorite fall recipe to make and everyone’s request for Thanksgiving! The recipe is quick and easy. The key is beating the eggs for 5 full minutes making the roll light and fluffy. I usually make it without the walnuts.

I did not like this, i must of did something rong? My entire family said _No_ to this, I taste No pumkin. (I taste Mash) 
Not yummy at all. And I did a pan smaller then what it said, it said 15-10 but I did 12-8 and STILL was SUPER THIN, I was afraid that it was not enough mix. I floured the pan, lined with wax paper, and greased it, BUT STILL 1/4 of the dough stuck to it after pealing the wax paper....

This was fantastic!! And it seemed to get even better after a few days in the fridge. I made this following the recipe exactly except for using pecans instead of walnuts (definitely recommended) and it turned out amazingly! Definitely be patient and let the dough cool after baking then let the completed roll chill completely. It's worth it! This was a perfect mix of everything, good amount of pumpkin, sweetness, nuts, filling. This was a big hit and I will definitely be making this again. It'll probably become a Thanksgiving must-have!

I have attempted pumpkin rolls in the past and they fell apart.   I have made this recipe 3 times now.   
The only change I made is up the pumpkin as I do with pretty much any pumpkin baked item.   I line the baking sheets with parchment paper, bake the cake, then within a minute of pulling from the oven, I roll the cake up. I let it cool that way. I unroll every few minutes to let steam out, then roll it back up.   

I have taken them to work and the slices are gone within the first 15 minutes.  I have 3 more in the oven as I type getting ready for Thanksgiving.

I used a nonstick baking pan lined with parchment. While baking, it's best to check if it's done. I baked it for 14 mins instead of 15 mins and cake cracked as I rolled it and edges were slightly over-baked. Just cut off ends for your presentation. Can adjust sugar level to your taste. Tasted great still. Ps, I got rave reviews when I brought it to my niece's elementary for citizenship awards assembly reception. Even the skinny moms loved it! (Only school district complains about sweets)

I didn't have any wax paper so I used a 1/2" of vegetable oil in the baking pan and didn't have powdered sugar so I melted the sugar in a pot with the butter for the filling in hopes of not having sugar grit in the filling so I boiled it until it looked like a science experiment and fluffy then mixed the cream cheese in while hot then put it in the freezer for a bit to cool.  There was not a single crack in the roll and it was thin.  The filling tasted like cream cheese pudding, everyone loved it.

This was really good but I found rolling the roll with nuts was more tedious than without nuts. Used homemade Sicilian Cream Cheese, a mixture of 2 rolls with homemade pumpkin puree, and 1 roll with homemade pumpkin butter. The pumpkin butter gave it a richer taste and darker color but both variations tasted great.

Pretty good, In my oven I baked 10 min and it was very dark.  So depending on your oven you might not need to bake the full 15 minutes.

First time to ever make a "roll" type dessert and even tho I was bit leary, it came out beautifully and tastes like heaven. Love love love it.   
  I did double the recipe and make two, also didn't put any nuts in it- first time out was afraid of it cracking.  Plan on making more -a bunch more!

Second review after second try.   A couple of notes I'd like to add:  

I baked it for 10 minutes this time and that was plenty.  It was less dry.  

Need to add extra time for clean up as there is no way around the mess.  Start to putting in the refrigerator was 2 hours.  Maybe I'll get faster on my next try but the powdered sugar and the towel you wrap it in is always a mess. 

Mine did not pop out of the pan so I used a knife around the edge as I do for cakes and it came out much easier. 

May cut back the walnuts to 1/3 cup.  Last time I did 1/4 cup and think it needed more.  Used 1/2 cup this time and it seemed a bit too much.  

First review after first try:  
I made this the other day for a party and everyone loved it. I had never made a pumpkin roll before and even though it was a bit messy when rolling it in the powder sugar it was easy to make.  It only took about 1/2 half of a small can of Libby's pumpkin. I made it exactly according to the recipe except for one little change.  I only added 1/4 cup walnuts because that is all I had.  Wish I'd had more because it would have been even better with the recipe's suggested 1/2 cup.  

One of the reasons I liked this so much is because it was not heavily spiced and not super sweet. It sliced up beautifully after I wrapped the finished product in Saran Wrap and refrigerated it overnight.  

Thanks for sharing. I will definitely make it again.

Very good recipe! While an avid baker, this was my first time making a "roll" cake. I could not find Linen clothes; even went to the fabric section at walmart and they had none. So I bought a piece of unbleached muslin, and that worked just fine. I kept it rolled up in the muslin aprox 20 min. It was still a tiny bit warm when I unrolled it and put the filling in, but I filled it, rolled it, stuck it on a plate, covered in plastic wrap, and set in the freezer for 2 hrs. Set beautifully. I did make a cpl tiny changes; I added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and a little less than 1/8 tsp ginger, since those usually go with pumpkin. Also, after reading the reviews, I decided not to put the chopped walnuts in the cake, but instead mixed them into the filling.(the filling I did 3 cap-fulls of vanilla, and added about 1/4 c more icing sugar bc as written, tastes a little bland, imo) Anyways, recipe was a hit, and I will most definitely make this again. Delicious!

I absolutely love this recipe. Personally mine didn't crack at all. You just have to take the cake out right away and roll it up and it won't crack. The taste is amazing.

This is the most delicious roll I have ever eaten! Super easy to make, it's spongy, moist and definitely a crowd pleaser!! I use my kitchen-aid mixer to ensure that the eggs are nice and beat make sure to set a timer. My first one I made I didn't do it for 5 minutes and it was not that spongy. I have rolled it in parchment paper just because I didn't have the linen and it becomes very sticky and it cracks. However now that I have the linen it NEVER cracks and rolls perfectly everytime.

I thought this pumpkin roll was awesome. I used purpose flour and omitted the baking soda. Also I didn't use walnuts. It turned out great. I will definitely be making this many times over.

Searching through the web, both tired and aggravated trying to find the perfect recipe to make for a Halloween party. I suddenly came through onto this website and found this recipe. I found myself preparing this dish and VOILA! Like magic it came out perfect and crisp. At the Halloween party, many were complementing on this particular dish and asked me to make another for a Thanksgiving party. And then suddenly I knew that this was already going to be a huge hit!

My cake was spongy, but the frosting is to die for!!! Best Cinnabon dupe I've found. The sponginess is probably part of the normal texture of a "roll," or it may be because I used pumpkin that was canned fresh at home.

I've been making it for years.  This year I've made three (so far).  I added the walnuts to the batter of one of them instead of putting them on top.  I made a second one with mini chocolate chips in the batter, and a third one with both mini chips and walnuts in the batter.  I haven't tasted any of them, but I can't imagine that good stuff added to good stuff wouldn't come out to really good stuff.  Now on to making a chocolate cake roll with coffee liqueur which is on Allrecipes. (Made one last year with the little homemade "mushroom" candies  and it was wonderful!)
Update - The one with the mini chocolate chips was the best of the bunch! Everyone loved it.

I've made this twice now and have decided to add it to the family tradition for the holidays.  I serve mine with blue berries, raspberries, and blackberries...OMG heaven!!! Although the second roll I made cracked on me, it was still delicious and i'm convinced it was human error.  I would suggest this recipe to anyone.  Thanks for sharing this masterpiece with us.

I have used this recipe several times when in a hurry & it has always turned out awesomely!  However, there are mistakes in it. It should call for Baking POWDER not SODA. Should also be baked at 350* & it does not take 2 hours. I prefer fresh pumpkin, it gives it a true pumpkin flavor with out preservatives.  I give it 4 stars. Check out my Facebook page "It's all in the WHISK " for your confection  needs.

I've made this roll twice now! I have a 15x11 pan and I always double both the cake & frosting filling. I add a teaspoon of nutmeg to the cake recipe and bake the cake in wax paper dusted with flour. I use the same parchment paper that I bake the cake in to roll the cake. I put the cake immediately in the freezer for twenty minutes to cool while I make the frosting (It winds up being the perfect size to squeeze in the freezer door shelf, which helps maintain the shape as it cools). I also add heavy cream to the frosting which makes it taste a little less like cream cheese with sugar, and more like frosting. It also gives it a nice whipped texture, keeping the filling thick but not so dense. I also add a little extra vanilla to the frosting filling. I don't use nuts and the cake always rolls perfectly!

This is the perfect fall treat and will last in the fridge for a long time!

But one thing I do not add the  walnuts.

I have always wanted to make a pumpkin roll but had never found a recipe that I thought would work. Well, I made this one today and it come out just fine! I followed the directions as above, except I omitted the nuts (allergy), I got a dense, moist cake that rolled easily and a wonderful, creamy filling. I think next time I will add a little pumpkin pie spice to the cake for a little extra flavor, but I am very pleased!

This is an awesome recipe!! This is however the first pumpkin roll I have ever attempted. I completely agree with Miss Kate. It is much much better the next day!!! I got so many rave reviews on this. I mad a half a dozen of them and froze them. I then sliced them and took them to church. I had people coming up to me telling me they would like to buy my pumpkin roll. A+++++ Love it!!!!

This pumpkin roll wasn't bad. The cake was slightly too dry for my taste, the cake wasnt very sweet, and it wasn't dark enough... maybe it needs some brown sugar or molasses? I was looking for something more like what you can buy at a bakery: Moist, rich, sweet, delicious. The frosting was delicious however! I followed the recipe to a T and assuming it came out correctly, I dont understand why this has been rated so highly. I'm just glad I made this for my family and not for a party or someone else because it's not very impressive.

Super easy for first timers! This recipe will yield lots of compliments! The only tweak I made was leaving out the walnuts, and I rolled it up starting at long side. This resulted in approximately 14 1" slices. For storing, I wrapped in parchment paper then rolled tightly in seran wrap to allow for an air tight seal. We ate it within 2 days, so it was not at risk of drying out!

I can't find anything wrong! I accidentally used the wrong pan so I didn't roll it up, rather frosted and cut into squares and sprinkled a little cinnamon on top. Big hit!

I made my first pumpkin roll with this recipe. The texture was spongy and the taste was great. I didn't have any problem with cracking. If someone is having trouble they might try a different brand for some of their ingredients. Quality counts.

It was ok, but no cigar. #1 it cracked and #2 too dry. I omitted the walnuts for raisians due to allergy.

My husband wanted a pumpkin roll...lost my recipe & found this one, (Really happy now that I lost my vesrion!!) ;o)  We don't have a cookie sheet with "edges"....so we opted to make this recipe into Pumpkin Roll II CUPCAKES!! There are FANTASTIC!! (Kept the oven temp at 375 and baked for 13 minutes). We doubled the recipe to make exactly 24 cupcakes as well as doubled the filling/(frosting) recipe. (Had PLENTY filling for those EXTREME filling lovers!!) We did leave out the walnuts!!

I made this cake for a bake sale at work. I made the recipe exactly as stated, no substitutions. I had 5 roll cakes, so the night before I brought some slices in to work for samples and to build up a clientele. It was awesome -every last one of the slices of cake was sold, and people on other shifts were chasing me down for the recipe! This recipe is a definite keeper!!

This is the BEST pumpkin roll recipe I have ever tried. I followed all the instruction to even using the linen towel and this rolled up so easy.  The only thing I altered was to add 1/2 tsp vanilla and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinamon.

I gave a low rating, but it is probably just because I am not a good baker. What does it mean by bake until it bounces back? I did that, but after cooling and unrolling and adding the mixture, it completely fell apart! It was a disaster!

I chose this recipe over the other pumpkin roll recipes bc it didn't have nutmeg...and I don't know about the other ones, but this one was AWESOME! Turned out fabulously, especially the intense cream cheese filling (this isn't a super-light dessert). One thing for anyone out there: you can also use wax paper in place of parchment paper.

This was outstanding.  I have never made a roll before- it is so easy!  I used half agave and half sugar- that was the only thing I did differently and it was amazing!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Fabulous!  I made 10 different desserts for our Christmas party tonight and my husband talked about this pumpkin roll more than the pecan pie, key lime pie, german chocolate cake and all others!  Next time I'll cut off the dry edges of the cake before I put in the cream cheese filling.  Otherwise fantastic!

Oh boy, just made this for the first time (second time ever trying a roll type dessert). The taste is absolutely immense! The roll did crack in a couple places despite following the recipe to a T, so got 4 stars for that. But the taste is 5 stars for sure!    I added a few chocolate chips to the filling and a teaspoon of pumpkin spice instead of the cinnamon. I used self-raising flour instead of all-purpose and therefore did not put in any baking powder.     When they say use lots of powdered sugar for it, they really mean it! Definitely a keeper, would like to figure out how to do it without cracking, but as I said, the taste makes up for the cracks. :)

I left out  the walnuts to save money, and there is just too much cream cheese taste. It's a very good taste, but I just wish I could enjoy more of the pumpkin bread taste like I'm used to with Pumpkin Logs.  On the plus side, following the instructions, it was very easy to make on my first try.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a huge hit. Better yet, I made it on Tuesday and Thursday it still looked and tasted excellent. Easy to make -- a keeper.

This is a great addition/substitution for a pumpkin pie.    I still experienced some cracking in the pumpkin cake, and I could taste a bit of the baking soda.  I anticipate that the way you would avoid breakage is by making the cake as thin as possible.  And to avoid the hint of baking soda, either only putting 3/4 teaspoon soda and/or sprinkling the log completely with confectioner's sugar.

Very good and EASY! My mother told me not to even attempt a dessert roll, but I am glad I did! I added cloves and nutmeg and mixed chopped pecans in the icing. I have 3 brothers and 2 cousins over so this dessert was gone in 5 mins! I suggest doubling for larger families. Also next time I think I will try adding ginger. Overall great recipe and EASY!

Awesome and simple recipe! Made one for work and people could not stop commenting on how great it was! Had enough pumpkin to make another that same night for my family and folks since there were NO leftovers from the first! Definitely worth making again and again!

Fantastic! This is (with the exception of Cherlys Cookies pumpkin roll) The best pumpkin roll i have ever had.  It stayed moist and the filling was great. I added the nuts to the filling as other reviewers recommended. I think if i make this in the future i will add salt, a little more pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice. The Cake part needed a little something, but other then that it was great.

Having made pumpkin rolls using many different recipes, I'd have to say this one tasted the best! The texture was perfect and it even won a prize at my work potluck! I followed the directions exactly and even though it cracked slightly upon rolling it was still better than any other recipe I have previously used. Also, the cake was less spongy and I liked that better! Set up best when I kept it in the freezer until the day I used it.

The first one I made was good, but I added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the next one. It gave it a little more flavor. It's now my "go to" recipe for a pumpkin roll.

I really liked this roll turned out perfect, but for my icing I did cream cheese, sugar, butter and whipped cream mixed in alot better then the regular, but the roll was very good.

I may have messed something up but after I cooked the dough and chilled it fell apart, I tasted it and it was very bland not disgusting but not very good either. I didn't even make the icing I didn't want to waste the cream cheese.

I have made this a dozen times and it is very well written as is.  Just don't go light with the powdered sugar on the towel.  This ensures that the cake will seperate without sticking to the towel when unrolling. It also freezes well so you can make an extra one, freeze it and enjoy it a month or two later!

I made this as a change of pace for Thanksgiving instead of pie.  My family loved it though I did a few changes instead of regular white sugar I used splenda and I also used 1/3 of the fat cream cheese and moved the nuts to the cream cheese center. It was a huge hit also making it a little easier for the members of my family who are diabetics. The recipe over all is excellent. I will make this again.

All I can say is this was FANTASTIC! I loved it (as did everyone else who tried it!) I guess I used a pan that was a little smaller than what was called for becuase it was a little thick... but it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing!

This was really bland. The frosting was good, but I don't know why this was getting such good reviews. I won't make this again.

I have successfully used this recipe for the past 6 years. I love it, and so does everyone who tries it. I find this to be one of the easiest recipes to work with.

I did not attempt to make this at first because I thought it was going to be a daunting task however it was not as 'complicated/time consuming' as I thought it might be and this roll was delicious. The only thing I omitted was the nuts.  I will certainly make this again.

Tasty, but I had a few problems with the recipe.  I didn't have any parchment paper, so I just butter and floured the pan.  However, my cake was still gooey after 15 minutes in the oven (which I didn't discover until I tried dumping it out and half of it stuck in the pan).  I went ahead and made 1.5 times the recipe for the filling, which actually made more than I really needed (it's fine though since we really like it).  I'll definitely pick up some parchment paper and see if that helps next time, but I'll definitely up the bake time a bit, too.

I first found this recipe about 4 years ago, I made it for Thanksgiving dinner. Not a year has gone by since that all my relatives haven't asked me to make it again and again! Excellent cake roll, I have made this recipe several times and none of my cakes crack like the other user stated, follow the directions and your cake roll will turn out great.

This recipe was awesome! My husband ate some before it cooled and was ooohing and aaaghing. It was gone within a few hours! The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I don't think it was enough frosting so instead I multiply frosting quantities by 1.5 for a little extra.

This is the first time I made a pumpkin roll, and I was surprised at how easy it was to make.  I just worked with a towel that wrapped around my jelly roll pan so that the 3x sugar didn't fly up when I flipped it over.  This pumpkin roll also freezes very well.  I wrapped it in plastic wrap and then in foil.

This pumpkin roll was indeed very easy and tasty. The only thing was the filling was a little too sweet and pasty for me, so I added 8oz tub of Cool Whip to make it a little more fluffy and it evened out the sweetness. It was a beautiful roll and absolutley delicious. There wasn't a crumb left when I took it to Thaksgiving potluck.

Excellent pumpkin rolls recipe! Like most other people, I've tried several recipes, and this one is the best and only one I'll need from now on! Don't need to change a thing, except to make 1 1/2 times the amount of icing. At least for our taste. Thanks for a great recipe!

I had never even heard of these until my husband asked me to make one.  My grandma used to make pumpkin cookies and I NEVER even tried one...I dont like pumpkin.  I made this and it smelled so good I had to try it.  It was WONDERFUL!!!  I made extras to take to family for the holiday and everyone loved it, NO LEFTOVERS!  Turned out perfect!

I will first say that this recipe was delicious, and everyone loved it.  I especially liked the layer of walnuts, it was a hit.  However, I could not for the life of me get it to roll up.  It was spongy, but it was sticky as all get out, and it cracked during rolling.  That was the only problem though, as far as taste goes, fantastic!

I loved this recipe.  This is the first cake roll I've ever made but I bake alot. I added a hint more cinnamon and made extra filling but otherwise left it the same.  All of Thanksgiving guests loved it and asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

I couldn't believe how well this turned-out!  I don't bake, like as in I really don't even buy a roll of cookie dough to make cookies because somehow I mess them up, and this came out so pretty and delicious!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone just loved it.  I followed the recipe except I omitted the nuts and shortened the bake time a little(I was afraid I would burn it).  The filling is so good that next time I will make extra.  Thank you!

I actually enjoyed making this.  The taste is wonderful.  It is also very easy.  The hardest part is waiting on it to cool.  I also only baked mine for around 13 minutes and it was moist and did not crack.  The only problem I had was that it stuck a bit to the wax paper so next time I will grease it a little more.  Yummy! Making another one today for a Thanksgiving dinner.

Loved it, loved it, loved it! Made it for a work Thanksgiving Luncheon and everyone gobbled it up! The only thing I would actually change is cooking it in a larger baking pan thus making the cake a little thinner. I purchased a 15x10 baking pan just for the recipe and the cake was a little thick to roll. The taste was wonderful though!

this is a two part review because I want to review it before I forget what I did and then again tomorrow when it has set.  I added nutmeg to the recipe (about a tsp) and followed the rest to a T. I let it cool in the freezer and I had no problem with it sticking to the linen.  I tasted it when finished and thought it was pretty good.  I did not think the cake itself was spicy enough.  It seemed very mellow.  We will see tomorrow.

This turned out very pretty.  I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.  I was very concerned that the recipe directions indicate that salt should be added, but the amount is not specified.  I guessed conservatively at 1/4 teaspoon.  I think that 1/2 teaspoon may have been better.  Mine did not crack and was very easy to unroll and roll back together.  I baked for about 13 minutes though - to make sure that it was just done and not dried out.  This was good, but not spectacular.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, as I've always eaten other people's pumpkin rolls but never made my own.  I was nervous that it would be too hard, but it was so easy and so good. Everyone loved it.

Oh wait, I did add some ground cloves and a little nutmeg.  

Thanks for the recipe!

I am so happy with this recipe! It worked out really well. This is my roll of any kind and it was so easy. A slight change I made was that I added some lemon to the filling for a little more 'zip'. I can't wait to let my husband try it!

Totally awesome. I would make a little more filling next time, but it was still great! I made it for a fall fest and everyone went back for more.

Great recipe! Will be making every holdiay season.  Probably more often than that actually, since my boyfriend loves pumpkin rolls.

I had never made a pumpkin roll before and was kind of nervous this was so easy and delicious I was making these and giving them away as Christmas presents.

Excellent!  Even the most discriminating person in the family just loved it!  When it was time to divide the leftover's at Thanksgiving everyone was hiding their share of this Pumpkin Roll!

Very yummy.  I plan on making it for a Thanksgiving Party that I'll be going to.  I used black walnuts when I made it last and it was good, but a little too strong.  I won't be adding nuts next time and will be adding a bit more filling... 
It's sure to be a hit at the party!
