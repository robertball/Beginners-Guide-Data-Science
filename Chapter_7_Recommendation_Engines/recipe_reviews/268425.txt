Boy, this was a lot of work! But Boy, was it worth it? YES, YES, YES! This is the BEST Italian Cream Cake I have ever had! It makes quite a big cake so I was able to slice and freeze 1/2 of it. That way whenever I have a taste for this I can just reach into the freezer and be eating this in a couple of hours. I will be making this for an upcoming family get together and I know they will absolutely love it!
