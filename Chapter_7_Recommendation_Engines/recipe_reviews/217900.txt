These were amazing.  So much flavor in a small bite.  I was short on time, so instead of making the "firecrackers" out of phyllo dough sheets, I brought the pre-formed frozen phyllo shells.  I stuffed the filling into the shells & heated them up.

These were pretty difficult to make and looked so non uniform that I couldn't take them as an app to a party.  Maybe I'm just bad with phyllo, but this did not look or taste very good.
