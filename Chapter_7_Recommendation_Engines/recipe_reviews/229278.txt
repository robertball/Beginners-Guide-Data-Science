Really, really good!  Instead of using cooked chicken, I put a couple raw chicken breasts in with the broth and lime juice and cooked on low for about 5 hours.  I then shredded it and added the rest of the ingredients (added some sliced zucchini) for about 1.5 hours.  Delicious!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  It was different than most white chilis I have had in the past and I actually liked it better.  The use of the green salsa gave it a nice depth of flavor.   Make sure when you are buying your green salsa you buy the salsa verde.  There is also a green salsa in my store that I buy that is a pureed jalapeno salsa and is really spicy and a little bitter.  The salsa verde is slightly spicy and has a nice tang from the tomatillas.  I used yellow corn instead of white - but, otherwise made according to the recipe.

Delicious!  I added a can of black beans and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh one.  I also omitted the cilantro because I don't care for it.  Very good and seems healthy.

I made this soup thinking that it would be good, but not great.  Boy was I wrong.  This soup was packed with flavor.  The green salsa (I used medium) and green chilies really add a lot to the broth and taste of this recipe.  The one change I made was to add a half opened can of black beans to the mix, so that I could use them up.  My DH & DS added some jalapeño salsa to theirs to kick the heat up to another notch.  We all enjoyed this for dinner with a piece of homemade bread and everyone was happy that we had enough for leftovers. I did make this on the stovetop in a stockpot rather than the slow cooker.

Like another reviewer, I cooked the raw chicken in the broth and lime and then shredded it and added the rest.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes.  The flavors are really great and surprising!  Definitely will make it again.

This is a really good white chili, albeit very different. I really liked the cilantro and lime flavors. Since fresh tomatoes looked terrible, I used a can of diced tomatoes, drained, instead. It's easy, quick, and quite tasty.

This is one of my favorite recipes because it's so yummy, healthy, and easy to make. As other users suggested, I usually put in a couple raw chicken breasts with the ingredients and cook on low for 5-6 hours. I then shred the chicken breasts and mix them back into the soup/ chili. I usually leave out the cilantro and green onions and add in a bit of chopped onion and half a can of drained black beans. Throw in some tobacco and/ or crushed red pepper and this dish is golden! Don't forget to serve with warm, fresh baked bread.

Delicious! Has great texture. Took another's suggestion and used raw chicken. Cooked it for 5 hours w the lemon juice, chicken broth, and twice the lime. Added the rest of the ingredients (diced tomatoes instead of fresh) plus white beans and extra corn, then cooked for another hour. Was superior to my first batch. I like the idea of adding zucchini as well.

I really enjoyed this and I would make it again. I just put raw chicken in the pot, used a can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh tomatoes and cooked on low for 5 hours. I also put a dollop of low cal sour cream on top. With the sour cream, this wound up being 5 smart weight watcher points.

So good. But I cook this for 6 hours on low just to make sure the meat is very tender.

This recipe was ok, but really not that great for me.  Partly it was just way too salty (which I can't really figure out, since no salt was added, so it must have been the broth or the salsa I guess?  I even used frozen corn instead of canned so there was no extra salt there...)  Anyway, it just wasn't really what I wanted when I was expecting white chili, and it wasn't fantastic enough to make up for the fact that I was disappointed it wasn't more like regular white chili.  I'll eat the leftovers, but probably won't ever make it again.

I made this for the first time and loved it. Followed the recipe closely. I questioned cooking it on low for one hour and was right in my suspicion. It required a good hour on high to warm it through properly. The flavors all worked well together. I would definitely make it again.

I have been looking for vegan recipes, so I decided to try this one, but leaving out the chicken. I also experimented using a can of hominy, instead of corn. I just used regular salsa, as that is all I had on hand. The lemon juice and lime juice really bring out the flavors. I like this a lot, thanks for the recipe.

I loved this one! It turned out a little soupy but if you want it thicker, you can always add a tablespoon of flour to thicken it up. I like my food spicy so I added a bit of crushed red pepper to the pot. This one is definitely going into rotation.. I love how easy it is to make! Pair it with some bakery bread and you're all set.

Made this for a Soup and Salad potluck at work.  First time I made it.  Super easy and every loved it.  I was afraid it would be to hot/spicy but it wasn't it! I add 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and more lemon juice and lime juice than it called for so perhaps that took some of the hot out of it.  Will make again!

Super easy......I made it when we were camping.  I didn’t have any fresh cilantro so I used dried.  I definitely recommend you make sure you use the fresh stuff.  It would give it that extra flavor that is needed.

I’ll be honest. Nobody in my family was crazy about this. I had two complaints: the soup was very brothy. There just wasn’t enough “chunk” to it for my taste. If I ever make it again, I would double the beans, double the corn, and maybe add some other vegetables as well. Secondly, there is no way this makes 12 servings. It makes six servings...at the most. Interesting concept. Interesting flavor. The final product, however, was a little disappointing.

Delicious!
I also used raw chicken,  4 whole breasts , and put in crockpot. I doubled all the other  ingredients, and dumped Them on the top of chicken. . I used 1 can of diced tomatoes as well.
After hours of cooking I shredded the chicken until it spread evenly out in crockpot mixing nicely with all the other ingredients. I cooked it for another 2 hr without lid to let the liquid steam off. 
Perfect!

Loved this--very quick to assemble.  The only thing I did was rinse off the beans.  Before serving I added tbsp of sour cream on top, and served with chips.  The boyfriend was in heaven lol

We will make this again.  I never thought to use green chili  sauce instead of salsa that we have used in the past.  Fresh cilantro also adds depth of flavor.  Thanks you for sharing.

This was so good and so easy! It reminds me of chicken tortilla soup. I served it with tortilla chips on the side and topped with chopped avocado and more cilantro

This was awesome and was super fresh. The cilantro is a much I chopped them up and threw them in the chili. I omitted the green onions and added shredded pork that I made in the pressure cooker. I think next time I will add tortilla chips into it!

This was decent. Very food flavor and came together quickly when I remembered I had guests coming over for dinner and I hadn’t gone to the store. My only hesitation was that it tasted a bit not-fresh since so many ingredients were just straight from a can.  Changes I made were to use white onion instead of green onion (what I had on hand), a can of corn and also a half can of black beans for color. I also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh (again what I had in hand).  I thought it needed a bit more spice so added red pepper flakes.  In short, this was really good in a pinch. Served with a dollop of sour cream.

This chili is awesome and flavorful! Especially perfect on a chilly fall night, I used two cans of Swanson chicken breast and it was perfect.

I followed RRKALINA's modification and can confirm that was delicious! I also used my instapot and cooked the chicken and broth on the middle "normal" mode for 5 hours, then after shredding the chicken and adding everything else in I cooked it for 1.5 hours on high. Added a little bit of s&p, extra squeeze of lime, shredded cheese, sour cream, and cilantro for amazing yumminess. Next time I will be doubling this recipe and freezing the extras.

I loved it! More importantly, my husband loved it. The green onions were a little over-powering for my tastes, so I'll probably leave them out next time. Other than that, this will become a favorite for us! Thank you so much!!!

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. So easy and tasted great. I did use real chicken breast and cooked it for 4 hours on high along with the liquids. The last hour I added all the other items and cooked for 1 more hour.

This is SO delicious.  It is packed with some seriously awesome flavor!  And the leftovers the next day tasted even better I think!  Definitely will make it again.
(Side note- I also used raw chicken breasts like other reviewers suggested.)

Heaven. I used the hatch chili salsa from Trader Joe's and left on low in my slow cooker for about 5 hours. Topped with sour cream and avocado slices.

This was really good and easy! Nothing amazing or 'blow your mind,' but a good, solid and tasty meal that I will definitely be adding to my list of keepers. I also cooked some chicken thighs in the broth and citrus juices first like others did, and substituted some yellow onion for the green because that's what I had. I agree with another reviewer that said this was more like a tortilla soup than chili, I think it's a bit misnamed as is. We ate this with avocado, sour cream, shredded pepperjack, and torn up flour tortillas and really enjoyed it.

This was okay as a base recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly (only doubled it) and it was very bland for my family's taste.  I added 4oz of heavy cream and that did the trick!  I served with colby jack cheese and doritos. Yum!

Super good chili. The only change I made to the recipe was to add twice as much broth than the recipe called for. We like lots of broth in our soups. This is by far my favorite soup.

This chile cooked up tangy and light. My family piled on avocados, cilantro, chopped tomatoes, black olives and jack cheese shreds. Served with corn muffins, it was a total hit! Everyone wants leftovers in their lunch. I'll have to make a bigger batch .

I was a little worried about flavor with the lack of spice ingredients, but it is delicious and amazingly simple. We cooked thighs instead of breasts...deboned, salt/pepper, in a pan with oil and a bit of lemon juice.  Other than that...followed exactly.

The key is the lemon and lime juices.  Adds just the right touch.  Delicious--the whole family liked it very much.  I doubled the recipe, which served five with some leftover.
