For my family of one (me), I cut this recipe in half and used ketchup to avoid opening a can of tomato sauce and only using half of it. This was a minor adjustment and so I believe that my 5 star rating was deserved for the recipe as written. The meatloaf was very good, saved a lot of cooking time and I will definitely add this to my regular meal selections. I'm looking forward to a meatloaf sandwich with the leftovers. :-)

I'm sure this is  tasty. My comment is for the person about uneven cooking. When baking meatloaf in the microwave, I form it into a ring loaf with a hole in the center. 1 -1/2 to 2 pounds of ground beef cook evenly in about twelve minutes.

So I think I was like everyone else, because I was skeptical that this was going to turn out.  However, even my picky husband thought that this was amazing meatloaf!  I made it almost the same, except I used ground venison instead of beef.  Couldn't tell the difference.  The one thing that was missing was a little crust, because normally when I make it in the oven, I do a freeform loaf to get the "brown" on the outside.  However, the convenience factor MORE than made up for it!  Great recipe!

I was really pleasantly surprised by this meatloaf! I haven't made meatloaf much in the past, but we live in a foreign country and don't have an oven so this recipe encouraged me to try cooking a meatloaf in the microwave. The tomato sauce mixture was great. I didn't change a thing, and don't think I will in the future. A really yummy meatloaf!

I haven't tried this particular recipe but I have tried several microwave meatloaf recipes and love the conveinance. I have a question.....no matter which recipe I use, by the time I get the middle done, the edges are hard and burnt. This is such a waste of food cause I have to cut the middle out and eat it. I've tried covering it with a paper towel and I've tried covering it with some Press and Seal (leaving a small opening to let it vent). Is my microwave power set too high? I only cook it for 15 to 20 minutes in a loaf pan. Actually, I just tried it at 15 minutes and while the edges where already getting hard, you could tell the middle was still a little pink so I had to sacrifice the edges to get the rest of it done. Anyone have any suggestions of what I'm doing wrong?

This meatloaf was great! I never would have even considered a microwave meatloaf, except for the fact that my oven is on the fritz, and it's so hot here that I wouldn't want to use the oven, even if it was working.

I've tried many of the top-rated meatloaf recipes here, and this one is the best! Turns out much more moist than all the others I've done in the oven.

DH loved it, too! Thanks Shelby, it's a keeper!

EXCELLENT!  Very tasty, very easy, & very fast!

I did not add green pepper because I don't care
 for them.  I used Italian style panko breadcrumbs cause that's what I had on hand  (instead of saltines)

Meat loaf is no longer a"winter dish" thanks to the microwave

Until I ran across this recipe, I had completely forgotten how my mom used to cook meat loaf in the micro! 

I used this recipe with two very small changes - had no bell pepper, and used fresh garlic instead of powder.  Delicious!

This meatloaf is intended to be baked in a tube microsoft dish. I submittted a picture with the recipe but it wasn't used. The 9 X 9 microsoft dish was added by the testers. I found a new one of these at a Goodwill store for $1.50. This dish works wonderful for this meatloaf

I always make my meatloaf in the microwave.  It's a time-saver plus it keeps the meatloaf moist!  The key, I've found, is to cook at 50% power. 
I always place a paper towel on top to soak up the excess fat, as well.  It may not get as "crusty" on top as oven-baked, but the positives certainly outweigh this, in my mind!

I'm writing to pass on a tip for cooking the meatloaf. Use either a ring mold or a shallow round casserole with a small glass or custard cup in the center. Form the meatloaf around it, and it always comes out evenly cooked. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

Truly best meatloaf I've ever had. Not just moist but super flavorful. Followed 2 tips from reviewers: 1) used glass pie pan and formed meat into a ring to cook evenly; cooked perfectly in 12 min on high. 2) used ketchup vs tomato sauce. For me increased garlic powder and black pepper from 1/8 tsp to 1/4 tsp. Changed serving size to match one pound ground beef. Other than that, followed recipe to a tee. Will not use any other recipe now. This is comfort food city. Thank you thank you!

Awesome! Raising three kids has made me MORE and MORE appreciative of short-cut recipes like this one! I double the sauce to serve on the side and have meatloaf (my 7 year-old's favorite!) on the table in 30 minutes flat.

I was hesitant to try this recipe at first. Microwave meatloaf doesn't sound appetizing, but I had a craving for meatloaf and didn't want to spend two hours making it. Surprisingly, it turned out delicious and moist. I'll be using this recipe from now on. I did substitute the saltine crackers for seasoned breadcrumbs. Just try this recipe once, and you'll love it. It's easy to customize, too-- add mushrooms, garlic, chives, etc.

Easy to make! Tasted pretty good! Will have to determine the optimum microwave cooking time in our new microwave. Was a little undercooked at first, and then just five minutes more made it perhaps a little too cooked. Did make as a ring in my Tupperware Stack Cooker, using the colander to drain so it would not sit in any grease while cooking. Boy, am I glad I sell Tupperware! :-) Will definately make again!

I have not made this recipe yet but please make sure you temperature check it,  microwaves heat unevenly because they don't heat the same way an oven does and can leave cold spots harboring serious illnesses. Other than making sure your microwave is heating all the way this would be super convient and I can't wait to try

I made a few adjustments and it turned out perfectly! I used about 3/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup Italian salad dressing instead of tomato sauce, Triscuit Roasted Garlic crackers instead of saltines. My boyfriend was skeptical at first when I told him I was going to make a meatloaf in the microwave, but when he tasted it, he was pleasantly surprised. Two thumbs up for this easy and tasty recipe. I will be making it again.

OK. I tried it. I have to say it was my mistake to try to serve it to my company of 6 before doing a "test drive". I followed the recipe to the hilt. So...this is what I didn't like: too much sugar, too much tomato sauce. I would skip sugar all together. It smelled great while in the microwave. Didn't look like meatloaf at all. Crumbled when I tried to cut it into slices. Burned at the bottom (too much sugar). Thank heavens I was making sholet at the same time and could use those "crumbs" of meatloaf for that and doing so to save the dinner. I think I'll go back to the conventional way of making meatloaf. It was kind of an embarrassed to say the least. I don't think I'll attempt do use this recipe again.

I used bread crumbs, a whole red bell pepper, omitted the salt and left everything else the same.  Best to use oblong dish that is not deep.  Mine in square deeper dish took 22 mins in the microwave.

I really like this and it's good I didn't have to turn on the oven in the hot temperatures we are getting.

Made a few changes. We used spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato and added Velveeta cheese to the meat and the topping. Delish!

I did leave out the green pepper as my husband isn't crazy about them.   I love this recipe!  I myself am not crazy about meatloaf but I love this one.  Since there are only two of us I halve the ingredients.  I also use a round casserole bowl and leave an opening in the middle so that it cooks more evenly.  This is my go to recipe!

As others, I was skeptical about microwaving a meatloaf. I halved the recipe for the two of us; used a glass pie plate with a custard cup turned upside down in the middle, and arranged the meatloaf around it. Thank you sooo much. Loved not turning on the oven on a hot summer day! And, yummy too.  : )

Amazing! It came out moist and flavourful. I used more veggies (pepper and onions) than the recipe called for and I used garlic tomato sauce. My fiance was excited when he found out I was making meatloaf and then shocked when I put it in the microwave. I packed it around a baking dish and used my meat thermometer to check the done-ness. Lots of grease/oil but I just drained it out.
Thanks Shelby!

Surprisingly good texture and quite tasty, it's great to be able to have meatloaf on a work night.

This was quick and easy! Tasted just like oven baked.  I added an extra egg and covered it with extra tomato sauce.  Delish!
