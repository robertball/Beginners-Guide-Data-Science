Very Good !!   I haven't made this yet as it is Hard to find Lamb! We do have a Specialty Grocer and I will have to talk to my Own Grocer about getting Lamb.  Thank You!    Not to many lamb recipes I find here.

I made it in my instant pot  using the  slow cooker key . The results were excellent and I will cook it again.
