This may not be authentic, but it sure is good!  Even my 2 year old ate this up.  Only changes I made were to use a cooked chicken and added a can of diced tomatoes with diced green chili's.  Topped with shredded monteray jack.  Yummy!

I used cilantro in place of oregano (didn't have any) and I added about 1 TBSP of Chili Powder.  It turned out great! We added the Chili Powder because the broth had an odd look to it with white chicken, white hominy, clear chicken broth and green chilis (kind of a green cast).  My son didn't like the look, so I added chili powder -- he loved it and asked me to make it again.

ok this is excellent.  no matter if it is a posole or not, it is great.  i did make a few changes, 1. used 27 oz of pinto beans instead of hominy, 2. used 4 fresh chopped jalapenos instead of green chiles, 3. 1, 10 oz can of green enchilada saucein place of 1 can of chicken broth.  made it twice in one week.  oh yes, i used 10 chicken tenderloins instead of the breast also .

Finally got around to tasting this last night, two days after I made it. Very good soup. I think waiting to taste it also helped the flavors to come together. Topped with a dollop of sour cream. Sort of a white chili but different. Liked the addition of hominey (yellow instead of white). Added a bit more chicken, chicken broth, cumin and salt and a can of green chile enchilada sauce. When I added the enchilada sauce, it went from good/O.K. to great. Also a friend took the leftovers and mixed in a can of tomatoes with green chiles and added cilantro, cooked it down and served with rice. Very good and easy soup. Used frozen chopped onion as a timesaver.

I thought this was great. I shredded already cooked chicken meat from a deli chicken and threw everything into the crock pot and set it on low for a few hours. Yummy!

With a few additons this is really good!!! Never had posole before looked up an accurate recipe and its made with pork or pig ears.   I threw everything in crockpot didnt saute nothin.  Didnt use oil.  Used 6 pieces of chicken,legs and thighs.  I pulled the skin off first and boiled it in water for my chicken broth.  Added one half squeezed lime, added minced garlic, used cilantro instead of oregano. Added salt and extra cumin.  Put crock pot on high came back 5 hours later pulled meat off of bones threw back in.  Sitting here eating a bowl that was left over from last nite.  Its pretty good.

Great recipe. Quick and surprisingly good given the short cooking time. I was looking for a more traditional posole, so I made a few changes: omitted the green chiles and olives, added about 1/3 of a can of red enchilada sauce, and topped with chopped cabbage and radishes. This is most definitely a make-again recipe.

This was AMAZING!  I did add salt and pepper and tripled the amount of cumin!  I usualyl don't enjoy cooking for my family because my husband is a chef and I can never do as well as he does - I made this last weekend when he was sick and I got the best compliment ever from him, "I don't think even I could have done this well!"  This is definitely a keeper!!!!  I also virtually tripled the recipe because of having teenagers - nothing lasts long in our house and was perfect for us to take to work for lunch!

This was great.  Quick, easy and my husband loved it.  I didn't have olives or green chilis, but I added a can of diced tomatoes and green chilis, four diced fresh jalapenos from my garden and more cumin.

Another recipe for my "favorites" book.  This has become a standby recipe for the "i don't have time and don't know what to make" nights.  This really tastes like its been in the crock pot for hours!  The best part is that I can make it and attend to other things - like emptying and refilling the dishwasher, etc.

Very flavorful but rather than slice the olives, next time I will cut them even smaller to spread out the olive flavor.

Amazing. I've never wanted to eat the same soup for five straight days before! Like all good soups, it is even better on day two and three than it is on day one. I have single portions of this soup in the freezer and when I have it for lunch, I sprinkle a touch of parm cheese on top.

I love the recipes on this site! I take the recipe & then read the comments and add the things I like. I used the Green enchilada sauce, cut up 1 full jalapeno (no can of green chiles), added red, green & yellow bell peppers. (just what I had left over in my fridge). It was kind of thick so I added two 14.5 oz cans of chicken broth and 1 cup long grain white rice. Cooked covered until the rice was done, about 25 minutes. Served with crushed up tortilla chips, cheese & a dollop of sour cream on top! Excellent!!!!!

Delicious and easy to make soup.  I used corn as I could not find any hominy.  This soup freezes well and tastes even better after sitting for a day or two.  YUM!

Easy and delicious! I've never made posole before, but finding that I had all the ingredients on hand I decided to give it a go. What is great about this recipe is it is versatile. You can customize it to your tastes and still have great results. I used fresh chiles that I roasted and peeled the night before. Along with the chicken breast, I also added some chicken sausage. As others have mentioned, a can of Rotel tomatoes too. Yum! I think it will be even better tomorrow. Thank you!

Quick and easy and it's very good! I thought it had a nice flavor, although it is simple. I used a can of corn instead of homminy and left out the olives. My kids liked it too....I will make this again.

Different from authentic Mexican posole but still very good and easy to make.  The hominy was something a little different from all of the other soups we make.  Make sure to add lime juice and tortilla chips before serving!

What a find! Such a painless recipe for so fabulous an outcome! I, too, made some modifications based upon other reviews. I prefer more mild heat, so I substituted half a can of green enchilada sauce (thanks to those of you who figured that out before me!) and half a small can of tomatillo sauce and omitted the chiles. Lots of tangy flavor instead of heat. I also used cilantro instead of oregano. To my bowl, I added a dollop of creme fraiche, sprinkled some Mexican seasoning and garnished with chips. So good! Thanks again for sharing!

I followed all the steps the recipe called for with the exact ingredients and it was fantastic! My husband doesn't really like soups like that but he had two bowls and was disappointed that there was no more left. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing!

This was a quick and easy supper.  After tasting, I tripled the cumin and garlic, but DH and I both thought it still lacked flavor.  We served it over rice, which we thought made it more of a hearty meal.  He added Sriracha hot sauce to his.  I added chipotle powder, red pepper flakes, and plain nonfat yogurt to mine.  After these additions we thought it was good, but probably won't make again.

This is the first time I've ever had, let alone made posole, so I have nothing to compare it to.  But it was really good. Only thing I did different was used chicken thighs and browned on both sides after the onions cooked for a few mins before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I omitted the olives.  Will be making this again.

Good, simple recipe but with some changes.  1) Way too much onion.  I only used half at most and chopped, not sliced, it.  2) Omitted olives b/c I don't like them.   3) Only used 1 tsp of oregano too.  4) I did not cover the pot while cooking onions and garlic so that I could brown them for better flavor.

Bland and lacking depth.  It gives it up all in the first moment with a little kick of heat but with no complexity or savoriness in the follow on.  Won't make again.

I love the flavor of this soup! To make it more hearty and interesting, I suggest serving with bowls of cilantro, cheese, rice, some sour cream, etc.

Tasty!  I left out the oregano (didn't have any) and used real halapenos (don't keep canned chili's on hand either).  This was given a high five in my house and will definately make again.  Thank you for sharing and yes...can be made for unexpected guests in a flash.

Although this isn't an authentic posole, it tastes great. As a stand alone soup, it is full of flavor. We put some tortilla chips on top and was even better. I say try it, you'll like it. Thanks Veronica for the recipe.

Wonderful!  I doubled everything except the chilis and the olives.  I used cooked chicken and increased the cumin to 2 T.--at least!  Next time, I'll replace the oregano with basil as I think it would improve the taste...IMHO!

LOVED this!  This is one of the best meals I've made in a long time!  I did make a couple changes though.  I used a 29 oz can of hominy, only 1 chicken breast half (that's all I had), and I used Italian Seasoning, instead of oregano.  I added Monterey Jack cheese to the top when it was finished, and also added our favorite hot sauce to our individual bowls when serving.  Gave it a nice little kick!  Went over well with everyone, including my 2 1/2 year old!

Made this last night, and everyone loved it! Didn;t make any changes to the recipe. I just Googled posole, and got a list of traditional toppings...wish I had known! Definitely go with some toppings next time, although it was good as is.

This was delicious.  I omitted the chilis for the kids and then just added it into our bowls.  I added a can of diced tomatoes and at least doubled the spices.  I also made fresh tortilla chips by baking cut up corn tortillas into 8 pieces, baking on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray and sprayed the tops for 8-10 min. in a 350 degree oven. YUM!

This didn't taste like any posole that I've ever eaten before, but it was good soup nonetheless.  It was very light and the oregano and cumin really jazzed up the broth.  If you want posole, use a different recipe.....if you want a fast, yummy soup, this is the one!

Love this recipe. I usually make a Red Pork posole and wanted to try something different. Made it as directed except draining the chilies, No need to drain them. also garnished with Diced Avocados, Cilantro and fresh onion. With a squeeze of Lime. Yummy.

This soup is very easy to make and very good. My wife added blackbeans and a spicy rotel which in my opinion was very similar to a tortilla soup. Also squeezed fresh lime juice just before serving. Also crushed up tortilla chips and added some graded cheese.

Made this today for lunch and I have to admit it is a good starting base.  It was missing a few things in my opinion.  This is obviously far from authentic mexican posole.  I had to tweak it alot since my family kept making faces while i was making it.  They keeped tasting and saying "nope still missing something."  finally I guess I got it good enough to satisfy them.  They said it had more of a green chicken enchilada taste than a mexican posole.  I agreed.  I guess I would make this again but with my modifications.  Good base soup.

Quick and easy, but I couldn't find hominy so I used kidney beans. Not sure this was the best substitution. I also used chili powder to make the color a bit nicer.

Mmmmm-very easy and very tasty.  I didn't have hominy, so I used cannellini beans. I added some corn, a little garlic salt and extra olives. Next time I will use less broth and will serve with tortilla chips.

A very light and mild soup that reminde me of a white chili. I had to double the seasonings to get any taste to come through. And then ended up adding cilantro too. Two cans of broth seemed like too much liquid, so I only added one and it seemed just right. No olives.

This was good and it was fast to put together.  I was doing my shopping, and thinking that I was making posole, thought I'd just forgotten to put pork on the list.  I bought pork, so I used pork in place of the chicken.  It was very good and to me, didn't make a difference one way or the other.  Next time I'll try it with chicken.

Fairy good, spicy, nice on a cold day.  I have no idea whether it tasted authentic or not, since I've never had Posole despite my love of Mexican food.  (Maybe that's OK so I could take this recipe as is and not worry about it. :-))  I do think I would've preferred cooking the chicken first.

I found this soup to be a little bland even after adding cilantro and hot pepper.  I think it would be much better with the traditional pork.  I will try it again with pork next time.

I couldn't help but add a can of diced tomatoes, some sliced bell pepper, and some chile powder before tasting it as is. It seemed too simple for me. It was very tasty and VERY quick and easy. Will probably make again.

I thought this looked bland, with the canned peppers.  So I put in a fresh Anaheim pepper.  I didn’t change the seasoning given in the recipe.  However, I substituted cubed pork for the chicken to be more authentic.  Brown the cubed pork well in some olive oil.  Remove and reserve.  Add the onions and one large Anaheim pepper (wash, seed and dice large) and sauté until soft.  I added 1 tbs cornstarch and cooked this paste with the onions and pepper 1-2 minutes (do not let it burn).  Add the pork cubes back to the pot with the onions & pepper.  I increased the liquid by adding more broth than the recipe called for (add water if no extra broth around) and 2 cans of white hominy (drained).  Cook on med-low simmer until the pork is done.  This variation was delicious, but it looked unattractive.  To improve presentation, serve it in colorful bowls with a dollop of sour cream and some hot sauce for personal seasoning.
Experiment with brands of canned hominy.  Some are better than others.

This was so easy to make, I used leftover chicken so it was super-quick! Like some other reviewers, I added a little chili powder to give it a little more "kick" as we like spicy food. My husband even had seconds. This one's a keeper.

Very good!  I used the corn instead of the hominy as it wasn't avaiable in my grocery store.  We put shreadded cheddar on top - very tasty.

Veronica - 
Great recipe!  Very tasty!  I can see how it will be fun to play and experiment with.
The only thing I'd do different for sure is chop my onion in half and then slice thinnly so that the pieces of onion aren't hanging off the spoon with every bite.

This was only O.K. and not as "zippy" as I thought it would be.Other family members eating this said it was O.K. to have once-but they still liked my other recipes better.Jazz

LOVED this! The husband groaned through his first 5 slurps of this. For 20 minutes, this is awesome. To cook the chicken, I used the Barefoot Contessa method of roasting chicken breasts - slather bone in breasts with skin on in olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast at 350 for 40 minutes. Let cool then de skin/bone and chop. Super moist! Did all that the night before, along with chopping the onion and garlic, so all that was left the day of was to pop a couple of cans and cook - so quick!  The hubby didn't love the black olives (he loves them normally) and I was ambivalent to it - not sure it added that much here.

I'll be honest, I haven't made this yet, but from my experience with posole it actually looks really good. But don't forget all of the great stuff to pile on top at the table, like lime juice, cabbage, and crispy corn tortilla strips. Will try this out next though...

This was just okay for me.  I have never had posole before so I have nothing to compare it to.  It was a little spicy for my taste.  I do not really like spicy food.  I will probably leave out the green chillies next time.  I also would have liked the broth a little thicker.

Yummy!  My husband's favorite soup - The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I add way more seasoning than the recipe calls for to get the taste right.

This tastes a lot like the canned posole I buy in the Mexican markets.  It was quick, easy and delicious.  My kids asked that I add "med" chilis next time instead of "mild."  This recipe is definitely a "keeper."
UPDATE:  Today I used a pork loin cut into pieces instead of the chicken (I still used chicken broth).  It was fabulous.  I also use two cans of chilis.

I added a little enchilada sauce as I had seen someone else do the same, otherwise I followed the recipe.  I wasn't sure it would be enough for a meal, but my husband and I loved it.  Oh, we did top it with some shredded cheese.  This was very good, I have made it twice so far.

EXCELLENT.  I DICE CABBAGE, RADISHES, ONIONS (OPTIONAL) AND CILANTRO (SORT OF OPTIONAL) RAW ON THE SIDE AND ADD AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE WHILE YOU EAT - ADD AS MUCH AS YOU WANT AND KEEP ADDING IF YOU LIKE. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE EATEN WITH TORTILLAS (CORN OR FLOUR) DIPPED IN THE SOUP AND SCOOPING UP THE RAW VEGGIES - BUT - AND THIS IS A SOUTHWEST SIN - YOU CAN ALSO SMASH UP AS MANY CORN TORTILLA CHIPS AS YOU WANT AND THROW 'EM IN, IT ADDS A CRUNCH AND MAKES THE HOMINY TASTE, UMM, CORNIER? YOU CAN ON EAT A POT OF THIS STUFF FOR DAYS AND IT JUST GETS BETTER. SO GOOD SHOW AND REMEMBER - COOK, EAT, REPEAT

Our favorite posole recipe- and so fast.  I add half tsp chili powder, zucchini squash, carrots.  It always disappears!
