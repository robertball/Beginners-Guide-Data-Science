Really great recipe to hang on to for that quick fix side you may be looking for. I agree with most reviews regarding the sugar. My recommendation: omit ALL sugar and salt (the corn is sweet & salty enough), use fresh broccoli instead (no need to steam before-hand) it cooks through perfectly in the pyrex with less of the "mushy-look" frozen may put out.

This is an excellent recipe. I made a few subtle changes. I used 1 TBSP sugar instead of 2, but I really think the sugar could be omitted entirely. I used the whole 10 oz. box of broccoli and added some half and half to compensate. I also added about 1/2 cup crushed saltines. This is a delicious side dish. Next time, I will use American or some other "soft" cheese in place of the cheddar. It didn't melt to my liking and I think it would have been better with a more gooey type cheese. I highly recommend this recipe, it's a nice change from plain scalloped corn. Very tasty and smells great when it's baking.

Nice recipe when you are looking for something different to do with vegetables ... especially in the winter months. I play quite a bit with the recipe substituting different cheeses etc. so you can get many variations out of 1 base recipe. I omit the sugar as it is sweet enough without. I add a pinch of salt and a good grinding of fresh pepper. I have also used Gruyere cheese instead for a bit more kick. I use fresh broccoli and I have also substituted frozen corn when I don't have canned creamed corn on hand. I add some milk to the combined ingredients to give it the custard consistency. I have also thrown in some cauliflower. This recipe is now in my repertoire. Thank you JM.

I've made it twice now.  First time I doubled the recipe and served it at a Boy Scout Pot-Luck.  It was so light and fresh and colorful that it was a big hit.  Also I add crushed saltines mixed with a little butter on top to form a crunchy crust.

This is a surprisingly delicious dish. I made it for a church event and I had so many people begging me for the recipe. The idea of the two together didn't appeal to "me" because I'm not a creamed-corn lover, but it was easy and it was for a function. Since everyone else raved, I decided to make one for my family and it was a hit here too, so Try it. I really think you'll like it. But I'd double the recipe if you're feeding more than a family of 5.

This was a wonderful veggie casserole that I made for Thanksgiving this year and it was very quick and easy and had a great blend of flavors.  I doubled the recipe as we served 17 people. Everyone raved about it, adults, kids and teenagers alike! Definitately a "must make again"!

I cut the sugar in half because I think creamed corn has it's own sweet taste.Used fresh broccoli.I added some chopped onion, white pepper, and extra cheese. I was afraid it would be bland.I cut the baking time by 15 minutes.It was very easy to make.

YUMMY!! I was a skeptic of cream corn and broccoli together, but they really are delicious. Next time I will cut the sugar in half. The recipe does not say to steam the broccoli so I put it in frozen. It turned out great so I guess that was the correct way. Thanks!!

This was good. I personally think it does not need the tablespoon of sugar --- salt and peppper would make it more savory.

Great recipe! It was a very interesting flavor. I read the reviews about the sugar so just didn't add any sugar, and it turned out sweet enough. I also used fresh broccoli, two heads worth. I didn't change anything else and it was delicious.

Based on other reviews, I left out the sugar, and only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt. It was very good. I also used a cup of shredded chedder cheese, becuase we love a lot of cheese with our broccoli. I did, however have to cook it for the full hour. At first I was only going to bake it for 45 minutes..but it looked too watery on top when I took it out, so I cooked it the remaining 15 minutes. My 3 yr old son had a bite, rubbed his belly and said.."That's good"..so its a winner.

I've been making this recipe for so many years now, but I use soda crackers in my and for the topping. I also use dried onion mixed in and no flour.

We usually have this at Thanksgiving and at Easter as side casserole dishes.

This a fantastic side dish that is easy to throw together. I made 2 changes though. I used fresh broccoli and baked for 45 minutes. Delicious!

So easy.  We halved the sugar and added a bit of black pepper and it was still very sweet.  My grandmother who hates brocolli liked this!

omitted sugar and salt.  Doubled recipe using one can creamed corn and one can (drained) kernel corn. Crushed up some Ritz crackers for crunch on top.  Very simple and very good.  Always a hit.

I LOVED this!  I followed the suggestions and omitted the sugar.  It was sweet enough so I'm glad I did.  I also added a bit of cheese to the top.  It was a big hit!  I will definately make again!

I made this dish for a family get together, and everyone enjoyed. It was very good.   However, if I make it again, I'll definitely double or even triple the recipe.  There was barely enough for a dinner w/ 6 people, and certainly no leftovers.

My husband doesn't like creamed corn but he liked this. I didn't have any broccoli on hand and it was good without it.  Make sure you grease the casserole dish.

Great base recipe!  I followed other's advice and omitted all sugar.  I added a can of chicken to make it more of a meal, added pepper, garlic and thyme.  Topped with breadcrumbs.  Tasty!  Next time I'll use even more spices, and maybe a little lemon juice to brighten it up.  Will make again, for sure.

This is delicious, and so simple and easy to make!  Other reviewers suggest reducing or omitting the sugar, and I agree.  I used about two teaspoons instead of two tablespoons, and it was bordering on too sweet.  I'll cut it down to one teaspoon next time.    I used pepperjack cheese, which gave it a nice little kick, and fresh broccoli, which cooked fine from raw without any pre-cooking.  I can also see many variations on this recipe - cauliflower or asparagus instead of broccoli, different cheeses, or to make it into more of a main dish, adding some browned sausage, crumbled bacon, ham, kielbasa, or cubed cooked chicken.    Two warnings:   The recipe says it makes six servings, but I would say, as a side dish, it makes only four modest servings at most.   And mine cooked through just fine in 40 minutes in a gratin dish; an hour would have left it pretty dried out, I think.    I'm not a fan of creamed corn on its own, but as an ingredient in various dishes, it's a handy thing to keep in the pantry.

This is a very good side dish, but I took other poster's advice and left out the sugar.  I really think that this does need some sugar, maybe not 2 tbs worth, but it definitely needs some.  When I make this again, I will start out with 1-2 tsp of sugar and go from there.  Also, I baked mine for the full hour and it was a little too well done, so next time I'll cut it back to 45 minutes and maybe it won't be too dry.  Otherwise, it's quick and simple to prepare and I really enjoyed it!

I am a beginner when it comes to cooking.  This recipe was so easy even I couldn't mess it up.  My family loved it.  I only used 1 tablespoon of sugar after reading other reviews and also used a blend of shredded cheeses that I had leftover from tacos.  Big hit in my house.  Will have again.  This would be a great dish to take to a potluck.

A yummy and easy side dish. I used a whole bag of frozen broccoli/cauliflower mix and cooked it in a 9x13 pan for about 45 min.

I have made this about 8 times now so thought I should review.  I follow the recipe substituting whatever vegetables I have on hand in lieu of broccoli (green beans work well).  I add a tsp of dry mustard and a dash of cayenne.  Great side dish for turkey dinners.  Note:  This comes out on the firm but creamy side.  It is not runny.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year.  Got rave reviews.  Doubled the recipe.  Didn't know whether or not to thaw broccoli-may try that next time as it had a little more liquid than I like.  Although, it did thicken up at standing.

While the thought of combining broccoli and corn was not appealing to me, I had all of the ingredients and wanted a quick side dish.  It was delicious and everyone really liked it.  Although I consider creamed corn pretty mushy, the corn added an amazing crunch and sweetness in contrast to the broccoli.  I used about 1 cup Cheddar, 1/2 (16 oz.) package broccoli florets (I didn't bother thawing or chopping), and tossed in some chopped frozen spinach for a little more green.  I could see trying a variety of veggies--cauliflower, peas, carrots, etc.  Will definitely use this recipe again, and will double it -- the leftovers were great too.  Another bonus--I threw this together in about five minutes literally--no chopping, just tossed it all and mixed (I did not premix eggs/flour).  I coated large casserole with Pam and baked covered.

I have made this dish twice now.  The first time was for a potluck at which there were over 40 dishes.  Many attending were searching out the person who brought this dish.  I left with a list of email addresses to send recipe to.  Made it again for a family function last night.  Again, the dish was emptied and recipe requested to be emailed.  Both times I doubled the recipe which worked very well.  No changes, delicious as is.  Lastly, not sure why some are having problems with this easy recipe in the baking area.  Could be the type of baking dish being used.

This was ok, I took out the sugar as others did and added chopped onion and topped with breadcrumbs.  Will probably make again, the cream of corn is a nice change from casseroles using cream soups.

This was very tasty and so simple.  I did add half a chopped red pepper to add some color.  A very good side dish to a christmas ham I made. A keeper the whole family enjoyed.

I use Strong Chedder, no salt and no sugar, the cheese is sprinkled on top rather than mixed in. With these changes it's one of my regulars now, so thank you for a really good idea.

This recipe was great - as a basis. I did not use sugar, after reading the above reviews. I used twice the cheese, added green onion, white onion, and bell pepper as well as some paprika, Tony Chachere's, and pepper. I also used twice the broccoli and added some regular canned corn. It turned out great! My husband loved it, especially with a dash of Tabasco. Next time I will use fresh broccoli (frozen broccoli is all stems - not my favorite part) and more spice. Great recipe and really easy to throw together and improvise!

YUM. My family and I loved this recipe. I have a hard time rating recipes, since I always use them as a starting point, I do not follow exactly. I left out the sugar - not needed! I added in kielbasa and 1/4th of an onion I needed to use, plus I used fresh brocoli. I give 4 stars since i know this recipe would work as is if you just leave out the sugar. Frozen or Fresh brocoli would work.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It tastes a lot like the "corn Pudding" recipe that calls for one box of jiffy corn muffin mix.  I have to eat Gluten Free now so I tried this recipe.  I substituted 1 3/4 tbs Bobs Red Mill Rice flour in place of the regular flour.  Everything turned out great.  The recipe set up well and tasted good.  Will definitely make again.

A real winner. Fixed 1st. time for company last night and all raved. One thing I'll change is make bigger batch. Also used sharp cheddar and wasn't to strong. Will be a favorite.

This was a big hit at the dinner table.  Quick and easy to throw together.  I was looking for something to use up some corn and broccoli.  The only change I made was using fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  It was a little sweet for my taste with the creamed corn (could have just been the brand of corn *shrugs*).

I made this for a BBQ (doubled the recipe) and it was gone in about 15 minutes, flat!  Big hit.  It is sweet, but nobody seemed to complain about that at all.  This doesn't really make very much so if you have a large family or like the recipe a lot then I'd say double it but for our family it is the perfect size.

I'm sorry, but we didn't care for this recipe at all. I followed this to the letter, and even after the hour of baking, it was very watery and loose. I don't think the sweet creamed corn went well with the broccoli, and the egg wasn't very appetizing in this dish either. Maybe it's just our tastes though. Thanks for sharing, but this just wasn't for us.

This was delicious. I think that it only needed 40 minutes as it burnt the bottom of the caserole dish.  Will have this quite often as written. Used fresh brocolli and no sugar.  Leftover will be added to the morning omlet. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  Left out the sugar.  Sauteed a shallot in butter and added along with a little (maybe 1/4 cup) fat free 1/2 & 1/2.  Turned out yummy.  Will make again.

Great, easy recipe. I did not add sugar- the cream corn is sweet enough. Fresh broccoli was used, no need for steaming ahead of time if you cut the vegetable up small. It was a hit with the vegetarians in the family.

Just the idea of using cream style corn with flour and eggs instead of white sauce is great. I left out the sugar and salt, added cooked macaroni and chopped sausages to make the plate bigger, and it was great. I used sharp cheddar inside and on top, we loved it! Wow, the corn, flour, and eggs... amazing! I am definitely stocking up on cream corn.

I made it with extra-sharp Cheddar for more flavor, didn't add sugar as I thought it was sweet enough, and I used steamed fresh broccoli instead of frozen. This tasted decent but it was very wet and sloppy. Not bad though.

I really like this recipe.  I am not a salt person so I ommited the salt and added cayenne pepper.  I think I may add some chopped onion to it next time as well.

We loved this recipe! I reduced the sugar to 1 tbsp. and added 1/2 cup each cooked ground turkey and chopped onion. The add-in possibilities are endless! This is a great recipe, and we'll definitely make it again.

This was a good recipe.  It's a nice change from just plain corn and broccoli.  When I made it I used a whole box of chopped broccoli and cooked it before mixing it in with the corn.  I also thoroughly drained it.  For the cheese I used a combination of cheddar and monterey jack.  A nice side dish to take to a potluck dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used 1/2 box of broccoli plus the same amount of cauliflower and the results were great.  My family liked the extra veggies.

This was super easy to make.  I omitted the salt and sugar, used freshly steamed broccolli, and medium cheddar cheese.  Very good.  A KEEPER RECIPE FOR US.

Less Broccoli, Omit the salt and double the cheese.  Even add a little crumbled bacon and this dish would be much better.

based on the other reviews i was skeptical, however this was terrific. per other reviews, i used a scant tbls of splenda and added a couple of handfuls of frozen corn kernels. also i used the full box of brocoli (i thawed it first). i baked it for almost an hour and it was perfect.  my picky husband even had seconds!

OUTSTANDING!!! I used fresh broccoli which I steamed in the microwave. I also used granular Splenda instead of sugar and egg substitute instead of egg. I will be fixing this again and again.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used fresh broccoli and cut out the sugar all together.  The dish was sweet enough without it.  I had mine in the oven with something else and did not bake it long enough, the middle was soggy.  I will try it again though and make sure I cook it all the way!

Excellent.  Very filling and rich casserole.  Would be great at Thanksgiving.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and only had frozen brocolli spears which I whirled for a few seconds in the food processor.  Yummy.

was way to sweet, will try 1/2 tablespoon next time. Will also spinkle extra cheese on top next time. Fience hates anything with cream corn, she liked this.
she even commented that it is the first recipe with cream corn she liked.
Will try again.

This is good, but I'll leave out the sugar next time I make it. I made individual servings in small ramikins and sprinkled a little extra cheese on the top. The dish puffs up slightly, so it made for a nice presentation.

Once again, my 10 yr. old was positive he hated cooked broccoli when I told him what we were having for dinner - but he was WRONG!  He liked this recipe alot!  I did substitute garlic salt for regular salt and it was yummy!

Yummy! It doesn't make a very large casserole though. One suggestion, it is too sweet. Next time I make it, I will try using only 1 tablespoon of sugar. I used fresh broccoli. It's a keeper.

I was not a fan of this at all, it looked mushy in the oven so it didn't look very done so I didn't take it out until an hour and 15 minutes. It was very salty and very mushy.

This was very good but a little sweet for me..next time I will probably only use 1 tb of sugar. Also I used 2 fresh broccoli crowns which I blanched and chopped rather than frozen broccoli-this is a great way to keep it from going to waste!

Made this to the "T", minus the sugar and salt, like most reviewers suggested.  it was tasteLESS.  Very disappointed.  You'd have a mare enjoyable and tasty side dish just steaming the broccoli.  I'd either add sugar and salt AND pepper, or just steam your broccoli and be wowed instead.  

Disappointing- I love broccoli, and am always looking for new twists.

This dish was okay. Tasty, but not memorable in my opinion. I doubled the recipe, but only used 2 eggs and omitted the sugar entirely and I'm glad I did. My husband loved it, but he thinks Zoodles are gourmet ;)

This was wonderful. I made it as written except that I used egg beaters instead of real eggs. I liked it so much that I barely ate the other things I made to go with it at dinner!  It turned out softer than I thought it would even after I cooked it longer, but it tasted great! A great recipe to keep and share.

Very easy and tasty.  Instead of frozen broccoli I used fresh (that's all I had) and it turned out great.  I should have let it set for a few minutes before serving.  I noticed it was runnier when I served it right away but after I let it sit for a little bit it was "gelled" I also covered it with foil while baking, I didnt want it burn or get crispy.  I took the foil off 15min before the end time and it got just enough browning at the end.  I will make this for sure again.

I took this to my family's Memorial Day celebration. Baked it in a 9x13 and I would say that it was almost completely gone. I thought it was pretty tasty.

Very good, and an easy to make veggie side casserole. I left out the sugar (healthier and just not necessary to add). I once forgot to add the cheese and it still turned out good - plus less fat! perfect recipe, so easy.

A really nice recipe, and very easy. I look forward to trying some variations such different cheeses, and making this more of a gratin by topping it with grated cheese and/or breadcrumbs. A dash of nutmeg might work well with this dish too.

Really good and super easy.  A great way to get some veggies into my "anti-veggie" 2 year old.  I did reduce the sugar amount to 1 tablespoon and I added 1 teaspoon of salt.

I really liked the flavor of this recipe but the texture was rather mushy.  Adding something to give it some density might be good.  I put some of my leftovers on brown rice and enjoyed that much more than eaten alone.

I made this with the addition of diced chicken breasts.  It made a great casserole and still cooked in a reasonable amount of time.  Will fix again. I will cut back on the amount of salt next time.  Little to salty for me.

Very tasty.  Family loved it.  Used the entire package of frozen chopped brocolli - just cooked it a little longer.  Got this in the oven a bit late so increased temp to 400 and kept an eye on it to make certain it did not burn.  It took between 30 and 40 minutes.

I am not a cook, but this was an extremely easy to follow recipe and delicious. The only thing I would change will be the salt because the cheese was salty enough for the plate, and we loved the sweetness of the corn mixed witht he broccoli. Thanks a lot!

The recipe is great! Even my kids liked it. I used broccoli florettes because I like them better. The only thing that I will do next time is omit the sugar or at least cut it down by half- I thought it was too sweet for a vegetable dish.

I took other reviewers suggestions and reduced the sugar by half.  Next time I would not add it at all, it was too sweet.  I used fresh broccoli, but found I needed to reduce the cooking time.  I would also add more cheese (I used medium).  Over all very tasty.  I will make this again.

I can't believe how good and easy this is.  Personally, I don't find it too sweet, I like the sweetness of corn which a little sugar enhances.  The contrast with the broccoli and cheese is good.  But if you don't care for that, then it makes sense to leave out the sugar.  Anyway, it's good.

this was good,  but just okay.  I ommited the sugar completely like some had suggested and used fresh brocc that I had blanched and shocked prior to cooking.  I wish I had added some sugar, maybe half of what the recipe calls for. It felt like it should have been slightly sweet, like a corn pudding, but was not because I had left out the sugar.  not sure if I will try this again.

What a great side dish this was! Everyone in the family really enjoyed it. I cut the sugar in half and only used one egg, like others suggested. Perfect! Still kinda sweet but not too much.

I used two bundles of fresh flowerets instead of frozen broccoli.  This is a sweet dish to use during a meal instead of at dessert.  I baked it for Thanksgiving but it could be used fall and winter any time.

It was toooo sweet.  I would definately cutdown the sugar.  The sugar combined with the sweet corn was too much.

This kind of tasted like a corn omelet on top of broccoli to me.  I used fresh broccoli and halved the sugar and salt.  I may try this again, but with only one egg and no flour so it blends together better.

I thought this would be a good side for Thanksgiving, but I was a little disappointed.   Half the people liked it, half didn't care for it.  I also cut way back on the sugar.

Very easy to make. However, it was too sweet of a recipe. As a few other reviewers stated, we all agree the sugar could've been drastically reduced. In fact, a can of sweet creamed corn is already sweetened enough for this mixture so I'm trying again with no sugar added.

I made a double recipe but used only a 16 oz. bag of cut broccoli (not chopped, and yes, I discovered there is a difference. ??).  Also, I sprayed the glass casserole dish with “Pam” before adding mixture and only used 2 tablespoons of sugar for the double batch.   Everyone that liked corn and broccoli enjoyed it.   It’s a keeper,

I used fresh broccoli and steamed it a few minutes before chopping.  A bit too sweet so would skip the added sugar next time. Good potluck dish or a picnic as it could be served at room temp or cold.

What a lovely, flavorful casserole!  I omitted the sugar and added some ground black pepper.  It really impressed a crowd of 15 at Christmas.  I got several compliments from the adults and the kids really dug in!  Will definitely make again.

Made it for Easter dinner and everyone enjoyed it - it was the one dish that I still heard comments a week after dinner how good it was.  I doubled the recipe and used whole kernel corn instead of cream style for the additional can.  The cooking time was about 90 minutes for a double batch.

My family really liked this. Made it just as it said. It is quite simple. yes it is sweet, probably why we liked it so much. Broccoli makes it seem healthier. Mine was not watery at all and not eggy either. This is a recipe I'll take to a potluck and am sure folks will ask for the recipe.

Too eggy.  Added dried onion flakes to try to up the flavor, and then it just tasted eggy and oniony. I did omit the sugar, but don't believe it would have improved the dish.

creamed corn is already sweet.  Adding the 2 tbs of sugar just made this whole dish too unnecessarily sweet.  The egg/cream corn/four combo was too weird. Would not make again.

I made this and it turned out really well!  It was quick and easy to make.  Like many of the other commenters I will leave out the sugar completely next time.  It was too sweet and left a bit of an aftertaste.  Other than that I loved it.  My wife and I both thought it reminded us of the sweet corn tomalito from Chevy's.  Mmm...

Great side dish.  I followed the other reviews and left out the sugar, put just a pinch of salt in, and some extra cheese.  I thought it tasted great...will make again soon.

This is a great easy receipe for everyday or a holiday.  I ommitted the salt and sugar and only used 1 Tablespoon of flour and it turned out great.  I need to double this recipe next time because everyone wanted more.  (I fed a family of four).

Hmmm, love broccoli and creamed corn but this didn't work for me together.  Made as written cept for a little more cheese and only 1T of sugar, to my taste.  I thought it was way too salty and sweet, which just made it taste weird.  Also kinda mushy/pasty.  Its OK tasting but I'll probably not make it again.  Sorry!

My husband & kids love broccoli, so I thought this sounded like a nice dish to try.  I omitted the sugar, like others sugg'd, but kept everything else the same.  It was just alright, not bad but far from great.  It was missing something & I think it WAS the sugar (something sweeter)  Definately willing to try again but exactly as written in the original recipe.

We enjoyed it. Friend who didn't like broccoli said with the corn in their it was good. Was maybe a little sweet, I also added just a few crushed butter crackers due to reviews mentioning liquid.

I cooked this as a side dish for Christmas this year. I was kind of worried about how it would taste, having cheese and cream corn together. It was a hit. Everyone really liked it and unlike the turkey and dressing, there were no leftovers. My brother is a cheese lover and thought I could have added more cheese, might try that next time. I followed the recipe just like it says here and it was great, I will definately cook it again. (I am not a fan of cream corn, but in this dish it was very good, didn't have the slimy texture like it does alone)

This was too bland! It needed a lot of help! My children did not like the combination of the sweetness of the corn and the cheese.  I think it could have used some onions  to give it flavor.  I will not try this recipe again.

The only reason I am giving this recipe 4 (and a half stars, if I could) stars instead of 5 is that, at least the way mine turned out, it was a little salty, and I had to reduce the sugar... as others had suggested.  Otherwise, it was great.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and sharp cheddar instead of mild, as that is what I had on hand.

Next time, I will use 1/2 tsp salt and see how things go, and still only use 1 tbsp of sugar.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

Thanks for a quick, easy and yummy recipe!

this turned out very nice! I used a bag of frozen broccoli with cheese sauce since that is what I had on hand, and doubled the amounts on all the other ingredients.  I pre-microwaved the broccoli and cheese sauce so that the "cheese chips" would be a little melted and blend better.  My family really liked the slightly sweet taste - and it was a welcome change from our usual side dishes.  (I baked this in a covered dutch oven.)

I followed the recipe exactly.  I took this to a family party and it got mixed reviews; no one that I asked disliked it.  The corn was such a strong taste that the others were over-powered and you really need to like creamed corn with this recipe.  I guess I thought the flavors would blend together more.

Everyone liked it, that makes it worth the five stars. I did cut down the sugar, and it was still nice and sweet. A good reminder that not all ovens cook at same time, I will probably take 10 -15 minutes off. The crust that formed wasn't that tasty.

Last night was my night to cook at the firehouse and I made this for a side dish.  It was very good and everyone enjoyed it.  It was a tad sweet, so I think next time I'll cut down on the sugar.  Other than that...delicious.

I doubled the shredded cheese.  I would use a little less sugar next time since the creamed corn already has a sweet taste. My family enjoyed this different side dish and is already asking when I will make it again.

Easy to make but my husband and I found it a bit too sweet for our taste. However I will keep it in my box as it would be good for someone who doesn't like veggies or children who are picky. There is not a strong veg taste at all.

Our family is proof that everyone has a different taste for the same thing.  My husband and I thought ehhh okay, our 8 year old son had the same reaction. Our 6 year old son hated it (not a surprise there) and our 3 year son LOVED it and ate his whole serving!  My review: This recipe was okay.  We ate it, but probably won't make it again.  However, I did use fresh (frozen by accident in the fridge) broccoli and omited the sugar per the other reviewers.  I think it needs some sugar.  That probably would have made this a little better.

This recipe has an interesting combination of flavors.  As suggested by previous reviews, I omitted the sugar.  I am putting it in my "favorite" list.

I thought this was a nice change with broccoli. As suggested in the reviews I cut down on the sugar next time I won't use sugar at all as it is naturally sweet.

I made this for my parents and boyfriend, the first bite, my dad went "this is wonderful!" and it was a winner with all.  I used less sugar than required, only used about 1 tablespoon.  Was skeptic about cheese and corn together, but the flavor was great.

This recipe is delish AS IS.  The ONLY thing I did was substitute the white flour with wheat, cause that's what I had on hand.  Definitely a keeper, will be making this one again SOON!

Unfortunately this recipe was not suited for my taste.  I think it was the combination of creamed corn with broccoli that was the problem for me.  I'm sure some will find it very appealing, but it did nothing for me.

Tasted very good, but next time I'll cut down on the salt.  It was a little too salty.  I doubled the recipe, but had to increase the cooking time by about 25 min.
