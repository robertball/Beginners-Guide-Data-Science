Simple and good. I did melt the butter first and whisk in the flour and then added everything else. The gravy is very light in color until you add the browning sauce and then it looks more like a beef gravy. I obviously expected it to get darker but not as dark as it did with only 1/2 teaspoon. Just thought I'd mention that  in case you are going for a specific color.
