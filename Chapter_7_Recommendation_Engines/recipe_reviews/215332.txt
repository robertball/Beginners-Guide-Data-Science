These were incredibly easy, and very creamy and good.  The only change that I will make next time is to add a bit more coconut extract to add just a little more coconut flavor.  But overall, very good!

Yum!  I used vanilla instead of coconut extract.  I also added toasted coconut, crushed toasted almonds and mini chocolate chips.  Tasted like a dark chocolate almond joy!

These were good.  They are not very sweet.  You can taste the canned milk flavor and I do think maybe it needed more coconut flavor.  Im going to try to make these with pineapple juice for pina colada flavor.  I dont suggest to put in cinnamon.  You cant really taste it and it settles to the bottom of your pops.  We enjoyed these.

I made these last night for the first time and my son and I loved them.  I added some grated coconut, because I liked the extra taste and texture.

I wanted so much to like these but they are just so so to me. I added extra coconut flavoring but they have that canned milk taste.

I added toasted sweet coconut flakes and WOW...it was delicious.  Also, added toasted chopped pecans and instead of coconut extract, I added pure vanilla.

Made these today with a couple modifications. Used condensed sweetened milk instead of the evaporated. Cut out the sugar. Added coconut extract and some sweetened coconut and a couple cups of water. Absolutely amazing!

I doubled the coconut extract, added shredded coconut, and still found them bland. Next time I will try to toast the coconut or add a little lemon juice to bring out the natural flavors.

I made these but with a few changes. I added more coconut extract about 4tspn, 3 tspn sugar, heavy cream instead of evaporated milk, and 2 diced/mashed kiwi. They came out a little sweeter and the kiwi added a little something special. next time trying shredded pineapple and a pina colada mix.

It was absolutely delicious but, I couldn't eat to much at once because it was too sweet.
I would not add as much confectioners sugar and and not as much cinnamon.
