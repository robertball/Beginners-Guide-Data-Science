I just made this recipe for a gift for a friend.  It turned out wonderfully.  I used a roasting pan on the stove top to steam it.

My mother made a very similar recipe that came from my great aunt Ethel who was born in 1878. There was hardly any instructions on the recipe card and it is steamed in the oven, but no oven temp was mentioned. I use one stock pot surrounded by about 4 C. water, then put pudding into a smaller stock pot, one inside the other, steam at 250 degrees for about 3 hours. It is the most heavenly stuff! You wouldn't think it's rich, but it is. About 3/4 C. per serving is usually enough, and I make extra hard sauce to spoon over it, but without the lemon. Thanks for submitting your version- it will help me to tweak mine. It does make the house smell divine!

FIVE STARS***** You will NOT be disappointed.  This is almost exactly like my late grandmother's recipe, a family favorite for generations now.  The only difference is she used brown instead of white sugar and also included 1 cup of grated potatoes, in addition to the carrots.  Also, she went a little lighter on the nutmeg and heavier on the cinnamon.    She topped it with a hard sauce, with rum.  That was made by boiling water and adding it slowly to dry ingredients with whisk. Pour it back into a pan and boil for 3 minutes to thicken.  Remove from heat and add butter and 1 T of rum (or other).  Specific sauce ingredients: 1/3 c. sugar, 3 tbsp flour, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 cups boiling water, 2 tbsp. butter, 1 tbsp rum, brandy, or sherry).  Yield 2 cups.  YUM!  A must serve wintertime treat.  I'd be interested to know how you packaged your puddings for gifts -- I'd like to do that this year since I just bought some very cool antique steamed pudding molds on eBay.

Very good. Can be made with half the sugar. The lemon sauce needs more corn starch, a tablespoon at least. Look at another lemon sauce recipe.

I make this every year & I add about a cup of mixed peel (sometimes called citron), currants & a cup of grated apple. I also use butter & brown sugar & do not add the nuts as my kids did not like them. I add either a 1/3 c of brandy or else a tblsp of brandy/rum flavoring. I steam it for about 3 hrs in jars in my canner. You have to be sure to only fill them 2/3 full as it swells a LOT. It is my fav Xmas gift to give away. I print up the recipe for my vanilla/rum sauce & put it on the jar & add a ribbon. You can pop the whole jar in the microwave to heat it up to serve.

This is the recipe my mother made for Christmas every year.  It wouldn't be Christmas without carrot pudding and the delicious lemon sauce over the top.  Yum!

This is very similiar to my great grandparent's recipe.  Except they used suet, make sure you order the extra white kidney fat type, instead of shortening. We still make it that way to this day.  We also serve it with a butter/rum sauce.

I am the submitter of this recipe.  In response to miniata, I always make mine in 1# coffee cans then just place the plastic lids on and place a bow on top however I like someone else's suggestion to bake them in canning jars.  Enjoy!

This is just like my mom's "Christmas Pudding" and is yummy.  The only thing I did differently was use a Rum Sauce instead of lemon.

I was very sceptical about this receipe as the mixture looked so dry before steaming.  However, it came out great.  I used brown sugar instead of white.

I love how the pudding came out- so good and moist.  I chose to lessen the spices- cloves and nutmeg- because I don't like their flavor, and it turned out perfect.  I omitted one star because the lemon topping didn't  thicken at all.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe the recipe called for too little starch.

I added about 3/4 c chopped apple but other than that followed the recipe as written.   Makes two good-size,  wonderfully moist and delicious puddings.

I needed to make a Christmas pudding for my British family and this was perfect. I put in some mixed peel and probably a few more raisins than called for. I steamed it in an antique bunny shaped mold from my great grandmother (bunny shape seemed appropriate because of the carrots) in 2 inches of water on the stove top. Very quick and easy to mix up. Will add to my family's Christmas recipes.

This did not turn out to be very moist for me at first. I used mason jars covered them with parchment on an inverted pie tin with slots inside of a stock pot.   Very dry. So i dug the pudding out of the jars, chopped it up well, added some eggs beaten with baking powder, and re-steamed it in a pyrex bowl in the oven. This time, it was a bit soggy. But after a week in the fridge, it was amazingly good!!! Moisture had dispersed evenly and absorbed in! Rum sauce and vanilla ice cream over that. Very tasty, but.... We were eating it 'as is' for breakfast and tea.
My grandmothers recipe was the same but said to use 2 tsp baking powder in the flour out of the gate...and then to moisten the batter with 'a bit of milk'. I will be trusting this next year!

This was good, but for me, waaaaay too sweet. I didn't think it would be, but I think the sauce is what did it. However, this was very easy to make and is a lovely addition to Thanksgiving--definitely a dessert dish, though. Thanks for the recipe!
