I liked this recipe.  Subtle flavors were interesting.  However, I may poach the fish in a pan with the ingredients next time, rather than stea  I think more of these unique flavors will be in each bite....

My husband loved this recipe!  He has never liked salmon until he tried this one.  I did not steam the salmon, but baked it instead.

This recipe works best if it's put into pan without holes and allowed to poach in the juices. The fish absorbs all of the wonderful flavors and you can ladle the sauce over white rice. YUMMY!

This was great. My husband and I both thought it tasted really good, was very simple and fast to make. 
We don't have a steamer (well, we do but it's packed up right now) so we put the salmon in a glass pie plate and put that on top of an inverted stainless steel bowl in a large shallow stock pot. Worked great.

I used white salmon and tripled the amount of ginger.  Turned out great.  I would recommend Imagine Foods' Organic Free Range Chicken Broth for lots of flavor.

Great recipe. Tastes very similar to my boyfriend's mother's salmon recipe & it also has the same ingredients! The only thing I recommend is reducing the amount of chicken broth and adding a little more red pepper flakes, otherwise everything is yummy. Also, instead of steaming mine, I broiled it -- makes the flavors combine in the fish better.

So delicious I found myself snacking on it in the wee hours of the morning. Wonderful cold too!  This is wonderful served with ramen or soba noodles also might be good with some other vegetables steamed along with salmon. MMMMMMM!

This is a recipe to try!!
I did not have the bean paste.
I added rice wine vinegar, oyster sauce, and the remaining ingrediants.  I also chose to bake for 15 minutes instead of steaming.
Very yummy.

I LOVE black bean and garlic sauce, and never thought to use it with salmon. I think I prefer it with my usual chicken/onion/green bell pepper combo, but it was still good. The only things I did differently were to use powdered ginger instead of fresh, and I cooked it all in a skillet on the stove top. I also sprinkled some sliced green onions on top which made it look pretty. If I were to make it again, I'd sprinkle on some toasted sesame seeds as well. Nice recipe. Thanks!

Was good, however i wish that tasty sauce didn't steam away. I liked it enough to try it again and like the other member poach it in the sauce. Don't steam it too long either, it was a little dry. My family did enjoy it though. Very healthy too!!!

We loved this!  I used a little more ginger and steamed it in my Handy Steamer that I had only used for veggies until this point, and it was very nice.

It was kind of bland, even with all the strong tasting ingredient, and it didn't taste particularly Chinese.  I think the amount of chicken broth should be reduced.  It dilutes the taste, plus you accumulate quite an amount of water when steaming already.  Maybe I will give it a try another day, with a much concentrated sauce on top.

I thought this was good but a little bland.  I tried the Firecracker Grilled Alaska Salmon & liked that one better.
