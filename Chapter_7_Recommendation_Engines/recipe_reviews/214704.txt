This came out great! Super easy too. This recipe satisfied my pho craving even though it's not your traditional beef noodle soup. I added soba noodles and upped the chicken broth because I like noodly/brothy soups. The lime is key (pardon the pun) - in addition to what the recipe called for, I served wedges with the soup so everyone could add more if they wanted. I did not include the chili-garlic sauce or the jalapeno to the pot since it would be too spicy for my 3 year old but adding it to my bowl separately after serving was still yummy! Will for sure make again!

Super good broth, we didnt have chili/garlic sauce but let everyone personalize at the end with the typical rooster chili sauce. Served over Soba noodles and it was a great hit.

This was a wonderful soup! I used two heads of bok choy since they were small.

Easy and enjoyable. It was a little hot for us. I will experiment with reducing the siracha.

We had to leave the jalapenos and Sriracha out of the recipe and add in our own bowls due to having young kids, but it was still very good.  I made it with venison instead of beef, turned out great!

I needed to add more broth and water to make this stretch for my family of 4. It seemed like there was a lot of onion, and I knew there would be much complaining...so I scooped out the cooked onion and mushed it in the food processor. I let everyone add his/her own Sriracha. I had some anise pods in the cupboard and threw those in (I wanted that pho taste). That really helped. Thanks for the recipe, Becca.

Great recipe! I also added on the side fresh sourdough bread. I served mine on top of rice, which made the spiciness more mild. I'll try those noodles next time!

This had a lovely taste and I will definately make it again. 

1/2 tsp of pepper was plenty for taste - it even smelt peppery - rather than 1 tsp.  I also reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp to suit my tastes.  Finally, I did not add the chile-garlic sauce because my husband doesn't like spicy food, but the flavour was still great.

Awesome! This broth is fantastic. I skipped the jalapeno peppers and only used half the rooster sauce. Served over a bowl of steaming rice.

We love this soup. The only thing I ever do different is to add rice noodles, just 'cause we love them.

Very peppery!!  (And I only used about 1/2 the amount black pepper called for and none of the chili-garlic sauce.)  Other than that it was good over rice, a positive first experience cooking with Bok Choy.

This was a really tasty base!  As the submitter states, it is nice to add a bit to it, extra chili paste some lime, etc.  Nice with noodles also.  I did need to cook mine a bit longer than stated to get my bok choy soft, so you may want to plan for that when making or chop your bok choy stems pretty thin (I used the leaves and the stems, the recipe may have intended only the leaves at that cooking time).

I added one tomato diced thin but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My boyfriend ate so much he made himself practically ill.  This recipe was easy and so tasty.  It really had a nice, tangy, perfectly spicy taste.  LOVED IT!!

Very tasty! I did not use the chili-garlic sauce but did add the jalapeno pepper. Way to hot for my taste. Next time I will use a much milder pepper and maybe cut it in half. Other than that it was a hit. Oh, and I used left over tri-tip instead of the beef sirloin tips, super good.

I would make this again but I would first sear the stew meat to get a nice brown color then do the onions ect. We used 2 bullion cubes in warm water in stead of broth and we found that we didn't need to add any salt. We also didn't have jalapeno peppers so we used some red pepper flakes and that gave it a nice heat. I added some celery we had and that was real good. We stewed the bok choy a little longer to get it nice and tender.

YUM!  A great, healthy way to use Bok Choy in a soup.  Used all chicken broth (no water) added extra bok choy and only used 1 tablespoon of hot sauce.  The lime is a must!  I also added about 1 tablespoon of tomato paste (for color) and soba noodles.  Delish!!

I’ve been making my variation of this for yeeaarrss! I’ve never used the beef strips, instead I’ve used either ground turkey or beef. I always throw in a couple extra cups of broth for some added flavor. My wife simply loves this, especially during those cold winter nights.

I almost always follow the basic recipe to determine whether or not it makes sense.  I love this recipe, have made it "as is", and have made it with my own modifications (adding ginger, a little soy sauce, for example).  but that is just for my taste, so my rating is great for the basic recipe.
The only issue with this recipe is the lack of specificity for the quantity of bok choy, the basic ingredient, and whether baby bok choy or regular bok choy should form the fundamental ingredient.

Not bad, but not special either.  The broth tasted like beef and lime and was warm going down.  The bok choy was good and crunchy.
