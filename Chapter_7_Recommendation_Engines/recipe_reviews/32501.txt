Tonight I am making these for the third time for a party! These are great! My favorite at home recipe. I am somewhat of a margarita connoisseur (my favorite drink). I was wary because of the expense of Grand Marnier, but it was well worth the price and you don't use very much! By the end of the night, you will be standing on the counter dancing to Pee Wee Hermans version of "Tequila."

I made these on a friday night after my husband and I both had a long hard week at our jobs. What a great way to unwind! I made a batch of these and a mexican meal and it was just as good as being at one of our favorite mexican restaurant/bar! The only change I will make is to reduce the tequila just a tad because the recipe as written is really strong! Thanks for the excellant recipe Carol.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe all summer. Thank you! Here's a similar version for two that honors the original recipe, uses fresh ingredients, and uses a cocktail shaker instead of a blender: Combine into saucepan and bring to boil while stirring or swirling: 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup sugar. Set aside to cool. Juice and strain 3 to 5 lemons and 3 to 5 limes until you have 1 1/2 cups juice. Pour 1 1/2 cups strained juice and 3/4 cup sugar syrup into 18 oz or larger container; stir. This sweet and sour mix will keep in refrigerator for at least a week; stir before each use. Pre-chill 8 oz tumbler glasses in freezer. Rim glasses - (outside rim only) - with fresh lime and coarse kosher salt, if desired. Add 3 pieces of ice to each glass. Fill cocktail shaker with 4 oz sweet and sour (and, this is important, 2 oz of water if using the lesser amount of alcohol); 2 - 3 oz 1800 Reposado or Anejo Tequila; 1/2 - 3/4 oz Grand Marnier; and 1 1/2 - 2 oz Bols Triple Sec Liqueur. Add 4 ice cubes; cover and shake briskly for 10 slow seconds. Strain into pre-chilled glasses with ice; add squeeze of lime to each drink. We love the stronger version, particularly after a hard day, but prefer the lighter version most days. I listed my brand preferences, but any quality products will do. Enjoy!

I'm a native Texan and these are the very best margaritas!  Served them last night and had to make 2 extra batches - everyone LOVED them.  I used the weaker version suggested by another user:  2 cups sweet and sour 3/4 cup triple sec 1 cup tequila 1/4 cup Grand Marnier but I also added the juice of 1 lime Served each with salt rim and lime wedge.  This made 6 servings (not 8).

WOAH. Exceptional!  I've made it my mission this summer to make the *perfect* margarita - this is it folks.  For those of you who do not like margs sweet, use limeade in place of the sweet and sour mix.  I used a top shelf tequila and a cheap tequila, and the top shelf made a HUGE difference.  If blood oranges are in season, I squeeze one of those in place of the limes into the batch and it takes this to the level of nirvana!  (Sometimes I just go with a navel orange if they are not in season!) Take my advice and make yourself a 2 drink limit and then wait 30 minutes before considering another.  My big bad husband had 2, said he didn't feel a thing, went for the 3rd, and was still in bed at noon the next day!!

If you like strong drinks, this is the recipe for you!  Do yourself a favor and stop at 2, wait for a little bit and let the alcohol kick in before deciding on a 3rd.  This way you'll avoid face first encounters with the floor and your head and tummy will thank you the next day!

I tried this recipe for a "Fiesta" Christmas party. I scaled the recipe for 48 people and served it in a big punch bowl.

Best Margaritas I've ever made!  I make my own sweet and sour mix, as defined by one of the previous reviewers, as follows: 2/3c simple syrup (~ .5c water and .5c sugar, heated), 2/3c lime juice and 2/3c lemon juice. There are so many varieties of limes and lemons, don't be afraid to try them all. When the blood oranges ripen on my tree I'll definitely give those a try, too.

I don't drink much so after two of these (on an empty stomach)I was seeing double, and that was after I decreased the amount of tequila a bit. Margaritas on the rocks are by far my favorite alcoholic beverage, and these were some of the best homemade I've ever had! Don't bother with the premixed stuff, this is better. You should only blend the ingredients for a second or two, otherwise the mix gets verrryy frothy. I found out the hard way! I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing!

I'd been searching for a really good margarita recipe for some time, and this one is hands down the best I've ever made!  Rather than using Grand Marnier (which, at $43 a bottle at my liquor store, is too $$$ for my blood), I substituted Gran Gala, an Italian import was half the price.  The important thing is finding an orange liqueur made with brandy, and this one fit the bill perfectly.  Cointreau would work as well, but costs almost as much as Grand Marnier.  The end result?  Smooth and delicious.  I'll be making these often!  One other tip: do not skip salting the rim of the glasses.  This is an essential step in a good margarita - the salt perfectly contrasts with the sweet-and-sour flavor of the beverage.

This recipe is very tasty but it's not for the casual margarita drinker. In most bars this drink would come with a two drink maximum disclaimer.

This was my first try at making margaritas; my husband is the pro.  I made them frozen, rather than on the rocks, and this passed his taste test, although they hit hard; stronger than what we are used to!  Thank you, Carol.

Make this one before you do the other recipe on this site that has more stars!!! The Grand Marnier (or Gran Gala...less expensive but just as good) is what makes this better than other recipes.  Instead of sweet n sour I used a can of frozen limeade.  Threw it all in the blender, topped with ice and blended (DO NOT add more ice to make it thicker it will only water it down).  Simply drink it as is the first time, then freeze the rest in a ziplock bag for easy frozen margaritas the second time around. YUMMY!!!

My husband couldnt believe I made such a tasty & refreshing 'rita! I have been trying out my own recipes and some I have found online and I will look no further!! I used Cuervo Silver Tequila & Cuervo Mix as well. The Silver definately makes it smooth. Warning...these really pack a punch!

I made this for a mexican themed dinner party and everyone raved about it. Even people who normally don't drink margaritas were getting 2nd and 3rd helpings. I like that they are not frozen because I was able to blend up a big batch, put in a pitcher, and then put it in the fridge. Whenever people needed refills, I just put some ice in their glass and poured (rather than having to rev up the blender and make a bunch of noise). I also did about 1 cup of tequila instead of 1.5 because many people don't like a strong tequila taste. This is a more expensive recipe than your standard store bought margarita mix but your guests will notice the difference. Cheers!

WOW!!  This is the best margarita recipe I've every tried.  In fact, this is the best margarita I've EVER had period.  I've taken made this for several friends at different gatherings and they all love it.  Two margarita's will give you a major buzz so be careful...they creep up on you!

I'm FAR from a bartender...I've never really mixed any drinks before so I was scared about how this would turn out.  WOW!!  These were wonderful!  Now everytime my boyfriend & I want drinks, he always wants these!  His friend even tried it & was like "Wow!  These aren't 'just' margaritas...these are top shelf margaritas!"  Watch out...they DO sneak up on you!

Oh yum!  I love the frozen version of a margarita, but this was even better!  I cut the recipe in half and boy is this strong.  Be careful, because these do go down easy and are perfect for when you've had "one of those days"...

Took a doubled recipe to a party and it was a hit.  I loved it but my mom found it too sweet for her taste.  Will definitely be making these again.

These were pretty good. Definitely better than store bough mix but not quite perfect. I like a stiff drink but the alcohol taste was a little too much for my guests and for me as well. Will probably still look around for a best recipe.

WOW!!!! I made these for my hubby's belated 47th birthday celebration and I was so happy when I saw his face light up after one taste. After a couple of sips he said this was the BEST margarita he's ever had, I'll say that he's become a margarita expert with over 25 years experience tasting, so I was really delighted when he declared these the very best ever in his life! I really think the orange flavor of the Grand Marnier is what put these over the top! Wonderful citrusy flavor, even I liked the taste (although way too strong for me, but anything beyond "virgin" is too strong for me.) I used Jose Cuervo Especial Gold tequila because that is his favorite. Ummm... the only drawback is these were a quite pricey. The Grand Marnier alone was $38! Hubby was totally delighted though with his birthday margaritas though, so I'd say this was worth it. This is def a keeper and I need look no further as this is the ultimate margarita!!! Update: Hubby has gone on and on about how wonderful these were for the past 2 days, he even had to tell his buddies at work about them.

VERY smooth!  I don't like using drink mixers, so I substituted the sweet and sour mix for a scant one part simple syrup, one part lime juice and one part lemon juice.  A little different twist on the rimming - try one part sea salt (or kosher salt) mixed with one half part superfine sugar.  This is a keeper recipe!

Grand Marnier makes margaritas DELISH! FYI these are blended or frozen margaritas. "On the rocks" would imply serving them over ice w/o putting them in the blender. If you serve them on the rocks they're best put in a shaker and then floating the Grand Marnier on the top. YUM!

Great recipe, Carol. I used 2 cups of Tequila, and I did not share a drop with anyone else at the party. I paid for that dearly the next day, but it was  worth it! Thanks.

Absolutely the best I've tried at home so far!  Very near my favorite restaurant margaritas.  I halved the alcohol after reading the reviews and doing my own calculations.  I made my own sweet and sour, following instructions from an AR article:  make the Simple Syrup recipe (on this site) of one cup water and one cup sugar, cool, add one cup lime juice.  Didn't use Grand Marnier ($$$); maybe next time.  Next time I would also like to try adding more lime juice to the simple syrup.

You really can't go wrong with this recipe.  Whether your a novice drinker, or really like, and can handle your ritas, you can adjust this to taste. They really are amongst the best I've had, and I've had them just about everywhere. This recipe is fantastic!  There is a less expensive alternative  for the Grand Marnier, but make sure to include the ingredient. As well as a designated driver.

Doubled it for a party, and used most of a bottle of Herradura Silver (one of my favorite margarita tequilas) and 1/2 Cointreau for the triple sec to give it some extra orange kick.  It's strong, but exactly how I think margaritas ought to taste.  Not to sweet, doesn't drown the taste of the tequila--just smooth and delicious.  Grand Marnier is a wonderful addition to margaritas.  This is absolute top shelf stuff.

wasn't a fan of this one. Really, really strong and somehow wasn't very flavorful. I think I prefer more of a tequila flavor. This recipe calls for way too much orange flavored liquor.

Excellent recipe! As other people said, this recipe is extremely strong. For 2 servings, I added 1/2 cup sweet and sour, 1/4 cup triple sec, 1/4 cup tequila, a generous helping of orange liquer, and some lime juicel The glass was salted of course.

These are phenomenal!!  We used top shelf tequila and cointreau instead of triple sec.  Everyone wants this recipe.  Perfect proportions.  Amazing!

AMAZING MARGARITAS.  Just the recipe I was looking for.  My husband and I both loved these.  I agree that the first few sips are on the strong side, but as the ice begins to slightly melt, I would say they are the PERFECT MARGARITA!

Try substituting raspberry (or any other fruit flavored) liqueur for the Grand Marnier and you have a delicious raspberry margarita, perfect for any occasion!!!!

I have to agree with the overwhelming majority here...these rita's rock! They are absolutely yummy and as suggested in the other reviews 'potent', which I happened to really enjoy this Friday! TGIF! And, thank you very much for this yummy blend!

I did add a couple of slice of fresh squeezed orange (I like that in my margaritas and it was perfect).

Delicious. I don't use any further orange liqueur (Grand Marnier)--the Triple Sec is enough.

This recipe was a little too sweet for me. I like more of a fresh lime taste than a sugary sweet taste. ** Update: I wanted to use up the leftover ingredients, so made another batch the next day. Instead of stirring the ingredients in a pitcher as I did the first time, the second time I used the blender. The mix splashed up and out of the pitcher and created a foamy, frothy drink which I had to allow to sit until it became liquid again and therefore pour-able/drinkable. Did not like the directions or the flavor. To each his own...

The ABSOLUTE BEST!  I like a margarita.  We had Bunco group where 4 of us hosted.  One hostess (lawyer type) said "Noone will drink tequila on a THURSDAY!"  For 20 ladies - I bought 5 bottles of wine and the fixings for these margaritas - normally, the wine flows~  THEY ONLY DRANK MARGARITAS ALL NIGHT!  One botttle of wine was opened and barely touched but that was after we ran out of 2 1/2 of these batches.  FTR, that's when I ran out of the sweet and sour mix.  It is an excellent recipe that you should try.  Of course, the first recommendation was 'frozen margaritas' - I didn't want to man the blender all night.  I made these up and served them in a pitcher.  All of the ladies were asking for more!  AND I'm making these again tonight for myself and my husband and I've put in a call to my neighbor who hosted with me to come try them again!  Thanks.

I followed it perfectly... not for me. It was maybe too sour? I dont know, but something wasnt right. It DOES make you feel the effects fast so if thats what your main goal is, then this is the right rita!

Very good margaritas!  I'm not sure why the ingredients had to be put in a blender though - since the mixture is served on the rocks.  Stirring everything in a pitcher would be sufficient, and save some cleanup time.  I used Minute Maid frozen limeade (reconstituted per instructions on the can) instead of the sweet & sour mix.

I made about 4 gallons of these for my new years eve party. Overall the opinion was that these are some of the best margaritas ever! As the reviews have said, these are VERY strong, so sip slowly. Since I made 4 gallons at once I added some ice to the cooler which watered it down slightly, but a few people had to add additional water. This will be the only margarita recipe I use for now on, thanks!

These were outstanding. I made the sour mix from scratch (with limes only, no lemons) and followed the recipe exactly, except that we did not freeze them -- left them on the rocks. Served these at my own birthday party (great way to justify $38 for Grand Marnier!) and they were a huge hit. One batch filled six of my margarita glasses.

These are the BEST!  I've had many a margarita in my day, but these are the absolute best I've ever made. The first sip is a killer, but after that, they go down very smooth.  Careful - they give quite a kick!  Thank you for the recipe! Enjoy everyone!

Wow! these were the best Margaritas I have ever had or made!  Our neighbors loved them and so did I.  The blending prior to pouring is awesome...froths them up nice and then pour out over the ice is just amazing!  I wish I had a picture to post. I went with Cointreau instead of Grand Marnier(r) partly because of cost but also because I heard it was better.  Beware though...I spent 120.00 on the supplies alone to make the drinks!  I have leftovers but a lot to invest in for a few drinks.

I was looking for a classic recipe for Margs on the rocks, and this is perfect! The recipe as is, is delicious. But to jazz it up a bit, I added some orange juice like they do at Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurants, and it's even more delicious!!
Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

These Margaritas are REALLY strong!!!! One glass and you will feel a bit tipsy.  They taste very good however, we added a bit more sweet and sour mix and the juice of a couple fresh limes.

I love these..  I prefer more than a 1/4 of a lime in mine... I tend to use closer to a half a lime per drink.  In a pinch you can use bottled lime juice, if you don't have fresh, but the fresh limes are better.  And the higher shelf the tequila, the better they are!

This is my favorite margarita recipe.  I actually have it memorized.  Now when I think of margaritas, I think 1, 1.5, 0.3, 2.  I just have to remember which alcohol goes with which amount.  Thank you!

I've made this with and without the orange liqueur and both times I had to add a little more sweet and sour and some beer to cut it! I'm am not a big sweets fan, but this has a peculiar taste that I'm not very partial to. After trying this a 3rd time, I added 1 can of light beer to the pitcher and it was perfect! You can't detect the beer flavor, but it makes the margarita have a wonderful taste! A 3 star without the beer, but definitely a 4 or more with it! **Update: I've tried this with Baja Bob's sugar free/calorie free sweet and sour and it's great!

Insanely delicious!! I didn't use the lime on the rim, nor the salt, but they were top notch - very very strong, but they should be! It was an expensive batch to make :-) but sooooo worth it!

OMG! These are great! They doo hit you hard. One time I mistakely bought non-alcoholic triple-sec and I was able indulge a little longer because they weren't so strong.  And still yummy. May I also suggest using a can of frozen lime-aid as mixer and I like to do it up in a blender. Enjoy!!!

I scaled the recipe for one since it was just me, and I mixed it in a cocktail shaker.  I used my home made sweet and sour mix (half sugar/half splenda) and it was just perfect.  Had to make another one!

Warning - These things are strong! It really sneaks up on you. The Grand Marnier is a really good addition, but if you are on a budget you can just use more triple sec.

Best Margaritas ever! They are very strong so I reduced the tequila down to about a cup. I added about 1/4 c. of orange juice to counteract the acidity. My friends say it's the best Margarita they've ever had! Thanks Carol!

Since I'm not a big fan of bottled sweet & sour nor triple sec, I was hesitant to try this recipe, but they are the BEST (maybe it's the Grand Marnier?) and everyone I've served them to has asked me for the recipe.

Might I recommend using Sauza 100% blue agave Tequila. And for a lovely twist try adding any flavor of Dekuyper Pucker.I personally like Watermelon or Strawberry Pucker infused margarita's. YUM! Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

These are great. Everybody loved them and wanted the recipe. I did reduce the tequila to one cup and it was just fine. Be sure to get plenty of ingredients. I had to send someone to the store midway through the party because these were so popular.

I've been searching for the perfect rita since a trip 2 yrs ago to San Antonio! This is it!! Smooth, not too sweet or sour. I believe the secret to a great rita is the Grand Marnier. Since these are expensive, I tried the Gran Gala, & it was very good. Don't leave out the Triple Sec either. This is a keeper forever. They go down way too smooth!!

If it was up to me I would have given it 3 stars...it was entirely too strong...but my husband who appreciates a good margarita more than I loved it...so therefore it gets a 5!

Absolutely wonderful!  I didn't have any Grand Marnier the first time I made these and they tasted just fine without it.  I am making them again tonight, but this time I bought some Grand Marnier.  They do sneak up on you really quick, so if you're a lightweight you might want to be careful!

This is a keeper! Made these for a Tex-Mex dinner party - everybody loved them.  I might try adding some sweetened lime juice next time to make it a bit sweeter - other than that, no changes.
These are pretty stout, so I had some limeade on hand for anybody to add to their glass if they wanted it diluted.

They are a little sweet in my opinion.  Maybe I'll add more lime juice next time.  That said, these are the best I've made so far, though, and I'll be making them again!

I made this recipe for Cinco de Mayo this year. I used 1 cup cointreau instead of triple sec and 1 cup milagro tequila. My friends have asked me to make these again and again.  Everyone wants the recipe! A little expensive but worth it.

I cut the recipe in half & decreased the tequila to about 1/2 cup. I thought it could use some more. I also used cointreau for triple sec. I'm not a big margarita fan but these went so well w/ our southwestern menu that I'm going to have to buy some margarita glasses. ;o) Thansk for a great recipe!

This is one of the BEST margaritas that I've ever had.  And, I kept forgeting the last step - squeezing the lime into the drink.  I'm going to serve these at a Book Group I'm hosting on May 5th.

WOOOWEEE... These are extremely strong. I omitted the orange liquor because it was very expensive, maybe that would have made them better and not too overpowering, I dunno. I am not sure if I'll make these again.

Made these for a get together at my house because I was craving some really good margaritas. These are perfect on every level. The best margaritas I've ever tasted. We used Hornitos gold tequila, Dubois triple sec, and Patron orange liqueur. We looked for the cheapest booze possible and the total of purchasing all of these items was somewhere around $50. So if you want a cheap recipe this isn't the one for you. But it was worth the money we spent. It does get you pretty wasted so if you're looking for a margarita that gives you a light buzz this isn't for you either. We used 10 oz. margarita glasses and I made "12 servings". We had 4 people who were drinking and it only gave us about 9 1/2 glasses. I made "8 servings" and it only made 5 glasses. But I'm so glad that I came across this recipe and I hope you all try it out!

You'll never buy another Margarita mix after tasting these!  They are the best I've ever tasted!  I agree with other reviewers, they are on the strong side.  We now make them with a just little less Tequila and a little more lime juice...delicious!

This is the best margarita ever!  I made these for a party and there were none left.   I didn't use a blender based on some of the reviews.  For a single batch (2 servings) I used a shaker.  Thanks for such an awesome recipe.  They are strong so watch out!  Wouldn't have it any other way :-)

I scaled down the recipe for a single portion to try it out... I used homemade key lime sour mix,  Grand Marnier and Espolòn gold tequila, it was strong, but delicious.

This is by far the BEST margarita I have ever had. I found this recipe and my husband bought all the ingredients and made it for me and I love it! I will never order a margarita at a Bar/restaurant ever again because I doubt anyone can top this! It’s that amazing. If you are thinking of buying margarita mix don’t do it! Make this recipe instead. Just know these are strong and it’s easy to want to drink too much because these are so good. I limit myself to two and I give myself time in between the two since I’m a lightweight.

My friends really loved this recipe. I broke it down to be able to make one drink at a time in a shaker.
Add the following to a shaker half full of ice.

2 parts Sweet & Sour
1 part Triple sec
1.5 parts tequila
1/3 part Grand Marnier
1/4 lime squeezed over the ice in the shaker. Toss the lime into a glass with ice.

Shake until the can is very cold. Screen and pour over the ice in the serving glass with or without salt  on the rim.

I made this for my husband and I to kick off Cinco De Mayo and used Herradura Anejo Tequila.  Very smooth and delicious! Be careful it will sneak up on you.  :-)

OUTSTANDING!! Made this recipe but cut back ONLY on the tequila (only used 1/2 cup) and they are absolutely THE best margarita we've ever had!! Even with only 1/2 cup of tequila...still kicked our butts! A keeper for sure...thank you!!

I made it using less alcohol as suggested by others in the comments. I also added 4 frozen strawberries per serving. It's amazing!! Thank you for the recipe.

I made these for a dinner party and they were as good as others say they are. I threw everything into a jar and used it as a shaker instead of the blender.  I had to make 2 substitutions after realizing I didn't have some ingredients. I used frozen limeade concentrate instead of sweet and sour. In place of the triple sec I used a blood orange liqueur. My guests raved about these. Chilled glasses, salted rims, fresh lime wedge -- grab the chips and guacamole and you're set!

I love these and I don't think there is much more to add about the taste or prep.  I will say, be careful.  They taste great and go down easy, and then you have suddenly had too much to drink.

Tastes just like my favorite margarita at a restaurant! I substituted honey in place of the sugar, and it made it healthier and just the perfect amount of sweetness.

Great recipe.  Made it as is.   only difference was the Grand Marnier was Peach flavored.  This is very balanced a d not too limey of a taste. I can't wait to make them again.

All I can say is ... Awesome!! Awesome!! Awesome!! Everyone raved about how good they were. I did tone them down a bit. I only used 1 cup of tequila instead of  1 1/2 cups. All the guests are gone now and I still have a little bit left over to relax and enjoy. (I made a couple of batches). This is definitely the best margarita I've made. Once you find this recipe, stop looking because this one is the best. And it's so easy to make!

these are strong. to help with that I squeezed a medium sized orange into the double sized batch I made.  keep in mind they are still "strong" but just a little smoother to drink.

I have been perfecting my craft of making margaritas for 5 years now.  I came across this recipe and was intrigued by the ratios.  I highly recommend you make your own sweet and sour mix and not use store bought.  2 parts lime juice, 2 parts lemon juice, 3 parts sugar water.  Then follow the recipe…it is out of this world.  My friends and neighbors consider me a margarita master…can't keep up with the demand.  Muddle jalapeños, cucumber and cilantro and kick it up to :"ludicrous" level.

We've been making this exact recipe for years! It's my go-to whenever I know our guests like margaritas. It's so quick and easy to make. Definitely add a lime wedge, serve over a generous glass of ice, and enjoy!

These are fantastic!   Better than any of our local Mexican restaurants can produce in our small college town.  I do have a warning though...they do pack a punch, both in your blood alcohol levels and in your wallet,  so drink in moderation. ??

It's okay. I guess it makes a difference on the brand of the tequila, liqueur, and sweet and sour mix used. If I had used top shelf, I'm sure it would been great.

Very good, but a little strong. Once the ice melted, it was about perfect.

If it is not frozen, is it necessary to use a blender to mix?

These are great and very strong. I made this for a dinner party last night and had to make two batches. We ran out of tequila before we were ready to quit drinking these. Plan for guests to refill often with this great recipe.

My wife and I were assigned the task of finding a margarita recipe that could be used at our daughter's wedding reception. We wanted something not too expensive and relatively easy to make. We love margaritas at our favorite Mexican restaurant but typically splurge on Patron or other premium tequila.

We got our S&S mix at a restaurant supply store where they had high quality mix with pure cane sugar. The great thing was that it was

Yep!  Deliscious alright... I used El Jimador tequila, Grand Gala instead of Grand Marnier, and limeaid as sour mix...    These were a HIT at my cinco de mayo at home happy hour before we went out for authentic Mexican food and 'ritas...   And the verdict - Mine were WAY better than the ones at the restaurant!   Whoop Whoop!!   This one's a keeper!

The best tasting margarita you will ever taste! But this recipe should come with a warning label. After two or three of these - a party will ensue... whether you wanted one to or not! Enjoy (with caution)!
