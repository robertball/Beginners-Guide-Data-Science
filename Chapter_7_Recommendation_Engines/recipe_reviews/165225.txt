This recipe is very similar to the  mango salsa served on a Mexican chain restaurant's Mango Salad (the manager told me how to make it). In that recipe they add some chopped red pepper, red onion instead of white, and don't use garlic.  So, I use red onion, add chopped red pepper, and omit the garlic.  It is very refreshing, and I now have mango salsa cravings!  Hint:  If you don't want to peel and dice mangos, many grocery stores have bags of chopped mango in the frozen fruit section, however it is a little pricey.

Wonderful recipe.....just fantastic w/ grilled fish.  I add the zest of 1/2 lime along with the lime juice , a drizzle of honey for slight sweetness, and a pinch of cumin for pizazz. You've got to try this one!

this was delicious.  We added pineapple for more sweetness and a tomato just because we had it.  Great over tequila lime chicken!

This recipe is fantastic!  I have a tomato allergy, so salsa recipes without them are few and far between.  This recipe is sweet, spicy, and all around excellent.  I left the seeds in the jalapenos for some extra spice and I minced everything because I don't like chunks.  This one is definately a keeper!

I served this with pork tenderloin and it was a great accompaniment.  Take the seeds out of the jalapenos unless you like LOTS of heat.

This is a fabulous recipe with lots of possibilities.  I served it with blue corn chips but as another reviewer stated, it would be wonderful with a grilled pork chop or chicken breast.  I only had two mangoes and a serrano chile and it worked out fine.  I think I might add a little diced pineapple next time to serve with pork.

It was a big hit at the last two BBQ's we have had. I've already given the recipe away...and I even had to use Mangos that were a little tart. I want to try it on chicken.

Really refreshing.  We tried it with tortilla chips and it was ok.  We made chicken breast on the grill and then used the salsa as our hamburger condiment....YUMMY!

This salsa is always a hit at parties!  For some reason people always seem impressed when I make it (perhaps that is a reflection on my cooking abilities.)

As much as I love mangos and cukes, it was average tasting to me. I felt as if one component was missing like tomatoes or something. This didn't keep well as leftovers because the longer it marinated the mangos became a bit slimy. Idk, maybe it's just me.

So good- I have made this salsa several times. I prefer it with fresh mango over frozen, but frozen mango can be used in a pinch too.

I absolutely LOVED this salsa!  Served it over crab cakes with lemon dill rice.  I thought the mango I used wasn't ripe enough but it was perfect; not mushy. The jalapeno (seeded) didn't make my salsa hot at all.  I was happy!  I think I'll add more lime juice though, or even lemon juice next time.

Wonderful recipe!  I added 1/8 of a cup of sugar to make it a bit sweeter, and squeezed in the juice from a whole lime.  It was wildly popular...so many people asked for the recipe after I took it to a party.

Pretty Good....  I rated it 4 stars but only because of personal preference.  I'm not big on semi-sweet salsas but I must say this is the ONLY mango salsa I have ever tried that I actually liked.  I served this over the Chipotle Crusted Pork Tenderloin from this site, which is a spicy dish and this helped even it all out and made a great accompaniment. Ate the rest with tortilla chips the next day with the kids.  Used frozen mangos and that made the consistency a little more soupy but that's ok, it was still very good.  I'll make this again! Thanks for sharing!

What a fabulous dip. EVERYONE loved it. Even the kids.
It was fabulous over ice cream for desert too!

Having never worked with mango's before, I tried to get all the fruit from the seed and then dice it. OMG...this will be the last time I work with mango's. Then I decided to try my onion chopping technique. Cross cut down to the seed on flat sides first, then cut each row off. WONDERFUL!!!! Thanks!!!

I made three salsas for a bbq and this one was one of them. It was really light and refreshing! I think that people were unsure of what it was, even though it was sitting next to the other salsas, because it didn't get eaten for a while. But by the end of the bbq, half of it was gone. Thanks for a fun new recipe!

SO yummy!  It's very light and refreshing.  A nice change from the usual salsa.  You can't stop eating it once you start.  I tried it with chips, and I also poured it over rice - both delicious.  I didn't have jalapenos, and it was still good.

Even better than I thought/hoped it would be; excellent as a matter of fact!  And to think I pretty much chose this particular mango salsa recipe just to use up a cucumber!  I took it easy on both the jalapeno and the cilantro and it was perfect for us.  Fresh, bright, interesting flavor and pretty to look at it, I couldn't have chosen better for our Quick and Easy Shrimp Fajitas and Cuban-Style Yellow Rice, both recipes also from this site.

Fantastic recipe! I added Kosher salt instead of regular table salt.

This was great with Caribbean style pork.  I just wish it were a little sweeter... Maybe I'll try it with really ripe mangos next time.  I wish someone would invite me to a BBQ so I could bust this out! :)

I was hesitant but this turned out fantastic; the flavors really mend well.  I didn't change a thing. I viewed a You tube video for an easy way to cut a mango....really helped!

this was SUPER Yummy!!!  I did screw up cutting the first mango- I've always peeled my mangos (as I'm swearing)... then try cutting them.  But, thank goodness for the internet actually showing me HOW to chop a mango!  It was sooo easy, that I added an extra one to the mix!  This Salsa was terrific, and everyone loved it!

This recipe had a fresh taste with the cucumber but it made it a bit watery. Maybe it's the type of cucumber I used. It was very easy to make so I would definitely try this one again with a little more lime and a little more spice.

This was a fantastic salsa. Great for nacho chips. I served it over tilapia. Wouldn't have thought the cucs would go with fish but all of it seemed to work. Will be bringing this everywhere this summer.

Very yummy!! I made this salsa to serve with Key West Chicken, also from AR, and it turned out to be the perfect accompaniment. My dad could't stop telling me how much he enjoyed it. The recipe is great as written. Thanks for sharing!!

I grew cucumbers in my garden this year and ended up with more than I knew what to do with. I tried just about every recipe that had a cucumber in it and this was by far my favorite. I have used it countledd times to top off chicken or fish and have added it to almost all of my salads.

This was GREAT! I subbed parsley for the cilantro (personal preference), but kept the recipe the same otherwise. This was very nice and refreshing and the flavors blended together beautifully! I served this as a salsa for tortilla chips and everyone raved. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this for my sister-in-law's luau themed baby shower, and it was a huge hit!  It's very addictive, with a little spice and a lot of tangy sweetness, and very refreshing.  I'm planning on making it again for a cookout very soon!

I made it 2 1/2 hours before using it and it just didn't have enough juices, I would make it earlier so it can sit longer and let the flavors really mix together.  This was a nice compliment to cajun seasoned chicken breasts that I made.

absolutely delicious!  But it really should be made the night before, because the longer it sits, the better it tastes.  It was great as a salsa with lime tortilla chips and tonight I'm planing to serve it as a condiment with grilled tuna.  This is such a versatile dish.

This made a lot more than I was expecting for something that has 16 servings  I served it with lime tortilla chips.  It was good, very "fresh" taste, but I just didn't feel like it had a lot of flavor.  Maybe I needed riper mangos...

I made this salsa to take to a pot luck as an appetizer with chips. Someone else brought some dips, so we used this salsa as a condiment on our grilled chicken. Everyone loved it!  There was some left over, so we had it on pork loin and it was also very good! We will be making this often.

Made this to go along with the Key West Chicken recipe on the site. We have fresh cucumbers from the garden. Used two instead of the one the recipe calls for. This went great over rice.

This is a great recipie - simple and relatively quick. I served it over grilled Honey Dijon Chicken (also from this site). My fiance' and I had his parents over dinner and they loved this! They loved how it was different, refreshing and healthy.  My future father-in-law had gastric-bypass a little over a year ago so he's just getting back into a lot of foods and he was able to eat everything in this salsa.  He even asked me for the recipe before they left.    I think i'm going to try it with a little mint next time

VERY GOOD! This was very easy to put together and the taste is very refreshing to what "regular" salsa taste like. It is even better the next day when the mango juices settle in. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

What a fantastic refreshing salsa! Use English cucumbers (seeded) because they contain less water and it won't end up too watery after you add the salt. (salt draws liquid out from the cucumbers). I also added diced peaches and/or nectarines for a little bit of a different flavour and it was delicious! Make sure you serve this salsa with Lime Flavoured tortilla chips..it makes all the difference!

This was so flavorful and refreshing. Left out the jalapenos, as I don't care for the heat. I served it with grilled salmon, it was a perfect complement. It takes just a few minutes to put together, and the colors are gorgeous. It would be delicious stirred into chicken salad or served with tortilla chips. I'll be making more today!

Fantastic recipe!  I served this with tortilla chips but can imagine it would be great with fish.

I did not have cucumber but I did have an extra mango and substituted it. Great taste and smell. Served as an accompaniment for sea bass. Delish

I made this leaving out the chilies due to food intolerance. This was wonderful. I served it over pecan coconut crusted cod. I had some salsa leftover so I added an avocado and ate it for lunch the next day.

This is so fresh and light, served it with pan-fried fresh walleye and steamed  baby potatoes from the garden. The only thing I changed was parsley for the cilantro. Excellent!

Wow! I had my doubts going in, but this was really delicious! I tried my first ever taste of mango the other day, just because I'd seen a really cool way to peel them. I was not crazy about mango solo, so thought I'd try some kind of salsa to use it up. I only had the one mango, so reduced the recipe accordingly. I am really kind of astounded how good this salsa is! Next time, I will make the full batch.

while we enjoyed this salsa i felt like it was just average.. i used a red onion and added a bit of chopped up red bell pepper and some lemon for extra zing.. took the advice of others and sprinkled in some cumin.. not sure what i was expecting but this did taste fresh and that's what we were looking for.. ty for the recipe

I love the many salsa I see with mango and this was a new one with the cucumber. I used some red onion, pickled jalapeno with the seeds, and doubled the lime juice.

Who would think mango and cucumber would go together?  But they do, very well, in this recipe.  I used poblano pepper instead of jalepeno because I don't like hot but otherwise didn't change a thing.  Yum!

I served this salsa immediately after making it (didn't wait the 2 hrs for the "flavors to blend") and it had to be the most delicious mango salsa I have ever had. And I have had my share. Perhaps next time I will add some Jicama for extra crunch.

Thank you for sharing, this recipe is superb! Many people might not think that cucumber belongs in a salsa recipe (I got a couple sidewise glances at least) but my friends tried it and they loved it! The mango is sweet, the onions and jalepeno add spice and the cucumber gives crunch and refreshment. Mmmmmmmm I'll be making this recipe all summer long!

Can't go wrong here.  Added finely diced red pepper and omitted garlic.  Went very well with arctic char (a small trout of Northern waters), which I baked with fresh garlic, lemon rind and juice, some dill and a dash of salt and pepper.  Wonderful combination.

I made this the day before and it marinated overnight.  It was great the next day.  I made it when mangos were a little out of season, so two of my mangos were not real sweet, kind of tart.  So I added sugar to the tart ones and that seemed to help without creating watery juice.  I'm still eating it 5 days later and it's still wonderful.  Everyone at the party loved it, even my husband who doesn't like sweet dips.
