This was really wonderful.  Having said that, I made a few changes partly based on previous feedback.  I cut the parsley in half, used 3/4 cup of mayo instead of a full cup (and used a low-fat version), and added 1/3 cup shredded swiss cheese to the mixture.  It's not that I felt there would be too much mayo -- it's just that I wanted to add the swiss and, knowing it would melt, I had to cut back on something to reduce the grease and not overpowering the seafood completely.  Thank you for an inspiring idea!

Excellent!  I served this as an appetizer for a dinner,  I did make a few changes: used low-fat mayo to help cut the fat (you honestly won't miss the fat), added some finely minced garlic to the crab and mixed in some Parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs.  Made lemon butter for people to drizzle over their own servings.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Very good. I think it needs more seasoning but otherwise very good and easy to make. I used canned crab, Geisha brand, and I did reduce the mayo to 3/4 cup and used a light mayo. I also only used one stalk of celery since I don't normally like it cooked but it did keep its crispness so I was happy. I think next time I will try adding some cheese on top instead of the bread crumbs. One other thing I did was I used homemade Garlic croutons and ground them up to make bread crumbs. I will be making this again for sure.

The idea is there, but the flavor is not.  The most noticeable problem was that it was way too heavy on the breadcrumbs.  Use about 1/4 cup breadcrumbs so that you can actually taste the rest of the stuff in there.  The 1/2 parsley is good if you're using fresh.  Keep it to about 2 tablespoons if you're using the dried stuff.  Add 3 cloves minced garlic and about 1 tablespoon oregano.  Add black pepper and red pepper flakes to taste.

We enjoyed these. I am not big on mayo so I was a little worried after reading the reviews but I thought it was just the right amount. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is that I added old bay and cayenne due to previous reviewers saying it was bland and I if I hadn't added them, I would have to agree. It was an easy fix though and I will make this again.

Delicious.  Spread it over some sole filets and baked...yum.  I added a bit of lemon juice and Old Bay Seasoning to the mixture.  Instead of the shrimp/crab mix I just used a package of imitation lobster.  I make this often.

As is this needed something more...or maybe something less? Heavy taste of mayo, even with the  mayo having been reduced. HOWEVER, I think it is fixable with more crab. But "as is" ... not again for us. Thank you, though!

Wow are these delish.  I never rate recipes but I couldn't wait to complement the creator.  It is a versatile base for adding anything you want.  I added stuff I had left over in the fridge.  Roasted garlic, chopped up  salami, mozzarella, and also some sliced steamed brussel sprouts.  I used white onion instead of green.  I think mushrooms would be a great addition also.  This is truly a keeper.  Thank you for contributing.

I liked how this could be a nice appetizer.  I ate more of the crab cold than I did when it was done.  I really liked the shrimp in the recipe.  If you're not a fan of warm crab, use all shrimp!!

Sorry, but no one here liked these. Very little flavor. We did leave out the shrimp but I don't think that alone would fix it. I think it's a great idea and I want to play around with it to find something more flavorful...

My husband really liked these. The only change I made was to used 2c crab instead of the shrimp we don't really care for it.

I made this as a separate course before Christmas dinner and all my guests raved!  I had some leftover shrimp so I made it again the next day!  Very rich and lots of fat, but it's worth it once and while, right?

I used 2 lbs of Alaskan King crab and no shrimp.  This should not have changed the flavor that much.  I put this in large shell noodles.  The parsely was TOO much, couldn't get past it.
