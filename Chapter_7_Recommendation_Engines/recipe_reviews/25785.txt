Very easy and very good! My husband was craving chocolate and these hit the spot! Didn't have soybean oil so I used canola oil and they came out great.

I don't know what happened to my cookies but they do not look like the photo. Using the chocolate cake mix made them dark chocolate in color. They were cake like "fluffy" cookies. Not at all what was expected.

These cookies are so delicious but definitely don't look like the picture. I used the recipe exactly as it appears and my cookies came out darker fluffy and delicious! Easy peasy recipe too:)

I did change it a bit. Someone else had said that they added two eggs and used half white and half brown sugar and more vanilla. I used coconut flour in place of the wheat flour and used 1T vanilla. They turned out awesome. I am very happy. Sandy P - Cameron Park CA
