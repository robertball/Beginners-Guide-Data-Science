We loved how this came out, but I did change a couple of major things. I felt the tomato sauce and feta would overpower the diverse flavors of the arugula, cauliflower, garlic and olives, so I left it out completely. I added a tablespoon of diced sundried tomatoes, and served with parmesan. It was surprising how well this unlikely combination of ingredients melded together in taste. I'll keep this recipe on hand for when I'm in the mood to change up from the standard pasta + tomato or cream-based sauce.

Used about 3/4 of the 1lb box of pasta, yellow and orange bell pepper, the whole 14oz can of crushed tomatoes, a bit more Italian seasoning, and spinach.  This is really good.  Will definitely make this one again.  Thanks!

This recipe was very delicious. I left out the olives since I don't like them, and I sauteed onions along with the pepper and garlic. Since I added the onions, I used less cauliflower. I also used a 28 oz can of peeled tomatoes instead of using a smaller can of crushed tomatoes, and I didn't need the reserved liquid.  

I will definitely be making this again.

Love this recipe. I had to eliminate some of the ingredients cause I didn't have them on hand, but the basic penne, cauliflower (and broccoli I added), spinach, and cheese combo was awesome. I left out the tomatoes, although my sister added some sauce to hers and liked it. If I had the olives and pepper it would have been even better. Oh, I added a can of cannelinni beans too. Made great leftovers.

Very yummy!  I used a can of tomato sauce in place of the crushed tomatoes cause that's what I had.  Loved the arugula in this...so delicious!

This recipe was ok.  Felt like it was missing something, though not sure what.  Might make again with beans hoping it will enhance the flavor as the recipe is very healthy and could be used as a good base recipe.

I think the 1 Tablespoon of salt in the ingredients must be a mistake...I just used 1 TEASPOON.

This is really healthy, but the flavors didn't seem to come together very well. If I make it again, I think I'd use more tomato.

I didn't love this recipe. It's good, but some of the tastes don't seem to match together. I don't believe I will do this recipe again.

Overall: I loved this and I'd make it again.

Changes I made: I cooked it with spinach, and put the spinach in to cook with the pasta at the same time as the cauliflower. Personally, I prefer cooked greens in a dish like this. I also used one yellow/orange pepper instead of half of two peppers, for ease of shopping.

Loved it. Want to save it and make it again. Substite other greens and spices. Still tastes great.
