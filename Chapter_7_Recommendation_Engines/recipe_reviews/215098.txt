Unlike a prior review, I actually made this recipe.  This drink is extremely fruity, and for me it had a kick!  I can't say it was entirely potent, but it won't sneak up on you - it will come at you full force like the strength of a hurricane!

There's nothing more refreshing than having a drink in the summer time made from Pineapple & Orange Juice. I haven't made this yet, but I have been making drinks w/Ginger Beer. And ladies Ginger Beer also comes in Diet (no sugar). I believe the regular Ginger Beer is 26 or 27 grams of sugar. I'll update this review after I try this, but for now, I can taste this drink w/little wedges of oranges on the rim of the glass! Mmmmm

This was amazing. I left out the grenadine and the second batch I used a whole bottle of Ginger Beer and everyone liked the extra ginger flavor.

I used mango nectar instead of pineapple juice. The ginger beer really adds a bite.

Tastes great,  nice and fruity.   I used Bacardi white with the first batch,  and it was just a bit too much rum.   I used a cup and a half with the second batch and it tasted perfect.

Awesome! I made one batch with Rumchata. It curdled a bit but was delicious. Made the second batch with coconut rum.

These were superb. I thought they might be too sweet, but nope -- they were perfect. I did add a whole can of ginger beer instead of wasting the second half of the can, but otherwise made the recipe as is. Unless you plan to serve this over ice, I suggest shaking some in a cocktail shaker over ice before serving, so that the cocktails are icy cold.

It was pretty good. Pretty much just a different kind of rum punch.
