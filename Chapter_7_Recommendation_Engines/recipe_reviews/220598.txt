Yummy!Yummy!Yummy!  These turned out really good and they're easy to make.  I watched the video on how to make these from the home page of AR and decided I needed to try them.  I even took the ends that I had trimmed off, pushed them together, added a little cheese & garlic to them and got one extra roll out of the batch. I hate to waste things.

I just made these today to go with dinner. They defiantly need something more. I think incorporating some garlic powder and some basil or italian seasoning to the dough mixture would help bring more flavour into the dough.

I made these last week for an easter potluck.  Everyone loved them! They are so simple to make.  The dough is also very versatile,  I doubled the recipe for just the dough (left the egg out) and made two really delicious pizza crusts! Thank you chef john! :-)

Great recipe - really straightforward.  My family devoured the buns and the leftover buns were used for sandwiches the next day and still stayed soft.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Yum Yum even though I did what he said not to do and used fake cheese. It was all I had on hand and I desperately wanted to make it because it looks so yummy.  I also used minced garlic again it's all that I had.  Otherwise I did everything he said to do and it all worked out exactly. I did add parsley, basil, black pepper and red crushed peppers as topping before rolling.

These are AMAZING!!!! I made the dough right in the bread machine (I did need to add a bit more flour for it to come together), and then continued w/ the recipe from there. I used more garlic and a tad more butter than called for as well. As far as the seasonings, I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it. These were a last minute decision and came together in a snap! Wait until you smell these baking, lol! I think next time, I would add a bit more salt to the dough, but that's just my preference. I will be making these A LOT~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wonderful roll recipe, I'll be making these again.  The dough is super sticky and I wasn't convinced they'd turn out.  I added a little extra flour (since I'm at a high altitude) and didn't really measure the filling, just sprinkled everything on the rolled out dough.  In a fit of extreme laziness, I substituted garlic salt for garlic (I'll use garlic cloves next time).  Served with salad, they were great.

I have made these a countless number of times and me and my fiancé love them! I love this recipe because it's simple, and I have gotten to the point where I fill the dough with whatever is in the fridge, sometimes just cheese, and others with chicken and mushroom (then it goes from an roll to a on the go type of pastry). Great recipe! (:

This recipe is a must try! They were an easy bun to make. I doubled the garlic and used Herbs De Provence in the dough itself. Will definitely make again!

Ummmm, YES.  I read the reviews on these rolls, and knowing my husband's tastes, I wasn't about to let the appearance of the rolls supersede the taste.  So, like all any self-respecting, spouse-loving chefs, I made a few modifications...  I actually used Manchego cheese because that's what I had in the refrigerator, and it was awesome.  I added a little bit of extra flour and spices to the bread dough--Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, and garlic salt.  I also sprinkled some partially dried basil and oregano from the previous night on top. I'll be making this again.  Maybe a double recipe.

These rolls are delicious! Made them last night to go with lasagna dinner. Everyone raved. The dough is very soft and sticky. I didn't need to roll it into a rectangle. Just patted it out on the board. I did omit the cayenne because I didn't have any, and added a sprinkling of garlic powder in addition to the fresh garlic. Thanks for the great recipe!

Perfect!!  Used 2T melted butter. Sprinkled with grated parm, garlic powder, parsley, approx 1T minced garlic. Next time, consider rolling into longer rectangle. Then cutting into 16 smaller rolls. Freeze half of them before final rise. Sprayed cookie sheet with olive oil. Sprayed each roll lightly with olive oil and sprinkled with more parm cheese. Baked approx 10 minutes. Finished with small pat of butter on top before serving.

These rolls are great! Can't stop eating them.  The rolls rose very high while baking in the oven, surprised about that since I shortened the second proofing time.  Followed the rest of the instructions without changes and the rolls turned out perfectly. Chef John's recipes never let me down.  Keep on stirring in rolling in the kitchen Johnny!

Omg! These are amazing! I was in search of a recipe that was just like the garlic cheese rolls I used to get from the school cafeteria and this is it! Anything involving yeast is always a bit of work, but this is worth it! Anything I've ever tried to make with yeast has never turned out right so I was so nervous but these came out great! To save on time next time I will use premade pizza dough...but I'm sure it won't turn out as good. These are great!

Ok, So I thought these were Awesome! I could only give them 4 stars out of 5 as I rolled the dough out and cut it to form around a meatball and than in the oven. WOW!! You have to try that, my family says I have to make it again as rolls to experience it as written.

So soft and pillowy. I have never made rolls this good before.

I have also made this dough and used it for cinnamon rolls. I loved how fluffy and soft the garlic rolls turned out so I increased the sugar to 1/4c and then proceeded as normal until after the initial rise time. After rolling out into a 10x12 rectangle I brushed butter all over, about 6 tbsp melted. Then I sprinkled with cinnamon sugar mix. Then I proofed them for the same amount of time as the garlic ones then brushed with butter and baked at 400 for 15 minutes. Then I used a cream cheese icing I found elsewhere on allrecipes. So good this will be my go to dough recipe for things like these!!

I enjoyed making these almost as much as eating them.
After tasting them out of the oven, I decided they weren't garlic-y enough, so I brushed them very generously with melted butter mixed with garlic powder. That gave them the last little bit of oomph that they needed.
These were a nice change from our normal garlic bread sticks. I'll definitely make them again.

Excellent recipe, great flavor. I would add garlic powder to the dough, but not much. I did have to add 1 1/2 cups more flour because the dough was practically liquid, so I would be weary of the advised 1 3/4 cups flour it says.

These were lovely rolls with a very nice texture and the herb and cheese filling were all super nice together. I think next time I may add some additional salt and maybe a bit more sugar somethings missing from the dough it needs just a bit of a boost in basic flavor.

I had a problem with the dough being to thin to work. I made two separate batch's, first batch I had a major problem working the dough, did add some more flour but not much. Did manage to add  the ingredients and make some type of a roll, did not look so good on the baking pan. Second batch added more flour to make it more like bread dough, this time I was happy with the results. Bake both batch's on the same baking pan.
First batch did turn kind of flat looking,but had a real good taste. Real happy with batch two, looked like what I hoped for.
Will make this rolls again. They were easy to make and had tasted great

I think these rolls could be amazing if I could bake rolls better, so I'm giving it 5 stars even though mine came out as 3.5-4.  Since I don't own a brush to put the butter on, I used a spatula. I took them out when they were a complete golden brown and ate 2. The 1st was pretty bland until I added butter, then it woke the flavors up! AMAZING! On the 2nd one I found some garlic that failed to spread evenly. HOLY GARLIC- GAG! I love garlic, but that was insane! So if you use a proper brush to add the butter, and spread the garlic evenly (maybe garlic powder instead of actual garlic next time?) it'll be perfection! Will make again, but not soon- too much mess, as is typical with bread recipes.

The flavor of these was just ok. The dough was too soft and sticky to roll. When you cut them and lay them on their side you cant even see the filling because it just squishes the too-soft dough together when you make the cut. No way was THIS recipe the one in the photo.

I've made this today and it was awesome. I didn't use parmigiano cheese because I didn't have any so instead I used mozzarella cut into cubes and I also used garlic powder and thyme. Thank you Chef John it was yummy with the baked chicken, veggie's and gravy we made.

This was the second bread I've ever attempted and it turned out amazingly. I did end up adding a little extra garlic though (I am a fan of the garlic) but otherwise stuck to the recipe and it was very delicious. Will definitely make this again!

I think these would have been amazing if it wasn’t for all the sugar in the recipe. Next time I’ll halve the sugar or take it out all together. It turned out to be a sweet bread with a hint of garlic. Not what I was going for.

Followed the recipe.  After 20 minutes they didn't look browned enough, so i let them go a few more minutes.  My mistake.  The rolls didn't brown anymore anyway.  So follow Chef John's remark.  20 minutes.  They were still good.  I have a family of 4 and they are all gone!

First of all this is a great recipe.  However, I would suggest do not slice the top because it caused the rolls to spread out to much.  The worse part was the timing of the  bake and 20 min @  400 deg is way too much .  I set the timer and went on to do other things and them rolls burned on the bottom very black before the 20 minutes we up.  Have to serve these for dinner tomorrow and don't
have time to make another batch.  (I made 2 Batches)

It was just okay. I love spicy food, but the cayenne was just too much. It was pretty much all I could taste. If I make it again, I'll probably either cut back on the cayenne, or cut it out all together.

Not too impressed with it. The rolls were excessively large. Need to check the cooking time and take a peek at 15 minutes. The 20 minutes is too long considering they are egg rolls.

Very easy, the only thing I changed was to leave out the pepper. It looks like a lot of work, but it’s not. Make the bread, roll it out, and cover with goodness. I’ve even added the minced garlic to the dough and put extra on when I rolled it out. Comes out great and looks pretty!

These were really good.  I had a little trouble, tho, and used roasted garlic instead of fresh garlic.  First off, even after watching the video I do not think I had enough flour in the dough, as it was really really sticky.  I was hesitant to add any more, since I had used almost a half cup additional flour.  When I rolled it out, I used a LOT of roasted garlic, in addition to the butter.  I only put in about half of the parmesan cheese requested.  I cut the rolls, and then refrigerated it for use the following day.  The next day, they did not rise too well, and I decided they were simply too big, so I cut them in half and reformed them into balls.  The first eight I baked in a pan.  They did not rise too much, but I did get rave reviews on the flavor (Christmas dinner).  The rest I put in small balls in a cupcake tin, let them rise, and they turned out wonderful.  A great flavor!

Good dinner rolls.  Little bit of spice was a nice change of pace.

The taste of garlic overpowers the taste of homemade roll.

I LOVE the idea of this recipe but the dough was just not up to par. It seemed weird while I was making it and I assumed that it would be fine because the video shows dough that acts the same way. Overall I would say that the dough is just really mushy. It needs something to dip with it- I used Balsamic Vinegar and olive oil, but i think tomato sauce would also be good.

I think another dough recipe would be fantastic. One with a harder crust and a chewier inside. Not quite a bagel but getting there. Perhaps letting the dough rise three times was the kiss of death for this recipe. 

I will be using the idea for this again- treating these things like cinnamin rolls- but I wont be using this particular bread.

I thought these were pretty good, but my husband was looking for a more cheesy experience. It definitely is subtle, but not bad.

Great recipe! Good result for not too much effort. I decided that it was too expensive to buy the parmesan reggiano cheese for my first try of this recipe so I just used regular edam cheese but next time I will splash out on the good stuff and see what the fuss is all about!

The proportion of water to flour was too high. So the dough was too sticky and unmanageable.

Directions were great, followed recipe exactly.  I really liked them but my kids didn't care for the spiciness from the cayenne.

I don't know what I did wrong, must have been something.  Did not turn out nicely at all.  Will try again in the future.

These are great, even though I didn't have any parsley I just used extra garlic (which I recommend if you like garlic) and they are delicious! Also, I used about 1/3 whole wheat flour instead of all purposed, and they were still light and fluffy.
