I first made this cobbler back in July 2003. I've made it so many times since then, and on every July 4th, that I don't even have to look at the recipe anymore. The only change I've ever made is to reduce the amount of water to 1 cup, and I ALWAYS use a 9x13 in pan. Works perfectly everytime, and I take home an empty pan EVERY (no exagerations!) time the past 5 years. I use 6-9 fresh peaches, and have used blueberries too. Today, I tried adding a dash of freshly grated nutmeg to the peaches. Still an excellent recipe, and the only one I go to for a cobbler!

I haven't made a cobbler in ages and was hesitant to try this recipe because of conflicting reviews, but I made some modifications and it was AWESOME!  I used 8 fresh peaches, 1 cup sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon in the fruit, 3/4 cup sugar and one tsp vanilla in the batter, and 1 cup hot water with 4 Tbsp butter.  Baked in a 12 x 9 pan for one hour and let rest for 30 minutes to let the juices gel up.  I would give 5 stars, except for the modifications needed.  Definitely will make again!

A wonderful-tasting peach cobbler recipe that is so easy to make!  At other reviewers recommendations I used 6 fresh peaches instead of 3, 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups, and only 1 cup of boiling water instead of 2 cups.  The cobbler came out perfect...moist and full of fruit!!

I tried this recipe for the first time with much trepidation. It appeared I would need an engineering degree to pull it off. I mean really, pouring boiling water over perfectly good ingredients? However I tried it anyway, halfway through I tasted the batter - it was horribly salty. My husband said bake it anyway maybe it would get better in the oven. So I proceeded per instructions. It smelled wonderful! We were all salivating over it as I pulled it out of the oven perfectly golden. I was so proud of myself. We all waited in anticipation of that first bite... SALTY!! My husband took a wopping serving determined to eat it anyway... he ate it like he had a sore tooth grimacing with every bite. Something was seriously wrong! So I went in search of the cause and THERE on the counter I discovered a completely emty salt canister, my ever helpful two year old had decided to  refill the sugar container. So my cobbler had about two cups of salt. The flies refused to land on it. *sigh* I did attempt this recipe at a later date and it was fabulous. Helpful tip: ALWAYS check the sugar before baking. :)

Wow - this just came out of the oven and I had four pieces - it's that good! I followed reviewers' advice and cut the sugar in the peaches to 1 cup and the water to 1 cup. I also added vanilla to the water. I used six peaches. Yum!
Update: I love cobblers really peachy so next time I tried this with eight peaches. It didn't work - way too much liquid and it didn't bake properly. So I see that six is the way to go.

YUMMY!!!  I've never made cobbler before, but this was easy and delicious!  I took  into consideration some of the helpful suggestions made in other reviews, and was quite pleased!   I DOUBLED the fruit, and used HALF the sugar AND half the water.  It was the perfect combination of fruit and dough!    A definate keeper :)

I made this cobbler this morning and my husband and I have already eaten at least a third of it!  The cobbler is delicious.  I did follow the recommendations of so many others:  increasing peaches to 6 and reducing sugar to 1 cup (for peaches).  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla to batter and substituted unsalted butter for the shortening.  I, too, had to bake longer...almost 1 1/4 hours...but I'm sure that the additional peaches has something to do with the longer cooking time.  This is a real keeper!  Thanks Jannette for sharing!

Wow!  This recipe is awesome!  I,too used only 1 cup of sugar in peach mixture and it was perfectly sweet.  I also only used 1 cup of boiling water and the cobbler was plenty juicy. I had to bake mine much longer than 45 minutes, probably more like 1 hour and ten minutes to get it to set and brown on top.  That could have been my oven, but I normally don't have problems with bake times.  My toddler liked it and that's unusual.  I will definitely make again. I could eat the whole thing!!!

This cobbler is the best I have ever made!  I get requests for it all the time now.  I also used 5 large peaches, only 1 cup of sugar, and only 1 cup of boiling water and it turned out delicious!

I only gave this recipe four stars because it needed to be tweaked. Like the other reviewers, I reduced the boiling water to one cup, and melted four Tbsp. butter into it. I reduced the sugar you add to the peaches to one cup and used brown sugar instead of granulated sugar (MUCH better!) In addition to the cinnamon, I added a half tsp. of ground ginger and a pinch of salt to the peaches and a little cornstarch for gelling insurance purposes!

I cannot imagine what would have happened if I added 2 cups of boiling water. It wouldn't have fit into my 10x10 baking dish, that's for sure. As it was it took about an hour to fully bake to evaporate all the water off and for the center to set.

In the end, this recipe was fab! Best cobbler I ever made. I was curious to try it since I had never made a cobbler where you pour boiling water over the top! I don't know quite what it does, but it turns out great.

I came across this recipe in my All Recipes cookbook and did not take the time to read others' comments as I usually do, but it still came out fine. I cut back on the sugar because the fresh peaches I used were plenty sweet. I used five large peaches and only used about 1 1/2 cups water. The filling ran over a little bit, so next time I will only use 3/4-1 cup of water. For added flavor I sprinkled nutmeg in with the cinnamon. 

Oh, and if you have trouble peeling peaches here is a tip: Dunk them in boiling water for 30 seconds, let them set for a couple of minutes and the peel comes right off. Try it! Thanks for sharing Jeannette.

This was my third peach cobbler recipe this week and by far the best. What made this one special is the clever butter method. DELICIOUS. Beware, underneath the cobler crust it's like a soggy cake or a pudding. I skimped on sugar and witheld some water. Everyones pans may be different so play it by ear. I also piled in as many peaches as possible. Another trick I used when placing the peaches on the dough is to leave them 1" away from the edges of the pan.  I took that extra batter and carefully lined the edges of the peaches with more batter. It made the crusty edges double delicious! I will make this again if I do not find a better recipe.

Oh my heavens!!! This is incredible!!! I used butter instead of shortening and only used half the sugar with the peaches (which were off of our tree), added a couple of peaches and only half of the boiling water. Stellar cobbler!!! I am deleting all other peach cobbler recipies and ONLY using this one!! Thanks Jan!

All I can say is this is heaven in a baking dish! I picked this recipe b/c it had the best rating. I am so glad I did. Although this is not helping me stick to my diet. It has been a HUGE hit with everyone I am sharing it with. We have a peach tree so I used our own fresh peaches. Yummy!!

This recipe was good! I used a 13x9 inch pan, reduced the water to 1 1/2 cup, reduced the sugar (in the peaches) to 1 cup, added a half teaspoon of nutmeg, and used 7 peaches. It turned out perfectly! Next time I make it I will keep all of those changes and add just a couple more peaches. I like my cobblers very peachy!

Very liquidy and never set up for me even after leaving the pan in the oven longer.  Top ended up starting to burn when I finally pulled it out and it still was like batter under the crust.  Won't make again.  Not a good recipe if everyone has to make so many modifications to the original to make it work.

I've only made cobbler a few times, but this is the best recipe I've ever used.  The only changes I made were using 7 fresh peaches instead of 3 and 1 cup of boiling water instead of 2.  It was very good, but very sweet.  I would reduce the sugar next time, but it's very good anyway.  I can't wait to try this with blueberries and blackberries. Thanks for the recipe!  This will be my cobbler standard now.  :)  ****EDIT**** I made this with blueberries and it's delicious, as well.  I reduced the sugar this time to 3/4 cup in the crust and added a tsp. of vanilla, and 1 cup on the berries and added some lemon juice to them.  Used one pint of berries, which resulted in the cooking time being increased to an hour and five minutes.  You could get away with less blueberries, but it still came out great and definitely still sweet enough.  I LOVE this recipe and am making the peach cobbler for my dad for Father's Day!

What went wrong?? Using the advise of others I increased the number of peaches to 5 large ones, reduced the sugar on them to 1 cup, used 1 cup boiling water and baked for an hour. It tastes great but is more of a peach pudding than a cobbler.  No solid cake just gummy mush.

I've tried many peach cobbler recipes. It's my favorite dessert. But this really takes the cake. I used a lot less sugar. 1/2 c for the peaches and 1 1/4 cup for the batter. I also followed others' suggestions: use 1 cup of boiling water with 2 tbs of butter.

Best of the best.  I read all the reviews and feeling adventurous, I ignored all the suggestions and used as much liquid as recipe called for.  It looked impossible when I placed it in the oven - this is going to end up a soupy thing, I thought.  NOT!  It is absolutely delicious.  Now - just as with a pie, we cooled it completely (just as you would a fruit pie). But I certainly would not negotiate the liquid measurement until you tried recipe first.  Altitude certainly can need an adjustment.  We did need to cut back 1/2 cup of sugar, but this is because I used frozen peaches in light syrup from last season.

I only had 1/4 c shortening, so I made half a recipe.  I baked it in a 2 qt round casserole dish.  It was WONDERFUL!!!!  I took the advise of others & only did 1/2 of the amount required for the boiling water & butter, and it was good, but the next time I do it I am going to use it all.  I like it with more of a sauce than it had; if you like a less juicy cobbler - only use half.  The recipe was wonderful & shouldn't be altered.

Well.. let's say that I can't make anything from scratch.. nothing!! 

So I decided to try this since it seemed you can change a number of things and still succeed.

I used canned peaches instead (equivalent to 6-7 whole peaches.. you really can't get by with the 3 it calls for). I also put 1 cup of sugar with the peaches and thought it seemed like a lot so didn't add the 1/2 cup more. I also upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp. Instead of pouring the water over the top, I saved the juices from the cans instead! Worked out great!

I think I made this about an hour ago and it's almost gone... I only wish I had some vanilla ice cream to add to the top!

If I can make this.... ANYONE CAN.

This is an amazingly good recipe!  I was a little worried about putting the topping on the bottom and pouring water over it at first, but it turned out great.  I personally like mine to be a little more fruity, so I use 5 peaches instead of 3.

Very good.  Followed suggestions of less sugar and more peaches.  Glad I did so.  It would have been way too sweet.  The fresh peaches I used were sweet enough.

My sister and I made this and reduced the boiling water to 1/2 cup. It was VERY sweet and we plan to reduce the sugar next time! The cobbler part was very yummy and cake-like. We also added 3 times the peaches called for. Very good!
 Thanks......

WOW!! Absolutely fabulous!!  I made a few alterations.  I used tons of peaches-lost count! I used a 9X13 pan. Only added one cup of sugar and a little more cinnamon.  I used a cup of butter flavored Crisco and omitted the butter/boiling water completely.  It is GONE!!  This is by far the best cobbler recipe I've ever made.  Can't wait to try it with blueberries!  Thanks Jannette!  This is a winner!

I cut the sugar in half on this recipe and it was still very sweet.  It was super easy to make and turned out a very tender dough that melted in your mouth.

Great recipe but only with revisions, hence only 4 stars. I followed another reviewers advice and I can't imagine it would have been successful had I not.
I used 9 peaches - that's a whole lot more than 3!!
I only used 1 cup sugar in the peaches which was more than ample, and 2 tsp. cinnamon.
I only used 3/4 cup sugar in the batter, again more than sufficient.
I only used 1 cup of boiling water - 2 cups would definitely have been too much. My peaches were very ripe so there was a lot of juice from the peaches.
I baked it in a 9 x 13 inch pan.

This is a great cobbler! I was searching for one that called for fresh peaches and I love the addition of cinnamon as well. I am rating four stars only because the cooking time was not long enough. Mine was not cooked at 45 minutes. 15 more minutes did the trick and the middle was then done. Great with whipped cream. Will make again!

First cobbler I've ever made. I did increased the fruit cause I had ton of peaches at home but forgot to decrease the sugar amount as others recommended. It would probably deserve 5* then but without these adjustments it was too sweet and chewy with the caramelized sugar. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU USE MORE PEACHES AND LESS SUGAR!!!

Oh my goodness! This is a great recipe. Will definitely make again. In fact, I'm having it cold for breakfast at this very moment. Like some others, I only added half the amount of water. Also, my shortening was rancid so I just used butter its place. It's really cool how the crust rises up above the peaches as it cooks.

This cobbler tasted great though needed to be cooked for more than an hour and fifteen minutes.  I took others' suggestions and reduced the sugar in the peaches to 1 cup and the boiling water to 1 cup.  Maybe reducing the boiling water to half a cup would have been better?  The cobbler was definitely soupy.

Holy Smokes...this recipe Terrified me! Pouring boiling water over perfectly beautiful peaches & batter was quite an experience - if not for rave member reviews, I Never would've attempted it.  Everyone was totally correct, tho...it was aMazing!    My changes [because, of course, there were many!] to lower the sugar/fat considerably were; 6 peaches instead of 3 [which upped the flavor quotient!], 2/3 cup sugar is all that was needed to perk up the peaches along with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.   For the batter, half stick of unsalted butter & 1/4 cup ground flaxseed was just enough fat & really lightened it up with 2/3 cup of sugar giving it just the right touch of sweetness.  I added the peach juice to the boiling water to make 1 cup along with 1 teaspoon of vanilla & just 2 Tablespoons of butter, then held my breath & poured!!!   Baked for an hour, left to gel for another half hour, the smell is Divine - this cobbler is truly to Die For!!  With homemade whipped cream or frozen vanilla yogurt on top...O.M.G.!!!   Kudos to Jan for the original – hope you enjoy the modifications.

This was not the kind of cobbler I was looking for. I wanted something more doughy. This recipe came out more like a crisp. It was also too sweet. It went over well tho! No one complained.

I used 8 mostly smallish fresh fron the tree peaches, cut the water to 1 cup, baked for 1 hour and left the rest as listed.

I was very nervous because I was taking this dish to a family dinner. My mother in law and her mother make a wonderful peach cobbler. This was a last minute thing and this was all I had to take. So....

Everyone really liked it. However, the peaches tasted more like apples. Most likely the cinnamon helped this idea along. We dubbed it the "peach haters peach cobbler". It went over quite well, but not what a expected. Still it will most likely show up at my house again. Not bad.

Very good, I think. This was the first time I have ever had any type of cobbler, so I had nothing to compare it to.  My dish wasn't big enough, so it bubbled over a bit in the oven.  Also, I cut more peaches than the recipe suggested because the 3 didn't seem like enough.  I would probably make this again.

Waaaaay too sweet. I love sweets-can't live without them. But not this much. I even reduced the sugar in the peaches to 1 cup and in the flour mix I out 1 cup. I used fresh peaches so I wouldn't have the worry about extra sweetness with canned. Don't like the crust because it's not. It's a dough. And I only used 1 cup of water to pour over the mixture. The only good thing in this recipe was the peaches. I think I'll pass on this one. Don't waste your peaches.

I rated this 5 stars, but that only applies if you like cakey cobbler. I used 1C. sugar on the fruit, which was just right for me. And 1 1/2 C. water because my 9x9 pan couldn't hold any more.  It turned out well, there was a lot of juice when I first cut into it, but that was probably because I had to have some immediately! But all the extra juice absorbed into the cake and kept it moist.

Delicious!  I used 5 peaches and followed the recipe -- except I used a glass 13 x 9 pan instead.  It was wonderful -- however, next time I think I'll add even more peaches.  The more fruit the better.  A must try recipe, thanks!

Perfect old-fashioned cobbler! Batter rises to the top and surrounds the peaches in a gooey pudding like mixture. Delicious with vanilla ice cream on top. I reduced the sugar (from 1 1/2 cups to about 3/4 cup) based on other reviews and to be honest, I thought the cobbler wasn't quite sweet enough even though the peaches I used were very sweet. Next time, I'll use at least 1 cup.

Wow. My husband loves peach cobbler so I wanted to make him one for our first year anniversary.  I can't believe how great it came out.  It does tend to be on the sweet side, so adjust it to your taste.  However, I've never had a dough that tasted so good and moist.  I was hesitant to pour the 2 cups of water on top of the whole thing, but it paid off with giving me a yummy cobbler with lots of gooey peaches and sauce!  Thanks.  A keeper.

My husband and I both agree that this is the best peach cobbler we have ever had.  My husband did think there should be more peaches.  I did find it difficult to find a 10X10 pan and had to use 8X8 and bake a little longer.  Will be shopping for a 10X10 pan, if only for this recipe.  This may be an old recipe but are't they sometimes the best of all.

I used 9 fresh peaches (they're homegrown and a bit smaller), 1 cup sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon in the fruit; 3/4 cup sugar in the batter; 1 cup hot water + vanilla for the pouring over. This was a really delicious cobbler! Everyone in my family loves peach cobbler but we'd never made it, and with the modifications, it came out great! I might use only 3/4 cup hot water next time, but other than that, lovely recipe!

This is so good and so easy to make!  It's a family favourite.    The only things I do different is use 4 peaches instead of 3 and have on occasion substituted butter for the shortening.     I've also made it with canned (in water only) peaches and frozen peaches.  It all works!  I serve it with a little drizzle of light cream.

Awesome Cobbler!!!  I was a little apprehensive of using white peaches, as I had heard that they aren't known for making great cobblers, but they were all I had.  So I added lemon juice to the peaches for tartness, and cut sugar back to one cup, also reduced boiling water to one cup, as suggested by previous ratings.  Even the "cake" part was amazing!  Very very good, can't wait to try it out with different fruit options :)

Oh WOW!! This is it. The cobbler I have been looking for. I made it twice for Thanksgiving because I forgot to add the water to the first one, which was cherry. It turned out to be just like peach cobbler IV found on this site. It looked beautiful and I couldn't wait to try it until I remembered I forgot to add the water. Now adding all of this water just didn't seem right. But, I tried it anyway, this time using peaches. This was soooo good. Made a sauce.  Next time  I will substitute butter for the shortening add a little more sugar. I always flavor my pie filling with cinnamon, nutmeg, and mace. Delicious. P.S. After reading some of thiese reviews, perhaps I forgot the sugar, that's why it wasn't sweet enough for me. I used canned peach pie filling, which is already sweetened. However, I always add sugar to canned pie filling. For some reason I forgot this time. It was Thanksgiving eve. Very busy. Can't wait to try again.
Follow-up:  Made this last night for my husband's job. I used 3 cans of peaches. I doubled the dough recipe. After I made my main cobbler, which was about 1 and 1/2 times larger than the original recipe, I had enough leftover to make a small cobbler for us. I don't like a lot of cakie dough so I used less dough and a lot of filling. I used butter in the dough before. Not necessary. Did not change the tast a lot. I will add cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough next time, see how that goes. Wonderful recipe.

This was just so sugary. I personally love sugar, I have a huge sweet tooth. I found that, although it was really tasty, I couldn't really taste the peaches which made me really sad. I think next time I'll either add more peaches, reduce the sugar, or both.

A great recipe.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used half the sugar with the peaches and only 1 cup of water with the butter.  Turned out great, although, I did cook it for closer to 80 minutes but that could just be my oven.  I used 3 very large peaches (probably about 4-5 cups sliced) and that was just about right.

LOVED this recipe, as did my whole family! We did as others suggested and reduced the sugar to 1C, (1/2 brown and 1/2 white), and honestly, I think you could easily go down to 3/4C, and I will do so next time as it was still VERY sweet even at 1 full cup! I also only added 1C of water.  Thanks for this recipe, it is a keeper!

Used half the water, more peaches like most others suggested, and used half brown sugar, half white and baked in a 8x11 pan... it almost didn't fit!  Also added some blackberries I picked in the yard.  Yummy!

WOW. I'm eating this right now and I can't believe it so good! I've never made fresh peach cobbler before and I killed it tonight! Husband JUST said as he walked from the living room with an empty bowl, "That was pretty colossal. I'm starting to suspect you have super human skills." Seriously he just said that. I DID make some adjustments- I used melted coconut oil for the shortening, therefore I had to add about a 1/4 cup of flour. I also used about 5 big peaches, and added about 1/2 TBSP of flour to that for the extra juices. Coconut oil is a perfect sub for shortening-WAY healthier and it's now easier to get. Also I had to cook it a little longer-I watched it, but I'd say it was about an extra 15mins. Enjoy! Great recipe, we will keep it.

If you are using unripe grocery store peaches the consistency of wood, this is the recipe for you!  We used fresh peaches from the farmers market that were naturally sweet and very juicy, and this recipe was a failure.  We had peach soup.  Do yourself a favor and use a bigger pan, cut the water, and cut the sugar if you are using ripe summer peaches.  You might want to add a little flour or cornstarch to the peaches too.  Or better yet, find a different recipe.  I have tried other versions of this type of cobbler with much success.  In my opinion a recipe does not deserve stars if it does not stand on its own.  If you have to make a lot of alterations to make it work, then it's not the same recipe.

This was great.  I cut the sugar to 1C. with the peaches and used twice as many peaches.  I also used only 1 C. of the boiling water and could have used even less.  I had to bake it for 70 mins.  but it was still delicious and would be good with any fruits.  My hubby gave it a thumbs up.

Tried this yesterday and it was a hit! Unfortunately, I used canned peaches. Since they're sweeter than the fresh ones, I'd recommend less 1/2 cup of sugar to mix with them (recipe for 6 servings)

Great recipe except I would make some changes.It was too sweet for us, a little too wet in the middle after baking it for 45 min.and it needed more peaches. Therefore, next time I will decrease sugar on the peaches to 1 cup  add 1 1/2 cups of boiling water instead and increase peaches by two more peaches. The kids loved it with a little whipped cream on top of their piece. This cobbler recipe is a keeper, wonderful. Thanks Jan.

This was fantastic.  I followed several of the reviews and used 6 peaches and only 1 cup of sugar in a 9x13 pan.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla to the milk in the batter and a little grated crystallized ginger to the peaches.  I used the entire 2 cups of boiling water and it turned out with a great consistency. I'm adding this to my list of keepers.

As suggested in many of the reviews I cut the sugar to 1 cup for the peaches and 3/4 cup for the batter.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  I gave four stars becase this was really good, but not what I think of as cobbler.  I'd call it more like a cake I think.

Was looking forward to an outstanding dessert, but was disappointed.  I baked it 25 minutes longer than recipe said and the crust was still thin and gooey.  Not sure I will try this again as I have a favorite from Good Housekeeping recipe book.

DELICIOUS!!! I used fresh frozen peaches that I had put up last summer. Instead of the water I used 1 cup of the natural juices on them. It did take longer than suggested to bake. Served with vanilla ice cream. Yummy.

I did not care for this recipe. It took way longer than 45 min. to cook - We had it in the oven for a total of 3 hours and even then it was still soupy. Not worth the time, effort or caloric intake.

I followed this recipe to a tee as I always do the first time. I do have to agree with some others that it was a bit sweet, but definately not soggy! If you let it set and cool after you take it from the oven, it is of perfect consistency!!! My family loved it! I would only recommend that you do cut the sugar a bit, but I also think if you do that you must reduce the water as well since this combination will tell if it is soggy or not. It would be great with a conbo of apples and peaches, or simply left on their own. Bravo! Will definitely make again!!

I used the size pan reccommended by this recipe and was way too small, everything came over the pan and made a HORRIBLE mess in my oven!!! I thought to myself when I first read this recipe that I should use a 9x13 pan, and didn't because noone else had mentioned this problem. I also next time would use frozen peaches, which would be a lot easier. Taste was very good though.

Oh soooo good!  I made this in the Summer with fresh peaches (five smaller ones)  and only 1 cup of the boiling water in a 9 X 13 inch pan. I'm going to try it today with canned peaches- yes I know not AS good.   I like that this recipe does not use a pre-made mix!

This is the best peach cobbler recipe I have ever used. I was very skeptical about the boiling water, but it works perfectly. This is for those who don't care for a pie-like crust.

I keep forgetting the cinnamon and it's fine without it.

This is sooooo good! This is the first peach cobbler I've ever made and I was a bit worried at first about if it would be difficult but this was so simple to follow and is delicious! The thing I did different was that I used canned peaches (29 oz. can) and instead of water I used the juice from the can and ended up using about half the amount required by the recipe. It came out so good both me and my husband ate it and had seconds. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream on top. I would definitely recommend this cobbler! Whether you are a new cook or a veteran cook this cobbler will just blow your mind!

I took the advise of others and made a few changes and this cobbler was a hit!  We got invited to a last minute BBQ at a neighbors and I had just taken this out of the over - I had to promise the recipe before I left.  I used 5 large peaches, and cut the sugar to 1 cup in the peaches.  I added maybe 1/4 cup of sugar to the flour mixture and it was perfect.  I only used 1 cup of water and bakes it all in a 9X13 pan for about 50 minutes. MMMM good.  Thanks Jannette!

Rated five star with the following changes:  Use six peaches, 1 cup of sugar and reduce water to only 1/2 cup- - especially with juicy peaches.  I added 3/4 cup of blueberries and placed in an 8 x 12 baking dish and baked for 50 minutes.  Very sweet but excellent!!!  Very, very glad I read the reviews first!

I'm glad I read the reviews before I made this because it came out very good with a couple of changes.  I used lots of peaches - enough to cover the bottom of a 9x13 dish, and used only 1 cup of boiling water with the butter.  It was a great way to use the basket of peaches I bought that all ripened at the same time!

I didn't like this recipe. It was too soupy even after cutting back on the water. I would cut back on the sugar too and use more peaches. Also, it wasn't the best cobbler dough I've tasted. I guess, if the recipe does not work well as it was originally posted, I can't give it a good review. It needed too many modifications and all the reviews didn't seem to agree on just want the adjustments should be. I wouldn't make this again.

This is soooo scrumptious! I also followed the modifications suggested - just 1 cup sugar mixed with the fruit and 6 peaches instead of just 3 - also I omitted the water all together, just cut the butter up and put it on top.  I made it for Father's Day and it only lasted that one day! I've already made it again with blueberries - just as good. YUM!

This was so good!  I followed others' advice, and reduced the sugar to one cup, and only added on cup of boiling water.  I also added a little cinnamon to the batter because I love cinnamon and never think you can have too much.  My son doesn't like the skin of peaches, so I only had nectarines in the house, and they were perfect..I didn't even bother peeling them.  I really think you could use a variety of fruits, particularly berries.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Sounds like everybody makes this recipe a little differently.  I followed the recipe except I used 5 peaches and only 1 1/4 cups water.  It was fantastic.  This will be my only cobbler recipe from now on.  I can't wait to try it with blueberries!

I made a half "batch" of this recipe yesterday, we ate all of that, and I had to make more today.  It is VERY yummy.  This time I made it with 2 quart jars of home-canned peaches (ran out of fresh).  I was concerned that they would be mushy, but it still turned out great.  Now I know I can make this any time of year.  I use half of the sugar on the peaches and half of the water poured on top.  I actually used the peach juice instead of the water the 2nd time.  You can't mess it up!!  Thanks for the yummy recipe.  My mom doesn't cook much, but she actually asked for this recipe.  That says a lot.

WOW!!!  I can't say enough.  This was delicious.  I cut the sugar in HALF though because the first time it was too sweet.  I DOUBLE the fruit, HALF the sugar.  I am pregnant and craving cobbler and I could eat this stuff ALL DAY LONG!!!

This recipe is the best! This was my 1st time making a peach cobbler and now I think this will be the only thing I do make. I was really surprised at the finished product. Usually my family reads and follows recipes to the "t" but they never turn out right. This was perfect!!!! My famaily REALLY thanks you.

I have been looking for the perfect cobbler recipe all summer. My husband doesn't eat a lot of desserts but he specifically asked for a berry cobbler in the spring/early summer. I tried a couple different recipes but he kept saying they were "too cake-y" and not really a cobbler like he wanted. I found this recipe and decided to try this but realized my peaches were still too firm so I ended up using one peach and 2 1/4 cups blueberries (just because that's what I had on hand that was ready for use). It was delicious and my husband said this was just what he'd been wanting. He told me to save the recipe so I can make this again. After reading the reviews, I used 1 cup sugar, a couple teaspoons of lemon juice and a teaspoon of cornstarch in with the fruit. Only used 3/4 cup sugar in the dough and 1 cup boiling water. I did add vanilla to the dough mix. Other than the pan I used being too small (my own fault) it was perfect! It is safely stored in my recipe box for future use. Thank you for sharing a perfect cobbler recipe!

I took the advice of others and cut back on the amount of added water.  Delicious flavor and pleasant texture.  The second time I made this I used canned peaches so I added hot peach liquid instead of water and it was also fantastic.

I made this for my mom for Mother's Day and she said she absolutely loved it (I did too)! This was easy and fast. I did not have a 10 x 10 pan so I used a 9 x 9 pan instead and lessened the boiled water. It came out great! Everyone should make this!!!

This is GOOD!!  I've made it many times.  I use frozen sliced peaches or nectarines that I picked over the summer.  The fruit I used was VERY ripe and sweet when picked/frozen therefore I add very little, maybe 1 TBLS sugar to the fruit.  I usually use a couple extra peaches and a bit more cinnamon.  I usually use 1.5 cups boiling water because when the peaches thaw there is quite a bit of syrup.  We LOVE this recipe!!

This cobbler was not edible. I believe the water drowned the peaches and made the bottom liquidy.I would not risk making this cobbler again.

This is a great recipe.  The crust is a soft, fluffy crust rather than a biscut type of crust.  I've used all different kinds of fruit and berries and it turns out good each time. It's very easy as well and makes a big batch.  Great for bigger families or gatherings.

The flavor of this cobbler is fantastic. However, I had to make too many adjustments to give it a higher rating. I added in 5 peaches and reduced the amount of water to only 1 cup. I also decreased the amount of sugar in the peach mixture by half. Adding more detracts from the natural sweetness of the peaches.

Delicious!  I changed a few small things that were suggested--1 cup instead of 1 and 1/2 of sugar, 1 cup of water instead of 2, and used 5 medium fresh picked peaches.  It was all gone from five people after dinner.  I will definitely make this one again.

Absolutely delicious! I was making this for a picnic and unsure of pouring water over pan but tastes just like Grandma used to make! I used 8 peaches and doubled the rest to make two cobblers so we could try one!  I love it!

OMG this is probably the best peach cobbler I've ever had. I also used 1 cup boiling water and a 9x13 pan. I also used 4 large peaches. It turned out fabulous and was easy enough for me to do. I even added a picture. the cakey part turned out soooo fluffy and has just a little chew to it where the juice touched the edges.

This was so good. I've always made the cup of sugar, milk, flour recipe...which we love. I do think I could have eaten the whole thing. I followed the reduction in sugar and water as suggested but I think next time I'll follow the recipe...to see. It was amazingly good.

I used more peaches (around 6-8) than called for and I didn't peel them. I also used orange juice instead of milk and I didn't add the boiling water at the end. It turned out fantastic. The bread was nice and cakey, the peaches and juice thickened nicely. Very delicious!

I used the "cobbler" part of this recipe but substituted frozen triple berry mix from Costco (blueberries, raspberries, Marionberries) ... cut the sugar in the berries down to only a couple of tablespoons and the water on top to 1 cup.  Had to add about 30 minutes on to baking time.  It was amazing - good heated up in microwave or cold from fridge.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made it for the first time and absolutely loved it.  I did make some modification as per some other comments.  Like instead of 1 1/2 cup sugar, I used half cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar.  I also used fresh nutmeg and vanilla.  And instead of using 2 cups water, I only used one.  My husband never tried peach cobbler and he's not a peach person, but  he loved it.  Especially right out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream

I made this for the very first time a few nights ago and it came out perfectly!! I followed the other reviewer's advice on cutting back the boiling water to 1c and the sugar to 1c as well and the result was divine! I also used 6 or 7 fresh peaches and it was a terrific ratio fruit:breading.  Almost cake-like.  Will definately be making this more often and trying other fruit.  Thank you for posting!!

Read a bunch of comments.  1 cup of sugar on  6 peaches, 1 cup of water.  Yup, thats the way to go all right.

This was a nice and easy recipe for a first  time cobbler maker and I love to see families hand down cherished recipes.  However, there is a clear dependency on sugar in the United States and this recipe is no acception.  I used unsweetened frozen peaches as good fresh ones are not always available.  I only used 3/4 cup sugar with cinnamon and heated them(only enough to defrost them) in a covered sauce pan together with 3 TBS water.  Again in the second step, I used 3/4 cup sugar and creamed with real butter, not the mystery shortening used which is actually worse for our bodies to consume as it's an unnatural food product(ask any reputable nutritionist).  Since the frozen peaches produce more liquid after being defrosted, I really only added less than a cup of water with the 3TBS butter in the last step.  Next time I will use even less sugar than this as it was extremely sweet.  Please do not ruin this recipe with canned peaches as they have mostly lost their nutrition in the canning process(properly research it), and added syrup is only inching yourself closer to poor health.  If your deserts have to be this sweet to enjoy them, consider slowly cutting back each time you make it and you'll find it tastes great without so much of it!

I used 6 small peaches 1 cup of sugar in the base. Ididn't have shortening so I used margarine. As suggested by others I used 1 cup boiling water. I like my peach cobbler a bit more soupy. Next time I'll use more water. I'll also use a slightly bigger pan. Excellent!

I have a very good easy peach cobbler recipe but wanted to try this one because addding the boiling water was interesting. I had 3 small cans of sliced peaches in heavy syrup, so that is what I used. I drained the peaches reserving enought to use in place of the water. So I used 1 cup of boiling heavy syrup in place of 2 cups of boiling water. I added the ground cinnamon to the syrup. I cut the sugar to one cup for the peaches but still used 1 cup for the flour/sugar mixture. I could have cut the sugar even further because it was Very sweet. I cooked it a 9 X 13 pan for at least 1 hour 15 minuted. It was pretty darn dark but not burned. It was really good but a little too sweet. The bottom of the cobbler was gooey, more like a peach pie filling and the bread part of the cobbler was nice and tender with a crunchy top. Everyone loved it!

This was my first attempt ever at a cobbler, and I have to say, it came out great. I did alter some per other reviewers suggestions. I cut the sugar in half for the filling and the dough. I used canned peaches, and they came out a little too soft, but there werent any good peaches available at the market. I used two 29 ounce cans, and one 14 ounce can. Alot of peaches. I strained them and then put the sugar cinnamon coating on after placing them in a bowl. By the time the dough was ready, I noticed quite a lot of liquid had accumulated from the peaches even after being strained, so I did not add any additional liquid to the top. This came out AMAZING!! This is the only cobbler recipe I would use from now on. I did use a 9x13 pan inplace of the 10x10. Perfect amount of moisture and the dough was absolutely perfect. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

It was yummy, loved the caramel flavored syrup it created.  My only complaint is that it was a little runny.  I think next time I'll try a little less water.

Success!  I made the same modifications others suggested.  (Doubled the peaches, used only 1 cup of sugar in them, and reserved the sweet liquid from the peaches to use over the top of everything instead of boiling water.)  I am not really into cobbler, but my husband seems to love it, so I'm sure I'll be making it again for him!

I only used one cup of water because I was kind of nervous about the boiling water pouring thing.  Maybe two cups makes it cook faster?  After 45 minutes I took it out and although the peaches were perfectly cooked the batter ended up being a little undercooked.  It was very tasty and easy though, great when you want to use fresh peaches.

Great recipe. I even flubbed it up and put it into too small of a pan and ended up pouring the whole thing into a bigger pan before baking and it still turned out great and pretty. One bummer...it didn't taste any different from when I have used canned peaches. That's a lot of extra work using fresh peaches when you can't tell the difference in the results. This is not a complaint about this particular recipe, just a general note about peaches. Next time I will save myself the trouble and just use canned peaches!

This was good as written, but I did not read the other reviews before making. I really wanted more peach flavor and it was very wet. So next time I will follow the other reviewers suggestions and I think it will come out perfect. I also want to try it with blueberries.

This recipe was delicious... The dough was actually flavorful and crisp. I added nutmeg and ginger for extra flavor and everyone in my house loved it. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the recipe does not call for enough peaches. I used large peaches and it still seemed like there was way more cake than fruit. I will try this one again but next time I will double the fruit.

At first I thought the pouring of water was strange...but this Northerner has found a new favorite cobbler recipe.  I thought the amount of sugar was perfect, but I did buy my peaches at the grocery store, and they may not have been naturally sweet.  I did have to cook a bit longer (15-20 minutes)...judge by the browning, not by the clock.  I can't wait to try this with blueberries.

What a yummy cobbler!  I used 12 peaches (I had a lot I needed to use) mixed with 1 cup sugar (instead of 1 1/2).  I cut the sugar in the batter to 3/4 cup and added vanilla.  Instead of two cups of water with the butter, I used one and it had plenty of moisture.  Baked for 1 hour 15 mins and then  and then let set for 30 mins before eating.  It was quite good--not too sweet either, which is just what I was looking for.  Thanks!

This is by far the most delicious peach cobbler I have ever tried, with a few modifications of course.  I have a big family so I doubled the recipe except the peaches.  I tripled those. I also substituted butter for the shortening and used just half the water.  YUMMY!

Oh, Wow.  Used fresh peaches, definitely can go with more, maybe double the number. Way sweet, cut back on sugar as others have said. Pouring water on top scared me, but it worked out and man, so so good!

This is pretty much what I think of when I think of cobbler.  I followed other's modifications including using 1)9x13 pan 2)one cup boiling water 3)more peaches and 4)less sugar on fruit.  The consistency and flavor are exactly what I was after.  Thanks Jan Recipes!

I've used this recipe for two summers now. I use fresh peaches from our tree and cook them for awhile with the sugar and cinnamon.  I use more than twice as many peaches, less sugar and only one cup of water per other reviews.  Delicious!!

I made two cobblers, one with fresh peaches and one with canned.  I used eight fresh peaches for the first one and around 1 ½ 29 oz. cans of peach halves in water for the second one.  However, since I felt that the dish was a bit lacking in its peach quantity, I would use 11 or 12 peaches or two 29 oz. cans of peach halves next time.  I also made the following changes for each cobbler: used 1 c. sugar and 2 t. cinnamon with the fruit, used 3/4 c. sugar and one t. vanilla with the batter, used 1 c. hot water with 4 T. butter, and baked in a 9x13 pan.  Good recipe!

Wow!  That's all I can say.  I did follow a couple other reviews by cutting the sugar in the peaches to 1 cup and using 7 peaches instead of 3.  I also cut the water to 1 cup and made it in a 9x13 pan.  Perfect.

Fantastic cobbler, I love how it is made "upside down".  The dough grows up around the fruit and it almost like a cakey biscuit. My husband is a cobbler snob and raved about this one.  I added blueberries and it was perfect.

The best Cobbler recipe  yet! I have been looking for a recipe that was doughy and finally found one! Don't skip the boiling water step, this really changes the texture to a "doughy" consistency...Wonderful! I didn't end up using the full amount of water, but I did use most of it...I also used double the peaches...

After years of looking for the perfect cobbler - it's so nice to have found it!  I was a little sceptical of pouring boiling water over the top - but it was perfect!  I used 8 peached and 9 x 13 dish - but apart from that - I can't imagine doing anything diffent.  A fabulous recipe!

YUMMY! I did reduce the water to 1 cup and it wasn't very 'liquidy' at all. Definitely needs more peaches though. Next time I'll add a couple more and see how that works.

This was the best cobbler i've ever eaten!  I did as others did and doubled the peaches and cut back on the sugar and it was perfect!!  I've made this for 3 different occasions and have gotten rave reviews.

This is a fantastic peach cobbler.  I took it to my women's group and everyone who tried it demanded the recipe!  I did use the variation suggested in other reviews (6 peaches/1 cup sugar/cut boiling water to 1 cup) and it was perfect.

Taste just like Old-Fashion peach cobbler. My whole family loved it. I will definitly make this again. Also, I'll try the base with different fruits as they come into season.

Great Recipe, but I did make a few changes. I lessened the amount of water used to between 1 1/4c and 1 1/2 c. I also used 3/4c white sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar to sweeten the peaches.

I followed other suggestions - used 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water. The peaches I used were so sweet that I think I'd use even less sugar next time, but overall a wonderful recipe. Really good served warm with vanilla ice cream!

I gave this 4 stars because of the changes that I had to make. I read all the reviews and therefore increased the peaches, decreased the sugar to 1c, and decreased the water to 1c. It turned out a really tasty cobbler. I would definitely make it again.

As written, this recipe came out absolutely soupy for me. I'm definitely going to try it again with about half the water, because the flavor was just so delicious. DH, MIL and I scarfed it down anyway! :)

Sadly, this recipe as written is a flop for me.  I wanted to love it.  It's far too sugary and the pan is too small and there are not enough peaches. 

If you decide to make it, seriously consider the other reviewer's suggestions.  I made it by the original recipe, even omitting half the sugar on the peaches, and it was just...syrupy.  The peaches I used were flavorful, but it got lost in the overpowering syrup.  I think modifications on this one are probably on the money.

Pretty good, though texture was a little "soggy".  I doubled the peaches and cinnamon - good move.  Cut the boiling water in half and upped butter to 4 Tbsps - also good move.  Replaced the sugar with stevia powder - not so good move.  I prefer stevia because of its much preferable health benefits, but because the taste is slightly different, the final product tasted a little...off.  I think if I made it again I would maybe use part sugar and part stevia.

Try adding a teaspoon of vanilla and dividing the sugar 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.. You will be amazed the difference it makes.

This was wonderful but I gave it 4 stars because it lacked the crunch I love in cobbler and it took much much longer to cook then it said.

I couldn't wait to try this recipe because of all the great reviews. Unfortunely,even with the changes from the above reviews, my cobbler still came out a very soupy!  The consistency of this recipe was way off.  Even tried longer cook time and that didn't work.

I have made this 3 times now!  I have made with fresh peaches and also with frozen peaches.  Today I made it with Granny Smith apples.  I make the crust gluten free substituting the flour with 1/2 c each of potato flour, rice flour and corn starch.  I also add a teaspoon of guar gum so that it will hold together better (since there is no gluten).  So far my family's favorite is the cobbler made with frozen peaches.  I didn't change the water amount at all and thought that the extra juice was great when served with vanilla ice cream.  All three times I have made this I have forgotten to put the butter in and it was still out of this world.  Highly recommended.  This one is starting to be a regular for our weekly family dinners.

First and most importantly, I made this gluten free.  I used the suggestions posted by other bakers(increased peaches by 3, 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar) then I used gf all purpose baking flour.  It turned out to be absolutely delicious.  I would recommend this to all celiacs!

WONDERFUL!!!  I made this for my family and they LOVED it.  The only thing I changed was the pan size.  I put it in a 8X8 glass dish and baked it for an hour and half and it came out perfect.

Sorry, but I can't give this recipe a good rating. Even with the changes from the above reviews, my cobbler still came out a soupy mess! Taste was good, but the consistency is all wrong. Practice this one first, so you can figure out your own changes before it's time for that family dinner!

What a soupy mess!! First, 3 peaches is way too few, I probably used 15 good sized peaches, too much sugar, didn't have flour on hand, used bisquick instead of.  Husband said ok, but me and my 7 year old who adores peaches hated it.

I followed other's suggestions about the sugar and the water (1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water), and I used 5 fresh Georgia Peaches. Turned out GREAT!  I would actually use 6 next time.  Also, this is a great recipe to use in your stonewear; it came out great in mine.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jannette!  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  It is heavenly.  I used a 9 X 13 pan, 8 average-sized peaches, and reduced both the sugar and boiling water to 1 cup.  I also baked it for 1 hour.  The baked batter turns out sooooo tender; I was temped to add some vanilla to it, but I'm glad I didn't because it doesn't need it.   My husband went nuts over this recipe.

Great recipe with the changes previously suggested (double the peaches, or more, really, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water to pour over with butter).  I made this in a 9 x 13 dish and it was great.  Actual baking time was more like an hour, but it set up just fine and smelled great.  Husband said it looked like a picture from a cookbook - tasted great.

This recipe turned out really bad for me.  The dough was thick and raw and tasted bad.  I won't be using this recipe again.  It's soooo hard to find a good cobbler recipe!

I thought this was going to be a disaster, but it turned out REALLY good! I used 2 cans of peach segments (they were a little mushy; I will try fresh next time) with one cup of sugar (next time I will use less. It was too sweet for our taste). After 15 mins in the oven, the mixture started bubbling over the edge of the dish, so I had to scoop a few spoons out. I didn't think it was ever going to set but it did - after about an hour or more! I ended up with a gorgeous caramely crust. I will modify it slightly next time, but it is definitely a keeper!

Yummy! This was the best peach cobbler! I did omit the water all together. I also used less butter. I will make this on a regular basis.

I think I underbaked this. Everyone else said it was excellent but I'm not completely satisfied with it. My Mom loves it so will try it again and bake longer.

Absolutely fabulous!  We picked fresh peaches at the orchard over the weekend and I made this for dessert on Sunday evening.  Everyone raved over it both with ice cream and without.  It was still good the next day too.

I did follow the modifications and used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup of water as opposed to 2.  Turned out perfectly.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I had a difficult time with this recipe.  I bought very large peaches - and although they looked beautiful, they were very mushy in texture.  When I put the sugar and cinnamon over the peaches, it generated a lot of juice.  Because of that, I only used 1 cup of water, and I only used a little of the juice that was in with the peaches. I baked the cobbler as directed, but had to bake it for 1 hour and 15 minutes to get it somewhat set.  I was afraid to cook it any longer for fear that it would be totally burnt on the bottom.  I have not tasted it yet.  I am bringing it to someone's house tonight for dinner -- thank goodness they are good friends and very forgiving.  If the cobbler tastes better than it looks, then I will try making it again with better peaches.

AFTER I made this, I read the reviews, so I was a little worried that'd be too sweet and too soupy.  It turned out great.  Mine wasn't soupy at all.  I used a 13x9 pan.  Maybe the extra space helped with the soupiness?  It wasn't too sweet either.  I used four peaches... I think next time, I might add more.  My mom and my brother ate it with milk.  They loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Well, this was my second attempt at this cobbler, and it still turned out like cobbler soup!
It ~tastes~ so delicious that I feel I must be doing something wrong.....I suppose I could've tried cutting the water to 1 cup?

Overall a great recipe.  I had never made cobbler before and this was very easy.  The first time I made it I didn't have enough room in the dish (used a pie dish) so I only added about half of the water.  It turned out perfectly.  The second time I made it I used all the water and it came out a bit soupy.  Next time I will only use half the water again, and maybe make a little more of the batter because it's so delish.  Like someone else suggested I used 2 bags of frozen, sliced peaches and they worked out well.

Hmmm...I'm not sure what happened here.  I am a avid baker and love to try new recipes.  The whole boiling water thing intrigued me!  However, the ending product was a big puddle of slop, granted it tasted great, but looked just like slop.  Perhaps my peaches were too juicy.  I did use a 9x9 dish, it boiled over BIG time, I also cooked it a lllloooonnnggg time...Oh well!

Thanks for this recipe. I'd never made a cobbler before and really didn't know what to expect. Our neighbors gave us peaches and I thought it was worth a try. This recipe was a hit with our family of 6! The kids couldn't get enough and don't even want to eat the peaches they once were begging for so there will be enough for another cobbler.  I'm off to do that now. :)  The only thing I did differently was to use more peaches, these were small and I just guessed at the amount ... I also used a 9x12 baking pan. We served it with whipped cream. Delicious.

It was great!!  I hadn't made a cobbler in a long time; and I loved the way the crust bubbled up from the bottom.  Very sweet - some might prefer a little less sugar - but YUMMY!

This cobbler was really good. I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of peaches to use. It turned out great, and it made a really big cobbler, but it won't last long around here. I will use this again...thanks Janette.

I love peach cobbler and I think I will use this recipe as a traditional summer holiday/cookout contribution.  Based on all the pictures submitted I would like to inquire what Breanne and Ms. Foote did to make their top look so smooth and appetizing. I hobnob with a lot of chiefs and people who are very picky and critical about food so I want to present my best.

Probably would have been better to use a 9x13in pan (the dough to peach ratio in the 10x10 is too much). Also glad I read about using only 1 cup of water and not two. May try again with the pan adjustment.

I followed this recipe to the tee and baked it what seemed forever and it came out soupy, and doughy in the center. It was sooooo golden brown that I had to cover it with foil after 20 minutes. This recipe was very disappointing to say the least.

Easy and delicious! We make extra to freeze in other tins when peaches are in season. Thaw and serve, if you can hide it from the family long enough!  My daughter's favorite dessert, hands down! Yum!

I'm not sure what went wrong. Even after cooling for over 90 minutes, I had peach cobbler soup. Tasted good, but was super runny. I was hesitant to pour the extra water and butter over before baking. If I try this again, I'll omit that step and see how we like it.

All had was a pan with a bunch of liquid, not even edible. I made a mess just trying to get the pan out of the oven as the water poured all over the place even after an hour of cooking time.

Super tasty.  I made a half recipe & cooked it in a glass loaf pan.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions & used less sugar with the peaches - only 1/4 cup for the half recipe.  I used some sliced peaches I froze a couple of weeks ago... I'm not sure how many there were.  Probably 2 or 3.  Also used half the water it calls for in the last step.  Will make again & again!

Yummy!  The only thing I changed was reducing the sugar in the filling to 3/4 cups.  Next time, I might reduce the sugar in the batter as well.

I tried doubling the recipe and cutting down the sugar. Do not try it. There was to much water and the base did not clear up, I think due to the lack of sugar. The taste was good. Next time I will fallow the recipe and try it again.

This didn't work. There was far to much liquid. I would recommend finding a recipe that doesn't require copious amounts of re-working to make it useable.

It took an hour longer to bake than the recipe called for.  It was good but the peaches sort of disappeared during that time.  I would put in more peaches and less boiling water on top.

This did not come out like I expected.  It never seemed to get done even though I cooked it longer that suggested.  Most of the crust ended up in the bottom of my stove.  I did use a few more peaches but I also used a larger pan so I don't think that was the problem.  It tasted OK, but I won't be making it again.

first time i've ever made cobbler and i think only the second time i've ever even eaten it.  i lean towards the crisps over the cobblers, but...this was really good!  i made 2 in just a couple of days b/c i used peaches from my tree and i've got an abundance.  the first batch was too much and overflowed my dish, so the second time i used a 9x13.  i used 5 peaches and 1 cup of boiling water per suggestions and left the rest the same.  not too sweet and i love the crunchy crust.  definately a keeper.

First, 11x9 pan was way too small, had to take out the batter and peach mixture when I saw 2 cups of water would overflow the pan.  That was messy.  I used a 9 x 13 instead.  I used about 7 peaches, as some were small. I used the full amount of sugar, which really worried me.  I wish I had read the reviews first.  Next time, I will do as others have suggested,and use 1 c. I did used the full 2 cups of water, and baked it about 1 hr 10 min.  I will used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon next time, too much. Will also cut the sugar in the batter to 2/3 C and see how that works. Otherwise, it turned out golden and beautiful.  Just too sweet and pan too small.

Wow!  This is wonderful!!!  I only made a few minor changes: I used 9 peaches, used a 9x13 pan, and reduced the boiling water to 1 cup.  I will definitely make this again!  The whole family loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

It was a GREAT cobbler. It was the first cobbler I made and it was very easy. There's only two changes I would make. I used peaches that came off of the tree in my yard and they were pretty small so I used 4 and they still weren't enough so use between 5 and 6. Also, it took about an hour to bake, not 45 minutes.

OMG!  This was so wierd!  I mean that in a good way.  Who would have thought that pouring water on these yummy ingredients would yield such a delicious finished product.    I used 12 white and yellow peaches (had to return to the kitchen garbage can to count the pits) 1 cup sugar with the peaches and 1 cup boiling water.  Cooked for 1 hr 10 mins.  Fantastic right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream!

I was looking for a quick, simple peach cobbler recipe. This was pretty good, but it needs more peaches - three is not enough. The top turned out nice and fluffy.

Made this in 13 x 11 pan, with 6 peaches using 1cup sugar in peach mixture and half the water (1cup); we tried it while still hot so was kind of soupy, was still pretty sweet too but the flavor was good. As it cools I expect the liquid will thicken. Rated this a 4 because of the revisions I made as recommended by the other reviewers.

This was really good!  Great way to use up our fresh & local peaches.  Was sort of like a pineapple upside-down cake.  Let the peaches sit in the sugar and a wonderful syrup resulted, which I added to the boiling water for the final step.  Will make again, maybe with apples.

First of all, do not use a springform pan for this recipe. It was a rookie mistake. As soon as I poured the boiling water over my peaches, it drained out the bottom of my pan and all over the counter! I tried to salvage my ingredients by re-spicing the peaches and scooping the batter into a regular pan, but I guess I wasn't successful. We felt like it was a lot of dough, and not many peaches, even though I used more than the recipe called for. In addition, the peaches got dried out from being on the top.

Great Recipe, So Easy! I was told this was one of the peach cobblers ever made. I did change a few things like others suggested: Only 1 Cup of Water, 6 Peaches (Also added Raspberries) and I added vanilla to the dough mixture, and used only 1 C Sugar. Will Make Again For Sure, Mu husband ate almost the whole pan by morning!

This was very good, however I would not used a 9x11 pan.  It was too thin.  I would use a pie pan for this recipe.  Also, I used whole wheat flour and was still very good.  You could taste a difference but I thought it was still very good.

This is seriously the best peach cobbler I've ever had. I followed other reviewers and cut down to 1 cup of sugar and 2 tsp of cinnamon on peaches. Also I added some vanilla to the batter and cut the water down to 1 cup that goes with the butter. I used very ripe peaches from a farmers market, was sooo delicious!

This cobbler tasted allright. It was just strange to me to have the dough on the bottom and the peaches on top. The dough ended up being very wet and mushy. I think I'll stick to cobblers with the cake on top!

5 stars with feedback from others such as use 1/2 the amount of sugar, and use more peaches.

I only had 2 peaches so I cut down the rest of the ingredients to ratio. I put the cobbler on vanilla bean ice cream and my husband said this was the best dessert of his life!

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I used 4 peaches instead of 3 and it actually probably could have even used some more.  It was one of the most delicious cobblers ever and it looks beautiful too.

Awesome!  Made the adjustments suggested by other reviewers - I used 9 peaches, but did not include all of the syrup that formed, 1-1/2 c sugar on the peaches, added some nutmeg, and cut the water to 1 cup with added vanilla.  FABULOUS.  Will make this again.  I served it at a family get-together with 'foodies' who scarfed it down and wanted more.  Two thumbs up!

I will have to cut the sugar in the peach mixture back the next time I make this recipe. It was a little too sweet. I did 1/2 the water - which was good advice from other cooks. I used frozen peaches - and they worked well.

I used about 5 fresh peaches in this recipe and that was plenty.  Instead of adding the water (which like others made me nervous) I sliced the peaches directly over a bowl and the juice from the peaches served as the "water".  I also did not add the butter since I was not using boiling water.  It turned out perfect!!!

I followed the ideas of others when making this recipe. One cup of sugar, 1 cup boiling water, vanilla.  It came out of the oven very soupy, but set up beautifully. Everyone loved it.

I made this after reading several reviews and decided to cut back on the sugar in both the fruit and in the batter as suggested.  I also cut the water back to 1 cup.  The only other thing I did was add the juice of half a lemon to the fruit to add a bit of tartness and to brighten it up.  It turned out excellent and my husband and I ate more than we should have.  Very nice recipe!

Okay, this recipe is highly over rated since it has to be changed to be good. That is why I gave it 2 stars. The changed product was good BUT it is very cake like. I prefer a pie like crust that is flaky. I dont know what the photo is above but it isnt this recipe. So, if you like cake and peaches that is called a cobbler add only 1 cup of sugar to 7 peaches and only 1 cup of water at the end. Vanilla is good too.

This is a recipe I will definitely use again to make dessert with the peaches from my backyard. I learned that peaches peel easily once boiled for 30 seconds or so. I also loved the suggestion to use both white and brown sugar. Yum!

Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!  I used canned peaches as I didn't have fresh, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Absoluletly delicious, and the cinnamon swirled throughout the crust was very pretty.

This recipe was absolutely scrumptious!  I don't even like peaches, but I made this because some peaches I bought for my daughter were getting ready to go 'bad'.  However, I had TWO helpings.  This woman's grandmother was an amazing cook....she should be proud.  This will now be a 'family' recipe for us!

I made this yesterday.  I used only one cup of sugar on the peaches and only 1 cup of boiling water and put it in the 9 x 13 pan after reading the reviews.  I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg and more peaches (frozen ones I had).  It was like really good-tasting peach soup when it came out of the oven after an hour, but I put it back in for about 20 minutes and then after it cooled down it was the most EXCELLENT peach cobbler I have ever had.  However, it was still a little too sweet for me, but boy was it good.  I'll definitely make it again.

Tastes great but follow the suggestions about reducing the sugar.  I used frozen peaches, turned out great.  It does take a long time to bake though, so plan accordingly.

This recipes is so adaptable. I've made it several time, never the same way twice. Use peaches, or apples, or any fruit combination, 4-6 pieces. I'm going to try pineapple next. You can add nuts, raisins, or dates. I use 1/2 Cup honey in the fruit mixture, add cinnamon and vanilla. And 3/4 C sugar in the dough mixture. Stain off the juice from the fruit after marinating for a few hours in the fridge. Heat a cup of the juice instead of water to pour over the top for extra flavor. Great, great recipe you can play with!

YUMMMMM!!!  This was extremely good.  I did follow some suggestions.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan. I used about 6 fresh peaches and only 1 cup of sugar.  It was plenty sweet.  I might use only 3/4 cup of sugar next time.  I also only used 1 c of boiling water and I think if I had used 2 cups it would of overflowed.  It was definitely a keeper and sooo yummy!  I think I will try it with canned peaches next time b/c I don't usually have fresh peaches on hand and it will be faster to make it. **I made it with canned peaches.  I think it may need the extra sugar with the canned peaches b/c they are not as sweet as fresh really ripe peaches.  I used 2 29oz cans of peaches.  It is definitely better with ripe fresh peaches.

I followed the adjustment suggested by other reviewers and this turned out wonderfully. I doubled the peaches and cinnamon, used only 1 cup sugar, added a teaspoon of vanilla, used a 9x13 pan and baked it for an hour.  I also did not have shortening so I substituted margarine and eliminated the salt.  The butter with boiling water sounded weird, but it worked.  The first time I made this we took it to a church picnic and neither my husband or I got to taste it because it disappeared so fast.  It was the only dessert that the dish was scrapped clean (even the brownies had leftovers).  We invited company over specifically so I could make it again and we could try it ourselves.

This was absolutely delicious; I made it twice in one week.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated although I did not have a 10x10 pan--a 9x13 worked well.  The second time I made it was to take to a neighbor, and it was enjoyed by everyone!!!  Will make again for sure.

Easy to prepare. Delicious to eat.  My family loved this peach cobbler.  I did add extra peaches and reduced the water.  It came out perfect!

This recipe is fantastic!!!  I made it tonight with fresh peaches from a local orchard and couldn't keep the hubby and the rest of the firefighters on his shift away from it.  Just knowing it's in the fridge makes me want to have more!  The peaches came out perfect and the batter was moist and sweet. It was SO simple and yielded such delicious results!  I followed other recommendations and used the vanilla in the batter, 6 large peaches, and only 1 cup of water before baking (that seemed like MORE than enough); and everything was perfect.  Definitely a new favourite!

It tasted great, but I had to use a stainer to get the peaches out.  I used only one cup of boiling water on top.  In the end, it was soup.  The peaches were floating.  If I were to make this again, I would omit the water on top.

Excellent.  My family has been begging for it ever since it evaporated that first night.
Use the suggested changes from others. I did and it was perfect!

I made it and I wasn't as thrilled as some of the other reviewers. I altered per reviews, brown sugar, more butter, less water. The mixture is more dense than it should be. Very cake like. I also added more peaches (all fresh) and you really couldn't tell if it were an apple or peach. It's not bad, but it's not what I had expected.

This was really good.  Really sweet, but good.  I changed some stuff though.  I used brown sugar instead of white and used 5 peaches insted of 3.  And by accident I omitted the last part with the boiling water and sugar or whatever it was that was supposed to go on last.  It was plenty sweet without it.

This was my first time trying a cobbler but I think it needs a few alterations.  Less sugar, more peaches, and less boiling water I think would have helped.  But still, very good, esp ala mode.

Although this had great flavor, it was far to runny and didn't resemble cobbler. I even followed other reviewers advice and cut the amount of water down. It was more like a tasty peach soup than cobbler. I definitely won't be making this again.

What a delicious recipe! I took people's advice and doubled the peaches and cut back on the sugar, and I am glad I did. I think next time I may add even more peaches, as I found it was still not quite enough. I put 1 cup of sugar with the peaches and 1 cup with the batter, and that seemed just right. Very delicious!! I think this will be my staple peach cobbler recipe from now on.

I made this in a 9x13 pan, so I added an extra peach to the recipe. It turned out so well, my husband has mentioned several times that he'd not mind if I made it again. I used white peaches but would prefer the fuller flavor of regular peaches next time. Also I added a pinch of nutmeg and cut back slightly on the cinnamon. Rich and buttery and very easy to make. This is my new favorite cobbler recipe!

Still trying to figure this one out.  Used a regular cake pan instead of the small one.  I would prefer to double the number of peaches (depending on size) because I like a fruitier dish.  One cup of water didn't seem to be enough - next time I'll try a little more.

This is an easy, yet good recipe. However, I did cut the water by half, as well as the sugar. The sugar still could be less, and still taste great.

I made some of the suggested changes, added vanilla to batter, used 1 cup water, used 6 peaches, and a bigger dish.  It turned out great!!! I may not use as much sugar on the peaches next time, but that depends on the flavor of the peaches.  I will definitely make this again!

I was afraid this would come out soupy but it didn't...just a little soggy on the bottom. I used an 8x8 pan and so cut back the amount of water to a little less than 1 C. If I make it again, I would cut back the sugar even more...1 C is still too much! Easy to make.

I did not read the reviews before making this but ended up lessening the sugar to about 1 c. (just visually seemed like to much) and the water to about a cup (couldnt fit any more in the 7x11 pan!  Can't understand any of the negative reviews on this one, because it was DELISH!

I saw the ingredients and thought this one looked good.  The directions I thought were a bit odd (pouring 2 c. boiling water with butter on top of the good looking dish), but after it came out of the oven I was very impressed.  It looked and smelled really good.  My husband who isn't a peach cobbler fan said that he loved it and wants me to make it again sometime.  My guests loved it too!

I have made this 3 times now and think it's great! I only gave it 4* because I feel like there is a little something missing. The last time I made it I added a tsp. of vanilla to the batter and sprinkled just a bit of brown sugar on top of the peaches. I think this made it even better :)

Not sure if it was the shortening I used (is it not all the same) but the cobbler came out white colored and plastic tasting. We just fished out the peaches and put them over ice cream and THAT tasted delicious.

I didn't have any cinnamon, I used only 1 cup of sugar and only 1 cup of water.  It came out pretty good.  I like that fact that it wasn't too sweet.  I could taste the peaches.  It was good, light and I'll probably make it again.

This didn't turn out too bad, just okay.  I always thoughts that cobblers were supposed to have a flaky crust.  This was more like eating  peach cake.  I felt that that batter was a little too floury for my taste.  I took everyone's advice and cut back on the sugar and water.  Flavor of the peaches was good, appearance and texture of the cobbler good.  I just didn't like the cakiness.

Followed recipe exactly! Just kept waiting. Took 1 1/2 hours to go from soup to cobbler. Too much sugar too! Glad I tried it before serving to guests.  I would not do this again.  Surprised at star rating.

Not good. Put just 1/2cup of water instead of 2cups, after 70 minutes I took it out and it was soup.

Unfortunately this recipe did not work for me. I followed the recipe exactly and it took over two hours to cook all the way through. It was too runny and far, far, far too sweet. Very disappointing :-( We have given it to the chickens.

This recipe was so good it hardly lasted a day at my house! I tried to make it in a 9x13 pan and just increased the peaches but it still wasn't quite thick enough. Next time I will probably use about 8 peaches and fiddle around with the crust mixture to make it thicker. I think the sugar and cinnamon amounts could be left the same.

Very good cobbler!  I used a 9 x 13 pan, a couple extra peaches, one cup of sugar on them and omitted the water like the other reviewers suggested.  I melted the 3 tbsp. of butter and poured it over the cobbler before I baked it.  It turned out perfect!  I'll definitely use this one again.

EXCELLENT COBBLER!  I believe that cobblers should have some thickened liquid in them, and this one is perfect.  As recommended, I did reduce the sugar mixed with peaches to 1 cup.  I used one standard bag of frozen peaches, which I did not thaw, and I added 5 minutes to the cooking time.  This fit perfectly in a 9 x 13 baking dish.

I am vegan, so I used vanilla soymilk (SILK) and Earth Balance margarine (for butter and for shortening).

This was a fairly easy recipe and had a really good flavor. I used 5 very ripe fresh peaches and also cut down the sugar to one cup and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  I did not add the boiling water or butter to my reciupe and did not miss it at all.  Next time I think I am going to add some brown sugar to the batter as well, I think it could be a touch sweeter.

Quite good, but not fantastic. I used fresh white peaches and fresh mango for the topping, and it was yummy! I only needed 1/3 c. of sugar for the topping, and it was plenty sweet (mango & peaches were both really sweet and juicy). I only used 1 c. of boiling water (all my pan would hold), and I still found it a bit mushy. I cooked it fo a long time but it had a custard-like consistency on the bottom. Anyway, it tasted absolutely fantastic!!

I should have read the reviews before I baked! It tastes really great, but mine was soupy. The liquid never settled or cooked off, and this made the cake soggy. My husband wouldn't let me toss it out, though, because it tasted so good. I may try it again (with less water), but I think I'm really looking for a more crumbley and less cakey recipe.

Delicious! I received rave reviews. I've made it twice - once with just peaches and once with peaches and mixed fresh berries. Each time I increased the amount of fruit and decreased the amount of sugar I mixed with them. I then also decreased the water. Served it hot with ice cream!

This is delicious!   I used 5 peaches (and could use more), 1 1/2 cups sugar, and used only 1 cup boiling water.  I baked it in a 11x11 casserole dish with good results.  Thanks!!

I don't have a 10x10 pan, so I doubled the recipie and used a 9x13 pan.  I did not use all of the doughy mixture, but I did use all of the peach mixture.  I only added about 1 cup of water because my pan was full already.  This turned out better than I expected it to. I am inclined to agree however that it was a bit too sweet. If you reduce the amount of sugar added to the peaches, I bet it would be great.  So easy also...I have never made a cobbler before.

This is a great recipe. I added more peaches and also added a handful of blackberries. I cut way back on the sugar. Instead of 1 1/2 cups I added 1 and instead of the 1 c. I added about 1/2. It was a big hit at the 4th of July party and no leftovers. It's a keeper!

Interesting recipe.  Hard to adjust to high altitude instructions though.  Had to cook for over an hour at 375 to get the middle set and batter crusty.  Makes a good amount but I added extra peaches and some blackberries, which made the cobbler somewhat bitter.

I made this the first time to the recipe and really loved the taste and ease. However I was using fresh Michigan peaches and they are so juicy it probably had too much liquid in it. Did not quite cook fully. So made a second batch cutting the water a little bit and reducing both the cinnamon to half a teaspoon and removing a half cup of sugar. Also used four peaches.  Turned out excellent. Just made my third batch last night and enjoying it. On this one I put a few sprinkles of nutmeg on the peaches again with lower water and sugar. This will be my go to recipe and I look forward to trying it with blueberries and apples later. Thanks for sharing it Jan.

Three stars as written. Two cups of water was too much. I'm glad I tried this recipe again with the following changes: Reduce water to 1 cup. Add sugar to the peaches a little at a time and check the sweetness. If the fruit is already very sweet, adding a full 1 1/2 cups of sugar may make the mixture too sweet.  Bake in a 9x13 baking dish. These changes make it 4 stars (5 stars on the rare occasion when I use Butter Flavored shortening!)

Loved it!  Like a German kuchen.  I lowered the sugar in both the peaches and the crust.  I used 6 peaches (double). Only used 1 cup of water as my peaches were super juicy.  Put a cookie sheet under your baking dish too.

I have been making this cobbler for years & it is the bomb! If you follow the original recipe using 3 peaches it comes out perfect. If you add additional peaches you must cut down on the water as other reviews have done. Cutting down on sugar will not effect the recipe either way but the water is the key.

The flavor was good, however, the bottom of the pan was soaking in liquid.  Not sure I would make again unless the filling could be altered to be thicker and less runny.

Reduced the sugar by 3/4 cup, the water to 1 cup, used 4 peaches and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Baked in a 9x13 pan. It was absolutely delicious!! I will reduce the sugar a bit more next time as it was still very sweet, but this is a great recipe!

Big adjustments, but very good once altered. I made the recipe for 12 servings, and only put in like 1-1 1/2 cps of boiling water--which was still waay too much. After I cooked it the 45 mins, I could tell it wasn't set in the middle. So I put aluminum foil on the done parts and put it in for another 10 mins. (350 deg still). I then tried some and I noticed there was still a lot of liquid under the cakey part. So I carefully drained it. Put aluminum foil over the done parts again, and stuck in in for another 10 mins. THEN it was good. I would say in future productions, I will use the juice from the peaches and a about 1/2 cup of water. I think that will be plenty. Very tasty once finally done. Just a pain in the neck!

Zero stars!!!! This recipe was the most unmitigated disaster I have ever made.  Usually I can make any recipe turn out with minimal trouble. First, be warned that substituting frozen peaches will be problematic at best. I anticipated a longer cooking time... at double the cooking time the top was browned and crispy and the fruit was bubbly hot. However, the product was soupy, and though boiling the bread was less than a quarter inch thick over a watery base. The fruit was sickly sweet using only one cup of sugar. I used half the water called for... it was still way too much. Fruit never thickened in the slightest. Perhaps from the extended cooking the flour starch broke down. I also tried the tin foil recommended. took it off after an hour because it was steaming the bread.

I have been making cobbler off of this recipe since 2008 and it has turned out great each time even with adjustments to the amount of sugar. I have reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup over the peaches and 1/2 cup in the dough mixture. I also use a 9"x13" pan for more portions to share. Still sweet and delicious but with fewer calories!

Good base but  changes made:  7-8  peaches (enough to pack a 9x13 pan), only 1 cup sugar if peaches really sweet, added 1tsp almond extract to milk, and reduced water to 1 cup.  Everything else the same.  Next time I'd like to try creaming with butter instead of shortening for more flavor.

Family of picky boys and I was the hero with this recipe. I followed the directions and it turned out great.  This was the first time I have made cobbler - it won't be the last!

I made this in an oval shaped pan. It made it too thick, so it ran over the sides and took way longer than 45 min. Next time I will use a 9x13 inch baking dish. I used 4 large peaches, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly the way it was written except I only had 1 tbs. of butter. This was soooooo incredibly delicous!!!!! I wouldn't change a thing!! (Only the pan size...) However I must warn you it is quite sweet, but that's just the my family likes it! :P Thanks Jan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My boyfriend LOVES peaches, so I surprised him with this dessert after a home-cooked meal with friends. He had two helpings, and by the end of the meal, it was completely gone! I did make one adjustment. I used four peaches instead of three. I would actually use five if they're large, six if not. Otherwise, a WONDERFUL cobbler recipe.

Having never made peach cobbler before I wasn't sure what to expect. This was AMAZING! I had to borrow some sugar from my neighbor so I took her a piece and she loved it! The kids love it, the husband loves it and I really enjoyed it too. The only thing I might do next time is lower the sugar even further. Maybe 3/4 of a cup over the peaches. I only had 5 but they were larger so they worked really well. Excellent and will make again, probably tomorrow! **Note** I ended up using this recipe because the author said it was her grandmother's recipe. So far I can truly say Grandma's recipes are the best!

Other than using 6 fresh peaches, I prepared the recipe as written. It turned out fine, but I found the taste rather lackluster and bland. I won't be making again. Thanks anyway.

Easier than my mom's recipe and just as good! I'm trying it with blueberries tonight. We didn't have shortening so we used Nutiva organic coconut oil which is like shortening at room temp. I also doubled the peaches and added nutmeg. Turned out great!

I made this without any changes. It was very good, but a little "soupie" in the middle and it was VERY sweet. I'm going to try this again with less sugar and water like the other reviewers noted.

This recipe is good, other than the sauce turned into more of a pudding than a sauce. Flavor was great, texture was a bit to be desired.

After reading all the reviews for hints on making this perfectly, I ended up making two of these at once; one peach one blueberry/raspberry.  This is more like a bread pudding than a cobbler, but is very delicious nonentheless.  For the peach dish, I used 4 peaches because that's what I had to use up.  It was a very good amount; not too many, not too few.  I used just one cup of sugar and it was too sweet, but it made the peaches become very juicy, so only added 1/3 C boiling water and really didn't need to use any.  It had to bake an extra 15 minutes in attempt to evaporate all the liquid. Next time I will not use any water, just dot with butter.

For the berry dish, I used frozen rasp and fresh bluebs.  Added only 1/2 C. boiling water and it ended up being perfect, even though it did require baking an extra 20 minutes.  I used 1 C of sugar which was perfect because of the tartness of the berries.

Very good and easy, I will definitely make again.

WONDERFUL!  This cobbler has that old-fashioned taste that our grandmothers would rave about.  It was easy to make and gone within seconds.  I used a 13x9 pan for a larger serving size.  A must try!

I used fresh peaches I'd already soaked in sugar intending to make jam (about 6 cups of peachy goo), and doubled the "cobbler" recipe. I also used half the oil and buttermilk instead of plain milk. It's wonderful, if perhaps a tad bit too much topping.

It turned out nearly perfect.  I actually might have liked a little more sugar in it so next time I'll add a bit more, but otherwise it is great.  My kids are gobbling it up as we speak!

This peach cobbler is EXCELLENT!!! The only problem I had was that it was so watery. I used a little less that a cup (as other reviewers recommended), but it was still really runny. I only had an 8x8 pan, so perhaps that's why. I'll try again with a 1/2 c instead. Flavor, crust, etc. is awesome.

I just started liking peaches once I moved to Turkey.  So I thought I would try this recipe. I did what others did I added peaches and lessened the water to 1 cup. Kids and husband loved it. The only reason I had left overs is that I wanted some left for tomorrows desert.

This recipe has a good flavor but the consistency is very runny. I only used 1-1/2 Cups of water and it still was much to loose. I will try this again but will have to make some changes.

Okay the last review stated that this was awful. I will not go that far. It had a wonderful taste and we will eat it but it is very mushy like a thick soup. I think the taste is good enough to try with a few of the suggested changes about the water and maybe the sugar, although I didn't think it was to sweet (but I love sweet stuff). I will probably use this again with a few changes.

This was awful.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out of the oven like mushy soup.  What a waste of delicious fresh peaches!  (Wish I'd read the reviews prior to preparing this dish)  How can this recipe be rated so highly if so many alterations must be made?  Too bad, my family was so looking forward to a delicious dessert.

I went to the "famous" Gilbert South Carolina peach festival and had to do something with all the peaches I came home with. This recipe is the greatest! I cut back to 1 cup sugar on the peaches and only used 1 cup of water and baked 45 minutes. It is perfection, my friends think I am a culinary wiz!

I thought this was exceptionally good, although i still like my Granny's recipe with canned peaches better.  I did cut the sugar back to 1 cup and the water to 1 cup.  I found, though, that 2 cups of water would have been great.  This was kind of a cakey filling and i like it super moist.  Everyones preference is different.  Will make again because i always have fresh peaches to use up in the summer.

Me my wife and my son picked fresh blackberries today and I made the cobbler with that. It was awsome!!!! I made it exactly as it reads and the only thing I would change is the amount of water. You would be alright with 3/4 to 1 cup of water. It came out of the oven kinda soupy but firmed up a little bit in the cooling. We all loved it and I will be making it again soon. YUMMY!!!

This is such a WONDERFUL recipe, even if it came out all soup like. I didn't have fresh peaches, so I altered the recipe. I used 2 cans of peaches. I drained the peaches and used a fork to put them into another bowl, but the end product still turned it into a peach soup cobbler. I don't know if it was the canned peaches, or just the water that the recipe calls for. it was still GOOOOOOD tho. It tells you to add 2 cups of water, I used like 3/4 cups. Next time, I'm still going to use canned peaches, I'm lazy.. shortcuts =), and i'm not going to add any water. If it still comes out soupy, then I'll start using fresh peaches. I also added a bit more cinnamon, and topped it with vanilla icecream. My family looked at the cobbler like it was a failure... hence the soup quality, but man, one bite and they all came back for more....

I gave this recipe 5 stars, because after cutting back the water to 1 cup, adding a little less sugar, and adding a few more peaches, it was the absolute best peach cobbler I've had in a long time, at least since my grandma made it :)

Pretty good. I used a combination of peaches and strawberries. I would probably make this again with different fruit.

Not too cakey..not too buttery..just right.  I cut the quantity by half for the fruit filling.  Full amount would have been too sweet.

This was my first time making a peach cobbler, my dad took it to work and shared with his coworkers. They sent a thank you note with rave reviews. They, and my family loved it. The 2 cups of boiling water seemed strange but it worked.

First time making peach cobbler and it turned out wonderful and was simple to make.  I thought it was very sweet, but with the right amount of peaches (I used 2 bags of frozen sliced peaches) the sweetness combined with the tartness (peaches) is perfect.  Wonderful bubbly crust. Took a little longer to bake for me.  Thanks!
