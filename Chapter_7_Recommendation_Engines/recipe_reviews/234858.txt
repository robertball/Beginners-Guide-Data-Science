This was a crown pleaser. I altered the recipe a bit. I cooked pecans brown sugar, and added  butter  on the stove, stirring constantly until smooth.  I removed and added Kaluah and a tsp of vanilla. I removed the top layer of the Brie, Placed pecan mix on tap and wrapped it in pie crust. Brushed the  crust with egg whit, placed whole pecans on top and baked 25 minutes...yummy, like a praline melted on top of Brie!!

Too sweet for my taste and I cut the brown sugar down to 2 TBLS. I’ll make it again with less sugar and give it another try. Presentation was great.

It’s so simple to make and yummy. It is my go to dish to bring for any occasion. I do add a little extra granulated sugar for a sweeter taste. I also cut off the top of the Brie and then put the nut mixture right on the cheese.

This was very good.  It was also incredibly messy and sticky.

My go to appetizer. I serve it with ginger snaps which makes for an interesting combination.

I could only find 8 oz brie rounds so I adjusted the recipe accordingly and followed it as written. It was delicious served with crackers.

Very easy and very yummy. I did not have a wheel of Bri, so I used a wedge. It was a little messy since the Bri spread on the plate, but it was still delicious!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I have had it on a recipe card for years and am delighted to find the same exact recipe here. This is a knock-out hit at parties.  I always hope to bring some home, but that never happens!  I've gone to doubling it so there will be some left--and usually they eat all the double recipe!
