This is my pancake recipe now.  However, I do not use butter.  I substitute 1/4c canola oil (or sometimes unsweetened applesauce.  If I double, I use 1/4c each).  I also use 1 egg and 2 egg whites instead of 3 eggs.  Since I don't usually have buttermilk, I use soured milk (add tbs lemon juice or vinegar to your milk).  I gradually add the liquid until the batter is the right consistency since it tends to be thin.  I throw in a tbs or two of ground flax seed for a little added nutrition.  I usually double this recipe and freeze the extras.  They warm up great in the toaster.  They're also great if you add blueberries.

I used the lemon juice/1% milk substitution for buttermilk (1 tablespoon lemon juice for each cup of milk). I also substituted cinnamon applesauce for butter. When I was a kid, I preferred thin pancakes, but these raise high and were also delicious. The recipe provides a somewhat healthy way to indulge.  Great stuff.

Jen, thanks for the great recipe!  The pancakes turned out fluffy and light just as advertised!

I didn't measure any of the ingredients directly (I ususlly go by 'feel' when cooking).  Because of this I wasn't too concerned about the fact that baking soda was missing from the ingredients list, but was called for in the body of the recipe... If you want to make this recipe and you are going to use buttermilk do not forget to use the baking soda! I think I put about a 3/4" of a teaspoon in.  

I also didn't have any buttermilk, but I found that if you put about 2tsp of regular vinegar in whole or 2% milk it will cause the milk to curdle slightly and will closely resemble buttermilk.  (By the way, you can't even begin to taste the vinegar in the final pancakes after baking.)

I've added this recipe to my box and will now make it my mainstay for making pancakes!

Tasty!  These pancakes are so good.  My very picky two year old didn't even realize they weren't the usual white pancakes.  She devoured them.  They actually tasted better than white flour pancakes.  I did use quick cooking oats instead of wheat germ.

I made these pancakes for Easter breakfast and everyone loved them! My father-in-law could not stop eating them. I did change the recipe a little....gound up in my coffee grinder, a little flaxseed, wheat bulgar and wheat germ and used it in place of the white flour and then through in a small handfull of the whole flaxseed and bulgar for a little crunch. I also went light on the buttermilk, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla..... best pancakes I have ever had....and by the way, froze the leftovers and popped them in the toaster...came our great!

I found out that if you use a pastry brush to brush oil onto the pan in the shape of any alphabet, the impression gets onto the pancake when done. Amazing !The recipe is great eventhough i made a few alterations like using whole wheat flour,baking powder, salt in the ratio of 2 cups: 1 tablespoon : 1teaspoon, & lesser sugar.I used the butter milk but avoided the butter in the batter.

I made these for my husband's birthday yesterday and they turned out great.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1/2 vanilla yoghurt and 1/2 skim milk (healthier that way too).  I added blueberries to some pancakes, chocolate chips to some and nothing to the others and they were all yummy!  I was a little concerned though about the amount of butter.  I think next time I'll try to cut down the butter and sub some applesauce instead.

Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best! My 3yr old is a pancake freak, so I made these for a healthy breakfast and she loves them. I cut out or haf the butter and I never have buttermilk, so I just add 1% milk and it turns out fine. I also added oats last time. Love them.

I make these all the time now, and will not go back to pancakes mad with white processed flour. My kids (2 and 4) also love these. They are also good served with fresh sliced strawberries. I will try blueberries in them next. I've also used light buttermilk, and half buttermilk / half 1%, which also worked out great...they're a tad lighter.

This was the first time I made pancakes from scratch (I always use the boxed Bisquick powder). I wanted to try a recipe that tasted more like restaurant pancakes. The batter is quite thick and I found they were harder to flip being so heavy.  All of the butter made them greasier than I like but the butter flavor was very good.  I sprayed my griddle with cooking spray knowing these already had so much butter.  I followed the recipe exactly although my son wanted chocolate chips in his and I used white whole wheat flour.  My son wasn't crazy about these at all.  I liked the flavor but they were just too greasy and dense.  I do think these could be great with some changes though.  I am going to experiment with canola oil and applesauce next time and just put a little butter on top of the finished pancake for flavor.  I will also substitute some of the buttermilk for skim milk and see if this helps.  If you want a very filling pancake these will really stick by you and I love the use of whole wheat flour and wheat germ.

I rarely give anything 5 stars, but I have to say this was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, which is rare. I even had unsalted butter! I ate 3 of them, which is even more rare. They were so thick going on my griddle, I thought I must've done something wrong, but I pushed them down a bit and they were so light and fluffy, probably 3/4" thick! Yummy in my tummy!

Great pancakes!!!  I was unprepared this morning with no milk for cereal.  I pulled up this receipe and used a two full cups of whole wheat flour, omitted the white flour, wheat germ, salt, and butter.  I also used one cup of water instead of milk.  Wonderful pancakes!!!  :)

I used whole wheat white instead of whole wheat and all organic ingredients where I could. I made a double recipe so there'd be a batch leftover that I could stick in the freezer and reheat another morning. My three boys inhaled a good portion of these. Very good! I was bummed they turned out so flat, but the flavor was good, so it's really not an issue. NOTE: I didn't need the extra butter as I cooked these on my non-stick griddle.

Yum!! Added one tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla extract.  Also, did not use the entire amount of liquid, even at high altitude where we usually need a little extra. Great recipe for a healthier pancake!

This recipe was great for a cool morning! I did not have buttermilk handy and really didn't want the fat that comes along with buttermilk so I used skim milk for a lower fat option.  I also added pumpkin butter to the batter to give it more of a fall flavor.    Pancakes are fluffy and delish!  Next time I will probably add some pumkin pie spice to kick it up.  the pumpkin flavor was a little too subtle for me.

I turned this into a super vegetarian recipe:  - replaced butter with coconut oil. less than 5 tbsp. too much coconut oil will make the pancake too coconut-y. But it's very delicious alternative if you like coconut flavor.  - used dark brown sugar. - instead of 2 eggs, i used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. It turned out great! Very nutritious and delicious at the same time.

These are the best whole wheat pancakes my husband and I have ever had.  My husband doesn't necessarily like whole wheat pancakes; but we are trying to eat healthier.  He just raved about these pancakes.

I doubled the recipe and just used four cups of whole wheat flour, no white (I was out of wheat germ so just made up the difference with whole wheat flour).  The only other change I made was to use sucanat instead of brown sugar, and sour milk instead of buttermilk, since that's what I had.  My first bite was gross, but I quickly realized I'd forgotten the salt.  Oops.  I added it to the rest of the batter, and these were definitely some of the best whole wheat pancakes ever.  Very tender, delicious with butter and maple syrup.  You won't even miss the white flour if you skip it.

These are great pancakes!  I made minimal adjustments by doing the oatmeal instead of wheat germ (I ground the oatmeal with a magic bullet) and I did canola oil and applesauce instead of the butter.  I also did milk and vinegar instead of buttermilk.  Like others mentioned the batter is way too thin and runny if you use all of the buttermilk.  I added slowly and did not finish the 2.5 cups and still had my batter too thin so I had to add more wheat flour just to bring it close to normal thickness.  Next time (and there will be a next time for these) I will be even more conservative with the buttermilk addition.  But overall these have a good flavor and are very moist!

These pancakes are scrumptious! For whole grain, they are so light and fluffy. I use all whole wheat flour because I was out of white the first time I made them. I also add a dash of vanilla and some chopped walnuts to the batter. These are my favorite pankcakes to make for my family. All my kids love them with butter and real maple syrup. I  make extra and heat them up in the morning for those days on the go! Good and good for you!

I just made these pancakes for several members of my family.  My notoriously finicky mother said they were the best she'd had.  Everybody loved them.  They're a bit more complicated to make than most pancake recipes I've tried, but easily well worth the extra effort.  Thank you for sharing this.

This recipe is excellent. I made it as written except for a couple things: I used vegetable oil (a little over 1/4 cup) because I didn't feel like fussing with butter, and I soured regular milk with vinegar since I don't tend to keep buttermilk around. I only ended up using 1 1/2 cups of the soured milk, so add it a little at a time. I also used 1/3 cup regular oats (quick spin in the blender to make into a flour) instead of wheat germ. The pancakes were fluffy, delicious, and extra filling. I ended up with about 16 medium-small pancakes and froze a bunch for later.

Oh my goodness, this recipe is actually the best I've ever tasted! I genuinely liked the flavor of the pancakes better than when I use a normal recipe.  I live at about 6000 ft, so I left out the baking soda, and I didn't have buttermilk, so just used regular 2%, and these were still perfect- nutty, fluffy, and definitely making me happy with the more nutritional ingredients.  Added 1/2 cup fresh blueberries and 1/2 cup fresh chopped walnuts to the batter, and my husband and I were in breakfast heaven for three days.  The leftover batter even kept really well to the last day.  These are going to be a mainstay in our house.  Thanks for the great recipe!

They were delicious! My toddler who doesn't like pancakes loved these!This is the first time I made them.  I followed the reviews and added 2 tsp of vinegar to my milk since I didn't have buttermilk.  I had a little faith on this one so in the first step I made two batches of the dry flour and put one of them in a ziploc bag in the fridge, so next time I'll just add butter, eggs and buttermilk. I might also cut the amount of butter in half and add applesauce.

Delicious!  I made this recipe with the kids so the amounts were not exact (that was about 3/4 cup, go ahead and add another 1/4 cup....too much!  Now take out about 2 tablespoons) and they were still amazing.  I honestly could not taste the wheat flour and wheat germ and the kids devoured them.

Loved these pancakes!!!  I didn't add the butter into the batter, and just used a little more buttermilk instead.  I also just used a non-stick griddle, so I didn't use the butter to grease the pan either.  Added a few blueberries to a few, and they were even better.  Definitely a keeper pancake recipe in this house.  Easy and delicious!

These pancakes were so yummy!!!  I didn't have butter milk or brown sugar, so I used unsweetened soy milk and raw sugar. My husband loved them. We topped them with a touch of honey!! Great weekend breakfast

These are light and tender and very tasty.  I usually cut down on the milk because I have trouble flipping them when they are runnier but they are better when you stick to the recipe.

Ummm, I'm never buying Pancake mix ever again! It was a super rainy day, (the effects of Hurricane Ike) & I could not get out to the store, & was out of pancake mix, so I used this recipe-didn't have buttermilk, wheat germ or butter(I was out of EVERYTHING!!!) so I subbed Quick cooking outs for wheat germ, canola oil for butter, & made my own "buttermilk" using 1% milk & white vinegar.(1 TBSP per 1 cup milk, let stand 10 minutes) They are awesome! And turn out way sturdier than store bought  Whole Wheat pancake mix ! Definately will be using this again & again!!!

Very thick and fluffy! I used half apple sauce & half canola oil to fill 1/4 cup instead of butter, oats instead of wheat germ, and soy milk instead of buttermilk. Added a few tbsp of flax seed. Amazing with blueberry sauce!

These were great!  I used oatmeal, and the texture was fabulous!  They taste almost better than the recipe my dad uses (don't tell him I said that).  The only thing is that it needs a little bit more flour to be a good batter.  Other than that, they were wonderful!

These pancakes were really very tasty.  They cooked up nicely - everyone enjoyed them.

My batch made 18 pancakes using a 1/4 cup to measure them out when I cooked them.  Just to give everyone an idea of how much you can expect to make.

Loved this recipe!  I threw everything in a large bowl (forget the food processor!)  I melted the butter and poured it into the bowl and added 1 TBS of vanilla. I used the powdered buttermilk and they turned out fabulous. (They are good even without syrup.)  I made them for a group of 6 sixth grade boys after a sleepover birthday party.  The boys loved them - especially when I told them how healthy they were.

These were delicious!  I used 1/3 cup ground oats because I didn't have wheat germ.  Then I used 2 cups sour milk and had planned on using the other1/2 cup but didn't need it.  I used 1/4 cup of apple sauce in place of the butter and meant to use an egg, but totally forgot!  They turned out wonderful!  Sorry I made so many changes, but I we're trying to be super healthy!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! Made 16 pancakes instead of 4 at the 4" size I make them! Truly a "keeper" recipe. I used all whole wheat flour, and palm oil rather than butter for frying them. Turned out golden and spectacular.

Great pancakes.  Light and fluffy.  I made in the food processor and it was quick and easy.  I substituted quick oatmeal for the germ (what I had on hand).  I'd start with less buttermilk than the recipe calls for and see if you need to thin it out from there.  So cut be half a cup.  Yum Yum.  Really cooked up nice.  Enjoy!

These are fantastic.  Following suggestions from others, I swapped out oatmeal for the wheat germ, as well as applesauce for the butter.  They were totally delicious.  (Of course I was liberal in cooking them in butter, which is where it gets the flavor best.)  We added sprinkles, raspberries, slivered almonds & chocolate chips (some with a combination of 2 or 3), and they were the best pancakes ever.  Delicious & healthy-ish.

Just found this recipe, made it and it was absolutely fantastic -- didn't taste like dirt, light and fluffy, I want more!
P.S.  Bon Appetit has a great recipe for making buttermilk using store bought and whole milk.  Or just do the vinegar/milk or lemon juice/milk combo.

I'm SO frustrated!  pancake night is supposed to be easy, right??  well this recipe is turning into a nightmare for me!!  i guess i would suggest that you heed other people's comments about adding the liquid a little bit at a time because mine are way too thin and burning!!  ugh.

Very good. A little bit bland, next time I'll add some Pumpkin Pie Spice. I replaced the white flour with WW Pastry Flour. Used the food processor for cutting in the butter and left out the brown sugar. Added in chopped pecans, filling & good.

LOVED IT!  I omitted the butter and added about 1/3 c. applesauce instead and added about 1tbs. of cinnamon.  I added less milk, I did about 2-2 1/4 c.  I did oats instead of wheat germ and added 2 tbs. of ground flax.   And one last thing, I subed agave for the brown sugar.  My kids loved them!  We put strawberry freezer jam on them or just ate them plain as a snack!  So delicious and filling and healthy.  It lowered the calorie content about 100 calories per serving.

These tasted great.  My family loved them.  I didn't tell the kids that they were different and they all ate seconds.  I gave it four stars because the batter was very thin and the pancakes pretty flat.  Next time I will use a ltlle less buttermilk and see if that helps.

I do variations of this with fruit.. sometimes blueberries, strawberries, banana and even apple. I mix it right into the batter and they come out great! I have also been known to put a little flax seed, or almond slivers in as well.

These pancakes were super simple and very delish!! I used all whole wheat flour, ground flax seed and wheat germ. I used just a little more brown sugar and added really good vanilla. I also didn't have any butter milk on hand so I just did the milk and lemon juice trick. Instead of the butter I just added 1/4 cup applesauce. I also upped the baking powder to 2 tablespoons. They were fluffy and really light. This was just what I was looking for and next time I will add some bananas or blueberries to the batter!!

yum! I love these! I use all whole wheat flour, part oil and part canola oil instead of butter. I served with a blueberry sauce: put 1 c. blueberries (fresh or frozen) 1/3 c. water and 1/4 c. sugar in a small pot or saucepan and simmer till it reaches your desired thickeness. You may add more water or more sugar the measurments are from memory, i usually just eyeball it.

Loved these pancakes. Better than most restaurant pancakes. I didn't have buttermilk so did the milk/lemon recommendation from some of the other reviews. My kids loved them too. They freeze well, just pop in the toaster for quick breakfast.

These pancakes are really good! I didn't have any wheat germ and I wanted to use a bit more wheat flour than the recipe called for, so I ended up using 1.5 cups wheat flour with 0.5 cup all-purpose flour and omitted the wheat germ. They still cooked up nice & light. I agree with another reviewer though, that the recipe calls for too much milk. I added it gradually and ended up with .5 cup leftover milk, and quite a thin batter as it was.  With the exception of the milk adjustment, I think this is a great recipe and I'm sure I'll use it again :-)

These are great.  My husband raves about these.  I don't bother making the small batch this recipe will make.  I usually quadruple the recipe.  It's o.k. to make these with regular milk.

Delicious!!  I gave this four stars since I had to change it a little bit:

I used regular whole wheat flour instead of the pastry flour, and I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used skim milk with lemon juice instead.  I found that the batter was a little bit too thin for the type of pancakes that we like, so I added almost another cup of all-purpose flour to the mix.   

The pancakes were beautiful and golden, with a great consistency.  We will definitely use this one again.

My changes  to this recipe was to add oats instead of wheat germ (didn't have it) and I added some fresh squeezed orange juice pulp to enhance the flavor.  This was a nice change from traditional white flour pancakes.  My 12 yr old picky eater even ate it!

I messed the recipe up, but actually ended up with a great whole wheat Swedish pancake.  I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing, and I added the eggs to the mixture without beating them first.  Once I realized what I had done, it was too late.  So, I whisked the mixture together and then I cooked them on a flat griddle.  I tipped the griddle from side to side to get the batter to spread out completely.  My husband is Scandinavian, so he enjoyed the healthy version of his favorite kind of pancake.

The flavor of this pancake is great - I followed some advice I read in one of the reviews and added vanilla.  I also used oil instead of butter to keep it healthy.  I can't say anything about the fluffiness of these pancakes, since I messed that part up, but they taste great.

These were delicious pancakes and nice and fluffy. I used 1% milk with a little vinegar in place of the buttermilk as I didn't have any on hand for my late night craving. This is my new pancake recipe from now on.

WOW! these are the pancakes we've been looking for! Nice and thin, but fluffy! Delicious! 
I substituted the wheat germ for 1/2 c. ground oats (i just ground them in the magic bullet). Also substituted 5 TB canola oil for the butter. I added 2 TB applesauce. I used whole milk & added the juice of one lemon ---YUM! This recipe makes a LOT of pancakes. For the last few pancakes, I added a little bit of orange zest to the batter. again, SO good!

This is the first pancake batter recipe I have made from scratch that I have actually enjoyed.  They are light and fluffy.  I used canola oil instead of butter and made my own buttermilk with about a tablespoon of lemon juice added to skim milk.  Folded some fresh blueberries in the mix and added thinly sliced bananas after putting on the griddle.  Kids love them too!  A definite keeper!

I love these pancakes I make them every weekend.  As I have made them more than 20 times there are a few variation, I have come to like.  1) I think the pancakes are a little eggy so I reduce to 1 egg and increase baking powder to 2.5 tsp  2) I add a 1/2 cup of old fashioned oatmeal to my milk.  I never have buttermilk so I mix 3 Tbsp of lemon with 2.5 cups milk.  3) I add 1/3 cup of flax seed ground (not milled!)  4) I usually use butter spread as it is a little softer to cut into the batter 5) I usually add cut bananas, blueberries, sometimes chocolate chips, or even raisins to the batter to give it an extra yumminess.   These pancakes are great reheated later in the week.   This is a weekly must!  Thank you

WOW!  Talk about good!  I made a few changes to the recipe, instead of wheat germ, I added 2 packets of instant oatmeal (apple), and it flavored the panckes very well!  So moist and fluffy!  They freeze and heat very well.  This is now our "go to" recipe when we want pancakes!  YUMMY!!!!

These were pretty good. I softened the butter before adding to the dry ingredients. I also sprinkled the frozen blueberries after I put pancakes in the skillet (so it wouldn't turn the batter blue). Next time, I might put a mashed banana in it, but I didn't have any on hand.

Don't use this amount of milk. I usually end up using about hald the amount, but it's easiest to start with a cup, mix it in, and then add milk until you achieve the consistency you want. Also, I use 2/3 cup on whole wheat flour and 1/3 cup of flax seed, to make it extra healthy. Also, since they area so healthy I throw in a half a bag of chocolate chips, too. (A whole bag when I double the recipe, which is OFTEN! =D) Last of all, these pankcakes are AWESOME to freeze in a sandwich-size plastic bag and then stick in the toaster on another morning. My husband and I usually have these a couple times a week as a result. So good!

OMG, these came out perfect and everyone loved them!!  I did make some additions but followed the basic recipe as far as measurements of the ingredients.  Except for the milk I used 2 c then 2 mashed bananas.  Also added some finely chopped walnuts, ground flax and cinnamon.  Highly recommend you try these!!

These were great!!  Especially being whole wheat pancakes, these were exceptionally delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I left out the salt altogether.  Personally, I don't think these even needed syrup on them with all the butter in them, but are divine with sliced strawberries or any kind of pancake friendly fruit, along with a little whipped topping to top it off.  Mmmm!  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks so much for sharing this yummy recipe, Jen!  :)

These came out awesome! I was pleasantly surprised at how good they really were. I only had 1 cup of buttermilk so I subsituted about a cup of skim milk. I also used a 1/3 c of unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter to try to cut down on the fat.

I served mine with the blueberry breakfast sauce found on this site and it was scrumptious. Definitely a keeper.

Just tried this morning and they were a hit.  A little time consuming which is why I gave it four stars (cutting the butter into pieces to put into the dry ingredients and then equivalent of cutting that together resembled making a pie crust).  

I also didn't have buttermilk and followed the tips I saw in other reviews of lemon juice added to milk (I used 1% milk).  I also didn't have wheat germ and substituted quick-cooking oats and a teaspoon of ground flax seed.

My fiance requested white chocolate chips as a treat add-in for these and they came out pretty good.  I do believe though that I'd prefer adding some blueberries instead.

We really liked these.  No one noticed that they weren't the usual white flour pancakes.  They do take a bit longer to whip up but for the health benefits, it's definitely worth it.  I did think that they took longer on the griddle than my usual recipe, so next time I'll leave more time for that.  We got 9, 4 inch pancakes out of 1/2 a batch.

Excellent pancakes.  We topped them with Pike's Gooey Syrup from this site, and it was a great combination.

This is a great pancake recipe. As others have said, the batter was too thin for us so, we added more flour and more wheat germ until it came to the consistency with which we were comfortable. I would say we added about a cup altogether. This is the only way we make pancakes now!

Incredible!  These are the BEST pancakes I have ever eaten.  I added fresh blueberries.  This recipe makes so many;  I just freeze the leftovers and they are just as good reheated.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I will never have a regular pancake again!

Our current favorite pancakes!  My stepdaughter, who doesn't usually like whole wheat, loves these.  We add vanilla and a bit of cinnamon and/or nutmeg.  This time we tried them cutting the liquid to 2 cups as others suggested and that seemed to work well.  We use oatmeal instead of wheat germ.  I added some pecans to mine this time and loved them.  We tried freezing some "mix" (all the dry ingredients).  Worked great!  But they freeze cooked well too!  Yum.

These pancakes were wonderful. I, too, substituted oats for the wheat germ. Made them Christmas morning for guests, and they were blown away. They are wholesome with just a hint of sweetness. Served with homemade blueberry sauce. Try them!

These were great, my girls had two little girl friends over to play early this morning and I offered to make breakfast - all of the kids thought they were yummy and cleaned their plates. I thought they were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I used oatmeal instead of wheatgerm (didn't have any) and regular milk with vinegar in place of buttermilk.

Wow!!!I was looking for a whole grain pancake that was healthy but not heavy, and this is it!  They were very light (but very rich because of the butter).  Instead of buttermilk, I used about 2 cups of plain yogurt mixed with enough milk to equal 2 1/2 cups. Served with strawberries, bananas, and whipped cream.  What a treat!

Because of this recipe I am now a fan of whole wheat pancakes, in fact my husband doesn't like regular pancakes, he says they taste like cardboard!  But he loves these and I do too.  The whole wheat and wheat germ just give it a hearty flavor.  Yum!  I've made this several times now and the last time I used half the batter one day and the other half a couple days later.  The batter lasted great in the fridge.

Great texture - fluffy and light, lots of rise - but I thought the flavor was missing something.  I think I'll add vanilla next time.  My batter wasn't runny at all - I used soymilk + lemon juice (1 tBsp per cup soymilk) and let it stand for 5-10 min. while I mixed the dry ingredients.  I've used different flours instead of all-purpose - graham, cornmeal, brown rice - experiment with whatever you have on hand.  Make sure not to overmix batter; stir just until combined (should still be lumpy).

These were probably the best pancakes my husband and I have ever tasted and we are not fans of whole wheat. We even prefered them plain without syrup, which for us is very unusual. We made some changes. Quick oats instead of wheat germ, 2tsp of vinegar in 2 cups of skim milk instead of 2 1/2 cups buttermilk, olive oil in place of the butter. Used regular becel margarine in the frying pan to cook them. The only thing is that these were so thin (like crepes) even after cutting the liquid down half a cup. After making a couple of thin ones I added 1/2 cup more whole wheat flour and they looked like nice thick, fluffy pancakes. If I were making these for guests I would probably add the 1/2 cup extra flour, but we prefered the taste of the first thin ones best.

Yummy!  These were exactly what I was looking for.  I changed the buttermilk for soy milk, and they came out perfectly.  Like another reviewer, I didn't have any wheat germ around, so I just added a little extra whole wheat flour.  These were nice and hearty, yet light, especially for whole wheat.  This is my new official pancake recipe.  Thank you!

This is a very nice healthy pancake recipe.  I was worried that my finace would not like them but he ended up eatting three.  We are trying to move away from white flour to a more healthy carb.  I changed a few things but that was my personal choice.  First, I scaled it down to two servings and it even made more than what we could eat.  I used soy flour instead of the all purpose, I didn't have wheat germ so I used oat bran in its place, I used I can't Believe its not butter Light and used a combination of soy milk and sour cream in place of the buttermilk.  Threw in some fresh blueberries and I was happy.  Thanks  :)

mmmmm!  these pancakes were delicious!  i must admit i did make a few modifications.  as other reviewers suggested i only used 2 cups of buttermilk and i used less butter as well (maybe 3Tbsp).  I also added 2 mashed bananas and 2c. blueberries.  my husband said these were his favourite pancakes ever (which makes me happy, since that means they're even better than his mother's!!!).

Absolutely delicious and had a nice fluffy texture. For me the recipe made about 14 medium sized 4-5" pancakes. As per a previous reviewer I am anxious to try freezing them and reheating. I used the wheat germ and only used 2 cups of the buttermilk(actually had no buttermilk on hand so used 2TB vinegar and the rest skim milk). It seemed that the batter would have been too runny with that last 1/2 c. Now just have to figure out what to do about all the butter! May try substituting some applesauce for the butter next time...

I didn't have buttermilk, so I tried the milk and lemon juice trick, but the milk didn't curdle. I used the milk anyway, just added it slowly until the mixture was batter consistency. I used quick oats instead of wheat germ, too. Anyway, they still turned out great. Not as fluffy as if I had used buttermilk, but my 17 month old daughter was crazy for them and I felt good giving her something she loves that is not totally processed.
They freeze well, too. Easy to throw a few in the microwave for an easy breakfast.

Love this! My  super picky husband said these were better than First Watch pancakes! I substituted the butter with 1/4 cup canola oil and used 1 cup Silk Light Almond milk with only 1/2c Buttermilk, only because this is all I had in the fridge. I also added about 2 T cinnamon and a little nutmeg just for added flavor! Enjoy tweaking your own recipe!

It wasn't very fluffy. The taste was good, but the batter was very watery and the pancakes didn't rise much. Maybe it was the buttermilk substitute I used.

Excellent! I also used a mix of plain yogurt and milk to substitute for buttermilk. Very light texture, the butter adds a lot! Thank you!

Very good.  I traded all the butter out for a 1/4 cup of canola oil and a 1/4 cup applesauce and it turned out great.

These were delish! I made a couple healthier substitutions... unsweetened apple sauce replaced butter, used Splenda brown sugar & flax seed instead of wheat germ (bc I didn't have the later). Will come back for this one again!

I loved these! I have a friend who used whole wheat flour for just about everything and then found out her husband has to have a totally gluten free diet....I got all her flour! Followed the directions with the exception to buttermilk I used plain yogurt with a splash of milk to get to the consistency I like. Takes about 3 minutes to cook on each side but I love them just the same.

Great flavour, easy to make!  I made a double batch and the 2 1/2 cups of buttermilk was perfect for the double batch.  I added a banana and it was great!

YUMMY!!  My two year old ate it in record time and asked for more!  The healthiest pancake I've ever made.  I added some ground flaxseed for added nutrition.  I also substituted the eggs for a mashed banana because my daughter is has an egg allergy.  It added a bit more sweetness to the pancakes.  I didn't have buttermilk so I heeded the other reviewers advice of using regular milk and vinegar.  Love it!  Thanks!!!

great pancakes and healthy too...I did not have to use as much milk as it calls for. Add milk gradually until you have desired consistancy.

Yum! But next time I would use the vegetable oil instead of butter like someone suggested and I would also use a little less milk. Oh, and I added a hint of cinnamon, big hit!

Good flavor, light and tender, but kinda flat. I think next time I would start with 1 cup of buttermilk and see how the batter looks.

I made a couple of changes to these.  I omitted the salt.  I found them way to salty, especially after adding in the baking powder and baking soda which adds saltiness.  I also omitted the butter.  They weren't dry at all, so why add all the fat and calories?

These are so good, and the perfect texture. I replaced the butter with 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 canola oil, made soured milk in place of buttermilk (1 Tbsp. vinegar for each cup of milk), replaced a couple Tbsp. of white flour with flax meal, and they are just wonderful.

Really good pancakes! I found the batter to be a little too runny, so next time, I would cut back on the buttermilk a little.  Also, I'm not sure why, but the pancakes were pretty flat.  Otherwise, these were extremly tasty and I didn't feel quite so guilty eating them knowing they were made with WW flour and wheat germ!  Lovely texture.  I just might make this my new pancake recipe!  Thank you, Jen for sharing this one!

Awesome!!!  I read a bunch of reviews first so I substituted oats for wheat germ, 2 cups buttermilk instead of 2 1/2, used only whole wheat flour (1 2/3 cp) and added cinnamon and vanilla.  They were fluffy, tasted wonderful and made about 6 pancakes.  Also they didn't leave me with that bloated, full feeling when I eat regular pancakes, that in itself was worth it!!

something about this recipe was just "off" for me. i ended up with a pancake that had a hard crust formed top and bottom. it was yuck. and i could taste the baking soda. i'll try it again, but only to figure out what went wrong.

These were yummy pancakes!  I did make a couple of adjustments, I subbed one mashed banana for the butter in the batter.  I also used sour milk (skim milk and lemon juice) since I didn't have any buttermilk.  I added a dash of cinnamon and the whole family enjoyed.  When I told the hubby there was whole wheat flour and wheat germ in the pancakes (he usually prefers plain, all while flour ones) he said, "Wow, I couldn't tell!  These are great!"

This was pretty good and a healthy source of folic acid. Cooks a little faster than regular pancakes. Watch closely not to burn.

These turned out EXCELLENT! I didn't have any wheat germ, so I substituted ground flax seed.  I used 1/4 C canola oil instead of butter. Next time I might try applesauce.  It did turn out a little runny, so I cut the milk to 2 cups and still had to up the flour another cup or so.  Because of all the changed I had to make, I only gave the rating a 3, even though flavor wise it came out a 5! We topped with fresh strawberry syrup and whip cream for a delicious Saturday morning breakfast (with leftovers to freeze!)

I've made this recipe a few times and found that using less buttermilk is better because they tend to be thin.  I also use oats instead of wheat germ and I added frozen blueberries.  These taste great and the best thing is, they're healthy! Thanks!

These were very good - I followed the recipe to a "T", except for using all wheat flour instead of wheat/white mixture. I didn't use it all the first morning I made it, so I saved the rest in the refrigerator and used it the next day - just as good!

My family and I  (a kid, a teen and 2 adults) love this recipe! The pancakes have so much more flavor than regular pancakes, thanks to the whole wheat and the brown sugar (great addition!). I just tried the recipe for the first time yesterday, and it has already gone into the family's "best recipes" book. My only concern was that, as I never have buttermilk, i used milk + sour cream to replace it; turned out great, however there was too much milk and the batter was very runny. I'll put less milk next time, so the pancakes are fluffy.

Not bad for the amount of fibre there is in the recipe.  Made them with applesauce instead of butter, and oatmeal instead of wheat germ.  They were actually quite good.  The family said I could make them again.  Played with the batter a little because it was really thin,(used only 1 3/4 cup milk).  The thinner the batter, the lighter the pancake.  The thicker batter actually made real heavy pancakes.  Will make these again as they are easy to make.

This is the BEST whole wheat pancake recipe!! Instead of using all purpose flour I substituted for organic white whole wheat. Since I'm adding coconut oil to my diet, I subbed for the butter. I also replaced the wheat germ for quick cooking oats. These were amazingly light and fluffy and it's great that it's soooo good for you!

WOW!!!  One warning.  You will never go back to commercial pancake mix again.  The 3 brands I had were in the garbage before breakfast was cleaned up.  I subbed wheat bran for wheat germ.  I cut the room-temp butter in with a pastry blender rather than use the food processor.  I made a shallow well in the center of the dry ingredients and fork-beat the eggs just before adding the buttermilk, so it was one-bowl clean up.  My new electric grill says 400°F for pancakes, but 350° was much better.  But even the first few almost burned pancakes were awesome.  Thank you SO much Jen!

FABULOUS! I was afraid this would taste too healthy, but no.  They were DELICIOUS.  It made a good amount, too!  I had to sub lemon juice + milk for the buttermilk.  (Never keep that on hand.)  And I added banana slices to one side of each pancake.  Excellent!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Overall this healthy version of pancakes was great. I took a few other reveiwers suggestions and instead of buttermilk ( didn't have any)I added a little vinegar to the milk. I also found the batter to be a little runny, so just slowly added a little extra whole wheat flour till i got the desired texture. Other than that, this came out great and is a heathly alternative to a classic!

I've been making the "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes" from this site (they're awesome, but not healthy).... so I tried this one for better health.  Oh my....they are really good!  I didn't have wheat germ, so I added more wheat flour. I also didn't have buttermilk, so I added vinegar to milk (use 1T vinegar to 1C milk), then added some vanilla & they were perfect!

We've made these twice in the past week.  My 1 year old LOVES them.  I added a bit of ground flax seed, and they were great.

I love these!  The flavor is so good!  The second time I made them I added about 2tsp of vanilla extract.  It added just enough extra flavor.  


I didn't use all the butter either time.  When I cooked them, I used maybe 1 tsp per "round" (made appx 6 each round).

This is one of the best recipes for whole wheat pancakes.  After having this, regular pancakes are simply too heavy.  This has a great texture and lightness.

This was an excellent recipe.  I substituted vanilla soy milk for the buttermilk, and it turned out great.  We will definitely be making this again!

did everything in the food processor.  subbed oats for the wheat germ, added some vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, shredded some apple and added to the batter.  They were surprisingly not real heavy for whole wheat, and tasted great with the additions.  The batter was a little too thick for me so thinned it down a bit.

This made a thin and very moist pancake.  I used cream of wheat instead of wheat germ and they were great.  My family loved them.  This recipe makes a lot of pancakes and fed my family of 5 with leftovers.  Thanks.

I have made these delicious pancakes several times.  At first I did think they were too runny and tried less buttermilk but didn't like the results.  Then I noticed that, upon standing, some of the liquid seems to be absorbed and the batter thickens.  Since then I have just let the batter stand while I heat the griddle with perfect results.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were very good wheat pancakes. My mother and husband are really into eating healthy but I am usually leary of baking using whole wheat because I have had so many big disasters where the food tastes discusting....but these really turned out yummy.  I was very happily suprised.  I could definately replace regular white pancakes with these...very good.

These are just wonderful.  I like a heartier pancake, so I cut the buttermilk down, otherwise they come out more crepe like.  They freeze beautifully between wax paper and then just pop them in the toaster straight from the freezer.  They are just as good the second time around.  I used wheat bran instead of wheat germ, and that worked great.

This is a delicious recipe but needs a few changes as other reviews have stated.  Cut the buttermilk to about 1 1/2 c.  Add about a t of vanilla and some cinamon.  Butter can be replaced by olive oil or if using butter, does not need more than 4 T to taste great.  Thanks for the recipe.  My husband and I loved it!

This is an excellent recipe. I replaced the wheat germ with oat bran and replaced 1/3 cup flour with soy flour. Also replaced 1 Tab butter with 1 Tab olive oil, may try more next time. Cooked them on my griddle with no additional butter or oil. Added 1/2 t. vital wheat gluten to increase rise. Fluffy and Yummy!!

This is a great pancake, almost better than a regular pancake.  Light and tasty, healthy too.
I used the oats cuz had no wheat germ and even used powdered milk with vinegar and it still came out tasting great. But I did use 1/2 cup less of the liquid because I like a heartier pancake.

My entire family loved these.  Yes, the batter is a bit thin, but just follow the instructions.. cook and eat instead of worrying about the consistency before cooked.  My daughter and I needed to put more fiber into our diet and this is a great way to do it.  We all love pancakes!  I've made the recipe twice and they do freeze well and warm up well in microwave.  Made ahead for a long camping trip the 2nd time and just zapped them a bit when ready to eat.  Great!

Used swerve and applesauce instead of butter and brown sugar (maybe add another tb or two as it would be nice just a little sweeter), added 1.5 tsp cinnamon, some vanilla, and 1/2 c chopped raisins to make cinnamon raisin pancakes, served with a sprinkle of butter, cinnamon/sugar and syrup. Loved these. Made 12 with 1/3 cup measure, 3 without the raisins, 4 with each

These pancakes were very thin, almost like Swedish pancakes.  I used whole wheat pastry flour.  I didn't have wheat germ, so I used oats.  We liked the taste, but the thinness made them not the best for adding blueberries.  I had made a double batch,  which was more than we needed.  So, this afternoon I cooked the remaining pancakes in a non-stick 10 inch skillet, using the full pan for each pancake.  Similar to crepes, we are going to eat the rest of the pancakes as Russian Blini, with both savory and sweet fillings (probably mushroom, onion, potato, bacon,  with cheese or sour cream & I may cook some apples with cinnamon for another option...or some of our extra blueberries and whipped cream).

They turned out wonderfully & we used butter pecan syrup on them, too.

I used to make pancakes all the time. For some reason, they stopped turning out well. This recipe will be my new standard. I've never seen a pancake recipe with the fat cut into it like a pie crust, but it worked. Soured the milk with apple cider vinegar. I cut the recipe in half and it made 3 nice sized pancakes and an extra large one. Love the whole wheat flavor. I added walnuts and bananas to the batter. I let the batter set about 10 minutes after mixing it up and it foamed up a little. Great texture, fluffy and moist. The proportions of dry and wet ingredients were perfect!

Did not have buttermilk so made this recipe with lactose free whole milk. I ended up only using 2 cups bc the batter became quite runny.  This makes ALOT of pancakes ~ for two of us! I ended up putting some of the batter in a Pyrex container to make more in a few days! Added blueberries and overall ~ quite tasty!

The best pancakes ever! I do change the recipe though, to make it a little healthier and tastier,

First I swap milk for buttermilk, add an extra egg, one mashed ripe banana and a tsp of vanilla. What you get is a cross between a pancake and crepe, without the sugar sweetness, but with a the richness of a banana and vanilla finish. The texture is almost much nicer, thinner with good consistency.

The flavor of these were really yummy but they were soo flat! I had everything in the recipe except wheat germ, I used oats instead. I followed the recipe to the T. The batter came out really wet but I used the exact amount of buttermilk. Not sure what happened but they were not fluffy at all!

These actually tasted good! Here are the changes I made: I used ground flax seed instead of wheat germ in the same 1/3 cup quantity, I didn't have butter milk so I used a cup of 2% and a cup of whole milk note that I did not use the full 2 and 1/3 cups of milk the recipe calls for just 2 cups, I cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon, I used two table spoons of white sugar instead of brown sugar, the rest I kept the same. They came out great. I let the batter sit for about 5+ minutes while the griddle heated up so the water absorbed into everything.

I love this recipe! I make them every week for my 9 month old daughter. She loves them too. They are moist and fluffy, and really don't even need syrup. I love making them for my family because it is filled with the good stuff. I have started substituting brown sugar with apple sauce, and sometimes use regular milk if I don't have buttermilk on hand. Also, I always use oatmeal too. The batter looks watery, but cooks nice and fluffy! This is the only pancake recipe I need.

No one could tell it was whole wheat! I followed the recipe except for subbing half the butter with coconut oil. We made a family night out of it by putting the griddle in the middle of the table, scooping out 1/4 cup for each pancake, and letting everyone decorate their own. I had muffin cups set out with bananas, walnuts, blueberries, raisins, dried cranberries, (and the more indulgent M&Ms, chocolate chips, gummy bears, mini marshmallows, and Reece's pieces). It was great family time! We pre-cooked bacon to reheat before the rest of the family arrived and scrambled some eggs just before sitting down. YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe! :o)

I skipped the butter and replaced it with 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.  I also added a couple of teaspoons of vanilla.  My boys loved these.  Next time, I will reduce the milk a little- maybe 4.5 cups instead of five for a double batch.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Jen!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  I did cut back on the butter.  I use 2 Tbsp.  Also, I sometimes add about 1/2 - 3/4 cups of pumpkin (and cinnamon, nutmeg) to the batter.  To make it easier for my morning routine, I put the dry ingredients together the night before, so then I just need to add the milk and eggs in the morning!

These are pretty good, though I won't stop looking for that perfect healthy wholegrain pancake.   I subbed oil for butter and oats for wheat germ.

I used all Whole White Wheat flour instead of the mixture and Splenda instead of brown sugar. I didn't need as much milk. Turned out great. Will definitely do again.

AWESOME! my 2yr old was wanting pancakes and i had no mix. i hadn't ever made pancakes from scratch and i am so glad i chose this recipe! lucky me, they were fantastic. i didn't have buttermilk, so i used the tip about half milk and half yogurt. blended for a minute to give it airy texture with a tsp of vinegar to sour the flavor a little. also used 1/4 cup oil instead of butter. i can't wait to freeze the extras to try toasting them later! thanks for these! i'll make them often!

These pancakes were delicious! The kids loved them. I used canola oil instead of butter and I also added 2 large ripe mashed bananas, just a way to sneack some fruit for the kids. They turned out heavy because of the bananas but tasted delicious.

Fabulous!! We already had a favorite recipe (Dad's whole grain pancakes - also from this site) but I wanted to try something new. I think these were even better. I used 3 T. oil instead of the butter, and used milk miked with 1 T. vinegar per cup for the buttermilk. The kids loved these.

These are good and my husband frequently requests this for breakfast on the weekends.  I typically always use oatmeal instead of wheat germ, all whole wheat flour, vegetable or canola oil in place of the butter, and regular milk soured with some vinegar instead of buttermilk. I find that 2 1/2 cups of milk is just way too much and the batter is very thin.  2 cups usually will do it for the consistency I like.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are a little more work (cause you have to clean the food processor afterwards) than most pancake recipes but worth it because they are super delicious. I served them with sauteed apples but I they taste good plain as well.

Used quick oats instead of wheat germ, 1% milk instead of buttermilk, 1/3 cup applesauce instead of butter, and topped w/ Christmas sprinkles before flipping. I did use the 2 whole eggs (didn't feel like separating) and beat very well before adding to batter. Sooo good - even 4-yo loved them!

It's just amazing!!
I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own by adding a touch of vinegar to milk. Also, I added chopped walnuts and the added crunch was just amazing...

It reminded me of IHOPs harvest crunch pancakes.

This was my first time making pancakes completely from scratch, and I loved how this recipe turned out.  The pancakes were soft with a great texture.  The batter was a little thin, so I had to add some pancake mix to it.  I did substitute applesauce for the butter.  Delicious and great for freezing!

I was a little skeptical at first, since I am new to the "whole wheat flour" thing.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.  Everybody ate them up like crazy.  My kids, 3 & 5, like to add baking sprinkles to pancakes. It is kinda fun, go ahead and try it.

These were very good, but I used only 2cups of milk. They would have been very watery if I used the recommended 2.5 cups. I also substituted oil for butter and vinegar and milk for buttermilk. Overall, they had a much better flavor than white pancakes.

I LOVE this recipe, and so does my 1yr old daughter. It has way more flavor than any ordinary pancake recipe, and is definately healthier. i used canola oil instead of butter, and oatmeal instead of wheat germ. i can't wait to try it with the wheat germ later on.

This is great.  As others suggested, I used oats instead of wheat germ and used skim milk instead of buttermilk.  Only used 2 cups though and it still seemed a little runny...I added a teaspoon of white sugar and added raisins while cooking.  Very good, will use this again!  Thanks for sharing.

these were great. I did make some changes though. I used skim milk instead of buttermilk and oil instead of butter.  when using skim milk I think you might only need 2 cups the batter was pretty thin.  But they tasted great. mmmm. added bananas to it also. so good

My wife and I made this recipe this morning. Best pancakes we've ever had.  Not just the best whole wheat pancakes, but the best pancakes.  Used Splenda Brown Sugar as a substitute and Low Fat Milk instead of Buttermilk.

These were pretty good. I liked the slight 'crunch' from the wheat germ. I had to substitute white sugar for the brown sugar ( I ran out of brown) and used whole milk instead of buttermilk. I also had to add a little extra flour to thicken it a little bit.I also added chocolate chips for some extra 'fun'. My boys loved them! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Great recipe, we all enjoyed.  The only wierd thing was the butter- I just used some softened butter and mixed it in, and used a little bit of canola oil also.  I used quick oats instead of wheat germ, and didn't use a food processor or blender.  Very light and a great texture!

These are delicious.  The only changes I made were using oil instead of the butter and flaxmeal in place of the wheat germ.  Much better and healthier than regular pancakes.  Thanks for the recipe

I substituted 1% milk since no buttermilk on hand; accidentally melted the butter instead of cutting in; used 2 1/2 T butter in recipe and Pam to coat pan.  The batter was thin like others said it would be, but pancakes turned out great!  I may add oats next time as another reviewer suggested.

Loved these pancakes.I didn't have buttermilk, so just used 2% milk, next time i will use less butter, only used 2cups of milk.Would have been too runny with more. A real keeper, thank you for the recipe.

They tasted pretty good but were a little more work.  Add that to the fact that they had so much butter I don't think I will make it again.

These pancakes were quite good.  Fluffy and thick, they brown well and made us feel a little less guilty in the morning.  I used a packet of quick cooking oats because that's all I had.  Stick with the four inch guideline, and if you mix the butter in by hand, be sure to occasionally stir around the pieces or they might just melt together.  Speaking of which, if only these pancakes didn't have so much butter, I would feel great about them!

These tasted really great.... once i figured out you need to have your grill a bit hotter than for normal pancakes. I also found the batter to be quite thin, even after sitting in the fridge for an hour, but they did puff up a bit when cooked. They also brown really really nicely!! Overall great recipe, but I think I might play around with it a little bit more to see if I can get the batter thicker without loosing that great light fluffy texture! :) Thank you!

Husband and kids loved them!  I used rolled oats and a food processor.  Nice light texture.  I feel good that they are getting whole grains (even though it is a lot of butter!).

These are the lightest wheat pancakes I have ever had.  Very good.  Did not have a whole lot of whole wheat flavor to them that I expected but were still very good.  I followed everything exactly and it came out perfect.

Extremely good!  Wonderful flavor and texture.  I used milk + 1 T vinegar per cup instead of buttermilk.  I also added an extra T of brown sugar because I like my pancakes a little sweeter.  I didn't have a food processor, so I cut the butter in with a paster cutter.  Very simple.  NEXT TIME, I will follow people's advice about using less milk.  I will start with 2 c. and add more if needed.  That would be my only complaint...they were a little too thin.  Otherwise, they were surpurb!!!

Wow! These were absolutely fabulous! I've never had a whole wheat pancake that was so fluffy and light! I didn't have any buttermilk on hand, but added 2 Tbsp. white vinegar to the milk. The pancakes turned out a little thin, but I'm sure with real buttermilk they would have been better. I will be making these every time I make pancakes (which might be more often now!) Thanks for a great recipe!

These are the most delicious pancakes ever.  Try adding chocolate chips or blueberries.  Good with syrup on top, or applesauce.  Also try adding shredded coconut.

These turned out REALLY well - I used less milk as suggested by previous reviewers, but after mixing the batter and cooking one test pancake ended up adding in the rest. They were light in texture but were very filling and satisfying.

I thought they tasted pretty good, but my husband didn't care for them much. They didn't rise, and he thought they were not as good as buttermilk pancakes.
I will not make them again, but they are worth trying at least once.

I made these pancakes today for lunch and they were great. My children(ages 4 & 2) devoured them. I had no wheat germ or oats, so I added Bulghar. I also used Soy milk w/apples cider vinegar because I had no buttermilk. They were nice and light also.

Healthy and tastes great. I think I prefer them to regular pancakes. (I didn't have buttermilk, so I used regular milk + 1 tablespoon vinegar for each cup). They even taste good without syrup because of that little bit of brown sugar in the mix.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I used all the ingredients, except buttermilk as I never buy it. Used 1% and vinegar as substitute. Fluffy and tasted great! A good new healthy alternative to our family breakfast on Sundays!

These are WONDERFUL. I made enough just for myself and then later in the day I went back to make a big batch to make during the week. The only changes I made were using instant oatmeal instead of wheat germ, vinegar and milk instead of buttermilk and I added flax seed meal to the batter for extra fibre.
Thanks for this recipe! They're fantastic. And this is coming from a girl who could live without pancakes. I don't think I can anymore!

This recipe is very very very good! The best pancakes I've had in a long time. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla. I didn't have wheat germ, so I measuered out 1/3 cup oats and put them through my small food processor. I mixed the ingredients in a bowl (not the food processor, as mine is too small for all the ingredients). Very yummy and great consistency. Thanks!!

Great pancakes!  I substituted milk with vinegar for the buttermilk and quick oats for the wheat germ and they tasted great.  I also cut the buttermilk down to 1 cup as suggested by others and they were the perfect thickness.  My family loved these and I'll definitely make them again.

These were yummy! Light, fluffy, & very fresh tasting. I followed a reviewer and also used 2 c liquid (2 T vinegar and the rest 1% milk). And added some vanilla & cinnamon. Thanks!

I was so impressed with these pancakes!  I wanted to make a batch of pancakes that I could freeze individually and toast in the morning for my toddler's breakfasts.  The healthiness of this recipe appealed to me.  My husband was looking forward to them too, until I said they were whole wheat..he said "whole wheat?! yuck!" But he was equally impressed with them.  They were very tasty and we all liked them, and they do freeze and reheat beautifully.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they were very flat, and I like a fluffier pancake.  But they were very tasty and tender.

The best Whole Wheat pancakes I have ever tried! This is the first recipe that didn't turn my healthy pancakes into bricks. I used soy flour instead of all-purpose flour and they turned out just as tasty and fluffy.

These pancakes were light and tender, as described.  This was a very easy recipe to put together-just a few more ingredients than my traditional white flour-based recipe.  These are so much healthier and they are wonderful!  Not dry or tough like some whole wheat pancake recipes.  The big test was whether my six year old and two year old would eat them without complaining.  They both cleaned their plates, and the six year old asked for more!  MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!  Thank you, Jen!

These pancakes were amazing! i like them better than the traditional "white flour" ones.  They had a wonderful taste and while they were a little thin- i liked them because they were light and you didn't feel stuffed after eating them!  I didn't have wheat germ so i subsituted in 1/3 cup whole wheat flour.  This is now my new pancake recipe!

This is an excellent tasting, healthy pancake. My 5 boys like this recipe better than any pancake recipe I've used before. And I have tried quite a few.

Tender and delectable.  Even my picky 4 year old pancake connosseur gobbled these up.  I make a batch a week and store leftovers in the fridge to re-heat.  They taste great even re-heated.

The flavor was tasty, however I did not get fluffy pancakes at all, even after reducing the liquid amount and adding more baking soda.  My pancakes were very flat and crepe like.  I put the oats in instead of wheat germ and put strawberrys on top.  I will try making again to get a better result.

Mine didn't fluff up after the first pancake.  I will try more baking powder next time.  Also reduced buttermilk (milk with vinegar) to just over two cups and it was looking pretty runny at that.

Takes a bit more work and a food processor but the result is yummy with maple syrup.

These are a wonderful substitution for traditional white pancakes!  My 19 month old didn't even notice the difference.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used skim milk (all I had on hand)and vinegar.  The pancakes still tasted great, but the batter was a little runny.  Next time I will try using real buttermilk.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband wasn't very excited to hear we were having whole wheat pancakes for supper!  He loved these as did my four-year old daughter.  She never batted an eye to the fact that they were any different!  Great recipe!
