These pickles are addictive and incredible! This was my first attempt at making pickles and they turned out beautifully. My family has already devoured 2 jars and I made them last Thursday!

These were a real crowd pleaser at our house!  I am diabetic, so I cut the sugar back to only 1/4 cup, and we don't really like our pickles sweet.  Other than that I followed the recipe completely and everyone loved them!  The horseradish adds a nice taste to the pickles....definately a keeper!

I made these using prepared horseradish because I couldn't find horseradish root at the grocery. I also just used half cup sugar, and added 1 halved jalapeno to each jar. The mixture looks weird- milky white due to the prepared horseradish (2 T. per jar), but the pickles are fantastic! love these!

I only made a small batch as it is a new flavor for us.  I also omitted the sugar because we do not care for sweet pickles.  I used purchased horseradish as I could not find fresh at my local store.  I made sure to cut the blossom end off the cucumbers (keeps them crisper) and added a pinch of red pepper.  These were fantastic! Tasty without clearing out your sinuses! LOL.   My family loved them and I will make again.
