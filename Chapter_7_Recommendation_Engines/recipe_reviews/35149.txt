As a former carney, I LOVE these!  The one thing I miss most about being a part of a traveling carnival company is the hand-dipped corn dogs.  I have a couple of suggestions for achieving corn dog perfection:  1)  Dry the hot dogs with a paper towel before dipping them in the batter.  This way, you don't need to coat them with flour or anything before dipping.  2)  Make sure your batter is ICE COLD.  This will make it thicker and it will resist "melting" off into the oil before it firms up from frying.  3)  Use regular Farmer John hot dogs...not the all-beef kind (that's what the carnival food wagons all use!).  4) Omit the black pepper from this recipe.  It's not needed.

These are awesome. Since the hot dogs are smooth, you need to roll them in flour first. This will help keep the batter on. I poured the batter in a mason jar (quart size) and dipped the hot dogs in the jar.It's alot easier than rolling them around.   Thanks

Very yummy. I've found that putting the prepared batter in a drinking glass helps ease the process... it's the perfect size tool to batter a hot dog!

I loved that I could use good quality kosher hotdogs.  You don't always know the quality of meat that are in those at the fair!!  I precooked the hotdogs first in boiling water for 7 min.  I then let the mixture and the hotdogs rest for 10 min.  I coated them with corn starch and the mixture stuck very well.  Also, make sure your oil is the perfect temp.  365 degrees was perfect for me.  If it is too hot the outside will burn and the inside batter will be raw.  If it is not hot enough the  batter will slide off. I love these because they are crunchy on the outside.  Great recipe!!!!

Wonderful recipe!!!  Roll your hotdog in corn starch first.  It will prevent your batter from slidding off.

I was really surprised when I found out that I had everything to make homemade corndogs on hand.  I substituted honey for the sugar and skipped the black pepper and they turned out great.  I made some fresh lemonade to go with it.  Perfect!

OK so I broke down with the healthy eating-1 day/week won't hurt. Made these to keep the family from revolting against me. They are great-the recipe receives 4 stars b/c the tips to make them came from a reviewer-I followed Keri's tips (she worked at a carny she knows these things) cold batter, dry dogs and no pepper-perfect and I followed another reviewer and put the batter in a glass so it would be easy to coat the dogs-GREAT idea. I added a bit more milk b/c the batter thickened after it came out of the fridge. Will make again

Great recipe. They taste just like the ones at the fair! I had been searching for a recipe for these corn dogs for a long time and I finally found it. The batter is simple to make and delicious.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

I pulled out all of the stops for these.  Used 1/4lb. dogs, made sure they were dry before dipping, used a tall glass to dip them in, gradually added milk to the batter to make sure it wasn't too runny, added milk as needed to keep it from getting too thick.  Definitely the best corn dogs I've had in a long time.

Great recipe! We all enjoyed it along with some homemade onion rings also on this site! I did have some trouble having the batter stay on, but I hadn't looked at previous reviews to see how to handle that and I'm sure I'll get it to work next time. :)

This recipe worked really well. I followed what another reviewer wrote about getting the oil temp just right (not too cold or hot) and had no problem with the batter falling off. I don't have a deep fryer, so I made half sized hot dogs in a small frying pan, in about an inch of oil. What I noticed was that the batter wanted to flatten out, so as soon as the bottom  was solid enough I rolled it on it's side and continued to roll them back and forth for a perfect looking corn dog. 
I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the rest of the batter (after about 10 half hot dogs) and ended up with sweet hushpuppies---almost cake doughnuts.  Very tasty.

At first I wanted to give these a four stars, but after reading reviews I found out exactly what my problem was. The taste was great, but the next time I will let my batter get cold before deep frying them. Make sure you dry the hot dogs off real good first.  The kids at my church will have a ball making and eating these. Thank you for the recipe.

Here in the UK, we have never tried corn dogs but always wondered .... Well I don't know what they taste like when you buy them, but these were delicious! I was happier to be able to choose own good quality bratwurst.  They coating did cook quite dark like on some of the photos.  I turned the heat down as far as I dare but there was no way they cooked for 3 minutes. No problem though, just heated through in the oven when they were all fried off.  
The only change, I reduced the sugar a little as we don't have a very sweet tooth.

Excellent recipe! My family LOVED them. In fact, they all said "no more store bought corn dogs". I read many of the reviews before I made them today. I made up my batter last night but I used 3 tablespoons of honey instead of the 1/4 cup of white sugar. Since we don't eat pork, I used chicken hot dogs & they were delicious. I did cook my hot dogs ahead of time (boiled them for approximately 7-9 minutes - basically before they plumped up/burst -don't boil too long!) I did use corn starch on the hot dogs as recommended so the batter would stick but in my opinion, as long as the hot dogs are dried off adequately, this is unnecessary with cold batter (also recommended) but feel free to use this method if you like. The best & most useful tips I took advantage of were to place the mixed batter in a cup (tall measuring cup for me) to dip the hot dogs in before frying (makes it so much easier, trust me (I tried the bowl method someone mentioned 1st, which is to place the dogs in the bowl holding the batter & let them sink. This does NOT work well w/cold batter. You end up having to push them down with a tool or your hands & it gets messy. Just spoon batter into a tall glass or measuring cup for dipping.) Lastly, the batter MUST BE COLD. It sticks better and it so much easier to handle. Since I made my batter the night before, it was nice & cold the next day already. If desired add a couple of tsp of cayenne pepper to your batter for spice (after you make the ones for the kids!)

absolutely delicious! My son told me that they are wayy better than store bought ones, and to never buy them again. Only make these! Easy to make, but a bit messy. Worth it though. To make sure the batter sticks to the hotdogs, dry them with a sheet of paper towel first. Works perfectly, and no mess like when drying them with cornstarch(which I did the first time). I made half a batch, and it was the exact right amount for 12 hot dogs (1 package)

I've used this recipe about six times now and they always turn out fabulous. I found that patting the hot dogs dry and coating them in flour helps keep the batter on. I put the batter in a shallow bowl wide enough for the hot dogs to lay flat at the bottom. I found that I can get a more even coating of batter over the hot dog by laying one in the batter and letting it sink in for a few minutes while I'm frying another batch.

Absolutely the best recipe! Followed recipe ingredients (only had 10 hot dogs though!), but used my deep fryer set to 355 degrees.

I did follow other suggestions; put batter in freezer, dried the dogs then rolled in flour - then put them in freezer while fryer was heating up.

The batter is real thick. Had to make sure to drain most of the batter off before cooking -- batter swells a lot!

Did not use the basket in fryer, just gently laid in one dog at a time. They sunk! Had to be careful not to 'move them' once they were in the oil. The came unstuck from the bottom by themselves without breaking the outer coating. Did find this out the hard way with the first one!

Once they were browning and floating I placed the fryer basket on top of them to keep them submerged -- that way they cooked evenly on all sides!

Not only do they look great, but they taste great too!

Will never again be afraid to make corn dogs! Will save me a ton of money because my family loves these better than store bought!

Super easy!  I don't know how you'd get 16 dogs though.  Mine could've fried for 4 min. (at 375) because the dough was still a little raw after 3 min.  I coated my dogs with flour as others suggested.

Yum!  I'm way to old to be craving corn dogs, but my appetite got the best of me and I craved a corn dog for 3 days.  With no local fairs planned for a few months, I tried this recipe.  PERFECT!!!  Delicious and just the right amount of batter.  A few tips:  (1)  Dry the hotdogs using paper towels prior to dipping to remove all moisture, (2) make sure the oil is not to hot, (3) pour the batter into a tall glass prior to dipping, which will give it that perfect corn dog shape!  I have a gas stove, and these were done in 4 minutes (and the batter was done and the hot dog hot!), but your mileage may vary.  We used Johnsonville Cheddar Cheese & Jalapeno Sausages, and they were AWESOME.  Fun, easy to make, and tastes better than any corn dog you can buy.

Just a note to those who are trying to be healthy-- baking these corn dogs does not work!  I think the batter itself would be great, and we didn't have any trouble getting it to stick once we dried the hot dogs completely.  I was hoping to avoid the oil and grease by just baking them and they turned out with a strange taste and texture.  If you really want a corn dog, my advice would be to definitely fry them like the recipe calls for :)

I made these exactly as the recipe stated and they were awesome! I had never made homemade corndogs before and they were such a cinch. I followed the recipe exactly as stated (with the exception that I omitted the black pepper because my husband doesn't like it) and had no problems at all. It only made 13 for me, though. I didn't roll them in flour as some readers suggested, I simply dried each hotdog off with a paper towel and then rolled it in the batter. It stuck! My kids were begging for more. I thought these were better than the state fair corndog I had back in August!!

Great corn dog recipe! I used cocktail size franks, not the sausage type links, but the hotdog type. I used toothpicks instead of the "wood poles" used for regular size franks.  Also, I used peanut oil to fry them.  These were a big hit with our crowd.  They were bite-sized and delicious.  I've really never tasted a better corn dog.  Many thanks!

My kids loved the idea of mommy making home made corn dogs.  They liked them better than the store bought ones. One hint: if the batter isn't staying on the dog then the oil isn't hot enough. I had that problem :)

When I go ready to make these I realized I had no cornmeal!! But I had a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix! So I added mix which wa 1 1/2 c I added 1/2 c of flour and no baking powder because it already had! I followed recipe otherwise!! These turn out great! My family loved them!

This is sooooo good!  I put the hot dogs in the microwave for about 30-45 seconds apiece and then rolled them in some flour which seemed to help the batter adhere.  They were delicious!!!

This is the best corn dog recipe we have tried so far. Instead of adding the milk substitute it with cream style corn. Then I keep a tall glass full of the batter and just dip the dog right down in it. Also before dipping I roll the dog in corn starch first, this helps keep the batter on the dog. Were not big on deep fried foods but this recipe will make me pull the deep fryer off the shelf anytime.
I'll put these corn dogs up against any fair food anytime!

Oh my goodness!!! I've finally found it; the perfect corndog recipe. This takes me back to the county fair and the batter is nice and thick and sticks well(as long as you make sure the dogs are good and dry first). This is definately a keeper, the kids are insisting I make it again tonight and they don't have to twist my arm.

GREAT recipe. This was really easy to make. I used 2 eggs and I did half a batch of veggie dogs, and half a batch of turkey dogs. They both turned out beautifully. A++

Let me say, I loathe corn dogs. Usually. I have never made them at home. I have never had a carnival corn dog because I've only had the frozen ones from the grocery store so I'd just stay away from them. Yuck. I am 7 mos pregnant and had a very strange craving for said item. Make my own popped into my head. Maybe they'll be different. Without a doubt, the best ever.  Gosh they were so good. I left out the pepper and I did refrigerate the batter. I think it is important the batter is cold. While I couldn't outright dip the dogs, it was easy, albeit messy, to coat the dogs with my fingers. Batter stuck perfectly. I noticed that when the batter warmed up, it became runny and was getting more difficult to work with. I would definitely cool the batter. Next time I will skip the tip of putting it into a cup/jar since I had to use my hands anyway. But what a great idea!

WOW!! These came out GREAT!! followed the recipe exact except I left out the pepper. I did cook the dogs for about 5 minutes before though only because they are ball park and I was afraid they would "plump" when I fried them. I had no problem getting the batter to stick to the dogs. I just dried them off real well. I did put the batter in the fridge for about 30 minutes before I dipped and fried. They don't taste exactly like Fair dogs, but they sure do come close!! I thank you and my hubby and kids thank you for such a wonderful recipe!! :)

I'm a vegetarian and used to love corn dogs, I found a protein- hot dog like- substitute which worked perfectly.  My boyfriend and I loved this recipe so much, we plan on making it again! ALSO we cut the dogs up into 5-6 pieces, then breaded, then fried.... soooo good bite size! :)

I have no clue what everyone is talking about when people said the batter is too runny, it was thicker then anything I had to deal with.  dusting the hot dog with flour only made the batter not stick to the dog even more, I had to dry the dogs first.  The batter texture is a 4 stars...the taste is a sure 5! more then a 5, I did add a bit of chili powder just for a bit of a kick.  
These DID NOT last long! My husband and son DEVOURED them, and left me one so I can critic! lol they absolutely loved them! This recipe is a definate keeper, I just gotta figure out how top make this batter a bit more runny

SUPER SUPER easy. Bought bamboo skewers from Walmart. They were pretty long and that worked great for putting the hot dog on them but not for frying them. I ended up cutting them off with a very sharp knife after the hot dog was on. Then battered hot dog and threw dog and skewer in oil. Served these with cheesy tater tots (cook tater tots then shred cheese over them- back in the oven for a minute). Kids said they were much better than Sonic as they were very moist- Sonics are drier.

We used this recipe and sold corn dogs at our local festival.  We had customers come back and tell us that they were the best corn dogs they ever tasted.  Some people even bought more. Cha-ching!

I really enjoyed the batter to this recipe.  It was really tasty. Everyone in my family liked it as well.  I took the advice of the rest of the reviewers and dried the hot dogs and rolled them in flour before dipping them in the batter.  It stuck really well. I will probably make this again.

Excellent! I halved the recipe and made 5 corn dogs.  Also poured batter into a drinking glass to dip my turkey dogs in.   Used popsicle sticks instead of skewers.

Whoa!!  I was CERTAIN that this would have been a disaster but boy was I wrong!  Used exact ratios except made mini corn dogs....without skewers.....using lil smokies (without nitrates).  Oh my....these were soooooooo good!  (oh yeah)  I tested one without first dredging hot dog in flour and though it did ok, I prefer dredging first.  Made the batter stick more consistently.

Great, great recipe!  These are even good to freeze and reheat...actually, they taste better that way if you leave the recipe as is.  The first batch were good, but when they're fresh they're a little grainy because of the corn meal, so I cut the corn meal to 3/4 c and added 1/4 cup corn flour, took out the pepper - it really isn't necessary at all, and added 1 tbsp honey in with the milk and sugar.  (If all you have is self-rising flour, you can use that too - just omit the salt and baking powder.) Then I dried the hot dogs well and rolled them in flour just to be in the safe side.  The batter works best when it's REALLY cold - I mixed it up and stuck it in the freezer until it just started to get icy around the edges, stirred it up really good, and started dipping.  I also used a straight drinking glass to dip the hot dogs.  As far as cooking, I held them vertical in the oil until the batter puffed up, then let them float, turning constantly.  The batter isn't super-thick like the ones you get in the grocery store, and even when they turn dark brown and you think you've burned them, they're still soft and fluffy and absolutely wonderful!

Yep, just like everyone has said: these are just like you get at the state fair! I had batter left over, so I thickened it with some more flour and corn meal and dropped it by spoonfuls into the hot oil. It made some yummy corn fritters!

These classify as better than store-bought but not quite as good as those once-a-year indulgence carnival version corn dogs. Never again will I buy store-bought corn dogs again! I halved the recipe and followed reviewer "MONNIEK" advice...made these into mini corn dogs and not using the skewers. Turned out very good. Thanks Suzzanna for being so creative and then sharing it with the rest of us!

These were the best homemade corndogs I've ever made.  The batter stayed on the dog when I dipped them, and when I fried them.  It also kept a nice shape while frying and didn't run down the sides.  They looked and tasted great!  Thank-you!

Yum, I would do this again.  I had alot of fun with my 3 year old making these.  Next time I will follow other reviewers suggestions and dry the hot dog off, and roll in flour before dipping.  I did have some problems with the batter sticking.

Excellent recipe, we went to a local fair and I REALLY wanted a corn dog, but didnt want to wait in line for 1/2 hour for one.  Came home and made this recipe, came out even better than I could have hoped for.  I did do the half dogs since I was using a fry daddy.  Also used the batter to deep fry mozzarella and cheddar cheese cubes, they were almost better than the corn dogs!

Make sure batter isn't too thick.  Ice cold batter for dipping.

Absolutely perfect. I 1.5x the recipe, so we used two whole eggs instead of 1.5 eggs. These could not possibly have been better. I got rave reviews from absolutely everyone who ate them, including  the vegetarians eating their veggie corndogs!

These are super easy and super yummy. My kids love them. I do have a hard time getting the batter to stay on. It also does not come out looking as pretty as I would like! Definitely a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe!

Big Thumbs up from the whole family and even the kids I babysat! I actually found the batter easier to work with when it wasn't ice cold, when the batter was really cold it seemed even thicker

My family loved these!! I cooked the dogs slightly first but everything else was to the letter. I had no problems with the batter coming off. Make sure that your oil is nice and hot.

I made these for my boyfriend, and he loved them. I tried a bite, and next time I won't add salt to the batter, because the franks we used were salty enough. I didn't have any trouble getting the batter to stick after rinsing and drying the hot dogs. Luckily, I forgot to halve the recipe for eight dogs, because this was just enough batter for eight plus an experiment frying a slice of pepperjack cheese (would have been better with cheddar).

I took the advise of another viewer and put the batter in a tall drinking glass and it worked great. These were so good, my family ate them all up! They have just the right amount of sweetness to the batter. Thanks for sharing.

I thoght they were really good but if you use the 6th serving recipie use 2 tablespoons more of flour because the coating was runny, but other than that they were really good.Also don't put the skewers in until they've finished cooking.

My husband and 13 year old son just made these for dinner tonight....YUMMY!!  Did not change a thing...used the tip from the reviewer who said to dry the hotdogs off before coating them.  They were terrific with a honey mustard dressing we also found at AllRecipes.  Thanks!

I made the batter the night before and the next day it was a little too thick for me to apply on the hotdogs.  I added a little more milk and got a creamy mixture.  After that it was smooth.  These corndogs was a great treat for my husband and my kids and I for one will never buy another frozen corndog again.  This is way cheaper and healther to make it yourself. Will make it again and again.

My son's birthday is around fair time here in New Mexico and our favorite thing to get at the state fair is green chile corn dogs!  We did get one at the state fair, but then his birthday came up and he requested green chile corn dogs for his birthday dinner.  Well, I found this recipe and omitted the black pepper and added 1/2 c. of chopped New Mexico green chiles!  We loved them and my son and hubby thought these were way better than the ones we get at the fair!  Thanks for this yummy and easy recipe!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and while I enjoyed them I felt like there was too much corn in the batter (I didn't want to feel as much of the corn as I did). Next time I might cut down in the corn and I'll also let the batter sit for awhile before using it to see if that helps.

This is a great recipe!  My kids loved it and ate 3 each.  As per the other suggestions, I tried to dry them with paper towels, and the batter adhered a little better.  Then, I dried them, then rolled them into flour and that did the trick.  Yes, it does make a lot of batter.  You can easily cut it in half (using the whole egg).  I took the left over batter, added some more flour and corn meal (-eye balling it to make a thicker dough) and then some minced onion, 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper more to the batter and made hush puppies.  The kids have already asked if they can be made again.

Wow! Nutritional slumming at its best.  These were perfect.  I used foster farms turkey franks and the only thing I would change would be to cut the milk down to 3/4 cup because my batter would slide off the dogs, too wet.

These turned out perfect. My 13 yr. old daughter thought I was crazy for making homemade corn dogs, but after she tried them she wanted to know when we were having them again. No more store bought corn dogs for this family.

i've tried others, and truly this one is the best.  i too cut them in half, then dipped into batter to fry.  my first half turned out perfectly, but, then my batter started to slip off.  i think, and i may be wrong, but next time, i'm going to make sure i'm not dipping anything other than a clean utensil,into the batter to pick up the dogs.  that way, the batter stays clean also, when the oil cools down due to cooking, the batter slips so make sure you don't cram too many dogs into your oil.  our new favorite corn dog recipe - thanks!

These were very good.  Will keep this recipe.  My four year old LOVED them.  I cut lite hot dogs (hey- - -it has to help some!) in half and dipped them in the batter.  They fried up like mini corndogs.  Of course, my son had to stick a stick in them to eat them, but that was no problem after they were cooked, and it was easier to fry with no skewer.  Also tried mozzarella cheese stick sections--good, but a little sweet for that.

With a few changes due to the ingredients I had on hand these were really great. To the dry mixture I added baking soda and to the wet I eliminated the egg, used buttermilk and threw in a can of creamed corn. Pouring the mixture into a drinking glass made it much easier to dip the dogs, but please make sure you coat your them with the corn starch or the batter will slip right off.  Our deep fryer worked wonderfully, however, after the franks were out I asked hubby to re-dip and fry again to give them a nice thick and crispy coating. They were great Suzzanne and happily much like we recently had at our N.J. State Fair!!!

Kids and Grandkids loved these corn dogs, said they were the best they have ever had. I really liked them too, they didn't seem as greasy as a lot I have tried. Fast and easy recipe too. Had all ingredients in the house.

Thanks!  Love corndogs and my wife and kids loved them too.  Only diference is I put the batter in a tall plastic container/cup and refridgerated a couple hours befor coating the hotdogs.  The batter sticks well. No need to flour hotdogs just dry with paper towel and stick in refridgerator a couple hours. I used canola oil instead. Vegtable oil is very bad for you and has a lower smoke point. Used bread flour and purchased a narrow tall pan so I could use less oil. A winner receipe.

This so far is the best recipe I have found, but I did have to modify it immediately. First, it calls for 1 cup of milk. Batter was way to thick. So I had to add an additional 1/2 cup and then thru out the fry another tbsp every now and then to keep it easy to coat. I didn't have any white sugar so I substituted brown instead and liked it, altho next time I think I will try honey. Lastly instead of the salt it called for I used 1 full tsp of my homemade house seasoning for extra flavor. I also heated my hotdogs up but as another reviewer suggested I did make sure the outside was completely dry before dipping them. I didn't even need to use flour or cornstarch to make the batter stick. It coated easily and stayed on while frying. They were so good! Even my picky child who normally hates corndogs ate TWO! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Yum!  This is easy, quick, and a tasty corn dog batter recipe.  I left out the pepper (laziness, but I didn't miss it) and didn't fry but actually used my corn dog maker that I got recently.  Yes, I know, it says to fry but although I love corn dogs (it's weird bc I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs or corn muffins, but I do love some corn dogs), I don't like fried foods much.  They literally make me sick to my stomach, so if I can find a way to bake something instead of frying, I will. At any rate, this batter was versatile enough to work in a corn dog maker and the corn dogs turned out well.  Thanks for the recipe!

These corn dogs were amamzing!! My entire family loved them, taste just like the kind you get at a carnival, actually better!! Made me think if my childhood again and that was a loooong time ago. Can't wait to make them again, this time I will make 3 a piece I could have just kept eating them. So crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Thank you so much.

After many year of failed attempts, this recipe was GREAT!  I ran a little low on batter, and added a bit of milk to stretch it out.

My 4 year old had a great time helping prepare and consume these! Had a quiche in the oven, wanted to make something that she'd really like. It was perfect! We had everything on hand. I recalculated the recipe to 2 and they came out perfect. Wouldn't change a thing

Excellent batter. Make sure the hot dogs are really dry before trying to coat. 

I turned the leftover batter into hush puppies. YUM!

This was my first attempt to make corn dogs.  My husband remembered his mom making them when he was growing up.  These were so easy and tasted great!  I must admit that I was skeptical; however, I will definitely make these again.

I never knew that making homemade corn dogs would be so easy or so yummy.  I cut my wooden skewers and hot dogs in half so that they would fit in my skillet.  The only problem I had was getting the batter to stick, even though I did toss them with some flour first.  It just took a little extra work to shape the batter around the dog.  I only had 4 hot dogs, so that left a ton of batter.  This made some fantastic hush puppies - by adding diced peppers, onion and shredded cheddar cheese.  Drop by spoonfuls into the hot oil and they flip over when done on the bottom.  Delicious!

I made the batter exactly as the recipe was written, and used cut up hotdogs for mini corn dogs.  It was excellent, my guests loved them.  Will make this recipe again and again.  Many thanks for sharing!

I have never made corn dogs before, and this recipe was so easy and utilized everything that I had on hand.  Took other reviewers advice and dried the hot dogs well before dipping in the batter that I refrigerated for 30 min.  My husband, who was skeptical when he saw that I was making them said that they are better than the ones at the fair!

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I had to make two batches because I kept eating them before I could set them out.  On the second batch I cut the sugar in half, just my own preference.  When I ran out of hot dogs, I threw in some chopped onion and jalepenos and fried me up a batch of hush puppies.  It was a little sweet for the hush puppies but they were of a texture(light and fluffy) that I have been seeking.  Definitely will use this recipe again for Corndogs and Hush Puppies!  TY!

I'm no corn dog connoiseur, but very easy & kids loved 'em!  I very rarely eat hot dogs, but ate this with honey, mustard, & ketchup.  Used mason jar to dip & refrigerated batter prior to use & dried off hot dogs to help it stick.  Rotated hot dog with batter in frying pan of hot oil; done in less than a minute.  Very fun to do with kids & watch puff up:)  Oh, did not use pepper.

My daughter loves corn dogs. My son hats corn dogs and I will eat them but.... Now these ones my daughter, son and myself loved them. My son ate the whole thing and wanted more but he was full. 

I tried to add the flour to the wiener first but it didn't work. I tried batter in the jar and it did work for a few but once the batter goes down it gets to hard to work with. I then did the batter on the plate with mixed results. Will I make these again. Oh yes.

Made this tonight for my husband and our friend. Husband doesn't like corn dogs so he doesn't count. My friend raved that it tastes just like a "real" corn dog. I thought it was delicious. Use a glass to hold the batter for dipping the hot dogs. If your oil isn't hot enough, the batter will come off. If it's too hot, they will burn. There's no secret to getting the batter to stick, just get your oil temperature right and be sure to dry the hot dogs well. Next time I may try grilling the hot dogs first just because I do like a grilled hot dog so much better. I'm not interested in authentic, I'm interested in what tastes good and what tastes good to me are grilled hot dogs.

Great Recipe! Use a tall glass for batter to make it easier to dip.  Turn/spin hot dot slightly when removing from batter to make a more even coating.  Use good quality hot dogs for best results.  We use Nathan's brand.

These taste EXACTLY like the corn dogs you get at the fair, carnival, etc. (maybe even better!) My modifications were no black pepper, switched the sugar for honey, and fried mine in coconut oil - SO GOOD! I did take the advice of using a candy thermometer because I noticed they either cook REALLY quick or really slow. Please try these, you won't be disappointed!

These are super easy and taste awesome.  I had no problems getting the batter to stick.  Just make sure the dogs are dry.  Slowly put them in oil to allow the batter to set. I recommned using the deepest vessel possible to fry them in and make sure the oil is 350 degrees.  Great recipe!

Quick and delicious! I rolled my first few in flour but then found it was not needed the batter was thick enough that it held it's grip on the hot dogs. I did add a little bit of extra sugar one T of honey and 1/4 cup more water and a dash of dry mustard my whole family said these were much better than any store bought brand. They were faster to make from start to finish that to bake the store bought one's. Thanks for a wonderful Recipe!

Huge hit with the kids!  I made this last night and everyone gobbled it up.  I made the batter one hour ahead of time and popped it in the fridge.  It allowed it to thicken up and was easier to work with.  Per another recipe I read, I replaced milk with a cup of cheap beer (alcohol cooks off).  Will use this recipe again and again.

Overall these were pretty good.  I never thought I'd hear me saying this, but technique is critical here if you want to have nice golden corn dogs.  I took the advice of others who reviewed this by rolling the dogs in cornstarch, and cooling the batter down in the freezer.  Soon as my batter warmed up, I started losing batter.  I also recommend highly a top quality beef dog.  I used a combo of beef and your standard wiener, and the beef was at least twice as good.

Wow these taste like the real thing!  I recently made these for an outdoor movie night.  I used the mini "smokie" weiners for bite sized snacking.  I was able to use 1 1 /2 packages of weiners for the written recipe.  These went faster than I could fry them.  Luckily I ate a few while making them or else I wouldn't have gotten one otherwise.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

These turned out great and were easy to make! I poured the batter into a tall cup which made it easy to coat the hot dogs.  I took other peoples advice and used the remaining batter for fritters. We added some sweet corn to some and used powdered sugar on the plain fritters. What a treat.

This was an awesome recipe- my kids pounded them.  I didn't have to coat the hot dogs at all before I dipped them and to make it more "kid friendly", so they wouldn't poke each other, I just cut the hot dogs in half and dipped them in the batter.  I don't think I will be buying corn dogs anymore, these are much better!  Thank you for this recipe.

These were great, I cut the hot dogs in half and used a popsicle stick, I also used the idea other person had and that was to roll the hot dogs in corn starch before coating them in batter. Oh and I used a tall glass as suggested and it worked great, the batter got a little thick so I thinned it with just a touch of water, so as to make the hot dog be able to go into the batter better. My husband just loved them as did I...thanks for the recipe.

Much better than the frozen ones!  A little time consuming and not very good for you though, so this will probably be more of a treat than a regular meal.

Pretty darn good! I made mini corn dogs since i didn't have any skewers and have a 19 month old. I used honey instead of sugar. To make it easier i used tooth picks and took them out after they were fried. Since I'm only cooking for myself and my son right now (hubby deployed) There were quite a few left so they went into a freezer bag once cooled and froze. I only got one package of hot dogs out of the batter.

Suzzanna, I won't even bother looking for any other recipe for corn dogs. This recipe is absolutely fantastic and authentic! 

I also learned a couple things while making this recipe. 1) the sugar is absolutely essential lol. I went a bit light on the sugar, and while it was good, I won't skimp on the sugar again. 

2) Golden Bread Crumbs are a great substitute for the corn meal. The first couple of times I made this recipe, I didn't have corn meal on hand, so I used "Golden Bread Crumbs" instead. I used a less sugar while making this recipe with bread crumbs though.

I wish I could give this recipe a higher rating than 5 stars - You really deserve a higher rating. Thank you for a great recipe!

These were GREAT! The kids just loved them! I was lucky to even get to try them! The best part was I could make them out of quality all beef hotdogs instead of only the junk that is available in the stores!

Great recipe!!! I found I like the batter thicker.  The thinner the batter the thinner the out come of the crust on the dog.  Overall I love this recipe and will use over and over again. THANKS!!!

This was tasty and fairly easy to work with. I did have trouble getting it to stick to the dog, but I suppose that's normal. I froze them for quick snacks for my husband. Mine turned out a lot prettier than the ones in the picture, too.

This was excellent. My husband and kids loved it. I made a gluten free version using our special flours. Otherwise we did everything as stated. I had to add a little bit more liquid because our flour made it a bit thick. Two thumbs up!

Amazing!!!! this is my second time making corn dogs, but these are way better than the ones i'd tried before. I was a bit hesitant at first. You can't have corn dogs in my country and  my mom is such a picky eater when it comes to try new dishes ....but this was a hit!!!! She's still raving about them, lol.
Made mini corn dogs and coated them in cornstarch before dipping into the batter. Definitely a keeper!! Thanx for the recipe Suzzanna!

This recipe wasn't as fabulous as other reviewers claimed it to be.  Although it was a good recipe, it doesn't deserve 5 stars.  

I definitely recommend boiling the hot dogs first to ensure they are thoroughly cooked prior to frying.  

Although I don't feel it is necessary, you can coat the hot dogs in cornstarch prior to dipping in the batter (I did, but I don't believe it made a difference - so long as you dry the hot dogs properly).

Wonderful bit of redneck cuisine! Hubby loved it.  I cut the dogs up into bite size pieces and rolled them in the mix, then deep fried them.  To make sure they were done just right, I microwaved the dogs for about 1 minute before put them in the batter and fried them....our new favorite!

I have made these many times and my family insists these corn dogs are better than the commercial ones.  I've tried the suggestion of lightly dusting the wieners with cornstarch to get the coating to stick, but it was very messy and unnecessary.  I found that simply blotting the wieners on paper towels to remove any excess moisture works the best.

I have used this recipe several times.  In the past I had always bought the frozen cordogs in the grocery store but since moving to the middle east I had to find a recipe.  I have made it excactly like the recipe each and every time and have never been disapointed.  It helps to let the hot dogs sit out for a little while on some paper towels to reduce the moisture and then dip and fry.  My whole family loves then even my very picky father and daughter.  I wrap the extras in foil and freeze then reheat one at a time in the microwave slowly on defrost.  Great recipe!!! Also works well with cocktail franks for little fingers.

I gave them 5 stars because they took care of my corn dog craving and they can be great little party snacks served with regular or different types of mustards. Just use cocktail wieners or cut your hot dogs in half for appetizers.
One way I got the batter to stay on better was to dip the hot dog in a little egg. Some of the batter still slid back into the bowl, but it wasn't too bad.
These corn dogs actually looked like something from the fairs at home and they tasted pretty good too.
Word of advice, I accidently salted a couple of them since I always salt things after frying. It was too salty and took the corn dog flavor away. 
Thanks for the recipe!!!

very delicious! thank you! i didn't have a hard time with the batter- it's so easy.  i did however boil the hot dogs first and i bought pork/beef franks and then cut them into 3 pieces each (mini) - refrigerated the batter with the cooled off franks already in the batter. for about a half hour. removed the franks a lightly dipped them in some flour, corn meal set aside (if the batter is too thick to work with add some milk at this point.)  we loved them! you must scoop the batter holding the frank long wise then lift and swirl and immediatly plunk into fryer (fry daddy)
we only fried for a few minutes. also, i like white pepper so i added alot- as much as the baking powder and added fresh ground pepper and lawrey's original flavored salt-little and believe it or not japanese salt/pepper combo (it's different and it seasons meat well) you can only get it from a japanese store. the brand i love to use has a green stripe with characters and a little red stripe with two characters- the picture has a beef kabob with corn and peppers and zuchinni.  this is a long review - but i bet not too many of you have found it yet!! it makes everything taste great! especially on beef and we all like teriyaki?! try it ! it's the bansankan brand and the ingredients are: salt, pepper, glucose(corn),bread crumbs, starch(corn),msg and sugar. anyway, the combo of spices seems to work i also used a little more sugar. i guess the double dipping and working with the batter helped a lot.  i make many d

Suzzanna you are my hero! I LOVE THESE CORNDOGS!!! Fantastic. I've already had a request for more and it's up for our memorial day family get together. This was the first meal in months that my entire family raved about it and wanted more. People were claiming leftovers for lunch and snack. Thanks you so much! This was great! I can't rave about it anymore. Even my boyfriend is wanting to try them. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

I was very happy with the flavor.  I would have liked a specific idea of fry time, my first batch ended up  over done and very greasy, so fry time is something like 5 seconds on each side, drain on paper towels and place in ziplock bag to steam and keep breading soft.  Also, I ran my cornmeal in my blender for about 5 minutes on high to make it a finer texture for my second batch and was especially pleased with the results...(don't use a food processor, it needs to me a blender) Kids loved it, I will never buy them from the store again! (Freeze leftovers for later, if there are any...)

This is a very straightforward and basic corn dog recipe that will not let you down. I've tried a variety of batters recently, and this one is a great base. I added honey and some other spices for some "bam" and it was great.

Soon we'll all be fat at our house, thanks!

This was such a good recipe! Everything turned out delicious. The corn dogs didn't need any condiments, but it was delicious with mustard. I tried cutting the hot dogs in half and using toothpicks since I didn't have skewers. Worked out great and looked like fun little appetizers or kids size corn dogs. I also used little smokies, which had a different flavor and tasted great!

Fill a cup with the batter, then dip them in. It coats them the best. We used a deep frier and they were amazing.

we did a carnival night w/this recipe and a cotton candy maker. kids enjoyed the corn dogs, though we did add a couple more tablespoons of flour since the dough didn't appear thick enough to stick.  has a nice hint of sweetness and easy enough for kids to help make.

Great!  I placed the batter in the fridge for about 10 minutes. Batter seemed a little thick but it worked out great. No drippy messes like the others I have tried. This ones a keeper!

Took the recipe and (x4) it. Placed in fridge overnight. Had to add a bit more milk in the morning and made over 60 corn dogs for a kids birthday party... People freaked. It was so pro and the taste was perfect. I used a butchers hotdog with no fillers, nitrates or additives and it was the hit of the party (until the ice cream truck I called showed up).

Tips:
• Get a oil thermometer - keep oil between 350 - 370
• I used my side burner on the BBQ with a huge pot - no smell of a carnival in the house
• Get long skewers - easier to control
• Get the jumbo Dogs and cut in half - the cook easier and are more manageable
• Dry dogs with a paper towel and coat with corn starch and flour mixture and shake off access - batter sticks perfectly
• Make batter COLD - it will coat perfectly
• Use a LARGE TALL GLASS make dipping and coating simple and easy to control

ALSO - flash freeze and then place into a ziplock bag for storage

Made as written, didn't work out at all- batter fell off even after drying and flouring. Flavor wasn't anything special either.

I live in Peru, where corn dogs are unheard of, so these were a real treat. My roommate said they taste just like Sonic's corndogs. I cut the hotdogs in half making them into mini corndogs so that I could use less oil and still have them completely submerged. I nuked the hotdogs for about 20 seconds before dipping them in the batter, just to make sure they would be warm inside. I also made sure they were completely dry before dipping in the batter, and had no problems with the batter falling off.

OMG!!!! I made these for lunch and they were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut it in half.  I like a lot of batter so half of the recipe coated 4 Bun length Oscar Meyer hot dogs. I have a deep fryer (heated to 365), and these came out perfectly and were very fast to make...only took about 20 minutes total (the longest part was waiting for the oil to heat up to 365). I did not coat the dogs in flour or corn starch as other reviewers suggested but I did use a paper towel to dry the dogs first and had no trouble with getting the batter to stick. I will be making these again!

These are great.  Used the exact ingredient measurements, no alterations, allowed weiners to cool to room temp well rolled in corn starch and voila, perfect corndogs.

This recipe tastes just like the ones from the store! The hot dogs need to be dried and rolled in flour before dipping into the batter, and putting the batter in a jar is a great idea! Makes it so much easier.

It tasted alright, but the directions aren't very well, the batter doesn't stick well to the hot dogs (even if you roll them in flour), and I don't see how you cooked them for 3 minutes, mine burned in less than a minute.

This is a favorite at our house. Some people have complained about the batter not sticking, but I'm careful not to add too much milk and it sticks fine so long as the batter is thick. I like to cut the wienies in half and make mini dogs.

This was first time making corndogs.  They came out perfect!  Per a few reviewers, I did cook hotdogs first, dried them, then rolled in flour before dunking in batter.  With leftover batter, we added diced onion, cajun seasoning and made hush puppies.  Those wre excellent, too!  Thank you for posting and thank you to all reviwers who add in!

These are really good, but not as sweet as the Foster Farm Corn dogs so if you are looking for sweeter ones, I would add a bit of honey to the batter. I skipped the skewer cause my frying pan was to small and no one seemed to notice or care. These do not take much to to make at all and are well worth the effort.

My son wanted corn dogs.  I was prepared to just buy the unhealthy frozen ones but couldn't find any!  So I gave this a try.  It came out great!  I didn't have a deep fryer so I just used a big heavy saucepan.  The only thing I'd do different is cut them in half so they'd fit in my pan better! 
Also I'll play around with different types of healthy hot dogs.  Yum!

My wife is intolerant to gluten, milk and egg yolks. I used Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose gluten-free flour instead of regular flour, about 1/3 cup egg whites instead of the egg, about 2 tsp of honey in addition to the sugar, and 1 1/2 - 2 cups of almond milk instead of regular milk. I also added 2 tsp of xanthum gum to the recipe. The wife loves corn dogs and she was in total heaven when I made them, since she hasn't had one in quite a while. I cut up a vidallia onion into slices and made onion rings with the left-over batter, another BIG hit! I had half-a dozen tsp of batter left and just spooned the batter into the oil, making little hush puppies. They were absolutely delicious. The teenage boy said they tasted like donuts! They had a donut texture with a hint of "Cap'n Crunch" flavor. Thanks for the great base recipe!

I used rice flour because my husband has celiac but these were great!  I added just a little more milk.  They were too dry at first but once I thinned it down a little, they were awesome.  5 stars!  Even my kids ate them and they do t like anything.

I used chicken viennas and rolled them in flour as was suggested, I also used the batter in a glass method which was a total life saver. This recipe is fantastic and I have already made it twice for my family in South Africa to taste what a real corn dog tastes like.
They are always met with much approval and gobbled up straight away

Have made these several times.  I cut the hotdogs into thirds and it makes it easier to fry.  They end up like mini corn dogs and the kids love them.

No pepper in mine either.I really love this recipe though. It's quick and simple, and using the drinking glass as dip container worked really well. 
I like my cornmeal with honey, so I decreased the sugar by a few tablespoons and added the honey to the mix.  Will never ever buy frozen again. Why would you if in the same amount of time you can have fresh homemade ones that taste as good as these do.  Boyfriend raved, I raved.   Wonderful!!!! 
***here's a fun "plus" to this recipe. If you have leftover batter (since I only do 1 pkg of dogs for the two of us).  Drop the batter by tablespoons into the hot oil watch closely, turn over when tanned on one side, tan on other.... shake these little puppies in powdered sugar or cinn/sugar to coat after draining. Not bad dessert donuts!****
I've made these like above for awhile now, found myself without honey, decided to add 2T food grade coconut oil(didn't melt it, just mixed with fork with the flour,cornmeal and b.soda before adding egg and milk) This made the coating have a very slight coconut flavor which was nice, but the real benefit was that the coating was crisper and lighter. I'll be doing this again I think.

We have had these a few times now.  We love the taste of them but the one thing we're having trouble with is that they end up like little paddles.  We can't get them to have the regular corn dog shape.  Hopefully we figure that out!

Good Flavor.The batter does fall off in the fryer.  However, I will take other suggestions to roll them in starch or flour to keep the batter from falling off.

I LOVED it!   And my kids LOVED it!  This is a new Fam Fave!  And I dropped the leftover batter in the oil to make deep fried corn bread.  Mmmmm....  Thanks for the brilliant recipe!

Very good!  I agree with other reviews about drying the dogs well before adding the batter.  No cornstarch or flour needed.  Also, the batter goes on better if it is cold.  Make it a few hours ahead and keep in the fridge until ready to fry.  I used a deepfryer and fried two at a time.  We will definately make this recipe again!

MMMMMM is all I can say!  I had been craving a good corn dog for awhile and this recipe did not disappoint.  I did find it just a little thick but I just added a little bit more milk and the batter coated nicely.  Will definitely be making these again.

This was great with the flour rolling method. The first time I tried it with just drying, as recommended by the former carnie, and the dough fell off in the fryer. Also, the corn meal was a bit crunchier than I think it should have been: next time I'll try scalding the milk, mixing it into the cornmeal, and letting it cool before mixing the rest in.

Really good!  we made it as described, except we halved it.  These came out awesome!  Kids loved em, as well as the adults!  

Some one came in while I was frying them, and asked for onion rings to go with them.  I had onions but didn't want to make another batter and all that, so I decided to try using the already prepared corn dog batter, just for fun.
Turns out, everyone said (including me) they were the best onion rings they ever had!  I was shocked!  I just cut onions into rings, lightly dipped them into the batter and fried them quickly... the corn dog batter makes a slightly puffy coating, so even a tiny bit on the onion, after frying, makes a nice coating.  It is very slightly crunchy with that wonderful softer inside.... and the slightly sweet batter compliments the onions perfectly!

I will make this batter for several things now... but the actual hot dogs fried in it is fantastic.
This batter fry's up really fast too.  So easy and satisfying.

thanks for this, my son is a corn dog NUT, and we always have to buy the frozen ones in the market, which are around $17.99 for a case of 12!  No more wasted money, since my kids think these are so much better than any frozen ones we have tried so far.

Tastes perfect.  I didn't think it needed more sweetness, but I will try the honey version next time.  I made many mistakes with this dish and I'm ready to save you some headaches.  I tried to cut down the serving size and still use the whole egg which was not a good idea.  Chilling the batter first made a HUGE difference in it not dripping.  I poured the batter in a tall glass.  I tried all 3 methods of getting the batter to stick to the dog (dry the dog, corn starch & flour)....simply drying the dog worked best.  I also recommend using tongs if you are frying in a pan.  Make sure your oil is 375 degrees and cook thoroughly or it will be gooey in the middle.  I used the leftover batter to make fritters.  I served with sweet baby carrots on allrecipes.

I love this recipe. Definantly will make again. I suggest that you roll the hot dogs in flour or cornmeal beforehand though like some other users have suggested because the batter does tend not stick to the hot dog when fried. otherwise, its a pretty good recipe. easy to make and easy to deep fry. i like it=]

We made these for dinner last night, both my kids (hubby and actual) loved them. :) I however, would have liked a little more sweetness in the batter.  I added probably another 1/4 cup of sugar and it still wasn't sweet enough for me. I intend on making them again tweaking the sweetness level to my liking. Maybe by using honey??  Overall though, it was a great recipe and we were pleasantly surprised at how well they came out. I omitted the salt; hot dogs are salty enough I figured.

These turned out more like hushpuppie consistency on my hot dogs. However the flavor was beyond amazing. I used egg sub and vegan hot dogs. However it just occured to me this could be the reason for the consistency issue. Had I read the reviews I would have gotten my batter super cold first. Thanks these were great.

I would give this recipe 5 for taste but only 4 for ingredients and 4 for crispiness. Everything went great with the whole process except i did dry off the hot dogs and coat them in flour and still hard a hard time getting the batter to stick so I had to add about another 1/4 cup milk to thin it down since the batter was way to thick. After doing this i had a little bit easier time getting it to stick to the hot dogs however it still had to be rolled several times with my fingers to coat. They cooked nicely and came out tasting light and fluffy and airy but after sitting for about 5 minutes they became soggy. It wasnt necessarily a bad thing because they still tasted great but definately not a recipe for someone who likes crsipy corn dogs. And yes i had them at a high temp in the deep fryer. I also cut these into mini dogs for the kids, they loved them :)

My fiance and I made these and they were delicious. The family loved them. I took a reviewers advice and rolled the dogs in flour before coating, after making the batter pour it into a cup for easy dipping, and add honey to the batter! These were the best corn dogs I ever had and the family agreed! Will definitely make again!

Great recipe and very yummy.  I did what everyone in comments suggested and I coated the dogs with corn starch and put the batter in the freezer for a little bit.  Worked out very well.

I made them for a Halloween party and they were a hit.I took the suggestions of others and refrigerated the batter first and then thinned it just a bit with milk.I also left the pepper out.I cut my hot dogs in half first then just dropped a few at a time into the batter and rolled them around until they were well coated.I had to adjust my heat a bit because it was too hot at first and they burned on the outside. Once I got the heat right they came out so delicious.They were really good the next day reheated in the oven too. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I used vegetarian frankfurters, whole wheat pastry flour and raw sugar.  I cannot believe how delicious they were.  They remain junk food, but at least I won't be feeling the high energy followed by the crash that white flour and white sugar can give you.  Only if you had tasted it with white flour before would you notice the difference between the two.  100 times better than a Pogo.

My family loves these! I usually try to avoid deep fat frying, but this is one time we bend the rules. (Of course, we have to do the fries that way, too....) I finally learned that I don't need a thick coat of batter on there. I kept trying it that way, only to have most of it come off in the oil. I dry the dogs with a paper towel, and just kind of slather it on, and it works!

Yummm...scaled recipe to 24 servings to make 36 mini corndogs (huge hot dogs cut into thirds).  Very hard to get a consistent layer on the dogs, but worth the effort.  They were absolutely the best corn dogs I have ever had.  The kids and hubby agreed.

Great recipe! Tried it today and it was perfect! I dried the hot dogs with paper towel while the batter was in the freezer chilling (it only took a few minutes). It stuck to the dogs without any problems and it stayed on perfectly during frying (I didn't coat them in flour or corn starch like other reviewers suggested). The corn dogs looked and tasted super yummy. My family gobbled the whole batch up within minutes. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I don't like corndogs, so I didn't have any. My husband loves corndogs but can't eat them because he has a sodium nitrate allergy. So this recipe was perfect cause I could make him corndogs using all natural hotdogs. I followed the recipe pretty much, I didn't use pepper, and I added a bit of garlic. I froze the batter for about 10 minutes. I dried the hotdogs and rubbed flour on them first. I also cooked them at 365 degrees. I've never fried before, but these turned out perfect. I think there might not be quite enough batter, as the last few I made I was just barely able to cover, but that might just be my newbiness showing. I used the dip them in a cup thing, and it was very hard to get the last bit at the bottom of the cup. My husband loves them a LOT. I plan to freeze the rest for him to have for lunch for the next few days. Thanks for this wonderful recipe, he's the happiest man alive right now.

These are really good and so fun! My fiance and I have an electric fryer that we like to break out when we're feeling extra unhealthy and these are our favorite fried delicacy. Corn dogs are not just for kids you know! We like to use buffalo hot dogs and they are fantastic in the corn dogs.

These were good and surprisingly easy to make! I just dried the hot dogs with a paper towel - no flour or corn starch needed.  I believe my oil was a little on the hot side at 375 (I fry everything at 375).  They browned too quickly so I will definitely lower it to approx 365 as someone else suggested.  Even at 375 they still came out wonderful.

This was good! I halved the recipe to 8 servings, and used one package of hotdogs. I tried to just dry the hotdogs, but found that a light coat of cornstarch seemed to help the batter stick so much better. I made mini corndogs, let them cool and put them in the freezer for next week lunches. Thanks for the post!! ***UPDATE*** I have made two batches of these for the freezer....I will NEVER buy frozen corndogs again! I pop a couple in the microwave then put them under the broiler for a couple minutes to crisp up the breading. My daughter loves them! FABULOUS!

I have made these twice now and the first time they were perfect pretty as a picture but the second time I didn't have time to chill my batter as long and I had problems with it running off in the oil some before it started to fry up. I also took the suggestion of another a review and just for fun the second time I used the cheapest hotdogs out there and it did give them a more geniune carnival taste although I prefered them made with the higher cost and quality hotdogs. For sure the secrect to success is chilling the batter in the freezer till it is very cold and thick. I also used a tall glass to dip in. A little patience and you will be pleased with the result.

Great recipe, however, I didn't use as many hotdogs. The batter that was left over I grabbed a can of corn and fried up some corn nuggets!  Yummy! Will use this recipe again. Thank you for sharing.

I used jalapeno cheddar franks and turkey dogs--fantastic!!  A few tips: make the batter as cold as possible by putting in the freezer 10-20 minutes; pat dogs dry so batter will stick; a drinking glass works well for dipping the dogs; I had the heat on my electric stove barely on med-hi, just past medium for perfect doneness (my thermometer is broken); I fried one until just browned, then froze it, then nuked it on defrost for a minute to heat the inside and then put it under the broiler to crisp it up--just as good the second time around.  No need to buy store-bought ever again.

These were ok. I think it was way to much baking poweder in the recipe.  The breading was to puffy, I prefer a denser breading for a corn dog.  I may try to make again reducing the baking powder down to 2 teaspoons.

I only made 1/2 a recipe because I only made 8 dogs (I still had enough batter left over to make at least one maybe 2 more). Here is what I did for preparation. I set the hot dogs out about 30 minutes early and dried them off. I lightly coated them with flour and then dipped them. I also had made the dipping batter about 1 hour in advance to have it good and cold so that it did not run so freely. I used my deep fryer and left it set on 400 degrees. They had to cook about 4 minutes with me constantly flipping and holding them in position in order to brown them evenly. They came out great. The batter stuck nicely and the flavor was good. I froze one of them just to see how it would turn out.  Frozen, they were much like the ones you buy in the store.  I microwaved it so it was not crispy, but a toaster oven would have crisped it up nicely. I would probably also add a little extra sugar because I like mine a little sweeter, but everyone else who ate them said they were fine.  Honey might also be good in replacement of half of the sugar.  They were great though and much cheaper than the store bought ones.  I will definitely make them again.

Wow!  My husband and I, and our 1-year old baby, enjoyed every bite of these!!  I used turkey dogs cause that's what I just happened to have, and I fried them in lard (manteca).  The batter was light and crispy.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe that we'll use every time!

These were really good corn dogs.  I dried the room-temp dogs before dipping and had no problems with the batter sticking or sliding off.  Came out very smooth and golden brown as well. I was only able to get 10 hot dogs covered with some batter remaining.  The flavor, while much better than frozen, lacks some depth and seems a bit fluffier than those from the carnival.  Next time, I will use a bit less baking powder and sub season salt for the salt as well in an attemp to rectify those issues.  PS-the leftover batter makes fantastic hush puppies when you add a bit of onion and some "heat" and fry them.

Whew! I'm full! I just got finished making and eating 'circus' food! This was a geat recipe,only next time I would omit one thing,the corn dog recipe didn't need sugar in it so that will be left out,will probaly put garlic powder in place. And my suggestion to some reviewers who had trouble with the batter,okay,at first I tried seperating the flour from the cornmeal but I quickly found out that I had to add them together to make the cornmeal stick and after you dip them in batter,roll them again in the cornmeal,it really does help! All in all,this was a really good recipe! My son said 'Pretty good mom' Wow! hehe

very good ~ didn't fry on skewers; instead cut hot dogs into small pieces, dipped in batter and dropped into oil

Sounds crazy, but I had a dream about corn dogs and since I didn't have any frozen ones, I decided to make them and they came out wonderfully. I didn't have any skewers, but that didn't matter. I added a couple extra seasonings - garlic powder, red pepper, and some italian seasoning to kick them up a bit for my own taste. They came out great!

Quite a good recipe, a little sweet for me but still works. I did as some of the other reviewers have suggested and only used 3/4 cup milk, i think it were any more watery it wouldn't stick. I also dredged my items in cornstarch first ( or cornflour in the UK) I cooked my stuff in the deep fryer at 190c. I also tried it with cheddar cheese and processed cheese in place of the hotdog. DH never had one before and loved them,reminded me of the cheese on a stick stand. Only down side is even with the cornflour it was hard to get the batter to stick so be careful. I also dipped the dogs in and held on to them for 30 seconds before I dropped them so they wouldn't stick to the basket. Good luch and enjoy. p.s It was a little sweet for me, so next time I will half the sugar. Will make it again though.

These are some delicious hot dogs.I did cooked them for 6 minutes but i didn't really let them cool properly i dip them in a cornstarch flour mixture so the batter would stick on them.But that didn't really work and maybe that is because my hotdogs was not cool enough  so i just rolled the corndog batter into the rest of the cornstarch mixture.I did add honey to the batter.I'ts my own fault i just couldn't wait untill they cool but they where still good next time i will be patient.In let the hotdog rest at least 10 minutes before i start my dipping of the batter.

These were good. I used honey in place of the sugar, but otherwise made them as posted. I used Nathan's hot dogs (the best IMHO) which I cut into thirds before dipping to make minis. Kids liked them a lot! Also had a bunch of extras that I put in a gallon freezer bag & froze. When re-heating, it's best to microwave them for a minute (depending on how many) to make them soft, then finish them at 400 in the toaster or conventional oven. If you just nuke them they get soggy.

I loved this recipe!!  It took a while to make, but it was well worth it!  My husband and I made them together, and froze whatever was left.  They looked just like what you get from the store, but tasted even better!  They froze very well and reheating made them taste just like they did out of the fryer.  Yum!

These corndoggers were awesome!  I did some hot dog and some cheese-stick.  The batter stuck fine, and I smeared it on with a spoon.  I had to make some changes to work with what I had, though.  I used a cast-iron skillet to fry in, and found that 350 degrees was too hot for the shallow skillet oil- I turned the burner down to just below medium.  Since the oil was only deep enough in my pan to cover half the dog at a time, I think I'll put the skewers in post-frying next time and use tongs to turn them so the batter soesn't all fall to one side.  If I turned them all the way around in the oil so each side was "set" before I browned them, this helped the batter not to slide to one side of the dog, too.  I will make these again for sure, though-- they went over well with the whole family, and were pretty fast and easy!  (Cooking them in the skillet only took about a minute on each side to get them done.)  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe takes a little bit of practice, but after you’ve made them a few times you can get the hang of it AND it’s well worth the effort. The recipe is wonderful. Getting the batter to stick to the hot dogs is tricky. I’ve found that drying the hot dog as much as possible helps the most, and making sure the oil is hot enough. I don’t use the basket, the hot dogs do go to the bottom but I’ve never had them stick. Also, we like to cut the hot dogs in half or thirds (minus the skewers), then roll in batter and fry. Walla, mini corn dogs! They’re much easier to make and great for smaller kids. Excellent recipe, Suzzanna, thanks!

I made these because I saw how quick and easy these were.  I don't know exactly what happened, but I couldn't "roll the hotdogs in the batter".  The batter wouldn't stick!  So I kind of just patted it on there.  They still tasted good, and my fiance begged me not to write these off, so I haven't.  I have to say the batter tasted delicious.  I am only giving this 3 stars because these weren't as easy as they are made out to be.

The original recipe was ok. I made changes after trying the original recipe. I  substituted honey in place of the sugar and added a teaspoon of onion and garlic powder to the batter. I also used a little more milk. I'm not sure how much if I had to guess I would say 1/4cup more milk. Even with the changes I made there was only enough batter to cover about 14 bun length hot dogs. 
After making the corn dogs I froze them. To reheat wrap in paper towel and put in the microwave for 1 min. It's a great quick snack on busy days. Thanks to the original poster I couldn't have done it without you.

Fantastic. First try ever making homemade corn dogs. They came out great. I cut my dogs in half before putting the batter on so they would easily fit in my fryer. Also I did get the batter cold in the fridge before coating, no slipping problems at all.

I really liked this recipe. Took some trial and error on my part to get the corn dogs to turn out nice, but they were very tasty. I used a deep fryer with a basket, ended up removing the basket because the batter stuck to it, even when it was all the way down in the oil. Then I couldn't get the batter to stay on the hot dogs, so I coated them in flour before dunking in the batter. Worked out perfect!

I made these the other night. Big hit with the family. I followed advice of others and dried off hotdogs with paper towels. Cornmeal mix stuck to dogs just fine. I fried in a deep sauce pan, so I turned the dogs a few times at first so the breading would not slide off the top of the hot dogs that stuck out of the oil. Then I turned every 30 to 45 seconds until evenly browned.

Just experimented as my son has been bugging me for corndogs and I didn't pick any up from the store. He loved them and now wants me to make these from now on. I cut my hot dogs in half and made mini-corndogs. They were a hit!

These are great! Used natural casing hot dogs and did not flour them. Simply wiped with paper towel. Batter clung and stayed on after frying. Will make these again for sure.

Great for Scout Camp!  We used powdered egg & dry milk and premixed all the dry ingredients in a Zip Lock bag so all we had to do was add water and Wa-La! Hot oil temp is the key, not too hot, not too cold.  The hit of camp food this summer!

These were just what I was craving. I didn't roll the hot dogs in flour, but I did make sure they were nice and dry before I dipped them.

SUPER good! I wish I had watched the video before making these (I screwed the frying all up, haha), but the flavor was out of this world! Truly is as good as the carnival corn-dogs.

I grew up with Corndogs or as we know them in Australia ''Dagwood Dogs''.
My children on the other hand growing up in Germany had no idea what I was making for them, so to see the happiness and excitement on their faces when I put them on the table was priceless. Thanks for the recipe and the happy trip down memory lane.

This was my first time making homemade corn dogs and it's a lot of fun and not as much trouble as I thought. The batter is delicious and tastes better than the frozen kind (I left out the pepper because I don't care too much for pepper in certain foods). I'm a vegetarian so it's been a long time since I had one at the fairgrounds, but my corn dogs made with Morningstar Farm veggie dogs came out perfectly and tasted like I remember them. Will definitely place this in my permanent recipe box. Thanks!

My husband and son love these.  So much in fact, that a couple days after I first made them my husband went out and bought twice as much hotdogs so i can do some more.  The only thing was that I omitted the pepper and dabbed the hotdog to get rid of moisture and rolled it in a lil bit of corn starch like the others said.  I cant believe how easy it was.  I seriously will not ever buy frozen corn dogs ever again.

Kids LOVED them! I refuse to buy them ones at Carnivals because of the outrageous prices. These keep them happy and me within my grocery budget. For about $10 we made 16 of them! I will be adding this to my recipe book.

Fantastic!!!!  Thank you for sharing - I've been wanting to be able to feed my kids corndogs, but I refuse to buy the gross ones from the store.  LOVE this recipe!!!   Note to self: don't use Bob's Red Mill Med. Grind Cornmeal, it's too gritty.  Use Masa Harina or fine grind.

I don't review recipes often but after my 4 year old daughters comment of "Mom, These corn dogs aren't just good...they are AMAZING!!" I had to write to say that this is an excellent recipe!  We used turkey dogs and whole wheat flour. Very simple and very delicious. Thank you for sharing your recipe, we will be making it again :)

Very good recipe.  I didn't have skewers so I cut the wieners in thirds.  Drying them worked great before dipping.  The only thing I did differently was I substituted 1 1/4 cups buttermilk for the regular milk.

Made these tonight for son.  I cut Nathan's hot dogs into five sections per dog (bigger than the bun dogs).  Dried them with paper towels - the coating stuck.  I used a saucepan of oil - used skewers to dip them into and out of the oil.  Coating puffed right up and browned nicely.

Very tasty but the batter didn't want to stay on in my shallow fryer. If my fryer were deeper I don't think there would be a problem. Will make again but need to work out some kinks.

These were great, perfect sweet cornbread taste.  I love using Hebrew National hot dogs for these.  Make sure you use a non-stick pan to fry, otherwise you'll have a tough time turning the corndogs and the cornbread covering will come off and stick to the pan.  Use a little more oil if you need to.  I'm going to try a different method of frying next time and submerge the dogs without the skewers and insert them afterwards

My first attempt at making corn dogs.  These were great, I did dry and roll them in flour and used a glass to dip them in.  Yummy!

These are AWESOME! I used the Bar-s classic smoked sausages with cheese for the franks and they came out perfect! The batter poofed into a light, crisp and oh so delicious corn bread coating. Next time we make this we will however need to make a larger batch as the basic recipe only made enough to coat 7 of those sausages, and that was pushing it. We plan on experimenting with the batter a bit, maybe make it just a TAD thinner, although as it is, I love it, my hubby is just one that MUST fiddle lol

I used vegetarian hot dogs (Smartdogs) and they came out great!  This is the best cornmeal batter that I have ever had!  I also battered broccolli and morningstar "sausage" patties with it as well and they all came out delicious.  Fried food nights are the best with this easy to use recipe!  Thanks for sharing this!

These were easy and delicious!  My batter was very thick after a couple hours in the fridge so I did use a little extra milk. Followed others suggestions of drying the hot dogs and making sure the batter is very cold.

This recipe is very good. I made them for the kid’s lunch and had to make more as the kids went out and brought back some of their friends. I deleted the pepper but followed the rest of the recipe. Since I was feeding kids I cut the hotdogs in half and made minis for them. I made the batter an hour ahead and kept it in the refrigerator to keep it very cold. I made sure to dry the hotdogs well on paper towels and had no problems with the batter sticking to the hotdogs. I then used a tall glass to dip the dogs in and then put them in the oil. Thanks for the recipe Suzzanna.

I am in love with this recipe. But when i made it i used some honey int he batter. About 1-2 TBSP. But it wasn't hard to make at all. I've never made homemade corndogs before, but I am definitley going to use this recipe again.

I was so scared to make this recipe because I am just not a great cook, but this recipe made me look like an awesome cook! These are a little time consuming with trying to get the batter on the dogs just perfect, but they fry beautifully! The family enjoyed these and next time I think I will add ranch powder to mix it up a bit!

Wonderful and easy. I basically never fry foods and have never made corn dogs before but this recipe worked fine for me just as is. I only added a little more cornmeal but it is probably because is used the metric conversions. I took this to an international potluck and corn dogs were a first for a lot of the people there, they all loved them.

I give this recipe 4 stars, but really the taste would be 5 stars. I knocked a star because the batter was very thick and I had to change the recipe a bit and add 1/4 C. more milk. I made mini corndogs which also liked to flatten out, but the kids didn't mind and even asked for more!

Excellent recipe. Works perfectly! The only thing I'd do differently next time is make a double batch of the batter. I hate having to fight to coat the last dogs smoothly and any leftover batter can just be dropped by spoonfuls into the oil to make a kind of hush puppy. 

Also, it's excellent made with honey instead of sugar. My brother will not eat refined sugar so it works nicely.

This was a pretty easy recipe, but I felt like the corn dogs became very greasy... maybe I just didn't cook them right. They are corn dogs and they're bound to be greasy when they are cooked in oil. All in all, the recipe was pretty good.

For me, these are time consuming, but that is because I have a small fryer and am too chicken to heat up a massive amount of oil on my stove (I caused a fire once by doing this).  I also chop up the dogs and make mini corn dogs cuz I have two little girls who are super picky when it comes to their food.  So, they took me a while, but they were worth it!  I also had to add a little more milk because my batter was SUPER thick.  Will add some honey as another suggested...I bet that would taste great!!

Super easy we recommend cutting the hot-dogs in half this makes them easier to fry.  We also liked using a skinny jar or drinking glass to put the batter in, this makes it easier to dip.  The corn dogs were delicious

This recipe is fabulous. I will NEVER buy those yucky grocery store corn dogs again. Thank you for this recipe.  My kids had a blast making them with me, and ask for them often.  *Thumbs up*

Very good, came out great. It is tricky until you get the hang of getting the batter to stay on the dog, but I got it. Follow the advice of previous reviewers, use a beer glass to dunk, make sure the dogs are dry, dust with a little corn starch, make sure oil around 350.

We made these for dinner & they were very very good. We never made homemade corn dogs before, so this was a treat. I had to tilt the deep fryer to get the whole dog in the oil, so I think next time I might just make the mini dogs without sticks so they can be dropped in. Or buy shorter sticks (or cut them down) & put into my electric skillet because a regular pan would be too small for dog plus stick. Batter was delicious!!

Quick and easy...  We only made 6 dogs and it was easy to just cut the recipe in half.  Total prep and cooking time was around 10 mins.  We added this one to our recipe box

The mix for the corn dog is delicious but it's not like the usual corn dogs. My boyfriend said it tastes like vegetable oil instead of corn dog. Usually corn dogs are more dry.

Very Easy to make...I have cooked these twice so far and the Kids love them..I did use 1/2 c of Frying Flour which has lots of seasoning in it already and 1/2 c of Reg. flour..and the seasoning really gave it a wonderful flavor..Thank you for the Recipe..

Great recipe.  I halved the recipe because we did not need that many and omitted the pepper as one of the reviews said the pepper was not needed.  I did dry off the weiners first and the batter stayed on pretty well.  Just used regular ole weiners as some of the reviews said all beef ones were tough and not as good as the regular.  Awesome corn dogs.  I don't want frozen corn dogs ever after this!

Made these tonight! They were super simple. We used turkey dogs and made sure they were completely dry before coating with a light dusting of flour. The batter was a bit thick so we thinned out just slightly by adding about 1/4 C additional milk. We also added a few more TBSP of sugar.  Poured batter into a tall glass and dipped the corn dogs. Very light and fluffy.  Everyone loved!

I edited this recipe for my families liking.  I substituted the regular salt for 1 tsp sea salt and upped the black pepper to 1/2tsp then I added 1 tbls prepared mustard and another 1/4 cup milk.  We like the batter to be thinner and lots of flavour.  It turned out awesome

These are perfect!!! Dry them off and be sure not to let your oil get too hot. It is easy to do and they will cook too fast.

Made a couple of changes. Only made half of the recipe (not including the egg). And I boiled the dogs first.  I also did as others suggested and coated the dogs in corn starch and I put the cornmeal mix in to the freezer for a little while. The coating stayed on the dogs perfectly.  The one complaint I do have though is that the outside wasn't crunchy/crisp enough. It came out too cakey. I'll try it again but next time either actually half the egg used or add more cornmeal, or maybe even both.

These were awesome! I made the recipe gluten free by using GF cornmeal and my normal GF AP Blend and it altered to GF very well. We used Nathan's hot dogs cut in half. I did need a bit more liquid than called for, but that is typical in gluten free cooking. I just eyeballed the extra milk looking for a pancake batter consistency. I also made honey mustard for these. A hefty squeeze of mustard and a hefty squeeze of honey whisked together. It really compliments these well! Thanks so much for sharing!

This is yummy......very light.....better than any you'll ever get 'at the fair'!!!    I substituted buttermilk for the milk....would do that again, although, having never used the milk, can't make the comparasion.   Certainly a keeper!!

I haven't had a corn dog in years but had a crazy craving for them. Since it's just me I quartered the recipe. I also wasn't about to heat up a whole pan of oil just to cook four corn dogs so I experimented and they came out well! Used a cast iron pan heated up very hot, laid the coated hot dogs down and gently rolled them as soon as the part touching the pan set up, cooked them til crisp on all sides and served with mustard, SO Yummy! Next time I will probably finish them off in the oven for about 15 minutes after crisping in the cast iron because the corn meal hadn't softened quite enough But they were still very tasty and very easy. Thanks for the batter recipe!

Very easy and very tasty. This recipe is missing a couple of helpful tips - dry off the hot dogs before rolling in the batter, and put the batter into a tall cup for dipping. I left out the black pepper because I didn't think it was necessary. Everyone loved them!

I quartered the hot dogs and made corn dog bites for the kids.  No stick used and dropped them into the oil.  I halved the recipe and added a tablespoon of honey.  Kids ate them up.

These are great!  We made them last night and they were a hit with everyone.  I mixed up a gluten free batch and a regular batch (both were great!).  I put batter in drinking glasses as suggested and then put them in the fridge to chill while the oil heated up.  I tried to keep my oil around 375, and my corn dogs were cooked all the way through in only 3-4 minutes.  I think we might make these again tonight - they're delicious and fun to make!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and yummy corn dogs! The "hush puppies" we made from the rest of the batter were a real treat as well! Definitely won't be eating them from a box anytime soon!!

Great! Followed these reviewer's suggestions...patted dogs dry and lightly covered w/ flour. I also placed batter in the freezer in a tall drinking glass about 15min before using. My family and several of my 11 year old daughter's friends LOVED them and they were fun to make.

The batter is perfect for dipping anything not just hot dogs. I am vegetarian so I used Yves brand veggie hot dogs. WOW. is all i can say. so good, and of course less fat.

This didn't work out at all.. I tried to cut up the hot dogs and deep fry for mini corn dogs.. I froze the batter for 30 minutes, I dried off the hot dogs all the way and all I got was a huge mess.  The batter and hot dogs seperated in the deep fryer and I had to scrape it out onto a plate.. looked more like a casserole.. not sure why it went so bad. :(

I missed corn dogs (or as they are often called in Quebec, "Pogos", since we went plant strong years ago. I really appreciate this recipe so I can make meat free versions of the beloved corn dog at home! I substitute unsweetened mother-less milk (almond or soy) and use an egg replacer for perfect results every time! This became a real fave in our home!

We made this for date night as something fun to do for the kids. What alot of fun and they turned out great. I'm not a carnival food person at all but I have to say when you can make food this fun why not. I was pleasantly surprised. If you are wondering if you should try it or not go for it! You'll make great memories and then me able to say you've made Corn Dogs with success. Just follow as printed.

My 6 year old and husband are very discriminating not only about taste, but also smell.  If it doesn't smell good---they are not eating it!  On my first try with these, they devoured them immediately.  My son declared that they smell great!  This recipe is simple and fun.  It's a definite keeper!

Easy! and my family thought they were as good as "hot dog on a stick" corndogs. they sell cheese on a stick ,that might be tasty too.definately make sure the hot dog is good quality and dried off before dipping it.And your baking powder should'nt be old,obviously.

My family loved these!  I forgot the baking powder, but it seemed to work in my favor b/c the corn dogs didn't puff up and soak in more grease than necessary.  I also cut my hot dogs in hate so they would fit in my fry daddy!  It's a better portion for a child to eat anyway!

The batter was pretty bland, next time we will add some more spices to punch up the flavor.  We used it for the hot dogs and jalepeno poppers.  All we had to do was pat dry the dogs and they cooked great the in fryer!  Will re-review next time!

Great! I used this batter on mini hot dogs and they turned out really well. I'll definitely use this again, but will probably try adding a spoonful of honey (I like my breading a little sweeter). Awesome snack!

Excellent recipe! I don't even like corn dogs but I ate these and loved them! My kids and my husband liked them too. 

We all liked that they were crispy instead of soft like the other kinds we've had before.

I took another reveiwer's advice and fried the hot dogs before I battered them. Fantastic tip!

I didn't have skewer sticks so I stuck one end onto a fork, dipped it in batter (which was in a cup), then slid it into the oil using another fork. Worked well enough and it wasn't messy.

Other than those two things, I followed the recipe exactly, but my batter would only cover 12 hot dogs. 

Next time I want to use honey instead of sugar and see what that does.

Try deep frying the hotdogs until lightly brown, about 10 minutes, and let cool before dipping in the cornmeal mixture. Gives them a whole different flavor!

My 5 year old just told me I am the coolest mom ever thanks to this recipe. Turned out great on my first try. I did use lil smokies instead of hot dogs. Just let them cook until they looked brown and they turned out fine. I did coat them in corn starch. Didn't have any skewers so i just rolled them in the batter with my fingers and then dropped them in the oil. A little messy, but it worked fine.

These were excellent.  Like another person mine turned out a bit grainy but that may have had something to do with the quality of corn meal that I used.  I found this recipe had no trouble coating 2 pkg. of Oscar Meyer hot dogs.  I didn't dry my hot dogs or use cornstarch but the batter didn't have trouble sticking until  the last two or three hot dogs - I think the others may have "air" dryed.

My almost 3 year old has been asking for corn dogs for a long time. Instead of going and buying the frozen kind, I figured I'd make them. These were fabulous! I made sure mine were dry, and the oil was hot enough that I didn't have to dip them in the corn starch before coating. They were so good my daughter took a bite and said, "yum. good job!" :-) can't beat that!

I should have read the reviews first LOL  Then I would have dried the hotdogs and coated them with corn starch.  The batter slid off.  Other than that they are great!  This was my first time making corn dogs.  I used a gluten free flour, and reduced the sugar but I think next time I will use the full amount.

I really liked these. Total comfort food. I read the reviews and per another reviewer i did a light coating of cornstarch to help the batter stick and I substituted half of the sugar for honey. They came out really well, even without skewers.

These were really easy and tasted great.  Lightly boiled dogs first, dried with paper towel then rolled in cornstarch.  I made mini dog bites by cutting in thirds and placed on toothpicks, rolled in batter and fried in deep fryer (340 degrees) about 1 min per side.  I made enough to freeze and will bake for a quick weeknight meal.  Thanks for the post.

My family loved these! I cut the hotdogs up and made minis.

Also, for the people having problems keeping the batter on...what I did was made sure my oil was nice and hot, I boiled my hotdogs first and then made sure they were dry. I dipped them in the batter and made sure they were coated (just keep twisting) and as soon as the dog hit the oil, it started frying so the batter didnt go anywhere.

Easy and Great recipie.I feel like the picture doesnt represent the recipie very well.They turn out very pretty.Also if you use wooden skewers cut them down they are too long.Measure the stick with you pan because it will need to lay in the oil.You will not be using the stick to pull it out but they turn out much better!

These weren't too bad. My kids enjoyed them. MAKE SURE your hot dogs are dry and rolled first in either flour or cornstarch, otherwise your batter will not stick as well. Also, it did not take 8-10 minutes to fry these. My oil may have been a tad hotter. The cook time was much closer to 6 minutes and they were nice and hot on the inside.

Great recipe!  Added honey to batter and made mini corn dogs with toothpicks.  USE A CUP TO DIP DOG INTO BATTER - much easier than using a spoon or anything else I can think of.  Make sure to use a dry hot dog or coat with cornstarch.  Thanks for sharing!

Very very good. I added more sugar because i like mine sweet.  If I had honey I would have used that instead.  So good.  I cut up the dogs in thirds and made mini dogs.

We made these for my daughter's birthday party and they were a big hit. The kids and parents loved them. We made them mini like some other people and used toothpicks. The hot dogs were dry and we had no problem with the batter. Make sure the oil isn't too hot or the corn dog will cook too quickly leaving the hot dog inside cool.

These are almost like the ones my mom used to make when I was a kid!! I made them today and they turned out great! I did subsitute buttermilk for regular milk and used a little less than the recipe called for.  I think this helped keep the batter on the thick side and I had no problems with it sliding off. I just made sure the dogs were dried off. I mixed the batter in a medium sized mixing bowl, held the hot dog by the stick and spooned the batter over each dog, then just rested them against the side of the bowl until they were ready to fry.  I just used a heavy bottomed saucepan and about an extra 1/2 cup of oil.  I tried to keep the oil between 325 & 350 with the use of a candy thermometer.  We had two leftover and we re-heated in the mic...they were still great!! My kids and my b/f loved them and I will be making these corn dogs again, foresure!!!

These tasted good, but I had problems frying in skillet. I ended up taking the stick out, but they browned too much. If I can fry better, they would be awesome!

I wasn't sure how these would turn out so I made a half batch.  I also cut each dog into 4 pieces and used toothpicks. Made sure the dogs were good and dry before battering them and made sure the oil was real hot.  Didn't have a bit of trouble with the batter falling off.  Will never buy these at the store again.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

At first I tried the corn starch, but then I ran out, and it really didn't matter.  As long as the oil and pan are hot enough, I didn't have any problems with the batter falling off or the corn dogs sticking.  Heat up the pan first till water drops dance on the skillet, then add oil and heat the oil.  If you add oil to a cold pan the oil will stick and so will your food.  A trick my stepfather who is a chef taught me.  I thought the recipe was great, I'm going to try different variations, add honey instead of sugar, maybe cheese another time...lots of possibilities.

This is a very difficult, frustrating recipe. When you dip the dogs in the coating, it slides right off. I tried flouring the dogs first as per others' suggestions but that just made the problem even worse. Then when you put them in the fryer, they sink to the bottom and stick to the fryer basket. When you try to pry them loose half the coating stays stuck to the basket. So then you have a fried hotdog halfway covered with coating. Then when they're done and you go to take a bite, the rest of the coating falls off onto your plate. And the flavor is not too special either. Sorry, but this is a dud.

Excellent recipe, better then the fair.  After I made the first one and my children tried it they were standing by me begging for more; I couldn't make them fast enough.  I added a little more sugar and I coated the hot dogs in cornstarch before dipping in the batter and they came out wonderful.  I will definitely make this again... as my daughter said, "I want to have this every night for dinner."

Truly better than store-bought corndogs. We also cut up the hot dogs to make bite-size mini corn dogs without the sticks. I also dust the hot dogs with cornstarch before coating with  batter so the batter will stick better. Fun to make with kids and yummy!

These were the best corn dogs I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, cut the hot dogs in half and dried them with a paper towel before dipping. I also cut sticks of sharp cheddar cheese and dipped those in the batter. They were delicious too. Thanks Suzzanna! We have a new family favorite.

These taste really great! I didn't think they were messy to make. We boiled the hotdogs and dried them off before we breaded them. We used a frying pan, but it would have been easier with a deep fryer.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I just wanted to actually make the corn dogs for my kids, instead of just getting one out of the box. They were great. My kids loved them! I did patted the winners dry like someone else sugested, and I had no problem with the batter sticking to them. Once again, Thank you!

These were okay, but I was not impressed with the flavor.  Definitely disappointed b/c of the good reviews. The search will continue.

Great recipe. To get the batter to stick to the dogs, just lightly roll dogs in cornstarch, shake off excess then dip. Works like a charm...

These were good.  The batter tastes likes the ones on your usual corn dogs, however, I only had beef franks, so it did alter the flavor and it just didn't taste right.  I substituted soy milk for the milk since I was out and honey for the sugar.  I also used peanut oil/olive oil because I didn't have vegetable oil on hand.  Also, I had a hard time making the batter stick on the hotdogs, one suggestion is to heavily batter it and place it in the fryer immediately, wait a second or two and turn it right away, or else your batter will seperate from the meat and float to the top.  All in all, the batter was good, but next time, I'm using pork franks, I'm sure it'll be better then.

I made these with the ingredients listed in the correct measurements, but did NOT use all beef hotdogs, and used two 8 packs of dogs cut in half-no sticks.  I put the dough in the freezer while I cut my hotdogs (which went into the fridge as soon as they were cut), and made my chips-I am submitting a photo as well for you to see.  I used a fondue fork to lift them out of the vegetable oil, and held them up and turned them a bit and lightly tapped the fork on the side of the bowl to coat them all over and remove excess--you do not need a lot of batter on there to make beautiful corn dogs!  Even small bare patches were covered when removed from the oil because the breading expands enough to do that.  I made little bread balls with the left over batter- me and my 4 yo granddaughter were the only one's who loved the dough alone.  Will be making these again and am testing them for freezing and re-cooking so that I can have them when I am working in the summer.  Will try to contact the OP if I am successful in freezing (or will leave a comment here to let users know how it works out.)  Good recipe if you follow fundamental cooking rules and techniques.  Thank you for sharing it here.

This was so much fun and easy to do.  The kids loved it.  We substituted the hot dogs with small sausage links and used a deep fryer for ease.  They came out great and truly recommend!

I didn't have any cornmeal so I substituted with breadcrumbs and it turned out just as amazing! Also if you have left over batter, drop spoonfuls into the oil and fry up just the dough for a yummy snack!

I chilled the batter in the fridge. It puffed up and got very dry so I had to add a bit more milk and stir it up.  I dried off the hotdogs and cooked at 365 degrees as suggested by another reviewer. I cut the hot dogs in half and cut skewers in half. They fit in a small pot to deep-fry.  Yummers.

I followed the advice to dry the hot dogs and chill the batter. They were perfect, as long as i kept the oil around 365 degrees (as recommended in the video). Otherwise the outside got really dark, but the hot dog never warmed through.  Easily the best corn dogs of my life.

This recipe was AMAZING! I used Lil Smokies with the batter to make appetizers for the Seahawks game and they were a huge hit! I dried the meat thoroughly first and the batter stuck fine. I didn’t put the smokies in right away so the batter started to puff up but, it didn’t matter. Even though there might have been a couple of small bare spots when I dropped them in the oil, the batter puffs up so beautifully that every piece was completely covered when they were done. The texture was light and soft on the inside with just the right amount of crunch on the outside.  I’ll definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

It was wonderful! Everyone said they loved it and gave it the “Good for Vacation” award.
I was not too hard,  the frying part was a bit lengthy.
From some of the pictures you can see I didn’t really use the sticks because we didn’t have any, so instead I used skewers for dipping then took it off for frying so that the pan didn’t have to be so tall.

I used buttermilk and used a tip I was given, to make sure the batter is cold.  I think I'd add a little more milk and not chill the batter, it made it really thick and somewhat hard to evenly cook the batter on the dog.

Took me 3 times to finally get right. I recommend letting batter refrigerate for 20 to 30 min to let it thicken. Also use spoon to spread batter lightly using lesser because the more batter you use it makes it harder to stay onto dogs.

I really wish I would have read the reviews first, some good tips in there. I had no cornmeal (what is a corn dog without cornmeal? desperation maybe), so I used extra flour instead which resulted in a lot more milk being needed to make the batter, well, batter. And I rolled the hot dogs in flour first so the batter would stay on. Can’t wait to try it again with actual cornmeal because it’s so good!

these turned out great ! easier then I expected. i boiled the hot dogs before battering them and putting in the oil. When I put my first corndog in I realized the oil was not hot enough so I just took it out and re-battered and it turned out great still. Oil temperature is everything for this recipe ! Also I did not use pepper as other reviews suggested.
I used organic cornmeal and organic chicken hot dogs. I only had a package of 6 hotdogs but this recipe probably could have made double that because I had a lot of leftover batter.

If you are frying them in a fry pan be sure to flip them to the other side soon after putting it in the oil.  The batter fries quickly.  The hot dog didn’t even have time to warm up before the batter was dark brown.  They tasted ok, but I think I will stick with the freezer corn dogs.

These are awesome, followed the recipe less the black pepper.  Be careful though. If your grease is too hot, the outer part will cook quickly while the inside remains gooey. I used medium low heat and didn't rush. Beautiful and tasty.

These were really good. I followed the recipe with no changes and my family loved them. I made sure to dry my hot dogs really well and let them sit out on a paper towel while the oil heated and I prepared the batter.  My only small complaint is that I wish the breading was a little thicker around the dog (it’s my favorite part), so I’ll try again and see if I can use a little less milk in the batter or something.  The taste was on point though!  I used the Nathan’s bun length dogs.

Thank you so much for this recipe, I made it for my family and they enjoyed it so much that they wanted more that very day. Here a lot of the frankfurters are salty so adding this bread like coating really cut down the sodium. I thought it was just a little to sweet for me so next time I am going to reduce the amount of sugar. But thank you so much for the recipe!

Tastes great, but the batter only stuck after frying to maybe 3/4 of the hot dog resulting in a 3/4 corn dog. Not sure what to do on that one....

I'm kind of at a loss here... I followed the recipe to the letter and the batter doesn't stay on the hot dog. I dip the hot dog and then place them in the hot oil and the batter spreads out. The hot dog is exposed and batter chunks are floating everywhere in the oil. Taste testing what was left was not good. The batter is super gritty and nothing like the smooth fluffy batter like at the county fair.

I was wondering if I should used self rising corn meal, or just regular corn meal. The recipe says corn meal, so I purchased some stone ground traditional yellow corn meal. Maybe this is too coarse? Recipe didn't specify so I grabbed what I figured was the right ingredient. I'm either going to try different corn meal brands or just find another recipe. This was a fail for me. Do not recommend.

I don’t know what carnival corn dogs you all have had, but these were below par.  There was no real flavor to them, and that was with the pepper.  I’ll experiment with other ingredients to give it more flavor.  My brother had some and he liked them, but he likes anything edible lol.  These have a long way from tasting like carnival dogs or at least Hot Dog on a Stick.

This recipe is very simple and easy to make but I expected it to get more crispy. Cover well the sausages and fry very well. I made a cheese version and it was very tasty.

First time I have ever made corn dogs, and they turned out perfect.  Only I change was leaving out the salt and pepper, and instead added some Old Bay Seasoning and some Cajun Seasoning.

This is a fantastic recipe!
I've made it once before and was craving it again tonight.
The dough stays on the corndogs, even while frying!
I really appreciate the former carney's helpful tips too! (See all the comments)

Great recipe but way too much sugar IMO - I only used two tbsp of sugar in mine as we have a kid with a sugar sensitivity. I also second the notion of rolling hot dogs in flour first otherwise batter slides right off. And sorry I have to laugh at the folx who are precooking the hot dogs first. *facepalm* HOT DOGS ARE ALREADY PRECOOKED. you can eat them right out of the package.  So by the time you cook the corn dogs your hotdog has been cooked three times and will be chewy *blech*

Made these for the family and they absolutely LOVED them! Definitely towel dry the hot dogs before you dip them in the batter, if not, you will have a problem getting the batter to stick. 
 You can add a little bit more sugar if you like the corn dog to be a little more on the sweet side.

Worked out perfect. I halfed the recipe and used whole buttermilk. Which came up to 1 cup for half the recipe as it was thicker. Ommited the pepper as per another post. And used a tall glass to coat

Love this recipe! My LO has a cow's milk protein intolerance (basically no dairy for her), so I used Silk Soy Milk and they came out good! No changes needed to get the batter the right consistency, which I feared might be a problem. I use this site for all my recipes for the past 4 years, and have never left a review. But this one deserved one! Plus, I thought I'd help those who must be dairy free. I also used popsicle sticks vs skewers (kid friendly). And finally, I used the suggestions from the comments, such as drying the hot dogs before with a paper towel and NOT rolling them in flour or cornmeal, omitting the black pepper and making sure the oil is about 365 degrees. Great suggestions! Worked perfect!

We had corn dogs at the fair last week and these were better.  The recipe is perfect as is, just need to follow instructions as recommended by some other reviewers, ie;  chill the batter, wipe hot dogs down with paper towel and make sure oil temperature stays at 365 and definitely no hotter than 375 and cook for 4 minutes.

I left out the black pepper.
I mixed the batter and left it in the refrigerator until supper.
The batter was way too thick so I thinned it with a little water.

We used Nueskes smoked hot dogs this time. 
We liked it a lot and will make it again.

I had modified the recipe to 3/4 cup of cornmeal.  The reason was that I found every recipe that required a 1 to 1 ratio with the flour and cornmeal, it was too much cornmeal, I found.

I made this as is with brauts instead of hot dogs. I used Turkey and beef  with cheese. I boiled them till grease was not shooting out. I made 10-beef and 5- turkey  and this left 6-very sceptical people at first very satisfied. I really liked corn dogs from fairs growing up but after trying one, 30+ years ago, somewhere else  I never ate another one till last weekend. These will be served at many more cookouts.

These were pretty good! My kids liked them, which is awesome, because they hate all other kinds of corn dogs. I only thought it needed a touch more salt, or something.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

As we were short on ingredients I halved the recipe then halved the hot dogs and skewered  with popsicle sticks.  Paper towel dried the dogs before applying batter.  Easy to make and tasty.

Excellent recipe. I've made the recipe twice. The second time I substituted the milk with beer, using a summer ale. Delicious!

It was very good I just wish it was a little crispyer/crunchyer. The only change I made was adding onion and garlic powder.

good, & use stone-ground cornmeal because the taste is 
simple, but homey.  go wacky: try Middle Eastern Turkey
Dogs instead of hot dogs for a spicy surprise!

These were great! Looking for new finger foods for our annual Super Bowl party, I wanted to test this recipe ahead of time and they were sooo good! I read gobs of reviews and used the tips to dry the dogs and to chill the batter. With those enhancements, I achieved corn dog perfection. I think it is unfair for someone to leave a review, especially one less than 5, when they do something like bake them instead of frying them, or use other flour because they had no corn meal. Don't rate the recipe unless you tried the recipe! Great recipe as is. This one goes in my recipe box :)

The flavor was good, not great.  the batter wasn't quite right - when fried, it puffed nicely, but fell apart when you took a bite.

Made yummy mini corn dogs. I only filled up the pan with oil to cover half a dog. When frying, they made a little boat that was convenient to flip with tongs. I made it to the recipe just a tiny version for more batter per bite.

Great recipe. Would be nice to have more direction on how to apply the coating. You only need a thin layer FYI. For our second batch I pureed some jalapenos and added to the mix.

It had really good flavor.  I used the batter with previously grilled Johnsonville Brats.  They were delicious.  I also had some left over batter and coated a few jalapeno halves that I stuffed with a cream cheese/cheddar cheese mixture.  It was yummy, too.  Then I coated a ball of the cheese mixture.  It was delicious.  The only difference I found was that I needed about an extra half cup of milk.  My first batch was too thick, but after I added a bit of milk, the rest of them were just like state fair corn dogs.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just now made this as a "project" for me and my little girl. I have to say that they were great! I'm on a low carb diet so I had planned to only take "a bite" to see how they turned out. Well, that bite turned into me eating the whole thing and wanting more! Great recipe...

Perfect.  One of very few recipes I did not need to alter. Last time I tried it, it failed because I couldn't keep the batter on the entire hot dog at the same time.  This time, I cut the hot dogs in half before dipping so I wouldn't waste as much oil, and the batter stayed on better.  I hate the artificial taste of store bought hot dogs, and this was the same basic flavor without the weird aftertaste.  Love it!  I know the temperature makes a difference, but mine only needed to fry for about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes,  they burned as I approached 2 1/2 minutes.

I made these with some friends, and they turned out GREAT! Followed the recipe exactly, along with the tips to dry the hot dogs first and chill the batter. We prepped the batter and put it in the fridge uncovered for about half an hour, and dried the hotdogs with paper towels and then let them sit out on the counter for about ten minutes. Then we battered them up (with some assistance from a spoon) nice and thick, and put them in the pan. The browned beautifully-- we had the oil on med-low heat, and let it get to a good frying temp before starting (we had a little extra batter that we dipped in on a spoon to test if the temperature was right yet)!

Will be making these again-- thinking we might add some cayenne like others have said to give it a little kick! ;)

These were very good. Once I got the hang of dipping them they were very easy to make. I made them a little earlier then I needed them because I didn't know how long it would take me. I put them in the oven to keep them warm and I have to say they did not get soggy like I thought they would.  This is a keeper for sure. I increased the sugar as per others suggestions and they were perfect.

These are really yummy! I agree that drying them first is a great help. I also make them as snacks by putting corn meal muffin batter into mini muffin pans and pop pieces of quality hot dogs into the batter and bake. These are a great finger food. I may try them with your batter recipe in the mini tins as well. Good job.

This was very easy and quick to make and a big hit with my family, kids and grown-ups alike. However, next time I make it I am going to increase the sugar a bit because it needs a little more sweetness to be exactly like the ones you get from the fairs. I liked making them myself because I can control the quality of the ingredients. I used non-GMO organic ingredients which is way more acceptable to me than frozen boxed corn dogs or fast food versions.

I make these once a month at our Eagles Lodge and everyone raves about them, Make sure to let the batter rest in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes before dipping. I par boil quarter pound beef franks, dry them thoroughly, dip them and deep fry them for about 3- 5 minutes and they turn out great.

Great recipe.  In order to get that true carnival corn dog taste I had to double the salt and the sugar.  Used the old fashioned Fry Daddy and they turned out great!

My son's allergic to egg, so I replaced the milk and egg with 1 1/4 cup buttermilk. Worked great.

Being a vegetarian for 37 years, it's been a long time since I've had a corn dog.  We used the veggie dog in this recipe and memories of the state fair were instant. Thanks!!

Amazing! easy and wonderful flavor & texture. We used Gluten free flour, organic Corn meal & organic all beef hot dogs, didn't miss any flavor & so much healthier. We cut our dogs in half  & they made fun bite size corn dogs. We will never buy store bought corn dogs again.

These are fantastic! My house smelled so good and they tasted just like the fair. I didn't have a deep container, but I will definitely be on the lookout just to make this recipe. The batter is quick and easy to put together. I fry at 350F which didn't leave them greasy. I will be making these again

These are very good. Most of us were treated to these when we were young & went to the fair. When I was a kid they were called Pronto Pups. One year someone showed up & made Tater Dogs instead of Corn Dogs. YUM! Give it a try. Just substitute instant potato flakes or day old mashed potatoes for the corn meal. You may want to increase the liquid a little for the instant potatoes.

The batter in a jar didn't work because it was so thick. I had to use a butter knife to spread the batter on. They burned in under a minute.

Made the mistake of using medium grind cornmeal, so there was hard pieces in it. I tried using flour first on the hot dogs, like another user mentioned, but the batter slid right off. Without the flour on the hotdogs it stayed on a little better. With that said, and aside from the hard chunks, it turned out really yummy! I used Organic flour, hotdogs, sugar, milk and eggs, so this was much healthier than the frozen ones. I also added some honey to the mix, which was a nice addition. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the batter doesn't stay very well on the hot dogs.

Loved this but we made 1 Sub, used 1 and a quarter cup buttermilk to replace the 1 cup of milk. IMO it is way better with the buttermilk

An OK easy to use recipe but this does turn out far too sweet for our liking. I may try adding some smoked paprika or cayenne pepper to this to give it a real pep. Next time I do this I will drastically reduce the sugar or even remove it completely. To me the batter should be savoury not sweet; it just doesn't work with hot dogs.

So yummy!!!  I actually found that not rolling them in flour made the batter stick. The ones I rolled in flour caused the batter to slide off. I also dipped chunks of pepper jack cheese in the batter and fried them.  Delicious!

Yup!  I've made this recipe.  The batter is ideal in thickness, texture and flavor.  However, IMO, two important steps are missing.  First, after inserting the sticks, thorough dry each dog with paper towels.  Then roll of dust with plain white flour before dipping in the batter.  Without these steps, the batter may sluf-off before or during frying.  I've tried it both ways and the uniformity of the retained batter is much better with dry, floured dogs.  An alternative is the semi-commercial idea of using pre-stuck, frozen dogs.  Cooking will be lower and slower, but it works.
And, for an easier, almost instant batter, see the Jiffy.com website recipe based on their corn muffin mix. Essentially the same batter, but easier to make.  As simple as this product appears, getting the batter temperature and time 'just right,' will require some practice.

First time making homemade and these are it!  I dried and rolled the dogs in flour first to make the batter stick better as reviewers suggested.  Worked perfectly.  These are super quick and easy to pull together and would be great as minis in kids' lunches as well.

I have made these several times and they are great.  I don't have a deep fryer, so I put about 1/2 inch of oil in a cast iron pan.  They do come out in the shape of a triangular prism this way(!), but they still taste great.  Deep frying would cook them more evenly.

I liked this recipe. I don't have a deep fryer, only a deep wok, so I made small corn dogs on a stick. I used stevia instead of sugar, soy milk instead of milk, and wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.  I also used olive oil instead of veg. oil. Wish they were a bit less greasier, but I still got a lot of thumbs up from family.

This was great! Better than corn dogs from the state fair!  The breading is great.  I highly recommend rolling the hotdogs in a little bit a flour before battering them so that the batter sticks well.  The only other thing I would change would be to make them mini by cutting up the hotdogs so that they are easier to fry, but that's just because our fryer isn't the biggest!

Awesome recipe, tastes just like the fair! I fried in my deep fryer at 375º for 3 to 4 minutes.  Came out perfect without being greasy whatsoever! The only change I made was I omitted the pepper. Make sure to dry the hotdogs or roll them in cornstarch so the batter sticks. My batter was nice and thick and stuck well! Also, make sure you hold it in the oil for a few seconds before letting go. If you don't,  it will sink to the bottom and stick. I was a bit worried about putting sugar in the batter, but it made it taste just like the carnival corndogs. Excellent recipe!!

I tried it for the first time. Getting the coating on evenly was a challenge. As my daughter commented "Dad, one of them looks more like a rat dog (shape) then a corn dog but they taste good". I believe getting the consistency of the batter is the key. Oh well, I'll keep trying.

This was an easy recipe to throw together, everyone loved it.  I was having a hard time getting the batter to stick to hotdogs, even after I coated them with flour, but persistence paid off, and they all turned out great.  We ended up cutting the hotdogs into little bites (we called them chubs) and the kids enjoyed the treat!  The leftover are going in the freezer for a quick afternoon snack!

Just made these for my 10, 8, and 6 year old for a themed "state fair lunch" paired with strawberry lemonade.  All of the children loved them!  I actually didn't have plain cornmeal so I used a cup of the jiffy cornbread mix and followed the rest of the ingredients and omitted the black pepper. I set the batter in the fridge in a mason jar and it started to rise quite a bit and almost overflowed the jar.  I cut the hot dogs in half to make more kid friendly sized hot dogs and double dipped and fried at 350-375 for 3 minutes. They raved about them.  I will definitely make again!

It was simple and easy to make. It was really big hit with the family, they all said it was delicious. I didn't have skewers so I cut the hot dogs up and fried them like hush puppies. Everyone found this fun.

These came out great! I didn't flour the hot dogs, just dried them with a paper towel. As long as the oil was hot enough, the batter stuck on just fine. I would have liked the batter to be just a bit thicker and sweeter though.

this recipe is very easy to make and by far the best recipe for corn dogs!  The dough is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The portions on the recipe does not yield 16 corn dogs.  Probably about 10 corn dogs.  Very good recipe!

Good corndogs. My batter was very thick. I needed to add about 2 tablespoons additional milk so that the batter wouldn't be too thick on the hotdogs. Got about 11 corndogs total, not 16. Used 365° oil for about 3 minutes.

I love this, and my children love helping me dip the dog's I recommend using Hebrew National all beef hot dogs. Because they are my families favorite hot dogs and this batter is the best we  have tried they make a great team. I did use less pepper in batter and added a tsp of honey because we love the flavor of the honey. it tasted great.

I made these for my son's carnival themed birthday party. I had to make 80 corndogs so I did the recipe x's 5. It didnt end up being enough batter, but other than that they were very good. Everyone raved about them. We cooked them outside in a fishcooker.

Delicious! I would suggest adding a little more sugar (to taste). Also, cooking the hot dogs on a skillet before applying batter assures dogs are properly cooked. Awesome recipe!!

Great recipe.  Followed comments from others and dusted the weiners with flour before coating.  After dropping the corn dog into the oil, I used tongs and held the corn dog up from the bottom for a couple of seconds.  This prevented the corn dog from sticking.

These taste identical to the frozen ones I used to buy from the store.  I stopped eating those and miss them... I'm so glad this recipe is here!  I didn't add the black pepper, as suggested by another reviewer.  I'm going to try them again with the bp to see if there's a big difference.  Thanks for the recipe =)

SO tasty. We left out the pepper but put the batter in home freezer for about 15-20 mins, rolled dogs in corn starch and dusted then off before dipping into the batter. We used our fryer and put them in without sticks too. So delicious, we'll do this again for sure. Thanks !!

the first time i made these, the batter would not stay on the dogs at all. i tried both refrigerating it first and putting corn starch/flour, but it didn't seem to work. so i only got large chunks of batter on the dogs and it didn't cover completely. the oil was also too hot so the insides were not cooked through. even then, the batter tasted good!  The second time i made them, i had to roll them around in the batter much more, then let the batter drip off so it wasn't so thick. they came out perfectly. brought them to a potluck and they were a huge hit! will definitely make them again

Pretty tasty corn dogs.  I did what other reviewers suggested and pour the batter mix into a taller container and dipped it that way.  I also coated the hot dogs with cornstarch first before the batter and it turned out fine.  I don't think it needed to be cooked 8 to 10 minutes as instructed because that would probably burn the dogs.  I know mine didn't cook that long and it came out good.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I was expecting a "Fair Like" sweet batter. It was quite bland... not much better than the frozen one's.

My step daughter has a wheat and a dairy allergy.  I substituted the flour with a gluten free bread mix and then used soya milk instead of regular milk.  It turned out excellent.  By ensuring all your ingredients are gluten and dairy free, this works great.  We will be making these for my son's birthday party, where he has a friend with a wheat allergy as well.  A great receipe.

Followed the recipe to the "T" Except I used polish sausage instead of dogs. Off the hook. Great recipe. I gave it 4 stars cause it was a polish corn dog not a prime rib. Definatly as good if not better than carnival fare. Easy to prepare and I will make them again. Thank You

These corn dogs were great.  I used self rising flour so i omitted the salt and the baking powder.  I also refridgerated my batter for 10 minutes and then in between dipping the dogs as someone suggested.  My family ate them up.

I love corndogs but since I've moved, I couldn't find the carnival quality corndogs that I was used to.  Anyways, this is a good recipe for batter.  I had problem with the batter running off of the dogs but I will take the others advice and chill the batter before dipping.  I tried it with Eckard brand sausages... they were excellent.  My kids also enjoyed them as well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved the recipe!  The only thing I did different was I cut the hot dogs into bit size pieces for the kids.. the kids LOVED them and asked for seconds!  Though I am going to try to put them in the oven vs frying.. I usually try to refrain from frying foods if I can.. will let you know how that works!

I had a slight problem. I prepared everything and everything set the only thing was I had realized I had to deep fry this and I didn't have a deep fryer. every time I tried to put it in the skillet it slid off and it absorbed too much oil.

The batter tastes good, but I couldn't get it to stick to the hot dogs.  

The hot dogs were thawed and dry, but perhaps I used a corn meal that was too coarse-ground?

I followed this recipe to the letter and it didn't turn out for me. The batter slid off and around the dog making a sort of "batter bed" that the dog rested in. Perhaps my oil temp was too low. The taste was however, bang on! I think I just need to work on my technique!

The batter covered the hot dogs perfectly and they cooked up nicely.  I took the advice of others and precooked the dogs and they were hot and cooked perfectly.  The only problem was that they came out rather grainy tasting and that is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.  I probably won't be making these again. But thanks for the recipe.

I made these for my daughter as I am not a big corn dog fan, but ended up eating two myself.  I boiled the hot dogs first, and then did as other reviewers did and used a cup to dip them in.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I just made these.  They are pretty tastey.  I only had 7 hotdogs so I halved the batch, but I think I would have been better off using a full batch.  It was hard to coat the last ones because there was not that much batter.  Also, cooking on medium heat does the trick.  It really minimizes grease splatter.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love the flavor of this recipe. My only problem was that I found the batter very thick to coat the hotdogs well. They also stuck to the bottom of my deep fryer. Still very tasty!

Never attempted corn dogs before but I have to say everyone loved them. I even put some in the freezer for those times when a kid wants to eat and I'm not home. Will be making these again! Good job on the recipe.

This was a really good recipe. One tip - DONT pour the batter into a drinking glass immediately after mixing. The baking powder made it grow and overflow the cup! So...after a bit of cleanup, I needed a bit more milk to thin the batter to a consistency that would coat the hot dogs. Drying them first was definitely a good tip. The batter coated 24 Schnieders Red Hots, and am freezing the extras on a cookie sheet. They should microwave nicely!

yummy yummy!  These browned a bit faster than I expected, and certainly cooked faster than I thought they would.  Granted, I have a gas stove and used an enameled cast iron pot, which retained heat very well.  Will definately make these again.

I thought these were great. My kids adored them-- once they got past the fact that they didn't look like the frozen kind. Instead of leaving the hot dots whole, I sliced them into about fours and then breaded them.

This recipe tastes wonderful, but it is a little tricky. I made it exactly as is except I dried the hot dogs with a paper towel really well and then coated them with a mixture of flour and corn starch (flour alone didn't work well and I didn't want to waste it so I just added corn starch). I made the batter in a deep but narrow bowl so that I can put the hot dogs in there and they would be covered well. As I fried one batch, the next batch sat in the batter and I think that really helped because the batter thickened around the hot dogs. Before I removed the hot dogs from the batter, I shook the bowl to make sure they were well coated. My only regret, which I learned through error after several batches, is that I thought the batter was too thin around the hot dogs so I didn't let them drip. What I got was super chunky corn dogs. Towards the last few batches as I took the hot dogs out of the batter I shook them a little and let them drip and they came out wonderfully smooth.

My kids LOVE these and request them often.  I use the long wooden skewers (for Kabobs) and just break them into..works great.  I'm going to try heating the hot dogs before because if the temp is right it doesn't take long for the batter for brown.  Very tasty!!

Tasted just like the kind you buy at the store.  I fried mine in a deep fryer though and it didn't need to be fried more than a couple of minutes.

Very good recipe.  Crispy on the outside yet soft on inside and the hot dog was heated all the way through.  I did a little variation in the batter by adding a couple of green onions sliced thin.  Gave a hint of onions on your hot dog too!!  That wasn't my idea, though, got it from Rachael Ray the day she made corn dogs.  She baked hers and they looked fine--course didn't taste them lol

These sounded good so I just made them for lunch.  My kids loved them and I thought they were pretty good.  I would personally like them to be a bit sweeter, so I just dipped them in honey instead of ketchup :)  Yum!  Good recipe.

These were great for a change and pretty easy to make. However, the breading ended up being flat as I fried them up in a pan.

This recipe is very good. Reminds me of our County Fair Corn Dogs. I did not have wood skewers so I cut the hot dogs in half and it made them easier to cook.

These were very good! Authentic corn dog flavor and texture.
I also made up a low fat variation using fat free hot dogs and a little wheat flour in the batter.

Man this was perfect. I tested cooking methods by dipping cold hot dogs in the cornbread mixture & I also boiled some first.  I think it's better to boil first. And make sure you pat it dry with a papertowel afterwards.  I would like to figure out how the end product of the cornbread coating could be a little thicker.  My daugter loved it too!!!

Just like the ones at the fair. I cut the hot dogs up like others suggested and that worked out great, no sticks required. However, next time I will heat the hotdogs up in the microwave before I dip them. Very easy & good.

DELICIOUS!  I didn't need so many, so I halved the recipe.  To get 1/2 an egg, I only used the white.  Chilling the dogs in the freezer while you prepare the batter helps it stick.  375 degrees is perfect.  Next time I will use less milk to try to get a thicker coating.  I might also par-fry them & freeze some for quick dinners.

We thought these were good but a bit of a hassle until I patted the dogs with paper towels to make sure the skins were dry so the batter would stick better.

Great corn dog batter.  It is difficult to get it to stick to the dogs, but a previous reviewer's tip using the cornstarch does help.  I'll be making this again soon.
