These have become my default pancakes.  I made them again this morning.  Use the old baker's tricks of letting your buttermilk, milk and eggs sit out for an hour before baking to get to room tempurature and you'll get increased fluff on these.  And don't overmix.  Be sure to leave small lumps of flour that break open when pouring out the mix on the griddle.  I used blueberries today and they turned out great - coat any fruit you want to add in a bit of the flour mixture first and you'll find they don't all drop to the bottom.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

It took a little tweaking and A LOT of time, but these did come out wonderful in the end.  Like other reviewers, this made WAY more than the listed 12 five inch pancakes!!  I could easily have fed my 5 family members with just 1/3 of the batter.  The first batch I made (exactly as the recipe is written) weren't stellar.  I found them to be heavy and strikingly like French Toast.  (They DID make pretty good waffles as I had a TON of batter leftover.)

On my next batch (scaled down to 1/3) I added one extra teaspoon of sugar and one teaspoon of lemon juice.  My trick for getting these nice and fluffy was to let the batter sit for a day or two in the refrigerator.  The oxidation of the lemon juice and baking soda really caused the batter to swell with all those wonderful air bubbles that make a nice, tender and fluffy pancake.  Making this on Sunday night and using it during the week has made this recipe a staple in my home.  My family can't get enough of them!!

Yum!  I was out of buttermilk so I put about 1 tsp of vinegar (or you can use lemon juice) in the one cup measuring cup and then filled with milk.  By the time I was ready to mix the two together, I had "buttermilk".  I scaled the recipe for "4" rather than "12" because I was alone but I barely ate half of them.  I didn't even use a fork, I just poured the syrup on a plate and dipped!  Piggy, don't you think?  :)  I am saving the rest for tomorrow and will just toast them in the toaster-oven.  Can't wait!

These were pretty good.  Thank heaven for another reviewer's suggestion for using whole milk, because I only had 2 cups of buttermilk!  I would, however, make one tiny suggestion: When adding all the wet ingredients together, make sure the butter has cooled somewhat, so as not to "cook" the eggs in the batter.  You'll wind up with super lumpy pancake batter!  You could also add the butter to the milk first, mix, then add the eggs, but DO NOT ADD THE BUTTER RIGHT OFF THE STOVE if you've already added the eggs!  I also added some vanilla for extra flavor.  Light, fluffy, and yummy!

These were delicious! They were so light and fluffy. The first time I made these I stirred the batter too much and they came out flat and slightly tough but the second time I barely mixed it and they turned out very tender and fluffy.

I wish I could give this ten stars!!  This is the best pancake recipe ever!  I made the whole recipe, and froze the left overs, putting a square of waxed paper between each pancake. Then, just put them on a plate, zap in the microwave for 1 minute (for two pancakes), and you have a hot breakfast in no time! I'll never use a box mix again!  Thank you!

My family just loves these pancakes! I always put alittle more milk in to thin the batter some. The only down side to these wonderful pancakes-- I can never seem to cook them fast enough for my boys! 
You can successfully freeze unused buttermilk in the freezer. (milk too) Which is great, that way I always have buttermilk on hand.

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU so much for this recipe!!!My husband loves big breakfasts and I got so tired of cooking boring pancake mixes that tasted so bland.  This recipe has made me a pancake lover!!  I have cooked these several times, once with milk soured with vinegar (turned out good) and then all the other times with the fresh buttermilk (turned out HEAVENLY).  I would not make these again without the fresh buttermilk!  I made them for some friends one morning too and both demanded the recipe before they left the house!  They just melt in your mouth!  Hubby loves them too!  The only thing I added was vanilla and some cinnamon - but that's just some flavoring that I like in my pancakes.  These are FANTASTIC!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Made this for hubby and 1 yr. old son yesterday for breakfast.  Both of them ate this up quickly.  I think my son liked it a little bit more because he wasn't so happy when it was all gone.  Followed this recipe to a "T".  Can't go wrong.  Thanks for the post.

FLUFFY, LIGHT and HEAVENLY! Buttermilk is the key so don't substitute it! (I can't drink the stuff so I use the leftover buttermilk for Irish Soda Bread.) You need medium heat and I had to experiment with it the first time. Just remember your stove setting for next time. Cook each side for about two minutes (make a note of the cook time too!). At various times I've tried adding very ripe bananas, or chocolate chips (made a yucky mess), or nutmeg or cinnamon. But to me they are best as is with just a pat of REAL butter and REAL maple syrup. Leftovers can be refrigerated but I've found they can't be brought back to full life (kinda like zombies...they'll only be a reflection of their former glory).

I was looking for a 'best-of' buttermilk pancake recipe and decided to do a head-to-head comparison between Buttermilk Pancakes II and the Truck-Stop Pancake recipe.
I made both recipes simultaneously using all ROOM TEMPERATURE wet ingredients as per another pancake review on this site.
Cooking was done on an electric grill at 350F and I converted both recipes down to 4-5 servings.
Findings:
Although color and loft were great on both recipes, both myself and my wife found the Buttermilk Pancakes II to be far superior in both texture and flavor.
The Truck Stop pancakes had too much baking powder and soda taste as well as a slightly tougher consistency. An added benefit to BP II was the ease that it converted up or down. These are the best buttermilk pancakes I have found so far, I suspect that using room temperature ingredients mixed lightly with a whisk contributed to the batter's slightly stiff consistency. I highly recommend this recipe. JM

We made these pancakes last weekend.  We were interested in trying them based on all the reviews,  but they were disappointing.  They weren't fluffy, they were thick and we were unimpressed.  The extra sugar in the batter isn't necessary for buttermilk pancakes, but we like a lot of buttermilk flavor.  We had been making Mom's Buttermilk Pancakes for months now.  They're super easy to make and they're delicious!

this is pretty much the same recipe i have been using for years.   Absolutely, do not overmix, that makes pancakes leathery.  The buttermilk quantity listed is a little high and you don't need milk at all...mixed this way, the batter will be kinda runny from my perspective... so add the milk mixture with a gentle hand and thats why i gave only 4 stars.  I use more sugar and leave out the butter to cut fat except for special occasions.  You can swap out the all purpose flour for either cake flour or white lily for an interesting change... cakey-er. Oh, i also scale my recipe for two:  1 C flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp soda, scant 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tbl sugar, 1 egg, 3/4+ C buttermilk

WOW!  These are THE BEST buttermilk pancakes I have ever tasted!!  Much better than the Buttermilk Pancake I and Good Old Fashioned Pancake from this site.  I should've just started with this one!  These are super light, fluffy, sooo moist and perfectly sweet.  This does make a lot of batter, but just refredigerate the extra batter and they taste just as perfect the next day.  As the recipe says, do NOT over mix.  There will still be lumps and do NOT change or half the recipe or it won't turn out.  The ONLY addition I would make is to add about 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  This will be my MASTER RECIPE from now on.  Look no further for the ulitmate, gourmet pancake.  Buy a bag of frozen blueberries and keep it in the freezer for whenever you want blueberry pancakes- they're too die for.  SO DELISH- forget the box stuff!

Can't add much more to what has already been said. Best I've had - reduced the recipe to 4 makes just enough for me and the g-kids. Easy to double or tripple for larger quanities.

My family have become pancake connoisseurs over the years as they are definitely our favourite breakfast.  We have tried recipes from all over the world, but this ranks among the best.  They're so light and fluffy and brown to a lovely light honey color.

We love them served with plain ol' maple syrup or berry yoghurt and fresh blueberries.

Experimentation has shown that if you separate the egg whites and beat them  until they form stiff peaks and then fold them through the mix just before pouring, it adds to the fluffiness and texture.  Also, it doesn't hurt to leave the egg/buttermilk mixture a while to reach room temp.  And also, it helps to leave the final mixture stand a little while before pouring.  (While you make the coffee and whip the fresh cream!)

I use a similar recipe for myself cutting it down by two-thirds to 1 cup of flour, 1 tbsp. of sugar, 1 tsp. of baking powder, 1/4 tsp. of salt, 1 cup of stirred vanilla yogurt, 1 egg, a  1/4 cup of milk and 1 tbsp. of melted butter. Mix in order as directed in the directions given. I usually mix up the dry ingredients in the recipe in bulk and store in a large air-tight container ahead of time. Then it is just mixing 1 tbsp. of melted butter with 1 slightly scrambled egg in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup of milk. Mix thoroughly. Then add 1 cup of dry ingredients. Stir until dry ingredients are just moistened. Mixture should be lumpy. You can adjust consistency to your liking by adding more milk to thin out or more dry ingredients to thicken. I use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to ladle the batter onto a hot flat griddle pan (Heating element is set at medium high). For blueberry pancakes, just dot the top of the pancakes with fresh or frozen blueberries just after ladling the batter onto the hot pan. When bottom of pancake is dark golden brown, flip over to cook the other side of the pancakes. When done, stack on a warm plate, kept warm in a low (150 deg. F) oven. When the entire batter in finished, enjoy pancakes with thin slices of butter inserted between the pancakes and top off with table syrup.

The pancakes weren't very fluffy, they ended up looking more like crepes. So I doubled the flour and baking soda, and added some vanilla and then they turned out much better.

This is an absolutely fantastic recipe.  The pancakes are truly a work of art.  Fluffy as a pillow and you can't beat this buttermilk base.  I took a few posted suggestions, such as reducing the ingredients by half, adding an extra 1 tsp. sugar, 1 tsp. lemon juice, and a tsp. of vanilla. By barely mixing the wet and dry ingredients together, it produced a batter that was very puffy and light. This will be my ONLY pancake recipe for now on.

Excellent pancakes!  Makes enough for an army.  I made half the batch with blueberries and half plain.  I had enough left over to freeze for another time.

This looks like a recipe I had before I was married.  Plain yogurt thinned with about 1/4 cup milk works when you don't have buttermilk.  Sometimes I use the fruit yogurts for an extra treat.

I Love this recipe!  I made my own buttermilk with lemon juice and added a little bit more sugar.  I tasted the first pancake and tasted the egg, maybe it was just me!  I added maple syrup to my mix and they were perfect!  I usually add syrup to my batter but wanted to try one without it first.  I do not like syrup ON my pancakes but IN them is fine!  It gives a sweet taste without the mess.  I also add syrup to the egg mixture of my french toast for the same reason.  I love how much batter was left over.  In the morning all I have to do is cook.  My pan is on the stove waiting for morning!  Thank you for this recipe!

I just finished having these for breakfast and I must say they were delicious, light tasting pancakes. I added vanilla and cinnamon for extra flavor and left out the salt. Since I didn't have buttermilk I added 1 tbs of vinegar to the milk and the pancakes came out excellent.  This will be the recipe I use from now on...thanks!

Homerun! These were delicious for dinner. I have been waiting to make these for the last four days. But, I was too lazy to get out of bed and make them as I have been taking care of a hubby recovering from cancer surgery. So tonight we had them and we both agreed, light and oh so good!  Enough left for breakfast. Oh, I only made half the recipe for the two of us and used two eggs.  They were perfect! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Delicious! I scaled this down a bit as there were only two of us this morning. I had no problems mixing the batter up and pouring it onto the grill. I used all fresh buttermilk.  The pancakes rose up nicely while little air bubbles popped on the surface. I cooked these until a light golden brown color appeared before flipping them over. These were indeed light, fluffy and tasty! I love that this recipe requires fresh buttermilk as this is what I would have used anyway in my pancakes. The buttermilk and butter both add a nice flavor to the pancakes. I don't think this recipe needs any adjustments and is good as is. I think next time I might even add some fresh blueberries to the batter. Today, we drizzled some warm, "Blueberry and Raspberry Pancake Topping," from this website, over the pancakes. Even thou I cut back on the amount I still ended up with 11 medium size pancakes which left us enough to enjoy again for tomorrow morning's breakfast!

I had some leftover buttermilk to use up and found this recipe.  So glad I found it.  These were great!  I made the night before just to save time in the morning.  The batter got a little thick, but all I had to do was stir it down a bit.  The whole family really liked these, and I will make it again.  Thanks.

Great, yummy, and easy recipe.  I scaled this down to 8 servings to use the 2 cups of buttermilk I had on hand and made these because my daughter had friends sleeping over.  Everyone liked them.  I added some pure vanilla extract.

This is the holy grail of buttermilk pancake recipes -- FABULOUS!  The pancakes cook up nice and high and fluffy without the heaviness or "doughiness" you sometimes get with thicker pancakes.  I've tried just about every pancake recipe out there.  This one is THE BEST, without a doubt.  This recipe yielded about 20 good size pancakes.  One thing I especially liked was that the batter remained stable right down to the last pancake.  Sometimes as you get near the last of a pancake batter, it'll be runnier and produce thinner pancakes.  Not so with this recipe -- perfect from beginning to end.  THANK YOU for this fantastic, absolutely scrumptious recipe! :)

Followed the recipe w/addition of a Tblsp of vanilla extract.  Served topped with fresh sweetened blackberries & whipped cream.  By far, the BEST pancake ever!!!  Thanks for making my Sunday a.m. breakfast for our guests memorable.

100x better than the recipe I usually use - you know, the one on the back of the box?! I scaled the recipe to 8 servings then kept most measurements as written except: used 2-1/2 tablespoons sugar (increased a tad), 1/4 cup milk (decreased a tad), & 1/4 tsp. salt (cut in half). I allowed the milks & eggs to get to room temp before adding the cooled melted butter. I resisted the temptation to over mix & used butter flavor cooking spray on my griddle. We got a bakers dozen of the best moist & fluffy, slightly sweet & tangy pancakes ever! They were great without butter/syrup even! Yeah, it was a bit more work than my usual pancakes but not much more really & oh so worth the extra effort!

I think these were the best pancakes that I have ever had!  YUM! The only change was to add 1/4 cup of white sugar opposed to 3 tbsp.  I din't get my ingredients to room temp like some suggested..and my pancakes were fluffy and delicious.  Will make again and again and again.

5 *stars* here! I usually make Alton Brown's bulk pancake mix, but decided on these today. I added a splash of vanilla extract to the ingredients, and used the faux buttermilk (sour milk = w/vinegar) instead. These came out EXCELLENT, nice and fluffy too! Any cons? Maybe a tad bit too eggy, but still worth the 5 stars. Thanks for sharing this recipe! It's going on my blog "Mommy? I'm Hungry!".

We had breakfast for dinner tonight at my in-laws and these were a huge hit! So much better than a box. I used the vinegar/milk substitute for the buttermilk and eggs from a friend rather than store bought. I'm not sure either of those would make a significant difference. I highly recommend this recipe and so does my family!

I had good luck with this recipe but admitedly I tweaked it. We are whole grain people so my recipe was 2 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour with 1/2 cup of white unbleached, then I added 1/2 cup of extra buttermilk, 1/2 tsp raspberry flavor, 1/2 tsp almond flavor, and  I cup crushed raspberries. Then instead of adding the eggs all together I separated yolks from whites, beat the whites stiff, and I had the fluffiest pancakes. I find that separating egg yolks and whites like this always makes the fluffiest of pancakes, but it is the best solution for wholewheat and  essential for  buckwheat  pancakes or you could have a lump of lead in your stomach.

I made this recipe as written with the exception that I replaced the 1/2 cup milk with buttermilk.  The batter was so thin that it dripped!  I added close to 2 cups (all I had on hand) of my homemade pancake mix and it just thickened the batter enough that I could make pancakes.  The taste was wonderful with the addition of the pancake mix.  Because the recipe makes a lot, I will probably make them again, remembering to add the pancake mix.

Did not change a thing about this recipe, it is perfect.  My pancakes were light and fluffy.  I added chocolate chips to some of mine and they were delicious!!  Made them for mother’s day and my mom one of the most pickiest eaters ever born loved them and made me make extra so she could have some for later.  If you are going to freeze them make sure the pancakes are nice and cooled off then wrap in plastic wrap.  To re-warm them defrost, preheat oven to 350 and bake for 10 minutes or until they are heated all the way through.  Make sure to place them in a single layer.  I will be making this recipe again and again.

I am a buttermilk pancake fanatic, and this recipe is **the one**.  I did add the 1 T of vanilla, as recommended: yum!  Instead of letting the buttermilk and milk come to room temperature for an hour, I just warmed them in the microwave a bit.  Don't stir past big lump stage!!!  Thank you for this recipe!

Excellent! I made 1/2 the recipe which was plenty for 4 of us. Halving it called for 1 1/2 eggs so I used one egg and one egg white. I'm wondering if using all egg whites would make them fluffier.   I added a teaspoon of vanilla as suggested by other reviewers.

Breakfast has been over for at least an hour and the whole family is still raving about these pancakes.  This recipe makes the lightest, fluffiest, moistest pancakes in the civilized world.  I will be making these again, probably tomorrow.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I added 3 T vinegar to the 3 C milk to make it sour and omitted the extra 1/2 C regular milk. Other than that no changes and the pancakes turned out beautifully.

I made this pancake for breakfast and they were good as my children would say 'the best pancake ever'. As I did not have any buttermilk in hand, I use 2 1/2 cups of milk and 1 cup of low fat natural yogurt and and it taste as good indeed. oh, I did add chocolate chips to half of the batter and the children and hubby love it. Sure a keeper.

Very runny mixture. I had to add tons more sugar and cinnamon to make them edible. They were not nice fluffy pancakes,they were very flat,no taste at all. Total waste of my time.

These are the best pancakes I've ever made. Those store mixes just won't do after this. I added fresh blueberries and a bit of vanilla. YUM! The only real problem with this recipe is that my daughter wants me to make it for dinner every night!

OHMIGOSH!!!  These are the best ever!  Extremely light and fluffy!  (Anyone who doesn't get a light and fluffy pancake with this recipe is probably mixing them too long or too well.  The batter should be definitely lumpy.  Also be sure your baking powder still has its zing.)

I followed the recipe exactly as written (well, okay, I was a tiny bit short on milk, so I added a splash of water).  These were outstanding! Everyone in the family thought they were great, even Her Royal Highness, the 10 yo who doesn't like anything.  It supercedes our previous favorite. It's a keeper.

I only had 2c of buttermilk! So... substituted 1c of plain Greek yogurt  - worked AMAZING! 

Do NOT over-mix. This is not the time for OCD. Smooth=flat and tough. Lumpy=fluffy and tender.

Also added blueberries and bananas.

I made these using the dried butter powder, dried buttermilk,dried milk and dried eggs so I could have a "just add water" pancake mix and I have to say it is really good.  I was shocked :)

My family loved this! I found it very easy to make and I am always looking for recipes to use up left over buttermilk. I made the first 3 as the recipe suggested and then I added some more milk because I like my pancakes thinner. I thought I would have enough left over to freeze but my family finished off the left overs at lunch the same day. I will def keep this recipe and use it often, Thanks!

Very nice! Tender and tastey pancakes. I'm out of all purpose, so used half white whole wheat flour and half spelt and it worked out fine. Changing the servings to 3 and calculating the recipe gave me 7 pancakes, 4 to freeze for another day!

I'm still looking for the perfect pancake recipe, but this one is the best I have found so far. The batter is quite chunky and I have to spread it out with a spoon after I dollop it on the fry pan, otherwise I would get inch thick pancakes. It turns out pretty good, but has a little bit of a baking powder aftertaste.

Excellent recipe!  Loved, loved, loved these pancakes. The recipe as written makes much more than 12, 5 inch pancakes.  I made at least 24 pancakes. I found that I had to mix it quite thoroughly to incorporate all of the flour, even though the recipe warns you not to over mix.  They turned out perfect regardless.

Wow!!  These are the BEST pancakes ever! They rise well and taste marvelous! I believe the secret is to not overmix. The batter was still very lumpy, yet they came out perfectly. My husband said they're better than IHOP, and those are pretty darn good pancakes.  Followed recipe exactly. These make a lot of pancakes, so next time I'll halve the recipe for just 2 of us.
UPDATE: Had leftovers that I had frozen from the first review, and when heated in the microwave were just as good as the first time. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.

These pancakes are an almost exact copy of the recipe I took years to come up with (so much for talent,:).  I use somewhat more sugar and no milk (when the batter is too stiff I use more buttermilk).  You will not go wrong following this great recipe exactly.  I must say, that it has enough butter to not need any grease on the pan.  A hot non-stick pan will cook your wonderful, light breakfast fare.

Good recipe but the portion is off. I followed the recipe but find it is too salty and too loose. Next time I will use very little salt and no milk. The 3 cups buttermilk is enough.

These were the best pancakes I have ever made!  They looked great, tasted great, and kept in the freezer for a week's worth of breakfast for my school aged son!  I took the advice and didn't over stir them.  That is definatly the key to successful pancakes!

these just turned out okay.  not sure what went wrong since my first batch of pancakes, the batter was nice and thick, but then all of a sudden it got VERY runny!  pretty much unuseable!  so i added more flour to thicken it up some.  i just wasn't impressed by this recipe, though it did make a ton of pancakes.  maybe they'll taste better reheated... :-(

We've been hunting for a delicious pancake recipe, and this is IT!  I made it exactly following the recipe, except that I was perhaps 1/4 c. shy of buttermilk, so I upped the whole milk to compensate.  I added a bit more milk during cooking, as it naturally continued to thicken up, but it was certainly delicious!

These are  by far the lightest, fluffiest pancakes I've ever made.  Don't substitute milk and vinegar for the buttermilk.  Using the real thing makes all the difference.

These had no flavor, NOT fluffy, almost like a weird french toast texture. A total waste of time and ingredients.  I'll stick to the Betty Crocker recipe I've used for years.

These were so good.  I think the melted butter makes the difference between this and my old recipe.  Slightly crispy with a soft, fluffy interior.  Very yummy.

Outstanding!  I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  The only things that I'd like to mention is that this made 15 large pancakes and I made them on a round electric griddle set at 375 degrees.  I also think it's important to let the milk, buttermilk, egg mixture come close to room temperature befor mixing with the dry ingredients.  I think this enhances the rise in the pancakes.  My entire family gave this 5 stars and I thank the original poster!

Superb, light texture! Made the whole recipe and froze individually on a tray, then bagged. It's easy to remove as many as wanted and pop into the microwave for a quick breakfast treat. Be careful not to overheat the griddle. These brown faster than some because of the buttermilk.

I have been searching for the right buttermilk pancake recipe for a few years. My family has had to taste everyone. Little did I know, this was the one I was searching for. I should have started with this one. Easy, excellent and good!

So delicious! I accidently made the full amount for just 3 people and ended up with alot left over. I just put the batter in the fridge and had fresh pancakes for the next three days! They were just as great on day 3 as they were on day one (maybe even better!) I think I'll make the same mistake next time!

These are so good, I can't eat pancakes from a mix anymore.  Could not believe how fluffy they were!  I have also made with 2 cups whole wheat/1 cup all-purpose flour; still wonderful.  These have become a family favourite.

I also "made" buttermilk with regular milk and vinegar because I didn't have any buttermilk on hand and this was a last minute meal.  They were delicious!  Best pancakes we've ever made.  After making them for the second time, however, I found that they are much fluffier if you leave out the extra 1/2 cup of milk.

These are fantastic!!! I doubt I'll ever try any other pancake recipe! When you blend them all together, they foam somewhat- you know they'll be light & fluffy. Like it  says,don't overmix- it will be lumpy. Not to worry! They come ouy perfect. Use 350 degrees on your griddle. Watch carefully! Thank you so much for the terrific recipe!!!

These pancakes were totally AWESOME!  My husband is a pancake afficionado and he loved these.  Only thing I added was vanilla extract.  Two were made without it and there was a definite flavor difference without the vanilla.  YUMMY

I can't say enough good things about this recipe!  The pancakes were EXTREMELY fluffy -- so fluffy that my boyfriend wanted to add a little extra milk to thin the batter slightly.  Half of the pancakes were made as the recipe stated (which were perfect if you ask me) and the other half got about an 1/8 cup of extra milk.  Both ways were exceptionally fluffy!  Out of a possible five stars, this one gets ten!

Delicious!  I needed a recipe to use up some lowfat buttermilk I had in my fridge and this was perfect.  The fact that my buttermilk was lowfat didn't even make a difference in taste.  I scaled the recipe to 4 and it made 6 nice size pancakes with no batter left in the bowl- 3 for me and 3 for hubby who says no more pancake mix after this.  Definately will be making these again - maybe tomorrow! (I didn't use all the buttermilk)

I thought the flavour of these pancakes was fantastic, however, my pancakes turned out very flat and rubbery in texture. I didn't alter the recipe although the directions had no mention of the salt and sugar...not my favorite recipe...try the "fluffy canadian pancake" recipe eh!

Theses are really really wonderful and really hit the spot! I followed recipe exactly and ended up with 13 large pancakes that were light and fluffy. In some of the batter I added semi sweet chocolate chips! I look forward to freezing the leftover pancakes :) thanks for sharing!

Wow. These pancakes were amazing. I won't be seen at Denny's any time soon for breakfast. I threw some blueberries on the top before I flipped the pancake. Made them taste even better. The pancakes were so fluffy and tasty. I cannot wait to make them for my mother.

Excellent recipe! The key is not to over mix. I scaled down the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp. Still very good. Used honey instead of sugar. Will make this again and again and again.

Oh my God, this had to be the best batch of pancakes I've made thus far. My uncle reckoned them to a staple restaurant on the south side of Chicago Hyde Park, called Valois. Light, fluffy & succulent, accompanied with Vermont maple syrup. !!!!

From a family that used to rely on Bisquick for pancakes (Ugg... can't believe I did that!), I have to say they are easy and delicious. I have followed the recipe to a T and they have turned out great every time.  A few times I have added some vanilla to the mix and even a few extra eggs sometimes to get that extra protein.  I am going to try blueberries next.  This is just a great buttermilk pancake!!!

Excellent recipe! Perfect pancake. Taste like something I ordered at my favorite local pancake joint but it's from my kitchen. Best advice I read and followed: don't over mix the batter, flour fruit or items prior to mixing with batter to keep them from sinking. Also, let wet mix items (eggs, buttermilk, milk) sit out at room temperature for an hour before use. We made blueberry and banana with pecan pancakes - so good! Enjoy!

These are fantastic pancakes!  If you follow the pancake making tricks mentioned by others on here...do not overmix (there will still be some small clumps of flour here and there) and make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature before starting, you will end up with amazingly fluffy pancakes.  I'm not sure why so many complained about the amount the recipe makes...if you use the exact recipe and use 1/2 cup batter/pancake it makes 12 - 5 inch pancakes just like the recipe says.  For years I was in search of a pancake that matched a famous restaurant chain's and I've made many similar recipes, but all it really took was using a couple special techniques to get the desired result!

We found this pancake recipe about 8 years ago and haven't made a different recipe since.  We have never had a bad pancake with this recipe.  We like vanilla and cinnamon in our pancakes, so we usually add that too, and we have added pumpkin to it to make pumpkin pancakes.  We also add fruit to it sometimes as well.  But we always start with this recipe.  We have used different types of flour as well and they still turn out to be the BEST!!  We always make a full recipe and freeze the leftovers so we have breakfast for a few days afterward.  THANK YOU for a GREAT recipe!

This is the BEST pancake recipe EVER! We were living in Belize for a few months, and yes we are moving there permanently! Some things you can't leave behind. We found this recipe and added a few flares of our own.

First, in Belize we found someone who sells raw milk for about $1.50us per gallon...AWESOME! So we made REAL buttermilk by letting it set out and 'clabber'. This proved to be excellent in so many ways! Do a search on it, it opens the door to sooo many culinary options.

Second, I know that everyone says, 'Don't overmix', but I make sure to mix my batter THOROUGHLY, and I am always pleased. My pancakes turn out like fluffy pillows of heaven, and NEVER DRY! Especially with this recipe.

Make sure your butter is melted before adding to your mix, and make them BIG! I hate little pancakes that look like they were an accident...

The real deal.  Thick, fluffy, delicious.  I don't use syrup, so I added another tbsp of sugar.  The stuff of my dreams.

Delicious pancakes!  I had been using another recipe from this site but this will be my go-to from now on.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and it made 4 pancakes each for the two of us. I also made the batter an hour ahead and let us sit and become foamy, which made for a nice thick and fluffy pancake.

Been making it 3 Sundays in a row!  When I noticed the last few pancakes were turning out better (fluffier) than the first, I started to mix all the ingredients right away and let it sit for 30 minutes or more before cooking.  By the way, this makes A LOT of pancakes!

Perfect recipe just as is. The only thing I changed was the mixing order. I mixed the baking soda with the buttermilk instead of with the dry ingredients. I have found from my favorite scone recipe that does this, it makes for an even lighter, dough. The baking powder is added with the flour. I added the butter before the eggs so as not to cook the egg. thanks for a fantastic recipe.

This recipe make pancakes that are as good as any I have ever eaten! I used whole milk followed the recipe and followed the recipe, except I used one cup of whole milk. Not because of knowledge or experience, but because I was not paying attention. They came out fantastic!

I paid close attention to the yeild since other reviewers mentioned it so often. I made 23 6-7" pancakes!

A few tips if I may.
Heat skillet to 375 degrees.
Do not overstir, small lumps are good!
Let the batter sit for 15 -20 minutes before cooking. The pancakes toward the end of my batch came out nicer than the first.

I scaled this back to make eight servings.  They truly are the lightest fluffiest pancakes.  I will certainly make again.

I had high hopes for these pancakes but they didn't meet them. They rose fairly well but didn't taste like anything. I'll definately stick to my dad's pancake recipe.

2.25.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24530/buttermilk-pancakes-ii/ ... I can't believe I haven't rated this!  'Was on a mission after trying so many average pancake recipes.  This is the BEST BUTTERMILK RECIPE EVER!  I've been trying, I know!  :D  Only suggestion is to warm the milk a little so the butter doesn't firm up when you add it.  It remelts, but I "feel" better having it smooth.  Full amount of butter is fabulous, but I only use 3T.  Fluffy Pancakes by Kris are really good nonbuttermilk pancakes, too. Note:  I only use 3T melted butter.  Entire isn't too much, just so much fat/  KK likes these better than fluffy, which are awesome, too.OUR WARM BLUEBERRY TOPPING: 1/4c sugar, 1T cornstarch, 1/8t cinnamon, pinch salt.  Bring to boil over medium till thickened.  Add 2t butter & 1pt blueberries.

These were awesome!  I actually made these on my waffle iron and they turned out perfectly.  Crispy on outside and light and fluffy in the middle.  Definitely a keeper!

Best pancakes I've ever made!! They were fluffy and tender... unlike any pancake i've ever made. I used to get a knife whenever I would have to cut my son's pancakes because the box mixes can be rubbery and tough on the outside. Now he can cut his own with just his fork! And its also great that the ingredients are very basic. These are things most people have in their pantry anyway. It's perfect for those mornings when there is nothing else to eat in the house and everyone is too lazy to get up and go to the store!!!

Delish!!! This has become my favorite pancake recipe of all time! I usually have to triple this recipe for my family of 4. I've made this recipe using real buttermilk as well as mixing 1 tbls vinegar to 1 cup milk when I've been in a pinch & out of buttermilk. I've made this recipe countless times & have tweaked it before to suit different tastes...added vanilla/orange/almond extracts...more sugar/less sugar...you get the point. AS IS though this recipe is GOLD! 10 stars if I could!!!

I made these pancakes yesterday. These are the Best pancakes I have ever made. They were light, fluffy and a delicious taste. I also read other reviews before making and left  the milk and eggs to sit and get to room temperature before adding the melted butter. My children LOVED them. I shall definitely be making these again

All I can say is "Wow"! These are the best pancakes I have ever made! Melt in your mouth good!
I also back up KLUGLE in agreeing that you will get excellent results if you allow your milk and eggs come to room temperature. The ingredients incorporate better - i.e. the melted butter doesn't "clump up" like it would if added to cold milk - a little kitchen science for you!

I have never submitted a review before but these pancakes changed that.  They are absolutely the best pancakes I have ever had.  I have loved pancakes all my life but have never had any to compare with the pancakes from this recipe.  I was skeptical after mixing the ingredients as it seemed to be too thick however I followed the recipe exactly.  And I'm glad I did not try changing anything.  The pancakes literally melted in my mouth.  The texture was great and the taste was fantastic.   Like others have commented "I will never buy a commericially made pancake mix again!"

I gave it 4 stars because I feel the batter was too thick and needed to be thinner.  I did use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose which gave them a denser consistency.  The flavor was delicious.  I did let the buttermilk, egg sit out until room temp, about 1 hour.  I used half butter and half home made lard, which I think gives better flavor and if they had been a bit thinner would have been out of this world, still good though.  I used the handy calculator to reduce recipe to 4 servings.

This is almost exactly the recipe that I've been using for years from my standard Better Homes and Gardens cookbook.  the only difference is that the BHG recipe calls for 6 T. of vegetable oil instead of butter.  The butter makes it richer.  I find that it helps to let the finished batter sit for 5 minutes (about how long it takes to heat my griddle) before cooking the pancakes.  You can also add grated apples and cinnamon to the batter or blueberries or my kids' favorite: chocolate chips.  Great, easy standard recipe.  I'll never go back to using a store-bought mix again!

The ideal basic buttermilk pancakes.  This is so much better than any buttermilk pancake mix you could buy.   I added some fresh blueberries to make a perfect breakfast.

These pancakes are delicious.  I wanted to just make a few pancakes, so I cut the recipe in 1/3, because most of the items are in increments of three.  However, some of the stuff is already in really small quantities, so I used common sense.  If you're interested in making about six to eight pancakes for one or two people here are the easy, rounded measurements for the 1/3 recipe:  A pinch of salt, 1.5 tablespoons of melted butter, and two tablespoons of milk.  HIGHLY recommend greasing your pan or griddle with bacon grease.  You won't need more than a teaspoon of it if you take a napkin and spread it around.  That way you're not adding a bunch of fat and cholesterol, but there IS a definite, subtle flavor and aroma difference.  I wanted to note that I used the thick-style (old fashioned, etc) buttermilk.  I'm pretty sure that that's what the person who wrote this recipe intended, because my pancakes were perfect.  If you're having issues with this recipe, try regular, thick buttermilk, not low fat.  You might have to hunt around, since low fat has become so DARNED ubiquitous, but it'll be worth the trouble.  Ironically, try looking at a health food store, like Sprouts or Whole Foods.  If you need something to do with the remainder of the buttermilk, may I suggest a homemade ranch dressing!  That's actually what I was hunting down my buttermilk for in the first place.  Tata everyone!  Great recipe!

I cannot believe that this came out as good as it did. I cut the recipe in half. I used dried buttermilk, 2 eggs (because 1.5 seemed silly), and a little more than 1 and a half cups of water instead of any milk or buttermilk. Flavor was great, and the fluffy factor was awesome! As someone else mentioned, I used room temp ingredients.

These are The Pancake recipe.  We really loved it.  Great pancake very tender but not airy.  Mine also rose wonderfully.  Defintely worth buying the quart of Buttermilk to make them right.

The only problem with these is they're so good, you eat too many!  Wonderful flavor, light and fluffy.  I added a teaspoon of Vanilla for an added boost.  Great  pancakes for Sunday morning tradition.  Thanks for sharing.

These truly are delicious!  I cut the recipe down to 4 servings and ended up with 8 good sized pancakes which was perfect.  I was concerned about the lumps in the batter at first but once cooked it was no issue at all.  Try adding Grandma's Buttermilk Corn Bread (from here) to use up more of that buttermilk and have breakfast for dinner.  That's what we did and the kids loved it all.

We made these pancakes for the first time today.  We followed the recipe exact and then towards the end of cooking, added some milk to thin the batter as it had become quite thick while setting.  We also added blueberries to some of the pancakes and they turned out great.  Definately better to use fresh buttermilk, but as other reviewers said-freeze your leftovers and microwave it next time you need it.  A definate must-melt the butter first and LET IT COOL...if yuou don't, you'll get chunky butter which cooled too fast, or worse-cooked eggs in the batter.

I've cooked plenty of recipes from this site, but this is the first one that has actually moved me to write a review.  These are by far the best pancakes I have ever had.  Delicious, flavorful, fluffy.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion of letting the liquid come to room temp before mixing with the dry ingredients, and only mixed them up enough to make sure I had no dry flour left.  Throw them on the griddle, add maple syrup, and enjoy heavenly pancakes.  I'll never make another kind again.

Starting with the dry ingredients I dumped everything into my Waring blender, pulsed on low for 1 minute and starting pouring ¼ cup batter into my pre- heated Teflon egg pan. After cooking on side number 1 for about one minute  I sprinkled sliced blackberries on top and then flipped the cake to cook the other side.  OMG! These cakes were yummy. I ate mine covered in Maple syrup standing at the kitchen counter , feeding every other bite to my dog. He loved them as well.

My husband made these pancakes when we had company and we compared them to the Mom's Buttermilk Pancake recipes, like some other comments suggested.  We won't make these again, we think the other recipe is easier and delicious - this one calls for sugar which sweetened them too much.

I make these one of twice every couple of week just for 2. This recipe is authentic and the taste can't be beat! These freeze very very well (just put wax paper between each pancake, and then warm them up in the microwave). I often add blueberries.

I was genuinely disappointed with the lack of flavor.  I realize now that people go to recipes like this because there are so many ratings,  but these were very liquidy and blah.  I was expecting to be bowled over.  I also realize I don't care for sugar in the Buttermilk Pancakes, I don't think it's necessary.  I love the Mom's Buttermilk Pancakes but saw this one had so many reviews so I thought I'd better try it.  So now I think people keep trying this one since it has so many reviews but it's been on here for almost 10 years.  The other recipe is quicker and tastes better, so I'm going to stick with that one.  Just my honest opinion.

These were excellent...I really liked the "egginess" of them.  I only had 1 1/2 cups buttermilk so subbed 2% for the rest and they were great!

Delicious! I make up a jumbo batch of these and then freeze the pancakes individually in plastic baggies. My son can "make" his own pancakes in the morning before school by throwing one of the frozen cakes in the micro for about a minute. They hold up and taste great even after having been frozen for several days.

Delicious.  Nice buttery flavor.  Very filling, though...I could only eat one large pancake!  I still have batter in the fridge and I have 5 roommates....This recipe makes A LOT of pancakes.

I'll stick to my other recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and the batter was way too thick. I had to add whole milk to thin it for pouring. They did not have a great flavor either. They were missing something.

I hate pancakes.  Well I thought I did until I had these!!  These were light and fluffy and so delicious.  I will never buy boxed pancake mix again.  When I made them I heated some frozen strawberries, cornstarch & little sugar for a strawberry topping.  Topped it with whipped cream.  Was stuffed for days.  Thanks for a great pancake recipe!  Also, don't stir the batter too much.  I made them a few times and noticed the ones that came out most fluffy and light were the ones I didn't stir much--there will be some lumps--don't stir them out.

Definitely DON'T overstir!!  The batter will be super lumpy!!  I made the first griddleful and they were puffy and thick, I stirred the batter a little more to get rid of lumps.  The rest of the pancakes were thin and more like Swedish pancakes or crepes.  The taste was really good, but personally I like my pancakes thicker and heartier.  These were pretty airy.

Although it needs light modification, this is a very good recipe. I adjusted it to serve 4. After mods it is: 1cup flour, 1cup buttermilk, 1 teaspoon each baking soda and powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 heaping tablespoon brown sugar, 4 tablespoons milk, 2 tablespoons real butter, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.   They taste better than the pancakes we make at work(a local steakhouse that serves breakfast). They are so good the owner is concidering changing the recipe to my mod. Thanks to the uploader for the excellent starting point.

These are a much requested breakfast in my house. They are perfect every time -light, fluffy and beautiful!  I've used powdered buttermilk (about 2c), I've used the substitute of 3 Tbsp white vinegar plus enough 2% milk to equal 3 cups (let sit about 5 minutes to sour) & of course good ol' buttermilk -all work great but obviously the real thing is best!  I usually use Splenda instead of sugar (double what the recipe calls for) and I add a tsp or two of vanilla.  I often make these just to freeze for the kids -I wrap each cooled pancake individually with plastic wrap and place them all in gallon freezer bags.  They are a quick, tasty breakfast defrosted in the microwave (the toaster dries them out too much) served with Brown & Serve Sausage Links and fresh fruit!  Baby #3 is on the way any day now so I'm working on a large batch right now to freeze so I'll have a few easy breakfasts when we return from the hospital!  I'd give these 10 stars if I could!  One batch makes about 32 (3 inch) pancakes which I make using a 1/4 measuring cup.

Oh, these pancakes are the best ones I've ever had! Light and fluffy with just a tiny bit of crispness around the edge, yum! I followed other reviewer's advice and barely mixed this. I mean there were flour bubbles everywhere! Thanks because these turned out perfect.

I had to add a bit more buttermilk to get the consistency I wanted and still they were quite thick.  I might thin a bit more next time.  Great tasting!  If you use a 1/2 cup measure to pour the batter out you'll end up with VERY large pancakes.  I think 1/4 cup would be better.

Absoultey delicious. Makes a very big batch....too much for my family of four (2 kids - 2 adults). WIll cut the batter in 1/2 next time.  This recipe is just what I was looking for. I might try macadamia and bananans mushed up next time and try some cocount syrup to remind me of breakfast in Maui. YUM!

What a great recipe!  I posted a request on the recipe exchange and this was a recommendation and I'm so glad it was!  It does make a ton, so I cooled them, wrapped them in saran and separated them with wax paper, refrigerated them and then put them in the freezer for a great breakfast the quick and easy way.  I also added a 12 oz. bag of frozen wild blueberries that I thawed and rinsed.  This will be my go-to pancake recipe.

I have made these a number of times now and each time they come out perfect. I made them when visiting my family and everyone who ate them said they were the BEST pancakes they ever had! My husband loves to snack on them later in the day and just eats them cold and plain. Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing it!!

This recipe is by far the best I've ever made or tried! For fluffier pancakes, here's a few tips: 1)Warm the eggs to at least room temp; 2)warm the milk and buttermilk to a little warmer than room temp; 3)add the eggs, milk and buttermilk in one bowl and beat lightly to mix; 4) when adding to the flour mixture, beat gently with a whisk just until it's incorporated, then mix gently until it's still somewhat lumpy. These were over an inch thick, fluffy and delicious!

Unbelievable! This recipe was very easy to make and to be honest - I've never had pancakes this good - especially ones that I made from scratch! We won't bother with the boxes anymore. This recipe is unbeatable! I did add vanilla and cinnamon for a bit of a kick. Also - resist the urge to try and spread your batter out to make thinner pancakes - these are WAY better nice a fluffy. They do take longer to cook than your typical box pancake though - so be patient! Thanks for an awesome recipe - to everyone else - ENJOY!
****REVIEW UPDATE****
Just thought I'd add a bit more to my previous review - after rediscovering this recipe (can't believe I ever forgot it!) my family has fallen head over heels for it again. Two tips to add though - first - if you don't have buttermilk, just sour your milk with lemon juice - put about 2 TBS lemon juice in your measuring pitcher and then add milk to make up your 3 cups let sit while you prep your other ingredients and voila! you have buttermilk. I think that's why I "forgot" about the recipe because I never have buttermilk on hand - doing it this way makes the pancakes every bit as good and you don't have to worry about having buttermilk if you don't usually buy it. The other tip is these pancakes freeze amazingly well! I now make a huge batch every Saturday and then freeze what we don't eat - pop them in the toaster during the week and they almost seem to taste better - crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.

Very Very good! I usually try to make my own buttermilk with lemon juice or vinegar but YOU NEED to get the real buttermilk! It makes it so much better. I also add 1/4 cup sugar. Also, don't overmix, keep it clumpy: makes fluffier pancakes! Try this recipes, it's delicious!

Edit: on my second making of the recipe I cut out all of the sugar and added a tsp and a half of real vanilla essence. It's even better and more delicious!

I halved the servings (to 6) and also halved the amount of sugar. Because the recipe then called for 1 1/2 eggs I just used 1 egg. It came out perfectly. At first I thought there was far too much batter for three people. But, using 1/2 cup per pancake it make 6 perfect equal size pancakes. It was brill! My guest thoroughly enjoyed them and wolfed them down.

I also had 1/2 cup less buttermilk than was required so I was forced to add another 1/2 cup non-fat milk. Worked like a charm.

These will be my standard buttermilk pancakes now. Thanks!

EXTREMELY FLUFFY! We used whole wheat flour, for buttermilk we mixed 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup plain natural yogurt (which is actually good for you), honey instead of sugar and omitted the butter!!!  They were great!  Next time I'll used natural baking soda and natural baking powder to make it a 100% natural pancake!!! WOO!  Highly recommend this recipe!!!!!

I have been looking for the perfect pancake recipe, and I've finally found it.  This recipe makes pancakes that are perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  I used whole wheat flour, Splenda instead of sugar, and smart balance instead of regular butter to make it healthier, and they were still just incredible. I will never use another pancake recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!

These were just okay for us.  They were light and fluffy but not the best on this site.  I used half whole wheat flour, maybe that was the problem?  You have to try the Good Old Fashioned Pancakes, they are amazing!!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I doubled the recipe so we can have enoug for 2 to 3 days worth of eating.  I bake mine in a castiron skillet and with each pancake I add 1 tsp margarine in skillet just before baking them.  I also added in 2 TBSP extra sugar and 1 TBSP vanilla too.  The pancakes were fluffy and they melted in your mouth.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Without a doubt, the best pancakes I've ever made, and I've tried many!  I did add a little vanilla, but that's our personal taste.  These freeze beautifully and go from freezer to toaster to table with no problem.  Simply place them in single layers between sheets of parchment or waxed paper, put them on a cookie sheet and freeze.  After they're frozen, remove from the cookie sheet and place in ziploc bags, then remove and toast as needed.  Perfection!  Thanks for a great recipe that we'll use again and again!

Oh wow, were these every good!!!  When we were home for Christmas, I made  these pancakes TWO days in a row!!!  One thing that made this recipe easy, I poured the batter into a liquid measuring cup, from there I was able to pour "uniform" sized pancakes!  This is definately a great recipe!

Don't try too hard to not overmix - I did on my first try, and I had LARGE clumps and the pancake had blotches of white dry mix! It was also quite bland, even after adding 1tsp vanilla to 1/3 of the batch. I still don't know what I did wrong and I was going to rate this recipe badly, but decided to try again. This time, I followed the advices and beat the egg whites separately and folded it into the batter AFTER mixing the dry/wet parts, and let it sit overnight - this morning (Mother's day), I heat the pan up until a few drops of water took 7-8 seconds to evaporate, and cooked the pancakes a little less than 2min each side without oil. They turned out to be light, fluffy and actually had some (eggy) taste! Do NOT overcook, the least bit of overcooking will hide the taste of the pancakes! Also, to get it crisp, undercook it slightly and toast them briefly in the oven/toaster. My mom even asked me where I bought the pancakes!

These were very good. My 9 yr old said that they were better than good, they were great. The first time I added items and mixed well. They were so runny that I could not flip them. The next time I added it together right at the end and did not stir much. The batter looked a little lumpy but came out good.

had thought that this recipie was the greatest, that is until will found Mammaw's Waffles from this site.  The batter makes THE BEST pancakes.  HAven't even tried them as waffles yet.  This recipie is good, but flat because of the lack of yeast and not very flavorful unless you add vanilla.

I had some buttermilk that I wanted to used up so I came upon this receipe. I made the pancakes but I couldn't figure out why it was so flat and kind of dense not fluffy like the other reviewers. My youngest son loved it and my husband said it tasted pretty good. Just a little while ago I made myself some coffee and I was looking for my half and half and staring right at me was the container of buttermilk. I used the half and half by mistake!!! Grr. I will make these pancakes again in a day or so and I will use the right ingredient.

these waffles are great. letting them sit out for the 40 mins. really made the difference and they were very light and fluffy and tasty. Just remember to put less batter in the iron than you need because this batter really puffs up and i made a mess out of my waffle iron by putting in too much batter! thanks!

I wasn't sure just what the fresh buttermilk meant. We used to churn our buttermilk when I grew up on the farm. I wasn't about to try that again so I used buttermilk from the supermarket. I made the recipe using all the ingridents listed except only about half 1/2 tbs sugar. I did seperate the eggs and beat the whites until fluffy and folded into the wet mixture (cause that's what my wife does when she makes her wonderful pancakes). I thought that my pancakes were every bit as tasty and fluffy as hers... and that's saying a LOT! VERY fluffy and VERY tasty! I've fixed these with and without beating the egg whites and beating the egg whites make them even more fluffy! If you don't like these, you've done something wrong!

I will never buy another box of pancake mix again. This recipe was very easy to make and delicious. I threw in some frozen blueberries and the pancakes came out perfect. Thank you!

My family LOVED these!!  I did not have buttermilk, so I had to improvise a little.  I had some left-over heavy cream from another recipe, so I added half regular milk and half heavy cream along with 3 tablespoons lemon juice.  They were fantastic.  I also added a dash of cinnamon.  My kids asked me to make them everyday!!  They couldn't get enough!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used buttermilk made from buttermilk powder instead of fresh buttermilk and they turned out great.   I also made the recipe for 4 servings instead of 12 and this made exactly 4 large (6 1/2") pancakes.  The batter was thin (unlike what a previous reviewer said) and the pancakes were a little less fluffy than I would have liked.  (Could be the buttermilk powder??)  All in all a nice recipe though.

Every other night, my brother and I try a new pancake or waffle recipe. We were so excited when we came across this one because of the rave reviews. But to our dissapointment, they did not turn out anything like we expected. Every pancake came out flat and the inside was doughy no matter how low and long I cooked it for. Maybe it was us that did something wrong, but we followed the recipe to a T. Unfortunately, we are still looking for our favorite pancake recipe =)

These are AWESOME!!  Don't leave too big of lumps, as they will not cook up right (lumps of flour through out the pancake).  I made a big batch & froze them in packs of six for an easy anytime breakfast.  Thanks Lebury!

I didn't like pancakes until I found this recipe.  Its wonderful.  The pancakes are light and tender.  They're good for any meal and cold right out of the fridge.  Served them for a company breakfast this weekend and got rave reviews.  I've found the recipe makes 20/21 generous pancakes.

These pancakes were very thick and fluffy with a strong buttermilk flavour. The best recipe I've ever tried, too! I froze them and then just popped them in the toaster to reheat them and they were a hit. I tried adding frozen blueberries to one batch and they were great. Frozen strawberries, however, made the pancakes too wet to cook through before burning.

I've used the same buttermilk pancake recipe for nearly 20 years.  I used the Buttermilk II recipe today and I think I will discard the old one!  This is really good.

These were excellent.  I love the taste that buttermilk brings to these pancakes.  It does, however, make a LOT of pancakes.  I will half the recipe next time.

We love these pancakes -- our new go to! I've made these for all of our visitors and everyone loves them and asks for the recipe! I usually change the serving size to 8 if it's just the 2 of us and we have a few leftovers. Sometimes, I substitute the white flour for whole wheat and add 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. Ginger to make a healthier version with some spice. www.blissfullycooking.com

Made these this morning and boy are they great! I made them exactly as the recipe stated and they turned out perfectly. The only thing that may be different is I noticed my buttermilk is 'fat free' not sure if that makes any difference at all, but they are so good! I don't understand anyone not thinking these are good. The recipe does make a TON of batter. I am going to try to freeze the actual pancakes and see if they are as good as everyone says after being frozen and microwaved. Definitely a keeper for us. My 9 year old son just ate 4 and is asking for more. Thank you for this great recipe!

Perfect! What I've been searching for forever.  I added 1 tsp. cider vinegar and it really fluffed up. Also added zest of 1/2 orange, 1/4 tsp cloves,  1 tsp cinnamon,  1/4 tsp. cardamom. Spice gave it a nice Fall flavor. I'm freezing the rest for breakfast for the kids for the week.

I just read the other reviews on these and have to disagree. When made with the recipe as written. These are the BEST homemade pancakes I have tried. The recipe made 19 - 5"  delicious pancakes. I will make these again for sure.

My Aunty had a fabulous pancake recipe, but I like baking with buttermilk.  As my Aunty always said, it’s all about the bubbles.  Let the pancake look like a warty toad and flip.  That, and cooking with butter, butter makes everything taste better.   Savory or sweet. These are fabulous pancakes, great for Roly-poly-puddings.

This was the pancake recipe I lost and was so happy to find it again.  The only thing I do is use Kefir instead of buttermilk but these are the fluffiest pancakes you will ever make...assuming you DO NOT over mix them!

this is the best recipe for making homemade pancakes I did this with whole wheat flour and a little white self rising flour.. My boyfriend loved these.. the only thing I didn't do was let the mixture sit for 30min- hour before cooking... but its best to make the mixture cover an let it sit overnight for the next day to make very fluffy and tasty pancakes.

I used half wheat flour. Used mostly brown sugar. Had to use vinegar to sour my milk since I didn't have buttermilk. It makes a large batch and I doubled it and got about 35 pancakes.

These are outstanding.  Goodbye to all box mixes...horray for that.  My husband doesn'thand out ffree compliments hardly ever.  But in Gus words.  "These are really good", then asked if there were anymore.  And leftovers are great too.  I'm making this a family favorite.

This is the only recipe for pancakes that I use. They are easy to make and the have superb taste. Anyone who gives less than 4 stars on these either doesn't know how to cook, or doesn't know what truly delicious pancakes taste like. Let your buttermilk and milk sit out for an hour to get to room temperature. This ensures FLUFFY cakes. Follow the simple steps, and enjoy. I use a quick shot of oil instead of melted margarine, but sometimes leave it out since I oil up the cast iron skillet really well. Cast iron will give you excellent results.

The best pancake recipe I have ever made or tasted! The box mix doesn't compare to these at all. I left the milks and eggs out to get to room temp as another review suggested for the fluffiness.

amazing! I made these this morning for the first time and it came out beautiful! i was feeding for 2 so i only made 1/3 the batch and that gave me 4 (very thick)pancakes. i didnt have enough buttermilk so i just subbed it with low fat milk and it wasnt too bad. next time i'll do what some reviewers suggested and leave the batter overnight for some extra fluffy pancakes :).

The flavor of the batter was good, to a point.  But the texture left much to be desired.  They were spongy. I would call them a light pancake, but they weren't fluffy.  Someone might be tempted to call them that, because they were very light, but rather than a fluffy cake-like texture, they were mostly air, and the result led to a very oily pancake.

These are so delicious! Definitely allow the eggs milk and buttermilk to come to room temperature. I also sifted all my dry ingredients and made a well in the center to pour and mix my wet ingredients. These are just like the "good old fashioned" pancakes, except they use buttermilk. This gives them an even richer, more buttery taste. One last tip, I let the batter set for about ten minutes while I fry up my bacon on my griddle. I then use an old (clean!) ketchup bottle to dispense the batter. Five stars!!!!

This is the best recipe I have found for pancakes. My family loves it especially my 15month old son. Very simple and easy to make. I add blueberries to mine and they are delicious!

Made these this morning they were fantastic! Be sure to preheat your pan or griddle. Yield was 15 large pancakes. Next time I plan to try them with fruit.

This is my go-to pancake recipe, and I have found no others that compare. I've just started halving the recipe in an effort to have my family consume less (you know, calories...) and it worked just fine. This recipe is fantastic with add-ins-- my favorite so far has been with bananas. 

Tip: if you don't have any milk, sub in a little water, and the outside of the pancake gets extra crispy-- which is a favorite feature in my house.

I used sweetened almond milk instead of the buttermilk and milk and they turned out just fine. I also omitted one tablespoon of sugar since the almond milk was sweetened. They are a little more dense with the almond milk, but I believe this could be offset with a half a teaspoon or more of baking powder. I'm sure these would be great with the buttermilk, my wife and I just like to make things healthier.

This recipe makes some of the best pancakes I've ever had, and I worked in a diner for several years that was known for breakfast.  The only thing I've changed is the author's recommendation to leave the mixing until just before cooking.  If you let the batter sit for about 10-15 minutes before cooking, that baking soda really goes to work and the batter starts to expand.  This makes for super pillowy pancakes.  It's like eating buttery clouds.

I have made these pancakes MANY times by now, and they are a consistent hit with my family.  I read a few of the negative reviews because I was curious.  Some reviewers are having problems with lumps of butter in the batter.  When I am putting together the wet ingredients, I melt the butter first thing.  I whisk together the eggs, milk, and buttermilk.  Then I SLOWLY drizzle in the butter, whisking it in as I go.  This makes for a nice smooth batter without the lumps of butter.

The 1st time I made this recipe I could agree with many of the other reviewers( it was way more than 12 servings). I made the recipe the second time and really followed the recipe and got about 14 to 15 pancakes( which is not bad in my opinion ). I did add an extra 2 tablespoons of sugar and I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. It turned out delicious!!! The key is not to over mix! ;) I hope this was helpful!

These are the best pancakes I have ever eaten. The recipe made a lot more than I expected, but that just means more for breakfast tomorrow as well. I also added a little vanilla to my batter.

Batter was too thick and heavy.  I added more milk to thin the batter and sugar to sweeten.  Cooked up thinner and lighter.  Very good.

I live in Ukraine and when my friends wanted to try American "blinchiki" I tried a couple different recipes on here. This one turned out amazing. I didn't know what the equivalent of buttermilk was here so I replaced it with "ryazhenka" (???????) which seemed to have the same consistency. I found out later it's fermented baked milk or something, but whatever, it works awesome.

Fabulous!! I made the pancakes as directed and they were perfect. Light and fluffy without the nasty baking soda taste found in box mixes. This is a thick pancake but not doughy.  I made five 10" pancakes and five 5" pancakes. This will be our new pancake tradition.

These were crazy fluffy! When I first put them in the pan I thought they would be too thick, but don't be fooled. They turned out really well. My tip is to make sure the heat isn't too high as you want to make sure these are cooked right through before the outside is done. My daughter complains a lot if the inside is still battery.

My kids love breakfast for dinner since we don't get that much time in the morning to have pancake, besides frozen. My old pancake recipe was getting boring so I decided to try a buttermilk version and I am so glad I found this recipe. I make the recipe for 16 servings and I got well over 30 pancakes out of that and we aren't talking tiny pancakes, these were a good 5 inches. Best darn pancakes I have had at home!! I bought buttermilk at the store but plan to try to make my 
own for when I can't find it. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I've tried a lot of pancake recipes over the years, and they are always too heavy, thick and dry, so I wind up adding more milk. This is the best pancake recipe ever. I'll never use another. I added 1 t. vanilla because I love vanilla, and sprinkled blueberries into the pancakes immediately after pouring one into the pan, but the recipe would be great as-is. Light, fluffy, and delicious!

I halved the ingredients and followed the recipe exactly. The pancakes turned out way too thick, some raw inside, and the resulting texture was disappointing. I think it needs more milk. Perhaps halving the ingredients alters the wet/dry balance somehow.

Yummmmm. Could use a tad more sugar if you want them naturally sweeter, but overall these were great. Next time I'll add less melted butter and make sure the griddle is on a higher heat. Tip to self for crispy edges: more baking soda, high heat, cook in veg. oil (or fat).

Perfect recipe. I added 1 addtl TBSP of sugar and nothing more.  As others have stated you do not want to over mix this recipe. When you put dry into wet, mix slowly 4-6 folds until you see it's incorporated. It should be lumpy and almost like a beginning paper mache mix. I was able to make 10-12 Texas size pancakes.  I cook for 30 seconds on each side over low.  You know the pancake is ready to flip when all sides are slightly bubbling. I have added fresh blueberries which takes the recipe to a whole different yum factor.  I pour the mix in the pan and immediately add fresh blueberries to the uncooked side. Once the pancake is flipped it seals in the berries. I fed myself, son, daughter, mother and hubby with this recipe.  It has been my go to for years.  If the recipe is not turning out, it is not the recipe, it is an error on the preparers end. My first time I over mixed and they did not rise and were limp cakes, nothing special. Over mixing is the #1 cause of this recipe failure.  I have never used room temp items as my family loves to eat not wait...lol   They always rise beautiful thankfully.  I have found not to mix this recipe until I begin making them as the pancakes tend not to come out as well if I premix. Someday I will freeze and try that as others have had success. This recipe takes time, but it is worth the little effort. TY for sharing a simple but delicious recipe!

A nice pancake recipe. I added vanilla to the batter which was a nice addition.

This is my absolute favorite recipe. I have to admit that I add a little cinnamon and vanilla. But they are just as yummy without. Love em! One hint: use full fat buttermilk or the batter will be a little too thin.

These pancakes are awesome!!  My husband never likes it when I make pancakes for breakfast but after eating these this morning he said he'd give them six stars.  I love pancakes so I'm glad I finally found a recipe everyone likes.  This recipe does make a lot of pancakes, but I like to have some leftover to freeze for the kids so it's perfect for us.

This was easy and yummy.  I mixed the liquid ingredients in the blender to make them fluffy. It was forgiving in that I didn't have enough buttermilk so I added extra milk and a little less flour and they still turned out fluffy and good. I added blueberries which was a nice addition but these were very good even without them. I will definitely make these again. Note: you can keep buttermilk for a very long time: As you use it, add more milk and let it ferment for a day out of the fridge or for a week inside and one carton will make 3 or 4 cartons.

I've been making these pancakes pretty regularly for about two years.  I know the recipe by heart.  I've tried other pancake recipes which are really good, but, these buttermilk pancakes are always the winner.  They're light  and fluffy with a great taste.  

Even with a family of six, I'll have a few left over.  My kids will fight over the leftover pancakes to see who gets them the next morning for breakfast.

So flippin' good! I've never made pancakes from scratch before and these just blew mix out of the water. I fried them in butter instead of oil just because that's my preference. I served them with the cinnamon syrup that you can find on this site. Delicious and fluffy! Will definitely make again. My husband gobbled them up!

very tall and fluffy! The 3 cups of buttermilk was enough liquid, I had to add extra flour as it was a bit thin. Added a tbsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon along with wild blueberries, made 20 pancakes.

BEST RECIPE EVER!  For Buttermilk pancakes.  I did not alter this in any way, shape or form and it was fantastic.  The only issue I had was using a new electric griddle that I hadn't figured out it's hot spots yet.  But otherwise these were light, fluffy and fantastic!

This is from someone who only made pancakes once before (from a premade mix) and burned them.  This was a fantastic recipe.  The buttermilk adds a dense feel that you get from the mega pancakes at breakfast restaurants.  As long as you don't stir the batter too much, they turn out fluffy as well.  Can't stress enough how important it is to leave those flour clumps in.  I left the buttermilk, eggs, and milk sitting out for 40 minutes like another reviewer suggested, which worked well.

I had some leftover buttermilk from making red velvet cupcakes, so I thought I'd give this recipe a shot. WOW. These were some amazing pancakes. I added 3 large overripe bananas that I also had sitting around (maybe about 1 to 1.5 cups mashed), and they were amazing! I ate one for dessert, and the rest of the pancakes are going in the freezer for later as another reviewer suggested. You could easily add blueberries or chocolate chips in place of the bananas if you want to change the flavor. I waited until I mixed the wet/dry ingredients together to add in the mashed bananas. I also didn't beat the wet ingredients (just whisked them together because I was too lazy to get out the mixer and beaters), and I cooked over low/medium heat instead of medium/high ... not sure if it's my electric stove top or the bananas or what, but medium/high nearly burnt the first pancake. Thank you for this recipe! Will definitely be making again!

Yes, this is it. A light and fluffy delicious tasting pancake! These must be eaten fresh, though. The recipe is HUGE, so I had tons of leftovers, so next time I will half it for me and my 2 kids. The leftovers did not taste very good. We added blueberries and also had plain, and they were excellent. No butter or syrup needed!

I had leftover buttermilk in the fridge, and have a family who loves pancakes.  By unamimous vote, these were the best pancakes I've ever made. The batter was amazingly light and fluffy and so were the pancakes.  Melt in your mouth fluffy!  I whipped the eggs before adding them to the milk and used a 1/4 tsp of vanilla.  Caution not to overstir when combining wet to dry and to keep stirring when adding hot butter to wet as not to "scramble" the eggs.   This recipe makes A LOT of batter and 1/2 cup batter pancakes was too much.  It was difficult to get them to cook through in the middle with out getting them too dark.  Next time I will 1/2 the recipe and use 1/3 cup portions.  This is my "go to" pancake recipe now!

I found the best way to make the pancakes extra fluffy!  Fill the sink with hot water right from the tap and set the bowl with the wet mixture in the sink so the hot water warms them up.  Let sit for 15-20 min.  The idea is that the warmer the wet mixture is; the better the reaction with the baking soda and powder.  So warmer then room temperature is good.  We just don't want to cook the eggs and hot tap water is not hot enough for that anyway.  And a teaspoon and a half of vanilla is a god idea too.

These are so easy and so excellent!  They are fluffy, tasty, easy to pour, flip, and stay fluffy.  I followed the recipe, I had made some fruit compote yesterday from leftover blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries, a little water and about 1/4 cup sugar cooked down to a delicious fresh tart and sweet fresh berry topping.  IHOP it's not!  Delicious.

Good recipe. I added vanilla and let the batter sit out overnight per a previous posters recommendation.

This turned out to be an average recipe for me.  I found it to be kind of acidic.  I made a 2/3 recipe, and added bananas and chocolate chips to them.  They were okay, and puffed up, but I would not consider them fluffy. Too much moisture for me.  I agree with another reviewer that a pancake should have a little crunch on the outside and cake-like on the inside.  This wasn't very cake-like.  I just thought it wasn't chemically balanced.  My daughter and husband didn't notice, and scarfed them up.  But I'm a texture-phile with my baked goods, and I thought it was off.

Best pancakes I've ever made.  Husband, who does not generally like pancakes, loved them.  Nephew now asked for them every time he visits and my own kids request them all the time (don't make them as much as they ask!).  They are a little time consuming, but totally worth it.  Recommend making lots and freezing them to microwave later when everyone wants more!

These didn't cook at all. It was like a chewy goo-like pancake that only seemed to cook on the outside. These are very heavy and I followed the recipe precisely. I even saved the batter and tried a few days later to make waffles but to no avail. I don't know what could have went wrong however this isn't my first time making pancakes

OMGsh!  These are the best homemade pancakes I've made so far!  I didn't have regular milk or butter, so I used only buttermilk and substituted canola oil for the melted butter.  Love this batch.  It made about 20 regular-sized pancakes.  Awesome recipe!  This is definitely a keeper.

These are really good! I would give it 4.5 stars if possible. Taste like restaurant pancakes! The buttermilk is a must, it cannot be substituted for milk + Vinegar. The right texture can only be attained from the real thing. Use unsalted butter or cut the salt from the main recipe. And no maple syrup tastes as good as the real thing in my opinion but thats up to you....also would be good with a fruit syrup.Watch them close because they can burn very fast because of the sugar in the batter.

AS IS- Taste was very good but they were very flat and dense instead of being light and fluffy.  I had used up about half the batter and dissatisfied with the results, I added another cup of flour and that made the original recipe perfect!  So I will use the recipe again but with my adjustment.

These pancakes are delicous! I was expecting them to be a bit bigger and fluffier, but they were delicious and worth five stars all the same! I usually just use a pancake box mix for big breakfasts, but this was well-worth trying. I cooked up some bacon, sliced it into 1-inch pieces, coated the pieces and some cheddar cheese with flour, and mixed into this pancake batter. Makes very delicious bacon-cheddar pancakes! But I also made some plain and some with chocolate chip, all super delicious! It made a ton of pancakes, way more than the recipe says, but that was definitely okay with my husband and I, they were so good!
Update: I made these pancakes again for my mom-in-law, and they were huge and fluffy, as promised! My baking powder must have been too old before. Super delicious, give them a try!

Made these for my 32-student co-op this morning. I didn't have buttermilk, but I had buttermilk powder, which I added to regular milk (1 heaping tablespoon per cup) to make extra-strong buttermilk. Worked well - the pancakes were light and fluffy and very popular!

this is a great recipe. Perfect amount of batter to make enough pancakes for my family of seven eaters. Next time will add a bit more baking powder since these didn't seem to be as fluffy as they could be. 
Thanks for the recipe. A million times better than boxed pancakes!

I LOVE this recipe. They come out so good, it's hard to imagine I was the person who could barely make a good pancake from a box pancake mix! Even my mom (who I considered the master of pancakes from the time I was young) commented on how nice and fluffy they were. I half the recipe (and use two eggs instead of the 1 1/2 it works out to be) and still get 8-10 pancakes.

I made the recipe, scaled for 4 pancakes, exactly as written with the exception that I used homemade kefir milk instead of buttermilk (a normal substitute for me, and since it's just soured milk it should not be considered a fundamental change). It came out exactly as advertised - light and fluffy and delicious.  Using the 4-pancake recipe and adding 4 oz of fresh blueberries the batter, I got 8 pancakes, 5" wide and 1/2" or better thick.  I don't understand why some cooks didn't have them rise enough, but I was using fairly new baking soda and that would help I guess.  I could actually see them rise on the griddle as they cooked.  I think the recipe might be even better with a tad of cinnamon, and I might try using spelt flour; but these would be for my own taste and I think the recipe is excellent as it is written.  Thank you for posting it!


         Update:  I made the recipe again with a mod.  Using the recipe scaled to 4 pancake size, you would add 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon to the dry ingredients and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the wet ingredients before mixing them together.  I must say, the extra flavoring took it from excellent to somewhere near outrageous.

Absolutely delicious pancakes! No mess & easy clean up! I made about 27 pancakes from the batter, mine were not that large. I did leave the milks, melted butter & eggs out for at least an hour to get to room temp. I hope they freeze well! :)

I'm new to the cooking world, especially from scratch, so when got the ingredients I bought the wrong baking soda.  The morning I made these pancakes I decided to leave it out, thinking it would not make a difference.  Was I wrong, 100% wrong. The taste was sour and bitter.  So, instead of throwing away the rest of the batter I went and got the baking soda that's intended for cooking.  What a difference 1 1/2 tspns makes.  The only difference I want to change next time I make these awesome pancakes is to scale down the servings.  Thanks for sharing these great tasting pancakes.

This is my go-to recipe when I make pancakes. It is EXCELLENT! the only thing I change is subbing part of the flour for whole-wheat, add some flax, and cut back on butter a little. That's only for my preference though, this recipe is great as-is also. It has a melt-in-your-mouth consistency and tastes wonderful.

Excellent. I added a little bit of vanilla extract and left out the additional 1/2 cup of milk and also had to use vinegar/milk combo as I didn't have enough buttermilk. I also separated out my eggs and whipped up the whites and folded them in at the end. I ended up with about 16 pancakes...light, flavorful and delicious. Definitely a keeper.

The BEST pancakes I have ever tasted.  We made it for dinner and added Reeses Peanut Butter Chips to one, marshmellows to another and chocolate chips and almonds to another and served it with real maple syrup.  Melted in our mouth!!

Very good! I only gave it 4 starts because I add a teaspoon and a pinch more of vanilla extract and cut down on the sugar to about a half tablespoon

I used to make mine from fresh buttermilk. But for two people it's goes bad too quickly. You can buy dried cultured buttermilk made by Saco(has a chef face on front in yellow container). Once opened put in fridge. Has a great recipe on container. You can find by the flour!! So light and fluffy!!!

Very dense and bland. It could definitely use a little more sugar or vanilla. Needs something. Made a huge amount of batter but thats no problem i like to freeze my pancakes for the week's use. Overall not impressed probably wont use again.

Really good recipe!  I am trying to increase the whole grains in my diet, so I substituted half the white flour with a half cup each of cornmeal, whole wheat flour, and oats.  Came out really well!  Great recipe as written

I had buttermilk on hand, so I chose this recipe for pancakes. Wow.....these were awesome! I only made 1/3 of the recipe as it was just myself and my 1 y/o daughter, but we still have leftovers! I've made pancakes from scratch before using the milk-vinegar substitute -- never again. Buttermilk made all the difference in the world. Thanks for sharing!

I have never really liked the big, fluffy pancakes before, but these change everything! They really are light. I made them as the recipe was written, even though there are only two of us. I cooked all of them and I froze the rest, enough for a few more meals. We put fresh raspberries and maple syrup on them, delicious! My new pancake recipe!

Delicious!  I used half all-purpose flour / half whole wheat and they turned out great.  Really good flavor and light and fluffy texture.

I followed the recipe exactly, except scaled down to 2/3. They came out sort of mushy/soggy and not too tasty at all. I prefer a fluffy pancake that is crispy on the outside.

Ummmm . . . can pancakes get any more deliciious??!?!!?  I don't think so!  These are terrific, especially when served hot off the griddle.  These are pure, fluffy yumminess!  I may try adding an additional egg because I love that eggy, spongy, bubbly moist center an egg would add to the pancakes.  :)  This is a great base recipe for including special additions like, blueberries, shredded coconut, pecans & cinnamon or banana.  Oh!  I have made them using 1% and again using full fat buttermilk.  Both were good, but the full fat buttermilk ones were sooooo good!!!

I changed my mind about these.  I tried them in the past but they weren't my favorite.  I recently tried them again and have made them several times since and I love them.  I will stick with this recipe now.  I don't add the additional milk called for in the recipe and the batter is nice and thick then.  Thanks!

Great recipe, my kids loved them. I did add a little ground flax seed in place or some of the flour to add fibre. It didn't change the taste at all. My kids said they were the BEST!

I made 1/3 of the recipe for a small breakfast that served 3 people.  It was easy to reduce.
I used all whole wheat bread flour and a couple tablespoons of whole oats for a nice texture.  I increased fluids and baking powder slightly, and I used oil instead of butter.  This is my new pancake recipe.  I will be trying it in the waffle iron on Saturday!

These were good, but not great.  I've been trying some of the buttermilk pancake recipes on the site and I think these are too much trouble - a few extra unnecessary ingredients and frankly too large of a recipe for me.  Mom's Buttermilk Pancakes were über simple to prepare and very good.

I had buttermilk on hand and had no idea what to make except pancakes! These were good, I was hoping for something a little more flavorful (more like a restaurants) but they were still very good. I followed the recipe exactly except I scales it down to 4 servings. As everyone was saying, the recipe is way bigger than it sounds. Scaled down to 4 I had about 6 which two of them where very large and could have made as two seperate pancakes. I might make this again, but will probably keep searching for a better recipe in the meantime...

These are perfect pancakes. Very light and tender. I put the leftovers in the fridge and 2 days later they were just as good when rewarmed. I added a little more milk to thin them slightly.

I decided to give this one a try even though I have found others my family and I love. This one just did not work for me. The batter made WAY too much, and is too thin for fluffy pancakes. These ones came out flat and not very good. I also took another reviews advise and used the extra batter to try waffles. NEVER again! It poured out of the sides of my waffle maker and made a huge mess.

These were AWESOME! They made way more than 10 pancakes. I think we had a little more than 20 pancakes (they were being inhaled by my husband and 4 kids so I don't have an exact number). I followed the recipe to the T. My daughters said they never want me to use the boxed pancake mix again. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have used the same pancake recipe for years.... until I made these tonight. They are hands down the best pancakes ever. My family loved them. The secret is to not mix the wet in the dry until you are just about ready to cook them.

These pancakes were really awesome! light and fluffy and full of taste. i wasnt sure if there was supposed to be lumps becasue the directions said to not over-mix/stir. i just left the lumpy stuff in there and cooked them and they turned out perfect!

I thought the batter was a little too runny. My first pan came out pretty flat so I added more flour (a bit less than 1/4 cup) and that made them really good - fluffy, light, and tasty :)

These were amazing. Took the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tsp of vanilla, otherwise followed to a T. Superb! Made more like 20 large pancakes rather than 12; and not sure if it was just my stove or skillet but these browned WAY faster than mix pancakes, so I had to reduce my heat considerably.

Really good! Way less dense than the recipe we usually make, much lighter and fluffier. I added some vanilla extract and some pumpkin Pie spice to give them a little bit more flavor. Very Good!

These are my favorite pancakes.  I've made them many times and each time they come out perfectly.  Its best if you follow the recipe exactly, and use fresh buttermilk.  Top them with a little butter, and maybe just a touch of real maple syrup.  Drenching them in anything else wouldn't do it justice!  I've 1/4'd, 1/3'd, 1/2'd and doubled the recipe depending on how many people are eating, and each time they are perfect.  You really can only eat about 2 pancakes per person... they are big and filling!

With this many fabulous reviews, chances are, I didn't do something right...  But my pancakes were just so-so, a little heavy and eggy.  My wet ingredients were room temp and my batter was very lumpy, so I don't know what went wrong.  I may try again later, but I don't know if it's worth the effort, compared to my easy breezy regular recipe.

Good to see others using buttermilk for pancakes. It makes the best! To make this even easier, buy dried buttermilk powder (Saco is what I use) and make pancake mix. When it's time to make pancakes, all you have to do is add egg, oil or butter and water.  So much better than any box mix and as good as bringing home a quart of buttermilk from the grocery store!

I followed the recipe exactly, and these pancakes were just not good.  I usually make the "fluffy pancakes" recipe from this site, and those are 5 star every time.  I had a large carton of buttermilk, so I thought I would give this recipe a try- but it was a disappointment.  The fluffy pancakes recipe is much fluffier, less eggy, and a little sweeter.  I won't make these again.

These were delicious.  Really light and fluffy.  I made them just like the recipe says and they disappeared.  The recipe does make a lot - I made 1/3 of the recipe and it was more than enough for my husband and I.  Now, what to do with all that leftover buttermilk.....

These pancakes were PERFECT! Fluffy, with just the right amount of salt...I didn't even need butter, just syrup! I scaled it down to 4 servings and that made 7 good sized pancakes...I was going to beat egg white seperately to soft peaks, and then add it at the end for extra fluff, but i decided not to, and turns out these pancakes didn't need the extra help =) I added a little vanilla (1 tsp) and a few shakes of cinnamon along with some blueberries (lightly coated in flour so they don't sink to the bottom =) for the second batch and those were fantastic as well. This will definately be my go to pancake recipe!

Despite what the very few negative nancys said, this is the BEST pancake recipe ever.  Perfect blend of salt and sweet, but not over-powering like fiddle-faddle.  The cakes cook up crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  A++++

These pancakes are amazing. I substituted buckwheat flour for half of the flour, that's the only thing I did differently and wow! I made the batter the night before and cooked them the next morning, my daughters loved these pancakes and kept asking for more, these pancakes are light and fluffy even though the batter is thick they spread nicely. If you're looking for the best buttermilk pancakes, look no further!

These turned out better than anything I've ever had at a restaurant. I followed the instructions to the letter and they were perfect. It does make a ton of batter. But, I just put the remainder in some tupperware in the fridge and they still great the next day.

These are wonderful fluffy, not too heavy pancakes.  Perfect recipe for nice standard pancakes!!!  Thanks so much, I love this recipe!!

UPDATE - These are AMAZING, def my go to recipe for pancakes.  I love how light these are, and not dry at all.  The buttermilk definitely plays a huge role in these pancakes being so amazing!!! And yet another update....I ommited the egg and used slightly less flour & made fantastic crepe type thin pancakes, very nice! :)

First, this batter makes WAY too much. Second, the batter doesn't spread easily. Third, and this is my own fault, DO NOT add butter immediately after melting. It cooked my eggs :-\... Anyway, they tasted alright but it was frustrating for me because it didn't spread easily at all. There are better pancake recipes I'm sure. Instead of me trying to fix this one.... I will keep looking.

These are super yummy. They're AWESOME made with buttermilk, still good made with "fake buttermilk" (milk + vinegar or milk + lemon juice). But if you can get the buttermilk, it's definitely better. I usually use half whole wheat flour. I make up "mixes" by measuring the dry ingredients into a ziploc, and write on it the wet ingredients to add. Makes it quicker to make in the mornings (I'm not a morning person so having the "mix" helps me.) UPDATE: I now do 2/3 whole wheat (2 cups ww, 1 cup white). I also add a handful of old fashioned oats (probably 1/3 cup). They're delicious and healthy.

I loved this recipe!  I cut the recipe down because I was only cooking for 2, but I ended up cooking another batch!  They are so good!  I couldn't stop eating them!  You can add chocolate chips and make it even better!

I just made these for breakfast and they are OUTSTANDING!  They only take a few more minutes to put together than boxed pancakes and are 100% better.  I followed the recipe exactly (besides adding chocolate chips to some :).

Lighter than air pancakes that are a little on the thick side, but fantastic nonetheless. I did not have milk so I substituted half and half. I also cut the recipe in half for two of us. I still have two large pancakes left over to be reheated tomorrow. These are so good that they can be eaten with butter alone!! I topped ours with over easy eggs and pure Maple Syrup. These will be my new standard!

These are easy and some of the best pancakes I've had.  The only thing I change was I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup white.  Very tasty!

These pancakes are delicious! Very light and fluffy. I cut the recipe in half and got 16 pancakes (using 1/4 cup batter for each).  My two kids and I ate our fill, and I plan to freeze the rest!  We topped ours with "Buttermilk Syrup", also from this site.  This one is going in the recipe box! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Perfectly light and fluffy pillow-soft pancakes. They were so soft that they tend to wrinkle when I flip them or lift them out of the pan. I made them sweeter by tripling the sugar because my kids eat them dry without syrup.

We received a griddle for our wedding last year and I had never used it until I found this recipe.  This recipe was delicious.  The only thing I changed about this recipe was that I added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Everything else about this recipe is right on.  My hubby said, "these are the best pancakes you've ever made." At first I wasn't sure about doing the original amount but after reading several reviews I decided that since we are on a 4 day weekend it would be nice to have fresh pancakes everyday.  So far we are on day 2 and we still have enough batter for one more day.  Don't worry nothing will happen to it.  I used to work at a restaurant at the "Happiest Place on Earth" and we always refrigerated left over batter.  So far I've made chocolate chip pancakes and blueberry ones to add more bang to them but my hubby prefers them plain.  This recipe is great. I really suggest you try it. Like previous reviewers suggestions I get the griddle at 350 degrees.

UPDATE: I love these pancakes. I'll never go back to any other ones. I've made them on several occasions.

This is super easy and makes the fluffiest pancakes ever.  My husband really enjoyed them.  As he is really a large kid he wanted chocolate chips in the pancakes and they were awsome.

Very good.  Made exactly per recipe and they were light and fluffy.  Next time I will add a little vanilla.  Cut recipe down to one third because I was only feeding two people.  If they come out tough for you, I suspect you are over mixing.  Just stir until the bigger lumps are gone.

Best.  Pancakes.  Ever.  I made them just as written.  Batter was a bit thin, but they rose beautifully on the grill.  They were sweet, tangy, and wheaty.  Even my non-pancake-loving-husband told me they were the best he's ever tasted!

Made these pancakes for a large group that gathered at my house this weekend and they were a big hit!  Followed the recipe exactly like it said to make them.  Originally I thought I would need to triple the recipe based on the serving size listed but ended up having enough for 20+ people with only 2 batches.  I wouldn't change anything :)

I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this because of all the rave reviews. I halved it and there was plenty for my young family of 5. I did as directed and did not stir, and the first batch had balls of flour in them that did not pop! It was also kind of bland, so I stirred it up well and added vanilla for flavoring and it poured much better on the griddle and no balls of flour! I may try again sometime, but nothing to rave about here - bisquick was better.

I've made a few buttermilk receipes from  scratch, and this is by far my favorite!  I've had to cut the receipe down  to 1/3 of the ingredients. Doing so has given me approx. 6 medium sized pancakes -- enough for  two.  I've made it several times already and tweeked it a bit, and played with a few variations.  I added real 1tsp vanilla and 2 tsps of sugar.  I've also substituted vanilla creamer instead of  milk.  I ran out of buttermilk one morning and ended up using lowfat eggnog. Absolutely delicious! The pancakes are very moist and full of flavor.

Followed recipes exactly.  Excellent!  My girls enjoyed these.  I froze the leftover pancakes in a few bags with wax paper between each pancake. They'll make a quick breakfast for us.  Thank you.

At first I thought the batter turned out too thick- but no so.  These things rocked and the recipe feeds an army!  Great texture and flavor.  we added bananas, pecans, and blueberries in different batches for an added twist.  Yum.

I gave it 5 stars despite 2 changes I made.  I used only 1/3 of the recipe as there are only 4 of us in the house, two of whom are 5 or under.  I saw 3 cups of flour and buttermilk and knew that it would be overkill.  The 1/3 of a batch made six ~5" pancakes.  The other change I made was using fresh milled flour.  I used 1/2 cup of hard white wheat, and 1/2 cup of soft white wheat.  It turned out wonderfully.  I'll be adding this to my recipe box for later use.  :)

These were really good. I had some mini-chocolate chips and added them during the cooking. I gave 4 stars because I would have liked them to be a little fluffier. I may have to work with the recipe a little to make that happen.

The world's best pancakes. I employed the method of beating the egg whites and setting them aside and then folding them into the batter at the end. I didn't let the batter rest, and they turned out great.

I had some extra buttermilk I needed to use up, so I thought I'd try this recipe.  The flavor is good, but they are too thin, dense and eggy for our taste.  Judging from the number of rave reviews, I guess a lot of people like their pancakes this way.  We prefer them thick, light and fluffy and usually use the Good Old Fashioned Pancakes recipe from this site.

These came out really well...I followed the recipe except I added a little more liquid to the batter and a splash of vanilla.  I used fresh blueberries for this batch and they tasted great.  I will definitely use this recipe again, and next time I think I will try chocolate chips.

One of the best buttermilk pancake recipes I have tried.  The proportions are wonderful -- the milk in addition helps to thin the batter.  Buttermilk is the key -- you can make these with milk & lemon/vinegar -- but it isn't nearly as good.    Great pancake -- this recipe makes a lot -- so I tend to freeze some for later.

I was astounded by how fluffy and airy these were. I would like to note that if you find yourself with too much batter like I did, you can refrigerate the rest overnight and just add a bit of milk to thin it before cooking. They turn out just fine, though a bit denser the next day. Note: I added about 3/4 tsp. vanilla extract. To some, I added choc. chips, to some I added blueberries, strawberries, and peaches, and some were plain. They were all wonderful!

These are the best pancakes I have ever had! It is imperative to mix the pancakes as minimally as possible to achieve the fluffiest! I am normally not a pancake eater, couldn't wait for the weekend to make 'em again. Left over batter is great for waffles.

Had some buttermilk left over from making Irish soda bread, and I didn't want it to go to waste, so guess what I made for breakfast? Using the omelette pans in the George Foreman grill in place of a good non-stick griddle, which I DON'T have, it cut way back on the calories that oil would've added, and the cakes came out perfect, light and fluffy. Love the fact that there will be leftovers in the freezer for other mornings!

Happy Easter 2013 everyone! This is the second review which will be highly recommended as before! Fluffy & scrumptious. Definitely don't over stir & leave lots of lumps. Easter gift enjoyed with Mom on our sundeck overlooking the ocean with coffee. Hard to believe how warm it is in Vancouver, BC. Thanks again, BURYGOLD. (N.B. Do be careful of too high temperature in frying pan & not too much grease or they darken too much on outside.)

pancakes came out completely flat, eggy, and did not cook well, despite leaving on heat for longer than it should. i dont know if it was because i halved the recipe. but not a good one and i dont think i'll try again.

This is my default pancake recipe now as it makes these wonderfully fluffy, tender pancakes. Between this recipe and Ranch Dressing II I will always keep fresh buttermilk on hand from now on!

PERFECT Pancakes.  I respectfully do not know how anyone could disagree.  I have searched for the pancakes they make at Grand Lux Cafe in Las Vegas - these are the ones!  I got beautifully colored, light, spongey pancakes.  These are no extra effort or time than any other pancake recipe - very easy.  Beware, the recipe makes alot but I kept mine in the fridge for 3 days (making pancakes each day) and my batter kept its integrity just fine.  Excellent recipe - thank you!
*Remember what Alton Brown of Food TV says:  Do not over mix!  Fold batter about 15 times and walk away.  Let it sit a minute (or an hour in the fridge)to let the dry absorb more of the wet.
You will get light, spongey pancakes.
Actual buttermilk is KEY!

My favorite pancakes in the whole world are at Cracker Barrel, and I never could find a recipe that comes close.  That is, until NOW.  Followed the recipe exactly as is--they were absolutely perfect.  I will never buy Bisquick or use any other recipe ever again.  Thanks so very much!

OMG!  These are the best pancakes ever!  I made these today for the first time as I have been wanting to make buttermilk pancakes. Well, I found my recipe. I mixed the milk, buttermilk and eggs and let them come to room temperature first like other reviewers suggested.  The store only had reduced fat buttermilk and I had fat free milk but the taste was still fantastic!  You couldn't even tell I used low fat ingredients.   I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  A little crispy around the edges and soft and fluffy in the middle. It did make more then 12, and mine were about 6" around,  but that didn't matter as they were getting eaten up as soon as they came off the griddle.   I will definitely make these again and again.

Love this recipe!  It was great as is, but I also like to make it a little sweeter with an extra tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla.  The only thing I disagree with is the suggestion to keep the wet and dry ingredients separate.  I mix it up and leave the batter rest for at least 15 minutes; I think they are thicker and fluffier this way.

I have searched high and low for a fabulous pancake - this is it!  My husband said, "you can stop searching - this is the best!" Update:  4/12/09...I forgot I had reviewed these and today again my husband said they were delicious.  I topped them with sliced bananas and toasted sliced almonds, butter and real maple syrup.  These are also a lot easier than beating egg whites separately and folding them in to the batter like many other buttermilk pancake recipes.  Try this; you will not be disappointed!  Michelle

UPDATE: You can also make cornmeal pancakes with these, by subbing 3/4 of the flour out for cornmeal. 4/21/2008:I have tried many different pancake recipes and haven't been able to replicate the pancakes you get from restraunts until I tried this one.  This recipe produces the most beautiful, fluffy pancakese ever!  I used KLUGLE's suggestion of letting my liquids get to room temp and when I mixed I made sure to "just incorporate" the ingredients.  I did add a little vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the mix, but that's just a personal preference.  I will never go to another pancake recipe again!

This recipe has changed how I feel about pancakes! I replaced 2 cups of the AP flour with 2 cups of whole spelt and the remaining cup for 1 Cup of Quinoa (pronounced keen-wah) flour (organic Bob's Red Mill). It's amazing what an earthy nutty flavor the quinoa adds, and still remains light and fluffy, not to mention very healthy. I have had it both ways and feel the spelt and quinoa is better than AP. I also used someone's tip for letting the milk and eggs come to room temp to help keep things fluffy. Though usually I find it just takes too long for the milk to hit room temp which in turn makes the melted butter flake up and not distribute properly in the whole batter. To combat this I have begun to take my melted butter and slowly beat it into my eggs before adding to the milks. The liquid fats of the yolks join to the butter fats and keep them from flaking up when added to the cooler milks. This should take you around 1 minute to do, at a slow pour, constantly beating the egg so it doesn't scramble. Cook these no higher than 300 degrees F, otherwise the insides don't get done in time for the outsides. And don't over-stir! Leave lumps in the batter, they will cook out just fine.

these are amazing!! i made them for Pancake Tuesday at work and everyone LOVED them.  I didn't have time for the ingredients to get to room temperature and i really don't think it mattered.  I really do think the key to this recipe is not blending the ingredients to smooth, even tho it doesn't look appetizing in the bowl the pancakes turn out FANTASTIC!  I made a batch with egg replacer for one of the girls and they turned out great too!

I will forever be plagued with making these dang pancakes!  My boyfriend loves them, and whines for me to make them constantly!  We've tried whole wheat flour and blueberry variations, and they turn out just as well.  I always omit the added sugar and REAL maple syrup is a must!!  **UPDATED** I'm on about batch 100 of these pancakes and I thought I'd add to my review.  When making these, sometimes we use half whole wheat and half white flour.  We cook in a cast iron skillet on medium to medium-low heat (don't have your heat too high!) and add a thin layer of vegetable oil before each batch.  When the topside of the pancake becomes dull and forms air-bubbles, that's when you flip them.  If your pancake is too dark when this happens, turn down your heat.  We freeze leftovers in packs of four (they break apart easily, so no need to separate with anything), and pop them in the toaster in the mornings before school.  This recipe is now our 'always' pancake recipe.  Enjoy!

With the high rating, I had to try this pancake. I halved the recipe and it made nine 6" pancakes. If you have an electric griddle, try 275 - that is where mine cooked the best.The pancakes were very good - not perfect, but very good according to my taste. I think this is a four and a half stars recipe.

I thought this was an excellent pancake recipe! I followed others' advice by letting my buttermilk/milk sit out for a little while before adding the eggs and mixing it with the dry ingredients, and the pancakes were very fluffy and delicious. I also added a splash of vanilla and substitued 1/4 c. wheat germ for about 1/4 c of flour. I found the batter to be a bit thick, but just added some more milk to thin a bit (may be because of my wheat germ), and be warned that this makes at least a dozen huge pancakes--it fed 3 adults and 2 toddlers with less than half the batter. But hey, I just put the batter in the fridge and we'll have more pancakes tomorrow! YUMMMY!

The absolute best pancakes I've ever made.  The texture was exactly what I was looking for, almost yeasty.  They were so light and fluffy, even my husband commented that they were the best pancakes he'd ever tasted!  I did add about 1 tbls of pure vanilla as others suggested but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I used a rubber spatula to stir in the wet ingredients and it worked perfectly as I could easily scrape down the sides of the large bowl while mixing.  I too was surprised at how the lumpy batter turned out the smoothest, lightest pancakes ever!  Be sure to use all the ingredients as listed, no substitutions.  It makes LOTS of pancakes so I freeze the left overs and microwave for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes for 3 pancakes.

This recipe was very good. I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk and added vanilla extract and chocolate chips for the kids. The batter was way to thick so I added a bit more milk than the recipe called for. Everyone loved this fluffy, airy pancake. Makes a lot of cakes, we had  leftovers. This will be my default pancake for the weekends!

My batter turned out a little thick, so I thinned it, and I wish I had thinned it more---these were too thick to be called pancakes!  Still...they were fluffy and delicious.  I added a little vanilla to it, too.

okay...these pancakes were incredible tasting!  They really were good...but just a few comments
1. the batter was way thick (not at all runny even by following the recipe exactly). I actually needed to add more milk!
2.) one reader suggested that you freeze the extras for toaster pancakes another day.  The problem is these pancakes rise quite a bit so putting the pancakes in the toaster will toast the outside (which will smell and taste great) but the center of the pancake will be rock hard as it is still frozen.  
Definitely half this recipe or cook when you have lots of people over.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been using this recipe for months now - I will no longer be buying Bisquick!  I usually halve the recipe and I make my own buttermilk by adding  1 T. cider vinegar per 1 c. milk (do this first thing to let it set for about 5 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients).  I also always sift the dry ingredients.  To make blueberry pancakes, I do not add the blueberries to the batter (or it turns everything purple)- instead I pour the batter onto the griddle and then I drop the [still frozen] blueberries onto the pancake itself.  I get the mini, organic blueberries from Trader Joe's.  It takes a touch longer when adding the blueberries as they're still frozen but it's quite delicious.  We serve the blueberry pancakes with whipped cream and the regular ones with real maple syrup.  Not only do my husband and I love these pancakes, my 10 month old son cannot get enough!  (And of course the baby gets his sans topping!)

Excellent, some of the best pancakes ever, and they still tasted excellent even though I exchanged the white flour for healthier flours... whole wheat pastry, oat and a tablespoon of ground flax.

I halved this recipe, but used 2 eggs instead of the 1-1/2 called for.  I also added a little vanilla extract.  I used about 1-3/4 cups of sour milk, and no extra milk.  I used only 1/2 tsp baking soda.  I have to admit this was a very fluffy pancake, and the taste was very good.

These were delicious pancakes! Hubby scaled the recipe down to 8 servings & he used Saco powdered buttermilk blend. He just added it w/ the dry ingredients & then added 2 cups of water when he added the milk. He also added frozen blueberries & a little extra sugar. We froze the lefovers in a single layer on a cookie sheet & then popped them a in baggie.

A completely superior recipe.  The pancakes were very fluffy, and the recipe even tolerated the addition of bananas and chocolate chips for my son (in a 1/2 cup portion).  Mrs. Can Cook added a teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe (we like that flavor in pancakes) and the results were nothing short of spectacular.  They were easy to manage on the griddle, cooked uniformly, and it was far to easy to eat too many. ;)

These pancakes are great, and they freeze well, too.  After baking a big batch, I store them in ziploc bags (3 or 4 to a bag) and throw them in a freezer.  Then I just pull one bag to warm up for my breakfast :)

I used half the mixture to make regular pancakes, which turned out PERFECT, and the other half to make WAFFLES, which my family liked even better, so this is going to be my recipe for buttermilk waffles!! :-) thanks!

Our family loves these pancakes.  I haven't used a mix since trying this recipe. They are nice and fluffy. I do sometimes add a little vanilla. I once tried using the powered buttermilk instead of fresh and was disappointed with the result.  I do have a tip:  The melted butter will not resolidify if you mix it with the egg yolks.  I just separate the eggs, and pour the melted butter into the yolks and whisk.  No more butter lumps in the batter.

definitely a keeper! these made the biggest, fluffiest, tastiest pancakes I've ever had. I made mine 8 inches across and they still turned out great. the buttermilk really makes it special. and fyi, the intro to this recipe says "fresh buttermilk" but you don't need to go out and buy some if you usually don't. just add a tablespoon of lemon juice to a cup of milk, let it sit until it gets lumpy. voila.

These are incredible. My 10 yr old daughter got a terrible craving for pancakes and wanted to make some on her own. I showed her this website and we looked for a good recipe together. I even ran out to the grocery that morning for the buttermilk!  She made them all by herself and reveled in the praise of her older sisters who declared them better than any they'd ever had in a restaurant. She is as anxious to make them again as we are to eat them!!

Flavorful pancakes with great consistency if you like thick fluffy pancakes.  I don't care for spongy rubbery pancakes.  I added pumpkin spice for the nutmeg/cinnamon/allspice kick!  It was fast too, so this is my new base pancake mix!

This taste of these are great. The only problem I encountered was my own (lack of) pancake making skills. It is very important to make sure that all ingredients are at room temperature, this includes the melted butter and the milk. I made the mistake of combining too soon and cooked my egg mixture, producing lumps! This recipe makes a TON of pancakes!

These were awesome! I used 1/4 cup batter for each pancake to make them stretch a little more and it was perfect! I used low fat buttermilk and I can't believe it's not butter light to lessen the fat a tad bit.Added some banana's as well!  This is my new pancake recipe!

These are the best pancakes I have ever eaten! I am so surprised that I made something this good! I followed suggestion from allreceipes.com about making pancakes, and I did not stack them on top of each other like I used to. They came out so tall and fluffy! I did add just a drop of vanilla, but that is just my preference. I do have one hint: use a measuring table spoon, and dip out 2 tablespoons, they will come out the perfect size!!! Enjoy!!

These were ok...nothing special...to clarify, I halved the recipe (1.5 eggs by beating and measuring) and I used "fake" buttermilk - 1 tablespoon vinegar for each cup of milk, and let it sit for 10 minutes.  So that may have messed it up.  There was nothing WRONG with these, they were just pretty boring and not any better than what my biscuit mix can whip up.    The Honey Syrup recipe from this site saved these.

I cannot get this recipe to work for me at all. The only reason I can think of is that I'm in London using their ingredients and also cooking on an electric stove. I have not overstirred and my ingredients are fresh but they still turn out flat with the batter never cooking all the way through. I've adjusted the burner from medium all the way down to the lowest setting and it still won't cook up right.

I'll try this recipe again when I get back home to the US and see if I have better results. I should, given the great reviews!

We tried this on Christmas morning and ended up using Bisquick since these did not live up to all the raves.  I was very disappointed in this recipe.  There was not alot of taste, it was doughy tasting and very flat even with more flour and baking powder.

Let me just give this one word of advice...don't be deceived by the simple ingredients in this recipe!  I've been looking all over for "THE PERFECT" pancake recipe, and I was sure that there must be some sort of secret ingredient that would make them as delectable as these.  But I guess not; this is honestly the most delicious one I have ever found, and it will always be my go-to recipe.  Thank you so much!!! : )

Soooo delicious!  These are great pancakes with a good buttermilk taste.  They are easy to make, too.  I served them with strawberries and whipped cream for a treat, along with sausage, and my husband loved them.  Mmmmmmm!

This recipe had good flavor but produced a very thick batter therefore a dense pancake.  I would consider adding more milk the next time I make them.

Absolutely fabulous pancakes.  They take a while to cook so that the center is not still runny.  I used a bit more milk and had to watch the temperature of my griddle rather carefully.  I think I will make a huge batch of the dry ingredients so I can have it on hand ready to make in a hurry.

This is my Grandma Grace's Recipe. I love these pancakes!!! I use: alittle less sugar; vegetable oil instead of the melted butter (but I'll try the butter next time); and I completely omit the milk... Grandma only used buttermilk. Serve with warmed maple syrup. YUM!

I have made these twice.  First time I used powdered buttermilk having read on some reviews that they turned out good. I was disappointed with that outcome, the taste was really good but they were, well, flat as a pancake, not at all fluffy. This morning I made them with real buttermilk and they were perfect!  Light, fluffy, delicate.  YUM! Bisquick?  What's that?

I make these pancakes almost every weekend.  I always make a third of the original recipe, because the  number of pancakes (6-8 depending on size) is perfect for our little family.  These are the best pancakes ever.  I have even made them with whole wheat flour.  The texture is more grainy, but my husband says he likes them more than the regular kind.

This was my first attempt at making pancakes from scratch...we loved them.  I have played with the recipe a little by adding a little vanilla and sometimes a little cinnamon.  I did beat the egg whites before adding them to the rest of the wet ingredients...they were very light and fluffy!!

This is the BEST recipe I've tried so far! I've tried several other "five star" recipes from this site but this is by far, the yummiest and the BEST!  unlike other pancakes that came out wet and battery, these were fluffy, golden, and DELICIOUS!  i definitely recommend them. it wuz however kind of hard to flip them, and then batter got slopped around but in the end, it all came down to a GREAT taste.  these aren't the picture perfect pancakes but they have the mouth-watering perfect taste!

The best pancake recipe yet.  For an even lighter pancake, separate the eggs and beat the whites until stiff, then fold into the final mixture just before cooking.  Mary Ann

Excellent recipe. I modified it a bit though by cutting all dry ingredients in half, adding 500ml buttermilk and 2 large eggs.  A light fluffy pancake resulted and we had enough left over to freeze for "quick" breakfasts.

Very light and fluffy. I let the batter sit for 10-20 minutes after mixing it up. A third of this recipe makes about 12 pancakes

Always great and yes makes a TON! Serves our family of 4 at least twice which is great, freeze em flat and put in freezer bags, reheat in toaster oven for weekday mornings. Add about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and toddlers go crazy for them!

As a mom of 4, I love this recipe just as it is. It probably makes 30 or so 4-inch pancakes. I lay them on pans and freeze them individually, then put them in a freezer bag to pull out anytime as a quick meal. Just reheat about 30 seconds in the microwave and they still taste great!

Yes, I cut this recipe by two thirds, otherwise this recipe would make enough pancakes to feed my whole neighborhood.  I've used these same ingredients for years and have made few alterations except sometimes I add some vanilla flavoring.  This recipe makes wonderful light pancakes, buttermilk seems to make a vast difference.  If you don't sit the mixed batter aside for a few minutes and let the baking powder do it's thing, your pancakes will not be light and fluffy.

Best pancakes!  My husband is not a pancake kind of guy. In fact, he's not a breakfast guy, except for bacon. The world is right if there's bacon. So, I made these for me and the kiddos. He tasted one of theirs and couldn't stop raving. I made them exactly according to the recipe with just two minor changes. I used all buttermilk, no plain milk, and I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract. That's it, and I'm sure that didn't put them over the top. I cannot over emphasize the part about overstirring.  Stir the dry ingredients well, but then basically just ensure the dry ingredients get wet with the well-mixed egg mixture.  You'll get thick and fluffy mouth watering pancakes, ones that even a bacon-for-breakfast guy wants to eat.

Please, I beg of you, ignore the negative comments on this post! These are some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The only thing I did different was add a splash of vanilla and topped with blueberry sauce and whipped cream. Make it exactly as the directions specify. Have your ingredients room temperature and make sure not to over mix. I cooked the batter on my griddle which I greased down with shortning. I was able to make 28 pancakes. Delicious!!

Awesome pancakes!  I've done this with true buttermilk and "homemade buttermilk", i.e. sour milk (1 tbsp cider vinegar per 1 cup milk) and both ways turn out great.  Obviously better with true buttermilk but works in a pinch.  I also tried adding a bit of fresh ground nutmeg and that was amazing, too.  Quite simply, you can't go wrong with these pancakes.  Just don't over stir!

Lots of pancakes.  For a family of three it's enough for two meals, so we put in the Refrigerator and made it again the next day.  Just be careful to make sure the thickness of the batter is the same both days.  I added about two ounces of water on day 2.

This is one of the better buttermilk Pancake recipes i have made, they take a little longer to cook but worth it. The recipe makes a lot, i usually freeze leftover pancakes or turn them into peanut butter sandwiches later in the day. They were good with blueberries.

I only made 1/3 of the recipe, but they were perfect, light, tender, fluffy, melt in your mouth.  I added a touch of vanilla and cinnamon, not enough to be noticeable, but maybe added depth.  Couldn't possibly be better!

These were the best buttermilk pancakes we have ever had. They were fluffy and buttery tasting. I notice some reviewers claimed these werent fluffy, they need to check their baking powder which loses effectiveness over time because this recipe ended up making way more than the 12 that it claimed, more like twice that because the batter kept expanding. (I consider this a good thing!)

Batter was not pourable for me. I've never had that happen ever for pancakes. The batter was tasty but I didn't even bother putting them in the skillet because it has the consistency of biscuit mix which means doesn't spread out when dropped. Tried adding more liquid and it was just getting ridiculous trying to get it to a pourable state. I didn't change proportions until after I saw that the batter was more like dough. Never had this much trouble with a recipe :(

Great pancakes - I will use this recipe from now on instead of a packaged mix…by the time you add eggs, milk and oil, you might as well make these from scratch. My husband liked them very much and said they had a creamy taste. Just one comment on the yield - I cut this recipe in half for the two of us, and it still made three times what we needed. A full recipe would be a LOT of pancakes.

The batter is a little plain, but these are great if you fold in some blueberries and serve with real maple syrup.  (Please always use real maple syrup!).

These pancakes are not easy to make, but they are SO good! Since I was only making breakfast for three people I cut the recipe in half. There was enough for 3 pancakes per person with 2 left over!

Best I've ever made!!  I made these for 3 little girls, so I cut the recipe down to 1/3 but didn't change a thing other than that. 1/3 of the recipe made 11 or 12 pancakes.  I can't wait to make the full recipe for my 4 teenage boys. They will eat that many and probably still want more. Thanks!!!

I am always on the hunt for a great pancake recipe. So far this is the best I've tried. Mine were not runny at all. I used real buttermilk as the recipe called for and just added a splash of vanilla.  Made the full recipe and ended up with 26 4 inch pancakes.

After reading some of the other reviews that said the batter was too thick and salty, I used low fat buttermilk and unsalted butter. They turned out great. 
FYI: this made 8 cups of batter so plan on being in front of the stove for a bit if you don't have a griddle pan.

THESE are by FAR the BEST pancakes.  I will be keeping this recipes and making them AGAIN, and AGAIN.

If you have never made pancakes from scratch, it's easy.  Give this recipe a try, you will make them again.

1/2016 UPDATE
Made these again today and this time, dropped frozen blueberries into the top of them just after putting them onto the griddle.  AWESOME!

was very excited until i combined the wet and dry ingredients and found the batter sooooo thick, it would have been difficult to flip the pancakes. i had to add maybe in total a half cup more milk and i think it ruined the recipe. if i get a chance to make this again, i think i'd change the wet to dry proportions. pretty yummy! eat if you like suppperr thick pancakes

I was craving buttermilk pancakes and had some leftover buttermilk from making cornbread, and so I tried this recipe. The pancakes were perfect. I wouldn't change a thing!! My new go-to recipe for the pancakes that I remember as a kid.

I followed this recipe to the LETTER. AMAZING. So good, fluffy, yum, yum, yum. I even attempted to save the batter and make them the next day, they may even have been better. I don't know. Just sayin', these things are dang tasty.

Delicious! Had some buttermilk I had to use up, so although there are only two of us in the household I made the recipe and am glad I did. No changes, as is, they were as stated, light & fluffy and very good. I estimate it makes about two dozen pancakes. We'll freeze the excess for later!

These are the best pancakes ever! They beat out Cracker Barrel's by a long shot, according to my husband, and that says a lot!

This has been my go to recipe for a few years now.  It's delicious, the kids love it.  I always whip up a few batches and freeze what's left from breakfast so the kids can have pancakes from the toaster on school mornings if they want.  My mother in law asked me for this recipe!

absolutely a great dish and a treat to add to those pancakes is a ½
tsp. vanilla extract and orange zest to the mix and a dusting of powdered sugar. with a cherry on top if desired.
I helped my ma' 50 some years ago making pancakes, flap-jacks etc;
this is an original recipe frittella in Italian. :)

I LOVE pancakes and this is the best recipe I have found to make that fluffy yummy pancake at home.  We take the buttermilk out in advance and let it warm to room temperature before starting.  Also, really, DON'T over mix the batter.  Lumpy with pockets of dry mix is a good thing.  Trust the pancake!

Awesome! The pancakes came out nice and fluffy. The trick is to not over mix it the dough. Before cooking, I added some fresh squeezed lemon juice and vanilla to the batter. Then added some blueberries! My husband and I loved them!  
I will say that this recipe does make a lot of pancakes and if cooking for two I would recommend to cut recipe in half.

I have forever changed my opinion of scratch vs convenience. My family LOVED this recipe. It has just the right amount of fluffiness and a slight crunch on the outsides.  The flavor was perfect. Not too sweet, not dry at all, not too buttery.  You do need to eat them right away though.   You lose some of the value when you lose the crunch.  Awesome recipe!  Thanks so much!  Btw, goes great with the homemade blueberry syrup I made too!

This is my new go-to recipe for pancakes. They turned out great and looked awesome (mine never looked picture perfect before). I halved the recipe and it made plenty for 2 adults and 2 small children.

This is the first time I've ever rated a recipe on this site but I tried these buttermilk pancakes and they're so good I had tell everyone. I've been making homemade pancakes from scratch for 40 yrs. and these are far and away the best I've ever eaten. Hubby said, they actually melt in your mouth. I paired them with Mom's homemade buttermilk syrup also on this site and the syrup made these pancakes even better if that's possible. Thanks for the recipe for these fluffy, melt in your mouth pancakes. I'd give them 10 stars if I could.

MILE HIGH CAKES!! To die for. Restaurant quality. This recipe will be kept for a lifetime. Never made a better buttermilk pancake until now. Family raved. I could taste the eggs in the cakes, but it wasn't "eggie." Have plenty of syrup on hand. They are tall, moist, and fantastic. Give it a try...!

I tried this recipe in order to use up my buttermilk. I liked it, but found it a little too doughy for my preferences. I'll stick with my preferred recipe, but would use this one again in the event I again have buttermilk that needs to be used.

My husband likes a pancake breakfast every Sunday. I usually just make the box mix type for him. We have tried two different brands. This Sunday I just happened to be out of mix so I googled pancake recipes and found this one. It is easy to make and makes a ton of batter. I asked my husband what he thought and he told me to never make the box mix type again! He said they were nice and fluffy and you just could not compare to the flavor. I am not big on pancakes but WOW! I have to say this is one of the best tasting pancake recipes I have tasted! This will be my go to every Sunday!

Very good!
I used all buttermilk and canola oil. 
I also made the entire recipe to freeze most of these so we can have pancakes during the week.  I hope they freeze well.
I also only made mine 1/4 cup size as the 1/2 cup would be as big as my head

Light, fluffy, and delicious! This recipe is perfect as-is - although I have just been increasing the buttermilk to compensate for the milk.

I have used this recipe more than once and I even managed to forget to add the butter once and I still had amazing pancakes. These pancakes are loaded with flavor, hold a chocolate chip well and have become the family favorite.  So tasty.  I also add a touch of vanilla for an extra flavor boost,  but honestly, the recipe is great as is.

Made them multiple times for the men at our church's men's breakfast and because the recipe makes so many I've been known to knock on a neighbor's door to deliver some "hot-cakes" yummy!

Have to thank whomever came up with such a great combination of ingredients. I enjoy tweaking recipes, however...,  didn't really feel it was absolutely necessary as some here did.   Sometimes having a recipe that one can share with family and friends that does not need to be diluted with, "You could do this, or this, or, or, or..."   Not being hyper-critical or unappreciative of those that posted hints, tips, suggestions, just think as far as recipes go this is great as is (sure dissappear fast enough) . Thank you again.

Make sure your pan is hot or these pancakes will turn out like crapes. They taste great but the texture is all wrong. I like my pancake nice and thick and fluffy. Bummer

Great taste, and easy. I did not add the 1/2 cup milk, and it was just the right thickness for our taste. If you like runnier batter, add the milk.

This recipe is excellent! Pancakes are even better than the ones in the restaurant. I have done this with white flour but today I decided to use whole wheat flour instead. Delicious!!! I didn't adjust the measurement at all. Just add 3/4 if WW and 1/4 white flour. I add a pinch of ginger minced I recommend it !!!

This recipe passed my daughters high standards for pancakes and even my pancake-hating wife liked them very much!  One secret weapon that I have for pancakes is a 60 year old Westinghouse electric griddle that is on its third generation, it never screws up, pancake after pancake are uniformly perfect.  To think that I almost turned my nose up at it when my mother offered it to me.

I made 2/3 batch using low fat buttermilk and 0% milk.  These pancakes came out great in terms of both flavor and texture.  I suspect that "do not over mix" is a key instruction for this recipe.  Heaping 1/4 cup scoops made nice sized pancakes, and 2/3 of the recipe made a dozen pancakes.  Very filling pancakes, we were each full after having two.

I really wasn't impressed with the recipe. My pancakes were flat, not fluffy and the flavour wasn't what I like.
I wouldn't make them again.

Tried these for the first time today. I have a hard time making pancakes and keeping them fluffy. This recipe SAVED me! So easy to do; even if you don't have buttermilk and need to do the cup of milk with table spoon of white vinegar trick, they turn out incredible! My husband gave it two thumbs up. We will definitely be making these again!

I have made these for my family and they are great.  I used self rising flour instead of all purpose. When using self rising do not use salt, baking soda and baking powder.

I made these pancakes but changed them up for my daughter.  I used half oat flour for the called-out flour.  I also used almond milk as well as cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and 3 smashed-up bananas - and reduced the sugar in half as the bananas are sweet on their own.  My family likes the revised version.

These pancakes are so fluffy! I let the cold ingredients come to room temp before mixing and the only thing I changed was that I added 1 tsp of vanilla. It makes a ton of pancakes, but I like to freeze the leftovers for a quick warm weekday breakfast. Thanks so much!!

Fantastic! Best pancake recipe I've used, and I've been experimenting for years. I varied from the directions an mixed them too early (~20 minutes), but it hasn't seemed to affect the cakes too much.

Delicious!  I had some leftover buttermilk so I decided to try these. They came out very light and fluffy - no changes!   I've tried other recipes in the past but none that I ever wanted to make again.  This recipe is one of the best pancake recipes I've ever tasted.  My picky son even loved them.

Very good recipe! Followed recipe exact. Pancakes were light and fluffy. I thought they would need extra time to cook because of how thick they get, but no different then any other. Serving wise, made 18 good size pancakes with plenty left over to freeze. Will definitely make again!

Pretty good! These took longer in the pan to heat up than I expected-- the first batch I made were a little gooey from uncooked batter. I added frozen blueberries for extra sweetness which worked out! I wanted to make buttermilk pancakes especially because I had extra from the cake I made last week.

Everyone loved this recipe.  My husband (53yo) gave the highest compliment (which he doesn't give easily), that these were the best pancakes he's ever had.  I don't think I've ever heard him say this about anything.  I will say that I used White Lily self-rising flour and omitted the baking powder and salt.  If you're in the south and it is available to you, White Lily makes a huge difference with baked goods.  Not sure how it is, but there really is a difference.  America's Test Kitchens seems to think so, too, which convinced me.  Oh, and you must use buttermilk.  Regular milk will make it too watery.  If you don't have buttermilk, make a different recipe.

This was okay. The recipe was very watery, I had to add 3 cups of extra flour!! Won't make again. This made enough pancakes to last all weekend.

This was an amazing recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  The pancakes were light and fluffy with an incredible amount of flavor.  I've never made buttermilk pancakes before but I can guarantee I will again.  The best part is that it was two adults, and one very picky autistic child.  There are plenty left over for me to freeze for morning breakfasts for work.  I could cook these for a crowd!  I paired this with the Simple Strawberry Syrup from the sight as well and Mr. Picky who doesn't like to get his fingers sticky, pushed away the fork because it was taking too long to get the pancakes in his mouth!  It may sound melodramatic, but this is the best flavored pancake I've ever eaten.  I could eat them without syrup!

I just finished eating some of these delicious fluffy pancakes, and followed the recipe as is- they were perfect, and made exactly 12 (restaurant size) golden pancakes.  I wouldn't change a thing!  ..... Except scale down since there was only 2 of us.... ;)

This was just ok for me - the batter was really wet, so it took a long time to cook, which was inconvenient, and the taste wasn't good enough to make up for that.

I liked the flavor of the original recipe; however, the batter was too thin. The second time I made it, I eliminated the milk, which resulted in fluffy, thick pancakes that tastes great.

These were great! They are very thick and fluffy. Using all whole wheat flour worked great. I also used Saco powdered buttermilk and that was fine. Subbing olive oil for the butter does not work well, however.

I really like these pancakes! I modified the recipe just a tad: I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and was generous with the sugar (my 3 tablespoons were probably more like 4). Other than that I made the recipe as is, with the amounts called for. It made about 14 pancakes. I had 7 left over, so I froze them with a piece of parchment paper in between the individual pancakes, and they were great microwaved. This will be my go-to pancake recipe from now on. Soooo much better than boxed pancake mix!

I liked the pancakes but I wish the recipe had noted that you only need to use all that salt if you are using unsalted butter! I forgot all about that little rule and my pancakes were SO salty. Blech, salty pancakes!!

These were a hit!  Made them today. I didn't have buttermilk so I just substituted with this (3 cups of milk and 3 tablespoons of vinegar. I let it flair for 10 minutes or so, or until it formed clumps). Also, I added vanilla!  They were delicious!  Sticking to this recipe from now on.

I thought these were soooo goood.  I used all these ingredients except instead of three cups of flour, I replaced one of of the cups with organic spelt flour, used only one organic cage free egg instead of three regular, used only three cups of fat free milk with some vinegar, added some blue berries at the end and mama mia, you talk about feeling healthy and blue berries were piping hot. Just makes me feel a little healthier if I add some healthy stuff.

Super easy and quick to make. I followed the recipe exactly (made my own buttermilk by mixing milk with lemon juice) and they were so delicous and fluffy. Can't wait to make this recipe again..maybe with blueberries! I definitely recommend others to try this recipe as well, you won't be disappointed! I cut the recipe in half because it seemed like too much, and I ended up with 8 large pancakes (two per person -- perfect). Enjoy!!

Ugh. I followed this recipe to the "T" and the results were bad. I only made 2/3 of a recipe but the batter was almost as thick as dough. I also think I added the melted butter when it was still too warm because the buttermilk/egg mixture suddenly had lumps (cooked eggs maybe?). The center of the pancakes would NOT cook regardless of how long I left it on the pan. What a waste of ingredients.

These were fabulous! I followed the directions exactly except for adding 1 tsp. vanilla with the liquid ingredients. The pancakes were fluffy and beautiful, with an excellent flavor. I fed a hungry family of six (including 2 teenage boys) with one batch. We sprinkled blueberries on some (right after pouring the batter on the griddle), and chocolate chips on others, and left the rest plain. All turned out exceptional. Thanks so much for this recipe!

My husband is the pancake maker in our house, and he's tried a lot of different recipes, trying to find the perfect pancake.  All were just okay, then he found this recipe.  Seriously, the best pancakes I've ever eaten in my life, and all of our children agreed.  So. Good. He didn't change a think.  Make sure you look at the amount serving though. I didn't do that and doubled it. I had enough pancakes for a week.

By far the best recipe for buttermilk pancakes ever! This is my ONLY go to recipe for pancakes. They always turn out light and fluffy! I usually make a double batch so my family can have them for several days for breakfast. Now that is a lot of pancakes! You won't be disappointed - but then again, you'll never go out for pancakes again - when you can make the BEST ONES AT HOME! YUM! Thank you BURYGOLD!

I just wanted pancakes!  I had no idea that these would end up being the best pancakes my family and I have ever had!!  We followed the recipe, added a dash of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla.  They were soooo amazing!  It was hard to not eat them while cooking them!

My 6 year-old grandson insisted I come back here and give this 5 stars. We both loved them. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour (I think it was the lighter color variety) and 1 cup regular flour. They were still nice and fluffy. He ate most of three rather large pancakes. They were sweet, with great flavor and very filling. The batter is rather thick, but i think that helps make a nice thick pancake. I now have a nice stack for a quick breakfast before church tomorrow.

Good recipe in that it was better than a box mix and very easy to prepare.  My husband's first comment was "eggy".  I didn't get the buttermilk flavor I was hoping for.  I would make again, but would prefer to keep looking for something that wows me.  I followed the recipe precisely with no changes.  This recipe easily made double, if not triple, what my husband, myself, and 12 year old son could eat.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I use this recipe for pancakes and belgian waffles; my kids ask for these pancakes every single day.  If I have the time, I let the buttermilk, eggs and milk sit out for 1/2 hour or more to get to room temp.  I also try to melt the butter at least 15 minutes before I need it, or use ghee, to avoid having the butter solidify in the liquids and/or cook the eggs.  The recipe definitely makes a huge amount.  If I want just enough for one brunch, I make a third of the recipe.  It is definitely best right after combining the wet/dry ingredients, but does sit well and I often make an entire recipe on Sunday and use it throughout the week.  Waffles I've made with this batter also freeze and reheat really well in the toaster.

Excellent! Found the go-to pancake I've been searching for. Wonderful texture and super fluffy. I always follow Alton Browns directions on mixing the wet with the dry; don't over mix,put the spoon down and walk away..let the batter sit for maybe 5 minutes to allow the baking soda to react with the buttermilk.

These are the most amazing pancakes ever. Have your favorite syrup available...they are like a fluffy sponge. Sooooo good! I must also give credit to learning the technique of wetting the dry ingredients just enough rather than mixing them endlessly...lumpy is good! I do this with my waffles and they too are amazingly better.

Extremely good.  But, be sure that you know it makes a pretty large quantity of batter.  I made something like 20 1/4 cup (5-inch) pancakes not the 5 that the recipe states.

I just made these for our Thanksgiving Breakfast. They are delicious! Even my husband, who is not a huge breakfast fan, loved these. I did add an extra tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. This is the best pancake recipe I have made. They were easy to make too. Just remember to not over mix the batter ~ the lumps mean light and fluffy pancakes. This batter will make an abundance of pancakes. I think it is safe to say you could easily feed eight people with this recipe.

Wonderful recipe worthy of 5 star review! I did cut it in half, but did not alter at all. My husband likes to make another buttermilk pancake recipe from this site, but this was the first time trying these. My kids loved these and declared them the winner!

These were the best pancakes I have ever made. And I've made a lot. So fluffy and light. I let the eggs and milk mixture sit out till room temperature which helped with the fluffiness. You won't be disappointed!

When made with buttermilk, they were fluffy but not sweet enough.  When made with milk and vinegar, they were flat and bland.

These were so fluffy!!!! I didn't have any buttermilk on hand and I was hungry, my wife had taken the car to work and since we only have one car I couldn't go buy buttermilk.  Luckily, I had some cold breast milk my wife had pumped for our daughter so I used that in place of the buttermilk and they turned out great!  At first my wife was mad that I used her milk in pancakes instead of giving it to our daughter but I let her taste how delicious and fluffy they were and she soon forgot all about it!  Plus I reminded her that she makes so much that we still have 1 month supply in the freezer and she agreed that I made the right call!

Made them for the first time this morning.  Added 1 and 1/2 tsp vanilla and juice from 1/2 lemon.  Let the liquid portion sit at room temperature for about an hour and a half.  Had to warm slightly in the microwave before mixing because the butter congealed when initially mixed with the cold milk.  Once warm, butter remelted and the pancakes turned out perfect.  Made batches of blueberry, chocolate chip and banana pancakes.

Probably the best pancake recipe I have made! The batter was thick, so I wasn't so sure how these were going to turn out at first but I was very pleasantly surprised. My family loved these and ate them right up. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

Excellent recipe. Super quick and easy to put together. Followed it exactly except I used a 1/3c batter for each pancake; It was at least 24 pancakes, maybe a little more, I can't remember! The batter is spongy and on the thicker side, but the pancakes turn out light and fluffy.

Mmmm, these pancakes are PERFECT!  I have long searched for a buttermilk pancake recipe that is just right, and this is the one.  It will be my go-to from now on.  They were tender, flavorful, and cooked perfectly.  I did not make any modifications.

I didn't change a thing, followed the recipe 100%, it turned out great!~ and FYR: I made 4 servings, pouring 1/4 cup of batter each time in the middle of an 8-inch pan(let it spread naturally), it turned out to be 8 pancakes, better size to me, more like the size in restaurants too.

This is a very light pancake with good flavor, but since it is so light, it quickly deflates into a very flat pancake unless you immediately serve it.

I made these this morning for breakfast- followed the recipe to the t and they were fantastic.  i didnt add anything, inside or topping, they were so delicious.   I scaled the size to 8, didnt think I made them too big, but could barely finish 4 they were so fluffy.  Will most certainly make again...thank you Burygold for the recipe!!!!

These turned out very well. I followed the recipe to the letter. I don't use buttermilk often, so I keep frozen cubes of it and thaw when needed. I melted the buttermilk cubes and butter together, then added the milk and egg to them. When I combined this with the dry ingredients I was quite surprised how fluffy the batter was. I'm guessing that cold milk & buttermilk is the reason why others aren't getting the fluff factor.

These pancakes turned out great, and the only reason I can't give a 5 star is because there's a cafe in town that trumps these. I don't know what their secret is, but I'll share if I ever find out. In the meantime, when making your own, these are quite good. I will definitely make them again.

Best pancake recipe I've tried, never buying box mix again. I did only use 1.5 cup buttermilk and 1.5 cup milk, 2 Tablespoons vanilla, and add one more tablespoon sugar. Perfect!!!

Adjust the recipe down to 4 servings and you get the perfect amount of pancakes for 2! It keeps the nice ratio of ingredients that makes this recipe easy and delicious. Also remember to make more of your own buttermilk (add milk to buttermilk in a mason jar, cover and let sit at room temp for 24 hours, then  refrigerate) to use for future enjoyment of these great hotcakes!

I love pancakes but I don't like using a boxed mix. I have made these twice now and they are the fluffiest pancakes I have ever made. Normally, I keep all of these ingredients in the house and it is a fairly quick and easy recipe. Husband loves them.

Excellent recipe ... just as written.  Made 10 large pancakes - fluffy and delicious.  I've made these pancakes several times and the last time I only had a pint of buttermilk -- just added a cup of milk instead.  They were still fine -- didn't think of making substitute buttermilk, but I will next time.  Loved one reviewers idea of freezing the extras between layers of wax paper.

Nice fluffy pancakes. I made them the night before and refrigerated and then let the batter sit at room temp before frying for a 1//2 hr. Do not stir batter before frying. I used a 1/4 c. for each pancake.  I put blueberries on 1/2 of the pancakes when frying. I sprinkled a little sugar over the blueberries before adding. Another favorite recipe on Allrecipes. The batter keeps well for several days.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe as so, and the batter turned out super watery, so my pancakes came out super thin, so the next time I made them I made a few changes, I used a little bit less buttermilk than the recipe called for and I didnt use milk, so my batter turned up less watery. But overall the pancakes tasted really good, they werent sweet like the boxed kind which I really liked, so I will be definiteley making these again!!

Just finished making these. Very easy and very delicious. Kids thought they were awesome  and just as good as our favorite breakfast restaurant that makes them from scratch. Now there's a compliment. No more pancake mix at this house.

This is the best buttermilk pancake recipe...EVER! I have made it lots of times and love it.  Then on a trip to Minneapolis, we ate at a breakfast place called Fat Nat's.  They are famous for their omelets and pancakes.  Their pancakes had a slight almond flavor, so now I add 1/2 teaspoon of almond flavoring.  They don't taste "almondy", but your taste buds pick another layer of flavor. The batter should be quite lumpy to get the lightest, fluffiest pancakes. My family absolutely loves them.

This is a keeper!  I was raised in a pineapple plantation town in the 1960's and as a child my parents used to send me to the restaurant to pick up a box of cooked pancakes, and as a result, became the benchmark for which I judged all other pancakes.  The lady who used to scratch make those pancakes had long since past but my search for a replacement/recipe went on for well over 40 years and I feel that this is the "one!"  Cooked it for the first time the other day and me, my wife & kids just loved it...moist, fluffy, ono (delicous)...what else can I say?  Try it, you'll like it!

yum... my only caution is that after you make these, you'll never be content with pancakes from a packaged mix again.  For a fun kid-friendly twist, slice bananas into discs and dunk them in batter and cook on the griddle - you'll get perfectly round little fruit-filled pancakes that are great for snacks as well as breakfast (the banana gets a sweet pudding-like consistency) -  make a bunch and reheat in toaster oven

Excellent recipe. Regarding the serving sizes - I scaled back by 1/3, and still produced 15 5" pancakes. So beware of quantities. I also had to add a bit more milk (1/4 cup of so) after I mixed everything, because the mixture was a bit too thick and didn't spread evenly on the skillet. But that always differs based on flour quality. Thanks!

I've made this with buttermilk that had been open a week, and it still tastes great.  Easily adapted to whatever you want to add - vanilla, cinnamon, blueberries, whatever.  I've made this almost ever weekend, experimented with additions, and never had a bad batch.

Awesome Pancakes. I had a lot of buttermilk left over from another recipe I had made so I thought I would give it a try. They are light and fluffy and he best part is that it made so many pancakes that I froze the left overs in threes for quick breakfas later. They were just as good after being frozen. Great recipe.

Used egg substitute and left the liquid ingredients out for awhile before actually making the pancakes. Light, fluffy and perfect! So delicious that you didn't even need syrup! Will definitely make again!

I had to review these because my family reviewed them so highly. Made them exactly like the recipe stated. My 6 year old daughter "These are just like hotel pancakes". My 7 year old "These are the best pancakes I have ever had. We should have them Christmas morning instead of cinnamon rolls". My husband "When I ask for pancakes, this is what I want. These are the best pancakes I have ever had." My 4 year old "Yum, I love these." So we will definitely make these again. They were perfect as is. This will become a staple in our house. They are perfect to add things to as well, chocolate chips, blueberries, nuts etc.

These were super easy to make, and my husband says they are the best pancakes I have EVER made for him.  I have been cooking a LONG time, am a Southern cook, and this is the most moist, light and fluffy pancake ever - melts in your mouth!  And I did not pay special attention to waiting until the end to mix it together - I mixed all the dry ingredients and added the wet ones to it, stirred it up good, then made sure my griddle was good and hot, and these only needed about 15 seconds per side to cook and were perfect!  This will be my only pancake recipe from now on!

I don't  even like pancakes-and I thought these were delicious! But, being a non-pancake fan, I had to ask my son, the pancake "connoisseur" who proclaimed "these are good" (Finally! he has never liked any of my recipes ;) I did follow the recipe, however I thinned the batter with a couple Tbsp milk. I noticed the first half of the batter were a bit fluffier than the latter half-but regardless they all turned out great. (I split the recipe in half; I beat the three eggs and took half of that for the recipe since I did not need so many. Half a recipe made about 9 (5-inch) pancakes. I'll be saving this one! Thanks!

Exceptional!  The only change I make to the batter is the addition of vanilla.  I reduce the serving size to 4 and add 1-2 tsp of vanilla.  I always add a cup of fresh blueberries to the batter (again, using 4 servings) and occasionally some lemon zest as well.  A family favorite indeed.  Thanks!

These were light and fluffy however, I would divide my dry and wet ingredients in half and only mix half at a time because by the time I got to the last batch the batter had fallen.  Otherwise, these are well worth the time to make from scratch.

These were the best pancakes I ever made. They are super rich and don't even need to be buttered before eating. A helpful hint: don't combine the wet and dry ingredients until just before you are ready to cook your pancakes.

Light, fluffy and oh so yummy.  I made the recipe for 12 servings and made 42 2-3" pancakes.  The whole family loved them, even the picky eaters.

Finally, a recipe that doesn't give me semi-cooked pancakes!  I had almost given up on making pancakes from scratch.  I will try letting the batter sit overnight next time like another reviewer.

I thought these were just ok, but hubbie seemed to think they were pretty tasty so I give this 4 stars. Not quite as fluffy as stated in the description.

Perfect! I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract because that just adds so much flavor. Today I made this with "caramelized" banana slices. Just melt butter in the pan, place sliced bananas on the grill for a minute, then pour the batter over. When you flip your pancake, the bananas will be a golden caramel. 

FYI...I have made every recipe for pancakes on this site that called for buttermilk or sour cream. This one is the best.

This is the best pancake recipe we have ever used. We looked and looked for many years and some were good but this one is well worth the trip to store for buttermilk . I will never go back to another recipe. cant say enough for you to get that it is good .. no great..

These pancakes are AMAZING. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because they left out one vital step--separate the eggs!  Whip the whites and these will be fluffier than any other pancake you've ever had. The taste is perfect. Definitely making again.

As long as you can stand the smell of buttermilk, this recipe is fantastic. I didn't have any milk in my house so I used 3 1/2 cups of buttermilk instead and the pancakes tasted just fine.

I don't like buttermilk, the smell of it makes me want to retch, but the pancakes tasted just fine.

I recently used this recipe for our learning centers first annual "Grandparents Day" pancake breakfast.  It was AWESOME.  The grandparents enjoyed over 300 pancakes and I thoroughly enjoyed making them! The recipe was easy and delicious (even multipled out to 300).  PERFECT Saturday morning breakfast...or Grandparents Day Celebration!

This is a fantastic recipe, its quickly become our favorite, of all pancakes we've tried!  The buttermilk makes them retain their heat longer too, so I can feed all the kids at the same time.

Awesome recipe! 6 out of 5 stars! Would recommend to make them with 1/4 measuring cup size rather than 1/2 cup, so the middle gets done without overbrowning pancake.

Awesome pancakes!  Everyone in our family of five loved these.  Made more than 12 pancakes, but the perfect amount of fluffy cakes.   We sprinkled fresh blueberries in ours and the kids just gobbled them up.

If you have problems with them being flat try not to over mix.

These pancakes had good flavor, but they were far from fluffy.  They were probably the most flat pancakes I've ever had.  The recipe also made way more than 12.  I think we ended up with at least 30.  I don't know that I'll make them again.

This recipe makes quite a lot of pancakes. I scaled it down to 1/3 and got about 8 medium-sized ones.  They were light and very good. However, as suggested by other reviewers, the batter really needs to sit at least 5-10 minutes before using. Next time, I will increase salt and sugar just a bit.

Spectacular!!!!! Light, fluffy and incredibly tasty! I have been using different recipes for many years. I usually get flat, tough and/or bland pancakes. I followed this recipe exact including cooking instructions and they were spot on. Key* mix right before cooking and DO NOT over beat!!! ENJOY!!!

had some buttermilk to use up. last batch of buttermilk pancakes i made (recipe from the buttermilk box!) were really THICK and dense, not my type of pancake. 
I cut down the amounts to 1/3 = 1 cup flour, 1 tbs sugar etc etc, came up with 1/6 up of milk (v hard to measure).
I followed the instructions properly - combined the batter at the last minute, and only until just mixed, quite lumpy looking batter, the lumps were air bubbles and lumps of flour (like the other user said). Also, my butter happened to be contaminated with cinnamon powder (left over frm some muffins) so i added a few dashes of cinnamon powder (about 1 teaspoon) and one teaspoon vanilla bean paste.
First pancake was SUPER THICK so I added another 1/6 cup of milk (2x the recipe amount) - i had accidentally poured out too much anyway. Batter became quite abit more liquid and pancake turned out lighter and fluffier. 
Quite yummy, and easy to eat. I made mine quite thin, not crepe thinness, but thinner than your average hotcake. Also re-heated them (they cooled very fast) on the pan so they had very slightly crisp outside layer :)
Thank you for sharing!

I made these pancakes this morning. It was my first time actually making pancakes from scratch and they were DELICIOUS! I followed the directions exactly and they were just perfect. Best pancakes my girlfriend and I have ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

Really fluffy and delicious! I didn't have enough butter so I had to sub olive oil - it was still great, but next time I'll use butter.

These are the best pancakes I've ever made or eaten. Perfect, fluffy, light and delicious. I always keep Krusteaz around because the mix makes great pancakes but my kids went wild over these this morning. I didn't have any buttermilk so I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (you can also use cream of tarter) per cup of milk and let it stand for 15 minutes. We will be keeping this recipe in our high rotation.

This is by far the best pancake recipe I have ever had. I actually forgot to add the regular milk until I made like 4 pancakes,so i added the milk late, but they were still light and fluffy and atsty! I also added vanilla extract.

By far one of the best recipes for buttermilk pancakes I've even found.  Very moist, very thick, infact a bit too thick.  I thinned them out by doubling the milk, PERFECT!!! They brown nicely, light and fluffy, great taste, watch out, they make ALOT!!!!

Omitted the sugar and added half a bag of coconut.  Fantastic!  Made a whole batch and froze the leftovers.  They work great in the toaster, believe it or not.

Super crispy on the outside, and tender soft inside.  The buttermilk flavor was not overpowering, but definitely gave it the perfect country taste.  A half batch makes about 6-8 pancakes, and they are filling.

I just made these for my husband and teenage son.  I didn't have enough buttermilk, so used a little regular milk in it's place.  I also used a touch of vanilla.  These pancakes turned out great.  The ingredients are just right, yielding perfect little pancakes each time.  This recipe does make a lot of pancakes, so if you are having a large group or want to freeze some for the rest of the week, then this is your recipe.  Delicious.

The batter was a little too thick so I would add a little more milk next time. Otherwise, fluffy and delicious! I got 8 pancakes with the recipe cut in half, so expect 15 or 16 if you make the recipe as is - not 12.

These pancakes really are as incredible as the nearly 30,000 loyalists say they are.  I didn't tweak a thing in the recipe, and the pancakes came out beautifully.  I'd be curious to try adding in a little vanilla or orange zest for flavor, but really, these are just amazing.

I was looking for some ideas to use up some buttermilk I had left after making butter and these did the trick!  They were very tasty (if you are looking for a plain pancake) and very filling!  I cut the serving size down to four and still had more than enough for two people.  I want to try these again, but next time I want to fold in some fresh blueberries.

These were good, my hubby made them for company this morning.  He did need to add a bit more flour because the batter was thin.

Not sure why these came out thin for my hubby, I made again today, cutting it down to only 4 servings, but making exactly as written and they were great.  Even have some to freeze for breakfast later.

These were really fluffy and good.  I cut the recipe by 1/3 and ended up with 6 medium to large size pancakes.  I also used self-rising flour, so I omitted the addition of baking powder, baking soda and salt.  I let the batter sit for 10 minutes before cooking.  Good stuff and so easy, I don't even know why I've been a box mix user for so long.

Holy Smokes...this was so good. My son's eyes got so big when he took his first bite. 'Oh Mom..these are sooooo good.' He ate 6 pancakes (10 yrs old!). This will be my GO TO pancake recipe from now on. I've used this general combination of ingredients before, but truly, the key is in the mixing. Who knew?? LOL...you learn something new every day. Awesome Awesome!!

We loved this recipe ! I sized the recipe down first because 3 cups of flour is crazy . I did leave the buttermilk mixture on the counter for over an hour and added just a splash of lemon juice. These pancakes came out super fluffy and delicious :)

I finally had to rate this recipe.  I have made it probably 100 times.  It is an awesome basic recipe and is very easy to cusomize.  I think it is very important to use real buttermilk.  The powdered buttermilk changes the texture and is too thin.  I use a whole container of buttermilk (4 cups) and adjust all of my other ingredients proportionally (4 T sugar, 4 t baking powder, 4 eggs, etc.).  It makes a lot, then I freeze the leftover pancakes (they freeze well...then just pop them in the toaster or microwave).  I adjust the thickness of the mixture by adjusting the milk.  Then let your imagination run wild... orange zest & strawberries; chopped apples and walnuts; peaches and almonds; mini chocolate chips for the kids; strawberries, bananas, choc chips and whipped creme on holidays; raspberries; blueberries and orange zest ... you get the idea.  My kids will no longer choke down a box mix pancake (even when we are camping)!  Oh ... and don't forget the real syrup!

Very good. but i only gave these 4 stars because they took a bit longer to cook than i expected. My first few came out raw in the middle. But other than that they were great. They had a very nice fluffy texture and had great flavor. The only thing i would recommend is adding a tsp of vanilla.

These ARE the best pancakes I've ever had. I fed 3 adults and one child with half the recipe, omitted the baking soda, used 2 eggs and 2 tsp baking powder. Overbeating will toughen them, stir until just mixed. This will be the only pancake recipe I will use from now on.

I would have to say unfortunately that this pancake was very disappointing.  Maybe i'm not used to buttermilk pancakes, as this is my first time making them - but there wasn't anything cakey about them.  They resembled a mixture between a pancake and an omlet - very eggy.  Not much flavor either - the super mouthwatering recipe on the back of a well known baking mix is much fluffier and tastier than this egg disc.

I thought I had the best pancake recipe in the world but now I have a new one.  This recipe is similar but much better to me. I made it exactly as written but divided it in half. There are only two of us now and It made just the right amount.  Half recipe made about 12 medium size pancakes.  Wonderful recipe!

Delicious,  i substituted half whole wheat white flour and half oat flour instead of the all purpose. Also used apple sauce instead of the oil,  i am always looking for a way to get more fiber into my toddler

I actually worked in a famous breakfast restaurant for many years, but these could be the best buttermilk pancakes I've ever had!  Loved them!  So did the man & 7 year old!  This recipe is so on the money that my search is over!  Thank you!!

So DELICIOUS!!!!  Had buttermilk in the fridge to use up, saw this recipe and boy am I glad I tried it.  Followed exactly, except did add a bit of vanilla.  I'd describe the batter more as thick than lumpy but there were lumps in it.  Made full recipe and me, 2 5-year olds and 2 3-year olds ate all but 5!  All kids said they were YUMMY!

For some reason when I was making these the measurements seemed a little off to me (I changed the recipe to feed 8) but I followed them anyway.  Good thing that I did because these pancakes turned out delicious.  I added a tsp of vanilla for a little extra depth to the recipe and then after pouring the batter on the griddle I dropped a few blueberries on top.  Turned out delicious! My new favorite pancake recipe, who needs Bisquick?!?

very good, did not have buttermilk so did the skim milk and lemon juice thing. will try with buttermilk next time. also learned leave the lumps that is what makes them fluffy. it just seemed like a very lot of them. this made tons of pancakes. i actually got tired of standing there cooking. will half it next time.

Light and fluffy pancake. I have tried a lot of different recipes for pancakes and my family said this is their favorite one. It's a keeper. Goes in my favorite recipes book. It makes a lot of batter so plan on leftovers.

This recipe is awesome!  I have to admit I was worried when the batter was still pretty lumpy but these turned out GREAT.  They puffed up like no pancakes I've ever seen before.  This is my new pancake recipe!

Thanks! This recipe should be the recipe of the year! I cut recipe in half, and used 2 extra-large eggs. Didn't have buttermilk, so used kefir. Only had 1% milk, so added a little extra butter. Anyone use this recipe for waffles with extra butter? Spectacular!

These pancakes are wonderful!! Light and fluffy. Kind of tastes like funnel cakes when fried in oil. My daughter and I made these together and really loved how they turned out. Makes a very thick but light pancake. You will enjoy this recipe without a doubt.

First time making pancakes with buttermilk. My husband is not a pancake fan, but he tried and LOVED these. I changed serving portion to 6 since I had a small bottle of buttermilk and followed the recipe exactly and came out DElicious. I used a electric griddle at temp 350 with cooking spray instead of butter. The pancakes almost doubled in size.Especially good with some TraderJoe's LemonCurd! My kids liked that I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and some MINI choc chips. Will definitely make again.

These are a really good basic buttermilk pancake recipe.  Had good flavor and was easy to make.  I prefer the "Fluffy Pancakes by Kris" recipe on this site though just because I don't always have buttermilk on hand.

My boys LOVE this!  Regular Bisquick pancakes will no longer do in our house.  I've made this a zillion times now, with chocolate chips, pecans, apples, peaches, and more.  The only thing I do is ease up on the amount of butter.  They get a little heavy and flat if I use the amount of butter called for.  This may be because I always scale the recipe back for 6 pancakes, and maybe in scaling the ratio gets messed up.  But, I would recommend this recipe to anyone for great restaurant-quality pancakes!  Thank you!!

I made these based on so many positive reviews, but I felt they were too sweet.  I prefer buttermilk pancakes without the sugar added as I don't think they need it.

I am the chef for a Charter School in Troy, NY. We feed the students good, wholsome food cooked from scratch- I was looking for a good Buttermilk Pancake recipe that for our hot breakfast and after trying many for weeks, I was stuck on this one. The kids and staff love it. Nice, fluffy cakes that taste wonderful and are super easy to make.

Great recipe, I use it every week. American kids may need 1/3 cup of suger and 2 teaspoons of Pure Vanilla Extract. ;)

This has become our "go to" pancake recipe.   We usually add a splash of vanilla, as my hubs and daughter love vanilla.   Very easy to adjust the serving sizes as long as you remember to make it divisible  by 4.  We like over-sized pancakes and usually get 2.5 servings out of the 4 serving recipe
Update -I was on my own for breakfast so I added a dash of cinnamon and some toasted and chopped pecans...took it to the next level of awesomeness!

We had a pancake cook-off at church tonight and we SMOKED everybody with this recipe!  I added (floured) butterscotch chips to the batter, cinnamon sugar apples, caramel syrup (just regular syrup mixed with butterscotch-caramel ice cream topping) and whipped cream to the top.    It was definitely a sweet, dessert-type pancake, but boy was it GOOOOOD!  So light and fluffy!  Make sure to cook them up right away!  The longer the batter sits the less fluffy they were.

GREAT!  I made the batter the night before.  I made 1/3 the recipe and added 1 extra Tbsp Sugar and 1tsp lemon juice as suggested by another reviewer.  They were crisp and buttery on the outside and moist on the inside, just the way I like them.  This is a keeper.

These are very good. Not so fluffy, but good. I didn't have buttermilk so I used vinegar in skim milk. This way, I didn't use the extra regular milk and it was very thin batter. I also added a little vanilla because I think pancakes should always have vanilla. :)

I love this recipe. It is my new stand-by. I use oil instead of butter to make a pancake with less saturated fat and it works great. I also make it with half whole wheat flour and half all purpose for a whole-grain option.

It's a great, great recipe. But I prefer my batter thinner than this for softer, fluffy pancakes. Just add buttermilk/milk combo until you get the thickness you like. All in all it's going into my recipe book.

I can't complain at all! This is a great recipe! I thought my buttermilk was too thin which was why my other recipe came out awfully flat. But with this recipe it came out great!!!! I added a little vanilla too.

I gave it 3 starts just for following the recipe exactly and it was just ok, nothing to rave about. I think needs more sugar and vanilla. BUT I give 5 stars for the following addition I made: I took part of the batter once mixed and set it in a diferent bowl, then I mashed a ripe banana very well and folded in the batter I set aside since I didn't have enough bananas for the entire batch, and oh boy they came out soooo good!! It melts in your mouth and the banana is not overpowering since it is mashed well and you don't run into pieces of bananas. TRY IT I think even if not a banana lover wich I am not you will like it. My 3 year old and 10 month old twins loved them. Next time I will make sure to have about 3 or 4 bananas to add the the batter. This recipe makes sooo much batter!

My kids inhaled these pancakes and raved about them.  I basically followed the recipe, except that I mixed everything in one bowl- wet ingredients first, then added each dry ingredient.  I think it worked out just fine to do it that way.

This is the best pancake recipe I have ever tried. The pancakes are smooth and crusty on the outside and fluffy and delightful on the inside. The inside is almost custardy because while it cooks through, there is something really rich and wonderful that makes these more moist than average pancakes. Scrumptious!

These weren't fabulous.  I made the exact recipe (which is way too big, by the way) and thought they were very bland.  Next time, I might add some vanilla extract for flavor.

Yum! These pankcakes are wonderful. Be sure to set out eggs, buttermilk, & milk at least 30 minutes to an hour prior to cooking... this makes them nice and fluffy. I also added a tsp of vanilla to the mix. Don't over mix when you add the dry ingredients to the wet; it's more like folding it in. The batter will be super lumpy but no worries because the flour clumps break up while cooking. You have to try this recipe, surely you'll agree that the pancakes are delicious!

Absolutely love this pancake recipe!  I make these almost every weekend.  The only thing I change is adding light buttermilk instead of regular.  I usually try to mix the egg, milk and buttermilk together early and let set, so it can start coming up to room temperature.  Also, once I learned why it is so important not to over-mix the batter, my pancakes are incredible. Just mix the batter until everything starts to come together, there will still be lumps and streaks of flour.  Then let sit for 5 minutes before adding to skillet, this will allow the baking soda to do its job and the pancakes will turn out light and fluffy.  Great recipe.

I used this recipe for waffles and they turned out great--very fluffy and soft.  I substituted safflower oil for the butter and added some cornmeal for a little crunch.  1/3 of the recipe made two large belgian waffles.

My 13 year old stepson and I didn't think these came out any better than what we could get out of a box. Not worth the trouble. Will keep looking for something that tastes like our favorite pancakes at IHOP.

These were awesome - my batter turned out a little think, so I added an extra splash of milk just to make them a cookable density (so thick and fluffy).  You don't even need to butter them because of the buttery flavor from the batter!  One note - half this recipe if you have less than 4 people in your family - it makes ALOT of batter!!

This recipe was super.  I halved the amounts listed because we only have 2 people in our family (used 2 eggs).  We really enjoyed them, they have such good flavor & I will make them again.

Really, really, really, really delicious.  Pretty much the best pancakes I ever made.  Was spending way to much at the famous breakfast place twice a month so I decided to try making them myself.  These were pretty close to perfection.  Will definitely being making these every weekend.  Thanks for the recipe!

The best pancakes I've ever made. My family loves them! I make them every weekend now. For a family of 4, this is the perfect amount. I halved the ingredients the first time and did not have enough. If I have extra, I also freeze them and they are great later. I don't have buttermilk, but I do as the other reviewers suggest, and add a tsp. of cider to the milk. I also make my own yogurt regularly, and adding 1/2 cup of yogurt to the milk ingredients works well to make the buttermilk and cream.

I made this almost exactly how the recipe said; I only added a little bit of vanilla.  These were fantastic!  As a previous reviewer said, I only stirred these until they were just mixed, and made sure not to overstir.  These are the best pancakes I have ever had!  My very picky daughter ate 2 and wanted more, and my husband raved about them!  These will definitely be the go-to pancakes for us from now on.

these pancakes are easy to make and taste amazing! Although, they made almost 30 pancakes instead of the twelve the recipe said so if u aren't looking to cook for a party i would suggest cutting the recipe in half.

I have made this recipe a few times now and all the boxed pancake mix has been eradicated from the pantry. This time, though, as I was pouring the carton of Cass Clay buttermilk into the bowl I noticed there was a recipe for pancakes on it as well. I thought to myself, surely this can't be as good as the recipe I'm using, but thought I'd compare it anyway--identical, except they suggest another tsp of salt and no milk.

This is the best pancake recipe I have ever tried! They're light, fluffy and delicious. Usually, I cut the recipe in half, because this makes a lot more than my family of 3 can finish. If you make more than you need, the batter keeps well in the fridge and the finished pancakes freeze well too. Also, these are great with blueberries, chocolate chips ands other add ins. Use about 1 cup of any add in for the full recipe.

These were super fluffy and light!  I added a little lemon juice like someone else had suggested and let it sit in the fridge until morning.  I prefer wheat pancakes b/c they are better for you, but then I am the only one enjoying them.  My hubby and 5 yr old loved these (and secretly so did I ;)

These pancakes are delicious!  I made half a batch using white whole wheat flour, and they were a big hit at this house!  Of course, any time my granddaughters ask for more, I know I've scored!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Biggest complaint is that it makes waaaay more than 12 5inch pancakes.  I got 12 pancakes plus 6 4 inch waffles.  Took another reviewers advice and started making waffles (which were very good) so I could be done with brunch in time for dinner.  But the taste and texture were great!

We made these FABULOUS pancakes this AM.  I was a little iffy at first after reading the reviews, whether to have the batter sit out, the eggs and milks at room temp., and or leaving the batter in the fridge overnight.  Well we pretty much followed the recipe as is and they turned out fantastic.  But just a note, if you have a butter spray, that may be used in sub. for actual butter.  I tried both this AM, and the butter gives it a little toasty crunch while the spray was a little on the lighter side.  Thank you for this recipe!

Burygold, You nailed it!  These are outstanding pancakes; the best I've ever made, too.  I made them exactly as the recipe states.  I keep a jar of vanilla sugar on hand, and used that for the sugar called for in the recipe.   My husband just raved about them.  Can't wait to try them with some banana's or chopped apples or blueberries added.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
01/30/2011- I've been making these for a while since I first reviewed them, and what I've come to appreciate about this particular recipe is how easy it is to scale this recipe quanity, up or down, myself.  The ingredient quantites and so nicely even.   I also like that you can adjust the thickness of the cake by adding or reducing the milk in the recipe. I add fruit to it as I pour the batter on the griddle, I get better distribution and it doesn't thin or discolor the batter (blueberries!)  This is still the best recipe I've ever used and is the only one I'll ever use!  They are So good!

Whoa,whoa,whoa, this recipe ALWAYS makes a large group-worth of pancakes.  I make it for a family of 5 & usually have a full meal's worth left over. I've been making this exact same recipe that I got from mrbreakfast.com & have loved it from the beginning.  Guests alway comment on how thick & fluffy my cakes are.  When we're visiting family & they make boxed pancake, it reminds me exactly why I have purchased the boxed batter i over two years. My alterations: 1) For the buttermilk, I add 3 Tbl wt. vinegar+enough milk to = 3 cup, stir & let sit while I continue prepping batter.   2) I agree with others about letting milk & eggs warm which results in fluffier cakes.  3) I add a few dashes of cinnamon into the dry mix.   This gives it that real fresh, homemade quality that's rare in the majority of pancake recipes. I've got mixed thoughts about the batter sitting prior to browning.  I've heard both conflicting recommendations from very knowledgable cooks.  Some swear, you must NOT mix dry & wet product until your griddle is completely ready, not a moment before.  Yet others, like some sugg'd here, say let batter sit anywhere from a couple minutes to let things set up to days in the fridge.  I've only let them sit prob'ly 20 mins at most, don't know if ever truely noticed a huge difference (ea of my batches tend to be different, as pancake batters usually are extremely tempermental)  Plan on trying to let sit over night as sugg'd next time I make these, usually every Sunday

Ok so I had never made pancakes before from scratch figuring the boxed mixes were quite fine. But then I had some buttermilk left over from another recipe,had some time to spare on a rainy Saturday morning and I decided to try my hand at these. Well, I will never use a mix again! These were delicious. It's just me so I cut the servings down to 4 (one third of the ingredients). Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I did let the butter cool completely before adding to the other wet ingredients and I let the wet ingredients sit for about an hour prior to mixing.(as suggested by other reviewers) I was also very careful not to over mix. The pancakes were sooo light and incredibly fluffy.Delectable even without syrup. Easily the best pancakes I have ever had! The recipe does yield a lot though because even after I thirded it, I used a 1/2 cup measuring cup and still ended up with 5 large pancakes. Watch the heat too if you are using an electric stove..medium heat was too high and scorched my first one..

I reduced this recipe to 1/4 batch because it was just for me.  It still made 12 pancakes.  I can't imagine the reduction affected the taste.  Perhaps my buttermilk did but they really weren't that great.

I didn't have buttermilk, I put 1 tbsp of white vinegar, then poured the milk in to the "1 cup" line, & let it sit for about 5 min.  I make these every Sunday, it is a recipe I use regularly and comes out perfect each time

While the taste was fine, I would rate it at just that, fine. The pancakes were flat (and as my 4 year old put it, squiggly... which made it hard to cut) good pancakes should be fluffy, crisp yet not crunchy. I have made better but lost my favorite recipe... guess I'm going to have to keep looking for a comparable one!

Great recipe! Very light and airy. This recipe makes a ton of pancakes, but since they are so light and airy, you don't feel bloated after eating them. I made the mix the night before and let it sit in my fridge overnight. They were fantastic the next morning.

These are so good!  The last time I made them, I did add an extra 1/2 cup of milk because previously the batter was so thick that the pancakes were doughy in the middle.  Excellent recipe!

These were the BEST pancakes I've had! I let eggs, melted butter, and both milks sit out for an hour before starting. As recommended, I added a dash of fresh lemon juice and vanilla. And right after I poured 1/4 cup batter per cake on the hot griddle, I sprinkled in fresh blueberries.  I ate several plain--terrific!   Halved the recipe and it made 15 four inch pancakes.  This is going to be a regular at my house.

DELICIOUS! Way to much for just me, a 1 year old, and a 3 year old. I should have made less batter. I'm sure my 3 year old will love the leftovers though. (You just keep them sealed overnight then toast them the next day.)

These were good.  I scaled the recipe back to feed 4 and even for the 4 of us there were leftovers.  They were fluffy and good.  I followed another reviews suggestion of letting the eggs and buttermilk sit out...YUM!  My 1 year old at 2 big pancakes!  Thanks for the recipe!

I consider myself to be a pancake snob - and this recipe passed my test.  In fact, I can't remember ever making or eating a lighter, fluffier pancake - and I didn't even have buttermilk on hand.  I used 3 T. fresh lemon juice and then enough milk to complete the 3 cups that the recipe calls for.  In lieu of the other 1/3 c. milk,  I beat in an equivalent amount of sour cream.   These were fabulous, and I want to thank "burygold" for the treasure!

I have made this recipe for years! It makes great pancakes, my whole family loves them. Breakfast, lunch or dinner it is quick and easy. I haven't tried adding vanilla as others suggest but will make it tonight and see, we all love vanilla.

These are good. The buttermilk is a must. DS who is a pancake aficionado, declared these to be the best I've made yet.   We added blueberries to the batter and they were scrumptious.

Great pancakes, picky 3 year old grand daughter likes these. Hubby will eat most of these. I scaled the recipe down for 4 servings. Wasn't enough to go around maybe I'll just make the entire recipe next time. Do not over mix. Big fluffy cakes. love them.

I made these for mothers day brunch and they were such a hit! Note: I added the melted butter to the mixture with the buttermilk and because the buttermilk was so cold, the butter became solid again and created little chunks in the batter. I panicked a bit but went with it. If this happens to you, don't worry, keep rollin and they will turn out fab! The next time I host a breakfast or lunch I'll make these for sure!

So tasty!  These pancakes are very fluffy and airy, and have a delicious flavor.  I made the recipe according to the directions but I did cut it down to 4 servings which was enough for the group I was serving. The only addition I made was to add a little bit of pure vanilla extract to the batter.  I will be making these again.

Awesome recipe, very easy. Only change I made was to separate the eggs. The yolks got mixed with the milk mixture, and the I beat the whites to soft peaks. Once the milk mixture was mixed with the dry ingredients, I folded in the whites until they were JUST BARELY incorporated. Very very fluffy pancakes.

My family loves these.  I have made them with fresh buttermilk and dried.  When I made them with dried buttermilk, I found that they were more flat than with the fresh.  So the last time I made them, I did not add the 1/4 cup milk.  They turned out much fluffier.  However, I think I prefer fresh buttermilk.

My husband and I agreed we'd "order" these again.  They were tasty, light, fluffy and yet had substance to them.  My 6 year old deemed them the best pancakes he's ever had.  We will make these again for sure!

I loved the pancakes. I didn't give the recipe 5 stars because I needed to add more sugar. but even without the addition of sugar this recipe would have been great. I made about 7 pancakes and 8 waffles. The family loved it.

Excellent recipe - makes alot, which freeze well.  Made them for my grandchildren and they said they were "GREAT" and ate twice as many as usual.  The tip of dusting the blueberries with flour works well.  Family favorite now.  Thank you.

What is Shrove Tuesday without pancakes and this is the best recipe by far.  Made these exactly as written and the pancakes were over 1/2 inch high.  It was hard to try and spread, so left them quite thick adn turned down the temp a bit.  Hard to judge when to flip, as compared to thinner pancakes.  I have 3 men (2 teenage football players) and for our family of 5 this was a perfect batch size.  Don't usually buy buttermilk as I never aquired the taste for it, unlike my Irish father, so to tip the hat to Grandpa, we'll add to our favorites.

Rave reviews all around!  I cut down the recipe to four servings and it was enough to feed my family of four.  Who knew buttermilk makes such a big difference?  Try throwing in some ground flax seed, fresh blueberries, and chopped pecans for a tasty treat.

These pancakes are by far the best pancakes ever! I always make these when I have company and people can never get enough. I keep forgetting to rate these, but I was reminded after my husband went to a pancake feed.  He came back and said their pancakes were terrible compared to mine!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  Being new to the cooking world, I was excited to try pancakes from scratch for my first time.  The only problem I had was that the medium-high heat turned out to be too hot and instead I needed medium on my stove.  The first two were slightly burnt due to this, but the third pancake turned out perfectly browned and was absolutely delicious!  I can't imagine finding a better recipe out there for pancakes.

Very good pancake recipe. Fluffy and light, they melt in your mouth. Make sure to follow the instructions and mix the liquids with dry ingredients when ready to make the pancakes. Also, mix the liquids first and let them sit while you combine the dry ones and get the skillet ready.

These are great! I actually modified a bit based on what I have and the fact that it's just me and hubby and we didn't want leftovers. I did 1/3 the recipe (4 servings), which made 4 thick 6-inch pancakes - perfect! Also, used self-rising flour and left out the baking soda, salt, etc (didn't have all-purpose). Also didn't have buttermilk, so used 1 Tbsp white vinegar and then topped it up with whole milk to reach 1 cup. Sizzled each one in butter in the pan over med-hi heat till full of bubbles and edges looked done - YUM!!

We've been making this recipe for years, and always a delicious outcome.  I grew up on bisquick pancakes and other dismal diner fare and thought I'd never meet a pancake I actually looked forward to eating.  These are, bar none, the absolute best pancakes I've ever had.  

A note - the dry mix can be made up ahead of time - you can mix up a big load of the dry ingredients and then just weigh out one batch's worth when you want pancakes even faster.

Absolutely amazing pancakes, and only takes about 3 minutes longer than Bisquick.  Fluffy, beautiful texture, and amazing taste. 

I added 1 tsp vanilla, and as for the procedure, I put the butter in a 2 cup Pyrex measuring cup, melted it, let it sit for about 5 minutes, then while vigorously whisking the butter, streamed the beaten eggs into it, then stirred that mix into the milks.  Poured the whole thing into the bowl of dry items, stirred 17 times, and voila.  

YUMMY!!!!!

This recipe is absolutely awesome!!  I had some leftover buttermilk to use...but realized that I didn't have any milk after everything was already mixed.  So, I used heavy cream since it was only a half cup.  I took the advice of others and added a tablespoon of lemon juice and allowed it to sit overnight!  Also please add a teaspoon (or two) of vanilla!!!  This does make a ton of batter, but I am doing quite well with using it by myself.  Also, cook on medium low heat..medium is too high and will cook too quickly!!

Absolutely amazing pancakes. They are definitely not a syrup pancake though; they pair better with home made jam or fresh fruit. Will definitely make again.

FANTASTIC!  The only word that describes these cakes.  I've searched many a recipe thoughout my lifetime for the "ultimate BUTTERMILK" and this one is it!  Time and time again.  All 7 members of my family rate this #1, and that's not easy to do. Smile

I changed as follows:  use 3/4 cup milk, 1 TBS vanilla, and increase the sugar.  I accidently added wayyyyyyyyyy more sugar one time, so I carefully spooned off most of it, but wasn't sure how much was left....well it was the best batch I had made so far.  So I'm guessing I will increase the sugar to 1/3 cup next time I make these.  I like to make these and freeze them, separated by wax paper.  They just pop in the microwave.  We don't even put syrup on them they are soooooo good!!

I don't think you will find a better pancake recipe.  It makes quite a bit, but I have refrigerated leftover batter and used it the next day with no problems.

Delicious, fluffy and tender. My only modification was whole wheat pastry flour. I warmed the egg in a bowl of warm water and sat the buttermilk in a cup in a bowl of warm water - fluffs up nicer than putting them in cold. This recipe is a classic, thanks for sharing!

My cousing from the U.K. was here in the U.S. so I wanted to make a breakfast treat for her.  And these pancakes were UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I had checked out some of the reviews from others before going ahead, as I'm not a big pancake fan--there is always something that I can critique about them.  However, with these...
WoW!!!
I had added some of the tips of having the buttermilk, eggs & butter at room temperature.  Separating the dry ingredients from the wet ingredients.  And added my personal touch of having the sugar mixed with 2 tspn of cinnamon and 1 tspn of nutmeg to add to the dry ingredients afterwards.  Then I incorporated the idea of beating the egg WHITES into a meringue like state with stiff peaks.  Mixed the sugar mixture, with the dry ingredients.  Mixed the dry with the wet ingredients.  Then added the "meringue-like" whites into the fold.  Added a cup of blueberries, some extract (vanilla/pineapple).  Though tempted, I made sure not to OVER STIR the mix and began making the first batch of pancakes...

And I was in HEAVEN!!!  

MMMMMMMMMMMMM!

They were thick, HUGE pancakes that had a beautiful golden brown appearance; yet, but inside were light and moist when eating them.  The cup of blueberries added were just PERFECT!  I seldomly write reviews, but I had too!  As these were DEFINITELY the BEST pancakes I've had!  Will be making plenty more for sure!  Again, thanks for sharing this recipe!

Don't try to make these with powdered buttermilk!!!!! My first attempt I tried the powdered buttermilk, the second I used the real deal. A 100% difference! Light, fluffy; everything a pancake should be. Yummy! Better than that famous box mix and as an added bonus; none of the preservatives!!

I must say I was pretty disappointed in these pancakes considering all the great reviews.  They were definitely too 'eggy' as another reviewer commented, and not 'cakey' enough, which is how I would like my panCAKEs to be.  I followed the recipe to a 'T', so not sure if there was anything else I could have done differently.  Won't be making them again though.  I will keep searching for the ultimate pancake...

For basic, fluffy pancakes this recipe is great.  For our family of three, I cut the ingredients by a third (4 servings).  I usually prefer a more hearty whole wheat type of pancake, but this recipe will certainly please everyone.

My husband has had a favorite pancake recipe that he's used for years, but THIS recipe has become our new family favorite!  These pancakes are light, fluffy and flavorful from the buttermilk.  They also work well with added ingredients like chopped pecans or mini-chocolate chips or, my favorite, blueberries.  Best of all, they aren't heavy in texture or in your stomach later!

Very light pancakes indeed. These were thin and sure didn't rise up much. They were very tender though and moist. Not a lot of flavor thought and I thought these were rather bland. "Light and fluffy just like we like 'em", were my husband's words. Thanks.

OMG! I made these for dinner tonite. I created buttermilk w/2% milk & lemon juice and added 1/2 of a 4 serving package of vanilla pudding mix. My kids ate them up and begged me to make them for breakfast 2morrow! Finally, my 'scratch' flapjacks are better than bisquick!

Really phenominal! I really appreciated the reviews about letting the liquids warm to room temperature, and about dredging the berries (raisins, nuts, etc) in the flour mixture to keep them from dropping to the bottom. My two year old actually had 2 1/2 pancakes and my husband was raving! Thank you so much.

LOVE this recipe!  I usually cut out the extra 1/2 cup a milk as it makes it too watery to me.  Unless I'm using whole wheat flour, then it needs the extra 1/2 cup milk.  I usually make it at least one weekend morning and the kids just LOVE them!  Also good with 1 cup chocolate chips for a special treat!

Made this recipe for the first time last Friday evening for a light Friday evening supper -- it was a HUGE hit!  My husband could not stop raving!  They were such a big hit with the family I made them again for Easter Sunday Brunch.  This is my new favorite pancake recipe!

Excellent pancake recipe!  We tried it this morning and loved it.  We love apples in our pancakes - we pour the batter on the griddle, put slices of peeled apple on top, add a little butter,  and when we flip them the apple cooks through nicely and carmelizes a little.  With the excellent fluffy pancakes, they turned out great.  thanks!

I did what one reviewer suggested and let the milks and egg sit out to bring to room temp.  Boy were my pancakes thick and fluffy!  Because they were so thick, I had to cook on a lower temp.  More like Med than med High.  ef. be careful not to overmix.  I tried with blueberries, but with the buttermilk flavor, like it better without.  This will be my go-to recipe!

It was the best pancakes I've ever tasted! My husband is not a big fan of pancakes and he will only eat one pancake. When I cooked this, he ate 2 of them. I divide the recipe to 3 since there's only 2 of us...and it worked perfectly. 1/3 of the recipe makes 5 pancakes and each of us has 2 (the other one was left untouched since we are sooo full). We had the pancakes with sausage and it feels like eating at a restaurant. Thank you!

Delicious pancakes!  The only changes I made out of personal preference was to add more flour, I prefer a thicker pancake. I also did not have buttermilk on hand so I followed a substitution recipe of 1 cup milk plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice per 1 cup of butter milk, worked like a charm. This recipe is going into my collection. Thanks for sharing!

Wanted to try a diff recipe from my own.  Followed recipe exactly, but maybe its just my taste buds and preferance.  This pancake didnt impress me or scream uber yummy.  To me, it tasted too much of flour rather than buttermilk.  I'll stick with my buttermilk recipe instead :)

We thought these were delicious.  I made them with freshly ground soft wheat and sucanat.  I also made them up a day ahead and kept them in the refrigerator overnight.  We will definitely make these again.

This was a delicious, light, fluffy mid-week breakfast treat.  I did add a dash of vanilla to the batter, and warmed the dairy and egg to at least room temperature.

Scaled the recipe for three servings and it was plenty for myself, a one year old and three year old with a few left over.

This one is going into the pancake rotation for sure!

Great recipe. The only change I made was to add a splash of vanilla extract which added a nice sweetness. Other than that the pancakes came out great.

This is a HUGE batch. I scaled it down to eight servings and it still made a ton.

Made these last night for a quick dinner. Heat the griddle over high heat till it was hot, then turned the heat to medium high. Cooked them till bubbles appeared on the top,flipped them, and continued till second side was golden. No doubt these are the most scrumptious pancakes ever...fluffy and flavorful. Oh, yes I made sure the buttermilk and egg were at room temperature before I made the batter.

We change the portion to 4 people and that is perfect for me and my husband. We continue to have a problem with the thickness and cook time. I think it is my stove top...in order to get it to cook all the way through, it nearly blackens on the outside...I have added a little more milk at times to thin it and that helped but then they weren't as fluffy. The flavor is great though and we plan to keep trying until we find the right temperature for cooking!

I love this recipe. I have used it several times and the recipe has never failed me. I have been out of buttermilk and used 3.5 cups of whole milk with the same wonderful results as when I use buttermilk. I haven't used a box mix since I found this recipe. I also lvoe that it makes a lot so I can get two day's worth.

Great recipe!  My pancakes were nice and fluffy.  I added a fruit topping (frozen berries and sugar, microwaved, then mashed together) and my friend raved about how delicious they were.  This is going to be my standard panacake recipe from now on.

Wonderful and very light and fluffy.  I added some fresh blueberries to the pancakes before I flipped them. My husband ate four plate sized pancakes!  I made a large batch and am going to freeze them individually so that we can just pop one in the toaster for a quick weekday breakfast.

Finally a from scratch pancake recipe that worth the trouble.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I didn't have fresh buttermilk (used a powdered version), but they still turned out terrific!  They had a beautiful golden brown, lacey patterned exterior, with a fluffy and light interior, exactly what I was looking for.  My very thin and picky daughter (who normally looks at food and gets full) gobbled down three large ones and asked if I could make these again.  Absolute keeper, and probably even better when I get my hands on fresh buttermilk!

This one deserves 10 stars. I've made these at least 5 times, and these are the only pancakes I'll make now.  Great with some frozen blueberries mixed in. The fresh buttermilk gives it great flavor. I live at 6000 ft elevation, so I reduce the baking powder by 1/2 tsp and let the batter sit for a couple of minutes before making the pancakes.

This was an amazing recipe and even my husband, who's extremely picky, loved these.  I sifted the dry ingredients before adding the wet ones.  I froze the leftover pancakes in zip-lock bags in groups of 3.  When someone was ready to eat some, we just microwaved them for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on high and they tasted like they were just made fresh.

I love these pancakes!  I made the recipe as is because we had some wonderful homemade syrup from a local market to use... I may try experimenting in the future - but they are wonderful! Great taste and texture!

I'm living in Slovakia so the ingredients are different. I have always been fearful of making pancakes but I faced my fear and made the yummiest pancakes ever. My mother was visiting and she was sincere in her criticism..."Those were the best pancakes ever!" I agree. I use vanilla sugar as part of the sugar portion. We don't have maple syrup so I used homemade preserves to top it. But eating them plain is a real treat for the palate!

Best pancakes ever! I added about a tsp. of real vanilla to batter added just an extra touch of goodness.  Advice don't cook pancakes too long or they get tough, that goes for any pancake!

Oh my god... how YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!! the only bad thing about this recipe is the amount of gym time i have to through so i dont feel so guilty! YUMMY! like us australians say, they are definately Moreish!!!! meaning, I want more, MORE, MORE!!! Thank you. This was the first time i ahve made buttermilk pancakes, and the only reason i wanted to try them was because i was spending too much money on pancakes at pancakes on the rocks, i think americans haveIhop,or something...

Yummy. Thank you.

You must give these a try. i didnt change a thing, but next time i will use Equal sugar rather than actual sugar. Equal sugar is a brand in australia that taste EXACTLY like sugar but no gym time required.

Fantastic pancakes!  These are a favourite in our house and I make no other!  My eldest son, who's very picky, loves these too - which says something.  Why anyone would make pancakes from a box is beyond me - these are so easy and so delicious!  Thanks!

I don't know why I've bought pancakes in a box all these years . . . these are the best!  Although when I converted the recipe to 4 servings, my hubby and I devoured the whole thing so keep that in mind!

excellent buttermilk pancakes.  I tried this for breakfast yesterday, and my husband and I really liked it.  The only bad thing was that it took forever to cook because it makes a lot and it left the house smelling like burnt butter all day since we melted butter in the pan to cook the pancakes in.  Other than that it was great!

These pancakes were just "okay."  Nothing to rave about.  I was looking for a fluffy pancake, like the description said.  I was very disappointed...we thought they were heavy and wet, eventhough I did not overstir the batter.  I've had much lighter pancakes.  I'm going back to my old recipe.

FABULOUS!  These are the best buttermilk pancakes ever.  Sometimes, when "in season" I'll use eggnog for the milk.  I also have to add more milk to make them thinner... I'm not crazy about cakey pancakes.  I had my hubby mix them up for me yesterday and he even made a little ooops with tsp and tbs measuring (tried to fix it and apparently did), but it still turned out terrific.  I like to make up a big batch, so I can keep them in the freezer and pop them in the microwave for breakfast on school days.  SSSOOOO GOOOD!!!  I feel like a pro when I make these up!  Thanks for such a simple, delicious recipe.  Ever since this pancake recipe, I will ONLY make the box-mixed kind when I have no buttermilk or less time.  There is no comparison.

I made this for my kids last night.  I'm not much of a cook but got rave reviews!  They cooked up beautifully and were so easy to make.  Definitely will stay a family favorite.  I had added vanilla since others said to but honestly think next time I will leave the vanilla out and do the recipe exactly as written ... I didn't think the vanilla really added anything and in my opinion distracted from the true flavor.

I loved it.  I flipped it a little by taking down the flower a bit and not being so precise on the backing powder... and a little evap milk.  I put blueberries in one and rasberries in another and it was ON!

Honestly - I'm not sure what everyone is raving about.  I made these pancakes for breakfast and I wasn't overly impressed.  My tastebuds, and those of my husband, weren't shouting "WOW"  *lol*

I did add vanilla - and would definitely make that recommendation for everyone.

If you're looking to scale the recipe down - your best bet is to scale it to a proper measurement - such as 8 or 4.  Otherwise you are left with a recipe which calls for 1 1/2 eggs... not exactly something most people will be able to figure out how to do.  If you scale the recipe to 8 or 4 - you will get easier measurements.

EXCELLENT!  I greased the pan with a little butter.  The pancakes are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Don't worry if the batter is lumpy, they turn out great!!!!  Thanks.

We just had these for breakfast. They're deliciously light and fluffy. I added a little vanilla extract to the wet mix and some frozen blueberries to the dry. 
I will definitely add this recipe to my collection.

This is a good basic buttermilk pancake recipe.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Shhhh.  Don't tell any one, but this is also a good batter for fried chicken.  Not your traditional southern variety, but tasty.

I think this recipe has potential to be very delicious based on others' reviews.  However, I decreased the recipe online before printing and I think this is where I went wrong, b/c the pancake was toooo moist.  So, I will try it again when we have enough people to eat the full recipe.  CAUTION: DO NOT CHANGE THE RECIPE!

This recipe is simply the best! It was flavorful and easy to make. I variated from the recipe by cutting it in half (I was only cooking for myself). I also added a little more regular milk. I like my pancakes a little thinner. These were the best pancakes I have tasted in a long time (much better than the boxed mix).

Fantastic.  My husband said these were delicious. I followed the recipe to a T except I added blueberries and chopped strawberries.  These made so many that I froze them individually on a cookie sheet and then vacuum sealed them in packets of two.  My husband just pops them in the microwave and has a quick breakfast before leaving for work.  I think these will be a constant in our house.

My husband loved these pancakes which is why I rated them a 5 however, I was looking for a heavier pancake.  Perhaps I will use wheat flour next time.  Excellent flavor though!

Like Lebury says, they are light and fluffy.  And very good.  Tip: flip the pancakes when the bubbles in the middle start to break.

I've made these pancakes twice so far.  As it's written, I'd give it a 4 out of 5: nice texture and taste pretty good, but a little too eggy for me.  The next time, I didn't use any eggs and used twice as much salt, and they were perfect!!   To me, IHOP pancakes are the best and I've been looking for a recipe like that for many years.  These, with the alterations, fit the bill *perfectly*.  Thank you so much, we'll enjoy these for years to come.

Very good and fluffy. I thought they tasted more like crepes than pancakes. Which is ok, I guess, if you like crepes! For my part, I'll stick to the "old-fashioned pancakes" from this site.

The whole family really liked these. My daughter thought they were better than Denny's. I did not think 3 Tbsp of sugar would be enough, but they tasted fine. No need to serve with butter, there was plenty in the recipe.

In all my adilt life I have always been thinking of this exact pancake whenever I wanted pancake, and this is the first pancake - homemade or restaurant that has ever delivered!  Perfect texture and moisture level, etc.  I did sub as foloows - honey for sugar, lemon juice and milk for buttermilk and strawberries (crushed) for the extra milk.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My flatmates in F-block loved these pancakes. It makes a lot, but they ate them all. I added 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract, as mentioned by previous reviewers.

This was GREAT!  I followed the recipe for 8 servings and there was no leftovers for 4 of us.  Next time I'll use 12 servings because the kids definitely wanted more.  Thanks.

Very good. I am one who always adds extra stuff to my pancakes---nuts, fruit, spices, different flours, etc. But, this time, I decided I would make the recipe just as written to taste the basic pancake. It was tough for me, but I was sooo glad I resisted. It is a great just plain pancake (which is usually what my husband prefers). It was nice and light, fluffy--not chewy or flat at all. When my husband comes home from his business trip tomorrow, I think he'll be pleased. :)

I cut the recipe in half and I'm glad that I did.  I was able to get eight (8) 4"-5" pancakes out of the half mix I prepared.  The pancakes were good, just like something you would get out of the box, but without the additives. Will use this as my basic buttermilk pancakes recipe.

I am definitely a big pancake fan and I usually don't have a problem with pancakes but for some reason these just don't sit well with me.  I've made them twice to give it a fair shot but maybe it's too much baking powder?  They were kinda bland the first time so I added some sugar and vanilla which did improve the flavor, but other than being a bit too spongy for me, they just didn't do it.  So far I like the truck stop buttermilk pancakes and I still have more to try!  My boys really enjoyed them, but these just weren't the pancake for me.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! Pancakes are my favorite, and as another reader had mentioned, I've been searching forever for the perfect recipe. The only thing I do to make these a little better is to add some vanilla extract or flavoring. Whenever I use this recipe, I scale it down to 4 and use about 1 tsp. of flavor. They don't even need syrup then!

Didn't have  buttermilk, so I made my own (1 tbs lemon juice in a 1 C measure, then filled w/milk).  Made one and it was a bit bland, so I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients and some vanilla to the milk.    Definately improved the flavor.

Best pancakes I have ever had and I don't really care for pancakes, just a tip not that this is a must for extra fluffy pancakes I use 3 oz milk 1 oz ginger ale or seltzer, to the liquid mixture.  Also I seperate the eggs and beat the whites until they are nice and stiff and add them after I have combied the other ingredients mix in and let everything sit for 5 minutes so that eveything can meld together.

A bit of work for pancakes, especially if you are used to bisquick, but boy are they good.  Don't be scared when your batter is lumpy, they come out perfect.

I'm a pancake-aholic and these were truly delicious!  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and it still made 6, 5 inch pancakes (perfect for hubby and I!).  I added (to my scaled down recipe, so times 3 for the full recipe) 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, and instead of 1 tbsp. sugar I used 3 tbsp of sugar.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla.  I served them with the Cinnamon Apple Syrup recipe on this site (highly recommend it, it was awesome!).  Enjoy!

These pancakes were a hit in my household.  I made them for some relatives who were visiting.  They immediately complimented on how yummy they were.  The recipe was very easy to make and like others have said...they do make alot!  But, before I printed the recipe I used the "customize this recipe" at the bottom and selected 6 servings to convert it to a smaller recipe.  Worked out great!  We will definately use over and over again...thanks for sharing!

I'm rating these a four only because of personal preference.  If you are looking for a really thick and very very moist pancake, these would be for you.  Personally, we like ours a little firmer and drier.

These are very light and fluffy; they are very good pancakes. I think I would like them better if they had a touch more salt in them, so I'll try that next time. I also used lowfat buttermilk, and they tasted great.

Buttermilk makes these the fluffiest pancakes with the best flavor! I get the best results when I let the buttermilk sit out for about one half hour before its ready to be used in the recipe. This takes the chill away and produces a fluffier pancake. A winner.

I added more sugar plus cinnamon and diced a red apple into batter also used apple cider vinegar to make the butter milk. More than enough batter left over for next day pancakes!

These were good, but not great. The flavor was pleasant, but they were not as fluffy as I would have preferred. The Good Old Fashioned Pancakes recipe on this site is much better.

My pancakes didn't come out light or fluffy, they were actually a bit dense or cake like. Overall, not a bad recipe, but I'll keep looking for a pancake as good as Cracker Barrel's.

Very good!  I had some buttermilk left over from another recipe and was looking for something to use it for!  I'm glad I found this pancake recipe.  Great for Sunday mornings.  Light and fluffy, just as promised.  I halved the recipe and ended up throwing a little of the batter away.  We had made 8 good sized pancakes, so halving the recipe would give you 9 or 10 pancakes.

OH-yeah.  These are just what I was looking for.  Downhome taste and fluffy texture.  These are how "Mom's pancakes" should be made.  This is the first recipe I've used that resulted in pancakes with some substance and personality.

I am not a big pancake fan like the rest of my family; however, I have to admit that these were very tasty. We used fat free buttermilk and the recipe was still delicious.

Pancakes are my sons absolute favorite food, and he has now voted this recipe the BEST!  I have been searching for the perfect pancake recipe and I have finally found it.  They are a little extra work, but so worth while.  I separated the egg whites and beat them until stiff, folded wet ingredients in until just combined...you want the batter to still be lumpy.

A delightful recipe. I added bananas to mine, and chocolate chips to my friends'. It was a huge hit, and reducing the recipe by 1/3 was perfect for four people.

This recipe rocks!  I added a little extra milk to get the batter thinned to my liking, and added vanilla & cinammon because I always do in pancakes.  Also, I used raw sugar.  This was a big, big hit at our kid's sleepover Sunday morning breakfast!  Even the picky eaters came back for more.  Made about 1,000 3" pancakes.  OK, more like about 30 ...

I scaled this recipe to four and it still made plenty. I didn't change a thing. Next time I will probably thin the batter a little as this recipe makes the pancakes a little too thick for us. A keeper. Thanks for submitting.

These are the BEST pancakes I've ever had. They have so much flavor to them and they are so filling. One batch made 12 good sized cakes, which made two meals for my family. I would definately recommend this to anyone.

Best pancakes ever.  I substituted splenda for sugar, and rice milk for milk, because that's what I had on hand, and it turned out just fine.  If you have leftovers and want to eat them during the week, just put them in a ziploc bag in the fridge, and pop them into the toaster when you're ready to eat.

These are fabulous!  I usually make pancakes with ooil instead of butter, and i never grease the griddle.  I used the butter this time, but still used an ungreased griddle and they turned out just right and golden.  I also use regular milk with 1 tsp vinegar for every cup, instead of buttermilk.

I read the reviews and decided to split the white and yellow parts of the egg.  These pancackes were the fluffiest of all time, and my husband absolutely loved them.  I added real bluberries.  I made some with pecans, and some with cinnamon.
Great recipe.  Thank you.  My husband really was impressed and appreciative.  This was my first time making them from scratch.

Great pancakes. I seperated the eqqs and beat the
egg whites, then folded them in last. I also let
the mixture sit in the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking. Don't mix again before
cooking.

Really great pancakes.  A little eggy, yes, perhaps, but only very slightly.  Next time I will try 2 eggs instead, more baking powder, and less baking soda (you can taste it a little, which I don't like).

I have no idea what I did wrong - I'm usually a pretty good cook! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 3 cups of regular milk instead of the buttermilk and milk. The batter was WAY TOO runny - tried to make one pancake and it wouldn't even cook. So, I doubled the flour and they came out just like regular pancakes. Don't think I'll be keeping this recipe around...

This was a superb recipe.  My boyfriend and I both agreed that it was better than our mothers' recipes for pancakes.  They were thicker because of the buttermilk and not dry at all.

Those who claim this is not a good recipe probably did not make it right or use the buttermilk.

Best pancakes I've ever had!!!! I made it exactly like recipe said and they were perfect. Was sweet enough, especially with syrup. I left the batter really lumpy and it rose perfectly (also let all ingredients come to room temp, including melted butter).

Thanks for sharing this - it is the BEST!  FYI - I only had 1 cup of fresh buttermilk, so I substituted the remainder with powdered buttermilk (the kind you use for baking) & water without any problems.  This made plenty for my family (of 4) with enough to freeze for hurried mornings!

I couldn't even eat these pancakes.  I halved the recipe and used two eggs as opposed to 1 and 1/2.  These were way too eggy.  I highly doubt that one half egg extra dispersed throughout 20 medium sized pancakse makes a world of difference, making me believe that if I had followed this recipe exactly without halfing it it would still taste WAY too eggy.  They took a while to cook too, and although they looked really nice, after a taste all of that work went uneaten.  It's getting 2 stars since I halved the recipe and maybe that's what messed it up, but I doubt it.  I make pancakes all the time with no problem and should have stuck to my traditional recipe.

Perfect Pancakes! Highly recommend them.

Try with blueberries and whipped cream for an extra special treat :)

These pancakes are absolutely the BEST.  I halved the recipe so it wouldn't make so many.  They came out golden brown, fat, fluffy and delicious.  Yum!

I just made it this morning and it was excellent.  I am very picky about my pancakes and this is THE best batch I have ever made.  It was VERY fluffy and soft.  Some reviewers felt that it too thick and not airy enough, my suggestion is to NOT overblend the batter.  Leave the batter lumpy will make fluffy pancakes.

These are excellent pancakes! What makes these super great, besides the taste, is that they cook quickly and perfecly every time. If you try and cook a bisquick pancake quickly it will be heavy in texture, not these they're light as a feather.I can't believe I've been eating Bisquick pancakes all my life. This is my standard pancake recipe from here on out.

This is a great recipe, but I scaled it down to 4 servings for my 2 toddlers and altered it a little. For the small recipe I added 1 extra TBSP sugar, 3/4 tsp vanilla, and about 1/4-1/2 tsp orange peel. Besides having all ingredients at room temperature (which makes it fluffier!), I didn't use fresh buttermilk. I just added 1 TBSP of lemon juice to a measuring cup then filled it up to the 1 cup mark with regular milk and let it set for about 5 minutes. 1 Cup of instant buttermilk and it worked just fine in the recipe.

After reading the reviews, I was astonished that my family and I found this recipe to be heavy and eggish.  More like a crepe.  They liked it, but said the mixes I bought in the past were better.  I will try it again with less egg, milk and more salt and baking soda and possibly vanilla.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! Just great pancakes. For those living at high altitude, don't change the recipe at all. All you have to do is lower the heat. I lowered mine to the the third lowest setting and they came out perfect. Even cooking, light and fluffy. This is the best pancake recipe out there! Thanks.

Very good recipe.  Tasted just like the Village Inn's pancakes.  We used 2 T butter instead of the 1/3 c as suggested in your recipe and they came out good.  This is a great way to get rid of buttermilk!  I made coleslaw the other day and only needed 1/4 c so I had practically a qt of buttermilk left in the fridge.

The BEST pancakes. I would chose these over french toast (my ultimate favorite) anyday. As long as the baking soda and powder are w/i their expiration date, the pancakes will be very light and fluffy.  Mine were even a little moist! My roommate and I ate almost 2/3 of the recipe. I put the rest in the fridge, and toasted them in the toaster over for breakfast the next day. Just as good!

I was a die-hard Bisquick pancake supporter.  This recipe just surpassed Bisquick plus any other recipe I'd tried!!! These are the lightest,  fluffiest and best tasting pancakes I have ever tried.  The key is to gently blend the ingredients.  DO NOT OVERSTIR!

I am a huge pancake lover and I'm thrilled with this recipie!  They're better than most restaraunt pancakes and much tastier than the recipie in my Better Homes and Gardens cookbook.  They were easy to mix up and even reheated well the next day.  This is making a home in my recipie box.

These are good pancakes.  I will keep this one for my plain flavored pancakes. (I did add 1-1 1/2 tsp vanilla, yummy I have never heard of doing that before)  I still am going to try all the different varieties of flavored pancakes.  Also served this with syrup and cinnabutter (allrecipies.com recipie)

Great pancake recipe. They were the fluffiest pancakes I've ever made....hubby loved these....made way more than stated...I was surprised to see how much batter there was. I did cook them all and froze the rest for a quick, on the go breakfast. I will cut the recipe in half next time.

I had some extra buttermilk I wanted to use up, so I thought I would try making these instead of using my regular pancake mix.  They were amazing!  Worth the tiny bit of extra effort.

Since I discovered this recipe, these are the only pancakes I make.  My kids love them. I even made these while camping and they are delicious cold.

Super!  The first time I made this was for visiting relatives.  I was really hoping it would turn out, and did it ever!  Hubby says they're the best he's ever had...including IHOP'S!  Thanks!

I just made these, so that I could try my maple syrup that took me two days to make a pint. I usually make hockey pucks when I try pancakes but these came out good. Its the thickest batter I have ever used. Way more batter than I could have ever hoped to use in one day or probably 2, there is just two of us. I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted 2 cups sour cream (I had a 3lb tub I bought at Costco that I needed to get rid of).  Will definitely keep this recipe.

I made these Christmas morning for the family and they were wonderful - very light and fluffy. I made them exactly as the recipe called and they turned out perfect. I used low fat buttermilk without a problem.

this is ecvellent but for 3 people I only use a cup of flour,  cup of buttermilk (very IMPORTANT to use cultured buttermilk (NOT LOW FAT) and one egg, one teas of baking soda and one eggand 4 tbs of melted butter..  I just throw everything in at once and then whisk and on the griddle.  I used this recipe today and fotgo to add the melted butter and with the FULL STRENGTH buttermilk it was just as delicious!

I wouldn't call these pancakes light and fluffy. They were actually kind of dense, but they tasted great! I added a little vanilla and my sister and boyfriend loved them! Whipped egg whites like someone reccommended might help. But overall, delicious! Won't be using the box anymore.

Followed exactly, except cut in half, using the two smallest X-large eggs in the carton (1 1/2 large would be half)  You also have to know how to halve three tbsp and three tsp as well as 1 1/2 tsp.  However, these were the best fluffy pancakes I have ever made or had out.  I did butter and syrup them, but regardless, they are super good.

I was just glancing through for an easy & tasty way to burn through my leftover buttermilk in the fridge & had tried a few different pancakes that were... okay. These one's here hit the mark though!! Super fluffy & rich, they're just like the one's we get at Perkins resto!! They're like lil' sponges for the syrup... we did add 1/2 a tsp to the recipe because we like an underlyiing sweetness to our pancakes as is without the syrups but either way they-re pretty  amazing on their own! Thanks for such an awesome recipes guys!

Rave reviews from family!  I mixed in a quarter-cup of quartered walnuts.  A nonstick-pan on medium heat worked better than Grandmother’s iron skillet on high.  (The latter resulted in burning.)  This recipe really does make 12 generous servings.

I rarely eat pancakes but I had extra buttermilk on hand so I found this recipe on good old Allrecipes. Very good- not too rich, not too sweet. I'm saving it for the next time I want to make pancakes. I personally like a little brown sugar on top instead of maple syrup.

Cut down the butter to 2 tbsp (little bit less than half than what it calls for).    Used whole 3.25% fat buttermilk

Christmas morning breakfast and it was great!  Like many others said, let the liquid items come to room temp to get really fluffy pancakes. They came out so well I may make a double batch and freeze them as a quick breakfast on school mornings.  This recipe is a keeper For sure!

I cut the recipe to 8 servings. still plenty for a big crowd. use a 1/4 cup for each pancake. Batter way too thick, so I added more milk for a better spread factor. good taste.

We make these once a month. I double the batch and freeze them, so yummy. 

I have 4 boys so I've made these with sausage bits in them, giant sprinkles for birthday cake pancakes, blueberries, cranberries. Oh you can put almost anything in there! *

*Be sure if you mix 'anything' in utilize smaller bits, it will not cook through with big lumpy things in it.

I substituted heavy whipping cream for milk, but kept everything else the same. Don't overmix the batter, leave it a little bit Lumpy. Add a bunch of butter to the skillet and let it melt then pour the pancake batter right in the middle. The pancakes turned out fluffy, crispy from the butter on the edges and absolutely fabulous! I totally recommend making them.

I added blueberries this time. Loved that! I did use regular butter milk this time. They were a little better with the thick fresh buttermilk but still excellent! :-)

Recipe wasn't overly fluffy, but the taste was great. It makes a huge amount of batter. I think if I make it again, I'll try to cut the amounts by a third.

Just made this for breakfast with my homemade buttermilk. These were the fluffiest pancakes I’ve had and it was so yummy!!! I ended up having to use half whole wheat flour and half regular flour because I ran out of regular but it still came out so great! Definitely saving this recipe for the future!

Best pancake recipe I’ve tried. Takes a while bc I truly follow the recipe ...like making sure my butter has cooked to prevent the eggs from cooking. Anyways always a hit at home. Will be my pancake recipe for life.

Great tasting recipe. I made a mistake and added 2 t. baking powder, so I eliminated the soda.  Still turned out great!  Softer than regular pancakes, and browned up beautifully!  Delicious.

I love this recipe. I used to make buttermilk pancakes years ago, but have not done it for ages. I looked up this recipe and it looked similar. It did turn out very thick, I ended up adding another cup of buttermilk, using all I had. I still had to add more milk. But....they were yummy!! Huge batch, but we were having a family dinner, so it was fine. I think when I do them again, I will start with a cup less flour and add more if needed. My whole family LOVED our breakfast dinner.

I thought this was a great recipe. I took the advice of several others and let the wet ingredients sit to room temperature. I still thought the batter was too thick so I thinned it a little with extra buttermilk. I also added vanilla.

I made these this morning. I followed the recipe exactly. I measured out the batter at one quarter of a cup per pancake before pouring on skillet. The recipe does make quite a bit. I used all the batter up and layered the cooked extra cakes between wax paper and put them in a freezer bag and froze them for a busy week day morning. Great recipe. Very good flavor and texture. Will use recipe again.

Followed the recipe to a T. I have never made buttermilk pancakes before.  My husband, my kids and I loved them! We like these better than my normal homemade pancakes.  This recipe is a keeper! Thank you so much for sharing!!

Anyone who complains about this recipe for any reason, either didn’t follow it correctly or just flat out doesn’t know what a traditional American pancake is supposed to be like. These are mom’s fluffy pancakes that I grew up with. I always let the milks get to room temp before I make them. Absolute perfection!

These are wonderful! However the batter was so thick they took forever to cook and were huge! I added an extra 3/4 cup milk and they came out perfect. Enough to feed a crowd!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now.  I find that real buttermilk (as opposed to milk and lemon/vinegar) works better  Definitely add vanilla for added flavor.

My husband and I were never pancake fans but in the last couple of years that has changed. These came out amazingly fluffy and delicious. I was reading how some other reviews said they were watery - I’d make sure that you measured correctly and used the exact ingredients. The biggest tip - DO NOT STIR the dry and wet ingredients together; fold them in just enough to get everything wet and then let sit while griddle heats. Amazing!  I made a blueberry sauce from Allrecipes to top them and oh my gosh!!  Thank you for sharing.

Easy to make. They came out delicious. The recipe, as published, made 24 pancakes.  I froze them in packs of 4 for future use.

Delicious! I love these pancakes, and I don't normally like pancakes. I would say they're more light & eggy (like a crepe, I think that's why I like them so much)  YOU CANNOT OMIT THE BUTTERMILK but if you don't have  any on hand you can MAKE YOUR OWN: 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinager per 1 cup of milk, let sit 5min and there you go.

A nice thick fluffy pancake. It does make a large quantity, but leftovers can easily be stored in the freezer for another day.

I did make this exactly as weitren. And followed the advice of someone about letting the batter rest if you want it really fluffy. Came out great. Thanks for this perfection.

You will not be disappointed, but do let milk and eggs rest at least 1 hour before adding to dry and don’t over mix.
I make several batches and freeze. You can enjoy anytime not just weekends.

Superb!  I had some extra buttermilk on hand and found this recipe.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The pancakes were delicious! Best ever!   I added a few blueberries to each pancake  as the batter was put onto the griddle.

I was looking for a recipe that mimicked this pancake house I once went to and THIS IS IT.  After seeing the 2k plus reviews and that over 5k have made this I knew it had to be good.  I reduced the recipe to a third and used all the correct ingredients except I exchanged sugar for brown sugar (it's all I had)...came out amazing.  This is a keeper.  It was tempting to mix more but I just gently folded until the flour wasn't apparent (I left the bumps in) and it was perfect.  I think next time I will add vanilla but more than happy with this.

Best. Pancakes. Ever.  I have tried any and all pancake recipes I could find; until I came across this one.  It looked a little overwhelming with a large quantity of ingredients but I decided to give it a go due to it using buttermilk.  A last ditch effort to see if buttermilk was the secret ingredient.  I LOVE these pancakes, and here’s why:  They taste amazing, the recipe yields twelve large pancakes,  they freeze well and only take a minute to heat from frozen in the microwave.  When I make a batch at the weekend, we have leftovers for the week.  Unless, of course we have company (it’s usually just the two of us); then I look like an amazing cook :)

So yummy. Yes, light and fluffy. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Will never use box mix again.  I added a half teaspoon of vanilla mainly because I have a lot on hand from Mexico.

Delicious ! Left out eggs and butter and salt by accident and they were excellent. 
Made buttermilk with milk and lemon juice- 1 tablespoon of lemon.

Good if you don't know what pancakes are.  Very thick and fluffy. Didn't dance on its own, needed the accessories of butter and syrup.

These pancakes are very good. They taste like buttermilk and I like to cook them in butter so they are extra delicious. I am a single person so I only make 1/3 of the batch and it turns out fine. I freeze the rest of my buttermilk and one cup increments so that when I want some pancakes I can just get the buttermilk out of the freezer and make some pancakes. Yum!

I would say that these are the best pancakes I've ever made. Make sure you don't over mix the batter. It's okay to have some small dry lumps in the batter. I didn't change a thing, but I may try adding some ripened smashed bananas or some fresh blueberries next time. Hope you enjoy! Remember, if you're not cooking with Wingman, you may not be cooking at all! Cheers!

Delicious! Cut the recipe in half and added 1 tsp vanilla as another reviewer suggested. They cooked up nice and fluffy and delicious!

This makes a very thick batter, which I don’t mind. The first bite was good but the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it. Family wasn’t impressed.

Wonderful flavor and fluffiness! I added a healthy squirt of lemon juice and some vanilla, and, after I put the batter on the griddle, I top them with different ingredients, such as blueberries, chocolate chips, nuts, or Fruity Pebbles. Yummy!!

I don't like pancakes but these - WOW! I have to admit I had to substitute about 1/2 cup of buttermilk (I ran short) with vanilla greek yogurt and added a tablespoon of  vanilla extract. Everyone loved them, even me.

We make a lot of pancakes but always from a bag or box.  I tried this recipe for the first time, made exactly as written.  The pancakes were light, fluffy and flavorful.  I think it is a great recipe.

I think this is the first recipe I ever saved when I joined AllRecipes many moons ago.  And, probably my all time favorite.  It's committed to memory now but I see it on my history all the time and thought it was high time to say "hats off" to the author.  These pancakes are a staple in my kitchen.  Thanks for contributing this recipe.

I have made this pancake recipe , as written, several times.  Now I just make 2/3 of a recipe which yields about 12-13 pancakes (1/3 c batter per cake).  Also, I found that I can substitute oil for the butter to simplify prep.  These pancakes are better than any other recipe I have tried and better than those I have had eating out.   For 2/3's recipe use 1 pint (2c) buttermilk,  6 Tbsp milk, 3 1/2 Tbsp oil,   2 eggs, dash vanilla and mix together.  Dry ingredients: 2 c flour, 2 Tbsp Sugar, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp b. soda, 1/2 tsp salt.  Mix the dry ingredients ahead so you can whip these up in no time at all.

These are my new favorite. These pancakes turn out fluffy and the flavor is mildly sweet and oh so buttery. I absolutely love these pancakes and now I even crave them at a treat. 

Do not worry about the lumpy bumpy texture of the batter. Waiting until the last minute to mix is important... so if you have extra batter use it up. Better to save and reheat the tasty pancakes. They just don't cook well the next day. You will end up with super thin odd shaped cakes if you try to save it overnight. (but they'll still taste good...)

My family loved them. Although the recipe is too large for my small family. I cut it down by a third and added 1/4 tsp of vanilla.  they could not believe the difference in my pancakes. The secret  of keeping liquid and solid apart really made the difference!!!

This is an amazing recipe!  I used vegetable oil instead of butter, and they still turned out buttery and delicious.  

One tip regarding the buttermilk:  buy a quart of it, use 3 cups of it for this recipe, then refill the quart container with more milk and shake well.  Allow to sit out for 8-12 hours, shaking occasionally, then refrigerate.  This gives you another whole quart of buttermilk!  Use within about 2 weeks, and, when you do use it, repeat the process!  You'll have infinite buttermilk!

My husband is a pancake aficionado and I have been on a quest to find a pancake that he raves over. I've tried many wonderful pancake recipes on this site including some that he has complimented, but this is the recipe that beat out all the others with his rave reviews. The pancake is soft, tender, and fluffy. The flavor of the buttermilk is subtle and doesn't overpower the butter and syrup. I'm way too lazy to mix two different bowls with wet and dry ingredients. Instead, I mixed the wet ingredients, then added in all the dry ingredients except the baking powder and baking soda, mixing well. When my grill was hot and I was ready to start cooking, I added the baking powder and baking soda and blended it in well. They came out absolutely perfect. Thank you for a great recipe!

Great recipe and I gave I t five stars with one disclaimer. Don’t add the butter! I have made this recipe a few times  now and trust me when I tell you there is enough butter in the buttermilk. Add blueberries and bananas and they can’t be beat.

We loved these delicious pancakes!  They are light and fluffy, and go together quickly and easily.  I cut the recipe down and made 2/3 batch.  Using the 1/2 measure stated, I got (10) 5" pancakes.  I served them topped with fresh blueberry sauce...delicious!  **Made for Alphabet Tag**

Good solid recipe. My 16-year old son gave it 5 stars. Not sure what could be improved upon, but can't help feeling it could be a little better to get to 5.

I made these exactly as shown, they are delicious.  I split the batter and added blueberries to half.  I took one rafters advice and took the eggs, milk and butter out of the fridge 1 hour ahead.

My new buttermilk pancake King of the hill! Fresh ingredients, real buttermilk, and blending dry with wet at last minute, leaving the all-important lumps, will get you fluffy delicious pancakes that melt in your mouth.  I have found no better and I’ve made a lot of pancakes!

My favorite pancakes ever!  I now make these as my preferred recipe. The leftovers freeze beautifully too (good because the recipe makes a TON)!  I make exactly as the recipe. Delicious!!!!  Fluffiest cakes I have ever made.

These were excellent. I added some vanilla and pumpkin pie spice - and then some fresh blueberries and pecans. But the basic pancake was light and moist and def a keeper recipe.

I am so glad that I made these for my family this Sunday morning and they were a hit.  I finally sat down to eat my plate of buttermilk pancakes, now I will make these pancakes at least 3 or 4 times per month.  They are very good!!!

WE LOVED THESE PANCAKES !!!!! The perfect recipe to make just as it is written, but can adjust the amount easily because the measurements are easily divided by 3. I made a 2/3 recipe this morning because of our small family. Thank you for submitting this recipe. It was a real winner with our family.

These are my go-to pancakes! Fluffy and light, and delicious even without maple syrup. They are better than anything I've ever had at a restaurant. I took the advice of another reviewer and left the buttermilk, milk and eggs out for one hour before making the mix. Otherwise no changes!

Best pancakes I ever had or made.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, and the only thing I did different was add a TBLS of vanilla.  They were super thick and fluffy.  Definitely my go-to pancake recipe from here on out!  Thanks!

 I freeze any extra's on cookie sheets and then once frozen, I put them in a ziplock.  They reheat nicely.

I thought I had reviewed this before but apparently not. These are simple, fluffy, and delicious. I’ve made them twice this week because I bought too much buttermilk the first time. Both times my wife said “they’re so fluffy”. The recipe makes around a dozen so depending on how many you need or if you enjoy leftovers adjust the recipe accordingly.

I did everything in this recipe and changed the buttermilk to regular 2% milk as my buttermilk in the fridge had turned before its expiry date. It still turned out amazingly well. The trick is to not over stir the batter!

These seemed a little bland for us so I added 2 tsp. Vanilla flavoring, 1 heaping TBS. white sugar, and 1 tsp. Pure maple syrup. I also discovered that they seemed fluffier and more consistent after the batter had been left to sit for about 30 minutes.

I love breakfast and especially pancakes.  A while after my mom died when I was a kid, my dad began dating a woman who lived about a mile away.  When she found out I loved pancakes, she offered to make me some if I made my way to her house.  I walked the mile one Saturday morning and was rewarded with delicious homemade pancakes!  They later married! :-) 

These pancakes were everything BuryGold said they'd be. They were fluffy and golden brown.  I didn't think pancakes with such simple ingredients could be so much better than those from a mix!  I think what helped greatly was not over-mixing and, of course, the rich buttermilk!  Thank you BuryGold for giving me the chance to make a wonderful breakfast for my family and to recollect a happy childhood memory!

I followed this recipe to a T & theses pancakes were delicious. I made these for dinner for my husband and myself & we both  overstuffed ourselves. I had plenty of leftover batter so I  put it  in the fridge and had them again for breakfast the next morning & they were even better.

Made the recipe as listed. I mixed both ingredients mixes together at the end and let it rest while getting the pan ready. They turned out perfect and fluffy. A recipe worth saving.

I don't usually rate as I'm not the best cook, but these were the best pancakes I've ever made! Used the suggestion to let eggs & milk warm to room temp. Yay!

I was pleased with the results. I will add more butter to the receipt next time and reduce the recipe to four servings. Anybody want some pancakes?  I have plenty to go around :)

Such good pancakes!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. I think being sure not to overmix and dont mix until you are ready to cook is important.

This is by far the best recipe for buttermilk pancakes. I am again making it this morning for my monthly Sunday breakfast for my grands and great grands. In addition to maple syrup, I again have made the blueberry sauce from this site from Isybel. On the side, bacon and maple sausage links.

Good tasting pancakes, but I found the batter was a bit runny, which made my pancakes flat. I added about a 3/4 cup more flour to the batter and the batter had a much better consistency. Otherwise  a good recipe!

This recipe was pretty good. Not to heavy or lite. A solid pancake with just enough fluff to it. I didn’t have butter milk so just used sour milk, still was great. Not my favorite pancakes ever but they worked. Makes a ton!

I have made many pancake recipes and decided to adventure off of my favorite one and tried this one. These pancakes to me had 0 flavor and I even added vanilla extract as an extra like I usually do to my pancake batters. Plus the pancakes did not come out fluffy at all like the other recipe I use. Fluffiness in pancakes to me is the whole presentation and there was literally no fluff and came out as flat as a board. Will not be making again due to lack of flavor.

I used 8 tablespoons of butter instead of 5. I also accidentally used 3.5 tablespoons of baking powder instead of teaspoons. They were still my favorite pancakes to date and I will definitely be keeping this recipe. I also le the batter sit for 30 minutes prior to cooking even though the recipe said to cook immediately after mixing the dry and wet ingredients.

Last, this recipemakes a lot of pancakes. Most families will probably want to make a half batch.

excellent pancakes, not overly fluffy but not overly flat. Not sure if the recipe should say they are fluffy pancakes!?Other than a pinch or two of cinnamon I didn't make any changes. Well I actually added about a teaspoon too much baking soda which I would think would make the pancakes fluffier and more cakey...I don't like those kind, but it did not seem to have any effect.

The batter was a little too thick so I added an extra egg and maybe 1/4 cup of milk ...I love this recipe.  For the kids - I added chocolate chips for the chocolate chip lovers!

This is my go-to pancake recipe.   If I make 1/3 the recipe it yields two very large 8" pancakes.  I often make 2/3 the recipe and freeze the extra pancakes for another day.  That's enough for several breakfasts in my house.   Light and fluffy.   Your griddle needs to be hot enough that water splashed on rolls around and disappears in a second.  And don't overmix the batter.   I throw the wet ingredients into the dry and stir lightly with a fork just until you can't see any loose dry ingredients.  It  will look thick and lumpy.

Best ever! 
The only thing I did different was add 2 tsp vanilla. I followed the mixing directions and barely combined the ingredients. It looked like a lumpy mess, but once cooked they were delicious! Light and fluffy and my family loved them.

Light, fluffy and delicious!  I used powdered buttermilk and added water to make it liquid before adding to liquid mix. Worked better than when I add powder to to the powdered side and water to water side. I also reduced water and made it up with milk for richer flavor.

Fantastic!!!! Easy to make and tastes way better than the box mixes. I added 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, an extra teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. I also let the wet mixture sit out for an hour before combing- per another reviewers recommendation. These were just as good as any restaurant pancakes. Definitely our go to recipe.

It needs to be thicker and more fluffy. The taste was quite bland and needs to be sweeter. I would recommend to revise this recipe and to those now look at a different recipe.

Pancakes turned out good, but the batter was a tad bit too gooey and the pancakes ended up very flat but overall, really tasty and I would make it again to try and modify it a little bit.

I would suggest adding some vanilla extract at the end. Only a few tablespoons depending on your taste.
I also did not have buttermilk, so  I used regular milk with either white vinegar or lemon juice added in.

1 Cup of Milk -  1 Tablespoon of White Vinegar/Lemon Juice

What to do with a 1/2 gallon of buttermilk?  Make these pancakes!  It's my first time making them and I always follow the recipe to the T- and it's very good.  Caution, it makes a lot, and you might have leftovers, and that's always a good thing.   This will be my goto recipe from now on.

I stuck to the recipe and made them twice just to make sure I hadn't done anything wrong the first time, but I have to say I was really disappointed with these pancakes. Very eggy. I will need to read the reviews and see what modifications people made, but as is, these are not the best.

I've made pretty much every buttermilk pancake recipe under the sun and THIS is the best one. Everyone in the family loves it and they reheat well too! As a side note, for those trying to make it more vegan, 1/4 applesauce for each egg and coconut milk (in place of the 1/2 cup milk) works great!

This recipe is phenomenal!

Okay, I have a LOT of homemade kefir to use up, which is basically cultured sour milk. Kind of like buttermilk. It's thickish and slightly tart/sour so I used my homemade kefir for this recipe instead of bought buttermilk. 

I also used self raising flour and omitted the baking powder. I live in Australia so using self raising flour is fine. 

I will say that there is a top review that says to leave little lumps of flour in the mix and they'll break open on the pan. Well, they do and they don't. I didn't overmix, so some lumps remained in the actual pancake and when it was cut in half, a small lump of flour was still there. So you want to mix it to make sure most obvious lumps are gone but leave some. 

The finished product looks like an awesome fluffy version of McDonald's hotcakes. A real keeper to use with kefir. 

I made two batches and froze them in lots of three, so my kids could heat them in the microwave for breakfast on days when I go to work early.

We loved this recipe.  It is easy and so fluffy and delicious.  It will be my standard.  The buttermilk makes the difference.  Add blueberries too if you like.  As you’re cooking the pancakes, drop 4-5 blueberries on each pancake while on the griddle.

I wanted to  use my leftover buttermilk and found this pancake recipe .. nice taste .. very thick .. added more milk to thin out.. I also added vanilla (1/1/2 Teaspoon) should of read the reviews first as I found out that they brown fast due to the buttermilk.. I may have to go buy a griddle so they do not cook so fast on the outside,, I used my reg frypan on med heat  that I use for my own pancake recipe and always come out cooked the why I like.. will try them again when I get the griddle and if this does not please me I will go back to my old pancake  mix that I used for the past 50 years

I couldn’t find my usual recipe so tried this. Followed the directions but my batter quickly became soupy and pancakes were hard to keep shape. Also way more than anticipated, so took much longer to cook. Don’t think I’ll make again.

I have made these several times and followed the recipe exactly with the exception of occasionally adding mini chips or blueberries. These come out perfect every time. Anyone having issues with them being too thin are either not measuring correctly or over mixing. The batter should be lumpy. I will say that it does make ALOT.

Excellent recipe, very much the same as Alton Brown's, one of my favorites. I did spice it up a bit with vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon. I also added blueberries to some, chocolate chips to some. The blueberry ones were the ones I ate, myself, and they were so good, I forgot to put syrup on!

Took suggestions and added tsp vanilla, also added an extra egg. I did let the ingredients come to room temp. D-licious... new go to. PS- let the batter rest a few minutes, it will get thicker if it looks runny at first. Also it made like a dozen or more 8 inch pancakes

Not the best pancake I've ever cooked or eaten. They are not horrible, but they are nothing special. Mine were pretty flat and bland. They do make a lot though!

We substitute 1/3 of flour for quick cook rolled oats. We also didn't have buttermilk and mixed about 1/8 c Vinegar into the milk - in place of 1/8C milk.

I bake often, and I must say this recipe turned out pretty bad. I did use a 'similar' substitute fur buttermilk since I didn't have any (milk with vinegar). These were dense, eggy, and almost doey after cooking. No real flavor. Definitely didn't seem like pancakes, maybe closer to the flavor of a crepe but thicker. Not making again.

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this recipe. These were the worst pancakes ever.  They were so thick because of all the buttermilk they took forever to cook and they tasted horrible. I would definitely  scale back this recipe. I’ve made better pancakes On this site.

Wonderful!  Fluffy and crispy if cooked properly.  I wouldn't alter a thing.

Note:  The recipe makes a ton of pancakes!  I mean 20 pancakes using 1/3 cup batter each.  I suggest going with 2/3 of the called for amounts, or be ready to freeze some of these for school days.

They turned out the best out of all the recipes I have tried for pancakes.  I didn't have buttermilk so I just used milk and added some lime/lemon juice and a tad of real yogurt to make up for it.  I used 1/2 sprouted spelt flour to make them healthier.

Although these produced a nice fluffy pancake, I found them way too rich and heavy. I wouldn't make them again.

These were simply awesome and by far the best pancakes I've ever had! I didn't even use "real" butter milk but created my own adding white vinegar to 2% milk and it was perfect.  I'll never go back to boxed pancake mix again. So worth the extra effort. I made the entire recipe, and still had half of the batter left over. I'm freezing it for a future breakfast. Not sure if it freezes well, but we'll see!

Very delicious, but what a big batch! I usually have to double a recipe, but not this one. I did add some vanilla, which always makes pancakes better, but otherwise, this was perfect.

Super eggy, which gives them good flavor but makes them feel a little wet and squishy. I'll try a different recipe next time.

My family loves these!! I added 1.5 TB of vanilla and it added a really nice flavor. To add chocolate chips or blueberries or whatever extra you want, coat in flour then add to batter; it keeps them from falling all the way to the bottom of the batter. Very delicious, and very easy!! Make your own buttermilk if you don’t have any on hand: 1 TB of lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup of milk and let stand 5 minutes. Perfection!

These are awesome pancakes.  There are always extras and I save them for school days. Just make sure to store each layer between wax paper or they'll stick. Only change I have made is to add vanilla. Thank you!

A perfect pancake! I had to make my own buttermilk by adding 1.5 tbsp of white vinegar and waiting 5 mins for it to curdle.  I cut the recipe by 1/3 so it was 1 cup flour and that was enough for our family of 3.

When I was in High School I worked for IHOP. I know how to cook from a mix. I used to use off the counter pancake mix and substitute buttermilk plus a lil extra for whole milk, 
I decided to try this recipe.I cut the recipe in half, used 2 jumbo eggs and 1 1/2 + 3/4 cups buttermilk no whole milk, turned out great made 12 ±5" light fluffy pancakes. I think next time I will add a little vanilla extract. For the idiots that cannot cook, when  something is burnt on the outside & undercooked inside you are cooking with your pan  too hot, try this old fashioned remedy, turn the heat down a little, it will take a lil longer to cook, but it will cook through.

OMG I've cooked 1,000,s of different pancakes (my kids will attest to that) and my wife is not a pancake fan, so I made this recipe completely as is, then made waffles out of it. They were the best, light and flavourful waffle we've ever eaten. Thank you Burygold Bar-B-Q-Bob.  We will be making again.

Made these for Thanksgiving Day brunch. Delicious, fluffy and foolproof. Batter was very thick. Cooked a batch as is, then added more milk for subsequent batches. Pancakes were great either way!

I made these this morning for my kiddos.  It was a huge hit.  Everyone was say how sweet and soft these were.  I also liked that I didn't have to make a double batch this recipe to have enough to feed my family of 5.  Everyone had seconds and one kiddo even took some to school for lunch.

I  Didn’t have enough flour to make this recipe so I halved it, and I’m very glad I did so.  It was enough pancakes for a small army.  They were good but not spectacular like I was expecting. They were not fluffy enough and because i was so scared to stir the dough too much i had tons of lumps which left bits of flour throughout some pancakes.  The flavor was ok. It just tasted like any other box pancakes to me.  I may try again and add vanilla or banana or both.

This recipe makes a lot, will half next time as there are only two of us. The pancake batter is very thick, resulting in high light scrumptious pancakes, this is a keeper. Topped with lemon curd and berries.

I used the Indian style buttermilk, made from dahi. They came out awesome. Very mildly sweet. I used atta or whole wheat unbleached natural wheat flour. I had to add some milk to adjust consistency
Definitely will make again

These are the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever eaten. I can't believe I make them right in my very own kitchen.   It took me a few times to get the temperature right with my griddle, but once I did, they were cooked to perfection.  I tell everyone who loves pancakes about this recipe.

I made these pancakes and I was not impressed. They were extremely flat and lacked flavor, but I am going to try it again because I could have made some wrong measurements, so I don’t want to completely blame the recipe. I will update my review when I make it again.

These are the best pancakes I have ever had or made.  The fresh buttermilk is key.  If you don't have it and substitute regular milk, they are just not as good.  The recipe is easy to adjust for more or less.

These were terrible. My kids wouldn't eat them. They were thin, rubbery, and wet! So disappointed. Should've used the other pancake recipe on here that has about 24k reviews...just thought I'd give this a try. What a waste of milk and eggs.

My husband loved it and gave it 5 stars. He didn't even put syrup on it, that's how good it is. I used coconut sugar. Also, for the 6 servings I was going to cook, instead of 1.5 eggs, I used 1 egg and 1/2 a flax egg. I also used the vinegar/milk method to make buttermilk (1 Tb of vinegar in each 1 cup of milk and let sit for 5 minutes) It's been comical around here how I've managed to mess up pancakes since I always try to make healthy ones with pumpkin or zucchini. Finally I just said "I promise I'll make you regular pancakes today."

They had good flavor and were quite fluffy.  However, I thought that they were too holey.  I'm going to keep looking for a combination that is fluffy, but still has an intact smooth surface.

Finally, a pancake recipe that makes perfect (in our opinion) pancakes worthy of any pancake house, but easily made at home.  I made 6 servings and since I didn't want to use part of an egg, I used 2 lg. eggs.  I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose, and used 6 tbl. powdered buttermilk to 1 1/2 cup of water, whisked and added to the liquid ingredients.   Also added some cinnamon and a couple squeezes of agave nectar and maple syrup to the liquid ingredients.  They came out wonderful! I thought the batter might be too thin, but my hubby and I like our pancakes on the thin side, and these were just right.  Made a ton of batter, enough for two, plus several that I cooked up and stored in the fridge.  I like mine with syrup and  completely covered with cinnamon (YUM).  My husband has in the past rated my homemade pancakes as "okay" or "so-so."  These he really liked, ("really good!") served with breakfast link sausages.  This will be my go-to pancake recipe from now on.  Thank you for posting this!

I made 1/3 of the recipe which was super simple.  These are the best pancakes I've ever had. At first I thought the batter was too thick but then realized that it was puffy. They are light, fluffy and delicious!

As the others suggested, I added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the batter - it was so good! My daughter who normally doesn't like pancakes finished hers and asked for more. It was light, soft and fluffy. No need to add maple syrup, it was that good. Definitely a keeper!

I love pancakes and make mostly the "normal" (big and not fluffy) variety because I'm German and live in Spain, we eat different ones :-). .

But this pancakes have change my mind: they are the BEST!

Savory (due to the buttermilk), fluffy (baking powder and bicarb) and very quick to make.


Normally I let them stand for 30 minutes but for this ones the dry and wet  ingredients are  mixed at the last moment just before frying. 

And even so they are thicker they back very quickly.

I think we will have pancakes this week again lol.
Maybe this time with some herbs thrown in and a savory topping.... hmmmmm, can't wait :-)))).

Thank you  Burygold for sharing your recipe :-).

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out fabulous.  Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and very filling.  So easy to make.  Definitely will make again!  But maybe next time I'll fry them in bacon grease!!

I love this recipe and so does my family but I don't think that the time estimation is accurate.  For me, it takes quite a wile longer even without clean-up.

This is the best buttermilk pancake recipe I've tried, as it has more flavor than others.

You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  I have made it twice and scaled down the recipe to half and it still made 9 pancakes about 4-5 inches in diameter.   I used the EXACT recipe but added 1 teaspoon of Lemon juice to the well mixed wet batter.  I read a review where the acid in the Lemon juice only makes them lighter in combination with the other ingredients. and you cannot taste the lemon juice.  Don't over-mix the batter when you add the wet to the dry.  Let it sit 15-20 minutes before  frying the pancakes.  The prepared mix will be full of bubbles prior to cooking.  I used the back of my ladle to smooth the pancakes out to make them thinner on my griddle.

The women in my family have made pancakes this way for ever! The one thing we do different is:  add bacon grease to the batter and on the griddle......instead of butter. Then butter the pancake on your plate if you want to before adding syrup.  'Box' pancakes.... heaven forbid!!!  Scratch is the only way to go!

I followed this recipe exactly and they were not good.  They were thin and gummy on the inside.  The flavor was ok, but nothing great. won't be making these again.

Excellent and fluffy! I halved the recipe and added 1.5 smashed bananas. I used 1 egg since you can't half an egg. Amazing! Great with peanut butter!

I made these for our "breakfast supper".  This is the first time I made good pancakes.  They were rather dense (afraid I over mixed a touch) but they were not thin, puny pancakes like I usually have.  I will try the room temperature trick and less mixing next time to get more fluff and less density.  My husband really likes them and so do I!!!

I will definitely be making these delicious pancakes again! I am pleased that it turned out so fluffy. I added vanilla extract to enhance the flavour. Do note that the batter can easily cook more than 12 servings than stated.

I've made this several times and it beats the pants off pancake mix. Light & fluffy, these pancakes don't sit heavy in the belly after the meal. I use milk & vinegar to create buttermilk every time and it works great. The recipe does make a heaping pile of flapjacks. The last few times I have frozen the leftovers in bags of 3 for a quick morning meal. Like Eggos, but homemade! Stick them in the micro for a minute and go.  I love this recipe and won't ever make another.

I live alone so I divided recipe by 1/3.  It was still enough for 2 people.  The lightest fluffiest pancakes I have ever made!  Will never use boxed mix again.  Very easy and tasty!  The batter is rather thick  and I was afraid it wouldn't cook completely but I was wrong, cooked perfectly!  Used 1/2 cup measurements and made the perfect size.  Definitely a keeper!

These are the best pancakes I've ever eaten. The only addition I made was a tad bit of vanilla extract. I love these pancakes more than those at Ihops, and those used to be my favs! Now I no longer have to miss Ihop pancakes whilst living abroad.

I did only make half a batch and glad I did as it would have made way to much for 2 people. I did add 1 t. vanilla, 1/4 cup cooking oil instead of melted butter. They came out perfect and I didn't even have ingredients room temperature. I made sure not to over mix so used a spatula and folded the wet ingred. into the dry. Don't overheat grill. I let them cook slowly. Turning them to soon can make a mess. Easier to make small ones than large. Beautiful finish. We used homemade apple butter topped with whipped cream instead of syrup. Can't wait to try this when I have company. A keeper for sure.

I've made this recipe both with real buttermilk and substitute (1 TBSP white vinegar per 1 cup of milk), and it turns out great every single time. other than using buttlemilk substitute when there's no real buttermilk at home, I haven't modified anything else. I'd say it is the best pancake recipe I've made so far from AllRecipes.

Great recipe. I was surprised at the simplicity and very pleased with the outcome. Amazingly light and fluffy.  Did 2/3 of the ingredients and gave us a good amount for 4

Made these for the first time this morning, and I must say they are the best pancakes we've had! I added a half teaspoon of vanilla to the wet ingredients and made the pancakes 1/3 cup size instead of 1/2 cup because we like them smaller. So delicious! My husband loved them. :) This is a keeper, thank you so much for sharing!

Just so all of you know, DO NOT START WITH A LOT OF OIL, because it will make your pancakes very oily. Also, DO NOT TURN YOUR OVEN ON MEDIUM-HIGH, because it will turn out to burn, while still raw inside. If you just start on a medium-low heat, then your pancakes will actually cook on the inside. Otherwise, this isn't all that bad of a recipe, but it's not like especially good and unresistable.

PERFECT!  Added a tsp. of vanilla but did it exactly as written.  They made enough for a family of 6 and they hold slices of fruit while they cook.  The flavor was great and they were the perfect mix of 3/4 density and 1/4 fluff.  So glad I just happen to have buttermilk on hand to try these.  Also, I thought they cooked very evenly on the outside (cooked on lo).

Delicious! I'm not a pancake fan but I officially crave these! My fiancé lovesick them too! I make half the batter. Don't really. Have much left over after that. But mine were fluffy and moist. Really a great recipe. And yes it is best with fresh buttermilk as oppose to making it with vinegar. Still good but not as fluffy.  For those who felt them to be too thick, I made the buttermilk with 1cup of half and half  (remember I make half the recipe) and the rest of it with skim milk, good but not as fluffy.

Definitely light and fluffy but really lacking any flavor. I made to the exact recipe and did no modification. I ended up having to add vanilla to the batter to get so kind of flavor. Thanks for the posting though.

Needed a recipe to use up extra buttermilk I had and just proportionally reduced the other ingredients.  As they were cooking, my children said they were too thick.  As I continued to cook the rest of the batch, two of the kids came back and said they were actually pretty good.  I found them fluffy and did enjoy them myself.  I would use this recipe again.

Best pancake recipe! I didn't have buttermilk on hand, but I improvised by mixing apple cider vinegar with milk. My whole family gobbled these up, and we still have plenty leftover to freeze! After many failed recipe attempts, this recipe is my default pancake recipe!

Very fluffy! The recipe says 'combine' all ingredients: so I just mixed them briefly with a spatula. It was lumpy but the lumps did not appear in the cooked pancake.

I don't think the recipe says that it makes 12 pancakes but that it serves 12. However, although it makes a lot o pancakes, I also don't think it feeds 12 people. I've made these twice. The first time, I made 2/3 of the recipe and fed 3 adults. I didn't had maple syrup so I thought the pancakes need a bit of sugar ( I added 25-30g). Tonight, I had a sweet craving and made 1/3 of the recipe just for me :D but it would be more than enough for 2 people. Because in the first atempt I thought it needed extra sugar, I added a bit of sugar too in this batch, but with maple syrup the extra sugar was too much. They should be awesome as they are. Thank you guys

I made this according to the recipe and absolutely loved it.  Just nothing like real buttermilk pancakes.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars it because my husband said they weren't sweet enough    ....so next time (there WILL be plenty of next times) I'll just add more sugar!   ;)

You can scale down this recipe.  Someone in the comments said "Don't scale this recipe - it won't work!"  That is totally not true.  I have made this in 1/3rds, which made ten 5" cakes, and 1/6ths. which made five cakes, and both came out the same and delicious.  I can't use 30 pancakes!

I have celiac and was sick and tired of box mixes which I hate. I subsituted the flour for rice flur added a little xanthum gum and they turned out pretty good. Need a little fix to make them so thick Also beware as  others have cautioned, be careful with the eggs and the butter. I made that mistake the first time.

Very good made as per recipe. Perhaps next time I will make it with 1 to 1/12 tsp vanilla. This will be my standard pancake from now on. PS: Makes 15  cakes  @ half cup each.

I made them as suggested and they came out perfectly.  Being a baker, I leave my cold liquids out to warm a bit (eggs, milk.  I appreciated that these came out right the first time.  Reminds me of mom and dad's.

I'm so confused. These were the runniest, eggiest pancakes I've ever made. I'm not new to this, I make homemade waffles and pancakes (including buttermilk) nearly every weekend.  This recipe was awful. I don't understand the good reviews?

These are the melt-in-your-mouth fluffy pancakes I remember!  Cook on almost low, it's worth the wait for the griddle to heat up - oh and wait for the bubbles to form on top and break without filling in the bubble - this ensures you only flip once and the middle will be done.

These were a hit with my family.  However, I made a couple of changes.  I soaked half a cup of oatmeal in the milk overnight and added it to the batter the next day.  I reduced the sugar by half and sprinkled in some cinnamon.  I also added two teaspoons of vanilla.  I did not have any buttermilk, so I squeezed some lemon juice in milk to sour overnight.

These tasted like buttermilk biscuits in a pancake. They were so soft and light and airy. You could just squeeze them they were so soft. Cut recipe in half cause I didn't want a whole lot. I even used buttermilk a couple days past it's expiration date and they still tasted delicious.

I only added 1 cup of Buttermilk and added 3/4 more milk. I mixed all the ingredients together and mix it with a mixer with the spiral things.  I made it on the grill and I put some in the oven. It expanded 3 times its size and it is really puffy and flavor is delicious..

I beat the egg whites separately until soft peaks form and blended that into the pancake batter with a light touch just before cooking. The result was very light and fluffy pancakes.

This is by far my kids favorite pancake!  We add chocolate chips to ours and even when making the recipe smaller for just my toddler and I, it still comes out great!  We can't eat the pancakes from a box anymore, they just don't taste nearly as good!

Love it!  It is the texture of a banana pancake but not as moist...I made my own buttermilk (vinegar and milk) maybe that made a difference in the texture..Overall delicious!!

I followed the recipe exactly and these came out wonderfully. I didn't get a chance to let the buttermilk come to room temp first, like another suggested, but we use fresh farm eggs so they were already room temp and I mixed together the wet ingredients first to give the buttermilk a little time to warm up. They probably could be a little "fluffier" or "lighter" but I thought they were great. I ended up with leftovers, which never happens with 3 boys, so we may be having them again tomorrow morning!

These were excellent. I made them exactly as per the recipe except I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. A little healthier and they taste just as good to me.

The pancakes' flavor and overall texture was amazing.  My family enjoyed them immensely and they paired well with  maple syrup and whipped cream. I definitely will make these again.

I usually cut everything in half because there is just the two of us and that is plenty. Comes out really well. We also add mini chocolate chips and double the butter. 

TIPS:
If you feel that the mix is running too thin. Add spoon full of flower and mix in. Keep doing this until you have reached your desired thickness. 

Extray chrispy edges! I cook bacon first on a electric skillet and capture all the runoff. Then I clarify the grease and use that instead of butter to cook the pancake on.

Not a fan of this recipe. It's not bad, but of the 4 or 5 I've tried from here this was our least favorite. I followed recipe and they were too watered down, which means flat pancakes. This recipe made 2 dozen pancakes so there was enough batter to get the consistency/heat adjusted to produce fluffy results, but I don't think it was anywhere near a 5 star recipe.

I have dabbled with a lot of pancake and waffle recipes for my toddlers and I actually bought a Mickey Mouse waffle maker but more of a pancake maker lol to please my  toddlers who are so picky as I am as well. The most amazingly delicious recipe ever. I skipped the salt though. I just hate salt in anything that's sweet. I threw in ORGANIC chocolate chips and blueberries for me. Amazingly addicting.  And I got a thumbs up from my 3 year old daughter and 4 year old son! And me too!!! 

Thanks for the recipe!

Tender with a texture like MCD pancakes. I did not change the recipe including the buttermilk but did half it and just dump everything in one bowl to mix. Lower heat works better with this batter and both sides will have that even professional look

These came out  great.  I homemade the buttermilk first.  I also ran out of all purpose flour while making these so ended up using about 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour.  Still came out fluffy & tasty

Represents a bit of a holy grail for me... wanted to replicate my favourite Hot Cake House in Portland OR,  and this is the closest I have come and I'm so happy!! So key to not mix too much to ensure fluffiness, I also use Eastern European fermented milk (like Bulgarian yoghurt) as it works good every time and easy to get in London, sugar is also optional IMO and I find the eggy flavour comes out nicer without it. these are perfect for loading blueberries, banana, choc chip into to make some pretty darn awesome breakfasts. I've shown these off countless times and can now bust them out super quick. Much love to you for posting these!

Loved this and I added 1/2 T vanilla and 1/2 T butter rum extracts, the added flavors were a big boost. I made the entire batch and flash froze these for DH for breakfast. They can be pulled out of the freezer bag and heated each morning, better than the HFCS ones in the store. Even made a batch with my canned blueberries!

If you are looking for the perfect buttermilk pancake, then this recipe is it.  My (almost) 2-year-old son requested pancakes for breakfast so I thought I would try this recipe.  Everything mixed up so fast and I know he loved them - he ate 3 of them!  I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I just put 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice in a 1-cup measuring cup and filled it to the 1-cup line with whole milk (I only made 1/3 of the recipe)... these were so good, I don't foresee ever going out of my way to have buttermilk on hand for this recipe.  I also added a little bit of vanilla and a little bit of cinnamon, because I add them to almost anything sweet that I make.  Wonderful recipe!

Wow, these were delicious and SUPER filling. Usually I double the recipe because 1 pancake per person isn't enough but these were! They lacked a little flavor on their own but with some butter on top they were delicious. I used an electric griddle but think they would have been perfect with a seasoned cast iron griddle!

Very good pancakes. My only tip is to make sure the milk and eggs are room temp before adding the melted butter. If not, the butter will re-harden in the milk leaving gross chunks of butter.

Delicious, but this makes a lot!  The second time I made them, I cut the recipe into thirds since it calls for 3 eggs.  I also added some flaxseed meal to add a healthy component, since my son is a picky eater and he doesn't mind that.  It doesn't change the flavor, just makes the color slightly darker.  Happy to finally have a real homemade pancake recipe, instead of using Bisquick.  My plan is to make Irish Soda Bread when I make these, since that bread recipe I use calls for buttermilk also.  Or I may make the full batch & try freezing some pancakes in a ziploc bag next time. Thanks again for another wonderful recipe!

I love these pancakes and they have been my go to pancake recipe for quite some time! I do add a couple extra tablespoons of sugar because I like mines sweet as well as add a little  vanilla, but besides that their delicious. Mines come out better than what I have at some restaurants.

I had some buttermilk on hand and went searching for a good pancake recipe. This one caught my eye; simple ingredients with a simple preparation The pancakes were light and fluffy with a very good flavor. The husband loved them. The only think I did different was to cut the recipe in half, which was no easy feat; you trying cutting three eggs in half at 9:00 AM...lol. Half a batch made 8 nice sized pancakes. I've saved the recipe in my favorites and the next time I have buttermilk on hand...I'll grab the recipe and maybe experiment a bit...a few toasted walnuts or pecans maybe...

I made it just as written, and with cold buttermilk right out of the fridge. Turned out perfectly. My five little ones asked for seconds and even thirds. There was a crispy 'crust' on them that was awesome. I think the key is NOT OVERSTIRRING.  The batter  looked a bit lumpy, but I only stirred until the wet ingredients were no longer wet, then quit stirring. The recipe made A TON of pancakes, but that's a good thing in my book :) Will definitely make again! Delicious!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  They tasted good but weren't fluffy. All my ingredients were also fresh.

I give this a Shot this morning. It was not as good as I expected it to be. I LOVE Buttermilk Pancakes. There is something missing in this recipe. They were fluffy and airy, had a decent texture to them, but there was a flavor that was not there I was looking for. I may try this recipe again but with some alternations to it to see if I can get it where I like it.

It was tasty turned out fluffy and light the way my husband likes. I didn't have buttermilk replaced with 1/2 cup of low-fat plain Greek yogurt and 1/2 cup non-fat milk.  I followed the rest the recipe exactly.

Holy moly! These are the best (gluten-free) pancakes ever! I used Pamela's Artisan Blend gluten-free flour to make them gluten-free. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and they are AWESOME! Whole family is scarfing them down. :D

These pancakes were very good - fluffy and delicious.  I added maple syrup and maple flavoring. My own recipe was similar though I've been using milk and lemon juice.  The buttermilk makes all the difference!  Make these - you won't be disappointed.

Pretty good. I made pancakes and I also threw some mix in the waffle iron and it gave them a little crisp while still super soft. Great with a fresh home made blueberry sauce.

It is our go-to for pancakes every single time. Only change I make is to the servings... Set it to 4 and that's a big breakfast for two! Key is to keep the buttermilk cold if you want them fluffy!

Great flavor, but not as fluffy and light as I thought they would be.  I've made it three times and keep adding a little bit more baking powder.  Hopefully I'll get it perfect soon.  Great starting point.

Cut the recipe by 1/3 which made three 6"- 8" pancakes for me and my wife. I've been making homemade kefir and used that instead of the buttermilk. Also substituted the sugar with avocado honey and agave. I added just enough sweetener until the liquid part was no longer bitter. The really cool part was when I added the dry mixture into the wet mixture it started rising. That's because the kefir contains live natural probiotics including yeast. So immediately the yeast produced CO2 and made the most incredible pancakes.

Love the pancakes! The only reason i didn't give 5 stars is that the thickness of the pancakes vary. Maybe I'm doing something wrong...still great though!

This was a HUGE disappointment!  Pancakes were super thin and had no flavor! I have made many different pancake recipes but I will never do this one again. I actually broke into my Hungry Jack box to have some pancakes to eat!

Simple Amazing! I am not a huge fan of regular pancakes but make them with buttermilk and OMG! My family gobbled them up. I sprinked blueberries to the pancake after i poured it on the griddle. No more using pancake mix for this momma. This is my go to recipe for pancakes now! Try them. They will not dissapoint!

Great recipe. Didn't have buttermilk, so I used a mixture of regular whole milk and then regular whole milk yogurt. Worked great. Also didn't have baking soda, so just used the powder, so that is probably why they came out a little doughy. But very tasty plain and I also mixed them with blackberries and chocolate chips, each alone and then some with both together. AMAZING!! Sweet and tangy. Will make again for a nice Sunday morning brunch:)

Perfect! Light, fluffy and delicious! Not difficult at all to throw together. Recipe makes a lot..freezing leftovers. 

I used "light" buttermilk because it's what I had. Great recipe, thank you.

This is the 3rd time I've made these pancakes. I followed the recipe and the directions to the "t" and they still aren't light and fluffy!
They are eggy, greasy, and heavy. The texture is rubbery.
These are like a thick crepe, not a light and fluffy pancake.
Disappointed.

This recipe is the best!  These pancakes ARE light and fluffy-like what you order at a good diner or pancake house.  I added about 1 tablespoon of vanilla to the base recipe.  This time I had no syrup, so I added an extra tablespoon of sugar and then folded in blueberries and white baking chips.  Yummy!  Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe:)

Delish! 

My buttermilk went bad so I had to make a substitute (Emeril's: 4.5tsp vinegar the rest milk in 1 cup)They weren't as fluffy, but I think that may have been lack of real buttermilk .  It made a TON. 21 4 in pancakes and a 10 inch. I had enough batter left for another 5 incher, but I just chucked it. Too much! I love love loved them!

I didn't have any milk so I used only buttermilk (combining the amounts) and had to add a little more because the butter milk is thicker than plain milk. 
But wow, what light fluffy pancakes. Terrific.

These pancakes are scrumptious! The key factor is, "Don't Stir Too Much". Easy Peasy instructions to follow, even if you are only doing half of the batch.

I made these exactly the way the recipe is shown, and can honestly say these are some of the best pancakes I've ever tasted. They're definitely going in my permanent breakfast rotation!

Without a doubt the best pancakes I have ever eaten. Follow the recipe and don't change anything and I think you will agree. Please don't review and say I didn't have buttermilk so you substituted something. Make it like it's written and review it. If you want to change it make up your own recipe and submit it.

These were perfect pancakes! I followed recipe exactly (but 1/2'd it). Mixed wet & dry seperately  about an hour before kids got up! Once we were ready, I heated pan, barely mixed the wet & dry together with wooden spoon, & immediately griddled them (as instructed)! The flavor was fantastic, the texture was fluffy & the kids told me they we the best ever & not flat or soggy!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!  (I could have eaten these plain, they were that good!!!)

So right off the bat, buttermilk tends to come in 4-cup containers. Adjust the recipe to 16 servings instead of 12. Nobody likes waste. ;) 

Second, I HIGHLY recommend adding blueberries to these because they make THE best blueberry pancakes on the face of the earth. 

Make the recipe as is, add berries, be very careful to not overmix, and being your self control so you don't inhale too many. You really don't need syrup, but my kids still love them with it. 

Now, if you excuse me, I'm off to go pick raspberries to try with the next batch of these flapjacks of heaven.

I've made a lot of pancakes in my time. We love buttermilk pancakes. These are terrible.  They were flat and came out looking like the strangest pancakes I've ever seen - all different shapes.

This recipe is incredibly easy and delicious!  I made waffles with this recipe yesterday and my sweetheart and I ate more than we expected since they were soooo good!  And we had leftovers to put in the freezer.  I had a freezer waffle this morning and it was as wonderful as they were fresh!!  I highly recommend this recipe.  Oh, I changed a couple of things:  I used all buttermilk instead of the 1/2 cup of regular milk.  I had a quart of buttermilk so I chose to just use what I had.   After a couple of waffles I added 2 tsp. vanilla and 2 tsp. cinnamon just to compare the flavors.  Great additions!!!  But the original recipe itself is excellent....  Enjoy!

My husband (age 50) is a pancake lover & said these are the best he's ever had!  As for me, I usually could take or leave pancakes, but I thought these were wonderful I added a few blueberries to mine while cooking & thought they were even better than plain.  This will be my go-to recipe - thank you!

Hands down the best pancake recipe I've tried from allrecipes. Followed a couple other posters' tips and added the juice of a quarter of a lime, folded the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients very gently (we're talking ten folds max), and left the mix in the refrigerator overnight. Wow. Much fluffier pancakes than I'm used to and this great flavor. Doesn't need any additions either!

Absolutely delicious! I used the good old buttermilk substitute (1T white vinegar to 1 cup whole or 2% milk), and did not add the extra milk called for in the recipe. Best pancakes ever.  With only two of us, I knew there would be way more than we could eat for breakfast, but decided to make the full recipe before I start halving it.

I like a thicker/fluffy pancake. This batter was, like many others stated, too runny. I used big spoon to stir, not over-stir, and it flattened out in pan, crepe-like. bummer. (I did buttermilk substitute of milk/vinegar and added 1/4c plain greek yogurt for the smooth texture it helps to give instead of too airy cake, as well as had eggs/milk room temp first).  

 I added 2 MORE cups of AP flour, sifted (i added 1/4c at time until i got a pancake I liked) and 1 Tbsp more baking powder. BOOM! My pancakes were about 3/4" thick. More dense, but I like it that way.  I believe there's 1 too many eggs and not enough flour for the original recipe.

This made about 24 pancakes. Mine are 4-5" diameter, smaller for my lil ones.

I followed the recipe exactly. The directions said not to over stir. I was hesitant about that because the mixture was so lumpy, but sure enough the lumps disappeared once the cakes were on the griddle.  These were by far the BEST pancakes I have ever tasted! I will definitely make them again! Our family of three had lots leftover from this batch, so we individually wrapped the leftover pancakes in plastic wrap (once they were cooled) and put them in a large ziplock freezer bag, and put them in the freezer.  On busy mornings, we pull the frozen pancakes out and let them thaw a bit, then pop them in the toaster or the microwave for a delicious breakfast.

I halved the recipe (2 eggs instead of 1.5, though) for my family of four and fried the batter for about a minute on each side on medium heat, as suggested, with butter to keep it from sticking. It came out really well! It was fluffy and a bit crispy around the edges, which is our preferred way to eat pancakes. c: Thanks for sharing the recipe!

OMG, is all I can say these are the Best pancakes I have had.  It is so simple.  I served them with warm Maple Syrup, and I added fresh berries and they were a hit at the breakfast table.  This will be our Sunday tradition from now on.  WOW, WOW, WOW!!!

These pancakes were so delicious and a cinche to make! I did want to note, like many of the previous reviews...it would have been helpful to leave the buttermilk and eggs out to get to room temperature... I did not and once I added the melted butter it immediately hardened. So before adding the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients I put the milk mixture in the microwave long enough to re-melt some of the butter. Once everything was combined everything turned out great!!!

These pancakes seem to be fail safe!  I used powdered buttermilk, and probably over mixed, yet they still turned out amazingly!  (they were a little unshapely, but tasted wonderful!)
We also made a simple berry sauce to put on top as well, definitely saving this one!

This recipe has become my go-to recipe for pancakes; it makes light & fluffy pancakes. I make the recipe with no ingredient changes. However, I allow the batter to rest for 10 minutes before I start making them.

The batter was a bit thick for our taste  so I thinned it with about a 1/4 c more milk.  However, these pancakes were light, fluffy and had great flavor!  I disregard the critique that this recipe doesn't make a fluffy pancake.  We found them to be quite light and tender.  Use fresh baking powder and don't over mix the batter.  It's a good recipe and I'll use it again.   It does make a lot of batter!

The appearance of these pancakes came out to be TERRIBLE!
They were to thick, runny in the center and WAY to flour-y. so disappointed because I really wanted to like them but they were a total NO! Won't be making these again. :( Would have turned out better had I looked at other reviews to find some tricks!

6.4.16   These pancakes were as good (or better) than any basic pancakes I've e ver made or had anywhere, anytime in my entire life!  Yes, they were that good.  Big, fluffy, light pancakes is what you get, and who could ask for more?  Not me!

I have made this recipe 3 times in the last couple of weeks.  It is an excellent recipe.  However, after the first time, I have been doubling the amount of salt called for.  The recipe calls for 1/4 tsp. salt per cup of flour, I use 1/2 tsp. per cup.  I also use honey rather than sugar and combine that with the other liquid ingredients, and I prefer unbleached white flour.  In any case, the pancakes turn out consistently delicious, and this is not much more difficult than using a boxed mix.

This recipe makes delicious fluffy pancakes. I reduced the buttermilk to 2 cups and added a teaspoon of vanilla and 1 diced mango. If you want a thin pancake batter add all of the buttermilk.

made according to instructions. Best pancakes I've ever had, let alone made. The only 'special' thing i did was my technique. I used a 1/4cp size instead of 1/2cp b/c these were mostly for my young kids (3/4/6yrs old), I used a nonstick griddle, no butter or spray. I cooked on a low temp as opposed to med b/c they were cooking too fast for me and browning too much for our liking. We don't like our pancakes rising too much (1/2in thick+) so I was using my 1/4cp to spread the batter out thinner after pouring onto the griddle and when I flipped them and they started to rise 'too' much I gently pushed some of the air out. The result was soft  and weighty pancake(no more than 1/4in thick), (i'd liken it to an ihop pancake, my previous favorite).

Best pancake recipe ever!  My husband even commented about how good the pancakes were!  The only change I made was to add some additional milk to thin the batter.  It made more pancakes than we needed, so I plan to freeze them for a future meal.  Thank you sooooo much for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe!  I let the wet ingredients set out until they were at room temperature.   I added 2 tsp of vanilla.  They were great and I didn't have to double the recipe to feed my family (plus I still had leftovers).  Next time I plan to whip the egg whites separately until fluffy and incorporate them after adding the wet ingredients to the dry ones to see if they will be even fluffier.

My kids think these are way better than IHOP pancakes! They can be picky when it comes to pancakes, but these I couldn't cook fast enough haha! I followed the recipe exactly, only I didn't oil/butter my nonstick electric griddle. I also followed the most helpful reviewers advice and let my combined eggs, milk, and buttermilk sit out for an hour (longer for me) to reach room temp. This helps them become more fluffy, or so I read...and wow mine were! I didn't need my oven to keep the extra warm because  my husband and 3 daughters ate them so fast! If you are able to set the temp on your griddle, 375 F is the perfect temperature, and for me 1:10-1:20 on each side was perfect. So thank you again allrecipes, I am yet again the best cook in the world haha! This recipe will be replacing my old one, and used again and again!

Came out amazing! I followed the recipe to a "T" no substitutions. I did however use reduced fat buttermilk and 1% milk but it didn't affect the recipe. Husband and 1.5 year old son ate them faster than I could get them on the plate! There was a LOT of batter left over so I made them and have them separated with wax paper  to freeze and reheat later.

These are the best pancakes! Follow the recipe. I added about an 1/8 of a cup of milk after I started to mix everything.  I used a hot griddle and I think that makes a difference.

Great, easy and wonderful recipe. I made my own buttermilk with yoghurt and milk. I added some white vinegar for extra curd. I also added three mashed and ripe bananas - for kids sake. All the ingredients got on very well and they worked in perfect harmony...The outcome was 12 pieces of  mouth-watering goodness which all vanished in a flicker! Thank you for sharing.

I've made this twice now and although my family live did the first time, I found it a little "eggy". So the second time I made it I used 2 eggs instead of 3 and added 1/2 Tbsp of vanilla. YUM!

The only buttermilk recipe we use and turns out amazing every time. 

TIP: add vanilla Torani coffee syrup to make them the best pancakes you've ever had. 2 of the best pancakes Ive ever had, both restaurants used Torani syrup in their pancakes!!

Just as easy as bisquick pancakes (ultimate melt in your mouth version) but even better.  This will be my go to going forward.  Helpful (but not necessary): 
-Cut the recipe in half for 2 large pancakes each for 3 people. (Still had about a cup left over)
Add 1 tsp lemon juice to the halved recipe (so 2 tsp if using the full)
Milk, butter milk, eggs and melted butter to room temp before mixing
DON'T mix out the lumps (never do!)
The longer the batter sits the fluffier your pancakes will be

Made these for a big family breakfast. They were a hit. I can't wait to make them again for just the two of us.

This was by far the best pancake I have had in my life!!  I was also extremely impressed with the fluffiness. I will definitely be making this again.

I used 1/3 cup of oatmeal flour  for more nutrition.  Followed suggestions to warm the liquid ingredients to room temp. Pancakes were fluffy as promised!!

Great recipe. Buttermilk is expensive in Australia, so I just mixed 3 cups of milk with a 1/4 cup white vinegar and let it sit for 20 mins - does the same thing. 

I also, barely mixed the batter, using a fork. I was sweating bullets as it was a very thin batter with lumps of flour, so i let it sit for 10 mins - and the bicarb and baking powder did it magic then and it started bubbling up, but they turned out high, incredibly fluffy and soft. A massive hit with my family.  

The quantities mentioned makes enough for a big breakfast for 4 adults, I found.  And I used a 1/2 cup measuring cup of batter for each pancake.

All said, an absolutely amazing recipe, just make sure you don't overmix. Don't be scared by flour Lumps - whatever you do, don't mix this into a smooth batter. This recipe has become my go to pancake recipe for now on.

I made a few tweaks (halved the recipe, left the dairy ingredients out to get to room temp, used powdered buttermilk and half & half instead), and these came out exceptionally well. So fluffy and light! I even saved the leftover batter in the fridge, and it was just as  good a few days later. I'll never buy pancake mix again, because these are really that good!

3-20-2016  ~I swear Hubs forgot his manners this morning.  He had his breakfast half eaten before I even sat down to eat mine!  (Taking pictures of your food can do that)  And while he was eating he kept repeating, “Ohhh, these are good.  I can’t remember the last time I had pancakes.”  Mm-hm, they were good.  And I was a little unsure they would be, since I found I only had 1/4 cup of buttermilk (for recipe scaled to 4 servings, which required 1 cup of buttermilk).  I thought the scientific ratio of leaveners to milk vs. buttermilk (acid) might be disturbed since I had to fill in the rest with milk but it worked out fine. (In other words, theoretically this could have been too much baking soda since the amount of buttermilk had been significantly reduced.)  It’s been said over and over again from a gagillion sources that when making pancakes, one of the most critically important things is that you resist the temptation to stir the lumps out.  Leave some lumps and making great pancakes is a piece of CAKE.  (Couldn’t resist that one) And let the batter set a few minutes before you start.  As for this recipe, this has just the right amount of sugar, which I sometimes think is there just to mask ANY taste of baking powder, which is unpleasant. Just the right amount of salt too.   All the way around, a good, reliable and obviously quite forgiving recipe.

really good pancakes. Used 1/3 cup for pancakes instead of 1/2, and pancakes were still pretty big. Yielded 22 pancakes!
May want to halve the recipe if you're not trying to have leftovers/ not cooking for a bunch of people. 
The wife and kids loved them. Fluffy and light, so there were no food comas afterwards. 
Will use this recipe again.

The best. Works great with kefir, even if it fermented a little too long and separates.  Just shake it up.

My pancakes came out Terrific! I made buttermilk banana pancakes with the recipe. I followed the recipe as shown except I didn't have any buttermilk. 

So, I made "buttermilk" from scratch which is 1 cup of milk to 1Tbsp of Vinagar or you can use 1Tbsp of lemon juice. I used both since I made 8 servings. 

You have to let the buttermilk mixture sit for 8-10 mins before you add it to the dry ingredients.  

For the bananas I added 1 1/2  of over riped bananas in a separate bowl. 1Tbsp sugar 2 Tspn of vanilla extract. A dash of nutmeg & cinnamon.  Crush the bananas with a fork until it gets creamy looking. 

Then, I combine all the ingredients just as followed and the bananas. just mix it good with a fork or you can use your wisk. 

Add a little bit of unsalted butter to your frying pan or skillet and voila!! 

TIP: you would know when the pancakes are ready to flip when you start to notice little tiny air bubbles on top of the pancakes. ;)

Absolutely the best pancakes I have ever made. I will never use a mix again. It was easy to make the buttermilk with milk and lemon juice as I had none on hand. I will definitely be returning to this recipe.

The flavor of the pancake was fantastic! I was not such a fan of the turn out of the pancake. It was tearing apart when I tried to flip it, and only 5 or 6 came out round. Other than that the  dish was over all exceptional. I will definitely make this again but with a few tweaks.

We finally found a pancake recipe we all love! I keep buttermilk on hand just for this recipe. We like these pancakes because they are not thick and fluffy, but thinner and less doughy. If you are looking for a thick pancake, these are not for you. But we love them just the way the recipe was written. This recipe makes quite a few - more than enough for my husband, 3 kids, and myself.

It turned out very fluffy! You definitely have to use good fresh buttermilk. If you don't have that try "Fluffy Pancakes Recipe" on Allrecipes which calls for souring milk with vinegar (it really works). A few small adjustments. Added 1 tsp vanilla extract, and since I only have sea salt, I used a little bit less than the recipe called for otherwise it would have been too salty. Also since they are fluffy and thick, it needs more cooking time than normal pancakes. Use lower heat, flip when bubbling and then give it a little more time. Poke in the middle to make sure it's cooked through. Also, 1/3 of the recipe is perfect for 2 hungry eaters.

I added 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract.  Flavorless, runny, greasy and flat  pancakes. My child said they were "okay", but I prefer "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes" also from this site. Will not make again.

This has become my go to recipie for pancakes since I hate pancakes from a mix. I've added all kinds of extras (bananas, blueberries, mini chocolate chips, brown sugar and cinnamon) and they come out great every time. It took me finding the right heat level so they don't cook too fast or slow and rise just right. I find a medium-low heat works best for me, and butter for the pan of course!

I was looking for a buttermilk pancake recipe that did not taste too much like the baking powder/soda, where it doesn't give off a bit of an almost sour taste. 

This recipe did the trick. I had some mushy blueberries which I wanted to use, and not waste. I ended up adding some frozen ones as well because this recipe makes a lot of pancakes. 

The pancakes came out airy and without the "soda" taste. I did however adjust the baking powder to 2 teaspoons, and baking soda to 1 teaspoon. Thanks for the recipe!

Would definitely make these again! However, I did make a few adjustments. I used 1 1/2 c all purpose flour and 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and a 1/4c wheat bran. I omitted sugar (syrup and fresh fruit seem to add enough sweetness). I used 1 1/2 c buttermilk and 1 1/2 c almond milk. Added cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg. These pancakes cooked up very fluffy and evenly done.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made these pancakes, my very first time to make pancakes from scratch!! Boy they came out perfect, I put vanilla & almond  extract  & nutmeg in the mixture. My little ones went wild!!   I Used  1c each of milk & buttermilk, which was more than enough & had Xtras left over, which were even better the next day. It will be definitely hard for me to go bk to box pancakes .

Really liked this recipe. Like others, I added a bit of vanilla to the mix. A big hit, though they are a bit thicker than I prefer. Made a very large amount, more than enough for 5 people and one of them ate 9 pancakes!

Awesome pancakes; this is now our default recipe too when we desire a stack of flapjacks! ;) -- We opt to sift the flour if we have extra time on the weekends, produces a fluffier texture. Otherwise, even making 'as-is' never fails to please!

Wow. These are great! Super fluffy. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 white whole wheat with great results. Made buttermilk syrup to serve with these. What a delicious  treat! Froze the leftovers and will reheat in the toaster. What a super simple breakfast on a busy weekday.

These pancakes are fluffy and delicious, although if you like your pancakes super light, these probably aren't the ones for you. We made half a recipe and that was plenty for four people. We will definitely be making these again.

I followed the recipe to the T and this is my new favorite. I let the butter sit a bit, with the dairy and eggs, gently folded the wet mixture in and the results were delicious! This made 12 standard pancakes and my family ate every single bite.

Fluffy, light and delicious! It did make a ton more than I needed. I have three teenage boys and I could have used about a third of the recipe. They just freeze them and heat them up before school. This will be my go to recipe.

Amazing, these are the best pancakes I've ever eaten. A tip, if you don't have buttermilk, a way to MAKE  buttermilk, is add a tablepoon of lemon juice for every cup of milk

This recipe is AMAZING. Everyone, including myself, loved them. Warning: the original recipe proportions are outrageous. I halved the recipe, and ended up with 15 pancakes, just enough for me and my family to have three each. Also, I recommend beating the eggs in a separate bowl, and then add them to the milk. Cracking them directly into the liquid makes it very difficult to mix them.

They looked amazing, but they were pretty lackluster when it came to flavor; especially for buttermilk pancakes.

Made exactly as written and they were perfect.  Fluffy, moist and super spongy to soak up your favourite warm syrup.
We freeze any leftovers for a quick breakfast later in the week.

My uncle had a similar recipe and I lost it over the years.  I was so bummed because I recall these being the lightest, fluffiest, yet most flavorful pancake in the world.  I must say, these were as good if not even a little better!  If you get something other than a light and fluffy pancake, you are doing something wrong.  You MUST be precise in your baking soda, baking powder and salt measurements.  THESE are the ingredients that give it the light and fluffy texture.  This is now my GO TO recipe. Seriously, if you want to impress someone with your pancake skills, make these! Thank you for sharing!!

These were amazing! They were the first buttermilk pancakes I've ever made and I was very impressed. Everyone in my family loved them, saying they were the perfect fluffiness. My eight-year-old brother kept repeating that they tasted like doughnuts and I should put a glaze on them. Personally, I don't know what  he was talking about. The only thing I have kind of a problem with was the cooking time. It took a lot longer than I expected and with the amount of batter it would not be something I'd recommend for a quick breakfast in the morning. If you got time, though, go for it! I will most definitely be making them again.

These were delicious and I don't even like pancakes, was just making them for my family! The only issues I had were my own fault. I added the melted butter before it cooled down and it made big lumps in the batter, but did not affect cooking or taste whatsoever. I also didn't have as much buttermilk as I thought, so I just made a substitute with vinegar and milk. Voila! Super tasty pancakes! The batter was not runny at all, the pancakes weren't too thick, and they were definitely not flat like some have stated. Oh, do add a bit of vanilla extract to add extra flavor!

Absolutely great! I only had one cup of buttermilk left in my container so used whole milk to make up the difference.  I will continue to use the recipe this way since they came out so good.  Not sure how they would have come out if I had made them exactly as the recipe required but they came out great this way.  Next time I will try the bakers trick of letting the wet ingredients sit out until they are room temp as noted by another poster.  Give this recipe a try you won't be sorry!

I have made these pancakes about 5 times since I found the recipe. They are beyond delicious every single time. My husband and kids are in love with the box buttermilk pancakes...now all they ask for are these homemade version. They come out perfectly and so moist they melt in your mouth. I do griddle them with a square of butter though :)

Didn't have enough buttermilk so I used mostly skim but these still tasted great  (they were just thin - more like crepes).  The only intentional change I made was to add a splash of vanilla extract.   My family devoured these!

One trick guaranteed to work that achieves the fluffiest, most tender pancakes possible is to mix the batter as gently as you can and for the least amount of time as is possible.  You want a very lumpy batter with streaks of flour throughout.  Try preparing it this way once and see if it doesn't greatly improve your results.  As for the actual recipe, I follow it to a T with no changes and they are PERFECT.  The only real change I employ is to drop 6 - 8 blueberries on top of each pancake after pouring the batter onto to griddle.   I don't fold the blueberries into the batter, and this prevents them from breaking or discoloring the batter.

These turned out excellent! I usually don't like thicker pancakes because they are too dense. But these were so light and fluffy! I took the advise of other reviewers to not over mix and to leave the egg and buttermilk at room temperature for a bit. I didn't have buttermilk so I Thea small container of vanilla yogurt 3% and the rest homemade milk kefir to add up to just over a cup. I cut the recipe down to 4 servings as it was just my young son and I and oh boy was he begging for seconds!!!!

Great recipe! To save time, I mixed up a batch of dry ingredients and stored them in a labeled jar; so every time we want a few pancakes it's just a matter of adding the wet ingredients and fry. 

For every cup of dry mix: add 1 cup milk/buttermilk, 1 egg, and 2 tbsp. oil (instead of butter), which makes about 12 small pancakes. Just like ready-to-go mix!

These turned out perfectly! I made them with chocolate chips and banana slices and they were delicious. My only issue is that I didn't look at how many servings the recipe made beforehand, so I'll be eating pancakes for quite some time...

I've made these twice, both times they turned out awesome. The only Pancake recipe I've ever tried that didn't turn out super dry. I did thin out the batter with a bit more buttermilk the 2nd time, I like the way they turn out better that way. I also added about 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I froze the leftovers (because it makes way more than recipe states) and they taste just as good warmed up

Followed the recipe to the letter and it was a complete success!!!  My long time picky eater ate 3 pancakes and I caught him pinching away at a 4th.  We topped them off with our favorite fruits.  So delicious!

These are good.  I made only 1/3 of the recipe and it made about 8 reasonable size pancakes.  They were very good.  Could have used a tiny pinch more salt, I used kosher salt instead of table salt.  These will be my go-to recipe.  So easy and so fast.

Omg.. these  were sooo good.  Best recipe! I didn't  want to make  a huge batch so I only  used 2 cups of flour instead  of 3 and 2 cups of buttermilk instead of 3. But followed  everything  else  to a tee. I use coconut  oil to lightly  grease  the griddle.   They were fluffy and great  flavor! Add a dash of milk if batter is a bit thick. I did because  the butter milk  was thick. Made about 15 pancakes with a 1/4 cup measuring cup for portions. Next time  I'll  do full recipe  and freeze  them :-)

Rave reviews from family and guests!  An added perk is that I thinned some of the batter with additional milk and made most excellent crepes!!  I would also think this recipe could support pecans, brown sugar, or pumpkin spice versions.

Fluffy, tender, browned nicely! Followed recipe exactly, and will definitely make again perhaps with blueberries next time. It's a large recipe, so will try splitting in half (using packaged eggs). Definitely a keeper!

I rarely make pancakes because the store bought mixes never turn out. I had leftover buttermilk from another recipe so decided to make pancakes from scratch. These were seriously the best can't pancakes I've ever eaten and will never buy store bought again. I only had two eggs and they still turned out perfectly. There was so much mix leftover I had pancakes for days...the old mix worked well.

These pancakes had a very nice taste to them! I substituted plain yogurt mixed with milk instead of the buttermilk and I beat the egg whites before folding them into the batter at the end. This made for very fluffy pancakes. Delish!

These were awesome!!! I made it almost exactly according to the recipe but cut it by 1/3 because it was just for 2 people.  It was plenty!! It made 8 smaller pancakes about 4 inches across.  I did add a tsp of lemon juice but I'm sure it would be fine without it.  Will definitely make again!!

These pancakes were perfect! Light and fluffy!  I mixed the wet and dry ingredients and let them sit while my pan heated up.  The recipe made 14 large pancakes.  I let them cool, wrapped individually and froze them.  They heat up perfectly in the toaster oven on low.  This will be my go to recipe.

I've made these twice and they're really very good - great flavor.  The only problem is that they are too eggy.  Next time I will try only 2 instead of 3 eggs.

Very fluffy. I let the wet ingredients come to room temperature. Added a little vanilla.

It makes a lot of pancakes, but after making them a few times my kids show up to eat them all, and if they miss a few I put them in a ziplock bag in the freezer and they are great later on.  This recipe is unbeatable in my opinion.  If you don't want thick pancakes, add more milk, but my family enjoys the recipe exactly the way it is.

Perfect gluten free pancakes using Bob's Red Mill new one to one mix (not the regular all-purpose flour...). These were the best gluten free buttermilk pancakes I've ever had, and I've been gluten free for over 10 years.

These come out amazing pretty consistently. Letting the wet ingredients come to room temp and barely mixing the batter makes them fluffy and tender.  I also like to add between 1/2-1 teaspoon of almond extract for just an extra touch of flavor.

Best buttermilk pancakes I've ever made! I make them on a 12" skillet so that the pancakes are the size of a dinner plate. They are well loved in this house!

Delicious, quick, and easy! 
For fluffier pancakes add 1 tablespoon of vinegar, be careful not to over-mix, and let batter rest for 5 minutes before cooking!
If you do not have buttermilk use allrecipes.com "Fluffy Pancake" (5 stars with over 7000 reviews). It is excellent too! I let this batter rest for 5 minutes too.

I think next time I will reduce the buttermilk by just a bit as the batter was a bit thin.  I added about an extra 1/2 cup of flour to thicken the batter, and a good teaspoon plus of vanilla.  Good recipe!  This made about 24 4" - 5" pancakes, so I had plenty left over to freeze!

This recipe is superior.  Not to improve upon it, I did add 3 tbs. of orange zest, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. Cardamom and 1 tbsp. pumpkin spice.  I add this to most of my pancake recipes.  Oh, and I did eliminate the 3/4 tsp. salt because of high salt intake. They were absolutely delicious. The only problem is, we (our family) couldn't quit eating them without control.  Thanks for sharing this!!!

Not a very good recipe. Too much egg and not enough baking soda resulted in thick, heavy pancakes. Needed more sugar too.

I tried this recipe as written(well, I did half a batch and instead of the 1 1/2 large eggs it was calling for I used 2 medium, which is a fine conversion). It was indeed fluffy, not too overpowering of a taste of buttermilk(but it definitely was there), but they seemed to lack something, which I can only assume is due to the sugar amount. I use syrup like most people, but I still feel like a pancake should have it's own level of sweetness too. You'd definitely need to up the sugar level to get it to get a pancake that tastes like most people would be familiar with. I have a recipe I really adore that has a ratio of 2 cups of All-Purpose flour to 1/4 cup + 1 Tbs sugar and that's a perfect sugar taste to me. So there's maybe a benchmark of sugar amount should you want to tinker with this recipe a little. :)

Delicious as written.  Made 4 servings for 2 of us - next time 3 servings will be enough.

Served with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup by Melissa on allrecipes.com.  Also cut to 4 servings.  Delish.

Best homemade pancakes I ever made. Sooo filling, though! The only change I will make next time is to add 1 more tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of lemon juice. But great without those changes

Just made this with the buttermilk I ended up with after making my own butter....  Also used RAW milk.  They came out so yummy that I should be smoking a cigarette right now.... (metaphorically speaking of course)

Adjusted for four and used fresh ground red wheat berries instead of bagged flour.  Pancakes came out GREAT!  Light, fluffy, flavorful.  Using the fresh ground flour added a nice nuttiness to the pancakes.  I have a high-end blender that is able to perform that task in about one minute.  I dump it into a flour sifter to remove any particles.  Will make again and add blueberries. Yum.

Note, it does make a bit more than the stated amount which is fine.

These are wonderful. I make the 8 pancake serving plus a teaspoon of vanilla. The only other diff is I don't add butter to the mix. I make them with a non stick and add butter after. Coupling this recipe with blueberry sauce is heaven!

This is the best pancake ever!! At least according to my husband & kids.  I did make a couple of tweaks, but not enough that I feel it's an entirely different recipe.  First, I doubled the sugar.  6T is not a lot for a batch this huge.  Then I added 2 tsp or so of vanilla. Lastly, because this is the one that's probably the least important, I replaced 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour.

These are the most delicious pancakes I've ever had! I was using another recipe without buttermilk, which was really good, but not as fluffy and light as these. This will be my pancake recipe that I'll use for years to come :) Thank you!! I'll try it with whole wheat and gluten free flour also. 

I used 4 servings instructions, but I didn't make 5 inch pancakes, so I had about 6 smaller pancakes.

Great recipe! Huge hit in my house. My change was to separate out the egg whites from the yolks, mixing the yolks with the wet ingredients as instructed. Then I whipped the whites and the sugar together and incorporated it into the batter after it was all mixed together. Makes the end result even lighter and fluffier.

I tried this recipe for 8 servings and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the liquid mixture.  They came out AMAZING!  By far the best pancake I've ever made.  This is officially our family recipe from now on!

the best thing about this recipe is that it uses 3 cups of buttermilk! so if you buy buttermilk for something (as i did) it uses it all up haha. that being said, these pancakes are good but not great. i didn't find them to be super fluffy. they were a bit lumpy when cooked (haven't had this problem with other pancakes). they were a bit too egg-y for me. and i wish they were crisp on the outside but that's just a personal preference. so overall these are good but i will try out another buttermilk pancake recipe next time. oh and they do not make too many, unless you don't like pancakes!  then why are you making this recipe anyway. i love pancake leftovers.

These turned out great! I halved the recipe and used 1 whole egg plus 1 egg white to solve the problem of halving a recipe which requires 3 eggs. Husband liked them and teen daughter said they were the best I ever made. They turned out fluffy but not cakey. I was tempted to thin the batter before cooking but I didn't and I'm glad. They turned out exactly right.

I have always used Aunt Jemima complete mix! I had some buttermilk on hand today and my husband asked if I would make some buttermilk pancakes. I found this recipe and thought I would try it. My family absolutely went crazy over the pancakes! I followed the directions exactly and they were amazing! My husband said "Please dont ever use box mix again!" :) This is a great recipe, thank you!

Delicious pancakes! I followed recipe exactly and they came out fantastic. 
One thing though, the recipe makes way more than twelve 5" pancakes. I would say you can easily get 12-15 ten inch pancakes (maybe it even made a bit more. ) 
I cooked them in olive oil and they were just delicious.

These were fantastic! I only had 1.5 cups buttermilk so I just subbed water for the other milk and buttermilk requirements and they turned out to be the best pancakes me or my boyfriend have ever had! I am going to continue to make them this way even when I do have milk and buttermilk on hand!

This is the first time I made pancakes from scratch. My grandson Ahsaiah wanted pancakes for breakfast and I didn't have any pancake mix. Allrecipes to the rescue! The best pancakes, moist and fluffy. Ahsaiah said,"Yah Yah you make the best pancakes" That was priceless!

The first time I made them according to the recipe, they came out excellent.  I'll never buy box pancake mix.  The second time I forgot I over stir, it looked too clumpy don't be afraid, do not over stir! that's the trick so they came out fluffy and don't add the sugar.

Great pancakes. I don't like substitute on great reviews, but I only had 2 cups of buttermilk left over from fried chicken receipe. I compenstated 2% milk and these pancakes still turn out great.  I used real maple syrup warmed in the microwave. I will make these again.

Thought I would try a new pancake recipe from this site. My HG pancake recipe is the Fluffy Pancake one. These just wouldn't fluff up for me. I halved the recipe so maybe my measurements were a but off and I used Saco dried buttermilk instead of fresh. I followed the instructions for that as well. I even let the eggs and milk come to room temperature and they were still flat. They tasted fine but were nothing special.

These pancakes were great!  I reduced by 1/3 for just my wife and I, and used half all purpose flour and half bread flour.  I added a bit of extra milk as the mix came out very thick.  Even the first super thick pancake was still light and fluffy on the inside though!  Fantastic!  Probably the best pancakes I've ever made.

This is a great recipe. I used all buttermilk instead of the 1/2 cup of milk and added 3 teaspoons of cinnamon. Instead of making pancakes I used a brownie/mini loaf mold to make pancake bites for my kids. I also made breakfast turkey sausage to sprinkle in between the batter as I put it in the mold. I baked @ 425*F for 10-12 mins. Came out great. Turkey sausage recipe:

1 pound ground turkey;
3 teaspoons brown sugar;
1 1/2 teaspoon salt;
1 teaspoon ground black pepper;
1 teaspoon ground sage;
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander seeds;
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper;

This recipe makes a LOT of pancakes! I cut the serving size in half and I still had leftover batter. The pancakes are good, I probably over mixed because I didn't know you should leave the batter lumpy. I probably won't make these again

I tried it and everyone loves the recipe. The batter is a lot thicker than I am used to, but it did not matter. They came out wonderful. Even for those picky pancake people.

I liked this recipe. I think the only thing odd about it is that it called for eggs and it had a heavy influence of eggs. I had recently found that shaking heavy cream can turn it into butter, and a by product is butter milk! A perfect way to use everything!

This is the best pancake recipe I've ever made! I previously used store bought pancake mix, but have started trying to cook more things from scratch. I added about 1/4 Cup of sweet potato puree that I had on hand, simply because we're about to move and I needed to finish it off! I used a cast iron skillet to cook the pancakes, which gave it a more rustic, yummy-ness that I don't normally get from my electric griddle. Very easy recipe to follow, and seems like you could easily add some blueberries or chocolate chips for funnies!

My daughter loves it when I make pancakes from scratch, and this has become my go-to recipe. I add a little vanilla for extra flavor. I'm surprised anyone would review this negatively, they always get rave reviews with my family!

Easy to make! I didn't add milk instead I increase the amount of buttermilk since I didn't want to keep an extra. It turned out just fine! I'm just curious at how to cook the pancake with prefect light brown color throughout the pancake.

Bar none, this has got to be the best pancake recipe EVER!  It was light, fluffy and tasted better than the pancakes I have had in restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly as is.  Be aware though that the portions are huge and you may want to reduce it to serving for one if you are the only having it.  Thanks Burygold!! Now to hit the gym. Lol.

Veryyyyy good buttermilk pancakes. I made these for father's day and topped with fresh strawberries and blueberries. These pancakes were very fluffy. I recommend not stirring the mix too much after putting everything together, otherwise the pancakes will come out flat. I think next time I will experiment and add cinnamon to them or chocolate!

We've been hunting around for a homemade pancake recipe.  This was a winner!  Our whole family loved it.  Did not add the melted butter as we didn't have any.  And only got 2 tsp of baking powder as that was all that was left in the can. Added a tsp of maple flavoring. But these still turned out fluffy and thick.  Great texture and taste.

I am not really a fan of pancakes(maybe once a year).  This was an awesome recipe. I was able to replace half the flour with flax seed meal, wheat germ, and a small amount of chia seeds. The buttermilk syrup recipe on allrecipes is dynamite with these!!

They turned out fantastic!  The only thing I added was a touch of vanilla extract and they were the BEST pancakes that I have ever made.  No more box mix for me either!  It was very simple to make and I already had all of the ingredients so thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Such a lovely fluffy, light and tasty pancake recipe. Made with 3.5 cups buttermilk and omit the half cup milk. I believe the trick is not to over-mix the batter. Loved it... thank you!

Had four adult guys and myself for breakfast. All of them loved these Pancakes!The only thing I did wrong was I forgot the melted butter for the pancake mix. The butter cooled down and became spreadable on the pancakes. Will use this recipe again. Thank you for posting your recipe, it was well received by my hungry bunch!

This was a yummy recipe. I would recommend using canola spray for the griddle instead of butter to grease it. When you use too much butter, the cakes come out a little too oily for my liking.

These were big, fluffy and delicious with maple syrup. I read a few reviews that said the batter was thin which was not the case for me.  When mixing the wet ingredients I first mixed the buttermilk and soy milk(didn't have regular milk) then I added the melted butter, a little butter started to solidify since I am not patient enough to wait for all my ingredients to come to room temp but it didn't cause any problems.  I was careful not to over mix and my batter was thick and chunky.  If you like more flavor feel free to add whatever you want, this is a great base recipe.  I'm not sure how other reviewers messed this up?  Maybe not using buttermilk or over mixing?

Substituted half whole wheat flour, and added a scant quarter cup of granola dust (from the bottom of the box). This is our new Saturday morning recipe! Fluffy and tender.

Just made these with some leftover buttermilk from another recipe - but this might motivate me to keep some buttermilk in the fridge more regularly!  I completely forgot to add the melted butter, but I don't believe it suffered at all for that omission.  I let the milks and eggs sit out for about 30 minutes to take the chill off, as another reviewer recommended.  I made a half recipe, which made about a dozen small-ish pancakes that rose SO high!

This was excellent.  My son ate 8 of them.  I would suggest using less salt, if you are using salted butter in the recipe.  Other than that - awesome!

I cooked these today and they were delicious! My mother's dough is way to runny so they turn out very thin and huge oO! I also get nauseous after just two of them. But this! They were beautiful fluffy and the way I like them: adequate thick, small and round

we could NOT stop gushing and oooohing and ahhhhhing & sighing over these... these were out of this world. BOXED AUNT JEMIMA NO MORE!
& of course, real non-corn-syrup maple syrup!  
 i added ripe fresh blueberries.
i CAN not wait to make this again!
not tooo time consuming. obviously takes longer than boxed lazy kind but theyre worth it, trust me. that lost 15 mins of sleep: who cares!
p.s i froze leftover buttermilk.. the only thing i can use it for is biscuits (im horrible at them btw) & pancakes.. 
so this vital ingredient will always be on hand!

Day one great, day 2 I added vanilla and lemon, amazing, day three I only had milk so I used that in place of buttermilk and it made equally good but thinner crepe like pancakes.  I can finally stop looking for the perfect pancake recipe.  These are fluffy with buttermilk, and have a suble crisp and are flavorful and not too cakey or sugary.

This is a very good basic pancake recipe.  Like another reviewer, I didn't have buttermilk so used the vinegar in the milk trick. I also got a lot more pancakes out of it than the recipe states, I made it for 4 and got 7, but I made medium-sized pancakes.  I think if you made the small size you could get 12.  The recipe is simple, easy to remember and will be my regular recipe from now on.

These are the BOMB!  Recipe made 5 very large pancakes.  I sifted together my dry ingredients.  Put my measured out liquids into the microwave just till warm...added my beaten eggs, then folded in my dry ingredients...left it very lumpy. WOW!  Soooo good.  I don't think I will ever use another recipe.

Yum!  We thought theses were quite good.  I used sodium free baking soda and skipped the salt.  I did add a dash of vanilla and some cinnamon.  I had nice and fluffy pancakes that did not over spread so the batter was just the right consistency.  Nice basic recipe you can make additions to easily.

These were okay!  I already have a favorite pancake recipe but thought I'd try this since I have leftover buttermilk.  Followed reviewers suggestions by letting the buttermilk, milk, & eggs come to a room temperature for a fluffier texture. It didn't become that fluffy, most were kinda flat. Perhaps the flour needs adjusting to make a thicker batter like my fave pancakes.

good recipe- as I love homemade pancakes. I did some tweaking, added 1/2 cup of cornmeal, reduced flour to 2 1/2. Adds a better texture. Also added 1/3 cup of veg oil and 1/2 of the butter required. Also added tbl spoon of vanilla extract. It was great. The recipe adds a foundation and you can tweak how you like it :)

As written, we found these to be bland, but had a good texture. I added 3 tsp of vanilla, 1TBSP of sugar, and 1/2 tsp of salt to give these umph! Some felt they were a little eggy, but most of my crew really enjoyed them.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (used Country Crock, which is made with dairy, in place of plain butter, and accordingly cut the salt by 1/3). I didn't even bother to let the buttermilk mixture rest, and they turned out thick, fluffy and plenty sweet, not overly eggy or dense but surprisingly filling. The only discrepancy between the recipe and my own experience is that I only needed a 1/4-cup scoop of batter for a 5" pancake, so I ended up with a whopping 26 5" pancakes, overall, enough for four family breakfasts at our house. At that size, each contains almost exactly 100 calories and 15g carbs, according to the weight of the ingredients, and two is a perfect serving size and still acceptable for the diabetic in the household. I froze most of the batch, wrapped in wax paper (after cooling) and tucked in a large freezer bag; they reheated easily in the microwave with no nasty texture changes.

Great recipe.  Light, fluffy, perfect pancakes.  Very happy - followed it to the letter (used actual buttermilk) and they turned out PERFECTLY.
I made 2/3 of the recipe - fed 3 adults and a hungry 5-year-old with a couple leftover.  
Popped the leftover pancakes in the toaster on low heat, ate with fried apples the next day.

Out of the two recipes I use for pancakes this one is the BEST. I love being able to use all the buttermilk I have left over from other recipes for these. My family loves them!! Such a great Sunday morning breakfast. :)

Flavor profile was rather flat. They were light & fluffy but the taste just wasn't there.

This was great! Cut it in half and only used two eggs. Worked just fine. Will use this one again. These were very light! Pleased my kiddo too!

Followed the recipe to a T, aside from cutting it in half - there are only 3 of us and we had plenty left over...These were the best, fluffiest pancakes I've ever made.

I must have done something wrong. I halved the recipe then used 2 eggs instead of 1-1/2, for obvious reasons. The resulting pancakes did not rise to be fluffy and the interior had an odd texture. I'm back to using a pre-mix product, for the near term, at least.

Only had whole wheat flour but they were still good.  Probably would have given this 5 stars if I had used all-purpose flour.

Loved the base. I put a squirt of lemon juice in, left ingredients out to room temp, used milk/vinegar trick for buttermilk and used cream for the other milk. I did not over mix and the only thing I would do differently from above is a little vanilla perhaps next time.
THANK YOU!

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! Great flavor. The only thing that I would change is to add vanilla. I made them last weekend and will be making them again this morning. Highly recommend.

Loved, loved, loved these pancakes.  They came out fluffy and delicious.  The recipe is so easy, took me no time to make them.  Original recipe makes a LOT of pancakes (more than it states), so I suggest adjusting the proportions unless you have a big family or want to share them with your neighbors.  In which case I bet you will become buddy buddies ;)

I've made these pancakes twice for my boys now. They absolutely love them!!! Enough pancake batter for two or three breakfasts. Just add a little lemon juice to the batter leftover and refrigerate. Yummy pancakes...

So yummie, melt in your mouth good. I almost did not need to chew. Pickey 4 year old ate all of her large pancake.(says alot since she normally will not eat pancakes.) Made exactly as written, except reduced recpie to half.
Some of the reviewers complained that it was to sweet. I did not think it was sweet of all. But then again i am the kind of person who loves sweets.
If you are not maybe just use a little less sugar. 
I will make again, but i don't think i will replace my other pancake recpie.

Good flavor and consistency, but very, very, very sweet. They were so sweet, that we didn't use syrup.  Too sweet for us to try again.  Definitely more cake than pancake...

Best. Pancakes. Ever.  Made exactly as directed, except I only made 1/3 of the recipe for our family of 3.  It was perfect.  Made seven 5-6 inch pancakes.  Light, fluffy, and flavorful.  So good you don't even need syrup if you don't want.  The two key tips are to not mix the wet and dry ingredients until you're ready to cook and do not over mix the batter.

Perfect.  My husband says the best I ever made.  I had heavy cream available so I added 1/2 cut of it instead of the milk and used egg beaters to offset the calories.  They were wonderful.

These were absolutely one the best pancake recipes I have used. One of the only  only changes that I made was instead of using the 1/2c. of milk I used heavy cream. Also the buttermilk I used came fresh from a creamery. I do not usually leave reviews but,I feel this one needed to be rated. Thanks!

Wow -- I have never made such fluffy pancakes before!  I was trying to use up leftover buttermilk, but these were so good I would buy it just for this recipe!  These were easy to cook, but I reduced my heat to medium because my stove seemed to be burning the butter, which I was using to cook the pancakes.

This recipes requires zero tweaking. Period. I did halve the recipe for my family of 3, and we didn't quite finish them. I used a 1/3 cup to measure out each pancake and got about 9 pancakes out of half a batch. They are hands down the best I've ever made, and my husband says the best he's ever had.

Delicious! This was exactly the flavor I was looking for. I did substitute white whole wheat flour in place of the all-purpose, but that's the only change I made.

I love this recipe!  The pancakes are so light, fluffy and delicious. And the great thing is that it is so easy to make a smaller portion for two. I divide it by 3...1 cup flour, 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 baking soda,  1/4 tsp salt.   And the same with the wet ingredients.  One third of the recipe makes just enough for my husband and me. Tonight I added fresh blueberries.  So good!!!  We had them for dinner instead of breakfast.

This is so much better than the buttermilk mixes in the box. I did not change any thing it is good as is.
We ate it with home made black berry syrup and home made aple cinnamon syrup, sooo good.

Four stars because they were a touch on the eggy side for our taste and they were slightly spongey in texture. However, they were light and fluffy as stated and had a nice flavor. I accidentally used buttermilk for the 1/3 c. milk and the batter was quite thick. I imagine if I'd caught my mistake the batter would have been just right - rich yet pourable and yielding nicely round pancakes.

I just made these, and used the advice of many to barely mix it.  They were huge and very fluffy (AND I halved the recipe).  They made 7 very good sized pancakes.  I also added a little bit of vanilla & some blueberries.  Very tasty! I will be using this again.

I think I have tried nearly all the recipes for buttermilk pancake there are and this one tops the cake!  It takes a lot for me to rate a recipe 5 out of 5 stars ... This one won't fail to disappoint.  I really do think the secret is not only in the buttermilk, but it's so important to not overmix.

These are the best pancakes I have ever eaten! The flavor is amazing. Mine didn't turn out super fluffy but I actually liked that they were more substantial than other pancakes I've had in the past. A little more dense like a crumpet. This recipe makes a TON of cakes and I was able to pop them into the toaster each morning for a 'fresh off the griddle' pancake taste.

WOW! My two-year old, who normally doesn't eat, just had five of these (silver dollar size)! Impressive.  I used actual buttermilk (liquid from making butter yesterday), not store-bought cultured junk. I usually don't find pancakes tasty at all, but these were delightful. Mine actually came out thin, which allowed them to get more of a texture on the outsides. I like firm, not gooey, pancakes, and these were great! I'll make them again whenever I have freshly made butttermilk.

This recipe is delicious. Except for adding blueberries,  I followed exactly but used other reviewers tip in letting milk, buttermilk, & eggs sit out for 1 hour. Allowed butter to cool a bit before adding. I used 3/4 cup fresh blueberries coated in flour to keep from sinking to bottom of batter. I'll always use this recipe from now on. Light fluffy, fantastic!

These are great!!  The only thing I did differently was to add a little vanilla (I do this with all our pancakes) but there was a delicious buttermilk/tangy flavor and subtle sweetness to these pancakes that was perfect.  The texture was as a good pancakes should be with good fluff and almost creamy, not at all dry but not gooey either.  We'll be adding this to our pile of pancake recipes for sure!!

I had just made my first ever batch of homemade butter and had about a cup of buttermilk left over from that. so I ended up with 1 cup butter milk & 2 1/2 cups of regular milk in the recipe. I also used the butter that was homemade. Delicious! Great recipe! Does take a bit longer to cook these pancakes then regular ones.

These were wonderful! Just like it says, "light and fluffy". I didn't have buttermilk so I used the vinegar/milk substitute instead, but followed everything else as directed, and they were perfect! I will definitely make these again.

THROW AWAY YOUR BISQUICK!!!! I have never made better pancakes in my life! I thought you could get a pancake this fluffy only at a restaurant but I was soooo wrong! I highly recommend this. I made no changes and the only problem that I had was that one or two were slightly raw in the middle because the batter is so thick. They are so FLUFFY and DELICIOUS! Its worth the quick trip to the store to get the buttermilk.

This is a wonderful recipe! I make a huge batch and freeze them. When I don't feel like making a big breakfast I will pull one out of the freezer for a quick meal for my son!

These are simply fabulous pancakes. I didn't have 3 cups of buttermilk, so I replaced one cup with milk and lemon juice, and it's just wonderful. These are dense but fluffy and the 3 cups goes VERY far, much further than the boxed pancake mix. I also want to add that the butter congealed a bit, so I used my blender to mix up all the wet ingredients.  And now that it's been a few days and I finally used the rest of it, it's not quite as good as it was fresh. For some reason, the pancakes didn't get fluffy...they stayed pretty thin. They tasted just as good, they just weren't quite the right texture.

Wow!!  These are amazing.  My husband, who is usually a thin, crispy pancake kind of guy thought these were terrific.  Wonderful flavor and amazing texture.   They melt in your mouth!  These will be my go-to pancakes from now on.

This is a great buttermilk pancake!  It's the perfect balance of fluffy and dense and the flavor is great.  We used 2 cups of buttermilk because we only had a pint and 1 cup of whole milk instead of the 1/2 cup called for to make up for the buttermilk we left out.  It turned out really well.  We also put some blueberries in while the batter was cooking.  Yum!

Fluffy, moist, delicious.

We just had them for Easter Breakfast - and they were the best pancakes I ever had.

I just added a bit vanilla  :)

Thanks for sharing!

These are the family favorite pancakes.  I sometimes throw berries or chocolate chips in when I cook them.  The kids love  the chocolate chips.  We love blueberries.

These have to be the most decadent, and absolutely perfect representation of everything you would want from a Buttermilk Pancake!! I have made this exact recipe for over a year now each Sunday for my family. A treasure I will pass down to my kids, most definitely!!

These pancakes turn out so much better than pancakes without buttermilk. The texture is better, they crisp up better. It's just a great recipe. Before this recipe I never used to buy buttermilk, but now I buy it every week so I can make these!

allrecipes.com recipe contributors provide another great recipe with this buttermilk pancake recipe.  Because I have a food allergy in our household, I use a gluten free flour blend (I would recommend the source if I recalled where I found it - it was somewhere online - 2 cups rice flour, 2/3 cup cornstarch, 1/3 cup tapioca flour, 1 tsp xanthan gum).  I stopped buying buttermilk years ago and instead make sour milk (3 cups of milk heated in microwave for a minute and mixed with 3 tbsp vinegar then left to sit for 10 minutes). I completely omit the milk from the recipe - the buttermilk always seems to be enough.  Sometimes I toss in blueberries while they cook on the skillet.  Everyone loves them and ask for the recipe.

I didn't realize that I was almost out of all-purpose flour when I started to make these wonderful pancakes this morning. So I used the remaining one cup of all-purpose flour I had and substituted in two cups of whole wheat flour.  So yummy!!!

Made this exact recipe and they were the best pancakes our family has ever had. Will definitely  make them again. I was very careful to not mix the dough too much. The dough looks like it is full of lumps with dry pockets but they turned out perfectly.  The pancakes were thick, very fluffy, and light.

GREAT recipe, sooo simple. Tender and fluffy pancakes, they're delicious with or without syrup. Loved the fact that there's not a lot of sugar. Recipe does yield a lot of pancakes but cool them and pop them in the freezer for another time. This is the last pancake recipe I'll use.

High rates of approval by everyone who has tried them!  I added a bit of apple cider vinegar to increase the acid and help with keeping the pancakes fluffly.

I halved this recipe and did exactly as the ingredients and reviews said.  My pancakes turned out extremely thin, runny and lumpy.   They tasted quite eggy tasting and I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I guess I'll try to make these again without halving the recipe.  Maybe that will help.

This recipe was very, very good!  I will most definitely add some fruit on the next go around...maybe blueberries?!?  With the fruit I would give this one 5 stars for sure!  I would agree with the other reviewers that this recipe yields much more than the 12 - 5 inch pancakes mentioned in the original recipe.  I am glad that we have extra mix to enjoy this week!

I made this recipe for a breakfast get together with my family...3 men, 3 women, and 2 kids.  I scaled the recipe to 16 servings thinking I'd have plenty left over to freeze (I mainly did this so I could use my full quart of buttermilk that I knew I wouldn't use otherwise).  We made these pancakes, sausage, eggs, and fruit...all served family style.  We ate it all and we were all very full.  Everyone kept talking about how good they were.  I made about 1/2 the batter plain, and the other 1/2 with blueberries.  They were delicious and I will absolutely make them again.

Tried this recipe tonight.. It was the first recipe to come I googled buttermilk pancakes! We are SOOO happy we found it because it turned out GREAT!! Followed the recipe exactly as listed but did take some of the advice in the other reviews and made sure not to over stir the mix.. The pancakes turned out light and fluffy!! We even added a handfull of chocolate chips to half of the mix!! Definitely going to be our go to recipe for pancakes!!!

Let the liquid ingredients sit on the counter for one hour.  The pancakes came out fluffy and delicious.  Thank you for an amazing recipe.

Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! This recipe is so quick and easy. Was a big hit! Never can go back to regular pancakes again. Looks like buttermilk will be on my shopping list frequently. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

I LOVE these. Anyone I make them for says they are the best pancakes they have ever had. I make as directed and for a little extra I use real butter in the pan to keep them from sticking. This is a keeper!

Wow. This is the best pancake recipe ever. For added flavor and decadence, don't just oil the griddle...butter it! Ina Garten does this (using globs of hot, bubbly butter) and it is so good. I toasted walnuts with a small grind of salt in the pan first and sprinkled them on top of the batter with over-ripe chopped bananas. Seriously B&B worthy.

Way too salty, I'm going to add less salt, butter, and buttermilk next time, trying to fix it by adding milk and sugar.

I scaled the recipe down to 5 and still had left overs for a family of 3. But, I've tried many pancake recipes from this website and my family all agrees that THIS one is the keeper from this day forward!

I followed the recipe exactly except for throwing some fresh blueberries in some of them. These are the best pancakes I've personally ever made so this is the default pancake recipe for my house from now on. I was using Pioneer Woman's recipe which is good but these are better in my opinion. Forget Ihop and try these you won't be disappointed.

I reduced the recipe to 1/3 and still made plenty for 1 person (about 6 pancakes). I also substituted a little of the white flour with whole wheat flour  -so, they're even healthy!

I've made these twice. This time I let the batter sit for 15 minutes before cooking. The second batch was much fluffier. Over all this is an easy and delicious recipe.

I'm generally not a big fan of pancakes, but these are outstanding!  Did have to thin the batter somewhat (used 1 extra cup of buttermilk), but that may be b/c my buttermilk was thick.

So glad I found this recipe - it's worth all the stars!

I used raw milk that was souring & added walnuts, bananas & dark chocolate & it is delish!!

Even used white whole wheat flour & the taste was wonderful!

Excellent recipe. I just added a little cinnamon and vanilla and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose.  My kids ate every morsel.  I appreciate the suggestions to freeze the extras separated by wax paper.  I've never done that with leftover pancakes, but it worked perfectly...they might have been even better the next day.  I've always kept a box of eggo pancakes in the freezer...but I won't be doing that anymore!

The whole family loved these pancakes. I did make a couple adjustments to our taste. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a little more milk to thin the batter out a little bit. I make "smaller" pancakes then the recipe must account for and yielded a whopping 30 pancakes! I froze half for another time and they heated up perfectly in the toaster. Definitely give this recipe a try!

Great little pancake recipe.  I was out of baking soda so I just upped the baking powder by 2 times and it was great.  I even threw in a splash of Vanilla to the mix and it made a nice smooth flavour.

Exceptional recipe.  Very easy to make.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and did not over mix the batter.  It actually appeared quite lumpy but the finished pancake was perfection.  I used probably 1/3 of the batter and it made five, six-inch pancakes.  The remaining batter is in the fridge.  I would guess this recipe will yield 15 large pancakes.

These were wonderful!  I doubled this recipe and ended up with a LOT of pancakes.  I made these for a group of friends and they were a hit.  A lovely treat on a morning when you're all snowed in!

Due to some leftover buttermilk, I've made these pancakes a couple times lately.  I've cut the recipe down to 1/3 of the original.  The pancakes have a great consistency -- crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I'll continue to make these pancakes on a regular basis.

"Best pancakes I've ever made" that's what my daughter and husband said. So light and so tender! I left quite a few lumps in the batter, and that was key to not over-mixing it. I scaled the recipe back to 8 servings and it was plenty for us all. It made 6 HUGE pancakes. This is better than ANY box mix for sure!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G... I have honestly NEVER made homemade pancakes...I usually just add water to a box mix...but we had buttermilk in the house from another meal...so we gave these a try.  They were SO good.  My husband is a great cook, and he loves good food, and the first word out of his mouth was "phenomenal".  We will make these again.  One thing to note... We only had 2.5 cups of buttermilk in the house, so we adjusted the recipe to 10 servings...and that was a joke...there were WAY more than 10 servings... GREAT RECIPE!

Holy cow, this recipe made some huge pancakes.  I followed the recipe to a T, making no changes whatsoever.  The batter was very lumpy, but I resisted the temptation to over mix it.  The pancakes were very light and fluffy and tall, the perfect amount for my family of six.

This was a perfect pancake!!  No changes needed and it was great!  I even threw in a few frozen blueberries and they were even better!  The only thing I changed was the salt...I don't like salt so I only added 1/2 teaspoon but the rest was untouched!  Just remember not to over mix.

Great recipe!  We had our family favorite, but this one is much better.  Light and fluffy.  First time I made the 12 serving.  That was a little too much, but 6 is perfect for us!

These are my new favorite.  I left out the 1/2 c milk and added 1/2 c of pumpkin instead.  Also added vanilla and cinnamon.  Will try these again with mashed banana instead of pumpkin.  Very light and fluffy!

I even did 1/3 wheat four to make them more nutricious, and they were still light and fluffy.  I have never made pancakes that I have to be sure not to over-stir.  It turned out be a somewhat lumpy batter, but made excellent pancakes.  The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 is the taste was pretty average.

Pretty much the perfect basic buttermilk pancake.  I had to substitute almond milk for the regular and half the buttermilk (because it's what I had) and I used whole grain flour but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  My kids said they were the best pancakes EVER!  I got 36 pancakes out of it which means lots in the freezer for quick school day breakfasts- perfect!  I'll play with adding flax and wheat germ, etc. to add some extra healthiness but these are great as is, too.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I modified this recipe by replacing one cup of white flour with half/half of ground and light spelt flour and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  The spelt flour makes these pancakes melt in your mouth and added nutrition.

Awesome recipe.  Easy to make and light and fluffy.  I cut recipe from 12 to 4 servings, only 2 of us. Makes a lot of pancakes.  Subbed oil for butter and added nutmeg and 1/8 cup whole flax seeds to dry batter.  Also added blueberries about a cup.  Mix them with a little of the dry before mixing into batter right before cooking.  great basic recipe. easy to add flavors to it.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I was only cooking for me and my fiance, and so scaled the recipe down to 4 servings. The pancakes are very light & fluffy. I cooked them on medium-low in a skillet with melted butter (it adds delicious flavor!) They are so fluffy - IF YOU DON'T OVERMIX. The batter will NOT look like what you get in the box - it will look like a lumpy mess, but don't worry. When it starts cooking, it will fill out and become like a delicious pancake! Five stars!

My first time making pancakes from scratch and they turned out perfectly.  I was a little worried with how lumpy the batter was, but as everyone else said - it was just right.  The pancakes were light, fluffy and very tasty.

I scaled the recipe down to 8 servings. I have a smaller family. After reading other reviews I only used 1 1/2 tbsp sugar. I will never buy another box of pancake mix again and my family agreed. Thankyou for the recipe.

This deserves 10 stars.  These pancakes are better than The Original Pancake House.  The response I got from this recipe from friends and family was incredible.  I not only recommend everyone to try this but I insist upon it!  Perfection, I'm so glad I found this recipe.  Complete melt in your mouth.

The. Best. By. Far.  This recipe takes me back to growing up on the farm (even though I know that my dad exclusively used pancake mix).  Buttermilk has officially become my favourite ingredient, and I'm excited to start using it in more recipes.

Delicious! I added about 1 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients and about 1 1/2 tsp vanilla to the wet adds. Rave reviews from my hubby & 4 kids.  It would be ideal to have the wet ingredients at room temp so the butter doesn't re-solidify when added to the milk.  Wonderful basic recipe that I'm sure I'll use for many years to come!

This is a good recipe, but I preferred it with a little more milk to thin out the batter. Also, it makes a LOT of batter, and I was making pancakes for over an hour straight!

I followed the directions precisely and these were yummy!!! I've never made pancakes that weren't from a mix. What's even better is it really isn't that much more effort to make pancakes from scratch that taste wonderful vs. just adding water to the usual pre-made mix that only make So-So tasting pancakes.

Best pancakes ever!!  I whip my egg whites separately and add them just before cooking.  These pancakes are a bit of work but worth the effort.

Very good pancakes. Much better than a mix. I feel like something was missing though. Maybe a touch of vanilla? The batter is thick, but the finished product is light and fluffy. I will definitely make again.

Excellent!  I did make the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  Also subbed honey for sugar and added blueberries after pouring the batter in the pan.  Light, fluffy and great flavor.

These were the most flavorful pancakes that I've had in recent memory. The recipe is relatively easy to prepare and well worth the extra time required compared to using a store bought mix. Do yourself a favor and use real maple syrup with these.

These are very fluffy and delicious!  They take a long time to cook but they were worth it. This recipe made 20 5inch pancakes, it fed 6 people with a few left over. If you have all the ingredients do a search for buttermilk syrup, here on allrecipes.com it was a great addition!

I used lowfat vanilla yogurt in place of the buttermilk & used extra milk to thin the batter (about 1c milk total). I also added a splash of vanilla extract(as I've learned to do w/all pancake recipes). These were excellent! Very fluffy & tasty. I have no doubt I'll be using this recipe again!

Very fluffy, but beware that this makes a lot.  Following the recipe exactly, I ended up with 12  6-inch pancakes!!!  I used a half cup to make sure the pancakes were fairly even.  You can also use a large cookie scoop if you prefer smaller pancakes.

I made these for breakfast this morning scaling the recipe to 4.  The first pancake I made, I did not let cook long enough, and it was raw in the middle.  I tried another one, and remembered I had blueberries in the freezer.  I sprinkled a few on top, and was sure to cook the pancake long enough.  It was great.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I can't say it was as easy as making pancakes from a mix, but it sure did taste good.  They fluffed up nicely as well.

These are the best pancakes I have had.  I even thought they smelled good which doesn't happen normally.   I did change the sugar to sugar in the raw and also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.   So good!!!

I’ am used to making Dutch pancakes and they are very different from the American/Canadian pancakes (flat and big, but tasty). During a visit to Canada last year I tasted the fluffy and thick ‘American-style’ pancakes and ever since I tried to make them this way but without any luck. Finally with this recipe I got it right and it made me (and my family) so happy! Thank you! I believe baking soda is the secret because this is an ingredient that’s not used in the Dutch kitchen and quit hard to get because of that reason. Finding this ingredient (at the Pharmacy!) and using it gave the result I was looking for so long.

Okay, after all my research and wondering if this really was amazing with the 1,200 reviews, I finally scaled the recipe down to two servings so that I could taste it and... my first bite floored me!!!  I just finished my plate and I had to review right away!  They are without a doubt the best pancakes I ever tasted.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing.  At first I wondered if there was supposed to be vanilla, but I'm glad I didn't need it because the taste is perfect.  I served it with ALLISASMOM's recipe for "Buttermilk Syrup", which is caramelly and vanilla-y.  I would definitely say the adding of the ingredients right before you put them on the griddle, with as little mixing as possible, was the key to the gorgeous fluffy texture.  Awesome.    My advice with the melted butter is to microwave it until *almost* all the butter is melted.  When you mix it up, the solid butter continues to melt in and the result is a cooled liquid butter.  This won't scramble your eggs.  I'm not a "pancake person," but now I am with this recipe.  This is one of those "I know I'll be making every week for my future-children" recipes.  :)  Thank you so very much.

This is simply the best pancake recipe ever.  My kids refuse for me to make any other.  We add blueberries to the batter, I always dust them with flour first so that they don't sink to the bottom of the bowl.  I don't add the melted butter called for in the recipe either, don't think it's need.  These are the fluffiest pancakes.  GREAT RECIPE!  Thanks for sharing.

These delicious pancakes have become our family favorite.  I cook the entire batch on Sunday and freeze the remainder (with wax paper between layers) to reheat on weekdays.

What a great recipe!  I wish I could give it more stars!  As someone who has long given up on boxed pancake mix (hate that stuff) I thought I had been using the perfect Buttermilk Pancake recipe I'd gotten from my Dad over 10 years ago.  I hate to say it but the proportions here are different just enough to edge his pancakes out by 1/2 to 1 star.  I've made these several times and never looked back.  No changes needed except to add seasonal berries if I want.  Leftover pancakes freeze well wrapped in wax paper.  A 50% power zap in the microwave makes them a wonderful weekday treat.  Wish Dad were around to taste these.  I know he'd be impressed.

Delicious!  Makes enough to feed an army!  I am freezing my leftovers to enjoy again.  I mixed my batter and stuck it in the fridge until I was ready to use and that worked great.  Will make these again!

I'm being generous giving this 4 out of 5 with the consideration it MAY have turned out better had I had real buttermilk (I mixed milk w lemon juice) and I may have slightly overmixed.  I thought they were too eggy, and second the thought that the batter would make better waffles, or even crepes-- I missed the 1/2 C. milk and I still thought the batter was rather runny. The kids loved them, but they weren't that fluffy nor very filling. Even my 1 year old ate 3! We definitely used the whole batter just for 5 people, 4 being children ages 8 & under. That said: at least my kids loved them.

The BEST pancakes!  Knowing that the recipe was large, I froze them and used for a quick breakfast with grandchildren.  I made them small, about 2 inches in diameter on my electric griddle.  Some were plain, some with blueberries, and some with chocolate chips.  A real hit with all my family, kids and adults.

These are the best pancakes I have ever made!  This will be my new go-to breakfast to impress.  The consistency is just right - fluffy but substantial.  I added vanilla both times I made them only because we're not big syrup people and the vanilla makes it seem sweeter. The first time, I also added some Craisins that had been microwaved with lime juice and water to soften them up.  Wonderful!

I have been making this recipe for at least a year now, and my son recently came home saying "by the way, don't eat ****'s mom's pancakes."  "They're thin and hard." "Yours are the best!"  They are fluffy,  tender, delicious and do well with all types of toppings and add ins.  Easy to make too!

Scrumdidlyumptious!!! I have made these many times. To insure perfection...keep dry and wet ingredients separate until pan is hot and you are ready. Spoon wet into dry gently just until mixed. Add a few shakes of cinnamon just to give a hint and  vanilla extract. Use real butter to keep pan sizzling to  make pancakes in. I used fat free buttermilk and no regular milk. It turned out delicious light and fluffy. Husband said they've been great before but this time you out did yourself.

I make these weekly and the kids LOVE them! They always come out picture perfect too!  I do cut the recipe down to using 1 cup flour, and adjusting the rest of the recipe accordingly.  Great with fresh blueberries folded in just before you cook them.  Add a little lemon zest when mixing and YUM!  Have also made them into chocolate chip buttermilk pancakes by adding some coco powder and a few chocolate chips.  Never tire of these!!  Staple in our house

These were very good pancakes! Light and fluffy and you can really taste the buttermilk. I added 2 tbsp vanilla and a healthy dose of cinnamon to mine because we like 'em like that!

Yummy!  Substituted 1/3 cup butter with 1/3 cup canola oil, for dietary reasons, and they turned out great.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

There is a reason so many people gave this 5 stars.    As my first ever buttermilk pancake experience, I had no idea what I was in for, especially when the batter appeared lumpy.  My only tip is not to be deterred by the texture of the batter. I got rid of the giant clumps with a fork, but the rest of them just dissapeared in the pan. Go for it!  I also liked adding thin slices of apple once in the pan, was a nice compliment to the buttermilk taste!  Enjoy!

Ok - nothing special, though. I made a few as the recipe calls for, and then added some vanilla to the remaining batter.

It's true that for years I was trying to find the right recipe to accommodate 5 hungry people and this one is perfect.  I don't have to make any adjustments and they are tender and el goodo.  I've been using this recipe about 5 years now.

These were good, but I still haven't found a recipe that is better than the box pancakes (just add water) from the store.  Will keep continuing my search.

Not so sure. 3 c dry, 3 1/2 wet? hmmm, that's pretty wet. Second, How you going to have over 8c ingredients equal 12 pancakes? May be 12 12'...also...I like my pancakes thick, i added flour to fix this...and I'm thinking 11/2c buttermilk would have been plenty since your adding reg milk and butter. I make my own  buttermilk with apple cidar vinegar...so I'll just make it 2 c buttermilk, skip the reg. I'll tell you how it goes and post some  Sunday Morning Breezy Buttermilk Pancakes

These are very light and fluffy. I left the batter in the fridge over night. Made a few variations when I was cooking them. I added vanilla, cinnamon and chocolate chips to some of these.

Excellent! Makes a large batch and if you have leftovers, the pancakes keep well and can easily be re-heated. I substituted about 3/4 cup of white flour with whole wheat as that is what I had on hand. I otherwise followed recipe.  .

I had never made anything but boxed pancake mix before, but after making these, I will never make boxed again!  They were so easy, and the texture was perfect.  Moist, fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth good!  And I think this will make a great base for all kinds of pancakes, so I'll have to do some experimenting.  One thing I must say is that the pancakes themselves don't have much flavor, so I think I might add a little vanilla next time, but the texture is just perfect.  UPDATE:  I added a little vanilla extract the 2nd time around and that added the extra lil' something I was looking for.  Soooo good!  Also used another reviewers recommendation and made extra to keep in the freezer.  I just put them in a large ziploc bag and separated each pancake with parchment paper.  Then you can just pop them in the microwave whenever you want.  Of course they're not quite as good as fresh, but still pretty darn good.

Great flavor. I didn't have any buttermilk so I added 1 Tbs. Vinger to 1 Cup Milk (and made the recipe for 4servings) and it worked out fine. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks

this recipe is my family's favorite pancake - the perfect ratio of ingredients for fluffy cakes.  I use half whole-wheat flour and they are still 'light'.  I find that letting the batter sit for 5 minutes after mixing helps by giving the baking powder and soda time to work.

Yum!  Very good recipe.  I actually didn't have eggs and so I substituted it with mayonaise.  It turned out pretty good.  The texture was light and fluffy.  I'm not much a of a pancake person, but I actually really liked these pancakes.  Thanks for sharing!

delicious!  wonderful old fashioned fluffy pancakes.  honestly, pancakes aren't usually on the top of my list but my husband requested some so I wanted to find a great recipe.  followed the recipe to a t but as another reviewer suggested, added some cinnamon & vanilla.  they were light, fluffy just the right amount of sweetness and overall a 10!  There are only 3 of us so I cut the recipe in half and it was still way more than enough.  I will be making these again.  wow, these are wonderful - thanks for a great recipe.

These were pretty good. They had good taste, not as fluffy as I wanted. I did follow the recipe to the T. I did not over mix. I don't think they are good left overs.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated, they came out really light and fluffy. The batter was a bit much. We are a family of 4 and I had plenty leftover and everyone had a least three pancakes. I will make these again, I will just scale it down a bit.

Not joking when I say best taste and texture of pancakes. Very moist and fluffy but very soft and not bready. Great flavor to these as well.

Like magic! These cakes are truly mile high, so make sure to give them time to cook all through. Lightest possible pancakes. Perhaps a tad more salt? Oh, insist on real maple syrup and genuine butter to top these off!

these are so good and very easy to make.  my family loved them.  thanks for the recipe.  i've already made this exact recipe several times. we've made them w/blueberries, strawberries and once with bananas and walnuts.  it is a large batter.  so i usually save half in the refrigerator for the next day.

These pancakes where a HIT at our house!  And, they did make more than 12 servings, depending on how big or small you make them.  We made them average size and they gave us over 25.  I put a little vanilla extract and some cinnamon to give it a little different taste.  They were the best pancakes I have had yet!!!!   Thanks for sharing!

Definitely my new favorite pancake recipe. I tweaked it a bit but it was a great basic recipe. I tripled the sugar because I like my pancakes on the sweeter side. I didn't have quite enough buttermilk so I added some vinegar to regular milk. Additionally, I would suggest adding the melted butter to the milk before you add the eggs just as another reviewer suggested. Finally, I added a bit of lime juice (I had no lemons) and some vanilla extract. The result, perfect pancakes. :) Enjoy!

This is my new favourite pancake recipe.  Only caution - it makes lots, easily enough to feed 6-10 people.  We make a batch and then have fresh pancakes all weekend.

These were absolutely the best. My family and I were used to the prepared box variety because we thought they were more convenient. This recipe was really easy and we will never use the box again! One thing, I substituted the butter milk for regular with two tablespoons of lemon juice. Just let it sit while I mixed the dry ingredients. Overall this is a winner. I did scale down to 8 servings & that was lots for a family of four.

I have always wanted to make pancakes without a box mix…these were just fabulous! My whole family (5 of us) loved them! I used fat free buttermilk because that was what I had on hand, and it worked out fine. I found the batter a strange texture, and I was unsure about this recipe at first…but they were just great!!! I agree with the other posts about two things: 1) yes they do taste like IHOP pancakes, and 2) the recipe makes A LOT of batter. Worked out fine for our group (3 guys, 2 girls), but there was still a couple of pancakes left over; they went right into the freezer. So happy I tried these pancakes, the recipe is going in the permanent recipe box!!

Yummy.  The perfect light, fluffy pancake.  It's a little sweet and was great with blueberries.  I also think that chocolate chips would be fantastic.

the best pancakes that we have ever had....the only change i made to this was to add vanilla extract...wow! super delicious, amazing batter...this recipe made twice as much as we needed for our family of four. will cut it in half or a third next time. I made a compote with frozen raspberries, water  little sugar and cornstarch, we had the pancakes with butter and shipped cream also! really the best ever!

These pancakes are the best!  I don't have to go out to the restaurant to get good buttermilk pancakes anymore.  My husband made them for me and added blueberries to the batter and it was delicious...I couldn't stop eating them!

These are some of the best pancakes I've had, but I also used the best ingredients available!  I used fresh, RAW, homemade buttermilk (the actual milk left after making butter from raw milk), and fresh raw milk, as well as pastured farm eggs.  I'm sure they'd be good with regular stuff too, but all I know is that this way was well worth the fuss of making my own buttermilk!

Best pancakes we ever had. My son asked me to make them again. We even made extra and froze them, microwave 2 at 1 minute-perfect.

Really great-BF loved them! Very fluffy and gets a nice crisp on the bottom. Reduced recipe by two thirds, had to substitute 1 cup of evaporated milk mixed with a tablespoon of vinegar to get 1 cup of buttermilk which worked really well. Also added 1/4 tsp of lemon extract.

i don't know if cutting the recipe down to 4 servings had anything to do with my dislike for this recipe. When the pancakes cooked the inside was soggy, done but a soggy chewy bland mess of a pancake. I follow the directions to a T. don't know what went wrong. Definately won't change my current recipe Good Old Fashion Pancakes (from this site)

These pancakes came out perfect. I have extra for those busy school morning for the kids.  They were light, fluffy and right combination for my fried apples topping.

Very yummy! My husband and I were smiling all the way as we were eating the pancakes :)   I made 4 pancakes. I had only 1/2 cup of buttermilk left, so I used 2% milk and 1/4 tsp of vinegar to top up to 1 cup.

Really great base recipe. The one change I made was to separate the egg yolk and whites. I added the yolk to the wet ingredients but whipped the egg whites until soft peaks formed. I folded the egg whites into the combined batter right before cooking. Then dropped some blueberries on top of each cake after pouring onto the skillet. Fluffy, delicious perfection!

I've made this recipe dozens of times for a family of 5 and never had leftovers.  Follow the recipe as is, adjusting for your serving size, and you will not be disappointed.  Keeping the dry and wet ingredients separate in step 1 and not over-stirring in step 3 are the keys to pancake heaven.    Soooooooooo good.

Yum! So Fluffy! I put walnuts and pumpkin seeds in mine. Batter was very thick. Yum again! mmm... Make sure not to use butter in the pan because that is more like a fried pancake. I used coconut oil. purrfect!

The batter makes lovely light and fluffy pancakes.  However, I'd say maybe use 1/3 of a cup of batter per pancake.  When I used 1/2 cup, it came out pretty big and was harder to flip properly.  I don't have a griddle, so had to use a frying pan, which I suppose made a difference.  Cook these up as quickly as you can, because I could notice between the pancakes between the start of the batch, and then end.

The BEST pancakes I have ever made in my kitchen AND...the best pancakes I've ever tasted.  Two thumbs up, and now a family favorite.  I even blogged about this on my blog site!!  I should have taken photos - they looked beautiful and tasted even better.

A very good pancake recipe. I added more milk & butter since I like more buttery & thinner pancakes. They tasted great & they freeze very well. We will be using the recipe again!

These pancakes are so fluffly and tasty. Everybody loved them. The first batch didn't even make it to the plates with butter and syrup! They were so good we tore them apart and ate them while cooking the rest. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will be making often!

My husband made these this morning and they were fantastic!!  The best pancakes I have ever eaten.  He altered it only slightly... he used 2 cups of buttermilk from the store and he made the last cup with milk and vinegar (he ran out of buttermilk).  He also added a few drops of vanilla to the batter.  Lastly he added the sugar to the wet ingredients instead of the dry.  Simply fabulous!  We have a family of 7 and there were leftovers.  We love it though!  We just freeze them and pop them in the toaster during the week for a fast breakfast.   Thanks for the great recipe!

I augmented the recipe by using slightly less sugar (brown not white); adding a tablespoon of vanilla (we like vanilla!); using one cup rye flour in place of white (for a more "sourdoughy" taste); and Earth Balance vegan margarine in place of butter: this is hands down the best pancake recipe I have tried to date. Moist, fluffy, and delicious. Topped it with blueberries, pear slices, grapefruit, and grade A maple syrup. Incredible. Next: VEGAN adaptation! Maybe add some bourbon... hmm...

The pancakes are fantastic! The best I have come across so far.  The recipe is pretty much flawless.  I make sure to sift my dry ingredients twice, and let my eggs and buttermilk/milk sit out until reaching room temperature for extra fluff. I also add a bit more milk as the batter/cakes are a little too thick as written for our personal tastes. The only thing I added to the recipe was a 1/2 t. of vanilla to the egg mixture before blending everything together.  Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!

Most recipes use veg oil instead of melted butter, and after making these I see why. Even after trying to let it cool down, when I added the butter to the milk it coagulated into hard pieces, so I then had to try to warm up the milk mixture... what a pain. These tasted fine, but my basic Betty Crocker pancake recipe is 10X easier. It doesn't require buttermilk OR melted butter.

Really good pancakes, I added a little more butter.  They come out pretty thick, so if you want to have thinner pancakes, use more milk.

My kids have always had box pancakes so I was not sure about them liking these...they loved them. It was a great way to use up the buttermilk leftover after I made butter with the cream from our raw milk. I would do again, but not so much. I put the extra, while warm, in a ziplock and froze for another time. That keeps the moisture in for a thawing in the microwave and warming in the toaster oven.

I would give these 10 stars if I could. My family asks for them again and again. They are so light, fluffy and delicious! The only warning I have is that the full batch does make a huge portion. I always have lots of leftovers after feeding a family of four.

After getting the batter ready it was way to runny so I had to add alot more flour.  They turned out great!  I will keep making these over and over.

I scaled down the recipe (for obvious reasons) and let the wet ingredients sit out at room temp for about an hour before mixing.  The flavor was great, and they turned out light and fluffy with pefect texture.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a great staple recipe at our house and we double the recipe when we make it.  We replace the white flour with 100% whole wheat and the butter in the recipe for corn oil.  (I still put butter on top and didn't want to over do it!)  Great with chocolate chips and berries in the batter too!

These pancakes are fabulous, and also make terrific waffles! If you are patient, I do think they turn out better if you can let the batter sit awhile,  and it is wonderful the next day.  I feel a little sad if I don't make these on the weekend. :-)

Something was up...these would have been better as crepes than pancakes. Are you sure it really needs that much liquid? 3.5 cups liquid to 3 cups four was way too runny. Better after I added 25% more flour. Maybe sitting longer would help but I didn't have time.

PERFECT!!!  I did as another reviewer suggested and mixed it all up the night before and left it in the frige overnight. So much easier than mixing it in the a.m.!  Made with sausage links and it all came out super yummy, BF is a pancake connisuer and declared them THE BEST! I keep the done ones on a plate in a 225 degree oven to keep them warm while doing the rest so we can sit down and eat all together rather than serving one at a time. Scaled it down to 8 and ended up with 10 good sized pancakes, froze 4 with waxed paper between them for next Sunday =)

This was my first attempt at making pancakes from "scratch." The taste was far superior to that of a mix, but the  consistency of the batter was very thin, and the pancakes turned out flat, not light and fluffy, but soft and spongy.  I'm wondering if it's because I substituted lemon juice in the milk since I didn't have buttermilk.  Although I was disappointed with the texture, I will try again soon, but will use real buttermilk next time to see if that is the problem. The taste merits another attempt -- they're delicious.

I had some buttermilk in my fridge that needed to be get rid of, so I thought that I should try this recipe when I saw it. Little did I know that I would stumble upon the best pancakes I have ever had in my life! I only used 1/3 of the recipe, because my family is small. I ran out of maple syrup, so I increased the sugar amount to 1/4 cup. Also, since I had no milk, I used all buttermilk instead. The batter can be kept in the fridge and used later. I can't wait to try some variations with this recipe!

I've made these several times...they are always fantastic. I especially enjoy that slight tangy flavor that comes from the buttermilk; when I get a craving for diner style pancakes, I make these and have enough to satisfy the craving...they are awesome with real maple syrup.

These pancakes are delicious.  I substituted the melted butter with grapeseed oil.  I imagine they're even more delicious with the butter, but I was in a bit of a hurry making these.  Do try!

These were great.  We reduced the recipe to 8 servings hoping to have leftovers to freeze but we ended up eating them all. We followed the recipe exactly for measurements and ingredients.  however we were too hungry to wait for liquid mixture to settle to room temperature so it was a little cool when combined, which is possible why we found some of the pancakes didnb't cook all the way through.  We ended up using slightly less than half a cup per pancake and cooked them on fairly low heat to get them cooked all the way through without sacraficing fluffiness.  Will try again when we are less impatient!!!

I scaled it to two, and the recipe made 2 pancakes, and it hit the spot.  I rarely eat pancakes, so these would be good for the once-a-year pancake craving.

Just perfect. I used a 1/2 cup to measure them out and got 7 so far with probably enough left for 5-7 more. I didn't add anything and they came out just fine, nice and fluffy. It's all about how well you mix the batter and how you cook them. My kitchenaid mixer surely helps! These tasted like some of the best pancakes I've eaten at a restaurant.

I've never had pancakes so wonderful in my life. Although it was only the first few each time I made them that turned out fluffy. The longer the batter sat, the more like crepes they became. I barely mixed the batter- in fact the "crepes" cooked with flour chunks in them. I would love some advice if anyone else has had this happen. I absolutely loved the flavor. I won't give up.

My son said my pancakes were "as good as Gran's"!!! High praise indeed, I threw my old recipe in the trash - I used milk w/ vinegar as I didn't have any buttermilk and they were delicious. I did make sure everything was room temperature and it worked great, threw some blueberries in mine and they were better than ANY I have in restaurants. Thanks!

I had a craving for pancakes and this far exceeded any and all expectations! These are better than any pancakes that I've ever had - they're light, fluffy, just the right amount of sweetness, and I could taste the butter in the pancakes which made it seem like it was melting in my mouth. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, I let the milk/egg mixture cool to room temperature and I was careful to not over beat the mixture. I almost don't even want to bother trying anyone else's pancake recipe! Thanks for an amazing recipe!

These pancakes are awesome! My brother is the best when it comes to making buttermilk pancakes and mine have always paled in comparison - until now that is! These turned out so nice and fluffy. I added 2 mashed bananas to the recipe.

Very Very good pancakes. I added vanilla and made sure not to mix too much so they remained fluffy. I also saved some in the freezer for later use. made exactly 15 very fluffy pancakes.

I've never made pancakes before so I was a little nervous I would make a mess of them.  But this recipe had such high marks I had to try.  I followed the recipe exactly and dropped in a few blueberries as each pancake cooked.  Perfection!  I was so impressed and will be making these often!  They were absolutely the best pancakes, way better than what I have had in diners, and I couldn't believe they were so easy!

I didn't even have buttermilk and I am still giving these 5 stars! I substituted the buttermilk and milk for 1 1/2 cups half and half, and 2 cups milk, totaling in the 3 1/2 cups of milks. This turned out great, but I am excited to try it with the correct ingredients. My 5 year old ate 5 and my 3 year old ate 4! They weren't done either, I had to cut them off!!

I scaled this for 4 and my husband and I ate all of them (we were stuffed)!  I used half whole wheat flour, nonfat buttermilk and nonfat milk.  These seemed almost alive when I fried them; lots of air bubbles popping up immediately!  The final texture was impressively fluffy, even with the whole wheat flour.

These very very light and fluffy and good. Easy to make. I used powdered buttermilk substitute and it worked perfectly. Usually don't have regular buttermilk on hand to use that fast, but the powdered buttermilk keeps in fridge, more economical, and they tasted great. Will definately make these again.

These pancakes are AWESOME. I do have a few suggestions. 1) If you don't keep buttermilk on hand, "sour milk" is a  great substitution. Pour 3 tablespoons of vinegar (any type works!) or lemon juice in the bottom of a large measuring cup and fill with milk to the 3-cup line. Let sit 5+ minutes and use in place of buttermilk. 2) Canola oil and coconut oil work great in place of the butter -- and also save calories! 3) Using half whole wheat flour yields great results. 4) Add a few generous handfuls of quick cooking oats for extra nutrition (this is my kids' favorite variety!). You wont be disappointed!

These are the BEST pancakes our family has ever tasted! In appreciation of this wonderful recipe, i'd like to share with you a great tip: pour the pancake mix in a squeasable plastic (empty and washed) Ketchup bottle.  It makes it easier to pour the pancake mix into the griddle.

I was not a pancake person until I tried this recipe...AWESOME!  They turn out best when following a previous reviewers recommendation to allow liquids to be at room temp and then to mix with the dry ingredients right before you are ready to cook.  Really great with smaller wild blueberries (frozen) too.  I LOVE IT and so does my family.

This is an excellent pancake recipe.  I used this recipe to use up some buttermilk I had and the whole family really loved them.  My only change was to add some vanilla.  We will make these again, yum!

Thank you for a great recipe for buttermilk pancakes!! After moving to Denmark it has been rather hard to find a recipe where the whole family is satisfied.  Finally... everyone agrees..this is the best! Did not change a thing, just followed the recipe.

We make them all the time. TIP: use "Bulgarian Cultured Buttermilk"--much better than standard buttermilk. Also, Splenda works fine here; no need for sugar.   Also: no need to oil the pan if you use Teflon. We use two pans to get the pancakes made more quickly.

These pancakes are amazing!! Great, fluffy restaurant quality. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because mine 'deflated' and I'm not sure why. The boyfriend said they are 'ridiculous!' I also added in cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla because that is how we roll :) This is now our go-to recipe.

Superb recipe!I followed the advice of others and let the milks and eggs sit at room temp before mixing them into the dry ingredients till just combined. Then I let the batter rest for at least 15 minutes, which I read "relaxes" the gluten in the flour and allows the baking powder and soda to act on the flour to produce the desired airiness. Also, as per a reviewer's suggestion, separated the whites from the yolks of the eggs, beat the whites till foamy then gently folded in the liquid mixture. Added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter, as well as adding more milk about 1/2 cup,since I prefer thinner pancakes. Because of this I ended up with at least 20 pancakes, not counting the ones that got eaten by DH and yours truly. Pancakes were as fluffy as pillows and oh so tender. Delish with vanillin sugar sprinkled on top! Making this recipe does take time to make but the results are well worth the effort.

My husband has not ever really been a pancake fan and since I started using this recipe he really likes them now.  All of us (our 4 kids, myself and my husband) think this is the best pancake recipe we've ever tried.

I cut this recipe by 1/3 and it was perfect for breakfast for me and my husband with some bacon. I wouldn't add vanilla cause the tang of the batter is what makes it special, plus vanilla tends to make pancakes thin and runny. Delicious the way it is. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was what I was looking for. The only change I think I'll make is substituting regular milk for 1/2 of the buttermilk. If you really like the buttermilk flavor keep as is.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were the best pancakes I've ever tasted.  I burned my first one and tossed it aside.  While making my next one I nibbled the rejected one.  Even with being burnt on the outside and raw in the middle it was the tastiest pancake ever, so you can imagine how delicious the ones that came out perfectly were.  The pancakes were very fluffy and puffy, not flat at all like some reviews complained of - I suspect the people who got flat cakes didn't follow the direction to stir until *just mixed*, as over-stirring will indeed make them go flat. Once you try this you will not even be able to imagine going back to a box mix.  Just a splendid pancake recipe!

It was my first time making a batter from a recipe versus buying a box... needless to say, I was a bit nervous.  I followed the directions to a "T" and these pancakes came out perfect.  We threw in some blueberries while they were on the griddle and they were actually better than we've ever had at a restaurant.  Thanks!!

I used this recipe this morning. We loved it! I did however make a few changes. I did not have enough buttermilk (I only had 2 cups) so I used the 2 cups of buttermilk with 12 oz. of Blueberry Yogurt. Also instead of the melted butter, I used 3 tbs. of oil. They turned out great!

This is a keeper! I made mine naughty and nice. I added some wholewheat flour to the white, I used an egg replacer 'Ener-G' instead of a real egg and I added 2 teaspoons of Vanilla Essence and some Chocolate chips :-)which made the pancakes a bit healthier and a bit yummier :-)

pretty good.  But to me they lacked a little flavor.  I loved the texture and the fluffyness but something was lacking.  The batter will look lumpy but don't worry the lumps will dissolve.  I will try again and add some extra flavor like vanilla and then re-post my comments..

Excellent recipe for pancakes. Almost the same as the old 1960s Betty Crocker Cookbook. I add mashed bananas for an additional treat.

I used kefir instead of buttermilk and they turned out deliciously light and fluffy. The flavor was so good I ate several just plain.

Made this as written this morning.  My husband wanted "the good pancakes like you get at the diner" and he was so excited to eat these.  A new favorite!  The recipe yields A LOT of pancakes.  Too many for 2 people so I will reduce next time.

I only had 1 1/2 cups of flour this morning so I halved the recipe. Still made enough for two adults and five kids, although the pancakes were so good some of the kids ate as many as the adults. This morning was the first time we did not have any leftover pancakes, and I made about twenty, four inch pancakes on half the recipe. Everyone loved them.

this is THE BEST recipe for pancakes i have ever tried! they turn out fluffy and delicious. even my very picky kids ask for them all the time. and being that they're easy to make, it's no problem at all! leftover pancakes are rock hard and dry out, but not these. still come out soft when reheated. thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These are very good. If/When I have extra buttermilk, I will definitely make these. Also, I made the recipe as is for the first 14 and they turned out great. For the last 4 pancakes, I added some vanilla extract. I don't think it made much difference so this recipe is GREAT AS IS! Maybe scaled down to 4 servings for the next time my family of 4 makes this recipe.

Great recipe - I used part buttermilk and buttermilk substitute as hadn't bought enough (1 tablespoon of lemon and just under 1 cup semi skimmed milk left for 5 minutes).

Made these exactly as the recipe called for.  Let the batter rest for about 20 minutes.  Amazing, the best pancakes I have ever made, and simple.  I turn them early so they rise after being turned.  Light, fluffy, and tasty.  Nothing better.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the pancakes came out a little on the flat side.  Other than that, they were quite good.  Will definitely keep this recipe.

I've made a lot of homemade pancakes and these by far are the best.  They are light, fluffy and just have an overall awesome texture.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I just used vinegar and milk and worked out perfectly.  The only thing that I found was that the liquid/dry ingredients ratio was a bit off.  I had about 1/4 c extra liquid, but no biggie.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It will definitely be my go to recipe for all pancakes I make.

really - the best pancakes EVER. No need to let the batter rest - they are great as is. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and an extra 1/2 tsp of sugar to the dry batter but other than that it was PERFECT. Thanks!

This turned out delicious!!!!  I even forgot to add the baking soda, and the pancakes were still light and fluffy.  My one year old almost ate a whole pancake on his own!  Top these pancakes with the buttermilk syrup recipe for a yummy treat:)

These pancakes are great!  Very light and fluffy and I love that they get crispy around the edges.  I added blueberries to the batter and served with whipped cream.  Yum!  Will use this recipe a lot--I bought some buttermilk just to have on hand to make these.

I made these yesterday.  My kids are skeptical whenever i serve pancakes because I have gone through so many bad recipes but these were wonderful.  I added ground flax meal and even added flax oil in lieu of all the butter.  I was worried it would lose that rich taste but it didn't.  I have stopped looking this recipe will is a keeper

We love this recipe and make it all of the time!  It's good if you make your won buttermilk, but excellent if you buy buttermilk.  It also freezes really well which is great for breakfasts through out the week.

This is the best recipe. My husband always compares all of the pancakes that he has ever eaten to the ones his grandmother makes. Now I can make some just as good if not BETTER! Thanks!! I usually mix all of the dry goods ahead of time and put it in a ziplock bag. It saves me a lot of time.

This recipe goes a long way.  Although it says it makes 12 5" pancakes, doubling it was way too much for 13 people.  They were good pancakes though.

Tried this recipe for the first time this morning.  It was good, but I think it would be better with a touch of vanilla extract.  I've had better flavored pancakes in restaurants, but this was definitely a good one.

I haven't rated anything in a long time, but since I go back to this pancake recipe so much (it's the only one's my son likes) I thought I would take the time to thank the person that gave us this recipe. I double the batch and freeze them for a quick microwave breakfast on school days.Thanks again!

This was my first try at Buttermilk Pancakes and they quickly replaced my regular no-fail pancake recipe!  It's amazing how whipping the eggs make these pancakes super light, but the buttermilk gives a terrific heartiness.  This is definitely a family favorite!

Luscious & fluffy. Easy & straightforward. I substituted xylitol for the white sugar, rice milk for the buttermilk, and King Arthur Unbleached White Whole Wheat Flour for the white flour...they were the fluffiest and best tasting pancakes I've ever made.

This is by far my favorite pancake recipe and the only one that I make. The only addition that I make is 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.

Update: I have made this recipe many times both using buttermilk and a buttermilk substitute of milk and vinegar. The buttermilk substitute doesn't produce the same thickness of batter and can't recreate the fluffy texture that real buttermilk makes.

YUMMY! My search for the perfect pancake recipe is over. These are light, fluffy and delicious. I scaled the recipe down from 12 to 4 and was able to make 8 pancakes using 1/4 cup of batter per pancake.

Turns out that if you accidentally forget the milk, it'll be ok.

Also, I never make plain pancakes, so adding three bananas, 3/4 c choco chips, 1/2 c walnuts and 1/4 c coconut really made these fantastic pancakes!

There turned out light and tasted pretty good. I served these with the buttermilk sauce also found on this website. This was a good way to use up some buttermilk that I probably would have thrown away otherwise. I am keeping this recipe.

This are wonderful!  The freeze and then toaster perfect as well.  Only thing different is added some blue berry's and a little bit more liquid to thin them out.  Otherwise they were a bit too thick.  Have made them 4 times and everytime the kids, family & I love them.

These pancakes were amazing!  It must be the buttermilk because these were light years better than the bisquick pancakes we're used to.  I reduced the recipe to one-third and it was the perfect amount for 2 people.

These pancakes were incredible! I followed the recipe exactly. I have to admit though (and I hope this isn't rude) but I almost didn't make these pancakes because of the picture. They look awful and flat. Good thing I saw some of the members pictures or I would have passed this by.

My pancakes are usually the kind made from a box...they are usually thin and flat. I made these buttermilk pancakes and my husband was THRILLED and said they were the BEST he has ever eaten! Not only did they taste so YUMMY, but they were so FLUFFY! Excellent recipe...I have already added it to my recipe file :)

Sometimes we like breakfast for dinner so instead of using a mix, I made these pancakes as I had some buttermilk to use up. They were the best pancakes I'd ever made. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I did let my liquid ingredients come to room temperature first, before mixing in with the dry ingredients, as another reviewer suggested. They were light and fluffy and tasted wonderful. I got about 20 pancakes out of this recipe and refrigerated what we didn't eat between sheets of wax paper. I had two for breakfast this morning, heated in the micro-wave, and they still tasted very good. I'll never use a mix again.

This is the absolute best recipe that I've ever made and I have made LOTS of pancakes.  Some people remember living off hamburger when they were young and broke.  I didn't even have that much money, so I did pancakes and only pancakes.  35 years later, I'm happy to say I can afford the buttermilk for these.  I don't know if that was the key (not cheating and making my own with vinegar in milk) but nothing can ever top these.  Fluffy and tender.  Just perfect!  I cut the recipe for 4 servings following it to the letter and it made 5 nice sized pancakes for the two of us (using a "heaping" 1/2 c. batter each).  Thank you SO much for this recipe!  It was a long time coming ;) !!!

Added dried cranberries and walnuts.  Great!  Med-high was too high though.  One notch above Med was better.

Had some leftover buttermilk, so I decided that pancakes were in order this morning!  I scaled this recipe down to four and added 1/2 teaspoon of additional sugar, and dumped everything into the same bowl instead of separating wet and dry ingredients; I was cooking right away.  We loved it!  I made seven hefty pancakes that were fluffy, moist and delicious.  Use REAL buttermilk, don't go trying to make your own with lemon juice or vinegar!  It's not the same and you won't get the same effect.

Added fresh picked blueberrys and they were fantastic! Moist inside with a nice crisp edge from the butter. Just like my Mother made when I was a child.

This was sooo yummy and easy to make! My boyfriend and roomate loved it. They thought it was better than The Original House of Pancakes! I added some mini chocolate chips and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to it. Then topped it with Fat free Cool Whip, Powdered sugar, and syrup. Perfect!!

i had leftover buttermilk that i didn't want to go to waste so I gave this recipe a try.  Needless to say, it will be a morning staple.  It came out soooo yummy! I added a some cinnamon and sprinkled the pancakes with confectioner's sugar and syrup.      I also left out the 1/2 cup of milk as I was out and it still came out beautifully. I ate a bit more than I should have but it was well worth it.

the batter was stunning!  It tasted better than any box mix I have ever done.  After I cooked them, I found that they didn't have the strong flavor that the batter had.  They were fluffy, and the recipe was HUGE.  I probably won't make these again, unless I figure something out.

Very good even though I left out the butter. Did use 1/2 whole wheat flour and "made" my own buttermilk from 1% with enough  white vinegar added to thicken the milk. Also added ~1/2t vanilla extract and let ingredients come to room temp mixing just prior to cooking.  Only criticism was that the batter thinned after sitting a while-(cooked recipe in 2 batches). Maybe a bit less milk next time. (Or maybe if I didn't alter the recipe!)Will definitely make these again.

A family favorite.  It does make a distinct difference when one waits to add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.  The recipe can easily be doubled for lots of hungry guests.

This recipe has become a Sunday after Church Brunch favorite in our house. My husband loves these! I took someone else's tip and leave the buttermilk sit for 10 minutes before adding the flour and they do turn out wonderful.

Great recipe for pancakes. They cooked very evenly and were so tasty. I make a lot of pancakes because my 2 year old loves them so much. I added milk because I like thin pancakes and fresh grated nutmeg because I love the flavor and aroma it adds but not because anything was wrong with the recipe. This is the new pancake recipe for our family now. I was using one from food network but this one is better than the one I was using. For some reason the pancake middles wouldn't cook all the way with the old recipe. This recipe reheats great so I can always have them on hand for my son. I warm them in the toaster.

My family all loved these pancakes. We are a family of 6 and it was a hit. We added chocolate chips after pouring the batter on the griddle for some extra special sweetness! Yum! This is a keeper!

This was the buttermilk recipe I've been looking for. Really perfect taste, fluffy and light texture.....yum. I made sure to only blend this until just incorporated. That's key for almost any pancake recipe. This scales down really well. I trimmed it down to four and it made seven medium-sized pancakes for my boys and I. Perfect amount. I'll be sure to make this frequently. NOTE: Now when I make these, I use half whole wheat flour and I make the whole recipe. I either use the remaining pancakes to feed my two boys during the week OR I freeze them in batches for a later date. All I have to do is stick them in the microwave and they've got a hot breakfast, paired with fruit and yogurt.

The first time I made these I thought they were really good.  Then I tried other recipes and mixes...they were not nearly as good, and some much more complicated.  For ease, taste, and texture this recipe is top notch!

Our "Off Season" Sunday mornings are Pancake mornings.  I felt adventurous today, and strayed from my standby recipes ("TRUCK STOP" or "FRUIT TOPPED BUTTERMILK PANCAKES").  Although these are really good, and very fluffy - I still prefer the aforementioned pancakes over anything.  Definitely worth a try, though.

Outstanding. I had lost my old pancake recipe and am now thankful I did- this one is 10 times better. Bring your milks and eggs to room temp before, just barely mix everything together, and you will have the most fluffy pancakes ever :)

Tried this recipe yesterday and might need a little help here- followed recipe in detail y problem was when the batter hit the griddle it had a slight rise then on the flip they flattened down and had a very thin finish- the taste was there but they were way to thin and tasted undercooked even though they were browned on both sides- any suggestions??

I reduced the recipe to 4 servings, it made 4 big, fluffy pancakes. I used vinegar/milk for the buttermilk and it worked fine. I also added 2 TBSP of the Fiberex powder that usually goes in my breakfast banana shake. Delicious!

I made this morning for my kids. I have a different buttermilk recipe that I always make. I thought I would try something new. This recipe makes lots of pancakes. I used about 1/3 of batter to make breakfast this morning. I will use the rest tomorrow. Consistency was perfect. Love the flavor of butter in there w/melted butter. I missed the part to keep dry and liquid separate but I didn't think it made a difference. I might just replace this recipe with my old one.

Delish! Best pancakes ever. I added vanilla and microwaved buttermilk egg mixture until room temperature. So incredibly fluffy. Loved them!!

These are good, but I'm not a pancake expert or a big pancake fan so that is why I rated it a 3.  I had alot of buttermilk left over from another recipe and saw the rave reviews on pancakes.  Tasty

My husband and I just made these pancakes for a late brunch - yummy!  They were great and tasted like "restaurant" pancakes.  We added a little vanilla extract like some others had suggested and while it does make a TON of batter, we just plan on freezing the extra pancakes so we'll have a quick breakfast whenever we want one.

I've made so many pancake recipes on this site, and I have to say buttermilk pancakes are my favorite.  These were perfectly light and fluffy.  I sprinkled some of them with chocolate chips after pouring the batter.  Delicious!  The next time I have buttermilk left over for another recipe I'll be sure to make these.

Great pancakes!  I even rushed through the preparation and dumped everything together instead of mixing dry and wet separately then combining and they came out like a dream.  We love to freeze these for busy school mornings.  Thanks!

Nice and fluffy! Great texture and taste. I scaled larger thinking that the scale might be comparable to boxed pancake mix...and it wasn't. This scale is true to large size pancakes. It makes a lot of batter.

This is delicious!  I scaled it to 4 servings and it was enough for the two of us. I don't think I'll ever use a boxed mix again.  This was pretty easy and it tasted so good I devoured my pancakes in about five seconds.  I will definitely make them again!

These were really good. Like good old fashioned buttermilk pancakes my gramma used to make. Mine came out super-duper fluffy too. Downfall was, I had tons of batter left over. My husband and I could only use so much of it. great recipe when you have lots of people to feed!

This isn't an official rating, b/c I did not have all the ingredients. I was out of buttermilk so I used plain yogurt instead and had to add a bit of whole milk to thin out the batter.  They were REALLY GOOD!  I can't wait to make them with buttermilk, though.  I bet they are even better!

These were fantastic! Tender, light, and some of the best I have ever eaten! We had these with creamed eggs. Just one though, as we both had to try them with syrup and jam. 

There are just the two of us, but I made the whole recipe so that I could freeze some. I will toast them, re-heat them and take them to work, or just have them for dinner sometime soon. These would be great with sausage gravy!! That is what my Dad used to make for us in the mornings when we were little. Pancakes and gravy! Ahh... so good! 

Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe! It's a keeper, and I won't use any other, ever again.

These were the best-looking and good tasting pancakes I've ever made.  Substituted sour milk for buttermilk and ended up adding more flour at the end, because they came out runny.  When I asked my son how many he ate, he said "8 or 11, I lost count".  I made 2/3 of the recipe, because it was easier than half.  It still made about 25 regular sized pancakes.

These are so light fluffy and delicious, + they are also excellent with fruit added! I don't think I can ever go back to boxed pancakes after tasting these babies. Feel free to add a little extra milk if you prefer a thinner batter.

These pancakes are very light and fluffy, and they are good.  However, the middle of the pancake reminds me more of a german pancake taste and texture.  Buttermilk pancakes I is also good and is more consistent with a traditional buttermilk pancake.

I'm giving this recipe four stars as my husband and daughter enjoyed them, I didn't care for them because of the overpowering flavor of buttermilk which was all I could taste.  If you like the taste of buttermilk, than you will probably enjoy these pancakes.  I will look some more for another pancake recipe.

Beautiful! I've always tried to make pancakes and somehow managed to mess them up. This was fool proof. =) Some variations I used; I added a splash of vanilla extract and tablespoon of brown sugar and some chocolate chips. YUM! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

These were pretty good. I made the recipe exactly as written except I let the buttermilk, egg, milk mixture come to room temperature.  I actually think using the bisquick recipe and substituting almost all of the milk for buttermilk is even better and easier.

Excellent recipe. In lieu of the vanilla that some people added, I used a bit of the butter flavoring I use when caking cakes. Awesome results.

These are great.  I have had no problem with keeping the extra batter in the fridge.  My children prefer it when I make it with sour milk instead of buttermilk

This recipe feeds alot of people.  I made mine with a splash of vanilla extract and fresh blueberries.  I was a little worried that the batter was too thick, but the pancakes turned out great.  Remember, don't flip too soon, wait for those bubbles to burst.

I don't know whether this recipe is just that awesome, or if using actual buttermilk instead of milk/lemon I usually use as a replacement makes such a dramatic difference - but I won't even bother with any other pancake recipe from now on. I did add cinnamon as my only change .... as far as syrup... who needs it with these??? I did not double this recipe (I usually triple pancake recipes) and I will have to next time. Not enough for 4 teen boys!

I love the pancakes. A very simple recipe.  I added cinammon and brown sugar instead of white sugar to the flour and vanilla extract to the dairy and it came out wonderful with a nice sweet taste to it and served with real maple syrup.

These are so much better than boxed mixes, light and delicious. I fed at least 12 with this recipe, and none leftover:) My husband said after 25 years of marriage I finally got them (pancakes) right.

Yummeeeee!  Loved these pancakes!! My kids ravaged on them.  These buttermilk pancakes are the perfect compliment to pure maple syrup.  They are a nice base and an easy to do recipe.  This made a lot of batter, more than my young (3 and under) kids + husband could eat in one sitting.  These have that awesome, homemade "I didn't come from a box" flavor that is the perfect compliment to the maple syrup.  Besides the buttermilk, these are nice because the recipe consists of things I usually have in the pantry.

reviewing this again... After a few attempts at other pancakes from this site, I came back to this one. Better than the rest because they aren't so thick and cakey. I didn't change a thing.

Made a half batch of this recipe (Used 2 eggs) and they came out great! This is really a whisk opportunity as opposed to the instructed "using a wooden spoon or fork to blend". I don't know about over stirring but the whisk gets the batter nice and smooth with very few lumps. 
I know everyone loves their short stack but I prefer silver dollars for ease and convenience. These actually cooked faster than my usual dry mix and I was pretty busy poring and flipping. I might try a lower heat next time (was just under medium). Just remember bursting bubbles is your pancake's way of saying "Flip me!"

Great recipe!! I made a few modifications: Instead of melted butter, I used half oil and half applesauce; I replaced one cup of flour with half a cup of flax meal and half a cup of oat bran. Also, I added some vanilla extract... They turned out great topped with strawberries and grapes. Yummy!!!

I was hoping that this recipe would work out for me. It sounded promising. I've been wanting a good homemade pancake recipe. I followed others advice and had the milk and eggs at room tempurature, and I added vanilla for flavor. I followed the directions on the recipe and did not mix dry and liquid until ready to cook. At first it was real fluffy and the first 8 came out great. But then the batter went flat. I don't think I over mixed (I was real careful about this). The following pancakes looked like crepes. Maybe it was because I used margerine instead of butter. And I used 1% milk mixed with lemon juice to substitute for buttermilk. I want to try this again with butter and buttermilk and see how that works. Otherwise, Bisquick is still better.

I LOVED these pancakes! Will never make any other recipe but this one. The great thing is that I had left overs after feeding my family of 5! The added vanilla is wonderful. Served with fresh blueberries and canteloupe. Great for Sunday breakfast.

These are scrumptious!! This recipe is the only recipe I will use for pancakes now. I have been making these for several months and have been wowed by them everytime. We always have leftovers (being that there are only 3 of us), so I pop the pancakes in the toaster the next day and they are delish!!

This is an amazing recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so I just added a few tablespoons of vinegar to regular milk and let it sit for a few minutes until it curdled a little. Very light, and they cut like butter! We had these with canned peaches and whipping cream.. YUMMY!

I made these this morning and maybe my baking powder is not good anymore because these were very flat and bland. My husband said he likes the buttermilk pancake mix in a box better. Hope they turn out better for everyone else.

Thanks

I halved the recipe (used 2 eggs and half on everything else) and it made 7 good sized pancakes.  They turned out pretty good.  It wasn't too thick or thin.  I didn't over mix it at the end, it had little "chunks" in it, but it all smoothed out on the griddle.

My husband and son hated pancakes until I made these, and now they ask for them all the time.  I always keep buttermilk in the fridge.  I make 1/3 of the recipe and add 1tbsp of vanilla, and they are quick, easy, and absolutely delicious.  The best pancakes we have ever tasted.

Very good!  Might add a little more sugar and some vanilla next time. Cooked on medium heat.  Don't overmix batter, as it should be lumpy.  Thanks!

I thought the batter was a little too thick & difficult to work with.  My husband & I didn't really care for these.  There was little flavor.  We won't be making these again.

I made these with blueberries and they were amazing. When I didn't have buttermilk, I substituted milk with cream of tartar (to make a cup of buttermilk, use 1 cup milk plus 1.75 tablespoons cream of tartar). With real buttermilk, though, these pancakes are awesome! I cooked the pancakes at 350 degrees on the griddle.

These were the best pancakes I've ever made (I've never tried buttermilk before!).  I was a little concerned about how un-runny the batter was, but it resulted in fluffy, tall pancakes, and they tasted fantastic!

These were the most amazing pancakes ever!  They were so easy and they turned out great - I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband just came home from being overseas for a few months, and his one request was that I make pancakes for breakfast.  I wanted them to turn out perfect, and these did!  This is a large recipe, which I really liked.

These were great.  I made them exactly like the recipe says. No changes. They got rave reviews at Easter.  The lumpy batter made me question if I did something wrong, but I guess that's normal and they turned out perfect.  Nice and fluffy.  I will use this recipe from now on.

We just tried these ADDICTIVE pancakes!  They are the best we've ever tried.  The batter appeared much thinner than we're used to, but don't let that fool you - the results are very light, fluffy and delicious.  We've decided to strike the boxed mix off of our "to get" list and make up a large batch of this and put it into the empty box instead, since it is so much better!

I halved the recipe and used whole wheat flour. When I mixed everything together, the batter seemed too thick and burned while the rest of it was still relatively uncooked. I added some milk, and they cooked up fine but when I ate them they were a little too floppy for my taste. But the flavor was very good. My problem might have been from the whole wheat or halving the recipe, and I will definitely use this recipe again and follow the directions word for word to see if that fixes my issues with it. I'd give this rec
ipe 4 1/2 stars if I could.

I usually opt for recipes that have wheat flour, bran, etc., but I was in the mood for a good ol' white flour recipe and this one was very good.  I halved the recipe, used one egg and added a little vanilla as recommended by other reviewers.  I also used canola oil instead of melted butter.  Still tasted great.  Be warned that the batter is very thick and requires a little spreading in the pan.  I'll make this again.

These pancakes are awesome! They are quick to mix and taste great. I have made them many times and the only change I have made is to add 1 tablespoon vanilla to the full recipe (or 2 teaspoons to the 8-serving size that I usually make). That adds just a little extra goodness to them. They are light and fluffy - everything you could want in a pancake.

Excellent exactly as is!  Although I scaled down the recipe to make 4 servings as it is just my husband and myself. Turned out perfectly. Will try tossing blueberries in flour and adding to batter for variety next time.  No troubles cooking through as someone else had said.  Had a crepe pan set at 4-5 heat!  PERFECT!!!

These pancakes are the best. I no longer buy instant pancake mix. My 4 year old said, "This is yummy yummy for my tummy!" My hubby asked if this really was from scratch because it was sooo good. Previously, we had a few failed pancake recipes. Note: I never have buttermilk, so I use milk with vinegar.

My youngest son and I are the only ones who eat pancakes, so we've been buying the boxed "just add water" stuff for awhile. I decided to try this instead since it looked so easy, and my oldest son chowed down as well. He's never eaten pancakes before, and he couldn't get enough of these. I still have a box of mix left so I used that instead of the flour, baking, powder, and baking soda. They still turned out great though!

I had some leftover Buttermilk from another recipe so thought I'd try some Buttermilk pancakes.  These are really good!  The batter was thicker than I'm used to but the pancakes are still delicious.  Also, it makes alot... I have half the batter left so I'm hoping it will last in the refrigerator and I'll cook the rest up fresh tomorrow morning.

These are mighty fine pancakes! Best made-from-scratch pancake I've ever made...light, fluffy, tender.  I had some buttermilk left over that I wanted to use up and decided to make these for breakfast.  I reduced the servings to 3, which still made too much for us, added a little extra milk as I thought the batter was too thick, but otherwise followed the directions as written.  Boyfriend says these are superior to our favorite boxed buttermilk pancake mix!

These are really good, just tried them for the first time today.  Next time I'll add a tablespoon of cornmeal for a little extra texture.  The texture is light and fluffy.  Highly recommend!

Delicious!  Great flavor!  They were a little thicker than I was hoping- I'll mess around with the amount of milk and maybe that will give me the crepe-y pancake I remember from my grandma's house!  I also did the 1 tbsp vineagar 1 cup of milk combo because I didn't have buttermilk- I'll try the real stuff next time.  Overall, a delicious and wonderful pancake.  Thanks!

These were pretty good, especially with rasberries and whipped cream. They weren't really any different from any other buttermilk pancake recipe though, and I think I'll go back to my old standby. I did add 1/4 teaspoon vanilla to these, and I would recommend not doing that, although they would be better with a little more salt--maybe 1 1/4 teaspoons instead of 3/4.

These pancakes would be great, as long as you do not add the full amount of baking soda that it calls for.  And considering the amount of ingredients, if you like your pancakes to be sweet, you need to add more than 3 tsp of sugar.  These were my only complaints, be sure to make the changes with the baking soda, because it was a very noticeable taste with every bite.

Very fluffy and tasty!  Scaled back to 8 servings and still made 10 5-inch pancakes.  I made recipe as is, without addition of vanilla and we thought they were very flavorful.  Will make again, the next time we are making buttermilk pancakes.

The texture and ease of making I definitely give 5 stars! The flavor was rather bland. I am planning on making another batch today and will add a bit of vanilla, as other commenters suggested.

These were fantastic! Very light and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness. I took the advice of another reviewer and added some vanilla which added to the taste perfectly. Will definitely be making these again and again!

Just ready to make another batch of these wonderful steaming, flavorful pancakes again this Sunday morning for my family!  Nothing tops it with real maple syrup.  My kids say that I make  the best pancakes, so does my friend all the way from Turkey!  She´s never tasted such a delight.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It is VERY rare that I find a recipe that I don't have to change at all.  This was out of this world good.  I added blueberries to some and chocolate chips to some as well.  PERFECT!  If the batter is too thick just slowly add a bit more milk.

These where okay, not "great". I had to add a lot  more milk then called for to get rid of the lumpiness in the batter. Also, the pancake's taste was really bland, next time I have to add alot more sugar then called for! However, the pancake did turn out really fluffy, it just needed a brighter taste. I added blueberries, which some-what added a nice touch. Good base recipe!

Our favorite pancake recipe by far!  I add vanilla & cinnamon.  If you wrap each pancake individually in plastic wrap & then bag in a freezer ziplock, you can take them out & pop them in the toaster so easily.  Perfect quick breakfast (taste great just dry too) for the kids!!

I made these pancakes to freeze for breakfasts.  They were awesome!  So fluffy!  I added 1.5 tsp. of vanilla extract to the recipe.  Wayyyyyyy better than any boxed or frozen pancake.

Best pancakes I've ever made!  I've always used sour milk (a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice for every cup of milk) instead of buttermilk but this time I actually had some on hand and what a difference it made!!! You have to use the real stuff! Definately the fluffiest! I added a splash of vanilla for extra flavor. They're also great with some cinnaman and nutmeg. Thanks for a great pancake recipe!

They were great!!!  The only ingredient I added was a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  My husband and daughters loved them!!!  I cooked them about 2-2 1/2 minutes per side on a griddle at a temperature of about 375.  They were great!!!

I make these at least twice a month on weekends! They always come out great, although my family likes thinner cakes, so I add a little more milk and buttermilk until I get it to the consistency we like. We usually add blueberries (frozen), too! Great!

Very light and fluffy. If you are serving a big crowd and need to double the recipe, take my advice and don't double the salt. Also, use actual buttermilk, rather than the milk-vinegar type. They weren't quite as fluffy and light when I tried it with that method.

Followed the directions to a T. Turned out great. It must be the amount of butter that sets this apart from other recipes I've tried.

Very good pancakes. Even though I only did one cup of Buttermilk and didn't notice my error until the first set of pancakes were on the griddle. Then I quickly took them out and added more buttermilk. I can't wait to try them again with the correct ingredients added as they are supposed to be added.

These pancakes were delish. I live in Switzerland and it's really hard to find pancakes in a restaurant for breakfast - but now I don't need to search anymore! I can't find buttermilk here so I used milk and lemon juice, I also added some vanilla sugar to sweeten it. Warning!! This recipe makes enough pancakes to feed an army - so we had pancakes 2 days in a row.

Were I come from (The netherlands) we never use buttermilk, baking powder or soda to bake pancakes. We use flour and milk. But this is so much better! 
Just follow the recipe exactly and enjoy...

My husband is crazy for these. He is never interested in grocery shopping, but now he makes sure that buttermilk is at the top of our list! Be very careful with this recipie--you may find yourself making it a lot! :-)

This is a really nice recipe for basic buttermilk pancakes. I like to cook them up and freeze them in zip bags so the family can serve themselves whenever they crave pancakes. Everyone likes them so much better than any of the store-bought frozen choices!

This recipe does make alot!  I like to freeze what we don't eat then pop them into the toaster or microwave on busy or lazy mornings.  I use a cookie scoop (about 3 T) for each pancake.  I tried a squeeze bottle one time but with the chemical reacations between the buttermilk, soda and powder it kind of expanded out of the bottle. Very light and fluffy and yummy

The competition was the usual brand name boxed buttermilk pancake mix that I have been eating since I was 5 years old. I had tasted the real thing on my last trip to Arizona and it was awesome. I trialed this recipe today and wow! delicious, no preservatives and additives, easy to make, and the that taste I remembered from my trip! the perfect consistency, I even had my husband flipping for me while I polished off mine!

I thought that it was a good recipe.  I did not understand how this is for just 12 pancakes.  It is alot, so if you don't need alot you may want to reduce the recipe.

I can't say they're not good, but they're definitely not any better than what I've always made.  The many ingredients (buttermilk AND milk AND butter) made the recipe sound so interesting, but we just weren't impressed.  Know that they do taste good, though!

this recipe was delicious!! I changed the 3 tblspoons of sugar to 3 tblspoons 
of honey.  I also added 1 teaspoon of imitation vanilla. I  did this because a few of the ratings had a concern with blandness. they were not bland at all.  light fluffy and tasty. one of my favorites!! Also i changed the buttermilk and the milk with (half & Half) for more flavor. I wrapped the letfovers in wax paper then foil ( which was all i had at the time and they  taste great. best i ever made!!

I have never been able to make good pancakes.  From a mix or scratch and this recipe came out PERFECT!  I will never make pancakes any other way.  They were thick and fluffy.  Like another reviewer said, don't worry about lumpy batter, mix the ingredients until just wet and don't overmix.  They  come out perfectly.   Thanks for this great and easy recipe!

Well, pancakes are my all time favorite meal and I have always been on the search for the perfect recipe. I have tried everything from Bisquick to Aunt Jemima, from Betty Crocker to the IHOP secret recipe -  and this one is definately the winner! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the sugar - I like lots of butter and syrup on the finished product so I only put 2TBSP of sugar in the actual batter. They were fluffy and rich and I can't wait to try and make this recipe as waffles!!

I was disappointed after trying this recipe, especially after reading the excellent reviews it received. They did come out very fluffy, but very bland tasting!

I messed these up, although they still turned out okay.

I scaled the recipe in half (to 6) which called for 1 1/2 eggs.  I didn't know to use 1 or 2, so used 2.

I didn't have buttermilk so substituted 1 cup skim milk with 1 T lemon juice and let it sit for 5 mins (so for 1 1/2 cups I used 1 1/2 T).  When I whisked the wet ingredients, I think the lemon juice "cooked" the egg.  Although you couldn't tell once they were cooked.  

My batter was very very runny (maybe because of the skim milk?) and I ended up adding about 1/3 cup extra flour.  

My first several pancakes were runny, thin, and had an uneven edge.  By the last few pancakes I had adjusted the flour and made them a bit better, but they were still fairly unattractive.  But they did have alot better flavor than the mix.  Because of all the rave reviews I will try this again with real buttermilk, whole milk, and the original amount.

I had some buttermilk left over from a cake that I made, but didn't want to just throw it out. I searched for a recipe that involved buttermilk and came upon this one. I usually make pancakes from a mix. When I served these to my kids, they could taste the difference! They even asked for more, which they never do! I would definately scale it way down next time, I had lots of left over batter.

These didn't turn out quite right for me.  They have a good buttermilk flavor but they didn't cook up too good.  There is another pancake recipe I reviewed that is much better!

Perfect pancakes.  I make just a half batch since my family is just 2 adults and a toddler, and it scales beautifully.  Light, fluffy, golden....a fantastic way to start (or end, as we often do) any day!

I used whole wheat flour, lowfat buttermilk, and added raspberries.  These pancakes were a real hit with the family.  They were light, yet wholesome.  Two pancakes filled me up and were very satisfying.

These were good.  I took the advice of others and upped the flour by a scant 1/4 cup. I may add a little less than that next time........maybe just a few Tablespoons.  Also didn't have buttermilk and did the 1 T lemon juice w/ milk trick.

I have made these a lot and we love them. When my husband is away on business my kids love breakfast for dinner and this recipe has become an almost weekly staple. I make them as directed (occasionally scaling back to make less) and they come out perfect every time.

Yummy!  This recipe makes a whole bunch of fluffy, tender pancakes.  I made just two small changes: I substituted vegetable oil for the melted butter (because I was out of butter), and increased the sugar to 1/4 cup.  This recipe fed three people until they were about to burst, and still had about 12 pancakes left.  They were very quick and easy to make - no one should ever have to use a mix once they have this recipe.

Although these looked and smelled good, there was a lingering taste of baking powder. I thought I had accidentally added extra baking powder the first time I made these pancakes, so I was extra careful in following the recipe the second time. But there's still too much of it and it spoiled the taste for me. I agree with the other reviewers that the pancakes aren't sweet enough.
I shall try these again with and reduce the baking powder by a spoonful.

There is a reason why everyone gave this recipe a 5 star rating...it's that darn good!!  A slight crispness on the outside, and light and fluffy on the inside.  I have made homemade pancakes for over 25 years and decided to try this recipe (after all...over 334 people gave it five stars!), and I'm so glad I did. This is my new buttermilk pancake recipe, but if you don't mind, I won't tell anyone where I got it!!!  Thanks bunches!!!

These were the absolute best pancakes ever!! I halved the recipe and still had too much batter so will make even less next time for just the 2 of us. I cooked the first few too hot and they weren't done on the inside so I'll cook slower next time. Incredibly delicious!!!

Fabulous! I've been making these for a while substituting the buttermilk (using the milk and lemon juice technique) - but today I had real buttermilk on hand. They were wonderful before, today they were even better -if that's possible, coming out big and fluffy. I used to scale back to 4 servings but now make 12 and refrig or freeze for later. This is my favorite recipe from this site.

Very good indeed.These came out so light and fluffy that their worthy of REAL maple syrup.I could even taste the slight tang of the buttermilk,I wasn't expecting that at all.The only thing I'll do different next time would be to halve the recipe (way too much batter just for myself)and to cook over medium heat.Medium high was way too hot,the first pancake I made turned out on the verge of being burnt.

Oh my goodness, everyone NEEDS these pancakes.  I am sure the recipe left alone would be good but here's what I did to make it a little more healthy.  2 of the cups of flour I make whole wheat flour, I used lowfat butter milk and milk, and I substituted the butter with unsweatened apple sauce.  They were so fluffy, they just melted in your mouth.  SOOOOO GOOD

This is a great recipe and makes better-than-restaurant-quality pancakes.  They are very light, fluffy, tender, and full of flavor.

Btw, I used low-fat buttermilk, skim milk, and light margarine and could not tell a difference from when I made it with the full-fat recipe.

I think these are extremely overrated... While they were good, they just didn't knock my socks off! Maybe it was because I used the reduced fat buttermilk? Besides that I didn't change anything except to add a bit more sugar. I am also comparing them to pancakes from a fabulous pancake resturaunt back home that's been around for around 30 years, and has really incredible pancakes. They justs didn't have the fluffy texture and rich flavor i'm looking for! Maybe sometime i'll try again with regular buttermilk, if I don't find anything better.

My husband is exceptionally picky when it comes to pancakes and he enjoyed these very much. I tossed blueberries in...yum yum! We both agreed that next time I make these will will double up on the sugar.

I cut the recipe in half and it made more than enough pancakes for my family of four. The kids will be thrilled to have leftovers!

i needed a couple of easy do ahead breakfasts & after reading through many reviews, leaned toward tambalina's advice (5/21/05) on adding a little lemon juice & extra spoonful of sugar to the batter then letting it rest for future use. the pancakes came out very tasty & light. i also substituted half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour (my preference). this recipe yielded 18 5-inch pancakes. thanks lebury!

This was an excellent recipe. I loved the taste of the pancakes and they were extremely light and fluffy. Do be prepared to feed a lot of people or freeze some pancakes because this makes a lot. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These pancakes are great!  I didn't have any fresh buttermilk on hand, so I used powdered buttermilk instead and they still turned out light and fluffy.  I'll be using this recipe again!

My 18 yr old son wanted to try making pancakes from scratch and chose this recipe, which made him beam with satisfaction. Could make batches (homemade pancake mix!) of the dry mix and add buttermilk powder to this - keep refridgerated, and use water later with the wet stuff accordingly. A touch of vanilla flavouring went well with this. Thanks, Lebury.

Light, fluffly, tasty, and they were not flat at all, they raised pretty well.
I did add some cinnamon and a few drops of vanilla extract though.

Great pancakes. Not overly sweet, since you only use 3 T of sugar, which is nice since syrup is so sweet. These pancakes are a little spongy, and they taste more like restaurant pancakes than most I've tried. I topped some with syrup and some with strawberries and both were great. Also, they re-heat well in the toaster oven. Try these, you won't be disappointed.

This is a very good basic pancake recipe that I will use in the future instead of mix.   The recipe did yield a lot though so I only made it to serve 4 stead of 12 and it was plenty.

These were very, very good! Big fluffy pancakes! Great Sunday morning breakfast. I used Egg Beaters instead of regular eggs since hubby is trying to watch his cholesterol. I'm going to trying cutting the recipe in half next time I make it cause that was way to much for just the two of us. The dogs were delighted in the extras though.

This recipe makes fantastic pancakes. I wisk all the dry ingredients together thoroughly before stirring them into the wet ingredients. This adds more air to the batter and reduces the time I have to mix the batter.

My kids and I really enjoyed this! They turned out light and fluffy and had an eggy flavor that I liked. I did not have buttermilk so I added vinegar to whole milk. I also used 4 eggs because I only had medium size. I added a capful of vanilla extract and used chocolate pieces when cooking. These would be really great with banana, apple or cinnamon flavor, too!

I tried this recipe once before with regular milk instead of buttermilk and gave it a negative review.  This time I made it with buttermilk and it blew me away!  The pancakes rose high and fluffy and were so, so moist.  Just like restaurant pancakes.  Awesome!

My family loves this recipe. The only problem is it is too thick so it makes it hard to get done in the middle so I cut down the buttermilk to 1 2/3 cup and 2/3 cup milk.

Great recipe!  Hubby said they were the best!  I scaled the recipe down to 4 and it was perfect for the three of us (hubby likes double his serving of pancakes when I fix them).  I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted 1 cup 2% milk with 1T vinegar.  Still came out just perfect!  Thanks!

Very good pancakes.  I used buttermilk, though it was not "fresh" buttermmilk.  Skim milk for the 1/2 cup of milk portion.    Makes some sizable and tasty pancakes.

Great recipe!  For the kids I scale the recipe to 4 servings.  I make it  with regular milk (2 % or skim depending on what I have in the fridge) with a tablespoon or two of vinegar added to it.  My kids love it, and hubby said they were the best pancakes he's had in a long time.  He grew up on Aunt Jemima box mix.

This recipe is great! The pancakes DID come out very fluffy. I added a tablespoon of vanilla flavoring which made them even more tasty.

Wonderful recipe!  These taste just like IHOP pancakes.  I was concerned at first about the butter clumping up when mixed with the buttermilk, but this was not a problem in the end.  I used an ungreased non-stick skillet and they came out just fine.  I was also worried that the batter was too thick, but the pancakes came out great.

The first thing you have to realize is that there is no buttermilk in this country. Quite the conundrum, wouldn't you say? We made do with runny yogurt, but the pancakes were not fluffy and had a crepe like texture to them. Sort of dense, actually. Still, they tasted just fine and were great served with canned fruit when you can't find budget friendly syrup. All in all, we will probably try this recipe again, perhaps with sour milk.

Great recipe.  I didn't have any buttermilk handy, so I substituted with two cups of fruit yogurt (peach) and one cup of 2% milk.  I also reduced sugar to 2T.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly and these came out great.  I was a little worried that the batter was so thick, but after the first one came off the pan, I knew it was a go.  Thanks!

I used fresh buttermilk from a local farm, and these were still a mess.  By the time the middle was cooked, the outside was black.  I finally had to water it down with some milk, and then they were better, but still not spectacular.

Great recipe!  I increased it by half and used egg substitute. The last few pancakes were just a tad "eggy" but I could have easily prevented that by stirring through the batter once or twice as I was cooking them to prevent the egg from settling to the bottom.

Excellent!  The recipe makes much more than 12 pancakes, more like 24 is right.  I froze the remaining batter, don't know if that will work, but we'll see.  What did I have to lose at that point?  Great recipe!

Delicious!!  This recipe is definitley a keeper.  I made breakfast for dinner as my daughter requested and my family loved these pancakes.  I scaled the recipe down to 8 and still had a lot left over - maybe since I also made scrambled eggs and bacon.  I finished making all of the batter at night and just reheated the pancakes in the morning the next day.  Sure made for an easy breakfast on a school day.

Delicious. I used all milk with a little lemon in it and let stand to get room temp and the egg too. The pancakes cooked up nice about 2 1/2" in diameter. They were good the next day out of the refridgerator too.

Best pancakes I have ever made from scratch. I only had 2 cups of buttermilk so I substituted regular 2% milk for the 3rd, then the 1/2 cup regular also. Ended up adding another 1 cup of milk after trying one and finding it was rather thick.. it still tasted excellent, but thinner's our preference. This recipe also makes a lot of pancakes. After thinning it, I'd say it's almost 24 servings rather than the 12 listed. 
    Our 2 year old little girl loved these pancakes also.

This was a GREAT recipe!  My family loved it and the description was bang on - tasty, light and fluffy!  This is a keeper.  This recipe makes a LOT of pancakes - I kind of forgot to look at the amount of servings of 12!  But not a problem, now my freezer is filled with nummy pancakes ready to eat at any time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Lebury!

this recipe makes delicious, fluffy pancakes.  i really liked how they turned out, but they only taste really good right after you make them.  i only made 1/3 of the original recipe and added a little cinnamon and vanilla for flavor.  next time, i think i mite try adding some maple syrup to the batter to sweeten them up even more

This recipe tastes so good you won't care about anything else.  They are a bit thin- esp the last two that I cooked.  Next time, I think I will omit the plain milk.  FOr the record, though, my husband said don't change a thing, my 12-yr old "shovel it down" actually noticed and requested these again, and my 2-yr old who does not eat pancakes had an entire one to herself.  Yuuuuuum!

Such a good pancake recipe. I, too, substituted home-made buttermilk (1 Tablespoon of white vinegar per cup of whole milk) and the pancakes were still very good. I did add one teaspoon of vanilla and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg.  A keeper!

Wow these were good!  My very first time making pancakes (never even tried a mix) and it was too easy.  They weren't quite as good as IHOP, but I guess that's why they have a restaraunt serving pancakes and I don't!  Could have been a bit sweeter and will add some sugar the next round.

My daughter had a sleepover last night and they wanted pancakes this morning.  I had no mix so I went here and picked this one.  I had no buttermilk so I used my King Arthur powdered buttermilk to make 3 cups.  I also added 1 T. of vanilla.  These are by far the BEST pancakes I have ever had.  I will NEVER buy mix again.  Next time I think I will halve the recipe.  Great recipe!

Heaven!  Substituted wheat pastry flour for 1/2 the all-pupose.  Also used light buttermilk and "I can't believe it's not butter-light"  Will throw out all pancake recipes!  This is the one.

This is the best pancake recipe ever!  Turns out everytime.  One time I didn't have buttermilk so I used the whole milk that I had on hand and replaced 1/8th of the milk with lemon juice.  Worked out just as well!  These pancakes MAKE our Sunday breakfasts!  Barb in Vancouver BC

Excellent!!!!! It was a bit thick so had to thin it out with a little more milk to a slightly thinner consistency for my taste. Tried with and without vinalla flavoring and both taste great. Thanks!!!!

The recipe was very easy to make and I would give 5 stars except for the fact that the pancakes had a bit of a lemony taste. We think it was from the buttermilk (which was fresh). The pancakes were light and fluffy.

This recipe is awesome! My 11 year old daughter and I made it, and we could not believe how delicious these pancakes were! I have tried many pancake recipes from scratch with disappointing results, but these turned out perfectly...light and fluffy with just a hint of sweetness.  This recipe will definitely go in my "best of the best" file.

Very good, but the batter made WAY too much for myself, myself, and my daughter, and we all are fairly big eaters.  We refrigerated the leftovers and had another meal a few days later.  Scale the recipe if you just want one meal.

These were great!  This was my first time making buttermilk pancakes, and they were so fluffy.  The recipe makes alot of pancakes.  I'll defintely ba making these again when I do have buttermilk on hand.  I recommend these to everyone who loves pancakes.

Wonderful pancakes. My mom always made buttermilk pancakes as part of our annual easter morning breakfast. Not spending the easter morning with her this year, I wanted to carry on the tradition. Not quite as good as "moms" but they were delicious! Serve with "sauteed apples" from this site and you've got a winning combination to start your day right! Thank you Lebury!

I rated these a 5 at the request of my son. I didn't like them as well as I thought I would after reading the reviews. Other members of my family thought they were great, but they were a little on the flat side for my liking. I like a pancake that is nice and full and fluffy. But I couldn't stand my sons dissapointed face when I told him I wasn't rating it a 5, so that's what I did. The taste was good, especially with the blueberries I had added to the batter, just not fluffy enough.

I had previously only used different supermarket pancake mixes. I tried a couple of pancake recipes on this website which were not nearly as good as this one. These are very light, fluffy and just right in sweetness. Even had these for "midnight breakfast".

These pancakes are great!  They are very yummy and very easy.  They're not too dry, and they taste good enough to have without syrup.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

When we can get buttermilk (we live in the UK and it is not readily available), these are the pancakes we make!

This recipe was excellent!  I had read where you could substitute baby food prunes for butter so I tried it to cut fat.  I know it sounds gross, but it worked really well!  You could not tell the difference, however the pancakes did look a little darker, somewhat like I added wheat flour, but the taste was still wonderful with less fat!!

Absolutey hands down, the best pancake recipe I have ever tasted.  My family LOVED these and this recipe will be used over and over again.  No more boxed mixes in our home!  Light, fluffy yet dense pancake that is great with additions, too.  I've tried blueberries, bananas and chocolate chips and they always come out a winner.  Original recipe makes WAY more than 12 pancakes.  Definite keeper!!

I'd prefer less butter in the recipe, but the texture was pretty good. (Used Earth Balance non-hydrogenated) Used a flax seed mixture in place of the eggs, soyamilk for the milk, and made my "buttermilk" with soyamilk and lemon juice. As for the flavor, I'm going to experiment with the recipe. Maybe a splash of vanilla would help.

I used powdered buttermilk because I had some on hand and I whipped the egg whites before mixing the rest of the wet ingredients for added 'fluffiness'.  The pancakes were delicious!  With warm maple syrup the were perfectly sweet - in other words, not too sweet.

I am a pancake fanatic.  I sample and rate pancakes everywhere I go.  These are BY FAR the best pancakes I have ever made from scratch.  I add about a half cup of heavy whipping cream to the recipe and that makes them taste almost like the pancakes at the Original House of Pancakes!!  Now if I could only find a syrup worthy of putting on top of these delicious cakes!

I took all the ingredients with me on a camping trip last weekend. We had 20 people and they all were raving how delicious the pancakes were. I am now official 'camp cook'. I scaled the recipe for 20 and it worked out perfectly. I was a little short on the buttermilk, but just added a little more milk. one thing I noticed was the batter appeared to go 'flat' by the time I cooked the last couple of pancakes. You couldnt taste a difference , but they were less fluffy.

It's time to cake up with this recipe!  This is the most tastey buttermilk pancake any of the boys have had. It's a sad day in the fire hall when we don't have time to make them.  Try adding a bit more sugar for a sweeter cake.

Pancakes was requested for breakfast and I didn't have my usual box mix so I decided to make from scratch.  I can't believe I has always bought box mixes when these taste sooo much better.  This recipe does make alot.  Also another hint is to not make the pancakes to big as they will be hard to flip.  Have added this to my recipe box!

Haven't tried these for the grandchildren yet, but my husband and I enjoyed them.  The only disappointment was that I saved the leftover batter and when I went to use it the next weekend, it was moldy.  Another recipe suggested that the batter would keep so I was hoping this one would also.  Maybe it would for a day or two, but I don't have a chance to cook a pancake breakfast that often.  We were happy with the taste and texture of this recipe.  Be careful pouring too much batter at oncee, the more batter the bigger the pancake, and the harder to flip.  These were picture perfect. KUDOS.

What I did not like about these pancakes is that they were not as fluffy as I had expected.  They were a little dense and heavy.  Although I liked the taste, two were enough for me.  Some pancakes I don't get sick of.  These, however, satiated me very quickly.  I do not mind that.  That way I eat less.  At this point I am not going to blame the recipe.  Whatever was wrong with them could have very well been the cooks fault.  I will try making them again. They were fun to make. I had never made homemade pancakes.  My children loved them.  They must have eaten six each.  They snitched them from the refrigerator when I was not looking.

My husband disliked pancakes until I made this batter and brought it up to a cabin we had for the weekend. We all really enjoyed them! The recipe, however, does not include using all of the ingredients. I just added them...also, I covered the batter and kept it in the refrigerator and they were still great.

This is the best pancake recipe!!  I do have a word of caution, you will have to throw your pancake mix away!!  Your family won't eat them anymore after they have had these!!
