Great recipe, but I see what the prior poster meant by "unfinished." I left out the onions (hate em') and tweaked the sauce a little. I used the pumpkin and cream idea as a base, and made a slightly thinner, creamier sauce with sour cream and cream cheese instead of heavy cream. I also added olive oil, kept the garlic, plus added milk, chicken stock, Trader Joe's pumpkin butter, crushed fennel, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and ginger to taste. The result was a creamy, delicious sauce that was absolutely amazing, with a rich pumpkin flavor. Ok, so I tweaked the recipe a LOT, but the pumpkin sauce base found here was my inspiration to build this great sauce. Served with a side of baked herb bread, and a glass of Italian red wine - PRIMO!

I was soooo excited about this receipe...but I agree with previous reviews it definately lacks something.  Tried a few suggestions from below, but still wasn't quite what I was looking for.  will not make again.

Very very tasty. I took a few liberties with seasonings, but mostly followed the recipe :) I used fresh ginger instead of ground, and cooked it with the sausage and extra onion and garlic. Also my sausage was sage flavored. I added a dollop of sour cream to the sauce, along with parsley, a little ground ginger, some rosemary and a bit of sage. Turned out very good, thanks for the recipe! UPDATE: Made this again with turkey breakfast sausage, very good!

I liked this recipie but modified it somewhat.  After I sauteed the sausage, onion and garlic, I added chicken stock for another layer of flavor....let it reduce before adding the cream and pumkin puree....I also added freshly grated nutmeg and chopped sage at the end as well as topped with freshly grated parmasean.  My husband loved the flavor, but thought it was still a little thick...would thin with pasta water last minute next time.

It's not bad, just unfinished. It needs something and being a novice, I have no idea what it could be!  It's dry with just the pumpkin and the cream to make the sauce, you can't taste the pumpkin and I'm definitely missing a chunky vegitable because of it.  With the noodles and italian sausage, it almost seems natural to add tomatoes, and maybe a can of diced tomatoes is all it needs, but I'd really like to see someone bring out the pumpkin flavor and create a better sauce.  Until then, I won't be using this recipe again!  Good luck!!

Wow, this was so good! I used whole wheat pasta, fat free milk, and I added some fresh spinach to make it healthier. I doubled the amount of garlic and cream and it was amazing, can't wait to make it again!

I had received a can of pumpkin puree in a care package from my mom and had no idea what to make since I didn't have pie crust and sure didn't feel like making some.  This is similar to a Rachael Ray recipe and I kind of combined them both.  I added 1/8 tsp clove, 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg (it is the secrete to the sauce...don't leave out nutmeg) and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  (I think I lessened the amount of ginger because of the additional spices.)  I also added dried sage, 2 tsp of it.  (The sage with sausage and pumpkin is amazing.)  I followed Rachael Ray's idea of adding chicken stock and white wine to loosen the sauce.  (2 tbls of heavy cream just isn't enough liquid for this to be a creamy sauce.)  It was super tasty and I'm surprised there were left overs the way my boyfriend was eating it.  I will certainly make it again with my changes.  (I only gave it 4 stars because I did make a lot of changes for it to be as good as it was.)

OK not the best-looking dish I've ever made but it tasted good!  We debated if this should be 3 stars or 4, my husband kept saying 3.5.  It was decent comfort food on a night when we wanted something simple that we didn't need to go to the store for any ingredients.  Happened to have sausage in the freezer and had just bought a can of pumpkin.  Added white wine, crushed red pepper, sage, a sprinkle of nutmeg, and a dollop of cream cheese.  It worked out OK!

I made this without sausage. I added some red pepper flake, which gave it a nice kick. Yummy.

Looking at this dish on my stove, I thought it was going to be terrible...not going to lie, it was okay.  I added a can of chicken broth and used about 4 tbs cream, but it was still really thick.  Maybe I bought the wrong pumpkin stuff.  I think this recipe could be really good if there is a good chef out there to fix it.  Sadly, I am not that chef.

This sauce turned out pretty good, although I took quite a few liberties with it: I made it vegetarian and substituted lima and garbanzo beans for the sausage, I used a combination of plain yogurt and cream cheese instead of cream, and I mixed in some parmesan cheese at the end.

This recipe is very good. I used sage sausage instead of the sweet italian sausage, and I did't have any cream so I used milk. Mine turned out a little dry  so next time I will use a little more milk to thin it out even more. Otherwise it's very good and I will be making it for my husband again.

Thanks to prior posts I knew this wasn't going to be done on its own. It was more like a paste than a sauce. I used 1/2 cup of half and half, 1 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 plain yogurt. It was delicious! I nixed the sausage (I don't like it) but next time I'll add in chicken along with some spinach to give it color
