These turned out pretty tasty after I made a couple of changes.  I doubled the flour and sugar, because the batter was WAY too thin.  After reading the reviews, I also added 1 Tbs of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp baking powder.  Still not exactly what we're looking for (a donut shop type apple fritter), but still good enough that we ate them all!

The base batter was easy to make but a little plain.  I added 2 tbsps of cinnamon to the batter and then more on top with powdered sugar.
I also cubed the apples to make the fritters come out easier.

Good.  I doubled the recipe, except for the eggs, added 1/4 tsp baking soda and some cinnamon

It was not at all what I was hoping...it was like a pancake filled with apples...my husband liked them a lot, however,  I thought it would crisp up more than it did...probably operator error and not the recipe itself...I added a tsp and a half of Apple Pie Spice since a few suggested cinnamon.

Not too bad. I used a banana instead of apples. I also used soymilk and lemon juice, only because that is what I had on hand. Great taste, but after frying, I think the batter could be a bit thicker. I'll add more flour next time. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good taste, but too thick with apples for me.  I doubled the flour and sugar like someone suggested, and added cinnamon, but the texture of the batter is just not what I'm looking for.  Looking for more donut type.

I really liked this!  I was looking for a recipe that was like my grandmother's, and this was as close as I needed.  I stayed true to the original recipe, and the batter was light & crispy -- almost like a tempura.  Some reviewers were disappointed because this is not the typical 'donut shop' fritter, but that's not what I think of when I think fritter.  I think of a flatter, lighter item.  In this case, to keep it from becoming an 'apple pancake,' I used a cookie scoop to drop the batter.  I scooped up mainly apples chunks (coarsely chopped 1/2" chunks), then drizzled the batter enough to make it the fritter.  I also used coconut oil which gave it an interesting flavor.  After I flipped it once in the pan I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar over it.  After cooking I transferred to a plate with paper towels on it, and sprinkled powdered sugar on it.  Served w/warm maple syrup.

Wonderful flavour, however when recipe was doubled, we found it was too 'eggy'. Perhaps I used extra large eggs (don't remember), and the mixture became too liquid and fritter was flatter than it should have been.

I concur with the apple pancake post; or apple kibbles.  Tripled the recipe, diced apples small, less egg - and still apple pancakes to be followed by pieces of apple in fried batter.  It did taste fine.

Have made it a few times now and am finding if I double everything but eggs it works and plus I add about a half a shot of Rye to the lemon juice i put on the apples and mix it around.  Last time I made it, I used apples and banana's in the same batter

Great and easy for a quick snack. Everyone enjoyed them. Did add extra cinnamon and sugar. Will make again soon.

Pretty Good recipe. I ended up using a cup of flour and 3Tbsp of sugar but that was a little thick so i added a little more milk just under 1/4 cup extra also i added about 1 tsp of cinnamon to add flavour and sprinkled the end result with cinnamon sugar. I also used a lot more oil to cook it in to make it more like a deep fry, I think this may have helped get it nice and crispy. Overall flavour was nice, Fritter was a little firm, Apples were a little firm but it was still pretty good.  p.s. i scraped all the leftover batter out of the bowl and fried it on its own then coated it with cinnamon sugar and it was delicious :)

I like that this recipe is more apple than flour. I am gluten sensitive so using a recipe ready gluten free flour is best when the recipe's flavor doesn't rely on the flour! I bump it up with cinnamon too. Great recipe.
