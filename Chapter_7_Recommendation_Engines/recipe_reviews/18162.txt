With my one modification, I give this recipe 4 stars (I'd give it 5, but this change is necessary.)  As other readers complained of dryness, I added a heaping 1/2 cup of shredded zucchini.  This moisture cured the dryness issue...just add about 10 minutes more baking time.  Simple and delicious.  I made this for a labor day gathering and everyone loved it.  I wish that I made 2, because it was gone in a flash.

A very dry recipe, more cake-like.  Needs icing.

Overall, these tasted very good and looked very pretty with the pecans sprinkled on top.  I do agree with the first reviewer in that the consistency was more cake-like.  This is very easy and quick to make.  Suitable for serving to company with ice cream and caramel or chocolate syrup.  Also, I had a few recipe deviations --used reduced fat Bisquick and 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the 1 oz chocolate pieces.

This was quick and easy. If you are desperate for a chocolate dessert and have run out of flour(I was, needed brownies for church function, and hadn't been shopping, sick kid at home), these are ok. It was the only recipe I could find with no flour using semi- sweet chocolate. The middle was cakelike, but I preferred the ends which were crusty & chewy. It was not too sweet (some brownies are so rich & sickeningly sweet that you can't eat more than a sliver). My kids liked it. I prefer moist,fudgier brownies with a chewier texture and more chocolate flavor. I entered these in a brownie competition at church to benefit charity. I did not win, but I liked these better than the 2nd place winner! 
I noticed that the recipe does not give an amount for the nuts. I used 1/2 cup broken pecans. Later I looked up the Bisquick recipe and that asks for 3/4 cup chopped nuts. It also says use butter or margarine softened,& sweet cooking chocolate. The results may have been different had I used butter,more nuts,sweet chocolate and packed the 1/2 cup brown sugar. This recipe bailed me out but, bottom line, if I had flour and unsweetened chocolate I would choose to make a different brownie recipe.

This was delicious and very easy to make. Not dry at all if you don't overbake it.  Like brownies, you can take it out when the edges start to dry & the middle is not quite done.
