This would probably be better as a pound cake, leaving out the streusel.  I used almost twice as much brown sugar and cinnamon as it called for and still didn't get much of a streusel taste.  It was good, just not a real streusel kind of cake.

Just made this cake.  Followed the recipe to the letter. Sorry, but not good.
