Followed the recipe pretty closely.  Had to broil the shrimp because of weather.  Made half as much dressing as called for, and it was plenty.  Added more veggies to the salad.  Served with crackers and Borealis white wine.

I have made this twice. I made no changes to this recipe. My husband love it.   The leftover dressing is also delightful on a grilled hamburger or green salad.

Once again Chef John has graced us with a restaurant quality recipe! I didn't change a thing. My husband took one bite and asked me to make this again, often!

Really loved the flavor and combo of stuff in the salad. Be careful with the cayenne 'garnish', things can get too spicy easily. I used the 9.5 minute soft boiled egg method, worked well but 2 exploded, so must have been too strong a boil.

Very satisfying salad. Fairly quick to make too. Took me just over an hour to put this together pretty much as Chef John recommends.

Made this for Sunday dinner. Followed the recipe exactly except subbed heavy cream for creme fresh. I was worried that there were not many vegetables in the salad but it didn’t need them. Grilled the shrimp. Next time I may add a little more lemon before I grill. Don’t cheap out and use store bought thousand island dressing. It’s all about the sauce!! Thumbs up all the way around our dinner table!

This was a really good salad.  A bit pricey and a little more work. Tasty but i had enough by the end.

Yum! 

This actually works well with the tiny pink shrimp too-- I ran warm water over the frozen little shrimp to thaw them; once thawed, I just sprinkled the lemon and seasoning on and proceeded according to recipe. YUM!

I love shrimp and crab Louie's. The dressing was just right to compliment the grilled shrimp. Awesome recipe.

This was nice, but I found the dressing to be a little thick.
