I did not add the chile peppers only because I knew that my husband and kids would not like them. Instead of making appetizers out of this recipe, I actually made this into lunch wraps for my family by adding leaf lettuce and sliced tomatoes layered over the spread mixture. Everyone loved these, even my husband called me from work and asked me to make this again tomorrow. GREAT change from your everyday lunch plus it was cheap to make and counted as a meatless meal!

Everyone loved these little delights. I added crushed red peppers and cayenne pepper to give it a little more kick. I also nixed the cupcake liners and displayed them on a platter with the chopped green pepper sprinkled all over the tortillas and the platter. Gorgeous!

This is really good, quick & easy! With that said I think this recipe is a great base to start with and you can add or delete what you want. I used black bean refried beans mixed with taco seasoning and a little salsa, added some shredded cheddar on top of the beans and the cream cheese guacamole mixture on top of that. Yummy! Oh yes, the cream cheese guacamole mixture is a genius idea, tastes great and keeps the guacamole from turning that unappealing brown color..

Pretty good, however a little too mushy.
