This is a great and very flavorful recipe for fried chicken.  I always soak my chicken in salt water first to get the blood out.  It make the chicken a lot more aestheically pleasing.

I tried this recipe and I thought it was pretty good but dry. I mixed the flour with the parmasean cheese and the spices because the recipe directions doesn't tell you what to do with the flour. After fixing the chicken I think that you should probably dredge the chicken in the flour and then in the milk and then in the bag with the spices.

This recipe did not turn out at all like a good fried chicken. the batter hardly stuck to the chicken at all and it was basically just chicken tenders with no batter. the batter also tasted like straight parmesan cheese.

I tried this recipe very helpful but I used 2 eggs scrambled mixed with a little seasoning salt in place of the milk. It helps the mixture turn into a very crunchy, flavorful skin. Also the salt should be at least 1 tsp to give a good southern flavor.

My son used to say that I cooked the best fried chicken but I think this recipe is better. I think it's the parmesan cheese that makes it so delicious.

I found it very flavorful, but did have to re-dip the chicken in milk and then back in the mixture to get a good coating.

This was the best recipe where the crust actually stayed on the chicken legs.  Panko bread crumbs are the best.  Did not add the salt.  Next time (and there will be one) will up the garlic and onion powders.  Maybe even add some red pepper flakes.

While this isn't the best fried chicken I've ever had, it was perfect for what I needed!  I was out of eggs and cornstarch and buttermilk (what kind of cook am I?) so that pretty much ruled out all of the other recipes.  We tossed them in bbq sauce and dipped in ranch as a football game appetizer.  I double dipped between milk/crumb mixture as many reviewers suggested, and there was plenty of breading after fried.  Yum!

Wonderful!  I took the advice and boiled first.  Chicken was very moist.  
I also added a little Franks Sauce to the milk to give a little extra kick!

This is my first review of a recipe on this site. 

This is a great recipe.  I have been trying a lot of Fried Chicken recipes and could not get the flavor i was looking for. I used Bisquick instead of flour because i ran out of Flour.  That's a man for you. I did not use cut up chicken but rather used chiken breast cut into strips for chicken fingers.  I did not have any Onion powder but other than that it was very tasty.

Mmmm! My favorite recipe! When I'm done I pour off all the frying oil except a tablespoon and the use the leftover breading mixture to create a roux with the crispy bits in the pan for a simple gravy. Add milk and heat till thickened and you have the perfect stipplin' gravy for use on mashed spuds or a little rice as a side dish.

Made this last night and it was the best fried chicken I've ever made. I made a couple of changes:  I beat two eggs, dipped the chicken in the milk then the eggs then the coating.  I then did the process all over again resulting in a double coat. I did not have poultry seasoning, so I left it out. Instead of onion powder, I used the dried minced onions I had on hand. My husband and sons loved it. Highly recommend!

Followed recipe as suggested however, I dredged in milk and coating twice before I placed in frying pan.  Is absolutely delicious. Crunchy on the outside and juicy inside. Used only thighs due to it was the only chicken I had on hand. Will use this recipe as a staple for fried chicken in the future. Perhaps adding chili flakes or cayenne in coating for some extra kick.

I've tried different recipes for fried chicken and haven't really liked one. This one was rated a 5 star recipe from my husband. My picky kids also ate them! I took everyone's advice and double dipped as well as added more seasoning. Turned out nice and crunchy. Will be making this again!

for the people that couldnt get the batter to stick try frying it in a skillet for 5 mins. at a time and then re-dipping them. a lot of effort but worth it.

Followed the basic recipe making some changes as needed for our dietary restrictions.  (Different spices and coconut milk) I did double dip the chicken tenders.  My husband said they were the best he had ever had.  Tried the breading on zucchini last night, delicious!  This will go into our regular rotation.

I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed Ritz crackers.  One tube is the perfect amount called for in this recipe. I also used bone-in chicken thighs instead of tenders because that's what I had on hand so I cooked them for 8 minutes per side. My family loved it!

This was great. I used Panko bread crumbs. I breaded all my chicken and let it sit in the fridge for a bit before I fried it up. Wasn't a single piece left. Will make again without a doubt.
