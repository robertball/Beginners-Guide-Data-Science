These turned out well. I used a Misto can with olive oil and sprayed directly onto the potatoes. Then sprinkled the spices over them. If you lay a chop stick on both sides of the potato, they are easier to cut without cutting all the way thru accidentally.

I made these potatoes the other night with pork chops, they were wonderful, put some sour cream and  bacon bits on the top.  I will definitely be making these again.

I used what seasonings I had on hand. Garlic salt, celery seed, and added dried parsley to the paprika and oregano. I did not use the cheese because of dietary restrictions. I used russets and had no trouble slicing them thin. I put them in a ziplock bag with the seasoning mix and let it sit a couple hours. Baked as directed, brushing with leftover oil mix and an extra sprinkle of salt at the halfway point. They were perfection. Loved them. The centers were tender and the outside crisp and deliciously seasoned.

The idea of chopping up the potatoes like this is very cute. It was nearly impossible to season the potatoes since I decided not to shake them in a bag. I thought they'd break apart if I did that. They came out kind of toasted. And dry. 

If I figure out a way to change the mechanics of actually preparing them, I may make them again.

It wasn't worth the trouble of making them. :/

Good look and good taste ! I think that the essential success tip is to slice the potatoes REALLY thinly. Personally I peeled them first, and I didn't use a bag but just pour the oil and used the spices at my own taste without measuring.

I made two different types at the same time.  The first I followed the recipe and my husband Loved it.  The crispy/tender combination was wonderful and the flavor was Outstanding.  

The second potato I baked, following the
recipe until done, added craft cheese singles and baked until they melted, added butter and sour cream and it was delicious!

I made this according to the recipe up until the part where the oil and spicy mixture was supposed to get into the sliced part of the potatoes. It didn't work so I put some softened butter in with spices ( I made a new mixture)  and smooshed that by hand into all of the nooks and crannies. It came out of the oven looking incredible, but it just tasted so so. Not worth all of the effort.

Super yummy!  I used half butter and half EVOO.  Added a little salt but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.

I was looking for something a little different than a baked potato and this was nice change.   It did take a little longer to cook , but, it could have been the size of the potatoes I used.   I finely chopped the garlic instead of pressing it and used regular salt instead of celery salt because we aren't big fans of celery.  I also added another sprinkle of parmesan on top of the potatoes during the last few minutes.

Not hard to chop with the chopstick idea, and to drizzle on the oil and seasonings after you pried it open a bit. But still probably more time consuming than it's worth. It had a nice flavor and texture but took longer to cook than stated.

My potatoes would have been better had I baked them at least 10-15 minutes longer. They were rather large and still not don’t enough. I also added more butter.

Vary the seasoning by what you like best or the event. ie., Everything bagel spices for a brunch buffet. Rosemary and garlic for dinner.  You can add 3-4 tablespoons melted butter to the oil/seasoning mixture. Delicious!

I make these repeatedly. I have a hasselback cutting guide-much easier. Before that I cut the bottoms flat and used a wooden skewer on each side to keep from cutting through. I skip the Parmesan as I can’t eat it and I brush the oil and seasonings on because I don’t like washing oily bags! But these potatoes are truly a wonderful thing.

I do not like potatoes but my husband does. These are the first potatoes I’ve made that we both like they are delicious and they go with almost any meal and are particularly good with a steak or some fish!

These were good and what I would consider to be an "elegant baked potato". I have always wanted to make Hasselback potatoes and didn't till now. I used Eastern potatoes because that is what I had on hand. They had too many tubers so I had to peel them. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of adding a little butter on top. They turned out crispy on the outside and  tender on the inside. I felt that they dried out a bit on the outside, probably because I did peel the skin off so the little butter on top was needed. They were good.

Loved them! Will definitely make again. Didn't use the garlic because we didn't have any left. I knew these would be delicious so I went ahead and made a whole 5lb. bag of potatoes up and froze some of the leftovers for later:)

These were just ok for us.  I followed the recipe to a T except I used russets instead of Yukon gold as it was what I had on hand.  They were rather bland and underwhelming.  I will continue to tinker  around and hopefully come up with something more flavorful.

These turned out so pretty and easier to make than I thought! I upped the spices because I like to live dangerously. And a little extra parm just because I had to keep everything in proportion. Thank you for sharing!!

DISGUSTING !  They look great on the pic.   So 5 stars for the photographer.     I've made this twice.  Tweaking after the first time using other recipes here and just basic know-how to make it work.   It's hopeless.    
But you may love hard dry potatoes.

They were just OK. Didn't seem to cook enough except around the edges. Found them a bit bland so would add some more seasoning if I did it again. After I cut them (with some difficulty) I saw the hint about putting chopsticks on either side to help cut them. That would make it much easier. But not sure I'll give it another effort. Laying slices out on a baking tray might work better though not look as good.
