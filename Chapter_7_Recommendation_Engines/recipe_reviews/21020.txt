I have several variations of the stromboli recipes from this site.  For time purposes, I let my dough thaw on the counter wrapped in saran wrap sprayed with pam.  I do NOT use the cooked ground sausage in this, it makes it way to greasy.  For easy clean-up of the flour I wet the counter with a damp cloth and lay 2 pieces of saran wrap onto it.  Add a small amount of flour on plastic and roll dough.  Then just pull up the plastic with no flour mess on the counter!  For a quicker baking time I cook at a higher temperature, 375 for 15-18 minutes.  Served with Pizza Sauce I as a dipping sauce.  This is a regular Friday night "pizza" at our house (even my kids can make it)!  It cost less than a pizza chain's pizza!

We thought this was quite good, and a nice change of pace.  I might not use both salami and pepperoni; it seemed a little salty. Next time, I might try a little sliced pepperocini peppers or mushrooms or onions to make it a little less meaty.  My husband really liked this!

Excellent recipe, the only change I made was that I used the refrigerated Pillsbury Pizza dough and it came out just fine. I also tried some sauce on the side.

Very Yummy.  I made a few changes.  I made home made bread dough instead of  store bought frozen bread dough.  I used ham, italian sausage, mozz cheese, and american cheese.  (My husbands a fussy eater.)  Next time I will add the pepperoni, provolone cheese, and will fry onions with the sausage.  The flavor from dusting with cornmeal is the perfect finish! Do NOT skip the corn meal! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Everyone cleaned their plates (even my five year old picky eater). I heated some Ragu chunky veg sauce for dipping and they LOVED it, me too!!!!

This is a great recipe, but it is far better if you substitute Italian sausage (cooked) for the pepperoni and use Mozzarella instead of American (or use all Mozzerella cheese).  The American cheese took away from an otherwise great meal.

The bread dough on this made it more crust than anything.  The taste was pretty good, just not a big mustard fan and it was kind of strong for me.

These were so good.  You can substitude the meats for whatever you have but what made the dish was the mustard so don't leave that out.

What a great "fun" recipe with wonderful flavor.  You could make this 100's of different ways and probably enjoy with each creation.   We used pizza dough (not frozen), no salami, mozzarella instead of American cheese and no yellow mustard.
We made two to bring to friends who were having a wine tasting and "heavy appetizers" !
We will DEFINITELY make some version of this many times over ! The additions and substitutions could be endless !
