We used this recipe in our electric fondue with a couple changes.  We rubbed the pot with cut garlic before adding the hard cider (home brewed).  We let that boil before tossing in the cheddar/swiss mixture that was tossed with flour (rather than cornstarch) and pepper.  We've used this recipe for company and for ourselves and is excellent.  Use french bread that has been cut into cubes that has sat out for a half day to make it easier for dipping.  Apple slices go well with this cheese as well.  We'll be using this recipe regularly for fondue.

Easy and Delicious Recipe for Fondue. Affordable - cheddar and swiss are not as expensive as some of the other cheese fondue recipes that call for gouda etc.
My Changes - which worked fine if not better:
1.  Used flour instead of cornstarch
2. Added garlic powder
3.  Had extra apple juice/cider on hand that I added whenever the cheese became clumpy. I probably added another 1 cup full throughout the dinner. However, definately warm it up in the microwave before adding or else it cools the cheese. If anything it enhanced the flavors of the cheese
4.  Worked well in an electric fondue pot

I'd never made fondue before, and I was glad to find this recipe. I used 4 cups of cheese (around 1-3/4 cups of swiss and 2-1/4 cups of smoked cheddar), 1Â½ TBS of flour, a few good shakes of pepper. We dipped apple slices, carrot sticks, pepperoni slices (AWESOME!), and bread (the store's bakery had a big bag of dipping/appetizer-sized sliced bread pieces the PERFECT size for fondue). It was really good. My husband thought the smoked cheddar-apple juice mix was a bit sweet, but both my daughter and I really enjoyed it. Nice to find a recipe that doesn't call for processed cheese or wine! Thanks for sharing, Kim!

I'm giving this a four because my husband LOVED IT! He ate most of it infact. For me it was ok, but I expected something different. I think I will make it again for company and get more opinions.
Update 11/2/07 - Tried this again, but replaced the cheddar cheese with Gruyeye and Emnenthaler cheese. It was delicious!! Husband and company all raved - loved the cider.

Now I understand that this is not exactly a traditional fondue recipe and I can see why some people may snub it because of its lack of ueber expensive cheeses.  But really, this is excellent!   I had a few people over that I knew would not fully appreciate the fine and delicate taste of a traditional cheese fondue.  As I was hesitant to be spending 40 dollars on the appetizer for our dinner, I resorted to this much more economical choice and I was very glad I did!  The apple juice adds a great flavor to the cheese, I did add a little lemon juice to this to keep it from getting stringy and added the flour to the cheese before adding to the liquids.  I ended up making 3 batches of this!  We dipped pumpernickel, rye, and sourdough bread into this, (my favorite is the pumpernickel with this recipe)  It was also great with pretzels.  Definately a great recipe if you dont want to break the bank.

This was just brilliant!  I used flour instead of cornstarch and it worked just fine.  When it got a bit too thick after sitting in the fondue pot a while...I warmed some addition cider in the microwave and stirred it in just a little at a time.  We used Italian bread and lil smokies to dip...was outstanding and soooo simple.

First attempt at making fondue and I was pleased with the results!  We used a nice brown ale instead of the cider and I think it gave the fondue a WONDERFUL flavor!  Used Kraft 2% cheddar and a nice gouda instead of the swiss - it was just delicious served with cubes of herb bread and apple wedges.

This recipe was GREAT!  I'm a novice in the kitchen and this fondue was simple and quick and tasted wonderful.  We tried it this Thanksgiving as an alternative to serving breakfast.  I used Gruyere, Gouda, and a Cheddar/Swiss combo-served with lil' smokies, french garlic bread, pears, apples, and broccoli.  Everyone loved it!

Absolutely delicious and easy!  I added a pinch of kosher salt and garlic powder to bring out the flavors a bit more.  Everyone loved it.  It was a great inexpensive way for the kids to experience fondue.

This was so easy and tasted wonderful. The cider was a great touch. I used Italian bread for dipping.  My son and daughter-in-law loved it.  Will definitely make again and again.

This turned out well, though it was so rich we all felt a little unwell after making a meal of it. I deviated from the recipe in that I used flour rather than cornstarch with the cheeses. I am also glad I had read the hint of adding a little lemon juice to keep the cheese smooth. I used a combination of sharp New York white cheddar, Jarlsberg and double cream gouda. I think it is more approprite as part of a party buffet where you just eat a little bit of it.

This was great!  I used half apple juice, half white wine for the liquids.  I used a mini crockpot and just microwaved the liquids and cheeses together in the crock part for a couple of minutes, then moved it to the heating unit on high and stirred every now and then until it was smooth.  Super easy and really yummy!

OK so I just made this again for the 3rd time and wow I made it even simpler.  I got a cheddar, monteray jack and asadero chees mix and used spiced cider and it was fantastic!!!

my original post is below. 

This was a GREAT recipe!  I made it for a party but had to make it the next day in a much smaller batch to try it myself because by the time I had a chance to try it the entire double batch had vanished!  I served it with mini hot dogs, apple, beer bread, french bread and broccoli.  A total hit I printed out the recipe at the party because it was so talked about. Super easy to make it was creamy and smooth both times.  Financially reasonable unlike many recipes for cheese fondue that I found and no alcohol was involved.  Highly recommended!

This was very yummy, but also very thick.  I added some wine to thin out the consistency since I didn't have beer on hand.  Not quite as sweet this way, but everyone liked it a lot.

After following the directions, it was too thick to use. I had to keep adding apple juice, and it still wouldn't thin out.   I would love to try this recipe again, but maybe with a different cheese or liquid....Luckily, I had a different fondue that I made and everyone at that one....

I have found my cheese fondue recipe.  Next time I will add more cider, as it was a little too thick for me.  I dipped French bread cubes and green apple slices.  Planning on some sausage and dense pretzel rods next time.  Made it for two, there was very little left.

This is very nice non alchohalic fondue recipe. I served it with green apples, pears, bread, and soft pretzels cut into bite size pieces. I cook fondue fairly often. It is a favorite in the fall.

I'm going to give this one a middle of the road rating for now.  Our fondue was a grainy mess that no amount of fiddling with could save.  I'm not entirely sure it wasn't our cheese, though (there's not the greatest selection to be had in this town), so I'll probably try to procure excellent cheese and come back later to re-assess.

Absolutely amazing! We made this with apple juice and gouda and came out fantastic. Though the serving size said "10", it was perfect for dinner for two. (Meatballs, bread, veggies, fruit)

I tried the recipe exactly as written here but the cheese was very stringy and the cider did not incorporate into the cheese at all.  After about 30 min in the slow cooker, the cheese got clumpy. I'm not sure where I went wrong with this recipe, but it didn't work at all for me.

The only fondue I had ever had was the Melting Pot.. But from now on.. I think I'll make my fondue at home. :) This recipe was amazing, and for my first time making fondue.. It was very easy. The cider gives a unique flavor to it.. I think I might like that better than the wine! We used French bread, carrots, broccoli, apples and celery as dippers. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was my first time to try making fondue and it turned out great!  I love this recipe because you can enjoy fondue on a small budget.  Thanks for the great alternative to wine recipes.  We really enjoyed this and I will make it again.  I took other reviewers suggestions and used french bread (of course), apples, and li'l smokies as dippers.  We made a full meal out of this.  Very fun and delicious!

We followed the recipe to the letter and it never quite got smooth. It was our first try at fondue, but I think we'll go with a different recipe next time. Not a very strong flavor.

Loved it! Giving it five stars even tho I modified b/c this recipe gave me a solid base. Rubbed the inside of the fondue pot w/ garlic before cooking, subbed beer for cider, and tossed the cheese w/ flour instead of corn starch.

My family begs me to make this recipes all the time. I made it for birthdays, honeymoon, christmas, and family dinners they absolutely love it i like to experiament with other cheeses like i will use the cheddar and swiss and sometimes throw in some bree or smoked gouda i would give this recipe a 5 star rateing except the do not have the right protioning of liquid or cornstarch but thats an easy fix if you have ever made a gravy before you will have an idea of what to do also i think the recipe needs garlic powder and some seasoning salt. I pair it with steamed broccoli, lil smokies, french bread and apple peices and my family just begs for more. My mother in law use to have fondue from famous chefs in france and she still prefers mine

Excellent!  Came together perfectly, stayed smoth and creamy even as it cooled down.Kids and grownups all loved it!  Used some left over fondue mixed with shredded cheese in a grilled cheese sandwich... oh my goodness!!! So good.

This was great and the apple juice gave it a delicious flavor!  Added some crushed red pepper and garlic powder and dipped hot dogs and bread.  Soooo yummy!!!

Kind of bland as is, so I added a little extra cheddar and some garlic.  After that it got gobbled up :)  Great texture!

This recipe was very tasty, but the cheese kept separating from the liquid which made for an unappetizing appearance and made it difficult to eat.

Very good flavor...though I might like it more a little thicker.  I may try it with hard cider instead of regular apple cider next time too.  REALLY good with apples and 7 grain bread.

Tried all the fondue tricks I could read about here, but this still turned out a gloppy, chunky mess -- good flavor. It looked great going into the fondue pot, but quickly chunked up... no amount of added cider could save it.  Tried some lemon juice, too, that's supposed to break down cheese, but it didn't work.  My guests were gracious about the taste.

very tasty.. just as i'd expected. i love the slight sweetness of the apple cider that evens out the saltiness of the cheese perfectly. YUM!

This was our first venture into fondue and everyone liked it.  It tasted great.  We used hard cider and substituted Meunster for the Swiss because no one here likes Swiss.  We added a little fresh lemon juice when it got a wee but clumpy.   We'd make this again it was fun and easy.

Very easy to make and tastes wonderful.  My husband and 5 year old love it.  I use one and a quarter apple cider which makes the cheese less thick.  I add garlic powder and a dash of crushed red pepper for extra flavor.  French bread and broccoli and sliced green apple are our favorite dippers.  I also prefer flour over corn starch.  Difinitly a must try for any fondue lover.

I haven't had fondue in probably close to 15 years, and my husband has never had it.  I found it appealing because I had both cheeses in the fridge already.  I served this with steak done in a balsamic vinegar and red wine sauce (and cubed homemade French bread) and it was absolutely fantastic!  I did alter the recipe just a bit - instead of cider, I used non-alcoholic Alpine Spice wine.  It is made by a Pennsylvania winery and is a blend of Chardonnay, Johannisberg Riesling and 'spices.'  I figured this would be safe after reading that some folks had used white wine, and others had used spiced cider....this wine falls between the two.  I used flour in place of the corn starch - cubed the cheese and put it in a tupperware with flour and pepper and tossed it to coat the cheese.  I also crushed a small clove of garlic into the cheese mixture.  An absolutely fantastic recipe.  Will definitely make again!

This was my first cheese fondue, and I was thoroughly disappointed. I'm pretty sure I followed all of the directions exactly, but maybe my pot was too hot or too cold. I did double the recipe, so maybe that made a difference. Others seemed to have no problem, so I'll chock it up to user error. It turned out to be a gooey, stringy mess. At first it looked like we were doing fine, then the more I stirred the bigger the gigantic cheese clump. I ended up running to the store last minute for some velveeta [hanging head in shame] because folks were showing up and I didn't want all the cheese dippers to go to waste. I'm just glad the cheeses weren't really expensive, because I would have cried. I didn't give it 3 stars just because of my mistake, either. I tried a bit before it was inedible, and it seemed to me to be lacking something. Maybe garlic as others suggested, but I thought it just seemed kinda flat, just sweetened cheddar.

I made this just as described, except with flour instead of the Corn starch.  First of all, it takes a LOT more than 4-5 min on low heat to get the cheese to melt and not be gooey clumps (as I read one reviewer say btw).  If you let it go longer (more like 15-20 min) it is fabulous!  One word of warning though.  Don't let it cool down, before eating.  It WILL get very clumpy then you will be not happy.  Even if you try to reheat.  Just make it as is, giving it  plenty of time over low heat to melt.  Took a bunch of peoples advice, and served it with sliced Granny Smiths, French bread, and Little Smokies, and it was a HUGE hit :)

This is pretty good, and really simple to make. I made it in the microwave. I heated the apple juice in a glass measuring dish until it boiled, and then added all the other ingredients and stirred. Cooked at medium power and stirred every 30 seconds, until the cheese melted. Then transferred to my slow cooker.

Not what I expected, but not bad.  Mine didn't come out creamy - it was stringy.  Didn't coat the vegetables or bread at all - slid right off of everything.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  My son is happy with the results - though I am not sure that I would make it again.

very tasty - nice change - used french & sourdough bread cubes for dipping as well as honey crisp apples - nice combination. I would say that the recipe, as stated, will NOT feed 10 as a meal.

This had a great flavor and was a nice alternative to cheese fondue with wine. Other reviewers have said they used baby carrots to dip, and no one I was with liked them with the cheese. Apples and crusty bread cubes were great.

Very yummy.  I used guyer cheese and swiss cheese instead.  I loved that the apple juice didn't have a strong apple taste.  It's a nice alternative to those who don't keep wine around the house :)

I thought this was great and extremely easy.  I added about 3/4 cup of a wheat beer since my cheese had gotten pretty thick on me.  I served it with the Easy Beer Bread Mix recipe from this site.  Delicious!

I really loved this recipe!  We enjoyed it with french bread pieces, steamed cauliflower, and apples.  Our cheese never really fully integrated with the juice, but it wasn't bad.  I think it was because I chose sharp cheddar, which is harder than mild cheddar.  Beautiful cheese fondue.

This is so good! Great balance of cheese & cider flavors. I used sharp cheddar & my guests were putting this on everything. I served it with soft pretzels & apples, but we also put it on meat & pierogies.  I might make it with hard cider next time for a new twist.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. Found it was extremely stringy and too..cheesy? Not what I was looking for.

I made 2 fondues, and this was the real hit at the party. The flavor of this fondue was really good, but the texture had lumps of swiss cheese that did not properly melt. It might have been the type of swiss I used (baby swiss, because aged swiss was not available). I will definitely try this recipe again because the flavor was so good, and try to work out the texture problem.

This fondue was tasty.  My husband and I did a "fondue night."  I decided to make this fondue instead of some of the others since it would be less expensive.  I rubbed the pot with garlic and then used Hornsby in place of regular cider.  I served it with sliced smoked sausage, broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms, carrots, french bread, apples and pears.  All were good with it except the mushrooms, carrots, and pears.  I also used flour instead of corn starch.  I would definitely make this again and might even try experimenting with beer instead of cider or try using different cheeses.  There were two of us eating it as dinner and we still had half left.  We were so full afterward, we never got around to making the chocolate fondue we planned on making!

We just made this, following the recipe exactly, and while the flavor was great, it was really stringy. So, we put it back on the stove (double boiler) and added more apple cider, which I had heated in the microwave per another reviewer's suggestion, and that did the trick. The 3/4 cups of cider just wasn't enough to make the fondue creamy, but it turned out perfect after I added about 1/4 cup more. I would suggest starting with the 3/4 cups and slowly incorporating more heated cider if the texture does not seem right. Next time, I will try some of the other suggestions, such as rubbing the pot with garlic first and using flour over cornstarch; however, all of us really enjoyed the flavor as is. Had the texture been perfect without adding more cider, I would have given this 5 stars. It truly was wonderful to find a cheese fondue that did not call for alcohol, so this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Agree with other reviewers, in that... Change the corn starch to flour. Let it slow cook more than the 4-5 min suggested, otherwise it will not melt.  The flavor is SO good, and so unique.  I served with bread cubes, apples, sausages, and I also had a fresh raw veggie plate out too (with another dip), that people were dipping into it!  Eat it all once cooked, cause it definately does NOT re heat well, but turns into a big gooey clump.  Am giving it only 3 stars for the goody clumpiness which was tricky.  The flavor, however, was excellent.

I thought this was awesome fondue! I used Woodchuck hard cider in place of the apple juice/cider and it came out wonderful. I had it warm in the crockpot when my husband and neighbors came in from a chilly football game and everyone loved it! Served it with sliced smoked turkey sausage, sliced apples, beer bread cubes, and broccoli and cauliflower florets - YUM!!

I was really excited about my first time making fondue but this recipe completely flopped for us. The cheese and juice wouldn't combine no matter how much I stirred! I tried turning up the heat a little, adding lemon juice... nothing. We had a glob of stringy cheese surrounded by cheesy apple juice. Yuck!

With just a little dash of garlic salt and replacing the Swiss cheese with Swiss Emmental, this was a huge hit! I had to double the recipe to allow for 6 people to eat continuously. Otherwise, it's only enough for 3. Serve this with Granny Apple slices and grapes in addition to the French bread. All is delicious in the fondue!

We have made this for 5-6 years as our New Year's dinner, exactly as written, or doubled.  After melting all together on stove, I move it to a small (1.5Q or 2Q)crock pot on low to keep it warm.  I especially like this because it is kid friendly, without any after taste from any wine.  We enjoy dipping bread, apples, pears, and carrots in it.  It was also a hit at my daughter's 12th b'day party.

This turmed out to be more bland than I expected.  Next time if I try it again maybe I'll add garlic or more spices.  The consistency was good so I may use it as a base recipe in the future.

I made this for a halloween party and it was a huge success.  The vegitarians there were so happy to see it.  Nothing survived for the next day.  I used a bottle of hard apple cider and cheap cheddar cheese.  Next time I will get a better quality cheddar and I'm sure it will be even better!  I'm making this again in the near future.  It is a great fall dish!

This was fantastic!  I made it exactly as the recipe said.  My 10 year old daughter had a slumber party and this was what I made for dinner.  All the girls loved it!  We dipped garlic bread, homemade chicken nuggets, pepperoni, corn chips, broccoli, caulifower and apples.

We use this recipe on a regular basis.  The mixture tastes great and is much cheaper than most.  I do add a little garlic  powder, use flour instead of cornstarch and hard apple cider instead of regular.  The green apple is best.  I serve this recipe with bread, mushrooms, celery, and italian seasoned chicken cubes.  They're great to mix and match like kabobs too!  Oh Yeah,  I also add a little bit of garlic powder to my mix.

WOW! I have always made my cheese fondue with wine. I decided to make this one because we had several little kids eating with us on New Year's Eve (along with many adults). People RAVED about this. It was fantastic. We ended up quickly making another batch after everyone devoured what we had made.   I took someone's tip and served bread cubes and pepperoni and everyone loved that. Yum!

Thought this was pretty good. Had to add extra cider since it thickened up way too much. My kids didn;t like the cider (but i really think they didn't like the swiss cheese. But i ate the rest and enjoyed it.

Everyone at our party enjoyed this recipe. Leftovers make an excellent cheese sauce for broccoli, potatoes, whatever.

Delicious! I made this for a fondue party with my girlfriends and everyone loved it! So much so that it was almost the star of the show (can't compete with chocolate covered strawberries, of course)! I did, however, have to keep adding cider or milk to keep the consistency manageable from time to time. Will definitely be making this one again! Thank you!

My hubby and I really liked this recipe. He loves cider so I knew that he wouldn't mind the slightly sweet taste. The texture came out very creamy and smooth.  I served two kinds of bread, steamed veggies, and little smokey sausages with the fondue.  The smokeys were the best, the combo of the salty smokey sausage with the slightly sweet cheese was wonderful! Thanks for a great wine free recipe!

Great change-up from the traditional swiss/white wine fondue I've grown accustomed to.  My husband liked it too!

Definitely quick and easy.  Maybe I'm just not a fan on fondue.  I did add a little garlic, but generally it was just bland.

Turned out okay.  I didn't feel that it was the best combo of flavors.
