Love! I didn't have any smooth PB so I used cashew butter instead. I also added a little vanilla extract because I love vanilla. Delicious!

Delicious and easy to make!   I always have these ingredients on hand, so it's my new "go to"  dessert.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

This looks amazing! I'm dairy free and I love chocolate so this is a great substitute for my love of shakes!

For banana lovers, this might be a great treat. Don't let the liquid-y appearance fool you, it is thick!  But I'm not too into bananas myself, so I added 2 extra tablespoons of peanut butter and 1 to 2 extra teaspoons of cocoa powder. I liked it, but wasn't in love. This combination of ingredients in a smoothie creates a slightly odd taste to me. But I encourage others to give it a try!

I made it and it was delicious. I didnâ€™t have PB but I had PB powder. No difference only it does remove some of the fat calories

This was a little thin for me. The flavor is wonderfully delicious, but I double the recipe and use 3 bananas.
