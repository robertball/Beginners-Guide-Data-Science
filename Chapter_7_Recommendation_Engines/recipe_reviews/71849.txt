This bread is good.  It is nice and moist for an all wheat bread.  I had to add a lot more flour when kneading (at least a cup.)  The recipe makes a lot of bread, so I would recommend spliting it into more than two pans.  I used two pans and split the rest between mini loaf pans.  My 2 year old daughter loves the mini loaves.  My only change would be to reduce the molasses.  Next time I might increase the honey and decrease the molasses because it is a very strong flavor.  Overall, a recipe I will use again!

I have a passion for bread. I read the other reviews but had a feeling it would work out. Not only did it rise double in size, but it tripled...each time it rose--AND baked. 

I almost cried when it rose so much. I just love that feeling :)

The trick is LOVE and not overworking it. I was in a hurry--and I think that helped. Make sure you have good yeast. I just made one loaf--cut the recipe in half.

Thank you so much for the recipe; I hope your son is healthy and happy.

Best,
Jennifer

great recipe!  I didnt have cracked wheat, or sunflower seeds so put in 1/4 cup chopped fine walnuts. I used 3/4 cup honey to 1/4 cup molasses. I added probably 2 to 2 1/2 cups more flour. I made it in my kitchen aid mixer..heavy duty one.  I mixed it on Speed 2 until it just came away from sides. Also my flour was freshly ground whole wheat from the farmers market. This recipe is big!  I got 12 buns, 1 10"round, 2 --9 1/2 x 5 1/2 loaves. The texture is light and the taste is lovely. I found my bread ready in 25 minutes. I used a thermometer to 200degrees. I think you could make this recipe in any shape.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe.  I've made this at least six to eight times and it always comes out beautifully. The only warning I'd like to give is that it yields four loaves (not two) so make sure you have extra loaf pans! Also, because of all the grains it needs a bit of help rising. I add about 8-10 Tbs. of Vital Wheat Gluten (Bobs Red Mill can be found in any supermarket) and it rises very well. The last bit of advice I'll give you is that due to the abundant amount of loaves this recipe yields, I like to thickly slice this bread and lay out the slices in a gallon freezer ziploc (with wax paper between the slices) and freeze them. I just take out a slice for my breakfast, toast it and slather with butter and jam, and I have breakfast for weeks - and there's still enough to give one or two loaves away.

This was hearty, grainy, and moist--exactly what I was looking for!  I did use a little more honey than molasses (still used a cup combined), and I liked the result.  This made quite a bit of bread!  My bread pans are a little smaller than 9x5", so I knew I'd have more than two loaves, but I ended up with five fat loaves, which was awesome.  I did add a few cups more flour, but that's to be expected in a bread recipe--the amount is quite variable depending on humidity and such.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This bread was healthy and delicious but...I had to add a bit of flour to reduce stickiness during kneading.  It oozed over the pan when baking and I had to trim.  But...it was so yummy!  Next time I'll make it into 4 loaves.

What a great bread recipe! Like the submitter, I have a family member who is fighting cancer, and this bread fits perfectly into his diet. I made it pretty much as  written, except I used home-canned pumpkin instead of applesauce, and cut the amount of honey and molasses in half. The only complaints I have about this recipe is that it could use a bit more salt, and that the dough was very sticky. I had to add at least half a cup of extra flour...but that might be because I used the pumpkin instead of applesauce. Other than that, this bread is absolutely delicious...even family members who turn their noses up at whole-grain breads were eating this and enjoying it! The texture is nice and soft, with all that wonderful graininess from the cracked wheat and sunflower seeds. The oatmeal gave it a lovely texture as well. I found that I needed WAY more than two loaf pans, because this made A LOT of dough. I used 1 9x5" loaf pan, one smaller loaf pan, and one long sandwich bread loaf pan, in addition to two 9" round pans that  I used to make into pull-apart rolls. Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe! I'll be making it again!

I'm crazy about the ingredients in this bread, but not the proportioning of them.  Would recommend quadrupling flax seed, cooking oats, sunflower seeds and cracked wheat ... and doubling water, applesauce, honey, molasses and oil.  Would also recommend oiling dough once placed in pan for final rise ... and sprinkling with flax seed, cooking oats, sunflower seeds and cracked wheat.  Crust gets darker than desirable before bread finishes baking; covering dough with aluminum foil in late stages of baking would help.

Holy rising dough, Batman! These made the biggest loaves I have ever seen (and I got 4 out of this recipe!!!). They were beautiful & crunchy on the outside, so soft and pliable on the inside. Perfect! I live at 6300 ft. so, with any bread, I add a few Tbs. of dough enhancer; I just can't seem to get a good, light, wheat bread without it. Also, didn't have enough lemon juice, so finished it off with half as much vinegar. Worked great! Thanks BentRiver: my 11 year old son--and best critic--said it was the best bread I've ever made!

This was great.  It is nice and fluffy.  It smelled too much like molasses and I was worried that it would taste like it too, but this was quite tasty.  Other than the smell, I couldnt taste the molasses at all.  Its pretty sweet, but not over powering. The changes I made was, I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and did not put in the lemon juice because I didnt have any.  Im not sure what difference it would make leaving that out.  I liked it anyways.  I filled 4 loaf pans.  I recommend cutting this recipe in half.

When they sold out of our favorite bread at the farmer's market, I came home and searched for a bread to make.  This is wonderful.  It is dense and very tasty.  It does make ALOT of bread...definately use more than 2 bread pans!!!

Super delicious bread!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and changed the ratio of honey and molasses - used about 1/3 cup molasses and 2/3 cup honey.  I didn't have cracked wheat, so substituted cornmeal grits (polenta grind) and that was a nice addition.  I also used 1 cup graham flour and 1 cup wheat bran, and reduced the whole wheat flour to 7 cups, substituted oat bran for the oats, added 3 tbsp gluten and 3 tbsp powdered buttermilk.  I used roasted, salted sunflower seeds, so reduced the salt as well.  I didn't bake it in bread pans - I formed 2 round loaves and 2 oblong loaves and put on 2 oiled cookie sheets.  The bread turned out heavy, dense, and delicious - just the way we like a good bread.  This recipe is a definite keeper - but I probably will halve the recipe next time.

I had to add a whole lot more flour to get this to the right consistency. Didn't rise very much in the hour, but bread turned out wonderful. Nice hearty taste.

I love this bread. It made 3 large loaves and they froze beautifully. I didn't have cracked wheat so I substituted quinoa and it was delicious.

This recipe is fantastic! I am just learning how to make bread (this is my second recipe) and it came out great!  I used 6 cups of whole wheat flour and 3 cups of white flour, didn't use the sunflower seeds, and replaced the 3/4 cup of cracked wheat with flax seeds. It came out great but it made 3 large loaves so I get to share with my friends.

This is fantastic!  Thank you ! I have searched/experimented with whole grain recipes for years and feel like I struck gold today!! I made this today making the following substitutions/changes based on other reviews and ingredients on hand.. 3/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup molasses, 3T unfiltered applecider vinegar instead of lemon juice. Didnt have the cracked wheat or sunflower seeds on hand so I crushed up Organic Pumpkin-Flax-Plus Granola and added 1 1/2 cups of it. It's tasty, has a wonderful texture and so easy to make . Thanks and blessings to you and your family!

I think this bread is wonderful and tasty! I would recommend that you cut the recipe in half and use more flour when kneading it. I also use a third of maple syrup for the amount of honey and molasses, instead of the full amount for both, as it takes away the molasses flavor and makes it sweeter. I think I like to make rolls out of it better than making the bread loaf. You can make them bigger to make little sandwiches out them. Great taste!

I cut this in half for my Zo bread machine; it still kept rising over the top. Next time I'll cut it down to 9. Had a good taste & moist but we'll try again.

This is the best recipe for bread that I have found. I took the suggestion to use 1/4 molasses and 3/4 honey after finding the taste too strong. I add 9 tbs. of vital wheat gluten for nice raising. I use 5 cups fine grind wheat and 4 cups course grind wheat. Since we usually don't have applesauce, I just microwave an apple or pear to start the yeast it. I also use whole flax seed. It is great tasting bread with fantastic texture with the whole grains!

LOVE THIS BREAD!  I make it as it's written.  I've changed this to be my regular bread recipe that I use for sandwhiches and then shaped differently with toppings for a meal type bread.  It does make a lot.  When I rise it in the sun I get 3 loaves in medium sized pans and 1 log-shaped free form loaf.  I love that it's whole wheat, no white flour and it's not too dense.  It did take me a while to perfect it.  If it's not perfect the first time, keep trying.

I love this recipe, I've made it exactly, a couple of times now and the flavour and texture are great.  I have trouble working out which of my assorted bread tins is the right combination for the amount of dough - but that's MY problem!!  This does make a lot and freezes well.

I didn't have molasses, so doubled the amount of honey, and didn't have cracked wheat, so used 7 grain cereal.  This filled more than 1 bread pan, so some of the dough went into a bread pan, and the rest was a free formed loaf.  The smaller amount baked in 35 minutes, and the larger loaf baked in 45 minutes.  Wonderful taste!  Great texture!  I'll be making this again!

This is a wonderful whole wheat bread.  I halved the recipe and still ended up with enough to make a regular loaf and a round loaf.  If I hadn't wanted to use my second bread pan for a different loaf of bread, I'm sure it would've made two loaf pans worth.  It's hearty yet not too dense all at the same time.  I added 5 tbs of vital wheat gluten and it rose very well.  Thanks for the recipe!

While recovering from surgery,the only thing that sounded really good was a hearty bread.  After reading the comments,  I made this recipe,  substituting pumpkin puree for applesauce and almond milk for water. I added some quinoa, rye flour, chia seeds, oat bran, 7-grain cereal, and tiny bit of cornmeal.  I either added too much gluten free material, or didn't give it enough time to rise, because it's pretty dense.  i totally enjoy the molasses flavor and may leave out the honey next time, to cut the sweetness.  The flavor is wonderful and I will definitely make it again!  Beautifully satisfying!  I love this guilt-bread that is actually nutritious without the empty calories. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!  I wish you and your son all the best!

I am going to make this bread today, but I will cheat and use my bread machine to knead the dough initially.  (I blew my left shoulder and being left handed just can't do the dough justice by kneading by hand).  I will keep with the original ingredients but cut the recipe in half for 2 loaves except I will use Red River Cereal in place of the cracked wheat and flax seeds as Red River Cereal is made up of cracked wheat, cracked rye and flax seeds.  I use it all the time in place of cracked wheat! I make bread all the time and wouldn't recommend doubling or quadrupling the grains because this will make the bread too dry and too grainy, spoiling the texture.    
Ok, so I made two loaves of this bread.  It worked very well in my bread machine but I added probably a cup more of the whole wheat flour while it was kneading as it was way too sticky.  After trying the bread, toasted for breakfast I recommend cutting back by half the amount of molasses and honey, as I found it way too sweet.  Otherwise it is a very good bread and I will definitely make it again.

This was my first success at bread making after a couple other attempts.  I made a 1/2 recipe which made 2 loaves.  My bread was done after about 28 minutes.  My dough rose a lot after first resting period; however, after dividing and placing in pans, one rose more than the other; one above top of pan and the other just at pan height,  Also, one caved a bit on one side during baking?  At any rate, the bread is moist and dense with a nice crust on top!  Love it.  Also, I could not find cracked wheat and used wheat germ instead.  Will be making this again!

Great, yummy bread!!! I only changed a few things because I didn't have them. I used almond flour and quinoa. I will make it often. I used the measurements as stated.

Delicious, moist bread!  Loved this recipe.  The dough was rather wet.  I had to add over a cup more of flour, but it gave a good rise both times.  Had to sub maple syrup for molasses, but still turned out tasty.  Will increase the salt a little next time.  I made 1/2 of  all ingredients.  Cooking time wasn't as long - only about 35 minutes.

We liked this healthy bread - I did cut the recipe in half and made two 8 X 4 pans, plus a mini loaf. I made a few minor changes - reduced oil, molasses and honey by a tablespoon each to reduce fat and sugar. And I added a tablespoon of glutton to help it rise. I found it didn't need the full 1 hour on the second rise. The first time I started baking after 50 minutes, the second after 45. Both times, it fell just a little bit and it was finished baking early than suggested too. Overall, I  was pleased with it and will continue to tweek it until it is perfect for my family. :)

This was amazing.  I couldn't find cracked wheat, so I bought a 5 grain cereal and replaced the oatmeal and cracked wheat with that.  I also added about 1 extra cup of water.  Cook for about 30 minutes instead of 40.

The only change I made was to add vital wheat gluten.  This is delicious. I love it. I'm a horrible bread baker and I think this turned out right. I'm not an expert so I could be wrong. I love the texture and taste. I can't wait to use it for sandwiches. I didn't use the bread machine. This is the first time I've made bread without the bread machine and have it turn out well. I did use my Bosch, but still a step up for me. I will be making this again as my regular bread recipe.

Excellent!  Didn't have cracked wheat so used oat bran instead.  Only needed just over 30min to bake.  It got a little too crispy on the outside but still turned out wonderful!

Excellent recipe! I increased the flax, sunflower seeds, oats, and cracked wheat quantities by 50 percent.  Also added vital gluten to counteract the tendency to be crumbly.  Finally, I modified the recipe to include the Cornell triple enriched flour formula (each cup of flour included 1 tablespoon of soy flour, 1 tablespoon powdered milk solids, and 1 teaspoon wheat germ).

Great! Couldn't find cracked wheat and substituted bulgar. So grainy and delicious. It proved well, much to my surprise. Highly  recommend.

This is the best whole grain recipe I can find. It accommodates personal choice of grains and sweeteners a without spoiling the bread.  It does need more flour.  The recipe does call for 4 bread pans, so I'm wondering about the confusion on that.  It makes 4 perfectly sized 9 x 5 inch loaves.

Really good recipe!  I made a few changes only because I didn't have the flax meal or cracked wheat so instead I used 1/2 cup oat flour and 3/4 cup chia seeds.  I also didn't have molasses so I used 1/2 cup organic maple syrup. I ended up needing probably about 2 cups more flour than the recipe called for.  Makes 4 beautiful loaves of bread!  The bread rose beautifully and cooked perfectly in about 40 minutes. Very dense but at the same time fluffy and a wonderful flavor. Definitely recommend this recipe but don't be afraid to make a few changes if you don't have everything on hand!
