This is a keeper!  So easy, so flavorful.  I used more parsley, and pecans instead of walnuts because I didn't have any.  We raved about it all night.  I served it on butternut squash ravioli, and it was the perfect flavor combination, along with the nuts and apples.  Awesome fall supper!  Thank you Chef John for another winner.

I had a delicious gnocchi in Gorgonzola sauce at a restaurant and I wanted to recreate the dish at home. I loved the added crunch and flavour from the walnuts and apples. That made it better than the original dish. It's easy to make and is good enough to serve to company. I used regular cream rather than heavy cream and gnocchi instead of ravioli. I'll be making this again the exact same way.

AMAZING! I would have never thought to pair apples and walnuts with a pasta dish, but this just worked so well. My family gobbled it up and wants me to make it again! We actually used pear instead because the apple had gone bad, and it was just outstanding!

I tried this because it sounded like a dish I always get at a favorite restaurant. I only did the sauce- cream, salt pepper, cayanne, gorgonzola. I served it over penna pasta and added fresh steamed peas!!! Yum!

Make cream sauce as directed substitute parmesan for the gorgonzola. In separate pan brown italian sausage and sauteed onions and garlic. Combined cream sauce with meat then added spinach and 4 cheese ravioli finished with more parmesan. Absolutely delicious

This was truly pasta perfection!!!  The flavors and textures  compliment each other so well with the ultra creamy, zingy Gorgonzola sauce topped with just a touch of sweetness & crunch of the apple & nuts.  It seems so elegant yet it's ridiculously easy to make!  Found that the true secret to this dish is being very patient while the cream reduces & thickens.  It is well worth taking your time.   As always we  made it exactly as written.  Thank you yet again Chef John!

YUM! Made my own gnocchi and threw them in to the cream sauce once it was reduced, added the gorgonzola, parmesan, parsley and apple. Left out the nuts. This was incredible and was as good if not better than the $15 dish at my favorite Italian place.

I think I made at home what I pay big money for at one of our favorite high priced restaurants.  This one is a major keeper.  There aren't many of Chef John's recipes I don't absolutely rave about and this one is a major RAVE!

I love this. I’ve had something like this in a restaurant and was looking to find recipe. I used penne pasta and spinach and walnuts. Was excellent. I did not use apple, didn’t sound appealing to me.

Fantastic. I made the sauce only. I was skeptical since it's so simple, but it was great. I'll be making this over and over.

This dish was out of our family’s comfort zone.  I didn’t know where to look for Gorgonzola, and I’d never had apples on any pasta dish.  But I took a chance because it’s Chef John, and I’m so glad I did!  We LOVE this!  It’s easy and inexpensive and delicious.  It’s in our regular rotation now and I’ve made it 5-6 times.  Even my kids like it (without the apples though)

I loved this! I just made it and ate toooo much. I am not a fan of blue cheese so I did reduce the amount. I was very sceptical about the apples and nuts, but they were great!!! I just wish my family was as open to new dishes as I!

This is great!   I added chicken and mushrooms and used a 3 cheese tortellini.  Next time I make it I'll add garlic too.   This is very easy and I love basic recipes that you can modify.  The apple and walnuts give it a nice added flavor and crunch.

Used coconut milk, some fresh garlic, cautious on the blue cheese but it was nice not to have to grate anything and had lots of flavour without tasting overly rich. Easy and adjustable recipe.

Doubted the apple, but it was delicious.  Also, I added two strips of crumbled bacon, because......bacon.
Along with a simple garden salad, makes a nice dinner for four.   If you are cooking for two, the leftovers keep well in the fridge.  Just add a little more milk and reheat over medium low heat.  You may find it better the second night!

Fabulous, and the apples and nuts bring it to superb! Even my somewhat picky, conventional eater partner of mine raved about 'em.  :-) I subbed blue cheese for gorgonzola 'cause that's what I had and fat free half & half for fat and calories. I added amounts of blue cheese slowly to control its taste. I wanted to add a bit nutmeg due to the white sauce.  Definitely company worthy.

I made this on a camping trip.  I added some mushrooms and garlic because I had them on-hand.  This recipe is delicious and easy.  I love it when you can totally impress people with a super simple recipe and I can’t wait to try with some other variations!

Great recipe, but a few tweaks are needed to be made to take it from solid to amazing. I suggest that you use 1/3 less gorgonzola and 50% more of the parmesan to make the gorgonzola taste more like an accent instead of too sharp. Also, the recipe says it serves 6, but it and it would have only served 2.

. I used half & half because I didn’t have heavy cream and it was just a quick weekday supper with my husband. I followed it per Chef John’s recipe after that. I may have simmered it down enough because it turned out thick and tasted wonderful. I served it with TJs cauliflower gnocchi and it was perfect along side a protein.

This is so easy to make and so delicious. Definitely rich, but really tasty. I used fresh raviolis with a portabella mushroom filling. Definitely recommend that. The mushroom flavors along with the gorgonzola are the bomb!

I used Parmesan rather than Gorgonzola per other suggestions that the flavor was too strong. We initially liked the first bite or so, but it was very rich, and we weren’t able to keep eating it. I love cream sauces, but this was a bit much.

I used mozzarella filled raviolis to counter the sharper gorgonzola cheese and pecans. Fabulous!

I like it a lot but next time I will reduce or replace the amount of Gorgonzola cheese because the flavor was too intensive, specially at the end.

This was a fairly simple sauce with great results. I would definitely season to taste. I had to add more pepper and other seasoning to get the flavor up to par but again, this is to the cook's taste. I would definitely make this again.

This was not good at all. I've had gnocchi gorgonzola cream sauce before and this is NOT it.  Way too much gorgonzola flavor to the point that I could not taste anything else .

I used tortellini stuffed with Italian sausage for mine. I doubled the recipe, not knowing how filling this stuff would turn out to be. But at least now I've got plenty of leftovers.

Really tasty, ended up using oka cheese because Gorgonzola was hard to find. I will probably use peas instead of walnuts next time.

Loved this sauce.  I substituted potato gnocchis for the ravioli and added peas.  Did not add the apple or walnuts.  Very good and very rich.  I would definitely make this sauce again.

I used some pasta that I got from HomeGoods---La Piana's Mezzaluna with Gorgonzola filling.  I followed the recipe (and video) as written.  How yummy!  Thanks once again, Chef!  This was really good!
