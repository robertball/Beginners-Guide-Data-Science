This was very good.  I made it with 1% milk and didn't miss the half and half.  I put some sundried tomatoes on top of the cheese and also some on top of the egg mixture.  I highly recommend using the goat cheese rather than another kind, as the goat cheese imparts a very distinct flavor that can stand up to the strong flavors of pesto and sundried tomatoes.  I also recommend reducing the heat down to 375F as at 400F, the crust was very brown before the eggs were set, I had to tent the crust with foil.  Good recipe.

I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes a the grocery across the street so I just used sun-dried tomato pesto.  It worked really well.  The flavors really worked and it was really easy.  I didn't measure out the goat cheese or the pesto.  I just used what I wanted.  I also added a little spinach because I like the texture.

I made this for Easter brunch. It was a huge hit.I made it with milk instead of cream, low fat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes without oil that I had blanched. It was still wonderful, we never missed the extra calories. (with all the chocolate, I needed something easier on the waistline.

I made this for a Pi-Day party and everyone LOVED it! I made a few slight changes. I didn't measure the pesto, but I made a thick layer of it on the bottom. I used a 4oz package of goat cheese crumbles. I stir fried about a cup of chopped onions and mushrooms until just soft to put in with the eggs. So it wouldn't overflow, I only used 2 eggs and 1/3 cup of half and half. Awesome!

Added pine nuts the first time, and it was very very good.  But the next time, I eliminated the pesto as I felt 4 flavors were too much.  I like the goat cheese, sun-dried tomato and pine nuts combo.  Agreed about no need to measure these additions as written by another reviewer.  Do what you like which is frustrating advice for a beginner.  Follow the recipe and then decide which flavor you wish to push forward more or less or a balance.  Trust yourself and you'll learn.

Wow. This packed so much flavor. It was a huge hit. The goat cheese complemented the other flavors so well. I did add more pesto and more goat cheese because I used a deep-dish pie crust. The only thing I would recommend is pre-baking the crust. The bottom of the crust practically disintegrated under the weight of everything else, but the dish was still phenomenal.

Absolutely fantastic. Here's how I personalized it: added a diced tomato in with the egg mixture, used feta instead of goat cheese, put as much pesto as I wanted to cover the pie crust, used an awesome whole wheat pie crust, and added some fresh sliced basil from my garden sprinkled on top. YUMMERS

The flavors in this quiche are excellent. What's not good to say about Pesto, cheese and sun dried tomatoes! If we were making it again I might bake the pastry blind as the pesto made the base a little soggy. Also as suggested we used 2% instead of the cream. Overall a smashing recipe

I loved this quiche. My family, though found the taste of goat cheese overpowering. I baked it in regular pie crust and deep dish (with increae in ingredients, of course). And I used 1% milk. Worked well.

Absolutely amazing! I love the flavour the goat cheese gives it. 
I agree with other reviewers on here - just kind of adjust measurements (and even ingredients) to suit. 
I used 4 eggs, extra milk and a little extra flour. Also added some cooked mushrooms/onions. 
Flavour was excellent! It barely fed myself and 3 other flatmates so next time might even think about doubling the recipe.
Thanks for sharing!

Great! I didn't have any pesto so I increased the amount of goat cheese (too much is NEVER enough), used four eggs, a bit more half-and-half, and added chopped artichokes and a bit of herbes de Provence. Thanks.

My husband L-O-V-E-D loved this. So did I! I made a few edits - used canned diced tomatoes instead of sun-dried (those buggers are expensive!), and I added maybe a quarter pound of loose breakfast sausage. Would probably work well with Italian sausage as well. I'll definitely be making this again at hubby's request.

I reduced the pesto by half.  The layer of pesto against the crust left my crust soggy. I used egg substitute and fat free half and half without any problems. As for flavor it was just ok for me. My kids didn't like it at all. Glad I cut the pesto in half.

This was SO easy and tasted amazing for the amount of effort it required.  I didn't measure the pesto or goat cheese, I just eyeballed it.  Instead of 1/2 half & half I used skim milk with just a splash of half & half.  This is very rich with the pesto and goat cheese so I'm not sure why it would need half & half.  My boyfriend loved it and we ate the whole thing in one sitting!

I took the advise of others and put a fairly thick layer of the pesto in the bottom. I was sorry that I did that because it ruined the dish. Maybe I just don't like pesto. I also added extra sun-dried tomatoes which helped, but I wish I would have also increased the amount of goat cheese because the flavor of it got lost. The crust didn't really belong either. I make a quiche which sort of makes it's own very tasty crust and I prefer that style over using a pie crust. I love the concept of the goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes in quiche, however, and will try it out with my recipe. If it works out, I will post the recipe to this site, but it seems to take a very long time before they accept and post submitted recipes. Thanks for the great concept.

Oh my goodness! This is the best quiche I've ever had. I made it yesterday for an early Easter brunch for a bunch of friends and they loved it. I will definitely be making this again. There is no need to change a thing.

Good quiche.  I used sun-dried tomato basil feta instead of goat cheese.  Adding pesto to the quiche was a great idea!  Will make again.

We served this during Easter brunch and it was well received.  As others have mentioned, there's no need to measure the pesto or goat cheese precisely -- simply use what is necessary to cover the bottom and to suit your taste.  Also, be creative when placing the sun-dried tomatoes on top.  Presentation, taste, and originality make this a five-star quiche recipe.

I did not measure the pesto or goat cheese.  I coated the bottom of the crust with pesto and added 1/2 log of goat cheese from Costco.  I added a few sliced sun dried tomatoes on top and then added the egg mixture and topped with sun dried tomatoes and some fresh basil.  I liked it, but my husband gave it a thumbs down.  I think when he heard goat cheese was in it, that did it!

I stirred in some pesto with the eggs, and added green onions.  This quiche was amazing!  It might also be good with some chives.

Delicious! I used 2% milk as I had no half & half around, and it was still great. Instead of a pre-made crust, I used the "Cheesy Quiche Crust" recipe on this site... so good! Definitely making this one again.

Love this recipe-My husband said I could just make this everyday and he would be happy!! (Used smoked gouda as that is what I had handy) Eventually added red bell peppers and fresh tomatoes. Just keeps getting better!!!

Excellent!  I used "Classico" Basil Pesto.  I was worried because I didn't like the smell or taste of the pesto, but when the quiche was finished, it was absolutely fantastic!  My husband called it the best quiche he's ever had!

This was a wonderful dish!  I made it for my fiance for our anniversary, it was a huge hit!  The flavors fit together suprisingly well.  I admit, goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes aren't cheap, but I had left-overs of each and they're nice additions to salads and pasta salads.

This recipe was excellent!  I used low fat half and half to cut down on the fat.  I also used a little extra goat cheese on the bottom.  It was wonderful!  Everyone wished I would have made more.

I thought this was great and so easy. I did make some modifications based on other comments and what was available at the store. I eyeballed the pesto and goat cheese, putting enough to cover the bottom. My store didn’t have sun dried tomatoes, but I was able to find sun dried tomato bruschetta. I mixed that in with the egg mixture and added some artichoke bruschetta too. I also used 4 eggs instead of 3. I had no issues with burning or being soggy, but my pesto was pretty dried out, so maybe that did it.

I did change a few things: added an egg, used 3/4 cup of milk (I didn't have half and half), and used a bit of paprika instead of salt.

This has been one of my favorite quick, go-to recipes for years. I usually substitute the goat cheese with feta because it is easier to find. I also like to use julienned, oil packed sun-dried tomatoes as a little time saver. Tate’s great reheated too!

Great recipe. The combination of flavors is excellent. The only thing I changed is I mixed everything together rather than laying the tomatoes on top and pouring the mixture over the cheese. I will be making again.

You had me at "goat cheese."  I loved this recipe, the flavors compliment each other very well.  I baked the crust first and it held up to the quiche nicely.

What a fast, simple and tasty recipe! I tweaked it a couple of ways:
1. Added a cup of chopped, thawed spinach squeezed dry of any excess liquid, plus an extra tablespoon of pesto added to the wet ingredients. Spinach adds vitamins & greens!
2. I was out of half and half, so I used about the same amount of sour cream.

Note, for those who used sundried tomatoes NOT packed in oil, I used about a scant 1/3 c. of those then simmered in the microwave a minute or two before draining & again, adding to the wet ingredients.

My boyfriend who doesn't usually eat quiche ate it!!

Yum! Was looking for a 'dinner' quiche as I had an extra pie crust but didn't want to make a dessert or breakfast quiche. This was perfect. Could even add a few more eggs. Very flavorful and kind if like a pasta dish in a pie crust.

Tasted great!!  I followed the exact recipe but still needed about 2/3 more filling to completely fill the pie. Our pie crust and top got a little crispy at 400 degrees but the center wasn't fully cooked. I'd suggest baking it a bit longer at a lower temperature if you end up adding more filling like I did.

I made two of these at once (with 2%), since I knew it wouldn't yield enough for the hungry man.  I ran out of goat cheese in the first one, so in the second, I substituted with cream cheese and a little parm.  I also sauteed some mushrooms and onions for the second, as I also was short an egg.  I followed the suggestion of another, and added 1/3 cup of milk with the two eggs, since I had the mushrooms and onions in there.  They both came out great.  I can't wait to make this simple and delicious recipe again!  (I also cooked at 375F 30 mins to done.)  Thank you!!

Delicious. My changes included prebaking crust for 7 minutes and brushing with a little egg white to prevent sogginess; sauting squash, garlic, and green onion to add to egg mixture; soy milk instead of half and half; 4 eggs; and extra goat cheese on top. Pesto and goat cheese together so good.

Our only complaint was that the 30 minute cook time was too high.  After 19 minutes I pulled it out and part of the crust was a little burnt.

I had no problem with the bottom crust being soggy.

I used more goat cheese than called for And added some garlic.  It was delicious (even the piece with the burnt crust.

I loved this recipe!! I was looking for a way to use up some of our yellow teardrop tomatoes from the garden, so I just substituted that for the sundried tomatoes. Also I left out the tbsp of flour and added one more egg (just my preference) and it worked perfectly. Delicious!!

This quiche had a nice taste, but I added 5 or 6 eggs instead of the 3 and used skim milk.  It has a lot of rich flavors so the cream to me is unnecessary.  I did bake the empty shell for 10 or so minutes efore assembling so it wouldn't get soggy during cooking.

Super easy and quick to make, and soooo delicious. Didn't know where to get oil-packed sundried tomatoes in the grocery store -- finally found them with the specialty olives, capers, artichoke hearts, etc. This is an expensive dish to make, and certainly isn't low fat, but what a treat! I'm wondering if people have ideas about how to prevent the crust from absorbing so much of the pesto... didn't interfere at all with the yummy taste, but the slices could have looked better on a plate. Anyway, thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great, easy quiche.  One warning though - I made it as a lunch entree for four adults and it wasn't very filling so you may need to make extra or serve it as a side dish.

I just served this quiche at a dinner party and my guests said it was the best quiche they ever ate. I did make some changes based on what I had in the fridge: I used tomato-flavored pesto instead of sundried tomatoes plus pesto; I added some sauteed onion and mushrooms; I added a half cup of mozzerella/parmesan shredded cheese blend. I also baked the crust before adding the ingredients (in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes). Spectacular results. Great quiche. I will serve it to guests again.

I made this last night and was thrilled with the results.  I may try pesto, feta and roma next time with same basic recipe.  Delicious, thank you!!
