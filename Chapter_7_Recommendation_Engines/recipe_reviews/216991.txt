Strawberry Rhubarb Pie is my absolute favorite, but I've never made it until now.  My pie turned out excellent, with the perfect consistency and combination of tart and sweet.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added 3 tablespoons of quick tapioca to the filling.  I wanted to make sure it wasn't runny as well as keep a lot of the tartness from the rhubarb.  I don't like to add a lot of sugar to fruit pies because of the natural sweetness of the fruit.  Overall, it was delicious!

Just made this, this weekend. Wonderful recipe. Great tastes all combine wonderfully. Just be careful when baking as mine was quite juicy and ran out. Luckily I had a pan underneath and caught all spillage. Once cool it had a wonderful consistency.
Have now made this pie a couple more times, and have fixed the extra juice problem by not adding all the juice from the mixture when putting it in the pie shell, and also by sprinkling a bit of tapioca into the bottom of the shell.

I love rhubarb season!  As soon as those stalks are long  and thick enough,  I'm baking me some strawberry rhubarb pie! I do have a favorite recipe I've used for nearly 40 years, but I always like to try something new.  This is a fine recipe, but my old favorite still prevails. Never added vanilla to a fruit pie, and I found  it unnecessary. As for the cinnamon,  3/4 tsp. was overkill to me.  I want the fresh taste  of rhubarb and strawberries, not a dominating taste  of cinnamon.  A quarter tsp. was better for me, but I still found  that with this strawberry/rhubarb combination I  prefer  the 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg I typically use.  More important than these small issues,  you need to know this is a juicy pie. And even after sitting overnight, which tends to thicken it up, this was still a juicy pie. But I'm from the camp who believes that juicy is just what a good old-fashioned fruit pie SHOULD be. No gelatinous, intact wad of pie for me!  You might prefer otherwise, but for me this was just the right balance between tart and sweet. As for the crust, I  chose to use a pie crust I've used successfully for many years, "Basic Flaky Pie Crust," also from this site. Note:  After many years of hauling rhubarb annually in my suitcase to Naples so as the folks we know here  can enjoy it too (as I've done on this occasion as well), I can say with great confidence that these Floridians  like their rhubarb (unusual  for the locals and sadly missed by the former Northerners)  too!

I have never made a pie before and this recipe turned out delicious. HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR OTHER BEGINNERS LIKE MYSELF:

1. If you do not have cornstarch and look up online that 1 tablespoon cornstarch = 2 tablespoons flour like I did then it will come out a little deflated looking but the taste of it was still amazing!
2. I cut the rhubarb into smaller pieces than what was recommended because I was worried big chunks of rhubarb would be too much rhubarb at one time but I regret this decision. The rhubarb sucks up all the flavors of the pie and gives the pie a little more sustenance in each bite.
3.Homemade pie crust is worth the trouble of making!!! I bought a store bought pie crust and it came out a little undercooked when I used the cooking instructions from this recipe.
4. This is truly a beginner mistake but DONT CUT INTO THE PIE BEFORE IT SITS OUT FOR THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME! It will look like liquid mush and will ruin the prettiness of your pie.

HERE ARE A COUPLE GOOD TIPS I USED FROM OTHER REVIEWS:

1. I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1 and 1/4 cups sugar
2. I drained a little bit of the liquid from the filling mixture

This turned out great, although it was quite runny.  Most pie recipes I use have flour in them, and so the next time I make it I'll add 1/2 cup flour to the mixture (in addition to the cornstarch).

This pie is the best dessert I be ever made! I also added a package of strawberry jello and mixed it in, while c tutting back in the sugar a bit. It helps make it more less runny but keeps some natural flavor. So yummy!

I just made this pie last night.  Although the flavor was good, it looked like strawberries and rhubarb laying in strawberry soup.  There wasn't anything holding the fruit together.  I guess many people like it that way but I prefer a more firmer pie.

Made this pie today & it was really good. I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch & the filling came out nice & gooey. I did have a problem with my top crust & resorted to making a crumble instead. But otherwise did everything exactly. Also made one for my daughter & she loved it. Well definitely be making this pie for now on.

After reading the other comments, I used three tablespoons of cornstarch, cut back sugar to 1 cup and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Just the right amount of sweet and tart. Great recipe!

I've made this for quite a few years. I put all fruit in bowl first.I combine cornstarch with water in glass; sprinkle sugar over fruit, then sprinkle cornstarch, then rest of ingredients. You must let it set for the full 30 mins. After, I usually strain fruit into pie shell and only add 1/4 cup of the juice. FYI.. I use 1 container of strawberries & 3/4 # of rubarb. About 3 cups of berries & 2 cups of rubarb.

I added one extra tablespoon of cornstarch as suggested by others.  Perfect pie!  I gave as a birthday gift to a dear friend who cut a slice right away.  Perfect combination of tart and sweet!

This pie was great! I loved the spices in it, and it was a hit with my family. It was a little soupy initially, but a night in the fridge firmed it up.

In order for the pie not to be soupy, you'll need  at least 1/4 to 1/3 cup cornstarch.  Two Tablespoons is way too little.  Rhubarb gives off lots of liquid.

Based on reviews, I did more research before I used my precious seasonal rhubarb.  I followed the recipe but put in 4 T cornstarch.  The result was very sweet but a great thick texture to the pile which plated up nice. Though others liked it, I did not like the cinnamon/ vanilla flavors and did not feel they were needed.  Remade as follows: put the chopped rhubarb in a bowl. Stir in 3/4 to 1 c sugar and 4 T Cornstarch.  Add 1 t lemon or orange peel to balance the sourness of rhubarb, you won't taste the peel but it brings out the flavor.  Lemon juice and the water not needed.  With changes, I'll make again.

went with 3 cups Rhubarb and 2 cups Strawberry, mostly to use up the Rhubarb I bought. Like others I added another Tbs Corn Starch, which also means some more water. The mixture sitting 30 minutes gets very juicy, so I used a slotted spoon to scoop into pie shell, then added 2 tbs of juice. Sweetness level was good. Flavor just slightly off good ones I have eaten in the past...maybe too much cinnamon?

I used this recipe three times last summer when I made my favorite pie.  I forgot to save the recipe to my recipe box then, but looking I found it again.  I remembered her story about the rhubarb, and saved it this time.  Served it to my neighbors last summer as they bake a lot of pies.  They loved it, and decided to add strawberries to their rhubarb pies from now on.  There isn't a better combo then sweet and tart.  I'm making one right now.

This is the first time we ate strawberry rhubarb pie and we loved it! We don't like things too sweet, so I cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup, but I think I still need to cut it back just a bit more. It has sugar on top of the crust, plus the cinnamon and vanilla in the mix creates a natural sweetener. We will definitely eat this pie again. Five stars!

I added additional corn starch as even though my rhubarb was frozen and drained, it was way too runny.  I put in about 4T of cornstarch.

I doubled the recipe.  I was short 1 cup of rhubarb and substituted some fresh black cherries (I pitted) that I had.  I cut back the sugar to 2 cups instead of 2 1/2 cups.  I tripled the cornstarch/water mixture and I still had trouble with some soupiness (which I drained real quick before putting in pies.). This had very good flavor and the black cherries didn’t interfere with this great tasting pie.  Oops, almost forgot— I added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  BTW, make sure you put a piece of parchment paper between your pie and the cookie sheet you place it on in the oven.  It’ll save you some clean-up, my dears.

This is my go-to strawberry rhubarb pie recipe!  My Grandmother used to make it for me when I was young and it has always been my favorite.  She passed away a few years ago from Alzheimer’s and due to the disease I was never able to get her recipe from her.  This recipe nails it on how I remember hers tasting!  I follow the recipe exact and never have any issues with it being “soupy”. I do let it cool completely and then refrigerate it till ready to eat.  If you’re not in the mood for pie, make the filling as specified in the recipe and heat it up on the stove to desired thickness.  After it cools, spoon over vanilla ice cream!

Turned out a lot better than I expected! Everyone enjoyed it! Made a double recipe (risky for a first trial!) with locally grown strawberries (slightly thawed from frozen and sliced) and rhubarb from my garden.  I did add the cinnamon and vanilla, but also added 1.5 Tbsp flour per recipe to the fruit mixture.  I used commercial pie shells that I half baked and lined with toasted bread crumbs before filling with the fruit mixture.  I opted to just top the pie with a crisp topping.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe’s directions.  The pie tasted fruity and light, not too sweet or runny.  I think the cinnamon and vanilla gave depth to the flavour of this pie.  I would definitely make this again, and it’s a tasty way to use up my rhubarb!

Two tablespoons of corn starch wasn't enough.  Although the pie tasted good, it was watery.

I increased the cornstarch from 2 to 3 tbsp and added 2 tbsp of flour, as well as 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I also doubled the water and vanilla and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  I think it was still too sweet, next time I'll use 1/2 cup of sugar.  I used a 10 in glass pan instead of the recommended 9 in and didn't have any spillover while baking.  I let it sit for about 6 hours to cool completely before cutting and it kept its shape.

Very good, not runny at all.  Used 3 cups of each fruit, omitted cinnamon and vanilla.  While fruit was sitting in cornstarch/sugar I had it in a colander. A lot of liquid drained but so did sugar.  It was a little tart so when serving we added a dollop of sweet Dandelion Jelly...excellent!

The vanilla and cinnamon seemed strange additions, but they worked perfectly with the strawberries and the rhubarb.
Superb!

I added 3 tbls corn starch and used a solid top crust that had small vents cut in it. It turned out delicious and not watery. I used 1 1/4 cups sugar and no sugar on top crust.

I LOVE LOVE this recipe!!! I have shared it many times over. I do add more cornstarch as it gets a bit runny for my tastes. the first time I did not add the cinnamon as it did not sound good to me...the second time I did add it and it made all the difference in the world!! Brought out all the flavors!!!

Recipe is easy to follow, and comes with a good result. I wish I took another reviewer's recommendation to reduce the amount of sugar, as I am a fan of tartness. The insides are still delicious, so if you prefer a more sweet version you are fine.

I also replaced the special sugar with light brown sugar, a similarly acting ingredient. The resulting crust looked very brown, unless that was from the position in the oven.

All in all, good piece, and would make again!

I have made this pie a few times and it is AMAZING. I never get leftovers when I take this to any event. Use some extra creamy whipped cream or make your own and add vanilla and cinnamon and you have a combo where you could finish half a pie by yourself. I 100% recommend this pie and share this recipe with everyone.

Delicious! I cut back on the sugar to only 1 cup but we like our rhubarb tart. I also left out the cinnamon as I don't care for it. Still, it was yummy and the proportion of rhubarb to strawberries was perfect.

I followed the directions to a T and the pie turned out with way too much liquid which I had to remove from the pie.  I questioned the small amount of corn starch, but went ahead with the amounts listed in the recipe.  A rule of thumb (according to chef John)  1 table spoon of corn starch per cup of fruit.  In this case 5 table spoons of corn starch would have been better

This was the best Strawberry Rhubarb revipe ive ever made. I let the fruit set up for several hours before baking because i didnt have time to bake and didnt want to heat house up but i could tell it was not going to disappoint. I will make again but with a different crust recipe than the one i found.

Definitely will make again.  It was slightly runny, but it was because I didn’t have the desired amount of Rhubarb.  Had it for dinner a la mode and for breakfast the next day! Yum!

BEST PIE EVER!
As others suggested I used 1C sugar.  I used 3T corn starch and mixed it in with the sugar mixture.  Omitting the water.
I’ve got a lot of rhubarb  & strawberries in my freezer!  Can’t wait to make this again!

Homemade crust.  Ruth’s Grandmas pie crust.  Substitute butter for shortening.  Makes a lot but freezes well.

My husband absolutely loves the flavor of this pie, I want to thank you for that. I have made it twice, both times the pie has been very runny. I believe next time I will try the thickening that I use for my raspberry pie.

Flavor was great.  I would add more cornstarch next time, as this was still runny after cooling for several hours.  I used more rhubarb than strawberries.

My pie stuck to the bottom of the pie dish.  It was a royal little mess getting it out and onto plates, and then nobody had great things to say about it except a couple tepid "it's good" comments.  To be fair, I served this to real rhubarb pie aficionados, but I can't help but be disappointed.

Great recipe! I added a little more lemon because I like the tartness; maybe doing so  made the filling a little more runny, but it was super good! Easy recipe to follow; I didn't blind bake the crust and it turned out fine.

This pie turned out delicious, but I was very nervous that I would make yet another soupy rhubarb pie after reading the reviews.  I decided to try a few of the other reviewers' suggestions.  I increased the corn starch to 1/4 cup, sprinkled tapioca on the bottom crust plus substituted a little less than 1/4 cup of strawberry jello for 1/4 cup of the sugar.  It may have been overkill, but I can't stand runny, soggy rhubarb pie!  Next time, I will probably eliminate the egg white wash because the crust turned brown too quickly.

I made it last night, and used a different pie crust receipt. I wish I pre-baked the pie shell. Was not sure about pouring everything into pie shell, so I just  scooped in the fruit. With the top crust being one piece, I cooked the pie 25 min longer, it came out great!!

First time making a pie other than Apple, followed the directions to a T and was told that it was too runny and was too sweet. Tried a piece next day to see for myself and agreed. The rest of the pie is just going to waste

I've made a lot of strawberry rhubarb pies, as it was my husband's favorite and a favorite of all 3 of my sons.  This recipe got a BIG thumbs up from everyone including my grandbabies who usually don't like pie!  I didn't change a thing.  I used my own crust recipe.

This pie was delicious.  I gave it a 4 only because I left out the cinnamon and vanilla.  Otherwise followed exactly.  Measurements were perfect, cook time was perfect.  Some others pre-cook rhubarb - all the way back to my great grandmother we have never done that so I don't either.  The cornstarch thickens it enough so it's not too juicy and as long as you cut your rhubarb about 1/2 inch thick you should be fine.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.

I made this pie this morning and it turned out delicious. 
I used frozen berries and rhubarb so I added one more tbspoon of corn starch. I didn't add any lemon or cinnamon. 
After I was done baking, I let the pie cool down for 2hours. I think I should have left it for one more hour, cuz it was still warm and with the first slice some juice came out of it. 
Overall it wasn't soggy or anything. I am very happy with the results.

would've been perfect except a bit too sweet, cut back sugar
by 1/2 c  and cut cinnamon in half...is zippy and fresh-tasting.
don't use rhubarb that is (even a little) woody - cooking doesn't
fix stringiness.  also be sure to let pie sit in (turned off) oven
after baking for 1/2 hr to ensure filling won't have "floury" flavor

Made this tonight for a work function on Thursday. I haven't been able to try it yet, but I made it exactly to the recipe and it smells amazing! Made it early because I want to allow time for it to set, based on the info I got from other reviews. Only downfall, my lattice work is subpar at best, so I wish it had been prettier.

What a marvellous pie! Using a sprinkling of turbinado sugar  created an interesting texture on the lattice crust. We added some lemon zest and juice to our taste, but I would recommend this receipt to anyone. Using the lattice top crust maximized evaporation of excess juices and placing the pie low in the oven ensured a flakey bottom crust. Five good sized stalks of rhubarb makes a full 9" pie.

I used more corn starch to thicken it and I'm sad I didn't use more sugar but it was very good. Next time I will use sugar and some butter :-) very good

This is delicious!!!!! Based on other reviews, I added another Tbsp of corn starch and substituted 1/4 tsp of nutmeg for 1/4 tsp of the 3/4 tsp called for in original recipe. 
I liked the spices in it, but I think I would cut them a little next time (I'm thinking 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon & nutmeg) I also think that I will add more rhubarb and less strawberries next time. I used fresh picked local strawberries that have a lot of flavor and they overpowered the rhubarb too much. Still delicious but I definitely would've liked more rhubarb flavor.
I did not let the filling sit as recipe called for. And I did not remove any juice. And I had quite a bit of spillage.

Simple to make and the flavor was great. I used 1 cup of sugar (instead of 1  1/4 cups) and 1/2 cup or so more rhubarb because my family prefers their rhubarb more sour. I also omitted the turbinado sugar because I didn't have any on hand. The pie was wonderful and easy to adjust for individual tastes. My 5 year old loved it and my husband had it again for breakfast.

This pie is the best!  I did not change anything.  My husband said its the best tasting strawberry rhubarb pie he's ever had.  The lattice was beautiful and we loved the turbinado sugar sprinkled on top.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this pie for a special friend of mine at the coffee shop and it looked so good I made one for my husband and myself.  It was my first time making this pie and it was delicious.  My husband and our friend thought it was wonderful.

This is an awesome recipe! I made a reduced sugar version with 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup of sweetener for my diabetic husband and he loved it. I will definitely make this again!!!

I really enjoyed how this pie turned out.  It's been about 10 years since I made a homemade strawberry rhubarb pie.   would cut back on the sugar next time, as my husband is diabetic.  I worried about him eating 2 pieces of it. All is well though.  :)

I have  made this pie five times since my rhubarb has come in this year! The only change I've made is using a 1\4 tsp. Nutmeg in place of the cinnamon and vanilla. It is wonderful and you will not be disappointed.

Very good! Like others, I did not use all of the juices after letting it sit for 30 minutes. I also put a couples teaspoons of flour and a few pats of butter over the fruit before putting the top pie crust on. Although it ran over in the oven, it was not a juicy mess when I served it. I also left out the cinnamon and the lemon juice.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit!! I used Gala apples so they're a bit sweet, the rhubarb is tart and made for a perfect amount of sweetness.

I tried this recipe today (07/07/2014), and it is pure awesome. So juicy, and so good! Reminds me of my childhood, and my mom's strawberry rhubarb pies. Just one thing: if you're using store-bought pie shells, try a deep dish one, or just back off the recipe slightly to avoid overflow.

Great flavor, I never would have thought to add cinnamon. This one is as good as my grandmothers!  The consistency was great on mine, it gelled  perfectly.

I have to say that it was the best pie my family has ever tasted and became one of our favorites! I will always use this recipe when making strawberry rhubarb pie. The only problem about it was that it left me wanting more...If your looking for a yummy with the perfect amount of sweetness kind of pie, this recipe is for you. It's my favorite way to use my rhubarb we grow. You won't be unsatisfied.

Absolutely yummy. It's in my recipe box, and its the ONLY strawberry rhubarb I use.
