This is pretty authentic.  I've seen a few "Viet" recipes submitted here which use ingredients that don't belong but I don't fault them since they are probably not Viet.  The only thing this is missing is a few spices which are commonly used in pho but it is all dependent on your taste.  Typically cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and probably a few others I can't remember now are also used.  I've made pho for years and have yet to come up with my perfect spice ratio.  It makes a big difference :)

Another reviewer mentioned that their pot came out too oily.  There a few ways to remove it.  You can increase your knucklebone to marrow bone ratio (more knuckle).  Or you can get a very fine mesh strainer sold at most Asian grocery stores and when you skim the scum out it is also fine enough to remove oil or just use a spoon to remove.  Another method is to let the pot cool, then put it in the refrigerator for a few hours.  The oils will harden and it can then be removed before you warm up the pot again.  The last thing is that you can probably get away with simmering for 3-4 hours but of course longer is better and you'll have to add more spices/salt to make up for it.  He simmers for a super long time which is why he used less spices.

Great easy recipe. As is, it only deserves 4 stars because of some small things missing. I have an asian market close by where they sell EVERYTHING you need to cook asian. If you have access to one of these markets, you can modify this recipe for under 10$ and it will make it a perfect 5 star. This recipe lacked 2 major things, salt and flavour. As written, it makes a great soup base but even 8 hours into cooking, the broth is tasteless. In order to make it better, i replaced the salt with dried pho broth mix, it basically condensed broth with salt. It not only adds the precious saltyness this recipe needs but also makes the broth tastier. I added about 5 tablespoons for the above recipe. Also, you can buy ready-made pho chinese spices. It's a small pouch full of spiced that will compliment any pho recipe, basically star anise, dried coriander and fennel seeds, whole shichuan peppercorn, cinnamon and cloves. This is a must have, a small packet costs less than 2$ and add so much personality to the broth. I also love my pho with beef tendon, so I blanched tendon right before starting the broth and added it to the broth mix for the full 8-10 hours of cooking time. This maked the tendon as tender as jello and goes well with the beef or chicken.

This is definitely, as the name implies, authentic tasting! I followed the recipe exactly, and it worked out well, with the exception that I would add less salt initially and let everyone taste and add as they desire, since most fish sauce and other add-ins are also salty. One caveat--the broth ends up with quite a bit of fat in it from the marrow in the bones. (This, even though I used grass-fed beef, which is generally leaner). In fact, when you eat the broth, a thin coating of fat stays on your lips. Great, if you are a poor peasant in Vietnam. Not so great for me, I thought. Simple solution-- make the recipe a day ahead, and chill the broth after straining. Then skim the hardened fat off the broth before reheating and proceeding with the recipe. This recipe is a great one for older children to make, if nothing else, as a reminder of how many people in this world cannot afford to waste any part of an animal, including the bones. Also a lesson in respect for any animal that died to feed you i.e. don't waste it! Also a good introduction to ethnic cuisine, and they can leave out the veges if they choose.

I have made this recipe many times, and it is outstanding! Every winter I make this, and my mother and husband rave about how great it is. The first two times I made this I kept the recipe as is, but now I like to combine this recipe with the spices from a Pho recipe on the Serious Eats website. The spice mixture that I use is:  3 whole star anise pods, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, 4 cloves, 1 teaspoon coriander seeds. I place all of this into cheesecloth as I'm cooking the broth, and I let it simmer for a LONG time (sometimes overnight!). Absolutely amazing!

I agree with several of the other comments that it turned out a bit greasy, which, as another commentor pointed out, is easily resolved after the fact, but just be aware that if you don't want it greasy, you'll have to fix it. I also thought that for the amount of time you had to cook it, it didn't really have a ton of flavor, and I personally felt that it needed a lot more salt. My husband is a chef, however, and he absolutely loved it, so I've given it a 4/5. He also pointed out that I probably boiled it a bit too hard, which makes the broth cloudy. He said 'simmer it really low and don't stir it, and you'll have a nice, clear broth'. FYI. Anyway, in the end, once you add all the accoutrements, it's pretty darn tasty.

Little late to the ballgame here, first post... but to those complaining about it coming out greasy/oily: when making a broth or stock, you should ideally skim the fat off the surface a couple times an hour with a ladle or large spoon to remove.  Great recipe, I didn't blacken the onion as I find it greatly reduces the flavor and added a stalk of bruised lemon grass for the last 30 minutes of simmer.  Delicious!

So Good! My boyfriend will drive 2 hours for good pho. I made this for Valentines and he actually said it was the best he'd ever had. He's a chef so if he says its good, then its really GOOD!

Very good, if you use beef ribs and beef broth gives great beefy flavor. I used some beef base for a little extra flavor then poured through cheese cloth to get the fat and bones. Added two teaspoons of garlic and Chinese five spice. Very clear broth with lots of flavor. Yummy!!!

Taste was wonderful - but it turned out a bit oily/greasy. Have looked back over the recipe and not sure what I did wrong. Can you advise?

I have made this a couple times now, both successfully.  I make a few slight tweaks.  First, like other users, refrigerate the sauce after simmering and wait for the fat to solidify, then simply scoop it off.  Secondly, to avoid babysitting the stove all day, I use a large crockpot - I start it on high then reduce to low once a boil is reached.  Many restaurants simmer their pho for over 18 hours - I let this go on the crockpot for anywhere from 12-24 hours.  I use double or even triple the star anise in the recipe and add about 1 tbsp of extra fish sauce (the end result has been fine to my taste, but consider cutting the salt a bit to offset the extra saltiness here).  Lastly, I throw in a couple garlic cloves.  The end result is very close to restaurant quality!

this recipe did not work out for me.  I baked the soup bones and then simmered per the recipe.  The bones were fresh but the smell and taste were not like I've had in a restaurant.

I'm currently making this for the first time, and I will come back to update when I taste the end product.  

I simmered the bones for awhile and the broth ended up being too strong.  I watered it down to taste, measured the broth to see how much there was, and it's right around 7 cups.  So, for my own notes and as a point of reference for other people who try this, you'll want to add enough water to make 7 cups of broth after you strain the bones and such out of the broth.  Adjust to your preference from there, boiling off water or adding water.  I simmered the bone broth for about 7-8 hours total.

I love this recipe and I love the delicious pho!
I live in the Seattle area and there are many opportunities for pho. Some have been good. Some have been...funky. 

This recipe, though it takes some time, is jaw-droppingly simple and delicious. I will say that it's really nice to live near an Asian supermarket for authentic ingredients where I can get THINLY sliced cuts of beef.

I still like going out for pho, but I enjoy making it at home and knowing the secret of its broth.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I thought the broth was very bland, and missing something. I've made the "Day After Thanksgiving Turkey Pho", also from this site, and the spices and ratio to water in that recipe is more to my liking. I did like the top sirloin in this one though. To get really thin slices of the beef, partially freeze it first, and then slice thinly with a chef's knife.

The flavors were excellent.  I would recommend simmering the broth longer than six hours, as it did not reach the level of richness I wanted in that time period.  I would also make sure the stock is very hot before finishing the bowls.  I used large bowls and added additional veggies and the stock was not hot enough to bring everything up to temp.  That said, I will make this again and correct my first time mistakes.

Turned out great!!!  I used Elk bones and a spice kit from the asian market. For those that thought it greasy. Pho is kind of supposed to be. The fats and gelatin that are rendered from the bones are vitamin rich and super good for you.  I do tend to fill the pot back up with water in the last hour of cooking in order to serve more but all in all no complaints.

This tasted very much like the pho i get from local restaurants. The biggest difference is the noodles. I assume restaurants use fresh noodles.  I'm happy to know how this delicious soup is made, but from now on I'll leave all the hassle to the many vietnamese restaurants here in San Diego.

My brother and I both made this around the same time. Used fresh bones with lots of marrow and deliciousness. Followed the instructions exactly. The soup tasted very watered down. It was very disappointing. I ended up adding beef bouillon to give it some flavor.

For sake of simplicity and easiness...I don't  have 6 hours to cook! I used a premix store bought pho spices. You can find it in an oriental  grocery store. I boil pork rib bones or beef bones with the spices for 1 hour, then follow the rest of the recipe. I like it spicy, so I add fresh Thai chilli pepper and Ning Chi Chilli Sauce.

If you have a large enough slow cooker you can set the broth going and have pho for supper after work. This recipe is great, it tastes just like the pho at my favorite restaurant!

This will get you a pretty good homemade Pho.  Soak sliced onions in rice vineger, then remove from vinegar when preparing the bowls. This adds  a lot of flavor. You will have to adjust salt/fish sauce to taste... I like more fish sauce then recipe says.

Changed up the recipe a bit, I'm allergic to onion so I added 4 cloves fresh chopped garlic and a handful of basil to my stock. For my first Vietnamese dish, both my husband and I were presently surprised at how well it came out!!

This recipe is lovely just as is. I've worked in a Vietnamese restaurant for a couple years, and have produced results comparable to their pho using this. The spices can be adjusted and added to. I know a lot of folks enjoy a bit of cinnamon or clove in their broth, but as I do not, I really enjoyed the balance of spices in this. To folks complaining of a fatty turnout, understand that with bone broth such as this, a healthy amount of residual fat is rather the goal. The rich, rendered fats in pho broth are what make it such a nourishing meal, and a great hangover cure to boot! One can reduce the fattiness of the finished product by using less marrow bone and more knuckle. Excess fat can and should be skimmed off during cooking, but a slightly oily finish is one of the hallmarks of good pho. Will save and make again!

Tip for removing fat from hot stock/broth without chilling. Place your pot over a garbage container and drag a paper towel over top of stock pot let stock drip off back into pot and drop towel into garbage, continue until you see all the fat is gone.

It wasn't mind blowing for the amount of time and  effort. Extremely fatty.  It was very good, though.

This was very good.  Everyone in my family said it was missing  garlic . I added some garlic salt and it definitely made a difference. I would make it again.

My husband & I used to drive 1 hour one way to get AUTHENTIC pho (it's in the bad part of town with bars on the windows, therefore authentic). When I found & made this recipe once, we knew we had a keeper. Tastes just like the authentic pho we had at the restaurant. It does take some time to prepare, but it is totally worth it. Now it's become our Christmas day tradition to have Pho. Just one more thing to look forward to at the holidays. Thank you so much for the recipe.

DELICIOUS! We made a few changes though. My boyfriend used a pre-made beef stock and cooked beef sirloin. I'm a vegetarian, so I used a veggie broth and subbed deep fried tofu in place of the meat. We simmered for 1.5hrs. Thee best veggie pho I've ever tried! They were both a hit and fast to make. mm mmm :)

This takes a while to make but it was yummy. I used chicken instead of beef, and added a pho spice pack from oriental store- otherwise I followed the  recipe. Thank you- this was my first attempt at making pho!

I agree, it was very greasy.  Although the aroma was exactly like authentic pho I've had with Vietnamese neighbors, the taste was very bland.  I even made it a second time, doubling the spices, but the grease was too much.

This pho is so delicious and very easy to customize into a vegetarian recipe, believe it or not! 
Loved the flavor of the star anise in this soup, and the roasted onion is genius.

I loved this recipe but there is only one thing missing, whole cinnamon sticks. Add 3 or 4 of them to the broth at the same time as the star anise and you'll be pleasantly surprised in the flavor! Enjoy!

I made this.  I tried to follow the recipe very closely, particularly the recipe for the broth, which is crucial to good Pho.

I was disappointed.  It (the broth) was missing something.  For a better cook and a more dedicated pho lover this recipe might be a good starting point, but be forewarned: making pho from scratch is no easy undertaking, and some experimentation is necessary to get it right.

I'll just be getting it from a local Vietnamese restaurant.

This recipe was awesome! I don’t think I added enough hoisin sauce; but the recipe was spot on. Our favorite Phô place adds MSG; and since that gives me a headache, I’ve resorted to making my own. To this recipe, I’ve added alfalfa sprouts, which give a great crunch, and various meats, such as slices of a dry roast that didn’t turn out so well and hot Italian sausage, made into little balls. Thought I had ginger, but couldn’t find any. So, next time, I’ll try it with some ginger. Overall, this is a winning recipe!!

I substituted an Asian bouquet especially for pho instead of using the star anise. It didn't contain ginger, so I added it. Turned out so delicious! I really didn't mind the long process either!

I couldn’t find bean sprouts during winter season, but I supplemented with sweet pea sprouts and they were delish! This is a dish worth trying. Excellent flavor. Best to go to an Asian store to bet the Anise and rice noodles if available. Sooo good!!

Love this so much and impressed my vietnamese gf but found handy to drain off fat while cooking and cooked broth for a longer time and improved with few special ingredients from her family friend and there market store.

Made this and my stock has no depth and is lacking something crucial. I’m pretty sure the main thing is that this recipe doesn’t call for toasted coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. It doesn’t taste like Phó, but it does taste like a nice beef stock.

I made this exactly as written. I didn't know which beef bones to buy so I bought Rumba beef marrow bones. I think they were perfect because all the grease melted off in the oven when I roasted the bones for an hour. My finished broth was not greasy at all and was clear. The taste was delicious. I just had to add more salt for my preference. I'm also used to being served fresh slices of jalapeno with the other veges, so I added that as a topping. I didn't need the housin or chili sauce as I think that takes away the flavor of the broth. I will be making this again but adding a few extra spices I saw in some other recipes although this was great as is. Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent! And should have double it. We love Pho but can’t enjoy bc of high sodium In the restaurant versions.
I try to always make a recipe, the first time, exactly as written. Based on a reading couple other recipes, and the flavor profile, I knew a few little things were missing. My apologies.

5 slices of Ginger? I used a knob the size of my thumb and sliced it.
Additional spices: 2 star of Anise, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 tsp whole cloves, 1 tsp dried red pepper fakes, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp Chinese 5 spice, Fish Stock,  only 1 tsp salt, and last hour I threw in the stems from our cilantro.
After rinsing the rice noodles, I did pour a smidge of Sesame Oil over them to prevent sticking.
Lastly, I bought thin sliced low sodium boar’s head roast beef from the deli counter and requested super rare. Worked really well! 
Will make this recipe again and again ... and forwarded to my kids who also love Pho

Great base recipe!! I simmered the stock in a crockpot for 12 hours. I might experiment with a couple of additional spices, but as I said it’s a great base. Dress it to your taste and enjoy! 
By the way, this is my first attempt at cooking something other than Kraft Mac and Cheese, so if I can figure it out, so can you!

Delicious!  We couldn't find star anise pods, so we had to make this dish without that ingredient.  We added Sriracha to our  individual bowls so each person could control their own 'heat'.

Probably three stars how it wound up, but it was user error and I could tell that this recipe would be great if made properly, so I'm giving it the full five anyways. I used the bones from a steak my mom had made recently, which was 4lbs before the meat was removed, not 4lbs of bones, so it was not as flavorful as it should have been but still pretty good. 
Pho is a traditional family food, not because of any Vietnamese ancestry but because my parents went to a pho restaurant together the day they met. Normally we go to a restaurant when we want pho, but it's fun to try making it ourselves every once in a while, and even with my mistake this recipe turned out the closest to right we've ever managed. My dad was telling me when I started that I should reduce the amount of fish sauce, but I used the full amount and while it did smell like too much at first, it tasted just about right after the several hours of simmering. Really, the only thing wrong was the reduced beef flavor; the spicing was about perfect as far as I could tell, though based on the other reviews it's quite possible that I'll want to double the flavorings once the beef broth is at full strength and potentially able to drown them out. We're planning to save beef bones in the freezer over the next few months and try making this again as soon as we have enough, so I'll find out then.

I absolutely love pho and am trying difference recipies trying to get it right.  This, saddy, lacked flavor.  I ended up adding many additional spices, which did help.  My family liked it.  For how long it takes I'm not sure I'd make it again.  Seems like I can buy pho mix at an Asian store with much less effort.  My search continues for the perfect pho.....

Delicious recipe, I needed to add more salt to the broth to make it more savory and tasteful. You can add soy sauce or more hot spices such as sriracha or peppers if you don't want to add more sodium to it, for whatever reason.

This was great! Regarding the grease: I skimmed the top a few times to get the grease off. Also, those criticizing it please not that most Pho places (at least the ones I’ve been to) use a coffee carafe type serving vessel with the spout at the bottom because the fat rises to the top. Anywho: I Added Chinese 5 spice and fennel seeds (about 1 tbsp of each) also went with 3 star anise pods instead of 2. I also doubled the salt. First time I’ve ever made Pho and it was AMAZING! Also added meatballs and shrimp (both pre-cooked and thawed from the local Asian market)

Ive made this recipe many times over the years and absolutely  love it. I eaten at many Vietnamese restaurants to compare and I believe this recipe is tastier than most. I dont agree with the fat accusations in this recipe. Im curious about how they are going about the beef bone in the broth. The broth needs some fat for flavor so I will not omit. I would be careful about simmering. You have to simmer it on low heat to prevent the broth from becoming too rich.  If that's the case, simply add more water to dilute. I belive this recipe is fabulous.

To save time I used premade beef stock.  I still simmered with onion and spices for 6 hours and it turned out delicious.  I plan on making my own broth next time with the bones because I know it will be perfect,  but  no one could tell the difference.

It's smelled like my favourite pho place so I was really excited about this but it turned out SO BLAND!!! Followed the recipe exactly and ended up with water broth!! Even added extra onion, and soup bones for more flavour and nothing. Was missing that rich beef flavour! So I added more onion (raw), a few mushrooms and more beef to the leftovers as I didn't want to throw it out! This gave it a much richer taste! Also add more anise and Salt... like go to town. I would also have beef broth or a cube ready to add more flavour also.

It was ok. We live near Viet community and they have got heaps of restaurants that serve Pho. Along with numerous shops... We have tried many different Pho and this one is not the best. It's   n i c e   but that's it. It's missing half of spices like cardamom, fennel seeds, corriander seeds etc (i bought a mix made for Pho)... Also it didn't have that full flavor (Ox tale would deffo help with that!)... Bottom line...it's good but not good enough...Ps also not salty at all!  I did skim the fat while cooking (cooked for 8hours on low) it wasn't oily at all!

The pho base taste seemed almost as if it was diluted. Lots of hard work, but sadly, no pay. If you want to waste half a day cooking then this is the pho recipe for you!!

I've never made Pho before but it is o e of my husband's favorite meals.   Though this takes a lot of time, I put the stock in the crock pot overnight, it was not difficult and my husband loved it! He asked me to save the recipe so I could make it again

My first time eating Pho and my first time making Pho.  I’m really enjoying it but I will say that I altered the recipe a bit for my own personal takes.  I took the advice from others on here and let the broth sit overnight in order to get as much of the grease out as possible.  Instead of adding steak at the end I ended up using shrimp, which was delicious.  Babybok

Makes a very basic pho.  We purchased pho spice pouches online and added them to the broth for the last hour and a half which really helped get a stronger flavor.  We also used a gravy separator to skim the excess fat and oil off.

This was delicious.  The one note I have is that the broth turned out a bit too rich, and overpowered the other flavors.  This is my fault as I boiled it down too far, and could have been solved by adding a bit more water along the way.  

Pho is all about customization for me and my family.  So the base recipe is great.  And then you add sriracha, and limes, and hoisin, and - and - and...

Very good recipe if you have the patience to do the work.

Good basic recipe for a first try, but we were looking for the pop that really kicks it up a notch. We combined this with another recipe (more spices), cardamon, cinnamon sticks, cloves, garlic, coriander. I also made meatballs to put in it. So good!

I made this dinner for my family today, and they really enjoyed it!! I did make a few changes based on other people's reviews and it worked out nicely. First off, when simmering the beef bones, I used my crock pot and let it summer on low overnight and then I put it in refrigerator to cool so I could skim the grease off the top (That is a must). Then, because someone mentioned that it didn't have enough flavor, I doubled up the spices, BUT, the first half was added to the simmering beef bones and the second half was added after the bones were removed. The taste was perfect!!! I also cooked the beef sirloin on the grill, I know that is not authentic, but for past health issues is why it was done, it still tasted delicious. I will be adding this to my dinner repertoire. I highly recommend adding both the hoisin and  sriracha sauce.

I am sensitive to smell and was a little worried while I was making this dish.  However, it was wonderful.  I added the optional Hoisin Sauce and Sriracha Sauce.  It was a perfect combination to the Pho.  This is a make again dish for our family.

I'm a relative newbie regarding pho. My husband was in Louisiana for his job and a few co-workers took him out and introduced him to pho. For that, I'm eternally grateful!  This was my first attempt, and I don't think it turned out bad at all! I took the suggestions of others and added a few cloves, cinnamon sticks and garlic.  It was fantastic! I'll discover my own special blend and it has GREAT potential to become one of my favorite recipes.

I did try to Americanize it by adding broccoli and mushroom. The flavors didn't work. Won't do that again! ??

The only downfall is that it didn't make too much. I was hoping for at least one more meal and although we do have a bit more broth, it's not enough for two. I'll keep that in mind for next time.  Despite this, I'm looking forward to making this again very soon!

I do not eat seafood and really have a difficult time with the scent of fish or seafood. I made this, hoping that the fish sauce would be basically tasteless in the broth as many people indicated. unfortunately, its scent was strong and along with the cinnamon and star anise, it was too much for me. I really tried to like it, I really wanted to like it! I’m sad that it didn’t turn out like I had hoped.

Great recipe.  I adapted it to a pressure cooker (Instant Pot) to cut down on the simmering time (2 hrs instead of lots).  Turned out awesome! Also added a few additional spices (cloves, schezuan peppercorns, and a couple coriander pods).

I took the suggestions in the comments and added two cinnamon sticks, and about a tablespoon each of black peppercorns, cardamom, and garlic. I also chilled it to get rid of the excess fat.  I also took out the star anise pods after about 2 hours since I didn’t want too much of that flavor.  The house smelled WONDERFUL while it cooked!

This recipe is a good starter. It is a fairly simple recipe as well. I have never make bone broth or pho before so maybe the choice of bone matters (I used 4lbs. of marrow bones). I agree with those that say the broth was too greasy and bland. After a taste test after 1 hr of simmering I skimmed as much oil from the top as I could and added 3 cloves, 1/2 cinnamon stick, 1 cardamom pod, 1 garlic clove with peel, and about 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Hopefully that makes it more edible.

Fantastic! So cheap and easy to make! 

A real "set it and forget it" kind of meal lol It took about 8 hours to make the stock really rich and tasty, but it turned out beautifully. Once it's done the only major work is the veggie prep for your pho sides

Delicious, however can be a little greasy- best to either let the stock cool and skim the top or use a gravy separator to extract excess fat
adding a little extra fish sauce at the end also helps balance this out
other than that a great recipe! will defiantly be making this again

OK the only thing I suggest is this recipe is oily but the trick is make the bone broth the day before put it in the fridge and remove all the extra fat that builds up on the top and it will not be oily other than that it taste exactly like the recipe that I eat at the restaurant plus I added jalapeños sliced up because I remember that they put that at the restaurant

I followed the recipe pretty close to exactly, however; I let the broth cook for almost 20 hours.  the bone i had was not chosen by me, it was from a half a cow that we purchased and soup bone. the bone was a bit fattier than I typically would like and next time i will attempt to choose a less fatty bone/meat.  I am not a huge fan of salt, but this recipe definitely lacks it regardless. otherwise the recipe was ok.

Very authentic, just like restaurant.  Does take 3 days to make properly with chilling to remove fat, etc.  But, tastes very good when done.

This is the second time I've made this recipe.  I roasted the bones, then covered with eight cups of water and allowed it to simmer for ten hours.  I didn't stir it and used a fine mesh skimmer to remove impurities and most of the fat.  Second time I used a packet of five spice and one cinnamon stick. My family loves this recipe and I offer a variety of garnishments; thinly sliced jalapeños, finely shredded carrots, matchstick cut cucumbers, thinly cut green onions, dry roasted peanuts, fresh cilantro, mint and basil leaves along with lime wedges, fish sauce and sriracha sauce.  The noodles are so delicate and compliment this delectable soup.

It was a little time consuming but well worth it. I not only par boiled the shank and oxtail I baked them for a little less than an hour, I think the baking gave much more flavor. Everyone loved it. I'll make this recipe again!

I cook the broth on a low simmer all day and over night. Creates a richer taste in my opinion.  Other than that this is a very authentic tasting recipe.

The recipe was spot on.  Roasting the  bones and onion were key flavor enhancers.  The amount of salt needed is easily double that the recipe requires, but be sure to sample as the broth is simmering.

Absolutely delicious.   Used beef neck bones and picked the tender morsels out and put back into the soup.  It's going to be difficult to enjoy Pho in any of my local go-to places now.  Only a few top this.

I added a stick of cinnamon and 3 tbsp soy sauce and reduced the salt. It is quite greasy so I refrigerated it and skimmed the fat off.

I think this recipe is great and tastes just like the Vietnamese restaurants I go to. I tweaked it just a tad for my own preferences to 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of fish sauce instead. It is in fact quite oily, but it's nothing a skimmer can't fix. I would totally make this again! Thank you!

Followed the recipe and it turned out pretty good for the first time. Lots of steps to put it together but well worth the effort.

I made this exactly as written and it was a bit bland. We had to go to the store and get a Pho spice mix to make this something we'd want to eat. And yes, the broth does get quite greasy so I do recommend skimming off the fat at the end.

People had mentioned about this being too greasy/oily, I drained about 3/4 of the fat from the beef bones off before putting it in the stock pot. 
This turned out amazing. This recipe is better than some of the Pho I've had overseas. 
I added a few more fresh herbs than the recipe which consisted of culantro, a little rosemary and garlic chives. I also put 4 cloves of crushed garlic to the stock while it was simmering.

I need help with this recipe. I've followed it to the t, and it's just coming out too oily. I also thought it wasn't hot enough
