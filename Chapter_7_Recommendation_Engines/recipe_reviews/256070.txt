I used roasted peanuts. After roasting I removed the thin covering around the peanuts, and soaked them overnight. Then I blended them with a date for sweetness and a pitch of salt. I changed the water before blending, wonder if this changes anything about the flavour. I used a very fine sieve to strain the milk. I added the milk to my morning coffee. It was creamy, the colour is rich, and the texture was almost similar to dairy milk. I'm likely to make it again.
