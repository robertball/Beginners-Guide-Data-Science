I tried this recipe with steel head trout and found it good. I was expecting stronger mediterranean flavors, but will try it again.

Excellent!  We had dinner guests who have traveled to many Mediteranian countries and said this dish was as good as any they had in Spain, Potugal or Italy. We used fresh caught Rainbow and Brown trout from northeast Iowa.

Wonderful fish dish. I used fresh herbs throughout as I had them on hand. Instead of salt and peper on the filets, I used lemon pepper. My fish was Wahoo. I used half butter and olive oil to saute the filets.  My husband really liked it. It is fresh and bright and reminded me of Italy. Will make again!
