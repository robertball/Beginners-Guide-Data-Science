I am 66 and have been eating this all of my life.. When I was a kid and was sick my Mom would grill a crunchy PB and mayo sandwich on plain ole white bread and serve it with a glass of icy cold milk. Today whenever I make one I want to put on my flannel jammies and wool socks so I can have this extreme comfort food.

I'll try anything with peanut butter because I love the stuff so much, but this just wasn't so good.  Don't get me wrong I love applesauce too but I think these two things are best off separate....

This is good, especially toasted. I kind of prefer apple butter (you can get it without sugar), but my kids liked this. They also liked having a little extra applesauce on the side to dunk the sandwich in. For those with wheat allergies, this translates well if you are using spelt bread--the spelt bread is able to withstand the extra moisture from the applesauce better than wheat bread.

I did not care for this sandwich. It tasted a bit too dry, so I ended up dipping the sandwich in more applesauce. The combination of these two ingredients in a sandwich just didn't suit my taste. I'm sorry I wasn't able to give this recipe a good review, but I am glad to see others enjoyed the sandwich.

This was good, but I prefer classic PB&J sandwiches.  After reading other reviews, I mixed the applesauce with the peanut butter ahead of time, then took the extra precaution of lightly toasting the bread to keep the applesauce from making the bread soggy.  After mixing with the peanut butter, it would've been fine on untoasted.  I used honey wheat, which is sturdier than your average white bread.  If you'd like a less sweet PB&J sandwich, this is definitely what you're looking for.  Glad I tried it!

I have not eaten this combination as a sandwich, but for years my husband and I have made toast with peanut butter and applesauce(that is cold from the refrigerator). Cinnamon applesauce, I might add! It is the best!

I've used both cinnamon and regular applesuace for these, but the cinnamon is better.  I wasn't sure if I would like this, but it's a new favorite now and makes a quick lunch.

Always a favorite in our family! We have used peanut butter and applesauce on sandwiches for years...as well as on pancakes and waffles.  Best toasted and thicker bread....and does help on toast to kinda mix pb and applesauce together so it doesn't run off...as it is slippery.  But so very yummy.

One of my favorites. I suggest using Dave's Killer bread, toasting your bread, use either natural peanut butter or almond butter and either homemade or organic cinnamon applesauce. This is both my kids' and my favorite. Great breakfast food to jumpstart your day.

I really loved this sandwich! It was really early in the morning, so I couldn't COOK anything, as I'd wake everyone. I was also craving something I couldn't place my finger on. When I came upon this recipe I had to try it! Though I used natural peanut butter, natural apple sauce, and whole grain bread. I loved it, it was exactly what I wanted! Especially since I don't like regular jelly with peanut butter. Definitely a sandwich I will be making in the future, it's a great tasting sandwich that can be good for you!

Try using apple butter - less runny - tastes great :-)

I found myself using applesauce with cinnamon on top as a dip for the sandwich. To get the correct applesauce to peanut butter ratio, the dipping was needed. Apple sauce sandwich au jous? This would be good for kids and it was a nice change from my typical peanut butter/banana, which usually fills me up a little too much. I used Ezekiel bread, which tends to stay very crunchy when toasted and prevented any sogginess from the apple sauce.

Wow! So simple and so good. Tried it on the kids (preschoolers) today and they loved it. We did spread a little honey on the bread first and mixed the PB and applesauce together to keep it from seeping into the bread. This will be on my list of quick and easy meals for the kids.

I did not care for this recipe...my son whose two favorite things are peanut butter sandwiches and applesauce...did not like it!! I made him a normal peanut butter & jellly sandwich instead, (spread with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and heated on griddle), he loved that.

I just gave this a try since I had all the ingredients on hand. I made it exactly as written, using Honey Wheat bread and plain (non-cinnamon) applesauce. It did taste pretty good, but I think I still prefer (berry) jelly with my peanut butter - decades of experience is hard to change! Thanks for the idea, though.

I made this for the kids for lunch.  And also used a suggestion from another review and they loved the idea of applesauce for dipping.  Instead of just spreading pb on one side then apple sauce on the other, I mixed it first.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon/sugar mix as well.  All in all it was a good light lunch.

This was an average sandwich.  The applesauce was runny so I didn't use too much.  I also sprinkled with cinnamon to add the the flavor.

This tasted good, but I probably would not make it again. Applesauce is a little too watery to be spread on bread, and it overpowered the peanut butter.

Tried a variation on this using about a tablespoon of applesauce mixed with about 1/2 tablespoon of raspberry jam. Also threw on a tablespoon of raisins. Was pretty tasty but would have been better grilled/toasted with some banana. The applesauce subsitute is a great idea though!

I really like peanut butter and honey together.  It's a honey-nut sandwich. :)  I also like this with a pat of salted butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  I know it sounds nuts, but it's really good, as well as it "loosens" up the peanut butter a bit and it makes it more "spread like"  or easier to eat.

This sandwhich was a nice alternative to PB&J. I toasted my bread and tried it plain with just the peanut butter and applesauce, and then tried it with banana slices on it, and it was much better with the banana. The crunchy toasted bread gives the sandwhich a nice texture with the PB and applesauce.

I like the applesauce with the peanut butter, but I prefer bananas sliced on the peanut butter, my Mom prefers raisins on her peanut butter sandwich and sometimes she puts bananas and raisins on it.
