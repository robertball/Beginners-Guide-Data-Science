I followed this recipe very closely, only didn't burn the butter and decreased sugar to 1/3 cup, and they turned out great!  I also livened up the yeast by letting it sit in the bowl with  the liquid and sugar for ten minutes before using it.  I took half of the dough ball and made four big dinner rolls which were pieces of heaven for me and my family. In the morning, I proofed the cinnamon rolls for 1.5 hours before baking (put a bowl of hot water in a closed oven with the cold covered rolls) which helped them rise. They tasted great also. Thanks for sharing your families recipe.
