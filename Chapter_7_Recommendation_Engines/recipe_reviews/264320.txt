My husband loves foodwishes.com and begged me to make this! It was easy, although I used the help of my kitchen aid to whip the cream... otherwise my arm would have fallen off. Light dessert, yummy!

Delicious, refreshing, easy & no cooking involved!  Made ahead, keep in freezer & pull out as we want.  Next time, I may reduce the amount of lemon zest or juice as it seemed to overshadow rather than highlight full strawberry flavor.  Thanks again Chef John!

Made to top off Fajita Night; it was a perfect light and sweet ending to a wonderful evening.

Exactly like it says on the tin: clean strawberry flavour with a lovely texture. I added some lemon juice to the syrup to give it some tang.
