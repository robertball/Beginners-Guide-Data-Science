This sandwich was dinner for the kids with homemade tomato soup. I followed the recipe closely, only scaling the recipe back to two sandwiches, I used whole wheat bread and I cooked the sandwiches in my cast iron skillet. I was a little concerned that the kids wouldn't like them but they both thought this was the best sandwich EVER. They both asked for seconds.

I thought the sourdough was a little tough for making a nicely melted sandwich.  My turkey was at room temperature when I  bit into it shortly after pulling it off the stove. My bread wasn't sliced thick either.   My husband complained about the mayo, too much,  and never even realized it had salsa in it.  So make sure you don't use a mild salsa.  I also think I will use good old American Cheese singles to make the sandwich gooier.    It has a ton of potential though, and I might consider trying it again.  The three stars are more that it was quite edible, but needs adjustment for MY family.

Excellent twist on a turkey sandwich! I made mine in the George Foreman grill and it was delicious.

Wonderfully spicy, I loved the flaovrs in this one. I used Miracle Whip and Old El Paso picante salsa, black peppered smoked turkey and some chili powder and freeze dried chives. This had wonderful flavor. The only difficulty was eating it as I used sandwich bread and the sauce made the turkey tend to want to slip out and not stay in place while trying to eat this. What a great sandwich! Thanks!

Exceptional!  Way more than just a dressed up grilled cheese!!  This has its own unique flavor and is just plain good!!  The sourdough bread really adds to this recipe.  I did not have salsa to put in the dressing so I subbed some chopped garlic and I used lite mayo.  The entire family LOVED these sandwiches.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Great quick after work dinner. The kids and husband even love it. I would recommend making sure the green onion is chopped very fine or it causes a weird texture issue. You will have leftovers so this is also great to put in the kids lunchboxes the next day.

This was SO GOOD! I loved the combination of flavors in this sandwich and it reminded me of sort of a Southwestern-style sandwich. The only changes I made were to use buffalo-style turkey breast and sliced Italian-style bread. This is a definate keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I really liked the mayo/green onion sauce.  Very good.  All I had was shredded pepperjack so that's what got used.  Nice sandwich!

Made this today for lunch, and my 13 year old son called it "Heaven on a plate".  This is a new family favorite for sure!  Probably the best sandwich I have ever made - thank you!

This sandwich is good, I didn't have pepperjack on-hand so I used a thin layer of shredded cheddar and it was really tasty. Its 4 stars because its good, not fantastic. A very nice twist on grill cheese.

This is a great twist on a turkey sandwich, and it doesn't take long at all! I used onion buns instead of sourdough bread, so to make up for its thickness, I grilled the inside of the buns first before spreading on the mayo mixture, and I grilled the deli turkey for a little bit too before putting it on the sandwich and grilling the whole thing. It was SUPER yummy. I'll make it more often because it's so fast! Maybe I'll have to use light mayo though... :)

LOVED the mayo sauce!  I was a little concerned about how the mix of mayo and salsa would taste but it was so good!  Perfect combo with the pepperjack cheese!  This is going to be my go to grilled cheese from here on out!

I made these sandwiches for by brother and I on the fly with whatever I had on hand and they were fabulous!  I used Pilsbury fresh French loaf bread, cooked and cooled, 1/4 of a white onion, chopped fine, mayo and salsa verde, turkey slices and Mexican shredded cheese.  We loved them and will make them again after Thanksgiving :-)

Surprisingly GREAT. My boyfriend and I both loved it. I did use white onion rather than green and also added a little too much sauce. When cooking only barely coat the bread with sauce and it will be plenty. Definitely making again!

Great sandwich for turkey leftovers. This was delicious. I didn't have sourdough bread so I used the leftover dinner rolls. Perfect !

Very good. I substituted two table spoons of Dijon mustard for mayo and added some red bell pepper. Heated up the turkey in the butter along side the bread. I put the cheese on the bread and the hot turkey on top. Then added the mixture and toasted both sides. Wife loved it!

Hice el sándwich de pavo y queso a la parrilla. Estaba delicioso. Usé pan italiano, queso suizo, pavo y pimientos picantes. El emparedado resultó dorado y el queso se derritió perfectamente. Muchas gracias por una excelente receta.

I was so hungry I didn’t melt the cheese all the way and I also used wheat bread, but I am immensely happy with how this turned out and I will be making it again! I’ll also probably use that spread in other recipes as well.

I was looking for a new twist on a turkey melt, and this recipe totally hit the mark!  The mayo/salsa mixture was outstanding!  I never would have thought to create a sauce with that combination, but it absolutely works!  Thanks for a great recipe :)

Good sandwich. Loved the pepperjack cheese and sourdough bread. Next time will make the mayo spicier. Well received here.

First time, I  followed the recipe to the T. My family loved it! Second time, I added a few drops of hot sauce to the mixture  for a little more kick. They loved it even more. They thought it was new recipe, lol!  My son added a few spinach leaves in his and I took a bite and like it-  great way to add some greens. It's a keeper!!

Absolutely fantastic sandwich.  I used Miracle Whip and added black pepper, onion powder, and a little Lawry's seasoned salt to the mix. Also used Ciabatta bread and shaved turkey instead of sliced. My wife and kids loved them!!

We had ham for Thanksgiving, so I thought I would try it with ham. Absolutely delicious! I made it just as the recipe suggested. My husband wants it again!

We didn't have green onions or pepper jack. Just used cheddar and added salt. Turned out great family approved even the kids. Dipped it in tomato soup and it was good.

So simple, and so good! I added thyme and garlic to the sauce and a thin layer of avocado in the middle. Mine was made with tofurky deli (vegetarian).

Way too much mayo, hot deli turkey not so tasty either.
Looked good on paper, but not so.
Much prefer simple grilled cheese....
Sorry!

Made these for dinner and based on the reviews I thought they'd be better. The mayo/salsa/green onion mixture was just okay. We won't make these again but they were nice for a change of pace.
