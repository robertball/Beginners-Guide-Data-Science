Came out quite nice, I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will put in more whole sprouted grain instead of chopping it all up.

This is a good recipe.  We in Ireland cannot get hard wheat grains easily, so I used our standard grain which was combined with strong wheat flour for the gluten. This made the best sprouted grain loaf to date. Very pleased.
