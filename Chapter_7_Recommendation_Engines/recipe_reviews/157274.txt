I like this recipe vs the traditional Margarita. I used 1/2 the confectioner's sugar  and no salt but that is just a personal choice.

Very good! I've never been a tequila fan and have only enjoyed margaritas when they are heavily flavored with raspberry or strawberry. These were so good though! You'd think they'd be too sweet, but it's just about perfect. The vanilla is veerrryyy subtle, but I wouldn't omit it. Thanks! :)

Scaled this to one serving and the confectioner sugar really makes the flavours pop!  Bold, daring and oh so refreshing w/ that subtle vanilla hint!

Oh YEAH!!! I was throwing a party so I doubled the recipe and added an extra tablespoon of confectioners sugar...SOOOO good!!! And using the limeade instead of the usual sour mix makes it delicious! This recipe will definitely replace my usual one for making Margaritas. Thank you!!

I made these over the weekend & they are delicious. Very similar to the way I have made margaritas in the past, but these are much better. That little bit of powdered sugar & vanilla makes all the difference. This is my new recipe for quick, delicious margaritas. Thanks for the recipe!

Very refreshing! I think next time I will use 3 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2.
