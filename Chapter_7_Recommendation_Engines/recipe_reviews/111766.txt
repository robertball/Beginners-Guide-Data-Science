Just a note to anyone making these cookies--> they're delicious, but if you use the entire recipe, you will probably end up with 50+ cookies, not 24! I cut the recipe in half because I was only planning on making a dozen or so with my family, and ended up with 30 large cookies! Just a note of warning...the recipe is delicious though, and definitely one of my favorites to use. I'd definitely recommend it to others.

These taste great! My mom has made these for a couple years now, she made her own recipe it's pretty cool. She's thinking of trying different candy bars next time too.

the dough tastes great raw, but the cookie was a little disappointing. i halved the recipe and used mini snickers, but i needed more than one bag of candy to use up the dough. i found it best to just roll the dough around the candy just so it was covered. too much dough meant most of the cookie was plain and snicker-less. i didnt make a crosshatch patter on the top either: it was too hard to make it look pretty with the hard snicker inside. the peanut butter cookie dough lacked peanut butter flavor and would be a pretty bland cookie alone. definitely needs some adjustments. i might try my favorite pb cookie recipe with the snickers inside next time, but this recipe was not one i'll be making again.

OK, this recipe really does make A LOT!  I cut it in half and we still had more than enough.  It's a good cookie, not the most fantastic, but darn nice!  The peanut butter flavor is not strong but that's OK.  I don't think I used a full 1/4 cup of dough for each cookie.  I just used enough to cover up the candy bar and called that good.  Make sure you use the sugar on top as it really makes the cookie!

These are delicious! I cooked them without the candy but they were still very yummy! I have a gas stove so I baked mine at 350 degrees and ten minutes only and they were perfect!

I liked very much the taste of these cookies.  I wish I could have a little of the Snickers bar with every bite of the cookie, however.  The dough was easy to work with, and I did cut back the size of the cookie quite a bit.  This does give me ideas about how to make these so I get that Snickers taste more often!  Thanks, Jamie!
