Great recipe!!  Skipped out on the nuts, used buttermilk instead of the sour milk.  ALso baked in 2 9x5 loaf pans.
Tip: Grease pan(s) with butter/ shortening and then dust with cinnimon and sugar.  Gives the crust a nice sweet flavor!!

great recipe. I mixed the chocolate chips and nuts into the batter with the zucchini also i am not a big fan of cloves so i only used about 1/4 tsp and I baked it in a bunt pan at 350 for 45 min. this is a very moist cake and the flavor is excellent not to sweet just right.

I cannot stop eating this.  I have it straight from the freezer at least once a day.  Did not have nuts, so I used all chocolate chips.  Used applesauce instead of oil and can't imagine it being more moist than it is.  I did add a rum glaze - 1 TBSP rum, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1-2 TBSP milk to desired consistency.

Mmmm, this is great!  I could hardly wait for it to finish baking before I had a piece.  Love the chocolate chips and walnuts on the top.  The only change I made was to substitute apple sauce for half of the butter and use a little less sugar.  Love it!  Great flavor and very moist.

You think you'll see it, taste it, smell it, feel it -- BUT YOU WON'T!!  The zucchini disappears - and a warm, moist, delicious chocolate cake is left!  Amazing!  I didn't have any cloves - loved it anyway! (used a LOT more chips and substituted pecans for walnuts).

My family adored this cake. I didn't have chocolate chips, nuts, or cloves in the house so I frosted with my own cream cheese frosting.  Teenage sons couldn't believe there was vegetables in it. It is a heavier bread-like cake but that is what I love.  The cinnamon adds a great touch, I also baked at 350 which is what I bake all my cakes at.  Excellent!!

this cake turned out really good although i made some changes to make it a bit healthier....didnt add any butter but added 3/4 cup applesauce in place of butter and only 1/4 cup oil.  only added 1/2 cup sugar, also added 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white, didnt add any cloves, added 2/3 cup of cocoa  powder instead of 4 tablespoons...this sweet enough for us!

I made this cake but substituted lean sour cream, added some chocolate chips to the batter and used pecans instead of walnuts.  It was awesome.  The freezer idea works very well.  Will definitely make again!

This is very good.  It is not an overly sweet cake which I like.  If you are going to sub applesauce, switch it for the butter and not the oil.  Liquid fats are better for u than solid fats.

i rarely give 5 stars, but this was really good--I followed the advice of other reviewers and mixed the nuts and chips in the batter, this cake rocks!  Super easy to whip up, nothing weird in it (other than zucchini) that you need to run out and get--

I was very pleased with this cake! The flavor was rich with the hit of cloves, and it was very moist, needing no embellishment besides the chocolate chips scattered over the top. I omitted the nuts, used buttermilk, used all egg whites for this, also a full tsp. cinnamon and baked it for about 36 minutes in my convection oven. It can be dressed up by sprinkling a little 10x sugar [confectioners' sugar] on top after it cools. I used coconut oil for the vegetable oil...with awesome results. Note that this cake does not rise much - it is more of a "snack-cake" height. Very good and recommended for families with kids.

Nice moist cake.  I added the chocolate chips to the batter, rather than as a topping.  I eliminated the nuts.  I will be making this again.  Our guests thoroughly enjoyed the cake.

I substituted plain yogurt for the sour milk, it worked great. One reviewer said you can use sour cream instead of sour milk, and I always use plain yogurt in place of sour cream and it works fantastically every time! Delicious!

This cake turned out really well. I used the same amount of sour cream instead of sour milk, and I used apple sauce instead of oil. It was nice and moist, and it kept well in the freezer.

Oh this was good!  I also used sour cream instead of sour milk. I put in some extra chocolate chips, cooked it a bit longer and topped it with a whipped cream cheese frosting.  Super moist and delicious.

Excellent!  Very moist and good chocolate flavor.  I used frozen zucchini that I pulsed in the food processor and it worked just fine.  I will make this again and again.

This is by far the best chocolate zucchini cake recipe I've tried! My garden produced a lot of zucchini this year, so I was looking for creative ways to please my kids...this recipe was it! I tried a number of recipes that weren't as moist as promised, and I knew this one would be good when I saw milk in the recipe - it truly made the difference! This was wonderfully moist and delicious! I did eliminate the butter and used olive oil only.

I was worried I overbaked this cake since the edges were quite a ways from the side of the pan when cooled, however this cake was SO moist and yummy! It reminded me of a cake-like version of zucchini brownies. Will definitely be making again!

Not too sweet, and the PERFECT texture.  If I make it again I think I'd add just a hint more cocoa as it was a little on the bland side, but the fantastic moist texture made up for that.

I substituted applesauce for oil.  Nutmeg for cloves.  Sour cream for sour milk.  Put 1/2 cup of choc chips in the batter and sprinkled 1/2 cup on top.  No walnuts.  Frosted w/Duncan Hines Milk Chocolate frosting.  AWESOME!!

I'd give this about 4.5 stars. It was lovely and moist, just the way you'd expect a zucchini bread or cake to be. The spice taste combined with the chocolate was a little odd, but in a good way. The only thing I might do differently next time is add more chocolate elements to this, so that the chocolate taste can hold its own against the spice. It's an unusual, refreshing recipe - thank you for sharing!

This cake was OK, but the spices were pretty strong.  I guess I'm more of a chocolate purist than I thought.  If you are in the mood for a spice cake, this one might do you well, but if you're looking for a good chocolate cake recipe, this is not your cake.

Moist and delicious. Four stars only because I used an extra tablespoon of cocoa (maybe will try even more next time), left out the cinnamon & cloves, and used applesauce instead of the oil. When he saw me mixing this up, my husband said "I'm not eating that." He tried it, loved it, and took some to work (where it was much enjoyed!)

What a great recipe when there's an overabundance of zucchini in the garden!  Like one other reviewer, I sprinkled chocolate chips and chopped walnuts on top of the cake before baking.  My family loved the cake once they got past the idea of having zucchini for dessert --- the cake freezes well, so though it makes a large cake you can cut it into smaller servings and enjoy later.  Loved it!!

I really loved this cake!!  The only problem I had was the amount of sugar, butter and oil!  I think you could probably get away with 1 1/4 cup of sugar and a 1/4 cup each of the butter and oil cause the zucchini makes it really moist on it's own.  To be fair though, it is CAKE and not "healthy bread"!!  All joking aside, it's super duper moist and I will for sure be making again!

This is a very moist cake!!  I love heavier and moist cakes and this fits the bill.  The only change I made was adding 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter and sprinkling with 1/2 cup chips on top along with 1/2 cup pecans.  My boys really enjoyed it.

This cake was very good and moist. I put cream cheese frosting on it and took it to a barbacue. Everyone that had some said it was good, but there was a dark chocolate cake with chocolate frosting that got eaten faster. But this is a good way to use up the zucchini and it all got eaten by us when we got home.

DELICIOUS!  People are shocked when I tell them it's zucchini  cake.  I do a couple things to alter it:
- use buttermilk instead of sour milk.
- increase the cocoa powder to 5 Tablespoons
- increase the chocolate chips to 1 to 1 1/2 cups!  (i know... i like it really chocolatey!)  I mix half the chips into the batter and the other half sprinkle on top.

So crazy moist and good!

This cake is delicious and healthy.  I did not use butter instead  I used 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, also cut the sugar amount into half.  It is my husband's favorite cake, standing along side with his mother's black forest cake.  Not bad at all!! :))

I've tried other recipes for chocolate zucchini cake and this is the best one I've found! So yummy when still a little warm and served with a big glass of cold milk! I followed the recipe just as written, except I didn't measure out the walnuts and the chocolate chips. I broke up the walnuts by hand instead of grinding because I like chunks of walnuts, and I just covered the top with what I thought looked good of both....and it was perfect!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!!

This is REALLY good.  So moist and not a trace of zucchini in it when you eat it.  You're sure fool the kids, or anyone who doesn't like their veggies, when you serve this cake.  I would add extra chips, though.  Needs more chocolate!

Loved it and so did everyone else!  Didn't have any chocolate chips, so I chopped up some chocolate squares.  Also, baked it in two 8-inch cake tins.  Ate one, froze the other.  Very easy!

I LOVED this recipe! I haven't had chocolate zucchini cake since I was little and now I've realized I like it even better than brownies: not too rich and perfect with vanilla ice cream. I didn't change a thing in the recipe.

I was not impressed!  The cloves are WAY too strong, and I really like cloves.  This was also extremely dense, I would not qualify this as a cake.

The best!  So moist!  I had to photocopy it for all of my friends.  I even served it to a class of students and the ate every bite (I didn't tell them about the zucchini!).  I don't use cloves though; I substitute nutmeg instead.

Maybe it was me, I had doubled this and in the beginning was almost too fluffy to eat.  On the second day, was better.  Kids did love it, although I think I would prefer the traditional zucchini bread.

This was so moist and yummy! I used buttermilk instead of sour milk and nutmeg instead of cloves as well and skipped the nuts. The only thing I would do differently next time is cut down on the cocoa powder to only 3 tablespoon. It was very fun and easy to bake.

Excellent! Easy way to use up some of the multitude of zucchini that I have on hand. Great that I didn't need any frosting. It was perfect as is. I think I'll make it again for a potluck this weekend.

Modified the recipe a bit. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup oat flour instead of 2 cups all-purpose; I used only 1/2 the fat and substituted the rest with mashed, over-ripe banana; and, instead of sour milk, I used plain, unsweetened yogurt. Also, I used only 1 cup of sugar, but I doubled the amount of chocolate chips :-) Tip: Although the recipe doesn't say, I squeezed some of the liquid out of the grated zucchini. I think that, otherwise, the cake would be way too moist and might not cook properly.

This is the exact same recipe that my grandmother gave to me that she has been using since I was a kid. Probably out of an old betty crocker cookbook or something.  I make it a lot and everyone always loves it! The only differences that I make is that I alternate putting in the dry ingredients and the sour milk (or buttermilk) so that I don't over mix anything. (Put in 1/3 of the dry and mix til just barely incorporated, then 1/2 of the buttermilk and continue to repeat this until the dry is gone). I also omit the cloves cuz I am not a fan. Sometimes I skip the chocolate chips on top and put on a chocolate cream cheese or buttercream frosting. I also am allergic to nuts, so none of those. Also, when my grandmother makes it, she puts on half chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips. It's delicious this way!

I think the sour milk gives these a bit of an "off" taste but they were still good.  Next time I'll try just regular milk to see if that makes a difference.  Made them as cupcakes and baked for 20 minutes. The sprinkled chocolate and walnuts on the tops makes a nice presentation.

Yum.  We made it for my mom's b-day.  She declared it her new favorite cake.  We substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil, sour cream instead of sour milk, and chopped walnuts instead of ground walnuts.

This was incredible!  I made a chocolate cream cheese frosting (but you don't need it)  and took it to work.  Didn't tell anyone what was in it and it was gone in 2 hours.  Then they couldn't believe zucchini was in it!

A great base recipe.  I did change it but we LOVED the changes: I peeled the zucchini, Increased cocoa to 6 tbsp, did not add the spices, increased the sugar to 2 cups.  Spread 1 cup of choc chips on top and then when cake was cool frosted with a white icing.  Perfect choc cake.

Almost identical to my mom's recipe which I have been craving for at least two years. Instead of sour milk I used sour cream and for the topping I mixed 1/4 c. brown sugar and the chocolate chips and sprinkled on top prior to baking. Fantastic! *I do think that the cloves are a little strong so I may cut the amount in half when I remake it tomorrow :)

I only had 2 cups of zucchini, but it was fine.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T, but my cake was done in 25 minutes.  I'm not sure exactly what happened, but it was definitely baked through & tasted good.

I veganized this by replacing milk with soymilk, butter with margarine, and eggs with flaxseed/water. I was out of walnuts so I increased the amount of choco chips and used only them on top. The cake turned out well. I felt like the cinnamon/cloves were the defining characteristic though, not the zucchini. My wife also like it so I guess you could say "omni tested, vegan approved!" Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake for a group of ladies and only had two small squares leftover. When women eat cake you know it must be good!

I decided to make this cake because I had some milk go sour on me. So glad I used it instead of tossing it! Not overly rich or too chocolately, the spices give the cake a very nice flavour. The zucchini makes this cake super moist. This cake lasted a week and was just as moist on the 7th day as the 1st. I left out the nuts and mixed the chocolate chips in the batter. My sister in law deemed them the best part. Enjoy!

Yummy cake.  Didn't really care for the cloves very much, and I even cut the cloves in half.  I also added a whole lot more chocolate chips, in the cake and on top.

We made this recipe as written, with the exception of tripling the chocolate chips and doubling the nuts.  It not only came out moist and delicious, it has a wonderful flavor that isn't sicky sweet like a lot of cakes out there.  Also - not sure if the last user forgot to add the sugar or what happened, but this cake does have some sugar in it.

I would really give this 3 1/2 stars.  I found myself eating the top layer because of the sweetness of the choco chips.  The cake was perfectly moist, dense, and the recipe was easy.  However, the cake had a strange, not-sweet flavor that I didn't really enjoy.  If I make this again, I think I'd add some sugar and then mix the choc chips into the batter at the end, instead of putting them on top.

This was an excellent cake!  I used buttermilk instead of sour milk and decreased the cloves to 1/4 teaspoon.  It serves well and everyone asked for the recipe!

I loved it! It was light, fluffy and moist! So yummy! I substituted buttermilk for sour milk and used a teaspoon of a Cinnamon Plus blend instead of 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cloves. I will make this again!

Tasty & delicious.  Made this in two loaf pans and took one to dinner with friends.  It was a true hit!  Loved the ground cloves and cinnamon.  Very autumnal flavor.  Looking forward to making this to give to friends for the holidays.  Mmm!  Mmm!  Good!

I used buttermilk and less cloves (personal preference).  Because it was a very hot day, I baked them as cupcakes at 350 to cut down on the baking time.  Everything worked out perfectly as they were moist and delicious.

good.  very easy.  I didn't add cinnamon.  I just wanted a chocolate tasting cake.  I also added more cocoa.  Just didn't feel that the given measurements would be enough.  Also I only put 1 cup of sugar as I felt that was more than enough.  Lastly, I had to use egg substitute (the powdered kind) as one of the people that will be eating it is allergic to eggs.  It turned out great.  I will be putting a caramel fudge icing on top which is also why it didn't need to be overly sweet.  Should be delicious.  The extra cocoa was a good decision if you want a chocolate taste.  But with the changes the cake was fluffy, moist and rose perfectly.  It took exactly the stated time to cook and I used a bundt pan.  Directions were good and it turned out great.

Loved this! Recipe as written is excellent as written. Just as a preference, I used plain low fat yogurt for the sour milk, applesauce instead of oil, reduced sugar to 1 cup, and folded walnuts and semi-sweet chocolate chips into the batter with zucchini. Made a small, but beautiful bundt. Dusted with powdered sugar and served as dessert! Plenty sweet and actually quite rich.

Excited for a homemade cake that is interesting and turned out despite adjustments for available ingredients in Europe - will try it again and replace some of the oil with applesauce.

What a moist, delicious cake! I subbed several ingredients--whole wheat flour for all-purpose, red palm fruit oil for butter and oil, plain yogurt for sour milk and nutmeg for cloves. I cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups (could probably cut back a bit more) and increased the vanilla to 2-3 tsp. I had about 3 cups of shredded zucchini and used it all with no problem. Maybe it's a bit "healthier" with those changes. This may be my "go-to" recipe for chocolate zucchini cake from now on.

I love this recipe!  I tweaked it a bit by adding a couple generous shakes of cayenne pepper and I mixed the walnuts and chocolate chips in the batter.  Very tasty indeed.  Will add a little instant coffee next time.  I also baked in loaf pans so I could freeze one for winter :)

Great cake.  Very moist.  I followed someone else's suggestion and used sour cream instead of sour milk.  I also used Bob Red Mill's gluten free baking flour.  I used dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  Topped it with a mocha icing.  Cut that recipe in half so it is a thin glaze.  It's perfect.

I increased the cinnamon to 3/4 - 1 tsp, and switched to 1/8 tsp each of ginger and nutmeg instead of cloves. I also added 1 square of melted unsweetened chocolate. I add the 1/4 cup choc chips to batter. I sprinkled another 1/2 Cup of chips to the top of cake along with the ground walnuts. Yumm!!

YUM!!  Very moist!  I subbed sour cream for sour milk, omitted cloves (personal preference), made it with both oil and apple sauce, and baked in various forms--9  X 13 cake pan, bread pans sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar, bundt cake.  No matter how you sliced it, this is a very tasty recipe that will become a regular at our house and in our freezer!!!

Thanks so much for this recipe. I have made it a few times now and I can't believe how quickly it disappears, so I made a triple recipe last time and shared some with a friend. She asked for the recipe. I do reduce the amount of sugar and ice the cake with cream cheese icing. So moist and delicious!

I love this cake and definitely would make it again. The zucchini makes the cake very moist without giving it an overpowering taste.  I tweaked the recipe a little bit.  I added 1/2 tsp espresso powder, 1 cup mini chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the batter.  Also, I substituted buttermilk for the sour milk.   I sprinkled the batter with coarse sugar. The course sugar gave it a nice crunchy sweet topping.   I found that the cake tasted even better the next day.  Delicious with a cup of coffee.

Fabulously moist!  I cooked an additional 5 minutes because the middle was still jiggly.  I frosted with peanut butter frosting and it's delicious.

This cake is delicious! So moist and not overly sweet. I increased the amount of chocolate chips to 1/2 cup, adding half to the batter and sprinkling the remainder on top of the cake. Also added 1/2 tsp baking powder to the dry ingredients. Fabulous recipe!

A good solid cake but lacked any wow factor for my family. Froze well and still a good solution for so many zucchinis growing in my garden.

Something went wrong. I think it may have been my fault but this cake was kind of gooey and dense. I cooked it an extra 40 minutes because it didn't seem to be cooked through. It had a pleasant taste though. I used apple sauce instead of oil, and may have compacted a little too much zucchini into 2 1/2 cups resulting in too much moisture.

Fabulous, delicious - no trace of healthy veggies here.  Top with a little whip cream.  Just lovely. I used frozen shredded zucchini, which I drained of liquid.  I added back two big tablespoonfuls of sour cream to compensate.

very tasty and moist, however it has a LOT of sugar. I know you can often substitute fruit puree for eggs/oil and would love to know if using the zucchini to replace these would work. If I'm going to put zucchini in a cake, I would love if it could be more healthy (as well as tasty)

This is wonderful.  I made it because I needed a dessert for a large group of adult students.  I got many compliments and several requests for the recipe.  I made it exactly as stated except I omitted nuts due to allergies in the group.  It is light, chocolaty with a delicious spice taste.  I would categorize it as "Grandma cake."  The kind of down home dessert you would expect to have at your grandma's house.

Very moist and delicious! No one would ever guess there was zucchini in the cake! The only change was to decrease the sugar a bit, which I generally tend to do with recipes. I didn't have sour milk so I used the milk and lemon juice solution as suggested.

Such a warm, moist flavor! Soooo good with German chocolate/Coconut pecan frosting on it - Not too sweet, but compliments the warm flavor really well. There's never any left over to freeze.

Very simple;  I've always likes chocolate chip zucchini cake, and this recipe was just as I remembered it.  Yummy moist cake.  I used normal skim milk, left off the nuts, only used 2c. zucchini, and mixed some chocolate chips both into the dough and sprinkled some on top.  Mmmmm....chocolate.

Delightful! Super moist. Only alterations I made were substituting applesauce for half the oil. I also used sour cream in place of the sour milk. I also only had 1 1/2 cup zucchini. Worked out great. I added a tad more cocoa, just about two tsps. Definitely would make again! Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe! It was the simplest recipe i found for this cake and it tastes delicious, very moist. I didn't use walnuts but I may try them next time. I have many large zucchinis from my garden and this a great and tasty way to use them.

Very good, moist cake.  Next time I will double the spices for a spicier cake.  We put the nuts on top with a toy dinosaur for our 4y/o's birthday cake.  A very big hit!
