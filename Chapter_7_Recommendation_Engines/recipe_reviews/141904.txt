This was my first Mango! Excellent! I followed the directions, because I didn't know what I was doing:). I used a large jalapeno, I thought the salsa was hot, my husband thought it had a nice bite [to each his own]. Will diffently be making this again. Tasted great with grilled chicken. Thanks.

Very, very good.  We used it on grilled tilapia wrapped in corn tortillas.  Delicious.  I would consider adding an extra jalapeno next time for just a little more heat.

Cooked this up as a topping for pork chops - very tastey! I used a food processor to finely chop the onion and jalepeno. Not very hot - could probably leave the seeds in to get a bit of bite.

I loved this with white fish! I kicked it up a notch with Sriracha sauce and the mixture of hot and fruit really brought out the flavor of the fish.

This has become a staple in our house in the Philippines, where the local mangoes make it even better.  I use fresh pineapple instead of canned, and triple the garlic and double the chili peppers (I use local chilis instead of jalapenos).  Makes an amazing topping for pork chops, grilled chicken or even just over rice.  You can leave out the butter if you have a dairy sensitivity or want to make it vegan, and it doesn't miss anything at all in the flavor.

I used Serrano’s instead of jalapeños and it was spicy!! Too hot for my husband. Next time I think I will take out some of the seeds first. I used fresh pineapple instead of canned.

This is fantastic! I didn't have any cardamom so i used twice the amount of cumin and it was absolutely perfect! We ate it with grilled ham steaks but we can't wait to try it on jerk chicken, pork tenderloin, and fish tacos!
