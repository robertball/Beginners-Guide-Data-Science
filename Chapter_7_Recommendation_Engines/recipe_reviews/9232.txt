Please be careful about using a "clean" carpenter's nail.   It might be squeakly clean, but still coated with something that was never intended to go into your food!   Specialty stores offer a tool that holds 4 potatoes upright, impaling them each with a food grade aluminum spike.   Otherwise, forget about using a nail, and cook longer.

I use sour cream in lieu of the milk, add shredded cheddar to the potato mixture along with onion, green pepper, real bacon bits and I season with garlic powder and a little black pepper. Fattening, but soooo yummy!

I made these for Easter, but modified the ingredients.  After scooping  out the potato pulp, I added sour cream and fresh chives.  Then I topped them with parmesan cheese.  I let them cool, covered them, and refrigerated them overnight.  After I pulled the ham out of the oven, I popped these in and everything was ready at the same time.  A great make-ahead dish that results in a rather elegant and crowd-pleasing holiday dish.

This is my husbands favorite recipe. I've been making it for years. I add either sour cream or cream cheese to the mixture. It is sooo good that way. Also, I put chives on top of the cheese of a few for my husband and myself (the kids don't like chives). Also, for a family of 5, I have to make about 6 whole potatoes, which gives me 12 halfs. They go really fast.

substitute heavy cream for the liquid, mix in about a cup of the shredded cheese with the potatoe mixture and add a little celery salt in the mix too! also when you scoop out the potatoe, put a dish towel in your hand and you can hold the potatoe better, saving it from breaking.

My kids and husband loved this recipe.  I made a couple of minor changes to the original recipe.  I decreased milk by 1/2 cup and added 1/4 sour cream and mixed shredded cheese into the mashed potato mixture as well as some bacon bits.  Filled each potato skin with the mixture and topped it off with some more shredded cheese on top of each potato.  My kids are very picky eaters and they both asked if we could have these again!

This recipe was fantastic, especially as I added 1/2 cup of finely minced red bell pepper & 1/4 cup sauteed onion, a clove of garlic plus a few tablespoons of minced chives.  Instead of butter and milk, I added a couple of tablespoons of light sour cream, and put half of the cheese in the mashed mixture.  This is going to be a regular item at my house.

I really liked this recipe simply because it was easy. I did add some garlic powder and used Colby Jack cheese. I also cut the tops off instead of cutting them in half. Just a preference but in my opinion, I think it's better this way.

Overall, good recipe and I will make it again!

This recipe is good just the way it is.  People need to remember to at least try it the way it was intended before making major changes.  I think only after that you should bend the rules.

While these are a little bit of work, they are very easy and taste wonderful!  I could hardly believe it when my picky kids ate every last bite!  I added some cream cheese to the mixture and it gave it a creamier, richer texture and flavor.

I make these all the time with various alterations to accompany the main dish the best.    I start with this basic recipe but consider mashing the cheese INTO the potato as well as on top. You will have that flavor baked in throughout the potatoe.  Also, consider changing cheese.  Cheddar is always good, but change it up. I like to use Monterey Jack, and sometimes combine both.   Alternatives, as in mashed potatoes are cream cheese or sour cream.  I like both and alter to whatever I have on hand, and sometimes light cream.      Garlic powder is a nice alternative. And of course, bacon bits and/or chives. Lastly, I always sprinkle Paprika on top before I bake. YUM.   Note: baked potatoes do take a long time, you can cut it by nuking your patatoes for a few mins before baking. NOT TOO LONG! A couple minutes is all you need. I always do this. They come out fantastic and the potato texture isn't sacrificed.

Great recipe!  I use microwave potatoes to cut down on time and add cheese and garlic.  I sprinkle paprika on the top before baking.

I love this recipe.  I usually add in green onions, bacon bits, french fried onions or any other spice that I have in my fridge to give it a twist.  I don't have a problem with the time because I just put the rinsed potatoes in a plastic bag with a few tablespoons of water and microwave them until they are soft enough to scoop the center out.  After I stuff them I put them into the oven.  I also brush extra virgin olive oil on the skin of the potato to keep it from sticking and for extra crispiness.

EXCELLENT!  This is just like what you get at a fancy restaurant.  It was so easy to make.  I did, however, skip the cheese and add fresh chives.   I prepared these potatoes ahead of time and popped them in the oven for the second bake, 15 minutes before we were ready to eat.  Thank you Sally Oh for such an EXCELLENT recipe!

I added broccoli and cubed Velveeta cheese and microwaved the potatoes instead of baking. We topped with shredded cheddar cheese and ranch dressing. They were delicious!

The potatoes came out great.  Baked the large potatoes for 1 hour exactly and it was easy to scope out the pulb and mash.  I also broiled a min or two after the cheese melted and that really gave the potatoes a nice look.

This is the way my mom made them too. I think adding cream cheese would make them SO much better, I am going to try that next time!!

I loved this and so did my hubby who doesn't even care for potatoes. I did my own measurements on the milk and butter, but I followed everything else exactly and I think this is an easy and delicious baked potato. Oh and I also mashed the potatoes with some butter after taking it out of the oven for the first hour and put in the microwave for ten min to speed up the process. I then added the rest of the butter, milk, and salt. Great baked potato.

Not bad!  I'm not a huge potato fan, but I really like cheese so I thought I'd give it a go.  Honestly, not cheesy enough for me... but that's a personal preference.  I didn't have much milk so I used cottage cheese instead, gave it a great texture.

I made these last night to go with a pork roast. They were delicious. I'd give this a 5+ if I could. The only change I made was, I added bacon bits to the top with the cheese. This is a simple but delicious recipe for twice baked potatoes.

These potatoes were delicious.  I used my electric mixer to mash them and also baked an extra potato and discarded the outer shell so the filling would mound up a bit.  The kids and adults all loved them.

mmmmm, very tasty & great comfort food! i used sharp cheddar, sauteed about 1/4 c. chopped onion with some of the butter & stirred it into the mashed potatoes. this dish went well with our walleye (skin the fish, dip in beaten egg then dredge in belgium waffle mix. fry walleye in 1" heated canola oil until golden, turning once) for valentine's day. thanks sally!

I was somewhat disappointed.  Most of the twice-baked potatoes I've had were better.  As is, the recipe turned out too dry.  I did use 2% cheddar cheese and that may have made a bit of a difference.  Next time, I will modify this recipe a lot - looking for a way to make the mashed potato portion tastier and less dry.  I prefer to avoid the extra calories and fat of cream cheese, but as others have suggested, I may try that.  I may also add sour cream and/or cream instead of milk.  Mixing bacon bits and cheddar cheese with the potato pulp may spice the taste up and add to the moisture content too.  I will also be looking to add spices to the pulp too, as others have suggested.  As is, this is a very average or below average recipe - but with modifications, it might be terrific.

I was somewhat disappointed.  Most of the twice-baked potatoes I've had were better.  As is, the recipe turned out too dry.  I did use 2% cheddar cheese and that may have made a bit of a difference.  Next time, I will modify this recipe a lot - looking for a way to make the mashed potato portion tastier and less dry.  I prefer to avoid the extra calories and fat of cream cheese, but as others have suggested, I may try that.  I may also add sour cream and/or cream instead of milk.  Mixing bacon bits and cheddar cheese with the potato pulp may spice the taste up and add to the moisture content too.  I will also be looking to add spices to the pulp too, as others have suggested.  As is, this is a very average or below average recipe - but with modifications, it might be terrific.

This is a excellent recipe!  I would recommend using medium sized potatoes unless you are a pro football player or sumo wrestler.  Also sprinkle the cheese on top just a couple of minutes before removing potatoes from oven to prevent melted cheese gooing up your oven.

I've tried many recipes that didn't turn out the way I thought it should. This one is so basic anyone can do it. I like it because you can change it up to the way you want it. I've added broccoli and cheese, mushrooms, and bacon.

Loved this recipe!  Made them for dinner and my husband loved them too!  Skipped the butter, used skim milk and also added a tbsp of light sour cream.  When they were almost done, sprinkled with some shredded cheese!

I cut out the milk and substituted sour cream, and used about 4 oz habanero jack cheese in place of the cheddar. Also added some green onion. Mixed all the "pulp" and ingredients together until relatively smooth and threw in the oven like directed. Lots of flavor! My boyfriend couldn't stop eating them :)

It was great! I was actually in a hurry and did the potatoes in the microwave for 7 minutes instead of an hour in the oven, then I stuffed them and transferred them to the oven for 15 minutes.

These were good and simple.  I started them off in the microwave and did the second bake in the oven. (too hot to run oven all that time).  I'll doctor them up more next time.

I made these using leftover baked potatoes.  They were cold, so I scooped out the inside, mashed them and added 2 T butter, 2 T sour cream and one T chopped chives, and microwaved that for about a minute until warm.  I then stirred in about 1 C shredded cheddar, filled the potato shells and sprinkled the top with Lawry's seasoned salt  Baked for about 10 min until browned.  Yummy!

Not bad, I did tweak this however, I added a few dashes of garlic powder, some cheese in the potato mix and like the other person did the initial cooking in the microwave.  Not as good as my mothers but not bad at all!

These were great!  I used sour cream instead of milk also.  I microwaved the potatoes to save on time, so they were a little dry.  I'll add a little milk next time in addition to the sour cream.  Really yummy, my very picky toddlers liked them, too!

The beauty of this recipe is that it is lower in calories, but still flavorful. The absence of sour cream and cream cheese is just what I was looking for. I will confess that I added some bacon bits and minced onion. I baked the potatoes the first time in the morning and finished them off just before dinner.

I don't know what was up, but the potatoes took forever to cook, 2 hours and 15 minutes and they still weren't done all the way.  I should have wrapped them in foil.  But other than that, I had to use sour cream instead of milk, since I was out, but it was very good.  My very picky daughter liked them a lot, and it was great for her diet.  I will make them again and even she said, 'next time, try with milk'.

Totally had the wrong sized potatoes.  Half the size of what is called for.  Made some minor adjustments but they came out really good.  Oiled and salted the skins.   Omitted the sour cream and just milk and butter.   Dashes is really S&P with a bit of garlic powder and seasoned salt.   Hubby absolutely loved it.  I want bacon next time for mine.  May wrap the taters in bacon for the first bake.  Hmmmm

Omitted the sour cream and just milk and butter.   Dashes is really S&P with a bit of garlic powder and seasoned salt.   Hubby absolutely loved it.  I want bacon next time for mine.  May wrap the taters in bacon for the first bake.  Hmmmm

This recipe was a good starting point.  After reading a few reviews, I tweaked it.  I added sharp cheddar cheese.  Some garlic and sour cream.  It really turned out well.  I will make again.

Would give 0 stars if possible. Mine are MUCH better. These have no flavor whatsoever and are very bland. In my recipe, I use green onions, bacon bits, cheese, and traditional onions. I would not reccomend this to anyone. I tried this one mainly for laughs and to see just how bland it is... my family hated this recipe as much as I did. Try my recipe next time! This one's definitely not a keeper.

Perfect canvas to tweak with toppings.  I added sour cream, turkey bacon bits and sliced chives. I also cut the potato in half and made "boats".  Or potato skins =)

yum yum good stuff! And also you can give it a bit of a run with your beaters to make it extra creamy and pipe it trough a pastry bag to make it really pretty!

I am lucky and have a microwave that has a baked potato setting! The potatoes took all of 10 minutes to cook. I used a couple tablespoons of sour cream and they went fast! The kids loved them and so did the grown-ups! Will be making these again!

What a pain in the butt to make these potatoes.  It took atleast an extra 45 minutes to an hour to bake them thoroughly and they still didn't come out the way I'd hope.

Be sure to bake these covered.  I did mine uncovered and they were a little dry.  Recipe needs a little more salt.  Before baking, I sprinkled tops with fresh bacon bits.  After baking, I topped with a little light sour cream.

Slightly bland - would add bacon as long as we're not calorie consious with this one. Lots of cheddar so I put some in the mix - maybe I'll use sharp and put more in mix next time

These were yummy, although I forgot to add milk. I did add some ranch dressing mix, which would have been great if I had added the milk! LOL!  I did have trouble scooping out the potato without tearing the skins to pieces. Still tasted pretty good. I'll have to try this recipe again and see if I can get it right.

I added sour cream and put the cheese into the potato mixture before I stuffed them.  Very good recipe.  Thanks.

I added green onions and crumpled bacon to the filling, and replaced the milk with sour cream. These came out very good and my dinner guests were very impressed. I will definitely make these again!

These were very bland, too time consuming and the results are not that great. Won't be doing them again...at least not this way.

Good but plain. I added some sour cream, chopped green onions, dried roasted garlic and bacon bits-livened up considerably.

I have always wanted a twice baked potatoe that had things in it that I like...this is it. I did make mine with a small amount of heavy cream  and used chedder and mozerella cheese for the top. Whole family loved it. Hardest part of whole thing is getting the potato out of the shell without breaking the shell!

Yummy!  I don't use bacon, but I use chives on the top after it is done cooking.  I also sprinkle some garlic salt and parmesan cheese before mixing and on the top.  You HAVE to try this....

These were pretty good.  I used sourcream instead of the milk, but think that next time I'll add the milk as well.  They were a bit dry, but we put a big dollop of sour cream on top and that helped a lot.  My kids LOVED these, as I used smaller potatoes to make theirs and they could actually pick them up with their hands and eat them.  We will definately make these again!
