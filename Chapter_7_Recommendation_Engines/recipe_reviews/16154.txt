I made this cheesecake for my husband for Valentine's day.  I asked him how many stars to give and he said 3.  I did add a cookie crust.  The cake was okay, but I was disapointed.  You could tell there was a coffee taste to it (and I doubled the liquior) but we couldn't taste the chocolate at all.  And I expected it to be really pretty, light brown with chocolate swirls, but it was instead a light brown with a darker brown bottom.  My husband ate it, but said it wasn't my best.  Thanks anyway though.

This is a great recipe!  I thought that 2 tablespoons of Kahlua would not do much for the flavor - it didn't seem like enough.  But, I was wrong!  It adds just enough flavor so that you can taste it, but it's not overwhelming.  My only question with this recipe is that there was nothing said about a crust.  I used a store-bought chocolate oreo crust anyway and it was a perfect compliment.   I also used 16 oz of cream cheese (2 whole packages) because I thought "HEY the more cream cheese the better!".  But it made too much batter and wouldn't all fit into the crust.  Next time, I will just use the 12 oz.  Overall, a really great-tasting cheesecake!

This was a great recipe - the Coffee Liqueur adds just a subtle flavor which is fine with me. My husband looked up and sheepishly asked, "This doesn't count as cheating on you, does it?" 5++++ stars from him. The only change I would make is to totally mix the chocolate into the rest of the cake before baking - I ended up with lumps of chocolate in spots and the marbling effect isn't a draw for us. I loved that it had no crust and just made it in a souffle' pan as I don't have a Springform pan anyhow.

I added two tablespoons of instant coffee and used amaretto instead of kahlua.  I also used 2 liquid eggs and one egg white.  At the last minute I threw 5 crumbled darkchocolate peppermint patties in the mixture and sprinkled real costa rican ground coffee all over the top.    Served it with Hagan Daz coffee icecream and whipped cream...   very very good with a kick
