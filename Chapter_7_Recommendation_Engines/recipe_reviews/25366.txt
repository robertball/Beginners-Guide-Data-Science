This recipe made a very sticky dough that was the consistency of most drop cookies. Even after sitting in the freezer for over an hour there was no way to roll it out. The cookies taste rather bland and flat.

Good little recipe. Trefoils aren't my favorite but this is a nice recipe to have. If the dough is too sticky for you just make sure you are working with a floured pin and surface.

I omitted the milk due to comments about it being too sticky. Doubt if it affected the flavor. I'm guessing flour was denser/less refined in those days and the extra moisture was needed then. I refrigerated the dough in small portions then refrigerated the cutout cookies on the sheet before baking. Worked fine. I thought the flavor was good. Sweeter than most sugar cookie recipes I've tried.

Cookies tasted good but the first line says add cream to butter and sugar. There is no cream in the ingredient list.

As a Girl Scout Leader we created a Sweet Shoppe workshop for over 25 Girl Scouts. This was so much fun and the girls were able to experiance Girl Scout History. They loved them.

This recipe does create sticky dough. What helps is to refridgerate the dough and then roll it out with flouring the roller and the dough continually. Carefully cut out each tremoil and use a strong stiff pie server to place each cookie on the cookie sheet. I also baked them for 11 minutes in my oven. Then they look perfect. This is a recipe 90 yrs old so I think of how they were originally made in a wood stove oven. Girl Scouts take on any challenge and over come them. I did.

This recipe was a disaster I don't even want to show a photo of how flat and run-together these cookies look. I wanted to be true to the recipe but as nataliemac said it was too sticky. I rolled them up in plastic wrap and froze for a couple hours but still sticky. If I had followed my instincts I would have added a 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/2 cup more flour. They broke into a million pieces when I tried to scrape them off the cookie pan. Taste is okay needs salt. islandteal typo in recipe means cream the butter and sugar together (mix until creamy).
