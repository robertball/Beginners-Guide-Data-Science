We had this with sliced Honey White Loaves and Chunky Applesauce, both from this site, and it was a very good "comfort food" dinner--the potatoes are delicious. I subbed mushroom soup for the potato soup, onion powder instead of onions (too lazy to chop), half-and-half for the milk, only used 1/8 tsp salt, added 2 Tablespoons bacon bits and about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese--and I mixed the cheddar cheese in with the entire mixture with none added to the top. I couldn't taste the dill weed so will add more next time. I like this recipe because it doesn't call for a half stick of butter! Very good; I will definitely make this again.

OH MY GOSH!!!! This was sooo good.  I couldn't stop eating it and my husband is normally very picky about what he likes and he LOVED this recipe.  It was so easy and cheap as well which I always look for when I make something new.  The only thing I might try next time which my husband recommended is to grilled the onions before I put them in the dish.

This was pretty good. I agree weith the previous reviewer that you can't taste the dill so either up the amount or leave it out. I would also put 1 1/2 c. cheese into the mixture and leave the last 1/2 c. for the last 20 minutes of baking. It also did not take 1 1/2 hours to bake. One hour is plenty.

I took two batches of this to a church picnic/potluck and when I went back to get seconds it was GONE!  I did make a few changes though.  I used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup instead of celery and potato soup, and I also used about 4 cloves of garlic, and a little more cheese.  I didn't use the dill weed since I didn't have any, but it wasn't lacking in taste.  Delicious.

I am going to start by saying the only reason this recipe recieved 1 star from me was because it was easy to make. It tasted like celery and potato soup straight from the can with 1/8 of a teaspoon of dill-that you can't taste anyway!! If you want a truly awesome potato dish try making the Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake.

I have been using this for 2 years and everyone loves it! I don't eat onion so I add onion powder, and I also add cheese at the end of cooking.
Also adding real bacon bits is great!!

This was so good!  I wasn't sure which kind of potatoes to use, so I opted to use 2 bags of the OreIda original roasted potatoes, I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of celery soup. I also increased the milk to  soupcan ful, and added 1/2 lb of shaved ham.  This was so good even reheated as it males a large pan!  Will definitely make this again.  Easy and a real "comfort food"

This recipe is great! I make it every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas as it is always requested by family.The only thing I do different is add 1 to 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese into the potatoes as I like mine really cheesy and the sharp cheddar gives it a little tang.

I used fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheese. I felt like there was too much sour cream, and maybe not enough of the spices. This has potential to be amazing, but I'll try tweaking it a bit next time.

I served these potatoes at a Halloween party. I called them funeral potatoes, since that is what a friend called the same type of casserole she brought to my dads funeral...and the name was appropriat for my party. They were very good, but I felt 2 cans of processed soup was unnecessary. I used one and added more milk and extra seasoning. I also eliminated the dill and added chives.

I needed potatoes for a Christmas potluck a few years back and have been making it by request ever since. Use the dill, it makes a difference, and I use the soups in the recipe too. I blend in most of the cheese and top with some at the end of cooking to avoid crusting.

I use cream of mushroom and cream of chicken.  We call these ice cream potatoes because we'd rather eat these than ice cream!  They are super easy to make (but don't tell anyone!)

Fabulous.  I did omit the paprika and I mixed all the cheese into the potato mixture.  I was afraid the cheese would get hard on top.  It turned out fantastic and I'll definitely make this one again.

Great recipe!  My husband loved it.  The only thing we would have done differently is next time we will saute the onions first to soften them up a bit.

Yum! I'm a big fan of potato casseroles - and this recipe definitely didn't disappoint! I used a little less sour cream (probably 12oz.), mixed half of the cheese into the potatoes and added the other half for the last 10 minutes of baking. And I completely forgot about the parika (doubt it mattered). Leftovers are delicious for breakfast too!

I followed this recipe as written. The cream of celery soup over powered the dish. None of the 7 dinned guest like this recipe. I will not be making this one again without some modifications.

The only thing that didn't work out with this recipe was that it was more sauce than potatoes (so to speak; it's not exactly a saucy dish).  I'm going to try twice as many potatoes next time and see what happens.

I make this recipe with a few modifications. 1st, I do not use paprika or dill weed. I also use 2 cans cream of celery, rather than cream of potato soup. And I add a package of Eckrich polish kielbasa, cut into bite-sized pieces. About 5 minutes before it's done, I top with french fried onions to brown.

It was really good and quick but next time I will change a few things. Like less sour cream, and the onions were still crunchy.

We liked this, I did cut back a little on the sour cream and added a little more dill.  Everyone loved and we had no leftovers.

These were fantastic!  The only thing I changed was I use O'Brien potatoes instead of regular hash browns.  Everyone loved them!  Thanks!

This got absolutely rave reviews from my family when I served it at a picnic--everyone wanted the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was add the cheese during the last 20 minutes of baking.

This really is a crowd pleaser.  Creamy, cheesy potato casserole. How can you go wrong? People love it.  I always make a double recipe.  And yes you can mix up the soup from cream of chicken to cream of mushroom.  Whatever you prefer. Try it you'll like it?!

There are about 100 different variations on the hashbrown casserole. This one was OK but certainly nothing special. I followed directions exactly (I used my gluten free cream of something soup substitute) and had to take it out of the oven at one hour. The cheese topping was extremely dark. Most guests just scraped the burned cheese topping off and enjoyed the creamy potatoes. It's a good base, but next time I'll mix all the cheese in with the remaining ingredients and probably only cook it for one hour.

Very good.  I would have rated it 5 stars if it some bites hadn't tasted quite so much like soup.  I will try it next time with only 1 can of condensed soup and a bit more milk instead.  I used light sour cream, and 2% milk and cheese...did not disappoint in creamy richness.

Awesome!  Although probably doesn't need as long in the oven - could be my oven, though.  I will be making it again exactly as written (save about 1/3 of the cooking time).

I made only a half batch, last time I made a lot of something off here it didn't work out. This was good. I shredded my own potatoes instead of using frozen, but it according to other reviews this doesn't sound necessary. I had no dill weed on hand so omitted it I added cut up polish sausage. I plan on making this again for Christmas dinner. I think I would like to try the dill weed, I think having the extra flavor in it would be a bonus, but is fine without it.

These were wonderful.  Used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I was surprised how good the hash browns turned out.  Have made several other dishes with frozen potatoes!  Great!

Wifey found it too rich, my 19 y.o. son doesn't like potatos.  So it was up to me to rate this delicious dish.  Very creamy.  The cheese topping really made the dish super.
