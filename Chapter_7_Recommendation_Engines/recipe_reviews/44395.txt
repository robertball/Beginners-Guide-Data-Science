We couldn't drink just one.  Between the four of us we drank 3/4 of ONE drink.  This was a waste of a perfectly good beer.

Hi! 
This is a very interesting recipe, I am from Mexico City, and the Michelada I know is made with Maggi sauce (Jugo Maggi), hot sauce or chili powder (chile piquin), lemons and salt. It is also better if you use a very cold beer instead of ice, this way the taste of beer is stronger.

not really a michilada, and not really that good.  sorry, but without any tomato-based beverage it's just a waste of beer.

I lived in Miami for years and this is the only way I drink my beer.  When I'm out at the bar-I simply have the rim the glass with salt, ice, beer and two fresh lime slices on the side.  A great and refreshing way to drink beer-and the beer lasts longer.

When I was in Mexico they had the lime already frozen in the glass, then the ice cubes don't water down your beer.

As someone who drinks Micheladas alot, I thought I'd try this version.  Not bad.  But in the future stick to the basics.  Tecate Beer, Spicy Clamato, lime and salt.  Then add chili to taste.

I really love beer and adventure, but I must have messed it up. 
I am going to have one by someone who knows how to make them. I may try the tomato based addition as someone else mentioned was needed.
I am bummed as I had been planning on making it for about 6 months.
