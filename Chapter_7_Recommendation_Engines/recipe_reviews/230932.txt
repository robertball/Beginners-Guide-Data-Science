I made this for a Father's Day barbeque and it was a huge hit! I served it with home made caramel sauce (also from this website) and whipped cream.

Moist and delicious! I'm not a huge fan of flan, but with the chocolate cake, this was an amazing dessert!

I thought the recipe was easy and great. It wasn't too sweet which was nice. However, I didn't love that it was more chocolate cake than flan. I would recommend if you want an even amount of both to put half and half of each mix.  For my first time I was pleased. The camera came out in between which a nice touch. 
Personally, I still need to find a more authentic flavor one but I really appreciate this 1 recipe here!! If it's your first time you definitely should give it a try. 
Thanks for sharing! :)

I have to say, even though this is a very rich, satisfying dessert, it is SO EASY to make! I made it with a milk chocolate cake mix, and used a dulce de leche Mexican caramel sauce.

Made this today for the perfect end to our Super Bowl party! Never made Flan before, not sure what to expect. The Flan part of this dessert is Cheese Flan, not Vanilla Flan. Consistency was between Flan and Cheesecake, but we like it that way. Flavor was awesome, used Devil's Food cake and it was super moist and yummy! Follow recipe exactly!

I used a 15.25 ounces devil's food cake mix because that's what I have on hand and reduced the sour cream accordingly (about 100 ml).
I replaced the cajeta with Smucker's brand salted caramel (cajeta was unavailable at the store) and reduced it to 1/3 cup. I also reduced the sugar in the flan by 2 Tbsp. 
Everything came out terrific and the sweetness is just right for us. This recipe is a keeper.

This is my new “ go to” dessert for company, parties, or special occasions! So darn yummy and fun to make. I’m amazed every time. It gets rave reviews. I also serve it with unsweetened toasted coconut for a real treat.

I made the Chocoflan and I did have to make some changes, instead of using the evaporated milk I used condensed milk and did not add the sugar. It was delicious.

This was AH-MAZING!  It is a little off putting when you make it for the first time, I had no idea how it was going to turn out.  But after it was chilled and I flipped it over, heaven!!!

REALLY sweet and very creamy. I love it but it's probably not good to have more than once a week, though I would have this everydayy!
