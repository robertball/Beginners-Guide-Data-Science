I tried this recipe, it was ok but not spectacular. The cream of asparagus did not really give the chicken flavor, but the parmesan cheese gave it flavor. It is very important to make sure the chicken is done. Dont let the pan heat to much before you add the chicken because it will cause the chicken to burn easily.

Okay, so I could never make this recipe exactly because the local grocery store I shop at does not carry cream of asparius, however I substituted with cream of broccoli and it is fabulous. I would recommend 2 cans of soup to make more of it. And I used more cheese than required to make a broccoli and cheese soup mixture, my family loves this meal.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The chicken tasted good with the bread crumbs, but the cream sauce didn't have a very appetizing flavor.

The first time I made this, I thought that the asparagus sauce was a bit bland so I added some dry Parmesan cheese to the sauce directly and a few cubes of Havarti cheese. Doing this gives the sauce so much more flavor and really adds to the chicken. I paired it with minute rice only I added cream of mushroom soup to the rice to give it flavor as well (I will do 1 1/2 cups water, 2 cups rice, and 3/4 cup soup). It's a big hit with my boyfriend and my parents.

I live with the hands down pickiest Italian husband ever who has been criticizing my cooking since we met, comparing everything to his mother... He devoured this recipe, had 3rds, along with my two picky kids, 8 and 5. My 8-yr old daughter could not get enough of it. I was dumbfounded. I added some white wine to the soup/sauce, as well as capers and served it over basmati rice that was cooked with fresh dill, fresh cilantro and cream of potato soup. It's been 2 hrs since dinner and they are still raving about it. I skipped the egg, just rinsed the chicken and rolled in a homemade mixture of bread crumbs and various spices, herbs (garlic and onion powder, bbq mixture). I used a mixture of freshely grated romano/parmesan.
