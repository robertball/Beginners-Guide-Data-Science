I make steamed brussels sprouts all the time -- if you steam them for as long as 30 minutes, first of all your pan will boil dry and second of all, they will basically cook down into mush.  Monitor as they cook to reach your desired consistency.

Taste was good - strong dijon mustard flavor.  Agree with the others that if you were to steam brussels sprouts for 30 minutes, they would be mush. I did 10, and that was plenty.

Very different - and tasty! I agree with other reviewers. 8 mins is probably enough time to steam them - 30 would be way too much!

This recipe has become a favorite of my husband's.  Before preparing brussel sprouts this way, I couldn't interest him in even having them!  I have shared this recipe with my son and other friends!  Definitely worth a try.  I have also baked fresh brussel sprouts in the oven and then added the sauce.  I prepare fresh asparagus this way also.  375 degrees in an olive oil covered jelly roll pan for 18 to 20 minutes.  Very healthy!!

The flavor was excellent however 10 minutes was more than enough on the cooking time.

This was a nice spin on brussel sprouts, I used a New York Style mustard because I didn't have Dijon mustard, the flavor was kind of strong but in a good way...yummy!  I also steamed for about 15-20 minutes instead of 30 minutes.  I will definately make this again!

My husband took seconds!!
It took longer than 8 minutes to cook the brussel sprouts, but not 30 minutes. I'd say 15.

Amazing! I don't like brussels sprouts but wow I do now. I added mushrooms and ground meat and made it into a bit of a stir-fry. Lots of flavor and very filling.

I did the sprouts in the microwave.  The sauce made for a really good dish with them.

Great recipe! :-D

Slight and loyal variations:
Whisk the lemonjuice into the dijon and serve as a dipping sauce next to the sprouts. Drizzle with finely chopped spring/green onions. This makes the dish more appealing, and one could adjust "hottness" individually. For even more individuality you could put some of the spices into the dijon-sauce instead of mixing it into all the sprouts.

Serve with a good quality sausage, a slice of freshly baked wholemeal bread and a large beer! 

extra:
I would prefer to slice and steam the Brussels sprouts for just 5-7 minutes (according to WHFoods.org guidelines).
