made these into cupcakes to give away to the neighbors for St. Paddy's day.  No need for food coloring, as the pistachio pudding does it for you. I didn't have a white mix but a yellow instead so just added a few drops of green food coloring to the cake batter.  I like this better than the Watergate I recipe because of the coconut.  I did use a stabilizer (mrs. Oedeker's) since I didn't know if folks would refrigerate right away.  Used a store brand version of Dream Whip and it came out perfect.  I didn't have lemon-lime carb. soda so used some Aquafina brand Citrus blend carbonated water.  Any carbonated clear beverage would do.  Placed a cherry atop each cupcake.  Looks really cute and festive.

Very good! Pecans and coconut make this recipe better than the other watergate cakes listed on this site.

Would be great for St. Patrick's day.  Everyone loved it.  Thought I had overcooked it, but it was very moist.

Awesome recipe!! I used sliced almonds instead because that was what was on hand. I toasted coconut and almonds for topping! Next time I may try adding crushed pineapple!YUM!  It's a keeper!

This is very good. As another reviewer said the nuts and coconut make this recipe better than any other on this site. Made it exactly as recipe states, wouldn't change a thing!
