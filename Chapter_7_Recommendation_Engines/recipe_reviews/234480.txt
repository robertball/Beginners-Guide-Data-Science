So quick and easy.  my son (2.5yrs old) and I made it in about 10mins for my husband's birthday cake.  he's not a cake person so this was great.  he liked it! we didn't bother with icing it - didn't need it anyway. we added special sprinkles my son picked out instead.  will make again! lots of leftovers for work.

Cake was really tasty!  I feel bad that other people gave it a low rating then noted that it was cake consistency so it didn't work on their pizza stone!  The name of the recipe is Chocolate Chip Cookie CAKE so yes it does need a pan with edges!!!
The frosting has way to much butter in it!  I literally have pools of melted butter on the top of my frosting that separated itself!  I would look for a different chocolate frosting recipe!

This recipe was terrific. I made it for my twins' birthday. I would make it with less sugar next time. I made it in a pizza pan which I lined with parchment paper. I didn't use half of the icing, so I put the leftovers in the freezer.
It was nice looking and very tastey. I think they will like it for their parties too.

Very rich, but everyone loved it!  I cut the recipe in half and used a round Corningware, added M & M's for color instead of chocolate chips.  Highly recommend a la mode!  Thanks.

Made it tonight for my daughter's birthday tomorrow. Made two with ice cream that I dyed blue in the middle. Came out great. Going now to try and find a good topper for it. Thanks

Note: It IS really more of a cake-like consistency.  I spread the batter on my pizza stone thinking it was a bit thicker, more cookie-like, to have it almost drip off the stone as it spread during baking.  It is very light in texture and yummy!  I cut to fit onto a large, beautiful glass platter and decorated it for my daughters birthday.  May make again.

Not bad flavor. I would add more chocolate chips next time. Also took 3 times longer than calculated on recipe to cook through.

Fantastic! Definitely more cake-ish but also like a big soft cookie. Didn't think it needed frosting and I made it in a 9x13 glass pan so cooking took 35 minutes. I also sprinkled 3/4 of chocolate chips over the top before baking and pressed them lightly in. Will absolutely make it again.

This was definitely more like a cake than a cookie. Not bad, but we prefer more of a traditional cookie cake.

Imade this for my son's birthday. It was delicious. The only thing I would change is less sugar.
