As I always have with other vegetables as well, I frequently cook green beans with bacon and garlic. It was the addition of onion and the cooking method itself, that caught my eye. I always saute the bacon and garlic, then add the COOKED green beans to the pan and toss   to coat. With this recipes's method, the green beans lose their vibrant color, the bacon gets limp, and the dish looks "muddied" overall. I'll stick to my method, where both the beans and the bacon retain their rich color and where the bacon flavor enhances, rather than overwhelms, the beans.

Nice change from the traditional green bean casserole for the Holidays.  Used a packaged thick sliced bacon and frozen whole petite green beans.  Cooked the bacon whole first until it was crisp then removed from pan. As per other reviews only retained about 1 tablespoon of the grease.  When I added the beans and the water I put a lid on the pan but left it cracked which allowed the beans that were not in the water to steam, while allowing the water to evaporate.  When the beans were cooked and the water was pretty much gone, I returned  the crisp bacon which I had chopped to the pan and tossed, put the lid on tightly and just let it sit for about two hours.  I didn't want the beans to get mushy, but did want the bacon to soften up a bit.  Right before serving  I just heated it up.  Everybody loved it - will definitely make again.

This turned out yummy, although the onion and garlic flavor was overshadowed by the bacon.  It was also a tad greasy so I felt like it wasn't as healthy as green beans should be.  Next time I think I will cook the bacon completely in the pan first, then set aside to drain on paper towels.  I will pour out all but a tablespoon or two of grease, and then cook the beans, onion and garlic in those drippings with the water.  Hopefully that will allow some of the other flavors to come out.

Have used this recipe for years, but I traditionally drain the bacon grease before cooking the garlic and onion as I have found that it tends to overpower the other flavors found in this recipe and add the bacon back prior to serving.  Chicken broth vs water also gives a better flavor to the finished dish.  Easy to modify to your own family's taste buds, ie., add mushrooms, toasted almonds, even gorgonzola cheese.  Thanks Michele for a winner!

This is a GREAT tasting recipe!  Reminded me of green beans from when I was a kid.  I just cut up the bacon with kitchen shears, it's a lot easier than using a knife.

Great side dish, though I wouldn't recommend covering the skillet while cooking - the bacon and onions got a little watery.  I added toasted almonds which added to its great flavor.

i cooked the bacon, onions and garlic together while i boiled the beans quickly in a little chicken broth with a slice of bacon for added cooking flavor and then added fresh sliced mushrooms to the mix to saute  i blanched the beans --plunge in cold water --to keep their color and crispness--then added them to the fry pan mix and heated together--since i like to make things ahead i put it aside and later put it in the oven to heat up at dinner time (would have used the micro if the oven hadn't been on already-- very good blend of flavors

Really tasty way to eat green beans. Everyone enjoyed them, except for my green bean hating 8 year old, but she was the exception! Followed the advice of removing the bacon grease (left just enough to barely cover the pan), cooked the onions and garlic and added chicken broth instead of water. When green beans were just about finished, I added back in the cooked bacon pieces to warm them back up. Will definitely make again!

I was hoping that the little black cloud from friday would clear out, and I FINALLY did something right...made a successful meal, which included these beans.  YUM.  I used red onion (my favorite) and instead of water, I used beef broth.. we all liked this one, thanks Michele ;) Now that I am home bound...CHEERS!!

I thought this was a good recipe although I like to add my previously cooked bacon at the end so it's not soft. I always read other reviews for suggestions. thanks Michelle for the recipe.

When I saw this recipe I realized that it was very similar to what my mom used to make when we were kids. I had to call her and ask if she sweetened it at all as I remembered just a hint of sweetness. Apparently she did and I added a touch of karo syrup. I'm not big on sweets period, but this brought back comforting memories. It was a nice vegie addition to our party yesterday, that the GALS gobbled up while the guys concentrated on the meat. Excellent Michele and thanks!

You can never go wrong with bacon as it always flavor any dish wonderfully. I took a slight detour and blanched the beans in hot water for 1 minute and then set it aside until the bacon, onions and garlic were done cooking. My main concern was losing the green beans bright green color. I removed the bacon, onion and garlic to the side of the pan and added the green beans. I saut√©ed the green beans in the bacon grease seasoning with Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. The green beans kept their flavor and color. The overall dish was tasty and like I said, you really cannot go wrong with bacon with its crisp salty pork flavor enhancing any dish. This was served with, "Mushroom Stuffed Chicken Rollups," and "Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Orzo," also on this site.

This type of recipe is frustrating for non-experts. I wish there was a way to request more info. It says to cook until the beans are tender. Since cooking the bacon/onions takes about 5 minutes and the box says "cook time 30 min" I have to assume I am to boil the beans for 25 minutes. It also says to cook the beans until the water is evaporated, so I assume the pot is uncovered, but usually beans are steamed and that requires a covered pot. I will just assume that "fat begins to render" means the bacon is cooked. Please remember that non-experts read the recipes as well!

On the taste side, it seems to taste good. I found the bean taste very strong so perhaps I put too many beans in..oh well..

I removed some of the grease as well, cooked the onions, and then set aside.  I ended up cleaning out the pan, putting in the water, garlic powder, and cooked onions.  I threw in my fresh green beans, covered them, and let them cook.  When I could start smelling them, then I added the bacon and continued to cover it.  Finally, I added more garlic powder to bring out that flavor more.  VERY good!  I may be getting fresh green beans from now on!

I drained most of the bacon fat except for 1-2 Tsp.  I cooked my beans seperatly and then added it to the drained cooked bacon, garlic, onion, tossed to coat and it was very good.  THX

These turned out fabulous. I used frozen thin green beans and 1 T. dried minced onion. I used precooked bacon and left it in slices as I don't eat the bacon and it was easier to just get green beans for my serving in doing that. Don't worry, my hubs was more than happy to put the bacon on his plate. I found some chicken broth opened in the fridge so I replaced half the water for that. Taste these before you salt them as the bacon added quite a bit and I don't think the additional salt was necessary. This was really good.

This is a great recipe for green beans! I followed other reviewers & removed the bacon before adding the beans & liquid. I also used beef stock instead of water then added the bacon back at the end. I made it for the first time 2 nights before Thanksgiving & it was so good we had to add it to the Thanksgiving menu! That time I used chicken stock & it was just as good. This recipe is definately added to our regular rotation & would probably work great with asparagus too. THANKS!

Good & Tasty. Boil or Steam the beans to half way cooked to your liking. The first time around i used fresh green beans and let boil for about 5 minutes and it burnt my garlic and the beans were still not cooked. Next time i will steam my beans then add to the mixture and will add the garlic at the end.

This is very tastey & easy to make!  When I'm short on time I brown chopped canadian bacon w/onions and add a bag of microwave steamed green beans.  Toss to coat & it's ready to serve!  My husband & my 4 year old love these green beans!!

These are really good and easy! I cooked the bacon in a separate pan and I used about 1 TB. of grease in the other pot. I added the garlic and when it was hot and then dumped in the green beans and water. It took a good 20 min. for the water to evaporate. I also didn't add any onion and left the bacon out until they were all done. I wanted my bacon to be crispy. I will definantly make these again.

5/9/16 I made this recipe again tonight, and it is becoming my favorite way to prepare green beans!  I follow the recipe very closely, but I now use chicken stock, instead of water, for a flavor boost.    I'm a Southern gal, so the bacon in the green beans wasn't new.  However, Mom never fixed them like this!  I did drain out most of the rendered fat, and I used the baby whole green beans, but stayed true to the recipe after that.  Everyone loved them, and hubby went back for thirds!  I will make these again, but will probably reserve them for special occasions.  Gotta watch those fat grams....

Simply, quick, tasty and kid-friendly. The bacon looks watery though in the end, not like those in the picture. Perhaps the recipe omitted statin the bacon had to be withdrawn and re-added after beans are tender.

This is a good, old-fashioned, southern country style green bean recipe. I probably overcooked my beans a little but (until they were soft), but I kindof like tham that way. This recipe reminds me of the green bean my grandma used to make. I'll definately be making this again!

I loved these green beans.  They seem so comforting with all that bacon and onion.  I used pre-cooked bacon and just browned it with the onions in a little bit of oil.  I cooked mine for about 30 minutes to get to the texture that I like.

I make this dish all the time, and it is my bf's ALLTIME FAVORITE veggie side, with the following changes:  after seasoning with salt and pepper, I add shredded cheese (usually 5 cheese italian blend) and some crushed croutons....about 3/4 c or more cheese and 1/2 or less crumbs...stir cheese til melted then sprinkle crumbs over and stir to soak up some of the moisture....mmmnmmmnmmmn they ARE good this way!  Thanks for the great starter recipe that has become a hit in my house Michele!!!

This was great! I removed the bacon & added it back in after the beans were done cooking, I didn't want it to get soggy. I also just realized I forgot the garlic, oops - we didn't miss it though

I wouldn't have imagined this combination would be so good.  I did follow others suggestions and only partially covered the green beans while cooking.

Very tasty!  In the future, I will remove the bacon and all but a teaspoon of the drippings from the pan and return the bacon once the green beans are nearly finished.  prefer a bit of crispness to the bacon.  I may even reduce the bacon by a couple of strips.  This dish WAS quite bacon-y.  I will definitely make this again, though!  Went wonderfully with roast beef!

I make this for my family a lot. But I also alter the recipe a bit. First I steam my fresh green beans is sea salt and water. Then I add butter to the skillet and throw in a handful of minced onion. Then throw in baby bella mushrooms and saute them for just a few mins. Then add the green beans and to cut the fat out I use bacon bits on top add garlic salt and pepper  and watch it disappear. This is one of the only ways I can get my pick children to eat their vegies! Hope you enjoy. Very fast and easy.

I make a short-cut version, using Oscar Meyer bacon pieces.  Put the green beans in a skillet, add a tbls. of butter, minced garlic, bacon, onions and white wine.  Cook until green beans are tender, add water if you need more liquid to get the beans done, YUM!  No need to add salt, the bacon will get them plenty salty!

I picked this because my kids love bacon and I was hoping to get them to eat green beans.  They did not like it.  I didn't like it either because I felt that the bacon overpowered the flavor of the green beans.

RAVES!!!  I served these green beans with our Christmas Prime Rib and there wasn't one drop left on anyones plate. There was a tinly bit left over in the pan in the kitchen and my picky nephew even ate all that with his fingers! It's an easy recipe to follow. I fried the bacon ahead of time because of the last minute time crunch. I crumpled the bacon after it had cooled and left about 3 tablespoons of drippings in the pan. About 30 minutes before serving dinner I finished the recipe and left the beans in the frying pan to stay hot. As a side note, I used 2 lbs fresh green beans and an entire pound of bacon which was good because the relatives kept nibbling on the bacon when I had it sitting on the counter. I will make this again and again.

4 stars as written, 5 with my modifications. During the winter when I can't get fresh green beans, I use drained, canned green beans and I do not use the water but instead use a stick of butter. The water is just way too much liquid. The water is ok if you have all day to let the beans simmer (I usually don't). Now, these are not for those watching their cholesterol! They are so yummy though, my mouth is watering writing this!

Varied this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it (kids included!) : Used frozen petite green beans instead of fresh along with a generous pinch of red pepper flakes. In a large wok with 1T of olive oil cooked beans with other ingredients for approx. 5 mins. and then added 1/4 cup water, covered and let steam for 3-4 mins. Remove lid and cook until liquid has evaporated. Green beans still have a little crunch to them and these are awesome!!

This is pretty much the tried and true southern way to make green beans. If you like your beans with some bite to them you won't like these. I love them and its my go to way to fix green beans if not in a hurry. Don't use canned beans! The result will not be near as good, if you don't have fresh frozen is the better alturnative.

I looooove this recipe.  I hated green beans with a passion. But this recipe is so good that I actually love green beans now. Plus my mother still makes the green bean casserole, but with this out there no one eats it.

I have long been intimidated by fresh green beans and always used canned.  I decided to branch out with this recipe.  I did not have bacon, so I just used the onion and garlic.  It was delicious.  I know the bacon would have made it taste even better.  I would, however, take the bacon out after I cook it so as not to make the green beans greasy.

This smelled amazing cooking! I halfed the amount of bacon and added extra garlic. They are a little greasy but that's southern style green beans ya'll. I will try other suggestions next time and drain the grease. For health's sake. Can't beat fresh green beans and their cheap. Just make sure you cook em 3 or 4 days after you buy em

With bacon...,hmmm..., it's great. 
But when I cook the green beans, I always fry them with mashed meat. 
It's Chinese style and also very tasty.

Very tasty.  Made it as an alternative to green bean casserole for Thanksgiving.  I would remove the bacon from the pan so it stays crisp before adding the beans and then add it back at the end.

Delicious. I tried it with just 3 slices of thick applewood smoked bacon and it was plenty.  I also used chicken broth in place of water.  Also added sliced white mushrooms before I added the broth. Served this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit.  It's a keeper.

I cut down the green beans (about 1-2") and boiled them in a separate pot then added them to the skillet the bacon cooked in.  I also drained most of the bacon grease before adding the garlic, beans, and salt and pepper to taste (I ommitted the onions so the children would eat them).    Finally I allowed everything to simmer for just a few minutes so the flavors could blend.  They were a really nice alternative to the greenbean casserole on Thanksgiving.

I've made this recipe several times and it's always a hit. The only thing I change is using chicken broth instead of water for a little extra flavor. My family loves garlic so I add a little extra. The second time I made this recipe I added a few quartered red potatoes and about half a cup extra broth and it turned out great. I've even made this on the grill in heavy duty foil packets. Fry up your bacon, onions and garlic first, add your liquid, then pour it over the green beans in the foil pack and cook over indirect heat until the green beans are tender.

Very good recipe,  I'm not a huge green bean fan but I really liked these.  I even got my children to eat some.  Its a keeper.
The only slight change I made I added fresh mushrooms with the onions, just because I had them and had to do something with them.  They didn't change the taste of the beans, I don't believe and they tasted really good.  I can't think of anything that wouldn't be good saute in bacon fat, onion and garlic.

I halved the recipe and used frozen beans which worked fine. I also used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning instead of salt for that authentic Louisiana flavour. An easy side dish thanks!

My beans had cooked before the liquid had all evaporated (I probably didn't have a full pound) so I threw in a pinch of flour and also celery seed for good measure, made them Germanish.  Also I didn't bother slicing or cutting the bacon, I cooked it whole, removed it from the pan, cooked the onion and garlic and then when I added the green beans simply crumbled the bacon in with my hand.  So tasty and exactly what I wanted!  Served with garlic mashed potatoes, grilled sausage and fresh sliced tomato.

We thought this was great. As other reviewers suggested, I first steamed the beans for about 5 minutes. I also used chicken broth instead of water, and threw in some red pepper flakes. These were delicious!!!

These are AWESOME green beans, thanks!  My husband is not a big fan of green vegies, but has asked me to make these twice since the first time.  I've had to double the water each time, but we do like our green beans on the softer side.  An extra plus is how great the house smells while these are cooking!

This was delicious!! I used pole beans, and shallots instead of onions...I was in a hurry, so I sauteed the bacon, garlic and shallots, salt and pepper while I steamed the beans seperately in the microwave for 2 minutes. When the bacon was pretty crispy, I added the beans and sauteed for a few minutes. I will definately make this again. I actually have made a version of this recipe using proscuitto, shallots, garlic, salt, white pepper, and brussel sprouts instead of the beans...it's THE only way to eat brussel sprouts!!!

I made this recipe for the first time on thanksgiving.  It was very flavorful and my 18 month old nephew couldn't get enough! The only change I would make would be to cook the bacon in whole strips and then chop up after cooking.  I found the bacon to be a little overpowering so I may even just leave it for the cooking process and remove half of it before setting on the table in the serving bowl.  I will make this again very soon!  Loved it!

I really liked this recipe because it was simple. I did add more water and let them simmer away while I was preparing other things on Thanksgiving( I like them more tender).

I make this same recipe except with some minor yet important modifications. I drain the bacon fat completely, even whipe the pan. I then coat the pan with some olive oil and about a tablespoon of butter I then add the garlic and onions, let them cooked for about three minutes and then turn up the heat a little more and sear the green beans more or less tossing them in the pan I then sprinkle some red pepper flakes the chopped bacon right before I turn off the pan, keeping a good bite consistency to the green beans.  Delicious!

WoW!!! My husband has been doing this for years, didn't know it had a name. 
He  slices bacon into small pieces browns the bacon then adds the onion & cooks until translucent, then the garlic, salt,pepper. He uses a couple of can of french style green beans. 
no extra water is needed. In fact he drains the water off of the beans a little. Doesnt take any time ready real fast. 
Our family loves this dish & like the previous comment a nice change from green been casserole.

Excellent! Followed reviewers' suggestions and pulled the bacon out, drained part of the grease (used it to fry potatoes), cooked the green beans, and then added the crumbled bacon back in.

Very good.   I used real bacon bits.  First I browned the red onion and minced  garlic with a bit of olive oil, then added bacon bits and green  beans and chicken broth.    It turned out great!

My kids who are not big green bean eaters, especially fresh green beans,  not only ate these first, but they asked for SECONDS.  Unheard of for my kids.  Definitely a 5 star.  Easy to make -- I didn't have thick sliced bacon, but I had packaged real bacon bits.  I sauteed these in EVOO along with onion and garlic.  Did use a little more salt than called for-- maybe because I didn't fry up the bacon myself.  They were good the next morning stirred into scrambled eggs -- what a yummy omlette.

Nice flavor but way too greasy and a little too much bacon. Might try again  - next time draining as much grease as possible after adding garlic and onions but before adding water and beans.

Wow!  Tasted like I remember green beans tasting at my southern grandmother's.  Subbed 1/4 cup real bacon bits for bacon and sauted the onions and garlic in 1 1/2 tsp of heart healthy margarine instead of using fresh bacon and the bacon grease.  My beans were not the most tender but after cooking for about an hour you couldn't tell.  Really a nice change of pace from the usual steamed green beans.  Will certainly make again.

These are the best way I have ever had green beans. Very tasty and a great texture. I let mine stir fry a little bit after water is gone to carmelize the onions.

This recipe is fast, easy and tastes great. I would recommend reducing the amount of liquid if you like green beans that are more crisp.  I use an electric wok to keep everything crisp and extra hot.  This has become a staple at our holiday meals.

I grew up with my mama making it exactly this way, and I'm 63 years old. Very good and I still make it to this day. Occasionally I will add boiled, till barely tender quartered red potatoes to the bacon and bacon grease and let them finish cooking with the beans. Also taught to me by my mother.

What a fantastic dish!  The entire family really enjoyed this recipe.   There were requests for seconds!  I believe you should follow the recipe exactly the first time that you make the dish.  Thereafter, you can make you changes.  Don‚Äôt forget once you make changes you are no longer making the dish that you selected.  Instead you are making your version.  I cannot wait to make this dish again for the family.

Hello green beans. bacon, onion and garlic goodness.  You all play so nicely together.  What a wonderful combo!

I changed up the recipe and pre-cooked the bacon as well as sweating the onion / garlic combo in my wok for about 5mins.  I then sauteed the combo and green beans at medium high heat for about 8mins or so....then everyone in the pool.  The bacon broken into small pieces and bacon grease with green beans, onions and garlic were combined in the wok and simmered for a few minutes mixing all that love together.

Very easy and quick to make. I used the frozen petite green beans and chicken broth instead of water. I also put the bacon in at the end so it wouldn't be too soggy.  Turned out great!

Easy for family picnic, I just tripled the recipe. I kept about half the bacon grease, and crumbled the bacon while it was still hot. Also, I used frozen green beans (they're fresher than "fresh" beans, unless they come from your garden. After beans were cooked, I put everything in a crock pot and set it for "buffet", or you can use the warm setting. I added the bacon right before we ate so it wasn't soggy.

Four and a half stars but not quite five. Pretty simple concept.  Good way to dress up green beans so the kids will eat them. I pre cooked both the bacon and beans separately then threw them together to prevent the dish from being to watery or greasy.

Outstanding, very flavor deep! I started to put the beans in a steamer and decided to just follow the dang recipe, and i'm so glad I did! Excellent mouth feel and taste for days, I will be having this many many more times.

Delicious! My whole family loved this dish.  I made sure that the bacon was fully cooked before I added the onions and garlic; otherwise, the onions became overcooked.  Added generous amount of sea salt and fresh ground pepper at the end. Perfect.

This was great. I added feta cheese at the end (idea from another recipe on this site). Scaled it down to 2 people.  Had a few more onions than called for, but it tasted great anyway.

These were fantastic. The beans retained their color, but they were premium priced beans so that may have had something to do with it. I would assume just better or more preservatives lol. 

Once the water cooked down I just let the dish fry a little bit and had a nice mix of crispy and tender bacon as well as giving a better texture to the onions.

As the recipe is I think it is a solid 5 star. Reducing it to only 2 slices of bacon reduced the presence of the bacon in the flavor, and probably made it somewhat healthier. Even as is it isn't really unhealthy if it's paired with sensible dishes.

AWESOME!!  These green beans are delicious!  Of course, add enough bacon to anything and you have a delicious meal.  I did drain off most of the bacon grease, and I'm glad I did.  All that grease would have ruined this dish.

Loved these! I didn't change a thing, except I added some sugar while they were cooking. Just a sprinkle! Yummy! They did take longer than 30 minutes, for me, and I had to add more water.

Too much onion, not enough garlic or bacon flavor.  The bacon and onions are too conspicuous - there's an overall good flavor, but the sizes of all of the pieces are too much in contrast.  It would be better if it yielded some type of sauce to bind it together - I would try it again if I could find a way to use some type of garlic sauce (or something of that consistency) along with the rest of it.

This was a great twist to boring green beans. The bacon flavor was fabulous - but also extremely oily (hence the 4 stars). In future I would cook the bacon until it's crispy, remove it from the pan along with some of the bacon fat and then add the bacon once again when the green beans are done cooking.

Awesome!  I didn't add any water for cooking, i prepared a separate pot with boiling water and let the green beans cook for 2 minutes then transfered them to the pan with the bacon.  They turned out wonderful!

I love green beans and this recipe is so tasty. I used regular sliced bacon, cooked until crispy and removed bacon from the skillet. Stirred onion and tons of fresh minced garlic to the fat. Lastly, I added the green beans and water. Topped it off with the crumbled bacon.

I have had green beans with onion and bacon before, but my husband never has and thought this was a great and different way to make green beans.  I made this recipe as is and would not change one single thing!  This recipe is now a family favorite!

Made this tonight to go along with my Christmas Eve dinner.  What a HUGE hit it was.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe (which is slightly unusual for me) and it was just perfect.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

This is an excellent recipe, with a few tweaks, in my opinion. First, I used no onion. Once I browned the bacon I removed it from the pan, drained all but 1 TBSP of the fat, then added the green beans and garlic to saute for about one minute. I then added 1 cup CHICKEN BROTH (in lieu of water) and covered the pan. Towards the end of cooking I removed the lid (to let the liquid evaporate) and added the bacon back to the pan just to warm through. Great flavor and a great alternative to my usual roasted green beans. I will definitely be making these again and again!

Perfect complement to my meatloaf - couldn't have tasted better!  The best tip is to only use about 2 Tbsp of the bacon grease.  That amount was just perfect.

I made a few changes to this- I cooked the bacon and drained some of the grease, added the onion and garlic as well as sliced mushrooms. Meanwhile I steamed the grean beans and then added them to the bacon mix. This worked well so it wasn't too greasy and the bacon flavor wasn't overwhelming.

I am more inclined to rate this 3.5. I steamed the grean beans first (with a red pepper), drained most of the grease from the bacon, sauted the onion and garlic and then added the beans, pepper and bacon at the end.  These were a nice change and I will probably make these again.

I made some changes to this and it was fantastic. I simmered a ham bone from the freezer for a couple of hours and then cooled, removed meat and strained broth and used in place of the water. I added the ham meat into the beans with the bacon, lots of fresh ground black pepper and wow was this great. Thank you!

I pretty much followed the recipe except for I did cook the beans before adding them with the bacon.  Also I drained most of the bacon grease and just added a splash of olive oil to the finished product.  Was very good.  Also followed the tip about using kitchen shears on bacon made it super easy.

These were really good with my Easter dinner!  I did make some slight changes:  I only used 3 slices of bacon which provided just the right amount of flavor without being too greasy.  I used chicken stock instead of water.  Then, instead of black pepper I put about 2 pinches of crushed red pepper when I added the stock to provide just a bit of zip.  Yummy!

I really loved this recipe.  I used frozen green beans and therefore I omitted the water, but I'm sure it'll taste that much better using fresh green beans.  I chopped bacon into small enough pieces so that every biteful would have bacon in it.  As a low-carber a good side dish is hard to find and this recipe makes sticking to the diet that much easier.  Thank you for this great recipe.  As a matter of fact, I'm making this again tonight!  Bon apetit.

These were really good. To save on time I used pre cooked bacon (which cut down on the grease tremendously)and fresh green beans. These were gone in a minute.

Awesome, I've been making something similar for years only I often substitute frozen whole green beans and don't use water.  I highly recommend adding balsamic vinegar to coat and a splash of sherry near the end of cooking for a kick (check the balsamic mushrooms on this site).

Nice, easy side dish.  Less bacon and crumbled on top right before serving not cooked in the pan with the beans.

I made these for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved them. There were none left at the end of the meal. I was a little bummed, because I wanted leftovers!

This is the one part of my holiday meal that was a disappointment.  Part of it is my fault because the beans probably should have been cooked a little bit longer.  But I was expecting the beans to pick up more of the flavor from the garlic, onion, and bacon.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I might try to make them again, but cook them a day ahead and let them sit overnight and then reheat the next day.

Excellent side dish. We followed the recipe and I did chop the bacon and only left 1 tablespoon of the grease.  It made it less greasy but it was a great dish. Also I used red onion instead, which has a better taste for any food. Got complimented on it too. You don't feel the onions or the garlic in this dish and the green beans taste delicious.

I also make this recipe with beef broth I add small new potatoes and place in a large skillet with a lid. I peel around the center of the potatoe only.  Add beef broth and let simmer until the potatoes are tender.

These were AWESOME!  I used real bacon bits.  I sauteed the onions, garlic and  MUSHROOMS in butter (alot!), then added the bacon bits at the end.  Added the green beans last and just let them simmer til dinner was ready!  FANTASTIC and just what I was looking for.  Thanks :)

Wonderful taste!!!  I always add a can or two of pinto beans to this recipe as it gives it more texture/fiber.  Thanks for the great recipe -- will be enjoying this one for years to come.

I made this tonight as a side dish with prime rib, baked potato and asparagus soup.  Excellent and soooo easy to make.  The only thing I did, was to add a little bit of red bell pepper for presentation.  Otherwise made it exactly as recipe states.  Thank you for sharing.

Made this last night and I wasn't disappointed.  Followed the recipe to the T except I reduced the bacon as some had suggested in the other comments.  Next time I'll use the six slices :-)  I'll definitely be making this again!

My husband couldn't get enough of these!!! They were absolutely delicious! I used a bacon with 30% less fat, so there was little grease. ( I know at least one poster had not liked the grease.) But other than that, I saw no need to change the recipe. Try them!

Terrific! I admit that my measurements were eyeballed, and I added a bit more bacon. The color contrast between the bacon and green beans is attractive. I used to just add bacon to my beans, this recipe penetrates the bean without overwhelming. Quick and easy!

I didn't find this recipe to be too good, the beans were a little soggy.  I think next time I would remove the bacon bits after they are crispy and add at the end.  Also, only add a little bit of water at a time as needed.  I substituted homemade broth for the water but it still lacked flavor.

These are very good.  I did what others suggested and didn't use all the bacon fat so they weren't greasy.  Sprinkled a little garlic powder on them after the water disappeared to add more to the garlic flavor.   The onions got a little golden which added to the flavor.  This was the first time I'd ever made green beans not from a can.  They were crunchy which was different from what I'm used to.  I loved them.  I'd definately make this again.

Next time, I will drain half the bacon grease as it was too greasy for me.  I deglazed with a tiny splash of white wine and added water only as needed.  I like a sauteed bean that isn't too soggy.

Very good.  I didn't have a sense of how much 1 pound of beans would be, so when it came to adding the water, I wondered if the water was supposed to just cover the beans? It should be simmered open, right?  I assumed this to be the case, and had to add 3 cups of water.  When it was done, I added cheese as RanchGirl suggested.  Delicious!

I loved this recipe.  When the water would run dry I would add another cup of water and after that another and so on until I cooked the hell out of these bean.  I have cooked as short as 50 minutes to 3 hours.  I think the longer you cook the better.  I also added 8 slices of bacon.  I know a lot of people after reading their suggestions did not like the consistency of the bacon.  I took tongs and removed the bacon before serving.  The more I cooked these beans the more they tasted like my Mom's.  It brought back a lot of memories.

These were wonderful but I took the advise of many other reviewers and simmered them for a few hours.  I think I would like my green beans better just the way the recipe called for. The bacon would keep it's shape better.  Cooking it for hours allows the bacon and onions to lose their presentation and color.

I make fresh beans almost like this, but I always use a ham hock and cook on very low for at least 3 hours. I'll try adding the onion and a bit of garlic next time I do them. We call them "greasy beans". Delicious this way

I simmered the beans in chicken broth instead of water and substituted ready cooked chopped ham for bacon.  Easy and flavorful!

These were pretty good; something was missing, though I couldn't figure out what, but I'd definitely make them again as is (but with more salt/pepper).

Beans are the best when cooked fresh, even in winter. This is a simple recipe, but oh so tasty. Actually the only way to serve fresh beans in our house. For variation try ham bone or ham hock for flavor. Cook slowly (can cook them all day almost). Heavenly. I also often add new potatoes. Wonderful dish.

These were pretty good, not anything to rave about.  I thought they ended up a little greasy from all the bacon.  If I make them again, I will cut down the bacon and definitely use beef broth instead of water.

MMMM...these are so good! I had some fresh green beans that I had already cooked in the fridge but no bacon.hmm...what to do? I did have some bacon grease that I had saved (excellent to fry potatoes in!) & I also had some REAL bacon bits (don't use the imitation)so I heated up the grease, sauteed the onions & garlic, added the already cooked beans & bacon bits, salt & pepper, about 2 Tbsp.of water so it didn't burn and VOILA! It was delicious!

These beans are fantastic, so rich and tasty. I think these are the best beans I have ever made. I added some cooked rotini pasta to the leftovers for my lunch the next day. I highly recommend this recipe, and I can't wait to make it again SOON>

Great recipe!  I made changes though.  I prefer veggies crisp.  I saut√©ed the bacon, onion and garlic together.  I bought fresh green beens that cook in a bag in the microwave for a short time (no added water).  Then I mixed the cooked green beans and salt and pepper into the bacon mixture and voila - a yummy side dish!

This was really good! I used the fresh green beans and I did drain some of the bacon grease from the pan as other suggested here. I boiled the beans for just a few minutes in chicken broth and then blanched them before sauteeing. I saved some of the chicken broth and used that in place of the water. It was a top notch side for my pork loin!

As a bacon lover, I never thought I would find myself saying "too much bacon" but here I am, saying there is too much bacon in this recipe.  I used about half to 3/4 the amount called for.  Wright's bacon is the best!   Also, I find that "until the fat starts to render" is not long enough to cook the bacon.  I like to get mine to the almost crisp stage before adding the other stuff.  This will create more bacon drippings, so make sure to pour about  half of that off before adding the beans.    These are delicious!

I did use fresh green beans.  I steamed them until almost cooked and then added to the onion and garlic.  Simple to make and it was a big hit with the family.

Did not add the onion. Used some onion powder in its place.

Loved this recipe a lot and it will be my new go to when I make green beans! The only thing I did a little different was splash in some worcestershire sauce while it simmered and it really added a nice flavor.  Thanks!

Delicious and simple! I used broth so I cut the salt a bit. I had to cook it longer because our family likes softer beans. Great easy recipe!

This was so good and I'll definitely make it again.  I followed one review that suggested to cook the beans separately.  I had some fresh green beans and I cooked them in lightly salted water for 18 minutes, covered.  
In the mean time, in a separate pan,  I cooked the bacon until done.  I set the bacon on paper towels and discarded half of the bacon grease .  I cooked the onion in the remaining grease and added the garlic and  a couple of dashes of salt, cooked for a minute then added the cooked bacon.  When the beans were done I drained off what water was left and stirred the beans into the pan that had the bacon mixture.  Perfect.  After having this, you'll never want to have beans from a can again.

I was looking for a side dish for our Christmas dinner and didn‚Äôt want to eat the typical green bean casserole. I prepared this exactly as written and I loved them!  Great flavor!! Will be cooking this again.

I‚Äôve made these many times. They‚Äôre always delicious. I follow the recipe almost exactly. I love bacon so I usually put a whole pound instead of six slices. It does come out kinda greasy but I don‚Äôt mind, I think it adds to the flavor.

We've made a similar dish before and loved it. This one had good flavor, but I agree with some others that the beans were a bit limp. I think next time I would cook the beans before and just lightly saute with the other ingredients. Otherwise tasty though...I mean, there's bacon...enough said!

Yes, I would make them again. I liked the way the green beans cooked while the water evaporated. They didn't get mushy and still had a slight crunch. Next time I would cook the bacon first and take it out of the pan and let the bacon rest on a paper towel. I would take out all but a tablespoon of oil and grill the onions and garlic, then add the green beans and water. I would add the bacon after, so it would still have a nice crunch.

It was okay but if you use the recipe then you should boil the beans separately so they don't use their colour. I'd also add some more spices

This turned out pretty good but I think it would be so much better with chicken broth instead of water. Also I would a quick bkancr on the beans before adding them.

These are the best green beans ever.  I use two bags of extra fine frozen green beans, just adding them frozen.  Also, hog jowl bacon is amazing in these.  My family can eat these green beans and nothing else for a meal and be happy.

These beans were super tasty and full of flavor! I did change the cooking method and add in some fresh slices of red bell pepper. For the change in cooking method, I cooked the chopped bits of bacon about halfway through before adding in the bell pepper and onion slices and began cooking on medium-high heat for approx. 3-4 minutes. While the bacon, onion and bell pepper was cooking I added the fresh green beans into a separate pan full of about 3-4 cups of water and boiled them for about 5-6 minutes on medium-high heat until they were almost tender. I then drained the remaining water from the beans and added in the bacon, onion and pepper mixture to the beans along with the fresh minced garlic. I let the flavors mix together for a minute before adding in one cup of water and cooking the mixture for another 3 minutes on medium-high heat until the water evaporated. I then added in a few dashes of fresh ground pepper and a sprinkle of Kosher salt. The beans were full of flavor and still had a very mild crisp to them. They turned out perfectly with this method. I will be making them again in the future!

I am a spicy kind of person so I added some red chili to my recipe while cooking the bacon and onion. Used broth instead of water. I also cooked this dish in the crock pot after adding all items together. Simmered it on low for 1 hour and the family loved it.

I made these by microwaving the beans first and then putting them in the pan. They kept their bright color. I added the crumbled bacon just before serving.

My gosh these are good!  I made them today, and what a hit... It's already been suggested that I make them again.  I followed some advise from others, and used chicken broth instead of water, just a couple tbls. of bacon fat, and added the bacon when the beans were done.  I cooked the bacon crisp in whole strip, then broke it up in pieces and removed a lot of the fat.  I used regular bacon - a pound of it (don't forget that I tore off almost all of the fat, so it really wasn't a whole pound).  I cooked the bacon, onion, and garlic ahead of time, so all I had to do was cook the beans and add the bacon just before we ate..  Served to guests along with "Key West Chicken", also from this site, fresh corn on the cob, and a cold cabbage and pepper salad that I make.  coffee, peach pie (also from this site), and vanilla ice cream topped it off.  Fabulous dinner... thanks so, so much for sharing. You can bet I'll be making these again.  Oh, what flavor!

This turned out great! I cooked the bacon in oven rather than fried on stove and reserved acouple tablespoons of the grease to fry onions and garlic. Used 1c of chicken broth instead of water. Did not add salt just pepper. Yum this one is a keeper.

I like the method of cooking where the liquid is boiled away instead of poured off, which keeps you from losing a lot of the nutrients from the beans.  I would probably drain off a little bit of the fat next time, but love this recipe anyway.  I doubled the recipe and used a whole pack of thick sliced bacon.  I also used a can (2 cups) of chicken broth instead of water.  I am usually not a fan of green beans at all, but I can't stop eating them!  Will definitely cook again.

These green beans are the BEST I have EVER had. I followed one reviewers advice and cooked mine for a few minutes first. I also only used 5 strips of bacon (not that, that REALLY matters). Anyway, it was freaking AWESOME! I will definitely make these again.

Delicious! I made this as a side dish for my husbands visiting family. My mother in law said she never liked green beans, but these were the best she'd ever had, and now she would give green beans another chance. I doubled the recipe, but still could have had more. Better make a few extra servings because this one is a sure HIT!

Even though it is not the healthiest preparation of a vegetable, it sure is delicious!  And fairly easy to do.  The hardest part is breaking the ends off the green beans, should you choose to do that.

This was delicious! Similar to green beans I've had at southern restaurants.  I did cut the bacon to 4 slices because I just couldn't bring myself to use 6 and there was still enough bacon for every serving to have some in it. Next time I will use 3, just being health conscious. I used a bag of frozen petite string beans. My kids don't like veggies and ate these without complaining!

This was a fast and flavorful recipe to an otherwise dull vegetable, which paired well with grilled Tilapia.  The bacon, garlic and onion gave it the needed punch to compliment the beans.  In turn, received compliments from the kiddos who prior had professed they would never eat green beans. Hats off to the cook who shared this recipe.  It.'s definitely going into the recipe box!

A good, mild tasting recipe!
I did feel that it needed something extra, thus I added a teaspoon of light brown sugar, which brought out the flavor of the bacon more.
I would also suggest letting the bacon cook to a light crispiness before adding the green beans, mine came out too wet and chewy.

I followed this recipe except for the bacon and green beans. I used bacon pieces that you can get in the salad dressing isle. The beans did not come out so greasy. I also used two canned low sodium green beans. Delicious!

Oh. my. gah. This is soooooo good. I have never made fresh green beans before and these were amazing. I used six slices of Serrano ham rather than bacon and added it with the beans. I also used veggie broth rather than water as suggested by another reviewer. yummy!!

We have a version of this recipe every thanksgiving.  We call them heart attack green beans.  The only difference is we use a large can of Italian green beans (or just regular cut green beans if we can't find the italian) instead of the fresh green beans and skip the addition of the water altogeher.  So we brown the bacon,  onion and garlic, add the drained green beans, stir to coat and cook just until heated through.  We only eat this at the holidays because of the fat content, but EVERYONE loves them and requests them wherever we go.

This is sooo good!  I made this last night and there are not any left overs!  I did use frozen green beans as the fresh did not look good in the store and I fried bacon first and used about 2 tbs. of the baking grease and followed the rest of the recipe.  This will be a staple in our house!

I steamed fresh green beans, then tossed them with the bacon and onion mix (after draining most of the fat). I also used more bacon, and added salt and fresh ground pepper at the end.

Easy to do and very good. I forgot to dice my bacon before cooking so I just took out the bacon and chopped it with cooking shears. I also added mushrooms since we love them. I will be making this again.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  The turkey took longer than I thought, so my husband and I had our own "progressive" dinner.  Ate these first.  Finished off the whole thing!!  Most amazing thing ever!!!  Easy recipe to remember if I want to make it at someone else's house!

Great recipe!  I did follow the advice of one reviewer and steamed the green beans first and than added all the yummy stuff and it turned out perfectly... not to crunchy and not too soft!  I did have to soak up some of the grease with a paper towel, though.  I also toasted some blanched almonds (about 1/2 cup) and added them, too.  It was a delicious recipe and I will definitely make this again!  Thanks!!! :)

Yep - this is pretty much how I make my green beans, though I like to chop my onion into larger pieces, and I often forget to add garlic.  I also cook my bacon a bit longer and drain most of the bacon grease out before I add the beans and onion.

These were great.  The only thing I would suggest is not to mince the onion just chop it  up.

YUM! This was great. I like others, cooked my bacon and onion, removed it and tossed at the very end. I also substituted broth for the water. I plan on making this for thanksgiving!

It's a great way to serve green beans.  We loved it!  I used frozen whole green beans, and will be removing/returning bacon like others have suggested.

Good, but next time I'll cook the green beans separately, then add to the bacon/onion/garlic as others have suggested.

These were delicious!  I left out the bacon so I used a little butter and olive oil to saute the onion and garlic.  (also I used red onion although the recipe did not specify). I don't typically like green beans, but I thought these were great.

No Leftovers at the Dinner Table!! My husband is a VERY picky eater and he finished this. He loved it. I did crisp the bacon then take it out and crumble it on top right before serving and cut down the sauce. I only cooked the green beans for about 25minutes, we still like them a little tender but with some crunch. Thank you for this. My husband asked me to make Green Beans like this all the time now. :)

Excellent. I did cook the onions and garlic a little longer before adding the beans, about 3 minutes and I added an extra 1/4 cup of water, because my husband likes his green beans really tender. By a happy accident I'd picked up smoked bacon which went really well with this. I served this with roast chicken and everyone not only cleared their plates but went back for seconds. Thanks Michele.

OMG these were awesome.  I did do some things differently after reading the reviews.  I first started by cooking the beans in beef stock instead of water, while they cooked I cooked the bacon then added the onions and garlic after a few minutes so that it gave the bacon time to render its fat.  Once the beans were cooked I drained them and sprinkled some herb and garlic seasoning on them, when the bacon and onions were cooked I added the beans to the fry pan and mixed it all together.  This was the first thing that disappeared from the table, I even went back for seconds.  thanks for a great recipe

I was surprised at how much I liked this.  I thought it would be bland but it had a lot of flavor.  I made this exactly as written and won't change a thing next time I make it. There IS a lot of bacon, but that's what makes it taste good.

This is great!  Though fresh green beans are always best, in a crunch I will use canned green beans.  I cook the bacon first and use about 1-2 tablespoons of the fat to saute the onions and garlic in.  I then add the green beans and toss until hot. My family loves this!

We really enjoyed these beans. Like many others, I used beef broth. I like my greenbeans pretty done (not very crunchy), so I used more than the recommended quantity of liquid. I also added the bacon back in right at the end. These are awesome.

I made this recipe as described except I steamed the beans for 5 minutes just to give them a head start.  Me & my husband absolutely loved them but this is the first time I've made anything like this so I have nothing else to compare it to.  I prefer my vegtables crisp so the recipe was ok for me, but if you like your vegtables mushy, you'll definiely have to cook them longer or use frozen beans.  This dish is a bit labour intensive for me to be making too often, but I'll definitely be making this recipe again soon!

These are pretty darn good but pretty close to how I've been making them for years.  I cut up the bacon and fried it until crisp, removed the bacon, drained most of the grease and added the onion and garlic.  Right before serving, I added the bacon - makes all the difference.  Next time, I will fry the bacon whole, remove and crumble (probably easier).

Wow!  I loved this recipe.  My husband kept going back for more.  I followed the recipe close.  I added a little more bacon, more onion and garlic.  It was a wonderful addition to our Easter dinner.

Used frozen green beans and added potatoe and packet of chicken broth with cup of water. I like it spicy so I also added red pepper flakes.

This was a really great recipe, lots of flavor the longer you let the beans simmer with the onions. I did make one change, i used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. Tasted really nice and kept this dish pretty healthy. You dont have as much grease as you would with regular bacon, so you still could taste the flavor of the beans. Thanks will used again!

Sorry, this did not turn out for me. Good thing I cooked it in two batches -- I picked out all the beans from the ruined first batch to save them and add them to an improved second batch.

The first batch turned out with  soggy bacon and water logged onions. Everything was generally flavourless. 

For the second batch, I did up the bacon, onions, garlic, and a few handfuls of sliced almonds until everything was crispy. I cooked the beans separately and added everything together in the end to save the whole thing in time for the family meal.

These were good. I made my bacon in the microwave and  sauteed the bacon crumbs with the onion and garlic.  It took me about 30 min to have my green beans tender and I added more garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste.

I saw other's reviews saying it was too greasy so i used half the bacon and it was delicious!  My southern girlfriend and her mother said it tasted like home. Which is the best stamp of approval they give.

This is excellent (we aren't big bean eaters but wanted to make them for Christmas dinner because in-laws like beans) - I took advice of others and steamed the beans while browning the mushrooms and onions and I used bacon bits - turned out great

nice, simple addition to our Thanksgiving table, as we were getting pretty burned out on the traditional casserole. I didn't add bacon, just sauted the onions in the bacon grease I keep in the fridge. Everyone loved it.

I improvised a bit on the recipe to make it more filling and to minimize the grease. I saved only about a tablespoon of bacon grease to cook the beans in. once they were cooked i put them in a baking dish, sprinkled sliced almonds and chow mein noodles over the top, finishing off with some grated cheddar (no particular amounts of each.) 
i put the dish in the oven at 400 for about 4 minutes, just enough to melt the cheese. It was great! i think next time i will add some sort of salty seasoning and it should be just right.

My family and I really enjoyed these beans. Pouring out most of the bacon grease is a good idea. You can also add a little butter to these for a little extra taste (and calories)! They were great! Thanks for the recipe!

Not fantastic unless you love bacon and green beans. It did not induce any new flavour.

Nice change to the plain green bean.  Thank you Michele!  Next time I'll try the broth and removing the bacon to retain its crisp.

These were so good. The only thing I changed was to substitute chicken broth for the water.  I will definitely double the batch next time - we ate them all last night.

I needed to find a good green bean recipe - green beans are one of the few veggies my husband is willing to eat, but I am NOT a big green bean fan!  For the first time in my life I WILLINGLY had a second helping of green beans.  Even our picky 3 year old ate his green beans.  This is the one to make if your family is picky!

These beans were very tasty.  I had already started green beans on the stove in some water when I came across this recipe so my beans were almost done cooking. I drained them and followed the directions as far as bacon, onion and garlic. Then I dumped the green beans in and cooked for about 10 minutes. I did salt and pepper them to taste. Very good!

I don't know when fresh green beans have ever tasted better.  I did use another reviewers' suggestion and used chicken broth instead of water and therefore did not add any extra salt, but alot of fresh ground pepper.  Also very good with fresh yellow squash added.

I have cooked my green beans this way for many years except for using water, I use chicken broth...you might have to adjust the salt with the bacon and all...or even try low sodium bacon, but very good and much more taste!

OH MY GOODNESS! I have never made fresh green beans before, and now I will never use canned again. These were heavenly, and so simple. I cut the recipe in half because there are only three of us. It was perfect. Thank you so much.

I think omitting the salt and adding a teaspoon of chicken bouillon might give this a more exciting taste.

This recipe is great! I will be making this several times a month!!!! We made a few changes though. We used smoked turkey bacon, no garlic, and used the flat canned green southern green beans. I did not drain the beans as the water is too plain. I added butter and lots of pepper and some salt. THese are real southern cooked green beans..SO GOOD!

These had a nice flavor, I used crumbled bacon pieces and next time I think I will use ham.  I also like other reviewers think they need to cook for a lot longer, but I will definitely make them again!

These were very yummy!  I didn't have any bacon, so I just omitted it and the flavor was amazing!  Can't wait to try it when I have bacon on hand.  My two year old kept saying "mo peas"!

I did make 2 substitutions.  I used diced ham instead of bacon and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  The "gravy" (little that there was) at the bottom of the pan was absolutely delicious drizzled over mashed potatoes. I have made this with bacon too, so the 5* rating goes either way.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  It didn't have the flavor I would have expected, the bacon flavor was just about non existent and the onion was just so-so.  I was looking for a jazzed up recipe for green beans but this was rather blah and uninteresting

Thought this was great. Bought beautiful tender fresh green beans at farmers market. These are the best green beans I have ever had. So easy to make too.

Pretty good, even as leftovers.  I'm not sure why they're called "smothered" though.  I was expecting the water and the bacon fat would turn into a gravy of sorts but that wasn't the case.  Still good.  I'd make it again.

Everyone seemed to like these but they did seem to take a lot of time and heated up the kitchen quite a bit.  I will probably modify the method a little next time and cook the bacon in the microwave first.  Great recipe to play with!

I didn't realize that this is not the way everyone makes their green beans.  It's the way my mom and my grandma always made them! Hmmm, must be a southern thing!

I cooked these green beans for dinner. They were a hit. My 3 year old loved them. I cooked them down with a little extra water because I like "very tender" style, kind of like cacker barrel's.  I almost didn't want to share them because I was snacking on them all the way to the table.

Mmmmmmmmmm, these taste just like what my mom made while I was growing up. They take a little longer than the recipe says, but are well worth it. Served with Grilled chicken & it was the perfect veggie.

These tasted a little greasy to me but my husband and 2 year old loved them.  Will, make again but use less bacon.
