This is one of the most delicious soup/stew recipes I have ever made! I've made it several times, and I always make extra to freeze a family-sized portion. Making the spice mixture in bulk is a great idea. It saves a lot of time and we love Moroccan lamb burgers using this mixture too. I have also found this recipe to be very forgiving. I've omitted items, added stuff like kale and zucchini, tweaked the spices when I was out of one, and substituted dried cranberries, figs and raisins for the apricots in a pinch. I’ve also used less broth to make it more hearty, and served it over rice and couscous. Enjoy!

I added a big parsnip, I only had one sweet potato so I added two small russet potatoes, and I thickened the liquid by adding flour to the ground lamb and onions, just before adding the liquids.

This is a great recipe ... definitely a bi-weekly repeater!  I used red lentils. I forgot to get the dried apricots, so added half a jar of apricot jam.  I also added 1/2 cup of Israeli couscous to thicken it a bit.  It's delicious!

pretty good, but way too sweet for me and too oily.  i added more broth, more salt and next time i will use a lean ground turkey. also, one sweet potato was definitely plenty.

Last time I made it I forgot I had run out of lentils.  Too late to get some, so I subbed 1/2 quinoa/ 1/2 pearl barley.  I have added dates and raisins from time to time as well as pork or lamb.

Delicious! Easily adapted to the ingredients on hand…. the spice mixture is perfect.  No ground lamb here so I used lean ground beef - was excellent;  I used raisins instead of apricots because that's what I had, and added the juice of one lime, right at the end, which brightened it up beautifully. Thanks for a really great recipe!

This is good as far as the tlavorings go although I would add a teaspoon or two of Harrisa (can be found in most Middle Eastern stores) and prefer my lamb in chunks rather than ground. Otherwise a really nic, tasty stew for a winter warmer.

Great recipe!  This stew tastes amazing!!  After viewing all the other photos and seeing that the broth appeared to be more "soup-like" as opposed to stew consistency, I made a few changes, but the recipe basically remained the same.

Excellent recipe!  Made it as is, with 3 exceptions.  Used 2 lbs. of cubed lamb, used chicken and beef stock (instead of broth and consommé), and doubled the apricots (I cut each into 4 pieces).  Got rave reviews from 4 teenaged boys!  One of my sons asked if we could have any leftovers tomorrow night, and serve it over couscous.  Check!

It was pretty good, but not five stars.  I had all the seasoning in hand, and followed the recipe pretty closely.  I added about 3 large garlic cloves, minced, subbed raisins for the apricots, and ran some fresh tomatoes through the food processor as I didn't have canned.  I forgot to add the butter, and rather than cut up carrots I dumped in half a bag of frozen carrots, peas, and corn.  I used my Instant Pot, and once the lamb, onions, garlic, and spices were sautéed and everything else was in there too, I sealed the lid and set it for 15 minutes at high pressure, as we were hungry and didn't want to wait 30 minutes for the lentils to cook.  That 15 minutes was the right guess, as everything was completely cooked - but it was runnier, soupier, than we liked.  We served it over Jasmine rice.  I don't know what I'd do next time for more flavor and  a thicker stew - more lentils?  tomato paste?  mash one  of the sweet potatoes?  Not flour or cornstarch, I don't think..... but it for sure needed more body.

Absolutely delicious with zero changes in the recipe.  The only difference is that I cooked it much longer because it was a bit watery. Next time I will reduce the broths.  I served it over rice. Three generations absolutely loved it:)!!! A DEFINITE KEEPER!!

I actually give this recipe a 4.75. Wow! This was really good. I made the recipe exactly as written right down to letting the spices meld into the lamb overnight. No substitutions, no changes. It was very aromatic and flavorful! I couldn’t stop eating it. Went back for seconds, then again for thirds! My mouth wanted more, but my stomach eventually overruled and I had to stop myself. I would have liked it to have a bit more broth though. I know it’s a stew and not a soup, but the broth was sooooo good! Other than that it was spot on. I will absolutely make this again. We might try it with hamburger next time only because it’s easier to find and more cost effective than lamb. I would be a little worried that it wouldn’t be quite as delicious though, so we’ll see.

One of the best ,most flavorful stews I've made. Huge hit with foodie family. Easy. Amenable to increases in spices.

I love food with flavor and this was a hit. Many wonderful rich spices. When I was visiting from CA I made this for my family in WI, many are not used to dishes like this but thoroughly enjoyed it. It made a large amount and with many other dishes to serve I would cut back and make half next time. I used lean beef as I'm not a lamb person. I cut the sweet slightly as you can always add more. Definitely would make again. If you like food with flavor this is  a keeper. I followed the recipe almost to the tee.

My husband and I loved this soup! I used russets instead of sweet potatoes because my husband isn't a fan of sweet potatoes. At first I was bummed to have to cut them out but the soup was still sooooo wonderful. I also imagine the russets cut down on the sweetness, which worked for us. A great mix of sweet and savory- you must try this soup!!!!!!!

I didn't have canned chickpeas so I left a bag of these overnight... So they where a little hard at the end.   Leftovers where even better than the original cook.  Very tasty.  My wife loved it!

This was phenomenal. The only change I made was that I increased the curry powder to a full teaspoon, as I love curry flavor. I also used low sodium chicken and beef broths, to try to cut down on salt. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and it was utterly delicious. Will make this again and again. Thanks!

Everybody in the family absolutely loved this soup.  I'm sure we'll be making it again many times.
