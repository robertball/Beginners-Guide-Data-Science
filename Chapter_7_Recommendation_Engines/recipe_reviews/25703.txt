By far the BEST beer cheese soup I have tasted, and I've tried many! This was very similar to a local Irish Pub's beer cheese soup. I do not like those beer cheese soups that use velveeta or american cheese. I did add a hint of nutmeg to this, though.

Per the comments listed, I altered this recipe.  I only used 1/2 cup of flour and added about 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  It was the perfect consistancy.  I also deleted the celery and carrots from the recipe and did not place the onions in the blender.  It added a little texture to the soup.  I will definately make this again.

I am giving this recipe four stars, but not as a soup. It was much too thick and rich for a soup, but it made a great cheese fondue. Tastes like the cheese fondue from The Melting Pot. Next time I make it, I will cut up cubes of bread, apples, etc. and just dip them in!

5 stars for "it doesn't get much easier than this" and "hearty delicious'ness". The diced carrots in this recipe give the soup a very pretty color. I would not omit them. Garnish with a bit of freshly chopped chives and toasty croutons. A definite keeper!

Very good recipe!!! We loved it! I added some cracked black pepper, as well as 1 tbsp worcertshire sauce. I also added some broccoli. The soup was very thick, I added a little more chicken broth and beer to thin it a little. I might add some milk to it for reheating to keepp it from getting too thick and clumpy. Will definately use again!

Oh, this was soooooo good! It DID taste just like the melting pot, and after we'd finished dinner, I kept going back to the small amount of leftovers I'd saved so I could have another small bowl of this soup. I wish we had more because I could eat it all night. It's just so savory, especially with granny smith apple cubes. I used 1/2 cup of flour, 3/4 cup of buttermilk, 12 oz. bottle of Miller Lite, and 1/2 cup of parmesan and mozzarella cheese shredded mix. I omitted the celery and carrots, and just left the onions chopped. Wow, I'm really wanting some more right now. How did it go so quickly?! Everyone at the dinner table said it was awesome, and they all said it was their favorite thing that they had tonight. This soup is now one of my little secrets. :)

Awesome recipe.  Doesn't reheat well-a must eat on the first day (reheating makes soup get clumpy).  Used a dark beer and had an excellent taste.  Served in large buns that were carved out.  Everyone loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding celery, and my family and I didn't like it at all. It had an odd, bitter taste.

I wanted to make this as much like the jack astors recipe as possible so I added a clove of garlic, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, a pinch of ground thyme and some extra water to make it less thick

Delicious! The best, most authentic beer cheese soup I've ever made. I omitted the celery and replaced the dry mustard with a couple squirts of yellow mustard. I will be making this again.

Also, it's great leftover IF you stir it while heating it through on the stove. This takes care of the  clumping problem that people have referred to.

It did turn out as the recipe says, but I personally did not like the beer and cheese combo, nor did my husband. However, this makes a great cheesy vegetable soup without the beer! =)

YUM!!!  I diced the carrots/onion/celery very small and didn't puree the soup -- we liked the texture of the vegetables.  The soup was very thick -- I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and ended up using another half a can to thin out the soup.  Served this with Guinness Bread (from this site) and beer margaritas -- yum!

I didn't like this recipe at all.  I'm sorry...I wish I did, but my wife and I both thought it was quite unpalatable.  I'm not a picky eater either...could have been the beer?  I used an English Ale...a waste of good beer.  I'm giving it 2 stars only because it smelled good.

I liked this a lot but have a few suggestions/ observations.  I think this could benefit from a little less flour and a little more chicken broth.  I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic along with a few dashes of hot sauce and dijon mustard for some more zip.    
I served mine in soup crocks with some popcorn on top.  For the folks who don't like the bitterness, perhaps a lite beer and/or mild cheddar?  Darker beer works better with a sharp cheddar.  Personally, I like mine a little hoppy so a Pale Ale worked just fine.

I thought that this was wonderful, but my husband did not like it at all.  Don't think that it was the recipe.  I think that he just doesn't care for beer cheese soup.  Probably won't make it again, however.

Delicious! Rich and creamy = exactly what I was looking for to fulfill my craving. Plus it couldn't have been any easier to make. My changes: I went with suggestions from others and ended up using 2 cans of broth, I only had mild cheddar so I used that instead of the varieties, didn't blend it, and used about half a bottle of hefe-weizen (if I used more it would've been TOO beer-y, but then I'm not much of a beer fan). Served it with Il Fornaio frozen rolls. Perfect soup for a cozy fall day, look forward to making it again. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

My husband was very leery when I told him I was making Beer Cheese Soup and I really worried about the kids, but everyone loved it.  I bought a hard bread and we dipped it more like fondue which someone else mentioned and I also added the nutmeg, but very good soup! I'll be making it again for sure!

Wow, this soup is so yummy! My husband and I moaned and groaned our whole way through the meal. It was thick and tasty and absolutely delicious. I served it with crusty french bread, broccoli with garlic, and smoked salmon on the side. This is now one of my favorite soups! Thanks for the recipe!

I gave it 4 stars because I used aged cheddar cheese. This gave it a stronger flavor which my family did not like. I will try it again with something like kraft cheddar to see if that is a milder flavor. This is a good way to get a little veggies in them without knowing!

made soup exactly has written to rate. I found the recipe was way too thick with 3/4 cup of flour. It  also needed more zip or spice for me, I found it rather bland. It think that is you used less flour and and maybe some Worcestershire sauce or maybe some pepper jack cheese??? I dunno something for some spice. I did however like the use of three cheeses.

This was pretty good- different than other soups I've had before. It was good w/ bread and salad.

I followed the recipe for everything except the cheese and I subbed the listed cheeses for a cheddar and jack four cheese prepackaged mix that I had on hand.  I am minimally skilled in the kitchen (putting it nicely) and it turned out great! I did add some fresh green onions when serving and we had french bread to dip!

Made this with some additional garlic and used homemade vegetable stock instead of canned chicken.  Turned out AWESOME.  Love this soup.  Thanks!

This recipe would be good for fondue cheese, but with a little tweeking, adding more beer, chicken broth, adn butter milk, gets it to a soupy consistancy. I also added Real Bacon pieces into it with the onions, carrots, and broccoli. delicious!

This is a super easy and super yummy recipe. The best part is the ingredients are things you always have on hand. I followed the other reviews and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, left out the veggies, and added 1/2 c milk. I liked it a little thicker.

I agree with an earlier post that this was too thick to be a soup. I added an additional can of chicken stock.  Also, there was a bizarre flavor in this soup that just didn't taste right. I would recommend that you use a regular, light beer. I used an ale. I wouldn't make this again.

Followed the recipe as it is, unfortunately it wasn't our favorite. We have a local restaurant w/ a really good beer cheese soup that we were hoping to make at home. I'll keep looking...we live in WI where there are a lot of beer cheese soups that are super. Thanks for giving us a starting point though and as you can see many love it.

It was good, but needed a little spice.  I added salt & pepper.  Next time I'll try a little worstershire as mentioned in another review.  It is worth noting, this soup is thick.  I added more chicken broth, but it was still thick.  Next time I'll use it as a fondue.

I'm sorry I gave this such a low rateing.  I think I did something wrong.  I did not alter the recipie and while it wasn't awful, it was far from what I was looking for.

I substituted 10 oz of shredded Tillamook Smoked Sharp Cheddar Cheese for the Cheddar and Monterrey Jack.  It was just the right amount of zing.  I think using an American type of beer, such as Miller Genuine Draft, will work better than fancy imports.  I think this recipe serves 4, not 8.

This was too thick as written....just add more broth!
My boys did not like it because of the strong taste. Not sure if it was the cheese or beer! BUT, that was the recipe...right? I liked it a lot. Just add more broth because it is rather thick.

I found this soup to be too salty which might be from using grated parmesan cheese ---would omit it or use shredded parmesan cheese.
Also think the veggies should be cooked for at least 15 minutes before adding the flour ---and was way too much flour called for.   Had a real mess thinning it out.   But will try it again with a few adjustments.

Thanks, I finally found a recipe for Beer cheese soup where the only cheese used was cheddar. I loved the blending of more than one cheese. I actually subsituted gruyere for the parm cheese gave it a nice blend of flavors!
