Being married to a man, who is 100% Italian, brings about challenges, when trying to find a "true" Italian recipe.  I have had these cookies at various family functions, and I have to say that this recipe is as close as it gets!  My mother-in-law actually thought that I purchased these from a local Italian market!  Excellent recipe, and VERY easy to make!

I needed to make something for a church social with an Italian theme.  These were easy and quick.  The look and taste great.  I doubled the recipe and used a small disher to measure them out.  Use a small shalow bowl to "roll" the tops in the powered surgar.  I am looking forward to trying them with lemon juice instead of the almond extract as a variant.

Easy to make and tastes great although no matter how I tried I could only get 36 cookies from the recipe not 48 as indicated.

I chose this recipe for Christmas cookies and rolled them in confectioners sugar.  They were a perfect compliment to my other more elaborate dessert (which was also easy to make) a chocolate trifle with hazelnut liqueur.   I think you could experiment with different flavored extracts, too.  I've made them twice and they are becoming a favorite.   Thank you!

These are really good, I expected a firmer, more dense cookie, but was pleasantly surprised at how light and airy these are.  To coat with the powdered sugar, I placed the sugar into a quart-size bag and tossed in two hot cookies at a time, gave a little shake, and took them out of the bag.  Perfectly powdered and no mess.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are very easy to make. I followed the recipe but was a bit more generous on the butter. I used one cup of butter. They were very light and moist. I read comments that talked about the cookies being dry. I experienced that by overbaking them by a couple of minutes. But the 10 minute cookies were light and soft. I didn't do the rolling in powdered sugar. Actually my family wouldn't wait long enough for me to do that. ?? 
But I did manage to try a bit of lemon glaze on a few and they were also very good.

These were a hit! Everyone loved these. They are easy to make and also quick to cook. Although mine were a little dry, they were still delicious. One thing is that i ran out of butter and so i had to substitute with oil, however they turned out the same so that was great. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for posting this

These cookies are nothing like the italian cookies I would get in NY at the bakeries.  They taste okay, a little on the dry side.  Will keep looking for a better recipe.

I thought this was a pretty simple recipe and it definately was! I loved the taste of the almond and thought it was going to taste too sweet with confectioners but I found them to be light and airy and definately worthy of an Italian cookie I remember from my youth. I would recommend doubling the recipe as this ony yielded 30 cookies for me.

These are one of the easiest, best Italian cookies I have ever made.  They are light and airy, and very good.  The almond flavour makes them unique and very tastsy.

These were good.  They were pretty easy to make but I just love sweet sweets.  These weren't too sweet so they weren't my kind of cookie.

I thought they were great.  I did not experience them being dry if yours are, you may have over cooked them.

These always go over great with everyone who has them, and the recipe provided is easy to double. 
Sometimes if the oven is too hot or if I take too long to shape the dough and it warms up too much, the cookies come out flat. If you're particular about the shape of the cookies it might help to briefly refrigerate the dough before putting it in the oven, or letting the cookies bake longer on a lower temperature.

These cookies are brilliant!!! They're so simple to make and they are so delicious! Personally, i decided that it would be better to sift the powdered sugar over the cookies instead of rolling them in it. They were awesome and i will totally be making them again! :)
