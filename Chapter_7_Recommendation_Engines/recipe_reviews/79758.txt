I made these 2 different ways since I thought maybe the baking soda was a misprint and it was meant to say baking powder? The soda ones didn't come out nearly as good as the powder ones. The soda pancakes were flat yet okay tasting and the powder cakes were tastier, fluffier and better looking. I'll make them again but I'd do it with the baking powder for sure.

These pancakes turned out so delicious, we've decided to make them a tradition/treat for Sunday morning breakfast.  I'd choose these pancakes over any made from a boxed mix or at a restaurant.  I don't keep WW pastery flour so I just use regular WW or sometimes white WW.  I've made it with both regular eggs and just egg whites and discovered that while the original recipe is good and fluffy, the pancakes are a bit lighter when I use only egg whites.  If you run out of buttermilk, this substitute works in a pinch: measure 2 Tbsp lemon into a large measuring glass, add enough milk to make it 2 cups, and let it sit for 5 min before using.

I don't know why people rate a recipe when they've changed every ingredient in it except one.  That being said, I almost walked away from this recipe because I didn't have ww pastry flour.  I only had regular ww.  After reading the reviews, I decided to just use what I had and these pancakes turned out beautifully!  They are really fluffy, and full of substance.  My kids each at 2 - a bit hit!  Thank you for this recipe.  I'll definitely be using it again.

I used flax seed instead of the eggs. 1 T. ground flax + 3 T. water replaces one egg. More healthy! Thanks for the recipe!

Nice recipe Kaykwilts!!!  Tried it with both the wheat germ and without and both ways it is good.  Very light, fluffy and yet extremely healthy.  (P.S.  I also tried it with regular whole wheat flour instead of the pastry, trust me people, you NEED to get the pastry flour--it makes all the difference).

(Little add-ins & substitutions to suit my particular needs/preferences:  added 2 tbs Splenda and 1 scoop of unflavored Whey Protein powder to get the protein/carb/fat ratios I need for my BFFM diet.)  

Who would have thought I could have pancakes on my diet?  
Absolutely sensational.  Thanks again KayKwilts.

My family loves, loves, loves these pancakes.  I did substitute a few things because I didn't have a few ingred. on hand...but they turned out awesome!!!  I did substitute oil w/ applesauce. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used 1 cup blueberry yogurt and 1 cup vanilla yogurt!  These are to die for!!!  My 2 year old eats 2-3 pancakes, and he was not a fan of pancakes before this recipe!  FIVE STARS!!!

I liked this recipe but one time, on accident I left out the oil and they came out even better, more fluffy (and I saved calories). My brother requests these every Saturday.

Fluffy, clean-tasting delicious pancakes! I used ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ and 1/2 c yogurt + 1 1/2 c milk for buttermilk and my parents loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is wonderful!!! As a college student, I need foods that are quick and easy, and this definitely fit the bill. I will make this again, without a doubt. For taste, I added vanilla and cinnamon. As an alternative for syrup, mix a little cool whip with strawberry preserves and top with fresh strawberries - it looks great and is delicious!

These were really good.  I have a houseful of kids here and they scarfed them up.  I even forgot the salt and they were still gobbled up.  I think next time I would maybe a tablespoon of sugar...otherwise, awesome.  I used regular wheat flour and nonfat buttermilk and they came out light and fluffy.

These are a good healthy alternative to buttermilk pancakes made with white flour. However, the batter seemed very thick so I added a little more milk. They are not a fluffy pancake, which is why I didn't give them 5 stars.

This was pretty good, although I don't always have fresh-ground whole wheat pastry flour on hand (it goes rancid quickly). I discovered I could grind oatmeal in my small electric coffee grinder, to get an alternative whole grain flour. I also tried separating the egg whites out; if you whip them first, the pancakes are extra light!

This recipe has the most "normal" pancake texture of any whole wheat recipe that I've tried.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and baking powder for the soda, and I added some cinnamon and vanilla for flavor.

I have made this recipe twice and twice I have been very pleased.  The whole family loved them!  Initially I was worried becouse the batter seemed very runny to me but they cooked up great.  I also didn't use whole wheat pastry flour either time but my own finely ground wheat flour.  The second time the batter seemed runny again.  I cooked the first round anyways, they turned out fine, but then I started changing things.  I added 1/4 tsp baking powder, approx 1/4-1/2 cup more whole wheat flour and about 1/4 cup of honey.  They were delicious!  Thanks for a great whole wheat recipe!

5 Stars, but, use 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda. I don't think anyone needs to be told that you can add stuff to pancakes. I like to use: TJs Toasted Pecan bits, coconut flakes, and 1/2 C dried blueberries soaked overnight in 1-2 Tbs. milk. Or a Banana cut up, w/ coconut flakes and macadamia nuts.

Not a huge hit with my kids, but I loved them. But since it didn't appeal to everyone, I had to give it 4 stars intead of 5. It has a very strong wheat flavor - if you like that, this is for you!

These pancakes were very good...moist and healthy.  Great for my 2 year old son...I used baking powder instead of soda and oat bran instead of wheat germ.  Very good overall...

These pancakes are incredible.  I didn't have pastry flour, so I used regular Whole Wheat flour.  They still turned out incredible!  I mixed all the wet ingredients in one bowl, all the dry ingredients in another bowl, then combined the two, mixed lightly and started cooking the cakes.  They were light and airy.  Very nice.

My whole family loved these pancakes. They are very light and fluffy with a hearty wheat flavor. My only complaint is they were very oily. I would try reducing the oil or leaving it out. Worth experimenting a little. One more thing ~ this recipe made double for me over what it states in the recipe.

These were the worst pancakes I've ever made. I added frozen blueberries, so I don't know if that mattered, but you could really taste the wheat germ.

Surprisingly fluffy for whole wheat pancakes.  Very nice flavor and texture.  Came out better than a whole grain pancake mix I had been using.  I added 2 Tbl of sugar as others suggested.  Might try adding the vanilla next time.  Definitely a keeper!

ETA:  I'm changing my review of this recipe from 4 to 5 stars after adding just one additional ingredient: water.  I added about 1/4 cup of water to thin out the batter and help with the lumps (I used whole wheat flour.)  It helped significantly as the batter spread better which meant it cooked faster and more thoroughly compared to before when I was probably overcooking to make sure that it was cooked all the way through.  My 4-year old use to complain that my pancakes didn't taste like IHOP and were burnt, but she gobbled them up after this one addition.  This will be my go to recipe for pancakes from now on.

I have tested many recipes from this site and this is the first I reviewed because it is THE BEST recipe I've tried to date. The pancakes were light and fluffy and very tasty. I'm trying to eat healthier and this fit in with my plan. I switched to whole wheat pastry flour for most of my baking and it's a definite "MUST" for this recipe. I froze the left over pancakes and ate a couple this morning after microwaving them for a minute with EXCELLENT results. A GREAT recipe, thanks for sharing.

My dad and I loved these pancakes because of the unique flavor, and we would both give them five stars. However, my husband and mom did not like them at all. They thought they tasted like health food and not like a "regular" pancake at all. They could really taste the whole wheat and wheat germ. So, I compromised and gave the recipe three stars.

These were really good pancakes, I used 2% milk instead of buttermilk and they turned out great!

Thank you SO much for this recipe!  They are so light and fluffy.  Now I can enjoy one of my comfort foods without feeling so guilty.  I made just half a batch and it was the perfect amount for just my husband and myself.  I used half applesauce for the oil and used half baking powder, rather than the full amount of baking soda.  But I'm sure if you follow the recipe to the "T" you'll have fabulous results too.  We won't eat another white flour pancake again!

Loved them. Fluffy, moist, not dense and flat like other whole wheat pancake recipes I've tried. Full of flavor, almost nutty. I didn't have wheat germ on hand so I used wheat bran and they turned out great. The wheat bran gives it a chewy texture that I liked. It's my go to whole wheat pancake recipe now.

I couldn't believe it, these were actually light and fluffy.  My three year old ate them up and I liked them as well.  They were very filling, too.  I followed the recipe exactly as it is except I used safflower oil instead of canola oil (it was all I had and is better for you) and only added a tablespoon or two.  They were plenty moist.  I did add a tablespoon of sugar and they were sweet, but that may not have been necessary.

If you're having trouble getting them fluffy, I would say it's all about not overmixing it.  Use a wooden spoon, not a whisk.  I mixed it until it was just moist.  There were a lot of lumps.  Just look for big pockets of flour before you scoop it up and break them up.  Also, I've heard this before, but the last couple ones I made were the best.  I think letting the batter sit for a few minutes before making them would help.

These are outstanding. I do not readily have wheat germ on hand, so I always make it with 2 c. whole wheat flour. My family loves them.

I would probably give these 3.5 stars.  They taste just like a normal pancake, but the texture is a little different.  The batter was a lot thicker then I expected and I tried to thin it out a bit with a couple of tbs of buttermilk, but it really did not work.  You do need to cook these slow and low because of the thickness other wise they will be raw in the center.  Not sure if I will make these again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Tasty. However, the batter was very thin for me; I had to add more flour to it. They didn't fluff up very high, but that's a minor complaint.

My seven-year-old daughter eats only home-made pancakes and crapes. I used white flour and wheat germ. I thought the texture might be too coarse if I use whole wheat flour. She ate these pancakes without complaining!

These are very good, my only comment would be that the wheat germ has a bit of a gritty aftertaste.  We did not have buttermilk so we used 2 TB lemon juice and filled to 2 cups with half and half, could also use milk to do this.  We also added a mashed banana to the batter.  Next time I will cut in half as this was too many pancakes for 3 people.

We like healthy pancakes, and these were beautiful!  Light and fluffy...they have a wonderful look and texture.  Unfortunately, the bitter baking-soda flavor was too much for me.  The kids ate them fine, the hubby was able to make himself eat a few, but I couldn't even finish the only one I tried.  I'm sure there are ways to remedy this, but I won't be taking the time.  We have a large family and I doubled the recipe - and between the wheat germ and buttermilk, it was an expensive experience that turned out badly.

Even though this is a pancake recipes, I used it to make waffles, and boy did it make some good waffles! Instead of using 2 tsp. of baking soda, I used 1 tsp. of baking soda and 1 tsp. of baking powder. I used 1/2 a cup of cake flour in place of 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour. I also put about 1 tbsp. of agave syrup into the batter. The added sweetiness in the batter made maple syrup unnecessary (although I still used a little).

This recipe was ok, but I did not think it deserved the rave reviews that I read about it.  Hungry Jack pakcakes out of a box are lighter, fluffier, and tastier.  I will probably make these again because they are healthy and good for you, but they have that "health food" taste that left out taste buds lingering for something better.  I like healthy food that taste good, too.  This was not it.

I took a reviewer's advice and substituted baking powder for the soda and they came out flat. No one in my family liked them.  I don't think I will try again with the soda, though, since I don't want to run the risk of ruining everyone's Sat. morning breakfast again!

We eat pancakes ("Good Old Fashioned Pancakes" from this website - amazing!!) about once a week at my house, and I wanted to try to find a healthier version. These are fantastic!!

I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour, so I was a little apprehensive about using regular ww. I sifted all the dry ingredients together, added two packets of Splenda, and then added them to the wet ingredients. Then I added a splash of pure vanilla extract. I also added an extra tablespoon of canola oil (since I used ww flour). I immediately made two pancakes and they were delicious, but a little grainy. After letting the batter sit for about five minutes I made another one and it was much softer and absolutely amazing.

I make homemade buttermilk pancakes (with white flour) for my family every week and decided to try these to make them a little healthier.  These were VERY good.  I used whole wheat flour and I added 1.5 tbl sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. I will definitely make these each week from now on.  My husband said that they did taste a little "different" but that they were good and my daughter (3.5) didnt notice anything different.  I feel much better that I am able to make them healthier for them.

To kick up the fiber I added 2 Tbsp ground flax seeds, 1 cup quick oats and reduced the wheat germ to 1/4 cup.  Also added 1tsp vanilla.  My kids love them.  There even good toasted out of the freezer.

We give these 5 stars for easy and healthy and good!! I had no wheat germ but had my heart set on these so substituted more ww flour for that. Then used applesauce instead of oil. No sugar really needed. added blueberries to half and made blueberry sauce from this site for topping. Very tasty. Made all of us happy. Thanks

Wonderful recipe!  The first time I've made whole-wheat pancakes and they weren't heavy and dense.  I think the secret to making them light and fluffy is the buttermilk.  I used a pint of low-fat buttermilk, and it was just short of 2 cups, so I used 1% milk to make up the difference.  I followed the recipe exactly, and added two teaspoons of ground flax to the mix.  Then added a handful of frozen blueberries to each pancake after I poured it onto the griddle.  My only regret is that I didn't have the real maple syrup to pour on it... only the fake stuff.  I will be prepared next time!  Thank you for a truly wonderful recipe.

My favorite pancake recipe for 8 years has now been topped. I don't know whether to be happy or sad! This recipe is fluffy yet hearty. I feel healthy eating it and it has no sugar! It tastes perfect. We top it with yogurt and honey.

These were great! We used the batter to make Belgian waffles. They take a little longer to cook this way. Next time, I will use a lower temperature so the outside doesn't cook way faster than the center. I loved that they were crispy on the outside and that they were much healthier than boxed pancake mix.

While this recipe did not disappoint, I felt it had a very "eggy" quality to it--almost like french toast...which is not to say that is a bad thing, just something I noticed. I would also use less salt next time as I don't think it needed as much due to the amount of baking soda used. My reciped yielded 18 silver dollar sized pancakes which was more than I anticipated. I will try freezing a few once they cool to see how they do. This recipe deserves 5 stars for the best whole-wheat pancake recipe I've come across by far. Thanks for sharing this!

Very good! I used 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda as recommended by another reviewer, and our pancakes were light and fluffy. They are not sweet at all, but we loved them. They were a big hit with the kids!

Halved the recipe.  Did not have wheat germ on hand so increased flour to almost a full cup.  Added a tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients and a few shakes of cinnamon to the dry ingredients which made the pancakes very flavorfull without needing as much syrup.  Pancakes came out super fluffy and wonderful!

For being healthier pancakes without sugar, these are pretty good. I also used a ground flax seed and water mixture instead of eggs. I don't eat them. Worked just fine.

These were the best pancakes I have ever made.  I even let the left over batter sit in the fridge and it held up just fine.  We topped with fruit topping (blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, fresh pineapple and lemon juice just heated up until the berries are all juicy).  My ten year old and breakfast hating boyfriend liked them.  I will be making often.  If you don’t have Whole Wheat pastry flour you should get some.  It makes them lighter.  You can buy it online.

These pancakes were wonderful and so much better for you than store mixes. I don't think I'll ever buy a box mix again! The only thing I didn't have on hand was w.w. pastry flour, so I just used regular. Just love them!

I followed the recipe but substituted ground flax seeds instead of the wheat germ. Turned out wonderful. Liked the consistency and taste for a healthy pancake. Added cinnamon and agave for a topping. So glad I found this recipe. 
Thank you- will definitely make again!!!

These were wonderful... we also ground up a 1/4 cup flax seed to add a little bit more nuttiness, as well as spiced oats, a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon, and a splash of vanilla. Butter on the pan gave these a wonderful crust on the outside. One of the top recipes in our pancake repitoire!

These have a great flavor!  I have made these twice, both with regular whole wheat flour because I didn't have pastry flour.  The first time I used apple cider vinegar to make my own buttermilk and the second time I used lemon juice.  I thought the cider vinegar gave it a nicer flavor, so I will just use that next time also!

I love pancakes and I loved these. So often, whole wheat pancakes are like lead, but these were fluffy and light, but very filling. In place of the buttermilk I used whole milk plain yogurt with some regular milk to thin it down.

I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour and I'm sure that affected my outcome in a positive way, because we found these to be tasty, though dry. Do not substitute baking powder for baking soda; you can ADD it but do not eliminate the soda entirely, because the buttermilk uses the soda as a leavener. This batter was bizarre; it foamed on top but was runny and weird unless I kept mixing it, which you're really not supposed to do with buttermilk pancakes, but that's what I had to do. I suspect it needed more flour or wheat germ and would increase the flour by 1/4 cup in the future. I could not taste the wheat germ, which is perfectly fine by me. I served these with AR's "Sauteed Apples" on top in place of syrup and butter. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  No sugar-what?  I don't even know how these are so delicious but they are.  My husband, 3 year old and baby love them.  I didn't have pastry flour but they were great with reg whole wheat.  They were so thick for some reason I kind of tried to spread them out with the measuring cup so they wouldn't be doughy in the middle, but I didn't smash them down.  I still can't believe my husband loved these.  Wow.

I liked this overall recipe.  I changed quite a few things.  I used egg whites, apple sauce, club soda, and old fashioned oats instead of wheat germ since I don't own any.  I cut this recipe down since I just made for myself.  Also, I added 1 tsp. of Vanilla, a dash of cinnamon, and a little bit of splenda (I honestly didn't measure it, I just sprinkled it in after I had a pancake to add some sweetness).  I still could taste some baking soda in there.  I don't know how to shake the taste, but I'll figure it out in the next batch.  This is a keeper for me. :)

Made these this morning with a couple of small changes:  I used 3T flaxseed meal and 3T of oil, plus I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  They were perfect with some cooked apples spooned over the top.

Fantastic pancakes!  I followed a lot of advice from reviewers since I didn't have a lot of the ingredients on hand.  I substituted applesauce (made from just pureed apples) for the oil, yoplait light strawberry banana yogurt for the buttermilk (you can't taste the yogurt flavor in the pancakes), whole wheat flour for the whole wheat pastry flour, and I left out the wheat germ.  I also added a little splenda.  It was a very filling breakfast and I will definitely make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wish I would have followed the advice of other people and not tried these pancakes.  These were a pain in the neck to cook.  They took 2x as long to cook as regular pancakes.  The taste was terrible.

Excellant recipe! Loved it not only for the whole wheat (used regular whole wheat flour and it was fine) and wheat germ but because too it is sugar-free. These were perfect with a little maple syrup which is all the sweetness they need. I had no problems with it rising up to a fluffy delicious pancake. Anyone who may be complaining about them not rising may be using old baking soda. As with any pancake batter let it sit a few minutes to give the rising agents time to activate. I did add 2 t. of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. These are now my "go-to" pancake recipe. Even my husband who is not a pancake eater liked these because of their wholesomeness. Extra pancakes keep well in the refridgerator or can be frozen. When ready to use heat briefly in microwave.

This is between a 4 and a 5 for me.  I kind of ruined the healthiness of it by drenching them in the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup from this site.  These will be a good alternative with Oatmeal Pancakes II.  I love the nutiness that the wheat germ gives these.

These are the best!  I often add 1/2 cup of pureed pumpkin with a teaspoon or so of cinnamon or a large mashed up ripe banana and the kids devour them.  They are fluffly, tasty and best of all healthy.  I always feel good serving them to my family.

This is the nearly identical to the recipe I've used for years.  My kids have grown up on it and don't like "plain white flour" pancakes!  I do half the flour with white flour and add 2 tsp of baking powder (as well as use the baking soda).  I find 1/4 cup of brown sugar helps them to be good enough not to have to use a lot of sweet toppings.  Lots of times they eat them plain or with PB&J for a snack!

This is the best 100% whole wheat pancake recipe I have tried! I made it exactly as the recipe said the first time and they turned out great.  To make them even healthier the last couple of times I have made them I substitued 1/2 cup of thick applesauce for the oil and used one whole egg and two egg whites. They turned out very good as well. I started adding vanilla and cinnamon as well which makes them even better! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I've never made pancakes from scratch.  They were better than anything I have ever made.  I substituted 1/2 the oil with 1/2 applesauce.  And I added 1 tsp baking powder to make extra fluffy.  Sooo good!  Can't wait to make them for my friends.  My baby loved them too.

I have another recipe that requires baking powder, so I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and used baking powder.  They were good, but didn't rise. I used white pastry flour, maybe that made the difference?

These were fantastic!  I followed the recipe as it was written but used regular WW flour instead of pastry flour.  The pancakes were light and fluffy - the recipe makes a lot.  When you mix up the batter it's  bit thicker than "regular" pancakes and while you're cooking them they don't bubble the way most pancakes do while cooking, so you have to keep an eye on the pancakes for the edge to dry so you know when to flip them.  
These pancakes were delicious - definitely going to make them again!


ETA:  I've made them a few times now -- Today I went to make them and didn't have the buttermilk, all i had was vanilla yogurt.  The pancakes were fantastic (altho I needed to add a splash of milk because the batter was extremely thick)  The vanilla yogurt made sweet enough to eat plain.  Yum!!

These pancakes are delicious, fluffy and tender.  I warmed the egg and buttermilk prior to mixing with the dry ingredients (the egg in a bowl of warm water and the buttermilk in a cup in a bowl of hot water).  Next time I'll use a little less salt.  I'll also try with baking powder instead of soda as one reviewer suggested.  Thanks for the wholesome pancake recipe, Kaykwilts!

Very good, and since I only changed about 3 of the ingredients, I think I can legitimately provide a review. :-)  I made these as waffles rather than pancakes and it worked out fine. 

Did not have ww pastry flour so used a combination of ww flour, rice flour and unbleached white flour (using all ww flour would likely make it too gluteny and ruin the texture).

Did not have buttermilk, used yogurt with a bit of water added, worked out fine.

added 1 T white sugar since the yogurt is really tart.

Per other reviews, I used 1 heaping teaspoon baking soda and 1 t baking powder and the waffles rose fine. Although some reviewers here used all baking powder in place of the bs, theoretically baking soda should be necessary to provide alkalinity to balance out the acidity of the buttermilk/yogurt. Hmm, chemistry has been thwarted...

I have made these twice. The first time I made them exactly as written and we found all we could taste was the baking soda, that's why they get a 3 rating. I really liked the idea of these pancakes, so I tried again today. This time I used a mashed banana instead of the oil and used baking powder instead of the soda. At the last minute I added in a teaspoon of cinnamon as well. Much better we all enjoyed them. Thanks for the great idea and starting point.

These pancakes are amazing!  This is now my standard for wheat pancakes.  I had no idea wheat pancakes could taste this good.  I will definitely make for company.  I grind my own wheat flour and I used that plus the germ.

Batter was a little thin, even after sitting.  But this is a keeper!  I was bummed to read that the wheat germ isn't healthy after it's heated.  So I added some nutricious yeast.

Great recipe. I did make one change - used regular whole wheat flour. These have become a staple in our house.

Yummy!  I'm a health nut and my live-in boyfriend is the kind of guy who puts 3 tsp of sugar in his coffee.  This is a recipe we could both agree on. I just added cinnimon and put fresh fruit all over mine...he put like a cup of syrup.  Hey, at least I got something healthy in him!

Great pancakes!  I added a bit more flour b/c they were a little runny.  We've already made them 2x since I got the recipe 10 days ago.  These are very healthy and you can feel good after you eat them.  Per other reviews suggestions, I also added some cinnamon and sugar.

Excellent.  Used WW flour, applesauce for oil, LACTAID, and omitted wheat germ and salt because I didn't have any on hand.  Added one tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinammon, folded in chopped strawberries, and added 1/8 cup of splenda to sweeten them up.  YUM!

Excellent recipe! I made a few adjustments; Used unsweetened applesauce in place of the canola then added 1 TBSP Canola, used 1/4 tsp salt, which was plenty, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour, so I used half whole wheat and 1/2 white flour. I did also whip my whites (but still added the yolks). These pancakes were so light, airy and NOT greasy! Next time, I will try excluding the oil completely and the yolks and use a little more whole wheat flour than I did this time. My kids (2 & 4) ate them up---no syrup required!!! Thanks for a great one!

i have never felt the need to leave a review till now. These pancakes are so easy and yummy the recipie must have came from heaven. I used whole wheat flour instead of the wheat pastry flour. Made my own low fat butter milk and used melted margarine instread of oil and my 2 year old begged for more. I was full off of one and i am normally a very hungry person!!!!!

These are surprisingly good even with a few other changes.  I like to incorporate flax in most of my recipes and substituted it for about half of the oil.  I also used plain whole wheat flour and not the pastry flour.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon also.  These are very good even as leftovers which I can't say for some of the other pancake recipes on this site.  We have made these several times already and will continue for many breakfasts, lunches and dinners to come!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I had no eggs so instead I threw in a banana and a 1/4 tsp of baking powder as a substitute.  I don't know how the original recipe is, but the pancakes with my modifications were amazing!  Not one crumb was left on any of the plates.  The banana flavor was a very nice touch.  I'll definitely be making these healthy tastey breakfast treats again!!

These were easy to make and I thought they tasted good.  I liked them a best with honey on top.  My husband thought they were okay, but prefers our "usual" pancake recipe, which is the Fluffy Pancakes recipe from this site.  I like that one a little better too, but this was still good and used up some wheat germ I had in the fridge.  I made this recipe as directed except I had to use regular whole wheat flour instead of whole wheat pastry flour.

World's most pickiest son turned his nose at first sight, one taste, gobbled it up! I ground up flax seed for I didn't have wg. I wasn't sure how it would be with no sugar in the recipe, but it was a hit in this household!

For what they are, I'd say they're pretty good.  It doesn't replace a white flour pancake for me, but it definitely satisfies the craving when you're watching what you eat.  I drizzle these with honey instead of topping with butter and maple syrup.

Absolutely yummy! I was worried about it feeding my whole family so I changed the servings to 18 instead of 12 and I got 12 good sized pancakes out of my batter so it was perfect. Didn't use pastry flour because I don't have any, used apple sauce for about a third of what it called for in oil then a bit of oil (1/4 cup apple sauce/2 Tbs oil because I changed the serving size). I also added some ground flax seed and a bit of non-fat milk to make the batter just a little thinner, didn't over mix, let it rest about 10 min and when I put the batter in the pan I used the ladle to spread the batter out so they wouldn't be so thick. I think that helped. These turned out so fluffy, moist, and light...even my 16 year old son ate two!

Great recipe exactly as it is.  I use the powdered buttermilk and add blueberries or bananas sometimes.

I truly think this is THE BEST healthy pancake recipe out there. I made a few minor changes: 1) used half wheat germ and half flaxseed meal, 2) subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil, 3) subbed baking powder for baking soda, as one reviewer suggested, 4) used regular whole wheat flour instead of ww pastry flour, and 5) added a dash of cinnamon. These are so light and fluffy and beautiful and tasty -- you'd never guess they were so healthy!

Great taste but I have never gotten them to be light and fluffy and I have made these numerous times.  Even so, we love these and they are part of our Saturday morning breakfast.

This has become my standard pancake recipe. Even family members who wouldn't eat them if they knew they contained wheat germ and whole wheat flour thought they were great.  I double (or triple) the recipe and mix all the dry ingredients ( using buttermilk powder instead of buttermilk) together ahead of time and keep the mix in the fridge.  Only having to add the wet ingredients at breakfast time makes this just as easy as a store bought mix, but healthier and better tasting.  (I use much less oil than the recipe calls for -- probably only a couple teaspoons. I tried it the first time with the recommended oil and the pancakes were way too "moist" and greasy.)

My children are pancake fanatics.  They are used to the regular homemade version that I make all the time.  I wanted to a healthier way to make their favorite food but I had serious doubts about whether or not they would enjoy the change in their favorite with their finely tuned pancake taste :p but they loved these!  AND I loved knowing that I was giving them something they loved that was healthy.  From now on THIS will be my usual pancake recipe.  :)  THANKS!

I followed the recipe except for the baking soda, I thought it might have been a misprint so I used baking powder.  The recipe is pretty close to the one I already use except using the whole wheat pastry flour and wheat germ.  I did cut back the amount of oil and added a little melted butter instead of the 1/4 cup canola oil.  The pancakes came out fluffy and tasty but you have to get used to eating whole wheat pancakes instead of regular all purpose flour pancakes.

Whiel I don't care for these pancakes so much, I rated it 5 stars because my husband, who never eats pancakes, as well as my 8 year old stepson think this recipe rocks!  Thanks for putting a healthy twist on a breakfast staple.

I used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and added dried cranberries to give it a real antioxident power punch...Topped with real maple syrup or unsweetened apple sauce....

These had NO flavor, the batter was way too runny & cooked into flat pancakes. I ended up adding 1T. sugar. I'd rather just add some wheat germ to the Truck-Stop Buttermilk pancake recipe. Those are heavenly!!!

I thought these were okay after swapping vanilla almond milk for the buttermilk, adding sliced almonds, and a bit of cinnamon. I thought it was decent with agave nectar as a syrup. No one else could even stand these, though, and they're health food nuts! I won't be using this recipe ever again, but it's always nice to try new things.

Absolutely delicious! I did everything like it said except for the dry ingredients, where I used 1/4c flax, 1/4c wheat germ, 1c all purpose flour and 1/2 cup stoneground whole wheat, in addition to the salt and baking soda. My son loved these. I also crumbled some pecans into a few and some frozen blueberries. Delicious!

I made these this morning for my boys, ages 4 & 1 and they were a hit! Love the whole wheat pastry flour- it made them come out light and fluffy, not as heavy as regular whole wheat flour. I'm not one to alter a recipe since I'm a new cook, but I did substitute applesauce for the oil and mashed up a banana to add to the batter. They were moist and declious! Topped them off with vanilla agave - yum! I've tried other recipes for pancakes and they always seem to come out too chewy or dry. This was perfect!

I halfed this but still used 2 full egg whites, reg whole wheat flour, sprinkle of Splenda and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. MMMMMM my two year old ate three full pancakes. They were light and fluffy and plain delicious. This is a breakfast that I was happy to serve to my family. I'm going to try and cut down on the oil and see what happens. Thanx for sharing.

Light and fluffy but absolutely no flavour.  I added a Tbsp of sugar because it seemed to be missing and separated the eggs (beat the whites and fold them in at the end) but otherwise followed the recipe.  I'll try them one more time but add vanilla and some orange or lemon zest to perk them up.

I just made a batch of these - so so yummy.  I am going to own up right now though - I messed up!  I totally forgot to add oil!!!  I am not missing it though.  This could be in part because I fried mine in a good dollop of coconut oil, which imparted the most delicious flavor, but maybe not.  Either way - gotta try these!

I usually don't like whole grain/wheat pancakes.  They always seem to fall apart and never seem to have a soft, fluffy texture, but these are excellent!  I just made them and they're really delicious, soft, fluffy, and not heavy.  Mine did just fine with baking soda, fwiw.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I don't agree with the reviewer's suggestion of substituting baking powder for the baking soda.  Using 2 tsp. of baking soda is the best and any substitution of ingredients changes the flavor (believe me, i've tried them all).  What I like most about this recipe is that the leftover pancakes are wonderful- not too dry or spongy.  The only thing I ever change is adding chopped walnuts and blueberries to the mixture.  My toddler goes crazy for them!

These pancakes are really good!  We are not a "health food" family, but I'm trying to make meals with less white sugar and less white flour.  I thought we would give this a try and my family loved them.  We all agreed they were much more flavorful and filling than regular pancakes.  They reminded me of the yummy refrigerator bran muffins people used to make.  I did add about a T. of sugar and a t. of vanilla.

WOW!  Impressive!  I used Whole Foods Organic whole wheat flour because that's what I had on hand.  Other than that, I made them exactly as the recipe stated, and they were superb--light and fluffy, with a wonderful whole grain taste!  After I put the first batch on the griddle, I realized there was no sugar in them, and I wondered if I had missed reading it on the recipe.  But no--no sugar, and we didn't miss it at all!

I got great reviews from the family. I didn't use whole wheat pastry flour because our super-grocery store didn't carry it. Substituted whole wheat flour, which I think made the pancakes more dense than I would have liked them to be. I made extra so that I could freeze them and re-heat them for breakfast the rest of the week. Overall, I will definitely make this recipe again.

I've made this a few times now, the most recent time I had to just use more flour since I didn't have the wheat germ.  Big compliments (one eater said they were the best pancakes he's had in recent memory).  This is now my favorite pancake recipe :)

This is my usual Saturday morning breakfast. I've learned to adapt the recipe for 2 people. I pre-measure the dry ingredients into various containers, and when I'm ready to cook, just add the wet ingredients. I use white flour, plus add 1 tsp of splenda to about 1/4 of the recipe. Best pancakes ever!

These pancakes were delicious and quite quick and easy to make! I used regular whole wheat flour because my store didn't have the pastry flour. Also, I like my pancakes sweet so I added 1/4 cup of Splenda.

My family came to visit and I made these. My brother who is the pickiest eater I know said these were the BEST pancakes he ever had. My husband agreed with him. I toast the wheat germ in the oven for about 1o mins. The second time I made these I made a full recipe plus half. I added 2 bananas and 1/2 cup or so of chopped pecans. I just smooshed the bananas to a pulp and threw in the nuts. They were out of this world. Love them...Thanks for the recipe.

I enjoyed these pancakes, however I did make two changes.  The batter was way too thick, so I added some milk to thin it out.  I made one pancake and tasted it and decided it needed some vanilla for flavor.  They turned out nice and fluffy.  My son loved them with syrup and fruit on top.  I thought they tasted great with wild Maine blueberry syrup on top.

okay... first, my "variations"
I followed one reviewer who substituted ground flax seed for the wheat germ (not having any) and 1/2 c yogurt plus 1.5 c milk for the buttermilk.  also no canola, used coconut oil.  I think I will go add 1 t of vanilla as some have suggested - I did that.

in conclusion: these were yummy; the kids really liked them (I did add some choc chips to theirs - always helpful when trying a new recipe)  I found them rather dry, but tasty.  Dunno if I will make them again.

Although these were good and healthy, they were a little bland for my liking.  Next time I will try these with fruit and adding a little splenda!

Very nice-light and fluffy-pretty amazing for a whole wheat pancake! I found it is best to let the batter sit a few minutes before frying, and it really is important to make them the 1/4 c. size, and not larger-they kinda fall apart at a larger size.

I didn't have wheat germ, but followed everything else exactly. These were the best wheat pancakes we've ever had.  The consistency was just like white flour, and my 4 year old picky eater finished them off (unlike any other wheat pancake recipe I've tried).

I would def, give this 5 stars but I altered a bit by using applesauce and skim milk, and 1 tbl. brown sugar plus I added a tbl. of flax seed and I was in such a rush I completely forgot the eggs!! But they came out beautifully, very dense and filling....thick batter that needs to be spread out, next time I will try with the eggs (or egg whites) LOL...thanks for a healthy alternative =)

Fabulous!  I made these pancakes exactly as the recipe is written, and they were so delicious.  The wheat germ gives them a nutty flavor.  My husband even loved them.  Next time I will try subbing the canola oil with applesauce to make them even more healthier.

I looove pancakes. However, they aren't exactly healthy. These were PERFECT. A great way to start your day and get a lot of good vitamins and nutrients. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I didnt have WW pastry flour so i just used reg WW flour. I used applesauce instead of oil. And I added a bout a tsp of flaxseed. They were very fluffy. They expand A LOT while cooking. So don't make them too large. I will def. be making these again!

This was surprisingly good. I had to look twice to see that the recipe called for no sugar, yet it tasted sweet in its own way. Granted, I added about 2 tablespoons of strawberry yogurt but that couldn't have added too much sugar. Also I used margarine since I didn't have oil. I will make these every time!

We're spoiled by another whole wheat pancake recipe, but for this one not having any white flour, it was very good in that aspect.  I did do a few things different.  Used applesauce in place of canola oil, plus a tablespoon of melted butter.  Omitted the salt.  Used baking powder instead of the soda.  Only had regular WWF, so didn't use the pastry WWF.  Added vanilla.  And after already pouring half the mix on the skillet, I decided the batter tasted bland, so I added a small spoonful of sugar over the top of the pancakes.  I'm glad I did!  However, I made sure I didn't do that to one pancake, so I'd know how the recipe itself really tasted without it.  Of course, the sugar is better.  :) For those getting flat pancakes, be sure to remember that there is a difference between pastry WWF and regular.  Pastry has a lower gluten content with higher starch.  This makes a difference in what kind of recipe you're cooking up and its rise.  Not to mention, wheat does not rise like white flour anyways.  So perhaps you're used to that.  Plus, the flour itself is more soft than regular, making for a tastier pastry (pancake in this case).  So keep that in mind if you end up using regular, because the pastry DOES make it taste and cook up better.  :)

This is one of our favorite pancake recipes.  We use this recipe to make many variations such as blueberry, chocolate chip, banana, and pecan, and I always add some cinnamon to the recipe.  Really makes a difference in a good way!

Very very light, fluffy and delicious even using regular wheat flour.  Next time I make these (maybe next weekend), I am going to substitute apple sauce for the very small amount of oil.  I'll probably try a second batch with egg whites.

After cooking a few I threw out the rest of the batter and did not serve them to my kids.
The texture was gummy and not fluffy at all.

These were pretty good.  I added sugar, vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers.  The problem I had was that they came out really flat.  I mean they did not rise at all.  My husband snickered and said "Well, you've heard the expression 'flat as a pancake, haven't you?'".  We liked them, but I think next time I may use baking powder instead of soda.  Thanks for the post.

I did some major changes to this recipe but it makes the very best pancakes we have eaten. I used 1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup unbleached flour. I added 1 cup of whole oats. I cut the wheat germ down to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup flax seeds, or you could use ground flax. I added 2 tsp. vanilla, well actually, I just pour it in, 2 - 3  Tb. sugar depending on the fruit I am adding and cinnamon to taste. For fruit, I have used huckleberries, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, peaches or apples. Any one of these fruits taste great in the pancakes. You could put in pecans, but my husband doesn't like nuts in his pancakes. Two of these are very filling, and they make great snacks even cold, on a long drive to work.

I love this recipe because there are so few ingredients. It tastes great and right now it's my favorite pancake recipe. Maybe it's the high altitude, but the baking soda taste was a bit strong so I lowered it to between 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 tsp. perfection!

I'm not sure what it is I was looking for, but I'll have to say that these were just okay.  I'm sure I'll make them again for myself as I do like to cut back on calories and eat healthier when I can...but they're nothing I would make if I was cooking for someone else.

Sorry.

These were great!  Very light and not what you would expect when using whole wheat flour and wheat germ.  Served them with homemade blueberry syrup.  Thanks for a healthier recipe (that my husband will actually eat) to replace my white flour version.

Wonderful!  My family loved these light and fluffy pancapkes so much we're having them again this week.  Used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 cup ground oatmeal plus the wheat germ.

These pancakes are great as is, but even better with some vanilla and cinnamon.  There is no substitute for whole wheat PASTRY flour, as it gives it its fluffiness.

These pancakes are fantastic! I used regular whole wheat flour and just added an extra tablespoon of buttermilk with perfect results. Tender and fluffy, my kids loved them. Thank you for the recipe!!

These pancakes have a very hearty, healthy taste to them.  My picky two-year-old ate three of them.  That is the ultimate compliment!  I did not have buttermilk, so I added some lemon juice to regular milk and it worked just fine.  Also used regular whole wheat flour.  These are great with a little butter and honey.

I used spelt flour, applesauce instead of oil, homemade buttermilk, and a sprinkle of sugar.  These were wonderful.  Everyone at my house loved them.

Very light and fluffy!  The wheat germ gives a great nutty taste to these pancakes.  I topped them with a little leftover melted lemon curd and margarine.

I love the flavour of the whole wheat. I added sliced banana on top of the batter for added taste (and fibre). I used whole wheat bread flour and omitted the salt and wheat germ. Instead, I added 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tbsp brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. This made it good enough to eat on its own without any syrup or topping.

I've tried this recipe with both all-purpose whole wheat flour and the pastry kind and the difference is marginal.  If all you have is all-purpose whole wheat then don't worry.  Go ahead and make them, because they're great!

The only addition I would make to this recipe is adding blueberries.  I usually pour some on one side of the pancake when it's on the pan.

Aside: To truly enjoy the pancake experience I HIGHLY recommend you go out and buy a cast-iron pan if don't already have one.

These were delicious!  I also added ground flaxseed, and cut back the oil to half.  I didn't have pastry flour, so I used regular whole wheat and added blueberries for even more goodness.  I also separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites for really fluffy pancakes.  My two year old niece devoured two!  Definitely a keeper :)

Just tried these with bananas and blueberries, and they were quite good.

The only thing I fiddled with was adding a teaspoon of double-acting baking powder to half of the batter.  It made that half überfluffy.  Something to fiddle with in the future.

Wow! Best pancakes I have ever had! Even my brother (who never eats healthy food) loved them! I used fresh ground whole wheat. The buttermilk helped so they weren't to heavy. Perfect!

This is a great recipe. The pancakes turned out nice and fluffy. I added about 1/4 cup of splenda and I think next time I will add some chopped pecans. The recipe has a great nutty taste and I will make it again for sure. 

My husband wasn't going to have any since they were whole wheat - but then he tasted mine and asked me to make a couple more for him!

My toddler and I love these!  My husband, not so much.  They do have a graininess to them, but that comes with wheat flour and wheat germ. We make them when he's at work now, lol.  Our tot enjoys these with peanut butter and banana slices in lieu of butter/syrup.

Excellent recipe! I did use baking powder instead of baking soda because another review mentioned that. We thoroughly enjoyed these pancakes and will make them again!

Very good and healthy, the only problem is are not fluffy like most buttermilk pancakes, probably because of the wheat germ.

These are so filling! I can eat pancakes made from white flour and still feel hungry after three of them, but I could hardly get two of these down! They are so light and delicate, but very nutritious and satisfying. What a great combination. After reading many reviews, I decided to just put 2T oil and 2T applesauce in place of the full amount of oil. Due to this, it was a little thick, so I added more buttermilk until it was a consistency I like. I topped them with sliced strawberries, a dollop of plain yogurt (a must for pancakes in my opinion) and some maple syrup. The plain yogurt might seem weird, but mixed with some syrup and fruit it's not only delicious, it also adds some extra nutrition to your meal. I will most definitely make these pancakes again soon!

Wow.  These are our new favorite pancakes!  Since I only had 1.5 cups of buttermilk, I then used regular milk for the other .5 cup.  Worked fine.  I also added blueberries to the batter and they were plenty sweet enough for us.  Thanks!!!

Although I love that these are healthy, they are a little bland.  I had to add a little sugar, bananas,  or blueberries to get my kids to say "Yum".   Subbing applesauce for some of the oil also works.  I would definitely change the soda for baking powder, having made them both ways.  But beware!  Using whole wheat flour (as my husband did) instead of whole wheat pastry flour makes them very flat and heavy.

These were the perfect texture and very yummy! Approved by 3 out of 4 kids. (The fourth is quite particular...) I didn't have any wheat germ so I just used the wheat pastry flour. These are the only pancakes I'll be making from now on!

These are fabulous!  I made a few mods--1 cup whole wheat, 1 cup all-purpose as I did not have whole wheat pastry flour; squeezed juice of two small lemons into milk as I did not have buttermilk; added 1/2 cup of ground flax; also used baking powder rather than soda as suggested by another reviewer; last--added 1 cup of frozen blueberries thawed.  I will be tossing out my other recipe and making these from now on!  YUM!

I didn't have wheat germ on hand so I used oat bran instead. I also substituted apple sauce for the canola oil for a healthier version and the pancakes still turned out great! I did add some chocolate pieces and banana to the batter though...(:  Both the hubby and I enjoyed the pancakes very much!

I wasn't too sure about these when I was cooking them, but the were really good!  They were light and fluffy with a good flavor.  I was a little worried about adding the oil, so I cut it down to about 1 Tablespoon (I didn't have a nonstick pan).  I will definitely make these again!

Pretty good, but you must like wheat products. If you are not a fan of wheat bread, this might be to "wheatie" for you. I loved them though and they were WAY more filling than regular pancakes. I will definitely make these again.

These are the best. I use regular WW flour, add a bit of white flour just to thicken. I use lemon juice/milk instead of buttermilk. I have added milled flax seed, and a bit of demerara sugar as well. Then when I cook them I sprinkle on lots of fruit - either frozen, fresh or dried or a mix. For two people I half the recipe. These are such a hit and so much more filling and better for you than regular pancakes! Thanks for a great recipe!

I scaled this down to make just for myself this morning because I prefer a healthier breakfast than the rest of my family.  I think that they were jealous of me - I loved these.  Paired with a blueberry raspberry topping, and these were healthy and delicious.  Will make again and again.

I'm sure they were fine as is,,,but I used grapeseed oil(needed using up), and soy(no cow milk for me) with vinegar and spelt and multigrain flour. Always double pancake recipe and freeze whats left for kids.

The BEST whole wheat pancakes ever. I have tried many whole wheat recipes, and this one surpasses them all by far. Used 4 egg whites instead of 2 eggs, and pastry flour. They were very light, fluffy and moist. You could hardly tell they were whole grain.

I thought these were excellent.  Mine came out light and fluffy.  My 3 little girls absolutely loved them!   I added blueberries and topped with butter and raw honey.  Yum!  Next time I will use coconut oil to fry them as one of the other reviewers suggested :)

I have been stuck in a rut of oatmeal and a smoothie for breakfast for ever! I thought it was the easiest and healthiest thing to  make in the morning. After finally finishing off a box of whole wheat pancake mix, which was ok, I decided to find a recipe for whole wheat pancakes. These are amazingly easy and way better than the box mix. These will definitely become a breakfast regular.

I replaced 1/2 cup of whole wheat with unbleached white because I didn't think my family would go for these, but they were absolutely fluffy and delicious.  We also added blueberries, but the would be especially good with banana slices to sweeten them up.

Amazing! I read other reviews where they did not add any oil, and I did the same. They turned out super light and fluffy! Topped them with fruit and some maple syrup for more flavor. I'll definitely make these again.

I was really leary how these would taste. I even got my jar of cinnamon out to sprinkle over them if I didn't like the taste. THEY ARE DELICIOUS!!! I will be making these all the time. I did add 2 Tblsps. of sugar as suggested and also added 3 Tblsps. of flaxseed. I would give these 10 stars if I could. My 4 yr old grandson asked for a second helping.

Fantastic!  Using whole wheat flour versus whole wheat pastry flour worked fine. These pancakes cooked up so nicely, were soft, and just plain yummy.  Must try!

I just tried this recipe tonight and have to say it was excellent as written. I made mickey mouse waffles with it and they turned out great. My husband really liked then. Now I can't wait to make these for our kids next time the visit. Will try them as pancakes too soon. Thanks for the recipe. Val

I have tried this recipe twice now and each time the pancakes came out extremely thin.  The first time I followed the recipe precisely.  The second attempt I followed the suggestion of other reviewers who said to use baking powder instead of soda.  Same result.

This is a great pancake recipe for those looking for a "healthier" pancake.  I did change a few ingredients to make them even healthier.  I used applesauce for the oil, plain whole wheat flour for the pastry flour, Egg Beaters for the eggs and skim milk/lemon juice for the buttermilk.  They turned out great!  I used a heaping 1/4c for each pancake, and here is the nutritional info per pancake: 56 cal, 1gm fat, 9gm carbs, 1gm fiber, 4 gm protein, 1mg cholesterol.  I served these with sugar free maple syrup. I didn't know pancakes could be so good and good for you!!!!

Healthy and good-tasting - a combo I enjoy! Produced a tender and fluffy pancake, just as a pancake should be! I felt it needed some extra flavor so I added cinnamon. And ground flax seed for more oomph. =) Served with fresh sliced peaches and "Supreme Strawberry Topping"...awesome combo!

I used baking powder instead of soda since that made more "sense" to me.  Very light and fluffy.  Almost too fluffy since the outsides were pretty dark to get them cooked through.  Tasted DELISH! Update:  tried with one tsp baking powder and one of baking soda and I got the texture I was looking for.  This is becoming my go to pancake recipe.

Update:  Made again with half baking powder half baking soda and they were PERFECT!  Served with warm apple compote and maple syrup

These were surprisingly very yummy.  I was worried they'd be really dry but they weren't!  I used olive oil and regular whole wheat flour instead.  Otherwise followed directions perfectly.  My husband and kids all really like these.  These taste GREAT with vanilla yogurt and bananas.  Give them a shot!

I have perfected this recipe!  I used baking powder instead of baking soda to produce a fluffy pancake. Also, when you are mixing up the batter, mix the wet ingredients together in one bowl, and the dry ingredients together in another bowl.  Then dump the wet mixture into the dry mixture and do not overmix - it's okay if you've got a few lumps in your batter.  Finally, use real butter on your griddle - this will give your pancakes a slightly crispy edge, just like the buttermilk pancakes from Cracker Barrel!

Super Delicious!!! The kids loved these pancakes. I made this recipe exactly as is but at the end I added 1 mashed banana and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. Very healthy, I will make it again.

These were pretty tasty. Not too "wheaty" or overly healthy tasting. My only complaint is that they came out fairly flat- I was hoping they'd rise a bit more and be a little lighter. Perhaps there should be a little more baking soda/powder, and/or the batter should sit a little while before putting it on the griddle.

Pretty good, especially for how healthy they are.  Didn't have buttermilk, so I used lowfat vanilla yogurt & milk, seemed to work just fine.  Toasted the wheat germ for 5 minutes under the broiler, and added huckleberries to the batter for extra sweetness.  Smaller pancakes work better, larger ones fall apart when flipping.

Delicious recipe.  Don't skip the ww pastry flour -- it makes the texture of these smooth and yields soft fluffy pancakes. WW pastry flour is made with soft wheat and is milled finer. Regular ww flour is made from hard wheat with a higher gluten content (which will make pancakes tougher and flatter).

This was surprisingly good. I was looking for a healthy alternative to the traditional buttermilk pancakes since my husband and I have gone on a health craze this year. The only changes I made was I used baking powder instead of baking soda and I used all-purpose WW instead of WW pastry flour (our grocery store just does not sell it). Not significant enough changes to alter the taste too much. It came out great. They were fluffy and tasted good. They were a lot more filling than regular pancakes too so instead of the normal six that my husband used to scarf down, he could only eat three and he was full. I was really happy about that. Now if only I can find a healthier alternative to syrup. I can use the fruit versions myself, but my husband won't touch the stuff. Oh well, at least it is healthier anyway...lol. Thanks so much for our new Sunday morning breakfast routine.

These were very good pancakes. Due to the thickness of the batter, I wasn't able to make the published number of pancakes, but small price to pay! The addition of blueberries added to the flavor.

The whole family loved this recipe!  I didn't have any whole wheat pastry flour so I just used regular whole wheat flour.  The batter was a little thick but it turned out fine, not dry.  This is a yummy healthy recipe!  TFS

Mmmmm.  These were just what I wanted, light and fluffy.  Added 1 T. brown sugar.  Good with 1 c. white flour, 1 c. wheat flour instead of the wheat germ/whole wheat pastry flour.

Yummy! These are great pancakes, and I make them every morning!  The batter was thin, but don't worry, they do puff up nicely.  I added blueberries which really helped the taste.  I recently decided to add about 2 Tablespoons of vanilla to the batter, and it really added a nice sweetness!  *Oh, one more thing.  Today, I decided to do what one reviewer suggested, which was to substitute the baking soda for baking powder.  Do NOT do this!  You can't substitute this way.  It produced a sour aftertaste.  Baking soda can be substituted for baking powder, but not vice-versa.  Needless to say, I'll be making them again tomorrow-the right way!

I make this pancake recipe at least once a week.  My kid's love it  It's great just as is -- I use regular whole wheat flour though (as opposed to pastry flour).  Also, to spice it up a bit try adding 1 tsp VANILLA (quality vanilla is best if you can find it...not the imitation kind -- I found mine at a health food store) and 1/2 tsp of CLOVES....yummm....especially nice in the fall!

These taste good and are very healthy. Served with sliced bananas and pancake syrup. I subbed low fat vanilla yoghurt for the buttermilk.  I encountered a couple of problems though - First the batter was SO thick I had to add about a cup of milk to thin it out.  The second problem was that my pancakes browned awful fast even on a low heat and they did tend to stick a bit (even in a teflon pan).  Will probably not make these again.

These pancakes are AWESOME.

I subbed maple/brown sugar granola for the wheat germ which gave off an incredible smell when cooking and omitted
the oil because I was using a teflon grill. Really, really super recipe.

I can't stress enough to those who make these pancakes.....DO NOT OVERMIX. I stirred the batter gently until it was just incorporated which made a light and fluffy pancake. I also used baking powder instead of baking soda, like some of the other cooks. 

I used these for fruit pancakes like my kids always order at Shari's. My older 
son told me it's better than theirs, which was the best compliment ever.

I will SO be making these again.

I am very pleased with these pancakes- healthy and yummy. I used vanilla yogurt to replace the buttermilk and it made the batter very thick- but we liked it! I added a little vanilla (1/4 tsp) and that added a nice flavor. I also added some berries into the pancakes right after i put them on the grill. 
Will make again!

Great recipe for a slightly more healthful pancake option!  These are light (considering the use of WW flour) and very fluffy.  I used regular WW flour, which didn't seem to have a negative effect but I'm not sure how they might have been different with the WW pastry flour.  Like another reviewer, I wasn't too sure about the 2 tsp of baking soda, so I used one tsp each of baking soda and baking powder.  For my taste, I also added ~ 1 T sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and a pinch of nutmeg.  I served these with the recipe for "Absolute Best Pancake Syrup" on this site -- another good recipe.

These are great! I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular milk and they still tasted fabulous. I can see that the buttermilk would be better but they are still great with just milk! My 4 year old and 1 year old loved them!

Perhaps I shouldn't have taken advice from a previous review that said they were too thin and that using baking powder solved that problem.  I used powder instead of soda and they were ridiculously thin, like coasters.  Cooking them at my normal pancake temperature, and even with them so thin, I could not get them to cook in the middle.  I added some sugar (as another reviewer suggested) and they were still fairly tasteless.  I gave this 2 stars because it's possible it was all my cooking and not the recipe, but I will still not be trying this one again.

My husband is a diabetic so I look for recipes like this.  I only had the canned buttermilk that you mix with water and I only had whole wheat flour instead of the pastry flour called for so that is what I used and it was still wonderful!  I added some cinnamon to make it even more healthy and after he finished his plate he said ihe would now love me forever!!!  This is that kind of recipe!

These are my new favorite pancake.  I couldn't find wheat germ so I replaced it with quick oats and everyone raves about them.  I've added sliced bananas and strawberries too for extra flair and they're irresistible. My one year old loves them, and I love that I'm not feeding him a bunch of white flour.

Made them this morning with regular whole wheat flour, quick cooking multi grain cereal instead of wheat germ and apple sauce instead of oil. They were delicious - very soft and fluffy. I doubt if we will use store bought pancake flour again...

These weren't bad, but since I started making "Dad's Whole Grain Pancakes" from this site nearly every week, no other pancake seems to measure up. If you do make these, I suggest switching the baking soda to baking powder, and adding a tablespoon of sugar.

Sorry to give this one 3 stars. The pancake turns out well and golden brown. Partly becuase of baking soda. But baking soda is also a culprit as it give funny taste.

Fabulous pancake recipe!  To make it non-dairy, I substituted almond milk (+ 2 tbsp. lemon juice) for the buttermilk and added blueberries to the batter.  It's a keeper!

The kids loved it!
I used 1 cup wheat flour and 1/2 c cake flour because I didn't have any ww pastry flower on hand -- turned out great.  I was a bit weary because the batter was so thin!  But they turned out perfect.  We topped with a homemade strawberry light syrup.

For a healthy recipe, these are great!  I was worried about the lack of sweetness so I used applesauce instead of oil and added cinnamon. I also added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts.  My two year old loves them and so do I.

I've been searching for a healthy pancake recipe that my husband likes.  This is it.  The entire family liked them.  I did not have wheat germ so I subbed oatmeal and it was an excellent substitution.  The texture was perfect.  I added some sugar (about 2 T.) and vanilla (about 2 t.). The WW pastry flour keeps the pancakes light and fluffy with a closer texture to regular pancakes than the usually healthy pancakes.  Thanks for the recipe!!

fluffy. healthy. good! I would best describe them as neutral tasting, making them interchangable to being topped with sweet toppings such as syrup, berries, yogurt and honey to savoury toppings like cheese, ham and even scrambled eggs! Great and easy recipe!

My kids raved about these and devoured them!  It's nice being able to fix something healthy AND tasty.  I used Egg Beaters, low fat buttermilk, and substituted sugar-free applesauce for the oil.  I also used half wheat germ and half flaxseed meal and added 1 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon.

Delicious!  I added frozen blueberries and the pancakes turned out beautifully.  I am going to add strawberries today!  BTW- I used 'homemade' buttermilk.  1 Tablespoon of white vinegar per 1 cup of milk and let sit for 5-10 minutes.

This recipe is so good.  I didn't have any wheat germ, but I had golden flax meal that I subsituted.  They were so good.  I served them with the "Buttermilk Syrup" recipe on this site.  It was out of this world.  My children also snacked on these plain later.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing.

These were very good. However, I had to add to them to make them that way, so I am only giving them 4 stars. I added cinnamon, sugar and orange zest. I honestly don't think they had any taste until I added these extras. I will definately make again with my additions.

Oh these pancakes were divine!  I was looking to use some excess bananas I had that were going too ripe for regular consumption, so I mashed some in and it made them more dense, but even more substantial.  I will be making this again!

AWESOME.  And all this time I've been using a store-bought (and expensive) wholegrain mix when I made pancakes for my family, knowing that it was good for them, but secretly hating the taste myself!  This recipe makes Mommy happy from a nutritional standpoint and all of us happy from a "yummy" standpoint!  THANKS for the recipe!  UPDATE:  Agree with another cook that these turn out great with a combination of yogurt and regular milk, as a substitute for the buttermilk (certainly not a staple at my house).  And I like to do "dump cakes," sprinkling on one of more of granola, dried fruits, nuts, chocolate chips, etc. as they cook.  Finally, I use half flaxseed, half wheat germ (in lieu of all wheat germ).

This recipe was excellent!  I accidently started making a serving for 12 instead of 3 so froze the extra. Will take out of freezer next week and cook so I can see how they turn out after frozen.

These were amazing! I loved  everything about them from the ease of preparation to the  nutty healthy flavor. We will be making these for years to come!!
I added 1/4 cup brown sugar because we like our pancakes a little bit sweet and that way my 1 year old can eat them without messy syrup.

This is a great recipe!  Light and fluffy.  I will definitely make this again.  Although I like the recipe as-is, I think next time I'm going to add 1 tbsp brown sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  My only caution is to not over-load the pancake batter on a single cake - they really expand outward while cooking- more so than other pancakes.  Otherwise, Awesome!

Oh my goodness - these are just the best pancakes ever!  I tried the recipe for Buttermilk Pancakes II on this website first, and those were brilliant, but these are even better!  They are tall and fluffy, just like the regular buttermilk pancakes, but also incredibly hearty and satisfying!  What a great recipe!

These pancakes were very light and fluffy.  I ground my own wheat flour to use in my Vitamix.  I let the flour go a little longer than usual so that it would be like whole wheat pastry flour.  I did add some sucanat to the pancakes as I like my pancakes on the sweet side.  I also added blueberries once the pancakes were on the griddle.  I will be making these again they are delicious.

The best pancake I’ve ever made!!  And it’s healthy to boot!  Okay, I made a few minor changes out of necessity. Didn’t have wheat germ so I used flax. Also added cinnamon and a splash of vanilla for flavor. Next time...apples!!!  It’s definitely a keeper.

Delicious. Blended regular whole wheat flour and wheat germ to make it more pastry like. Will try it with real whole wheat pastry flour next time.

Great pancakes, I did make some changes to make it more diabetic friendly by substituting the all purpose flour with half coconut flour and half flaxseeds, unsweetened applesauce for the olive oil and zulka sugar for the brown sugar. Turned out great.

I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour, so I mixed half whole wheat flour with half all purpose. I only used a tablespoon of oil instead of a whole 1/4 cup. They came out very good and fluffy. Would make again

Love this recipe. I make it all the time, and the kids love it. If I have it on hand, I will add chia seeds or substitute almond milk for buttermilk. It all depends on what I have in the fridge! Regardless, they turn out delicious every time!

Terrific!  Followed the directions exactly, then made waffles out of the batter - they came out great!  :)

These pancakes were really good, I used multigrain flour, added 1tbs of brown sugar, some sunflower seed and flax seed.  Everyone loved them!

Yum yum yum yum yum! I have tried SO many pancake recipes and they have ALL been disappointing. I LOVE wheat germ so I decided to make these. I substituted applesauce for the oil to make them healthier and used equal amounts of baking powder and soda. DELISH!

They aren't as light and fluffy as I would like and they aren't at all sweet.  I prefer a little sweet to the batter.  Overall, it's a solid four stars with a little room for improvement.

I omitted the oil and used a buttermilk made of 2 cups fat free milk and 2 tablespoons vinegar.  These are AMAZING pancakes!  Our kids loved them, too.  I served them with the Homemade Pancake Syrup, which needed a little doctoring but was pretty delicious.

I'm rating this recipe 5 stars- as a base recipe.  After reading the reviews, I decided to add 1 Tbsp of sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1\2 tsp of B\K powder, and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  I do not feel that the 2 tsp b\k soda is a misprint in this recipe, and next time I may omit the 1\2 tsp b\k powder that I added.  The pancakes turned out VERY fluffy.  I agree with other reviewers who said that the people complaining about the pancakes being flat may have been using old b\k soda (even the cold pancakes sitting on the counter are still fluffy).  As I said, this recipe is great as a base recipe- to tinker with to suit your taste!

These are wonderful.  We haven't been eating pancakes because they're so nutritionally void.  This recipe is so much healthier for us & tastes fabulous.  I was out of buttermilk & took the advice of another reviewer to use milk & lemon juice, which worked great.  Also, we don't use canola oil so I substituted with 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil.  Thanks for the recipe & the suggestions!

These were great.  They were a little flat but very tasty.  For the buttermilk, I used 1 TB / 1 cp. milk.  I used baking powder.  I used Honey Crunch Wheat Germ from Kretschmer.  For the whole wheat pastry flour, I finely ground hard spring wheat berries.   I added pecans to one side while the other side was cooking.  I will definitely make these again.

I unfortunately didn't have all the ingredients - I substituted apple sauce for the oil, and a couple of tablespoons of ground flax seeds for the wheat germ that I was short. I also used regular whole wheat flour. These had a great flavour and texture, even with the substitutions. Will definitely make again.

Great pancakes!  I didn't have wheat germ or buttermilk (added some plain yogurt instead) and they turned out great.  I added 1 Tbsp sugar and some blueberries.  My 4 yr old and 1 yr old loved these and so did I.  A keeper!

These were ok pancakes.  Fluffy and moist, but they tasted sort of like egg, which I don't know if it's because there's too much egg or too much buttermilk.

This was the best wheat pancake I have ever had! I did sub 1 cup vanilla yogurt for one of the cups of buttermilk, so I had to turn the burner down so the pancakes wouldn't burn on the outside from the added sugar.

This was very good - but I did have to thin the batter with a little added milk (skim). I also added about 1 tbsp of sugar, and 1 cup frozen blueberries.

These are excellent!  I didn't even use pastry flour because i didn't have it.  All i had was my homeground whole wheat flour with some of the bran sifted out.  i didn't add much salt either as i am using for my 11 month old.  I also used goats milk & vinegar instead of buttermilk.  Excellent flavor & nice crispy texture on the outside.  If i wanted them thicker & fluffier, i'd add a little more flour to the batter & possibly some more baking soda.

These are very good whole-wheat pancakes.  I just tried a recipe yesterday, from this site, that were similar but had a little while flour and whole wheat flour along with the wheat germ.  I've been looking for something with no white flour, and I think this is going to be in my breakfast rotation at least three times per week.  I scaled the recipe down to four servings, which yielded two nice size pancakes, and added a Tbsp. of flax seed for overall health and hormonal benefits.  (Flax seed is good for the boobies, ladies...and it's breast cancer awareness month...sorry for the language, guys!)  I try to minimize dairy in my diet so I used unsweetened almond milk instead but did keep 2 Tbsp. of buttermilk as it lends wonderful flavor and makes for a fluffier pancake.  And since I always use both baking powder AND soda in my pancake recipes, I just used half and half of each.  Pancakes always seems to rise better this way.  I also took a tip from the pancake tips article on this site and separated my egg white and beat it to get nice fluffy peaks and then folded it in at the end.  This made a big difference a very fluffy pancake.  I definitely think that whole wheat pastry flour makes a big difference when making a whole wheat pancake...much better texture.  Oh, also added 1 Tbsp. Xylitol for some sweetness.  Thanks for a great recipe we can all feel good about eating.

Good recipe, but the pancakes were just a little bland. Not sure how I would improve on them--perhaps a little sugar, or cinnamon or something along that line. They also had a slight baking-powder taste so I will probably cut back on that next time. Added blueberries while cooking and that was a nice touch.

We wanted to like these healthy pancakes, but they had a flat and somewhat bitter after taste.  After cooking a few and tasting, I added some 1T sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the rest of the batter which inproved the flavor.  They started out fluffing up, but by the time they were cooked through, they were paper thin.  I would not make these again

I give this a 5 star but, I made changes to the original recipe. I took advice from another review and used baking powder instead of soda. Baking soda seemed wierd. I also put sliced bananas in all my pancakes. These were so good and so easy. Very simple. I will not make any changes, and this will be my new regular pancake recipe. TY so much.

These were ok; they were tasty right off the griddle, but once they sat for a while they got floppy and spongy. They had good flavor, but weren't very fluffy or thick.

I think that these could be really great but I could taste the baking soda in them.  I'd try them out again but next time use either less baking soda or baking powder instead.  The texture was not bad (I make only whole grain pancakes and find white flour ones to be like styrofoam) and as others have said they are quite filling.  I am not normally a banana person but in reading reviews and in trying things I do think they would be really good with mashed banana and maybe some pecans mixed in.

Light, fluffy, healthy pancakes.  I added a couple heaping teaspoons of ww flour (I used it instead of pastry flour) to thicken it up a little.  Very good.  My fiancee and I loved them!

these pancakes were delicious!! i didn't use the oil and i used regular milk instead of buttermilk and they turned out great! i also added some chocolate chips to give them a twist but i'm sure they'd be great without them too.  also, the pan has to be at a high temperature...i only figured that out towards making the last pancakes so my first ones were not as good.  great recipe though!!

My husband decided to make these for breakfast while the older kids and I were asleep.  He came and woke us up very excitedly and said he had some wholesome and fluffy pancakes ready for us.  Lol.  He decided to add mixed berries to the mix, and they were still very good.

We loved these pancakes. They did need more flour than 1 1/2 cups.  I used ww flour, not pastry flour since I didn't have it.  I also did use 1/2 baking soda and 1/2 baking powder.  They were light and fluffy and had a nutty taste to them.  Love 'em!

Batter was completely runny.  I ended up having to add a copious amount of flour, otherwise we'd have had crepes for breakfast.  The flavor wasn't great.  Lots better pancake recipes on the site.

Oh my goodness, these are OUTSTANDING!!! I used whole wheat made from white wheat berries. It is milder in flavor than standard whole wheat.I did everything  else exactly as stated.These are a winner and I will never create another kind of pancake other than these. I was thinking shredded coconut in the batter and ground macacdamia nuts over the top with a syrup made with coconut milk with lots of real butter would be a GREAT twist but I will always use this recipe as a base.AMAZING!!

I love these pancakes!  They have become a family favorite.  I decrease the baking soda a little and add vanilla and cinnamon.  I also cook them in a cast iron skillet.  They freeze well and are easy to reheat in a toaster over for a quick breakfast.  Warm blueberries and Michigan maple syrup are a must!

The first time I made these, I used a thick unsweetened plain yogurt instead of milk, and white flour instead of wheat pastry flour.  I added 1 teaspoon baking powder.  They turned out very thick and indulgent!  I ate them with bananas and walnuts, a little maple syrup and dollups of spray whipped cream.  They were great!

However, the second time I made these, I used 1 c. runny sweetened yogurt and 1. cup milk, and whole wheat pastry flour.  I added 1 teaspoon baking powder.  The pancakes turned out very runny and flat, almost like crepes.  They were soggy and didn't crisp on the top and bottom.  

If I make these again, I'll either go back to thick yogurt and try the wheat flour to see, or I will reduce the milk/dairy in half and maybe use yogurt.  We'll have to keep tweaking this, because they do not rise or work well as written.  (and yes, my baking powder and soda were new and fresh).

this is my new favourite pancake recipe.  My subs, a mix of melted butter and apple suuce to take out the GMO canola oil, use  1 tsp of baking powder and one of baking soda.  they freeze well, so we put the extra ones in the freezer and have pancakes again later in the week.    i serve pancakes with apple sauce instead of maple syrup and no little ones ask for  syrup.

After I decided to make these pancakes, I realized I was out of wheat germ, so I added 1/2 C white flour . I used regular whole wheat flour. I also added 1 t pure vanilla. Made very nice "puffy" pancakes. The whole family enjoyed them. I look forward to making again, this time with wheat germ. Thanks for sharing!

This is a good start to one's day, even if the taste is slightly bland. I add either 1/4 C crushed walnuts (pecans would also do), or 1/8 t cinnamon or nutmeg to this recipe, just to give it a little more flavor and/or nutrition. The walnuts help a lot. Other than being slightly bland, I see no problems with this. Good one -- try it if you're looking for a healthy alternative to white flour pancakes!

I almost added more flour, as the batter was very runny, but resisted and I'm glad I did.  Ended up following recipe exactly except added a little ground flax, and they same out great - not super fluffy, but not flat either.  I think it's missing a touch of sweetness to the batter, either a tbsp of sugar or some blueberries would have bumped this up to a 5 star for me.  These aren't pancakes you could pass off to a "whole wheat hater" (like my husband) as regular pancakes, but my daughter and I love them.   Served some with traditional maple syrup, some with a dusting of confectioners suger, mixed berries and a dollop of yogurt.  Will make again!  Thanks for sharing!

Very easy to throw together.  I halved the recipe, substituted the canola oil for pumpkin and added some cinnamon,nutmeg,and vanilla.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. I had some amazingly fluffy pancakes. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

delicious! we  didn't have wheat germ, butter milk, pastry whole wheat flour or baking soda so we substituted for all these things and the recipe still turned out very moist and delicious. we substituted 2 cups of 1% milk and 2 teaspoons of instant baking mix for the buttermilk, crushed wheat chex for the wheat germ, regular whole wheat flour of the pastry wheat flour, and baking powder for the baking soda. we also added 2 cut up ripe bananas and a couple of handful of walnut pieces to the mix. the pankcakes come out very porous which is great as a vehicle for syrup-- without syrup, they might have been a bit blah.

Great starter recipe! I used 1/4 butter and regular whole wheat flour.  We like our pancakes to be like silver dollar pancakes and this recipe is great for that. I gave it a four because I tweaked it, but the pancakes turned out GREAT!

I thought these pancakes were great!  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 unbleached white flour and they came out perfect.  My whole family loved them!  Thank you!

Delicious.  I replaced half of the fat with applesauce and the wheat germ with crushed Wheat Chex.  We added sliced bananas and chocolate chips to some of the pancakes and those tasted really good as well.  Try this recipe!

I added about 1/2 tsp Vanilla and used 1/2 cup all purpose flour in place of 1/2 cup of wheat.  They were great!

Yum!  My husband was sceptical because of the wheat germ and whole wheat flour but he ate them up!  Much better than any store bought mix I've tried and very easy to make.  I took the advice of other reviewers and did half baking soda and half baking powder.  We will definitely make this our primary pancake recipe.

I made the following changes: used baking powder for baking soda, added blueberries. My baby rejected the pancakes and pulled out all the blueberries to eat. The pancakes had an overpowering whole wheat flavor. If I make it again, I would replace some of the whole wheat flour with all purpose.

this recipe definitely provides a good start to a healthy pancake.  We decided it would be improved with the sweetness of warm fruit on top, or blueberries in the batter.

I made this recipe w/ the following subs. Unsweetened applesauce for oil, 2tbsp ground flax seed plus 6tbsp water for eggs, and 2% milk plus 4tbsp butter- milk powder and instead of 2tsp soda I done 1tsp and added 1tsp baking powder and I almost forgot-- I only had reg. ww flour, not the pastry kind and these were a hit w/ me and my two children 4 and 10. I served theirs w/ homemade maple flavored syrup and I dipped mine in the unsweetened applesauce. VERY YUMMY(even though its a total rendition of the true recipe--but if trying to lose weight like me I hope this helps and I'm gonna try count weight watcher points and will try to update. Thanks for a start to this recipe

These are easy, healthy and delicious.  I substituted the oil with apple sauce and used only 1 cup of regular wheat flour.  Everyone loved them.  Next time I think I'll mash some banana and chopped walnuts into the mix.

Yummy! Although I did make a few adjustments. I didn't have straight buttermilk so I substituted a little non-fat milk and Betty Crocker pancake mix instead. I added two smashed bananas, a splash of vanilla extract, cinnamon, and a splash of water to thin them out a little. They turned out great! I topped them off with a little homemade (not my home unfortunately, but from a sweet little lady at my farmer's market) spiced fig preserves. Next time I might take up the suggestion to use apple sauce instead of oil.(FYI: Trader Joe's has a great variety of apple sauces). Enjoy!!

I found these pancakes to be tasty, but a bit on the flat and tough side.  After reading the reviews, I think that I'll try to use baking POWDER instead of the soda next time.  That being said, anything that you put butter and syrup on is going to be great.

This is really good. I have not had a pancake in a year and I really wanted some.  Did not have baking soda and still turned out great.  Cured my craving for pancakes.  Will make again.

This pancake is very easy and quick to make.  Even my hungry needy toddler can wait for this cake. And this WHOLE WHEAT pancake is not dense at all! It is healthy, but still so fluffy!  I love this recipe!

These are the best healthy pancakes I have ever made.  I like sweeter pancakes so I added 2 T. sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  They were light and fluffy and will become a regular.

The batter was thick, but cooked up nicely and they taste very good, hearty and filling.  I had to substitute regular whole wheat flour for the pastry flour once and they were still very good.

Yes, I'm one of those annoying people who gives the recipe 5 stars even though she altered the recipe! I took others' advice and added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 T. sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. I also let the wheat germ "soak" in the liquids before adding the other dry ingredients to soften its texture--don't know if it helped but I'm guessing it did. I took the advice of the reviewer at high-altitude and reduced the baking soda (since I'm at 6000 ft.--again, did it make a difference? Not sure.) I tried this recipe two ways--one, with vegetable oil and the other by substituting butter for oil. They were both good, but I thought the oil had a slight edge in producing a lighter pancake. Try to use the whole wheat pastry flour if you can--you can buy it at Whole Foods. I'm not on a diet or a health nut--I would make these again just 'cause they taste good! Cut this recipe in half if you're making for a small family. (But remember pancakes freeze well! Wrap them in layers of waxed paper so they don't stick together, then wrap tightly in foil. Heat them on high for 30 seconds and they're ready to go.)

This was really good.  I had to substitute lemon/milk for buttermilk and I added 2T of Flax Seed and 1 T of white sugar.  In general, they tasted great and fluffed up nicely.  I still can't get the heat right and always end up with a VERY dark brown pancake, but they didn't taste burnt, so I guess that is okay!  I will definitely make these again.

I cannot find whole wheat pastry flour, but I have plenty of regular whole wheat, so that's what I used.  We really liked these pancakes and I will definitely make them again.  Later in the day, I toasted one for my grandson (age one) and he relished it!

I have been making this since I was pregnant (2007) & craving pancakes! It is so delicious. I make the recipe exactly as written, but sometimes with variations like adding chocolate chips, blueberries, or pumpkin... They are not super fluffy but not flat either. I make as is & using 1/4 cup, it makes 20-24...  They are just fabulous. My 4 year old just gobbles them up. They freeze very well! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

I didn't have any wheat germ, so I used more WW pastry flour in it's place.  I first tried it without the vanilla and cinnamon additions that people recommended and it was ok.  Then I added 1/2 to 1 t of cinnamon and 1 t of vanilla and it totally changed the taste.  I couldn't taste the cinnamon much, but it masked some of the wheat taste that my husband didn't like.  My 8 year old liked them!

This is a great, healthy recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added cinnamon, vanilla and splenda so that we cuold eat without syrup.  This will definitely be made again!

I used egg substitute and white whole wheat flour (King Arthur) and these were great.  Light and fluffy, not dense.  Added vanilla and cranberries as well, good basic healthy pancake recipe

Delicious! I followed readers' advice and added 1 teaspoon vanilla, no extra sugar. I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour. So I used regular white flour. So tasty that I will make up bags of "dry ingredients" so I can whip up pancakes any day of the week!

I love these pancakes! I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour or whole eggs, so I took the advise of HAYNIE13 about the flour and used a 1/2 cup of egg whites. Next time I will try haynie's idea of reducing the oil and using applesauce.

Yummy!  I usually don't care for pancakes because I feel so heavy afterwards.  No the case with this recipe.  However, I used half the oil, added two tablespoons of flaxseed meal, and two tablespoons of honey.  This is the first time that I have NEVER had pancakes stick to the griddle.  My 3-year-old son ate the entire pancake before I finished making my husband's plate!  I had left over batter, so I made a pancake for myself this morning.  It was even better today.  I used 50/50 diabetic jelly on top and it was perfect.

These are great and really healthy.  I like to chop up some bananas and throw them in the batter.  This goes great with blueberry sauce.

YUM!  These were excellent!  I only used 1/4 cup of wheat germ because I really couldn't remember when I bought it; I increased the flour by l/4 cup and added l/2 tsp. of baking powder and 2 tbsps. of ground flax seed.  My daughter ate four of these and wanted more.  This is a keeper.
