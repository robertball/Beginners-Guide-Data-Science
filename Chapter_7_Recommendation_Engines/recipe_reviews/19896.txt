Delicious! My husband loved it!  If I could give it 4.5 stars I would (with the modifications below). The pastini (I used ditalini) suprisingly gave this custardy cake a unique texture, almost like there were tapioca balls in it. There was even a syrupy-like consistency on the bottom, making it extra tasty.

Here are a few modifications I made:
-Added 1 grated tangerine peel (about 1 tsp.)
-Added 2 capfuls of whisky.  I'm sure any tasty alcohol would work - perhaps Bailey's or Grand Mariner.
 As a previous reviewer noted, I reduced the baking time to about 1 hour and 40 minutes.  It came out just right. It may be a good idea to check in increments of 10-15 minutes after the hour mark - depending on your oven.
  Thanks so much for this delightful recipe!  Great way to use up ricotta and very easy too!

Very nice texture, a little sweet for me,  I think you could cut back on the sugar and it would still be delicious.

Great on its own, but mix in some chocolate chips and then weep tears of joy.
