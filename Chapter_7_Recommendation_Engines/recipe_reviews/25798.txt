The reviewer from Texas that gave this a one star was not basing her opinion on the recipe the way it was written. You put applesauce and whole wheat flour into a dessert recipe, it's going to change how it tastes, and you really shouldn't be one-starring recipes here if you didn't follow directions.  With that said, I followed the recipe as directed (go figure!) and ended up with deliciously crunchy sweet berry bars that were un-put-down-able.  The vote was unanimous - this recipe's a winner, and it's been requested for Thanksgiving. And again, people, please don't rate recipes poorly if you took artistic license with them, just don't say anything and chalk it up to a bad idea, ok?

I made these yesterday and they were deemed a 'keeper' by the family immediately.  I followed the recipe as written except that I used a raspbery, blueberry, blackberry perserve combination instead or straight raspberry.  There is plenty of oatmeal/flour mixture to cover both the top and bottom of the bars, so no worries.  I would recommend stirring up your preserves in a small bowl before adding them to the crust; this will allow for easier spreading.  Also, do not spread the preserves all the way to the edge, but rather leave a little space so there is no burning.  I would also reccomend keeping an eye on them during baking time; mine were done at about 18 minutes...25 minutes would've been too long in my oven.  A yummy recipe we all enjoyed....thank you!!

These were so easy to make, and tasted great! Since my three year old is allergic to peanuts I have a hard time finding granola bars for him. I cut these bars into rectangles so that they resembled granola bars. They were a huge hit! My only problem was that I couldn't use the outer 1/4 inch of the bars, since the jelly burned onto the pan, so I just cut around that. Next time, I'll be sure to spread the jelly so that it doesn't quite go to the edges.

Yum yum! I substituted applesauce for 1/4 cup of the butter, and left some of the sugar out! If I did it again, I would probably leave even more sugar out. Also, I didn't have very many preserves so heated up some frozen strawberries and added in a little bit of corn starch to thicken them up! (no sugar with the strawberries) It was delicious!

Oh YUM! Per another reviewer I cut back the sugar by half and replaced a quarter of the butter with applesauce. Not only is this a great dessert but it also goes wonderfully with morning coffee. Thank you so much Corwynn!

My oldest boy and I made this together (mostly him, I supervised). I added my own touch (one heaping teaspoon of dried lemon peel to the "crust"). We didn't need the whole jar of raspberry preserves, one cup was plenty. These are baking right now. Great for simplicity with a small list of on hand ingredients for young bakers. EDITED: These were okay. A pain in the rear to get out of the pan. We basically had to chisel them out. Not fun.

These are good with all kinds of preserves/jam. I add a little vanilla to the dough, too. I am going to make a bunch and freeze them so we can just grab them and run in the mornings.

Delicious!  These are my fiance's favorite, and the man likes his desserts.  The first time I made them they burned after 20 minutes- maybe because I had made my own brown sugar with molasses? The second time I lowered the heat to 375 and baked for 17 minutes. Perfect! Delicious with any kind of jam.

These are so yummy!  VERY sweet, but that's fine by me!  I was tempted to try the recipe using Polander all fruit, but used regular raspberry preserves.  I made a double batch, and baked two pans in the oven at once.  One was a coated 13x9, the other was a glass pan.  I found that the metal pan burned the bottom of the bars a bit, but the glass pan came out perfect.  I will definitely use a glass pan when making these again.  I had lots of trouble with spreading the preserves in the first pan.  For the second pan I heated the preserves in the microwave until a bit runny, and then spread them using a spoon that I sprayed with cooking spray.  No problems with spreading!  Before I baked them, I patted down the top oat layer.  The crumbly top made me worried that they would crumble when cut.  They turned out great!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I read the advice of others before baking and decided to make only a few changes on my first try. I used a half a teaspoon of salt which next time I will just exclude all together since I use salted butter. I added a splash of milk to the portion of the mixture used on the bottom so that it would cut nicely. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to mixture. I used a fork to ease flattening the bottom portion into the pan. Even though the bottom seemed thin to me at first, it did thicken upon baking. The jam to batter ratio is perfect. This recipe is delicious and everybody's advice on how to improve this already great recipe was a huge help.

Delicious bars. They are very easy to make. I add some flaked coconut to the crust and I experiment with different jams such as apricot. It is also nice to sprinkle some chopped walnuts on top.

Took me one bite to start ranting and raving over these. They are super easy. Definately did NOT take 20 minutes at 400. Took 17 min for me. So watch carefully. VERY Yummy!!

I am definately NOT a baker - and this was easy enough for me to whip together in about 5 minutes... and even  better - it's delicious!   I used sugar free (juice sweetened) seedless raspberry preserves.   My only advice - hold back less than half of the mixture for the topping.  And do let it cool completely before trying to cut.  THANKS!

This is a perfect and simple bar type dessert - especially with the younger crowd.   Please, please DO NOT RATE a recipe if you totally changed it.      Follow it the first try and if you do not like it then play around.......enough said.  This site is famous for this type of review

Fantastic! I couldn't find a recipe for Blueberry Bars, so I used this. I made mine with homemade Blueberry Jam and a few handfuls of fresh Blueberries! The crust turned out gorgeous- thanks for a delicious bar recipe :)

I was looking for a recipe for a snack for my son.  I made these with apricot preserves, and they were delicious.  My son doesn't like them, but maybe he's just weird because I can't get enough of them.  A suggestion: nuke the preserves in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to make them easier to spread.  I followed other suggestions to not spread the preserves all the way to the edges which worked great.  There was one spot where the preserves did touch the edge, and it was difficult to get out of the pan.  I baked them at 400 for about 20 minutes, and they're perfect.

Wow, so easy to make and so good to eat! These were wonderful. I used an 11 x 8 pan to get my bars a bit thicker and used the same cooking time. They were done in 22 minutes. The hard part is waiting for them to cool down to eat. Next time I will not add the salt but other than that, perfect!

I must have missed something with this recipe because all the reviews are ranting and raving about it but this recipe was difficult to make. I followed another reviewer's advice to sub applesauce for some of the butter and leave out a little sugar. I also subbed whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour. The dough was sticky and thick and didn't press into the pan very well and trying to carefully put it on top of the jelly was even worse and it came out all lumpy. It tasted ok especially for a healthy treat but don't plan on making this again.

Quick, delicious and very popular around here.  I made half raspberry and half apricot and liked them both.  (The apricot half was much sweeter.  I think the tang of the raspberry helps balance out the sweetness of the crust.)

This recipe was perfect! I made exactly as directed. Perfect proportions. I sprayed a 13x9 inch pan with Pam. I pressed 1/2 of the oat mixture onto the bottom of the pan.  I spread the seedless raspberry jam to 1/2 inch of the edge. Sprinkled the top with the crumbs and pressed in gently. Cooked at 400 degrees for 22 minutes and they were wonderful. They cut into perfect bars and they were not crumbly. They looked just like the picture. Great dessert tonight after a spaghetti supper and will be wonderful tomorrow morning with a cup of coffee!!

These are fantastic.  So easy to make, they look pretty, and everyone always loves these.  I've used different flavors of jam (lemon, blueberry, raspberry champagne, peach) and they always turn out delicious, you can't go wrong.

I love how easy these are to throw together!  We've used a variety of home-canned goodies like: Apple Butter, Pear Butter, Raspberry Jam, Peach Jam, etc.  They have all turned out delicious!  We get compliments wherever we take them.

These were good! I used blackberry preserves instead of raspberry. Next time I'm going to use more than one jar, as there isn't quite enough of it for my taste.

A Good Treat, but way too sweet for my taste.  Had to have a cup of milk to help wash it down.  I will try to make again and cut the sugar in 1/2, and try substituting applesauce for some of the butter.

Very good and easy to make.  No one in my family likes raspberries, so I substituted a low sugar strawberry preserves that I had on hand.  Very tasty. I also added peanuts to the top layer--it tasted like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!

Made exactly as written. They were tasty but a bit flat and unimpressive looking in the 9x13 pan. Perhaps using a smaller pan would help?

I used only 1 stick of butter and strawberry jam and they turned out great!  They taste just like NutraGrain bars.  I reduced the temp of the oven down to 325 degrees after a while to reduce how crisp they were getting on the edges.  Next time I think I'll bake them at 350 degrees instead.

I made this using quick oats, 1/2 t. salt, and seedless raspberry jam.  I used non-stick foil to line my baking dish and left foil extensions.  Once cooled, I could just lift it out of the pan.  That made for nice clean cuts.  I didn’t want to fully cover the top with the oat mixture because I wanted some of the raspberry jam to show through.  So I didn’t use the entire amount of oat mixture on top, and would cut back on that next time by about 25%.  These were very good and to jazz them up a bit, I drizzled Vanilla Glaze, also from this site, over the top.  I took these to a gathering and was asked for the recipe.

These were so easy and so good! I used fresh raspberries that I had frozen last summer, instead of the jam, but they turned out great! I will definitely make these again and again!

I baked this in an 8 inch square pan (9 by 13 would be very thin bars) Baked @ 350 for 25 minutes. I built up the crust along the edges to prevent the jam from burning around the sides. The only change I would make next time is using 3/4 tsp salt instead of 1 tsp. It was a little too salty, but DELICIOUS!

These always disappear quickly! I tweek them just a bit by adding a layer of white chocolate chips over the jam! Scruptious!

Spreading half the mixture in the bottom of a 9 X 13 pan made such a thin layer that it all was sticking to the jam and coming up off the bottom while I was trying to spread the second layer. Had to scrap the whole thing. That's what I get for choosing something I've never made for a last minute potluck.

Delicious. My Boyfriend who dislikes sweets give this two thumbs up. I played with the constancy a bit-adding applesauce and molasses/omitting oils. Watch it in the oven though cause my gas oven browned the sides too much and I checked it literally two minutes prior.

Great bars - Very easy to make.  Plenty of the oat mixture to add on the top.  I left a 1/4 Inch edge around the base where I didn't spread the jam, read how for others the jam had burnt and made them difficult to remove from the pan.  Next time I think I will press down the oats on top rather than just sprinkle, as most of mine did flake off when removing from the pan.

These were awesome!...  I used an 8x8 inch pan because I wanted them thicker and baked about 27 minutes but probably could have taken them out at 25 since they were getting pretty brown.  Delicious butter flavor and not at all too salty; I used sea salt.  Drizzled some glaze on top which gave it a weird flourescent color that I didn't love but that was my fault!.. I will definately make these again!  Oh yeah, I strained the raspberry jam because we don't like seeds. :)

these were so easy and very delish. i added a few dashes of cinnamon and vanilla. i made a foil sleeve and sprayed it w/ cooking spray, then firmly pressed down the crumb mixture, made sure to leave room at the edges when spreading the jam as others suggested, then finally sprinkled the remaining mixture on top. hubby said they tasted too good to be homemade. i will make these often w/ different jams.

L was looking for something sweet that wasn't chocolate based.  My husband loves fruit based sweets and this was no exception.  I love the fact that they taste even better the second day---assuming they stay around that long.  Like another reviewer, I also added white chocolate chips---excellent addition!

WICKED EASY to make and super tasty - they are a bit on the sweet side.  I also took other people's advice and didn't spread the preserved to the edge and cooked it for less time.  It seems soft when you take it out, but it hardens pretty quickly - but not too hard to chew.  I also didn't use 10oz of preserves, I just spread it til I thought it was an even coating of it.

I double the crust useinghalf wheat flour and half white flour(they hold together better).For the brown sugar i used Splenda Brown Sugar.Instead of Raspberry perserves i have use Homeade Blueberry,Strawberry,Strawberry Rhubarb,Apple and Whole Cranberry Sauce w/orange zest and a bit of splenda and corn starch mixed in. Jam's.Depending on what the kids want that day :)I use one recipe of crust on the bottom and top with half of the other crust.I spread(you want to stir or heat your jam just a wee bit for easier spreading)the Jam's(add a bit more jam otherwise it is more crust than filling) so they are NOT touching the outer edges by the pan to prevent burning!Then after i let them cool(about 15 minutes).I microwave(Creamy)Peanut Butter and drizzle on top.Sprinkle with Peanuts and let them cool totally before cutting.My kids love these for an after school snack or a quick on the go breakfast with fruit smoothie!Even with more crust i only bake them about 15-18 minutes.At our house these are now known as "Mom's Peanut butter and jelly bars"!

Delicious!  My son is also allergic to peanuts and milk and it is a real joy to find a great snack/treat like this.  They are really similar to nutri-grain bars and so easy to make.  I found it was easier to get a bar-like dessert by spreading the second half of the oat mixture out on wax paper and then laying it on top of the preserves rather than sprinkling it on.  Thanks a lot for this one!

Corwynn you've done it again! These are fabulous! I snuck one while they were still warm- I couldn't help it. I used those "Buttery Sticks" from Whole Foods- no trans fat & half the sat fat of butter. But you'd never know from tasting them! I also used Knott's Seedless Raspberry Jam. I might use a little less salt next time since I didn't use unsalted butter, but maybe not- because they taste pretty perfect right now! I might try a date filling- I used to love those Date Nut Bars. But let me tell you- the raspberry jam is yummy! Thanks so much, Corwynn!

I made these for my daughter to take with her on her way out the door in the mornings.  She loves them, her friends love them and now my mom asks for them on her way out the door in the mornings!!  They are a little sweet for my taste, so I'm going to try using a little less sugar.  I cut them into bars and wrap each one and stick in the freezer.  It doesn't take them long to thaw.

Followed the recipe almost exactly but used a 14 ounce jar of raspberry preserves and sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on the crumby topping. It was tasty. Will likely make again!

Very thin, and nothing special.  Tastes like a Nutrigrain bar, except not as good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a 12 x 8 pan, based on the other reviews.  I would not make these again.

We loved these! I made the recipe as stated and it didn't seem like quite enough to fill my 13x9 pan so i didn't press it all the way to the edge. Next time I will do a batch and a half for 13x9 pan.

Wonderful raspberry bars! I cut the recipe in half and baked them in an 8x8 pan.  They came out great. I also added a little vanilla and almond extract to the butter mixture.  I think next time I will add some chopped almonds.

Im 16 and on my way to be a better cook. i made these, and they were simple but they were so good (: the only thing i found was a problem is pressing it down in the pan and i didnt have quite enough for the top.

I made these with a gluten free flour mix and they were terrific!  So yummy and pleasantly chewy.  If you should need to make them with gluten free flour, be sure to add a little xanthan gum.  I didn't and mine were a little crumbly.(probably wouldn't be a problem with regular all purpose flour).  Hard to hold in the hand but otherwise perfect.

These were FANTASTIC.  So goooood!  I followed other's advice by adding a few splashes of milk to the bottom layer of mix to hold it together and I also substituted lemon juice for the water.  Super easy!  You should try it.

A classic recipe.  I used strawberry jam and homemade chunky apple sauce for the filling.  Didn't last the day!!  I do agree with the other reviews that the crumb was slightly dry.  I just added a bit more butter.

Great flavor, I've made them with raspberry and strawberry jams - both work well. The first time I made them, the dough seemed too dry so I added one egg white. The bars still came out a tiny bit crumbly (which is great if you're serving them at home, not so much if you're packing them for lunch or snacks to go), so the next time I added two egg whites, and that made them perfect for me.

I used only 3/4 cup of brown sugar, and instead of jam for the filling, I cooked some strawberries and blueberries.  I smashed them them poured them on.  It was liquidy, but got thick in the oven.

It's delicious! I replaced 1 cup of the all-purpose flour with wheat flour and used about 3/4 brown sugar with a bit of honey. I also add in a teaspoon of vanilla The treat still comes up great. I love it!  It's crunchy just to the right level, too (I baked it for only 15 minute and then let it stay in the oven for 2 more minute). I may lower the sugar and salt next time though, due to personal perferences.

these were great to pack for hiking down on the Columbia River Gorge. I used an organic raspberry jam, and it was so yummy! Will definitely make again to have on hand for camping trips as well!

Delish ! I followed other reviewers and left the borders free. The only thing I changed was that I used much, much much less jam and used a mixture of fresh berries instead, it cut the sweetness of the bars. Will make this again and already thinking of the fruit substitutions.

These are delicious!!  Followed recipe as is, but used low sugar apricot preserves because that is what I had on hand.  I followed other reviewers recommendations and left about 1/2 and inch boarder between the jam and the edge of the pan.  I also used 3/4 of dough on bottom, and the rest sprinkled on top. Superb recipe.  Thanks!

These are fantastic.  I just froze a batch for a beach trip next week.  These are buttery and wonderful.  Use any jelly you want... I used smuckers "simply fruit".  You could also add some crunched up toasted almonds to the batter too.  YUM.

These are fantastic! OH my i totally agree this recipe is a keeper! SO soft too! I love chocolate, well any sweets so here is what i did. DO not bake for more then 20 min! I added 1 tsp of coco powder, 1 tbsp of icing sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla to the crumbs. then after I layered the jam(i used a can of cranberry sauce for simplicity)i took honey and drizzled it all over, avoiding the sides though.Then put the remaining crumbs on top:)OMG! try this. I swear you wont regret it!

This was really good, I used orange marmelade because I didn't have raspberry, it was great. It wasa little too salty, I would reduce the salt next time.

Great recipe, I like to sprinkle the top with sliced almonds and mix a little almond extract in with the crust mix - it goes really well with the raspberry jam.

I used a jar of Smuckers Simply Fruit.  These were delicious. Even better heated up and adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  These would also be good with other preserves.

Everyone at work loved these.  I added a couple of tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce and it wasn't crumbly at all.  Because it was just easier to soften two sticks of butter, I increased the total of amount of crust by 25%.  Perfect!  Now that I know how good they are this way I may try to experiment to make them a little more healthy.

Great. If you want less crumbly bars, replace 1/4 of the butter with applesauce. Also, we found one cup of jam to be more than enough -- I think I would only use 3/4 cup next time. It's very easy to spread if you pop it in a bowl in the microwave for 30-40 seconds.

Oh My GOSH!  I made this (with a few changes, see below) a few days ago, and my boyfriend is obsessed, then I gave some to some friends, and they were pretty much freaking out over how great they were!  I can't stop eating them either!  I take them as snacks to work, or have them with tea for breakfast.   MMMMM!!!!!  I am going to be making these forever!    CHANGES I MADE(to the 32 serving mix):  I added a tablespoon of CINNAMON, and 1 and a half teaspoon of NUTMEG to the OAT MIXTURE.  ALSO I did 1.5 times the amount of preserves, so it was 1 jar (10oz) of BLACKBERRY PRESERVES, and half of a 10 oz RASPBERRY PRESERVES jar.  Next time I think I will add in some real blackberries, blueberries, and/or raspberries.   THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE WONDERFUL RECIPE!   oh yeah and I just "greased" the pan with PAM "for baking" and it worked great.

This has become a staple in our house. We like to add the thinly sliced or slivered almonds to the half you put on top. I prefer the consistancy when you press the top half down into the preserves, and they take about 5 minutes less in our oven. Thank you SO much.

I did make quiet a few changes though based on my taste and what I had on hand. First I used sugar free blueberry preserves instead of raspberry b/c that is what I had. Second I double the crust recipe just because I tend to like a more crust to filling ratio. I cut out all butter and substituted canola oil and applesauce instead and I used all whole wheat flour. These bars are a much better breakfast alternative to pop tarts in taste and nutrition!

I made 1.5 times the recipe in order to have enough for the top part of the bars however, it still was not enough even for an 8 x 8 pan. I would recommend doubling the recipe. If using an 8 x 8 pan, you will not need all of the jam and be sure to keep it away from the sides of the pan to keep it from burning.

OMG...another five star recipe.  Very easy to make and delicious!  I used a combination of strawberry and boysenberry jam with a touch of lemon juice added in so that it would spread easier.  Will be making this for a long time to come.

This was a real hit with my family and they asked if I could make it again before the first batch was even finished.  The only change I made was to use strawberry jam instead of raspberry.  Another time I might try it with lemon curd.

These were the right mix of crispy and chewy and very tasty! I also added a pinch of cinnamon to the crust mixture, but used plum preserves because I didn't have raspberry, and they turned out really well. Will definately make again!

Easy,buttery and delish...pieces in the middle broke apart easily so remember to make the bottom crust thicker in the middle. I added some sliced almonds to the top for extra crunch.

These are so tasty and so easy!  A nice diversion from my typical chocolate based recipes.  I had gone hog-wild making jam this year, and it's great to have another way to use up some of it.  I had one issue, maybe it's just me.  It seemed like the crust mixture was a little scant for a 9x13 pan, but way too much for an 8x8.  I had a hard time getting the bottom of the pan covered and still have enough left to sprinkle on top.  Next time, I'll either customize the recipe up or down by 25% to get the right amount of crust mixture.  Other than that, it was delicious.  This is the same recipe for making date bars as well.

Really delicious. So quick and easy to prepare. I used Strawberry preserves and would like to try again with other flavors. Thanks for a good keeper.

I was looking for a recipe for some sort of homemade breakfast option to substitute packaged granola bars, poptarts, etc...  These were  not a good match.  They were okay but VERY VERY sweet and rich.  Definitely a dessert.  And a very sweet/rich dessert at that.  I will probably use the crumble part of the recipe again as a pie topping but not to make the bars again.

I've been making these for at least a few years now because my older boy (now a college senior) insists I make them, still!  Even over my really good chocolate chip cookies!  I only make one change and that is to add a bit of cinnamon to the "crust."  One thing that makes this easier is to line the pan with aluminum foil and butter the foil.  Then, when they are done, just lift the bars in the foil out of the pan and no chiseling (as one reviewer mentioned).  Also spread the jelly to not quite hit the edges, maybe a 1/4" buffer, because the jelly spreads a bit and sticks to the edges of the pan/foil, making it harder to remove the bars.  These are absolutely delicious!!  Thank you!

Excellent!  Made them with orange marmalade.  I cut temp to 375 for 17 minutes in electric oven.  Otherwise, followed instructions.

These are super good.  Might be slightly on the sweet side for those that don't care for sweet.  I made as written with the only exception of using fresh raspberries because they are in season and sooo good.  I used about 3/4 pint and just mashed them with a fork.  The end product looked and tasted excellent.  I chopped them into small bars and refrigerated them.  I think they taste best cold with a nice cup of coffee.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

Seriously delicious.  However, mine didn't stick together well enough to cut into bars.  I used it as a crumbly topping on ice cream, and it was fantastic for that.  But I guess I'll keep looking for an actual bars recipe.  (I followed the recipe to a T.)

I didn't have raspberry preserves so I used strawberry. After they baked, I spread a layer of melted white chocolate on top to make them more of a dessert. The results were great and they were like a strawberry pop-tart.

I used olallieberry preserves from Berkeley Bowl because I had it around.  Very tasty and flavorful bars, but I did think they were too greasy and a bit too salty.  I would cut down on the butter and use applesauce in place of some of the butter.

I was looking for an oatmeal cookie with a jammy filling so I varied from the original just a bit: I threw in two eggs after creaming the butter/sugar and some vanilla. After blending the dry, I got a nice cookie batter. I spread 3/4 of the batter in an 8X8 square pan, which I greased and lined with parchment, then spread my jam (cherry, raspberry, blackberry) then dropped the remaining batter overtop in spoonfuls.  I spread the dollops the best I could, and popped it in the oven @ 350 for 22 mins. Absolutely DELISH!

Very tasty. Left the jam in the middle, about 1/2" from the edge. I probably would have added a little more moisture to the batter -- it was quite dry. The topping wasn't 'crumbly' as I would have liked. Other than that, very good, something I'd make again with some minor tweaks!

Not one was left at work or at home by the next day. the top was a little bit crumbly, but that could have just been me measuring. I didn't have a problem with the jam burning. Although, my jam was homemade.

These where good, but a little too salty. Next time I will cut the salt in half, add more brown sugar and maybe some white chocolate on top. (wasn't sweet enough for me.)

Yuummmmyyyy!! :)I halved the recipe but other than that followed it exactly. It was a bit crumbly, as many other reviewers have stated, but it was so good I did not care one bit! I'm anxious to try it with different preserves but the raspberry was excellent!

I like this, but am fighting the urge to put some frosting drizzled on top, like it needs some extra something.  I bet it would be very good warm with ice cream on top!

These are lovely.  I made the dough in advance and froze it.  The day before I planned to bake them, I let the dough defrost in the refrigerator.  I then used about 2/3 of the dough for the bottom layer, spread on the preserves, and crumbled the remaining 1/3 on the top.  These are fragile but a nice refreshing change.

I prefer blackberry jam and I really like this recipe.  It comes out crispy and it reminds me just a little of pop tarts, but healthier.

Mmmmmmm : ) These were yummy! I added 3 tbsp of peanut butter to the sugar butter mixture and used seeded raspberry jam and it turned out really well.. Also added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture - YUM! I'll def make these again, though I think next time I'll add a bit more of the oat mixture as I was a bit short for the top half! And I baked on a slightly lower temp to avoid the jam burning... Fabulous!

The hubby loves them but says to use less butter next time. They're VERY crumbly though.. can't make the bars that'd be handy.  However, they're tasty.

Quite tasty and really easy to make. I used  half white wheat flour and half all purpose flour to get the total 1 1/2, just to make it a little healthier. A 8 in. pan was perfect for me, since I like thicker layers. I will use less sugar next time, especially since the preserves were sweet on their own. Careful not to use too much preserves, it can taste like a glob of jelly otherwise--I just spread them on until I thought it was covered enough. I might try wheat germ and cinnamon additions next time. Thanks for the recipe, I love oats in anything!

One of my favorite sweet snacks!

Very easy to sub in whatever jam/fruit you are in the mood for. My personal favorite is a rhubarb/strawberry compote!
Also try adding in pecans and coconut to the topping - they toast up quite nicely and add a lot of flavor.

These were so good.  I used whole wheat flour because that is all I had and added a handful of chopped walnuts to the brumble topping.  Served them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Delicious.  They need to cool completely before they are cut.

LOVE these... and so do my 22-month-old twins. Will have to try carrots like the other reviewer mentioned. One note, I did microwave my preserves for a few seconds so that they would spread easier (they had been refrigerated) but otherwise everything worked beautifully. I will definitely be making these often!

Oh My Goodness these were Mmmmm mmmm good!  Replaced 2/3 of the white flour with whole wheat flour, some ground flax seed & some some wheat germ. (But kept all the butter required, of course).  Used my homemade cranberry preserves that was from the cranberry juice I made a couple of weeks ago.  Added a little vanilla and lemon zest in the crust mixture.    

Also changed the serving size from 24 to 36.  This was just perfect for a lasagna size pan.  Plenty of crust.  Baked at 375 for 20 minutes.  Family & neighbors sucked them up! Definite keeper!

mmmm soo good. You might laugh though at how i went about making these. My son who is 19mo old refuses to eat vegetables, so i steamed some carrots and pureed them..added some brown sugar and cinnamon and cooked them until the sugar had time to thicken it into a preserve. Then instead of adding a jelly or preserve i added the carrots. they are soo good and even my husband cannot tell that they are carrots. thanks for the recipe..now my son will eat veggies, albeit with a little sugar..to me its worth it.

I was one of the people who didn’t have enough dough to form a bottom crust and still have enough for the crumb top.  I tried to get as thin a layer as possible on the bottom and I still ended up adding more oats and flour so there would be something to crumble.  Maybe this recipe would be better in an 8-inch square pan.  They tasted good but were too much hassle to make work so I think I will try another recipe next time.

These are great bars; I made with a 12 oz jar of sugar free strawberry jelly, in an 8x11 1/2" pan, they were thick and buttery and yummy. We demolished 1/3 of the pan right after dinner, still warm. Reminded me of cobbler. Intended for cookie trays, will have to make more.

These are really yummy.  Next time the only thing that I'll change is I'll make a little more of the oat mixture so the crust is thicker on the bottom.  I'm a huge raspberry fan, but I'm going to try these with all different flavors of preserves.  Great recipe!

These are super easy and everyone seems to like them! I will definitely make them again. I used more like 2/3 of the oats/butter/flour mixture on the bottom, just to be sure the jam didn't leak through.

Great easy recipe with a great outcome! I always read reviews prior to making new recipes, so I did get some great tips. I made the recipe as is but added white chocolate chips to the "crumble topping," placed a small piece of parchment paper on the bottom of the baking dish (after greasing the pan) to prevent from sticking and baked at 400° for 18 minutes instead of 20-25 minutes as directed. Super yummy can't wait to share with my family!

Taste really good. Crumbly. Jam tastes wonderful but careful not to spread too close to end edge of the pan.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I had fresh raspberries on hand so I crushed them instead of using preserves.  I also took the suggestion of substituting applesauce for part of the butter and using less sugar, to cut calories, but either way would be delicious.  I agree about closely watching the bake time and avoiding the edge when spreading the filling.  Great recipe!

Very good recipe. Made exactly as written. This time I bumped up the crust to 2 cup flour and oatmeal. And added to all the other ingredients. I also added blueberrys (fresh). Will let you know how it turns out. )I have so many blueberrys this year. )

This recipe is delicious, but I must admit that I did add an egg and a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the oatmeal dough.   My instincts were right on.

Every single friend and family I have requests this recipe at least once a year. I almost feel like I'm cheating because it's so easy. Lessons learned from making it 100 times- 1) ALWAYS make double the crumble. You need to make sure that the base is nicely pressed and thick enough to hold the next layer, otherwise it falls apart. 2) pick the best preserve you can find for the flavor you want. Seeds are you enemy when eating this bar. I've tried red raspberry, black raspberry, strawberry, black berry, and mixed berry. The final product always depends on if the seeds have been taken out. 3) Press the top layer slightly before baking. Make sure the bar is a solid piece before baking if you want it to keep its shape when cutting.     Enjoy the praise you get from this simple, beautiful recipe. Finds like these are rare.

Delicious enough to have for dessert and healthy enough to have for breakfast! I've made these several times now, using all different kinds of jelly/preserves and they are always a hit.  Today I was having PB&J cravings, so I used creamy peanut butter and a bit of apple jelly in the filling... Delicious!

Made these for a pot luck.  Lots of raves & most want the  recipe.  Today my husband  tried them today.  He said" MMM these are yummy".  I think my mother-in-law made these years ago but she used Solo Date & Nut s for the filling.

These were amazing, and you can use any preserves you want; I chose blackberry. More like a dessert than a granola bar, I'm afraid to make them again because I know I will eat them all! Thank you!

These were delicious and exactly what I was looking for - just the right balance of crunch and tenderness. I used 8 oz apricot jam (warmed in the microwave for easier spreadability),  and I already have ideas for other preserves!

Perfection!  BUT not enough crumbs for base and top.  Double crumb recipe for 9x13 or leave it be and do a 9" square.  Top Rack, 375 for 30 mins.  That is all.

I've made this recipe a few times and always it was too sweet because of the preserves so I improved on it, I caramelized some pears and put in some fresh blackberries and it was amazing, also with the preserves I put some granny Smith apples to counter the sweetness of the preserves and it was delicious

Just made these bars.  Very tasty!  I added a little milk to help hold all the oats mixture together.  And I only baked for 18 minutes.  Probably could use any flavor jam.  Delicious!!

Made these with GLUTEN FREE flour and certified gluten free oats. They are outstanding! I added a 1/4 tsp. xantham gum to the flour/oat mix because my gluten free flour mix didn't already have it. These are fool proof though! Thanks for the incredibly delicious recipe!

My mom had made these bars for more than 40 years.  A few important things that will help soooo much. First temp is too high, 350 is fine we always used a glass pan.  Second she used a little more than half of oat mixture, pressed in the pan and baked for 7 minutes before spreading jam. Third keep jam away from edges when spreading on cooled crust.  Last, we kind of dropped small clumps of remaining oat mixture over jam and lightly pressing down. The jam was never completely covered, maybe 80 percent.  It made bars look prettier with color coming thru.  When Mom was making these for church or a cookout, she trimmed edges all around and served 1 inch by 2 inch bars.  Guess who got the edges on those times????  Now I do the same thing. LOL

I added 1/4 cup of peanut butter to the dough.  Then for the topping I added about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans prior to sprinkling it over the jam.  When I took it out of the oven I used the back of the spatula and gave the topping a gentle press down into the hot jam filling before leaving it to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. I tried it with seedless raspberry jam, going to try peach or apricot next time. For sure a new family and office favourite!!

I've made this recipe three times. Today, I didn't have any raspberry jam. So, I used cherry and added one teaspoon almond extract to the cherry jam.  Then, I thought why not chop some almonds and add to the dough.  So 1/2 cup chopped almonds went in.  I love the versatility of this recipe.

Love these, I added a half cup of wheat germ, a half cup of coconut flakes, and traded 1 cup of white flour for 1 cup of wheat flour. I added about 1tbls of melted butter to compensate for the extra dry ingredients. Turned out great.

I did make a few changes, but love the concept and appreciate having a starting place for my own. I used unsweetened applesauce instead of butter, 1/2 cup homemade raspberry jam, 9X9 dish, and 375 degrees. Will make again!

I took some other reviewers' suggestions and cut the sugar in half. I also subbed 1/2 cup peanut butter for some of the butter because I was in the mood for something peanut-buttery. Also kept the preserves 1/2 inch from the edge of the pan as suggested. They turned out great. The top was a bit crumbly but still held together nicely. This is a good recipe to play with using different types of preserves and adding nuts, whatever. You can make it your own.

Turned out perfect following the recipe.  Easy to cut up and come out of the baking pan perfect.  I definitely will bake these again, especially for Christmas.

I didn't change a thing, just cut the recipe in half and used a smaller pan because I didn't have enough raspberry preserves for a 9x13in. panful. Very filling but very good.

Made as directed these are delicious. I can't understand why anyone would cut back on the butter though (I actually added a little). Adding a touch of Madagascar Bourbon vanilla is a great idea..think I'll try it next time. Great recipe!

I have made this at least 5 times in the last couple months.  It is FANTASTIC.  I eat dairy free so I subbed the butter with canola oil but everything else is by the recipe.  I remind myself that this recipe has no eggs in it so when I am baking it, it's more like heating it just enough to melt the brown sugar and getting the edges a light golden brown.  Any longer than that and the bars come out crunchy or burned so don't overdo it.  My last pan I baked for less than 17 minutes and each bite melts in my mouth.  I will make this forever.

The first time I made these bars, I used strawberry jam.  I have tried it since with different jams.  (Smucker's makes a big variety of spreadable fruits that are perfect for these bars.)  Any that I have made have been delicious.

Yum!  I made the recipe using the instant oatmeal packets (4 of them) because I had ran out of the other. It worked just fine and was yummy. I took a stick of butter and rubbed it all over the glass pan and I had no problem with sticking. I also only baked it for about 15 minutes, maybe a little more. It was sweet, but pairs well with coffee or cold milk. My kids loved it!

While I consider this definitely more of a dessert than a snack bar because of its sweetness, it was still very very good, and I will make them again!

We love this recipe! Quick and easy- my grand-kids love to make these bars. we have tried all flavors of jams/preserves and all are great but the filling we all seem to like best is peanut-butter! i have just spread it straight  from the jar and also have mixed it with a little powdered sugar before spreading, either way, we love it! these bars are now expected whenever we take a long distance road trip-great with coffee/tea and milk! thanks so much!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exa tly but felt something was missing. I ended up needing 1.5 times recipe for dough because there wasn't enough to cover the bottom of the pan. It turned out crumbly and just not right, although what I did get out of the pan tasted ok. So I remade it using the exact recipe, an 8 x8 pan and adding an egg. Perfect!

These were delicious! The only thing I added was 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the crumble mixture. I advise cutting these into small-ish-sized cookies, because they're a little heavy in a larger size. However, these were my favorite holiday cookies that I made this year!

These bars are awesome! I changed the recipe just a bit by still using 3/4th cup of butter (here's a tip- I had run out of unsalted butter so I had to use salted...if you're ever in that situation, leave out the salt in this recipe) but added about 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and a little less than a cup(packed) of dark brown sugar. I also added vanilla to the wet ingredients making sure to mix them on high for about 5 minutes to get a great whipped consistently. I used 1 3/4 cups of oats and the original 1 1/2 c of flour. Since oats are high in protein and heart healthy, I'm a HUGE fan of them. The batter was sticky, but that's to be expected. I used the 9 x 13 pan, placed half the dough in the bottom and kept working it out to the edges. I really needed about 3/4the of the dough to cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. I really think this recipe needs to be in a smaller pan or a double batch. Since I needed to make another batch to finish covering the top I tried putting some in a jumbo muffin tins and filled each with different fillings; craisins infused with pomegranate, chocolate chips with walnuts, and white chocolate chips and coconut...they baked much faster (check on them 10 mins into baking). One other tip, if you want to make 2 different kinds of bars, just spread your preserves to the halfway point in your pan and if the color is similar put a toothpick in it to differentiate what side is what flavor. Once cool, cut the bars and seperate them by flavor.

I can only speak to the crumble part since I made my own apricot filling (1 can drained apricots mashed and cooked with 1/4 c. apricot preserves and 1 T. sugar). I liked this recipe a lot. I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, substituted 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for 1/2 c. of the all purpose flour and omitted the salt. I baked them in a glass pan for 30 minutes at 375. The cookies were delicious. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe was really easy to make and it leaves room for a lot of experimenting. I made a batch with a Nutella and Almond Butter center, but they hardened a lot faster than the jam-filled ones. I used Raspberry jam for the last few, and it is a real winner - I might try Blueberry next. I also took the advice of one reviewer and cut the butter by 1/4 and substituted apple sauce for it - it make the bars a little bit softer and chewier and definitely made the creaming process a lot easier! I did find that I had to leave the bars overnight before I could cut them because they fell apart. I also put in some sliced almonds into the batter, and added crushed pecans and shredded coconut to the topping. It was delicious!! I urge you all to try adding what you love best to these simple bars to make them your own!

This really is super quick- and delicious. Used blueberry preserves and a little orange zest, and margarine instead of butter. Lined the pan with foil and sprayed with canola oil, but the foil probably wasn't even necessary. Baked for 16 minutes and they were perfect. Warm from the oven, they'd be great with ice cream. Can't wait to try this recipe with other types of preserves.

VERY yummy!  The only problem I had was that it was a bit crumbly and falling apart, but the taste makes up for that.  I used sugar-free strawberry preserves, and it was very tasty.  I followed other reviewers and baked at 375 and kept the filling about 1/2 inch from the edges. Very good.

THIS was EXACTLY what I was looking for. It was so simple and I had all the ingredients on hand. I spread my jam to about 1/2" from the edges so I didn't burn the jam. I also used strawberry preserves and it was SO GOOD! If only I had some ice cream put on top!!

This was yummy.  I used some whole grain flour and some oat bran, so it was crumbly - but yummy.  I also used 100% fruit spread, to limit the sugar.  Both young boys liked it so much.  My 3 yr old calls it cake! ;)

This was ok - given its simplicity and lack of ingredients, you shouldn't be surprised that it's pretty average.  It's very easy to make but doesn't wow you.  Probably won't make again.

Excellent buttery taste! I make them during the holidays as a nice balance to all the chocolate goodies.

These bars are fabulous!  I made mine with strawberry jam and they came out great.  The recipe was so quick and easy!  These could probably even be made in an 8X8 inch pan for a thicker bar.  This is definitely a keeper.
