First time trying this recipe. We put ground quinoa instead of white flower and the results were Amazing!!!!  
My husband and I, having never experienced a meat free "loaf" before were pleasantly surprised at the texture and the Taste.  So much that we took the time to write this review... our first ever.

Definitely adding to our favs list!

My family really enjoyed this! Both my husband and son commented on how good it tasted.  My son & his family are making it tomorrow again.  I added about 1 cup of fresh chopped parsley.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added a bit of water for consistency after I'd mixed everything together.  I used dried sage and Italian spice mix instead of dried basil. 

Bake it covered for the first round.  I put all the sauce on it instead of some and serving the rest.  Mmmmm.

I made an AR account to share my take on this amazing dish. I told my gf that I was making a "faux loaf" and it turned out bangin'. I didnt have any ketchup so I used A1 sauce. It was a good decision but it was a just a little over the top. 
100% would make again. My only tiff is that the directions never specified how to chop the mushrooms. So i quartered them. It worked out great. They had a fun texture and I love the taste of mushrooms. I would say the original intention was to coarsely chop them. Also no directions as far as when to add the flax seed mixture. I just mixed it with the cooked lentils and the veggies. No problems.  
Seriously it was a great meal.

It's amazing. I did not change the loaf recipe at all, except that I could not find brown lentils and used green with no issue

I didn't have any mushrooms, so I used orange peppers instead and it was really good!   Can't wait to try it with mushrooms next time.

Very good but I would definitely say to omit the sugar in the glaze or at least half it. There’s enough sugar in ketchup and bbq sauce. The directions don’t mention the flax egg but u do need to mix in with the lentil oat mixture. You also need to spray your loaf pan with cooking spray. I also think this could be cooked a little longer to get a more firm/crunchy exterior.

I got a bit more expressive with the spices and didn't add the sweet ingredients but this ended up tasting like a Thanksgiving dressing.  I'd make it many times over.

Followed the recipe as written except I added about 1/2 T Worcestershire sauce to glaze as others have recommended. It turned out great (if not a bit dense) according to my vegan daughter. Will try doubling the recipe next time to make two loaves at once since it is a little labor intensive.

This was delicious. I don't eat mushrooms so I chopped up some carrots and green pepper instead and it was great. I had trouble getting it to firm up in the oven and I think I just needed to let the lentils sit and absorb more moisture before I mixed them in with the rest of the ingredients. Will definitely make again.

I really liked this recipe.  Since I stopped eating beef, I like having a dish the texture of meatloaf but with a earthy lentil flavor. Plus the ketchup, mustard bbq sauce topping (minus the brown sugar) added a nice tang and moisture.  My husband added some leftover turkey gravy, but I didn't think it needed anything more.  I forgot to add flour and it still held together just fine.

I just made this and wow a vegan dish that tasted great without crazy ingredients!!! The only thing I had to change due to an oat allergy was to use panko bread crumbs. Thank you for the recipe!

Wow
First time making this and it was amazing!
I added the flax/water in during step 5 since I didn't see it written down anywhere else and I already knew (through earlier research on Veganism) that it is an egg substitute so it made the most sense there :)
Definitely will make this again and again.
Thank you so much for sharing!!

New recipes require a bit more time and paying attention the first time around.  This lentil loaf is so worth it.  It is delicious for sure and it's hard to tell the difference between using ground beef and lentils.  The glaze is to die for.  I did make a few changes that turned out really well because I did not have the exact ingredients.

I did not have mushrooms so I mashed in half of a large cooked yam.  I also used an egg instead of the flax seed and water.  

My glaze was made with ketchup, brown sugar, Grey Poupon mustard and teriake sauce.  Yum.  I used all of the sauce on top of the loaf and did not save any out for dipping.  

I want to incorporate more plant based foods in my diet and I will be making this again for sure.  It's great for leftovers just like regular meatloaf is.

Pretty good but could have used more seasonings, and probably more salt but less pepper. Would also bake it a bit longer.

This is so good!!  I threw in a minced bell pepper too, just to use it up.  I think next time I might add a little worcestershire but it is delicious just as written.

I have tried many "meat loaf" alternatives and this is by far the best.  Made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using garbanzo bean flour instead of white flour.  My wife likes meat loaf sandwiches and yes this is even good cold.  This recipe will surely become part of our regular rotation.
