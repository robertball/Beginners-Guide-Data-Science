This soup is simply wonderful.  I didn't make any changes.  Since it made so many servings, I froze about 2/3 of what the recipe made...and I was quite pleased to find the leftovers in the freezer yesterday.

I was really surprised by how much I like this. Does make a ton of soup, so half the batch went into the freezer for dinner next week.

This was so good. The salsa verde really made the flavor of this soup unique and delicious. It was easy to make, too. I'll definitely be keeping this one in the rotation through the winter.

This was really good... and I was very skeptical! If I was to do-over, I would leave out the angel hair because the potatoes were enough starch. I also didn't have any salsa verde so I used canned green peppers which was a nice kick and very tasty. I crumbled up some chips and put on top of each bowl before serving. I don't think this will become one of our "regular" dinners, but we ate all of it and enjoyed it!
