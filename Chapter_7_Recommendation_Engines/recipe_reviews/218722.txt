These are the ultimate comfort food. I love braised short ribs and this one is a definite keeper. I made 3 changes. I could not find any bone in short ribs at the store so I bought some nice lean boneless beef short ribs. I also reduced the barbecue sauce to 3/4 cup.....just because my hubby is a healthy type II diabetic and we cut sugar where we can. I also braised these in the oven at a lower temp 275 for 5 hours. I like a long and slow braise on short ribs. I served these over fluffy mashed potatoes with a salad on the side and a nice pinot noir. These were absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. For those inclined to throw these in a slow cooker.....do NOT skip the browning steps. They are key to a richer flavored sauce and rib. Thanks Valerie. These are on my A+ list.

This was fabulous!  It was just my husband and me so I used four ribs totaling about 2 lbs.  Cut the sauce ingredients in half.  Served with mashed potatoes a salad.  This gravy over the mashed potatoes was unbelievably good and the meat tasted wonderful and cut with a fork.  We both wished that I had cooked six ribs and we would have eaten more!  Thanks for a recipe that I will return to often.

What a great recipe!  I did reduce the amount of BBQ sauce just because I did not have enough - I didn't measure just put in what I had.  I had to leave the house - so after browning the ribs and getting them ready to go I braised them in the oven at 200 degrees for about 5 - 6 hours.  They were very tender and flavorful.  I served these with mashed potatoes and butternut squash.  A perfect meal.  Thanks Valerie.

So good! My first time cooking short ribs after seeing them prepared on the food network channel. I found this recipe and decided to try it as it had such great reviews, and so glad that I did. So good that I wish that I had prepared more. The gravy is so delicious with my potatoes, and kale was cooked to complete the meal. Will make this again!

Not bad but not good enough to make again. It was a little too sweet for me with just a one note flavor: barbecue sauce. The meat was tender and delicious but the sauce was not my thing.

My husband loved these short ribs. He is such a pain to cook for, hates anything new! But he just ate these up and asks for me to make them again.

These ribs are simply AMAZING ! This is an easy recipe to make, My 13 yr old daughter made this for a family gathering and loved the well deserved compliments. I put liquid smoke in a small plastic spray bottle and mist the ribs a bit while browning them...that is an easy way to give meat an outside flavor when cooking indoors. This is great with homemade mashed potatoes. And be warned...your guests will eat 2X what they normally do so make a lot.

Thanks Valerie for a MAJOR winner...this should have a 10 star rating!

Super yummy! Folllowed recipe pretty much exactly as posted and can't think of a thing that could improve it. Served over steamed basmati rice - perfect! Cut large carrots in about 1" slices, as I wasn't sure what "chunks" were. They cooked just right without getting mushy.

I thought this was great. Reminded me of good ol home cookin, really rich and hearty in flavor. Awesome with mashed potatoes. My husband wasn't a fan, but he'll eat anything except pot roast ( and this was very much reminiscent of pot roast so I guess thats why.) I used 3.5 lbs country stlye short ribs and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Seared/browned the ribs on all sides, then threw in the crockpot on low for about 7 hours. I'd make again!!

This sauce is fantastic!  The carrots are sooooo good!  Don't make the same mistake I made though; I halved the recipe and used boneless country-style pork ribs and still followed the recipe time-my ribs were a touch on the dry side.  My fault, can't ding the recipe for that.  Otherwise, nom, nom, nom!!!  Will for sure make again!

The house smelled wonderful as this baked in the oven, did not change a thing and the sauce did thicken enough to use on mashed potatoes.

Good main dish for a cold winter night.  I made it with only 3 lbs of short ribs, as there are only two of us. I think I will used less beef broth next time, though, so the sauce is a little thicker.  I will also take the cover off for the last hour or so of baking.

I did not have carrots so just went without them.  Used Sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Turned out fantastic!  Ribs were very tender, came apart with a fork.  Will make any for sure, will probably mess around and add a bit of hot sauce and other stuff just to kick it up a bit
Whole family loved it except for the youngest, he was adamant that they were not ribs as they did not have the right bones, I used braising ribs as that is what I had.

I did not use the carrots, but kept the rest of the ingredients as is.  I cooked mine in the slow cooker for for about 5 to 6 hours and they fell off the bone!  Good flavor and easy to fix.

Beef short ribs are hard to find and expensive!  I only could afford 2 lbs, and it fed 4 people with mashed potatoes, a soup and a salad.  Everyone enjoyed the braised ribs.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I feel like it lacked some flavor.  Cooked it for 5 hours at 275, because real braising takes a long long time. :) BF loved it, will make it for him again.

We loved this recipe.  The ribs were fall off the bone tender when done and had great flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly except skipped the carrots because I didn't have any on hand.  I will definitely make again!

I modified the recipe by adding a dry rub.  I put 2 tablespoons of peppercorns and 3 tablespoons of my dried used morning coffee grinds in a spice grinder for a few seconds.  I applied a liberal amount of rub to the ribs before browning them in the dutch oven.  I followed the recipe in every other way.

The ribs were amazing, and the leftover sauce over crusty bread is phenominal.

I love this recipe. It was great alongside mashed sweet potatoes and salad. I took it out at 2.5 hours but the meat was still a bit tough so I threw it back in the oven for an additional 2 hours and it became so tender. It was even great the next day (heated on the stovetop for about 10 minutes). Next time, I'll lower the temperature to 275 and cook it for 4.5 hours.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic!!  I cooked slow-cooked the ribs at 275, per other reviews, in a dutch oven. I also followed the advice of other users and floured the ribs before browning them. As a result, I had to rinse out my dutch oven before adding the vegetables to prevent the browned bits from smoking.  I also reduced the amount of barbecue sauce to 1/4 cup and am so glad I did because, even with the reduced amount, the barbecue flavor was distinct. I think the sauce could be left out entirely and the flavor would still be excellent. Next time I would add some celery, although doing so might make the dish too large for my dutch oven, in which case I will switch to my slow-cooker and cook on low for about 6 hours. I served this over brown rice pasta and it was amazing!!  I noticed that some people found the dish too fatty. Short ribs are, by nature, fatty; however, if you cook the dish the night before and place it in the refrigerator, you can easily remove all of the fat from the sauce and the flavor is even better the next day!

I drop out the barbeque sauce and put in 1/4-1/2 cup mustard. After cooking like the recipe says, I coat the ribs with barbeque sauce and toss them under the broiler for about 10-15 minutes, turning every 5 minutes.

I made substitutions for the tomato sauce and broth. I added vinegar and spices to reduce the sweet character of the BBQ sauce and the carrots. 

Great recipe that works with most any cut of beef.

I halved this recipe using only 3 short ribs. Browned the short ribs well on all sides. I was concerned the sauce seemed rather bland when I first mixed it, but after the short ribs braised in it for a couple of hours -- amazing! I served the meat & sauce over noodles. Delicious recipe -- a keeper.

These are wonderful!
I made with the recipe and added a tablespoon of brown sugar to help temper the initial tomato taste. I also deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of wine after the vegetables were sautéed. The sauce cooked out nice and thick and very rich flavor. It was easy and very delicious.

Turned out great, even my 3 year old had three helpings!  Only changes I made were adding a slash of red wine, a little oregano and basil. I made about 3 pounds of short ribs but still made the full amount of sauce the recipe called for.  Will definitely make it again!

I made this following the recipe as written, with one addition. I found the sauce a little too sweet & tomatoey for our taste, so added in 1/2 tbsp of "Rooster" chile sauce to cut the sweet & add a little heat. Served over garlic mashed. It turned out really well!

I will definitely will make it again, but I used this as a starting point and added a few things. I loved the idea of letting carrots cook with the barbecue beef, nice touch!  I browned the onions, garlic and beef as written in the recipe.  I made my own sauce instead of using prepared sauce and let the ribs cook in that sauce a slow cooker for 6 hours. For the sauce I stirred together in the crock pot: 1/3 C dark honey, 1/4 c dark molasses, 1 -14.5 oz can petite diced tomatoes, 3 baby sweet peppers finely diced, 2 t beef flavor "Better than Bouillon", 2t apple cider vinegar,  1T paprika, 2t hot paprika, 2t all spice, 1t cardamom, 1t hot pepper flakes, 1T dried thyme leaves, 1 bay leaf. They were tender & tasty but not too sweet.  PS: Take out the bay leaf before serving. ;)

I had high hopes for this one, but it turned out greasy and had an overpowering taste of barbecue sauce. The mashed potatoes were the best thing on our plates. I spooned off most of the grease, then had to add a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken it up. Won't be making this again.

Definitely a keeper!  For years I've had a quick go-to recipe for bone-in or boneless short ribs where I would brown them up and pour a bottle of barbeque sauce + 1 cup water over them and either crock pot them for 8 - 10 hours or bake them, covered for 2-3 hours.  I have made this All Recipes version with its "enhanced" sauce (tomato sauce and beef broth) and additions of the carrots and onions a few times now  -- and its still so fast and easy, but it really is a cut above my old stand-by and the added flavor is amazing.  I've used both bone-in and boneless ribs and enjoy either with no compromise of taste.  When I use the slow cooker, I brown the ribs and put them in the crock, then brown the onions and carrots for a few minutes in the same pan.  I  add all the sauce ingredients to the pan, bring the sauce to a boil making sure to scrape up the fond (browned bits) at the bottom of the pan, and then add the sauce to the crock.  Slow cooking times can be 4 hours on high or 8 -10 hours on low.  As stated by others, browning the meat really adds a depth of flavor so don't skip that step.  An added benefit to this recipe....I have a couple of little ones that don't like carrots but go crazy for the carrots in this dish.  This has replaced my old go-to!

This turned out really good! I did 2 lb. of short ribs instead of 5 lb., but adjusted to 8 oz tomato sauce and 1/2 cup BBQ sauce, but did 50% more beef broth (12 oz) since I also added 3 diced potatoes (I sautéed the potatoes with the carrots and onion). Next time I'll do 6 potatoes instead, and maybe adjust the broth and BBQ sauce accordingly. Even with increasing the broth by 50%, the sauce turned out plenty thick. The sauce didn't overpower with BBQ flavor so if you like BBQ flavor, you'd want to up that. I cooked it in a crockpot on low for 7 hours. All things considered this turned out excellent. I'm sure I'll make it again.

Tenderness and flavor had my wife humming as she was taking her 1st bite.  I apologized to her as I served her for the bone falling away from the meat.  Slight modification,  will use a low sodium beef broth and reduce the cooking time by 15 minutes.

One word: yum!
This dish tastes like slow cooked barbecue that has been on a lot longer than 2.5 hours. My husband and I both love this recipe. and it's versatile! Basically you can use any cut of beef though it might work for most meats but I've only tried with beef thus far. 
I didn't have enough beef short ribs the first time so I tossed some unknown cuts of beef from the freezer. Those chuck steak bits were so good that the second time I bought almost 3 pounds of just chuck steak and it was awesome!
You also are not limited to veggies. Go crazy! Carrots are obvious but I've used sweet peppers, bell peppers, onion, celery to great success.
I'll have to try potatoes, rutabaga, parsnip, crimini mushrooms, and pumpkin or squash next. In some combination most veggies could possibly be used. I also add spices too so this recipe is limited only by your imagination.

A flavorful recipe that is easy to prepare.  My husband loved it.  I followed the recipe with just one exception.  I tasted the mixed sauce before putting it in the oven.  It seemed a bit vinegary so I added 3 Tbs. of brown sugar.  It may have been the particular barbecue sauce I used influenced the taste.  This recipe is a keeper.  I served it with mashed potatoes on the side.  I will make this dish again.  Thanks, Valerie, for providing the recipe to this delicious meal.

Great, way better the next day. Did it in the slow cooker. Put it in the fridge overnight after cooking to make it easy to remove the fat.I cut the recipe in half, which feeds two people twice. At least two people with normal appetites!

These were good but VERY greasy.  Made them exactly as the recipe calls for except for the cooking method. I sort of took the first reviewer's advice and cooked them low and slow but I started them at 300 the first 2.5 hours and then lower at 275 for another two in my dutch oven with the lid on. They were so tender that if you pressed down on them with a fork they shredded. But there were puddles of grease in the pan -- deep ones -- and I didn't feel great after dinner because of it. Not sure how to avoid this. I pan had no grease when I put them into the oven.

Tasted very similar to something I have had before.  The sauce took over the flavour so much that you couldn't taste the meat.

I used this recipe to help me recreate a dish I had at a restaurant the other night.    I only used about a 1/2 cup of each onion and carrot diced along with two cloves of garlic for flavoring.  I added to the sauce about 1/4 cup of molasses and about 4 tablespoons of honey to sweeten the sauce up more.  Since I had a couple portabella mushroom caps to use up, I added those sliced when I had one hour remaining to cook.  I served this on a bed of cream cheese polenta, with diced parsnip and a gremolata garnish.  Mission accomplished:  Delish!

The meat was very tender, but the sauce was a little too much like a baked-bean base for my preference. My husband didn’t agree - he practically licked his plate!

Will definitely make again! Made the recipe exactly as directed and it was delicious.  My family loved it. The meat was very tender. The BBQ sauce gives is nice hint of flavor but not overpowering.

It was very good! I checked the ribs at the 1.5 hour mark and they were pretty tough so I turned over done to 300 and cooked for another hour and they were delicious!

I pretty well followed the recipe except cut back on the barbecue sauce and it was great. I served it with orzo which has become a keeper for me of late.

Followed every part of this as written except I used shredded carrots rather than chunks. I like them better. 

Husband called it "Michelin star quality",  lol. Even if it's really not it came out PERFECT! I braised for 2 hours with some stirring at 1 hour. Beef fell apart with just a fork and served over garlic mashed potatoes? Divine!!

Loved it.  Used 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce because that's all I had left.  Added mushrooms and my family could not get enough!! My boyfriend took some french bread and sopped up the sauce that was left in the pot.  I used a dutch oven to cook this in and it was superb.  I love it and will be adding this to my lineup of meals.  I made mashed potatoes, salad, green beans.  All I can say is Yum, Yum!

I made this for my family and they loved it! I did tweak it a bit though. My husband doesn’t like things very sweet so I only used half a cup of bbq sauce and substituted the other half with a small can of Rotel Mexican tomatoes. I omitted the beef broth only because the one I bought had the safety seal removed ugh! It was super yummy and everyone had seconds.

I increased the liquids amount proportionally to cover the ribs fully and cooked uncovered for the last 1/2 hr. to thicken the sauce. I also had to skim fat off but that might have been the choice of ribs. The next time I would choose a sauce that was not so sweet or add a little vinegar and mustard to tone the sweetness down. My family loved it . Two had it over rice and Two had it with mashed spuds.

The flavor in these was nice. I added a few potatoes and after braising cooked in crockpot on low for 7 hours. Very tender, but it seemed like there was so much grease. Perhaps it was just my ribs. I might try again with some boneless pork ribs.

This came out really well with great flavor.  I made per recipe and the only think I'll do differently next time is scale back the sauce as there was way more sauce than I needed.  Other than that, I cannot see changing much at all.  This is a great new addition to my list of recipes.

Did not change recipe.  Be advised that ribs will cook down quite a bit so may want to up the quantity.  Beef ribs not always at the grocery but when I find them I get them and now I have a great way to cook them.  Just before serving, I took out of pot and placed on pan under broiler for a few minutes to get that slightly charred edge.

I made the recipe as stated.  The ribs themselves were very tender, meat just falling off the bone.  The sauce was just ok.  I think I will use the process again to cook the ribs but will need to do something different for sauce.

Amazing flavor!!!! My first time braising beef short ribs!!! This recipe I'd definitely a keeper!! My hubby could get enough!!! The meat was super tender. Only change was I only used 3/4 c bbq sauce & beef broth. The only thing I will change next time is to remove  most of the layer of fat before cooking. Thanks for sharing!!

So good! Used boneless short ribs as that is what family prefers. 1/2 all ingredients but didn't change anything else. A little goes along way, they are rich. I used trader joe's bbq sauce, which is perfect for this recipe because it's basic and not too sweet.

This recipe is hard for me to rate.  The sauce is delish but I really do not like short ribs, which I did not know until I made this recipe.  I found the meat to be greasy and not tender, all there really was is a big bone, yuk.  I would make the sauce again with another type of rib.

I was nervous because I've never made short ribs, which my boyfriend likes...and he LOVED these.  As suggested by some, I cut the BBQ sauce down to 3/4 c. I also added mushrooms and browned them with the onions and carrots, and I substituted fire-roasted diced tomatoes since I was out of tomato sauce.  Served them over egg noodles. We will definitely have these again!

These were delicious! I do suggest cooling down the braising liquid and skimming off the fat after the ribs are browned. It helps concentrate the taste I believe.

I made the following changes based on other reviews: chicken broth instead of beef, added celery to the mix, added 1/2 cup dry red wine, and I added some dry spice that gave it some heat and smokiness. These changes made the sauce more complex and resulted in more flavor notes. I also blended the sauce with the cooked veggies. The gravy was very flavorful -- good enough to eat on a flip flop! I did decrease the recipe by 1/2 since there were only 2 of us. I also made mashed cauliflower and French green beans to complete the meal. I will make this again with the modifications I made.

I made it and the meat was as tough as shoe leather. it was expensive to make and a waste of money. I will complain to the butcher -- but I dont want to make this dish again.

I have always wanted to try braising as a cooking method, this recipe was simple and delicious, will braise again and again. I used pork riblets instead of the beef, was wonderful.  I also made it one day before serving, then reheated in oven while I baked potatoes to go along with the carrots and ribs. The carrots were a pleasant surprise, not mushy and the flavor was very good.

I made this with pork spare ribs instead of beef short ribs and omitted the carrots. Since I wasn't going to be hiome, I cooked them in the crock pot.  They were easy to make and we really enjoyed the flavor.

Unbelievably good recipe. My best experience making short ribs, ever. This is a keeper. And don't worry thinking it's a small portion, they are so rich, you can't really eat that much! Served with steamed broccoli and organic quinoa.

Great starting point For those who don't like the sweetness of the BBQ sauce, try a different sauce, or like me use Heinz Chili sauce instead. Also I braise dishes like this in a 300 degree oven. Much more even heat and no worry about burning.

Great recipe! The flavors are rich and the meat tender. I did add a T. brown sugar to the BBQ sauce. O/W, no changes. Served with mashed potatoes, green peas and the carrots from the stew. A wonderful winter meal!
