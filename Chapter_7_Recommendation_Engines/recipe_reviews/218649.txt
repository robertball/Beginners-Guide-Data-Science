Totally yummy.  I used Marsala Wine instead of Brandy (didn't have any) and bone-in thighs.  Research on the Internet recommended the Marsala as a substitute.  I have not made Chicken Cacciatore in YEARS but this recipe will change that.  BTW, I mixed together the liquid ingredients the day before and stored in the refrigerator.  They really bonded!!  Thanks.

Yummy stuff!  The seasoning are a little different than from what I usually make and this is better.  My usual recipe has oregano.  A keeper, thanks!

Thank you, I've been looking for this recipe, I have been looking for this since i saw Lydia do it like this but she added a little curry powder. So I do also...the flour also helps to thicken the sauce....

I fried the chicken skin on. I may should have removed the skin. Once the sauce was place in dutch oven with chicken the skin came off. The sauce after cooking was not red anymore. I have never even had this dish before, so i am not sure what it was suppose to be, but i will not be making this recipe again.

This one is a winner! I grew up on tomato paste and was not a fan in my adult years but it works here and it works well! Leg quarters are cheap these days compared to beef so do yourself a favor and buy you some leq quarters. Also don't choose to leave the wine and brandy out because it plays a huge part in the end result. The "gravy" in this is rich and flavorful and one to die for. Thanks for the great recipe bonvivant!

Really tasty as is.  The mushroom sauce is deep and rich and goes perfectly with chicken quarters.

I added a couple diced roma tomatoes. Used Marsala wine instead of brandy and maybe that was something I shouldn't have done. I didn't make any further changes but I guess I'm used to a tomato base cacciatore. The wine flavor through me off. I had to filter the fat off the sauce before thickening it. It was a great way to cook leg quarters and I give it another try but next time with brandy.

This is pretty good, especially if you are cooking for picky eaters that won't eat anything with peppers, onions, or garlic! So the main problem I had was when I browned the lightly floured chicken pieces in batchs. During the browning of the second batch the flour that had stayed in the pan from the first batch burned. So maybe my heat was too high, anyway I had to wipe out the pan and lost a lot of the fond. I also saut√©ed the mushrooms before adding them and seasoned the raw chicken with salt and pepper before dredging in the flour. Those are both important steps that really improve the flavor. The sauce was delicious and the chicken was very tasty.

This was very good.  Made a few minor changes out of necessity.  Did the entire dish in the same large skillet I used to brown the chicken, and I used drumsticks.  I had to add more chicken broth as it started to dry up and stick.  Used Vermouth instead of white wine and served over garlic mashed potatoes.  Everyone loved it! No leftovers!
