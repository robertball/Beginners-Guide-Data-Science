I used quick cooking grits cooked following direction on package, then added butter, 1/4 cup romano cheese, 2 tsp lemon juice, salt & pepper.  Next time more lemon in the grits.  Omitted the cayenne from the shrimp.  Still delicious!

I had no idea such an easy recipe could make such great shrimp & grits!  I always thought a lot of cream had to be involved in order to make this dish tasty.  This will be my new go-to recipe.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dry and it still came out great.

Very yummy.  I added lemon zest to the grits and over-did it a bit.  Will definitely make again.

Dee-lish!  I also used the quick-cooking grits, my weekly mainstay, and added the butter, salt and pepper as directed. Just as excellent. I would make sure to finely mince the garlic so not to disturb the texture. Everything else perfect as directed. Will make many times again! Thanks!

This was awesome. Instead of grits I used garlic and herb homemade potatoes even my 3 year old asked for seconds. (:

As an avid shrimp and grits guy, this has become my preferred go-to recipe. The key is to learn how to make grits..not too soupy and not lumpy, so hone your grit making skills prior to making this recipe. I add a tablespoon of milk or cream at the end of making the grits right before I turn off the heat. Don't overcook the shrimp..have the table set and everything ready to go and serve it hot right off the stove.

I love shrimp & grits.  This recipe was perfect,  easy to make and very tasty.  My only suggestion is make sure you remove the tails in order to make eating a little less messy

I used quick grits and used chicken broth vs. water. Very good. Liked the kick of the cayenne pepper! I would double the shrimp quantity. Felt that portions were too small for 3 of us (me, hubby and 21 year old son). Will definitely make again.

This has become one of my quick go to meals when I'm too tired to cook.  I use flavored instant grits and pour this shrimp recipe on top.  Generally I add some veggie like peas or green peppers to give it more substance.

I used about a tsp of lemon pepper instead of salt/pepper/garlic. Perfect. Light and easy to make.
