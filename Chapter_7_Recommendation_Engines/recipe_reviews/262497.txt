Made this for my niece. She thought it was pretty good. I used raspberry jelly instead of preserves because that's what I have. The recipe says 1 serving but this is enough for 2 people.

This was a great option for my oatmeal.  I got two servings out of this and on the second one I did not add the pb and jelly till the second day when I reheated it.  This was great.  I am so excited to try different types of jelly.  Thanks

Since I am allergic to eggs, it removes a lot of warm breakfast food options that I can eat in the am. So when I found this Oatmeal idea 2 -3 months ago and tried it, I was ecstatic and I have been eating my oatmeal this way ever since. Itâ€™s hearty, filling, warm and flavourful. I eat mine with raspberry jam and smooth peanut butter. Love it...such a great idea :)
