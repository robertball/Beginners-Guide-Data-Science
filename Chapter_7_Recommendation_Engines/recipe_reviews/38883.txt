Didn't have macaroons so I made a graham cracker crust. I also used half Ricotta and half cream cheese because I like the taste of Ricotta and it makes a lighter texture. The results were delicious! Will definitely use the macaroons next time because I'm sure it will make this cake even more scrumptious. Oh I almost forgot. Instead of using the mixer, I just threw the eggs and cheese into my blender - mixed till creamy and poured over the crust. Can't get any easier than that!!!

This was a wonderful cheesecake, even without the strawberry sauce.  Just a word of warning, though -- put a cookie sheet or foil under the pan.  Mine dripped butter all over my oven and made quite a mess!

This was absolutely PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!!!!! There is no other word to describe it. I'm not a cheesecake person at all and I devoured this! I didn't change a single thing about the recipe. It's perfect as it is!

Yum! I had never made a cheesecake before, but tackled this one for Passover with my husbands family. It was delish. I used honey nut kosher macaroons for the crust -- and actually doubled it because it wasn't enough to really covering the base of the pan. I'd skip the strawberry sauce next time for sure. The orange essense was plenty of flavor. I had added a touch more OJ than it called for. Also subbed out some of the main cake -- instead of 4 blocks of fully loaded cream cheese, I used 1 fat-free, 1 reduced fat, 1 loaded, and 1 part fat free ricotta. Really was scrumptious! Only regret is that I should have heeded the advice of the other reviewer who mentioned the leaking butter. What a mess!

Made this for the 1st time this Passover, definitely will not be the last time.  Tasty, easy to make and an all-around favorite.  I used chocolate macaroons for the crust which was extra tasty!!
