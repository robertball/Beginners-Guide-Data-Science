i thought this was a delicious, savory and seasonal fall dish. i had never made anything with parsnips or rutabaga before so it was also sort of exciting. i'm not sure why the recipe didn't actually include turkey itself, but i added that along with some mushrooms and red pepper. also, we had stuff our turkey with rosemary and thyme so i added that to the stock. great soup that everyone enjoyed.

I just made this soup and it is excellent!  Very flavorful.  I didn't add the orzo as there were already so many vegetables, but I hope to do so next time.  I baked the turkey carcass overnight in water first to make the broth stronger-- I don't think 3 hours would have done it.  I added the turkey meat when finished, as well as an extra clove of garlic.  You can't go wrong with this soup!

I love soups & stews in the winter months and this is so good. The rutabaga and parsnip give this just the right hint of sweetness. My teenaged grand daughter, having eaten neither, really liked it as  I think this would be excellent using just bullion cubes.

I was quite disappointed with this recipe. It sat wrong in my stomach and I burped it for hours afterwards. It was kinda bland and not at all as good as the other reviewers said. I followed the recipe exactly, other than subbing brown rice for the orzo. We won't make this again :-(

Turkey soup has always been a challenge for me. Mine always came out short on flavor. With this recipe, the homemade stock makes all the difference--well worth the effort. Although the only spices are salt and pepper, the combination of the roasted turkey flavor with the subtle nuance the root vegetables add is wonderful. This was a clear winner with my family too. The nutritional info has to be wrong, though. I can't see where 2,200+ calories per serving is right.

Best turkey soup ever!!  Subbed white turnip for the rutabaga, and added Bell's seasoning....perfect.  And...the picture for this soup makes it look like the broth was very thin...in my case, the broth was dark, rich, and quite a bit thicker....

The kids (including the guest kid) each had four servings of this soup, so I'd have to give it a thumbs up. I did add a little tiny bit of chopped meat to it.

This is my first time making Turkey soup with root veggies and I loved it.  Using Orzo made it less heavy than regular noodles.  it appears as rice but it isn't.  My son, who detests rice ate this with seconds and another sneak of thirds.   

To "Lece" Any time you have a stomach upset to something you ate, it could indicate that you are allergic to certain foods or ingredients.  In this case it could be one of the root vegetables. I am allergic to rhubarb so I avoid it and use other food in its place.  There are so many other vegetable options you can choose from. 

I do have to admit though that I did add 1 extra part of chicken stock and it may be the key to more flavor if it appears too bland.  It didn't seem to be enough liquid, so in this case more was better!  No other "doctoring" was necessary.

My family has deemed this a Thanksgiving leftovers MUST!

I substituted fresh sage for parsley; sage and turkey go hand in hand! Also added some leftover turkey meat at the end.  Yum

Excellent soup. I used bone broth from my thanksgiving turkey. I added both white and dark meat leftovers and since I didnâ€™t have parsnips or rutabagas I added a white potato and a sweet potato. I also had organic celery, onions and red carrots that looked beautiful in it. The spices I added were parsley, ground sage & rosemary S&P and it was perfect! Will definitely make again!

Forgot to get rutabagas so I just used more parsnips and would make it that way again. The most favorite turkey soup ever at our house!! Also I saved & froze jars of the broth and meat so I can make this when I want to!!

This is a wonderful soup recipe. I've made it twice and the kids love it, probably because the root vegetables give it a nice sweetness. They ate all the vegetables - no whining or complaining.

So so...not the way I remember my mom's tasted.  Kids didn't like it.
