Just a tip for those disappointed in the weak maple flavor: When baking with maple syrup, it is a good idea to use Grade B syrup, which is stronger flavored and intended for baking or cooking rather than as a table syrup.

These muffins were great. I cut the recipe in half, added a bit more syrup than called for, and poured it into 12 mini muffin cups . I used Grade A Dark Amber syrup, so it was just a subtle but very nice maple flavor. I also replaced the sugar with Splenda, and used almost all wheat flour because i ran out of white. Wonderful recipe!       Later note: I made this again in a regular muffin pan and with the whole recipe. I replaced the shortening with 1 tbs shortening, 1 tbs butter, and 2 tbs applesauce. I used a little over 2/3 cup of maple syrup and added a little less than 1/4 cup of toasted chopped walnuts. This time i used all white flour, and it was soooo delcious, i ate about 5 of them. The bit of toasted walnuts was REALLY delicious in it. I LOVE this recipe to death.

I didn't care for these.  You can BARELY taste the maple syrup.  Not worth the time.  My fiance liked them though.  I doubt I'll make these again.

Huge hit at our house!  Light, chewy, and sweet without being cloying.  DBF is a maple-aholic and this recipe was an instant success.  :-)

I used Grade B maple syrup, as this is our preference and what was on-hand.  Grade B isn't easy to find outside sugar houses, so when it's gone, I'll probably use whatever real Grade A is commercially available and add some maple flavoring.

How delightful to find a recipe that is so quick and easy--and delicious!  These were refreshing in that they are very light tasting--nice texture with just a subtle, wonderful maple taste without being overly sweet.

NIce Light muffins.  I would have liked them to be sweeter, next time I make them I'll be adding brown sugar.  I also made them with vanilla soy milk instead of milk.

they froze and reheated nicely

I used melted butter in place of the shortening and I added a scant teaspoon of maple flavoring. I did not get 12 muffins, I got nine muffins that were a bit on the small side. Baked at 350*, they were done at 20 minutes. The smell of these baking was incredible. These were very tasty. I recommend adding maple extract to really bump up the flavor.

I love this recipe!  I did play with it a little.  I saw that a lot of folks were substituting brown sugar for the white suger -- I went one step further and used pure maple sugar, which boosted the maple flavor levels.  Also, I didn't have rolled oats in the house, but quick oats worked fine.  I used real butter, too, for shortening.

You can smell the maple flavor when you take the muffins out of the oven! I would make them again. For those that like sweeter and more maple favor, try frosting the muffins with Maple Butter Frosting that is listed on this website.

I'm not sure why people seem to think this recipe is good.  I tried all 3 recipes under "Maple Muffins," used Grade B Maple syrup, and consider myself to be a baker.  These were not good muffins.  The texture was grainy and the flavor is very faint.  I only got 9-10 muffins.

As the recipe is written they are not all that great.  When I made them with Grade B (darker syrup meant for baking) they were okay but still not all that much maple flavour.  When I added a maple glaze and served with maple butter they were over the top awesome!

I made these tonight, with a few slight adjustments and my family deemed them as "dynamite"!  I used brown sugar, instead of white, about 3/4c. of maple syrup and added a handful of white chocolate chips.  I will def be making these again, this recipe is a keeper!

Not a real fan of these.  I used the darkest syrup (#3) and was really no flavor at all.  They were very grainy as well.

These should have been called "Real Ugly Muffins." No one liked them in my house, no maple flavor-and I use real syrup, not Mrs. ButterButt's and I use real butter, not Criso. Still tasted like blaghhhhhhhh.

One recent morning I was craving buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup, but was just too lazy to go through the process...enter these Maple Muffins! I appreciated this recipe, with a few modifications (hence 4 stars) - some of which were out of necessity, some out of preference. They were...
-I used brown sugar instead of white. I've been doing that with a lot of recipes recently for added flavor and moistness. I think it complimented the maple flavor, as well.
-I did not have shortening on hand, so used chilled butter in the same quantity. I will probably continue to use butter.
-Since I was craving buttermilk pancakes, I used buttermilk in place of regular milk, and it was fantastic (I'm sure coddled milk would work just as well).
-I used a Franz 9 Grain hot cereal in place of the rolled oats, but I'm sure either would be equally delicious.
-Finally, if you have non-stick muffin pans, do yourself a favor and give them a shot of non-stick spray and put the batter directly into the pan, foregoing paper muffin cups. The sugars in the batter carmalized a bit on the outside of the muffins and was amazing. This is one time you will not want to give the stumps to the homeless...

I have not made these yet, to those who complained about the lack of maple flavour, you could always add a bit of Mapeline (sic?) or Maple extract.  You also could mix up a bit of a glaze and add either maple syrup or extract.  I will be trying these soon though.  I always try to stick to the recipe the first time I make a recipe, as I feel it is a bit unfair to rate something if not tried.

I used brown sugar in place of white, unsalted butter instead of shortening, buttermilk instead of regular milk, and I added a full cup of broken walnut pieces. (By adding a cup of walnuts, you will get 12 muffins. Otherwise you get 9.) I can't say enough about how delicious these were!   Delicate flavor, tender, not overly sweet.  I believe they were light and tender due to the buttermilk! And maple-walnut?  Whats not to love?

I made this in 2015 and absolutely loved it! Now i tried to recreate it and...i think it mightve been the cake cups i used? I tried to peel it off the muffin and half of it got pulled off and left me with just the muffin tops 

Its still delicious but i might suggest some oil or perhaps more butter next time round.

These muffins are wonderful, especially with my coffee in the morning.  They are the perfect texture and not too sweet.   My kids preferred them with maple butter cream frosting, but I loved them without frosting.

I made the recipe exactly as listed and it was easy and they turned out perfectly. The flavor is lightly maple, not super sweet. These are a perfect snack with a cup of coffee, not a dessert muffin.  I will make them again.

These muffins are good, but they take a long time to make. You should give them a try.

Decided not to add the sugar because the recipe had maple syrup in it. They were still sweet - so pretty glad I didn't add the sugar.

This is decent, and I like the texture that the rolled oats adds, but the flavor is not very strong. I still ate it, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

Made with butter, brown sugar, almond milk, real maple syrup + 1 t maple extract these turned out beautifully and were not overly sweet. YUM.

I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the mix.  These were still a little bland.  Next time I'll add a tsp. of jam in the middle.

I tried this muffins and they were OK.
I think one commenter mentioned using stronger maple syrup?
Bland as is; but I think if I added some nuts or butterscotch chips I might make these again.
Another commenter mentioned they freeze well too.

This was a sweet little gem that tasted like a wonderful pancake with syrup all rolled into one muffin. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is that it could have benefited from a few chopped nuts or dried banana pieces to give it more nutritional value. Still, that is a personal thing and is not the fault of the recipe.

These were wonderful. I took them in to work and they went fast! I changed them a bit. I used egg substitute and vanilla soymilk to make them vegan. I also used sugar free syrup instead of real maple syrup and they were still delicious, but healthier! Highly recommend.
