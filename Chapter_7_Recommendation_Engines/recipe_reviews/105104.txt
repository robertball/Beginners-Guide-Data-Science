I agree with the previous post - too many onions. I decreased the amount but next time would decrease to half a package. I also increased the amount of mushrooms. There was barely enough soup to coat the meat so I added a can of vegetable stock (I figured you can always remove the lid and cook it off if it is too thin). I also added some minced garlic since I wouldn't find the soup w/garlic. I used fresh sage and added a leave an hour before it was finished. I'd say this is an ok recipe, a little bland. Because the meat must be browned first so I think it might be easier to just use sliced large onions carmelized in the skillet you brown the meat in, and then add mushrooms, the soup and some stock, cover and turn the heat down and just cook on the stoptop.

This was a pretty good recipe.  It was a little heavy on the onions, but they did lend a lot to the flavor.  We might have left this in the slow-cooker a little too long (10-ish hours) - the onions were very soft.  But the pork was amazing!!!  So tender and delicious!

Oh, one change:  we didn't have the mushroom soup with roasted garlic, so I used cream of murshroom soup and added a quartered clove of garlic.

This tasted so good.  It was so tender and flavorful.  The only thing I may do different next time is add a cup of water, because there was barely enough gravy left.  I am so glad it didn't burn.
