I have eaten Cabbage and Noodles for over 70 yrs. Learned to make this from my Grandma and Mother. We don't make it with bacon and onions. Too much fat with the bacon. I fry the shredded cabbage in butter until almost brown and tender, then mix into the cooked broad noodles. I have passed this on to my 3 sons and dil's. It is one of their favorites especially during Lent.

Drain some of that grease. A half pound of bacon makes for a lot of grease. Use just a couple of tablespoons. In fact, cook the onion in 1 tablespoon, then add another for the cabbage. This is even good if use the pre-cooked bacon, and cook the onion and cabbage in olive oil instead.

I made this a couple of weeks ago and followed the recipe to a T. The only thing that I added was a little more bacon then just drained a little bit of the bacon grease out. (My family loves bacon). It turned out amazing! We will be fixing it again this week.

Haluska as it is known in Hungarian is found throughout Eastern Europe and can be made as a main dish with bacon,sausage or ham,and as a side dish without meat for pork chops, cutlets, or roasts. Another variation would be to add boiled potatoes to the fried cabbage with or without pasta and/or meat. I use only a small amount of bacon fat as a base flavoring utilizing more butter and/ or oil.                                          One other reviewer correctly  mentioned "squeezing" the chopped cabbage but didn't explain further. As the cabbage is cut place it in a colander by handful layers and salting each layer with kosher salt. After last salted layer, press the cabbage down with your hands a few times and let it sit for at least a half hour. Salting the cabbage will cause wilting and draw out bitter fluids. Squeeze the cabbage out by handfuls and place in the prepared fry pan. I've never had to add sugar using this method and the cabbage will fit into the pan. Do not cover the pan and fry until the cabbage just starts to brown and carmelize.This won't take long as a reult of salting and squeezing. Then, remove from heat. Whatever pasta you use, treat it as you would in Italian cooking. Have the cabbage ready and add the drained and unrinsed pasta to it. If you have access to a European deli, get some single smoked sausage, slice it thin and add to the cabbage near the end of cooking just to warm it through. One bite of that and.....

I loved it!  I followed the directions exactly, using just a bit of the bacon grease with a little bit of butter to saut√© the onions & cabbage.  Since DH wouldn't be home right away, I tasted it again before serving and felt it needed a little something!  I microwaved a half cup of water, added about teaspoon - plus of chicken bullion, stirred and poured over all.  (I also have ham base, but felt the chicken would be the right flavoring.) Stirred and served.  We all devoured our portions (including DS 20!!!).  Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!

I've been making this for years & come from a Slovak background. We also make it with sausage (either Bob Evans or Jimmy Dean). I use 1 lb of sausage or 1 lb of bacon to 1 14-16oz bag of noodles & 1 lg. head of cabbage. I don't drain any of the grease & it's not greasy. Great recipe!!!!

yes, this is a Hungarian recipe.  When browning the onions, sprinkle a tsp of sugar over them.  Kicks it up a notch and brings out all the flavors.  YUM !

With so much cabbage from the garden, I'm looking for as many recipes as I can. This was very good but I felt it needed a few more seasonings including some caraway. Kielbasa would work in this dish as well or add a bit of sour cream. It's all good and thank you!

In my family we call this dish halushki, a wonderful recipe passed down from Polish Grandmother.  This can be made with or without the bacon, but lots of butter and onions are a must. Great comfort food.  Season with salt and pepper.

this was yummy!  you can modify a bit to your tastes.  For instance, I used turkey bacon (little to no grease) and cooked the cabbage, onion and bacon separately, adding all in a big pot at the end, then folding in the cooked noodles. I double the recipe for 1lb of noodles and used 1 stick of butter--it was very good.    My mom used to make this w/chicken broth...very good that way too.  You can also season with dill, if you like that herb...it's pretty good that way.

YUM. Made some alterations to try to make it a tiny bit healthier: microwaved ready-cooked bacon & chopped that up. So, sauteed onion (& garlic) in a little olive oil and butter, added a medium head of chopped cabbage and about a 1/4 cup chicken broth. Also only used 1tbsp butter for the noodles. Tasted a little bland, so added 1tsp sugar, sea salt, pepper, garlic POWDER, and Cajun seasoning. With these alterations, it was awesome. Would also be good with ham, procciuto, or spicy chicken sausage. Thanks for a great recipe that the entire family loved!

I saw this dish made on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and we copied it from there from the info the restaraunt owner gave - It have all of these ingredients and was AMAZING!!! The only difference is is that we boil the cabbage first so it is tender before adding to the pan and I do not cook cook this in bacon grease. I do cook it in butter and olive oil.

I grew up on cabbage and noodles. This very similar to what my mom made us. We didn't add onions, but I often add onions to fried cabbage so I am sure this is great. I add a generous amount of black pepper. I like it peppery! Brings out the flavor IMO.

I made this tonight with two changes for my husband and myself.  I used multi-color bowtie pasta instead of egg noodles [just stuff in the cabinet available], and reduced the bacon to three slices [there's just two of us].  Used half of an onion and a generous amount of black pepper.  It was so good, hubby asked me to make it again soon!  Thank you for sharing.

Love this every which way it's made - It's wonderful and very versatile - as long as you like cabbage that is :) - for a whirl, try it with sweet italian sausage, or kielbasa, or pancetta! this is just a wonderful dish, thanks for posting LissieKat.

This was very good. I followed the recipie  and found it lacking a little extra something. I agree with other reviewers and think some vinigar, caraway seeds or kielbasi would really bring it up a notch. Hubby really liked it, though, the kids not so much. I will keep it in my profile and add to it next time.

Great start and I say that only because I made so many modifications because of what I had in the house.  THANK YOU for the ideas. To begin I don't measure anything, I go by tastes we like and what how many I need to feed.  For meat we use a spicey turkey kielbasa & pasta (we had left) we used stuffed pasta w/butternut squash (prepared as directed).  We sauted red onion & 2 garlic cloves in bacon grease, tossed in cabbage (we could have used more) it always cooks down more than we expect, sauted until soft crunchy, put in pasta heated through.  Ground pepper & Salt to taste and ENJOYED!!!  The pasta gave a sweat offset to the spicey meat. What a nice alternative for kielbasa.

This one showed up in my inbox and I was skeptical.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  So glad I did!  Made three variations.  I added my crispy chopped bacon as a topping at the end prior to serving (my daughter insisted as she hates soggy bacon) and I reduced the bacon grease to about two tablespoons.  I also added a tablespoon or so of paprika.  Served with warm bread.  Delicious!  This will be part our cold weather rotation.  Quick and easy and very satisfying.  Can't wait to try it with smoked sausage or kielbasa.  Also, took another reviewer's suggestion and served it with a dollop of sour cream.  Yummy!

This definately is a comfort food, which normaly means--hit the gym afterwards...lol!  It is a Hungarian Dish..I used Halushki Noodles..they are just a little thicker than your average noodles.  I stuck to the original recipe...And I am now ready for the 14 inches of snow we are supposed to get tonight!!

I am only giving it 4 stars because I think the recipe is much better when you swap the bacon for smoked sausage. And add some sliced red peppers. I love it. It is quick and cheap, and a family favorite!

Actually, I think this is a Slovak recipe called "Haluski". It's probably the same in a lot of the Eastern European countries. My grandmother was Slovak. She made it with 1 head of cabbage, 1 lb. of bacon, and homemade egg noodles. She never would waste bacon grease by draining any of it, but I usually drain off half the grease. Also, cut up the bacon before frying it. I love this recipe, but only get to make it a couple times a year. My wife and kids will not touch it!

I made something very similar to this once before.  I love this!!  Can only make it when I am eating with others cause hubby will not eat it.  Made it today to take to mother's 84th BD party.  I know it will be a great it! I used Garlic Garlic and a dash of salt & pepper.  Was hard not taste testing it too much!  =  )

This is a great recipe, but a lot of fat with the bacon. The 3rd time I made it in the crock pot. Cooked the cabbage with pre-browned cheddar wurst sausages and a splash of chicken broth, no butter & then stirred in the cooked noodles with a little butter at the end. Yummy. It also worked with perogis in place of the noodles.  Excellent!

I have made cabbage and noodles for years, it's one of my favorite meals.  I used this recipe and did a little tweaking as suggested by other reviews. I had a fairly large head of cabbage so I used a 16 oz. bag of Reame's frozen noodles (they are as close to homemade as you can get), used a full pound of bacon, sprinkled the onion with sugar while browning in bacon grease, added a generous amount of salt and pepper and 1 1/2 sticks of butter....MAGNIFICO!!! Love it, thank you!!

I cut up the bacon into bits and began to fry it as I chopped the onions.  Add the onions and cook as you chop the cabbage.  Add the cabbage until it's wilting and then add the noodles.  Super easy and quick to prepare.

While in HS I had a Hungarian friend who taught me to make this - she said it was very important to "squeeze" all of the moisture out of the cabbage... a very tedious job I can tell you!  I followed this recipe exactly (no squeezing!) and it was every bit as good - perhaps even better.  I love the bacon flavor throughout the noodles.  Served it with Hungarian Pork Sandwiches (Peshene).  Thanks LissieKat, for this delish dish!

This is a fabulous recipe.  It also is delicious reheated.  I even added some shredded swiss cheese and a small amount of sour cream to my reheated leftovers and it was so good!

As is, this is pretty bland, with my modifications it's five stars. 

Cook the cabbage (and onion if you're using it) in a half cup butter, 2tbs brown sugar, and 1tbs apple cider vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. While that is cooking, fry the bacon until nice and crispy, and cook the egg noodles. After the bacon and noodles are done, add to the cabbage, season with more salt and pepper as desired, and enjoy!!  The brown sugar and vinegar add a really nice flavor and really takes this recipe up a notch!

Made this for supper this evening, turned out great. Did do some changes, used garlic instead of powder, cut down on the butter, probably had more bacon (did freeze the bacon 1st, choped it then cooked it). After assemblying everything, I thought that it was coming out a bit dry, so I added some milk, and in the last 5 minutes or so I added some frozen peas for some crunch and color. This is on my rotation. Thanks for sharing

Great recipe.  Tweaked it a bit.. added fresh garlic with the onions and a little chicken broth to the cabbage mixture.  We cleaned the pot.

This was delicious.  I used half the bacon, no butter, poured out most of the grease before braising the cabbage.  I also added a diced leftover pork chop.

Great recipe!  This is what I did: Used a bit less bacon grease as some other cooks recommended (about two tbsp) Added some parmesan cheese on top- this really added a good touch in my opinion! I loved it, my girlfriend thought it could use a light drizzling of a cream sauce- it's up to you!

This was good! Made almost to recipe but was out of butter..used the bacon grease and some garlic oil. It could have used a little more flavor - although I did add garlic and S&P. Next time I will try the suggestion of chicken boullion in the noodle water! The recipe was precisely what I was looking for!

This dish was a hit at my house. We have 5 teenagers and they loved, even the ones who don't like cabbage. I did make a couple changes that tasted excellent and went over very well. I used 1 head of cabbage, 1 large onion, 2 1/2 pounds ground pork, soy sauce, worchester sauce, season salt, pepper, and my husbands secret blend of his favorite spices. Love this recipe and I will make it again.

Great recipe to build on.  I added one Granny Smith apple to onion and garlic to brown in pan and also about a TB of brown sugar and some caraway seed.  I omitted the butter and just used a bit of bacon fat for saute.  YUM

This was really good. I followed the recipe, but added a half cup of chicken stock when I combined the noodles with the cabbage. I'll definitely make again, but next time I'll add a clove or two of garlic.

Made this for dinner last night based on all the good reviews. Everyone is right!! This is comfort food at its best, for sure. My husband told me twice how much he liked it.I used a good quality bacon, and followed the recipe exactly as written. I will make again, thanks for the comfort Lissiekat (smile)

I cook this the same but instead of the garlic salt (as there is enough salt with the bacon) I add about two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar to it. Really gives it some zip and makes it tastier.

I loved it.  I used a clove of minced garlic instead of garlic salt and added some cayenne pepper to it.  I think you can cut down a bit on the butter.  But was an easy dish to cook and we had seconds.  Definitely  a comfort.

Made this for the first time for dinner tonight.  Neither of us had ever had this prior to tonight.  It was quick and easy.  I did reduce the bacon grease to 2 tbls and the butter to 1 tbls and I crushed fresh garlic.  My husband and I both found it tasty.   I will make this again.   Love this site. Thanks for another delish dish.

I really like this recipe....Thank you!
Only made a couple of changes. I used 2 tb of the bacon grease instead of all of it, and I added a Turkey Kielbasa that I chopped into bite sized pieces and cooked with the onion. Will make again for sure.

We added a little olive oil and freshly ground black pepper, ..but otherwise followed the recipe.  I shredded fresh cabbage and sliced onions, not chopped, bacon and a little butter.  We cooked it in a large oblong electric skillet. Egg noodles al dente.  It was so easy and tasty!

Our Family would make this dish but we added sliced mushrooms to the onion. no garlic salt we added fresh chopped garlic to the onion just when the onion was cooked and only cook the garlic until fragrant. It was all placed in the oven 350 for 20 to 30 min until hot. We did not use the bacon fat. True old country food.

Fran is correct.  This a Hungarian dish, and I had to learn to make it, among many other favorite Hungarian recipes, when I married into a Hungarian family 45 years ago.  The paprika is missing.  One-fourth tsp. of Hot Hungarian Paprika is best.  We also add 1/8 tsp. pepper, and minced garlic.  Bacon is already salty, so extra salt via the garlic salt is overkill.  Traditionally, thick homemade egg noodles, cut into 1-inch squares, is used.

Delicious comfort food. I used less bacon fat, but when I serve at the table, we top it with sour cream. This is a rare treat because of all the fat and calories, so we really enjoy it when we have it.

We all loved this recipe. My family has always made a variation of this recipe using Ramen noodles and soy sauce to taste. It was equally tasty with egg noodles!! We did drain the bacon grease also and my husband uses Parmeson on his as well.

So yummy! I already had leftover bacon that had been fried crispy in my fridge.  I simmered the onions in butter then add more butter and the shredded cabbage.  When it was tender, I added the cooked egg noodles, the chopped pre-cooked bacon and the garlic salt and stirred until heated thru.  So good.  I will definitely make again.

I wasn't sure about trying this recipe.  Sounded pretty bland, but I was in a hurry and had the right ingredients.  I'm so glad I tried--it's so good.  We like it with sliced up smokey links sausage--it's a complete meal.  Interestingly enough, after I tried this I found an almost identical recipe in the inspirational magazine Guideposts.

I tried this recipes today.   It is so good.  I did add one cup of the water the noodles cooked in.  I also threw everything in the skillet after sauting the onions. Noodles, bacon and cabbage. That is why I added the water.  I then covered the skillet and let it simmer until all the liquid was gone and the cabbage tender.  I also noticed with the Bacon and onion I did not have that smell of boiled cabbage. Which is a good thing.  I will be making this dish again soon.Yummmmy.

Made this while fasting from meat. Used olive oil instead of bacon. Added shredded carrots and mushrooms and other reviewers suggested grainy mustard. Also added soy and Worcestershire sauce. Everyone loved it!!! Can't wait till we make it again with kielbasa.

Used 12 oz package of noodles, also 12 oz package of bacon, but only a tablespoon or two of bacon grease and 1 T butter. Fabulous dish, even cabbage-hating DD 10 loved it.

I love a simple recipe that tastes great!  Husband and preschooler loved it as well.  I bought a larger head of cabbage and added a little extra...that stretched the serving size a little farther without adding too many extra calories.  I also reduced the butter by 1 tablespoon.  Next time I plan to add more bacon but drain off a lot of the grease, and use salt and pepper before adding the noodles back in.  This one's a keeper!

It wasnt terrible, but as I was eating it I was trying to figure out what was so wonderful about it. I added fresh picked snow peas to give it a lil crunch and added flavor. Like I said it wasnt terrible and I ate 2 bowls of it, but I probably wont make again.

I have made a recipe very close to this for years (from my Hungarian Mom-in-law).  If you leave out the bacon and saute the onion and cabbage in additional butter, you can add all kinds of leftover meats ie: chicken, browned ground beef, pork.  Served with warm rolls, it makes a great winter dinner.

I grew up in a neighborhood w/many eastern Eurpoean families - fortunately I remembered their tweaks to this recipe.  A tspor so of cider vinegar plus two tsps brown sugar will add depth to the flavor.  Also, as a previous reviewer indicated, caraway seeds really pop the flavor as well.  Truly, you can skip the bacon and use butter as the fat.  This is a cheap, filling dish.  Many a pieroghi was eaten with a side of "halushki". 4 stars as is, 5 stars tweaked!

I have recommended this recipe more than once and just realized that I have never rated it. My family loves this recipe. It is simple and a perfect comfort food. Thanks for the great recipe!

Had this as a side to a pork roast and my family loved it. We didn't even need the pork, this would be great as a meal on it's own. I followed the directions except for adding more than a dash of garlic salt.

The first time I made this, the leftovers haunted me and I had to keep eating them.  I made it a second time and again, I love having the leftovers.  This is my new comfort food and replaces mac and cheese.  This is so, so good.

Since I rate recipes on this site as they are originally submitted, I have to give this one four stars because the amount of noodles called for were way too much for a small head of cabbage. The flavor was good and I will make this again with less noodles.

I love this type of dish! I made it exactly as stated and it was really good. However I prefer my cabbage and noodles with keilbasa or some other type of smoked sausage. Just a personal preference! Great both ways!

This was a hit with my husband and he has already asked me to make it again only 2 weeks later. We both agreed it kinda tasted like cabbage filled perogies so he put sour cream on it. He is Ukrainian so maybe that's why it was a hit.

GREAT recipe! The guys in your life will eat every last bite! I followed along EXACT to this recipe, but added sliced Kielbasa-Polish Sausage. It was AMAZING! I felt that maybe the bacon pieces wouldn't offer enough "BITE" for a main dish and I was right! I can see this with chicken breast as well! YUMMY

Delicious.  I was trying to make just enough for 1 person but it really got out of hand.  I put too many noodles in.  It is best with more cabbage and less noodles.  I'll know for next time and there will definitely be a next time.

Great base recipe. I'm really trying to watch the fat in my diet, but this sounded so good that I had to try it!

I used Trader Joe's Uncured Smoked Apple bacon. Absolutely delish; the smell alone of the bacon cooking was awesome. I draind all of the bacon and sauted the onion and cabbage is some olive oil adding back a little bacon drippings. I also added some chicken broth to compensate for the lack of bacon drippings. For seasoning, I used pepper and crushed red chili peppers to give it an extra kick. Very tasty...thanks for sharing!

This was delicious!  Neighbors also loved it.  Change I made was just to use the package of Real Bacon Bits -- that helps to cut down on the grease from the bacon, especially with having butter in this recipe.  When I make again, I will be using a large head of cabbage as the small head just didn't seem like enough cabbage for my taste.

We just finished our dinner of Cabbage and noodles with onions and bacon.  My husband really liked it as did I except that next time I will drain a little more of the bacon grease, otherwise it was a very good tasting dish!

Used whole grain, wide noodles and only 1 tablespoon of butter. Thought it was yummy and a true comfort food on this snowy, spring day! Thanks.

This is a very tasty, simple, and easy-to-make comfort food. I've been making this for years, but we add sliced zucchini to it and saute that along with the onion. Doesn't change the flavor much but adds some color and maybe a few extra nutrients! My hubby and kids love this!

All our favorite ingredients - how could one go wrong ?  I added some cooked sausage in the end as suggested in a review - used less bacon and also added garlic with onions.  And.....a bit of fennel seed as we love that flavor !
Turned out well - love this site when I just don't know what to cook !

I made this today while it was rainy out, it really hit the spot for the whole family. It really is a good comfort food and really fast to make too. I like that there are not too many ingredients and that it doesn't take long to make. Next time I might add a little dill weed just for a fresh flavor.

As soon as I read this recipe I ran out into the kitchen and started cooking. Reading this brought back memories of my Hungarian grandmother & how much I loved this dish when I was a kid. I had totally forgotten about it - thanks & it was wonderful just the way its written.

Cooked as directed, but did drain off most of the grease. Definitely needed more than a "dash" of garlic salt. Needs real garlic and salt/pepper. Was very bland, and a much better side dish than a main dish.

Have made this quite often.....you can certainly cut back on the grease by using the microwave ready (not refrigerated) type of bacon, or use the bacon bits in a jar or bag from Hormel, etc.

Thanks LissieKat, I've always wanted to try and make this and I love it!  I did not fry the bacon and use the fat, I used some already cooked bacon and some chicken broth once and just some of the cooking water from the noodles the next time.  I also found adding just a tsp or 2 of sugar make it lip smackin good!  Second time I added smoked sausage, even WITH the bacon, my hubby loved it!

I've been making this for years!  It's an excellent recipe that always gets rave reviews.  I now use a lower fat bacon & a light butter or margarine but the flavor is still just as good.  This is also amazing the next day as the flavors blend nicely overnight.

I haven't made *this* recipe, but for years I've been making this dish almost exactly as this recipe show. It is a phenomenal dish! I'm not a huge cabbage fan, but I'll eat my weight in cabbage when it's cooked this way. Vary spices to your tastes (I use dill weed in mine, and diced garlic instead of garlic salt, and add a can of chicken stock to cook down the cabbage), and you'll have a great dinner.

The cabbage and noodles are called kroutfleckala and yes it is hungarian.  My grandmother serves it with hungarian sausage.  My husband doesn't like hungarian sausage.  So I make it with skinless smoke sausage.  Can't wait to try it with bacon.

Mmmm! I made this for my hubby, who LOVES his mom's cabbage and noodles.  I was using my leftover cabbage from St. Pat's Day, and I didn't realize I was out of egg noodles, so I made my own using a recipe on this site.  It turned out great.  I did drain most of the bacon grease before adding the onion, since I don't like very greasy dishes.

Great recipe as is!  Could use less bacon grease or butter to cut down on fat.  Good comfort food.

My family calls these Nancy's Noodles, too (as another reviewer does!) because my mother-in-law, Nancy makes these.  Her recipe is just like this, but she throws in some peas, too, at the end. THANKS for the recipe. So good even if you don't normally like cabbage.

This was different, but it was good. I'm used to just the fried cabbage by its self. And when you add the noodles it just make the cabbage go further its good and would make again but I prefer just the cabbage by its self.

This was a hit with the entire family! I did drain off the bacon grease and left a tablespoon or so in the pot before adding the onion. With the onion I added some minced garlic. I poured in a tiny bit more of the drained bacon grease when I added the cabbage. I like spicy food, and this was perfect with some Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

The roots of this dish is Lack of Money (make noodles from the pantry) and last fall's cabbage still available in the cold cellar.  This recipe is perfect as is.  Want to change it up?  USE sliced, shredded, or bite-size pieces --  OTHER members of the cabbage family: Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, broccoli, cauli, AND/OR kale.  Also, optionally add leftover protein or scramble some eggs.

This recipe popped up in my email and it sound interesting. I made it and I must say I thought it was very tasteful. It was a great hearty meal and easy to make. I read the reviews before I made it and some people said that it was too greasy. So after cooking the bacon I poured just a little bit of The bacon grease out and then proceeded. Delicious... very happy with this meal

This was good but would have been bland had I not added salt and lots of pepper( including some red pepper flakes) and that dash of garlic salt! The recipe listed a dash of garlic salt but never said where to use it and no mention of salt and pepper. Does it go without saying?

Quick and tasty. Some people say it needs more spices, but I don't agree. Added spices would mask the subtle sweetness of the fried cabbage and onions. I didn't mix the bacon in with the rest of the ingredients, but crumbled it on top of each serving. That, along with a couple turns of the pepper mill give you a delicious dish and a lovely presentation.

Oh.my.stars!!!  This was devine!  My husband doesn't care for cabbage, but he LOVED this.  He even went back for a second helping!  My picky kids loved this too. I made this exactly as written. Some people were concerned about too much bacon grease.  I baked mine in the oven (about 7 slices) and it produced a couple tablespoons.  I picked up the foil and poured it in the pan, so not every drop was used as some stuck to the foil, and it was perfect. This is comfort food all the way!  Thank you for introducing this dish to me...I will be making this again, and again, and again!

This is a simple and yummy dish.  I used only three strips of bacon and a little olive oil.  I find cooking bacon annoying (I always burn it) so next time I will try just using olive oil.  I think it would still be good and that would make the whole process quicker, also.

This is delicious! I make it this way all the time only double it for more people. It is not too greasy with the bacon and a head of cabbage and it has much more flavor than just using butter. I have never had to salt and drain the chopped cabbage to get rid of bitterness because mine is never bitter. Love it!!

This is very good. I drained half the bacon grease because it's a lot of grease. HOWEVER, I regretted it later! Next time I will leave all the grease. It's definitely not a recipe for someone watching their weight, but it is GOOOOOOD. I plan to make this again.

I love this kind of comfort food!  I did add a little minced garlic, salt and black pepper to enhance the wonderful taste of the cabbage.  I cooked as directed then sent it into the oven for awhile covered to let all the flavors come together while i did some other chores.  Turned out amazing!

This was very good. I cooked it pretty much as is, but since I had a large head of cabbage I used a 12 oz package of noodles and a whole pound of bacon. I did drain off some bacon grease but still used quite a bit, it is important to the flavor of the dish. I also added some salt when I first put the cabbage in the pan to help pull out the water and a sprinkle of sugar towards the end to cut any bitterness. My husband was very upset that I was adding in his noodles and his beloved bacon to the evil vegetable, but then he said it was good and had thirds!! My teenager who doesn't like ham had it as her entire meal, it is filling enough to stand on it's own. I have a ton of leftovers and can't wait to eat it again!

This is a simple, quick and easy comfort food all in one meal. I used left over ham in place of bacon and it was perfect. I save bacon grease for cooking so was able to get the great bacon flavor and just added a tablespoon here and there when it needed it.

I love this recipe! I'd just want to point out that it is important to chop the cabbage finely, not too coarse. And also it takes much longer than 5min for the cabbage to wilt enough for us to enjoy the dish. We like it all mushy and soft :-) We also dress up the dish with plenty of salt, mustard and caraway seed. Thanks for this recipe, so simple yet it never crossed my mind!

This was so good.  My six year old devoured it!  They kept asking for seconds.  My very finicky hubby also had seconds.  This as is made a lot of dinner and I only put away a tiny bit for leftovers.  I made my own homemade noodles, and then followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  We called it "Hungarian stir fry", this one will be made and eaten without reluctance around here.

Made this for the first time tonight and switched it up a little...  I was out of egg noodles, so I used 16 oz box of whole wheat angel hair pasta instead.  Added 1 lb of fried low sodium bacon, 1 lb  cooked/crubled ground beef, 1 purple onion sauteed in bacon grease as directed.  Stirred all cooked ingredients back into the cooked noodles, topped w/black pepper and a little parmasian cheese....it was delicious! Definitely a keeper!!

Yum!  Used less bacon and less bacon grease!  Also, added 1 tsp of sugar while cabbage was saut√©ing and a little black pepper.  Easy to make with ingredients on hand.  Will make again!

The cabbage and egg noodles mix so well together in this recipe that I was able to fool my son into thinking it was bacon and noodles! I have to sneak in the veggies where I can. It's very filling and satisfying. And I disagree with the critics of bacon grease. It has no trans fats, and many food experts agree that lard is the new health food!

This is a cheap, filling and delicious meal!

I made this pretty much as is the first time (had no bacon but I had bacon grease so still had the flavor and added a bit of stone ground deli mustard) I made it again and added some red bell pepper. Delicious both times! I heartily recommend the mustard, it added a really tasty tang. 
I had never heard of Huluski until I came upon it in a "food on a budget" blog.

I let my onion brown before adding the cabbage to add some depth to its flavor.  Waited til cabbage was completely cooked before tossing in warm noodles and bacon.  I was expecting the flavors to blend; they didn't.  Maybe it will be better as leftovers.  (It made a lot!) I wasn't impressed, but my husband loved it.  Splashed on some cider vinegar at the table.

I cook the bacon till crisp and drain off grease, leaving about 2 T to cook cabbage and onion.  After cooked, add precooked noodles and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  You can use the fat free.  Makes a great meal or side dish.

We found this to be delicious!  We enjoyed it very much.  Comforting, tasty - what more can we ask for?  I think my proportions were a little off - more noodles than called for, and less bacon (by choice).  But it was still great.

Good one-dish meal - I cooked the noodles, set them aside, then made the other ingredients in the same pot.  Would be good with Kielbasa instead of bacon, too.

this was ok, I like the cabbage, noodle, bacon combo, but it was REALLY greasy. I even drained 1/2 of the bacon fat that was recommended off.

I would like to know why so many people that review a recipe say 'I followed the recipe to the t' then go on to say they just ommitted this or added that. If you omit or add to a recipe you did not follow it to a t. rediculous. You make your review worthless by changing the recipe at all.
i followed the recipe to a t. it is delicious, but probably not that healthy due to the fat content so we will not eat it often, but when I do it will be exactly like the authors. Thanks fior a great recipe.

This is absolutely delish! My children don't care for cabbage, so cooking it in the bacon grease helps to camo it.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't have egg noodles but I think you can switch without detriment to the taste.  Better the next day.

I made this last night and we loved it.  I agree with others that you need to get rid of most of the bacon fat or else it would be too greasy.  Otherwise it's yummy and I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was a good dish.  I really enjoyed and did use some of the previous hints of things to add especially some garlic for a little extra flavor.  I think even better reheated the next day

I make this often. An 80yr old gentleman who is Slavic taught it to me. He always  added cottage cheese at the end. It melts and turns creamy and it is out of this world!

SO good! Being Polish, we sometimes call dishes like this, 'Lazy Pierogi'. (It's cabbage here, but in another recipe, it could be cottage or farmer's cheese added.)  I don't normally use bacon when cooking cabbage, but I had some bacon grease in the fridge, so I started with that and a little olive oil for the onion. The cabbage was done in 15 min, as stated, and I added a little butter as it cooked. I also added a little black pepper and garlic powder. I pan-fried slices of kielbasa, and that went great with this. Just a little spicy brown mustard on the side to complete this. Dzienkuje (thanks) for this very good recipe!

I grew up next door to a lady from Salzburg, Austria and once in a while she would invite me to dinner. I loved her cabbage and noodles and so she made sure to call me over whenever she made it. 
Thanks so much for this recipe, it is as delicious as I remember it to be and brought back a bunch of good memories.

My wife and I have cut meat out of our diet, so instead of 1/2 lb. of bacon, I cooked up 2 slices of diced Tempeh based vegetarian bacon and fried that in olive oil. In place of the egg noodles I boiled up and rinsed some quinoa and brown rice based ziti noodles, and drizzled Olive oil over them once they were added to the cooked cabbage. Salt and pepper to taste, came out really good.

I made this last night. I really liked it. I thought it was a little bland, so I added about 1/2 cap of apple cider vinegar and some soy sauce. And that did the trick. Also, I didn't have any egg noodles and only had wheat macaroni. So, I used those. 
Overall, I love this and I will definitely make again.

I added onion and caraway seeds, and backed odd the butter, maybe 3/4 of a stick.  It would be pretty awesome with kielbasa, but quite tasty and hearty on it's own.

Excellent.  I've made it for years but never had exact amounts of ingredients before.  Didn't change a thing (when people change everything it irks me) and it's great.  The texture of the firm cabbage paired with the noodles and bacon is soooo good.

We loved this!  I didn't use bacon (to cut calories) and instead, I added a ground beef patty I had leftover.  I used no Yoke egg noodles, which I'm sure doesn't matter, I am only mentioning it because I have never heard of them and thought it would be helpful to some.  Mine came out more like a casserole, but man was it good and pretty easy.  I will definitely make again with ground turkey and may even through in a bit of bacon. ;)

I made this for dinner. It was really good. I added a few eatra ingredients to it. I added an apple, red onion as well as white onion and a little cayenne pepper. It tasted a little blan which is why I added the cayenne pepper. I didnt add enough where it was hot and spicy but just enough to add a little flavor. It was really good.  The red onion and apple added a little sweetness which was nice.

I made this and added smoked sausage and some fresh garlic.  It was good, but my husband and I thought it still needed more flavor.  I think the next time I make it, I will use kielbasa or cheddar wurst, because both are very flavorful and maybe some other spices.  I also didn't use all the bacon grease as others have said.  This was good, but it will get better.

This dish is amazing!  I've been making it for years, handed down by my Hungarian grandmother.  She used to make it with home made noodles.  I make this using the same ingredients, with the addition of a nice dash of paprika.  This was (and still is) the best comfort food!  FYI: it tastes good made with turkey bacon too.

This is good!  It's easy, quick and delicious.  The only thing I changed, was to add some season salt.  As good as this recipe is, I much prefer a similar recipe that uses a pound of bacon, and sour cream, rather than the sausage and parmesan cheese in this recipe.

I drained most of the grease, only reserving about 3 Tbl, using 1 to fry the onion and the rest for the cabbage. I added 1 Tbl caraway seeds, some ground white pepper and used 12 oz noodles (just to increase the number of servings because we have a big family). It was really yummy and we really enjoyed it! Thank you for the recipe!

Love this, hubby thinks we should start a food truck business and serve only this dish. LOL I always make sure to add a little dry white wine while the cabbage is cooking, and never, EVER forget to top with Swiss or smoked Gruyere cheese. Incroyable!

Delicious, takes more time to cook the cabbage than recipe states. Use common sense on the amount of bacon grease to use.  Turned out great.

This was tasty but I think you need to drain some of the bacon fat. I was really greasy.

Made this, good but needs spices, don't forget some s/p I used seasoning salt.
Also way to much bacon grease I took all but maybe a 1/2 a tablespoon then added 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter.  Very good, I will make again.

I used this recipe & the fried cabbage & bacon recipe as I liked the spices in the second recipe.  Very tasty, I would use only half the salt.  As I think it was too much salt.

This dish has been in my family since I could remember. It's a dish I can keep eating even when I'm full. I personally enjoy it without the bacon, but with cottage cheese on top after its cooked. My father enjoys it without the bacon but with carmalized onions.

This dish is phenomenal. I have never been as pleasantly surprised by a recipe before; it far surpassed my expectations. I was hesitant to try this recipe at first because it seemed too simple to be so good. I thought it would be bland. The number of positive reviews peaked my curiosity though and I decided to give it a chance; and boy, I'm glad I did! This turned out far from bland, and the combination of simple ingredients makes something delicious and comforting. Cabbage Bacon Pasta is now a part of our regular rotation. My kids (5yrs & 12yrs) love it and always ask for seconds. When there are leftovers (sometimes we scarf up the whole pot), try it the following day straight out of the fridge. It's just as good cold and it is hot! Give this recipe a try; you won't be disappointed!

I have made variations of this dish dozens of times. I recommend adding a tablespoon of caraway seeds to the finished product. And, for better presentation, use red cabbage instead of green.

How is it that after reading all the reviews I, a child of Eastern European immigrants, didn't know about cabbage and noodles? Even my neighbor downstairs (whose parents came from Puerto Rico) was a fan and cooked it twice a week.

In any case, I just finished eating my first plate of this recipe. Ironically, this is also my first review on the site. Simply said, this was an incredible recipe. I cooked everything as recommended and was very happy with the results. The combination of bacon, cabbage, onions, and noodles was perfect. I initially forgot to include the garlic salt and that made a huge difference.

Make this and be happy.

I made this last night and loved it! I made a few small changes. Left the butter out, added garlic and pimento to the onions. This will become a regular at my house!

This stuff is delicious!  I followed the recipe except emptied most of the bacon fat.  It was even better when we ate the leftovers the next evening. I love recipes with few ingredients that are simple to make and this one was perfect.

So versatile! I cooked bacon first, then added mushrooms with the onions and seasoned with garlic and red pepper, then a mix of both red and green cabbage. Then added the chopped bacon after the cabbage was soft. Finally, after hubby & I BOTH had 2 servings, I had a lot of left over chopped cabbage, so cooked it up with the leftovers. It was just as good as the original batch. Looking forward to having this again!

I didn't have bacon so I made this without. Couldn't stop eating it. Healthy recipe. The chewy noodles add just the counterpoint for the crisp cabbage.

This has been very tasty every time. I generally reduce the amount of butter and sometimes substitute smart balance instead. The amount of bacon and cabbage can be adjusted depending on your mood. Depending on the yield of grease from the bacon, I usually poor some of the bacon grease out. Leaving it all seams a bit decadent and can sometimes make it too salty.

I also cook this regularly, using only a portion of the bacon grease and using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder/salt. This is an excellent dish!

This is good. I agree with others, drain some of the bacon grease. I didn't drain the grease and my finished meal is super greasy. Otherwise this is tasty and filling.

This is insanely delicious.  I make mine in the electric frying pan adding and cooking each ingredient one at a time.  It takes a lot longer but well worth it.  The only substitution is Thai noodles (gluten free).  Thanks for sharing.

This is a whole family favorite,kids too.  I don't like cabbage, neither does our  11 yr old. Though we both love this meal. I fry the cabbage first so it has some crispness. I hate soggy cabbage. Sometimes I added a little cheese what ever kind I have on hand.

Great recipe. I pretty much followed it exactly. Just used less bacon grease and added a little caraway seed, and fresh ground black pepper to the noodles. Also, minced, saut√©ed garlic with the onions. Very good.

Kind of boring.  The cabbage is still on the bitter side, and the bacon flavor on its own was underwhelming.

This was a BIG hit tonight! I've never been a fan of cabbage but this was perfect.  Even my usually picky 10 year olds cleaned their plates.  Husband went back for seconds which is always the final seal of approval.  I added a splash of red wine vinegar & used whole wheat egg noodles and turkey bacon to make it a tad healthier.  Perfect dish for a cold night!

As a vegetarian dish, I used caraway seeds and quartered Morning Star sausage patties added at the last few minutes of cooking.  I skipped the bacon and garlic.

As someone else posted, this is a Slovak dish that we eat on Fridays during Lent.  Thus, I omit the bacon.  I do, however, add caraway seed and freshly chopped garlic.  It's a family favorite.

Seems they called this 'Balushkies' on DD&D and my recipe on AllRecipes.com is called that.  (I am glad to hear the other names in the comments.)  I first had this at a diner in New Haven c.'60-61 and love the dish... I'm glad DD&D recalled it to me... I have it often nowadays.
