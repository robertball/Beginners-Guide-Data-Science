I followed the recipe to the letter except I used fresh vegetables.  It turned out delicious!!  Perfect consistency and wonderful taste!  The orange adds a twist.  I'm adding this to my regular rotation of dinners.

My version turned out pretty good.  I too went with fresh veggies.  I didn't have ginger and had to substitute soy sauce for teriyaki (and hense used a little less than called for 1/4 c).  For a zestier effective I used half orange juice and half lime juice.   I also added 1/8t of crushed red pepper for some spice.  Not bad considering all the variations I had to make!

We made this with frozen veggies (since we stocked up) and powdered ginger. Very good!

This stir fry was just what I was looking for!  I also tried to use some fresh veggies, including green onion, squash and red bell peppers.  I added cilantro and shallot to the sauce, and topped the entire dish off with sliced almonds, which was terrific!  Have already passed recipe on.

great recipe as written.  I only had fresh broccoli, and Onion.  It was great with the pork, I think any meat would work well.  I didnt have orange zest, and it was fine with  out it.  I'll make this one again!

Pretty Good! Still looking for the perfect stir fry technique and recipe. I used fresh veggies instead (broccoli, squash, pepper, onion, and mushrooms).  I liked it but will keep trying.

Love this!  I didn't change a thing.  had leftover pork loin from the night prior and a frozen bag of stir-fry veggies.  this is exactly what I was looking for.

I used fresh veggies (onions, red peppers, shredded carrots). The orange flavor was very pleasant with this recipe. As one who likes spicy, I may experiment and add some red pepper flakes and see what happens. Overall a nice recipe.

I love teriyaki stir fry, and this was a lovely variation. I did not find the orange to be overpowering. I did use fresh veggies and left over shredded pork roast. But I stuck to the sauce recipe and really enjoyed it. The orange cuts the typical sweet of the teriyaki making a nice change to stir fry.

Sorry Kathleen but this just didn't make it for us. Even with the gingerroot, mustard, teriyaki and garlic, found the orange zest dominated too much.

Really different. I loved it! I used pork loin instead of tenderloin, cut it in paper thin strips, and used ground ginger instead of fresh. I also used the juice of one orange and a splash of bottled juice and doubled the recipe for the sauce. Served with brown rice.

I substituted soy sauce for teriyaki - waaaay too salty, and the oranges weren't sweet enough to counteract it, have to try again.

I loved it! I wish I would have used fresh veggies as well. I did use fresh ginger root and it was perfect. The flavor of the sauce was perfect.

I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so I did some home made sauce (soy sauce, cider vinegar, toasted sesame oil, brown sugar, red pepper flakes and garlic) till it was a cup, and then did a cup of orange juice.  Loved the sauce as a leftover!  Yummy!

I didn't have grated orange peel, which probably would have helped a little, but overall, I didn't like this recipe as much as other stirfry recipes I've had. I didn't taste any hint of the Dijon mustard. If I prepare this again, I'll make sure I have the orange peel and make a few other modifications. It also needed a little salt; that helped the flavor a bit. Thanks, Kathleen.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe but my husband had two helpings.  I think I would like it better with fresh veggies.  Not sure I liked the sauce enough to try it that way though.

Not our favorite recipe, but I think using fresh vegetables would have made it better.

This was a great budget meal.  I will make it again, I made extra sauce as a condiment.  Hmm, forgot the mustard.  Oh well.

I just thought this was OK.  I wasn't crazy about that orange flavor with the pork.  My husband didn't seem too impressed.
