I am a husband/father and I actually made this dinner. It was super easy and a big hit with my family. My wife also appreciated a break from cooking Sunday dinner. I am pretty happy with myself.

This recipe was very good. I doubled the recipe because my pork tenderloins were 2 lbs each. I used a whole head of cabbage, an onion and a red bell pepper. I put in a roasting pan, after 20 min everything was still raw, I ended up roasting for 1 hour which cooked the veggies perfectly but made the pork dry. I live at high altitude so everything tends to take a little longer. The flavor of the sauce didn't really permeate the meat, maybe because I overcooked it. I think I will marinade the meat next time. I also think I'll start the veggies roasting and add the meat a little later. This recipe has real potential and will definitely make again.

It was pretty good but I like my food to have a bit more flavour.  I used plain white vinegar because I didn't have white wine vinegar and added an additional teaspoon of honey.  Also, I only used one pork tenderloin and 25 minutes was not long enough.  I needed to cook it for a total of an hour before the juices were running clear.  When I broiled it on low for 5 minutes the cabbage around the edges of the pan got burnt.  If do this again, I'll leave the rack in the middle instead of moving it 4" away from the element.  I'd also add onion and maybe I'll use a bit of mustard powder so that it has a stronger mustard taste as well.

The flavors in this were really good. I had to make a few minor changes due to what was on hand - I used dried thyme and used half regular Dijon mustard and half spicy brown mustard, I think it would have been as good if I had just used one or the other. My mistake was I used a loin of pork instead of the two small tenderloins so it took longer to roast, so my cabbage and apples got burnt on the bottom.

Surprising how delicious this was. Omitted the apples and just used a whole head of red cabbage seasoned with olive oil and salt and pepper. Placed a marinated pork loin on top of cabbage (hickory & bacon.) Roasted with a tray of acorn squash. Simple meal that hubby raved over. Took about 25 minutes for the squash and a little longer to get the pork to 145. Juicy and flavorful. A definite "make it again" dinner.

I cooked the cabbage and apples for 10 or 15 minutes on their own, then added the tenderloin.  Once the tenderloin was cooked, the apples/cabbage were also ready.  Tasty!  I would make it again.

Wonderful recipe, easy and I loved it. I did change it a bit. I added potatoes and carrots to the cabbage.  A complete dinner in one pan.

We all found that the cabbage tasted better the next day after I had cooked it about 15 minutes longer.  Next time I will cook the cabbage for about 20 minutes before putting the pork on top.  It was too crunchy.

Made it to the letter, it was fantastic.

The cabbage really cooks down - you could probably get away with using a whole red cabbage (softball sized), or 3/4 of a green cabbage if you wanted to make a one-pot (or pan, in this case) dinner out of it.

Easy and delicious.  I did add extra mustard and next time I make it I will use two full tablespoons.  I had to bake the pork for almost 40 minutes to get it to temp and it was not at all overcooked.

Figure 30 min per pound.  Under the broiler for 5 min. burned the meat (I didn't put the cabbage under as it was already well done.)  2nd time  did not broil at all and it was good.

Fresh picked savoy cabbage and apples from our tree. I really like the flavor of this, but it looks really bland. Cabbage is pale, apples are pale with only a little charring. I think Next time I would add a couple extra veggies..carrots are all ready in my garden too. The sauce, although good, was not enough , so I think i would make extra next time around to intensify the flavors at bit

I was surprised at how really good this recipe turned out. I had to substitute the white vinegar for apple but  otherwise no other changes. My husband, who normally doesn't like cabbage thought this was really good too. This one's a keeper in our house. Thank you for sharing this Molly!

Maybe it is just me, but I found this to bee too salty.  Will reduce salt next time. Do not like my pork pink in the center, so had to cook an extra 20 minutes to reach 160F.

Very tasty.  Mine cooked a little faster than what other reviewers reported so a little dry, next time will check it sooner.  Loved the charred apples and cabbage.

Super simple one-pan recipe that tastes like it took all day. Everyone enjoyed, including our toddlers. I brushed a bit more grainy mustard on the pork before cooking, but that was it. Served with steam-in-bag green beans for a beautifully easy meal. Will definitely be putting this one in the regular rotation.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! So moist and flavorful! My husband wanted me to make it again the very next  day after we finished it off!) I laughed and said we had to wait a month or so!) I used RED cabbage so it was gorgeous as well as delicious.

My husband and I really liked the flavors of this together!  I used whole head of cabbage and cooked each loin on separate baking sheets with 1/2 cabbage head and 1 apple.  I followed other reviewers who said they cooked cabbage/apple 15 min before adding pork, but perhaps I cut my veggies thinner because some of it burned. So next time I make this I will not precook veg/fruit and I will make extra mustard sauce and marinate pork loins in sauce before hand, as well as pour some over before cooking. Delicious combination of flavors, and will definitely be making again!

We tried this recipe as is for the first time. It was so easy, and it was a delicious one (sheet) pan meal with easy clean up!  The only thing we might do differently next time is add more Apple and cabbage. A must try!

Easy and delicious. I used red cabbage and 1 apple, and 1/2 Dijon 1/2 spicy brown Polish mustard. I started roasting the cabbage and apples for about 10 min. while prepping the pork and sauce. I recommend doubling the sauce, reserve half and then warm in the microwave to pour over the sliced tenderloin when done. Yum!

Loved it, but based on Jen's feedback I decided to tweak the spicing. The recipe makes an immense amount for two, so I used 16 ounces of pork (four small fillets packed for grilling.)  I cut up the cabbage and two granny smith apples as described and roasted them in the oven, with olive oil and soy sauce. I could have gotten away with 1/2 cabbage and one apple. For the pork, I slatherred the pork with mustard sauce, soy sauce, honey and ginger and fresh spices and grilled it in a skillet about 4 minutes a side. Then I combined the whole thing long enough to finish the pork in the oven. I booked it briefly. And then left it to rest for a few minutes loosely covered with foil. One thing, the apples really dissolved when they were under the broiler. I felt it was not a good idea to place the raw pork on top of the veg, so I grilled it which enhanced the appearance.

This is a pretty easy recipe to make for dinner during the week. I made a few changes and I feel that made this a little more flavorful. I changed the white wine vinegar to apple cider vinegar, tripled the sauce recipe and also poured it on the cabbage and apples. The tenderloin needed an additional ten minutes but it was well worth the time. This seems like a great recipe to prep and eat during the week for lunch.

Insanely good and simple - I used a coarse ground mustard and *tart* apples.    I also remove all the silver skin from the tenderloin.

Good Stuff!

The pork was great! Apples and cabbage were overdone to our taste.

I didnâ€™t use cabbage because my husband doesnâ€™t like it, and I still really enjoyed this dish. I did everything according to the recipe.

This was excellent! We followed the recipe almost to the t. We grilled ours and used a specialty oil and vinegar we got in CO. I served it with a sweet potato flat bread (1c flour, 1 c sweet potato) recipe I found on YouTube. We both loved it. Will make again.

This was a good combination.  Although for my taste, I will cut back on the vinegar next time.  Very tasty.  Easy clean up.  Not a lot of work.  We like cabbage so I used a whole head.

We  enjoyed this for dinner tonight, very tasty!  I also liked how easy it was to prepare-- simple easy steps, 1 2 3, and it was in the oven.  Surprisingly, the only modification I did was to use dried thyme instead of fresh.   I might try this with chicken next time, I just don't cook with pork often, but it is nice to diversify with a good pork tenderloin recipe occasionally.  This is a keeper.

I used a can of drained sauerkraut , instead of fresh cabbage.
I used honey mustard salad dressing on the pork , instead of the individual ingredients.  Very good!

Great recipe. Used basalmic instead of wine vinegar because that is what I had. My husband loved this easy meal.

Such a simple but flavorful and delicious meal! We used thin, boneless  pork chops and substituted french green beans for the cabbage (suggested variation from magazine). Even my picky toddler liked it!  We'll definitely be making it again.

My husband loved this recipe!  Healthy and delicious.  I had to kick the temp up. My tenderloins took longer to cook through. Will definitely make it again, for company!
