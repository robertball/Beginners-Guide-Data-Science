I was very eager to try this recipe as this is one of my favorite dishes at a local Thai restaraunt.  This salad was not as spicy as the one I was trying to achieve and far too sweet, however it was much better when I cut the sugar in half and added some diced thai peppers to the marinade.  I like it served over rice instead of lettuce.  One thing about the recipe was misleading and that is the time involved.  The recipe talks about preparation and cooking time but fails to mention the three hours needed to marinate the steak.  Unfortunately, I just glanced over the recipe the first time I made it and didn't allow enough time.  I really think that if a recipe requires time to marinate that should be in the heading area with preparation and cooking time.

Try these changes I bet you'll love them!
Use red Thai curry paste instead of the chili sauce. Next add bean thread or the clear silver noodles mixed into the salad!

I couldn't believe how good this recipe turned out to be! So easy too. I made it two days in a row. I think it makes a big difference to use the very best cut of meat you can afford. I used 1-inch shell steak pan-seared about 4 minutes each side. It's even better the next day after it's marinated for a while.  It's good as a salad or over rice (I chopped the vegetables extra small). I used more chili sauce and less fish sauce than the recipe. If you've never had fish sauce before, I really recommend that you start with just a little because it's quite strong.  I'm thinking about making this with tofu intead of steak next time.

I haven't tried this recipe exactly, as it is so close to the one that I use that they may have come from the same source.  The only difference is the addition of minced garlic to the sauce, and instead of sugar and sweet chili sauce, I use Splenda and ground chili paste.  
I also like to marinate the meat before cooking for extra oomph.  I just use a bit of the liquid portion of the sauce and discard that after removing the meat.
Here is a helpful hint about lemongrass - if you slice it very thinly and only use the tender white part, it makes a crunchy edible part of the salad.  I shudder to think about chomping on a one inch piece of lemongrass!
Another hint that this recipe includes is adjusting the flavor of the sauce.  When using fresh ingredients (lime, cilantro, etc.) there may be an extreme variance in flavors from one time to the next.  It is critical (IMHO) to taste the sauce and correct any imbalance before continuing.
This dish always receives rave reviews except from my quirky sister-in-law who doesn't like 'cold' meat.  I actually reheat some of the meat and sauce for her and she will eat it beside the salad.
Highly suggested for anyone with an adventurous palate!

Excellent recipe! This is extremely close to the salad you get in a Thai restaurant.  The only thing I would do differently is to decrease the amount of sugar and mint and increase the chile paste.  This is my husbands favorite Thai dish and he loved it.

I go to small little Thai restaurant the way they serve there salad is the meat is hot and they serve it with Hot rice.  Sounds crazy salad over rice but I wouldnt eat it any other way.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is good to find an alternative to the recipe I have always used. I got mine from a Thai chef when I used to work in a 5-star hotel in Malaysia which have 5 restaurants, including a Thai. Almost all is the same except that mine has minced garlic, does not use mint leaves and replaces lemongrass with finely chopped ginger and white with brown sugar. You may of course experiment which works best for your taste. I always put a lot of cilantro, because that gives me the uummmm! They name it 'koriander' here, by the way.

I always make this when friends and family come for the first time to our home here in the Netherlands, and I receive good comments EVERYTIME! They are most of the time surprised by the exotic combination of spices, expecially those who are not familiar with cilantro. Not everyone likes cilantro but luckily it combines very well in this concoction of flavors. They always request for it the next time they come. Thanks again!

This has really excellent flavor. I used leftover steak, lemongrass powder in place of the lemongrass, and thai basil (from a recent trip to the asian food market) in place of the mint and cilantro. Next time I will add some thinly sliced serrano chile rings. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this Thai Salad the last three to four years for my work Holiday Luncheon. It's always a huge hit. My only suggestion is that I like to substitute soy sauce instead of fish sauce as it's too salty for my taste. I also slice up some jalapeno peppers to give it extra zing!

We love this recipe. It's just like the beef thai salad we order in our favorite thai restaurant. I used a regular cucumber instead of the seedless English cuke and it worked fine.

This is VERY Thai...too much so for me.  I didn't care for the fishy taste or the strong mint flavor.  My husband really liked it though. I don't think I will be making this one again.

My husbands favourite salad!  We prefer to cook the meat a little less, the lime cooks it in it's own way anyway.  I add crispy fried noodles for a contrast in textures (not much for that low carb baloney!)

Love this recipe. Did not use the mint, as we don't care for it and used 1 T of lemon grass paste for fresh (couldn't find fresh). Let it sit overnight as some suggested and it was fabulous. Think I might sprinkle with some chopped dry-roasted, unsalted peanuts for a little crunch next time. A keeper!

I marinated this the recommended time and thought the recipe was only okay.  However, it sat in the fridge continuing to marinate for at least two days before I finally resigned to eat the rest of the leftovers....absolutely DELICIOUS!  The key is to let it marinate a day or more!  Wonderful summery flavor and gets all the way through if allowed to sit for awhile!

I made this for a friend who loves all Thai food and it got 5 plus stars!!!!!  I did leave out the mint leaves and used 1/4 cup splenda for sugar....it was superb!
And a quick tip:  my local Oriental market sells a big jar of frozen lemongrass minced for about $3.00...a very many more salads to come!!!!!  Thanks!

I didn't care for the steak cold, so next time I may make extra sauce and marinate the steak raw, then serve it warmed.  Other than that, the flavor was perfect!

Excellent just as written. Absolutely no need for any alterations. The only down side? I can no longer ask my husband to take me out to our favorite Thai restaurant for this dish when I can make it at home -- and make it better! Oh the perils of finding good recipes :)

This was delicious and easy to make. I always ordered Yum Nua when I go to the local thai restaurant and this recipe tasted almost identical!  Next time I will marinate overnight.

This was wonderful.  I did make a couple small changes - I realized the next day that I totally forgot to put the cucumber in.  Oh well, it tasted great anyway!  I also used about 9 mint springs (not a whole cup), and probably 1 cup of cilantro BEFORE it was chopped.  I also just used 1/4 C fish sauce (mostly because I'm pregnant and the fish smell wasn't too appealing).  I cooked the steak 4 min per side, and it was a little rare in the middle, but after soaking in the dressing for 3 hours, it was "cooked" just right!  Tastes just like the beef salad at the Thai restaurant that I love.

It was really good. I added chilipeppers and avocado to the salad and it was excellent! I also made homemade fish sauce by sauteeing anchovies, garlic, brown sugar, and water. It turned out very well!

I Love this Recipe, I did add more hot sauce, a little too sweet for my liking but it was just as good as Thai Beef salad in a restaurant.

This recipe is good.  I left my meat rare and I wish I had left it a little more rare as the acid in the marinade cooks the meat further.  Mine ended up well done by the time we ate.  
I didn't have any fish sauce, so I used soy sauce instead, it ended up a little sweeter because of it I think.  Also, I added a tablespoon of spicy chili sauce, but really wish I had added more, it wasn't very hot.  Other's recommended red curry paste and I wish I had tried that.  I also didn't have enough mint so only added about 1/4 cup, but I still felt it had a very strong flavor.  I would be leary of adding a whole cup.  
Over all, a very nice recipe.  I think it's strongest feature however is the fact everything can be made ahead of time, so all you need to get dinner on the table is five minute to assemble.  Perfect for nights you are home late.

Tastes excellent! I was worried at first that I put in too much fish sauce (in other recipes, I normally I cut the amount of fish sauce in half). But after marinating overnight, the other flavors really came out.

This comes very close to one we love at an authentic Thai restaurant . I cut down a tad on the mint and cilantro and used london broil that I had thrown on the grill the night before with another entree. Saves lots of time and energy! Thanks for a great recipe Mick!

I added carrots and snow peas as well. I also made a little less sauce than the recipe suggested and served the salad with rice. Whole family loved it, including my fussy 7 year old.

This recipe was awesome - as good as any yum neau (spicy beef salad) I've had at a Thai restaurant, and better than most.   I added carrot slivers and used 1/2 of a regular cucumber, peeled, sliced, then with the slices cut in half.

With a little less sugar (1/3 cup)and hot peppers instead of the sweet chili sauce this recipe tastes exactly like in Thailand! Yummy when you like thai spicy food!

This recipe is so good! I made a few
changes. I used a combination of lemon 
juice and lime, adding the zest from two limes. I also added bean thread noodles and I served chopped jalapenos on the side for those who like it hot. 
I didn't use the lemon grass or the tomatoes but I thought it was still delicious without them.

All in all I found the dish to be a winner. Personal preference was for a little less onion, and I would reccomend making the Lemongrass peices a little smaller. Overall though a beautifully tangy/fresh salad - goes well with a nice bottle of white!

Beef can be substituted with grilled cuttlefish.

Ok, I use five spice and about a tbsp of jalapeno powder in my fish sauce to spice it up a little. But this recipe is a great recipe even without my little tweaks. I also add all kinds of little veggies such as baby corn, cucumber, onions, tomatoes, peas, sometimes bamboo shutes(sp) and even pineapple on rare occasion. Also, try it with shrimp instead of beef for a fun variation. At first I was hesitant about fish sauce because I was afraid it would be "fishy" but it isn't at all unless you are just imagining it... ;)

One of my family's all-time favorites!  I pound the meat very thin prior to sauteeing.  My secret ingredient is roasted rice powder.  You can make it yourself in minutes and sprinkle on just before serving for a delicious crunchy texture.

The Thai salad I usually get at the restaurant is insanely good and unfortunately this came no where near close.  The only changes I made in this recipe was to cut the sugar down a bit and I used chili garlic sauce because that was all I had.  The fresh lemon grass and cilantro overwhelmed the taste of the salad -- it ended up tasting alot like a cambodian salad my mother makes -- still good but not what I think a thai salad should be.  I would probably make it again anyways but tweak it around so that it is comparable to the thai salads I'm used to eating.

A great salad. I couldn't find lemon grass at my market, so I used a lemon grass paste and it was still fantastic. A super hot weather dish.

I am not a big fan of mint, so left it out. I also used a little less sugar. I loved the sauce -it was like a flavour burst that was quite well balanced,  fresh and delicious. I have added this to my recipe collection!

Having lived in Thailand, I found this recipe to be very good although not quite like what I was accustomed to in Bangkok.  To modify I left off the mint and canceled out the sugar (personal preference).  Instead of adding sweet chili sauce, I opted for a spicy version.  Wish I could have found Thai chilis at the local market.  When I made the sauce, I kept part aside for dipping at the table.  

Very nice meal.

This was good. Next time: Regular or red onion, regular tomatoes, more chili sauce, and 2-3 T sugar. Maybe hold out some mint to display on top.

This recipe is simply amazing. Don't look at the ingredients and think you won't like it, because it tastes nothing like you'd expect from a recipe with fish sauce in it.

I had fondu beef in my freezer that i wanted to get rid of and decided a thai beef salad would be good for it. I made a few minor changes to the recipe. I added a tbs of hoisin sauce. I also subbed the white sugar with splenda since i am diabetic. I omitted the lettuce and tomatoes, i only used cucumbers. I let everything sit in my fridge for almost 2 days before i ate it, and it was really good and flavorful. The sauce smelled very strong, but mellowed down with the coriander, mint, and cucumbers. I'd consider buying fondu beef to "get rid of" again for this.

Absolutely delicious!  The lime dressing with cilantro and mint was so fresh, with the hint of fish sauce and chili sauce.  It had a slight kick that everyone loved.  Very authentic flavors.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous.  4 changes successfully made:  omitted lemon grass, subsituted 2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes for chili oil, reduced fresh mint to 1/4 cup, and used a 2-inch thick tri-tip roast on the grill (way better than flank in my opinion).  We will have this at least once a month.  Thank you for the AWESOME recipe!!!  It is intoxicatingly good!!

This is exactly like restaurant-style Thai Beef Salad. I reduce the sugar to 1/3 c. and use 2 lb. flank steak grilled to medium-rare.  I also like to add shredded carrots and sliced radishes.  Makes a great, light meal!

This is a tasty, refreshing salad that served as a main course. I marinated leftbover steak for just about two hours and it was definitely enough time for the flavors to soak through the meat. My entire family enjoyed it. Will definitely make it again!

Excellent recipe.  I cut down on the sugar (3 tablespoons) and used an unsweetened chili sauce.  I also drizzled the sauce and beef over glass noodles.  Delicious!

This is yummy, I think it is similar to a Thai restaurant here in Salt Lake City. I do think that there is just a little too much lime, i did add 2 cloves of garlic, i think that addition made it better. I will play with it next time. Thanks Mick.:)

Everyone loved it, lean and fresh!  Added jalapeño peppers and served it with rice and the salad separately.  Everyone put together their salad their own way

There are some problems with the proportions.  The ingredients are pretty much right, but there is WAY WAY WAY too much sugar.   I don't understand using sweet chili sauce and 1/2 c. of sugar.  That's pretty much insane.
Thai food has a nice blend of sweet, salty and spicy so those ingredients need to be closer together.  1.c of lime juice is pretty out of control, too.  For the amount of non-dressing ingredients, the acid (read: lime) and fish sauce should be around the same, and the sugar might be a little less.  I would NOT use sweet chili sauce, rather use chilies, chop them and stick them in the lime juice to marinate.  There's also missing garlic in the equation.  Take a bunch of chopped garlic and jam into the lime and chili mixture.

No joke, it was the best Thai beef salad I have had! Don’t let the smell of the fish sauce throw you off, it really makes the flavor. I have had it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner because it’s so amazing!

Loved this delicious,  healthy, salad !
I don’t like sweet, so I didn’t add the sugar.
I like spicy, so I added a tsp of Sarcha sauce 
Will always make again!

This salad is good but it's very strong. When I make it again, I will cut back on the cilantro and mint, possibly the lemongrass too.

This salad was amazing! I change two things: reduced the sugar to a teaspoon, rather than a half cup and I added cayenne pepper for some spice. The dressing was fantastic! Our family loved this meal and begged me to make it again. This is one of the best recipes I've come across and it will be made for years to come!

I thought this was pretty good though it was really sweet for my taste. I even added two birds eye chili peppers and Thai chili paste. In the future, like others mention is to cut the sugar in half. I marinated ribeye steaks for 24 hours too. My family thought it was great.

l never had Thai beef salad, but I love Thai food.  Made the recipe as written with the exception of using freshly squeezed lime juice.  I love this recipe. It is so delicious. I made it with rib eye and NY Stripe.  Also added in shrimp.  Delicious!!!!

Delicious! After reading other reviews I decreased the sugar. I did not have lemongrass. I marinated the meat in soy sauce, molasses, brown sugar, garlic & coriander prior to cooking. Several reviewers mention the fish sauce as overpowering but I think to have an authentic taste you need to use the amount in the recipe. Just my 2 cents. This is a fabulous recipe.

I make this with the following changes to make it less sweet, and more spicy. I double everything, except for the following:
-Use 1/2 c of sugar total.
-Substitute 2-3 T of chili paste for the chili sauce.
-use 1/3 C-1/2 c of fish sauce, instead of a full 2/3. 
My family loves it, and it's one of the top requests for family get togethers.

This is a delicious dish. I skipped the mint, added carrot shavings, Thai red curry (about 1/2 tsp) and cut the fish sauce in half. We used a hanger steak (grilled at our market) and it was super! Be mindful of the time to marinade. :)

Other than cutting down on the lemongrass, this recipe is perfect just as it is. I did substitute Thai basil for the mint because my boyfriend doesn't like it. And if you're new to cooking with fish sauce it's okay to cut back a bit. It is a unique and pungent flavor.

I made this with leftover grilled ribeye steak. I reduced the amounts of the marinade but basicly followed the preportions [everything in half including the meat]. I was in the mood for noodles and enjoy leftovers. I cooked 2 packages of Ramen noodles, tossed them with sesame oil and one package of seasoning, then chilled them. No lettuce but lots of cilantro. After the meat marinated, put everyting together. Yum.

I'm not usually one for salads, but this one looked interesting and featured a big steak :) I loved all the flavors of the fresh herbs and citrus. I had some grapefruit habenero sauce on hand, so I added that until it was spicy enough.

I make this without the steak, and it always pleases guests.  As a guy that's pretty much a carnivore full time, the fact that  I have made this over and over again as one of my favorites even without meat speaks for itself.  This recipe is amazing.  Period.  Sometimes it can come off as a bit too salty/sour, so I tune down the appropriate ingredients by about 1/2 to fix that, and no worries.  Oh yeah, and I don't bother with the lettuce either.

Absolutely delicious.  So fresh!  I added thinly sliced jalapeno peppers (grocery didn't have Serrano) to amp up the heat.  Proceed with caution on the steak.  If I had cooked 4-6 minutes on each side, I definitely would not have a lively medium rare.  Compare the thickness of your steak and adjust accordingly.

Made this for a dinner party last night. Everyone loved it. I did not have lemon grass so I used zest and juice of one lemon. Love, love, loved it. I will try this with fresh tuna, salmon and shrimp.Great recipe, thanks for sharing!!! Another plus is that it can be prepared ahead of time and assembled at the last minute. I put a loaf of bread in the oven to heat up and before the bread was ready I had the salad prepared. I had time to actually visit with my guests.

Like some others thought it was too sweet so just would cut way back on the sugar  if using sweet chili sauce.   Also, although I love lemon grass, 1 " pieces are wayyy to big unless simmering in a broth.

FAVORITE THAI DISH EVER!!!
this is my favorite thai dish. my husband makes this for me and i make him thai basil rice (his favorite). i don't change a thing. reminds me of my favorite thai restaurants here in town one of which closed down much too soon; the other changed hands and it's just not the same. i don't change a single thing.

We made a few changes to the recipe and it turned out amazing. We added some sweet soy sauce to the mix, as well as sambal chilli sauce. We also added one red pepper and a grated carrot for more vegetable flavor.

Excellent. I cut the lemongrass finer than 1 inch so you're not overpowered with a mouthful of lemongrass. I've made this salad several times, once with meat straight off the grill (hot) and it is good that way also.
