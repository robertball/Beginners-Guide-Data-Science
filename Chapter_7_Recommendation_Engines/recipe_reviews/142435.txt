Hubs walked into the kitchen as I was making this - uh-oh!  The buttermilk carton was on the counter, so I quickly hid it under the sink before he could see it. I knew if he knew there was buttermilk in it, this smoothie would be doomed. I watched as he quickly drank the first glassful and I asked him to comment while I poured him a refill (this was about 30 seconds later).  He said it was "peachy," (of course he MEANT "nectarine-y"), and that there was "something odd about it - but in a good way." Only after he finished the last of this 2-serving recipe did I reveal there was buttermilk in the drink, to which he quickly scrunched up his nose. And then he rated it four stars.  I never saw him drink a smoothie that fast. I made this exactly as the submitter directed and threw a few ice cubes into the blender as well.  Hubs said he appreciated that this wasn't so cold that it gave him an ice cream headache.  Maybe that's why it went down in a New York Minute.

I do like buttermilk in a smoothie, but it was too dominant here, and though I used sweet ripe nectarines, their flavor did not come through as I was expecting. Because the recipe doesn't use frozen fruit or ice, it was warm, which was not appealing. I added a frozen banana after the fact which helped make it slightly icy and more refreshing. Ice cubes would dilute the flavor even more. I might make this again if I have buttermilk to use up, but I would chop up the nectarines ahead of time and toss them in the freezer overnight, cut the buttermilk in half and make up the difference with orange juice.

I would give it five stars, but I didn't think that was fair considering that I changed the recipe some. I took CC's advice and chopped the nectarine up, froze it and then used half OJ and half buttermilk. The buttermilk would have been overpowering if I had used the full cup. (and I love buttermilk!) So the recipe, as is, would be good, but not something I make again. With those changes, it is now my all-time favorite smoothie!

I made this twice.  The first time was good.  The second time I put a couple of handfuls of ice in as the mixture was blending and it turned out GREAT!

I was really surprised by how tasty this was!  I'd make it again except I peeled my nectarines and I'm no good at peeling or even chopping nectarines, so this drink took longer to prepare than I'd have liked.  I also used homemade buttermilk (milk + vinegar).

love buttermilk and this is great - no sugar needed. Does need to be well chilled.  Other fruit can be used, but prefer nectarines.   Thanks.....

This was AWESOME! I wasn't sure about is because I don't like buttermilk, but it was really very good. I added ice and strawberries after trying to original and both where great! I really recomend this for a quick healthy snack!

This was great! It was a bit too sweet for me though so next time, I'll cut down the sugar a little. However, I didn't have buttermilk so I used some milk + vinegar and maybe that makes a difference in the amount of sugar needed.

Very good, and good for you! I did find the buttermilk flavor coming through a tad strong, so I think I'll cut back on that next time and supplement with regular milk or, as other reviewers tried, with orange juice. The nectarine flavor is great and its just so simple to make! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was better than I thought it was going to be! Nice change from your typical blended drink.

We had picked up 5lbs of Nectarines and we needed to use them quickly. This recipe is surprisingly great. I thought the buttermilk would make it taste sour, however, the sweetness of the fruit with buttermilk made this taste outstanding.  I use an extra nectarine and some extra ice and this was something I will make next summer as well

I tried this because my daughter had her wisdom teeth removed and needed a smoothie, I had all of the ingredients so I decided to try this one. I always make my own "buttermilk" by using regular milk and lemon juice (1-1 1/2 tsp lemon juice then fill to the 1 C line) so that was the only slight change I made. This prevented the overly strong buttermilk flavor many people observed. I used white nectarines that I had allowed to ripen until soft, then had them refrigerated...perfection.

Hmm, well, this just did not go over well with me.  About the only reason I could give is that it was "too much."  I did peel and freeze the nectarines first, because I already knew it would be almost warm if I didn't.  So if you happen to like this, I definitely would suggest the freezing, and even half-freezing the buttermilk.
