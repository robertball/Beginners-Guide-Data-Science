I'm not sure what county fair this is from, but this rolled variety is not what's served at midwestern county fairs.  Our elephant ears are plate-sized deep-fried lumps of dough sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.

it's just what i was looking for but didn't have time to refridgerate for 2 hours, following another review, i left out the yeast, egg and water, and used buttermilk in place of scolded milk, and reduced baking time down to 5 minutes as mine were rolled very thin. will definatly make again and again.

Taste: Delicious.   Mess in kitchen: substantial. So basically what you're doing is making cinnamon rolls, but instead of leaving them as rolls, you smash each roll into a large flat circle, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, and bake like a cookie.   A few notes about the recipe:  1. When it says a "lightly floured surface" - read that to mean dump at least 1/2 cup of flour on there, because this dough is so sticky.  I had to knead a lot more flour into it to make it work at all.   2. I found it easier to just smash the rolls into circles with my hands rather than using a rolling pin (and faster too). 3.  MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL.....The whole bit about ungreased cookie sheets - DON'T do it.  Use parchment paper.  Seriously.  I could barely chisel some of these off and one of my cookie sheets will never be the same.  4.  Mine were done in 10 minutes.    Altogether, a very tasty treat that my children are already begging for me to bake again.

I have made this recipe several times.
It's better than a danish pastry. Light and tender.

Not a bad recipe but tasted like shortbread cookies. Not at all county fair elephant ears that I have had. I'm not sure if they would even work fried because they just don't have the right taste.

I have been making this recipe for years and except for refrigerating the dough after step #4 and again after step #5 (makes it much easier to handle) and using parchment, make them as written and they're absolutely delicious.  I don't know or care whether or not they're "county fair", but they're pretty close to those made by the small local bakery of my childhood. My family loves them.  And skipping any of the ingredients makes this a different recipe.
