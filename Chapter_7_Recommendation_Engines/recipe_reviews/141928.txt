Tanya- you are right. I neglected to mention the most important part- to cover the ingredients with water! Thank you for pointing that out :)

This is the best chulent, since I found this recipe this is how I make it all the time. Chulent is a Jewish dish cooked usually for Sabbath and not a stew.  The only changes  that I did is that I cooked  the onion in about 2-3 tbsp. of oil until is soft and translucent and added to the slow cooker and mixing with everything, I didn't use garlic and I used beef brisket and bone in, skinless chicken breast( my husband prefers the chicken). Also I covered with water and on top of everything I put some whole, in shell and uncooked eggs. When the chulent is ready you will remove their shells, they will have a dark colour and are very good. I forgot to mention that before I put the eggs in I washed them very well with dish soap. Thank you Niki11784 for a wonderful recipe.

This recipe looks intriguing and delicious.  Question: There's no liquid mentionned other than the condiments/sauces. I can't believe that's enough liquid given the dry beans and barley which both soak up lots. Advice?

After researching this dish more, I see most people cover it with water, and that's what I ended up doing, even though it was a crockpot, and that worked.

Did not care for this.  I thought it had possibilities, but there are other stews that taste better.

We did not care for this recipe. My family is not picky...but everyone asked that I please never fix this again.
