Delicious! I added kidney beans and used whole wheat macaroni to add some more fiber. A great dish, will be making again!

My family loved this very simple recipe and with a couple of very small changes it would be a five. This is not a "Nice enough for company" meal.  It essentially makes a very tasty homemade Hamburger Helper with a slight southwestern tinge. The two things I tweaked were very small and I only decided to do them when I didn't like the way something was turning out as I cooked it.   I added a slight bit of milk to it before I added the cheese to make it more bubbly and moist and I also added a couple of more tsp. of the picante than suggested...just to use up the entire bottle.  It was very simple and easy to make.

We used ground turkey, 2 stalks celery, minced garlic and onion (to taste), 2 cans Campbell's healthy request cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup Pace salsa, 1 15.4 oz can corn drained, 1 cup cooked elbow noodles, 1/3 soup can skim milk, salt and pepper (to taste) and sharp cheddar cheese (to taste).  My husband sprinkled crushed red pepper flakes on his.

This was AWESOME be-c it was fast & easy and most important delicious!! Especially considering i didn't have the answer to the dreaded question: "What's for dinner (6pm)?" and it was already 5:37.  I happened to have just enough leftover jarred salsa and leftover Fritos jalapeno cheddar dip, from new yr's party to make this work. i didn't have celery but i think it was fine w/out it. In fact, when i make this again i still wont add celery be-c i'm afraid it will mess it up since celery has such a strong taste. I will also continue to use the jalapeno cheese dip as that is what takes this ordinary meal over the top! I think i'll make a custom version recipe since it was so yummy!

I didn't have celery so I added onion and garlic while browning the beef.  My husband and son loved it, but I felt this recipe was missing something.  For me it needed a little spice and crunch.  I added some hot sauce and it was better, but I think next time I will add jalapenos and tortilla chips. Overall, I think it was just okay.

My husband thinks this is great.  He even said he "enjoyed it" the next day (unusual for my man).

This was a yummy and great quick fix meal!  My husband is a picky eater, and doesn't usually like things I prepare with cream soups.  I never told him this had cream of mushroom soup, and I never will :)  My husband said he really like this!

This is a terrific recipe. My children ate it right up. I have a gluten-free daughter so I subbed the cream of mushroom soup for 10 oz milk mixed with 2 Tbl cornstarch and 1 tsp beef bouillon. Instead of mixing the pasta in, I let my kids choose between pasta or tortilla chips. I also saut√©ed 2 carrots with the beef and celery instead of adding corn. We had sour cream and sharp cheddar on the table to add. On my second bowl I squirt about 1/4 tsp mustard on top. It mixed in really nicely and added a bit of zing. If it's too bland, the mustard does a nice job changing that. This was really fast. Thanks!

Looks less than appealing but was surprisingly good. I used ground turkey in place of the beef. I added about 1/3 can of skim milk and a bit more salsa than what was called for. My husband and I really liked it. The kids thought it was just ok.

This was yummy! Instead of Pace Picante sauce, i used almost a cup of salsa and 2 tablespoons of sofrito. I didn't use celery,and i added onion salt and salt and pepper. Also at the end I added 3 heaping tablespoons of sour cream, which made it delicious! We ate it with tortilla chips, which made it perfect.
