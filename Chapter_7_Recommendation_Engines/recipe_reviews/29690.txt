Sharron;
  Glad to hear you like our soup.  However, here in Tampa and down on the island it is Collard Green soup or Garbonzo bean soup (in English).  If you like your recipe, I think you will also like this one.
    1cn chicken stock
    1 sm cn garbonzo beans
    1/2 link chorizo sausage, 1/4 to 3/8" cubed
    1/2 med onion, med diced
    1T (heaping) garlic, minced
    1T tomato paste
    1/2 sm potato, 1/4" dice
    1 handful collard greens, 1" chop (no stems)
In a pot (1 qt), saut'e onions until they just begin to wilt.
Add chicken stock and all remaining ingredients.
Cook until collards are almost done and turn off heat and let stand, covered, at least 2 hours.
Reheat and serve.
Serves 2

Enjoy.

Last night was our first freeze of the year, and my
husband said this soup was perfect for lunch. It is
a very hearty, filling, warming soup. I had dried navy
beans and fresh turnip greens on hand so I used them
rather than the canned and frozen varieties. I soaked
and cooked the beans first and then followed the
recipe. For the greens I first chopped them before adding
them to the soup--I used a gallon zip bag full and could
have used more. I served the soup with homemade cucumber,
squash, and beet pickles and a pan of cornbread--a great
fall lunch or supper!

Not having any salt pork, I kind of improvised a bit. I added some crushed garlic, a diced hot pepper, and sliced turkey bacon in with the onion. Then I made a broth of diced tomatoes and water, to which I added a little bit of soy sauce and some hot sauce. The turnip greens were fresh, and I used Great Northern beans. Served with cornmeal muffins this made a full meal- enough to fill my husband up, which is saying something!

I had to make a few modifications.  I started with dried Navy beans.  After I soaked them I rinsed and drained them.  I needed liquid so I added a pint of homemade chicken stock.  I couldn't find turnip greens either fresh or frozen so I used some beautiful fresh beet greens.  I realize these are significant changes, but I feel one of the things that makes a good recipe is flexibility.  It may not be the traditional Cuban dish, but it sure tasted good.   I look forward to making it again when I locate turnip greens.  Thanks for sharing.

I accidentally bought frozen spinach instead of the turnip greens but it was still fabulous!  I also left out the pork for personal preference and didn't miss it at all!

I left a star off this very good soup because I believe the author may have forgotten an ingredient.  To make this soup thin and look like the picture, I added two cups chicken stock and one cup water.  Also, a "Navy Bean" is a small, white bean, smaller than a Great Northern.  So, you are looking for cans of small, white beans (they may not be labeled "Navy").  Lastly, frozen turnip greens are hard to come by in some western states.  However, fresh turnip greens and turnips are probably available.  I used two bunches of fresh turnip greens, stems removed, and one small turnip, cubed, with very good results.  "Pepper vinegar" is hot sauce.  I served this soup to my guests with several different bottled hot sauces, so everyone could select their favorite brand of heat.

I tried this recipe and have made it for friends several times. They always ask for the recipe. It's my favorite winter soup.

I cheated and used (1) whole sweet onion (sauteeed), 1/2 stick of butter (unsalted) (2) 16oz bags of collard greens, (2) 12oz.bags cubed ham(smoked) (1) 26oz. chicken broth, 1 tsp.brown sugar, 1 tsb.garlic powder It turned out great.I used a big pot on the stove.Once collards are wilted just let them simmer for flavor that will make your tasted buds holler.   Gonna make Bisquick cheddar cheese biscuits to go with it.

Very comforting dish and super easy to make.  We used thick cut bacon instead of salt pork and added about a cup of beef stock.  Also added some hot pepper flakes to give it some kick.

Is there broth missing from the recipe? It was too thick. I was hoping for a lighter, brothy soup. Next time I will add chicken or vegetable broth. Mine looked nothing like the picture....I strained out the canned juice, added chicken broth and had the best tasting soup that I have had in awhile. The canned juice tasted "canny".  Veggie or chicken broth did the trick. I can't wait to make it again. Very homey and nourishing. And it is good with home made pepper vineger and a side of hot buttered cornbread. Add a bottomless glass of iced tea and this dish takes a southern turn.

This soup was not the most appetizing to look at, and I was a little bit nervous.  But it was sooo good.  It tastes nice and rich and buttery from the navy beens.  I did add a little vinegar for some punch.

Really good! And I can't use the pepper sauce.  I like the use of the greens.  We will be having this again. 
It was even a hit with my church group.  I had several ask for the recipe.
I did use homemade chicken stock and drain the beans before adding. I only had one bag of turnip greens so I also used one of collard greens.

My pantry forced me to tweak the recipe but it was great. Dried beans, fresh greens and roast chicken.  I will definitely make this again.
