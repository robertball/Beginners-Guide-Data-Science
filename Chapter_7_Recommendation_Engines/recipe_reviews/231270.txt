OMG! This is my new favorite way to make rhubarb! Loved it and ate too much! I did it exactly as directed. Similar to lemon bars but rhubarb.

Yummy! Quick and easy dessert for rhubarb lovers. Grandma Bev was my mother. She grew the rhubarb and made this with freshly cut fruit. But in the winter she pulled a bag of her frozen rhubarb out of the freezer and made it too.

The taste is very good, I added a handful of quick oats  along with 1/4 tea. of nutmeg to the crust when mixing.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Baked in 11 x 8 pan.

So easy and so yummy. Very similar to lemon bars. A friend who had never had rhubarb asked if there was lemon, and to her surprise, there is none. As good as my Ohioan mother-in-law's rhubarb pie, but easier. I added rolled oats to the bottom crust. Make a double batch and freeze the bars. So good frozen. Nice for when friends drop by. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this crisp but I did find it too sweet and next time I will reduced the sugar in the filling.  I probably should have tasted my rhubard, maybe it was sweeter than it generally is, but I would watch the sugar.

Tasted awesome. I also agree with the timing thing. My crust took at least 40 minutes to get brown and then after adding rhubarb took at least 50 minutes for that to be done in the oven. I also omited the sugar and used xylitol and tasted awesome, just like I said!!!!!

The crust took 45mins to get golden brown,But I used Blue Bonnet not Butter? It could use some crumb mix on top,But easy to make, I topped with some coolwhip & cut up fresh strawberries(when cool) YUM

I won't make this again.  Too sweet and it never did firm up.  I baked it  55 minutes.  A runny mess!

Made this yesterday it was delicious. It was liked by all even my 19 month old Granddaughter. The problem I had with the cake was that the next day the crust was soggy. Any suggestions?

Made this today.  It is good!  I prefer tart over sweet, so I reduced the sugars by 1/2.  If you don't have time to make pie...this works!  The timing was fine in my oven for the crust, but gave the the next step an extra 5-7 minutes.
