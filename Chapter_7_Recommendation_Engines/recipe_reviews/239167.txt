I made two batches, one with coconut oil, and one with olive. The coconut oil was better! If you choose to bake instead of fry, keep an eye on them, make sure to stir them up. Thinner ones got a bit charred, but were still delicious. 
I had the oven on 450, about 10-15 minutes on each side.

I liked the flavor of these, but I believe they would benefit from a bit more oil.  The potatoes seemed a bit dried out, and I was a bit disappointed by the lack of any sort of crust on the outside.  Thanks for the idea, I will tweak a little, next time.

The spices for the sweet potatoes are just right.

These are amazing. The coconut oil really gives them a great background flavor. I still haven't determined the best cooking temperature but I've baked them at around 400-425 for 15 mins and then cranked it up to 450 at the end to try and crisp them up a bit.

Iâ€™ve made this twice, once with white sweet potatoes and once with orange... excellent!  I have spice blend of garlic, chili, paprika and chives, I use that, garlic salt, smoked paprika, cumin and fresh ground pepper, whole family loves it!  And I love that it calls for coconut oil, good choice.

These came out great.  I sprayed with coconut oil and added a pinch of cayenne to the seasoning.  Delicious!

I followed the directions as written. I did find they weren't crispy, but that was alright with me. I ate some plain and some I used with a peanut dipping sauce. I've got my lunch ready for tomorrow.

Loved the sweet potato chips. Used crushed garlic instead of powder. No salt as not needed. Cooked in air fryer.

Made as instructed. The coconut oil smell is unpleasant and they are browned but soggy. I will wait to taste when they cool down.

Very tasty. I think the coconut oil makes them crispier than other recipes I've tried.

I used olive oil and seasoned salt.  Everything went into a bowl to mix...spread on baking sheet and cooked at 425 for 20 minutes,  Very good!
