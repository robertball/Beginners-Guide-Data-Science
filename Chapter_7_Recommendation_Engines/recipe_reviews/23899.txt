This was a great recipe. For my own personal tastes, I made it with the following changes: I used 1 prepared pizza crust and did not precook it. I beat the eggs and added the chopped onion and pepper and cooked/drained/crumbled sausage (I used hot sausage) plus the bacon bits and a little bit of Picante sauce to give it a kick. I pan fried the egg mixture so it was solid but not fully cooked. Then, I used the cream of soup (any of the Campbell's cream soups worked well) as my sauce (only about 1/2-3/4 can was used). I  layered the cooked egg mixture with the Cheddar cheese (2 layers of each). Then cooked according to the dough's directions. Each slice was very filling and all the ingredients were mixed together instead of layers of the ingredients. Very delicious. Everyone asks me to make it over and over again.

This was fun to make, solid recipe!  I made two of these for a company brunch for about 25 people ... they were devoured in about an hour!  I used COUNTRY GRAVY instead of the soup.  I also used PILLSBURY PIZZA CRUST that you can get from the biscuit isle at the grocery store and re-rolled it to fit my pizza pans.  Good work, John.

This was really good!!  I was a bit conecerned about the cream of celery soup, but it was delish!!  I used turkey sausage, fat free cream of celery & omitted the bell pepper.  I also decided to add my onion to the eggs while scrambling them.  I will definitely make this again!
(Oh, & I only made 1 pizza - sausage)

I was not about to throw some bacon bits in with celery soup and call it a day so... I halved the recipe to make 1 pizza, used a pizza crust mix instead of a pre-made crust. REAL maple bacon!!! Omitted the green peppers (just because I was out but next time if I have them I will certainly toss them in) sauteed the onion, of which I used sliced pearl onions.   And last but in my opinion the winning change... I made my own white sauce as if I were making Cream chip beef on toast.   Heres how to do it: Melt 2tbs butter, over med high heat add 1 cup of milk and 2 heaping tablespoons flour whisk and cook over med heat until thick. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Everyone ate it up exclaiming over how good it was. "Much better than the schools breakfast pizza" says the 8 yr old =)

I love this, but I made some changes to better suit our tastes.  I didn't want to use 12 eggs, so I just topped the pizza with 4 raw ones (made some wells in the cheese to hold the egg) also omitted the milk and cream of celery soup altogether and increased the temp of the oven to 500 to make sure the eggs were done.  Very versatile recipe - thank you!

Replace the cream soup with homemade breakfast gravy!  I precooked the onion and bell pepper so they wouldn't weep water when baking.  I added the the precooked onion and bell pepper to the eggs, before lightly scrambling.  I use real bacon bits and lightly sprinkled on top of both pizzas.  Just before serving, sprinkle the top of pizza with diced tomatoes.

Excellent! I only made one, and I used real bacon on it. For the soup I used 'Cream Soup Base' from this site. My crust was 'Pizza Crust I' also from this site--it bakes up nice and thick. I only prebaked it for 5 minutes and I don't think it was quite enough; the bottom was pretty pale while the toppings were golden and delicious. Nonetheless it was cooked through and I got a compliment from DBF :) Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was great!  I changed a few things to my taste...I didn't pre-cook the crust (I use rustic crust and they don't require it).    I halved everything (except the eggs, I used 8) and only made 1 pizza.  I scrambled the eggs, milk, s&p, green pepper, onion and a pinch of jalepeno until it was starting to set but not fully cooked.  I spread a thin layer of cream of mushroom on the crust, followed by a thin layer of hot salsa.  Put the egg mix on top of that and topped it with sliced tomatoes and a sliced pre-cooked sausage link (didn't have any bulk sausage).  Topped all that with cheese and baked about 10 minutes...which I probably could have let it cook a couple more.  I thought it was excellent and my boyfriend loved it as well!

We altered this quite a bit for Southwest flair, reduced serving size to 2 people. ************** We used two lightly toasted (in oven/ to crisp) 8" flour tortillas instead of pizza crust, & omit the soup & milk in recipe. Spread 1/4c can (or jarred) green chili over tortillas. Put 2 cooked scrambled eggs, with 1/2c of saute chopped red peppers & onions on top of tortillas.  Added  4 slices of cooked microwave bacon coarsely chopped & topped with shredded Mexican style cheeses. Cooked directly on top oven rack under broiler until cheese is bubbly (watch that it doesn't burn!). This is a great late night snack also. Any topping broiled on a tortilla works great.

I have been making a breakfast pizza for awhile..Mine is a little less caloric,...Just scamble eggs (for 2 people I use 5 eggs)    Then as they are almost set up I add: what ever I have in the fridge..green/red/yellow bell peppers, zuchinni, scallion oinons, (or what ever color you have) black olives and some cheese ..What ever kind is available and at hand....Put a lid on the skillet and let everything meld together.....Wonderful..!!  The most time you spend is chopping..That's it !!!

Very good. I only made one and used refrigerated pizza crust. My husband doesn't like cream of celery so next time I think I will try cream of chicken or gravy.  
We had this for dinner. It was a nice change of pace from normal pizza.

Thanks for the recipe, John! This landed in my email a day or two before overnight guests so it was perfect. The only change I made was to use real bacon instead of bacon bits. A dozen eggs were a bit too much for two 12 inch pizzas, so I would use less next time. One pizza cut into six slices fed three of us easily with half a slice left--it's very filling. Next time I'll probably "healthy it up" with a whole wheat crust, egg whites, more veggies and low fat cheese--this recipe will be a great base for countless variations.

I have made this twice.  The first time as is and the second time with a few changes.  The second time a used real bacon chopped into larger bites ( I hate bacon bits) and I also used sausage gravy for the sauce instead of cream of celery.  Bad? yes? delicious? yes.  Thanks for the great recipe

A fun and delcious breakfast- perfect for entertaining or impressing at a potluck. I made one with turkey sausage and turkey bacon and another with green pepper, mushrooms, black olives, and onion. Both were great. Highly recommend!

This was a great recipe, very filling and wonderful alongside fresh strawberry preserves. However, I did have one modification: had no pizza dough, so I used  flaky biscuits (pillsbury), and flattened them on bottom of the baking pan. I only prewarmed them 4 minutes @ 375' preheated oven, and I didn't flip them before adding the top (eggs, soup, etc.). I raised the heat to 400' and baked about 18 minutes. I do suggest this idea to anyone who would like to try a twist on an already good recipe. My twin 3 year olds ate it "all gone!" Thank you!

HEY Peculiarmike...just a friendly FYI, below the picture, click on the 1 of 5 photos to see more views. Anyone can add one. I believe the one shown is from the review that stated she used whole eggs instead of scrambled. Hope this helps. I have made different versions of breakfast pizza, now I will have to try one with gravy for the sauce..humm sounds good.

Great idea but didn't like the cream of celery soup. I also didn't care for store bought bacon bits so I used real bacon the second time with just some cream in the eggs that I precooked some before putting on crust. I also tried it with the whole eggs and increased the temp some like Toasty Mama recommended and it was really delicious!! Yum! Thanks for posting! A great recipe to play around with. I'm going to try some mushrooms too.

This was very easy...and seems really versatile.  The cream of celery soup made a great "sauce" in lieu of tomato.  This made for a  filling meal!

Our grown children and their kids were coming for a family brunch and we wanted something different, something we could make and everyone could eat at the same time.  This breakfast pizza was excellent!  We plan on making it more often.  Thank you John!

To save a trip to the grocery store, I used crumbled crisp bacon I had cooked, cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery, red bell pepper instead of green, and Mrs. Dash Original Seasoning instead of salt, but those were the only changes I made.  The pizzas were delicious!  I'm eager to make them for my daughter and her family next time they come to spend the weekend.

This sounds yummy, but my husband makes it easy for himself by using left over pizza slices.  He fries a slice in a pan with a little oil, crust down to heat it and crisp it up again.  He turns it over for a little while so cheese doesn't melt off.  Puts it in a plate, then tops it with two over/easy eggs.  He loves it.

Easy and Delicious, made for our 2yr old's birthday brunch. Everybody loved it from age 2 to 70. We used country style breakfast links instead of ground sausage.

I scaled this down to make one pizza.  And I thought the sound of putting the milk and cream of celery soup mix as the base sounded odd, so I used a small can of sausage gravy that I had. I also omitted the green peppers and onions, due to the kids not liking them.  And I have to say, this was amazing!  Loved the sausage gravy as the base, I think it made the pizza shine.  I will definitely make this again.  One pizza was plenty for our family of four.  I used a premade Boboli crust, so I did not preheat it. I just spread the gravy on the crust, added all the toppings, and baked it.  I also only used about 1 1/2 cups of cheese.  This would be really great for a nice brunch with some fruit salad on the side. Again, I loved this!

This was delcious! I did make a few changes to the recipe. -I used maple sausage instead of regular
-I used betty crocker pizza pouch mix, so I also changed the oven temp to 425. 12-17 minutes
-1/2 as many eggs and milk
-cream of potato soup instead of celery because that's what I had on hand
And we didn't do the onions, bacon bits or pepper.
I loved this idea so much that I had to share a link to it on my blog! http://tipsfromtheheart.blogspot.com/2012/08/french-toast-sticks-or-sausage.html

This was really good.  I followed the directions except for omitting the bacon bits and green pepper.  I used pepper jack cheese instead of chedder which really made it great!  I also added crushed red pepper, sage and used green onion instead of white.  I topped the pizza with diced roma tomatoes.  I was a little unsure about the cream of celery soup but it actually blended well with the other flavors in the pizza.

This was very good!  I only had cream of chicken and was a little unsure about it, but it came out really good.  I just made one sausage pizza using pizza dough from my breadmaker, omitted green pepper and onion, just because I didn't have it and just didn't need to cook it for the whole recommended time.  I really liked the idea of turning over the crust after baking for 6 min.  It turned out crispier than my pizzas normally do.  Very good recipe, we will make it again! Thanks!

I used this recipe as a base and made some adjustments. Not many though. First off, I made smaller portions, a personal pan pizza rather than 2 pizzas. Instead of bacon, green onions and cheddar cheese. I used pancetta, spinach, mushrooms, fresh garlic and mozzarella. I did use the cream of celery, I picked out the celery bits, but I did not a lot of the milk and egg mixture because I didn't want to it to feel like a quiche. After baking I placed two fried eggs on top so that when you ate it, you could smear the yokes on the pizza. The recipe itself was awesome and with few alterations to make it your own, it was excellent still! I highly recommend this and am looking forward to making it again!

Have been doing a different version of this recipe for years. Used sausage gravy in place of the celery soup. Used larger crusts 1 can of sausage gravy per crust or if you have time make your own is always best. 1lb of bacon and 1 lb of sausage split between both pizzas. What isn't eaten freeze it and eat it when you are in the mood for it again.
Have never had this version, gave it 4 stars because I don't care for celery soup on a breakfast pizza to me it just doesn't sound right.

I’d never tried breakfast pizza before, so I used this recipe as a template. I was NOT  interested in using the soup, so I didn’t . I had artisanal flat bread, so that was the crust.  Enough for a hearty breakfast for two.  I chopped about a tbsp of onion and green pepper and sautéed them, then scrambled with THREE eggs. I sprinkled mozzarella dices on the flatbread, then the egg mixture, then a handful (maybe 1/8 cup) of bacon pieces. I topped with sliced fresh mozzarella from a ball, and some halved cherry tomatoes. I seasoned with Italian herbs, garlic powder and red pepper flakes. Ten minutes in a 450° oven and we were happy breakfast pizza eaters.

This is a wonderful and versatile recipe! I used two mini Boboli so that we could vary toppings by preference or dietary need. I didn't pre bake the crust but probably will next time. I also substituted thick white milk gravy for the cream soup to cut down sodium levels. Next time I think I will try using whole eggs instead of scrambled like ToastyMama did in her picture. This will be a staple recipe at our house!

We made this for dinner tonight was a high hit.  we grilled the fresh made cruiser from our bread machine and then I added seasoned pepper, garlic powder & sage to the soup milk mix.  Layered peppers & onion (cooked) then whole eggs bacon bits, prosciutto, green onions, & roasted tomatoes.  Took it back to the grill until eggs were committed through.  Super crusty crust and so many flavors.  We did a few less toppings for the kids, a big salute for a redo soon.

This was alright but next time I'd just do quiche for about the same taste with a better texture and less work. I did fried eggs instead of scrambled (just cracked them raw onto the pizza) and they ended up over done.

Great basic recipe.  I didn't have any bacon or sausage so I loaded my pizza up with veggies.  Zucchini, mushrooms, peppers, onions and garlic.  Celery soup was a nice touch.  Never would have though of that. Didn't have enough cheddar cheese so used some cheddar and some mozzarella.  Baked it on my stone for about 15 minutes.  Then topped with diced tomatoes. Yummy!  Nice crunchy crust.  Thanks for the idea!

We've made this several times now & it's so yummm! I made the pizza crust myself (the bread machine did most of the work! LOL). I didn't have any Cream of Celery soup the first time so substituted alfredo sauce and it was so good we just make it that way every time. I freeze it in individual portains so my family can just grab it quick to take with them to work. I added onions on both and mushrooms on one. Thanks for the recipe... it's a staple in our house now! :)

Great pizza!  Used fresh pizza dough from the local Italian bakery.  Puffed up very high - poked it to flatten, and poked several other holes to let gravy permeate the "deep dish" crust.  Used country gravy mix instead of soup mix,  added minced parsley and fresh sage to eggs, with a good dash of siricha sauce.  Nuked onion shreds in butter while cooking eggs.  Had a package of cooked bacon on hand, so sliced it on top of egss after adding onions.  Used colby-jack cheese to top it off.  My executive chef friend loved it and said she was going to make it a special at her restaurant.

I made this pizza for a morning Sunday School party and it was a huge hit. My pizza crusts were medium in size so I split the sausage between the two pizzas. I also only used 1/2 cup of the cream of celery soup on each pizza. I will make it again!
