I melted my chocolate in the microwave. These were a huge hit with my family. I will never purchase the high priced ones in the store. They were so easy to make and delicious. Definitely make sure you have a nice fresh strawberry when making these for better flavor.

What's not to love?! This is one of our favorite desserts. My son wanted to drizzle them with more chocolate after they dried, so he did, and did a pretty good job since it was his first time, lol. We enjoyed these for a nice, light dessert~YUM!!!!
