had a few extra fruits laying around that I needed to use up and this fruit salad was a perfect way to send them out with a bang! Light, refreshing, juicy! I can't give it a five just because I didn't have pomegranate and I had to improvise a little, though I'm planning on trying that some time. Strawberry yogurt was all I had, then I scaled the recipe down for 1 orange and 1 grapefruit. That was good by itself. Then I added 1/2 cup grapes cut in half and 1 banana. I also added a packet of Truvia sugar (complements the flavor of citrus very well for some reason) and then dash of cinnamon because that's how my mom flavored up our fruit salads (cinnamon adds a lot of flavor, little calories). I would definitely recommend this and will be making it again!
