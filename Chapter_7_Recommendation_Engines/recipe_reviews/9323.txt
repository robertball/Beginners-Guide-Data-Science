I've made this several times - varying types of veggies each time. The package of frozen stew vegetables made up the best. Thanks Elizabet!

I have often added chopped celery,chopped onion,  a can of mushroom soup and a can of celery soup(condensed, do not add extra milk or water). For pie crust I have used puff pastry or top with left over mashed potatoes, bake until bubbly.

Super easy to make.  Next time will cut back on the meat/veggie mixture so there is more gravy for the pie crust when eating since that is what my family likes best.  I used a dry turkey gravy packet for my sauce.  I used leftover corn from our "March Turkey Day dinner" and threw in frozen peas, and some cubed frozen hasbrowns.  My picky 3 year old ate this and she is strictly a mac and cheese gal!!!!  Excellent, easy recipe!!!!

Excellent! Very good use for leftovers. It came out a little soupy, but I guess that's because I used frozen veggies. We just soaked it up with bread, and the sauce did thicken a lot while cooling down. We loved it!

You'd never know it's leftovers!  Incredibly rich and tasty using shredded turkey and gravy.  I added fresh thyme, pearl onions, and sliced crimini mushrooms to the usual peas-n-carrots combo so it didn't taste like "Thanksgiving all over again."  I  heated my leftover turkey gravy on the stovetop, thinned it with a bit of stock, mixed in the veggies and brought it to a gentle simmer before adding it to the pie crust.  Couldn't be happier with how it turned out.

My husband and son raved about this recipe.  They were even more impressed when they found out I made it myself (they thought I bought it from the store!)  I didn't even have the full amount of gravy and it still turned out great!

Made this the day after Thanksgiving.  Great use of the extra pie crusts I had.  Next time, I would have 1 1/2 cups of gravy instead of 2 cups, a little "saucy" for my taste, but overall, great pot pie for the family.

I am glad I read that the ingredients "overflowed" and I used a deep dish pie crust.
I also added some diced sweet potatoes and used a mushroom gravy mix.
My husband and I loved it..very easy.
Thank you.

This recipe was great!  I was looking for something to do with all the extra turkey I had from Thanksgiving, and this was PERFECT!  Not only was it easy and quick to make, but it was also very tasty.  Since it's only me and my husband, I made four mini pies instead of one pie and it still came out great. Even my husband loved them.  Tasted even better the next day for lunch!

This is a great idea, but the recipe is a little vague in explaining the execution, and I used only in the most loose way as a jumping off point. Per reading peoples reviews I decided to do three mini potpies and froze them before baking. I sauteed fresh carrots, celery, onions, mushrooms and garlic in olive oil with a little salt, pepper, oregano, basil and rosemary. I also added some canned peas after the veggies had began to soften.  I diced my leftover turkey and then added to pan with a little bit of leftover turkey gravy. I added the bottom pie shells to the 5" pot pie tins then ladled in gravy at the bottom, then the veggie/meat mix next till almost full, then topped off  with more gravy and then added the top layer of pie crust. The proportions of 2 cups veggies, two cups turkey and two cups gravy was the perfect amount for the three small pies. If you already have pre-made gravy you can totally ignore the part of the recipe about water and cornstarch. I used every last bit of my Thanksgiving leftovers and am thrilled not to have any waste. This will be the start of something I do every year.

I got rave reviews and here are the changes I made: Per another review I cooked my leftover turkey stock (2 cups) and added 2 packets of chicken gravy and then 1/2 c water and ~2 Tb cornstarch.  To that I added 2.5 c turkey, 2 c frozen peas n carrots, 1 chopped small onion, ~1/2 c portabella mushrooms and some fresh thyme.  I put this in the bottom pie crust and then added a little shredded parmesan cheese and pepper.  Yum!

I used turkey stock and thicken it up with cornstarch.  It was a little soupy.  Next time I will only use 1 cup of broth.  It was very good.

I love pot pies. I took all my leftovers, turkey, stuffing, gravy, broccoli casserole, greenbean casserole, mashed potatoes and anything else that sounds good to you and mixed it all together. If too dry, add cream of celery or chicken soup. You can make it as thick or soupy as you want by adding milk. Toss it all together and put in a pie shell and top with another pie crust, vent and bake til bubbly. Depending on how much leftovers you have this could make 2 or more pies...Delicious!!!!!

Looking to simplify the recipe even more, instead of the gravy/broth we used 1 can cream of chicken condensed soup. Prior to adding the top layer of crust we dashed the top with some poultry seasoning, and some fresh cracked pepper. We cooked half way with foil on top and remove for the last half. Nice, Flaky, golden brown crust every time.

Let me say we had to cut the kids off!!! It was a huge hit. Since then we now double the batches and freeze one.

I thought this was good, after tasting the recipe as is I did make some tweaks though which took it to the next level and had my hubby raving.  Starting with the sauce I added a pack of dry italian seasoning, and a can of golden mushroom soup.  To my plain old frozen vegetable bag(from the other reviews I let it drain in a colander during assembly to avoid soupiness) I cooked up 2 potatoes that I diced up and added to the veggie mix.  Cooking time was perfect and let me tell you, very tasty!!!  Even my toughest critic ate it all up.  We will definitely add this to the winter line up of comfort foods.

I have made this several times. I added the leftover potatoes also. Sweet and regular. Made it nice and creamy. The family loves it. The only other thing I do is bake the bottom crust for 15 min first then let it cool then add the filling and top crust. This way the bottom crust does not get soggy and it's cooked all the way thru! Good luck. Add the leftover cranberry sauce for a little surprise.

So simple, so easy.  I liked using leftover gravy vs. canned soup ... not that it's much healthier, just appreciate that it is home made.   I read the comments about runnyness ... so I just used 1 c. gravy, then 1/4 c. chicken broth, but only 1T cornstarch w/a little water to mix it in with.   We like our pies meaty: 2c. turkey w only 1c veg - comb carrots and peas (I steamed them before adding to mix)  I made the crust using this recipe:2 1/4 flour, 1t salt, 1/2 c oil, 6T cold milk.  Mix all at once - makes top and bottom crust.  Deep/reg dish pie.  I made a 'regular' pie - not deep dish.  Came out perfectly! Fam loved it! Not runny! - let it cool for 15 min before serving.

I'm giving this 4 stars for the directions or lack of in regards to the the chicken stock/water/cornstarch.  I'm an accomplished cook and had to read this recipe several times to figure it out.  Finally did it my way and then looked at the recipe and got an A HA! moment.  I wanted to use stock- I don't use processed food and didn't have any turkey gravy sitting around.  I needed 2 Cups of stock NOT 1/4 cup- either way I knew the 1/4 cup was not enough and added way more, but I'm not sure how much because I poured direct from the carton.  I then mixed the cornstarch with  a little chicken stock as the thickener.  Same result just got to it a different way.  I had left over broccoli and green beans so I threw those in along with some green onions.  I happened to have some pie crust in the house and this was an easy meal to throw together and it was tasty.  I did add salt and pepper to  the stock mixture.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was very good, it was a wonderful way to use up those left overs.  I always take any leftover veggies and put them in a freezer bag in the freezer and use them for soups, and now I have another use for them.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

So simple, yet very tasty and filling! I think the key to this is good gravy. If the gravy is awesome, your pot pie will be just as awesome. High altitude: set temp at 360 degrees and baked for 1 hr 10 min.

What makes or brakes this pie is the gravy. The better the gravy the better the pie. I have made this pot pie with leftovers every year I have been married I add onions and carrots last year and celery this year.

So yummy! I used two 14.5 oz cans of low sodium mixed veggies, drained. This created a less soupy pie.

GREAT way to use leftovers; I'd make this any day of the week, any time! :) My turkey was really well seasoned so I didn't add any more seasoning to the pot pie. Next time I'm going to add a little salt & pepper & chopped onion to give it REALLY well rounded flavor.  Store bought pie crusts and thickened stock worked  great!

The family loves this.  One time I substituted cooked diced potatoes and corn for the veggies just because that was the request from the family. I also made it with peas and carrots and corn also a hit.  Thank you for this effortless and tasty recipe.

Very yummy - I used canned chunk turkey (2 cans) and canned gravy (2 cans - which was maybe a little too much, I would use 1 and 1/2 cans).  Also added Italian seasoning and rosemary.  Used a 10 ounce bag of frozen mixed veggies.  Thanks!

This was an excellent recipe.  I only had one pie crust so I put stuff-n-such on the top.  It was a big hit.....they even went up for seconds!

Delicious! read the reviews, use the recipe as your starting point/guide and use what you have from your leftover meal and the gravy that went with it, and it is the best pot pie, and you're not wasting all those leftovers that everyone gets tired of picking on.  It takes on a whole new flavor and identity.  Truly glad I used this one and did this.  I will be doing this for thanksgivings to come, instead of my usual turkey noodle soup.  Don't forget to utilize any veggies u may have had left from the veggie tray too.  I blanched some small broccoli florets, used the carrots so even the veggie tray didn't get wasted.  I sauted carrot onion celery and garlic ( as another review suggested) used the gravy thinned down just a little bit with the juice left from the corn that I strained out.  Added 2 sm. diced red potatoes, used the green beans  and of course the turkey and this thing was just awesome.  Your seasoning is already there from using what you already seasoned and cooked from the prior meal ( maybe add a little S &P to taste) and this couldn't be any easier.  I wasn't ready to make homemade pie crust and thawed out 2 Marie Callender pie crusts from the pie pans they come in and rolled them out to fit my larger deep dish pie dish (the way they come are too shallow) and it worked perfectly.  Plenty of juice not a bit dry and stocked full of every goody from turkey day with a whole new identity and taste.  Definitely use this, make it your own, and ENJOY!!!!

This was very good!!  Made it a few days ago with leftover turkey I had in the freezer from Thanksgiving.  I had frozen the leg quarters and the wings.  Used that meat in it.  I used 1 can of veg-all and 1 can of green beans for the veggies.  I used 1 1/2 cans of chicken gravy because that is what I had on hand.  This was fantastic and versatile!!

I used chicken, since that is what I had leftover, and added fresh, not frozen veggies like carrots, and celery and red potatoes.Instead of water i did chicken broth as well.  Very Tasty!

Simple and delicious, my family loved it and it was so easy to throw together.  I had a lot of lunch meat turkey that I didn't want to go to waste so I cut that up in small pieces.  I read one review which said they used cream of chicken so I used one can of cream of chicken and on of cream of celery and mixed a bag of frozen peas and carrots together with the lunchmeat and we had a great meal.  Super easy and super yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.

My family loved this meal as it was very simple and satisfied that craving for a pot pie.  I used leftover frozen turkey cutlets, seasoned with Italian Seasoning, 1 package of turkey gravy and about 1/4-1/2 cup of chicken broth.  Turned out great.  Made twice already.

Didn't have turkey but had a lot of leftover pork roast and decided to try a pork pot pie.  Thickened the drippings I'd saved, added some green beans and onions and carrots and roasted garlic (basically cleaned out the fridge) and it turned out great.  Will make again.  Good basic eats.

I made this last night for supper. I didn't have a can of mixed vegies, but I did have potatoes, carrots, celery and pearl onions. So I cooked them first, and prepared the rest of the ingredients. It all came out very good. Definitely a keeper.

This was very easy to make my husband and I loved it its a great way to use up some of that leftover turkey and its very simple to put together anybody should be able to make this i didnt make enough gravy so i just added a little more water to it to make it an even 2 cups along with 1 and a half tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it up i also didnt use the bottom pie crust and i think it came out great since the bottom usually is mushy

This is my first time making this pie, and based on my "tastings" it is delicious.  I, too, used a deep dish pie plate, however, I changed it a bit.  I made a bechamel sauce, sauteeing chopped onion in 3T. butter, adding 2-3T flour, cooking it as a rue and then adding 2 c. milk.  It was thick as I expected it would be, so thinned it to a nice gravy consistency with turkey broth.  I thought a white sauce would be nicer than my dark gravy, and it saves the gravy for open-faced turkey sandwiches :)

I have been making this same Pot Pie for years and its always a hit when unexpected company comes. I usually end up making at least three as they freeze so well. I also make my pie crusts ahead of time so its ready to do the next day. No turkey ever gets wasted at this house. Only the bones go out after the soup is made.

I have been making a similar pie for years.  I make a pie crust or two, and have them ready to fill after the dinner.  I found that leftover dressing is best at the bottom of the pie, then green bean casserole, sweet potatoes, turkey gravy, some mashed potatoes, and then the crust. What an easy way to clean up, and we have a great dinner for later. Make one, freeze one!

I like this with the Grandma Ruth's crust on this site and leftover turkey. It is also good if you mix some leftover stock from another leftover turkey meal with a can of golden mushroom soup and cornstarch to thicken. I use the frozen mixed veggies with the diced carrots, peas, corn and green beans. i like to add leftover potatoes too.

I made this last night using some leftover turkery from Easter.  I added sauteed onions,garlic,sage & thyme to the gravy before pouring it over the turkey & veg.  I used only 1 can of gravy(all I had onhand)but added some stock to it.This was fast easy & delicious.  Husband & son ate it up.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I got rave reviews from this recipe. I used the gravy packet that came with my turkey, made it as the directions said then used 1 cup left over green beans and 1 cup left over kernal corn. I used two store bought pie shells in foil pan and two rolled frozen store shells fot tops. When I added extra chicken broth and cornstarch to make enough for both shells . cooked as directed and gave one pie to a friend.

I think the secret is having tasty gravy.  This was a fantastic way to get rid of the leftover turkey.  I plan to make this again tonight with leftover roast beef.  NOTE:  Saute the vegetables before assembling the pie if you prefer your vegetables to be on the soft side.  That will guarantee they are soft at the same time the crust looks good.

This is a great leftovers meal, and it is amazing how you can feed a family on such little amounts of any one thing - one diced potato, a handful of baby carrots diced, 1/2 cup of frozen green beans & corn... but when you add them to the leftover turkey (which I also diced), gravy (I used about 1 1/2 cups) and some salt, pepper, and a sprinkling of thyme -- dinner is served, baby!  It's not strong on spice so naturally is more mild tasting.  But it was good.  Everyone liked it and, as I said, it is a great way to use up the leftover meat.  I'll definitely do it again, and soon since I still have leftover turkey!

Bland. Maybe turkey stock would make this a little less glue-y but the flavor is less than stellar.

A simple, quick, and easy pot pie recipe.  However, I think the measurements for turkey in the recipe are far too large - I made 2 pies with the amount of turkey that was supposed to comprise 1!

This is a pretty good base recipe. I used 2 potatoes (diced), a small bag of peas and carrots, 1 cup of leftover gravy and then most of a jar of gravy, in addition to leftover turkey. I added some extra seasonings (onion, garlic, poultry seasoning). It smelled great and my family devoured it

Very good recipe!  I had extra turkey so I stretched the crust to line the bottom of a 9x13 pan & still had enough to cover the top adequately.  I also sauteed some onions & celery to go with the mixed vieggies for a little extra flavor & balance for the extra meat.  I did use extra gravy since I had a larger portion too.  I cooked an extra 15 min. also & it came out terrific!

I made this with my own changes. I had some bulk sausage I needed to use up so I used that. Instead of gravity, I used a can of cream of potato soup. It turned out really good and we will be making this again. This recipe is a good spring board to many variations. Thanks for sharing.

My family really enjoyed this. I made this as written but didn't use the optional corn starch or water, it wasn't needed. I baked the bottom crust for fifteen minutes and allowed it to cool before adding the filling and I thawed the frozen veggies, as per the reviews. IMHO the end result will be as good as the flavour of your gravy.  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy to make.  I only had one cup of gravy but had to get creative with cornstarch to make the extra cup.  I ruined one pie crust by not letting it warm up correctly but I had an extra box.  I got to use my new shredder on my kitchen aid mixer so the turkey was really shredded extra fine like crumbs. I am writting this while I am waiting for it to finish cooking.

LOVE how versatile this recipe is!  You can use it with left-over gravy or left-over broth and whatever vegetables you have on hand.  I made it using left-over roast beef.  I also had left-over mashed potatoes, so I put that on the top in place of crust.  I added about 4 Tablespoons of tomato paste to the gravy and sauteed some onions and garlic to go with mixed vegetables.  It is the perfect go to way to use left-overs-delish!

I made this pot pie last night.  I used cut up chicken, browned it in some olive oil with some Paula Deen's house seasoning. Then I cut it into small pieces. Followed the recipe the rest of the way and it was fabulous!!  This will definately be on my "make again" list.  My husband ate almost the whole thing!!!

Very simple and easy,  We used ramekins so we could have individual pies for lunches.  I didn't think was going to like the pillsbury pie crust over making my own... WRONG  very good.  Besides using carrots, peas and corn, I did an egg wash over the crust. Maybe that is why I liked the crust.  Just ate one of these for dinner, very filling and tasty.

I have never been so excited about a receipe!  This was a fabulous change from the standard "turkey soup" that I have always made with leftover turkey.  I used ALL the leftovers, and it was delicious!!  I brought it to work for everyone to try, and they all want the recipe.  Thanksgiving leftovers will never be the same again ... Thanks!

This is the best turkey pot pie we have ever tasted! The only thing I did different was add the last of our leftover stuffiing (about 1 cup)and an extra 1/2 cup of water.  Delicious!  I suggested sharingthe leftover pie with friends and my husband said "it's too good to share" - He loved it! thank you for sharing this great and simple recipe.

Really, you can put pretty much anything in this, and it will be good.  I put in most of my Tgiving leftovers: turkey, roasted root vegetables, chard, and even leftover stuffing (let's face it, that's where all the flavor REALLY is with the roast turkey).  The stuffing not only added a ton of flavor (it was the Creole cornbread stuffing from this site, with andouille sausage), but it created a wonderfully thick, hearty porridge-like filling for the pot pie.  I just used a basic pie crust recipe with half butter, half shortening for the flakiness and the buttery flavor.  Delicious!

I used frozen deep dish pie crusts, packet gravy, steam fresh veggie medley and added 3 cooked yukon gold potatoes as well as salt, pepper & fresh rosemary/sage.  Baked at 350 for about 60 minutes and then let sit for 10 minutes before slicing.  This was a quick and easy way to use up leftover turkey and I think it will taste even better tomorrow after the flavors have more of a chance to set.

I added carrots and potatoes which should have been pre-cooked before baking. Otherwise, it was very good. Girls at it all and husband went back for seconds.

I cut the potatoes too big and they were not quite done yet. I used 1/2 a can of corn that I had laying around and some frozen peas. I used the pie crust from Pilgrim Pumpking Pie and the leftovers from our Maple Roast Turkey and Gravy. Regardless of the potato incident (I'm still learning to cook), the rest was wonderful. I think it tasted a lot like those Marie Calendars pot pies. We will definitely be buying and roasting another turkey so that we can more pot pies.
