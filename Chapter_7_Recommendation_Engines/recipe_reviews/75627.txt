I happen to be one of the Harry's. This is my grandmother-in-laws recipe. My sister posted this recipe but there is a mistake in it. She tried to have it corrected but allrecipes has not done so. Here is the correction. After dissolving the gelatin over the double boiler add the egg mixture to the gelatin and cook until it starts to thicken and THEN set aside to cool.

Really good. I was more curious about this recipe than needing to make it but I served it with baked ham and it was positively delicious. Will definately keep it in my file and make it again.

My grandma always made a recipe like this for the holidays and I loved it. This recipe is different than hers uses more cream and more dried mustard. This recipe has more of a spicy kick and a creamier texture. It was still good but the kids wouldn't eat it because it was too hot.

Good recipe but I reduced the mustard to 3 tablespoons to make it less spicey.

see harry's comment egg mixture MUST be cooked to 160 degrees for safety NOT just poured into gelatin to sit so dissolve gelatin in double boiler with water low heat add mustard mixture remember if eggs get too hot they curdle then COOK to 160 cool before adding whipped cream or it will melt just basic food science
