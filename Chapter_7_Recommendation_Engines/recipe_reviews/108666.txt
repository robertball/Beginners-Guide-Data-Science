This was great!  Used "scoops" at first and switched to a spoon!  Had it with a blackened tuna steak for dinner and was back later for more on its own.  So fresh and different!

I added some sliced carambola (star fruit) and since the recipe didn't specify what kind of rum, I used Myers dark rum...  It was a big hit, especially served on top of a Spanish flan...
