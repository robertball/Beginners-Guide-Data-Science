I made this bread pudding exactly by the recipe with one exception, I used a dozen biscuits instead of the french bread.  I have several Aunts and Uncles who are diabetic and was looking for a new recipe that they could enjoy at a family dinner.  This caught my eye because my oldest Aunt had been talking about the great biscuit puddings that my grand mother used to make when they were all growing up.  While they all said that this was not quite like what Mom used to make they all enjoyed it very much and three of them had to have copies to make later at home.  This was my first experience cooking with Splenda but it was simply fantastic and I will be using it again, probably many times.   I will make this pudding again too.

I made this bread pudding and it was delcious.  I didn't make the whiskey sauce though.  It is good enough without a sauce.  I did add some cinnamon though, and only put in 1/4 cup of raisins to keep the sugar content lower.  I was glad to find a sugar free recipe because I have been trying to convert recipes and they always come out too dry.  Sometimes they go in the garbage, BUT not this one.

I made this dessert for a Mardi Gras dinner Monday night (with different dishes from New Orleans). My friend is 8 months pregnant and has gestational diabetes so I made this sugar-free dessert to accommodate her. IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD! I've never cooked sugar free; never used any aspartame products in cooking but you couldn't tell there wasn't sugar in it! And the whiskey sauce...WOW that really made it delectable. I put the individual servings (cubed and sauced) into Creme Brulee forms (these are little quiche pan-like cassarole forms) and put them under the broiler. Definitely a huge hit and easy to make.

I made this at Thanksgiving for my mother who is diabetic.  Well, it was everyones favorite.  I followed the instructions exactly except I used a 9X9 square baking dish and added about a cup of walnuts.  It was delicious, especially the whiskey sauce!  I plan to make this at Christmas as well.

Great way to heat sauce without curdling egg is to put in small pot or bowl & place that in bowl of nuked hot water.  Wanted sauce warm as says to serve pudding cold.  Came out great with sour dough on hand.  I would like slightly less sweet, but everyone else thought fabulous.  Added cinnamon & nutmeg to milk & wisked it till mixed in thoroughly before adding milk to bread.  Thanks Kathy!

This was great!  I modified this recipe to use some peaches from our tree last summer, and made a sauce using 1 cup of peach juice, 2T each of fat free half and half, fat free sweetened condensed milk, and Splenda, 1T of vanilla and cinnamon to taste.  Everything was very well received and didn't last long!

I took the advice of others and doctoredd it up a bit. I reduced the raisins to 1/4 cup, added 3 peeled,pitted and chopped plums. I mashed one ripe banana and added it. I doubled the vanilla and added 1 tsp of cinnamon. For the glaze, I replace the whiskey with lemon juice instead. The cooking time was increased an additional 20 minutes to reach the desired firmness. It was a hit with the family and we didn't have any leftovers either.

I substituted chopped pecans for the raisins (we don't like 'em) & this is by far the best bread pudding ever!  I take it to pot lucks & even those who say they don't care for bread pudding want the recipe....I think it's the whiskey sauce.

This got rave reviews by my guests and my husband.  Only one of my guests is a diabetic but I thought everyone would enjoy this recipe.  And I "thought" right!!  Be careful with how much whiskey you put in the sauce.  Most of my guests liked it but others said it was a touch heavy with whiskey taste.  That is, of course, a matter of personal preference.  But ALL the reviews for the bread pudding was the same...."excellent flavor/texture".  Super simple and fast to make also. Thank you for sharing.

I made this with low carb sliced bread. I didn't know how much to use, so I just mixed together everything but the bread and then added bread until it looked right. WOW! It was great and low carb! I've been on a low carb diet for 10 years for my diabetes, so I really missed bread pudding. What a treat!!

My husband LOVED this bread pudding, and since we're both on a diet, we were happy to have a scrumptious dessert to kill our sweet tooth. The only thing I would change is the sauce. A little less whiskey will do the trick, as you can definitely feel the 'whiskey burn' if made as instructed! Great recipe though - Thanks:)!!!

a family favorite at the holidays! I use 5 eggs instead of 3 and add 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. I use more raisins also, maybe 1 1/2 cup, and mix them in instead of keeping them on the top. bake for 60 minutes at 350 then turn the oven off, crack the door and let it cool inside the oven for a few hours. last time we made the sauce with southern comfort and everyone thought it turned out much better. more subtle.

this recipe was a favorite, and I recieved alot of good comments from the people that tried it at our Christmas party! I customized by putting the sauce on all of the pudding at once, then I put under a broiler for 5 minutes until it turned golden brown.

Outstanding!   I started a low sugar eating lifestyle a few months ago and wanted to add a good baking recipe for an occasional treat.  This fits the bill perfectly.  My wife does not like the texture of cooked raisins so i substituted chopped walnuts.  The texture from the nuts is just right.   You will enjoy this.

I would have rated this recipe at a 5-star, except that there is an apparent  typo. I believe that it should call for 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of 2 tablespoons. Two tablespoons of vanilla ruins the recipe.

I thought for sure there'd be a Splenda aftertaste, but there wasn't!  I followed the recipe, except that I didn't take time to make the sauce. I'll omit raisins next time (and I love raisins). Delicious!

The Bread Pudding was great, however, even after blending the sauce well (before adding the whiskey), the egg "curdled" while broiling.  Will make the bread pudding again with a different sauce.

Great sugar free bread pudding. I left out the raisins and added a handful of dried cranberries (Craisins) and some chopped pecans, I served it with a simple rum sauce from this site (replacing the sugar with Splenda.) I am diabetic and always looking for sugar free sweets. This is a keeper!

FABULOUS!, with my changes; added fresh peaches instead of raisens, and used peach liquour instead of whiskey.  I had to hide it from my husband or there wouldn't have been any left for me.

This turned out pretty good.  Though I think the sauce is a bit too sweet.  The pudding can stand alone without the sauce.

Everyone at Easter LOVED this even the ones who never eat things with splenda in it (I may have forgotten to tell them until after they ate it).
