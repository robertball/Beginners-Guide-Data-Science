I love wasabi!!!  This recipe was so easy to make and turned out fantastic, everyone was so impressed!  I toasted the sesame seeds and doubled the amount of wasabi.  I used 1/2 low fat cream cheese, and half regular.  The secret to shaping it into a perfect ball is chilling it for several hours before trying to shape it and roll it in the seeds.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I cut this in half....except would go ahead and use the whole can of shrimp with just one thing of cream cheese.  Anyway...to mold...I lined a small plastic bowl with saran wrap and put the mixture in that...stuck it back in the fridge for a couple of hours....then carefully pressed it into the sesame seeds.  It came out more like a "round" rather than a "ball".  Good though!...OK...I made this again for a dinner party and they loved it....I used low fat cream cheese (just one 8 oz package)...3/4 can of shrimp...3/4 can of chopped water chestnuts...and 1 +-teaspoon of this ready to use (and very potent) wasabi paste...let that stay in fridge overnight....then roll it in the toasted sesame seeds when you're reasy to serve....stays in a ball shape just fine.

FANTASTIC!!  The flavor is outstanding.  My only problem was shaping it into a ball.  I used regular cream cheese.  However, we will eat it with a spoon if we have to.  LOL!  Thanks Scout's box!  Makes wonderful spread on a sandwich too!

not the best cheese ball. i didn't make it into a ball shape, but rather left it in a bowl for spreading/dipping and it got watery. since i am only one person eating it, i had to toss a good bit of it after a while. if not making this for a group, i'd half the recipe.

This was very good, based on a few changes I made.  I added a lot of wasabi.  I also added minced ginger and garlic (about a tsp each).  Added a tablespoon or so of sesame oil.  There is no way this could be shaped into a ball - I just mixed the sesame seeds in and used as a dip.  Went extremely well with sesame sticks.

I tried this and it didn't turn out. I bought the canned shrimp (bumble bee brand) and it was more like flaked crab rather than tiny shrimp. Not sure if that had something to do with it or not. The flavor was to bland too. And the mixture to creamy.

This didn't really work for me. The wasabi completely overpowers the whole thing and you cannot taste the shrimp at all. I had also added some soy and ginger and they too were lost by the wasabi. I think it would be a good filling for a sushi roll, but on it's own it's too much wasabi flavor, too little everything else.

I crush wasabi peas and use that instead of sesame seeds.  I've also used crab instead of shrimp.  1 cream cheese also makes a nice size ball.
Always a big hit with wasabi lovers!

When I made this the first time, I realized later that I had bought LOW fat cream cheese and not FAT FREE. It rolled great that time, but not in later attempts. I think the amount of soy sauce and the moisture on the shrimps makes a big difference. Just as a note, I nuked it at a potluck recently and kept it in a small warming dish. Talk about eating it with a spoon. LOTS o WASABI is a gooooood thing.

Very good! I had no problem shaping it and I would definally add more wasabi if you would like it hot. I think it could benifit greatly from maybe a duck sauce drizzled on top or something to bring out flavors. But it was different and worth making again!

I wouldn't make this again, but if I did, I would use full sodium soy sauce.  I felt it would've been fine with the added salt.  I added a TBSP of reg. soy sauce and it made the mixture too wet to form into a ball (even after refrigerating overnight).  I ended up using it as a dip and sprinkled the toasted sesame seeds on top.  It was my mistake to add too much liquid but I still wasn't that impressed with the overall flavor.  The shrimp get completely lost.

I am not sure why, I followed the recipe, but this was not good at all.  I made it for my Bunco group and they all agreed that it was missing something.  I was very dissapointed based on the reviews and the recipe, I was expecting this to be very good.  I might try it once more with crab instead of shrimp.

We loved it with 1 1/2 TBSP of wasabi paste and next time I'll put the full 2 TBSP in.  But I didn't make it into a cheese ball.  Instead I add a smidgeon of milk to make it into dip.  We were dipping with pretzels and crackers. Yum!

I think I didn't have quite the right consistency, didn't roll well.  But was a great dip for crackers and veggies nonetheless :)
