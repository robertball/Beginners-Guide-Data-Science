This was really great tasting and easy to make.  I felt it was too much for one serving though, so I ate half one day and the rest the next.  You can easily feed two with this amount.  I used steel cut oats and added a teaspoon of chia seeds; otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make again and switch up some of the ingredients to use other fruits and nuts.

Iâ€™m trying to limit sweeteners right now, so I omitted the honey. The fruit was sweet enough. I prefer this recipe warmed up.
