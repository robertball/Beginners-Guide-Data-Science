This is a really good meal! It may need some chicken or possible itlian sausauge because it is a bit boring. I really enjoy the creamy part of it.

Ok...I was very skeptical about this sauce.  I mean its jarred sauce and evaporated milk. BUT, to my surprise, this is very good. I do not like jarred sauces (I always make my own spaghetti sauce) I used a good quality marinara sauce and started with the garlic in the pan first to cook it some.  Then added the sauce and the milk and simmered about 10 min.  I didn't even add any salt and pepper.  I topped some whole wheat thin spaghetti with the sauce and fresh grated parmesean...very, very good.  There is something about this combination that makes it taste so much better then you expect.
