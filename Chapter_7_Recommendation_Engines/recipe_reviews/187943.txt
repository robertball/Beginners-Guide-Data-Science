Fabulous chicken marinade!  I used this on boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 4) and I followed the recipe exactly.  I poked the chicken with fork, put every thing into a ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight (which I highly suggest). I grilled it with a fresh sprig of rosemary and WOW -it came out so moist, juicy and full of the delicate flavor from the fresh herbs.  It's a definite keeper.  I served this with a side dish of "Bow Tie Pasta with Broccoli, Garlic and Lemon" from this site.  Thanks for a great recipe, JustDMarine!

I didn't have white wine or fresh herbs on hand, so I modified it a little and it turned out amazing!  I used (for 6 servings):

1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil,
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice,
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar,
1 teaspoon dried basil,
1 teaspoon dried parsley,
1/8 teaspoon dried rosemary,
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme ,
3 cloves garlic minced,
1-1/2 teaspoons fresh-ground black pepper,
3/4 teaspoon salt.

I would use this marinade over a soy sauce marinade any day, and it's way healthier!

This recipe was great, but it's imparative that fresh herbs be used. I tried using dried basil, parsley and thyme, because all I had fresh was rosemary. The result was an overpowering flavor of rosemary. I suggest following the recipe. It's great as it's stated. PS I put the chicken/marinade in the freezer and just the thaw time allowed for perfect marinating time and the grilled chicken was quite juicy.

I had a dinner party and got two amazing comments regarding this marinade "That was the best chicken I've ever had" and "That was better than any chicken I've ever eaten in a restaurant".  Talk about rave reviews! It was the best chicken I've ever made.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinaded them for 24 hours, rotating the chicken in the bowl after 12 hours. The only change I made was to double the fresh parsley in place of the basil.

My chicken turned out moist, tender, and delicious. I was only able to marinate about two hours before grilling, but that was plenty of time. I'm sure it would have been even more flavorful if allowed to marinate the full 8 hours. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is really good!  I added a little honey and  left out the rosemary!  The chicken was very moist.  Thanks!

This is a great marinade.  I love it just the way it's written as well as with 2 tbsp's soy sauce and 1 tbsp brown sugar.  I usually use dry herbs because that's what I have on hand.  Wonderful!

I had high hopes for this as even though there were not many reviews, most of them were good.  I really wanted to love this, considering I had all the fresh herbs for this straight from my garden and stuck to the exact ingredients and marinated overnight.  Overwhelming taste of lemon, none of the vinegar and nothing to offset that taste.  I'll stick to my own garlic/herb marinade that uses all of the same herbs, but with white wine vinegar and honey from now on.  Thanks, but sorry, no go for my family.

I was looking for a new marinade for "beer can chicken," which is my favorite way to cook chicken.  Used dried herbs instead of fresh and reserved marinade for basting.  This was very easy, kid friendly, and good for a weekday meal.

Cooked per recipe verbatim and, to the point, fantastic meal. I look forward to making this marinade again. Cut it up after grilling and used in a salad. This is on my top 5 chicken marinades!

Not very impressive compared to others I have tried on this site.  I let the chicken marinate overnight as well.  Was just okay as an entree, but was better the next day used in sandwiches and salads.  Would never eat this alone as an entree in the future.

The chicken was very juicy, but was lacking in flavor.  I let sit in the marniade for 6 hours and used fresh lemon juice.  I was expecting much more flavor.

I had a similar chicken at the restaurant so I wanted to replicate.  I get the marinade exactly as directed. I put it on the test and bun With melted brie cheese. I topped it with arugula and I had saved a little bit of the Marinade for a few dribbles on the arugula and added toasted walnuts it was fabulous. Thank you for the great recipe

Used dried herbs because that is what I had on hand.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Marinated overnight and then grilled the chicken.  The whole family loved it, even my kids who can be picky eaters!!!  Thank you for the great recipe!!

I grilled it.  The entire family thought it was one of the best grilled chickens ever!  I was worried because the marinade itself does not taste good.  It's very bitter but the more the marinade sits with the chicken the more the tastes blend into something great!

Terrific marinade! After marinading my chicken legs, I reduced the marinade almost to a glaze, while the legs were cooking. When the legs were almost done, I drizzled the marinade over them and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes.

Very nice marinade for chicken, could very well use for pork also.  Ingredients were all on hand with the exception of some of the herbs. Had to use dried rosemary and thyme. Used boneless skinless breast.  I let it marinade for about 6 hours, grilled them on the bbq and it was delicious.  With the leftovers I'm going to have a very nice chicken salad for lunch!

This recipe did not come out great for me.  The vinegar was overpowering and the chicken tasted very bland even after marinating it for 24 hours. Maybe next time.

Not crazy bout this one.  It made the chicken to fruity/acidic tasting.  I cooked the chicken on a pan with olive oil.  My opinion, if you use this recipe, cook on a grill and not in the kithen!  The chicken was very juicy though, which was good!

easy to make and felt healthy with addition of ACV instead of soy sauce.  used dried herbs instead (1 tsp instead of 1 tb) and minced garlice (1 tsp). smelled awesome and tastes great.

My husband and daughter enjoyed this marinade with skinless, boneless grilled chicken breast. They didn't feel it was the best they'd ever had, though. Thanks!
