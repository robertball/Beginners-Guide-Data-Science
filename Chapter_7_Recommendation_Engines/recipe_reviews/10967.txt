These cookies were good. I added the vanilla as someone suggested. I would also add some nuts to the recipe next time.

I also, as other reviews suggested, added vanilla (about 2tsp) and think adding pecans would be great, next time. My sour cream was about to expire and searched for it in the ingredients. This recipe came up. I am so glad I did, family is glad, too.

This was a great recipe, although, as someone said before, it could use nuts next time! You could also use plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Very Well Done!

I took other reviewers advice, and added some vanilla to this. After making the first half of the batch, I added some mini chocolate chips (for I didn't have enough for the WHOLE batch). I like the idea of having a stir in for the cookies, nuts would be a great option too! It'a  a lovely cookie, kinda reminds me of vanilla wafers. Kids love them, Will make again!
(I also made with whole wheat flour, much healthier then the white!)
