I used tajin instead of chili powder.  I boiled the corn instead of grilling and I cut it off of the cob and served it from a bowl all mixed together.  It was delicious!  I definitely think grilling would have added another layer of flavor.  Possibly adding grilled pablano next time as well.

We used defrosted mini ears on skewers and grilled the corn until tender. Mixed melted butter and the ingredient seasonings and sprinkled the cheese on top.  Just like the local restaurant version.

This recipe turned out good and works for for times when grilling is out of the question but if you have access to a grill, I recommend doing it that way instead.
