Hi, 
I have not tried this recipe yet. Will do so soon! I am salivating just by reading your recipe.  
Thanks so much for posting this recipe. Have been trying for the longest time to locate a Semolina aka Sugee/Sugi cake that provides US baking measurements i.e. cups.
Cheers,
Roseange

This is a really good recipe. The cake is moist and not too sweet. I'm definitely going to make it again only next time I plan on adding poppy seeds to the batter and leaving the top with only almonds. Thanks for sharing.

Yes, Sugee Cake or Semolina Cake is my favorite cake! Buttery, gritty...
