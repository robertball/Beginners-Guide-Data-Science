Yummy, yummy, yummy! I thank you as well as your Mom for such a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. I used pecans rather than walnuts but the result was great. It is very pretty as well!

My husband loved it, I would reduce sugar and use sugarless marmalade next time, though.  Was a hit!

This was delicious!  I loved the flavor of the orange marmalade and the crunch of the walnuts.  Definitely better than plain cranberry sauce! And it was easy to make too.  I plan on making this again.

This had great texture and flavor, but was a little sweet for my taste.  I will definitely try it again, but maybe use 1/2 the sugar.  Used the leftovers over a brick of cream cheese and spread over crackers.

I thought this was really tasty. I think my family members are used to the "canned" taste and preferred the Ocean Spray jelly type. I however, thought it was really good. I like cranberries and nuts and liked the crunch from the nuts. It was a nice dish to serve for guests. I did rinse the cranberries and put them through a chopper prior to using.

This was tasty. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 c. The lemon was a little over powering. But by day 3 it had become milder. I'll cut the lemon in half  next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Made it for Thanksgiving and everybody liked it.  Didn't put lemon juice in and added a little crushed pineapple.  Need to use a deep dish.  Putting a cookie sheet under it will help keep your oven clean.

The orange was to powerful and was really sweet... Every year I try to find a cranberry dish to serve. And every year we all go back to the can.  Not going to give up I refuse. Lol.

Great recipe! I've been making it every year for Thanksgiving since I first tried it at the request of my family. It is easy to make along with easy to find ingredients. I think the amount of sugar needed may depend on how tart the cranberries are.

LOVE this very easy recipe......anytime, all the time!  I did, however, have to get my fresh cranberries out of the freezer at the grocery.......wrong season!  I used my homemade marmalade and grated frozen lemon.  Oh, & I did cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

I use this same recipe but brown the walnuts for about 12 minutes along side the cranberries in separate pan. Delicious !!
