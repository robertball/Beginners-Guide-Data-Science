Everybody loved it! I’m glad we tried.  After I finished I realized it didn’t go very far on portions.  I thought it needed corn tortillas or something but everyone said not to touch it! I used ground turkey and didn’t miss any flavor at all!

I halved the recipe but I should have used the original amount of peppers.  Mine were on the small side so I only got 2 layers instead of 3. The flavors in the dish were tasty. Everyone liked it. I served it with white rice, salsa, sour cream and guacamole.

I used an 8x11" (2 qt) casserole, could have gone down a size, so this is small -- 10 servings seems unrealistic, maybe 6 at most. Not a fan, but I made some changes so not going to ding it. I also used turkey, more garlic as recommended, but cut back to 2 cups of cheese. Chipotle seasoning was $6/bottle, no thanks, so I skipped that.

Excellent! All I have to say is more garlic and more cheese! Otherwise it was perfect!

Listed as the recipe of the day. Made it for family tonight and we all loved it. I consider it paleo and keto friendly. Very savory. My daughter loves tajin spice so I added just a pinch to tang up the beef mixture a bit. But not necessary it’s perfectly delicious as is. Next time I will buy more poblanos as 6 didn’t get me but 2 layers. Would do in a small casserole for 4-6.

My son wasn’t too impressed with the poblanos but that’s because he’s NUTS, this is delicious as written!  Even my somewhat picky hubs liked it!!

Very spicy and loaded with flavor. I have to agree with others that this is a smaller recipe than indicated.  You will want to use a small casserole dish if made as written.  I’ve made this recipe many times and use an 11 x 8 oval casserole dish.  It takes 9 or 10 large poblano peppers.  I also use 2lbs of ground beef and slightly heap the tablespoon/teaspoon when measuring.  I don’t measure the cheese, but can say with certainty that I use more than stated in the recipe.  I like to cook the ground beef first and drain off the fat. Then I proceed with adding the onions, seasonings, and tomatoes.  I will drain off all of the liquid again before layering in the casserole dish.  If you don’t,  you will end up with a watery casserole.  In my opinion, poblano peppers are the hardest to roast and peel.  I find it is easier to roast the peppers whole, then cut in half and remove the seeds.  Either way is messy.  It is worth the effort.

Awesome! I cheated & bought taco seasoning instead of adding all of the seasonings. I also added black beans to each layer. Delicious and will definitely make this again!

This took way longer than indicated to make, and turned out tasting kind of boring. Needed a lot more cheese and I wish I would have had tortillas to serve with it. Also was very runny. Tomatoes should definitely be drained before adding to the meat.
