This was delicious. Only change I made was to leave out the garlic-my husband doesn't like it.  I will make this again.

I rarely follow recipes exactly and this one looked like an easy way to use up all the assorted cheese in the fridge. I used russets run through the spiralizer. Probably double the cheese with a layer on top. Donâ€™t like nutmeg in food much so left it out. This turned out awesome. The leftovers were good too.

Made a hybrid Au Gratin / Scalloped Potatoes.

1 spoonful leftover, just to be kind.

It was easy to make, beautiful, but very bland.

Wonderful! I doubled the recipe, roughly, but only had Beechers cheese. Don't know how close that is to the cheeses called for, but it was delicious.
