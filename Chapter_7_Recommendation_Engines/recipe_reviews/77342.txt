Wow, I wasn't expecting something this good for so few ratings.  One thing I did different was melt 20 individually wrapped caramels, like I saw on another recipe on this site, into the condensed milk to give it a more true caramel taste.

I make these all of the time. They're fast, easy, and someone always asks for the recipe. A suggestion: Be sure to use unsalted butter, otherwise the crust is too salty.

I make these bars all of the time. People seem to really like them. If you do not like coconut, this is probably not the recipe for you.

We make the easier version of this every Christmas.  Skip the melting and the peanut butter and just sprinkle on the chocolate chips onto the coconut before baking.

Jessiker....when you put your crust mixture in the pan it helps to flatten the crust using a flat metal spatula.  Really flatten the hooey out of the crust before adding in the other ingredients.

These are ridiculously good. They were so easy to make but pack an amazing taste and look fancy. Eventually I had to take them to work to get them out of the house so I wouldn't eat them all!

I guess I can't leave well enough alone...
I started out making these exactly as written but just before pouring the chocolate over the top I though to myself..."self I bet some toasted almonds would taste real good under the chocolate" so I did what I commanded and chopped and toasted some almonds.
Now these are great but I am wondering if next time I should use almond butter.  Will be processing almonds next time. Maybe even some for the crust. 
By the way they are great with the almonds!

These worked out good for me. I needed more graham wafer crumbs and more chocolate for the top with the 13x9 inch pan! I lined my glass pan with parchment paper and it made it easy to take them out and cut them! I only gave them a 4 out of 5 because they are super sweet (but it kept me from eating a bunch...one is plenty!)

I did not make any changes to the recipe but I will next time. This was good but needs a couple of tweaks to be great. Next time I will double the graham cracker crust amount. There wasn't enough of it compared to the coconut and chocolate. I will also melt some caramels into the condensed milk and pour that over the coconut. I think it will add an extra flavor layer and I read other people say they did it with success. The top layer of chocolate is pretty thick and can over power the other layers so next time I may add more coconut as well to try to balance it better between the 3 layers. Was delicious as is, but I think these changes will send it over the top.

These bars were amazing.  I made them this past Chrtistmas and everyone loved them.  The only thing I might do differently next time is cut back some on the butter for the graham cracker bottom.   I found it it a bit greasy but they still were amazing!  Very tasty recipe.

I made this for Christmas and made extra for son to take to firehouse. After my family scarfed down one batch, I had to hide anotherbecause it would never have made it to the rest of the guys. One mroe thing, I don't tamp down with a spatula, but with the bottom of a measuring cup as I do with cheese cake and it goes fast. This is SO easy!!

This is a great recipe.  Made them exactly as recipe.  My husband said this is his new favorite.  Next time I will cut the chocolate chips to one cup and leave the peanut butter at 1/2 cup.  I did taste them like this and it has more peanut butter taste which my husband loves.

I made a half recipe in a 8x8 pan, using Nilla wafers instead of the graham cracker crumbs. I also added walnuts atop the coconut  These bars freeze well. I really love  this  bar!

I've never uttered these words before, but there was simply too much chocolate on top. Way too much.  Next time I'll reduce it by half. Otherwise this was really good.

It's very good but I should have sprayed the sides of the pan -the bars stuck all round the edges. I agree with others in that the cracker layer should be thicker, and I'd put less chocolate on top.  I also think I might try one person's idea of putting the chocolate chips on top before baking.
