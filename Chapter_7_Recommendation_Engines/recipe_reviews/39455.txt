WOW!!! This tuna steak was insanely good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I pan seared the tuna for 3 minutes on each side instead of grilling it.  I let the steaks marinade for 2 hours and then rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before cooking it. The fish came out awesome, so juicy and wonderfully tasty - I loved it (and I don't even like fish). I will make this again and again and again. Thanks Carin!

I consider myself a pretty proficient cook. I have created many of my own recipes and have often been told that I should have been a cook! But I have never tried tuna steak until now. This recipe is one of the best I've ever used. Anyone who says this tuna is dry is OVERCOOKING their steak, hello? Seared in a red hot frying pan for about 3-4 minutes on each side, this is succulent, indeed! I've never cooked tuna steak before, and it turned out perfectly...VERY juicy and extremely flavorful (but increase marinade time to at least 2 hours for the full effect!).

Five stars, no question. Flavorful, juicy, piquant. I quartered the recipe (just cooking for me), cooked it in a skillet and just dumped the whole mix in. I had to substitute teriyaki sauce (had no soya), which may have made it lighter than the original recipe; I enjoyed it this way. I also used dried herbs, found it okay. If I could make it differently I might crust some whole garlic slices right on to the tuna steak, but this is a bit of an unnecessary flourish. If your tuna comes out "tough and chewy" you are cooking it too long. Turn the heat up way high (skillet) or get the coals really going (grill) and sear it. Unless you buy bottom-quality tuna (which you should not), it is safe to cook until the top and bottom are seared but the center is still mostly pink and relatively uncooked. The bacteria grow on the exposed parts, which is why you have to cook the heck out of any ground meat (because the exposed parts have been moved all through the meat).

awesome! i followed the recipe - excpet for the following: replaced the soy sauce with Dales seasoning for meat and fish (its' soy based but as added flavor.) Also added chopped green onions (1/4 cup) and a 3/4 tsp rosemary. used fresh garlic (a must in my book!) 

i cooked the fish on a skillet. Turned the gas on high and let the pan heat up with a little bit of non-stick cooking spray on it. 

heres the best tip (got it from the man behind the fresh fish counter at Whole Foods) - turn the Tuna Steaks every 30 seconds for 3-5 minutes (depending on size of the steak)... perfectly cooked! DO NOT OVER COOK THESE. i had actually intially undercooked them (only 3 minutes). I wanted them to be cooked a little more, so i put them back in the frying pan and seared for 30 more seconds on each side.

yummy!!!!!!

I added honey to the marinade as other cooks recommended and it charred nicely on the grill. I marinated for 24 hours and I could really taste the marinade. I used low sodium soy sauce as other cooks warned it would be too salty and it turned out delicious.

My son caught a Blue Fin Tuna yesterday off Cape Cod. We had never cooked tuna before and gave this recipe a try. It was excellent and everyone like it. I did marinate it for about 2 hours. Much longer than called for. Other than that I did everything as it was written. Thanks, I'll be making this recipe again.

Love this recipe.  The second time I made it I added fresh ginger (I peel and freeze it then take it out and grate when needed), a little sesame oil and sesame seeds and it was soo delicious.
Greate recipe.

I did reduce the soy just a little (it wasn't loy sodium) and I didn't want a very salty taste.  I also added just a little honey and I am glad that I did.  I wanted just a little sweet in the background.  I had the dried herbs on hand so I used those.  It turned out really well.  I will definately be making this again.  Thanks for the post.

This was my first time cooking tuna steaks and even though I over-cooked it a little bit, I thought the flavor of this was excellent (I'm not a big fish eater) and my husband (who loves fish) agreed.  I made it on the Foreman grill and it was simple and fast.

This was the perfect solution for the not-quite-sushi-grade tuna I allowed to sit in the fridge for 2 days. Tuna is usually dry as a bone unless served rare, but the tuna I was using was in no condition to be served rare... without this marinade, that is! I didn't give 5 stars for 2 reasons (okay, 3 reasons, the first being that I'm extremely picky!!) Reason 2: A modification that is a MUST: I dipped the fish in italian breadcrumbs prior to pan-searing in lemon olive oil- the crust was the best part. And this allowed me to serve it rare-ish still. Next reason: I thought the following point needed clarifying: this marinade has acid in it, so it "cooks" the fish ceviche-style (a good thing-- helps to eliminate some of the fishy factor.) A word of caution, though: never, ever your fish to sit in an acid-containing marinade for over 30 minutes (some say 20!) Doing so will "overcook" it (the acid, doing the ceviche thing, that is.)

This came out PHENOMENAL!!!  I did not have access to a grill, so I just pan seared it (in a little butter) a few minutes (about 4) on each side and then put it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 6 minutes and it came out great!  Very flavorful!  Husband loved it!  I'll definitely be making this again!!!

This is the most luscious marinade you can imagine! I add a bit of honey as some have suggested, and we prefer basil to the parsley and oregano. I love our tuna steaks cooked outside on the webber until medium rare. While they rest a few minutes I strain the marinade and reduce it just a bit, then we drizzle just a little over the steaks before we eat them!

Gave this 4 stars because of the cooking time. Like all fish you have to be careful with overcooking, tuna included. It becomes dry and unpleasent. Tuna should be nice and pink on the inside, not like the canned stuff. I sear it shut on both sides, nice and brown and then take it off of the grill and wrap it in foil and allow it to rest, the result is a nice melt in your mouth piece of fish.

The marinade is excellent(!), however, there are two misguided directions in this recipe.  First, there is acid (orange juice) in this marinade and you should never marinate fish longer than 30 minutes in any marinade containing acid.  The acid denatures ("cooks") the fish like one does with ceviche.  Second, I would never grill a 4 ounce tuna steak on high for 10 to 11 minutes as the recipe suggests unless you really like your tuna dried out.

if you grow your own herbs, you are in for an easy and delicious treat.  the 30 minute marinade is worth the wait while everything you need is in the fridge.  fish is too easy to overcook so watch it closely.  and don't forget to boil the remaining marinade to pour over the tuna when served.

This is excellent marinade - and is even better with teaspoon of chopped raw ginger. Give it some zip! Do not over-cook blue-fin or yellow-fin tuna. I am sushi fan - so I usually sear a 1 1/4 inch steak for 60-70 seconds on each side on pretty high heat. Melts in your mouth! Cook over 2 min per side - it tastes like saw-dust...

I don't like tuna from a can and had never had fresh tuna before. I was scared I wouldn't like it so I searched for a recipe that I thought would make the tuna at least edible to me. Wow, am I glad that I found this recipe! Followed it pretty closely except I subbed fresh ginger for the oregano as I didn't have any. Marinated it all day and not only was it delicious, I can't wait to eat tuna again! First time in my life that I've eaten tuna! Thanks for the great recipe.

pretty good marinade. I added 2 tbl fresh ginger, one tbl honey and a dash of red pepper flakes.  I let it sit for 3 hours.  I think 4 or 5mins is far too long, one to 2 mins each side is plenty.

Just a note, if you use sushi grade and like it rare, just cook for 1 Min each side on a hot cast iron skillet.

The key to enjoying this recipe is cooking the fish properly once it is marinated.  It needs to be cooked as you would a rare/med rare steak.  Overcooking makes the fish dry and tough.  The center needs to be pink.  We really enjoyed this marinate and will use it again on many dishes.  Thank you Carin for sharing.  The marinate is excellent.

Fabulous! Light, flakey, and rich taste. I added a little honey to the marinade, as suggested, and marinaded for 3 hours. Then poured the marinade off into a small sauce pan and simmered it down into a thicker, rich sauce that I drizzled over the seared tuna. I seared the tuna in a very hot skillet lightly sprayed with olive oil and took it off the flame to finished cooking. Really delicious and we'll be having it again and again.  Thank you.

Absolutely 5 stars!  My husband decided on a steak when he heard I was grilling tuna.  Once it was finished, he was very interested...it smelled wonderful.  Tasted fabulous.  He loved it too.  Used Sashimi grade tuna & served medium. This is one to wow your guests with!

This recipe is a new house staple. It's got great flavor and I've served it with a light/sweeter salad as well as egg fried rice. I marinated it a bit longer than the recipe called for on accident once and it didn't disappoint, in fact, I'll probably do it again.

I seared my tuna in toasted sesame oil. Wonderful way to make a tuna steak. Easy and delicious.

Tasty, but it seemed very salty even though I used low-salt soy sauce. Is that typical with tuna steak? We usually eat salmon, but wanted to try something different. Guess I'll try it again with another marinade recipe so I can figure out if it's this type of fish or this particular recipe....

All I can say is "WOW!".  There is only 1 restaurant I've ever had outstanding tuna steak at and I'm thinking this recipe meets, if not beats, theirs.  I let my tuna marinade for about 7 hours and it was so flavorful and tender, I could not stop eating it.  Thanks for such a great recipe!
Update:  I used this marindade on 2 rib eye steaks and chicken breast and it was fantastic!

Having never cooked tuna before with the exception of canned, I was able to cook this to perfection, I may have overdid the lemon just a hair but overall this was really good.  I did have a steak that was close to 3 pounds so I worried it would overcook, I wish I had marinated more than the 3 hours I gave it but it still had a nice taste to it, I'll do it again for sure.

The fish turned out great!!!  I marinated it for about an hour and it was a nice blend of tasting the marinade and the natural flavor of the tuna.

Great recipe!  The tuna stays juicy, with just enough tang to keep even my picky husband interested.

I've used this multiple times (as often as once a week in some cases) and will continue to use it again.  Thanks so much!

ETA: One good, fast way to cook this fish is to throw it on a hot George Foreman grill for 5-6 minutes.

I marinated this overnight as some other reviewers suggested and even though I used low sodium soy sauce, it was so salty as to be practically inedible.  I give it four stars because the flavor of the marinade was nice and maybe it would be OK if marinated for a shorter time as the recipe indicates.

Very tasty.  While I love fish and seafood, I am new to eating tuna that doesn't come from a can (this was my 3rd time).  This was delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Will be making this again.

Followed the advice of others and added approximately 1 tbs grated ginger and a few tbs honey. Also added one minced jalapeño. Marinaded two very large and thick steaks about six hours then grilled for four minutes one side and five the other. FANTASTIC! Husband LOVED it! Covered the remaining marinade with plastic wrap and microwaved for three minutes and poured over the steaks just before serving. Great recipe!

Delish...I am now a tuna steak fan!  I followed the marinade recipe except for substituting dried oregano for fresh.  After marinating for 1 1/2 hours, I pan fried the steak in my cast-iron skillet.  3 minutes on each side in a bit of olive oil was PERFECT and gave the steaks little crust.  This is definitely a keeper...thanks, Linkyj!

Just excellent. I marinaded the tuna for 30-45 minutes and then grill seared it on a very hot gas grill. It took about 3 minutes on each side and it was seared on the outside and nice and red in the middle. I served it with fresh asparagus and grilled Ciabatta Bread. Great dinner.  My favorite way to make fresh tuna.

Loved this recipe! We just got back from Myrtle Beach and I had eaten Tuna Steak there for the first time and loved it when we got home I was trying to find a recipe and came across this one, I had everything needed for the marinade so I thought I would give it a try. OMG I am so glad I did this was even better than what I had eaten at the restaurant. Very quick and easy I followed the recipe to the T and was so moist and flavorful I  will definitely be making this again and again!

I love tuna, but I've never had anything I made at home that I thought was GREAT.  This was!  Even my daughter who hates fish ate some.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was 1) I substituted about 2 Tbsp teriyaki sauce for soy sauce, only because I was all out of soy sauce (so don't count that) and 2) I marinated for about 1.5 hours based on other reviews.  Grilled for just 2:10 sec per side (I know, that's awfully precise, but you have to be with tuna or it gets overcooked and dry) and it was perfect.

Great!  I took the advise of other commenters and marinated for at least 2 hours.  So delicious.  Everyone raved about how this tuna turned out.  Like others have mentioned, if it comes out dry, it's been over cooked. We went with medium/medium rare.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

WOW!!!!  This was great!  I don't usually eat fish but my husband loves it.  NOW I love tuna steak thanks to this recipe. Only thing I did was add 1 tblsp of Basil to it and let marinade for about 9 hours.  Thanks for such a wonderful addition to our recipe collection!

This was AMAZING!!!!   So easy and sooo delicious.  It looked really nice too, I definitely want to make this for company sometime!!    I made a few changes based on what I had, but nothing that different...used sesame ginger marinade instead of soy, canola oil instead of olive, left out the parsley and did more oregano, marinated for about 40 min, and cooked 5 min on each side on the grill.  So good!!!  Served with green beans in soy sauce and sliced almonds and it was perfect.

I am so impressed with this recipe! I followed exactly as directed other than letting it marinate for 1hour and just searing the edges.  I bought sushi grade tuna so it came out cool pink and moist in the middle and crusty on the edges. I will try with a little fresh ginger next time as suggested. This is a definate KEEPER!

We loved it.  I marinated the tuna about 90 minutes, but wouldn't go more than an hour.  Even with low sodium soy sauce it was a little salty.  I cooked the tuna indoors for 5 minutes on each side on a hot grill pan for a medium (light pink) center.  I also followed the suggestion of another and simmered the marinade to thicken.  It made a nice sauce for rice.

This is the best marinate recipe!  It is one of our favorite dinners now.  My husband fishes a lot so we are always trying different recipes - this one is perfect and we get compliments everytime!  Thank you for sharing.

THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT I DID CHANGE IT ALITTLE. I ONLY USED HALF THE OLIVE OIL AND SUBSTITUTED THE OTHER HALF WITH SESAME OIL. I ALSO USED 5 CLOVES OF GARLIC SINCE WE LIKE GARLIC. THANKS AGIAN

I cannot stress enough how awesome this recipe came out!  My very picky husband (who really only enjoys peanut butter sandwiches and pizza) gobbled this down and loved it!  It was very easy to make and this is definitely a keeper.  I used dried oregano instead of fresh, and it still came out great.  I used one large tuna steak for the two of us instead of two individual-sized steaks.  I marinated it for an hour and a half, turning it once.  I cooked it on high heat on the grill for 6 minutes the first side and 6 mintues the second side.  It came out with a warm pink center. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Amazing!  Moist and prercect!   I think I'll try this same marinade with other meats because it smelled so good.

This was very easy, and the best marinade I have ever tried for fish. The tuna steaks we did on the grill with this marinade were just divine.

this was a pleasant change from the usual blackening spices that my mom uses on tuna.  the flavor was nice and mild and complemented the tuna nicely.  i will definately keep this around to be used again.

This is an excellent marinade for tuna.  I am going to try it on other fish as well.  Only change I made was to cook it in a skillet in a bit of olive oil. Around 3 minutes a side made it done with a nice pink center. I drizzled fresh lemon on the top. The second time I made it, I used fresh dill instead of oregan, which also was excellent. I 
 love it that the ingredients are common in most kitchens.

This was absolutely amazing!  Usually just sear my tuna with the usual sesame seed oil, garlic, etc., but this recipe may be our new favourite.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Perfect!!!  Followed the marinade recipe exactly.  Hubby pan fried first side in butter for three minutes in a ceramic pan, then the other side for four.  Transferred to really hot grill for 45 secs each side for grill marks.  This will be our "go to" recipe!  Thank you, LINKYJ!!

Very good and very easy!  My family tries to eat as much fish as we could but the same old stuff gets boring.  This was a great recipe to introduce my young daughters to tuna steaks!  Did it without parsley and turned out perfect.

I usually don't eat tuna (and I don't know why!) and my boyfriend came home with a tuna steak, so naturally I went to my favorite recipe website, allrecipes.com, and found this one.  This marinade is very similar to the one I use for salmon so I thought I would give it a try.  We followed the directions almost to the spot with the exception of adding a little honey like some people suggested, and also I had a 1 pound tuna steak rather than portions.  We cooked it on the grill for about 7-8 min on each side and it was FABULOUS!!!  Perfectly pink in the middle and the flavor was amazing.  I am so happy I tried this recipe because tuna will now be in the weekly dinner rotation.

Too salty, adjust accordingly. I switched to Ponzu and found it far more complimentary. My main issue is the recommended grilling heat. Preheating ''the grill for high heat" and grilling for 5-6 minutes, results in very over done tuna... Considering how delicious this fish is simply seared, adjust time/heat accordingly.

Loved it! Did like another user said, only took leftover marinade and reduced it down and spooned over steaks at the table. My hubby was over the moon with this.
Just made it again for the second time and the best part was that I had leftover tuna and sauce. Made a stir-fry with it (bok choy, broccoli, bean sprouts, mushrooms, onion, etc). Best stir-fry I've ever done!

I finally broke down on Father's Day and bought tuna steaks to grill outside. The only change I made was to use pineapple juice instead of orange juice as that was all I had in the fridge. This marinade is the BOMB. I have 8 people in my family that I cook far and everyone of them absolutely loved it! It was tangy and savory all at the same time. I will definitely be using this marinade for tuna and other fish in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

We grilled over direct hot coals until seared about 3 1/2-4 minutes each side. For those that said it was fishy, you had old fish, tuna shouldn't be fishy tasting. Be careful not to overcook or they'll be dry. I would suggest using fresh lemon juice and add in some zest, for extra flavor.

I used this marinade for swordfish steaks, and it was fantastic.  Only change was dried herbs for fresh.  Am trying it again tonight, with fresh herbs, for swordfish again.  Looking forward to it!  Thanks for a great recipe, it's a new favorite.

YUM!  These are full of flavor and after being grilled on a charcoal grill they tasted like steak.  I poured the remaining marinade in a sauce pan and boiled it.  I served it on the fish which made it even better.

AMAZING!!  Easy to follow recipe.  Turned out better than I could have imagined!!  Didn't have fresh oregano, so used half the amount in dried.  Only grilled 3 minutes on each side to avoid over cooking as some warned.  I had used frozen tuna steaks and defrosted them that evening.  I felt that the center of the steak was a little cool for me, so I will probably marinate at room temp next time.  A not so interested in fish friend of mine ate with me, and LOVED IT!!  A must try recipe!!!

I was VERY skeptical of grilling tuna.  I have changed my mine.  I have made this three times now, and it is better each time.  Nothing fancy, just follow the recipe And, OIL the grill.

Very good marinade for tuna!  I ended up letting them marinate for a day and a half.  Cooked on the stove on high for 3 min each side to sear, then finished in oven for about 6 minutes.  I was aiming for medium rare, but got medium well.  They were still delicious!

Wow! I am everyone's favorite person tonight. Pan seared in grill pan for about 3 min per side. One or two I cooked longer and they were already getting dry. My son who doesn't eat a lot ate 3 large steaks! Cooked with Orange Cilantro rice per another review and it was the perfect side! Marinated for 1.5 hours and it was plenty of flavor.

excellent dish! I added about a 1 T of honey to the marinade. I marinated for 4 hours, then I seared the Tuna. The tuna was moist, juicy and very tasty. I made this with the orange cilantro rice from this website. I will make this again.

First time tuna steak eater and won't be last. I marinated the tuna all day and pan-seared three minutes each side. I love it! Thank you for this awesome recipe...

I have a ton of tuna in my freezer, compliments of a fishing trip, so thought this might be a good way to try it.  I mixed the marinade reached for the thawed tuna and discovered I had thawed the salmon by mistake.  So, FYI,  it tastes great on salmon as well.  Thanks for the recipe.

Mixed in 2 tablespoons of pineapple juice and served fresh pineapple slices on top.  Cooked medium rare and wife thought it was fantastic!  Has a great crisp flavor that everyone will enjoy (and I love).  Would definitely make this again.

OMG!  My husband is a big fisherman and I've cooked tuna more times than I can remember - but this was DELICIOUS!  I used tangerine juice and lemon pepper (no lemons, no orange juice) and I left out the garlic because I didn't have any.  My steaks were thick - a little over an inch but this was juicy and moist - I'll never do tuna any other way!

This was delicious- I particularly liked it bc the marinade ingredients are all things that I always have on hand. This was good enough for guests- we will definitely make this again.

This was okay. It gave the tuna flavor, but it was kind of a salty, heavy flavor. I will cut the soy sauce in half next time, maybe that would help??

Awesome marinade!  Had frozen albacore tuna and even though I overcooked it on the grill it still tasted great. Only changes were I added a chopped jalapeno, tablespoon of molasses and diced green onion instead of dill. Served with a corn and black bean salsa. Yum!

Wow!! I cooked this indoors on a grill pan, about 5 minutes per side, and it turned out FANTASTIC! It was still pink in the middle, but done enough. I omitted the parsley because I didn't have any, and I substituted dried oregano for fresh (same amount). I marinated for 1 1/2 hours and served with corn on the cob and "Garlic Broccoli" from this site.

This always turns out great!  We like it pretty raw and only grill it enough to brown the outside but the marinade is the best ever!!  Add a little Wasabi and you have a great tasting Sashimi Tuna!

Just made this and it was excellent.  It didn't over power the tuna at all but complimented it nicely.  My family eats a lot of fish and they really loved it.  I didn't have any fresh herbs, so had to substitute dried instead.  It still came out delicious.

Good.  We didn't think it was great, but we followed s few suggestions (adding a little honey to the marinade) and had to use dry parsley and oregano since that was all I had on hand.  Maybe if I had followed it exactly we would have had better results.  Probably won't make again though.

Fantastic!  I'm looking for a recipe to serve dinner to 50 and will be able to do these ahead and serve at room temperature.  The tuna remains very moist if you stick to 3 minutes on each side, and slices nicely to arrange on a platter.  I recommend keeping a bit of fresh marinade for basting while cooking.  Thanks for the perfect tuna recipe!

This recipe is FANTASTIC.  I followed the recipe verbatim the first time and it was amazing.  The second time I increased the garlic to 3 cloves and marinated the steaks for nearly 24 hours.  It was a masterpiece.   Easily the BEST tuna steak I've ever had, hands down.  You will think you are dining at a 5 star restaurant - no lie.

Wow, I've made this several times and my bf who isn't a big fan of seafood and really isn't a big fan of any fish that is darker in color because of the stronger taste, he absolutely loves this. I changed nothing, (I did use simply orange for the OJ because that is what we use normally so there was no added sugar from that) let sit for a while and then cooked to medium rare with some thinly sliced onion for some sweetness. I did use sashimi grade tuna a few times and didn't cook it at all it was amazing. A definite must try!!

Turned out very good. I did not have any orange juice so used pineapple juice and I coated the steaks with italian breadcrumbs then pan fried with a little olive oil.

Made this with the Mango Corn Salsa on this site. It was delish! Seared on a pan for 6 minutes per side, flipping every 2 minutes. I cooked my husband's and kids' pieces until done all the way through. They all loved it- which is a HUGE deal at our dinner table! Will make this again and again!

This was light and delicious.  I made it exactly as recipe suggested. I've never cooked fish on a grill~I was leary of the short cooking time, but used a thermometer for testing for doneness.  This was easy and I'll definitely make it again! Thanks, LinkyJ!

This is an excellent marinade and is so good that tuna steak has become a part of our weekly rotation of meals.  Instead of grilling, I threw the tuna steaks on a skillet and flipped them every 30 seconds for about a total of 4 minutes.  Extremely easy and tasty!

I really love fish and the reviews were great on this, but it just didn't have a very good flavor. I know part of this may be the difference in preferences, but I even adjusted it and it still wasn't great. I added quite a bit of red pepper flakes, which did help, but maybe it needs some cayanne pepper. Just something to make it pop.

very good!  This was our first time to make tuna steaks.  The marinade was excellent, although I didn't have the fresh parsley and oregano on hand.  It was still very tasty though.  Next time I will plan ahead and buy the herbs ahead of time (or grow them.)  I always prefer to use fresh herbs.  Keep in mind the tuna steaks should be a little pink in the middle.  I was a little paranoid about this, but they will dry out fast if you don't leave them a little pink.  I cooked mine about 6 min on each side.  Perfect!

Don't forget to let the tuna steaks "rest" for 5 minutes or so, just like you would regular beef steaks.  Otherwise, all the juices flow out and don't stay in!  

I prefer these steaks with a salsa or some kind of cool sauce.  I made a Habanero Creme Sauce for some fish tacos the other day and used the sauce on the steaks.  Mmm!  Very good!

My husband made this recipe for a big family get together and everyone loved it. The fresh herbs play a huge roll in this, so do not use dry herbs. I will use this marinade again and I think I will try it on other things too... like chicken. YUM

Not a fan of tuna steaks...until this marinade.  Absolutely FANTASTIC!

Once it came off of the grill, I garnished it with some chopped mango and place on the top of the tuna steaks.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dry (only half of the amount called for). 

Next time I will also use a little ginger and fresh herbs but this is a recipe my family and I make for a long time.

Wonderful marinade! I make tuna often and will use this marinade over and over. My teenage son and my husband agreed that this recipe is a winner! The only thing I did different was to use dried oregeno because I didn't have fresh. I used Ahi tuna and look forward to using Hawaian Sushi grade next time.

Taste is great, but it needs to marinate for much, much longer to get the full effect.

I didn't like this at all. That said, though, I think our tuna was probably not very high quality.  The marinade was wonderful and I'll probably try it with chicken.  

Don't let my low rating deter you from making this!  Just buy good fish.  :)

I made this for my husband's birthday and he love Love LOVED it! I added a little bit of extra garlic to this one and made sure there was plenty of OJ in the marinade. Also, watch the tuna carefully; the less it's cooked, the better it tastes!

This is the best tuna marinade I've tried! Every time I prepare tuna steak it seems to come out tasting similar to the albacore you buy in a can. This, however, is delicious. I marinaded 4 hours and although I didn't have any fresh herbs on hand it came out great anyway. I did add a little extra garlic and OJ. The tuna was moist and juicy and extremely flavorful. My husband raved over it! Thanks for a really great recipe!

It seems like other reviewers have been unneccesarily hard on this recipe.  The biggest problem with the recipe is the marination time.  YOU HAVE TO MARINATE FOR MORE THAN 30 MINUTES!  I recommend overnight, but atleast 3 or 4 hours is a must.  When you marinate that long it makes the tuna so juicy and tender!  It was the moistest tuna steak I had ever had, even at a restaurant.  Also be sure not to overcook the tuna, as it will dry it out.  I served it with fetucine covered in spinach cream sauce, and it made a great meal.

I see a lot more tuna in my future!! 
I never marinated tuna prior to seeing this recipe. The marinade was quick and easy to put together.  The only change that I made to the recipe is that I added 2 tsp of grated fresh ginger and eliminated the oregano.  I marinated the 1" thick tuna in a zip-lock bag for 30 minutes and cooked them in a pre-heated cast iron skillet  for 5 minutes per side. (I skipped the basting)
The flavor of the marinade was very mild and did not overwhelm the tuna at all.  The tuna was just cooked through and very tender and delicious.  
I prepared it slightly reheated the next day and the flavor was even better.
This IS the best tuna steak that I've ever made!

Excellent, quick, and restaurant quality results.   Marinate tuna steaks at least an hour if you have the time.  I stove topped grilled the tuna for 3 min. a side for a perfect medium rare.  For a great topping see the recipe for Alaska Salmon Bake with Pecan Crunch Coating on this site.  The addition of this topping  takes the recipe to the next level.  I did boil the marinate as suggested in the video and it was great drizzled on top for an excellent  finish. Served on a pre-cooked packet of Uncle Ben's Long grain and wild rice made this super simple.

Followed recipe except cooked on a skillet, and marinated the steaks for 6 hours.  Following the advice of another I did baste the steaks when I flipped them over. They cooked to a "just right" pink center at 4 minutes per side on high.  The results were tasty but ended up the salty side. Would cut down to a shorter marinade time (as per original recipe) and perhaps less soy sauce in the marinade

Followed the recipe but marinated for about 2 hours and seared it for 5 minutes each side in a very hot cast iron pan.. Next time I may try pineapple juice and some pineapple salsa on the side.. Can't wait!

I had never cooked Tuna before and accidentally bought tuna steaks from Costco, which meant I needed to figure it out lol.  I found this recipe and my fiancee loves it and now wants these steaks at least once a week.  It is super simple and I followed one of the suggestions to pour the marinade in a very hot skillet and turn the steaks once every 3o seconds for 5 minutes.  The marinade actually reduces pretty quickly and leaves the tuna with a great flavor.  I love it and we are hooked!!

Delicious. I pan fried my marinated tuna steaks on high to sear them and seal in the juices and it worked wonderfully. The slightly charred edges were the most delicious part.

I've done this now several times and it has been lovely every time. I follow the recipe exactly most of the time, sometimes I vary the herbs. I even cook the tuna so that it is done and not rose in the middle, which I know is not ideal, but my husband doesn't want it "raw". And the fish is still lovely and moist and succulent. Full of flavour and not dry at all.

Absolutely top notch. I have made this a few times now! I've substituted sherry vinegar when I didn't have a lemon, I imagine any acid would work. I've also subbed other fresh herbs from my garden, chives and thyme also work. The key is the oj and the soy. I cook it in a skillet, and after, while the steaks are resting, I simmer the marinade along with a tsp of cornstarch and serve along side with rice.

Fabulous flavor! I followed the recipe to a T, and my 8yo gobbled it up! I only had one tuna steak, so I froze the extra marinade. It was also great for chicken. If your tuna comes out dry, YOU OVERCOOKED IT.

Amazing! It tastes a lot like chicken. It's the perfect seafood dish for someone who doesn't like seafood!

I loved this.  Minor changes: had no parsley, so I used equal parts Marjoram and Basil. Actually used all dried spices and jared minced garlic.  Had no orange juice, so I substituted pineapple juice. Also, no grill was used.  I preheated my cast iron to high heat and cooked each side for three minutes exactly.  Moist and full of flavor.  Served with couscous/dash of truffle oil. My tuna came as individually sealed and frozen from Costco. Thawed them out for a day before.  Marinated at room temperature for 40 minutes.

Great recipe. I changed just a few things. I doubled the marinade recipe and was glad I did. I saved half for the stove top. I substituted the juice of 3 limes in place of the lemon and I added one small raw jalapeno seeded and sliced into quarters. Very nice and the marinade went great over cooked rice. The jalapeno gave a nice late kick of heat to the tuna. Keeper recipe.

The marinade was delicious! We gave our tuna steak a sear rather than cooking through the way the recipe suggests.  We then sliced thin and served over baby greens with orange segments, crunchy lo mein noodles, and soy-sesame dressing.

I doubt this recipe needs yet another rave review, but it really is just so good. Perfect for a weekday dinner! Truly fast and delicious. My toddler loved it, too.
I made it as written, aside from cheating a little less soy sauce and doubling the garlic to my taste.
I served it with grilled asparagus (just buttered and added lemon/black pepper to them before grilling) and steamed brown rice. Thank you for this recipe, it's a keeper!

Excellent marinade!! Made this for Christmas Eve for 22 people, everyone was raving about it,  Took a few suggestions from other reviews and added honey and fresh ginger root, also used orange infused EVOO.  Used the marinade with fresh swordfish and and let marinade for 4 to 5 hours, it was tender and flavorful-- will definitely make this again.

Wow..I came across this recipe, never made Tuna steaks before but was asked to.. I myself not a huge Tuna fan. 
I read over the reviews & used low sodium soy sauce with fear it would be too salty as many stated &  Garlic cloves actually used 5. Well  I doubled everything but the oregano in marinade due  to a few more Steaks to cook. BUT I let the marinade itself sit over night in fridge   I tasted in morning I thought to myself way to spicy.  I have to admit i was bit afraid to continue.  When it came to adding Tuna Steaks Marinaded for total 2 hours.  I did grill but I used Cedar wood planks where you soak -immerse planks in cold water for 2 hours , then when soaked place steaks on planks ,poured alittle marinade over them, heat grill high then turned down to approx 375 degrees & cooked 15 to 20 minutes (key is not to keep opening grill lid)  You don't turn the steaks & I was SHOCKED how good this was, I finished off by heating remaining marinade on stove (to boil) then poured over Tuna, the taste of  marinade changed completely it was so so good -I will definitely make again & again.  I'm rating 5 even though I made slight changes cause w/o this recipe I would have never attempted to try Tuna & I'll continue so as long as I use this recipe.  1 note for those who try this method take off grill 15 minutes if you like a pinkish middle/ test with fork you'll be able to tell if still too raw for your liking.  It was DEFINITELY NOT dried out.   Loved it, Thank you!!   I definitel

Excellent marinade recipe. I accidentally added a bit too much oregano but it didn't seem to effect it at all. The grilling time noted was a bit too long for the steaks we used. It really should depend upon the thickness of the steaks you're grilling, so we adjusted accordingly.

Made this the other night and it was better than I had hoped. We had everything on hand as called for except the fresh oregano so we substituted with 1/4 tsp. of dried. Marinated for about 35 minutes. Simple to make and so quick . Grilled on high for 5 minutes on each side and that was it. When I cut into it I was concerned it was overcooked as there was no pink at all but it was surprisingly moist and delicious. This recipe will be used again and might work with other steaks such as salmon and swordfish. Give it a try, you'll agree.

Our neighbor caught a ton  of Ahi and gave us several steaks. This recipe was perfect! I didn't have lemon juice but it still came out great. I used dried herbs (that's what I had) and squeezed an orange for the juice. My husband loved it too.

I've had my mom's tuna steak all my life and she's a chef, but this recipe blew hers out of the water! We marinated for 1.5 hours and only cooked it for 3-4 minutes each side on a red-hot skillet. It came out juicy and slightly pink on the inside, which is what we were going for. The texture on the inside reminded me of a tuna tartar or an ahi tuna dish and was wonderful!

This was the first time I made tuna steaks. I usually order them in restaurants, but it's only because I did not know it was so easy to make at home! I did not read the other reviews before making the steaks, but had only low sodium soy sauce on hand, so that's what I used, did not have fresh herbs, so used dry, and pan seared the tuna. It turned out amazing. The steaks were really thick, so it took a bit longer to cook them, but they were not chewy, dry, salty, or anything. Just perfect. I think the quality of fish is what really matters at the end. Even my super picky son ate it, although he said he did not like it, but he did eat a lot. (And he did not eat ice cream until he was 4, so it is a real compliment that he ate something new for dinner without complaints.) I have bookmarked this for future use. Thank you for this recipe!

This was marinade was perfect the tuna steaks I had! I'm sure it will go well with other fish too. I'm even trying it with chicken tonight :)

We loved this recipe.  It's easy to make and the ingredients all common to our kitchen.  Used the recipe as it is written and will be serving it to our guests soon.

Delicious! My kids even liked this and they are very picky eaters. It has a beautiful hearty taste. The only thing I will do differently next time is grill the tuna steaks for 2-3 minutes per side. It seemed a bit dry because it may have been cooked too long on my grill. We have a 6 burner Weber, and it is rather powerful, so you may need to make your adjustments based on the power of what you are cooking on.
Other than that it was an AWESOME tasting tuna steak!

One of the 1st reviews I've done. My first tuna steak was dryer than I would like but that was due to user error. 2nd time I grilled for no more than 10 min. Perfection. Wanted a little pink in the center. Was just as good as benihanas. I sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds

Fantastic recipe, though the cooking time is way too long.  I cooked this on the George Foreman grill, and I would recommend cooking it initially for about 3 mins, basting, and cooking for about 1 to 2 mins more to make sure the sauces are sizzled into the fish.  

Otherwise, fantastic recipe!  Really gives the fish a nice zesty flavor.

This is just an awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing it! Grilled the steaks for 3 1/2 mins flipping over every 30 secs, as recommended by another reviewer - came out juicy, soft and yummy! And the flavor - is to die for!

This was great!!!!! My hubby loved this! I used the George Foreman Grill which worked out great! I marinated the tuna for 50 min and the flavor was great, I can only imagine what the flavor would be like if I had let it sit for longer:)

A-ma-zing!!!  I squeezed in half a lime, a few swirls of honey and some Ginger.  However, these were in small enough amounts that I could tell even without them it would have been wonderful. My two-year-old and 8-year-old had seconds! Of non-fried fish! Seconds!! It was simply Incredible.

First time cooking Tuna Steaks... never dreamed they tasted so much like steak. Pan fried on highest heat and flipped every 30 secs for 3 mins like one commenter said. Worked like a charm. I was nervous when I cut into the first one and it was deep pink but it was warm and someone told me that was when it was perfectly cooked. Still nervous I bit in to a wonderful surprise! Also cut back on Soy sauce but possibly still too salty. Only marinated for 45 min but still lots of flavor. Thanks for the recipe! Will cook again :)

This was pretty good.  I had to use apple juice instead of orange b/c that's all I had.  I used 1/2 the amount of oil- olive instead of veg.  I marinaded about 8 hours.  Will make again with proper ing. and may update my review then.  I think the orange makes a big difference.  6/15- made again with fresh squeezed orange juice and it was really good!  I will use this again.

this was delicious!!!!  i only left them to marinate for a little over a half hour and they were so tasty.  next time i would like to leave them for at least 1 1/2 - 2 hours.  i cooked them not even a total of 6 minutes total, they were super tender inside and nicely done on the outside.

Wonderful taste.  I tried this as a first time fish effort and it turned out perfect.  I do not use the oregano as I am not a fan of it but kept everything else the same.

We are lovers of very rare tuna and have been on a quest for "perfection".  I prepared this marinade with wheat-free tamari instead of soy sauce and doubled the recipe, marinating for 1 1/2 hour and grilling for only two minutes per side.  Everyone loved the flavor and I will definitely make it again.

This was really good with a slight sweetness and sourness but I think it would have been even better with fresh tuna. Served with white rice,  Grilled Artichokes, Idaho Fry Sauce for the artichokes, and Cherry Cobbler I.

This was tasty, but I felt it needed a little more of a kick. I made two batches since we were having people over, one of them exactly as the recipe says and the other I made some changes. Here's what I did: 
Added ginger, can of pineapples (juice and fruit), and substituted olive oil for sesame oil. This second batch was a huge success! The first was well received but personally I prefered it with my adjustments.

Fabulous and so easy to make.  My husband asked if we could make it a weekly menu item and my 4 year old daughter ate hers all up.  I cut the oil in half and it was still delicious!

Excellent.  I marinated the steaks for about 4 hours, simply because I had the time, and used 1 tbs. of dried parsley instead of fresh because that is what I had available.  Great flavor, will definitly repeat.

Made this tonight on the charcoal grill. I marinated for 1.5 hours. It was fabulous. The mixture of the citrus fruits with the soy and garlic was a great change of pace for us. Highly reccomend this dish!

Still one of my all-time favourite ways to prepare tuna steaks. Comes out fantastic with the recipe (I use a bit less olive oil and *more garlic* and marinate for at least 3 hours - preferably overnight). Prepared steaks present well on a bed of rice or mejadara (as in my uploaded photos). Enjoy!

Only marinated for 45 minutes but the flavors still came through. It would be amazing if it soaked overnight. I cook with natural hardwood charcoal so four minutes on one side & three on the other cooked this a perfect rare. Which is ideal with sushi grade tuna.

We needed a recipe we could make either on the grill or inside (depending on the weather) and this sounded great.  We ended up sauteeing this in a cast iron pan and it was delicious.  I tripled the recipe (for about 4lbs of tuna), used a few dashes dried, not fresh, oregano.  I cannot wait to make this again, it was so tasty!

OMG this marinade is so simple and absolutely delicious!! My husband had a friend over who's never had tuna before and he LOVED it! I made enough to marinade some shrimp I was grilling with the tuna and they turned out the most amazing perfect flavor! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I never cooked Tuna at home but when we went on a fishing trip and caught a large Tuna I had to figure out some creative ways to cook it.  I found this recipe and I ended up using it two nights in a row.  My husband has never liked Tuna and after having it prepared this way he wouldn't let me cook it any other way.  Even my picky 10 year old loved it!  I followed another recommendation I read and added some ginger, yum.  This is definitely a do over.

best tuna recipe and easy to prepare. I used chopped garlic from a jar instead of garlic clove. Perfect. Try a little Irish pete mixed with your charcoal for extra flavor.

This was freakin DELICIOUS! I have never cooked tuna steak and this blew my mind.  I used what I had on hand, which just happened to be bottled herbs-no fresh. Will make again and soon!!!

Delicious marinade. Despite the warnings I overcooked it. Oops. Warning: Do not overcook the fish! Even overcooked (and thus, chewy) the falvor from this marinade is great.

This was wonderful! It was easy to prepare and uses ingredients that most people have in their refrigertor/pantry without having to go to the store. It did not over power the flavor of the tuna. I marinated the tuna steaks for about 45 minutes and cooked them on our George Foreman grill. I will definitely make this again!

After reading reviews about the tuna needing a boost I added a few good shakes of cayenne and a large pinch of crushed red pepper, yet in the end, the tuna was still lacking something. I marinated well over the minimum 30 mins - about 8 hours. I used lower sodium soy sauce and the fish either needed to be sweeter or saltier. I'll keep looking for a great tuna recipe. 3 mins on each side was perfect though for the frozen ahi tuna filets I got from Costco.

I just finished eating this dish and I had to rush to the computer to let everyone know that this is great recipe. The only thing I did different was add lime juice, Dales,and I didn't have any orange juice so i substituted it with a tbsp more lemon juice. I cooked it in a dutch skillet turning it every 30 seconds and kept the heat up high. Also I let it marinate for 3 or 4 hours.

Great Recipe! I used a plastic storage bag for marinading, this of course keeps the marinade surrounding the Tune Steaks.  Also, I used a Weber Charcoal Grill (Real Grilling) at 400 degF.  I recommend 3 mins then flip for 3 mins.  The original recipe is WAY TOO LONG for my taste.  The marinade is awesome, I also marinaded for a little over an hour, I like a very seasoned taste.  I'll make this again in a couple of weeks!

My husband is still talking about this a day after I've made it.  He says it's his favorite grill recipe yet.  The only thing I would do different next time is let the steaks marinate longer, even all day, in the refrigerator.

I would have to agree with everyone else that this recipe is absolutely delicious.  Only thing I did differently was I am not one who keeps fresh herbs around, so I did use dried Oregano and Parsley.  It was still very very good!  Next time I will use a little less soy sauce because it was a little salty (for me).

I bought Tuna Medallions which were on sale.  Made these for out of town guests who are still raving.  Easy and impressive meal.  I used the recipe exactly and cooked on the grill.  Juicy & flavorful.

Out of curiosity one night we decided to try tuna steaks but didn't have a recipe. So I popped on here and found this recipe and let me tell you, we NEVER make our tuna any other way!!  The flavor is amazing & the tuna comes out so moist and delicious! We either have the tuna with a side salad or a grilled ear of corn.. so so good!!  I've even passed the recipe on to other friends and they love it as well. What's great is we can change it up to our liking. I throw a little fresh or powdered ginger in the marinade & some black & plain sesame seeds, they stick to the tuna while cooking on the grill and get slightly toasted.. yummers!!  Great recipe, highly recommended!!

Wonderful recipe followed it exactly.  I marinated two steaks for 48 hours, a little too long the flavor overwhelmed the tuna. I think next time I would only do it for 24 hours max.  But the flavor was wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent! I made this as directed, and used low sodium soy.  Next time I'll add fresh grated ginger and 1-2 T honey.  I pan seared 1-2 min. per side (used cast iron skillet for even heating)

This recipe is a keeper.  I read the other reviews and was worried that the tuna wouldn't have any taste, so . . .I actually made/used marinade for 4 tuna steaks but only used/only had 2 tuna steaks.    Also, I made the marinade early and the tuna sat in the marinade for about 2 hours, maybe it helped the flavor, b/c they were good and, I'm not particularly easy to please.   Other than that, I had to go with dried oregano but used fresh parsely, fresh lemon juice . . .  Way too cold to grill this time of year -- I seared the tuna [sprinkling just a tiny bit of kosher salt on one side] and then put them in the broiler for a couple minutes on each side as well -- I need my fish a "little" more cooked.  They were very tender and juicy.  I would definitely make this recipe again.  Very simple and very good.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a great recipe. Tuna is one of my favorite foods. I actually didn't have any parsley or lemons on hand so I made it without it, and it was still Delicious! After it was cooked, I sliced the tuna and served it on a green salad with a light honey orange balsamic vinaigrette with walnuts.Great!

Great recipe!  I let my tuna marinate for about 10 hours (DH way late from work) and the flavor was excellent.  I grilled mine about 3 1/2 minutes per side as others had suggested, but I think my steaks were too thin as they were overcooked.  Thanks.

This was excellent.... I lightly seared the steaks in butter leaving a beautiful pink center in a black iron skillet.... they were perfect.  Served with roasted asperagus and a side spinach salad with thinly sliced pears and toasted walnuts drizzled with balsamic vinegar.... my 15 year old LOVED the meal!

This was awesome! I had given up on tuna steak because I was tired of the usual spices and/or blackened varieties.  This definitely changed my tune!!  I really enjoyed it and ate a LOT more tuna than I have in the past.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great marinate! I marinated them over night so they would be full of flavor, I just can't bring myself to eat raw tuna, so i seared them on each side and left them in the pan on low for 10 min. until they were cooked through and still they were moist!

OMG! This is a wonderful recipe!  I didn't have any oregano, but substituted with Italian seasoning and pan seared.  I served it as a tuna burger and the kids and husband loved it and requested to take it for lunch the next day.

Loved this recipe.  My husband said it was better than a steak.  I boiled the remaining marinade and drizzled it over the tuna after plating it.

I thought this recipe was exceptional.  I didn't have any OJ so I used Sunny Delight instead.  The fish absorbed all of the marinade in about 1 hour in the fridge.  I used the George Foreman Grill also, but you have to watch not to overcook it.  Just a few minutes is all you need.  THANKS for a great recipe, I'll be making this one again, and again.

I let this marinated overnight and it tasted great. Next time I'll let it god for two days or I'll inject it. Great flavor, my husband suggested adding a little honey or pure maple syrup to it to see what that would do but its a great flavor by its self as well!

I followed the recipe (only I had to use dried herbs) and cooked the steaks the exact time the recipe called for....bottom line it was absolutely fantastic.  Definitely a keeper.  If you are a novice at cooking Tuna Steaks please do NOT overcook.  If your complaint is the tuna is dry - you have overcooked it.  Can't wait to try this one again!

Yummy!  I added a splash of pineapple juice (because I had a can opened) and some green onions (had them on hand as well).  Marinated it a couple hours.  Seared it quickly on the George Foreman.  My bf who LOVES seared tuna thought it was great!  We will be making this again!

Tangy, juicy. Best when served w/ a Basic Rice Pilaf. Oh so good, marinate for 4 to 6 hours for best results.

We loved it! I ran out of lemon juice so I used lime juice in its place. Also added 1T of Hoisin Sauce. Marinated for about 2 hours and grilled for 5 min. on each side, basting a few times during cooking. Definately a keeper!!

Outstanding!  had about 45 min. or so to marinate three large tuna steaks.  I gently pierced them with a heavy duty meat tenderizer and put the marinade and steaks in a baking pan.  I didn't have the fresh herbs so I used them in dried form, but the rest i had and also used double the garlic ;-)  Husband grilled his and my son's to rare and mine to med. to med. rare and we all agreed that these were the best tuna steaks any of us had eaten to date.  The combination of flavors went with each other so perfectly, it was as if you couldn't get enough of it, i wished I could eat it plain!  I'm thinking I'm going to try this out on steak!  You really can't go wrong with this one, the taste is just fabulous.  I will be making this marinade again for sure and probably soon on any kind of meat I make next!

Super easy and delicious.  I know you are suppose to eat tuna rare but I can't get past seeing the raw tuna so, I grilled mine longer and it was tender and fabulous.  The whole family loved it and we will make this again.

I only had 15 minutes to marinade the tuna, and it still turned out perfect. Made the recipe as is, but poured a little extra marinade over the tuna in the grill pan to make a sauce (since I was short on marinade time, I thought this would add flavor). It was very very good! Perfect with quinoa and a veggie.

This very delicious marinade works great even on pan-fried fish. Don't be afraid to let your tuna be pink in the middle.

The marinade to this was very good.  However, I would recommend buying frozen tuna steaks as I bought them fresh and could not get the fishy smell off my grill for a couple days, even with the help of some lemon juice.

This was unbelievably delicious! I marinated the tuna for about 2 hours and it turned out to be so moist. I've never eaten grilled tuna that was so moist. The flavor of the marinade was perfect. We just had it two nights ago and my fiance wants to know when we can have it again!

A little too salty.  If I try it again, I will use a smaller quantity of low-sodium soy sauce.

I DO NOT like seafood. But my husband does and so I thought I would treat him to a special dinner made just for him. The only thing is, that I ended up eating just as much as he did. This is the first seafood dish I have ever liked. In fact, I am making it again tonight. I served the steaks with mango lime salsa. Delicious!! Thanks so much for the great recipe.

This was the best tuna I have made yet!  I was in a hurry and only marinated it for 20 minutes, but it was still delicious. I can only imagine how good it will be next time.

The best marinade i've ever had for tuna steaks so far.I was unable to get fresh parsley and oregano so I used freeze dried and the taste was fantastic the tuna steaks were moist and bursting with flavor.

Wouldn't change a thing about the marinade, it's very tasty.  Served this to some friends, who in turn used the marinade on swordfish and loved that, too!

I'm not a big tuna fan, so I rely on my husband's judgment on this; it does make a tasty fish, and he really likes it.  I always grill extra and use the rest to make tuna salad sandwiches for him the next day (tuna, fat free mayo, fresh parsley, lemon juice, pepper).

This is my first time ever cooking Tuna steaks (usually I settle for the stuff in the can)and I must say it was better then I expected.  I went with other reviewer's suggestions to marinate longer and let it marinate overnight. It was moist and oh so good...   Thanks so much for Carin the great recipe!

Wonderful! I made the recipe as written with the addition of a little more lemon juice and 1tsp orange zest, marinated for about an hour and a half. The marinade itself doesn't seem like much, but the tuna really takes to it well. Don't overcook your tuna and it will be moist and equisite!

Very blah!  I took the suggestion to use less soy sauce so it wsan't salty and used 2 TBSP.  There was no flavor to this marinade.  If I had used the full amount of soy sauce it would have tasted like salty soy sauce and nothing else.

I've made this twice now. My 3 children loved it and asked for seconds - that' s very unusual!  I marinated it  a  longer than 30 min - the marinade smelled so good!  We're the process of moving, and don't have a BBQ grill now, so cooked it on a George Forman grill -- so FAST and EASY!!!  Seved with Jasmine Rice and a vegetable stir fry .

Super easy to make and Very tasty.  My husband thought that it was a wee to salty so I guess I'll cut back (a little) on the soy sauce.

I made this tuna tonight for my whole family - kids included - and it was DELICIOUS!!!! I followed the recipe exactly - it was wonderful! The marinade was fantastic - the tuna steaks smelled wonderful grilling - and tasted even better than they smelled! My youngest, who is 7 and NOT a fish eater - even ate it! I would definitely make this one again!

First time Tuna eater here.   LOVED this recipe!  I've heard Tuna can be very dry.  This was very simple and inexpensive to make.   It was very tasty and melted in our mouths like a good 'steak' should.  Thanks.

This is an excellent marinade for tuna. I grilled the tuna rare and all four of us agreed this could be the best tuna marinade ever. I highly recommned this recipe and only gave it 4 stars because I still have many recipes to try in my lifetime and I could find a better one out there.

Yummy!  I let them sit in the marinade overnight, fried them in a skillet with olive oil 5 minutes each side.  Will come back to this recipe if I buy this type of fish again!

I love this recipe and make it all the time. Also introduced my 19yr old cousin to it and she said it’s he new favorite food and makes it all the time for herself. I use Braggs liquid amino acids instead of soy sauce and it’s amazing!

I found that 5 minutes on each side was too well done. I prefer my tuna on the rare side. The marinade is very tasty.

Easy and excellent. Had to pan sear because I had no grill, came out great on medium high for 3-4minutes on each side then down to low, flipping/brushing every minute and 1/2.  Overcooked means dry so be vigilant! Since the tuna starts out red, a common mistake is to cook out the red. It just needs to stop being translucent to be done.

AMAZING!! Following the recipe as far as ingredients are concerned but doubled all ingredients and marinated for 8 hours. Realize the fresh lemon juice will cook the tuna but that’s okay, I prefer them well done. I cook on the stove in a skillet on high for 8-10 minutes flipping every 30 seconds, they were PERFECT, juicy and flavorful. Sautéed onions and mushroom then used the left over marinade and made gravy by adding a bit of flour to thicken - the family LOVED it all.

I bought some tuna and started looking for a recipe. I've never tried fresh tuna and was in hopes of liking it.  I found this recipe and the ingredients sounded good, and the reviews were good so I gave it a try.  This was so delicious. I followed the ingredients exactly, but didn't want to hand it over to my husband to cook on the grill, so I did as some of the other reviewers did and pan seared it for 3 minutes each side. (I also left it in the marinade for 2 hours) It was perfectly cooked and the taste couldn't have been any better.  I would give this more stars if I could. My husband couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

YUUUUUUMMMM! this was truly delicious. My sister gave me an albacore tuna loin from her fishing charter and this recipe did it some justice! Everyone was raving about it. I cut it into steaks. I didnt have OJ so I used pineapple juice and let it marinate on the counter for 30 minutes. I also added a little squeege of honey and smoked it on the traeger in a grill basket for about 10 mins. It kept the fish very moist even the smaller pieces that got well done. Can't wait to try it on other kinds of fish.

The ingredients for the marinade sound wonderful but I didn't have access to all of them so decided to use an Asian Salsa Agridulce instead.  It was very good.  Will make it again and if I have the ingredients will use the ones listed in the recipe.  Was a hit at our house!!

I love tuna and will often eat it raw with soy sauce, as long as it looks fresh and I trust the monger, so as long as it wasn't overpowering sounded good. I thought it was very good and I was able to keep the center rare so nice way tp prepare tuna. My wife tried and liked it as well. She is a huge salmon fan and she was up for trying it with her salmon portion. Now that was a big hit and I have already had to do it again for her. Could be her new favorite.

This is a really yummy marinade.  I've made it twice now.  The first time was fantastic!  The second time I was going to be getting home late so I thought I'd put it in the marinade the night before.  It completely obliterated the mild tuna flavor.  So be careful not to leave it in the marinade too long.

We over cooked it. 6 minutes on one side is too long. But it was a great flavor. I added some coconut sugar to the marinade to sweeten it up. That was a good call.

This is wonderful! We also used the marinade on salmon.  Grilled the tuna 5 minutes,  salmon a little longer. So moist and wonderful flavor

Every time Fresh Market has their sale on sashimi grrade tuna (2 per pkg-7 oz) I stock up. My wife and I love this recipe . No changes except we like it pan seared on our non-stick All Clad.  Have used our gas grill but prefer the pan. Marinade for 2 hours. Yum!

Best tuna recipe we've tried from this website. I did marinate around 4 hrs.  I didn't have fresh oregano or parsley so used dried equivalent to fresh. Hubby forgot to baste though when grilling per directions & it was still very good.  Very easy since you just put all ingredients together & that is it until you grill.

I followed this recipe and have made this several times and it’s always delicious and a hit! Would suggest a thick tuna steak if it’s too thin the tuna will over cook.

So I followed the recipe... really disappointed in the cooking time-  after I flipped the steaks, I knew it would be over cooked.  So watch your time!! Other than that, the flavor is nice- but so bummed as Tina should be seared on the outside and beautiful pink/red on inside... this didn’t have any pink... and after I flipped it I only cooked for 3 more mins.  I had to get a sear otherwise I wouldn’t have even done that.

The BEST marinade for BBQing any seafood. We first followed this just for tuna. Amazing! Tastes just like citrusy steak. Next we added salmon and shrimp- fantastic! Our GO TO seafood sauce.

My fillets weren’t as thick as the video . The marinade was yum. I think I overlooked them, tho. Keep that in mind when on the grill. If thin filets, no need to grill even 5 minutes on each side.

This was AMAZING!! I marinated 2 tuna steaks and 2 swordfish steaks using this recipe and spooned it over the top of each when I served them. FANTASTIC!!! Cant wait to see what else it goes with! PS. I used the juice of 1 fresh orange instead of bottled OJ

Great Recipe. The tuna seemed pretty undercooked after the recommended time, but that could also be a preference/thickness of steaks. Recommend using a low sodium soy sauce to bring sodium down.

This came out perfectly! I used dried oregano and parsley and they worked out well. I let the tuna steaks marinate for about 2&1/2 hours. I love the marinade so much I’m using it for other meats. Thank you!

I’m not a big fan of tuna but this was outstanding. It was like eating a steak. The salsa had just a hint of heat with the chili. Don’t skip the step of grilling the onion and pineapple. It  added a extra depth of flavor to the salsa.

Oh my word! This was BY FAR the best tuna I have ever made. I completely messed up trying to make 2.5 times the amount of marinade needed because I had A LOT of tuna to cook (my husband and daughter went deep sea fishing). I wound up with so much and I cut up the tuna into chucks, threw it into a giant bowl and marinated it all in the fridge for 4 hours. We grilled it in a contraption made especially for fish, served it with a salad with a salad dressed with the Best Lemon Vinaigrette (recipe on All Recipes) and WOW! What a meal!

My first time grilling tuna and this recipe helped me through it. Tuna was cooked perfectly and the flavor was great.  Roasted asparagus and jasmine rice made the meal complete.

I made this like the recipe, except I used dried herbs, it's all I had. I've just recently started an herb garden and I look forward to making this again with fresh herbs from my back yard. My husband loved it too.

We love tuna and I was excited for this recipe. The mixture of citrus and soy seemed like a perfect combination. Unfortunately, I will not be eating this again. Even with low sodium soy sauce, this was WAY too salty and had just too much going on. I marinated the tune steaks for 4 hours and would not go that long again. We ended up giving the leftovers to the dog.. all of us ate a few bites and had to fill up on the rest of the meal instead of the tuna.

I used as a base recipe. I changed it and we all LOVED it. I didn't use oregano, just didn't seem right.  Living in Hawaii, I had an orange from my tree and local caught, sashimi grade yellowfin tuna. I used lilikoi (passionfruit) juice (from my vines) instead of lemon, but think lime would be great. I added freshly grated gingerroot and a splash toasted sesame oil, only 1 tsp dried parsley.  Happened to have good low sodium tamari (hubby bought) on hand, so used that instead of cheap soy sauce.  Marinaded 3 hours, and was SO good, we mostly ate it raw as sashimi/sushi!  But, a couple guests didn't like raw fish, so I sauteed up the cut up tuna WITH the extra marinade. We all LOVED that as well.

This was pretty good. I found the orange juice to be an overpowering flavor. I followed the tips given in the comments marinated it for two hours and then pan seared it for 3 min per side. Then I reduced the remaining marinade down into a sauce.

I'm not sure the overpowering juice wasn't my own fault. I only keep low sodium soy sauce, so I used it without thinking. I'm eager to try this recipe again. Next time I will be sure to use regular soy sauce instead. Maybe that will balance things out.

Except for the lemon juice (didn't have any) I made this as shown.  Very good!  Also marinated some peeled jumbo shrimp in the same marinade and grilled along with the tuna, served over rice with some grilled veges.

Super quick & easy - made it GF by using coconut aminos instead of soy. I also pan seared instead of grill. Topped with sesame seeds - delish!!!
Also very easy to divide - I made a single portion & this recipe's proportions were very easy to figure out (not always so when halving or quartering a recipe).

Wow very special meal. My approach was to pre heat a cast iron pan with Avocado, Coconut, or some other high smoke point oil  and  sear each side about 4 minutes. This leaves a rare middle encrusted in a tasty  covering. Served with a fresh spinach salad  and couscous combined with onions and assorted peppers. Gourmet!

Deliciousa!!!!   I had caught some  blue fin tuna in the deep water of Nigeria... I followed the recipe and added ingredients to it.. Instead of garlic, I used fresh garlic chives, fresh dill, fresh basil, fresh coriander , fresh parsley and just a hint of oregano, and fish chili all from my garden.  and I let it marinate in the fridge.   turning them once.  I doing the recipe, except for the soy sauce.  I heated my flat cast iron comal and when it was hot I drizzled some sesame seed oil and added the tuna steaks , about 2.5 -3  minutes each side. removed from the grill and covered, letting it rest whilst I did another batch of steaks.. I also, boiled down the sauce and put a small amount of butter to it.  once thickened , I drizzled over the tuna steaks,.. I also added the sauce to our salad as well... was a perfect meal ... grazie for the recipe...

As others stated this is a really good marinade.  I also marinated for 2 hours total, 1 1/2 in the refrigerator and another 30 minutes on the counter before putting it on the grill.  Will definitely makes this again.

Had some fresh caught blue fin tuna given to me. Never grilled tuna before. Marinated for 3 1/2hrs. Used fresh squeezed lemon juice. Next time will cut that in half. Did add the honey (1tsp) and reduced remaining marinade after grilling to drizzle over the steaks. 
Oh My Goodness! A definite keeper.

I have made a variation of this, but never thought about adding OJ and lemon! Nice and bright.  I have used this not only on Tuna Steaks, but Chicken also. I tried your recipe and it was a success! Will be adding OJ going forward! Thanks for sharing. Ps- I did add some 5 pepper seasoning to the mix for a little kick.

The sauce was amazing, but I did let it marinate in the sauce for almost 3 hours. I also pan fried it.

Very tasty, but somewhat overpowered the tuna taste.  I boiled the marinade after the tuna steaks were on the grill, but not long enough to boil it down, and ladled it over the tuna and the rice, which is why the marinade flavor was so dominant.  I only had dried parsley & oregano, so used about 1/2 the amount.

I followed the recipe and was liberal with portions.  I also added 1/2 tsp of (real) honey and a 1/2 tsp of light brown sugar.  The marinade tastes great.

This marinate was delicious and simple. I spend most of the summer at the Outer Banks, NC ,have access to fresh tuna and am very picky as to my cooking of this as I don't want to mask the fresh tuna flavor. I followed the recipe, marinated for a couple hours & grilled to med. rare.  This  is now my 1st choice for tuna marinate!

This was the absolutely best tuna steak I've ever made - the only thing I changed was keeping some marinade out for basting (I'm not crazy about re-using marinades that have been on raw food), using dried oregano instead of fresh, and less cooking time - 3 minutes total was just right for our tastes.   Next time I'll make 1/2 a recipe - this makes quite a bit.

I followed the directions exactly and put on grill. Recipe advises to cook to desired wellness,  like a steak I prefer my tuna at a medium wellness so subtracted a minute or two. Just monitor carefully to avoid over cooking. Excellent  results. Highly recommend.

FANTSTIC!
Made this for my family and they loved it! I seared the tuna steaks for 3.5 minutes and nearly charred one side flipped it over and continued to baste the steaks with the remainder of the marinade, again 3.5 min, no longer or they would have burned. The steaks were juicy and delicious and the balance in the sauce was perfect! One of the comments made " high end restaurant quality", I would agree. If you are looking to impress at a special dinner, this is the one!

Very good. Instead of OJ, I used a little bit of high quality vermouth for the sweetness. Milder than OJ and really hit the spot.

What can I say but WOW !!! I live right off the Atlantic Ocean in Humacao Puerto Rico and I've eaten fish all my life. You name it and I've had it and tuna stakes many times. But I have to say that this is THE BEST I have ever had, no questions asked. I did add a few of my own "tricks". Instead of soy sauce I used teriyaki... two tablespoons of sugar with a dash of white vinegar...I used  roasted garlic instead which adds a rich aroma... mandarin (tangerine) orange juice... also add some large shrimp with slices of fresh tangerine 2 minutes before removing the tuna. Grilled the steaks in a very hot cast iron pan with some virgin olive oil for 2 minutes 45 seconds. I like mine nice and pink on the inside.  Was it good ??? Well, I made this dish twice the very first day. That's how delicious it was. I'll be making this dish for my girlfriend which I know she will love and maybe she'll love me more. I accompanied it with steamed white rice, fried green plantains (tostones) and sweet buttered corn. After writing all this I'm hungry again....... Just try it. You won't regret it.... enjoy... bon appétit... buen provecho.

I cut the ahi into 2" X 4" X 2-1/2"  rectangles before marinating.
 We love our tuna rare, so the cooking was a flash. I sliced the tuna before placing it on the dishes, alternating with slices of avocado and tomato.

I prepared marinade as directed, marinaded for 3 hours, and seared in olive oil in a pan over medium high heat, 3 minutes per side. Topped with some homemade Peach Jalapeno BBQ sauce --- tasty seafood recipe.

This recipe is amazing.  I did not have fresh oregano or parsley, so I had to use dried, but it was great just the same.  I also juiced an orange instead of using store bought orange juice.  I have made it twice now, and the first time I did a short marinade of just over 30 mins.  The second time I let it marinade in the fridge for 24 hours.  I have to admit the second marinade was not as good as the quick 30 minute marinade.  It could be that the ahi was just fresher too.  

I also followed others suggestions and seared for just 3 minutes per side, and it was perfect.  After letting them rest for a bit, I ate half of one and then used the rest for my lunches for the week.  They have been great!

I made this marinade by the recipe, except that I substituted smaller amounts of dried parsley and dried oregano because I didn't have fresh. The only negative is that it's too salty with regular soy sauce, so use low-sodium soy sauce, but with that change it is a 5-rating. The second time I made it I also served the marinated tuna with a mango-strawberry-cilantro salsa; all the flavors went together nicely.

I have made this several times now and there are just a couple of things that I do differently. I cook the tuna on top of some cedar planks on my charcoal grill. I also always marinate for at least a couple of hours with this recipe. Doing this really adds a beautiful smoky taste to it and helps the final product a lot. Very good recipe!!! I love to make this and instantly think of it anytime somebody around the house says anything about cooking "fish".

I usually don't have all the exact ingredients for any given recipe, and I always ad lib to make it mine. I used parchment paper and added diced red peppers for color and used coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. The citrus really made this recipe great! Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic. Grilled it and was generous with the elements. I too like other reviewers left it for at least two hours which I felt truly imparted the juiciness, and followed the guidelines of 5-6 minutes each side. My father and I loved it and would recommend a gorgeous white to accompany.

Excellent and Easy. It is difficult to get my husband to eat any fish and I made this with Ahi Tuna and it was Awesome. We did it in a black cast Iron skillet and it was great. I like mine just seared so I put his in the HOT pan with Butter for an extra 1-2 minutes and he had his medium I had mine, they way you should... red inside... yum... A winner for even the pickiest seafood eater.  PS. I used cilantro instead of parsley... yum.

Well, unfortunetly I didn't know that tuna steaks were so expensive until I got to the store . I had to substitute the tuna for salmon and it was AMAZING!!! AMAZING I tell you!!! I am keeping this recipe and will continue to make it again and again.  I followed the recipe to a tee.

I followed the directions exactly (not actually measuring, but I got pretty close). The tuna was excellent!  I will always marinate tuna this way before grilling.

This was so easy and delicious, even to my kids. I sautéed in a cast iron pan with minimal olive oil for 3-4min per side for a good sear.

Even though the recipe says to marinate it for 30 mins, my husband insisted on over night.  So we did and found it to be too orange juice tasting.  It was good and juicy however.  The next time we make it, we will follow the directions for marinate time, but maybe cut a little of the orange juice. We did also put the steaks back on the charcoal grill for another 5 mins.  I like my steaks medium rare and it was a bit too rare for me.

Marinated the tuna steaks I got for about 6 hours before cooking (flipping them halfway through) and then put them on the grill.  Since it's winter, I had to use dried herbs and pre-minced garlic rather than fresh ones, but it still turned out delicious.  Be sure to use half as much of the dried herbs if you do use dried as they tend to be more potent.

This would have been BANGIN' if we left it marinate overnight. We left it sit for about an hour and loved it. We did not grill, we instead pan seared it on medium-high for 2 minutes on each side. Delicious - will make again and let it sit overnight.

I can't believe I have waited this long to cook a tuna steak. I followed this recipe to the letter, with the following additions: I added a little sesame oil (half a teaspoon) and a little pureed ginger that was in the fridge. I seared over hot charcoal for almost exactly 6 minutes (3 per side).  Tip: Remember to save a little bit of marinade (not used with the fish) to pour over as they come off the bbq and rest for 3-5 mins. Slice against the grain. If you are a single guy looking to make something for a date night- prepare for the panties to come off. Great recipe. (Tuna was purchased from Costco)

Excellent marinade. We grilled the tuna steaks, taking care not to overcook (but not rare); still very good -- moist and flavorful. I made without the lemon (didn't have any), and used Bragg's Aminos instead of regular soy sauce. Will prepare this again!

I made this but I didn't have the fresh herbs so I used dry.  I also didn't have a full 1/4 c, oj which I think next time I will make sure I do.  The marinade was good. The tuna steaks turned out good.  Next time I make it I will try with the fresh herbs and more oj.  I hope to give it a five star review next time.

WOW!!!!!! the marinade really went well with the tuna. I was hesitant because of the orange juice.  I am glad I went with the recipe, simply the best tuna steak marinade ever. I will definitely make it again and again as long as I keep catching tuna, lol. the only change I made was the marinade time, I let the tuna marinade for four hours, yummmmmmmm

I did what someone else had done and that was pan frying it. Just 2 minutes on each side and it was amazing. The whole family loved it. I used yellowfin tuna that I caught and had frozen 2 weeks prior.

This should be 6 stars!   I'm not really a big fan of tuna steak, but occasionally order it out. This, however, was fantastic.   Better than any restaurant.  Added some honey to the basting marinade.  It was so good even the next day cold leftovers were amazing.  I cooked it 'till it was no longer pink and it wasn't chewy or tough, either.

This was wonderful!  1  added 1tablespoon of honey to the marinade.   Pan fried the tuna in olive oil and butter, 3 minutes each side.  This would also be great on salmon.

Absolutely delicious.  I only made 2 steaks, and I am not one to worry too much about measuring ingredients.  Highly recommend this!

Very very nice marinade! I really enjoyed this a lot. I do feel it should have marinaded just a bit longer but otherwise it was fantastic. Not an over powering fish and it's flaky, suits my taste perfectly.

We grilled ours, served it with roasted red potatoes and fresh asparagus using the marinade and a tiny bit of olive oil to roast them off slightly. I layed the fish itself on some leftover spinach I had (needed to get it used), did it with same marinade, added green onions and just touched the heat to it slightly.

Very nice, well done on the marinade!

This was the best marinade I've ever used on grilled tuna steak!! Absolutely amazing and very easy to make. I bought wild sushi grade tuna fillet and paired it with basmati rice and sugar snap peas. I will be making this again for sure!!

We ended up frying it on medium high in a bit of oil for 2 1/2-3 min. per side.  Since my hubby isn't really a fish lover, he fried his a minute or two extra per side.  The marinade is just wonderful, full of good flavors.   Since I didn't have fresh herbs, I just added dry, and it still was very tasty.  A keeper!

I made this for my teenage son and he loved it!  However, it was on the verge of too salty for me and I used low-sodium soy sauce, so I would recommend people think about that.  I also seared it in my cast iron pan instead of grilling it.  Otherwise I made it exactly as indicated and it was delicious.  I do like some of the previous suggestions about adding fresh ginger or honey.  I might try that next time -- sounds yummy.

This was really delicious! I think I agree with other reviewers on the low sodium soy sauce. It was a tad salty.  I used fresh herbs in mine and I marinated the tuna steaks for about 3 hours. Pan seared for about 3 minutes per side.  It was still pink in the middle. I didn't know fish could taste that amazing!

This is fantastic! 

I did make a few substitutions: I switched out the soy sauce for tamarine as it is gluten free and swapped lemon juice for lime.  I also just used basil and thyme for spice as they were what was on hand. 

This recipe is so good that my father, who absolutely hates canned tuna, took a bite and really liked it. 

I ate it with Shanghai style vegetables and a salad but it would go really well with rice. 

I'll definitely be making this again!

this turned out really good.. i loved how it was flavorful and not overly sweet.. i used the recipe to marinate 1.25 lbs of tilapia.. i juiced and zested one orange for the orange juice.. reduced the olive oil to 1.5 tsp.. subbed cilantro for parsley and probably doubled the amount.. and left out the fresh oregano as i had none.. we were very pleased with the results.. ty for the recipe ~~UPDATE: i'm so glad i stumbled across this recipe again and was able to try it on some ahi.. it was super delicious even with using a bottled sour orange for the regular orange juice.. i still subbed cilantro for the parsley and used dried oregano for the fresh this time.. super yummy.. ty again for the recipe

Fantastic recipe! Cooked (4) 1" steaks that were 11 oz each. Doubled the recipe and added 2 tbsp honey, marinated for 30 minutes. Cooked on gas grill on high 2 minutes seared each side then turned to low/indirect heat for 2 more minutes each side and it came out perfect! Marinated during each flip.

Delicious!! I marinated for two hours (flipping the tuna steaks over half way through) and cooked them for 6 minutes on each side. This left them only slightly pink in the middle but still tender. Big hit even with the kiddos. Thanks!

Hubby & 4yr old liked it, but I thought it was too salty. I know that's subjective, so I will try it again but cut the amount of soy sauce, increase the orange juice or add honey/agave.
Thanks!

Made it just as instructed only marinated for 24 hrs and pan-seared it. Even my  picky teenaged boy loved it.  Will do this one again.

This was a great recipe, the marinade is wonderful.  I grilled until the outside was starting to turn dark - inside was perfect, still pink in the middle.  The flavors in the marinade worked great together.

Simple and simply amazing.  Use a heavy skillet and follow directions. HIGH HEAT like Nolan Ryan's fastball is necessary. 

I cooked only 4 minutes a side, covering the skillet to avoid splatter. This kept the tuna moist. Nice carmelization of marinade, making this the best tuna steak I've had in a long while.

This soooo tasty.  The only thing I tweaked was with the lemon juice.  I use fresh lemon and if I use the juice I also use some of the peel.  We loved this so much that I think I wll try this on chicken as well.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe almost to the letter except I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried. Tuna can be expensive so be sure and undercook it rather than overcook it. Tuna continues to cook after you take it off the heat.

This was great very tasty and so easy. I did alter it a little as I didn't have all that it asked for. I substituted: vegetable oil which was ok but olive would of been so much nicer. And I did add along with the required juices (orange & lemon),garlic,pepper, and soy about a tablespoon of "orange marmalade". Which gave it an extra little bit of sweetness. yummy!!! Thanks for the recipe

This was a great marinade.  It was not overpowering, but gave a wonderful flavor to the tuna steaks.  Even my husband, who is not wild about fish, made several comments on how good it was.  I will definitely be making this again, but will bbq the tuna for a shorter time. 5 minutes/side was a little too long.  As another reviewer suggested, I might try adding fresh ginger and sesame oil next time, for variety only - the recipe is great the way it is!

I couldn't get any fresh parsley or oregano, so I had to use the dry seasoning. Also, couldn't grill due to rain. i cut 8 tuna steak servings about 1 inch thick and 3 1/2 inches round, marinated in the fridge for 30 minutes, and broiled it for 5 minutes per side basting after the flip. Turned out great! Really like the flavor as did the rest of the family. Probably could have shaved off a minute or so of cooking to make it a little more juicy, but was very pleased. Thanks for the recipe.

Used tangerines instead of oranges other than that followed the recipe. Great taste very Moorish. I BBQ'd with broccoli chilli flakes and lemon wedges.

I loved this recipe for a few reasons:
1.  It was easy to make.
2.  The tuna was cooked all the way through--I'm not really into the whole searing tuna thing.  The only raw tuna I eat is in sushi.
3.  The marinade was fantastic.

Made 3 tuna steaks (or 2 large ones). Broiled it instead at 400, 10 min on the first side 5 min on the flip. After flip poured remaining marinate on top. I didn't have O.J., used 2.5 tbl spoons of fresh lemon instead.  Used 1.5 tbl sp of garlic powder (Didn't have fresh). Turned out AWESOME. Can't wait to have again.

Flavor just bursts from the tuna, even with the minimum marinating time of 30 minutes.   I pan seared fish instead of grilling for 4 minutes each side and I couldn't have been happier with the result.  An uncomplicated must save recipe for marinating fish.  Delicious!

This marinade is definitely our favorite! My husband loves it and always asks for it when we have tuna steaks. We're trying it with salmon tonight. Sometimes I use pineapple juice with the Orange juice.

My family loved this. It was too cold to grill so I pan seared.  I was not as pleased as they were but it was good, not great.  I will make again this summer and try on the grill.  Sometimes it is also just the fish you got that particular day.  Well worth everyone giving a try.

Was not a huge fan of tuna steaks, unless in usual "sesame Ahi tuna" type style. This was awesome, and totally changed the flavor profile. Loved it, and the other comments were extremely helpful. We marinated about 3 hours, and then pan seared. Thumbs up.

Best steak tuna recipe out there. Won't try another after this. Marinade give such a clean flavor to the steak. Simple and quick minus the time it takes to marinade

Absolutely the best tuna steaks we ever had. Restaurant quality. We're having a NorEaster so i couldn't grill so i did what another reviewer said to do, i pan cooked 30 seconds each side alternating sides for 7 minutes. The middle was red red so i covered it with foil and when we sat down to eat the middle was pink. PERFECT. I followed recipe exactly and my steaks were pretty thick, maybe 1 1/2" thick. Next time i'm going to try what others have suggested, maybe honey, maybe fresh ginger. ohhh i can't wait.

Amazing dish, we had it marinade overnight then threw it on the grill.
I maybe should have reduced the grill from high heat to med as we found it to be over grilled (slightly dry).....opps

This recipe was outstanding! I added 1 pack of McCormicks Chipolte seasoning pack for 2 fresh tuna steaks to this recipe also, and the results had my husband and myself raving about how delicious, quick and easy this was to prepare and grill. I also let marinate for at least 3-4 hrs. By the time we prepared this a second time, I added just a little more of the measured ingredients because my tuna steaks were bigger than the recipes. Everyone should try this formula. Can't be beat. Thanks AllRecipes for the ingredients for a great meal.

Great seasoning for tuna steak I didn't use no orange juice and I broiled my Tuna steak for 9 minutes in the oven. I butter and salt my iron pan and add my tuna steaks, flip them ones before they were done.Put more left over seasoning yummy.

Grilled my tuna steaks and they were the best!  I like my fish a little dry so I grilled them about 5 minutes each side.  also basted while they were grilling.  My husband is not crazy about fish, but he loved it.

5 STARS! Fantastic. i've made it a few times and gave the link to owners of the fish store that flies in fresh tuna. It produced best grilled tuna i've ever had. You can reduce down the marinade to make a flavor bomb of a glaze. 2+ hrs in the marinade is best.

Very good, followed the recipe exactly and this review is by my husband as I don't eat seafood. I did follow others suggestion to add honey, gave it a couple of swirls and the family suggested just a little bit more next time.

Good flavor.  I also sprinkled with sesame seeds right before cooking.   I had to cook these inside because the weather turned on me.  I cooked for 3 min/side and it was too long.  Only a little pink inside, I prefer it more rare.

This was good, but I had to add some brown sugar to make it less tangy and a little more sweet.  Just personal preference - we like the sweeter teriyaki sauce.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Cooked down leftover marinade and poured over the tuna steak. Will make it again.

I hate fish. I know ate is a strong word but it applies here.  Since it is so healthy to eat, I revisit it from time to time.  I never make it past the first bite.  I made this and I ate the entire filet!  Unbelievable recipe.  I will marinade it longer the next time I make it.  Yep the next time.  On the nutrition scale tuna is a 82!!!!!  Finally a fish recipe I can eat.  Thank you for posting.

Delicious! I added some fresh ginger and honey to the recipe and marinated the tuna steaks for about 2 hours prior to cooking and it came out wonderful! I would recommend cooking it for very little on each side (3-4 min.) to make sure you don't over cook.

Was good but lacked a lot of the flavor I expected to get from the orange juice and soy sauce combo, sprinkle of salt while cooking will probably help it.

This was a a great recipe, but it didn't have quite the intense flavor that I was looking for.  I followed other reviews' advice and marinated the tuna steaks for almost 2 hours it was definitely worth the wait.  Also, I saved the remaining marinade (and cooked it for a very long time, just in case) and used it to pour on individual servings of the tuna.  It was very nice to have a bit more flavor for the tuna.

Outstanding! A friend shared some tuna steaks that he caught, and this recipe was very worthy of the awesome fresh fish! Definately will use this again if he shares more.

Excellent however instead of soy sauce I used 1/4 that amount in hoisin sauce.  Turned out amazing!  I used this marinade for making grilled tuna kabobs for a party and they were such a huge hit!

Good marinade, wife loved it.  I prefer a fish that flakes well...much more so than tuna steaks.

This is wonderful. Will absolutely cook this again. I did have it in the marinade for about 2 hours and forgot to baste it but it was very flavorful. We cooked it over a gas grill with added charcoal and a hickory chunk. I agree with other comments the dryness some complained of is due to overcooking not the marinade.

I thought this was terrific.  I had fresh basil in the garden so I used that instead of oregano.  Other than that, I made it as above.  My whole family loved it.

The whole family liked it, and they usually only like breaded fish. (Well, the youngest didn't love it, but she ate it!) I had 2 one-pound tuna steaks, so I doubled the marinade, but the cooking time remained nearly the same. (I think we did 8 minutes per side rather than 6.) Very fast and simple; my 11-year-old enjoyed helping with the marinade.

Marinade is ok but think it needs more... its a little acidic with both the lemon AND the orange.  Balance it out with 1 to 2 tablespoons of honey, this will also make your marinade a little sticky when cooking. NICE! Also, I put half coriander to parsley which lifts it a little :o)

We loved this recipe! Will make again. I grilled it on foil on the grill with indirect heat, it wasn't dry, just right and delicious. My husband and kids loved it and they usually detest any fish I try to feed them unless it's from a can and placed on bread! Thanks for sharing.

Awesome...have tried it with Tuna and Swordfish.  I slice Fresh Ginger real thin and add it to the marinade...also make sure it makes it to the fish.  I've grilled and pan seared...excellent combination of flavors.  I add honey when grilling...helps to get a good char on the outside...

This is the best tuna steak recipe by far; very moist and flavorful.  It isn't dry at all.  I also pan seared and added some marinade to the pan while cooking.  This will be my go-to recipe for tuna steak.

Fixed this last night - it was superb.  Two things I did differenty were using fresh cilantro (didn't have the parsley) and preparing it on a cast iron grill on the stove.

I had all the ingredients on hand so decided to whip this up real quick... The marinade was fabulous. It was freezing outside so tried to cook it inside... Big mistake! I had major trouble with the oil popping and flying out of the pan! My stove top, floor counter and walls were covered in oil. It was my first time trying to sear fish over high heat, next time will grill outside like the recipe says :)

I accidentally added 1/4 cup lemon juice.  I also used lemon olive oil.  It was very, very good.  Only marinaded about 15 minutes.  I will use a little less next time,but will still use more than a Tablespoon.  I also cooked it in the marinade.

Pretty great! I added ground ginger, honey, and sesame seeds to the marinade, let it sit for 2 hours, and seared it for 2 min on each side in a hot pan on the stove. Perfectly cooked and I would definitely make this again. Served with a side of roasted brussel sprouts. Yum!

First time i tried this, also added a little bit of finly chopped thyme. This came out SUPERB- whole family loved it, the only problem i have..  is everyone now said from now on- i have to make sunday lunch and mom will have a break. Guess that part of being a dad and trying to impress all didnt work well as now i have to cook more often  LOL

Delicious. I marinated it overnight and was always skeptical about eating fish rare but knowing that's how you are suppose to cook tuna, I bit the bullet. So glad I did. I will definitely make this again!

Unbelievably good.  Tasted like it was from a restaurant. Followed recipe as is but shortened time so it was still raw in the center. Kids ate the more cooked areas, adults enjoyed every part.  Tuna-riffic!

it turned out great but the only thing I could taste in the marinade was the garlic. Three stars since most of the flavour came from the well cooked fish and not bad tasting marinade but the marinade didn't enchance or flatter the tuna steak. I will probably try again with less garlic amd more orange juice-who knows, maybe the review will change.

Excellent....the marinade allowed the flavor of the fish to shine without overwhelming it. Had a nice glaze and maintained the moistness of the fish. Will use again!

Delicious, added just about 1 teaspoon of honey at the end after reading others reviews, otherwise followed the recipe exactly, except I only had 2 Tuna Steaks, it only took about 5 mins total to cook them and they were definitely medium well, which was how I liked them, but if you're looking for rare it may take even less time.  I'll definitely use this marinade again, and may consider trying it for other fish/meats. Update: 6/8/11...trying this on pork chops tonight...we'll see how it turns out!

Delicious and juicy. I marinated the tuna a day in advance and it was great (even without the oregano and parsley). Instead of regular soy I used "ketjap manis" which is a sweet soy sauce often used in indonesian meals. For those who don't like the taste/smell of fish, try this...ít tastes great and it doesn't look, smell or taste like fish at all. This will definetly be on our menu a few times per month.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes EVER! My husband and I return to this time and time again for a low calorie, mouth watering, gourmet style meal with very little prep & cook time. It is so simple to prepare and never disappoints. My mouth begins to water just at the thought of it!

I could only marinate for 30 minutes but it was still pretty good.  Served with sauteed spinach and noodles.

This was pretty good....not the best fish recipe I've tried on here but it was still pretty good. I seared it on the stove instead of grilling it & also marinated it for about an hour. Other than that I made it exactly as written. It was good but I think next time I wont turn the stove up as high it was a bit too charred on top for me but other than that was good!

This was the first time I fixed Tuna Steak and thought this did well.  Be careful not to marinade it too long (less than an hour is good).  Really easy and will try again.  Don't overcook either - I did these at 5 to 6 minutes and it was almost too long.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I had never had a tuna steak in my life.  I am not much of a fish eater.  I tried this and it is my favorite thing to cook on the grill.  No fishy taste at all.  The mistake I made once was not timing it on the grill.  Follow the directions exactly and it is a tiny bit pink in the middle and so tender it melts in your mouth.  Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe on the grill last night and it was perfect. Probably the best Tuna steak I have ever had. No need to change a thing. I read one review that stated this would go good with the Orange Rice Medley dish on this website and it did. Served with grilled asparagus and you can not go wrong.

this is a great recipe-but take note not to overcook the tuna.  the center should be pink, overcooked tuna is dry and flavorless.  this recipe goes well with the orange rice featured on this website.

This was really delicious. The only change I made to the recipe was adding a little lime juic and a small dab of honey. Served on an onion flatbread with a tomato, cucumber, onion and olive salad - devine!

Nice, although a little salty for my liking.  I used the zest of the lemon, and more fresh oregano than the recipe said.  Would make it again, perhaps using 1/4 cup of soy and 1/4 of wine

I gave this 5 stars because it's the first fish recipe that my family actually LOVED! My husband usually would push a fish plate away after one bite and say "that's all he can eat". I was very very very pleased when he ate the whole thing, and commented throughout about how great it was. My 3 year old son cleaned up the tuna before eating anything else on his plate. This is a true gem for me, and I will make it again and again!! Thank you so much for this YUMMY dish!!

I made this without the oregano and parsley because I didn't have fresh on hand. I used it to marinate both a tuna steak and shrimp. We cooked a 6 ounce tuna steak for about 5 minutes a side and it was just about perfect. The shrimp was very good in this marinade as well. Not a bad basic tuna recipe.

LOVE this marinade.  It is also phenomenal on boneless chicken thighs.  Marinate the thighs for a longer period and throw them on the grill.  Great summer dish!

Only marinated for an hour.  Good flavor.  Pan seared it for 2 minutes, a little too long.  My husband liked it.

My husband LOVED this, he said it was restaurant quality.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I used dried parsley.  I heated a cast iron skillet on high.  Then added a little olive oil and seared about 2 mins on each side.  I loved it and I dont think I have ever lked tuna when I tried it.

Pretty good although the cooking time recommended is a touch long. Otherwise I thought the marinade was nice, not overpowering. We enjoyed it!

Easy marinade, and it tasted great. It didn't  overpower the tuna steaks.  It made the tuna steaks more flavorful.  I added a little ginger to add some more kick to it though! :-)

Mabe it needs a boost or to marinate longer....but as instructed I didn't taste much marinade flavor. It was not bad....it's just that what I tasted was mostly "tuna" and "grill".....not much of the marinade flavor.

This tasty recipe has converted my husband to eating fish without hiding it under the vegetables. I could still enjoy the flavour of the tuna and he couldn't get over how succulent and flavoursome fish could be. We had it with brown rice, red beans and asparagus.

I use this marinade all the time on tuna steaks.  It has a nice balance of sweet, salty, and tangy.  If cooked correctly on the grill, high heat to sear it, and pink inside, it comes out perfectly.  Be careful not to overcook it.

This was delicious. I was going for an Asian flavor, so I used fresh ginger instead of oregano. I simmered the remaining marinade while the tuna was grilling and reduced it by about 2/3, then served it over the tuna, and that was the kicker. I grilled the tuna for a total of about 4 minutes for a nice medium-rare (I had thick steaks). Good stuff!

We have a traeger grill and cooked it 10mins on one side and 7 on the other and it was outstanding. We used a thick steak. Really good for people who don't normally eat fish.

Simple, wonderful recipe!  I pan-seared the steaks.  Next time I'll cut down on the soy sauce, and serve with a walnut-apricot couscous and a salad.  But this time, I ate up the fill all by itself :)

Delicious and juicy!  As another reviewer suggested, I pan fried the marinated steaks, turning every 30 seconds for about 5 minutes over medium heat.  Also, I didn't use the orange juice and it was still very tasty!  This is definitely my favorite tuna recipe.

I've never made tuna steak before so I was looking for an easy recipe (with a lot of good reviews too). This one was fantastic! I had four (4) larger steaks so I doubled the recipe, however, not being a salt fan, I didn't quite double the soy sauce. I might add scallions next time I make them but they were great without.

I really liked this recipe, the marinade was awesome. I followed the directions to a T and my husband was really impressed. The only thing I will do different next time is allow it to sit in the refrigerator for more than 30 minutes. I would have like the favor to be more pronounced because it was so good!

This recipe was incredible!! So simple to make.  I made the recipe as is but substituted dry herbs for fresh herbs.  I marinated for 2 hours in a ziplock bag.  I took the fish out of the fridge 10 minutes before i was ready to cook and seared it for 3 minutes each side on a pan preheated with evoo on medium high heat.  My tuna steak was thick so I seared it on each side for 30 seconds as well.  I boiled the extra marinade and served it over the fish.  AMAZING!! my boyfriend loved this.  will be making again and again.  Thank you!!

This was amazing! My boyfriend does not like fish like I do, but he devoured this recipe and went right out to buy more tuna so I could make it again. I let the steaks sit in the marinade for over two hours. I let the tuna come up to room temp before searing as it helps the cooking process and then I pan seared the tuna for about 2 minutes on each side for rare steaks.

Earnest compliments from both wife and mother (who doesn't like fish that much). I added some ginger and powdered wasabi to the marinade. I poured some reduced Balsamic on the finished tuna and \that went over well also.

This recipe is a keeper.  I did find 5 minutes a side was a bit too long as I like my tuna steaks a bit more med rare.  I took it down to 4 minutes a side and it was perfect.  I did add a tablespoon of grated ginger and my family raved about the taste.

I love this because it doesn't require long marinating time (which I can never plan for because dinner is always a last minute thing for me).  We cook this all the time on the grill in the summer.  Yummy!

I've never liked tuna steaks because they are so dry, but not with this recipe!  I made sure to use plenty of (olive) oil in the bottom of the pan.  These were delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

So yummy! Wouldn't change a thing, very flavorful!  My husband doesn't normally like meat sweetened with orange juice and doesn't really like soy sauce and he loved the flavor of this marinade.

Marinated was great!  We did mix it up a bit, instead of parsley 2 tablespoons of cilantro was added and 1 tablespoon of lime juice to replace the oregano!  Seared for 3/4 minutes on each side.  The tuna had a great flavor with a zip of citrus!

This is a great recipe, however, the suggested cooking time of 5-6 minutes per side is excessive. I'd suggest 3-4 minutes per side at most.  There's nothing worse than a dried-out, overcooked tuna steak.

We over cooked it on the gas grill.  Next time I plan to sear both sides for one minute each with the top up on high heat and then turn it down to medium and put it up for one minute on each side.  I am sure this will leave it rare on the inside.  five minutes was just too long. But the marinade is a keeper.

When my husband got home I hadn't started dinner so we had a little appetizer and then marinated tuna steaks--30 minutes in this marinade (using dried herbs) was great!  We just loved it.  Will make again and give to friends.

This recipe was not bad at all, but I had to cook the Tuna all the way, so it was a little dry and chewy. I also was unable to grill it (We don't have a grill where I work:( Otherwise it would have came out much better. It didn't have a strong flavor, next time I may add a bit more and/or marinate a little longer.

This was fabulous!  Didn't change a thing in terms of the recipe, however due to the weather, we had to cook indoors.  We seared the filets in a very hot frying pan, and they came out wonderfully!  Can't wait to make this again!

I've made this recipe many times now and it has always been wonderful. Tuna steak is easily ruined by over cooking, so do the steaks last and pay very close attention. My brother in law has ordered Tuna at many 5 star restaurants all over the country and swears this is the best he's ever had.

Pretty tasty. Neither the orange or soy flavors stood out particularly strongly. I couldn't resist adding some wasabi paste to the sauce, and it was excellent.

This was really good! I made some changes to it and the blend of tastes was really great - I marinated 2 steaks, added 3 crushed garlic cloves and about 1/3rd cup chopped cilantro  - skipped parsley and oregano. It was absolutely yummy, very succulent indeed!

This was the first time I've ever cooked or eaten a tuna steak and it came out DELICIOUS!  I put a 1/2 tsp of honey in the marinade, as well as a sprinkle of rosemary, as both were recommendations from previous viewers. I also used low sodium soy sauce and all dried spices (except garlic) as that is what was in the house.  My fiance and I loved it, and will be making this again and trying the marinade on other meat as well. 
I grilled my tuna steak, flipping every minute, and cooked it for 9 minutes total.  It was moist and tasty, though I will cook it for 30 sec-1 min less next time.  My fiance seared his for 3 min on each side and was very pleased.  THANKS!

My RV "dinner party" loved this recipe--we bbq'd the tuna on a gas grill following a 2-hour marinade.  I can't believe I didn't have any soy sauce, but the recipe worked beautifully anyway...the grilling gave it more substance.  I just upped the garlic and salt a bit. Served it with rice pilaf and  garlicky/parmesan broccoli.  The photo, by the way, really doesn't do the tuna justice... Really lovely.  Thanks.

extreamly easy and as how many other garlic lovers suggested I made this with 3 cloves of garlic. Also cooked the tuna on the forman grill for 5min(we do like sushi). On tuna this is awsome and now I am going to try this for some calamari steak too :)

This was a great recipe that the entire family enjoyed.  Extremely flavorful.  Followed other users suggestions and  modified recipe with 3/4 cups of orange juice, a little lesst than 1/4 cup of soy sauce, and added a tablespoon of honey.  I also marinated for 10 hours (made marinade that morning). Some parts of tuna became dry, while others did not. Although I am sure that was due to my cooking, and NOT the marinade.

Delicious marinade!  I marinated the tuna steaks a long time, probably 5 hours or so.  I used fresh tuna steak and I just used dried parsley because I didn't have the fresh.  These were sooo good!  We've never had tuna steak before, now we will be having it much more often!

An easy to make and very tasty marinade for tuna - I used fresh steaks, and the only slight change I made was to marinade for over an hour and I used 2 tbsp of chopped, fresh oregano. I'm going to try the mixture on chicken next.

Absolutely loved it!  We cooked it a bit too long (6 minutes on one side and only 2 minutes on the other because we were sure it would be too long otherwise for the size we had).  We will definitely make again.

Very tasty! I marinaded the steaks for 30 minutes and cooked them on the George Forman Grill until the fish was just cooked through to the center, about 7 minutes. The marinated smelled great while cooking and the fish was very moist. I will definately make it again and will try the marinade with other fish and meats.

I used two 4 ounce tuna steaks and marinated them in 1/3 cup orange juice (some pulp), 1/4 cup soy sauce, 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tb of honey and the spices as listed. I marinated them for an hour (flipping them over half way through) and pan seared them in the sauce and some olive oil. This made them sweet with just a taste of saltiness. Great recipe!

The marinading time definitely needs to be increased so as to enjoy the mix of flavors.  I marinaded for 45min to 1 hour and even then, couldn't even detect the orange juice flavor which is what I was hoping for.  I wish now that I had taken the advice of other reviewers and added a touch of honey to the marinade. It was edible - tuna steak is one of my most favorite foods, but it wasn't memorable.

Found this to be an excellent recipe. Followed the advice and was well pleased. I did use lemon pepper once the tuna was on the grill, but otherwise, followed the recipe.

Fantastic!!!  I overcooked the steaks a bit but the flavor was super.  I used garlic powder to save some time and clean up and it was fine...can't wait to use real garlic next time and will be more mindful of the cooking time and grill temp.  This would be fantastic on chicken as well!  Thanks!

This is a very good marinade recipe.  I overcooked my tuna and it was still great.  Served the tuna on top of some fresh sorrel (lemon tasting herb) and yum, yum is all I can say.

This was really great and thats saying something because I don't really like fish. I added in a little honey to the marinade just because I like things kinda sweet. I ate this with plain old white rice with butter and sugar mixed in it. Really good.

I agree that this recipe was pretty blah tasting. I admit I did cut out the orange juice (it just sounded gross with the other ingredients), but I don't think it would have made that much difference. I think I over cooked the tuna as it was a little dry and tough. I'll probably try this recipe one more time and tweak it a little by adding honey and letting it marinade a lot longer and cooking it for less time.

This marinade is unbelievable!  I cooked it in a skillet on the stove instead of grilling it so the flavor really obsorbed into the fish.  Sooo good!

Blah!  I even 'marinated' it for an hour and there was still no flavor.  Sorry by I don't think I'll be making this again.

I absolutely hated this recipe.  I have never eaten a tuna steak before but am a fish lover (as is my husband) and we both thought this recipe was just nasty.  Perhaps some of it was the fish (it was VERY fish tasting), but we found this recipe to very salty and needed something sweet in the marinade (honey perhaps).  Needless to say, we will not try this again.

Wonderfully tender, but WAY too salty. I'd recommend putting in 1-2 tbsps of soy sauce instead of 1/4 c. I used dried oregano b/c I didn't have any fresh, but it didn't work well. I'd recommend using fresh or omitting it if you don't have fresh. I pan seared the tuna steaks as another reviewer did & they came out great. They got a lovely golden color w/o drying out. I will make this again w/ the above adjustments. Thanks for a keeper!

This is delicious. The goober reviewer below recommended this to me, and I love it. Thanks, Aug! I didn't even use the OJ, since I'm not crazy about sweet marinades, and it was still wonderful.

Loved this recipe. Very fast and not much time to prepare. My wife really enjoys this also. Came in handy when I was remodeling my kitchen and would grill all our meals.

Our only complaint is that we ate too much! What a great marinade.  Thanks so much. Can't imagine anything better than this recipe for tuna steak. We had twice baked potatoes and steamed green beans with it.

Excellent Marinade, makes tuna very flavorful.
