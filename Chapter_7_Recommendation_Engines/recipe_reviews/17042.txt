I made this dish and served it over white rice.  The whole family loved it.  It was quite easy to make and very tasty.  For a lower fat version, substitute the cream for fat free evaporated milk or half and half.

A new favorite.  Add a little ginger, garlic, and salt to the chutney.

I'm sorry, but this sauce basically tastes like milk and cilantro, no melding of the flavors what so ever. It aches for spices and seasonings, namely salt. Plus the cream never thickens up because the juices from the chicken keep it thinned out so the consistency was disappointing. I rinsed the thin sauce off the chicken and shredded it.

This was quite good & a bit different from the run of the mill chicken type cream dishes.  Next time I think I'll use boneless chicken breasts & cut them in chunks and add to cream sauce.

DO YOU LIKE CILANTRO?  IF SO, THIS IS YOUR RECIPE!!  YUMMO!!  I USED BONELESS/SKINLESS.. MIXED GINGER ROOT AND GARLIC INTO CREAM. COOKED AS DIRECTED.. TOOK LONGER THAN DIRECTED.. DID NOT THICKEN AS RECIPE SUGGESTS, HARD TO THICKEN WITH THE CHICKEN JUICE LEAKING INTO THE CREAM..  WHEN CHICKEN WAS DONE I TOOK UP CHICKEN AND ADDED CREAM /CHICKEN JUICE MIX INTO BLENDER WITH THE CILANTRO MIX.. SERVED OVER CHICKEN..  JUICE WAS AS THIN AS WATER UPON REHEATING.. BUT.......  THE FLAVOR WAS AMAZING!!!!! CHICKEN WAS TENDER.....

I'd never baked chicken in cream before, but found it a little odd because the fat separated from the water and formed 2 layers in the baking dish.  When I'd finished, the flavor was okay - but too much work is required here for a mediocre end product.

Fine recipe, feel the sauce would have better suited fish than chicken.
