We seared the roast in a skillet with olive oil before moving it to the instant pot.  We also added extra pepperoncini because we love it!

This was our first meal with the instant pot, and it turned out so much better than when we cook this same type of roast in a crock pot!

Substitute hot pepper rings for pepperocini. Makes a fabulous French Dip (lots of broth). A great way to use leftover roast is to cook noodles half way, drain, put back in pan. Put frozen peas on top. Add heated roast and plenty of broth. Cover and cook on low stirring once until noodles are done.

Amazing!  The only modifications I made were to salt, pepper, and sear the roast first in olive oil (5 minutes per side on the saute setting), and I added some fire roasted red peppers that I happened to have in a jar in the fridge.  Tender, juicy, huge flavor and just the right kick.

I used sliced pepperonis and it was great! Everyone got some pepperoni (and their wonderful flavor) with each bite! This is definitely part of the meal rotation from now on.

Mostly followed the recipe, except browned the meat first using saute function. The Au Jus is delicious, used it for french dip sandwiches a few days later.

The flavor of this roast was amazing and so tender! I didn't have a packet of ranch mix so I substituted with 3 tablespoons of ranch dressing. I also added 1 red onion thin sliced like another reviewer suggested as well as seared the roast on both sides prior to adding the rest of the ingredients to the pot. We made mashed potatoes to go with this and made a gravy using the broth from the roast. It also reheated really well which was great! For leftovers we made a french dip style sandwich which was also awesome. Will definitely be making this again.

I made it exactly as the recipe was written, in an Instant Pot.  I think it was cooked too long as the meat was dry.

This was GOOD! I used this as a base to what I wanted to do with my instant pot. The peppercinis add so much needed flavor but I got a little out of control adding the juice - so beware and control the pour!!! Ours in probably too spicy for our lil toddler man who is two years old so more for us haha. 

It was done in 2 hours like the recipe says and it was so tender.  I seared the roast using saut√©e method on my instapot first and a little bacon grease.  I also used two gravy mixes at the beginning of the recipe mixed with 2 cups water (instead of boullion or beef broth). I also had italian packet instead of onion soup mix. I added onion and carrots besides the peppericinins on the top. Definitely going to be a staple in my instant pot recipe book!!! So good.

I used Oxo Beef rather than onion soup mix but added slivered red onion. The result was wonderful.

It was excellent! I used sliced pepperoncinis so nobody got a mouthful of pepperoncini instead of a small flavoring.  Definitely loved how fast it was made in the Instant Pot.

I make this all the time in my crock pot. It is so good, easy and flavorful. I like to add potatoes and carrots so they also have that great flavor. I also make the sauce into gravy after the roast is done. It is so good!
