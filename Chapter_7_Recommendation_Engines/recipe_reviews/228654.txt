I used TWO maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal packets in this recipe as I seem to be out of plain instant oats in my pantry right now. I also used lowfat buttermilk. I've made pancakes with oatmeal before so I knew to let the batter sit 10-15 minutes as the oats need to soak up some of the liquid. This way you know to gauge if the batter needs more liquid. Mine did NOT. The pancakes puffed up nicely and turned out light and fluffy. My husband and kids ate up every single one of these pancakes......my husband especially surprized me by telling me how much he liked this recipe.

These are great - so much flavor!  Make sure your milk is hot enough for the oatmeal in the milk to soak it all in.  I doubled the cinnamon. Whole family loved them, including my husband who doesn't 'like stuff' in his pancakes!

Perfect! Easy to make and tasty. I made a bunch and froze them to reheat in the toaster oven on busy mornings.

These are wonderful.  It is a small batch (about 6 medium pancakes), so make extra if you want leftovers.  Great recipe!

Good pancakes, but too much baking powder. I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla extract and added 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Kids ate them up faster than I could cook more, and they didn't need syrup because the chocolate chips gave them that extra sweetness. Recipe made 13 mid-size pancakes, which I was surprised since it didn't look like a lot of batter. Don't over mix, otherwise they will come out flat.

These pancakes are really terrible. I usually love any kind of oatmeal pancakes, but I thought these were a waste of time and ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out a gross chewy texture. They also tasted an awful lot like baking powder. I would not recommend this recipe!!!!

I used slow cooking oats instead of quick cooking oats, and added pieces of Lindor dark chocolate "chips". It was out of this world!

I am the submitter of this recipe. Thank you for trying it. 3 kids in school later, I found that the less dishes used, the better. I now use a big glass measuring cup to heat up the milk. I then stir the oatmeal and UNmelted butter in with the milk. Let it sit for a few minutes, then measure the rest of the ingredients directly into the cup and stir up. One dish! It is awesome!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe to 6 servings for our hungry family and had about 1 Â½ servings left, which is perfect for us. I know there isn't much sugar in the recipe, but I think I will leave it out next time since it tasted fine without it and put on syrup anyway. Very hearty and filling!

This is very similar to the recipe I use for my oatmeal pancakes. My family loves oatmeal pancakes, I will change this recipe in the fall time by mixing in pumpkin pie spice (about 1/2 tsp give or take) and some pumpkin puree usually 3 to 4 tablespoons to add a little fall fun to the morning.

I have made these packcakes a few times and really love them. I have made them with gluten free flower and I actually switch out a 1/3 of a cup of flour for 1 scoop of whey protein powder.  Didn't really notice an issue with consistancy as the pancakes will cook up golden anyway.  Very filling....

For a low calorie version of this recipe. I made them with organic soy milk, and no cal sweetener. I also topped them w a strawberry syrup I made with no cal sweetener. They were yummy and only about 145 cal a piece. The topping adds only about a additional 13 cal. I liked them a lot, will make them again.

I've been searching for the recipe for ages. Used to make it all the time and lost it. Have tried others but they're not as good. It's a great way to get oatmeal into something fun to eat and it's filling too.

this was so good! my only complaint is the cook time but i should know better than to blindly follow cooking guides.. i cut the recipe in half (did my own math).. reduced the baking powder by a third b/c of the complaints that it tasted too much like baking powder, cut the sugar in half, and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla like most others did.. i used soy milk for regular milk and canola oil for the butter.. i added some chocolate chips to my last pancake which turned out to be my favorite.. this half recipe made 3 - 5 inch pancakes.. ty so much for the recipe

I soak rolled oats in the milk overnight.  What a great way to add fiber to the diet.  Like other reviewers, I upped the cinnamon. I also add mashed up over-ripe bananas.  My family loves oatmeal-banana pancakes.  They have so much more flavor than regular panakes.

Made these pancakes for brunch today...They were great.  The only thing I did different was I used white whole wheat flour in place of regular AP flour.... Will make them again.

Delicious :) I added 2tbs of natural peanut butter with the milk before heating and adding oatmeal. The family was all excited about pb pancakes and didn't even notice the oatmeal. Hubs used grape jelly, the youngest and I used chocolate/hazelnut spread. Next time I will put in some chunks of banana.

I didn't add 1/4 cup of milk but added an extra egg and a rip banana. Very healthy, can substitute refined sugar with honey or fruits.

I swapped out the milk for almond milk, and used wheat flour instead. I followed the recipe step by step with no other modifications and they were DELICIOUS!

My boyfriend is a huge pancake lover, not a fan of oatmeal, and I am the complete opposite and we both KILLED ALL OF IT.

My only remark for next time will be to not add the additional bit of milk when mixing all of the ingredients together. I believe that made the batter way more watery than liked, thus making the pancakes more flat than fluffy.

Instead of cooking the oatmeal first i opted to let it soak like the previous reviewer. I used instant apple cinnamon oatmeal. I also added a capful of jack Daniels honey, 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed, and a few tablespoons of melted butter and bacon fat. once the mixture was completed it smelled Amazing. i decided to grease a bundt cake pan and bake all the batter on 350 so the whole house could smell that good. its working and my oatcake looks delicious.

These were ok, not a lot of flavor. I think next time I will add a little more butter and sugar in place of some milk to try to get a better flavor. A good way to get extra fiber in your diet! Add 2 Tablespoons butter instead of 2 teaspoons.

Just made this recipe and the pancakes were delicious!! Sweet and chewy with great texture. My 9 year old even ate hers without syrup! The only changes I made were subbing half the flour for whole wheat for some extra fiber, and I only had old fashioned oats, so I nuked them for an extra 30 seconds once I mixed them with the hot milk and I let them sit while mixing the rest of the ingredients. The one bad review probably came from someone who didn't follow the instructions I'm guessing. Don't hesitate on this one! I've tried adding oatmeal to pancake batter and it just didn't work out, so this was great!

I'm not a big pancake fan, so was pleased to see this different twist on regular flour pancakes.
Loved them!!!
The one thing I changed was that, after reading the reviews about oatmeal needing to sit and soak, I put the milk in microwave for one minute and then stirred in two packages of regular Quaker instant breakfast oatmeal and cooked for the second minute - this cooks the oatmeal and cuts down on the prep time.

Hubby and I enjoyed them a lot!  Made the recipe as noted - subbed eggs for egg beaters and used Almond milk. The oatmeal was not quick oats. I let them soak in the milk while putting together other ingredients so they soaked up the milk and softened. Then mixed all together. It turned out beautifully! Might choose real eggs next time to see if consistency is different. But either way - great pancakes!  Served with sliced bananas and REAL maple syrup! Yum!

I have made this recipe a number of times and they are our perfect pancake fix. My husband and children just can't get enough of them and even though I am usually more of a waffle gal, I could eat these all the time. I do like to make sure that the milk is really hot to soften the oatmeal correctly though so that the pancake comes out with the right texture.

I routinely add quick oats to pancakes. Sometimes, the oats will make the pancakes dry, so the idea of soaking the quick oats in hot milk seems like a good idea. My only problem was that I used extra large eggs and soy milk. This made th batter too wet and the pancakes a bit rubbery. I would suggest leaving out the egg in this case.

Good.  I doubled the recipe, added banana and dark chocolate chips (the banana had been sliced through the peel, stuffed with the chocolate chips, wrapped in foil and heated on the bbq -  many bananas on hand and looking for a way to use them up.

The recipe had too much liquid and I had to add 2/3 cups more flour.  The instructions could have been more step, by step specific. Kind of fussy and not at all quick. The pancakes tasted good not really light.. I added a half cup of chopped walnuts. 

Could have been better.

Hubby didn't want pancakes today, so I got to experiment with a new recipe. Tried this one because I had everything on hand, halved the recipe but otherwise made as listed. Really liked them! Was a quick recipe. The 3 pancakes turned out great and were plenty for me with some fruit.

I've made this recipe many times, it's a favorite for any cold, wintery morning. I make it with gluten free rolled oats. To make sure they soften up well, I mix the oats and the milk and heat both of them in the microwave. I always double the amount of Cinnamon and vanilla. Tastes best when the brown sugar scoops are heaped.

Pancakes are not our favorite breakfast food, but we wanted something different for a change and these seemed healthier because of the oatmeal.  We really enjoyed these with blueberries and maple syrup, only change was that I cooked them in canola oil instead of butter.  My hubby enjoyed a couple of his with peanut butter and syrup.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really wanted to love this recipe, but it was too runny for me. The flavor was nice, and I loved the inclusion of the oatmeal. But the batter was runny, even when I let it sit for 10 minutes, and they didn't rise like I hoped they would.

My picky toddler ate 4 of these without syrup! As per the other reviews I cut down the baking powder to 3/4tsp and doubled the cinnamon. I added a mashed banana to the egg and I left out the 1/4c of milk at the end, just added a splash to the egg. I also melted the butter in the oatmeal. I think next time I will substitute peanut butter for the butter. Overall, anything my kid will eat is a winner in my book, but I really liked them too!

Great, hearty pancake. Try Coconut milk in the last 1/4 cup for a nice flavor enhancement. Kids also appreciated mini chocolate chips & vanilla chips cooked in for an extra treat!

I make this recipe time after time. It tastes great, is a healthier alternative, and is easy to make. I use almond milk and organic unbleached flour as well as egg beaters to make it even healthier.

It's so-so - I cut down on the baking powder as others suggested (used 2/3 of the recommended amount), increased the cinnamon, slightly reduced the brown sugar and added choc chips.  Because of the cooking time of the oats, I won't call this recipe "quick" pancake ... there are quicker ways to make pancake batter.  Anyways,  the "batter" was super thick and doesn't spread on the griddle much at all, resulting in fairly thick pancakes that took a long time to cook (unless you use high heat - in which case the choc chips will burn).  I wasn't too fond of them but my kids ate them all up happily ... but I'll be trying a different pancake recipe next Sunday.

The pancakes seem good overall but the salt level was just too much for us, I had to redo the whole thing with out the salt. Otherwise it was good.

The used whole wheat flour instead. And instead of using 3 bowls I just added the butter to the already made oatmeal so it would melt in there then added the vanilla and egg to that. No need for more dishes. My son (7) loved it and I loved it!

These oatmeal pancakes were very nice and light! The batter had a good, thick consistency that was easy to cook without having it run all over. I used whole wheat flour and left out the cinnamon (personal preference). Make sure to use a baking powder that is aluminum free to prevent a metallic taste.

Nice change for pancakes. I loved the slight cinnamon flavor, however, my husband and 16 year old did not. When I asked if they'd like for me to make them again, they said yes, but minus the cinnamon next time.

I am gluten and dairy free so I substituted Gluten free oats, Pamela's flour and Trader Joe's Original Almond Milk. I topped with organic blueberries and maple syrup! Mmmmmmm very tasty.

Another Oatmeal Pancake I Thought.  Nope - this one is different.  Not dry or  unflavorful at all.   Followed the directions to the letter and Loved them!  My husband even commented on how 'delicious'  they were.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  :)

Perfect!  I doubled everything and added chocolate chips.  Next time I will soak the oats & milk overnight before microwaving them for a little more nutritional value.

The cook times were too long. On medium heat, 2.5min for first half, then 2min for second half is sufficient. Of course, cook the first one longer since the pan is still warming up.

These were just ok. Not much flavor to them, I think I'll add more cinnamon next time. But a great way to get oatmeal in my diet

I am more of a waffle girl and I usually don't like pancakes. However, my husband loves silver dollar pancakes. So I made him little ones, and a big as my face size one for me. We were both pleased with how tasty these were. Also added mini chocolate chips in the batter and fruit on top.
