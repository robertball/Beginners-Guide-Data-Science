Its sad this recipe isnt getting the credit it deserves. It was easy and my family is requesting it again for thanksgiving. I made the recipe as is but didnt make it into football shapes because I'm not that talented.

Made these for a Super Bowl party today and they were a big hit.  People not only loved the cute football shapes, but they enjoyed the peanut butter flavor too. I doubled the recipe and it worked well, but I do think that it needed a bit more cereal.  The regular Rice Krispie treat recipe calls for 6 cups of cereal for a single batch, not 4.  I ended up putting 9 cups of cereal into a double batch and it still wasn't quite enough.  I'll probably put in 10 next time.

These were delicious... it wasn't easy shaping them but I just sprayed my hands with Pam between each one. I never really got them as good as I wanted but the taste made up for it! The peanut butter was a great addition... if I find a good football shape mold I'll make these all the time.

These were so delicious and very easy to make! And I had fun making them! These chocolatey snacks are much better than regular rice krispies!

I didn't think I would like these, because I am not a fan of peanut butter--but I totally did! I brought them to a bar during football playoffs and they were a HUGE hit with everyone. SO easy to make as well. I am making them for a super bowl party, and I am going to try and figure out a way to make them more chocolaty (either chocolate chips or cocoa powder?). Oh also, I used this recipe for the frosting, and just squeezed it out of a ziplock bag that I had cut the corner off of.

I made these for an office "tailgate" party and they were quite the hit!  I used an oval cookie cutter to make the basic shape and pinched the ends so they would look like footballs.

They are super cute and work great for my tailgating party. I didn't add peanut butter and they still taste great. I used PAM on my hands and an ice cream scoop and that helped me. :]

Made these to take to Super Bowl 2011! A double batch made 40! Everyone, young and old loved them. I made the first batch as stated  and the second batch I put 2 oz. semi sweet bakers chocolate in with the butter and marshmallows. We liked the extra chocolate! Thank You so much!

Cute idea!  Though didn't care for the cocoa crispies/peanut butter in this recipe.  Next time I will try a traditional rice krispie treat recipe and add food color to the marshmallow mixture to achieve the brown color.  Making the football shapes is SUPER easy: cup your hands together with the mixture, massage and press - and voila!  It will come out in a football shape.  I put icing in a ziploc bag and cut a corner to dispense the frosting for the "stitches" on the football.

I just made these for the 2010 Superbowl with the help from my 10 yr. old son and niece. They are super simple.  I didn't have cocoa crispies but easily substituted the chocolate by adding 1/2 cup of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips to the marshmallow mix.

These are fabulous!  I have to hand it to the person that decorated these for the picture- they look much better than mine, but I'm the first to admit that I am far from an artist!  Will probably make these every year for the Superbowl!

I made these for a Superbowl party.  They won me the "Best Dish-Dessert" contest.  I agree the color was more peanut butter brown than chocolate brown.  But they tasted so good, no one minded.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Cupping my hands to shape them, I made 16 little footballs.  Once they were fully cooled, I added the icing on top.  Very cute.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Really easy to make.  Not the easiest thing to mold them into footballs (get a mold as someone suggested).  They do turn out more peanut buttery than chocolate.

I made these as written. I felt the Krispies-to-Peanut Butter ratio was a little off. They were very peanut buttery, and therefore the color wasn't dark brown either. The mixture also thickened faster than I could mix in the Krispies, and became a little hard to work with. Also, the recipe only yielded 8 three-inch footballs for me! I would like to try making this again, with a few adjustments. Less PB, more marshmallows. And definitely double or triple the recipe! Great tasting, great idea. Thanks!

A huge hit at the Super Bowl party. For the icing to stay on without melting, wait till the treats are completely cool. I used the Betty Crocker Cookie Icing bag instead of frosting. Great recipe!

YUM!  I made the treats, poured them into a shallow cookie sheet and let them cool. I used a football shaped cookie cutter to get the shape of the football (NOT talented enough to mold them) I used the extra and did mold one large center treat. I melted semi-sweet chocolate and iced the top of the treat. Just tried one and wow! YUM! The peanut butter makes these SO good! Will be making these again! Thanks! Next time I might throw in some chocolate chips!

Turned out really cute... I used the pointy side of plastic easter eggs (sprayed with spray oil)to help me shape the footballs after I squeezed them into oblong balls.  About 1/4 cup mix for each football.

Being from New Orleans, everyone I know was extremely excited about the Superbowl. Also being from N.O., we were also extremely excited about making Superbowl snacks, as down here, the food is just as important as the actual event. So as soon as I saw these, I knew that I had to make them for our party. Of course the cooking part was completely simple, as anyone who's ever made rice krispies treats knows. My ultimate advice for anyone making these: just before you settle down to shape them, take a big spoonful of the still hot cereal/marshmallow/peanut butter mix and enjoy. Really, having that hot, goopy spoonful is the ultimate reward for time well spent in the kitchen. Then, quickly throw the spoon in the sink or you'll eat the entire batch that way. The molding wasn't particularly easy and I found that I had to re-butter my hands for each individual football. If any spot wasn't buttered enough, the marshmallow would immediately stick to it and I'd have to go wash my hands and start over, which made things take too long and by the last 1/4 of the mixture, it had cooled enough to make it even more difficult to mold. The only other issue I had was that instead of regular canned frosting, the grocery-goer bought whipped canned frosting, which was nearly impossible to decorate with. Ultimately, they looked like an impressionist's version of footballs. However, they still tasted fantastic and I will definitely be making these again, though perhaps I'll skip the football shape.

I made these cookies for Super Bowl Sunday. My husband and children loved them. They turned out well. I think the recipe would be ok with regular Rice Krispies if you added a couple of tablespoons of cocoa to the marshmallow mixture before adding the Rice Krispies. 

My husband has requested the addition of peanut butter to regular Rice Krispie cookies since he tasted these.

A nice treat and I'm sure they will be requested at my house again for the next Super Bowl!!

Perfect!  Except I used a whole box of the cereal.  I made these for my company’s Tailgate party.  My first time making them and they were a HUGE hit!  I did shape them into footballs and piped on the white icing, they looked so cute.  They tasted even better, everyone complemented and even requested more.  I had to bring in another batch just for fun one week, shaped this one into a big heart (used my heart shaped cake pan for it).  I even had to give my boss the recipe because she loved them so much.  I’m so happy I found this secret treat.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for, and they came out great! I think the trick is to melt the marshmallows and put the peanut butter in and then the cereal as fast as possible. Once it starts to cool, it gets hard to mix together. So have all of your ingredients measured out ahead of time so you can just throw everything together.

These were a hit at my Superbowl party! Such a fun treat. I used Pam for Baking (butter) to spray on my hands and it was much easier to work with the treats and shape them. I would suggest using a thicker icing-the decorating gel they recommended was very runny didn't dry. Overall, they were tasty and fun!

Super easy recipe and very tasty! The hardest part was shaping into footballs- but after frosting the laces they looked as good as they tasted!
