This was certainly Fun in our mouths!! Wow-what a great idea for utilizing one of our staples, corn tortilla's-we call them our "cornies". I made some slight variations, I used 1 full pound of sausage, 7 "cornies" instead of 5, sub'd Jalepeno Jack cheese for Monterey, eliminated the whipping cream and cottage cheese and used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 2% milk. I didn't have any green chili's on hand, so I cut up 2 fresh jalepeno peppers and cooked them with the sausage, also added onions to that mixture. (Yum!) I decided to bake it directly in our 12" Cast Iron Skillet, and topped it with tomato slices and sliced green onions. More for the visual than anything. We loved the way it looked, I immediately snapped a picture of it! A dollop of sour cream with a splash of your favorite hot sauce, definitely to become a family favorite. Thanks for the great idea!

Wow, this was really good.  And it looked just like the picture.  I took another reviewers advice and used sour cream instead of cottage cheese.  And low fat milk instead of the whipping cream.  It came out just fine.  I also used plain ground pork instead of sausage because I couldn't find any at the store.  I served this with sour cream and diced tomatoes.  My husband and I loved it and will make again.

This was pretty tasty. The the tortilla crust added an interesting flavor, but was really hard to cut because the tortillas had become very crunchy during cooking for some reason. The quiche was pretty much destroyed after my efforts to cut it into slices. I am glad I put mine in a deep dish pie plate, it think it would have run over in a smaller pan. It also took longer than the specified time before the center was set in mine.

I had to use what I had on hand so I did make some changes, but it turned out fantastic. That's why I liked this recipe, you can make so many variations. I did use 7 tortillas instead of 5 and I sprayed the bottom of my glass pie plate with canola oil as well as each tortilla (just slightly). I used 4 slices of canadian bacon, diced. I sauteed 1/2 onion and 1/2 bell pepper in olive oil and then added the ham for a couple of minutes. I used 5 eggs instead of 6, ricotta cheese (2 tbsp.) instead of cottage cheese, half-n-half instead of cream, chipotle peppers (2-diced) instead of green chiles. I added a bit of cumin as well as chili powder. I put my round pie crust protector over the top to protect the edges of the tortillas. Mine only took 35min. to fully cook instead of 45. I let it rest for 10min. before cutting into it. I added a dollop of sour cream to each slice. My husband raved about it and I loved it too! This one is a keeper! Thanks for such a great recipe idea!

Loved it!!! I was expecting it to be difficult to cut, but it wasn't and the wedges held their shape beautifully. I did do things differently, only because I didn't have everything listed. This is my end result... I used soy chorizo. Sauteed it with diced onion and bell pepper. I had a left over baked potato, I sliced it thin and fried the slices quickly in a bit of oil, salt and pepper. (My tortillas were a bit old, dry so I heated them up in a bit of oil in a hot frying pan, to soften them). I thought this was a great idea actually, it really helped the tortillas to mold to the shape of the pie plate. Assembling the pie...  I laid in the tortillas to fit (I only needed 4), arranged the semi-fried, thin cut potatoe on top of the torts,but only on the bottom (first layer). Followed the rest of the directions. On top of the quiche I decoratively arranged thin slices of pickled jalepenos, and thinly sliced tomatoes alterating them. Came out looking beautiful. Put a little grated parmesan cheese and fresh chopped cilranto on top before serving. A dollap of sour cream and/or salsa too if you like. While we were devouring it and my husband saying I had to rate this 5 stars. We were really enjoying the cilranto flavor with it, thinking a lite cilranto sour cream sauce would be awesome on it. Fantastic. Absolutely will be doing this again. I husband is not a breakfast eater, and I am always trying to make him eat. He said today I could make this for him everyday for breakfast. What

This was great! I had never made quiche before, so I wasn't sure how well this would turn out. But It was fabulous. I used flour tortillas instead of corn, primarily because that's what I had, but I've also ruined somethings with corn tortillas. Instead of pork sausage, I threw in some turkey sausage, which worked great. Like some of the other reviewers, I used sourcream and milk. I also sauted onions and garlic with the sausage, and threw in some cumin. for some extra color, I chopped some red and yellow peppers and put them in after pouring the eggs in. I served it with sour cream and sliced avacado. This will definately be a repeat recipe. In fact, I think I'll make it for my family when I go home for thanksgiving (though not on thanksgiving as I'm still full from breakfast and it's 5:00 pm!) Great recipe, thanks!

My family really liked this. We did add extra chilies and more onion than the recipe called for. The only problem we had was the corn tortillas along the edges browned a lot faster and almost burnt before the quiche was done. We had to wrap them in aluminum foil.

We made this recipe this morning for brunch. I was looking for a recipe for a quiche that would also be ok for my mom to eat who has celiac disease. It was not only wonderful tasting to all of us but was so easy and effortless to make. I used the suggestions and changed to sour cream, and I used evaporated milk. I also added onions to the sausage, used smoked sweet paprika instead of chili powder (had run out), and added sun dried tomatoes to the top before baking. It was awesome. I love the crunch of the tortilla. Thank you!!!!

I had bought 2 dozen enormous organic eggs and I have been looking for savory dishes in which to use them. I found this and was very easy to make and turned out wonderfully. Although I did make changes...we're not big on pork so I replaced that with black beans, I also  took the advice of other reviewers and  replaces the  canned chilies with a 1/2 of a fresh one which I cooked with the onions (as another reviewer suggested)and I didn't have cottage cheese so I replaced that with sour cream. I also added a green bell pepper. Other than that everything else was observed. So, it's true my version strayed from the original quite a bit. But the eggs were there and the tortilla crust, which by the way we really liked. Thanks for the recipe.

Tortillas are great and easy twist to traditional pie crust. Used flour torts, reg. cottage cheese, plain ground pork, and only 5 eggs. Added queso blanco. Kids scraped away the chiles - stinkers! But the adults loved it. Hubby thought it was only for dinner - I called it Mexican pie. I ate it for all three meals of the day.

I think this recipe made up great by using individual tortillas and letting everyone have their own individual little quiche. Someone made the comment it was hard to cut and this solved that problem.  I  also beat the egg whites til stiff and then added them to the egg mixture to make it fluffier and light. I love recipes that help me use up the left over veggies I have left in the fridge for breakfast or brunch.

This is a great, simple base concept that you can deviate wildly from based on whatever's in your fridge, or whatever you feel like eating.  I used four eggs instead of six to make it more substantial and less eggy.  Used shredded chicken breast instead of sausage.   Folded the cooked chicken into a saute of onion, fresh jalapeno, garlic, and fresh corn.   Skipped the canned chiles.  Sour cream instead of cottage cheese.  Sliced tomatoes and olives on top.  A great simple, reliable recipe.   PS: Before slicing, I snipped the crunchy edges with scissors to mark where the slices are: as others have said, the edges get so crispy it's a little hard to cut without the entire enterprise falling apart.

We really liked this. I didn't realize I was out of green chilies, so I cup up a few nacho jalapenos. I only had Mexican (Raw) Chorizo, which I don't care for, but the hubster LOVES it. Added in a heap of raw garlic & cumin along with the chili powder. Didn't have cream, so I used skim milk. Used sharp cheddar & Queso Fresco. So in all, it was probably a different recipe, but we loved it, thanks!

Fantastic recipe! i only made small changes that others recommended (1/2 cup sour cream for the cottage cheese, added a little cumin to the egg mix). So delicious! My husband raved!! No problems at all cutting it, the tortillas soaked up some of the  liquid during cooking and it was a snap to get out of the pan. Had a little left over (i don't know how!) but just polished it off for lunch. I will be making this again and again!!

OK - I used a large cast iron skillet - probably more corn tortillas than called for and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  This is an awesome recipe.  The whole concept of corn tortillas on the bottom instead of pie crust!  Made it for Easter brunch - we loved it!!!!!!!!

This is my new favorite brunch recipe.  I made this two ways, one exactly per the recipe, the other I swapped out the pork sausage for chorizo.  Both were a huge hit, but the chorizo one was the favorite.  Side benefit that this is gluten free which can be difficult with brunch recipes.

Great easy recipe to make with left over sausage and corn tortillas. Fresh homemade salsa makes it even better and would be a wonderful breakfast recipe also. Only change I made was I used half and half instead of the whipping cream.

Big hit for Father's Day!  Served with toast and fresh fruit.  Super easy meal.  Made again 2 days later with the leftover cottage cheese and cream. (I bought one cup cartons.)  Delicious topped with salsa and sour cream!

This is a very good quiche if you're tired of the same old vegetable/spinach variety.  The Southwestern flavor was a nice change, especially with the green chilis and the corn tortilla crust. I did use half-n-half instead of whipping cream but I don't think it affected the taste at all. I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage because we like things a little spicy.  I would definitely make again. The only thing I would do differently next time is mix the chilis in with the beaten egg/cream mixture instead of layering them on top of the cheese.  I think it might look prettier and get the chilis mixed throughout better.  At first I was worried about the curds of cottage cheese you could see on the top, but it melts in the oven, and I'm sure it helps with the creamy texture.

So good.  I make this ahead and freeze for big holiday weekends.  I then put it in the fridge the night before to cook in the morning. It is easier to remove from smooth edged pans.

You can use anything for the meat--ground beef, quartered mushrooms, etc.  I love this one.  So easy to throw together.  I will say though, I used a thick pie pan and it took an extra 25 min to cook thoroughly.

I followed other reviewers and used flour tortillas, which was a mistake.  They were too hard to cut through.  The quiche itself was very good.  Next time I'll follow the recipe!

I love this recipe and have eaten it for every meal.  I make it without sausage and use tomatoes instead. I also use milk instead of cream, leave out the cottage cheese and add paprika and cumin.  The tortilla crust is fantastic and so easy to make.

We made this today for brunch.  It was very good.  We used turkey sausage and ricotta cheese because that was what we had on hand.  Great recipe.

To the previous reviewer it actually says "four" tortillas not flour.  The 4 tortillas go around the pie plate and one in the center (5th).

For something different for brunch, tried this recipe.  I had to cook an extra 10 minutes.  Followed recipe exactly except time.  Delicious!  Will make this again and again.

Love this recipe!  I use beef or pork chorizo instead of breakfast sausage for a little more flavor.  Also substitute fresh diced ancho chile for the canned green chile and add one bell peper (red or orange).  I've made this with both the shour cream substitute and as written with cottage cheese and both turned out delicious!

This is delicious.  I love it.  It was great for brunch, and I took the leftovers to work for lunch.  Yum! I did not have sausage, so I used bacon.  This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing it.

This is a great idea - using tortillas for the "crust".  I used 4 wheat flour tortillas, and it was great.  I read the reviews and came to the conclusion that I could "do whatever I wanted", and it would come out.  It did!  It was really good and also presented really well.

Really good! Even my kids ate it! I used evaporated milk instead of cream & sour cream in place of cottage cheese. I browned the sausage with chopped onion & minced garlic, and added about 1/2 tsp. salt & pepper to the egg mixture. I also added about 1/4 cup chopped up green onion to the egg mixture. I also added a little cumin too. I didn't have green chilies but I had green chili enchilada sauce so I added about 2/3 can of that & it tasted awesome! It cooked beautifully & smelled really good! I liked this recipe because I could modify it to what ingredients I had on hand. We ate it for dinner but it would be great for any meal!

Delish, but strange to eat for breakfast! I deviated from the recipe, so if that bothers you, stop reading now:) I used leftover taco meat(ground beef) in place of the sausage, no extra spices, & sour cream in place of the cottage cheese. I ended up using 1 less egg because it filled my deep dish pie to the max. It took about 20-25 extra minutes to cook, as the middle was still very soupy-I just covered the outside edges w/foil & it came out perfect!

Good recipe - not sure I really like the tortilla - kind of a weird texture. I would make again maybe with something different as the crust.

It's Gluten Free! I made this 2 days ahead for a family birthday brunch. Just warmed it in the oven while i waited for the egg casserole to set. The adults - and kids - loved it. Unfortunately, there were no leftovers.

Really good, however, was really hard to cut the crust.  Used fat-free 1/2&1/2 in place of some of the cream and had to use one extra tortilla to overlap.  Cooked extra time before center was set.

My mom made this, but she used 5~ 10" flour tortillas instead of the corn. It was awesome! She served it with Pico De Gallo (salsa) on the side. She baked it for 55 minutes at 325 degrees.I am going to make this.. but I think I am going to try using whole milk or half and half instead of whipping cream. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Easy and tasty recipe.  Personal additions or omissions are simple if you use your cooking sense.  I used chorizo and roasted hatch chiles on my first round and it was perfect.

This turned out well.  My husband and I liked it, and the kids thought it was pretty good.  They just kept asking if it shouldn't be for breakfast.  I'm not sure if I will make it again or not.

This is a great recipe!  We loved it.  I used 2% cheese and light sausage to lower the fat content a bit and it still turned out yummy.  I'll definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious. Being on the South Beach diet, I used 93/7 meat, and mostly monterey jack cheese and it turned out just as well. Loved it and I will make it again

I made this because I needed something for breakfast that was gluten free.  It was delicious and something different from the usual breakfast casseroles.  Not only did the person it was intended for enjoy it, but so did everybody else. I served it with sour cream and salsa on the side.  The only change I made was to add a couple extra eggs.  I do that with every breakfast egg casserole I make.  Great as a leftover too.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was excellent!!!  It was a great change from tacos or burritos.  My only alterations were I used fresh steamed jalapenos instead of green peppers, only had 5 eggs, and I really like cilantro so I mixed it in as well as used as a topping.

I love the "crust"! I thought that the tortillas might get lost and mushy in the recipe but they didn't, they just bulked up. I will definitely make this again but next time I'll add onions and some extra chili powder. Some tips to make it even healthier, I used 3/4 cup light cool whip instead of a half cup whipping cream and couldn't even taste the difference, I also used a stronger tasting jack cheese, reduced fat sausage and light cheddar.
