I'm really surprised this got so many good reviews!  I looked at the recipe and just didn't see where there would be much taste to the beef.  I was right.  I had added an envelope of Lipton Onion Soup mix and I doubled the amount of seasonings and the beef was *still* kind of bland.

Also, the carrots and potatoes were WAY too soft and the onions just disintegrated.  

I would suggest cooking the beef under pressure with one onion, for about 90% of the amount of time, releasing the pressure and then adding in the potatoes, carrots, and another sliced onion for the remaining time. That way the vegetables aren't mush.  I think two envelopes of the onion soup mix would lend this dish more flavor.

I was surprised at how good this turned out. I made only a few adjustments.  I used Italian seasoning, onion powder and fresh minced garlic (sauteed with the fresh onion). I also added 2 tbsp. of tomato paste. One other thing that I had seen in another recipe was to wrap the potatoes and the carrots in their own foil packets placed on top of the roast.  This did keep the vegetables from getting too mushy. Anyway, this recipe will be a keeper.

Delicious, easy pot roast recipe. Though I laughed a little at the garlic powder being optional- garlic is never optional for my family!

Followed recipe per instructions. Looked nice. Veggies were tender. Meat was dry and bland. Almost like it was overcooked. Not impressed with this one, and as such, probably will not use again.

This was a great pot roast! 
I am congenitally incapable of following a recipe faithfully. I came fairly close with this one, but  I added some Brazilian seasonings (Sabor do Nordeste),  more Worcestershire than called for, half a packet of dry onion soup mix, some mushrooms, and a stalk of celery.  I also diced some onion into the sauteing oil, just for the heck of it. 
I was a little worried when I opened it up and saw all the liquid in there. I was afraid that it would be as dry as my crockpot roasts. However, I fished it all out, set the pot to saute again, boiled up the liquid and whisked in some flour to make gravy. Best pot roast I have ever made.

I have tried to cook pot roast many times.  Each time it was a disaster.  I thought I would try it one more time since I LOVE my Instant Pot.  Bingo!  This recipe was a winner.  I made it exactly how the recipe stated and it was awesome.  Will definitely make it again.

Wonderful! The potatoes were especially delicious - the Instant Pot infuses the flavor into the potatoes.

I did not make any changes, except to reduce the ingredients to work with a 2 lb. cut of chuck roast. The potatoes wee a tad soft, but held their shape perfectly. It was very tasty and pretty darn easy to make!

I seared the roast in a pan instead of in the Pot, used Italian seasoning and 1/2 Madiera with beef broth. Easy, easy, easy. Meat was moist and tasty.

I made this with a 5 pound eye of round roast cut in half, no other changes. It had great flavor, but could have been a bit more tender. Could be it was too large of roast. I'd use this recipe again and perhaps go with 85 minutes vs 80.

This is my third attempt to do a pot roast in the instant pot, and my last. The pressure cooker isn’t the best place for something that needs to be slow cooked. ... Following the advice of some of the reviewers,  I doubled up on all the spices, used fresh rosemary and fresh garlic, I reduced the amount of liquid and included red wine.… Even with reducing the liquid, there was still too much liquid left at the end. Which I had to sauté for an extra 40 min to reduce. 

I used 3 1/2 pound roast,  cooked it on high pressure for 70 min, but the inside was still tough. I peeled off some of the meat that came off easy and then put the rest back in for another 30 minutes, it still wasn’t tender enough after that, so again had to cut parts of it and put it back in for longer, while sautéing the sauce to reduce it. 

I included the onions, and added extra, but I did not put it in with carrots and potatoes as I’ve made that mistake in the past… They don’t turn out well in the pressure cooker for that long. 

The flavour was delicious, but the texture, tenderness and richness of the beef wasn’t there. There is no substitution to slow cooking, which is what is needed. And at the end, after  all the corrections, it ended up taking just as much time.

I did not use the garlic powder but minced 2 cloves of garlic instead and did not use the paprika.  I used russet potatoes but would use the red potatoes next time as they are more creamy.  I also added fresh green beans and it was excellent.
Will definitely make this again .  It is a great recipe in the instant pot for a motorhome dinner.
