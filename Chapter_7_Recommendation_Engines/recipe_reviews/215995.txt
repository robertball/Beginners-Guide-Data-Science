I made these last year after I saw them on this site. The rice crispy treats are impossible to mold and shape. For that this recipe gets 1 star.

Fun to make with the kids!  I took out 8 heaping balls of the rice crispy treat on wax paper and let them cool off a little, then molded them into ghosts.  It ended-up working great!  Next, I let the kids decorate using a variety of candies into their own ghoulish treats.  YUM!

Marshmallows must be very fresh, or use unexpired marshmallow creme. I have a funnel that came as a game prize from a Tupperware party about 30+ years ago. It is just the right shape for the ghost. They are cute as can be when finished but don't keep well.

Princessxcooks--they didn't delete your review, they just added the same recipe under a different name. Last year's recipe (where I do see your review) was "Coconut Ghost Treats".     I agree with others that the "ghosts" are difficult to shape.

I made these last weekend.  Who would have thought coconut and Rice Krispies would be sooooo delicious together!?!  Ohhhh but they are!  MMM!!  For the eyes I just used orange and black gel.  Lol- as for making them WITH kids, they are messy enough with me alone making them, I would just say make them FOR the kids instead.  :)
