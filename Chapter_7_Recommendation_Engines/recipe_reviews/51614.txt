I thought it would be a bit thicker but overall it was a hit with the kids!

This is a great, easy recipe.  To make peanut butter fondue, we substituted peanut butter chips for butterscotch chips and served it with apples, bananas, marshmallows, and chocolate chip cookies.  It was a huge hit and tasted great!  We also saved the leftover portion and reheated it in the microwave a few days later.  It was just as good!

Delicious! It was still fluffy when I put it in the fondue pot, but as it sat over the heat, it darkened and the flavor got even better! 

I served this with granny smith apple chunks and chunks of pound cake.  It was a little too rich on the cake, but I have to say the apple-butterscotch flavor was wonderful!

Wow this was great.  Wonderful on bananas, apples and pretzels.  I substituted peanut butter chips per another reviewers suggestion.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I did notice that after it really heated up it thinned out (less milk next time?)
