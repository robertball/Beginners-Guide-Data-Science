YUM!!  We made these last night to ring in the new year and they were great!  Used pineapple orange juice to make for quicker mixing.  Beware, they sneak up on ya (my head feels like it weighs about 400 pounds).  Thanks Michelle ;)!!

Used this at a party and got rave reviews.  Easy to make a LARGE BATCH ALL AT ONCE.  Adapt recipe for 20 servings and add splashes of grenadine separately into ea glass.

I put half of the juice that was called for but kept everything else the same.  It was awesome this way.  Otherwise it would have been way too sweet for my husband and I.

This was okay, and does resemble a Mai Tai. Just not our personal preference with taste.

I reduced the orange juice to a splash, eliminated the grenadine and added fresh lime juice.  So good.

Yum! This recipe is easy and has uncomplicated ingredients. The Amaretto gives it a wonderful, creamy taste to go with the delicious fruit flavors. Perfect for brunch or warm weather sipping.

So good, make sure you get a DD if you are having these outside of your home because you won't be able to get enough of them.  I used Malibu (coconut bay would work too) in place of the dark rum.  It was wonderful!

Very good mai tai. We like ours a little less sweet and a bit stronger so I cut the juice in half. Great party drink!

My husband even loved this and he's not into mixed drinks.  I used freshly squeezed OJ and pineapple juice, which was a little expensive, but worth it.

I selected this recipe for a luau party we had prior to a trip to Hawaii.  Everyone loved it.  While in Hawaii, my wife commented several times that she liked this better than the ones we were getting there.  I originally selected it because I couldn't find orgeat which some of the recipes call for and we don't like the coconut flavors in some of them.

This is a great drink, almost perfect.  The only thing it was missing was the white rum, so I added it in equal amount to the dark rum, and it was *perfect*.  Thanks so much for this recipe, I've been looking for the right Mai Tai recipe, with stuff I had on hand (some of the older recipes call for all sorts of obscure liquers).  Thanks very much for this!!  I'd rate it like...4.8, because I had to add the white rum, so you got a 5.

Wow made a pitcher of these for a dinner parry with friends.  Big hit n easy too.  I did not use equal parts rum & amaretto as I don't like it so sweet. I did 1 1/2 oz rum to 1/2 oz amaretto.  Be careful its much stronger.  Add a chuck of pineapple with a cherry garnish and you're transported back on an island beach! Thanks Michelle

This was a big hit over Memorial Day weekend. The first round I made exactly by the recipe. Everyone thought the alcohol was a little weak, so for round two I adjust the OJ and Pineapple juice from 3oz each down to 2oz each. Home run.

Excellent!  We used spiced rum and loved the combination with the amaretto.  Great summer drink!
