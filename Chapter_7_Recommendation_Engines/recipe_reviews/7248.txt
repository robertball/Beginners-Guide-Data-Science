Unfortunately, I was really disappointed in this recipe. The cake was very dry and not at all flavorful.  I changed the icing recipe in hopes of saving the cake, but it really wasn't worth the effort.  The ratio of baking powder to flour seems very high, also.

The cake was great and easy to make. We didn't like the icing, though. Next time we're thinking of using cream cheese or chocolate frosting.

This cake would have been WAY too dry had I followed the recipe exactly. It did not even resemble cake batter until I added another egg and another cup of milk at the end. I also used chocolate frosting.

I didn't read the other reviews until after I had the cake in the oven, so I was a bit worried how it would turn out.  Luckily, it wasn't bad, aside from being a tad less moist than I like my cake.  I used skim milk and skipped the frosting alltogether, instead opting to dust the top of the finished cake with powdered sugar.

I found this cake very dry but had a good flavour.  If I make it again will add more milk to it.   When I  tried to poured the batter in the pan I had to scrape it out of the bowl just to get it into the pan.

It's moist and tasty, but just a little too sweet. Need to cut down on half portion of sugar.

I made the cake according to directions but the icing was missing something so I added 1/2 cup Peanut Butter and I received a lot of compliments from my family.  I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly.  This cake was very moist for me.  I used it to make cake balls.  Since it was so moist, I didn't need to add very much icing to form the balls.  I will use this recipe again.

Although the flavor was good, it was too dry and crumbled too much.

Good cake. I didn't love the frosting. I will make again but probably use chocolate frosting.
