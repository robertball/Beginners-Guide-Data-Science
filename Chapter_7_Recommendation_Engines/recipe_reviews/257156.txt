I'm giving this 4 stars because modification is absolutely needed! There are too few corn tortillas -I suggest no less than 12- the sauce had too much liquid, and at least one more egg is needed to stabilize the cottage cheese filling. It tasted good, but needs to be modified.

My husband really loved this.  There is a lot of liquid, and when I saw how much of the sauce there was I knew there was no way this was fitting in an 8 in. baking dish.  I made it in a deep 9x13 pan and it barely fit.  I did modify a bit:  used ricotta cheese instead of cottage so it was less watery; added 1 chopped jalapeño to the sauce for a little more flavor and a bit of spice; did not have tomatoes with cilantro and lime so juiced 1/2 lime and chopped some cilantro into the sauce; and definitely need more than 5 tortillas, especially since it needs to go into a bigger dish. It has very good flavor, but the tortillas actually kind of disintegrate so you don't really have layers at the end.

We made this for dinner tonight. It was delicious. Couldn’t find tomatoes with lime and cilantro so I cut up a little bit of cilantro and used 1 lime.  The flavor was exactly how we liked it. Will be adding it to our dinner schedule.

The whole family loved this! So good. I've actually never made enchiladas in  my life. I really love how I didn't have to roll them up with this one. Maybe the rolling is what always kept me away before, but not anymore.

This was an inspiration for me to make a vegetarian version. I used chopped cauliflower instead of meat.  I started with some enchilada sauce (I used a small can), then layered the tortillas, cauliflower, whole black beans, and finely grated mozzarella.  There were 2 layers like that with the top layer tortillas, the rest of the sauce and cheese.  All together 2 cups of cheese.
