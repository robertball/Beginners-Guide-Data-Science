These were not soft/chewy but hard and dry ! The dough was very easy to handle.

I have to wonder if people leaving negative reviews expected boiled pretzels.  The leathery, really chewy taste of pretzels is usually because the pretzels have been boiled before baking.  It is essentially the same process for bagels as it is for pretzels:  boil water and baking soda, and boil the pretzel for approximately 30 sec-1 min in the boiling water, then transfer to a baking sheet and bake as directed.  That will get you the chewiness a lot of us expect from pretzels.  These are a decent, basic pretzel that are so easy bc they are made in the bread machine.  You could also make these in the Kitchen Aid mixer as well.  I like the slicing part of this recipe--I didn't even bother rolling the slices and they baked up beautifully.  I didn't want to do an egg wash, so I used water and then broiled for about a minute to get a darker crust.  These are pretzels you want to serve with mustard or butter for dipping--as written, they are a bit bland.  Thanks for the recipe!

This makes wonderful pretzels with a great taste and texture.  They should be eaten fresh or they will get hard.

Lovely!  I used this recipe for my second-ever batch of pretzels, and they turned out perfectly.  They taste like store-bought pretzels, especially with the coarse salt.  Careful with the salt, though:  the pretzels are relatively small, so you don't need a lot of salt grains.

My family LOVES these pretzels...  But, I do change one thing...  only make half as many as the recipe says.  They are bigger and softer and chewier and mmmmmmm so good and hot.  A great tasty treat!

These were very easy to make, but I will experiment a bit to get a tougher crust (my preference).

I was dissapointed with this pretzle recipe due to the lask of flavor and softness. I love the big soft pretzles you get at the mall and these were not any where near close. If you prefer the taste of traditional hard pretzles then these are definitely for you though!!! They are some what chewy and the beer gives it an authentic taste.

These were super yummy and easy to make. I didn't have any beer on hand so I used some leftover wine and topped the rest of the cup off with water. Turned out great!

Pretty easy to make with the use of a bread maker.  We've made them twice so far, and they've turned out excellent both times.  Would recommend.

My family made this recipe along with the "Buttery Soft Pretzels" one evening to compare them side by side.  These pretzels were really good, but tasted more like the Pillsbury dinner rolls than pretzels.  I wonder if you dipped these in a baking soda wash and sprinkled with salt before baking if they would have more of a pretzel texture to them.  Regardless, they were good.

I followed the directions precisely and was somewhat disappointed.  Not phenomenal - pretty bland and hard.  Definitely no wow pretzel quality but a passable warm bread when served with butter.

I think this recipe is fantastic! I had a lot of fun making pretzels with my kids (ages 5 and 9) - they came up with some very creative shapes! I wouldn't change a thing - we even shared some with neighbors who were native Pennsylvanians and they raved about them!

Delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't have margarine, so I used 1 T. of CountryCrock spread. I used a pizza cutter to cut the dough into strips, which worked well. Also, I had a small piece of dough left (not long enough to make a pretzel-shape), so I made a sort of crossed-ribbon...kinda like the yellow military ribbons or the pink Breast Cancer ribbons. So, if you're doind a fundraiser or even for something like that, it works perfectly (see picture).

My little niece came over this afternoon. I was in the middle of baking bread. She was watching everything I did. While she watched, she asked if I had tasted Bread Pretzels. When I told her I tried them and I could even make them, her littles eyes got wide and she asked how. Boy was she enthralled with the process. Thanks, Nancy, for providing me with a way to my niece's heart!She thinks I'm AWESOME because I showed her how to make bread pretzels!

My husband and I loved these! On of the traditions we are starting is that on one of his days off for the week we will eat only appetizers. Monday we started the day with buffalo wings, and had these soft pretzels for dinner! We ate the entire batch, they are WONDERFUL!

Wow,  these pretzels are terrific!  My husband loves hot pretzels and I have been using a recipe that required boiling the dough before baking.  These pretzels are not only quicker but better!  

I too made my pretzels bigger so then they had to bake longer.  I also turned the oven up for the last two or three minutes to brown them a bit more.

Thanks for a great recipe.

These pretzels tasted good out of the oven but not later.  Not even a few hours later.  I also had trouble shaping them, but that's probably just me.

Crispy crust with the egg wash.  Nice flavor.  My bread machine can do a double batch (2 lb setting) and I can produce 36 at a time.  Good for Oktoberfest.  Start to finish for 36 was about 2 h, but only about 30 min actual work.

These were very good, crunchy outside and soft and chewy inside.  My flatmate and neighbour stole most of them.  I found they were especially good sprinkled with sesame seeds as well as the kosher salt.  Don't make these if you're on a diet, they're irresistable.  Oh, and don't feel you have to use a good beer, I use Tesco Value generic 2% volume lager and they still taste good.

This was a fun recipe.  I used half whole wheat flour to up the nutritional content, and I kneaded the dough by hand because I don't have a bread machine.  The dough was easy to handle and actually mixed fairly well by hand.  But, between the whole wheat dough and mixing by hand, the pretzels came out pretty dense.  Descent flavor and I ate it with a beer cheese dip.

If there was a no star, I would give them that.  I followed this recipe to a T.  I used a bread machine and I have won awards for my cooking.  These were mealy had a horrible flavor and were the worst pretzels ever.  Maybe I was expecting more as I am from Philly where pretzels are really good.

blech!  find another recipe!

This was my first time with making pretzels.. I was not quit with the program this am, I put in the egg & warm water, to late, BUT, it turned out very good, the one thing I did way wrong, was to put to much pretzel salt on them, I had to scrap alot off, & they are ok now, Live & Learn, I think I will try the caraway seeds next time. 
 But I am not disappointed at all.
    Have a great Day to everyone.

This was my first attempt at making pretzels. I followed the instructions; however, I did take the advice of other viewer.  I added the additional step of boiling the pretzels in water (8cups) and baking soda (1/2cup) prior to baking them in the oven. Oh!  Also, I added 1 Tbl of melted butter to the egg wash.  I baked for 18.5 minutes.  I enjoyed this recipe very much!  Thanks!

I found this recipe very easy and quite tasty, with one change: Boil the pretzels before baking. I followed the suggestions of other reviews, made the recipe to a T, then dropped the pretzels in boiling water + baking soda for about 30 seconds. They came out great! Moist, soft with a nice brown crust. The kids loved helping make the shapes and it was an easy and fun Sunday snack. Would do again!

The only change I made was boiling each pretzel in a
water/soda  bath for about 15 seconds, draining on a paper towel for a few seconds then baking.  They browned beautifully but  were rather bland. I will try this recipe again replacing the white sugar with  brown sugar to see if this helps the flavor.

This recipe came out of Black & Decker recipe booklet, one of the step are missing which I think helps with the texture.
Placing a pan of hot water on the lower rack below the pretzels well baking.  I have followed this step & also before putting the egg wash on I have put in a pot of hot water with baking soda. Without doing either step you are just making breadsticks
