Simple and delicious! I've made this many times. One day I had no almonds, so, instead I added 1/4 cup more of confectioners sugar (I also skip putting the dough in the fridge) and they still were great! So easy I can't believe it. Thanks for the recipe

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made them for my friends and they ate them in few minutes. This is an easy recipe that does not require tones of ingredients.
I like this version of the Mexican Wedding cakes because the ground almonds. I don't usually add the cinnamon. It just melts in the mouth. The best way to bake these cookies is at 275 degrees for 40 minutes.

My husband said "These are the best Mexican Wedding Cookies I've ever had". I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 vanilla extract and 1/2 almond extract. I don't know if they stay in a round ball if you refrigerate them but they were pretty with just a domed shape top when I cooked them right after mixing. Did discover they were better when I made them bite size. Cooking time was shorter since I didn't put them in the fridge first. I tried sifting the sugar on them but it didn't stick so I rolled them in powdered sugar once when hot then again when cooler as suggested in a previous review. I was confused by "knead in flour by hand until completely mixed" so I just mixed in flour with a wooden spoon until it was thick enough to put on counter and then kneaded(if thats a word?) the rest of the flour in. Oh, I dusted the counter top with powdered sugar so the dough wouldn't stick.

I have never used any other recipe for this cookie, everyone that's every tried these simply loves them. They come out perfect each and every time and I do not change anything about it EVER. Just like the ones my mom used to make when I was a kid. Thanks so much.

These cookies are fantastic, not bland at all! I'm baking them right now (my husband has already eaten 5 and said they are addictive) I have Martha Stewart's cookie cook book and she has almost the same version of Mexican Wedding cookies in it.  To make them more like she does toast the almonds in the oven first at 350 degrees f until slightly golden, it brings out the flavor of the almonds, reduce the flour to 2 cups and 2 tablespoons flour up the confectioners sugar to 1 cup and swap one of the teaspoons of vanilla for almond extract, I just rolled the dough into 1 1/2 inch balls straight from the bowl. These are also a great cookie just the way the recipe is written, don't forget altitude and climate affect your baking while more flour works for some, less might work better for others. Thank you DeAnn for the delicious recipe!

Great simple recipe especially for parties.  The only thing I changed was letting the cookies cool completely down on a rack and then sifting confectioner's sugar on top.  Will definitely use this again.

:( Taste and smells just like play-dough. I know these are suppose to be slightly bland in taste but these were just awful.... Kid n hubby gave a big frown :(
It's got to be all that flour? I had a hard time cooking them all the way thru no matter what size I made them.

Excellent and easy - I followed the directions as listed, kept the cookies small (about 3/4 to 1 inch) and then sifted the powdered sugar over the warm cookies for a perfect presentation.  One tip - I always line my cookie trays with parchment paper.  Took these to a Cinco de Mayo party and they were a hit with kids and adults alike!  I made the chocolate variation on this site, as well - both are keepers.

OMGoodness these are melt in your mouth wonderful! I omitted the cinnamon, did not sound good to me that day and substituted chopped pecans for the almonds because my husband is a huge pecan fan. cooked for about 15 minutes at 350 F. I can not imagine a better or richer cookie. Thank you DeAnn for sharing this recipe. It is going into my collection for perfect cookies.

These were good, a little to delicate though. They fell apart as you ate them. My family loved them, so I will make again next year.

I make these abit more indulgent by wrapping the dough around a chocolate kiss before baking.Then continuing on as normal and rolling them in the powdered sugar.

These were good. Sifting the dry ingredients might have helped a bit but I ended up with pretty crumbly dough. still was able to form into balls but not roll out. Good, delicate recipe.

I made these today and they were great. Did not change a thing. I also made thumbprint cookies with blackberry preserves with the dough. Thank you for the recipe.
