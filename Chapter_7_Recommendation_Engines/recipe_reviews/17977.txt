Delicious!  For those of you who are couting carbs (or just don't have any bread), it's also just as yummy if you simply roll the cheese, peppers and tapanade inside a slice of eggplant and eat it that way.

Very yummy recipe!  All the ingredients went together extremely well!  I placed the eggplant and peppers (on tin foil) on the outdoor grill and it made them tasty.  Also, I slightly browned the bread in a skillet with olive oil.  My husband and I both loved this recipe, definite keeper!!!

DEFINITE DO-OVER!!!  I had to make a few changes because I couldn't get some of the ingredients but it was FABULOUS!  Instead of a baguette I used a larger softer bakery bread which worked beautifully.  (I sometimes find the baguettes too hard anyway)  For the goat cheese I had to substitute feta which I mixed with a bit of plain yougurt to make it more spreadable.  Next I added a layer of thinly sliced salami to bump up the protein for my kids, put the tapenade on next... then the grilled veggies and last I put slices of gouda because with the little ones I knew the parmesan would be a disaster.  I also put it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  I know I changed the recipe a little, but nothing that comprimised it too much in my oppinion.  *ALSO* While the veggies were under the broiler, I started the tapenade in the food processor and it zipped together!  This was a great lunch for all of us!  (parents, 3yr. old & 1.5 yr. old)

I loved this!! I am trying new foods and new recipes and this one was amazing. I used eggplant, red and yellow peppers, zucchini and mushrooms...wonderful! Great for lunches the next day...just pop it in the microwave when you're ready and it's as good as fresh. Yum!

This sandwich is amazing!  I'm giving it a four only because I added some ingredients and it took me forever to find tapenade.  Like some other reviewers I had never heard of it before and wasn’t even sure if I was pronouncing it right, lol.  Your regular grocery store like S&S won't have it but Trader Joes or Whole Foods will.  Trader Joes had it in plastic containers in the refrigerated section in with the hummus, etc.  You can also find a few different jarred varieties as well at TJs.  If all else fails you can find recipes for it (with and without anchioves) on this site.  What I did first was salted and sweated baby eggplant slices for 30 mins in a colander and dapped with a paper towel to remove excess moisture and brushed very litely with olive oil.  I then sautéed some garlic in a small amount of olive oil and added the red peppers and onions.  Once they were tender I removed them and kept warm while I did the eggplant.  I only flipped them once but made sure the pan didn’t get too hot as to burn them.  I warmed goat cheese on the bread under the broil (on low) and then spread on the tapenade.  Then I layered grilled baby eggplant, red peppers and red onions.  I topped with provolone cheese and melted under the broil.  Finally I finished it all off with some fresh basil leaves.  By far the best sandwich I've ever made!  Don't let the ingredients scare you off!  The tapenade doesn’t overpower the sandwich so I would recommend at least spreading a tiny bit on.

This was delicious and different.  Thought the eggplant might taste bland, but the goat cheese really added flavor.  Couldn't find tapenade, so I used a small jar of olive pesto I found.  I also used goat cheese with roasted garlic and basil in it, used skinny Italian bread (scooped a little bread out of the middle), wrapped all in tinfoil and toasted it in the oven.  Great stuff!

This was really good and very easy to make.  I had a large eggplant and 1/2 seemed like plenty.  Although very good, the baguette is a little tough on the jaw so I think next time I'll make the sandwiches with pita bread.

Great recipe!  It was a nice change from the usual and very tasty.  I made it for a group of people by making it on one long loaf of french bread, and slicing it into smaller sandwiches.  It's great heated, but be careful add the goat cheese after it's been heated - it's so soft when warm it squishes out of the sides. :)

This was great!!  My whole family enjoyed it.  I substituted provalone slices for parmesean and grilled the veggies.  I couldn't find the tapenade locally, but I made my own olive spread.  We will definately have this again.  Makes a great light summer supper.

I love these flavors together! I made these for a get together with some girlfriends and received a lot of compliments. I grilled the eggplant and peppers. I brushed the bread with extra virgin olive oil and toasted them on the grill before assembling. Soooo good!

Boy this was delicious! I made it with eggplant, red pepper, and zucchini. I sprayed the veggies with a little PAM before broiling, but forgot to salt and pepper them. I liked that the veggies weren't oily, but next time I think I would brush them with a little olive oil, remember to salt and pepper them, and maybe add a few red pepper flakes. I put the whole sandwich together adding a little minced garlic along with the goat cheese and tapenade and then broiled it open faced for a minute or two to melt the parmesan and toast the bread. It tasted just like a sub from a restaurant or an Italian deli. You could also modify this recipe in a million ways to suit your taste.

The end result is very good and somehow earned me the reputation of being a gourmet cook.  It is a little complicated.  But I discovered tapenade and am eternally grateful.

I was really excited to try this recipe, as I have had eggplant sandwiches at the local coffee shop. Unfortunately, I didn't like the sanwiches very well. I didn't like the way the flavors went together, and the sandwiches seemed soggy (even after I toasted the bread.)

Great sandwich and I LOVE meat. You won't miss it with this one, however. I like using yellow peppers for color and add; slab of good tart/sweet tomatoe, some grilled onion and lettuce or chard.Also chiabatta buns are a good bread sub. Yumm-O!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and I give it 3 stars. I made it a second time and tossed the vegetables with olive oil and added red onion before putting them under the broiler. In my opinion, the oil and the onion are key!

I fried onions and bell peppers in a skillet. and did the same with the eggplant. I toasted whole wheat bread, spread mayonaise on both slices, layered hot eggplant, onions, and bell peppers. Sprinkled with grated carrot. it was amazingly delicious! Love the idea of eggplant sandwiches.

this recipe was incredible!! i added cream cheese on one side to balance the strong taste of the goat cheese. you could also leave the goat cheese off and substitute the cream cheese. i forgot the parm at the end but it didn't matter, it was awesome!!!

A great summer sandwich!  We used fresh tomato instead of the red peppers and melted mozzarella instead of the Parmesan and it was FABULOUS.  I think the Parmesan cheese would have gone along better than the mozzarella and will try that next time.

I made this with brown mustard instead of the tapenade and used an english muffin instead of the french baguette, but it was still amazingly delicious!  Eggplant is a new ingredient that I have started trying and I definitely enjoyed this recipe for it!

Absolutely delicious!  Just the kind of sandwich I adore.  The tapenade was easily found at a gourmet shop, and all the other ingredients were readily available.  Next time, I'm going to try some caramelized red onions with it.

Being a HUGE goat cheese fan, I thought I'd love these.  They were good, but not fantastic.  I also added grilled sweet onions.  I also ended up adding kalamata olives and sundried tomatoes, which helped kick it up a little, but they were still missing something.  I made 2 sandwiches with this recipe, and 2 using a mayo/garlic/lemon/feta sauce (aioli) in place of the goat cheese and olive tapenade, and the feta sandwich won hands down!

First words out of my mouth after taking my first bite- "YUM! This is like something you would get at a cafe!" Easy to make for a delicious and romantic dinner! I made a couple teensy changes - roasted a whole red and orange pepper then tossed with a little olive oil, and used an Asiago focaccia which I split then toasted under the broiler before spreading goat cheese and tapenade. Would be great with French baguette though! Only thing I'll change next time is omit salt during eggplant broiling (the tapenade had enough salt for my taste). A keeper!

I found this while looking for something else to do with my eggplant besides eggplant parmesan. This is now one of my favorite sandwiches. The tapenade is a must. Without it this is a very bland sandwich. I couldn't find it at first and tried something in it's place (can't remember what). Finally found the tapenade, and used the green olive version and made these again. All I can say is, Wow. The tapenade kicked it to another level. I grill my veggies on the outdoor grill to give it that extra flavor and grate the parmesan fresh. It's the perfect summer sandwich.

simple yet delicious!! I had no parmesan but found it didn't need it. I also drizzled a tiny bit of olive oil on top of the vegetables to make it less dry. YUM

I thought this recipe was terrible. I tried it because of all the great reviews but the tapenade and goat cheese had a strong taste and didnt compliment each other. I made another sandwich with eggplant, red peppers, lemon cilatro hummus and it tasted so much better. I will not make this recipe again.

This recipe is delicious.  However, my grocery store didn't carry tapenade so I got some greek olives that also had feta cheese cubes (from the deli) and some sweet red peppers and put those in the food processor.  I also used a goat cheese that had little red peppers in it.  It was delicious.  Next time I make it though I think I'll cook the eggplant and peppers with a little olive oil.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. Then I made it again (because it was so good) and I omitted the Parmesan cheese and added baby spinach, then I put it all on focaccia and baked it at 300 for 5 minutes to warm it up. Yummy! My new favorite sandwich.

This was such a nice change from the usual sandwich . . . I made a lot of substitutions and it was still excellent. I used toasted whole wheat bread, light spreadable cheese wedges (e.g. laughing cow) instead of goat cheese, and forgot to add the parm. I was out of tapenade so I just processed a teaspoon of capers with 10-12 black olives and used that. I even forgot the parmesan at the end, but enjoyed it anyway!

This was absolutely delicious!  I made a few changes though.  I added balsmic vinegar to the bottom half of the bread, so that it would soak in the bread and not run off the sides.  I then layered sundried tomatoes on top.  Instead of goat cheese, I used provolone on top of the sundried tomatoes.  The store didn't have tapenade so I used basil pesto, which I spread on the top half of the bread.  I then layered the hot eggplant and red peppers on top of the provolone.  It was great!!!

DELICIOUS!  My husband and I agreed to only eat meat once or twice a week - so I had to start finding recipes that would satisfy my creativity as a cook and and satisfy our hunger.  Instead of tapenade I used the Black Olive Spread recipe from this site.  I also used mini loafs french loaves instead of a baguette.  

Although I used goat cheese and liked it - If you don't happen to have goat cheese, or you don't like the taste of it - you can also consider substituting it for cream cheese.  They have a similar consistancy and texture.  

Definitely worth 5 stars!  I will be making this regularly.

I really liked this sandwich. I don't like olives so I didn't use the tapenade. Instead of goat cheese I used Provolone. During the last 5 mins of cooking, I added the bread with Provolone on the baking sheet. This is a good change from roast beef! 
Edit: I made it the proper way this past weekend for me & my husband. I managed to find eggplant tapenade in Whole Foods Market, which is good since I'm not such a fan of olives. I also used basil & garlic flavored goat cheese. I always put this in my reviews- grate your own Parmesean, it is so much better than Kraft. We made 2 sandwhiches on foccacia & 2 on french bread. I wrapped the 2 extra sandwhiches in foil & the next day, all I had to do was unwrap it, put it on a plate & heat it up  in the microwave. These were very good, I'm glad I made them 'properly' this time instead of my previous shortcut. These tasted like they came from a gourmet store. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were amazing sandwiches.  Really amazing sandwiches.  I don't think i've ever received better feedback on something i've cooked; the bread was a nice, basic counter to the saltiness of the tapenade, and the tang from the cheese added that final zing.  Great recipe; we'll definitely use it again!

This is an excellent recipe.  I was fortunate to have been at the bakery upon the shelving of freshly baked French baguette, so the crust was the perfect texture.  A black olive tapenade works nicely with the goat cheese (I opted for plain goat cheese as opposed to flavored), and the fusion of these flavors is successful with the roasted eggplant and red pepper.  However, for those individuals who are vegetarian and want to prepare this recipe:  have caution when selecting tapenade, as some recipes include anchovies.  I had to do a bit of searching to find a black olive tapenade that was purely vegetarian.

So good.  Here's what I did.  I salted the eggplant to remove the bitterness.  (See other review about how to do it).  I lightly oiled the slices of green pepper (that I had) and rinsed eggplant.  I sea salted, peppered, onion powder, and garlic powder to taste and broiled at 450 until brown and tender.

I made a mixture of reduced fat mayo (with olive oil), black olives, sea salt, cracked pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, about 1/4 tsp of chopped garlic, some fresh sage,  and fresh marjoram (from the garden), and mixed it in my Magic Bullet.

I toasted the bread (little soft hoagies).  I put the mayo mixture on the bread then turkey pepperoni, the eggplant, green peppers, Swiss cheese, and a white cheddar.  It was sooooo good!

Modified quite a bit... wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla vs bread. Used mushrooms instead of eggplant. Also added zucchini & onions. Sated all veggies vs grilling. Blended 2 ozs feta with about 1.5 TBSP of yogurt for spread. Also, used added finely chopped olives with a touch of garlic. David & I both thought the wrap was superb.

Absolutely awesome sandwich recipe! Although I'm sure it tastes delicious as is, I think it also makes a great base for experimenting.   As per another person's suggestion, I spread goat cheese on one side and cream cheese on the other. I couldn't find tapenade so I made a mixture of olive oil, minced garlic, cayenne and italian seasoning and spread that on instead. I lightly drizzled the vegetables with olive oil and seasoned with salt, pepper and cayenne.   The end result was awesome and flavorful. Next time I think I'd toast the bread or get focaccia bread like another suggestion. Either way it was fun to make and easy to adjust to my tastes.

This was the bomb. I used my own home made bread and subbed gruyere for the parmesan, which I felt gave it a little more bite. FANTASTIC.

What a wonderful vegetarian sandwich!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.  I slathered goat cheese flavored with garlic and basil on one side of the baguette.  The olive tapenade was spread on the other piece of bread.  Go heavy on these two condiments.  We ate ours hot but I'm sure these would be great cold the next day.  The next time I make these, I'm going to double the veggies just so I can make next-day sandwiches.

i always steal recipes, but never leave reviews...until now.  since we made these sandwiches, we have become regular eggplant eaters!  sundried tomatoes put this dish over the top.  i've tried the whole ones in oil and more recently, sundried tomato paste on the bread...yummy!  thank you for the excellent recipe.

Perfection!  I did do a couple small changes... The store I went to was out of tapenade and I was in a fix for time, so what I ended up doing was purchasing some olive bread to replace the tapenade for the olive tase.  I also purchased some basil pesto and a jar of sundried tomatoes, and put them on the sandwhich.  After assembling the sandwhich, I also drizzled with balsalmic vinegar and oil.  Soooo yummy!!! Would definitely make this one again!

Great taste but we didn't use the olive spread and we would possibly do this as a wrap next time. Depending on the thickness of the bread you may find that a baguette or french bread is too much bread for this sandwich. You could also double the recipe so that there is a better bread to filling ratio.  Very yummy otherwise.

I added portabella mushroom caps that I sliced up. After I took the veggies out of the oven I put them in a plastic container, sprinkled olive oil and balsamic vinegar on them and tossed them. I also used rye bread I had instead of a baguette. The goat cheese I got was the crumbles and not spreadable. I should have gotten spreadable. Otherwise, it was really good.

i have to preface by saying i used green pepper and feta; i can imagine the difference with red pepper and goat cheese. either way, this was nothing special for me. the best thing about it was probably the olive spread, which i had never used before but i'm sure i will now. if you make this, you may want to peel the eggplant before slicing and season with some olive oil and basalmic vinegar, or something to enhance the flavor of the eggplant. it also seems sort of overkill to use goat cheese (or feta for that matter) and parmasean. if you want to make a great veggie sandwich, i recommend the portabello sandwiches from this site. i wanted to love these -- sorry.

Very good!  I used Alouette garlic and herb cheese spread in place of the goat cheese, and Black Olive Spread from this website instead of the tapenade.  Will definitely make again!

WOW!  This was excellent--although I did tweak it a LITTLE:  I used ciabatta bread, cut in half and spread with an olive feta tapenade, used green pepper instead of red and topped the sandwich with shredded Colby Jack, then warmed the whole thing in the oven until the cheese melted.  My boyfriend raved.  This sandwich has a very gourmet feel to it and is so simple to make!  Very filling also; great served with a side salad.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

We loved the sandwiches. I thought they would be dry with no mayo, but the tapanade and cheese combined worked.  Peeling, slicing, grilling etc. took it out of the exceedingly easy category for me. But it was well worth the effort.  Oh, we heated the bread and ate the sandwhiches hot - yummm

I couldn't find tapenade....used basil pesto instead...it was yummy, but not something I'd eat on a regular basis. The husband didn't really care for this one.

I love this recipe!  It was very easy to make, and I had enough left for lunch for a couple days.  The goat cheese and tapenade together are incredible!  I made my own tapenade from scratch.

I think this would have tasted the same regardless of vegetables because all I tasted was the goat cheese. Overall, I think it was more effort than it was worth. I did toast the bread, which helped, but I would put more tapenade next time for more flavor. The grated Parmesan was a step that went unnoticed, so you could probably leave it out and it wouldn’t make a difference.

One of the best ways I have found to eat grilled eggplant.  The sandwich was fabulous!!!   Packed with tons of flavor,  the goat cheese is just the right  balance to all the other ingredients.  

My husband is a meat lover,  he loved this so much he wanted again the next day.

Very good. We also found that we didn't miss the meat-like slot of reviewers! I had mine with lettuce/spinach but family had it on a parm bread from Panera, dry toasted. I salted it& left it the eggplant slices in a colander for 39 min first.  Like another review suggested, I mixed my low fat feta with some yogurt to make it spreadable. I had no tapenade so I improvised by adding capers to the feta spread. Also, I subbed Asuago for the Parmesan. That was as close to the recipe as I could get thus time. Definitely making this again for more family!

We enjoyed this very much.  We sweated the eggplant first, and added a bit of olive oil to the veggies before roasting. Used a bit more of the tapenade than the recipe called for, and a bit less cheese--and we used feta instead of goat since we had it on hand.  We'll happily add this to our "light dinners" rotation.

i used frozen breaded eggplant that you pick up at sam's club, cooked it and cut it in 2 inch pieces, used "Boursin" garlic and herb cheese on top of a baguette that was sliced and toasted with olive oil.  delicious appetizer and the best part the eggplant can be cooked ahead of time. really delicious and a lifesaver when you have a lot of appetizers to make.

This was a great recipe. A couple of suggestions.

1.) Make your own tapenade. It is easy to do and will be that much fresher.
2.) Cut the eggplant into 1/2 inch thick slices, lay out on a plate, and sprinkle with kosher salt. Flip and do the other side. Let sit for 30 min. Dab off the sweated moisture with a paper towel, sprinkle with a bit more kosher salt, and let sit for another 30 min. Rinse with cold water and completely dry with paper towel(s). Cut up into slices and bake, or leave as large slices and grill.

This was so yummy. My hubby and I are new to eggplant, but got a lot in our CSA this week so trying it out. I salted and pressed the eggplant for about two hours, then rinsed and baked. It was good, not bitter at all. I would say however that you need to make sure to oil the cookie sheet -- the eggplant stuck pretty good making it not very pretty. But it was covered in the sandwich anyway.  I roasted peppers from our CSA as well for this, but couldn't find tapanade at the store, so just used a spicy red pepper mustard that tasted great with it. Delicious. Served it with roasted green beans. Great meal. My hubby said he would have been happy having it been served as a meal in a restaurant, which I think is a big compliment from him!

This sandwich is delicious and so easy to make. It was way  better than I even thought it would be. I made my own tapenade, just using what I had: lemon juice, salt, pepper, olive oil, garlic, and thyme. This sandwich is great because it is so versatile, and great make to have on hand in the fridge, for lunch, snacks or whatever.

I liked this a lot.  I used an herbed goat cheese and multi-grain french bread and thought the extra textures really complimented this.  Also, I did not not include parmesan on mine.

This is a great recipe, a different option for yummy sandwiches, but if you want to make it trully vegetarian, you can substitute the goat chesse for soft tofu.

Perfect for a picnic! I like to dip the eggplant slices in italian bread crumbs and bake. Also, add spinach for even better nutrition.

Of course, with every recipe you switch it around to make it fit your palate.  I did just this but it's five-stars for posting the idea!  1) Salt your eggplant slices to pull out the bitterness.  Rinse before cooking.  2) Brush the eggplant and peppers with olive oil and then sprinkle with black pepper and garlic powder.  3)I followed another reviewer's suggestion and mixed feta with a touch of plain Greek yogurt to make it spreadable.  Thank you for posting this!

Holy cow these are AWESOME!!  My husband and I were looking for a light easy supper to make and tried these.  INCREDIBLE!  I took another reviewer's recommendation and included red onions and garlic while baking.  I'm making these again tonight and tonight we'll make our own roasted red peppers and add it to the sandwich.  INCREDIBLE!  The mix of cheese and tapenade is great.  Very hearty sandwich.  Thank you for posting!

one of my favorites! i make it for all my friends and even non-vegetarians love it!  i would agree that it comes out soggy so i decrease the amount of oil i use without burning the veggies.

This was a great idea but I went a little further and added a few other roasted veggies like garlic (a lot of garlic, I love it) , red onion, and hot pepper, yum!!  Made my own olive tapenade with a little balsamic vinegar in it, and and threw in some fresh herbs too. So delicious!!!!

This recipe was great for our weekly vegetarian night.  Instead of tapenade (since I hate olives) we used half-homemade basil pesto.  Be careful of the size of eggplant you buy - we had enough from one eggplant to make two baguettes worth.  I also felt silly since I have only cooked unseeded eggplants before and actually have no idea how to seed an eggplant.  Thanks for submitting the recipe, and we will make it again!

Wow. Wow. Wow. The best sandwhich ever. I have made them as the recipe dictates, and they are wonderful. I have also added zukes, summer squash, red onion, green pepper and mushrooms (baked along with the eggplant) for a "garden" version. Great way to use up veggies that are hanging around.  Agree with previous reviewer - pop the viggies in a covered bowl, and toss with a little balsamic. I have made a whole baguette before, and taken it to a party as an appetizer, cut into mini-portions. Lots of flavors going on - a very sophisticated sandwich.

These are my favorite sandwiches to make. They are great cold but wonderful hot like a panini. When I make it hot I omit the olive. Rustic Italian breads like ciabatta and pugliese are great when you can find them.

This was a good, quick sandwich.  I couldn't find ready-made tapenade and didn't feel like making it, so I just spread chopped black olives over the goat cheese.  The second time I had the sandwich, I toasted the bread under the broiler, too.  I prefer the bread toasted, but it's good either way.

I made this at a vegetarian friend's house for a potluck dinner. It was a big hit, and so simple to make (even in an unfamiliar kitchen). I was lucky enough to find a goat cheese tapenade, which cut down on the ingredient list, and I used focaccia instead of the baguette. It turned out so well that I also find myself craving it now and again.

The first time I made this I didn't have eggplant so substituted zucchini.  Since then I've used eggplant and actually prefer the zucchini-but I like it better than eggplant anyway.  Also, I didn't measure anything-spread the cheese and tapenade on the bread, layered on the vegetables and sprinkled cheese til it looks good.  Easy, fast, and cheaper than a restaurant.

Very good sandwich. I made it with focaccia and wrapped it in tinfoil and toasted in the oven as other reviewer suggested. it was different and delicious. Thanks for sharing!

This was very impressive.  I was skeptical of how much I would like it, and my boyfriend didn't like a raw piece of eggplant I gave him.  However, the flavor combo of this, wow.  Great sandwich!  I used the "black olive spread" also featured on the site.

Very good but we had to make alterations from the very beginning. We didn't have tapenade or goat cheese. So we went without the tapenade and used Muenster and Swiss instead. After we put everthing together, we put them under the broiler to let the cheese melt. Thanks for the recipe!

For one I couldn't find goat cheese.  Looking at the list it first says to chop the peppers, which I did, only to say later to slice them.  I don't think the cheese would have made much difference, it was almost tastless and it took forever to make two sandwiches.

This recipe was great, especially after a long day of work!!!  It was easy and quick to make.  One sandwich was filling
and satisfying.
