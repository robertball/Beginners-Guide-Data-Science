I made these exactly according to the recipe, and while I enjoyed the taste, I found them to be so dry!  We had to use so much syrup to enjoy them that I'm pretty sure it cancelled out the healthy benefits of the pancakes!  Since we enjoyed the taste, I think I'll try making them again (with a couple of changes to attempt getting a more moist result.)  If that doesn't work out, I'll probably try another recipe the next time.     **Update: I tried these again replacing the 1/4 c. oil with 1/2 c. applesauce, used 2 eggs and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla, and liked them MUCH better - moist and yummy!

My husband loves IHOP's Harvest Grain 'N' Nut pancakes, so I decided to give these a whirl for Father's Day.  They were a big hit, and I loved them too!  I made the recipe exactly as posted, except for having to make a substitution for buttermilk (lemon juice in milk), and it was fabulous!  The pancakes were moist, hearty, and tasty!  I served them with butter pecan syrup (you can buy an extract from Watkins or a similar company), and the whole family just loved it.  My husband also likes to top his with sliced bananas, which is a yummy option.  Just a note:  some reviewers seemed to have trouble with the amount of liquid in the recipe.  I'm in Utah, where the climate's pretty dry, and my batter turned out thick.  We're also at a higher altitude, but I don't know if that makes any difference in this particular instance.  Because these recipes are submitted from all over the country, where climates and altitudes vary greatly, the recipes on this site may not turn out exactly as you expect.  Adjustments may need to be made.  Enjoy this recipe!!

I have been making pancakes similair to these for years and they are a wonderful and a delicious alternative to sugar-laden breakfast cereals. This recipe is also open to some wonderful flavour boosters such as cinnimon,vanilla extract and two tablespoons of frozen orange juice concentrate which compliments the whole wheat. The addition of about 1/2 cup of bran and wheat germ ensures an excellent and healthy breakfast!!  A good idea though, is to use two rather than one egg which ensures a less dry pancake.

I love this recipe and have made it twice for family on weekend mornings.  However, I subsituted plain fat free yogurt for the buttermilk, applesauce for the oil, and splenda for the sugar and they still were fantastic!  This will be a family favorite.  Thanks!

I have been making pancakes for my little ones for a long time and this is the best recipe by far!  Some changes for our taste:  Subbed applesauce for oil, cut buttermilk to 1 1/4 cup and milk to 1/2 cup and cut the sugar in half.  I also added wheat germ and brewer's yeast for nutrition.  They came out so fluffy and moist!  The batter was almost like muffin batter (we like our pancakes thick!).  finally, we dropped frozen blueberries onto the pancakes once we laddled them in the pan (got this tip from a friend and it makes for much better pancakes then if you just mix the blueberries in the batter.

Great-tasting pancakes.  Pay attention to the review left on 4/27/2005 by the AUTHOR of the recipe- use 1.5 cups oats and 1.5 cups flour!   I used mostly whole-wheat pastry flour.  I just now noticed that I totally forgot the veggie oil, and they still turned out great!  Even with the additional flour and oats, the batter was really thin, so I added 3 heaping TBS whole wheat flour.  I also added another egg, like some other reviewers.  Next time I would add more nuts, as I would have liked more.

These were great, taste like something from an upscale restaurant.  I tried this with walnuts and pecans.  The walnuts were better.  Also added flax seed.  The batter is thick. I would make the pancakes small, easier to turn and they are cooked through.  The bigger cakes were doughy in the middle.

TIP-Sift and mix well the dry ingredients before adding the wet, as that will distribute salt and baking soda throughout the mix. These pancakes are going to be more dense/moist than white flour counterparts, but are much more healthy. This is a good base for adding fruits, spices or nuts! A very hearty breakfast pancake!

Wow! Sooo good - I'm just making up a second batch now because my family ate out the freezer stash.  They were a little sweet for my tastes - I drop down to 3 Tbsp sugar.  Thank you so much!  I'm sure this will be a staple with us :)

The original recipe yield is off on this one. Cut it in half if you want the original yield of 12 (good size) pancakes, otherwise you will have twice as much as you need. Or make the full batch and freeze the extras for a convenient weekday breakfast. Some reviewers found the batter thin - it is. But as the recipe directs, make your batter and then heat up your griddle. By the time it's hot, the batter will have thickened up - the wheat and oat flours need time to absorb liquid. My review is for this recipe as written, save for cutting it in half. The pancakes were very sweet, without quite the flavor I would have expected, given the amount of salt and sugar. They are moist, as promised. I might make these again, substituting some roasted flaxmeal for part of the flour, for a truly nutty taste, but I'm not crazy about the amount of oil, sugar and salt in this recipe, given the lack of a difference (in my opinion) they make here.

This is the best whole grain pancake recipe I've ever made!  I loved them.  I made them the night before (you can do so by mixing in all ingredients but the B. Soda, that should be added right before cooking) and like others found them thick, but I think the over night sitting made them thicker, so I added another egg and some more milk and they were fabulous.  While cooking I dropped in Banana slices and omitted the nuts because I was making them for 8 of my nieces and nephews (all under age 10) while we were all visiting my folks.  They were a big hit with kids and parents alike!  I will definitely make these again.

I followed previous reviewers' advice and doubled the egg, used applesauce instead of oil, and lemon juice and 2% milk in place of buttermilk. Also added cinnamon and vanilla. Much healthier and so yummy!!! Also I didn't grind down the oatmeal. Still came out fine.

So yummy.  I could eat them w/o syrup, coming from someone who sees pancakes as a syrup delivery mechanism.

These are delicious and healthy.  I love that no white flour is involved, but they aren't heavy or heavy-tasting.  A great way to please your kids without sacrificing nutrition.  I did add an extra egg and applesauce instead of oil, plus some vanilla and chinese 5 spice powder for flavor.

Oh yum! My favorite thing to get at IHOP is the Harvest Grain and Nut pancakes but we don't go there often and I miss the pancakes. These were better. I added some extra egg since I had to change the recipe yield to 8 and it called for 1 1/4 egg. So I just used 2, also added some vanilla. My husband and kids also loved these. Hubby says they are "Awesome!" I'll be making these again.

My family loves these pancakes. I have even used stone ground oatmeal and let it soak a few minutes in the buttermilk to soften. I also add cinnamon. Very good.

Fantastic recipe. Like other reviewers, I used 2 eggs instead of 1 and substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil. I also added chopped pecans & a tsp of cinnamon. Topped the pancakes with sliced bananas and warm maple syrup. The end result: YUM!

I made these this morning and substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and honey for the sugar and had no problems with flavor or dryness. Other tasty add-ins are raisins, craisins, dried blueberries, chopped figs, etc.

Amazing! I only added 1/4 cup sugar, and it was great. Next time I will try substituting applesauce for the oil and stevia for the sugar to make this recipe completely healthy. I'm sure the applesauce will be great, but I'm curious to see how the stevia tastes in this recipe.

These pancakes are great!  They are very hearty, but not heavy.  We liked it better with some roasted almonds and walnuts (any nuts) blended up with the oatmeal: that way the nutty flavor is in every bite.  I also sprinkle on some blueberries for added nutrition and flavor- but the pancakes are just as good without them.    I definitely recommend this recipe over any other whole-wheat or whole-grain pancake recipe I have tried.

Absolutely the BEST pancakes ever - moist, tender, yummo.  I will never make plain pancakes again.  These were just like the IHOP version.  The only things I did differently was used 2 eggs according to other suggestions.  I used 1 c. whole wheat and 1/2 c. white flour because I didn't have enough whole wheat.  And I used powdered buttermilk made according to pkg. directions to = 1 1/2 c.

These were delicious!  These are my favorites when I eat at IHOP.  I actually did take out some of the oil, using 2 T oil and 3 T unsweetened applesauce in place of the 1/4 cup. They remained very moist and light.  I also toasted the nuts before adding to the batter.

We have pancakes every Wednesday morning, and I don't think I have made the same kind in over a year.  These were one of our favorites and have gone into the keep pile (if I ever stop looking for a new recipe each week).

This has become a Sunday tradition at our house.  They are wonderful as is, but I've also experimented some with the recipe.  I don't grind the oats.  The "old fashioned" (not even quick cook) are fine whole.  If the batter sits for maybe 5 minutes, the liquid absorbs better.  I also add an extra egg as suggested by other reviews.  I usually don't have buttermilk, so add skim or 2%.  Cinnamon and blueberries are a wonderful addition.  The batter handles ground flax seed & wheat germ well too.  We eat topped with honey.  We've started making a double batch to have a few for weekday mornings.  Enjoy!

I made these today for my family and we all liked them! Even my picky eaters thought they were good - score! I made a few adjustments for health reasons, but the base recipe is still great. I used 1/2 c. flax meal in place of 1/2 c. whole wheat flour. I omitted the oil and sugar altogether and used 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce instead. And I also used 2 egg whites in place of the egg. Finally, like others, I added 1 tsp. each cinnamon and vanilla. The result was a moderate batter (thicker toward the end of the bowl - keep stirring each time you ladel out batter!) that cooked up evenly and moist, not overly sweet. They were great topped with applesauce or syrup. Thanks for this great recipe!

O.M.G.!! My new favorite pancake recipe. These are excellant and do taste like the famous ones. Using a very full 1/3 c. pour I got 14 pancakes. The only thing I did different was to run 1/2 c. of walnuts through the food processor and processed them into fine pieces and added them to the dry ingredients. Pecans would be excellant too. I cooled the leftovers on a rack and when completely cooled I wrapped and froze. Easy to reheat in the microwave. Follow the recipe and instructions and you shouldn't be disappointed.

Love these, family loves them, friends love them. They are especially good with fresh fruit syrup. We have not made any other pancakes since finding this recipe. I spread a little PB and Jam on the leftovers for a sandwhichs the next day. Have not had anyone not like them yet. What a great alternative to regular pancakes. I did cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and you can't tell. Thinking about cutting out a bit more sugar. Highly recommend to at least try.

I wasn't sure how the kids would like this recipe with it be so healthy and all...but the really enjoyed it.  I even made it for my weekly coffee get together and it was a huge hit with the ladies.  I used maple praline syrup (sugar free) and added bananas to the top.  These are even great made the night before and reheated the next day.  Just add a little cup of water to the microwave when heating up to keep the pancakes moist.

We used some of the changes suggested by reviewer Mommy, and it was great. We subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for the 1/4 cup oil, and used 2 eggs instead of one. I might knock back the amount of applesauce just slightly, but it was still great. My husband said this would be great with bananas in it.

These are a week-end favorite in our household.  My son even like's them without any additional toppings. Recently I found myself without buttermilk. I remembered that my mother would subsitute 1 cup butter milk with just shy of one cup milk plus 1 TBSP. white vinegar.  Let the milk and vinegar sit for 5 minutes before adding to dry ingredients.  I used just under two cups milk plus two TBSP. of white vineagar for 6 servings.  No additional milk was needed.  I found this batter actually better in consistency than the orginal recipe that called for buttermilk.  Also, there was no discernable difference in taste between the two methods.  Now I don't have make sure we have buttermilk in the house to make these goodies!

I've been making this recipe for about a year and they are definitely a favorite for my family of 6.I go easy on the milk (to keep the batter thick enough), add an extra egg and use 2 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. baking soda  to turn out light fluffy pancakes.I also add in about a 1/2 cup of pecans,(instead of the walnuts)about half way through the process of grinding the oats. It seems to distribute the flavor more. These are WONDERFULL! Thank you for the recipe MYLEEN.

After trying tons of different whole grain recipes and tossing waaaaay too many "hockey pucks" into the garbage, I believe we have finally found a winner. Like other reviewers I used 2 eggs, but other than that I followed the recipe. It makes a huge batch, so next time I will omit the sugar. 1/3 cup in that quantity of batter really shouldn't make that big of a difference. Also, if you are really into whole grains, you can either do a coarse blend for the oats rather than turn them into a flour or don't blend them at all. Obviously if you do decide to not blend the oats I would let the final batter sit for 5-10 minutes to let them soften a bit. If a little extra sugar and whole grains are things that you don't care too much about then keep this recipe as-is (except for the eggs) and you will be very happy.

Favorite 'healthy' pancake recipe!  Halfed the recipe and still used 1 whole egg.  Ground up oats with 1 tblsp almonds and 1 tblsp walnuts.  Used skim milk- 1 1/4 cup- and added 1 tblsp apple cider vinegar for buttermilk sub.  Also used applesauce in place of oil.  Had a really nice fluffy texture, but super filling, and did I mention delicious and nutritious! Made 5 generous sized pancakes (1/2 cup batter per pancake).

These are our favorite pancakes so far. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, but I left out the nuts since my girls don't like them. I sprinkled blueberries on top while they cooked. Next time I'm going to try them with even less sugar. The fruit and syrup make them sweet enough.

Loved this - thanks!  To make oatmeal, I just whizzed some porridge oats in the blender (having googled images to find out what the British English translation of 'old-fashioned oatmeal' is!).  Instead of buttermilk, used some skimmed milk with a bit of lemon juice and half a large pot of plain yoghurt.  Pancakes rose beautifully.  Tried whizzing some nuts in the blender too - this gave a nutty taste with a smooth texture.  Other variations we liked were: added some dessicated coconut, frozen blueberries, and mashed banana.  All this made it very filling.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream plus sliced bananas and honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar for a treat.  Also works well with a spoonful of creamy yoghurt plus more fruit, for breakfast.  To make it healthier, I cut the oil a bit and it didn't seem to affect the taste, and reduced the sugar & subbed honey for it.  I wouldn't put olive oil in this, as it's got a strong savoury taste.  I used rapeseed oil (called Canola oil in the US), as it has a neutral taste and is very healthy.

I made these a week ago and can say this is the closest recipe to the IHOP one. I have tried the Copycat recipe and it always had a bad baking powder aftertaste. This recipe is a keeper.

These are fantastic!! Wonderful for my diabetic husband. I halved the recipe since it was only he & I eating them. Used just a bit of Turbinado Sugar & a bit of Splenda. I wish I had not read the reviews that thought it was runny, I used a tad bit less milk & after the batter sat for couple of minutes, the old fashioned oats had soaked up all the milk & it was too thick. I used a tad bit less baking soda & powder and made sure they were both totally incorporated into the flour. Added dark ground flaxseed & Texas Pecans for the walnuts. We ate it with Braum's Sugar free syrup & they were so delish and filling. I also used my blender to incorporate the wet ingredients since it was already out.

This a favorite at our house!  I have modified the recipe slightly .. substitute 2 Tbl splenda brown sugar for the sugar,add 3 Tbl chopped almonds and 3 Tbl choppen pecans.  I usually make up several batches of dry ingredients to have on hand.  Just add egg, oil and buttermilk (skim milk + 1 Tbl vinegar).  We also  use sugar free syrup.

This pancake is very very good. Given its high grain content, it's surprisingly moist. I did use no sugar added applesauce instead of the oil and I added 2 TBS of flaxseed and it was still very tasty. I thought having crunch in my pancakes was a little odd so next time I may throw the walnuts in the food processor for a finer chop but otherwise I'll make these again the same way. We topped them with fresh strawberries instead of syrup.

These turned out GREAT. I had to add a little more milk because my batter was a bit thick, but other than that.....YUM! For those who don't have a food processor, I ground the oats in the blender with the "ice crushing" feature. Worked great for me. I used the Maple Butter from this site on top of the pancakes. Very good. I would make these again in a heartbeat. I have to give it a lower score because my kids didn't care for them at all. And really, they are the reason I cook pancakes at all. They are better for grownups, not so much for kids.

These were delicious!  I had to substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil, and I added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla extract.  I didn't grind the oatmeal completely so the pancakes had an extra chewiness to their texture--which we loved!  They reheat fairly well but were a little dry.  Still, it's a wonderful pancake recipe, and the health benefits outweigh the dryness.  Next time I make these, I may add some mashed banana or applesauce.  My daughter proclaimed them "the best pancakes ever!" when served with fresh strawberries and light syrup!

I used natural yogurt instead of buttermilk and about 1/2 cup more  milk.  Let the wet ingredients soak with the oatmeal (didn't blend it) for about an hour, then added the remaining dry ingredients;doubled the baking powder. Without a doubt the best pancakes I have ever made!  Fluffy, tasty and healthy!

Perfect! I did slight tweaks. I added another egg, used Splenda, added some flax seed also. I cooked down some fresh berries for the topping. I kept the extra batter in the fridge over night and they came out so fluffy the next day! Recipe keeper!

I used vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk and I also used apple sauce instead of oil...probably a big mistake... Did not like the texture of these pancakes. I felt like it tasted like a huge oatmeal cookie.

I have made these pancakes EVERY WEEKEND for about a year and have it down pat - from start to table in 30 minutes. Here are some of my time-saving (& money-saving) tips. I grind large batches of oatmeal at once, enough for several batches of pancakes. I buy walnuts in bulk, chop them up and store. I "make" buttermilk by adding about 2 TB of vinegar to the 1 1/2 cup of milk (I do this first before I mix the other ingredients). I bought a large electric skillets just to make these pancakes, so I make six at a time. (The electric skillet has come in handy for many other dishes as well.) I also, as other reviewers, substitute the oil with apple sauce and omit the sugar. I keep a large bag of frozen blueberries on hand, so add blueberries, dried cranberries, and walnuts. My family loves these pancakes!! :)

Wow.  My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by how tasty these pancakes were.  I used powdered buttermilk (+water), substituted most of the vegetable oil for no sugar applesauce, kept maybe a tablespoon of oil, and used splenda instead of sugar.  They were not dense or heavy like some other pancakes that are "healthy."  Next time we will try adding some cinnamon to the batter & putting banana slices & walnuts in while the batter is on the griddle.

Yum!  The walnuts are such a nice touch (don't know If I can eat pancakes without them now ;) ) I subbed some of the whole wheat flour with ground flax and wheat germ, gotta keep my tummy slim ;)

These are great! I did as another suggested and added 1 more egg and subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for the 1/4 cup oil. I also added vanilla and cinnamon for spice. Thanks!

My family groaned when I told them I was making whole-grain oat and wheat pancakes. But when they ate these, they went crazy with praise! They said these where the best pancakes they had ever tasted! THANK YOU! (I added an extra egg, per some other suggestions, but found the batter to be too runny and had to add flour. Next time, I will make it as written.)

This recipe is so wonderful that you can use what you have in the pantry and change up the flours, nuts, or add something new. Warning, once you start experimenting with flavors you'll be addicted like me. A can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe. I never knew I could make such healthy wonderful tasting pancakes.

This recipe makes an excellent fluffy and tasty pancake.  In keeping with my tradition of a lazy Sunday morning, after I grinded the oats in the blender, for ease and no dirty bowls to deal with, I added the rest of the dry ingredients to the blender, whirled it for less than a second, then added the wet ingredients and mixed until just blended.   I didn’t add the walnuts but did add blueberries after the batter was poured on the griddle.  Tasty and healthy – you can’t do better than that.

These are my husband's new favorite pancakes.  Wish I could have given them a four and a half star rating.  I really do feel the batter needed an additional egg as others have stated.  These remind me a lot of What A Dish's whole grain waffle recipe that we love so much.  Both batters seem to soak up liquid as they set, so it's a good idea for them to be a tad bit on the thin side to begin.  I spiced mine up with a teaspoon of cinnamon and added between 1/3 to 1/2 cup of mixed walnuts and pecans.  Next time I'll also add a couple tablespoons of flax meal.  Thanks Myleen for such a tasty and healthy recipe.

We can't stop making these they taste so great. We do add cinnamon or nutmeg and blueberries or bananas. An easy recipe to "play" with to make tasty changes.

I wanted a recipe that did not use white flour as we are trying to eat more natural and organic foods. Yummy!  I did make changes to this recipe as per some of the other reviews.  I substituted applesauce for the oil, plain yogurt for the buttermilk, honey for the sugar and I increased the eggs to 2.  Didn't have any walnuts so used 1/4 cup whole flax seeds.  They were great! Topped them with sliced strawberries and stevia and organic 100% maple syrup. My boys ate them and wanted more! They were really thick and fluffy.  Will make these in a large quantity and freeze.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This gets a five star from my hubby and I. I did use applesauce in place of the oil, 1 cup of buttermilk (made with vinegar) and 3/4 cup of milk. It was skim milk also. 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, less than 1/3 cup of Splenda. I added 3 Tbsp of sunflower seeds. With the oats, I round up 1-1/4 cup and kept the other 1/4 whole, the texture was great. I also used to eggs per some suggestions. This recipe made 10, 5 inch pancakes. I am going to flash freeze them and eat them later...Hope that works. Thanks for this great recipe!!!

Amazing pancakes!  They really do taste just like IHOP's Harvest Grain!  I used to eat a plate of them every week when I was pregnant (hey, at least it was right after prenatal water aerobics!).  So happy I can make them whenever I want now! Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe!! Add lemon juice to milk instead of buttermilk because that's what I usually have on hand. Recipe as is BARELY feeds my family of six. I also just use oat flour rather than process my own.

A little bland if recipe is followed as directed. Needs extra spice or flavour - next time I'll add more nuts and cinnamon or vanilla for a little something extra.

Great recipe! This is my first time making wheat pancakes and these were great! Everyone loved them. There were a bit clumpy (bulky), but regardless the taste was spot on! I will be making these again. Thanks!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  It's so close to IHOP's pancakes!  My family, including my somewhat picky daughter, loved them.  Made it with 2 eggs as suggested.  Threw in a few more walnuts which I preferred.  Will DEFINITELY keep this recipe.

This is my 2nd time making these.  The batter was thicker this time, so I'm not sure what modifications I made the first time around. I'm not usually a pancake person but these were fantastic.  It makes a lot!!  I made a bunch and stored them in the fridge and would bring two to work for a mid-afternoon snack w/ peanut butter (didn't even heat up).  These are great if you're a runner and need something quick to get your energy back.  I will never make any other kind again!

I just made these for an early Father's Day breakfast--Dad loved them and kids thought they were great too!  After reading many reviews (and trying to use up stuff in the fridge before our vacation) I added an extra egg.  I also used powdered milk and some vinegar for the buttermilk.  I used pecans instead of walnuts because of an allergy (and they were in the freezer).  The batter did start out very thin--thought I'd have to add more flour--but became thicker as the batter sat for a few minutes (guess the oatmeal absorbed some of the liquid).  As a clean-up hint, after I ground up the oatmeal in my food processor, I added the other dry ingredients and gave them a little whirl to mix.  I then mixed the wet ingredients in another bowl and added the dry mix to the wet (even though that's backwards it worked just fine) which saved me an extra bowl to clean up!  This also made more pancakes than I expected--plenty for my family of five which includes two teenagers!  These were definitely moist and oh so yummy!  Thanks for sharing ;-)

We make these once a week.  We always have leftovers and they freeze well for a weekday morning.  The only thing we do different is grind up the nuts with the oatmeal.  I had two small children who are very picky about nuts in their food.  We can taste them but they can't see them, so it's a win win situation.  We can't find buttermilk locally here in Japan so we now use just regular milk for the recipe and works fine too.  However, it does taste really good with the buttermilk.

Terrific recipe! I made these for brunch and they were a big hit. I also made traditional buttermilk pancakes but these disappeared first. Nobody ever guessed they were full of oats and whole wheat since they were too tasty to be a healthier alternative. The only issue was that they did not bubble like traditional pancakes so I needed to peek underneath in order to know when to flip.

We enjoyed these substantial healthy pancakes. I always embellish a bit no matter the recipe so I used sucanat instead of sugar, 1Tbls. gr.flax seed and kefir instead of the milks listed and a tsp. of cinnamon. I needed to add an additional egg and water because the mixture was too thick. As the cakes were cooking I tossed on a few blackberies and strawberries. I included the nuts also. Perfect healthy start to the day.

I've been looking for a good whole grain pancake recipe and couldn't find one we really liked before this one. The flavor reminds me of a good,healthy muffin. I did take the advice of previous reviewers and made the following adjustments: 2 eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I had to use Splenda instead of sugar, used 1% milk and added a bit more walnuts because we love them. 
Since we only eat whole grain I thank you for allowing us to have pancakes for breakfast again.

5 stars for a recipe almost exactly like this one.  I use 3/4 cup ground oatmeal, 3/4 c. ww flour, and 1/4 c. sugar.  Only use the buttermilk and not the plain milk.  At the end add 3 Tbsp. each of finely ground walnuts and almonds.  Make them small.  Cook for 2 minutes on each side.  Yummy! The best pancake I've ever had. I'll make a batch just for me and have leftovers from the freezer for days. Just as good reheated.

This was excellent, just like IHOP's.  I used spelt flour instead of WW, and butter instead of oil.  Very yummy.

My family and I did not like these at all.  The pancakes were difficult to flip over for one thing.  They were also difficult to fully cook.  I thought they were done by length of cooking time and by their coloring, but when I tasted, it was still raw in the middle.  The taste was not exciting either.  I'm frankly surprised they have such high marks from most reviewers.  By old fashioned oatmeal, you meant Quaker Oats, right?

You do need to increase the flour and oats to 1.5 cups each, as mentioned by another reviewer.  These came out really good!  Similar to the ones at IHOP, which I love!  Will make again and again!

This pancake batter is definitely too thin.  I've made lots of pancakes and I think there should be more flour.  I added 1/2 cup all purpose flour and they were better.  However, my husband and I thought they were very good.  I was hoping to find a recipe like the whole grain pancakes at IHOP.  These are similar.

I've followed this recipe as it is written and I have played around with different nut milks and egg replacer to make this vegan.   A huge hit, every time!     They freeze well, too.    

I live by the beach in southern California, and thought that this might influence the texture of the pancakes, but I am consistently pleased with the results.

I loved these! I too added 2 eggs. did not have enough walnuts so I used both walnuts & pecans ground together and added to the mix. Also added blueberries as DH loves them. They reheated in the microwave for breackfast wonderful. I will definatly make again!

Made exactly as recipe called for.  Quite lumpy/thick but didn't want to add extra egg as other reviewers had mixed comments.  Tasted very good though and just what I was hoping for.

I'm not much of a pancake fan, but I'd have to say these were really good!  For those looking for the middle ground between chomping from the feedbag and eating something that won't fill you up for more than an hour, this may be it.

I made this recipe just as it was written and they were very good. My family loved them. I will be making them again I am sure.  I will experiment with different spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a great recipe.

This is a much better alternative to the IHOP Harvest Grain pancakes.  I was at a location where I didn't have a blender so I just mixed up everything in a bowl and the pancakes turned out great! Hearty and moist. This recipe uses less baking powder than the copycat IHOP Harvest Grain.  That cut the bitter taste I had been getting with the IHOP recipe.  I'll try applesauce as previously suggested and maybe some cinnamon.

Hmmmm - not sure. I found them a little oily and the wholewheat/oatmeal made them quite heavy. They weren't bad though and I did eat about six :)

Really good!  Light and fluffy, despite the heavy whole grains.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  I added the walnuts to the oats in the processor and gave it a few pulses to grind them up more.  The consistency of the batter was perfect - neither too runny nor too thick.  Be sure to oil or use non-stick cooking spray on your griddle because they will stick.  It made a wholesome, filling and tasty breakfast!

With no white flour, I expected these pancakes to be heavy but the oatmeal keeps them light and moist. I also used freshly ground, hard red wheat and they were amazing!

Absolutely delicious. Despite the initial fear that loyal "all-purpose" white flour users may feel upon seeing the ingredients, never fear. I have an entire family of picky eaters, difficult to please with healthy choices that involve brown flour, oats, and reduced fat. These pancakes are entirely satisfying just as regular buttermilk pancakes, and with a wicked punch of healthy and wholesome ingredients, hardly any fat, and (the best part) they are so easy to cook. The only adjustments I made were: I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used 1/2 cup of nonfat vanilla yogurt and regular (1%) milk, but cut it down to about 1 2/3 cup. I used 1 egg plus 1 egg white for a fluffier texture. I also used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of the oil, but it didn't compromise the taste. Just use nonstick cooking spray on the pan and you're good to go. Also add about 1 tsp cinnamon if you like, for some extra flavor. Don't worry if the batter seems ultra-thick, almost an oatmeal consistency - they turn out just fine. Serve with sliced bananas and boysenberry syrup on top - they're to die for!!!

I made the recipe as written (with one exception I didn't have buttermilk, so I used/made sour milk).  My elementary kids ate until they were beyond full.  I got a bite while it was still hot and loved it too.  They were moist and flavorful.  Two of my kids put a little butter on them and skipped the syrup.

These are the best!  I followed other reviews...and halved the sugar, and added one more egg.  They're incredible with chocolate chips too! I found I'll cook up the rest of the batter...and grab them in the morning for a quick breakfast...they're fantastic cold! (I've brought them on planes too!)

No need to grind the oats, I left them as they were.  I cut the amount of sugar when subbing with honey.  I did not put in the nuts because I like pancakes with peanut butter and syrup on the top.

These were very very delicious. Of course, I'm not sure if the original recipe is, but even with all of my messups they turned out good. I didn't have milk, so I used coconut milk. Crazy huh? Then, since I'd messed up a couple times, I decided to take liberties. I added a teaspoon of vanilla at the end and some spices(cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves). They were mighty tasty.

These pancakes were wonderful!  Per other reviewers, I added an extra egg, more walnuts, about 1 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon, and a scant 1/2 C of flaxseed meal.  I served these with grapefruit and orange segments.  SO YUMMY!

These are great and so healthy.  I added chopped banana.  So good.  I also used pecans since I didn't have walnuts.  I still loved them.  We eat them plain because they are so good.  If you add bananas it sweetens the batter so I will reduce the sugar next time.

These are wonderful!  They came as close to IHOP's grain and nut pancakes as you can come without all those ingredients that we can't pronounce that you know they add.  I had a problem with them wanting to be a bit gooey in the middle, but I think it's because I had the heat under my griddle too high so that they wanted to brown too much before they got to cook all the way through.  I like mine with lots more nuts than the recipe calls for.  My son gave it a one-shoulder nod with a so-so type grunt when I asked him what he thought of them.  That means he likes them but doesn't want to admit it because the name of the recipe sounds too healthy (he's 17).  Very very good, and I've been making my own pancakes from scratch for years.  You can use only one bowl by mixing the wet ingredients first, then dumping on the dry ingredients and mix them with a good-quality wire whisk.

This recipe is great!  It tastes just like the ones at IHOP.  My husband isn't too much of a whole-grain guy, but he really liked these pancakes.  This is a winner.

These pancakes have great taste.  I recommend cooking on a med-low temp. since they tend to burn quickly.  Another good idea is to add a little extra milk to thin them. You should also pour 3-4 inch pancakes, because they are so dense, they are difficult to flip and the sides that don't make it on the spatula want to break off.

These were awesome!!  My 3 year old and I loved them and now we know how to make oatmeal flour. :)  Thanks for the great recipe!!  Oh, we did make two changes - we used skim milk because that's all we drink here (thus reducing fat/calories significantly), and we made buttermilk out of skim milk with a dollop of apple cider vinegar - my mom's trick that I always use.

I loved the texture of these pancakes.  Followed the advice of some members and used two eggs instead of one.  I also added lots of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla. This is my new breakfast favourite.

Very good! Wished I would've read the reviews beforehand! Nextt ime I'll use 1 1/2 tsp cinn & some vanilla. My husband loves blueberries so I'll put those in for him. I used the buttermilk & milk & didn't find the batter too runny as other people did. Used Splenda for the sugar. Thanks so much!

Great recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp of Cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla and increased walnuts to 1/4 cup.  Substituted Splenda for the sugar.  Makes a delicious South Beach Diet friendly recipe.

These were very good! I used 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup wheat instead of all wheat.  I also ground the walnuts so they wouldn't be too chunky.  Very yummy :)

okay, this is a very good base for ideas. The oatmeal and wheat flour is really great, I did increase to 1 1/2 cup each. I added pinch of Pumpkin Pie spice, 1/4 C.Brown sugar, 3T honey, 1 sm. banana,2T oil, 1 T vanilla, 1/4 C. orange juice and 3/4 C skim milk. My boys loved them. But after adding all of these changes, I felt that the original recipe deserved 3 stars.

The best pancakes I've ever tasted! I have to admit that I goofed and used all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat, but the resulting batter was so watery that I added a lot of whole wheat flour to thicken it up. The resulting pancakes were tall and fluffy and full of nutty-grain goodness. I served these with diced fresh peaches (sugared and microwaved for about a minute to make a syrup), and it was delicious! Thank you!

I too have made whole wheat pancakes for a number of years. I thought they were really awesome. My husband and I agree that they were superb with the ground up oats and walnuts. Ours were a perfect consistency and the walnuts were a nice healthy touch. Seasonal fruit would be good as well. I think I'll use strawberry freezer jam for syrup next time.

Awesome. I am at high altitude, and used some of "mommy"s adjustments. Best pancakes ever!  I used the 1/4 c. oil  AND added 1/2 c. applesauce, used 2 eggs and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla. My favorite pancakes ever! My family loved them and we still have some leftovers for tomorrow, although hard not to snack on them through the day!

Made my buttermilk w 1 cup 2% milk to 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and let it sit 5 minutes. I ended up w an extra half cup of liquid that I didn't need. Great hearty pancakes. I would add about a dozen more chopped pecans. Husband loved me

I have made these pancakes so many times with some alterations (the four stars is before alterations).  It's a very flexible recipe, but the one consistent thing I do is to NOT grind the oats, and usually use all soured milk (I wish it was buttermilk, but I never have any, so I just sour the milk with vinegar).  These are so perfectly melt in your mouth delicious with a delightful texture from the whole oats, which I think also would resolve the problem people have with them being too heavy and dry.  I have subbed banana or butter for the oil (depending on how fat I felt), used white and regular whole wheat flour, subbed pumpkin for some of the liquid, added vanilla and cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves, cut back on the sugar, etc., and these turn out every time. I have had everyone whose eaten them ask for the recipe and it is now their go-to for pancakes. Make these today.

Fluffy, soft, cake-like texture with a full grainy flavor. Absolutely amazing! The first time I followed the recipe exactly (shocker, right?) and they were fantastic. The second time I substituted coconut sugar and they were still fantastic. For those who don't know, coconut sugar tastes more like caramel (I HATE coconut flavor). It was a wonderful addition if you have some around.

The batter is quite runny. They still turned out pretty good. They weren't that fluffy but were quite light for a whole wheat pancake.

These are great.  We don't drink milk so i substituted Almond Milk (used 1.5 Tbs of vinegar to make part of it buttermilk).  I also use apple sauce in place of oil and don't put quite 1/3 a cup of sugar (more like 1/4 cup).  I add chopped pecans and walnuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  My husband adds chocolate chips to his and i usually add some sort of fruit (banana, blueberries, etc).  They are great - so filling and healthy!  They're so tasty you don't even need syrup or anything on them.

I thought this recipe was great.  I have not had IHOP pancakes in a long time, so I can't compare them.  However, judging them on their own merit I would say they are wonderful in their own right.  I followed the recipe as listed, but I did add about 2 TBS each of chopped pecans and almonds along with the walnuts.  I sprayed my pan with a light coating of cooking spray for most of the pancakes and really liked them.  However, I did use about a tsp of oil in the pan for the last 2 pancakes, and I thought those were much better.  Either way, I will be making this recipe again...thanks so much for sharing!

This is by far the best homemade pancake recipe I have ever tried out of the probably dozen different recipes I've tried over the past three or four years. I love the texture and taste that the oats and walnuts add. Whole wheat is healthy, oatmeal is filling, walnuts are the best cooking nut (IMO), buttermilk is supposed to make great pancakes, and the genius who combined all of them in this recipe is INCREDIBLE!


After making the recipe verbatim a couple times, I decided to improve it slightly. The batter was always a little runny for my taste (which made the pancakes too thin and prone to tearing/falling apart), and I don't usually have buttermilk sitting around. So, I add a tablespoon of Cream of Tartar to the dry ingredients (mix those before adding wet) and then I only use 2 cups of 2% milk... Perfect!


Sitting down to feast, I love topping the pancakes with organic wildflower honey and fresh sliced bananas (for variety, try blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries as well). If I have it, a dollop of whipped cream is sensational.

These were pretty good and even better than expected. I made the full recipe and got 14 pancakes. The only changes I made was using white whole wheat flour and I made a mock buttermilk. My pancakes were slightly on the thin side, so using regular buttermilk might be neccessary. I had to cook one at a time because of this. I also was surprised at how sweet they are. I did add the optional walnuts and highly recommend them.

Great recipe! I went sugarless and dairy free. I used two eggs like other people suggested instead of one. Instead of oatmeal I used oat bran which was already fine so I didn't have to put it through a food processor. Instead of sugar I put in a cup of applesauce (homemade with cinnamon). Instead of milk I used almond milk, and instead of buttermilk I used soy milk with lemon.

THese are very healthy if you exchange the vegetable oil for walnut oil.  I felt they were a little thick and could've used more moisture.  Next time i will try adding another egg, some applesause, a little cinnamon and more walnuts.

I added an extra egg, and because I didn't have buttermilk, I used milk and added a splash of vinegar.  Instead of the suggested chopped walnuts, I added a few tablespoons of ground flax.  THESE WERE AMAZING!  (Next time I'll pour smaller pancakes, as the plate-size ones I did this time were difficult to flip).

These were delicious. I followed the recipe as it was and probably won't change a thing next time...or the next...or the next!

these tasted great, but they were a little crumbly. We ate them with spreadable fruit (jelly without the sugar) and they were fine. My toddler, however had a hard time eating them due to the crumbly-ness...

OH SO GOOD! I made these but altered the recipe quite a bit and they still turned out FABULOUS! I was going for a reduced fat and sugar version of this. I used 1 3/4 whole wheat flour since I only used 2 tbsp of sugar. I added extra flour for consistency. I also used 2 tbsp of oil, 1 tbsp of honey, 1 whole egg and an extra egg white, 1% milk and made buttermilk using 1% milk and a little lemon juice. They pancakes are SO good! My entire family loves them so I will make them anytime we are craving pancakes. We topped it with a thin layer of peanut butter and some sugar free syrup. SERIOUSLY good, trust me.

This is a great recipe.  I must say the first time I made them I made a few adjustments and they weren't very good - entirely MY fault.  The second time I made them I added a bit of brown sugar, substituted 1/2 c of the whole wheat flour with 1/4 c unbleached white whole wheat and 1/4 c ground flax seed (the added brown sugar, white whole wheat and ground flax I use in tandem quite often when a recipe calls for all whole wheat).

Here are a few pointers to others:  this is a real heavy batter and has a 'rise', so flipping these can be a nightmare.  I had better luck turning the temp down to barely medium, making them smaller than stated and letting each pancake cook nearly done before trying to flip.  If your spatula becomes 'gummy', clean it well and spray with Pam or apply oil.

Fantastic recipe!  This is definitely a keeper!  THANKS

This really is the best! I added two ripe bananas & some vanilla to the wet mixture, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. They don't look as pretty as other pancakes but taste a million times better!

Fabulous.  Guess what?  Guess why?  I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE TO THE LETTER.  Thanks, Myleen!  My opinion is if you don't make the recipe as it's written, at least once, a review has no merit.

I know some people don't like it when others review recipes they have adjusted. But since I feel a truly good recipe can be adjusted to accommodate many different preferences here is my review. I LOVE this pancake recipe. I have tried many different whole wheat pancakes I have liked but this one I love. I did add 2tsp of cinnamon and vanilla. I also increased the sugar for my kids from 1/3c to 1/2 c. I subbed applesauce for the oil and used only buttermilk. I also left out the nuts because my son doesn't like them. Although I would love them so maybe next time I will add them. I forgot to add I never grind the oatmeal to much to bother with. This has never presented a problem in this recipe or any other breads I have made using oatmeal.

Update my son has developed a problem with digesting dairy. We were able to make these pancakes by making the following changes. I used 1 Tbsp of baking powder instead of the 2 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder and used almond milk in place of cows milk and buttermilk. We still loved them just as much. It did however take a bit longer to cook. Because I was able to adjust the recipe to accomodate our dietary needs and still remain tasty I feel the recipe deserves 10 stars.

Very good! I used 2 eggs like some suggested and a Tsp of vanilla.
2nd time I used apples sauce instead of oil, about 1/4c of brown sugar instead of white, a little cinnamon and cloves. Still very good!

Wow, these are delicious!  I halved the recipe (for two people) and went ahead and used a whole egg, and they came out perfect.  Especially yummy with fruit on top.

This has become the main pancake recipe I use. They are very hearty and will keep my kids (3 teenagers!) satisfied for a long time. All of their friends love them as well. Sometimes I don't use the nuts and they are still great. I use 3 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of the white and generally just 3 tablespoons of oil, sometimes substituting with applesauce if I have it on hand. I also almost always add a grated apple to the mix.

Very yummy and I never have all the ingredients so I'm sure I'm missing out on how great they really are. These pancakes don't leave you weighed down like normal pancakes. It's now my new craving, thanks for sharing. Oh my kid even eats it!!

Very tasty pancake.  I followed other recommendations to use 2 eggs, cinnamon, and vanilla.  I also substituted milk and vinegar for the buttermilk.

Yummm!  Just what I was hoping for.  I like to sneak in healthy alternatives for my kids (11, 8, 5) whenever possible.  But, to be honest, I'm not usually very successful, especially when it comes to whole grains.  They always notice and not in a positive way. :) But, not with this one.  While they all three immediately detected this was not their usual "white flour, loaded with chocolate chips pancake recipe", all three immediately responded with an, "Ummm, these are really good." Each of them gobbled them up, and when asked if they'd want me to make them again, they all said "yes."  That makes this a grand slam, worthy of 5 stars, in my book.  The only alterations I made was adding a splash of vanilla and a sprinkling of cinnamon.  I also omitted the nuts to make them more kid-friendly, but I think I might even be able to sneak them by them next time around.  Great recipe!!!!!  Oh, did I mention, that I absolutely loved them? - just as good as IHOP's.  Also, not sure why other reviewer's think they are dry.  Mine were extremely moist.

These were excellent!  I always get the Harvest Grain pancakes at IHOP, and I thought I'd try these to see if they were similar.  The real test was feeding them to the kids, since they usually only eat buttermilk pancakes.  Well, four kids, a stack of pancakes and silence at the table means they were gobbling them up!  They loved them, too, and I felt good about feeding them something more nutritious.  The only change I made was to add a dash of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg, and I used pecans instead of walnuts because I had them on hand.  I did put the pecans in with the oats in the food processor to grind them up finely so the kids would eat them. These were excellent, light and no baking soda taste at all!

Oh my gosh, these are so good! I changed them just a tad and used 2 eggs instead of one, added 1 tsp cinnamon, subbed agave nectar for the sugar and used probably double the walnuts. So moist and absolutely delicious!

These are our new favorite pancake recipe.  I don't think I can go back to just using plain white flour.  The flavor that the buttermilk and oatmeal adds is delicious.  You wouldn't know that these were whole wheat pancakes.  I added a healthy dose of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I put blueberries in half the batch and they were delicious.

The best pancakes ever bar none!!!! I also make waffles with this recipe just as it is.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I searched for a whole wheat pancake recipe and this is the first one that I tried, because of the high rating from more than a hundred cooks.  Now I refuse to take my time trying another, (I'm sure there are more just as good...I just don't know which one) I've never been so lucky...so great a recipe on the first try.  Thanks AllRecipes.com for such a great web site.

This is a great recipe! I did a lot of modifications like other people. I added cinnimon and vanilla extract. I used less flour and added wheat germ. I used 2 eggs instead of one. I used 1/4 of applesauce instead of oil and splenda instead of sugar. I also added a mashed banana and blueberries. I forgot the nuts, which would of topped it off.   These are great for my diet and hold me over in the morning. They taste great and are filling too!  Thanks

The only reason I am giving this recipe 4 is because it wasn't as good without a few minor changes.  I took others advice and added 1/2 c applesauce instead of 1/4 c oil.  I also added 2 eggs instead of 1 and added about 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also sprinkled in a good amt of cinnamon. I used walnuts for the nuts and my boyfriend couldn't get enough. I didnt have whole wheat flour on hand, so I used regular flour and these were just fine, although not quite as nutritious.  Thanks for the recipe! This will be a new sunday morning staple!

These pancakes are wonderful.  I can honestly say they are the best I've had.  They have the perfect texture and are nice and fluffy and moist.   I made a few changes.  I left out the oil and added 2 tbsp of ground flax seed and 2 tbsp wheat germ in it's place.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp nutmeg.  I added the walnuts after I had poured the batter onto the pan and also added blueberries at this point as well.  So good!

These were met with rave reviews in this house.  As recommended by others, I added 1/2c wheat germ, used 2 eggs and used 1/2c apple sauce instead of the oil.

This is a great recipe!!  Even my husband, who is always wary of recipes I call "healthy", loved them.  I'll definitely make them again.

Double the nuts, toasted.  Try some plain yogurt in place of some milk.  Add the fruit of choice and cinnamon.  Whip egg white add an extra to help lighten up.  These are great frozen and toasted days later for quick get out of the house breakfast.

This is the only pancake recipe I will ever use from now on!  We like to have these as "breakfast-for-dinner."  I usually add some frozen (thawed) blueberries to the batter just before cooking them.

Great recipe, though a little sweet. The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly, my 4-star rating is based on this. The second time I made them, I cut the sugar amount in half and used brown sugar instead of white, used only about half as much oil, and added in frozen blueberries and mashed banana. These were perfect! I'll be making them in this variation again.

Excellent. I ground the oatmeal in the food processor to make it like a flour and substituted applesauce for the oil. IMPORTANT: These are very heavy and makes a bit more than you may need. They also soak up lots of syrup. I changed the serving size to 5 (actually made 6 good sized pancakes), figuring my husband would eat 3 and I would eat 2. WRONG! These are so heavy, my husband could eat only 2 and I was stuffed after only 1. I didn't want to throw the rest away, so they went in the refrigerator, and they were eaten over the weekend. My husband really liked them.

My family loves this recipe. I made it for my parents & my mom thought it was wonderful. I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had. It's great to make ahead & keep in the fridge for a quick breakfast during the work week. Just make sure to wisk it first.

These tasted good, but could be better.  I made a half batch, but still with a whole egg.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts, just my own preference.  The batter ended up being pretty thin so I added more whole wheat flour.  I also ended up accidentally forgetting the sugar.  The resulting pancakes tasted good, though they were pretty dry.  They were also pretty good sized, hefty pancakes.  My half batch made six pancakes and my bf and I each only ate one with some butter and syrup (he used a LOT) and sliced strawberries on top.  He has high cholesterol and I'm trying to help him eat more fiber.  These had a good taste and I will probably try them again, though I may well use the yogurt and applesauce that some other reviewers have used.  Mine were not tender and moist as someone else said - I kept the heat pretty low but maybe I cooked too long?  I waited to flip until it was pretty firm.  Anyway, I will try these again.

This recipe was really awesome! The pancakes were moist and tender, and just the right amount of sweetness WITHOUT any syrup. My batter, though, was quite runny, so i added an extra 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and minimized the sugar to 1/4 cup. They still turned out awesome!

These are so HEARTY and so delicious!! Everyone including my one year old (minus the nuts) gobbled them up! 
This batch is very large so I'll make more tomorrow. 
My variation: 1 cup of multigrain hot cereal, 1/2 cup oat bran hot cereal & 3 tbl. flax meal instead of just oats. 
I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to wet mixture. And I substituted 1/4 egg whites for egg.

I made this recipe without eggs, and for the buttermilk I did half low fat butter milk and nonfat vanilla yogurt. I have to day that these are delicious.

Wonderful! These were great pancakes. My husband has a tradition of making pancakes on Saturday morning for us. So, I made up the recipe on Friday night (keeping dry and wet ingredients separate), then he easily had breakfast ready for us the next morning. I added a little vanilla and he added butterscotch chips... which, if you've never had butterscotch chips in pancakes before, they are definitely a must!!!

I made the following adjustments to this recipe to make it low, almost no fat, and the results were just excellent.  

For the fats, I substituted 1/4 cup commercial egg substitute for the 1 egg.  I also substituted 1 frozen, then thawed banana for the oil.  I mixed the banana in the blender with the buttermilk and milk.  Applesauce would probably work OK too...

The pancakes were very very moist, just a bit chewy from the oats, and tender.  We served with fresh strawberries tossed with a little bit of raw sugar.  I also swapped the walnuts for a few rough chopped pecans.

Otherwise followed the recipe as listed.

A+ recipe, just great, thank you for the listing.

Wow-- fantasticly light and delicious pancakes... the texture's great!  Next time, I'd go easy on the sugar.  I prefer sweetness in maple syrup form.  Like other users, I'd also recommend adding more walnuts.  
I didn't have any buttermilk, so, as google recommended, I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the wet ingredients.  They turned out fine :).

I really liked this recipe but I changed it just a little.  I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed and used only 1 1/2 tablespoons of conola oil. I also added a little wheat germ as well as using buttermilk powder ( it has a lot less fat than reg. buttermilk). You do have to add a little more liquid because of the extra powder ingrediants ( I just used water). My kiddos loved them!!

Loved this recipe! Added cinn. and vanilla, and replaced buttermilk with lemon juice and nonfat milk. Left out the 1 cup of milk altogether. We also used scottish oatmeal so it cuts out the step of gringing the oatmeal. Great! This is new family favorite.

Huge hit with my family, including 5 yo and 3 yo DS.  I didn't give it a five-star though because I could taste the baking soda even though no one else noticed.  I'll definitely make them again and try tweaking the soda/powder amounts.

These have become one of our new favorites! We follow the South Beach diet, so I used Splenda in place of the sugar, and also replaced half the oil with ground flaxseed meal. They were a little thin at first, so I added a tiny bit more flour to the batter, and they were perfect.

These were a VERY good healthy alternative to a traditional pancake.  I substituted applesauce for the oil, and I added 1.5 T cider vinegar to the milk in place of buttermilk.  I omitted the sugar altogether and put in 4 pkts of Splenda and one ripe banana.  I ground up the oats AND pecans.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg, vanilla, and ground flaxseed.  These were thick, a little dense, and not hard to flip at all.  Use a big spatula!

I opted for 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup cornmeal, and 1 cup multigrain breakfast cereal (with oats, barley, etc.) and used a mix of roughly even proportions of buttermilk, yogurt and milk for the dairy component.

These were DELICIOUS, and had a nice crunch. I think the nuts are necessary, assuming you aren't allergic! Next time I'd like to try adding pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds for a different crunchy taste.

I forgot to put the nuts in, but they were stil delicious. I did find the batter to be a tad runny. I think I might make the batter the night before to let the milk soak up and add only the egg in the morning. Very very tasty. Also made a nice waffle.

This was my first time making pancakes and I think it turned out pretty well. I say this because I was not 100% sure what the batter consistency was supposed to be. With that said, I enjoyed these pancakes and will definitely make them again. 

They were very thick and meaty and not like IHOP. I think IHOP is quite a bit thinner. These were thick like regular buttermilk pancakes. 

Next time, I'm going to try to add more milk, & try adding applesauce (my father's suggestion & he makes delicious pancakes!). I also added a lot of chopped almonds, walnuts & pecans and I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.

Considering the heaviness of the batter, I used this recipe to make waffles instead of pancakes.  To save on calories/fat, I did the ol' skim milk/lemon juice trick for the buttermilk, subbed applejuice for the milk and applesauce for the oil and br. sugar for white.  The additions of vanilla, cinnamon and a diced banana perked up what could have been a 'so-so' flavor.  The waffles turned out dense, but crispy and slightly sweet -- could have been eaten as is, but my son requested a drizzle of syrup.  They freeze well, too.  Thanks!

Very good base, I'll need to experiment with different fruits and flavors to get what I want. Tried apple so far, but makes for a weird texture. On the other hand, my mom loved it and she never eats breakfast unless she cooks.

These were pretty good. I halved the recipe, substituted milk and a dash of lemon juice for the buttermilk since I had none on hand, used less milk, and added a dash of vanilla, a sprinkling of cinnamon, and 1 chopped skin-on apple to the mix. Very filling and best of all, healthy. Thanks for sharing!

Waaaay too much baking soda.  Terribly salty/soda-y tasting.  Difficult to fix because the batter is so heavy.  They looked pretty, but tasted terrible.

I made these this morning, & they were great.  After reading the reviews, I omitted the cup of milk.  The batter was perfect.  I used fresh blueberries instead of nuts.  I have eaten the IHOP version several times.  These are better.

We liked the pancakes that this recipe produced. I changed the recipe only slightly.  I added 1/4 cup unblended/processed oatmeal.  I used 2 eggs as I saw in a previous review, however next time would only use one.  Tasted too much egg with two.  I was a little confused though, original recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of egg which I thought would not be enough.  I didn't use walnuts but put fresh blueberry in.  I found the recipe a bit on the wet side even with the additional 1/4 cup oatmeal that I used and had to add some more flour to thicken to my liking.  I would next time add some vanilla extract and cinnamon to recipe.

This is a pretty awesome recipe. I didn’t have any buttermilk, so I used 2.5 cups of 2% milk and 1 tbsp of vinegar, and let it sit 5 minutes. I milled the flour myself on my Mockmill (a countertop mill, kind of expensive but easy to use). I milled 180 grams of Brian Severson Farms Turkey Red wheat for the wheat flour and 135 grams of Meuer Farms steel cut oats. Oats are fattier than other grains and tend to clog the mill, so I mixed them with the wheat berries and milled them together and that worked just fine. The batter was on the thinner side, so if you like thicker pancakes, I’d bring the wheat up to 200 grams. The pancakes are very delicate and delicious!

The best pancakes ever! Couple modifications: Raw coconut sugar instead of white sugar, coconut oil instead of oil, milk with 1 T vinegar and 1/4 cup nonfat yogurt instead of buttermilk. Added cinnamon and nutmeg. Apples would be a nice addition.

Looking for a healthier pancake for our 1 year old and this was a hit, everyone enjoyed them!  I ranked it 4 star instead of 5 just due to the amount of time to prep compared to our other recipe we normally use.
I didn't use walnuts due to our LO eating them but will try next time.
After reading some reviews I did add 1tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon, 2 eggs instead of 1, and 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.
They do brown and look almost burnt due to the wheat flour very quickly but aren't and taste great.

I really liked these for a nice healthy option 
Although I did end up adding a little more milk (perhaps 1/3 cup) for fluffier pancakes 

Over all this is a good recipe and I will make it again

I've made these a few times. I love IHOP's Harvest Grain and Nut Pancakes and these may be even better. The nuts are a must in my opinion. I've added either walnuts or pecans based on what I have on hand and I add more then the recipe calls for. I'm making them tomorrow with blueberry and banana toppings. So good!!

This is my go to pancake recipe. As delicious as any buttermilk pancake made with with flour, in fact I prefer them. I use all buttermilk instead of milk and buttermilk. I also cheat on the preparation and save time and clean up. I do this by grinding oats in the blender as directed. Then I add all the dry ingredients to the blender and mix them. Then I throw all the wet ingredients into the blender and mix gently, using a spoon afterward to make sure it’s all mixed. It is important to let the batter sit for better rise/ fluffiness. Then I pour straight from blender to the pan. I have made it as directed mixing wet stuff together first etc. and there is zero difference in the yummy result.

I made these pancakes as written and I thought they were very good, though I've had "Harvest Grain 'N Nut" style pancakes like this that were even better, so I might try a few modifications, like a second egg or some cinnamon the next time around.

I didn't think the pancakes were dry like some reviewers complain about. They were heavy and filling, but that's how I like my pancakes and I've never had "Harvest Grain 'N Nut" style pancakes that weren't that way.

One thing that surprised me was the runniness of the batter. It was wet enough, I wasn't sure it would cook right, but it did, and the pancakes puffed to normal thickness during cooking.

The runniness did cause one little problem I had to adjust for, however. I'm used to knowing when to flip pancakes by the bubbles that pop when you cook them. Ordinarily, when the popped bubbles leave indentations, the batter is cooked enough to flip the pancake. On these, because of the batter's runniness, that didn't happen. I burned the first two before I figured that out. Just check the underside of the pancake after two minutes and if the color looks good, flip it. The top will still be runny when you're supposed to flip them, but they'll turn out good (and won't have runny insides).

I have loved this recipe for years! When I recently became Vegan, my husband was worried that he wouldn't be getting these pancakes again. I just swapped out the egg for Vegan Egg and used soymilk for both milks, and it still turned out great! I also used equal parts buckwheat, oats, and whole wheat and added in blueberries.

Loved these pancakes with the additional of 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 cup of applesauce (in addition to the oil).  Sadly, my children did not like them.

For me, these pancakes get a five star rating with one simple change.  Reduce the oats and the whole wheat flour to 3/4 cup each.  Leave the rest of the ingredients the same.  I also finely chop the walnuts in the food processor and add 3 T finely chopped slivered almonds.  With these changes they taste practically identical to the Harvest Grain and Nut Pancakes I love so much at the famous restaurant.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The leftover batter saves well in the fridge to use later in the week. Love this recipe!

Take this recipe, swap the amounts of baking soda and baking powder (1tsp of soda and 2tsps of powder), leave out the nuts and throw in a half cup of sprouted wheat berries and you have the most amazing delicious pancakes. Pair these with the cinnamon syrup recipe from this site and you'll never do pancakes any other way again.

These were good. Next time I may try using applesauce and yogurt for some of the oil and buttermilk. I always have an issue with pancakes in that the first batch is nice and thick but the rest are thin. Not sure why this happens.

I doubled this recipe.  This recipe made a LOT of pancakes.  And I thought they were good & moist.  We live in NC.  My 3 kids liked them too.  I doubled the recipe so I'd have enough to freeze.  I usually do this with the good old fashioned recipe from this site & I get about 16-18 pancakes total.  I used an ice cream scoop to ladle them out, so these are about 4" pancakes.  My family was full after 12 of these pancakes.  I still have 28 pancakes left over to freeze!  I used almond milk/lemon juice to sub for buttermilk, used applesauce for oil (quadrupled the amount to 1 cup) & I did throw in an extra egg, but our eggs were a little on the small side, so I'd say that would probably equal 2 jumbo grocery store eggs.  I thought the batter was a little thin at first, but it worked fine.  Just be sure to use your extra big bowl if you double this!

These are wonderful!  I did not have whole wheat flour this morning so I used white, but they were light and kind of crunchy with a good nutty flavor.

I will never make “traditional” pancakes again!  
I added vanilla, an extra egg, flax seed and used both walnuts and pecans!  Absolutely delicious!   :)

They were very tasty. I made a few substitutions. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour because I didn't want them too grainy. I then used 1 cup of eggnog instead if milk because I didn't want to throw it away. I'm the only one who drinks it. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla, both for flavoring. I did not add the nuts because everyone I my house don't care for nuts. My son doesn't like changes and he had more. They turned out great. They were quite moist. I will definitely make them again.

Was out of soda (what!) so just upped the baking powder to 3 tsp.  Used Splenda instead of sugar.  Added 2 TBS. egg substitute, also.  Instead of syrup used two cups of frozen mixed fruit that I simmered with 1/3 C of water, a splash of vanilla and maple flavorings.  It put a smile on my hubby's face.  Looking forward to having just a couple with eggs tomorrow was his comment.  Very satisfying.

Delicious! I make blueberry compote to go with these pancakes instead of syrup (similar to IH*P).  I also usually chop some almonds to mix with the walnuts. This is my favorite pancake recipe!

I made these according to the recipe and they turned out great! Only I used coconut oil. However I didn't feel that they tasted like IHOP, the ones at IHOP are more grainy. That being said my husband thinks they taste like graham crackers, he loves graham crackers.
The recipe made 19, 1/4 C  pancakes.

These pancakes are AMAZING! After reading other reviews, I decided to add an extra egg. I usually choose pecans over walnuts, but the walnuts (chopped small) are the perfect texture in this recipe. Also, my mother-in-law doesn't usually care for whole wheat anything...she said she likes these pancakes better than her regular ones.

Loved it and best of all hubby and kids did too! I made a couple of changes, however. I substituted milk and lemon juice for buttermilk as someone had commented before because I did not have buttermilk. That worked fine. I also used 2 tablespoons of stevia in replace of 1/3 cup of sugar and I added half a mashed banana for added sweetness. Finally I found that I had to drop the heat down a bit after each batch. This helped to keep them moist and to not burn. Super yummy I will be making them again!

These are pretty good. I did cut the recipe to 4 servings and use a large egg, after reading the reviews. I added some cinnamon, nutmeg and ground flax seed since I didn't have any walnuts. My family enjoyed them and they were definitely more healthy than the standard buttermilk pancakes!!

I did not care for this recipe. I make buttermilk pancakes from scratch using the Betty Crocker recipe at least once per month. I thought I would try this one for the added whole grains. 

If I try this again, I'd use 3 eggs, flip the baking powder to soda ratios, use brown sugar instead of white (more complimentary to wheat flours), start with 2 cups buttermilk and add more for desired consistency. I'd use 6 tablespoons of oil and eliminate the milk.

I loved the fact of not using white flour at all, i subbed the sugar for stevia and apple sauce for oil that made calorie lighter and I kept the other ingredients as in recipe. Fantastic flavor and healthy! What more would you wish for yourself and your family

These are so good that I've enthusiastically shared the recipe with family.  This year I've mixed the dry ingredients (reducing soda to 1 1/2 teasp) and shared it as a gift at Christmas with a note with the full recipe after it, the nuts (soaked in boiling water a minute,a few times to remove the bitter taste, but not peeled then toasted at 300 for 15-20 minutes) in a separate bag.  The note says:  
With love from our house to yours.  
------ and --------
These are our favorite pancakes. We hope they become yours.
DIRECTIONS for this mix:
Just add 2 eggs, beaten, ¼ cup oil, 1 cup milk AND 1½ cup buttermilk or yogurt or milk + 1 TBSP vinegar to mix. The whole recipe is below for future reference.

These turned out great and so fluffy! I altered the recipe for 2 servings which is a great option if you aren't cooking for 12. It automaticly makes all the adjustments for you. No need to put 3/8 of an egg. I just addded the whole thing and also added 2 Tbsp of groud flax seed to add all of those healthy omega-3s!!:)

Okay so I made these for the third time today.  The first two times I followed the recipe exactly.  They were okay but not great.  I changed a few things this time and they were perfect.  If you are looking for super light and fluffy pancakes you will only get that with white flour.  These are great considering they are made with oats and wheat flour.  These are the changes I made:

I put the walnuts in the blender with the oats because my kids don't like the texture of the nuts in there.  I added 1/2 cup of applesauce and only 2 tbsp. of oil.  I used the 1.5 cups of buttermilk but I used 1 cup of water in place of the other cup of milk.  I used 2 eggs.  The most important thing I think is that I made the batter the night before and let it sit in the fridge so the oats and wheat flour had time to absorb the liquid.  They are thick and fluffy and not as dry.

If I were to rate the original recipe, I have to give it four stars.  I used apple sauce instead of oil.  They were great!  I froze the extra and have enjoyed through through the week reheating in a toaster over for 15 minutes, just like when they were made.  I have these with a nice layer of vanilla yogurt on them (I don't care for syrup), I really enjoyed the walnuts in the recipe.  I would add a few more walnuts next time.

I cut the proportions to make 4 pancakes, but still used 1 egg and they came out perfect.  I love IHOP's nut and grain pancakes and now I can make them at home.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.

Great flavor... so much better than a box mix and easy to make. I halved all ingredients except the egg; this made 10 4" pancakes. Plenty for me and my husband. I use pecans rather than walnuts in pancakes, and I added 1/2 Tbsp of ground flax seed for health benefits. Keeper!

In effort to keep this recipie as natural and healthy as possible I omitted the sugar and replaced it with honey. I used 2% milk for milk and buttermilk. No buttermilk? Add one tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then, add milk until the amount reaches one cup. Let the mixture stand at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. It should look curdled. Stir and you have homemade buttermilk! I cut the wheat flour down to one cup and added a half cup of flax seed meal. I switched the veg oil to olive oil. Served with a little maple syrup on top and they were perfect!

I liked these very much!  I did make some changes, though. I used Greek yogurt in place of buttermilk, and I used applesauce instead of oil.  And since the batter was very thick, I used extra applesauce and extra milk to make it thinner.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of orange peel and a teaspoon of vanilla for taste. And, I added some blueberries! Very yummy!

I've never had the Harvest Nut n' Grain pancakes, so didn't have anything to compare to.  The flavor of these was really nice but oh my were they CRUMBLY!  I'd have been better off with a bowl and spoon, eating syrup soaked crumbs.  The only things I changed were to use olive oil and I forgot to add nuts.  I don't know if I'll make again.  They weren't spectacular enough to leave a big impression.

An awesome recipe once you add one more egg, a bit of cinnamon and some almond extract.

flavor is good but too many leavening agents. it doesn't need so much. they were very awkward to flip and the batter was too thick. don't know when i'll make it again, but would cut out soda completely, i think.

These are like Harvest Grain 'n Nut pancakes, but much better!  Since our arid climate keeps the moisture content of flour very low, I was concerned about some comments saying the pancakes were dry or heavy.  I added 1/2 cup additional buttermilk (reducing the plain milk to 1/2 cup) and added another egg.  The pancakes were delicious, moist, and light but substantial enough to accommodate the heartiness of the whole grains and nuts. Great reviews from all the family members, even those not fond of nuts in baked goods.

My family really likes these pancakes!  I have made them twice now and my 3 year old daughter can't get enough.  I took the advice of a few other reviewers and used applesauce instead of the oil.  Also, I did not have buttermilk on hand and used the subsitution of milk and lemon juice.
The second time I made them, I used a quarter cup less oatmeal and added flaxseed for that amount then ground both ingredients together.  As a final touch, I added blueberries to mixture.  I did not add the nuts due to allergies.

Thanks for recipe!

I think the base recipe is spot on but the walnuts detract from it.  Try substituting sliced almonds and chopped pecans instead.  The amount is up to you. YUM!!!

I too added one extra egg. Also substituted vanilla almond milk for milk, applesauce for oil, and pecans instead of walnuts. Added cinnamon.  Next time I will try agave syrup instead of sugar. Mixture was runny at first but thickened after standing a couple minutes before cooking.  placed blueberries on pancakes while in the skillet. Top with banana and more cin

I loved it and my family loved it. I didn't have oatmeal so I substituted it with baby oatmeal cereal. (Actually was really good.) I accidently added 1/3c of oil. I misread the recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp of pure vanilla and used fat free milk. Half the batter had crushed nuts and the other half had a few chocolate chips added to each pancake on the griddle. Yummy!

These are fantastic! This is the best whole-wheat pancake recipe I've found, and I've tried several. After having these, I never want to eat white flour pancakes again. 5 stars with these alterations: add 1 tsp. each vanilla and cinnamon, and use 2 eggs. I also subbed fat-free yogurt for the buttermilk and pecans for walnuts, because that's what I had on hand, and they turned out fine. I cook the whole batch and save leftovers to reheat in the toaster.

The pancakes were good, but not nutty enough for me, so the second time I made them, I added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans instead of the walnuts and replaced the 1/4 oil with an extra 1/4 buttermilk, then they were great.

I just made this recipe and it turned out really good. I substituted instant oatmeal and it still turned out great. I had fresh strawberries substitute that for walnuts but the taste and texture of the pancake was really good. It is going in the recipe box.

YUMMY!  I am moving cross country soon, so am using up whatever I have in the house. Therefore I couldn't follow the recipe exactly. So I had no buttermilk, and just used milk.  I used my last 2 eggs, and added about 1/4 C of wheat germ(I'm trying to use it all up before I move!).  Also, I used 1/2 C of applesauce instead of oil. We finished off our maple syrup-one less thing to move! I served them with sliced bananas, and all 3 kids loved them, so it is a keeper!  Thanks!!

These are truly the BEST pancakes!  They are so moist and flavorful.  My husband thought I was crazy for doubling the recipe.  He said there was no way the kids would eat "brown" pancakes.  Was he ever wrong!  My 8 & 10 year olds told me they were the best pancakes...EVER!  I didn't change a thing...just doubled it.  Thank you!

First time making wheat pancakes and loved this recipe.  I did make a few alterations because we are trying to eat healthier and they turned out great.  Substituted 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce for all of oil, added splash of vanilla, used 1/2 sugar - 1/2 splenda, didn't have walnuts so I used pecans.  Very yummy!

Very nice recipe!  I didn't have buttermilk so I just used regular milk, and I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of the white, plus a pinch of cinnamon.  I topped them with some strawberry sauce that I made and it was a great dinner.  Didn't even need anything else to go with them because they were so hearty and filling!

Fantastic!  I've been looking for a REAL whole wheat pancake recipe for a while, and the first one listed on this site includes bleached all-purpose flour - what's the point of that?  Anyways, I gave this one a try and added fresh blueberries, and it was the best breakfast dish I've ever made!  They were moist, fluffy, and had a terrific flavor - the blueberries made them perfect, but I think they'd be great as is.  Thanks for the recipe!

The best whole wheat pancake recipe I've tried! No buttermilk, so used lemon juice and milk. I halved the recipe and added one over-ripe mashed banana-- DELICIOUS!!!

These were okay.  I used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk, and STILL had too much liquid in the batter.  I'll probably make them again, just because they're healthier than the white flour version.

These were fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with no problems.  I let the batter sit for a few minutes before making the pancakes and they were moist and delicious!

Would give it a 4.5 if I could :)  4 stars because the batter was difficult to spread out, but 5 stars because the husband loved it.  Will definitely make it again and am passing the recipe along!

Fabulous recipe. I used splenda in place of the sugar and threw in some frozen blueberries too. The batter was thick and I had to spread it out but the results were great. Moist, nutty and the flavor of the oats, walnuts and berries was delicious. This is one recipe that I am printing out and passing on to family and friends!

Does IHOP really serve anything this delicious?? Like other reviewers, I used yogurt and applesauce in place of buttermilk and oil.  I also replaced the sugar with 1/4 cup honey.  I had a bit of a problem flipping them, until I took the advice of another reviewer and made them small enough so that the whole pancake fit on my spatula.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe-- I modified with applesauce and fat-free milk with some evaporated to replace buttermilk, egg, and sugar and it turned out superyummy and healthier too!

Not too bad. I was hoping for a fluffier thicker pancake, however the texture was great. I was low on oatmeal so I had to substitute 1/2 cornmeal. I also added just a bit of cinnamon. My kids enjoyed them and they usually hate it when I "healthy up" a favorite.

Great taste but way too liquid.  I had a lot of trouble flipping them over, even though the first side was starting to burn.  I added a bit more flour to the rest of the batter which helped a little.

This recipe was fun to make, but the pancakes were very heavy and not fluffy like I hope pancakes will be.  They were very good cold as a snack, not so much hot for breakfast.

Very good.  My two year old scarfed them down.  We had no issues with flipping them, but my hubby is a pro.  He's made many types and these were good.  He though they were just okay.  I am sure we'll have them again.  We did not use the nuts.

I didn't care for these, nor did my daughter, but my son (2) gobbled them up! I had to add an extra 1/3 c. of flour than the revised recipe because they were still too thin (and very hard to turn over).  A bit dense and overwhelming for me.  Next time I'd add a bit of white flour to tone it down a bit, and definitely some of the suggestions to add flavor.  And don't try to make these super large - they fall apart if you try to turn them!

These are now the only pancakes we make--they are wonderful!  I added blueberries and cut back on the sugar just a little since we put a little syrup on them anyway.  My family loves them.  Thanks!

GREAT! I too use less milk & buttermilk (about 1 1/2 c total) and sometimes a bit more oatmeal and/or wheat flour (up to 1 C each).  I also add 2 Tblsp wheat germ and a mashed banana.  This is an EXCELLENT and easy recipe for pancakes.  They taste a bit like banana bread.  You will never want boxed mix again!

The batter was way too runny.  I tried to cook it anyway but it was fried mush.  After I added an additional 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, the pancakes came out great with a delicious flavor.

these pancakes are the best. The only adjustments I did different was to not use the milk. I just used buttermilk because they were thin enough without adding the extra milk. I also used a natural sweetner instead of the sugar and for extra fiber I used 2tabsp of wheat germ. Have made these several times and will continue to do so.
