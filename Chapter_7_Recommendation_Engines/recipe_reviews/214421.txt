Very tasty recipe. The flavour of the mayo mixture didn't absorb deep into the grilled chicken like a marinade, but was more of a dipping sauce. Still a very good dish, but not quite 5 star. I would also recommend using light mayo as a healthier alternative.

I marinated the chicken about 1/2 hrs first  The only other change I  made was to use low fat miracle whip.  Very nice and tangy.  I think the cilantro is a must!   I added a bit of water and heated the extra marinate, served with basmati rice and poured sauce over it.

I should have thought about the recipe and not just gone based on reviews.  It is mayo and cilantro caked on chicken.  I marinated it and it didn't soak in (as mentioned in the reviews), but then just tasted like chicken dipped in mayo (miracle whip is what I used).

Simple and tasty... instead of using ground beef for our taco salad, we used the chicken instead. Sprinkled some tortilla chips on top... dinner's ready! Great recipe!

We love this, and it's so easy.  By mistake I bought mayonnaise (Kraft...shhh...don't tell!) that already had lime in it (huh?), so didn't put the lime juice in and it worked out fine.

Excellent recipe! the leftover marinade worked great as a dip for grilled mushrooms, green peppers, and yellow squash!

I followed the recipe but I did not care for it. It tasted way too mayonnaisey and didn't have enough of the other flavors.  I even used a little extra cilantro because I had chopped too much. Very disappointing.
