I made this for lunch for 5 of my friends while we were away scrapbooking. WOW! They all loved it and I had to make more. The only thing I will do different is double the dressing. It is really good and I wanted to taste it all over the spinach as well as the tortellini. I have saved this to my recipe box.
Thanks Pam...loving Cooknik too! :)
