A fast and easy summer time appetizer. Couldn’t find fresh mint so left it out. Biggest challenge was the feta cheese crumbling when trying to get on the stick, hence the 4 out of 5 rating. Was enjoyed by all.

Made these for a baby shower and could’ve eaten the whole platter by myself! They were a wonderful taste sensation. A very light and delicious addition. The only problem we had was that the feta wanted to crumble and we lost a lot of it. If anyone comes up with a way to keep that from happening, please let me know! Otherwise, they were perfect! Thank you!!
