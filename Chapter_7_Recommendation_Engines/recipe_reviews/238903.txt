I cut this recipe down to fit our needs, and we thought this needed a little more flavor--maybe more of the onion.  I did follow the recipe as written.  It did make a nice salad dressing for my husband, and we did eat all those veggies I photo'd drenched with this, so we were happy!  Thanks, Alicia!

On Easter morning I was preparing a crudite platter and planned to take a short cut using Marie's ranch dressing as the dip only to find an almost empty jar.  I raced to the computer and found this recipe on Allrecipes.com.  It saved the day!  The only change I made was to use fresh parsley that I had chopped and stored in the freezer.  Everyone liked it!

I've been bringing a recipe nearly identical to this to gatherings for nearly 20 years now. I add seasoning salt instead of plain salt. And I love dill, so  probably triple what's called for here when making it just for me at home. Happy to see this recipe here, since I'm always being asked for it. Thanks!!!

Made exactly as said, but used fresh parsley from the garden.
Really good with both chips and veggies. Thanks for the recipe!

I used cilantro instead of parsley and didn't actually measure anything except the mayo/sour cream and it came out great!

I pretty much followed the recipe but I did add non fat Fage plain Greek yogurt and doubled the recipe substituting Greek yogurt. It was a huge hit at the party I made it for and favored over two other dips!

I was looking for something different to dip chicken tenders in, and this was perfect because I had all the necessary ingredients. I didn't change anything, and it was a great dip for chicken tenders, and a nice change from honey mustard or barbecue sauce. I would definitely make it again, and also use for a veggie dip.

Made this as directed and we loved it. So much better than the usual "Ranch" style dip. Thanks!

Excellent. You can whip this up in under 5 minutes. I used onion powder instead of minced onion and added some celery salt. Quick, easy, very good!

Have made this so many times. Used fresh dill and parsley from the garden. Just excellent! Although the cooks notes say not to use fresh onion, I do, and everyone prefers it that way. A sweet onion works best here.

This was perfect!  Served with broccoli, zucchini, carrots, red peppers, and cauliflower.  I omitted the salt & pepper.

This is a nice mild dip that's fine as is, but would also lend itself well to tweaking for whatever you are serving it with.
