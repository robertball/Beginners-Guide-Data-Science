There are so many good things about this recipe. The mayo sauce is amazing, which is good because you'll have loads left over. Adding cabbage to a sloppy whatever is a great idea, the flavor and texture are excellent. Adding an egg on top is pure genius. Try this and you'll cheat on Joe, without feeling any guilt.  Thank you for the recipe.

So yummy! I've made this multiple times & there's so much flavor + plenty for leftovers.  Normally we leave the basil spread out because we don't have the ingredients on hand and we're lazy but it's still delicious!

Wonderful flavors!  My family ate it up and never asked what was in it.  The second time I made it, I used ground turkey instead of ground beef - Just as delicious.
This will be an repeat dish for sure

I made this roughly following this recipe.  I did not add the brown sugar and i diced the jalapeno and added it to the skillet with onion while browning the meat.  It was very flavorful.
