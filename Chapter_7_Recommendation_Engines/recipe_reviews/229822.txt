When I make this salad, I like to throw in a clove of fresh minced garlic. If you can stand it, throw this together and let it sit for an hour. NOTE: This is also just as good with a quality balsamic vinegar.

Fresh, delicious combination of flavors! I made it just a half-hour before dinner, and using several types of cherry tomatoes (orange, yellow, red) halved, and tripled the recipe. Great alternative to the classic salad of greens.

So simple, yet so delicious! I had some fresh garden tomatoes from my neighbor and this was the perfect way to use them up. I opted for white wine vinegar and a little sea salt along with some fresh minced garlic. Perfect with warm crusty bread!

Loved this recipe! Took one cook's suggestion and used balsamic vinegar (my favorite) instead of red wine. Also, didn't use salt but added crumbled feta cheese..nummy!

Very nice tomato salad.  I did not make changes but might add some chopped walnuts next time for an added crunch.
