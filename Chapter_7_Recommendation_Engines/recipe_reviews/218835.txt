This is a perfect recipe to use as a side for something that is a little lacking in flavor because this has LOTS of flavor!  Lots!  I do think I would have liked it a little moister, but that's so easy to take care of by adding a little more liquid.  I did use red bell pepper rather than green, and I used the white wine option.  I cut it down to one-fourth the recipe, and it was ready after about 25 minutes in the oven.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks, Johnsonville!
