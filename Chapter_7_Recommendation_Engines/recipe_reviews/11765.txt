Great alternative to chicken and veal.  I seasoned the cubed steak with salt and garlic powder, then I dipped in 2 beaten eggs so the breading would stick.  Quickfrying with the garlic in the olive oil gives it a great flavor.  I think I will use a more substantial pasta than angel hair next time.  Might be fun with bowties.  Family loved it - will definitely do it again.

To me, this was just a different version of spaghetti.  Family REALLY liked it but they are spaghetti lovers. I also thought it was tasty but I was hoping for something a little more unique. Used red bell peppers instead of green, added fresh sliced mushrooms and 4 blend Italian cheese. Either way, my family begs me to make this one again, although I will never serve to guests. Still good! Thanks Lorrie

I followed the hint and left the prepared dish in the refrigerator overnight!  The meat was very tender, flavorful.  I will use this recipe often!  I did add 1 Tablespoon of fresh chopped Sweet Basil to the sauce.

Ever since i read this recipe I cook this meal atleast once a week! Ive changed things up a bit, but i still want to thank you! 
Heres what i did:
I take the cube steaks and dip them in egg, and then coat with the parmesan cheese, then garlic, and then the breadcrumbs. 
Then I fry them in oil till the are cooked, and top with fried onions.
Then I make the pasta on the side. I use rotini noodles, and top them with butter, garlic, and parmesan cheese.
Its so good.
I felt this was a quicker way to make YOUR recipe, and is still delicious. Let me know if you try it!

GREAT!! I dipped the cube steaks in flour then egg and then the breadcrumb mixture so it would stick better. I also cooked the green pepper and onions in the tomato sauce before putting on top of the steaks. I also substituted linguine for the angel hair although I am sure the angel hair would have been just as wonderful! My hubby gives this a 25 out of 5. Thank you for sharing!

Very good, I dipped the steaks in Italian dressing before coating them, the garlic in the pan when browning the meat started to burn so I wouldn't put it in the pan next time. The pasta is very good with the garlic and butter in it. I added extra herbs, garlic, and mushrooms to the spaghetti sauce.

I changed the recipe significantly for ease and to avoid using prepared sauce which has too many added ingredients (sugar and salt) . . . I use round steak instead of cube steak (not as tough, and easier to handle) dredged in egg and then bread crumbs combined with parmesan cheese.  After browning the steaks in olive oil, add 1/2 c. chopped onion, one can tomato paste (again for richness of taste) and 1 tomato paste can full of water to the skillet drippings.  Blend well and cover steaks--eliminate spaghetti sauce.  Bake the same as this recipe indicates.  Fast, easy and more flavorful in my opinion.

Wow. My fiance and I loved this dish.  I chopped the veggies up because we don't like big pieces of pepper. I also used NY Strip steak cubes, so it was very tender.  Next time, I'll definitely put more meat in because we were fighting each other over the last few pieces of steak :)  This was excellent w/ 4-cheese spaghetti sauce (I forget which brand)

Great recipe!  I did make a few changes though.  I omitted the onions and peppers and used garlic powder instead of fresh.  Instead of a jarred sauce, I just made a batch of my usual spaghetti sauce (minus the meat of course).  I actually pan fried the meat until done before putting it in the oven since that took less time.  I did not use the full amount of sauce either...just enough to cover the top of each piece of meat.  It was really very good and I will make this again.  I served it wath a side of one of those boxed noodle mixes (angel hair pasta with garlic and parmesan sauce)

I had my doubts at first, but this turned out great!  Very tasty.  I just used regular spaghetti, but served it lightly buttered on the side.  Even my 5 year old loved it!

This was actually really good, I was actually surprized! I used red bell pepper instead of green (we don't care for green peppers), and Muir Glen roasted tomato pasta sauce that I gussied up with a little basil, oregano and a glug of red wine. What I did was quickly brown the breaded cube steak and layered it at the bottom of my baking dish, then sauteed the onion, a few cloves of garlic and the red pepper in a little EVOO to get the flavors hummin', then added the pasta sauce, the basil/oregano and the red wine. I let it simmer for a sitch, then poured it over the cube steaks. Because I had to leave the house for a bit, I covered it and let it go in the oven 85 minutes, but I think that just made it more flavorful. I just took the foil off when I got home so some of the extra moisture could evaporate. I still can't believe this recipe. I'm quite impressed. Both my husband and I weren't expecting much but it really was quite good. It fed my husband, two kids and I well for next to nothing and it really was cheap to make. It also bends well to suit your family's tastes, which I appreciate.

This is on the regular menu rotation at our house now.  My husband calls it "fancy spaghetti".  I call it easy to make.  My picky kids don't like onions or peppers...so I just leave them out.  Thank you!!

Pretty good and easy to make. The baby enjoyed the Garlic Pasta. We left out the Green Peppers just because we don't care for them and I think the next time I'll leave out the onions. I was a bit dissapointed that the cube steaks weren't very coated but next time I might dip it in egg or milk first before I put the breadcrumbs on. Thanks Lorrie for submitting this!

This was a simple and tasty recipe.  I found the meat a little "chewy" but that is to be expected with cube steak.  It was a nice change for my red sauce loving family.

Fantastic! Very flavorful! I always doctor my sauce with garlic, dried red pepper and oregano. I simmer my sauce for an hour or so prior to serving. I did that with this recipe as well then baked it as per directions. I also used red and orange peppers instead of green. My family loved this recipe. Will definitely use again.

This was delicious. I made this with a friend at her house with her & her boyfriend and they loved it. The only thing we did a bit different was that we sauteed the onions & bell peppers in the pan after we sauteed and removed the meat. It made them nice and tender and tasty.

Added hint for tender beef. Cook cubed beef chunks in slow cooker with spag. sauce poured over the top for 8 hours on low. Then take the beef out and toss in bread crumbs and parm. cheese then continue on from there. Yum!

Yummy! This was great the next day too.  I was out of onion so I added more garlic - worked fine.  I did not add the butter, I just served the meat over the pasta. This was a big hit with my daughter too.  This will be made again.

This was pretty good.....Definitely either do it the day before or marinade the steak, the meat was sort of tough but the meat cooked in sauce gave the sauce good flavor.

My family and I loved this dish but there were a few things that I had to change to make it good.  First, cooking the minced garlic for 3 minutes will burn it.  Try putting a smashed clove in the oil on low heat for a few, then remove it to brown the meat.  Also, I baked mine for an hour and the onions and peppers were still crispy.  Ick.  I covered and baked for 15 minutes more and only then was it done.  I definitely plan on covering from start to finish next time.  And I dunno about anyone else but my pasta was dry even with the recommended amount of butter.  I had to add about 1/3 c of the water the pasta boiled in to make it saucier without adding additional butter.   Overall great flavor!

I don't tend to make cube steak because its texture.  I had some in the freezer from a side of beef I bought and made this a day in advance of serving.  It was great! I wouldn't do anything different.  I have another pack in the refrigerator and I will definately make this again!

OMG this was so good !!!! everyone loved it, i used two 26- oz cans of sauce though, and added lots more mozzarella - we had none left. The recipe does not specify to remove the garlic from the pan before adding the meat but i did so it would not burn and give the recipe a burned taste - i will definitely make this again. thanks lorrie !!!

Really easy to make. And tastes great. I followed the recipe exactly and was worried there wouldn't be enough tomato sauce..but everything was proportionate. I will be making this again. Thanks so much for the recipe!

My husband and I thought this was great. I took other reviewers' suggestions and seasoned the cubed steak with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before the bread crumbs/cheese mixture. I didn't have to use nearly as much of the bread crumb/cheese mixture as the recipe called for so next time I'll cut that in half just so I don't waste it.

I've made this recipe for years (minus the garlic and using about 1/4 cup minced onion instead because of allergies), and it can be tasty. Not as good as veal parmesan, of course, but when we were young, married, college students, this was a good cheap way of eating a substitute for the real thing.

I enjoy this and so did my family.  The flavor was really good, though I omitted the green peppers because I don't care for them much, and I also marinated the beef in garlic salt and pepper.  The only thing I didn't like about this were the bite size beef.  I think this recipe would be much better if you used ground beef, made those into bite size meatballs, then coated them in bread crumbs.  I'm going to try it this way next time.

Excellent!  Great recipe!  Easy to prepare. Added a little extra parmesan, Italian Seasoning and garlic in the sauce while baking.  I'm going to add fresh mushrooms next time around!  Was a hit with the entire family.  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for something different to do with cube steak & this was really good. I reduced the prep time by using Prego Chunky Garden sauce which already had chunks of pepper & onion in it. Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  Something different from the usual chicken parmesan.  I had some left over so I froze it to see how it would do.  I had it for lunch today and it was good...not as good as when it is fresh, though.

I just found a good use for cube steak. My husband gives this a weak 5 stars. It was good. Forgot to put on the onions and didn't have any bell pepper.  It was still really good. Not a dish to have all the time because of the high fat content but that's what makes it so good.

The ingredients in this recipe do not produce a very pleasant-tasting dish.  The cube steak simply does not taste good when combined with Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese and the Italian bread crumbs.  I was hoping to find a new use for cube steak ... this recipe, unfortunately, is not a keeper.

i dont know, maybe its me, but this recipe left me not impressed. i followed all the directions ( marinated it over night) of course i added more garlic( thats my signature spice)but the final outcome was a dud. i could have added more cheese but i dont think that would have been beneficial, tha taste just was not there for me. oh well, on to the next recipe. NOT A KEEPER.   sorry,  (this was my first not a keeper)

This was ok to me; a lot of work for a combo of spaghetti and a parmesean dish. When cooking, I didn't think I'd bother making it again but my kids really liked it, they asked for seconds which is why I'll give it 4 stars vs 3. Also, I had to add twice the amount of garlic onto the pasta to give it any flavor. All in all it was just average.

This was delicious and simple to make.  I love cube steak but never could find recipes for it.  This recipe helped it to not be tough and the spaghetti sauce made it nic eand juicy.

This wasn't difficult to make.  I had all the ingredients on hand and decided to try it tonight since I had off from work and nothing better to do with my time.  It was tasty and my family enjoyed it.  I thought it was average and that some of our other pasta sauces had more punch.  I did add more italian seasoning and some garlic powder to the italian seasoned breadcrumbs because I wanted more flavor.  I also added more of the cheese and breadcrumb mixture to the top of the sauce when it went into the oven.  This was decent but I was expecting spectacular.

This was really great.  I only baked it for 25 minutes and the beef was perfectly tender.

The flavor of the dish wasn't bad, but I didn't love the cube steak at all, not even the next day.  I'm sure I would love this dish with chicken or regular ground beef.

Recipes like this make you LOVE this website!  I didn't use the bell pepper because we don't like it and used venison cube steak instead of beef.  Absolutely fabulous!  Will make this a lot in the future!

This recipe was easy to make...BUT...it was very unflavorful.  You could not even taste the garlic(even with the added garlic powder).  I'm not sure if it was the sauce I used, but it was VERY watery.  Not a single person in my family liked this.  I will not even bother experimenting with the recipe in the future.

Delicious.  The only thing I did different was to leave out the onion and peppers (only because I didn't have them on hand).  I will make this again.

Definitely a great recipe.  I changed it up a lil bit because I'm not really a fan of angel hair pasta.  I used fettucine instead and served it with a Malibu Bay Breeze.  Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!

This was a delicious way to prepare cube steak.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it.  I left off the onions and peppers in one corner of the pan for my little boys.  And I also tossed in some chopped portobello mushrooms.  I omitted the butter and garlic on the pasta and added more sauce since I am cutting calories.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was a wonderful dish. The only thing I would do differently next time is not use regular eggs. Great substitution for veal parmesan lovers.

No complaints at the table and all of it was gobbled up.  I think next time instead of the rings of pepper and onions I would slice and make a bit smaller.

Served this at a dinner party last weekend. went over very well. I acually forgot to add the mozerella, but nobody complained. I used a recipe for garlic butter I found on this site to roll the pieces in, and to toss the pasta with and that worked out great.
