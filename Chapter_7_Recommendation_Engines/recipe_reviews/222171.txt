Very tasty.  Instead of topping the chicken with the mayonnaise mixture, I smeared it all over the chcken and then dropped the pieces into a baggie with the crumb mixture and shook to coat.  Doing it this way was somewhat messy, but the result was yummy.

Once you try this you will never just bread chicken again.  Truly moist on the inside and light crunch to the coating.I rubbed mixture all over then fully coated in bread crumbs.

We loved this chicken. It was truly nice and moist and crispy on the outside.  I halved the recipe because I only used to chicken breasts.  A keeper for me!

Simply amazing! Hard to believe something this easy could be this good.


I did follow the advice of others:

1. Sliced large breasts in half.
2. Mixed parmesan cheese and Italian breadcrumbs.
3. Put mayo on breasts, then dredged through cheese and breadcrumb mix.
4. Placed on cookie sheet (not in a pan). Let sit for about 30 mins before putting in oven (I believe this allowed chicken to absorb the mayo a little, I had no trouble with grease.)
5. Took out of oven after 18 mins; covered with about 2T of marina sauce and generous handful of shredded mozzarella cheese and put it back in oven until cheese melted. Served on top of spaghetti.

This was easy to make, tasty and quick too!  I will make this again.  I didn't have a problem with it being too dry or too greasy.  We put it on top of spaghetti and marinara for an easy chicken parm meal.

Moist yes, but greasy! Way to much mayo, and mine did not get crispy on the outside like in the picture. Way too many calories and fat just to get moist chicken.

Love this recipe. We butterfly the breast so they are thinner. When I first tried the recipe I made it exactly as suggested. I now use panko instead of regular breadcrumbs (usually what I have on hand). Also add a bit of garlic to the mayo/parmesan mixture and I add pepper to the chicken before smearing the mayo mixture (no salt, already enough in the mayo and cheese). You don't necessarily have to use as much of the mixture. Just enough to cover the breast. Really yummy.

I make this with chicken thighs skin on as the juiciness of the skin gives so much flavour.  I also season with Chicken seasonings.  Been making this for years and it is always a hit, specially first timers who try it.

Very easy and quick recipe. I use thin sliced chicken breasts and bake a t 350 degrees. I also substitute ranch dressing for the mayonnaise. It was flavorful and moist.

Used skinless bone in chicken breasts.  Used Panko bread crumbs and mixed a little Mrs. Dash in with the bread crumbs.  Excellent.  Will used again.

Was not expecting something so simple to be so freaking tasty. I've made a lot of dinners off this website, with 5 stars, but this one blew all the other ones out of the water. I tried it and was overwhelmed, and let my man try it before I said anything, and he commented on it too. So I'm happy:) One thing though-I couldn't get it crispy! Will have to figure that out.

I LOVED this recipe! I'm 20 years old and just moved in with my grandfather to help him out, but I really don't cook, so I appreciated how easy this recipe was. It turned out delicious and he loved it. I was so proud of myself for making a real and quality meal. Thank you thank you!

Way too much mayo.  Perhaps this dish would benefit from dipping the entire surface of the chicken breast in the mayo to coat evenly (and thinly,) as opposed to just topping each breast. The coating stayed wet and never crisped up. The meat was moist, but I couldn't even finish one piece as the unctuousness of such a large deposit of mayo, and the resulting slimy coating was quite unappealing. Honestly, all I could taste was mayo. Two tablespoons of it per piece was clearly the problem.  Maybe cutting that ingredient in half would work, but I was so turned off that even with that change, I can't bring myself to try this again. Edited to add: Finally got up the guts to tinker. Spread only a very thin coating (about 1 tsp) on each breast, then mixed the Parmesan and bread crumbs, rolling the pieces to coat them evenly. Baked them on a rack over a foil lined pan. Gone was the excessive mayonnaise taste, as well as the mushy coating. Conclusion: As written still 2 stars, but with the above changes, 4 stars.

This was a great easy recipe.  I didn't have bread crumbs though but I had pastashios.  So I shelled them, put them in the food processor to make crumbs, and used them in place of the bread crumbs. It added a really good flavor to the chicken.

Doubled the recipe because I used 8 skinless boneless chicken breasts.  Lightly sprayed 9"x13" pan with olive oil before placing breasts in.  Mine had a nice crusty top.  I didn't cover the pan while cooking.  Family loved it!! A keeper for a fast and easy dinner!!

I used half mayo and half Greek yogurt. Pounded out the breasts with the bottom of another pan, and then put it in the toaster oven at 425 for 15 minutes and broiled until bubbly and browned. Careful not to put too much if the mayo mixture on. There was a little crispy to it but didn't get crunchy like I wanted. Just a thin layer will do. Just enough to hold the bread crumbs. Served with some spagets and tomato sauce for an "easy chicken parm".

I've heard this mayo trick for years but never tried it until now.  REALLY sorry I waited so long.  Being on a low-carb diet, I made a few changes.  I used low-fat mayo and brushed just a thin layer on both sides, placing the breasts in a baking dish sprayed with Pam.  I topped them generously with grated parmesan and sprinkled on Greek Seasoning, salt, pepper and a little paprika...mostly for color.  To keep down the carbs, I used a bit of shredded parmesan for the topping instead of the breadcrumbs the recipe called for.  It baked up beautifully brown and so juicy inside...and so quick and easy.  My picky boyfriend RAVED about it.  As I was reading him this review, he said he wants to have it again tomorrow night!

Made this tonight because husband wanted chicken and I wanted spaghetti.  So easy and very good.  I accidentally left chicken in oven a little longer than I should, but the chicken was still very good!  I, too, only had regular bread crumbs, so I added garlic salt, pepper and oregano into mine (for flavor) and I also tried adding some sour cream to the mayo.  This is definitely a do again!! Thanks for a great and easy meal!! This is one of those recipes that you can add almost anything to it and it will be a hit!
(served with spaghetti and leftover spag sauce).

Very easy and delicious recipe! In an effort to be healthier, I used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo. It was so moist and delicious! I mixed the yogurt with shredded Parmesan and coated the chicken, then covered with breadcrumbs. I baked in a 9x9 pan (only cooked 2 breasts) with foil for 20 minutes and served with a side of sautéed butternut squash and green beans! Delicious!

go light on the mayo. I used panko bread crumbs and still only got a slight crunch. I would recommend cooking on a raised rack so the bottom of the chicken and the coating doesn't get soggy. I used the baggie method for coating with mayo and then another one for coating with bread crumbs and it worked out well. I also added some garlic powder to the mayo and to the breadcrumbs. My thought is that you can never have too much garlic. This definitely will give you very moist chicken and is forgiving of slight overcooking.

My husband loved this recipe.  I used just enough mayonnaise to coat the chicken to hold the crumbs.  Brushed it on with a brush.  Mix the Parmesan with the bread crumbs and press crumbs onto the chicken.  Bake as directed.  Quick, no fuss.

This was good but not great.  It does have potential.  I cut the chicken breasts in half horizontally and reduced the amount of mayonnaise.  To the mayonnaise, I added a bit of  onion powder, garlic powder, and dried oregano and also used panko and spritzed the top with EVOO from my mister.  Baked on a baking rack so the air would circulate underneath and not get soggy.  I coated both sides of the chicken breast and turned it about half way through cooking time.  I reduced the cooking time due to the thinness of the breast.  I turned the chicken again and turned the oven from bake to broil for a couple minutes to crisp it up more. Sliced on the diagonal and served with spaghetti with homemade marinara sauce.   I will make again but next time I think I will use even less mayonnaise and sear it quickly on both sides in the cast iron skillet before putting in the oven in the cast iron skillet.

I just made this tonight and the first words out my families mouth was “This is the juiciest chicken you’ve ever made!”  When I asked if this was “a keeper” the consensus was “Definitely!”I did add a teaspoon of garlic powder but otherwise I made it exactly as written.   Definitely on my list of easy dinners to make!!

I made this with 1 HUGE  Chicken breast using 4 tbsp. of mayo and 2 tbsp. of parmisan cheese and a little garlic powder. I coated both sides. It was delicious! Because the breast was so thick, I cooked it about 40 minutes at 425. I had no problem with it being greasy or wet.

I've made this many times since I first came across the recipe...I now use only a freshly grated mix of parmesan, reggiano and asiago...the deli in my grocery store will grate it for me to my specs...it gives this dish a whole new level of yumminess :)

I love this recipe!  I did substitute out the mayo and used fat free plain Greek yogurt instead to make it a bit healthier.  Chicken was moist and the Greek yogurt gave it a nice tang.  This is now one if my new favorite chicken recipes! I served it with some steamed fresh broccoli!

I make this all the time. Try adding a touch of mustard to the mayo and onion salt and garlic powder.  I also add a dash of smoked paprika.  My boys LOVE this so much I double the recipe.

It was great!!  I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs so added a garlic and herb mix to the the plain ones we had on hand and topped with a little more Parm after they were pulled out of the oven. She loved them.  Thank you

My family loved this. I only brushed on a little bit of the mayonnaise and used very little. Brushed on both sides then put breadcrumbs & cheese and it was awesome.

Pretty good....use a low fat mayo and it was not Hellman's....not sure if that really mattered or not. Also used a whole wheat bread crumb. Easy and pretty tasty. Thanks!

I seasoned the chicken with oregano and onion powder, first. I cut the mayo/parm mixture in half and it was enough to cover both sides of 4 chicken breast and 4 chicken thighs. I cooked it uncovered for 35 minutes because the chicken breasts were thick.

DO NOT SALT THE CHICKEN. It’s already a very salty dish. Take out at internal temp of 165° and don’t check it too often. Two breasts took me closer to 20-25 Going to the temp on the meat thermometer is for dark chicken. Otherwise a very good, if simple, dish. People who like more flavor may want to do more than just use a sprinkle of herbed breadcrumbs.

I've made this many times and it always turns out amazing.  the mayonnaise makes it juicy and tender, while the Parmesan cheese gives it a nice flavor and the breadcrumbs gives it a nice crunch.

make it, you won't regret it

Took it easy on the mayo (used it as a rub) and pressed the parmesan mixture into the chicken. Very moist and tasty and couldn't be any easier.

I made this for dinner tonight and all went for a second helping!!!  One thing I used as I found out I was out of breadcrumbs was Ritz crackers!!!  Just crushed almost a tube of them and added seasoned salt.  This is an extremely easy recipe and very very good!!!  Will definitely make this AGAIN????????

I simply smeared the mayo on the chicken, then sprinkled with the breadcrumbs and parmesan. 

Add squeezed lemon to the chicken first.

I made this chicken dish exactly as directed and it came out moist and crispy and delicious.  So wonderfully easy, I'm sure I will make again often.

Topping wasn't the best; wouldn't spread across the chicken pieces properly.

My kids love this (and they are very picky eaters)! Easy and quick and a family hit. I use the light mayonnaise and it still tastes great!

I love this recipe. I omit the bread crumbs because I simple don’t like the texture. What I do is that I add badia complete seasoning to the mix of mayo and cheese. Absolutely delicious.

This was so easy! I had just come home from a conference, arriving mid afternoon and was to have dinner guests that evening. This was the perfect dish. It was easy, I had the ingredients on hand, but it tasted like I'd put a lot of work into it. I did substitute part of the mayonnaise with light sour cream because I don't like a heavy mayonnaise taste. I probably could have put a lighter coat of the topping on as well. My guests and husband agreed. I need to make this again!

This dish was easy to make and delicious. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because it was a bit greasy. The next time I make it I will use half of the mayonnaise that is indicated in the recipe (1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup). I suspect it will come out equally tasty but just a little healthier.

this recipe was absolutely awful.
the "breading" whatever doesn't stick to the chicken so it basically falls off and you have naked baked chicken.  also... 20 minutes cooking time and the chicken was still raw.
sucks.  don't bother.  actually run

I cooked this one night after a long, hard day at work when I wanted easy to make and with very few ingredients. I was not disappointed. The chicken was crispy, yet moist,and the flavor was very tasty.

I absolutely love this recipe! I use plain bread crumbs and season them myself. I add grated parmesan to the breading mixture. I coat both sides of the chicken with the mayo mixture and bread crumbs. Be sure to dry off the chicken before spreading on the mayo - your chicken won't get soggy while it's cooking.

My husband was not really thrilled when I told him I wanted to try this recipe. I had told him I was going to make chicken parm with spaghetti which he was happy about. I gave it a shot despite his negative comments about using mayo as a base and boy am I glad I did! The chicken was moist and tasted great! It was so good my husband even said he was wrong... for once! I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

This recipe has great taste and was a rare winner with all four kids. I used Spice Islands crunchy panko seasoned coating mix for bread crumbs. It did take quite a bit longer to cook than 20 minutes. more like 45. Will definitely have this again.

Super moist and juicy! My two picky little eaters absolutely love it and it's so quick and easy to make! I did use 1/3 of a cup of Parmesan instead of half and next time I think I'll use an even ratio of cheese to mayonnaise just because we love cheese dip much! It definitely is delicious though!

It was OK, just not great.  One dinner guest removed the crust completely and ate it, but he said he would not want to serve it himself.  One guest loved it.  I have to agree with the first.  I love mayo, but it just doesn't work for me in this recipe.

Quick, easy and delicious! Perfect for a busy school night. Amazing how moist and tasty the chicken is. I used chicken breast and cut them into thin  cut horizontal pieces. My children loved it! I have leftover mayonnaise and parmigiana mixture which I am going to prepare the same recipe using tilapia. Definitely will be making this again!

I will make this easy, delicious main dish again.  I had to substitute a couple of the ingredients (three cheese blend for the parm and panko for the Italian bread crumbs) because it's what I had on hand.  Even the picky eaters in the crowd loved the dish. Plated with some steamed broccoli and corn on the cob made a very eye-appealing, speedy meal.  I did have to increase the baking time due to the chicken pieces being thicker than normal.

This was the best crusted chicken I've made. I would definitely use this recipe again. I served it with spaghetti sauce and noodles with extra parmesan cheese on top.

Cook on a cooling rack over top of baking sheet, just make sure the rack is oven worthy (the grid style typically works). I mixed a cube of frozen garlic in with the mayo. Clean plates!

Really good! Very simple & easy to follow. I tweaked just a few things the second time around - instead of using Mayo, I soaked the chicken in egg and then covered it in a mixture of Parmesan and bread crumbs. Also really good as well. :)

Actually I'm in the process of making it for the first time.   I didn't have mayo so I used olive oil.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper to taste added powered garlic and Italian seasoning.  Let it set for about thirty minutes so some of the flavors could soak in.  I used 1/3 parmigiano cheese and 2/3 plain bread crumbs because I didn't have the other.  It was a hit! I  will definitely make this one again??

This turned out amazingly!!! I'm so excited to use it a lot more often! But i didn't have preseasoned bread crumbs so i toasted a few pieces of bread and put Italian seasoning garlic powder onion powder and dried cilantro in a bag and crunched it all together. Also this way you can control a little more what flavors are going into it but it turned out to be one of my now favorite chickens!

Pretty good! Made it with shredded mozzarella & sprinkled Parmesan & liked it. The mayo was a bit much, though. Thinking of substituting something...

A family favorite. I use less mayo then it calls for. and for the Italian breadcrumbs I mash up rice cereal and add Italian seasoning or just parsley. so simple and yet so good!

Very tasty for being so simple.

We followed the directions pretty much to a T. We put a tiny bit less seasoning, but that was it.

I would recommend drying your chicken off with a paper towel before putting the mayo on it. I also dipped the chicken in the mayo and took enough off to leave a thin layer of it. Then I mixed Italian panco bread crumbs with the parmesan in a bowl. Alas, I put the mayo chicken in the panco/parm and covered it thoroughly. I baked it on a cookie sheet for about 35 minutes. I put the chicken on linguine noodles and sauced it with spaghetti sauce. The chicken was very moist and had no issue with crisp-ness. Great alone but the Bf loves chicken parmesan with noodles and sauce. Topping it all with mozzarella is a good choice too. I will make again!:)

I've made this for years.  I coat the chicken lightly with olive oil instead of mayo.   The just before done, I put under the broiler for about two minutes to get the chicken nice and brown.

We make this about once a week. It's super easy and delicious. And nice breadcrumbs makes a nice crust and a great meal with green beans and rice. Or salad side.

it was really easy and delicious!  I used very thin sliced chicken breasts and bake 15 minutes at 350.  I used 1/4 cup of mayo instead of 1/2 cup  and turn out great! Thank you for this great recipe !!  I will do it again for sure!!

Easy and very tasty dish. We will usually set the oven on broil for a few minutes after it is done to kind of crisp up the top but it is still good without that IMO.

So delicious. Absolutely juicy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Next time, I believe I will cover the entire chicken breast instead of just the top. Either way, so good.

I added my bread dip seasoning to the mayo mixture and cut the chicken up smaller,  but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was absolutely wonderful.  So moist and everyone loved it. I can't wait to make this again!

Excellent !!!! Only one minor change...used Panko breading instead...1/4 cup. This is a fabulous dish and love the ease and quickness with which it is executed. Will remake this many times in the years to come! Thanks for sharing it!

EASY, QUICK AND DELICIOUS, EVEN FOR PICKY EATERS!
I'm far from being a cook or a chef, and only recently started making meals that didn't come in a box, but this was so easy and SO good! I used a rubber spatula to coat the breasts with the mayonnaise mix, and laid the chicken in a plate of crumbs to coat both sides. Took about 30 minutes total to prep and cook, and it was all gone in less than 10. We have two boys who have had medical issues and so can be very picky eaters now that they are back on solid foods, and they inhaled their chicken! That's the best compliment it could get, we couldn't believe it! Another addition I made was to sprinkle on Morton Natures Seasons after the mayo and before the crumbs, giving it a little extra flavor.

I loved it! I just mixed the mayo on the plate with about two small handfuls of Parmesan and coated the entire price of chicken using that! The only thing I HAD to change was that only 4 teaspoons of breadcrumbs was not enough I used a bout a cup to cover 4 NORMAL chicken breasts. The crumbs on top didn't cook so I had to leave it in there for an extra five minutes, but in the end it was super moist and the perfect texture for the whole family. I also baked it at 350 degrees because I forgot to change it from the preset temperature! Over all this is a great dish that I have and will make again!

This is super quick and easy to make! I didn't have mayo so used miracle whip instead which gave it a little tangy twist. Me and my bf loved it, I will definitely be making this again!

We love this and make it often, chicken almost always comes out juicy.
If you cut the chicken thick you can bake it for less time and it is still just as good.

This is so ridiculously good. It's unbelievable how so few ingredients and such quick and easy prep can result in such a delicious, moist chicken. The only change I made is to season the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before topping them.

Love this recipe! Have made it many times, but instead of bread crumbs, I use french fried onions(used for green bean casserole) and the taste is even better! You pour enough french fried onions for all chicken pieces in a sandwich bag and crush finely with a pounder or bottom of a saucepan. Then after you dip the chicken in mayonnaise-parmesan cheese mixture, you coat chicken with french fried onion crumbs. Your family will love this so much, they will be asking for more!

Had it. Not impressed. Why go to the trouble of buying "healthier" skinless chicken breasts--at like 4x the price of plain, ordinary skin-on chicken--and then add mayo, which ends up having more fat, calories, cholesterol, and sodium to boot, than leaving the tasty, crispy skin on would? The mayo method ends up greasier, as well. .. Sorry to be a wet blanket on this idea, but it makes no sense to me.  Start the skin-on chicken cooking at a higher heat for the first 5-10 mins. to seal in the natural juices, then reduce heat for the remainder of cooking time.. it'll be moist and tender that way.

I will be making this again! It was so good!. I added some extra seasoning to the mayo mixture such as seasonal salt, garlic powder, onion powder. Higly recommend doing so. i also spread the mixture on both sides of the chicken breast instead of just the top. Amazing dish!

So juicy and delicious! This plus home made alfredo sauce is AMAZING! My husband can't get enough and neither can I! It's a HUGE hit every time I make it! Also, I usually bake it about 400 and bake it for longer. Not sure of the exact time, but we use a meat thermometer. Best to cook it a little bit lower and longer. It will be much jucier. Also, I'm gluten intolerant and this is just as yummy with gluten-free bread crumbs!

This is delicious and very easy to make.  I used cutlets so they baked quickly and followed the recipe exactly as written.  The chicken was juicy, probably due to the mayo but who cares? You don't have to use *all* of the mixture if you are watching your fat intake (like me), just enough to coat the top so the breadcrumbs stick.  Hubby loved it!

I admit to being skeptical, but this came together super fast and tasted really good!  I mixed the mayo & parmesan, brushed it on using a basting brush then sprinkled the bread crumbs on top.

This was good, but not great.  I made half the recipe, but cut back on the mayonnaise by half and used only 2 T. for two chicken breast halves.  Once mixed with the parmesan cheese, I had plenty to spread over the chicken.  I assembled this in the afternoon, refrigerated it and sprinkled the bread crumbs on just before baking.  There was some crispiness to this, but not as much as I had hoped.  I may try this again using panko to see if it crisps up a little more.

Made this for dinner tonight. My husband and I loved it. Moist and crispy, very tasty. Instead of mayonnaise, I used salad dressing( don't like mayo). Quick and easy!  Will be making this again soon..

Love this recipe. So easy and quick. Chicken always comes out soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Didn't change a thing.

The chicken is moist and flavourful.  Just be careful not to put too much mayo on the chicken or it will dominate the taste.
