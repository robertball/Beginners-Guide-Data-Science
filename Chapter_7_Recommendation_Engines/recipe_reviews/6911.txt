This goes down as the family's favorite! Suggestions: Use 1-1/2 cups bread flour and 1-1/2 cups whole wheat to make a lighter bread. I let bread machine do whole thing. Why take out of machine to let rise & then bake ? Make sure to choose whole wheat cycle which gives more time to rise.

Very dense bread, didn't rise much. Tasty but not outstanding.

One of the best wheat bread recipes I have made in my 50 years as a cook/baker. My hubby, and inlaws, grandkids, love it! I recommend this if you wish to impress somebody. 
I did add a bit more water to the recipe,,
The dough rose beautifully and the aroma was wonderful! I made one round loaf , after it came from the oven, I put real cream sweet butter on the top of the crust. Thanks for offering this special bread recipe.
!!

Moist tasty bread.  I think substituting some rye flour for wheat would be good. Did not rise much with no white flour.  Next time I would add some gluten.

I modified the recipe by using equal parts of white, rye and whole wheat flour.  This made a good bread but it didn't taste as good as it smelled when it was baking.  The loaf was so hot when I cut the first slice that I almost burned myself.

This was a good bread recipe, although I agree with some reviewers that the onion soup mix smelled good, but the taste just wasn't there in the finished product (and my kids didnt' like the chunks of onion, or the idea of onions in bread).  I made the recipe again without the soup mix, and ended up with a delicious, soft and tender whole wheat bread that was perfect with honey or apple butter.  I made it into rolls and they freeze nicely.

This is a very good recipe. I baked it in the bread machine too. I used the wheat flour made for bread machine baking. I used the "wheat" setting on the machine with a light crust. The loaf came out moist & the texture was perfect. The flavor is very savory. If only I'd had some cream cheese to spread on it... :-)

I made this last night to go with some homemade beef stew my husband made.  It went really great together!  It is a very rich bread, so not something I would want all the time, but it was great with the stew.  I did make a few changes.  I used half bread flour & half whole wheat, as suggested by other reviewers.  I also added 4 tsp. of vital wheat gluten to help it rise. I didn't have wheat germ, so that was omitted.  We will definitely make this bread again.  It would also make great rolls!

Even though I adapted this recipe a little, I give it 5 stars. It is unique and delicious! I add some sauteed onions and also some onion flkes to make it more "onionny" since many reviewers said it wasn't. Mine turned out with a great aroma AND great flavor!

This is so good!  For the recipe I added one cup white flour and one cup wwheat.  But I will have to add some more onion next time. I used 1/4 of a cup and it wasn't enough,we wanted a strong onion flavour.  But it was super moist, DH toasted it in the morning as well.  I baked it in the oven as requested because my bread maker is for a 2 pound loaf, so i didn't want to over bake it in my bread maker.  It is so good, will for sure make it again!  Thanx!

I was disapointed with this recipe after reading all the good reviews. It smelled great while it was baking, but when it was done, my husband and I both took one bite and threw the rest out. It did have a nice texture, rose very well and was nice and moist while most recipies that use all whole wheat are more dense and dry. But the onion taste was too strong and bitter- maybe I will try this recipe again with no onion soup.

This bread came out pretty well.  On the advice of others, I made the following changes.  I used 2 cups of wheat flour and 1 of white flour.  I am not sure this was entirely necessary, though.  Second, I doubled the onion soup mix and the bread came out nice and onion-y.  One thing, if you double the soup mix, no need to add the salt.  Lastly, I did not use a bread maker, I just mixed by hand.  Very tasty and dense bread.

Very moist for a ww bread, but it does taste like ww, so the bf isn't going to go for this one.  I like it, though, so I'll call it a success.  I added about 2 1/2 tbs of wheat gluten, and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have risen well at all without it.  I made my own Onion Soup Mix. Works wonderfully! I don't usually bake in the bread machine, and I decided not to again today.  I just used the dough cycle and baked in the oven at 375 for 40 min after allowing to rise for about 30 minutes in a 200 degree oven. Thanks for the recipe.

Nice texture, moist - even the next day.  But I didn't care for the flavor.  It wasn't what I expected, not nearly as much onion flavor as I would have wanted.  The kids ate it, though.

I love this recipe, I make it every week for my kids' lunches. I use all purpose flour and this recipe delivers! You can add anything into this recipe and it turns out. I throw chia seeds in with the water, and add ground flax seed as well. I mix half sour cream and half yogurt.

Very dense bread. Not the flavor I was expecting. Mine rose nicely, but then colapsed toward the end of the baking cycle. Sorry, I will not be making this again.
