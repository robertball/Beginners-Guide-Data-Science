I made this with no changes and it was pretty good. Very simple, very quick to throw together. It tastes good, but I think I would prefer a deeper vanilla flavor. It was delicious on top of my strawberry yogurt.

Currently in the oven and it smells AMAZING! Can't wait until it cools so I can taste it. I used regular brown sugar instead of sweetener :-).

I used regular brown sugar b/c I don't use sweeteners. I also used honey in place of white sugar. I think this granola is quite bland. Next time I might try adding some maple syrup in place of the white sugar. I also added more nuts and flax seeds. Pretty boring flavor. There is another granola recipe called 'Jennifer's Granola' on this site that I prefer.

Great base granola recipe.  Easy to create varitions on the theme with this one.  My changes were straight up brown sugar, omit white sugar, 1 heaping Tbsp cinn, used my homemade super chunky applesauce, added flax seed, and more vanilla.  The chunky applesauce made larger clumps of granola--I like that.

I love this because it is low fat.  I used a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon but followed the rest of the recipe.  My applesauce was unsweetened.  Very good and very fast.  Will test drive it with my grandkids over Christmas.

Giving this only two stars because anything with that much sugar can't honestly be considered "healthy".  Would recommend omitting the white sugar completely and adding natural sweeteners like raisins and coconut.  Not a great recipe overall.

This was pretty good for a first try at granola. Super easy and few ingredients. I used pecans instead of almonds. My only concern was the baking time- I ended up baking mine for almost an hour before it started to finally crisp up and brown. I have a rather antiquated stove so it was possibly my fault since I don't see any other reviews mention this problem. Over all a tasty first try!

I used powdered vanilla, but it didn't taste quite as good as it smelled.

This is the best granola ever and very easy to make.  My husband does not want store bought granola anymore.  I've added dried cranberries.

I just made this granola. I made a few changes... I used regular brown sugar, I used the whole can of applesauce rather than just 1 cup. I also added 1/2 cup shredded cocoanut, and after it cooled, I added 1/2 cup chopped chocolate chips. I will probably make this again!

I used 5 t. vanilla and thought that this recipe could use a little more flavor all around. I baked it for 30 minutes and thought it wasn't crispy enough. I later tried Allison Spencer's granola and it was a million times better than this recipe. The thing that is nice about this one is the limited ingredients.
