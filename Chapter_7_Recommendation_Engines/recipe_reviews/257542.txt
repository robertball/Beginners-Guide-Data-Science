These turned out good. A little bland but zucchini always is in my opinion. To be sure the hubs would eat them I knew I had to make them extra crispy. I double dipped them and then also flipped them often in the end spaying non stick spray with each flip. Crispy indeed! I served them with marinara for dipping because that just made more sense to me.
