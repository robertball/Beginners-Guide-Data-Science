My family really likes the recipe but only after the second time I made it. It was well worth the second attempt and will now be part of all our holiday dinners.  
That second time I reduced the amount of orange peel.  I only used 1/2 of the peel from the orange.  Using all the orange peel made it bitter and the orange over powered the other flavors.  Also make sure that you cook the sugar and cranberries long enough.  If not you will have sugar crystals, which you do not want.

I chose this recipe because it includes apricot preserves, which adds a nice touch of sweetness, along with the pineapple. This relish has a wonderful red color.  The consistency is nice, too. I ended up picking all the orange rind bits out for two reasons:  My food processor didn't chop them uniformly and the bits looked unappetizing as well as out of place.  The other reason is that my husband said it was way too bitter and sour for his liking. (My 17 mo. old liked it!) Once I picked the bits out, I thought the relish looked much better. There was also some orange "flesh" that didn't chop up that I had to pick out.  Next time I think I will add some OJ and orange zest instead of chopping up an entire orange. We'll see how it goes over on Thanksgiving!  Thanks, Lisa.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving.  I doubled the recipe and recommend if you plan to do this that you serve it in two or more bowls - it looked like a trough in one!  But with 15 adults, every bit was eaten or taken as leftovers, so it was a hit.  I used only the outside skin (the orange part without the white) of about 1/2 of an orange and it was plenty - so I recommend not using a whole peel, like others have done.  I think you could probably experiment with this by adding diced apple and /or pear, too.  I will definitely make this again for next year's Thanksgiving - thanks for the great recipe!

This was the best cranberry relish I had ever eaten. The recipe was easy and it turned out great. I will continue to make this every year.

I don't have a food processor, so I zested one orange, then cut off the white part, which is usually bitter, and finely chopped the orange. I also cut back the sugar to one cup, and omitted the lemon juice. It was very good! I think it would be good with chopped pecans as well.

Good choice for someone who likes cranberry sauce but wants more. It's better the second day.

Fantastic recipe!!  I cleaned the seedless orange really well with a commercial fruit wash first, cut off both end tips, and cut out the middle "strings" - then had no problem pulverizing it in my food processor.  After the cranberries were cooked (and the sugar melted) - I added the rest of the ingredients to the pan - and added 1 tbsp of pure maple syrup - and cooked it for a further 4 minutes on low/medium heat.  Came out great - you could add more maple syrup if you want it sweeter...but cook it for a little longer.  Will go great with our Thanksgiving meal tomorrow!!  Would love to try this over baked brie......
Thanks for the great recipe!!

Super easy to make.  I zested the orange as others had suggested, discarded the peel, then chopped the fruit to add to the other ingredients.  I made this to embellish a baked ham.  It was a huge hit.  Additionally, another person had brought belgian waffles to the function and it was used up as a topping!  It's pretty too.

I zested the entire orange and discarded the remaining skin. Otherwise followed the original recipe. Rave reviews at Thanksgiving.

I just made this with only 12 oz bag of cranberries, so I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I used cherry preserves instead of apricot, as previous reviewer, and 4 clementines instead of an orange, which I both zested and food-processed whole. I kept all the other ingredients and portions the same. It tastes great. Can't wait to serve it on my Thanksgiving table tomorrow.  Thanks Lisa!

This was the best cranberry relish I have ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly then added about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans.  It was perfect with our Thanksgiving dinner.  My family has tried dozens of different cranberry recipes and we've finally found a keeper!

I made this at Thanksgiving because my mom was going to buy some store bought stuff. I peeled my orange and segmented it and just used the pulp after reading others reviews. I also put my cranberry sugar mixture through the food processor. I was so worried my mom wasn't going to like it and think that it was too sweet but I was wrong. She loves it. When I asked her if I should make it for Christmas her reply was "Oh yes, definitely! So, I just finished making it again.

This one came out looking like cranberrys, but tasting like oranges...not what I expected. I made it the day before Thanksgiving so it could set up overnight, but the orange taste just got stronger. I most likely won't be making this one again.

Made this for Thanksgiving. What a hit! All our guests loved it and ask for the recipe. One couple plans to serve it as a dessert! I zested the orange and sectioned it instead of grinding it in a food processor. I’m wondering if substituting Splenda for the sugar would  effect the taste.

I have made this several times now.  It was way too bitter using the pith of the orange the first time round, so I did as other reviews suggested and zested the orange, then peeled it, and chopped the segments to use.  Other than that, the rest of the ingredients are spot on.  It is runny while it is warm, but fear not, it thickens up when it cools.  

Note:Sometimes I like to add a handful of chopped nuts (pecans or walnuts) as well as a couple stalks of chopped celery if I'm in the mood for a little more crunch.

Happy Holidays and happy cooking, y'all!

I usually do not care for cranberry sauce, but I always make it for Thanksgiving for those that do. However this year I decided to look for something a bit more special and this recipe was amazing! I even loved it!

I did not use the whole orange as in the recipe. I used the zest of 2 oranges and segmented the oranges and chopped them up. I also used a 15 ounce can of pineapple tidbits drained and crushed them in my blender.  It turned out great.  We loved it.

Tastes great! Although, I think next time I’ll add the sugar to cranberries after they have simmered. Some of the sugar hardened like candy pieces.

Wow I have made cranberry relish for many years. This year I wanted to do something different so I tried this recipe exactly as is. It is so delishous I was concerned the pineapple would overpower the orange and cranberry but it did not. I will make this a few days ahead next time because the longer it sat the better the flavors were. This is my new standard for cranberry relish

Delicious! Not so much by itself-it's a bit on the strong side to just eat, but fantastic spread over cold turkey sandwiches. Even my cranberry-disliking mom enjoyed it that way. I have made this several times, exactly as shown the first time and a half-batch the second time, and it's easy and turned out wonderfully.

I am not really a fan of cranberry anything, but my family wanted a relish for Thanksgiving, so I just made this recipe. I have to say it is VERY good and I might just be a new convert to cranberry relish!! I thought the flavors were well-balanced, and the apricot added a smoothness that complements the tartness very well. I will most definitely make this again, and I will share this recipe on other sites as well.

I thought this was really delicious. The flavors blended so well and got even better over time. I served this with my "Thanksgiving-ish" meal and it was a perfect compliment and a nice change from the jello type salad. I will make this again!
