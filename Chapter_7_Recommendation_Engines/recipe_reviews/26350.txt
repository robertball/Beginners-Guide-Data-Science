FIVE STARS AND THEN SOME!  This is absolutely perfect!!  My meals are low-carb so I took a chance and left out the couscous.  Great move on my part; these turned out fabulous!  My other changes: 2 whole eggs instead of yolks, sugar-free orange breakfast drink instead of juice (it's all I had) and baked instead of fried.  I used the advice of a previous reviewer and let the mixture sit in the fridge for about 40 minutes before shaping into patties and that made them hold together very well.  I sprayed a foil-lined pan and baked at 375 F for 25 minutes then let the patties rest for about 7 minutes while I threw together a salad.  The mayo is great, too!  It's so rich and flavorful that you need only a bit to dress up the patty.  By the texture of the baked patties, I'd say these would freeze well.  In which case, you'll find dozens of these in my freezer at any given time!  Addendum: Tried freezing without success.  They fell apart during re-heat, lost flavor and became chewy.  Still, they're not much work so making them fresh isn't a big deal.

These were SO good!!!!! I will be making them VERY often! The Garlic mayo wasn't for me however- next time I'll make some tzatziki. Thanks for this recipe! EDIT- I just made these again (a week later) but instead of making patties I BAKED the mixture in a cake pan for 20 minutes (at 350) then cut into pieces I put on toast with the garlic mayo. BEST LUNCH EVER! Even my 3 year old ate his all gone!

Excellent!  I cut the recipe in half because I knew there's no way my husband is eating fish.  I cut everything in halt exactly, except for the salmon I used a 6 oz. pouch (no draining) because they were on sale for $1.  It was delicious!  Non-dairy for me (lactose intolerant).  It did not taste fishy at all to me.  I made 6 very neat little patties.  I make my patties by spraying a 1/4 measuring cup with Pam, then stuffing the mixture in, then plopping it out into the pan.  All come out in uniform shape.  Exellent!  Will make again.

A really good recipe that can be a jump-off for other cakes of this type.  We used fresh salmon instead of canned, one whole egg, a little less spinach, and added extra garlic to everything, as well as a pinch of cayenne and about half a tsp of ground corriander.  I also scaled it down to serve two, as it's just my husband and I eating.  I didn't have orange juice on hand and just added a squirt of lemon juice to the cooking water for the couscous.  Minor alterations, really, and these came out fantastic -- the couscous is wonderful because it forms a nice crispy crust on the outside of the patty, but is creamy inside.  Delicious!

amazing!  these were easy to make and came out beautifully.  I did use 2 whole eggs instead of just the yolks.  I also used more olive oil than was called for because my cakes kept soaking it up!  next time I will quickly saute the garlic before adding it to the salmon mix because the raw garlic taste was a little strong for me at times.  the mayo was good and I think once the garlic is toned down in the patties, the mayo will be just the right touch.

Excellent! Even my picky sister loved these. I used fresh spinach cut up very small, and cut back to one large egg. I try to stay away from frying, so instead I baked them in muffin tins! Grease the pans, and as they start to brown on the top (20 minutes or so usually) take them out and let them cool for 15 mins or so before getting them out of the pan. These freeze and reheat incredibly well, so each time I make them I double the recipe and freeze half for lunches. Thanks for sharing!
ETA: I am using lemon or lime juice now instead of the orange. I found we couldn't taste the orange juice, but when I use 2 cups of couscous with 2 1/2 cups of water, I substitute the 1/2 cup for other citrus. It's awesome that way.

These were fantastic! My husband and I both loved them. I did add a bit of cayenne pepper to make it more spicy, but other than that, stuck to the recipe exactly. 
I chilled both the mayo & the patty mixture for about an hour before cooking them. Will be making this again!

Well, here was my dilemma. I made the recipe completely to recipe, with the exception that I had some fresh salmon that a friend had caught, so I used that (after picking the bones out)> The patties just didn't stay together. So my husband, seeing my dilemma said: "Just cook it like hamburger". So I did. I mixed it up like tuna with the garlic mayo, and spooned the mixture onto buns. All I have to say is WOW. This was SUCH a great mixture of flavors, I was impressed. Great for lunches.

We loved this recipe.  Used left over salmon from the night before.  The oj with the couscous was a great idea.  I cooked up five patties and still had plenty left over to fill almost an entire mini-cup cake pan for appetizers. Both ways were a hit.   For mini's, spray pan with canola spray, fill and cook for about 25 minutes at 350F, or until the tops begin to brown.

This was a hit with all of my guests!  I made a few small changes and they came out perfectly:  used 1 lb. of fresh salmon (baked seasoned with salt, pepper and touch of lemon juice)in place of canned salmon, used 2 whole eggs, and made the mixture for both the salmon cakes and the garlic mayonnaise 1 day ahead.  To make the patties, I sprayed (with Pam)a shallow 1/3 c. measuring cup, packed in the mixture, and turned out onto a cookie sheet.  With this method, the cakes stayed together, were very uniform in shape, and made 12 patties.  I kept them refrigerated on the cookie sheet until it was time to prepare.  Delicous and unique recipe!

Loved it!  I enjoyed the combination of flavors.  I baked the patties instead of frying for health reasons, but other than that I followed the recipe. Excellent .. thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a disaster!!!  All of the cakes fell completely apart (and, yes, the oil was hot enough) and I ended up with a bowl of browned salmon cake hash instead of beautiful patties.  :-(

Nevertheless, this recipe gets 3 stars instead of 1 star because, when I tasted the "hash", it was delicious.  Go figure! I'm takin this "Moroccan Salmon Hash" to a friend's house for a Moroccan dinner tonight.  No kidding!

P.S.  I didn't bother to make the Garlic Mayo.  :-)

This recipe is FANTASTIC and will be a regular in our household. I made 2 minor(I think) changes - I am down under and the 'average' canned salmon can is 210g (not 413g) so I used this, about 2/3rds the spinach and one whole egg. After forming the patties I left them in the fridge for 1/2 hour before pan frying in a non stick pan & 1 Tbsp of olive oil they did not crumble at all.

These were very different yet tastey. I had read many reviews before making these. The changes I made were..I used 1 egg(yolk and white) I also baked these in muffin cups for 20 in a 375 oven. They turned out really good and I didn't have to use the oil and had no problem with them falling apart. I will make these again!

This got the two thumbs up from all the family.  Instead of frying the patties I placed them in a non stick muffin tray.  Then I baked them.  This saved on the fat content yet they still tasted fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe Emily.

Tasty! although my husband doesn't like it as much, maybe because he doesn't like cooked spinach? They sometimes fall apart when frying, so I don't make them too large. I love them!

Pretty tasty salmon cakes!  I used a whole egg rather than two yolks to get the binding properties of egg white.  I filled a 1/3 cup measure with mixture, patted it in, then shook it out into my hand and flattened it a bit before frying.  This worked well.  The next day I cooked the remaining mixture on the Foreman grill.  No problems with the patties breaking apart!  I sprayed one side of the patties generously with Pam, then put that side on the grill and sprayed the top generously before closing.  I cooked them about 2 minutes until the tops were well browned.  Using the tool made for the grill, the patties lifed right off.

WOW! I was very impressed with this recipe. I used leftover salmon from the night before, and I accidentally opened a box of brown rice instead of cous-cous, so I used that instead, and still delicious! I definately recommed making the garlic mayo an hour or so beforehand- the flavor really comes out after chilling for a while.

After trying to find something to do with almost a pound of leftover grilled salmon, I made this for dinner last night. I have never even HAD salmon cakes before...but these were incredibly good. My whole family thought they were great. I made them exactly as the recipe states, with the exception of substituting fresh salmon for the canned. Don't quite know what it is about the combination of ingredients, but it all works. LOVE the couscous w/oj and spinach. My only caution would be to follow the recipe and only turn them once. I turned them three or four times to carefully brown them, and a few of the cakes started to fall apart. It didn't matter; they were still WONDERFUL!

WOW!  This is a dish I would expect to find in a 5 star restaurant. I was skeptical about the garlic mayonnaise but it added just the right touch. I'll not be making any changes to this recipe.  It's perfect the way it is.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed these. My son wasn't as impressed, but he finished his (which I was pretty pleased with since he can be a typical picky four year old). I felt like the garlic mayonnaise was a bit heavy so I might add a little sour cream or Greek yogurt to cut it. I served these over couscous and a Moroccan veggie stew.

These were pretty darn good! Personally, it was the garlic mayo that really did it for me - I don't know that I would have enjoyed these little cakes nearly as much without it. For the mayo, I minced the garlic then sprinkled a touch of salt on it and crushed it with the side of the knife to make a paste. Doing this adds an intense garlic flavour to the mayo without having actual pieces of raw garlic to bit into. I had leftover couscous so I didn't follow the cooking instructions that required orange juice, but I think I would have replaced the orange juice with stock anyway (personal preference). I used one cup of cooked couscous, a 213g can of salmon (all I had), one whole egg and about 2/3 of the recommended spinach and these cakes turned out great. If my boyfriend wasn't going to be eating these, I would have definitely added some chopped green onions which would have been delish (he hates onions). Great recipe. Enjoy!

I was skeptical as I was putting them into the oven, but they came out fantastic. I used a whole cup of cous cous, more garlic, and I used ground salmon filets instead of canned salmon.  I added some red pepper to the sauce because I thought it was too bland and...mayonaisey. Next time I will use half sour cream, half mayonaise to lighten it. I drizzeled them lightly with olive oil and baked them for 30 minutes. EDIT: I used half plain yogurt and half mayonnaise, garlic, paprika, and cayenne pepper. This sauce taste like french onion dip with chips, but a lot less calories.

This was delicious.  My husband, my three-year old and my one-year all liked it.  I didn't have spinach so I used shredded carrots.  I made smaller patties and didn't have any trouble with them falling apart.  Will make again for sure.

Very good.  Substitued chicken broth for the orange juice.  I do not like the taste of fruit and meat together.

This was an excellent recipe! By using a 5-minute brand of couscous, and thawing the spinach while the OJ boiled I saved plenty of time. I'll probably make this as an appetizer next time.  Thanks!

One of my favorite recipes! I found this a year or two ago and have made it exactly to the recipe and with changes- always delicious! My discoveries: I use fresh spinach and add an extra egg to replace the moisture (making 3 WHOLE eggs to hold it together), I double the garlic in the mayo... because it's yummy, and usually fry in a tablespoon or less of olive oil, instead of baking as others have suggested.  I've also made these several times without orange juice (just because I didn't have it on hand) and it was still fantastic (though not quite the same). I've fiddled with it in other ways, but these are my most consistent changes. Thanks for the marvelous recipe!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't add the spinach (we had it as a side) and I used Parmesan couscous and only 1 egg.  The patties held together well and the mayo dressing was delicious.

Made a few slight changes; I used garlic coucous as other reviewers said  it was bland.  I also used freshly baked and cooled salmon, not canned.  I forgot to use the orange juice to make the coucous (even though I made a point to buy it!) so, I'm not sure if that made a difference.  It was very easy to put together, and the mayo was a nice touch.  My family liked it, so I will probably make it again for sure.  Thanks for the post!

I had this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful. I did have some trouble with it falling apart. The second batch was much firmer so I think next time I am going to chill the mixture for a bit before I cook it. I used fresh shredded salmon and used fat free mayo in the topping. The combination of ingredients was terrific. I'll be making this again.

As a few people mentioned, the OJ couscous really added to the tastiness of these salmon cakes. Took me about an hour to make, but well worth it. The dipping sauce is terrific as well.

These were great!  I give it four stars because there are a couple of things I changed--not with the ingredients.  After creating the mix but before forming the cakes, I chilled the ingredients for about 10 minutes.  I didn't have an issue with the patties falling apart in the frying pan.  While cooking, my first two came out a little to burned on either side, while still looking a little flimsy in the middle.  I was lucky to have a friend over who worked as a chef at a Japanese restaurant, and he said it would help to cook these like pot stickers--adding a bit of water, covering, increasing the heat, and shortening the cooking time.  The other four came out wonderful.  Will definately make again!

Making these for the second time tonight. I too substituted a half-half combo of water and lemon juice for the orange juice. I also used 2 whole eggs rather than just the yolks. I chose to bake these little morsels because i'm on a diet. Grease muffin tins, oven at 350. Bake about 30-40 mins or until tops start to turn light brown. They pop right out of the tin ... little salmon "muffins". Yummy!

Our 9,7, and 5 year old daughters love this recipe!  I've found it's much easier to patty it out into about 6 patties on a piece of parchment paper on a cookie sheet, then bake for 25~30 minutes at 350.

Just didn't care for this.  There was no fish flavor.  Most of what we tasted was garlic.  I made it by the recipe, and was very disappointed.  They came out looking great, but that was it.  One tip for anyone having a problem keeping them from falling apart - be VERY sure that you spinach is well drained.  I take small dollops and squeeze the water out of them.  I think this may have been the problem!

I think the fishy taste others have experienced is more a result of the canned fish than from the recipe itself. I used left-over baked salmon and it turned out fabulous. I didn't have spinach so I left that out, but the couscous gave the patties a great texture. Definately a repeat recipe!

These are delicious. My family did not like the garlic mayonaise. I used fresh, raw, chopped spinach, one whole egg (extra large) instead of 2 egg yolks, whole wheat couscous, and added some lime juice and water to the orange juice because we ran out of oj. Also, I picked all the vertebra and skin out of the salmon. My 4year old, 2 year old, 18 year old nephew, and husband loved these both times i made them.

I was very disappointed.  I did substitute talapia and orange roughy for salmon since my husband doesn't like salmon but otherwise I made this by the recipe.  I thought it was bland and tasted like dressed up coucous more than anything else.  Sorry, I won't be making this again.

wow--I feel like I've struck gold with this recipe!  I LOVED it and was really desperate for some new fish recipes.  we all-kids and adults-thought it was delicious.  My only input--since I was using it as part of an appetizer I put some of the mixture into the phyllo dough shells (pepperidge farm) and baked.  pretty--yummy--easy--no frying!

Not bad.  I think it needs a little extra something though.  I will definately try it again.  I think I'll add cayenne pepper or basil to the salmon cake.  The mayo was fine as is.

I found this recipe by looking for something using canned salmon and spinach, since that's what I had on hand. I happened to have all the other ingredients too, so I made it.

Overall, I thought it was pretty good, although my "patties" didn't want to hold together so I eneded up with part patties and part hash. That may have been because I needed to use two 6-oz cans of salmon instead of one 14.75-oz can.

Although I liked it, and I ate it, I'm not sure I would make it again - mostly because I don't usually have couscous on hand (and I wouldn't buy it just for this), but also because I like my other salmon patty recipe better. 

But this was nice for a change of pace, and if the ingredients sound good to you, then give it a try!

Just adore this recipe, salmon patties used to only be a childhood memory during lent before I found these. I have made these countless times (all year round) and shared the recipe with friends and family. Have used fresh salmon and canned as well as fresh or frozen spinach. Whatever you have works here. I always leave out he OJ (just a squeeze of lemon works for me) double the cumin and bake them in a greased muffin tin. Leftovers for sandwiches travel well and never go to waste. I also swap out the mayo for Greek yogurt using more cumin, lemon and garlic. Just one fantastic recipe!!!

Loved this recipe! I followed it exactly and yes I did have one patty that fell apart, so I decided to read the other reviews and will try whole eggs instead of yolks and chilling the mixture before making the patties. At first I was concerned about quantity but these are also pretty filling. My husband, 20 year old son, 17 year daughter and I ate them all and we were full, no leftovers though :( We'll be making this again soon.

Great change of pace for Lent! I used frozen salmon I had baked with salt and pepper - trying to use up freezer items and this salmon was a lower-end salmon that was all but inedible normally prepared. I cut the OJ in half, replacing the other half with water because I'm not big on orange flavored food. I don't know how much spinach I used - just used up some fresh spinach I had, cooked. I liked the garlic mayo. Mine was probably heavy on the garlic, but that was fine by me. Seems like a pretty forgiving recipe. I could easily see adding more garlic or some hot spices. A bit of feta cheese may be interesting, too. Maybe next time!

Didn't make with the couscous due to gluten intolerance. I made a few without the couscous and they were good, but found them lacking somewhat so I followed the advice of another reviewer and mixed the mayo with the salmon to form the patties. Turned out well!

These were VERY good. Perfect for a summer dinner and would be excellent as an appiteizer (in mini cake form) 

The only thing I would change would be the sauce. Along with the paprika and crushed garlic, I also used a little garlic powder and and a dash of cumin. It was fantastic. My husband didnt care for the texture of the patties to much but he loved the taste!

These were really simple and quite delicious.  I made my cous cous with water as I"m not a fan of orange flavour in savoury food.  I halved all incredients as I only had a small tin of salmon and used 1 whole egg.  The cakes stayed together, but i had to be very careful, so next time I would use 2 eggs.   Will make again.

I have made this dish twice now.  I always have spinach and salmon on hand.  I just pan fry the salmon and finely chop the fresh spinach.  You can use frozen or fresh spinach without much difference.  I use quinoa instead of coucous (I interchange the two in recipes all the time, depending which one I have on hand.)  The garlic mayo is an excellent compliment.  Its a healthy alternative to traditional salmon patties.  I can make them ahead and fry them when were ready to eat.  Super easy.  Sadly I forgot to prepare the quinoa with OJ this last time,  but I did not miss it:)

I have tried this recipe with and without the orange juice, and they turned out great both ways. Also, I used pink salmon instead of red, to avoid having to pick out the skin and bones from the canned red salmon.

I'm going to give this 5 stars, even though my first try would only rate at 4 in my book. I had the wrong ratios because I used fresh salmon and didn't know how much it weighed. I ended up with too much liquid so the patties were nto very cooperative. I formed them with a cookie cutter and then tried to transfer them to the frying pan, well it kinda worked but they were not as pretty as I would have liked so I browned each side and put them on a cookie sheet (lined w/foil & sprayed with nonstick spray) and baked them as the rest of our meal was cooking.  Over all they came out looking very nice and tasting great. My Husband at like 4 of them and couldn't get enough. I liked them, but I would have liked more flavor... and if they were creamy inside that would have been amazing! The mayo came out good, and I hate mayo, but I ate this and it went well with the cakes.  So, it seems to be a 5 star recipe but I made a few mistakes and recovered fairly well so it wasn't ruined. When I formed the cakes, I tried to squeeze out as much liquid as I could, but they just didn't hold together. Maybe the answer is coating them in more couscous or breadcrumbs?

This was my first time making these so I followed the directions exactly, but when it was time to form the balls, they were way too wet so I boiled up some bulgher wheat, also with OJ, and added that.  Then the balls formed perfectly, and the stuck together well when cooked.  They were not too dry, either.  I think mine needed more grain because I am in a humid climate and high altitude, so with baking I need about 1/2 c more flour than called for, etc.  I formed them into the balls and refrigerated them for 4 hours, then fried them just before they were to be served.

I love this recipe and have made these cakes quite a few times.  And nutritionally, I think they're a good choice, although the fat content appears to be quite high, but that's probably due to the mayonnaise, so maybe using light mayo would cut down considerably with that. But if you click on 'view detailed nutrition' you'll see just how good for you these are.  I don't change a thing except to add the eggs as a whole (not just the yolks) and I've had no problem with the patties falling apart. The mayonnaise sauce really makes it special so for anyone who decides to skip it, I think you're missing out. For a change, tzatziki would also be a great choice. Very good!

These were pretty good, but I felt that they lacked some seasoning....maybe more salt or some type of herb like green onions or cilantro.

these are really good, I didn't have any spinach, so I used zucchini instead... turned out really good, the husband and baby LOVED them.... here is my trick for the zuch.  Shred it and squeeze out all of the water before mixing it.  I let the mixture sit in the fridge for the afternoon, and then resqueezed before shaping into a patty. A really good substiute if you are missing or do not like spinach.  The Mayo was awesome.
Footnote as of 3/11/08...I have done it with spinach...and I think I like the Zuch way better... it holds together better...Spinach taste good, but crumbled.

These were good.  I had trouble keeping the cakes together, though I did not let them sit in the fridge as one reviewer suggested.  I also did not use quite as much spinach to even out the flavors.  Still a good alternative to everyday food.

Amazing recipe! Per suggestions, I baked the cakes in a muffin tin at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. I changed the mayo dip to my liking by adding a few spoonfuls of yogurt to make it sweeter and creamier. I will definitely make this again!

I scaled this for 1, and used fresh lemon juice instead of orange (all i had) and baked.  The lemon was over-powering so maybe orange would be better. Mine turned out almsot like a hush puppy/cupcake - like the cous cous turned into a batter?  Guess I like more salmon in my salmon cakes and more flavor.  Mayo was ok but not worth the fat/calories. I may try to spice it up, add some shallots and use it to stuff mushrooms. I'm sure it would of been tastier if I fried it as well so my bad. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was different and a nice change from my usual salmon patties.  I read the reviews and did a few of the things suggested in different reviews (thanks!).  Since I didn't have spinach on hand, I used shredded carrots (2 medium) instead.  I used two whole eggs (very necessary, IMO).  I also baked them in greased muffin tins.  I added some parsley to the mayo for color.  I wish I would have done one more suggestion - add the mayo sauce directly to the mix.  They came out a little dry, but perhaps that was from the carrots vs. spinach.  I'm not a big fan of fish, and I thought the couscous really toned down the fishy flavor.  As a note to those not used to canned salmon (inexpensive or not):  take out any skin/scales you find.  When draining, just pick up all the bones and crush them in your fingertips - they are very soft - and you'll not notice them in the final product.  It helps add a lot of calcium to the meal.

I've now made this twice, although I used tuna both times instead of salmon, which is impossible to find in Switzerland where I live.  I fried it once and made it in muffin tins once.  The muffin tin idea is excellent and I highly recommend it.  Be sure to spray or grease the tin, however.  And don't leave out some sort of sauce (I prefer tzatziki myself) -- they really need some sauce.

This was an email daily dish and it sounded ususual.  It was a big hit with my family.  I followed the recipe exactly(unusual for me) and it turned out great.  I used an ice cream scoop to portion out the patties and they did not crumble at all. I will definately make this again. Thanks for the great recipe

Loved this!  Added cayanne pepper and coriander to the mix and formed the patties into 1/3 cup shapes like others suggested. Also baked at 375 for 25 minutes.  Very unique texture and flavor.  Thanks!

I have to say that I was a little wary of the canned salmon in this recipe. But it turned out great! It was such an interesting mix of flavors, and it was really easy to prepare. I served the cakes on a bed of baby greens with a French vinagrette. My boyfriend loved it!

I agree w/ a previous reviewer that these are TOO fishy. I like fish, but I can't taste anything else. I think these would be better w/ maybe double the couscous and some lemon. I gave it three stars because my six year old daughter liked them w/ tartar sauce and she never likes anything. Go figure.

AWESOME Recipe!! Don't let the orange juice part turn you off. I thought it would turn out sweet and too "orangy" but you really can't even taste it! awesome awesome. 
We ended up putting in 3 eggs instead of 2. 

This recipe def. gets a 5 star rating! So Creative!

A great change from regular salmon patties. I thawed frozen salmon for this because it's what I had, lightly cooking it first in a microwave and then crumbling the fish. By mistake, I added the olive oil to the mix but compensated with a heavy dusting of bread crumbs -- otherwise the patties would have not held together. The mayo was OK, but I was more intrigued by couscous boiled in orange juice. By itself it could be the basis of dessert -- perhaps mixed with custard or cut fruit.

I don't like fish and especially not canned salmon, but really enjoyed this.  My cakes didn't stay together so next time I think I will use a whole egg.  But other than that, I enjoyed them as did my husband.

A little strange, certainly, but I think I like them! Hubby and daughter did not like, though.

this was good, i did use 2 eggs though and i used cooked rice and kale...i did have to add a little bread crumbs to make em a little less water-y....but this was a good way to have canned salmon...i am thinking of other things i can mix into my salmon, mushrooms, capers, onions, peppers...chachacha

I love this recipe - it is different than the standard fare and delicious. One piece of advice: buy skinless and boneless salmon. Otherwise, you'll spend half the preparation time picking salmon. I also use two full eggs instead of the yolks. That seems to help keep it together more. I've used fresh spinach in the past, and although it tastes delicious, it makes keeping the cakes together challenging. I also bake the cakes instead of frying them - it's probably easier in the end.

These turned out way better than I thought they would. I didn't have regular orange juice but had tons of oranges, so I squeezed fresh juice for my couscous. I left in the pulp, added water and lemon juice (made the whole box). I also used fresh salmon baked with s/p and olive oil, and fresh spinach squeezed well. I added extra cumin because we love it's flavor and baked them at 350 for about 35min. I didn't make the mayo sauce cause I always make some sort of mayo sauce. Instead I went for a tzatziki sauce off of this site.  This was nothing like the salmon cakes I grew up with... thank goodness. Thanks Emily, I can't wait to make this when my husband comes home.

My crew likes these a lot better when the patties are thin and not thick. We put the leftovers in the fridge and they are good for a cold lunch the next day.

These patties were too wet, and hardly had any flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, and maybe should have used half the amount of yolks and spinach, and doubled or even quadrupled the cumin, but I didn't.  The recipe as it is didn't work for me.  I realize it's a basic recipe, but I wouldn't even try to make these again.

Yum. Delicious. I accidentally forgot to add the spinach the first time I made this, and prefer it that way. Gives it more crunch.

I made slight changes/additions. I used roasted garlic in the mayo instead of fresh. I made these into mini patties and pan fried them. I topped with a dollop of the mayo and then some fish roe both for color and added richness. If you can find salmon roe that works the best.

I've had this twice already, and it is a tasty lunch when paired with a side of vegetables or salad. I did increase the garlic to my liking in both the mayo and the salmon cake, and also added some dijon to the mayonnaise. I found the mixture very crumbly, so I made smaller cakes (appy or tapa sized versions) and panfried them up. Tasty way to use up canned salmon and couscous!

I accidently used 1 cup of couscous, but just doubled the salmon.  Great taste.  I also forgot the salt, but with the mayonnaise I didn't notice it.    I did add at least 1 tablespoon of paprika to the mayo. Will make again and will definitley share!

Something was terribly wrong with this recipe.  I love salmon patties.  I don't care for spinach by itself, but in something it is okay, so I thought this would be a perfect way to get my veggie in with my salmon.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  I didn't even add extra garlic this time, and I am prone to doing that.

The patties would not stay together at all.  The salmon was very fishy tasting, which isn't the recipes fault.  As a result, the dish was not edible.  I was going to rate it a 1 because of that, but gave it a 3 because it was mostly not edible because of the taste of the particular salmon I purchased.  On the other hand, the garlic mayo was fabulous.  I kept it for another use.

I loved the idea of the spinach and couscous.  The recipe was not complicated, but it was very time consuming.  I would never make this again.

This was very easy to make and delicious!  Even my picky kids enjoyed it very much.  I thought it would taste very "orangey" having to cook the couscous in orange juice but it doesn't at all...  It's very flavorful and the patties fry nicely.

These had good flavor, but they fell apart.  I will use whole eggs next time instead of just yolks.  I also thought they were too greasy- they just soaked up the oil, so I had to put more so they wouldn't burn in the pan...Next time I will bake them.
Another note:  I had never used a 15 oz. can of salmon before (only the smaller ones), and it was GROSS.  I don't know if it was the generic grocery-store brand I used, but there was skin and bones in the can!!! I managed to pick that out, but next time I will either use the good-quality cans of salmon I've gotten at Costco before, or I will use fresh.

I thought this recipe was great.  My family wasn't as crazy about it but they aren't big salmon lovers anyway so the fact that they ate it at all says something for it.  I had no problem at all with it falling apart like some others had.  I was kind of nervous about that and was going to add extra egg if it seemed like it was going to be a problem as so many reviews noted but it wasn't necessary.  The only thing that I can figure is that the couscous seems to be the "glue" that holds it all together.  The recipe calls for 1/2 cup but it doesn't specify if that's before or after cooking.  I cooked the 1/2 cup and used the full amount in the recipe and had no problems.  I think if you just used 1/2 cup of the cooked it probably would fall apart.  Just a guess.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Also, we all liked the garlic mayo as a dip.  I wasn't sure about that either - it doesn't sound all that appealing but it was very good and complemented the salmon nicely.

Despite the fact that this recipe looked bizzare, these patties actually tasted terrific. They were a fabulous blend of unusual flavors. I used two full eggs instead of just the yolks, and used a bit more couscous than called for. Thanks for a winner.

I'll use one or two whole eggs instead of just the yolks when I make them again. Tasty. I agree the fish flavor is a bit strong though. I might use a higher ratio of cous cous to salmon when I make them again.

YUM!  I used whole wheat couscous, low-fat mayo, fresh salmon, and an extra 1/2 tsp cumin, and oh, my.... very delicious!  I think next time I might cook the couscous in lemon or lime juice, just to see what happens.

These were awsome ! Best Salmon patty's I've ever made. The garlic mayo sauce was great but fatty. Lemon juice would be good on them.Definetly will make again.

This was so popular, I made it again just a few days later -- a double batch the second time! The mayo is surprisingly good, too, definitely a must-have for this meal.

These were BEAUTIFUL!  I would definitely add more orange juice next time.  Couldn't really taste it.  I also served them with a horseradish sauce instead of garlic mayonnaise.  I love cumin, and that was the perfect addition!  My dinner guests were very impressed.  Have already made them twice. Even my mom loved them.  Thanks!

I used quinoa in place of couscous and added curry powder to the mayonnaise. It was  phenomenal! Easy and quick.

This was soooooo good!! The garlic mayo sauce was actually really good , I used Helman's Olive Oil Mayo so that may have helped because I saw plenty of reviews saying it wasn't good. I used fresh wild caught salmon and just skinned it and chopped it and that worked awesome instead of canned salmon!  Also I did add just a bit of whole wheat flour to thicken it as it is really soupy and cooked them in coconut oil letting each size get crispy. Love, love, love this dish!

This dish is extremely flavorful! Even though I made the mistake of adding the olive oil to the mixture and didn't have orange juice it turned out great. I used no sugar added orange marmalade as it was the only citrus I had available. My husband and I both enjoyed every bite. Thanks for sharing, we will be revisiting this one on a regular basis.

Great recipe, both for the salmon cakes and the mayonnaise!  I did not fry in oil, but I did spray the pan!  These were more crumbly than I expected, but that is the nature of couscous!  I'll be making these again!

Very good!  I used fresh salmon which I baked ahead of time.  I left out the spinach and used one egg rather than the 2 egg yokes.  I also used only 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  This is one of the few recipes that my husband has raved about.

These had great flavor, but they totally fell apart when I tried to pan fry them, even though I made the patties ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.  I salvaged what I could and put these in the oven on 350 for 20 minutes.  If you are going to pan fry them, they need at least 3 whole eggs in the mixture to keep it together.

Lacked flavor (cakes) and the mayo could have had more flavor and I added 2 cloves.  I think I would use sour cream instead of Mayo if I made them again and make a cucumber sauce for a more greek flavor.  I think I will leave out the couscous out  and add lemon not orange.    So it is a good idea but I would not make this recipe again.  But if you do use two WHOLE eggs or they will not stick.

I LOVED this recipe.  Very easy to make and tasted delicious.  My only thing would be that I would have liked to know the size of the patties as I made 6, but really should have made 8 smaller ones.

This is really good! To get more of an orange taste, I add orange rind to the mixture.  Try baking them in mini-muffin pans @350 for 25 min. If you do, sprinkle some paprika on top of them for toasted appearance.  I also like to spice things up with some cayenne in the mayo. This one's a keeper!

I will never make just "regular" salmon patties again! These were amazing! I only had flavored couscous; it just happened to be spinach and tomato. 
I did use 2 whole eggs instead of just the yolks.  I served this dish with some of the leftover couscous that I had cooked for the recipe and the Morrocan Cooked Pepper Salad recipe also on allrecipes.com; I added a can of black beans to the pepper salad.  This was an amazing meal! I will definitely cook again!

Good flavours and a nice idea but I found them too dry and difficult to form into patties as the mixture wouldn't stick together. Flipping them was even harder. I won't make them again, but if I did, I'd add another egg to bind them.

Excellent! But I think it would be better to use yogurt, sour milk but not mayonnaise for more arabic taste.

My husband and I love this dish. It is very easy to prepare and I always make extra garlic mayo (we like it on other things). I found that using two whole eggs keeps the patties together a bit better.  I use extra salmon also.

Some fell apart when being fried, try refrigerating longer before cooking.  I used up the leftover salmon, I will try using the canned salmon sometime.

We thought this was really good.  My whole family enjoyed it, even our 20 month old and 3 year old.  I did bake it as suggested, to cut down on fat, also I used plain yogurt in the sauce.  

Side note: my husband gave it 4.5 stars for the leftovers on a whole wheat roll with the sauce for lunch the next day.

Very easy to make & very tasty! Made cakes exactly as shown.  Wonderful!  I halved the mayo and used more paprika & a pinch of salt (to taste).  If you like aioli, definitely make the mayo.

I loved this! I used whole wheat couscous and I don't think it hurt it at all. It would be really nice with a salad or in a sandwich and I think tzaziki would really yummy with it.

These are very yummy and the mayo is great. I gave it 4 stars because when I prepared according to the recipe, i found the patties did not stick together well, it was all too moist--i added bread crumbs to the mixture until I could form patties that held together. I didn't use spinach (as mentioned by others). I baked at 375 for 25 mins. My 3 year old son LOVED it--and loved the mayo sauce.

Oh my, these were soooo delicious!  Super easy to make, and extremely good.  Next time I will try using the juice of the salmon (I drained it off, since the recipe didn't say) or adding another egg, as our patties were a little crumbly.  Other than that, perfect. Don't dare leave off the sauce, it's killer and makes it!  A real keeper-- I think we'll have these once a week.  Thanks!

very good recipe.. we fried some cutup squash, asparagas, onion and other veggies in olive oil and seasoning and put the left over couscous in with it for a tasty side dish. 2 eggs didn't make it stick together well so maybe next time 3 whole eggs. overall very tasty dish and easy to make.

The wonderful mix of ingredients lends great flavor to these cakes!  They have so much flavor, I don't like to put the garlic mayonnaise on mine.  I tend to have trouble with them sticking to the pan, even if I use more oil, so the next time I am going to try baking the mixture in a small loaf pan.  Also, I use the entire eggs rather than just the yolks.

I should of listened to my gut instinct and baked these instead of frying them.  I'm terrible at frying, and for some reason, no matter what size of a patty I made, they burned on the outside, before falling apart.  I was able to savage two small patties from the batch.  That said, the taste of these were TERRIFIC.  10+++ stars.  I used miracle whip instead of mayo (I like it sweet).  Wow, so so good.  I'm sorry I only was able to get two, because I want more.  Next time I'll bake them in small patties.
Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was good. I followed the instructions exactly and it came out well. I think I would like to add a little more flavor to the salmon. And I did add significantly more Paprika to the mayo and it was quite tasty.

I used an extra egg & some more flavoring when I made this recipe. I loved it!!! To add some extra flare, I placed the salmon cakes on a bed of carrot/potato hash, then dolloped with the garlic mayo and sprinkled with paprika. It looked so gourmet!!!

I am on the fence about these.  I followed the recipe with the exception of cooking the couscous in OJ (did not have any), and I baked instead of fried to cut back on fat.  I thought they were just ok.  I liked the texture with the couscous.  I think what I did not like was maybe the cumin.  I like cumin in Mexican dishes, but I thought it was a strange combo with the salmon.  Maybe next time I would try curry powder instead?  I am not sure.  My husband really liked them though, so I will definitely try again with some adjusmtents.  I got 8 baseball-sized cakes out of the mixture.

These tasted fantastic, but I had a world of problems with them! My "cakes" fell apart as soon as I'd let go of them. They were tasty enough, but I started to get pretty frustrated with them, so while I'd make them again, it probably won't be any time soon. Oh, and next time, I'm omitting the paprika from the Garlic Mayo. I guess my fiancee said it best when he said "Honey, this is the best 'Fish Hash with Pink Sauce' I've ever had."

This was good....but my family enjoys crab cakes much more.  I will still throw these in every once and a while.  I used all the eggs (not just the yolks) and chicken broth instead of the OJ

This was a great alternative to the old-fashioned salmon cakes I grew up.  I did get a weird aftertaste, but I think that was the spinach, which I actually may not like.  (I've only recently started eating it, but normally smother the taste with cheese.)  I used brown rice instead of couscous, since I had it on hand, but I tried to mash it a little before mixing it in.  I used the one egg I had instead of two yolks. I followed the earlier advice of using the 1/3 C measuring cup sprayed with PAM to make patties, which worked great! (made 10)  Perhaps if I actually cooked on regular basis, I would have already known this revolutionary strategy!  I also baked instead of frying, because other salmon cakes have funked up the whole house for 2 days when fried and I didn't want to risk it. The garlic mayo was just okay to me, but it may have been because I used bottled minced garlic, rather than crushed.  I liked it better with a sauce from another recipe of equal parts honey mustard and mayo, which neutralized the aforementioned aftertaste.  I'll be making this again!

Pretty good! I refrigerated the mixture for about a half hour to make sure it stayed together. I really liked the mayo mix - it makes the recipe!

These were quite tasty!  They're lighter and less fishy-tasting than ordinary salmon cakes.  My husband didn't like them, but that just left more for me!  I would definitely make these again.
