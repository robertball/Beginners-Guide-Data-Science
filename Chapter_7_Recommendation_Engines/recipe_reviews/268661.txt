Delicious and impressive appetizer.  Fig preserve works well if fresh figs are not available.

Very simple to make and very tasty.  I couldn't find any honey goat cheese so I just added a bit of honey to regular goat cheese. Worked well and you can adjust it to your own tastes.

I love this combination of sweet, savory, salty, and smoky. I'm going to try this with fig jam instead of fresh figs and see how that turns out, too.
