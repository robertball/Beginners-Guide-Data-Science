I made this today and while I was hesitant because there weren't any reviews I was blown away!  The pork had amazing flavor and was extremely tender.  One thing I did was add a can of diced tomatoes.  I also poured the liquid into a sauce pan after the pork was cooked, added a little bit of flour and corn starch and made a gravy.  I served the pork and gravy over rice with the veggies on the side and it was a huge hit!

I was a little nervous about trying this since there were so few reviews, but I did and it was wonderful. I couldn't stop eating it. I will be making this again. My whole family loved it.

I hate how everything I cook in the crockpot tastes like stew. The pork definitely wasn't stew-like - it had a nice flavor. But I didn't care for the stew-y potatoes and carrots. I'll just leave them out next time.

This was very good.  I've never had a roast spiced quite like this before, but I'm glad that I tried it.  I actually had to substitute diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce because it was what I had on hand, and it was still very good.  Also, next time I do it I think I will add slightly less of the crushed red pepper I think, but overall it was a hit.  My boyfriend even liked it, and he's a VERY picky eater!

This recipe came out delicious with a few modifications. Used a head of cabbage (chunked) instead of potatoes - fabulous and much less starch. Kind of like a fancy, mild sauerkraut mix. Also used Red wine vinegar - which added a touch of body & sweetness. Used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. YUMMMMMMMMM !! I will make this recipe again and again!!!

I made this recipe the other day for my family.  It came out very well.  The only thing I did different from the original recipe was add mushrooms.

Yummy! I cooked this on the stove top in a big covered pot. It takes about 1.5 - 2 hours this way. The vegetables only need about 1 hour though. I deducted a star because it definitely needs more spice to it.
I usually add some cumin, oregano, basil, a bullion cube, salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of sugar to counteract the acidity in the tomato sauce. With the additions that I made, it is easily a 5 star dinner.

Just a hint for folks trying this for the first time - please make sure you enjoy the flavor of vinegar as it does alter the flavor of the food. However, if you are unsure, you can always use less than the recipe calls for for the first time. One reviewer used cabbage - thanks for the idea. I may just try it myself!

Really good recipe; turns out excellent.  I had a bit of an issue with my roast, but only because it was bone in, I think. It was really big so I had to cut up a few of the potatoes and move them around to make them all fit.  I had this on low for 10 hours and the roast was falling apart and extremely flavorful.  Makes a lot, and hubs and I ate it for a couple of meals.  Thanks for the recipe.

OMG.... I could squeal like a little girl!  This turned out so very delicious. This will be a new go to for crock pot meals. Only substitute was I used 4 large 2" thick cut pork chops as that's what I had on hand. Would so recommend this to anyone. And so very easy.

I really love this recipe! So simple but the flavors work really well together. I admit I was a little skeptical because of the lack of reviews as well but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Leftovers are great for pork tacos! Just thicken the sauce by simmering it for a while then add the leftover meat, shredded, into the sauce and warm through. Serve it up on a warm corn tortilla with your favorite toppings (I usually go with beans, shredded cabbage, shredded cheese, and a squeeze of lime). I look forward to leftovers with this recipe! Thanks for posting!

This was amazing and the whole family loved it. I used a dutch oven and cooked for a little over 2 hours, adding the potatoes for the last hour. I also used a few spices suggested by another reviewer - cumin, basil, oregano, salt and pepper - in addition to the garlic and red pepper flakes.

This was surprisingly delicious. My son & I both really loved it.  I might add green beans next time, it seems they'd go well with the flavors.  I did add a can of diced tomatoes along with the tomato sauce - it was wet but just so delicious and we liked having the pieces of tomatoes as well.

came out pretty good. If i would have read the reviews beforehand i would have used cabbage instead of potatoes and it would have gotten 5 stars from me.

I substituted so much on this recipe, I really shouldn't rate it. Following one reviewer I used cabbage; because I didn't have all the ingredients, particularly the wine and the chicken broth, I used balsamic vinegar and ginger ale. Tasting it, I thought it was too sour, so I thought the ginger ale would add some pep and sweetness. The result? It tasted okay, but upset my sensitive stomach -- I think because it was too fatty, but who knows? A god recipe to work with, I was a little too creative.

It was ok. The veggies were pretty sour but I didn't measure out the vinegar. To make this recipe a four or five I would add sugar or stevia to make a sweet and sour taste.

Followed the recipe to a "T" and it was not. It was so sour. Very disappointed.
