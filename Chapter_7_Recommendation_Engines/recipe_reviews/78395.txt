I tried this recipe because Pauline Werner said that it goes back four generations. It indeed, tasted like the stew that my mother used to make. I was never able to make my stew taste quite like hers, until now.

The best stew I have ever had!  My whole family loved it.  Super easy to make.  Made the whole house smell terrific.  With dinner rolls, the perfect meal for a cold evening.  I usually add dried thyme - I think it adds a traditional "stew" flavour.

A very delicious recipe, and so easy to prepare! I used beef broth instead of water, and it sure gave it that slow-cooked, savory taste!

This is a basic beef stew which is made better by substituting the tomato sauce with a can of stewed tomatoes and adding a package of onion soup mix with the water. This tastes fresher and more flavorful!

This was a great stew, but I did need to add more to it as it seemed bland to me. So I added garlic powder and some thyme....and kosher salt. I think next time I will use a beef or vegetabe broth. Overall, it turned out great!

By far the easiest and best beef stew recipe I've ever had.  I wouldn't make any changes to the base recipe, however just because my family likes them in beef stew, I also added a drained can of baby green peas and drained can of whole kernel corn toward the end of cooking time.  Amazingly delicious!!

I just had my wife's mother over for dinner and I made this stew. The smell wafting throughout the house was almost as good as actually eating this delicious stew. It was truly a great dinner, thanks!

I have tried many different beef stew recipes recently and this is by far the best! It gives that authentic beef stew flavor. We LOVED it! 
I did add a pinch of ground thyme and @ 2 tsp. of worcestershire sauce for more authentic flavor. I also find it's easier to coat beef stew cubes with flour if you combine the beef cubes and flour in a sealed container and shake (rather than trying to "dredge" them in flour).
This is definitely a keeper!

This was yummy! ^_^ My room mate and I loved it.
If you switch beef broth for the tomato and thicken it, it's really good too.

Admittedly, I am from New Zealand, and this is just a typical stew over this side of the world. If the stew was oven heated on a low setting for around three hours, the meat would melt in your mouth and the flavours would have melded together better. A nice recipe though.

The only think I did different was to add : a can of lima beans, large can of veg-all, couple of dashes of Worcestershire and a beef cube. Didn't have bay leaf so I added a little all-purpose seasoning. This was super. Hubby loved it! THANKS!

Made a second time and was different. Not as good as my first time. I think I put too much water. Also, I added a package of onion mix like someone suggested instead of the tomato sauce, because my Fiance said the previous one had too much of a tomato taste. It still came out delicious and I added...Sazon package with tsp of Worcestershire sauce. Very easy to make. I really enjoy cooking this dish.

My husband really enjoyed this stew tonight. The how smells wonderful! I did, however, add quite a few extras. Worstershire, basil, garlic, and a little chili powder. Great base recipe. Kind of a clean slate to flavor it however you like. Oh, and I substitued beef broth for the water for extra flavor.

A great recipe for beginners! I have a feeling I'll be using this one for years. I also tossed in a half-cup pearl barley (no need to precook, it cooks in the stew) and it turned out delicious! A big hit at my place.

Fantastic.  We had wheat flour and it turned out great.  I added way more veggies than it called for and next time will try adding green beans.

I did make two small changes - instead of water, I did a beef broth, and I also added some dried thyme (about a teaspoon and a half).  Excellent!

The first time I tried this stew, it turned out delicious. I refined the recipe a bit. Definitely coat the beef by shaking it with the flour, salt and pepper in a ziploc bag. Also, add more flour than the recipe calls for. This is the thickening agent that will result in a gravy-like broth. I added one can of beef broth to the water that I added to the pot after the beef was browned. Leave the cover off the pan while the stew cooks after the veggies are added. This thickens the broth and intensifies the flavor. The veggies still cook fine with the cover off. And season to taste with salt and pepper toward the end of the cook time. The result is a classic hearty beef stew with a rich, meaty flavor.

I used a combo of beef broth and red wine instead of water and this was absolutley delicious.  I also added a can each of corn and green beans.  My family loved it and they thought the red wine really provided a great flavor.  It was perfect with a nice bread.  Will definitely keep this recipe close by for this winter.

So easy and so good.  I added beef cubes (3-4) to the hot water instead of using beef broth.  Also, I added 1 TBS. of A1 sauce.  Thanks for sharing such a simple and delicious recipe.

This is pretty close to my mom's recipe- very easy. Omitted the tomato sauce and subbed beef bouillon for the water. Thickened with a little flour in water at the end. If you're not familiar with thickening, remember to mix the flour or cornstarch with cold water first and add it slowly to the pot. This will avoid lumps. The stew turned out really good- even better the next day!

This is the best beef stew recipe I've ever tried, and the only one I'll keep making.  I've made it at least 10 times this year. I add a little red wine and beef broth to the water in the beginning. This is #1!!!! Thank you!!

I added more flavouring than the recipe called for - used beef bouillion like most people, and added maggi to individual taste.  I added more barley than I should have, but that's my own fault - I'll make this again and next time use less barley.
Definitely serve with a crusty bread! Mine was a pretty thick stew, but if you're finding it too thin add 1tbsp of cornstarch dissolved in 1tbsp hot water near the end.

This was easy and really good. I added beef broth instead of water and cooked on low for about 2 hours. I also added in the vegetables at the same time as the water and just let it cook slow. The meat was really tender. I called it "Pirate Stew" and served it with french bread - my kids gladly ate it up.

I like how easy it is to make. I used ground beef to shorten cooking time. Would like to add more seasoning next time. Maybe V8 juice?

Looking at the recipe's shortage of salt and previous reviewers' comments, I added 3 teaspoons of instant beef bouillon and the soup's flavor turned out delicious. I liked the addition of the tomato sauce. However, this dish (I think) isn't thick enough to be considered a stew. Maybe next time I'll add some cornstarch dissolved in equal parts water towards the end. It was pretty good, but there's nothing special about it. My hubby commented about adding some spice (maybe chili powder?) for a kick. Otherwise, this is the perfect soup for bread dunking on a cold winter night.

My husband and I thought this stew was delicious.  Because of the tomato, it gives the stew a different flavor than your normal boring beef stew.  I will use this recipe over and over.  Thanks.

This is a great stew recipe as is, but I made some modifications, and its now a staple at our house.  I don't dredge the beef in flour before browning, and I omitted the bay leaf and barley (my hubby isn't a fan of either in his stew).  My hubby snuck in the kitchen and spiked it with half a packet of beef stew seasoning once -- I was horrified at first! -- but it gave it some oomph.  Also, I added some (about a Tbs, maybe?) worchestershire sauce and a dash of crushed red pepper for some zing.  At the very end of cooking (the last 3-5 minutes), I stir in about a cup of frozen peas.  In my opinion, it makes the stew.  But even without all the modifying, I have to say, its a great recipe as-is!

I'd never made beef stew and this turned out great. I used chicken broth instead of water and it worked fine. I served it with steamed green beans and french bread--delicious!

Followed recipe exactly, but found it bland.  I added a McCormick's Stew Seas. Packet and some Worcestershire sauce, and it was better.  I've tried better stew recipes.

Of my mom's dinners ,her beef  stew was favorite meal. She gave the  me recipe twice and both times I lost it. She passed before I could ask again. I lamented over never having that stew again, until . I made this stew recipe tonight and it was my mom's  beef stew all over again! I'm  thrilled with it & I'm so happy that you shared it.

This was just okay.  The meat wasn't tender enough after that short cooking time.  We like our beef stew to be "stewy" not "brothy."  So I found a hint on another cooking site, which worked wonderfully to thicken this up.  It said to mix about 1/4 cup softened butter with 1/4 cup flour to make a paste. Then all you do is add about a tablespoon at a time to your soup until it it's as thick as you like.  I didn't really think this stew was that great though.  I think if I make it again, I will cook my meat in the slow cooker the day before.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was very good, but for our taste it needed a little more "umpf". I used at least 40 spritzers of Maggi Seasoning. Definitely a keeper!!!

Just the recipe I needed to make a hearty stew for a cold night.  This stew is the kind I grew up loving. Lots of flavor and a nice thick broth.  Perfect with cornbread or any good bread. This recipe doesn't need any changes but I like to use a can of beef broth with the water, some thyme, and a can of chopped tomatoes.

Simply delicious!!  My whole family enjoyed (even my 9 & 7 year old kids!). The only difference in my preparation from the recipe is I used a 16 ounce can of tomato sauce instead of an 8 ounce can.  Really wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't give it 5 stars only because if I wouldn't have added extra seasoning like other viewers recommended it would have been boring and bland.  I added thyme, red pepper, season salt,&onion powder.  Quick and easy to make, and always a hit with the guys!

It was a good start, I started by following the recipie, but then I realized it needed more potato alot more, and the broth had no flavor. I ended up adding alot, alot of seasonings. Pepper, salt, garlic, rosemary, tyme, and basil.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to use beef broth instead of water and a bit more of different seasonings for added flavor. I also used a roux to thicken the sauce, since it was a bit too watery for my taste. My entire family, including my picky 2 1/2 year old cleaned the pot!

this recipie was wonderful!  I have never made beef stew because most of the ones i have tried I have not enjoyed.  This one however was great.  I added corn which was a delicious addition.  ANd the flaver was a little mild for my taste so I added beef boullion to taste which kicked it up a notch and made it amazing!!

This was a really easy a tasty recipe. It was a last second thing.."hey can you make beef stew for dinner!?" I changed it up a little by adding fresh corn and fresh green beans! I also added corn starch to thicken it up a little bit. All in all it is a very tasty recipe!

Very good recipe.  I added Seasoning Salt and used 1/2 beef broth/1/2 water for more flavor.  I also mixed warm water and cornstarch and then added to stew for a thicker consistency.

This stew was quite simple to make, which is great for me.  I actually made mine within an hour, and didn't stew the meat as long.  The taste is hearty, and classic.  I will make this again.

I was NOT impressed with this recipe. First of all, after cooking it according to the directions for the length of time specified, the potatoes and carrots were still raw! Gross! We couldn't eat it! I had to increase the temperature and cook it for an extra 1-2 hours, and then we had it for leftovers the next day. It was  better, of course, with the veggies cooked, but... we still found it very bland and unimpressive. I will not make this recipe again.

Simple recipe, REALLY good!  Added thyme as suggested, and 1/8 t. allspice at the end.

I have prepared this for my family twice now, with very little variation in the recipe. We love it. Great with crusty french bread.

ok i didn't use the celery cause i didn't have any but used the seed instead for flavor. still took longer to cook and needed more salt and veggies so i added a can of peas and was a little better. will probably make again.

This is a classic and traditional stew recipe.  I did add some thyme and a few other personal things but it was good.  The flavor is a little bland but still it was great!
