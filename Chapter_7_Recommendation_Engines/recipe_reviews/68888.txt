This recipe was good my family loved it.  The only thing I did differently was I cooked the stew meat, fresh vegatables (carrots & potatoes), chicken broth and the cream of chicken soup in the crockpot on low until dinner time then I transfered it toa baking dish and put the cresant rolls on top and baked for 10 minutes. It was great and saved a lot of time doing it in the crock pot.

This was easy to make, a nice change of pace from my usual beef stew (which has a tomato-based sauce) and VERY flavorful.  I followed the directions almost exactly, except I added fresh ground pepper (I put it in practically everything) and I sprinkled paprika on top of the crescent roll dough to add a nice color to the crust.  I used the reduced fat crescent rolls too just to lower the fat content some, and reduced sodium chicken broth.  Although I think this stew more accurately serves 4 than 8.

This was really good. I used the garlic butter crescent rolls and I served it over egg noodles. I also coated the beef with flour before I browned them. It was a tad salty but not too bad. Ill make it again.

We enjoyed this.  It's more like a skillet pot pie than a stew.  The only thing was that it was excessively salty.  I used reduced salt chicken broth and chicken soup, so it either came from the onion soup mix or the tenderizer or both.  So I'll make some adjustments on those next time.  Otherwise, a flavorful, enjoyable meal!

I cooked this on a stove top and omitted the rolls and meat tenderizer.  Add some fresh potatoes, and it's brilliant!

Its good but I will use half a pack of French onion soup mix. I added small red potatoes and used cream of mushroom soup. I made homemade frozen bread so didnâ€™t do the crescent rolls

I'm a beginner cook, and this came out great! Like previous reviews, I put the meat, broth, soup, fresh carrots and fresh potatoes in the crock pot. I did not use tenderizer or onion soup mix. At dinner time, I dumped it into the casserole dish, laid the crescent rolls on top, baked on 350 for 15 minutes. It was delicious and made a nice presentation. See the photo!

I tried this recipe on a Monday - to use up what was left of Sunday's roast beef. This recipe is very tasty. We both loved the flavour. Unfortunately, I was rushed when making it so it didn't turn out as I imagined. It seemed very soupy. The reason for that could have been because I was using cooked beef. I basically just had to heat everything up. Longer cooking would have resulted in less liquid.  When I make it again using leftover roast beef, I'll omit the chicken broth. If I make it with stewing beef, I'll add chicken broth. Anyway, this was very good and I'll make it again. It was perfect or a cold and rainy day!
