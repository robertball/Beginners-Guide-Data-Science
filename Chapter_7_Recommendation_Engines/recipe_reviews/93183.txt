These are fantastic!  I made them for the appetizer table before Christmas dinner and they were such a hit.  However!....I knew right away that the amount of filling sounded too small compared to the dough, so I used only one can of crescents and made the filling exactly like the recipe says.  The previous reviewer complained about cutting the triangles but that was the easiest part!  It took a while to get the wrapping technique perfected though.  Anyway, if you make this I highly suggest you either double the filling OR use only one can of crescents like I did.  The nature of the crescent dough is fluffy and layered, so the original amount of filling would just get lost in there.  Also I used quite a bit more sesame seeds than it called for...I think maybe that is a typo in the recipe?  Please check out my photos if you would like to see how these turned out!

Fast, easy, pretty, and tasty, this little recipe makes a wonderful appetizer.   Iâ€™m not a fan of canned crab but I did use it.  I would recommend using fresh crab though instead of the canned.

These were good-not show stopping-and not worth pinching and rolling 32 half triangles. Will not make again.

These were pretty good.  I actually didn't bother with cutting them into smaller triangles.  Thank you!

YUM!  My kids gave this mixed reviews, but they always complain.  It was so nice to have something so easy and yummy for dinner.  We ended up only using 1 can of cressent rolls instead of 2, didn't use green onion, 'cause none of us like it.  We replaced it with about 1/4 tsp. onion powder.  Didn't top with seasame seed, used shredded parm instead, cause that's what we had, and sounded good to me.  The biggest change we made was that I didn't have or want sweet and sour for dipping sauce.  My mom makes a similar dish - we call it chicken pockets - with chicken, cream cheese filling in a roll dough.  She serves it with chicken gravy made with chicken stock.  I made a simaliar gravy using the shrimp stock I saved from some Ramen Noodles.  It was delicious with the rolls.  We each had 3 for dinner with a salad,and it was a perfect dinner!
