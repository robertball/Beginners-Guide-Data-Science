I read several of the reviews and you can easily eliminate the sticking by using a metal rack on your baking sheet or foil. I also added some bread crumbs to thicken the mixture. I also added paprika, season salt, and red pepper flakes to mine for an extra kick, but the original flavors are good as written. I baked mine at 400 for 30 minutes and they baked wonderfully. For an extra flavor add some shredded parmesan or italian cheese blend towards the end so the cheese doesn't burn.

Very good, I mixed all my seasonings in a ziploc bag and tossed the wedges in it to coat, much easier and better coverage.

I mixed the seasoning with the olive oil and coated the potatoes in that mixture instead. Did not have the problem of sticking at all. Spicy potato dish and we like spicy, so this was a great accompaniment to our dinner.

Very tasty, followed recipe to a "T" and they have come out perfect each time.  Cooking time can be reduced a tad if you cut the wedges thinner and to keep them from sticking I covered my baking pan with heavy duty aluminum foil.  I don't buy frozen fries any more, now we make these!!  Everyone loves them.

They were only "ok" because I had to scrape most of the seasoning off after I baked them. They were so spicy, my kids (who are NOT picky eaters) would not touch them. Next time I will omit the chili powder and just go with the other seasonings. I will rate again once I have tried them without lighting my mouth on fire. Once the seasonings were scraped off with a knife, they were quite pleasant.

These are a hit in our house. I've experimented with different versions but this is our favorite. I leave the wedges thick in quarters instead of eighths and this makes the wedge softer. My husband likes to dip them in onion dip. I like mine drizzled with homemade 1000 Island dressing (another all recipe find)

Quite tasty and so easy.  As with another reviewer, I mixed the seasoning with the olive oil in a bowl and then added to the wedges, making sure I coated each one with the oil/seasoning mixture before putting the wedges on the baking sheet.  I did add a little rosemary and thyme to the seasoning (because we like those in my house).  I am definitely not a potato eater, but I will be making this dish again.

I used to make a mary browns inspired taters recipe exclusively but these were delicious. Much more messy as there is no eggs required and so far all the people I've made  these for loved them.

Made it just as described in the recipe. Very nice! After 35 minutes they weren't done yet, maybe I sliced my wedges too thickly. They were good to go after an additional 10 minutes.

I always add the oil and seasoning in a bowl with the potatoes to coat the potatoes well.   After reading the reviews I cut back a little on the chili and it worked out well for us.

Second time and the Family loves it. If you don't like them spicy only put half the amount of chili powder (which my daughter eats just fine), or eliminate all together if you can't stand any type of spice. Definitely in my saved. ????

I made these as directed only omitting the garlic due to an allergy.  They were very good and I can only imagine they'd be even better with garlic.  I used medium sized red potatoes and quartered them; they were done in 35 minutes as the recipe promised.  No complaints here.

I will definitely make these potatoes again! I actually drizzled more olive oil than the recipe called for and added more spices together and put them in a shaker to cover the potatoes. I used all the spices the recipe called for but added italian seasoning. I had to take it out at the end of the cook time, turn the potatoes over and broil them on low to get both sides crispy. 

I used 12 medium sized idaho russet potatoes and took them to a dinner with 11 people and they devoured them!

I had to use russets instead of reds (what we had on hand). The cooking time here was just a little too short for russets, maybe another 5 minutes would have been better. We also didn't use the chili powder (neither my wife or I are spicy). Our cooking doesn't tend to add salt, so the garlic salt was out, but Italian was in. So, I changed the heck out of this one. We will try this one again the proper way the recipe calls for next time :)

I thought these were pretty good. My only change next time is to either not add any extra salt or reduce the garlic salt. I had added 1/4 tsp sea salt and black pepper for double the recipe. So, they were a bit salty for me. Either way, they were so much better than frozen seasoned potatoes and I like that they didn't have an herb like coating like so many other recipes. These would go well with more main dishes and would even be fine to re-heat for breakfast. I had 8 medium to large yellow potatoes. I figured that was probably close to double the 6 smaller red potatoes. They filled a large sheet tray. So, I just doubled the oil and seasonings. I mixed the oil and seasonings separately and sprayed the baking sheet with pan spray and the potatoes also. drizzled and tossed the potatoes, with the seasoning, and then gave them one more final spray with cooking spray to hold on the coating. Mine did take approximately 1 hour to fully soften, flipping once. ty

LOVED THESE POTATOES! So easy AND so flavorful! The only modifications I made was to use non-stick foil to keep them from sticking & I turned them once while cooking to make sure they were good & crispy on the outside. I took them to a Super Bowl party of a friend who has to follow a gluten & dairy free diet. They were a hit! Some ate them as is & some were covering them with chili and cheese. Thank you Emily!

So delicious!! I followed the recipe as directed, but I mixed the ingredients in a ziplock bag for easier distribution. I baked them on my baking stone & they were phenomenal. My husband loved the 'heat' on these. I baked them for 38 minutes.

I halved the amount of chili powder and it was still way, way too spicy!! Also it was really annoying to try and coat the potatoes after they were on the tray. Next time I make these kind of potatoes I will just use a sprinkle of the chili powder and as others have suggested, put the olive oil and spices in a baggie to coat the potatoes.

Absolutely delicious ! I mixed the olive oil with the other ingredients together in a bowl and then I dipped the wedges in it to make sure they were all well coated, they turned out perfect !! This recipe will be a keeper :)

I made these as is and probably got more compliments from more people than I've ever gotten from a recipe. Even my 14 yr old son, who still won't eat anything, told me three times how good they were.

Yummy side dish.  I added seasoned salt and paprika.  I also baked on a rack over the baking sheet.

I make this recipe two or three times a month - not sure I can say that about any other recipe I grabbed online.

Good variants - potatoes other than red potatoes work just fine.  I love them with curry spices rather than chili spices.  Adding some cayenne and then dipping them in a dressing is yummy as well.

We like this one a lot.  I've made it several times.  I've seen the "sticking to the pan" in several reviews - solved it by lining my baking sheet with parchment.  Will make it again...and again.

I added some parsley and Montreal steak seasoning. I first put the olive oil in a bowl and mixed the cut potatoes and then added the seasoning and mixed it some more by hand. Finally I sprayed cooking spray on the baking sheet which worked great and I had no problem with potatoes sticking to pan. Yum!

These were good but they did not come out very crispy.  Will try increasing the temperature of the oven next time.

This was a really good recipe! I liked it a lot. I just guesstimated amounts of all the ingredients, mine were a little oily, I probably used too much olive oil. I used all the spices, but less of the chili powder. I added some parsley, oregano, and thyme as well, I like the herby clover. These are really easy, I will definitely make them again and maybe switch up the spices for a different taste. You should definitely turn them at least once. Mine didn't turn out very crispy, maybe because of the oil, but they were very soft and delicious. I had to cook mine for an additional 10 minutes as well. Overall easy, delicious recipe.

I love this recipe!!  Though, I made a few changes.  Instead of using a zip lock back I use bottle pump sprayer to spray the wedges.  Then I sprinkle the seasonings on top of the wedges, while adding garlic powder.
