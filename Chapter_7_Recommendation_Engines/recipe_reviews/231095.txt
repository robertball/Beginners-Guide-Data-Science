Flavor was good, hard not to mess up on that with bottled sauce.  The recipe doesn't specify the type (boil or no boil) noodles, so I used boil type so not much time saved for me. However, my family ate and liked it so we may have this one again.

Only difference is that I have always used ricotta and we add mushrooms to the sauce along with the meat. Slice/grate your own mozzarella and parmesan  -- the difference is amazing.

Instructions sound like more noodles are needed than called for in the ingredient list. It was ok taste-wise, I'm used to more noodles, meat, and cheese though.
