Really, really good and really, really easy.  I made the meatballs from scratch.  I used about 1.5 pounds of ground beef, 3/4 of a diced onion, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, @ 3 teaspoons of diced garlic, 1 teaspoon italian seasoning, salt, pepper, a little onion powder and a little seasoning salt.  I baked them for 25 mins on a broiler pan so the fat would drip off.

Once I added the meatballs to the sauce (I originally made a half batch of sauce since I only made 1.5 lbs of meat) I decided I wanted more sauce so added another can of cream of celery and then added 2 beef bullion cubes and about half a packet of dry onion soup mix since I didn't have any more canned onion soup.  I also added one soup can full of water.  I cooked the whole pot on high for about 3.5 hours on high and it was really delicious.  The only thing we felt it needed was more salt.

We'll most definitely have this again.

This was really good and REALLY easy! I made a couple modifications. I cut the recipe in half (makes a LOT!), used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery, and I didn't make it in my crockpot. I boiled the noodles, put the meatballs in the microwave, and threw all the other stuff in a pot on the stove to heat through. When it was all done I just mixed everything together. The crockpot would have worked great, but I didn't want to wait...I'm terrible about last minute meals, what can I say?! It ended up being SUPER quick and tasted great! My husband said "needs more mushrooms, but it's really good!" It's a really  tasty stroganoff. YUMMM!! I think it's a keeper!

I made quite a few changes, going with what  I had on hand.  First made my own meatballs, 1.25 pds ground beef, 1/2 cup oatmeal, 1 egg, 1 tsp italian seasoning, salt, and about1/2 cup minced onion.  Baked  these in foil lined pan in oven about 30 minutes.  Removed and drained.  For sauce used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1/2 envelope dry onion soup mix, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 cup milk.  Heated through added meatballs and served over buttered egg noodles.  Good flavor, similar to stroganoff

I made this using gravy mix,green peppers,grn onions and pre cooked meatballs(costcos kirkland brand). Add the sourcream right before you are going to eat. Slap it over some egg noodles.  My husband and kids LOVE this recipe.

Love these! I made them as described and then it hit me that these would be perfect appetizers st get-to-tethers. Have made them 3 times in the past 2 weeks and everyone loves them. I ahve made at least 8 copies of this recipe to give to people. I do recommend cutting the recipe down as it makes a lot!

Oh my gosh...so so good.  I made this and brought the leftovers to work.  My coworker tried it and made it that weekend for her parents, they all loved it.  So easy, my finicky 4 year old even loved them!  Great as leftovers too!

Much too "oniony" and salty if you do the recipe as indicated.  The second time I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery, low sodium beef broth instead of french onion soup, added fresh mushrooms at the end and it was great.  With my adaptations, I would rate it 5 star...

My family absolutley loves this recipe!  I cut it in half and use cream of mushroom instead of celery and I have used beef broth instead of onion soup.  It turns out great every time!  I also add a can of mushrooms and serve of noodles...no extra butter needed.  Delicious! UPDATE: I have made this so many times now and have it perfected...in my opinion at least...I now use 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 1 can beef broth mixed with 1 packet dry onion soup mix, 4 oz sour cream and 1 - 1 1/2 lbs meatballs.  It's so good!

Yes, this was very easy. A little salty, blame the canned soup for that. There was no way the sauce would cover 6 pounds of meatballs. I had 2 pounds and it worked quite nicely.

Excellent! Absolutely delicious! It's a bit rich and heavy but still it was just the best. I didn't use a crock pot. Instead I just cooked this on the stove for two 'n a half hours. It just melts in your mouth. And the butter noodles really ties the whole dish together. Great recipe!

My family loved it. It was quick and simple (just what I needed for a midweek meal). I cut the recipe in half and used the following: 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of condensed french onion soup, 1c of milk, 2-3 Tbsp of Parsley, 1Tbsp of garlic powder, 1 Tbsp of italian seasoning, and salt/pepper. I couldnt ask for an easier meal.

Excellent recipe. Will make again. I used 1 can each of the soups and 8 oz of sour cream with 2 lbs of meatballs. This made the perfect amount of gravy for our family. Fast easy recipe even the kids like. By the way I made it on the stove top in a hurry:)

This recipe is wonderful!  I actually substituted Lipton Recipe Secrets Onion soup/dip mix for the French onion soup because the 3 grocery stores I visited didn't have any condensed French onion soup.

I mixed in a cup of water to the onion soup mix and added it the same way as the directions said to add the French onion soup, and it turned out great!  Although, I'm sure another cup of water wouldn't have hurt to make the sauce a little thinner.

One day I will try this with the actual condensed French onion soup to see if it tastes any different, but for now this substitution is perfect!

A little too rich and creamy for our taste. Also lacking in flavor/seasonings. Okay if you are really into sout in a can casseroles.

Was a nice and easy week night option that kind of reminded me of the Salisbury Steak recipe from this site...not an equal subsitute for the flavor but certainly worth it from a time perspective.  The kids n(8 and 10) were hesitant at first (which surprised me, what kid doesn't like meatballs?)  Once they tried it, they gobbled it up.  Will definately make it again but will make more sauce next time.

This is the first time on allrecipes that i have been disappointed in a rating. I always read and compare and find what "fits" our family. I had so much hope for this one but it didn't work out. The recipe was simple but we didn't care for the flavor. Reminded me of a sort of beef stroganoff... very rich... salty... oniony. Ended up eating only a small helping. None of my family was crazy about it.

This was excellent and easy. The sauce was so good I am sure it could be used for lots of other dishes--I plan to use it to top roasted potatoes. I did cut the recipe in half and it still made for yummy leftovers. Highly recommend.

YUM!  These were a bit hit at my party.  I made my own meatballs the day before with 3 lbs. ground beef.  I cut the sauce recipe in half and pour the sauce over the meatballs and reheated in the crockpot.

This is delicious!  A few notes:      1.  I used spinach semolina egg noodles.      2.  I used organic cream of chicken and cream of celery soups.      3.  I made homemade meatballs.      4.  I like it saucy so I only used half the noodles suggested.  My son didn't like the sauce because of the sour cream.  He's not a sour cream fan.  My daughter loved it.

These were really pretty good for using frozen meatballs. I did only use a 4 lb bag of meatballs, 1 can cream celery, 1 can cream mushroom, & 1 can french onion. VERY salty just by itself but over noodles-just right! I did not butter the noodles, as I didn't want the extra salt. Thanks!

We've made these several times. They always go over big with my guys and I do like them. But they're a little on the salty side since they are full of processed foods. Still, nice and easy when you know you'll need a warm filling dinner after a cold day.

I halved the recipe (with 2 lbs of meatballs). The result was AMAZING!!! We had enough gravy and meatballs for both of us for two full meals (and snacking). I loved the simplicity of the recipe and it tasted like the IKEA Swedish meatballs. I sent this to all of my sisters.

This was a quick, easy recipe, and the meatballs were so, so good!  I used 99% fat free cream of mushroom soup and lite sour cream, and it was an excellent meal.

Half of this recipe will fill a large crock pot. I baked the meatballs for 30 min to render off some of the grease. I cooked the meatballs on low all day, then stirred in the cooked noodles just before serving. Perfect for a pot luck! Very easy and very yummy!

Very easy dinner and overall good taste. It was even easy enough for my husband to make!
Halved the recipe and then used 2 lbs of meatballs instead of 3. Definitely would not have been enough sauce for 3 lbs.

Yum, yum, YUM!  This was a whole family pleaser!  This recipe makes a ton of meatballs, we're a small family of 3 and I will definately half it next time.  My 6 year old daughter who is not a fan of meatballs actually had seconds!  This recipe is perfect for those Sunday afternoons when you're cleaing house, just put the ingredients into the crock pot and you about your business and then dinner is ready by 5!  Just make sure to skim all of the liquid fat from the top before serving.  this is also super yummy on toasted french bread, delicious!

My family and I LOVED this dish! The only thing I changed was that I cut it in 1/2 (made plenty for our family of 4), used turkey meatballs since that's what I had, and I added about 1/3 cup of milk because I was afraid the sauce might be too thick. Made more than enough gravy for the meatballs. I loved them just by themselves. My husband and kids ate them with mashed potatoes, using the sauce as gravy for the potatoes. Definitely a huge hit in our family! I didn't find that it was too salty, as some others had stated. Couldn't be happier to find such an easy, crowd-pleasing meal. Also, mine were done in 3 hours.

All I changed was the cream of celery, to cream of chicken (we HATE celery), and added a dry packet of ranch dressing. These came out tasting like awesome swedish meatballs. The whole family ate them for days, and I've been begged to make it for family events. thanks so much!

This is the weekend that my children are with their mom. Since I don't have them that often, I like the thought of tasty meals that require little effort. So, I figured I'd give this one a test drive before the kids visit again. Very, very easy and tasty. The only difference was that I picked up a bag of meatballs that was only a two-pounder rather than the three poinds the recipe asks for. Perfect amount! I placed it on medium on the slow cooker and in about an hour and a half, it was done. My slow cooker cooks hot, so I usually have to check the food early. The kids will love this, as do I. More time for fun and then you can end a busy day with a great meal! All you single dads out there... this is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!!!!!

This recipe is super easy. I love the sauce it makes It turns out, I don't like frozen Italian meatballs. I would gladly make this again with homemade meat balls because the sauce was yummy.  I sprinkled some French Fried onions on top of my bowl. It was just another layer of flavor.

Wow! This was fantastic. I used 1 bag of frozen italian style meatballs, 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1/2 can of water, 1 can of mushrooms, 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix, and 1 c of sour cream. I added it all to a crock pot and it was ready in 3 hours. I put some extra spices in and dill weed. Tasted like the best beef stroganoff I have ever made.

love this! it doesn't need changing! frozen meatballs are a wonderful invention for a quick meal that tastes like you spent ages on it. the gravy for this is perfect, i wouldn't have thought to combine these two soups but it's fabulous. my kids and hubby loved it and asked for the leftovers the following night ;) this will get put into regular rotation...

Keeper! I halved the recipe, and used cream of celery in place of the onion soup; also added 1 tbsp Italian seasonings, and served over wide egg noodles. So far, the half-recipe has served a family of 4 once, and again for 2 more servings (kids away!), and plenty left. I boiled a 12oz bag of wide egg noodles for half this recipe, turned out perfect.

I halved the recipe. The only 'cream of' soup I had was chicken, so I went with that (though I think mushrooms would be best). I was out of sour cream (not really a staple for us, as it is quite pricey) so I used 15% cooking cream + lemon juice to make it thicker, kind of like a buttermilk (this worked well enough for me). I used frozen Angus meatballs (Blue Menu variety from Loblaws). Looking back, I'd forgot to add the butter (would maybe be better used to saute some fresh veggies rather than buttering the noodles). I did have to use cornstarch to help thicken up the sauce. I would definitely add some, onion, garlic and mushrooms to to this next time. I did season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and Italian seasoning which helped a little. I used fettuccine pasta instead of the egg noodles as that is what I had on hand. Easy to throw together, but it does need some tweaking.

O my gosh, this was soooo easy and delicious!  Everyone in my family liked it.  I didn't read the recipe and I only bought a 2lb bag of meatballs but had the rest of ingrediants right.  I think 6lbs of meatballs woudn't give you a lot of gravy, I will use 4lbs next time.  The french onion soup is what makes this recipe.  This is for sure a make again and a recipe that I will share with others.

I cut the recipe down to 1 bag of meatballs and I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery (used CoC once and it was not very good).  These were great, very rich too.

This was delicious.  I halved the recipe and still had a lot of leftovers, but I'm sure it will be just as good reheated.  My store was out of French Onion soup, so I substituted Beef Consomme and some sliced onion.  Very fast and easy.  Cooking on high, make sure you stir occasionally to keep from burning.

Very good and easy!   I used my own homemade meatballs, so I didnt have as many as what the recipe called for.   Used 1 can of each and 8 oz of s. cream.  I also added fresh mushrooms for the last half hour.  I sprinkled it with parm. cheese just to top it off.  Might try to add a little cooking wine next time but will definitly make again.!

This is a family favorite. Mom made these for us kids, too. Only change I make is using cream of mushroom and adding fresh sauteed mushrooms and sweet onions. Very comforting and quite filling. It's even better the next day. NOTE: You can make it a little lighter by using Special Request Campbell's Soup, FF sour cream and serve it on whole wheat pasta, brown rice, or mashed cauliflower.

This was a life saver tonight- whole family loved it too, rare in our house!  I only had cream of mushroom soup so I used that and I added a packet of onion soup mix for fun!  Kiddos hate mushrooms and onions but didnt even taste them!  Thank you- this is a yummy, simple beef stroganoff-like dish- served with a salad its a perfect weekday meal!

I loved it! I did make homemade meatballs instead of using frozen. I used 2.5lbs of beef and thought the amount of sauce was just right. I attempted to healthy up by using low-fat sour cream and low-fat/low-sodium cream of mushroom soup (not a big fan of celery). It came out fantastic, but next time I will use the "full fat" ingredients--the missing fat and sodium kinda dumbed down the flavor, in my opinion. I also had an issue with the sour cream kinda clumping up in the sauce; I will add it near the end when I make this again. Finally, since I was getting ready for work, I set the crockpot up in the morning and put it all on low for 7 hours. When I got home, I made the noodles. What a hit!

This is such a good recipe, i did not substitute anything in this recipe.  Made it as recipe suggested.  It was AWESOME! My kids who are usually picky LOVED it they wanted seconds.  It tasted to us like beef stroganoff just with meatballs instead.  If you like hamburger helper meals than you will love this recipe! Very filling!

I expected big things after reading the reviews for this recipe. It turned out ok, but not earth shaking. Probably won't make this again. However, it did come together very easily and the kids liked it.

My family loved this! I used half package dry onion mix and a can of mushroom soup with milk instead of celery and French onion. My family likes sauce so I wanted to make extra sauce by adding some boiled milk and flour (thick and creamy) to the recipe. I also added a reviewers suggestion to add some (1/4 can) beef broth for added flavor. I followed the rest of the recipe. I served it with peas and noodles on the side. Fantastic together! Will keep as a regular for us!!

This was great. I was thinking of making my own meatballs, but to save time I used frozen ones. It tastes delicious. I did use about 1/4 cup of butter instead of 1/2. I also used 1 can of cream of celery and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. The meatballs pretty much melt in your mouth! Definitely putting this one in my recipe box =)

I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was delish! I usually follow other reviewers tips on modifications, but i decided to follow my instinct and just go with the original recipe and it turned out delish!! so quick and easy to make! Highly recommend it.

This was pretty good.  I halved everything and made "condensed french onion soup" from scratch.  I also used whole wheat rotini pasta instead of the egg noodles.  Oh, and I did everything on the stove top (took about 30 mins).

I found this recipe, years ago on here.  It has been a family favorite since.  I only use about 3 lbs of meatballs, as we like to have more sauce than meatballs.

I have been making something close to this recipe for about 46 years now, and everyone loves them.  The only difference is that I make my own meatballs with lean ground beef about a pound.  About a half cup oatmeal, about a quarter cup seasoned bread crumbs, 1/2 of a dice onion, 2 minced garlic cloves. 1 egg, 1 1/2 tsp Italian seasonings, 1/2 tsp sea salt.  Mix all together, form meatballs and bake on a broiler for about 1/2 hour or until inner temp reaches 160 degrees on a meat thermometer.  Then follow recipe as stated here, adjusting soups and cream cheese for a smaller amount of meatballs.

Not able to find condensed french onion soup at my grocery store, and discovering at home that I didn't have a dry mix on hand like I thought, I used a substitute mix that I put together - beef bouillon, onion flakes, onion powder, celery salt, lawry's seasoned salt, curry, sugar, parsley, and pepper.  I combined this with the one can of cream of celery soup, plus one soup can full of water, and cooked the meatballs in it on high all afternoon, then added the sour cream before serving. I also had to add a bit of corn starch to thicken it up.  Oh, and I sauteed some mushrooms/onions/garlic and threw those in, which pretty much made it amazing.  Actually I loved the flavor of the sauce with the buttered noodles, and would substitute the sauteed veggies for the meatballs altogether next time. But my husband loves meatballs, so I'll keep making it with those for him - he gave this a definite 5 stars, by the way.

This is indeed easy, but it is very "commercial" tasting.  Good for a quick throw-it-in-the-crockpot dinner, but you could get the same taste out of a can.  It is good, but don't expect homemade stroganoff.

I cooked this yesterday and it came out great.  I only cooked half of the amount in the recipe and that was more than enough for the 3 of us.  I will definitely cook this again and I will add more soup next time.

The French Oniion Soup was very over-powering in this.  Beef or chicken broth would be better.

To me, this recipe tasted a lot like Stouffer's frozen Swedish Meatballs, only fresher.  Being as that is my favorite frozen dinner, I really enjoyed this meal.  I used Kirkland Meatballs from Costco and they worked great.  I also added some minced onions for some extra flavor.  This recipe makes a lot, so I only used 1 can of each kind of soup, 8 ounces of sour cream, and half a cookie sheet of meatballs, and that made plenty.  This recipe is easy to make, inexpensive, and tastes great.  Also, I didn't make it in the slow cooker.  I just cooked the meatballs and noodles and added them into a pot with everything else.  It worked great and took very little time.  I have made other swedish meatball recipes from this site that took way more time and ingredients and didn't taste nearly as good.  It is a little rich though.

I thought this dish was very good. I used an 18oz can of french onion soup as opposed to the two cans the recipe called for in an effort to avoid the over-powering onion taste others complained of. I also used organic sour cream, a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and skipped the butter on the noodles. The dish is yummy and a good winter treat.

This sauce was awesome!  The hubby thought the meatballs should have been dispersed more so next time I might just do ground beef.  So tasty and addicting though, couldn't stop eating.

This was sooooo easy and sooooo good.  My husband loved this and ate the leftovers for two days.  That means a lot because he eats leftovers next to never, and eating leftovers more than once?  Unheard of.  Thanks for a yummy easy recipe.  This does make a lot.  I halved the recipe and we still had quite a bit of leftovers (for 2 people).

I made this for an office Christmas potluck and everyone raved about it.  This was my first attempt.  Instead of cooking it on high for 4 hours.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours and also added Garlic Salt and Pepper for a little more flavor.  I also eliminate the butter and noodles and served it over steamed white rice.  Yum!!  Thanks for the easy peasy recipe.

This is on my list of quick go to recipes. Very easy, I usually make fresh meatballs because I haven't found any frozen my family likes yet.

The sauce is fantastic and you can't beat this recipe for simplicity.  I'm just not a huge fan of frozen meatballs, so I think next time I'll probably make my own.  Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy and so easy!  I did add some chopped onions (DH loves them) and a few splashes of Worestershire sauce. Super great recipe!  I will be making this often!

Yes indeed very easy and tasty! If I have the time and energy I make my own meatballs, -mix up some ground chuck, parmesan, S & P, bread crumbs and an egg. Bake them in the oven and voila!
  I enjoyed this rich and hearty recipe.

Very good flavor.  I adapted the recipe to make on the stovetop instead of crockpot since I didn't have much time.  I made homemade meatballs in the oven, then cut the sauce recipe in 1/2 and put everything in a large saucepan to simmer for an hour.  Was a delicious dinner I'll be making again.

Very easy and very good.  I wasn't sure about using the cream of celery, but it was great.  My family loved them.  I did cut the recipe in half as it does make a lot.  Will definitely be putting this in the family favorites.

I made this last night and my daughter and boyfriend loved it. I thought it was very good too. I cut the recipe way down because it is just my boyfriend, me , and our daughter who is only 20 months old. Also I only cooked it on high for 2 hours then low for the other 2. This one is a keeper in my house!

Really yummy recipe, only changes I made were I used 1 can of Golden Mushroom Soup and 1 can Cream of potato soup as that is what I had on hand instead of the cream of celery soup.  Also added some Worcestershire sauce and some water when it became too thick.  Really easy and yummy. They are great over the noodles and also for a nice sandwich serve them on a toasted hoagie bun.

Great recipe, my family loved it! I used 2 cans low sodium cream of mushroom and 1 can of French onion. Not salty at all. I also took the advise of other reviewers and added the sour cream just before serving. Definitely a keeper!

I made this into a slow cooker freezer meal and it turned out great. 

I noticed that the sauce seemed to separate but I believe that was only due to my freezing it and it didn't make any difference on taste - only appearance. 

I used Kirkland (Costco) brand meatballs and the flavor of them combined with the sauce and buttery noodles really was fantastic. I was skeptical since it was just meatballs, sauce, and noodles but it really is very yummy. 

I put my mixture in my slow cooker when it was still about 75% frozen. I cooked it on low the whole time and it was done before 4 hours so cooking this on high for that long would NOT be a good idea. If you're using pre-cooked meatballs really it's just about getting it to the safe temp (usually around 160-165F). 

Since this recipe isn't really cooking anything it's mostly just heating it and letting the flavors marinate together. 

Would definitely recommend it though!

I ended up using this recipe idea as a base to use what I had in the kitchen.  I used a can of cream of chicken soup, an envelope of dry onion soup mix, a can of water and 1/2 a cup of plain yogurt.  To the gravy I added some frozen peas and cooked carrots.  I cooked this all in the microwave early in the morning added the meatballs.  The flavors seemed to really blend during the day.  It was a hit with the whole family.

Ok, I didn't really make this recipe but it helped me put dinner together. I used what I had which was 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 2 cans of beef broth. I sauteed minced onion in butter then added flour and made a gravy with the broth then added it to the rest of the ingredients listed. It turned out great. But, next time I'll follow this recipe to a T.

Super easy to make but it was not a hit in our house.  I thought it was salty ( I am not a salt person at all) and the kids for whatever reason would not eat it. DH didn't have to much to say so unless I get some real raves I don't see the point in making again.  However I definately say it's worth a try!  The only change was that I used the fast & friendly meatballs recipe on this site instead of prepacked.

Very easy and tasty. I cut the recipe in half because I was cooking for a small family rather than a crowd. The sauce would also work well on a beef roast or beef tips.

I tried these yesterday and loved them and it was so easy to make!! Normally I would have used Cream of Mushroom soup for something like this, but loved it with Cream of Celery. This was great!! I did change it up by only using 4 lbs of meatballs instead of the 6, but kept everything else the same as the recipe; I'm glad I did because it gave us more of the sauce to mix with the noodles, which we like. Will definitely make again!!

Awesome and easy - even my picky kids loved it. The only thing I did differently was add in a package of sliced mushrooms. I halved the recipe and used a 2 lb bag of meatballs, and there was plenty of sauce for the meatballs and the package of egg noodles. This one will be added to my family's regular rotation!

VERY easy and tasty.  They were a little rich.(Or perhaps I ate too much) Next time I may try low fat soup and omit butter on noodles.  Great leftovers too!!

It doesn't get easier than this.  Eventually, I'd prefer homemade meatballs because they always taste better, but this was still a nice, rich meal.  It filled us up and warmed us up.  Will make again!

Made this camping and it was a big hit.  I think it needed a little more flavor.  I'll try some of the suggestions next time.  Will make again soon.

This is AMAZING! Made a few minor modifications: added black pepper, garlic powder, and a lot more sour cream than the recipe called for. Split the recipe in half, and still had tons leftover. This will be in regular rotation at my house, for sure! Great for a chilly, winter day.

Wow!  Great dinner idea, especially for the kids.  I would have given it 5 stars but I prefer using Cream of Onion soup instead of mushroom.  To me mushroom soup is so distinctive I can always tell when it's in a dish.  Cream of Onion isn't overpowering with onion flavor and it doesn't overtake the rest of the ingredients.  Looking forward to having this dish again soon.

I originally gave this 4 stars but am coming back and changing it to 5 stars! These are so good and so easy!! I don't make them in a crockpot since it takes too long so I just make them in a pot on the stove and then throw them in the crockpot to keep them warm. They always get tons of compliments whenever I serve them!!

This recipe is easy and tastes great!  I have made it several times now.  Instead of the French Onion soup, I used the dried onion soup mix and added a can or so of water. Have used both cream of celery and cream of mushroom and both worked well.   It has alot of flavor and is now one of our family's favorites.

Wow, I really don't know why this recipe is rated so high. The sauce really tastes like condensed soup and sour cream...like it didn't come together. I could taste each ingredient separately. And it was really sour, so I think there's too much sour cream. I won't be making this again.

This was awesome! I work in a group home and all 10 of "my guys" loved this. I did add a few dashes Worcestershire and a little milk to thin the sauce. I smelled terrible until it was heated through, but smelled wonderful when it was finished.

Very easy, I didn't do it in my slow cooker, just on the stove top.  Family liked it, but it was very salty.  Also no need to butter the noodles, the sauce has enough grease in it.  I just used a tiny amount of olive oil to keep them from sticking together.

Being the scatterbrained person that I am, I forgot to put this recipe in the Crockpot before leaving for work.  This recipe worked just as well on the stove top.  I heated the sauce while the meatballs were cooking away in the oven.  I did add a bit of dill to the sauce.

It was very good, but {as like so many others} I had to make a few modifications.  2 cans of French Onion is too "onion-y" so I used 1 can French Onion, 1 large can cream of mushroom, and 1 reg can of cream of celery.  I also had to puree the soups, because my kids won't eat onions or mushrooms...but they loved this...hahahaha

I wasn't impressed with this.  Yes it was easy but it was SOOO heavy and greasy.  I think it would be much better using fat free sour cream and reduced fat soups.  I served it over whole wheat noodles.

Delicious and so simple!  How wonderful!  I did scale it back to only 6 servings but still used 1 full can of each soup.  It wasn't too much sauce at all. We enjoyed it a lot!

I have to give this 2 stars as written.  I like french onion soup, but this overpowered the sauce. I pitched it and started over with cream of mushroom soup and beef broth which tasted much better.  I added about half a packet of lipton onion soup.  My picky kids loved it and ate the leftovers the next day after school.  I will only make again without the french onion soup.

Newbies to cooking, look at the portion size. My husband and I loved it, but ate it for a while because 6 pounds of meatballs really didn't sink in as a lot. I would make 1/2 recipe next time.

I was just sharing this recipe with a friend and realized I never rated it!  I've made this three times now and it's been wonderful all three times.  I serve over regular egg noodles (skip the butter) or rice.  The kids love it, and it's great to dip biscuits in the gravy.  Made with about 2 - 2.5 lbs of meatballs there is plenty of gravy to sop up.  Yum!

Easy and so tasty!  I've served this for several batches of company, and everyone wants the recipe.  If in a hurry, I will zap the meatballs in the microwave before putting them into the crock pot, so the recipe takes less time.  A family favorite now!

I just made this for dinner and it was great! I cooked it for ten people and everyone loved it. I even got a child who hates sour cream  and cream casseroles to try and he couldn't stop eating it. Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper for me.

Really pretty good.  A bit salty with the french onion soup.  MUCH better with several generous dashes of worstershire sauce.  Thickened the sauce with a little bit of cornstarch.

This was an EXTREMELY easy recipe to put together and good. I would give it 5 stars for ease of recipe. It tastes like beef stroganoff but with meatballs.  If you aren't a fan of stroganoff (like my husband) - you probably won't like this.  I did everything as the recipe states, except, I cooked it for an hour on the stovetop instead of the crockpot and I used turkey meatballs.  I thought it was a four but my husband only gave it a 2.

This tasted pretty good-- the only thing is my sour cream seemed to have curdled or something in the liquid- that part was not so tasty.  I know I did something wrong, so next time hopefully it will come out better!  Maybe I'll add the sour cream at the very end- right before serving.  My husband really liked it though!

This dish is so good and so easy. My family absolutely loved it. I made it exactly by the recipe except that I cut it in half. It made a lot even though I only made half. I highly recommend it!

This was very good! I used turkey meatballs, used undiluted french onion soup and added a packet of onion soup mix and a little corn starch.  Oh, and I also added a tablespoon or two of ketchup! I served it over spaghetti and my 2 toddlers actually liked it!

very quick and easy.  I found there wasn't enough liquid after cooking a while.  I added some water and all was fine.  Good flavor and very quick and easy,  will be making this one again and again.

Unlike a lot of the reviewers I see on this site, I personally, really enjoy reading what others did to change a recipe.  In fact, I spend hours reading the reviews and opinions of others... which is so important to me! On this recipe,  I followed the advice of Melissa D and made this with her perfected changes and it was absolutely delicious!!    She used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can beef broth mixed with 1 packet dry onion soup mix and 4 oz sour cream.  I also fried an onion and put that along with these ingredients in the crock pot, added my meatballs and let it cook on low according to the time on the recipe.  I served with potatoes and the sauce made a delicious gravy that did NOT taste like canned soup at all!  The recipe I have for meatballs is THE BEST and I'll never change, just too many people love it.. 2 pounds ground beef, 1& 1/2 cups bread crumbs, 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup finely chopped onion, 2 eggs beaten, salt and pepper.  Roll in balls and bake on an edged cookie sheet at 375 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes.  You won't be disappointed!  This meatball recipe goes with all kinds of sauces and they're so good (yet so basic) that  you could eat them without a sauce.  Everyone loves them!

I really liked this. I cut the reciepe in half because there is no way the original one would fit in a crock pot. I also replaced cream of mushroom soup for cream of celery like a lot of others did. I didn't salt the noodles so it wouldn't be to salty but did add pepper once drained.

This was pretty good.   I would tweak the recipe to allow noodles to be added in meatballs and more french onion and celery to favor added noodles.  It was definitely quick and easy.

Added the butter to the noodles but totally forgot the sour cream. BUT...........this was awesome this way, nobody noticed! I made 1/2 this recipe, but next time I might make the full batch of sauce, just to have more gravy!

This is so easy! I didn't put two cans of onion soup only used one and so glad I did. It would have been way to much onion/salty for us. I also did low and slow in about 9 hours with approx 1 cup water. When  came home added a little more sour cream and perfect thickness for noodles. I used .99 bag meatballs and there was so much flavor.making it again tomorrow or church meeting.

I was trying to find something to do with a bag of frozen Italian meatballs when I came upon this recipe. After reading other reviews, I decided to cut the recipe in half. It was perfect for my family of 5 with enough for leftovers, too. I loved the flavor, but would leave the butter out of the noodles. The butter made the noodles too rich. Overall, good recipe.

I THINK WE HAVE A WINNER!!!!!  I love a quick middle-of-week meal, and this fits the bill.  I made my own meatballs with ground turkey.  One pack of turkey made 9 meatballs.  I used one can of condensed golden mushroom soup, one can of cream of celery soup, one can of water and about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  It made enough sauce for me to freeze some for next time!  I'm serving over egg noodles.  I started it when I got home from work, about 4:30, and it was ready at about 6:30.  Perfect.  Very different (but delicious) flavor.  Certainly going to make this again and again!

This is a great recipe if your looking for a quick dinner.  I only had 16oz if meatballs and used 1 can of cream of celery and french onion soup, then about 1/2-3/4 cup of sour cream.  I also added 1/2 cup of water to thin it out a little.

I halved the recipe, and did it on the stove. Used 2 12 oz bags of meatballs, and put as many in the sauce as I could. had leave a few out. heated over med heat for about 25 minutes. After the noodles were done I mixed it all together in a casserole dish so I can bring the leftovers to work tomorrow and feed some coworkers. It made a ton! (also left some of the noodles out, seemed like too much for the sauce) It was delicious, easy and pretty quick. Will definitely make again.

This was great! We followed some other reviewers suggestions and used cream of mushroom. It was great. I added additional mushrooms. Since we only used two lbs of meatballs, we only used 8ozs of sour cream. added less than 1/4c flour to thicken sauce up a little. If i could give a suggestion it would be to use low sodium soup. It was a little salty.

This was such a simple recipe that I can't wait to try at a large family gathering.  I did not make any modifications.  It was too big for just two of us but it has made good leftovers for lunch at work.  I am going to try to freeze some of the meat mixture.

Two stars for ease of this recipe, but zero for taste.  Unfortunately, even my boys who will eat anything didn't like this one.  It tasted very "canned", and very overpoweringly french onion (which usually I like).  We won't be making this one again....sorry.  :(

I was a little worried about this one.  I was pretty sure that this was just gonna be one of those meals that did the job of feeding my family but I wouldn't necessarily make again.  BOY was I wrong.  This dish is so simple but delish!  My hubby went up for a second bowl and raved about it.  I used the nice thick homestyle noodles which cost more but were so worth it.  I plan on making this next time I have my family over.  Something you can throw in the crockpot and forget it.

really tastie!! This has become a family favorite. The only thing i would suggest is cutting the recipe in half if you are serving for a small family. Even with me cutting this in half, my family of 4 had pleanty leftovers

SO So good I read the reviews and was worried about it being to salty and so I only used about 3/4 of the can of the french onion soup. And my family loved it. I added about 1/3 cup parmesan cheese to the noodles but other then that the recipie was left the same. Will for sure make again.

We will definiely be making this again.  I didn't have everything the recipe called for, so I improvised a little, using mushroom soup and onion soup mix.  The end result was saltier than I like, so I will change it up to make it less salty next time!  thanks for the  base recipe!

After a bit of hesitation, I decided to give this a whirl.  The family loved it.  To our surprise, it was sweet - not candy sweet, but sweet.  It may have been the meatballs I used.  I didn't have the Italian flavored meatballs, I used swedish instead.  Very good for a change.  I won't make this very frequently, but I will make it every once in a while.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this my own way and it was delish.  First I cut the ingredients in half since I was making it for 5  people.  I used my own turkey meatballs that I baked and did not use a slow cooker...just made the sauce and let the cooked meatballs sit in it for 10 minutes simmering....then threw everything over buttered noodles....very tasty and simple.

I made the following changes and LOVED it:  I made my own meatballs the night before, replaced one can of cream of celery with one can of cream of chicken instead, added 1/2 cup milk, put in crockpot for 9 hours, added fresh mushrooms about 1/2 hour before serving. I thought the flavor was perfect! I will make again for sure!

I was so surprised by the great flavor of these meatballs!  And they are so easy to make.  My only complaint is that the gravy turned out a little bit greasy (I'm not sure if it's from the meatballs themselves or the french onion soup.)  And it is a very salty dish.  I think I'll try them as a sandwich tomorrow!  These would also be good to serve as an appetizer.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

not crazy about this one.  The french onion soup taste is too strong.  I tried adding more sour cream and that didn't work either.

I didn't have cream of celery on hand so I used cream of mushroom instead, and added a few dashes of worcestershire, garlic powder, and pepper. I wasn't too keen on the flavor of the onion soup. Thought it overpowered the sauce. But my family LOVED it. Raved about it all night. Even still, next time I'll reduce the onion soup to one can or replace it with a dry mix.

Easy recipe to follow.  My hubby loved them.  I probably prefer more of a stroganoff type sauce or spicy/sweet, but this was good, goes well with the noodles.

Like it's name, easy and pleasing!  Better with fresh herbs over top, like parsley.  I could see a good garlic bread getting dipped in here.  Served it with salad and it was a hit!  Thanks!

I thought this was an okay recipe--good for a fairly quick meal.  But not great. I used cream of mushroom instead of celery.  And I added about 1/2 can of milk to tone down the onion flavor, which was pretty powerful.  I can't imagine adding a packet of dry onion soup mix as some reviewers suggested.

Eating this right now...quite tasty!! I only used 1 can each of the soups, an 8oz. container of sour cream, and a 2 pound bag of meatballs, and it was plenty for my husband and me...had enough left over for lunch tomorrow! Certainly will make A LOT as written and everyone will love it!

Everyone loved it.  I loved I could come fill up the crockpot and have a dinner cooking.  I used homestyle meatballs instead of italian.  My kids like opposite things usually both loved it.  Left overs lasted less than 24 hours.  Will mkae it again for sure

Meh. Made this for my fiance and I Sunday night. If I were rating on preparation only, I'd give this 10 stars (it is SOOO easy!). For taste, it's average at best (sorry!). One reviewer likened this to stroganoff. I agree, but think I'd prefer a more "traditional" recipe when the "craving" calls. And, I must say, the quality of the end product LARGELY depends on the quality of the meatballs used (I purchased a 1.5 lb. bag of Jennie-o Italian style turkey meatballs on sale at my local grocer, and, while I liked them, I wasn't blown away either; I would suggest making your own recipe rather than purchasing pre-processed ones). I was a bit concerned about adding a 16 oz. container of sour cream (I made enough sauce for the entire recipe - which btw, would not have been NEARLY enough to cover 6 lbs. of meatballs... my gosh!!!), but it was just fine. Served over buttered egg noodles (as directed) with a side of peas, jellied cranberry sauce and dark pumpernickel bread purchased at my local grocer's bakery. Thanks for sharing your idea, QUEENGODDESSNANCE! Unfortunately, this will not be a repeat at our house though :(

Six ingredients: open, pour, stir & 4 hours later supper's ready.  Tasted gourmet with a thick & hearty sauce we served over brown rice instead of buttered noodles.  My daughter made this and served to our family.  We all loved it!

Using the fat free cans was fine and I added more  onions, the guys loved it and a room mate  took the leftovers to work. Said that it was better the second time around.

This was really good.  I only used two pounds of ground beef and made my own meat balls, but made the sauce as stated.  I served over mashed potatoes.  Plenty of sauce for us.  I will make again.

This recipe is so easy and sooooo good! I halved the recipe but discovered that there wasn't enough sauce. Next time I will make the amount of sauce in the recipe but half the meatballs. It was so good over egg noodles but I'm thinking how good these meatballs would be for a buffet. Great, easy recipe for a crowd. Thanks for sharing it!

This really is Amazing and Easy!  Since it's only my daughter and me, I used one pound of Italian meatballs and halved the sauce ingredients.  What a great flavor combination.  My meatballs cooked longer than the recipe called for only because I put it all together before work and so they cooked for over 8 hours.  The only thing that did was reduce the sauce more than most would like probably.  I served them over rice and with maple dill carrots.  What a great meal!! Thanks Anna

These were really good.  Even my picker 4 yr old loved them.  I made some changes of course for what I had in the house.  Instead of frozen meatballs I made fresh ones with italian seasoning, I used cream of chicken soup, a can of french onion soup not condensed and added mushrooms.

Awesome just as is.  I used 2 lb. Armour Original Meatballs (bite size, maybe 20-25 meatballs per lb., not the big Italian 6 meatballs per lb.) - halved the sauce ingredients - threw everything into my crockpot yesterday morning and last night when I got home from work I boiled 1# whole wheat noodles with a 1# pkg. of fzn peas - tossed the noodles and peas with butter, topped with the meatballs and sauce and OMG - absolutely awesome.  My hubby had 3 servings.  My only possible change next time would be to use all the sauce ingredients even if I only use 2# of meatballs.  There really was enough sauce last night but more might have been even better.  I think the secret ingredient is the Cream of Celery soup - it is so subtle but add the French Onion soup and sour cream - the 3 combined with the juices from the meatballs make the sauce sooooooo rich and wonderful. No salt, pepper or spice needed. I'll definitely make this one often - especially for company.

This was better than I expected. I halved the recipe and cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. I used Costco frozen meatballs, and added a vegetable bouillon cube dissolved in a cup of hot water after about 4 hours of cooking, because the sauce had started to cook down a bit. I added several spoonfuls of sour cream right before serving. The meatballs were so tender! This was great!

This is a good, easy and pretty fast dish to make.  I always cut this in half b/c we are only a family of 4 and this makes enough for us.  I make my own turkey meatballs.  I use 1-1.5 lbs ground turkey, 1 egg, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  I roll them all into medium meatballs and drop them into the mixture.  It all cooks up in 3-4 hours on high in the crock pot.  Very easy meal and yummy.  The kids like it too.

Finally!  My first successful slow cooker recipe!  Easy and low cost ingredients, I couldn't find Italian meatballs so instead I used ground pork, formed into balls, and steamed them before throwing into the pot.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I am always looking for a new recipe to change things up, and when my whole family likes a meal, it must be good.  I made homemade meatballs b/c I don't care for the frozen kind.  I used 2lbs. of ground beef, but kept everything else the same.  You could probably cut the soup and sour cream in half and still have enough sauce.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

These are great, and you gotta love a no chopping required recipe! I halved the recipe, but only used 1 lb. of turkey meatballs. I served them over mashed potatoes instead of noodles. I'd make them again.

This was surprising!  Very good! I used 1 can cream of celery, 1 can French onion, about 16 meatballs and cooked only a half a package of noodles. Didn't use the slow cooker , just stirred the soups together and added the meatballs and simmered on low for about 1 hour. I added about 1/4 cup of sour cream at the end of the cooking time.  Delish!!

These were ok.  They were edible, but not exceptional.  I ended up adding a lot of this and a little of that before I put it in front of my family, so it was very ho-hum to start with.  Probably won't make again.

This was a big hit with our family!  I cut the meatballs down by half, but still used 2 cans French Onion Soup, 1 can Cream of Celery and 1 can Cream of Onion.  I didn't measure the sour cream - just put 3 big spoonfuls.  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy and quick! Made this half a dozen times now; adding in lots of garlic, parsley and black pepper.  I buttered the noddles just a tad to keep them from tasting dry. My husband likes it a lot and our super picky child eats it w/out much whining! I cut the recipe in half and there are leftovers after feeding my hubs and two kids. I serve it with a side of cooked broccoli, peas or green beans.

I cut down the recipe for the two of us.  One pound of meat, two cans of mushroom soup and 1 can of low sodium beef broth.  Mixed the g. meat with a little salt,pepper, and allspice, panko bread crumbs and one egg.  Made up the meat balls and cooked the meatballs  in microwave on reheat.  They were cooked half way.  Added them to the mushroom soup and beef broth in the slow cooker and cooked on high for two or three hours.  Was very good over egg noodles.  The allspice gave it a Swedish meatball flavor.  It was ready when I got home from the grocery store.  Thats all I had to do was cook up the egg noodles.

This is really good! Made this for picky children and neighbors and it was a big hit. I made my own condensed soup base and added a bag of frozen broccoli. Yummy! Reheated well too.

I loved how easy and simple this recipe was. I used one pound frozen meatballs, one can of each soup, and a quarter cup of sour cream. I dumped it all in a slow cooker (even the frozen meatballs) for 5 hours and added sour cream after I turned off the slow cooker. Served over buttered linguini....yum!

I read other reviews and cut it in half and it still made A LOT! I used 1.5 pounds of meatballs and substituted cream of mushroom for cream of celery. I also added fresh cooked mushrooms. It was delicious!!

These were excellent. I used cream of mushroom rather than cream of celery, just a personal preference. A very tasty dinner that I served along with a garden salad. Great for summertime cooking, using crock pot.

I was very hesitant to try this after seeing the ingredients.  I'm so glad I made it.  Followed recipe exactly except omitted butter on the egg noodles.  Our new favorite.  Kids request it all the time now.  Will be making again soon.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Well, I also halved it and subbed cr of mush instead of the cr of celery. I thought it was good. My boys didn't really say anything and didn't go back for seconds either. But i would say its worth making again.

I read the reviews and a lot of people didn't like the saltiness of the french onion soup.  Some people got sick because it's very greasy and high fat.

I modified the recipe:
I cut the sauce ingredients in half. 
I used cream of mushroom instead of celery. 
I used beef broth instead of french onion.  
I added 2 tsp onion flakes. 
reduced fat sour cream. 

Boiled the (gluten-free) noodles and didn't use any butter.  I let the sauce speak for itself.  The grease from the meatballs was enough fat.

Added parmesan cheese on top.

I made a whole recipe as I had company coming but it was 3 times too much! I used 1 lb. sour cream, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of celery soup, and 2 cans of french onion soup. I bought frozen meatballs and used a little more than 4 lbs. of them. Two pounds of buttered noodles was enough. I  thought it had very good flavor. However, I felt it had too much fat in this meal, and I did use reduced fat soup. I think if I had made my own meatballs it would have been better. The store bought ones were good, but they had a lot more fat than if I had made them myself. Also, I would have kept the sauce amount the same and used 2 pounds of meatballs for the amount of sauce and skipped the butter on the noodles, letting the sauce cover them better. I would also use 1 lb. of noodles if using 2 lbs. or less of meatballs. I loved the easy prep. and that I could do this in my slow cooker. Without my suggested changes I probably wouldn't make again, but with them I would.

Very delicious recipe. I prefer to use Swedish meatballs and I do not bother buttering the noodles since the sauce from the meatballs has more than enough flavor. I also use 2 lbs of meatballs, rather than 6. These are always a hit at my house :)

My family really enjoyed this recipe and it was super easy to make.  I'm wondering if the recipe is right though because it says 6 lbs of meatballs.  Well I used less than 3 lbs and my large crock pot was pretty full.  There wouldn't have been enough gravy for 6 lbs. Other than that it was great.

I made it with only one change and that was to use about 5 pounds of meatballs, as the 6 pounds wouldn't fit in the crockpot. It was just okay. Very flavorful and way too salty, even for a big salt user like me. I definitely wouldn't make it for dinner again, but might make it for a party or potluck since it was so easy and made so much.

I did not have as many meatballs as were called for in the recipe, so I cut it in half. The onion was very strong. If I try this recipe again, I would substitute some other form of onion soup.

This recipe is a crowd pleaser.  Use low sodium heart healthy soup instead of celery because otherwise it's too salty for our tastes. Love this dish and so does my family.

My family loved this recipe. I made only one change.  I use all of the soup, except 1 can cream of celery.  Once I started the water to boil for the egg noodles, I added the cream of celery to the crock pot. It helped thicken things up. Yum!

It was ok tasting, and I liked how easy it was to throw together. If I were to make it again though, I wouldn't use the cream of celery soup, I would instead try cream of mushroom soup.

Makes too much with original recipe. I made enough to fill 4 adults.  I did 1 can of cream of celery, 1 can of French onion, 12oz sour cream, and a 1.5 lb bag of frozen Italian meatballs. Cooked on low in crockpot for 3hrs. Tasted amazing! First recipe I have done on here with no additions!

Delicious!  Both my young children and husband gobbled this dish up. The only thing I did differently is use one can cream of mushroom soup in place of the one of the celery soups because that's all I had on hand & not butter the noodles.

Great recipe. Easy to adjust to what you have on hand. This is my second time making it and I only had 2 cans of  cr of mushrm soup so used that, didn't have much sour cream so threw in a single serving container of plain greek yogurt along w/the maybe 2/3 cup of sr cream.  As well, Today I added a half a chopped onion and a can of small whole mushroom as well as a beef bouillion cube and a splash of chicken stock. Good over egg noodles or mashed potatoes.

I made this for my family because it looked really easy....it was super easy and they all LOVED IT!  I didn't have cream of celery, so I used cream of asparagus instead.  I have also used cream of mushroom.  I also added a few seasonings to my liking.  Great, easy weeknight meal to stick in the crock pot! UPDATE: I have made this recipe repeatedly...I always get rave reviews for it!

Amazing is a good word to describe this recipe. I made it yesterday and only changed one thing which was cut recipe in half. (By the way I don't think anyone should rate a recipe if you are going to change ingredients). There was plenty left over which had my family looking for leftovers today. Really really good!!! 5 stars for sure.

I made this tonight and it was awesome! I changed a few things I used one can of French onion soup because of the reviews on the salt. I used one can celery soup.I used  (together) a 28 ounce bag. and 26 ounce bag of frozen meatballs (poor planning when I bought the second bag today). I added ground pepper. I used white cooking wine to cut down on the salty taste.That's what did it. It tasted great.

I halved this recipe and didn't make any other changes. I, personally thought it was kind of gross. I'm not super crazy about frozen bagged meatballs, nor do I like beef stroganoff, and that's what this reminded me of. It was also super greasy and super salty. Won't make this again.

This was good and we really liked it. There is an issue with the sauce though. I used about 2 pounds of meatballs and scaled the ingredients by half.  It gave me enough  of  the sauce but it was super thick. You should add some water to the mix.  Also adding your sour cream in the beginning  will make your sauce separate. Looks awful.  Still tastes good.  You can't really add it at the end or all your meatballs will crumble.  There's the conundrum.  I think this would be a great non slow cooked dish too.  I Used the called for soups and added some paprika, onion powder and a pinch of salt.

This was a really good, really easy recipe.  I am not ambitious enough to make the meatballs from scratch so I kept to the recipe there!  The one change I made, accidentally, is to leave out the butter on the noodles, which turned out to be a good modification.  I completely forgot about the butter and once the the meatballs and sauce were done, I just poured it all right into the cooked noodles and mixed it up.

The sauce was creamy and tasty enough on its own that we didn't miss the butter at all.  I'm sure it would taste even better with the butter but we liked it enough this way that I will continue to leave it out when we make it again, which we will.

I love how easy it was. I used creamed mushroom instead of celery and the kids loved it. I also cut out the butter in the noddles and use a bit of the meatball sauce instead. Great easy recipe. Thanks!

I've made many variations of this recipe (all delicious), but wanted to share my favorite combination of ingredients. When cooking a 2 lb bag of meatballs, I use 1 can of beefy mushroom, 2 cans cream of celery, 1 can of beef broth, and 8 oz. of sour cream (we don't like to run out of gravy). Oh, and we like to mix provolone cheese in with the buttered noodles. :-)

These were great and my family loved them.  Also, very easy!  I halved the recipe because I didn't need 24 servings, but then my kids and hubby said they wanted more of the sauce on their pasta so next time I will keep the # of cans of soup the same, but half everything else.

Great family recipe!  My 7 & 9 year old ask for it all the time. I have never made the full recipe for my family of 4...always just cut everything in half and there are still leftovers.  I can see as my active boys get older that they will eat the full recipe though.  When I haven't had the opportunity to use the slow cooker in time, I have made the exact same recipe on the cooktop in a Dutch oven cooking the meatballs in the sauce for 25-30 minutes. It came out just the same...great!

Wow this is amazing!!  You really couldn't have asked for an easier, more tasty recipe.  This was a huge hit with my family.  I made the recipe exactly to specifications and it was delish except that I mistakenly only bought four pounds of meatballs so it was pretty saucy!  Since we are sauce lovers this was perfect.  Realistically it served six good eaters but would have easily made enough for 10-12 with the other two pounds of meatballs.  I may try it with cream of mushroom soup next time just to see how that may turn out.  Thank you for such a yummy recipe that I will be making time and time again!!

I must admit, I almost didn't try this recipe because it has canned soup in it and I hate cooking with canned soup.  But I tried it for a quick easy meal and guess what.....IT WAS A TOTAL HIT!!!  Great recipe!!!  It makes so much that I can always freeze half and I have a whole dinner ready for another day.  I always double the sauce though so when you eat the leftovers all of the liquid isn't absorbed.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband and I are the only one's who ate this so I only used 3 lbs of meatball ( I actually used turkey).  I like to have more sauce so I would add an extra can of each soup and another 8 oz of sour cream for left overs. Otherwise it is a bit dry the next day or two.  I will make this again becuase of how easy it is and turns out excellet.

Amazing!!!!!  Based on other reviews, I used half the amount of meatballs, but the whole amount of sauce.  That gave us lots of the delish gravy.  Added the sour cream just before serving -- cooking sour cream for 4 hours made me nervous.  Even my in-laws, who are quite picky, loved it and asked for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

This was really good, and very filling. Caution: don't add any extra salt because the soups and meatballs have enough sodium for a salty flavor.

My husband absolutely LOVED this! Wow is it easy and really good. I had made a large can of corn on the side. Hubby just mixed it all together and said I should cook the corn with it. So I think next time about 45 minutes before it is done I will just ad the corn to it (drained of course). Really great quick rib sticking recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I would give this recipe 5 stars for convenience. It was so so easy. I can only give 4 stars for flavor. Although the sauce was tasty, it was a little too salty.

It is very good.  BUT, obviously depends on the quality of the frozen meatballs.  I used Armour and didn't like them at all.  If I ever get around to making my own then freezing them, this would have been really good.  I will double the soup etc to have more gravy.

Amazing!  I halved this recipe, using 8 oz. sour cream, and 1 can each of cream of celery and French onion soup.  My store sold the meatballs in 2 pound packages, so I used 4 pounds and it still turned out wonderful.

My husband LOVED this. I just liked it-I'm not sure I'm a big fan of the frozen meatballs. But that's certainly not the fault of this recipe. It was SUPER easy, which is really helpful since I'm on bed rest for my first pregnancy.

Not a hit for us it actually made us all incredibly sick..The consistency is appalling they become very mushy and grainy..Maybe I did something wrong? but I am sure I followed it. Won't make it again .

Good - made this twice. First time I followed the recipe, but kids complained that all they could taste was celery. The next time, I used cream of chicken instead, to rave reviews. Very easy recipe and good either way, but more subtle flavor with the chicken. Thanks!

This was an excellent recipe.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my family wanted them a little bit saucier.  I whipped some up quickly in a small pot on the stove and it turned out great.  These are very quick and easy.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband and ALL 4 of our kids loved this meal, that is a rare thing.  They even fought over the leftovers the next day.  I skipped the butter on the noddles and no one said a thing.  This dish is super easy and declicious. Thanks to Anna and her friend :)

VERY GOOD.  i was afraid at first that there wasn't enough sauce to cook the meatballs in because they were barely even coated.  But after an hour of 2 or cooking, the sauce thinned out and there was plenty.  I cut the recipe in half and that fed 4 people and we even had leftovers.  I'll definitely make this one again!

This was one of the easiest  recipes I have ever made!  Must admit I was sceptical with just sour cream and 2 cans of soup for the gravy part of the recipe.....but to my delight.....my fam loved it!  Thank you, Queengoddessnance, for a great recipe.

Very good. I used venison burger to make my own meatballs. I made the sauce as directed.

Didn't have cream of celery so i used Cream of Mushroom with Garlic instead. I would imagine regular cream of mushroom would work too. I added probably 1/2 cup milk to thin it out. Would defintely make again.

This was good & easy. I used 1/2pkg of french onion mix w/1 can of water (was worried about the salt since it was noted by other reviewers). Wasn't salty at all. Also, added milk & sour cream the last 1/2hr.

Very good. Very fast and easy to make. My husband and kids liked it and everyone agreed I should make this again. I did use Cream of Mushroom instead of COC because that's what I had.

I have to say that using this recipe as a base with some changes, my family loved it!  I used a two pound bag of frozen meatballs, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup (my husband hates celery), one envelope of dry onion soup mix, one can full of milk, two of beef broth and a package of sliced mushrooms.  It tasted really good, but had too much grease, so I skimmed as much off the top as I could.  Then added cooked noodles to the mixture after it was done.  I think next time I will cook the meatballs in the oven to drain the grease and then mix together.  Overall though, very good.

My family loved this dish!  Besides being delicious, it had all the ease of a crockpot recipe without having to remember to start it early in the morning. I'm not so sure about the serving calculations, though - I halved the recipe (12 servings) and we had very little left over with 4 of us eating. We will definitely be making this again and again!

This was a really nice recipe.  I took another reviewer's advice and just prepared this on the stovetop since I didn't have all day to prepare it.  I halved the recipe and skipped buttering the noodles.  I think I might make more sauce next time, but otherwise this was a really good weeknight meal!

I made this recipe today and thought it was very good. I followed the recipe. However I only used 2 lbs. of meatballs. Also I wasn't paying attention and threw the butter in the mixture instead of on the noodles (made the sauce rich tasting). I will add this recipe to my favorites. Tasty and EASY!!

I can't give this less than five stars!  I made my own meatballs using half beef, half sausage.  The gravy is very good.  I scaled the recipe back to two pounds of meatballs.  My boyfriend said it was screaming for some mushrooms, so next time (and there WILL be a next time), I'll use mushroom soup and add mushrooms.  Thanks to Anna and the submitter for the great recipe!

This was very easy but just "OK" taste wise.  We kinda struggled through the leftovers.  I think I prefer the golden mushroom, french onion and sour cream combination more.

This recipe was very easy to prepare.  I think that the butter on the noodles made it too oily, so I would recommend omitting the butter.  The taste was good though.

This was easy with a simple home-cooked taste.  I used the calculator to reduce the servings to 12, but then still adjusted it and everything came out perfect.  My portion served about 3-4 with veggies on the side: 1 can condensed cream of mushroom, 8 oz chicken broth, 2 lbs frozen meatballs.  I added the sour cream the last 30 minutes (and only used about 4-5 oz since that's all that I had left in the fridge.  2 c pasta and walah!

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. The only thing was there was no way this sauce would have covered six pounds of meatballs. I made two and a half pounds and a little more than half the sauce and it was JUST enough sauce. My husband liked it with cheese on top and my two year old loved the whole thing!

These were just O.K. for me.  I added some black pepper to this and put the sour cream in right before I served it.  If I try this recipe again I will only use 1/2 of the container of sour cream.  It was a little to sour creamy for me.

This sure was easy to make.  I had never bought frozen meatballs from the store before, and I thought it would make this meal easier.  The flavor of the sauce was awesome, but my family hated the meatballs(they were the name brand too).  I will make this again, using my own meatballs.

this recipe was really easy for only 2 people. I used cream of mushroom soup because i had that on hand with the celery soup and it turned out just as good. I had italian style meatballs and to add a bit more flavor to the soups i added seasonings but still turned out pretty good.

Very tasty.  I halved the recipe and put in only 1 lb of meatballs so we would be sure to have lots of gravy and we did.  I brought it to a boil then simmered it on the stove for 2 hours instead of putting it in a crock pot and served it over rice instead of noodles.  A delicious and easy meal I will make again.

This is a definite keeper.  I fixed it exactly as the recipe reads, and my family loved it.  This recipe was quick, easy, and comfort food pleasing.

Easy, easy, easy - the kids love it and I liked it too.  I'm usually not too fond of recipes with a soup base but based on reviews decided to try this - it's a keeper.

I give this a five because it was super easy, quick and my family loved it.  I did as others did and tweaked it alittle based on what I had at home.  I used cream of mushroom soup, beef broth and sour cream and it did in fact taste alot like my stroganoff.  Everyone liked it and it was very quick - that is great!

Super Easy! Used spirals as I didn't have egg noodles. The family liked it, even my picky hubby. I will make this again.

Changed it a little!  Cut it in half (kinda) Used 2 cans cream of mushroom instead of celery and used 1 can french onion.  Added just a splash of water and waited till 30 min. before serving to add sour cream.  Mixed in some pepper too!!!!  This was AWESOME, will definetly make again and again!!
