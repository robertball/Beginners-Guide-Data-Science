1.7.17  Made exactly as written, tasted, and then tweaked to suit our tastes.  The texture was way too thick, so I did add a little chicken broth to reach a smoother consistency.  I felt the flavor was weak (this could be personal taste preference), so I added a bit more lemon juice, and a drizzle of chili and sesame oils.  After those minor modifications, it was good to go!

I made my own tahini and closer to a 1/2 cup of Parmesan.  This is absolutely the BEST hummus I have made to date! Highly recommended!

The roasted garlic really gave it a nice mellow flavor. I did add a little extra juice from the garbanzo beans to make it creamier.

As creamy as store bought. Instead of the oven for roasting I used a frying pan.  High heat until skin is blacken, about 10 minutes
