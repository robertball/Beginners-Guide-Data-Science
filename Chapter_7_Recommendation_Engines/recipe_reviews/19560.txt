This is a delicious traditional pound cake recipe which  makes 2 cakes when baked in loaf pans (recipe doesn't really specifiy what kind of pan - one assumes a loaf pan since it is a "loaf" cake" - yes?). Wonderful cake (even with butter substituted for the Crisco), but keep in mind, it is a recipe for TWO CAKES when done in loaf pans (loaves) which is not mentioned in the recipe. Half recipe for one loaf - which is what I do.

Very moist, dense, slightly eggy cake. I added a bit of lemon zest to add just a teensy bit of tang, but it would have been just as nice without. Excellently crusty crust. Would be very nice with tea.

I halved this recipe and following the advice of another reviewer, baked it in a loaf pan, rather than a bundt pan.  If you do the same, be sure to use an 8x4 loaf pan, rather than a 9x5, because you’ll get very little rise.  I’ve never baked a cake or sweet bread that didn’t have either baking powder or baking soda in it, and I thought it unusual that this recipe had neither, but I don’t do a whole of baking either.  This was OK, a little on the dry side, but I'll use it for strawberry shortcake, so that won't be an issue.

I made this as written, no changes, and I found it really bland.  Needs salt perhaps.
