I too left out the curry paste, like the other reviewer. My kids said it was fine, not great. A little dry, needs more sauce of some sort. However, it was a nice dinner and we felt satisfied.

Delicious. I used Lima beans and carrots. I didnâ€™t have peas. I left out the curry paste not a fan of curry flavor.
