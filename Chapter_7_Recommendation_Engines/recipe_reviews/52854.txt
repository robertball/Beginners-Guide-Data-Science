juice tomatoes and let them sit over night in the fridge so the juice and water seperate, then baste the water out of the juice, this makes the vegetable juice more thicker

This recipe is much better than V8! And much less sodium than V8!  I used 2 teaspoons of canning salt and 3/4 cup of white sugar.  I also added a splash of Tabasco to give it a slight kick.  A great recipe that's good for you too!

Excellent results!  We omitted all sugar and reduced salt to less than 1/8 cup.  We also increased the horseradish and Worcestershire to give more zip.  Result is not spicy, just good flavor.  To make the juice thicker (more like V8), we added 3 quarts stewed tomatos (blended to liquid and then strained to remove seeds).  Very good.  Everyone agrees it is better than V8.

We've made this recipe twice. Each time we've reduced the sugar called for, and actually think we may try leaving it out altogether next time as we found it to be overly sweet both times. But we've been pleased overall with the recipe and will be tyring it again.

I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and added a little more carrot than it called for. I also added some other fresh veggies from the garden like chives and chard. I drank it raw. I added braggs amino liquid (like soy sauce) and lime, omitting the sugar. amazing!

I made this reduced to one serving.  I didn't have beets, but had all of the other ingredients.  The flavor was amazing.  I will cut down on the onion next time, because it packed a powerful punch! I would also like to add beets next time I make it.

I really like this juice! I bought a juicer so that I could make my own vegetable juice without all the salt of V8. I scaled this recipe down and made enough for a couple days. I'd like to can it, but I am unsure of how to. I don't own a pressure canner. Anyways, I added a little extra worcestshire and horseraddish because it was a little bland for my taste. Good overall though!!

While it is healthier than store bought since the salt is controlled, it took an awfully long time to render mediocre flavor. Plus the ingredients cost more than to buy it pre-made. My suggestion to anyone trying this recipe is to arm yourself with lots of spices.

I downsized this recipe considerably, so maybe that's one reason why it seemed to not be perfect, although it's good. Also, I don't know if some of my veggies were the same size as the recipe asks for. After all, there are different sizes of green peppers, carrots, etc! I'll probably try it again soon, that's how much I liked it.

This was pretty good! A lot less salty than V8...but it can be suited to the drinker's taste.  I downsized the recipe considerably and of course, I don't have a juicer for all these yummy veggies...so I used a blender and strained it. :)  Thanks for the recipe, my dad sure appreciates it! :D

I have used this recipe before and loved it.  It has also done double duty as a soup base for me.  I don't juice anything, just run it through the blender to give it a course chop and then cook and bottle the results.  It makes a great hurry up meal for soup such as vegetable macaroni, vegetable soup, vegetable beef soup or stew.  Just add meat or noodles, and you have an easy meal.

This recipe is really awsome. I grow everything even the beets and garlic. One thing I did different was add the beet juice that I had used for the beets I cooked for dinner and and used less water. I also added less sugar . I also added some cumin and fresh parsley. I used  my food processor, the bullet and my sieve, to get the right constistensy. I also 1/2 the recipe and used more carrots. I made 5 quarts of this recipe and posted a picture too. Its a great recipe.  Will make more in a couple of days. Thanks for posting this.

A great recipe. Better than V8. I was afraid to add the 6 quarts of water so I did short it on water but after canning the juice was pretty thick. I will just water it down as I open the jars.  I plan to use it making bloody marys'

This was very good and fairly easy to make.  I did omit the horseradish because I do not care for it, but both my husband and I loved it.  thanks

I added hot sauce instead of the horseradish, only added the 1/4 cup of sugar. This is so good and will make it again.

For some reason I did not expect this recipe to make so much juice, I did not add all the water, only enough to soften the onions and celery before juicing them.  I did add more freshly ground horseradish then called for and more worstershire sauce, after tasting, and lowered the salt and omitted the cup of sugar.  I ended up with 14 quarts of nice thick juice, it will be a pleasant alternative to plain tomato juice.  I would appreciate better measurements rather then a vague "large" onion, or " medium" beet.   The recipe starts with a weight of tomatoes, then cup indications for the celery, but after that it is very indivual, not that most cooks can't guess but with canning it is better to be accurate.

I made a 5 gallon batch for canning, most of the vegetables home grown (only the garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and dry seasoning were store bought). I added about 40 small jalapeños because we like it spicy. I ran the tomatoes through a victorio strainer to keep much of the pulp. I boiled the remaining vegetables with the seasonings in 2 gallons of water, puréed it and pressed it using cheese cloth (like making wine or cheese) cuz I don't have a juicer, retaining all the liquid. That liquid was added to the thick tomato juice and voilà! it was so much better than V8!

Great recipe. I used the juice squeezed/drained from tomatoes for salsa-making, so I eliminated the added water. Otherwise followed as written.
