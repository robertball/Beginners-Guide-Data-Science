I've used this recipe for years for our family Sunday morning breakfasts. The trick to the hashbrowns is to thaw and drain well, then squeeze in a paper towel to remove all the moisture. Add what seasonings you want, press into the pie plate, and bake for about 25 min. or until they start to brown. Then add whatever other toppings you want. I use deep dish pie plates, so I use 5 or 6 eggs. We love ham, green onions, mushrooms and pepper jack cheese. Try this, you will like what you can do with it.

I loved this recipe and got great reviews from the family.  I did however add a few things.  First I fried the hashbrowns in butter for about 10-15 mins then mixed in some onion and garlic powder along with some pepper then pressed them into the dish.   I used 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk. Added 1/4 cup of diced green peppers.  I also used 1/4 pound of bacon cut into 1" pieces, remember to fry bacon first! Turned out fantastic!

Good but I will make a few adjustments next time.  Don't think you need 1/3 C. butter so will cut back a bit on that.  Also, will add 2 or 3 more eggs as I like my breakfast casseroles more eggy. Cooking time was a little longer than recipe called for; maybe an additional 15 minutes or so.

EASY!  I made this with homemade hash browns.  I grated 2 big potatoes then rinsed them of their starch and squeezed all the excess water out.  I made my recipe in a glass 8x8 pan.  I used 4 eggs rather than 2 and baked both the crust layer and the egg layer about 5 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.  This turned out excellent!  This one is going in my recipe box!

This was very good using a few revisions suggested by previous reviewers.  I used: 3 cups of thawed hashbrowns and browned them slightly before pressing into pieplate; melted about 2 T. margarine and greased pie plate with a little and then drizzled rest on top of potatoes; took about 20 min.for potatoes to brown in oven and then added the ham/cheese/green onion; used 4 eggs and 1/2 cup milk; baked about 20-25 min and sprinkle little more cheese on top last 5 min.  Remember to let quiche sit about 5 min. before slicing.  Husband and I both liked this and will make it again.  Thanks.

I tried a couple of quiche recipes on here and this is my fav.  I like the hash brown crust but have not gotten it to come out just right or it takes a while to cook.  This last time I just cooked tater tots, then mashed them in and around the edges of the pie plate for the crust and it worked great!! It was a thicker and tastier crust.

This is a great idea for when you don't want to or have time to make a traditional quiche crust and also if you like hash browns with eggs! We had ours with spinach (I used a half of a 10 oz. package of frozen spinach, thawed) and sauted mushrooms, instead of ham--a great main dish for Lent! I also followed the suggestion of 2 additional eggs, and baked for a slightly longer time.

We really likes this but 2 eggs is not enough!!! I increased it to 3 eggs and next time I will use at least 4. I made this replacing the ham with some turkey sausage, adding roasted red pepper, smoked paprika and replaced half of the milk with sour cream. I didn't use the butter at all, just sprayed the hashbrowns with some pam to help them brown. Also used Emily's famous hash browns (from this site). This is an awesome recipe idea, but it need's WAY more than 2 eggs!

Fabulous idea. My husband and I enjoyed this! We thought of ideas to change this to suit our mood...adding peppers, mushroooms and sausage and salsa...for the spanish flare, bacon for the Sunday personel touch. This recipe was wonderful and we look forward to enjoying it again. Quick and easy to make and eat!

I loved this recipe.  I made it for my dad who can't eat anything with flour in it, so a regular quiche is out.  I used about 9 eggs, increased the milk to 1 cup, and put it in a 9x13 dish.  I also played with the seasonings a bit.
I'll make it again!

I liked this, but it's not quite worth 5 stars in my opinion.  I thawed out my hash browns, dabbed out some moisture with paper towels, and baked for about 25 minutes in the oven.  Meanwhile, I mixed together 1.5 cups of cooked crumbled sausage, sauteed onions & peppers, one small can of diced jalapenos, and a cup of mexican blend cheese.  I put it in the "crust" and ended up using 5 eggs with an unmeasured amount of milk.  I seasoned it with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and some cayenne, but in the end I felt that it was just a bit. Also, with 5 eggs it took about 40 minutes in the oven instead of 25.  I will probably try this one again, but spice it even more next time.

This my go-to weekend brunch casserole. I use a whole bag of a 2# bag of hash browns and put it in a 8x10 glass pan. I put drizzle the 1/3 c. melted butter and mix in 2 tbsp. dried onion. Bake for 20 min.  Mix 6 eggs w/1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 cream and salt/pepper. Pour over the hash browns and top with cheese. I vary the cheeses from cheddar/MonterreyJack/Parmesan blend, etc.  It if a nice basic recipe and you can put in colored peppers or fresh chives.   Bake 350 for 25-30 minutes. This freezes well also. I put in individual servings and take them out for quick breakfast.  Great recipe.

I have used this recipe many times, but with a few alterations and additions. I grate my own potatoes for the crust, instead of using store bought and I add 2 or 3 more eggs to make it fluffier. I also add vegetables such as broccoli, and green or red peppers. It's an awesome breakfast or dinner that goes great with garlic toast. Delicious!

I doubled the recipe using 8 eggs, 1 1/2 cups milk, and baked in a 9x13 pan I also needed to bake the hashbrowns and finished casserole longer. We loved it.

Delicious!  My family loves this.  I made this following the recipe exactly except I use hash browns that you find in the refrigerated section and are already shredded and it turned out great!  We make this often because it is so good!

This was good.  We would like the "crust" to be more crisp.  Next time I will cook the hash browns longer before adding the toppings.

Made as written, except to use bacon and sausage instead of the ham.  Loved it.  Interesting idea using the hashbrowns as a crust. You could use many different topping combinations that would be great!

Very good and a big hit with the kids.  I combined the melted butter with the hash browns before pressing the hash browns into the dish.  I think this made that step easier.

I sprayed the bottom of my glass pie dish with olive oil cooking spray and used southwest style hash browns for the crust, and instead of the melted butter, I sprayed the potatoes with butter flavored cooking spray. I used spicy hot pork sausage and sauteed the onions first with both red and green bell pappers. I used taco cheese and 5 eggs but did not increase the amount of milk.  I baked it for 25 minutes after adding the filling and it was perfect.  It looked pretty too!

It was ok. I think I didn't let my hasbrowns get browned enough so they were mushy and I didn't really care for that. I think if I try it again I will use thawed hashbrowns and see if that works better. The only change I made was that I used ground turkey sausage instead of ham. I'm not a big ham eater so I didn't want to have to buy it.

I made this recipe with a few modifications in order to make it in a large 9 x 13 pan (fed 6 very hungry people!) Used 4 cups hashbrowns, 1 can flaked ham, used green onion, added 1/4 cup diced red pepper, used 1 cup milk and increased eggs to 6. Will add more cheese next time too. Everyone loved it. Thanks Karen!

I did a few changes and it was very good.  I used the boxed hashbrowns from Sam's Club, reconstituted them and then used just about 1/4 cup of melted butter.  I also used 6 eggs and green onions in place of the regular onion.  I went a little heavy with the seasoned salt so next time I'll have to watch that more carefully.  Finally, I had to bake it an extra 12-15 minutes with the 6 eggs in order for it to be set.  The hashbrowns were crispy, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I liked it very much.

I just toss 2 of these in the oven I am writing this now because I am sure with all the standard yummy ingredients. I am sure it will taste great. I used 5 eggs, one with asparagus, green onions white cheddar cheese & smoked ham, s&p, garlic salt the other one was the same but with no asparagus and added mushrooms. Drizzled 2 tbl. Melted butter on the fresh rinsed dried potatoes and prebaked it for 25 to 30 min. still could have been longer. I am guessing though the egg mixture is supposed to leek in to the bottom of the dish I could find no way to prevent this and I tried really hard.

This was really good!  I didn't have ham so I used crumbled bacon and scaled it down to about 2/3 cup.  I omitted the salt in the eggs because it already had seasoned salt plus the salt in the bacon.  It came out really well.  I think the only thing I might do in the future is to scale the butter down to about 1/4 cup because it was a little greasy (I used a paper towel to sop some up) and I would also add at least one more egg, maybe 2.  This is a recipe you can really play around with!

"As is," this recipe was *okay.*  1/4 cup of onion, with nothing done to them, was way too much - gave the breakfast an "extreme onion" taste, and we don't like crunchy onions in our breakfast!  If I do this again, I'll either opt out on the onions, or saute them first, so they're not so crunchy or overpowering.  More egg, too.

Everyone loved it! Used 5 eggs and glad I did. Used hashbrowns on the bottom and then sprinkled garlic/garlic seasoning (tastefully simple) over it and a little pepper. Only drizzled a small amount of butter over it. Used thick prepackaged deli ham slices and cut them into small pieces. Probably added 1 1/2 cups. I diced up 1/2 cup of onion and sautee'd it because I didn't want it crunchy and it was delicious. I also added extra cheese. It tasted delicious and couldnt have been easier. Will make this again for sure!!!

Followed the recipe exactly using the 4th top reviewers suggestions with fresh potatoes. Added 1/4 tsp salt to the eggs. Made 2 quiches for our family but need to make 3 as our family of 7 completely finished off the two quiches in a sitting. Thanks!

Had to use a dozen eggs and double the remaining ingredients. Baked in a large casserole pan and added dry mustard.  Had to use onion powder to sneak it past the kids. Pretty tasty, but I'll definitely use WAY more seasonings next time along with o'brien hashbrowns. Otherwise, it would be way too bland.

This is very good recipie,but I made a few changes. To make it easy first I put 7 pre formed hashbrown patties in the bottom of a 13''x 9'' pan pour the melted butter on top of the patties season then bake at 425 for 20 miniutes. Then pre cook 8 bacon slices ,(not crispy) put 4 eggs and a cup of milk, mix well ,after the hashbrowns are out of the oven lay the bacon strips on the hash browns,then layer with sliced onion,then put shredded cheese then pour the egg mixture on top and bakefor 25 mins at 350.Its sooooo good you'll love it!

Perhaps I didn't cook the crust (hasbrowns) long enough but this never got to the texture we prefer...even after cooking longer. I did use 4 eggs instead of 2 and added 1/2c chopped red peppers for some color. I think it has potential and I might try this again b/c I really think its a neat idea.

This was really easy and very tasty.  I followed the advice of others and used 4 eggs.  I only used a 1/4 cup of butter too. I used packaged hash browns that were not frozen.  I found it took twice the time to get crispy and it needed more than 25 minutes to be fully puffed.  You just have to watch it.  Very good taste and makes good left overs.

This was great!  I always season hashbrowns or potatos a lot or it just gets too bland. I also blotted the hashbrowns to get excess water out of them which worked great. I put dried minced onions on top of them just hoping they'd suck up excess water, pretty sure that helped.  My boyfriend loves onions so I put probably a half cup of chopped onions in with the ham and cheese which added more flavor. I didn't measure my ham but i wish i would have put more in.. The bites that didn't have the ham weren't as good.  I am definitely making this again and i'll try some other breakfast meats also

The taste on this is great. I baked and baked the hashbrowns but they never really browned.  I think next time I would use some of the other reviewers advice and brown them a little before baking.

Really enjoyed this dish.  I did not thaw the hash browns as others suggested, but it took longer to cook them than stated, about 35 minutes, then I added the remaining ingredients.  I also used four eggs; two just didn't seem like enough.  This would be good with mushrooms, peppers, etc., very forgiving.  So good, thanks!

I made this as written (except used tsp of dried minced onions in the egg mixture rather than fresh).  I cooked the hashbrowns for the 20 minutes, and although they were pale and soft after the 20, they were perfect after the remaining cook time (think I forgot to lower oven temp, though, now that I think about it).  So I did not need to cook the hashbrowns longer as suggested in other reviews.  Used the 2 eggs and the ham and this was wonderful as a breakfast casserole, especially for my wheat sensitive daughter.  Wonderful taste and very easy.

Good Stuff.  First time making so followed recipe exactly and it came out kinda creamy and delicious. Added a diced clove of garlic.  I may have oversalted a bit, but thats my bad.  Used half a package of the pre-diced ham which made things a little easier.  Put a few drops of Franks's Hot Suace on my serving for a little kick.  Will def make again but go easier on the salt.  Thanks for a good recipe!

The hash brown crust did not turn out how I had hoped. I looked at alot of reviews becuase I had the caution to begin with the hash brown crust  but it still did not work for me. The other two boys in my life thought it was ok so I will try to play with the recipe more.

I thought this was really good!  I like the hash brown crust better than pastry crust.  I made 2 of them for easter brunch, one with bacon instead of ham and one with cubed ham and fresh asparagus.  Surprisingly, ham and asparagus was the favorite with my family of bacon lovers.  I read some of the reviews and made the following changes:  I used a 1/4 cup of butter instead of a 1/3 cup on the hash brown crust and used 5 eggs instead of 2.  I didn't use enough salt this time but I will absolutely make this again.  Great recipe!

Couldn't be easier!  Perfect use of leftover ham.  Definitely followed other reviews and went with 4 eggs.  (Reheats perfectly!)This is now not only a way to use left-over ham, but is a staple in our home!

This was soooo good! I did use tater tot crowns to line my pie plate and cooked those as directed on the package. They were great and I loved the flavor. I also added 2 more eggs for a total of 4 it was the perfect amount for my pie plate but I did have to cook it an aditional 15 minutes. Depending on how salty your ham is you migh not want to add any salt to the eggs. I also added soe green onions for color.

I think that I didn't let the hash browns cook long enough- the eggs were absorbed into the potatoes and they were soggy.  Boo-hiss- but it was a user error.  I will try it again.

Added 2 or 3 more eggs and about 1/4tsp garlic powder. This was great, but next time I will decrease the onion or at least cook them before hand so they aren't so raw.

My mom gave me this recipe, and I loved it, but I used egg beaters, turkey bacon, and 2% Mexican cheese blend instead to make it lighter. I added some salsa to the eggs when I added them. I used I can't Believe it's not Butter instead of regular butter to help out. It came out delicious. I didn't tell my mom what I did and she thought it was awesome!

Liked the hash brown idea instead of the usual pie crust. I added spinach to this, an extra cup of cheese and ended up needing six eggs. Spiced it up a bit with cayenne pepper, and garlic and onion powders. Good recipe Karen and thanks!

Use thawed hash browns- I didn't, and the crust took about 40 minutes to cook.  Also, I think  frozen hash browns must measure differently than thawed ones.  The filling didn't fill the pan - perhaps it would have if I had used thawed hash browns?  Despite this, the quiche tasted very good.

I used leftover chicken sausage instead of ham. I also added some left over cooked chopped broccoli. Up the eggs to 4.  Next time would use 5 eggs.  Husband thought it was great.  This is a great way to use leftovers.

I'm not a fan of hash browns but I really liked the hash brown crust.  I added the additonal eggs and was glad I did.  Next time I'll put in finer chopped onions.  Overall my  boyfriend and I  enjoyed this very much.

I used this to help me with the basics. I used Trader Joes Frozen hashbrowns and baked longer. I also upped the size and did 2 larger quiches. Mmmm

Good, basic recipe, easy to modify to your family's liking. I added an extra egg and some diced bell pepper with the onion and ham. On the hashbrown crust I put the ham, onion and peppers, then I put the cheese on it and then poured the egg mixture of the top..  Like a quiche.  (Rather than mixing the cheese with the ham, onion, pepper).

Modifications: Mix hash browns with 1/4 cup flour, one egg, seasoned salt, pepper, salt and butter (1/4 cup melted) and bake for 25 min in 450 degree oven. Potatoes will brown the rest while cooking with the put together quiche. Use 4 eggs.Follow original recipe with other ingredients but bake at 425 for 20-25 minutes until top is golden and bubbly. Enjoy!

I added 2 extra eggs and substituted corned beef for ham since that is all I had in my fridge for meat at the time. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of regular milk (to be extra healthy lol). I baked the hash browns for an extra 5 minutes to get them a little more crispy. Lastly, I added a thin layer of baby spinach leaves in between the meat/cheese mixture and the egg mixture. The flavor was fantastic and even my (picky) husband loved it!

This was delicious.  My family and I don't really like quiche, but the hashbrowns made this really good.  I served the leftovers to a friend the next day and she raved about it as well.

A nice base! My bottom hash were a bit  mushy even when I baked them 5 minutes longer. I would have liked it crispier and golden brown. Since I had my pancake skillet out already, I gently removed the quiche (cooled enough to handle) and transferred it to the skillet to brown the bottoms. But next time use less butter or bake it way longer. For the toppings, we used bacon, half gruyere half cheddar cheese, and green onions....yum!

I thought the name on this was really misleading! It tastes like hashbrowns with some ham and cheese on top. I thought 2 eggs didn't seem like very much. I was afraid of it cooking over in my pie pan so I just put in a round cake pan with taller sides and sprayed it well with non-stick cooking spray. For some reason it took twice as long for the hashbrowns to brown and for the final dish to be done doubling the total cooking time. I did use all low-fat dairy products, but I do that all the time. Overall, It is not bad, other than a tad dry, just something more for breakfast. I had made it for dinner expecting some kind of a quiche.

I found this recipe to be bland. Granted, I omitted the onions b/c one of my guests couldn't tolerate them, but I otherwise followed it pretty closely. I did extend the cooking time of the hash browns in hopes of getting a crispy crust with all that butter. The edges did crisp but that's it (so the butter could probably be reduced without effect). I recommend following others' guidance and frying the hash browns first before pressing into pan to add some texture, and make sure you season well with salt and pepper during cooking. The quiche doesn't puff much during cooking, so I'd say this feeds 3-4 unless it's one component of several at a meal. If I make this again, I'll definitely add more seasoning to both the hash browns and the egg mixture.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I'm a vegetarian so I omitted the ham, but I added lots of different veggies, which my meat-eating husband didn't mind.  I thawed frozen hash browns and used paper towels to press out the moisture.  I then tossed them with seasoning salt before pressing into the pie plate.  I'll try using extra hash browns next time to create a thicker crust.  I used a pastry brush to dab the melted butter on for even coating, but I did use less than what the recipe called for.

When my family lets me know when something is awesome, I listen.  I made a few adjustments--1/4 c. buter, used Moby/Jack Cheese, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of Crema Mexicana Grade A Table Cream (this beats 1/2 and 1/2).  Also, Idid not add salt because of the ham.

Delicious! I wish I would have thawed potatoes first. It took a long time to brown just the edges. I used chopped spinach and broccoli. Again, wish I would have thawed and drained them. Used three eggs. Baked for 30-35 mins.

Great recipe.  I have made it several times, with the first following the recipe directly.  After following the recipe directly, I decided to use less butter...maybe 4 T.  It came out much better.  I also use about 1/4 C more ham and I cook the onions before adding them.  Also, I find I have to cook the hash browns about 10 min. longer than what the recipe calls for.  You can't go wrong with this!

LOVE THIS MEAL!!!  I omitted the ham and added mushrooms and diced tomatoes.  I sauted all my veggies in a skillet with a smidge of butter and then baked it.  SUPER GREAT!!!  I did up the eggs...I think I used 6 or so.  Also, I instead of hashbrowns I used tater tots which I crumbled and browned in a skillet before putting them in the oven.  It was a little time consuming but that may be that it was my first go'round at this.  I guarentee I will be making this again and I bet it won't take me as long once I'm 100% sure of what I'm doing!

I made this in a deep dish pie plate & ended up using 8 eggs(is 2 REALLY all you need for a reg pie plate??!!). Very good, altho the hashbrowns were still mushy & a little greasy from the butter(yes, I did the pre-bake, even added on an extra 5 min).

This was YUMMY and got rave reviews!! Next time I will brown the hashbrowns in butter BEFORE putting them in the pie pan. The hashbrown "crust" was good, but without browning the hashbrowns it was a bit mushy. But I made everything else exactly as the recipe states, and it was GREAT! I will definitely make this again.

This didn't really work out that great for me. I had very high hopes for this and was a little disappointed. I added green pepper. It took a lot longer to cook than stated, and the top was getting burnt and the eggs underneath still weren't cooked. I sprayed my pie dish with pam but the potatoes still stuck to it. Won't make this breakfast dish again.

This was really good. I didn't have any shredded hash browns, so I grated some fresh potato instead. I also added two extra egg whites and some fresh garlic to the egg mixture.  Hubby already requested I made it again next weekend.

Outstanding!  Very important to press/drain the hash browns for a crisper crust.  I used half bacon and half ham.  My super duper picky teenage son went back for thirds which truly says something!  Thank you very much for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Delicious! Make sure to get a nice, crisp brown on the hash browns before moving on to the next step...adds a great texture.  Next time, I will add some veggies in.

I used the bagged, not frozen hashbrowns, Simply Potatoes and it came out beyond perfect.  I did add mushrooms.  It is awsome. Didn't have to change times like with frozen potatoes.

Delicious! We have made this several times. Tonight we topped ours with mushrooms and peppers. Left out the ham and had bacon on the side. I tripled the recipe since I was serving 8 people. This was my mom's bday dinner since she loves breakfast.

Our family loved this recipe although we altered it as many others have done. That's what makes this recipes so great is that you can adapt it to whatever ingredients you want to add including adding extra eggs or topping with salsa and sour cream and it turns out great!!! Just add to the cooking time for the extra ingredients...this is a keeper!!!

The family and I like this enough and I will definitely make it again, but with a few changes next time. First, I browned the hash brown in butter before putting them in the dish. Next time I would cook them until they're cruchy - the filling makes the hash brown crust soggy! Also, I would sautee the onions before adding them to the filling - they were still had a little crucnch to them. It took more than 2 eggs (6 to be exact) to fill the crust. I used breakfast sausage and a cheddar/jack combo. Be sure to slightly undercook the quiche - eggs continue to cook and if it's cooked too long, it'll be dry. Overall, good recipe. Just needs a little tweaking.

Very simple and versatile. I doubled the egg and the other toppings as I like a deeper quiche. You can substitute any of the meat and cheese ingredients to create your own flavor. Very good!

Yummy! I just served this to a bunch of eight year-old children. Who devoured it. I thawed frozen hash browns and pushed them into a cupcake pan lined with foil liners. I omitted the butter, but sprayed the liners with nonstick and then sprayed the hash browns with the spray after they were formed into little bowls in the pan. I have made this recipe in a 9 x 13 inch dish also. So good and easy!

I loved the idea of this recipe. It didn't come out exactly how I thought it would. I used 4 eggs as other reviewers suggested, but when it cooked, the eggs seeped down between the potatoes and didn't stay on top. The result was okay, but not great. I cooked the hash browns the specified time, maybe longer would have helped?

This was a hit at our table tonight! Other than using 5 eggs instead of two, I pretty much followed the recipe.  I really liked the hashbrown crust.  I never thought pie crust went with eggs anyway.  This one's going in my recipe box.

Was very good like that it can be made ahead. Also used other reviewers tip of "the trick to the hashbrowns is to thaw and drain well, then squeeze in a paper towel to remove all the moisture. Add what seasonings you want, press into the pie plate, and bake for about 25 min. or until they start to brown. Then add whatever other toppings you want." I use deep dish pie plate and use 5 to 6 eggs which increases bake time to 30 min.

Wow!  Really good quiche.  This was my first quiche that I have made.  I have been eating it for my breakfasts this week. So my son has been having some too.  And he likes it as well.  It is like a meal in itself with the eggs, hash browns and ham.  The only thing that I did a little differently to the recipe was that I just bought a ham steak, since I didn't know if you could actually buy diced ham.  (I couldn't find it anyway)  So it was probably a little more ham than what the recipe called for.  But who doesn't like more ham?  Great recipe, thanks!

This was great!  I don't really like eggs, so I only added one additional egg per quiche. I made one with sausage, peppers and onions with Mexican blend cheese, and the other with spinach, mushroom and mozzerella.  I made them the night before and brought them into work the next morning. Everyone LOVED them! Will definately make again!

Yum! Very easy and very good. I changed it a little just to use up things I had on hand. I used 4 eggs, and 3/4 c milk, also I just chopped up some ham lunch meat and stired in some onion flakes. Will make again!

I make this all the time! It is a great make ahead recipe-it reheats well. I add about 1/4 cup of diced red bell pepper and substitute green onions for the regular onions. I also use 5 eggs like other reviewers. This dish is always a hit!

This recipe is very tasty, very easy, and plus, the ingredients are standardly on hand in my house.  I made it as per recipe, except that I cooked the crust longer and also I cooked the egg-quiche just a bit longer.  Turned out great, and both my husband & I enjoyed it.  Hubby suggested making it with cooked bacon next time.  Thanks, Karen, for this recipe...

I made this tonight and it was very good.  I did cook the has browns first in a fry pan and brown them then put in the pie plate and cooked in the over for the 20 minutes.  Used sausage instead of the ham and used 4 eggs. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes and it was perfect.  I baked in a glass Pyrex pie plate I sprayed with Pam and the eggs did not stick at all.  Very good dish

I will definitely make this again.  I admit that I messed with this a lot.  I made it with 8 eggs, 3/4 c milk, sauteed peppers and onion, bacon and sausage (didn't have ham or I would have used it).  I needed more like 30 minutes to brown the browns. Over all this is a great base recipe with tons of variations available.

Absolutely delicious!!! I grated my own (3 Idaho) potatoes and fried them in a little oil in a large pan the stove, but I'm sure store bought hash browns would have been just fine. I used dairy free cheddar cheese, and used 4 chopped scallions instead of the onion.  I also used 4 eggs instead of 2, and all fit in just right.

My family and I loved this dish, it was a HIT!!! Like many other people, I too used 4 eggs instead of two. I am glad that I read the comments before making it. They were right....go with at least 4 eggs!!! I didn't frozen hash browns. I shredded my own potatoes, which was great. The cooking time was longer than what the recipe states. BON A PETITE!!!

Love this recipe as it's really easy. Made it in a muffin tin so I can get mini quiche. I just eyeballed the quiche when it's in the oven since I was making smaller portions. Great as a picnic treat. My family enjoys it so much it is never enough.

Pretty good! I had to use up some frozen hashbrowns, and this recipe came out very tasty. We used crumbled sausage, and replaced the milk with coconut milk (from the carton, not the can!) Turned out great. Would definitely make again. Thanks!

simple recipe.
i used shredded zucinni instead. when i baked the zucinni i seasoned it with salt, pepper, green onions, fresh garlic and a hint of paprika. i then poured a splash of low sodium chicken broth over it and baked it until it browned a bit.
i added fresh tomatoes, green onions, and diced yellow peppers. and used 5 eggs. 
NO cheese, butter or milk was used at all.

I just made this recipe and my daughter and I ate the whole thing before the pan even cooled lol.  
So versatile - I didn't have hashbrowns so I defrosted frozen crinkle-cut french fries and smooshed them with a fork as the crust!
Deli lunchmeat ham wored great, easier than dicing expensive ham.....added parsley and garlic powder to the mix -  and I used extra sharp cheddar cheese and mozzarella - awesome bite!

The flavor is good.  My only complaint is that it's missing veg.  On the second go around, I added a cup of defrosted spinach with the excess water squeezed out and then doubled the egg and milk quantities.  I also used a pinch of nutmeg and eliminated the seasoning salt.  I cut the butter quantity in half as well.  I used a 9x9 baking dish to accommodate the changes.   I would give the adjusted recipe another star.

My husband hated the idea of a potato quiche. One bite and he was in love. I used thin-cut sliced ham and some of it floated to the top and crisped up like bacon. GREAT RECIPE!

I doubled this recipe for our household of nine. I did end up using about six eggs instead of four, and used ground turkey instead of ham. Everyone loved it! There were not any leftovers at all. I would say it is a great "kid friendly" recipe!

So for this recipe I shredded 3 red potatoes which I think was a mistake. I baked them for 25 minutes at 450, but they didn't really get crispy. We love scrambled eggs so I added 10 eggs (I used a very large casserole dish). The main problem I had with this quiche is that it was pretty bland. Could have used some more spices.

Loved it! Based on the suggestions of others, I ended up using five eggs. I made it a little healthier by using 2% cheese and turkey ham. I also added some fresh spinach, which I lightly sauteed with the onions and some garlic, as some reported that their onions were undercooked. I also reduced the amount of butter to 1/4 cup. I will be making this again!

My son who hates eggs but loves hash browns devoured this!  It was very easy to make and delicious!!  You can change the ingredients around to almost anything i.e. shrimp, veggies, pizza-like, etc., or just enjoy as is.

Made this for a brunch and it was well-received.  Very tasty -- I made myself a second pie the next day!  I shredded my own potatoes and didn't bother with rinsing or drying -- didn't even peel them and they were just fine.  I used cooked bacon instead of ham and used an Italian blend of cheese from Safeway, since I didn't have any cheddar handy.  It was delicious.  I used only 4T of butter in the second pie and couldn't tell the difference.  It's definitely not heart-friendly with all the butter, but mmm, mmm good.  Next time I may try to add a bit more egg/milk and some spinach to make it a bit healthier.  But will definitely keep this in the recipe rotation.

My family loved this, I thought so-so. I used hash browns with onions and green peppers. That was good, but I wish the crust had been at least twice as thick. I added more eggs as suggested, and I added some pepperjack cheese. All were good additions. Maybe cooking it longer could have done the trick. However, this is a great use of leftover ham and I always have plenty of that at Christmas.

As we say here in Texas, "That was some good eatin!"  I pretty much followed the recipe, except used only 1/4 cup melted butter.  I sauted the onion in 1 Tbls. of butter, along with some chopped garlic.  Also, instead of regular seasoned salt, I used Garlic Season All Salt.  Used 3 eggs, and 2% cheddar.  Delicious.  Will be making again.

I wasn't impressed... it took 6 eggs to fill my 9in pan to a decent quiche level and the potato crust was great, the first day. Leftover was chewy and a little gross.

Was just OK.  I used frozen hash browns and didn't thaw before putting in the oven.  So, the potatoes never got crispy, just dry.  I will try again but will use fresh potatoes instead.

I made this, this morning, it was just ok. It took too long to make to be worth it. I thawed, squeezed & drained the hash browns with paper towels. Used 1/4 C butter. I had to cook longer to set the eggs. My husband ate it but said it was just ok. Sorry.

I changed this a bit to lighten it up.  Instead of butter, I sprayed the pie plate with butter flavored cooking spray, then pressed the hash browns into it and sprayed again and baked.  I change the ham to canadian bacon and used reduced fat cheese (not fat free)  I also used 2 whole eggs & 3 servings of EggBeaters.  It was great!!! Super tasty and didn't taste or feel 'lightened up'.  Definitely a keeper!  Everyone loved it!

Super Easy!  A nice dish if you don't have a ton of eggs on hand.  I also didn't have the shredded so I used the hash browns that are diced.  I had to cook it initially about 10 minutes longer but it came out great! Even the kids ate it!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great breakfast dish! I made a few simple additions. I used a little more hash browns, used 4 eggs in the recipe and added about 6 slices of crumbled bacon, The eggs all seemed to run to the bottom, so I scrambled up one more egg and coated the top of the whole thing. All of this was baked in a deep dish pie plate. Between me, my husband and the baby it was gone by lunch!

The family loved this recipe!  I used potatoes O'brien's instead of shredded hash brown potatoes.  Worked great, I just cooked the crust a bit longer.  I also sprayed the crust with with olive oil, so cut out the butter and it worked just fine.  I also added an extra egg.    Thanks for a great recipe, we will definitely make this one again!

Very good!  I made my own hashbrowns by shredding 4-5 medium potatoes.  They filled my pie plate quite well.  To reduce fat, I sprayed with cooking spray to brown them instead of using butter.  Perhaps because I had lots of potatoes, I found 2 eggs to be enough (could have fit one more) but I must admit I eyeballed all measurements except the milk so I may have used extra ham and cheese.  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  My kids liked the filling but not the hash browns.  With some fruit on the side, it made a nice, easy lunch.

I agree with many of the posters.  5 eggs are needed and much more cooking time about 15 additional minutes.  I also sauteed my hashbrowns with grren pepper and onions first as some suggested.  Thanks!!

My family went crazy for this.  I used the cubed hash browns, 6 eggs, added a 4 oz. can of diced green chiles, a few drops of Tapatio Sauce, used a Mexican blend cheese, and upped the milk to 3/4 cup. Baked for 35 min. and boy, what a treat I will repeat! Thank you, Karen!

Quick and easy recipe gives you alot of variety.  I used 5 eggs, added some sausage to the mix, and some diced green chiles.  Sprinkled with chile powder to zest up a little too.  Next time will try adding mushrooms.

A very delicious dish for breakfast. I am not usually a ham fan, but this tasted just perfect. The only thing I changed was increasing the eggs to 5. My family gobbled it up.

This is a great recipe for using left over ham after a holiday meal.  I suggest using 6 eggs and one cup of milk if you like 'eggier' quiche.  I also added some diced green pepper to the ham, cheese, and onion mix, and used southwest stlye shredded hash browns which gave just the right amount of kick.  Can't screw this one up!

This was pretty tasty and very easy to make.  I used 4 eggs and then it still didn't look like it was enough so I added another (for a total of 5) and it turned out really good.  This is a recipe that you could definitely alter to suit your tastes ... it didn't last long, gone in just a few minutes.  Will make again.

This was so yummy & easy!  My husband and I ate the whole thing!  I used 3 eggs but will use 4 or 5 next time.  We put Tabasco on top which was ever so tasty.  I'm also going to try adding green chiles next time, but it's great as it is!

Good recipe.  I liked it, others didn't like it as well.  I did use bacon since I didn't have ham.  Next time, would probably double the eggs & milk.  Two did not make it very fluffy.

My first time ever making a quiche and I have to say it came out really well. I could had made the hash brown crust more crunchy but didn't have the temp up high enough due to my chuck roast being in the oven. Seasoned the crust like it ask but I added some white pepper to it. I didn't have ham so I used Molinari Salami link cut into bite sizes pieces. Seasoned veggies before adding to eggs with basil, rosemary,  thyme. Added Spinach, Julienne Sweet baby bells peppers, half rings sliced white onions, mushrooms and some mince fresh garlic. Definitely will make it again

Delicious! I used 4 cups of frozen hash browns and fried them up first to get them a bit crispy. Then into the deep pie plate, drizzled with butter and baked in oven to really get golden. I chopped up cooked ham and fresh green onions and dried them a bit before adding them to the pie plate. Then shredded cheese on top. I beat 4 eggs with 3/4 cup of milk, salt and pepper and poured over the top. Then baked in oven as directed. Let cool and into fridge overnight then reheated in oven the next day for Christmas morning breakfast. What a hit!
Thanks to everyone who already wrote reviews that helped me decide to make these minor changes to ensure success.

I misplaced a recipe that I had for a similar dish, and this came close to it. For the meat, I used two red pepper and asiago chicken sausages that I pan fried, took out of the casing and crumbled. The hash brown edges came out inedible, being very hard and crispy. Maybe it needs a lower temp on the first bake, shorter time? Very good, though. Nice for anytime of the day

I have made this at least a dozen time. The only changes I make is what we put in the quiche. Sometimes it is just veggies, other time we have added sausage or bacon or ham.  We have even changed what kind of cheese. This is the perfect quiche recipe and the leftover quiche is perfect for my children to heat up in the morning before school.

I made this for my lady's hospitality breakfast and everyone loved it. It was easy! I used a 9"x 13" glass dish and prepared it the night before. I suggest you bake the potatoes in the dish ahead of time, then the next morning pour the ingredients inside the baked potatoes and put into the oven.

I think RAINBOWMIST and GRANNYGREEN are right, the original recipe doesn’t have enough eggs. I used four and absolutely could have used 5-6. With the additional eggs, baking time was 30 minutes. I spread out the hashbrowns and patted them dry with paper towels before cooking as well. I believe there would have been more flavor in the crust with GRANNYGREEN’s suggested modifications.

I used the ingredient search using what I had on hand and found this easy recipe. All I had was a package of frozen hashbrown patties, so that's what I used.  I thawed them in the microwave and mashed them up with my hands and it was the perfect amount for my pie dish. The only thing I changed was to add another egg. Two just didn't seem like enough and three was just right. Next time I won't use as much butter. I don't know if it was the patties or not, but my crust had a buttery puddle after blind-baking. I will definitely make this again. (This week, in fact.) We had it for dinner and everyone loved it. Hands-down a five star recipe.

This was very good, and also can be altered to your tastes easily with substitutions for different meats, cheeses, and additional spices.  I do agree with others, I thought it lacked enough eggs.  Next time I think I will up it by a couple and see how that turns out.

Good quiche recipe! I used 5 eggs, 1 1/4 C milk and added 6 cooked and crumbled pieces of bacon as I didn't have ham. I baked it in an 8x8  glass pan for 45 minutes. Very tasty!

I’m no chef, but my family and friends think I am when I make this! Delicious! I adhere to the recipe for the most part. I add in cream cheese and diced crunchy bacon to the ham mixture (and to sprinkle on top) with extra shredded cheese for presentation. Add in whatever you think would be yummy...you can’t really go wrong.

I chose this a a base recipe because I wanted a potato crust. I used a ramekin and the top edge of the potato almost burned (wasn’t really edible but didn’t ruin the dish). I might cover the edges in foil next time. I didn’t use ham or onions but mixed in salsa and shredded cheddar cheese before baking. It puffed up nicely. I also only used enough butter to grease the ramekin.

This was incredibly easy to make. I used the leftover ham from my wife’s Christmas ham. We have some of the best smoked ham that I’ve ever had made in Ossian, Indiana. This makes this dish really good. I used Southern style hashbrowns instead of shredded hashbrowns because my family likes those better. And I added a little bit more shredded cheese. Because everybody likes more cheese.

Our family really liked this recipe. I substituted with duck eggs due to my son's severe chicken egg allergy. I also omitted the onion per family tastes. Other than that it was made using the recipe amounts. This one is a keeper.

Very good. Made crust with shredded Hash Browns and used chicken sausage, 4 eggs, chopped collards and seasonings. Baked at high heat because I forgot to loser heat after filling shell but lowered after about 20 minutes! and it baked beautifully.

Really like the basic recipe, but add 2 extra eggs, 1/4 cup of milk and 3/4 cup chopped fresh or 1/2 frozen (thawed and squeeze out water first).  Takes a little longer to bake, but like it eggier :-)

My husband and kids loved this! It's definitely comfort food! I sautéed the onions first, and used tater tots instead of hash browns because it's what I had on hand. It was really easy to make and other than the two mods I made above, I stuck to the recipe.  This is a keeper for us!

I don't think enough time is given to bake the potatoes.  Next time I will continue to bake them till the bottom browns up.   It was too mushy at 25 minutes.  After taking the first bite we fried the bottom in a pan till it browned up.  Then it was delicious.  I added sausage instead of ham and also tomatoes.  I also used green onions instead of regular onions.

Amazing!  This is definitely a family favorite.  My niece always requests this for breakfast when she visits and my mother-in-law even asked for the recipe!  Great flavor and so easy to make.  The only adjustment I make is to increase the egg/milk mixture.  I could literally eat this every day!  Great the next day as well so you can make it ahead.

Fabulous! I didn't have hashbrowns so I used Tater Tots (thawed) and chopped with my hand pastry blender.  I liked the crust using the Tater Tots better than when I tried the hashbrowns!  This quiche has become a favorite!

My quiche is in the oven as we speak. I did not use a casserole dish, I substituted my deep dish cast iron skillet as the pan, which i also used to make my hashbrowns. for my hashbrowns I used Jimmy Deans Instant Cheesy Hashbrowns. And I substituted ham for sausage. It smells delicious with less than two minutes to go.

I must say this recipe was delicious and i will be making it again.

Tried with different ingredients and no ham; scallions instead of onions and heavy cream instead of milk and add cottage cheese. I used a quarter of the amount of butter and still was very greasy. It was good even my less adventure palate boyfriend like it.

Loved this recipe. I didn't make a lot of changes to the recipe.   I didn't use green pepper,  hate the taste of it cooked.  But I did lightly season the fresh hash browns with Lawry's and added finely diced onion before cooking them.  I had to let it cook another 15 minutes.  Definitely a good recipe.   Thanks.

I really liked this recipe.  However, as suggested by another reviewer, I think I would add an additional egg or two, and reduce the milk to 1/4 C.  I might add some green bell pepper and sauteed mushrooms as well.  Thanks!

I didn't have onions so I added a little onion powder and some mixed cajun seasonings as we like things a little spicier (Dinosaur BBQ Cajun foreplay rub spice mixture). It didn't set up quite like quiche but was so darned good that we ate the whole thing!

Delicious!! My husband is not a big egg fan so this was perfect for him. I followed the recipe and it was easy and good. Will make this again!

I think this is a very versatile base recipe.  I've made this several times, first time I followed directions exactly, and it was pretty good.  I've since made it with different cheeses, cooked spicy sausage, bacon, assorted veggies.  Lots of different directions to take this, and I've liked them all.  If you're using a big pie pan, I think you'll definitely want to add an extra egg or two.  Definitely a keeper!

Loved this recipe.  Made it with two extra eggs, and added mushrooms, because I used a deep dish pie plate.  It took a little longer to bake than what was noted on the recipe. I just made note of it for the next time.
Had the Quiche with a tossed garden salad for lunch at a "get together" at my Grandma's.
The "MMMMMM" sound came from everyone after each bite :)
This was very tasty and filling.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Like others have said 2 eggs are not enough, I doubled the recipe as well as added about 8 eggs as I was making 2.  It takes about 15 mins longer to bake in the oven as stated before.  I used frozen hash browns and they worked perfectly.  Used less butter and added a few more spices to taste.  Its a great start and I prefer the hash browns to pie crust!  It will be a staple in our home!  Thanks for posting!

Excellent! I used mushrooms and cilantro in addition to the onions. Also used veggie bacon instead. Added 1 extra egg too. It was delicious!

You can hardly taste the hash browns.  I would recommend using more, or just making a crust-less quiche, and having hash browns on the side.

The family really liked this recipe base.  I used ground beef and also added some cottage cheese.  I used 4 eggs and didn't add the milk. I baked it in my bean pot for about an hour.

Loved it! I left out the onions, then I doubled the ham because we had a lot left from Easter. Then added about 1 Tbsp. Ranch dressing mix to the eggs, poured that over the ham & cheese, and sprinkled about 2 Tbsp. parmesan cheese on top. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes in my 9-inch stoneware baker. That made the hashbrown crust perfectly crunchy. Mmmmmmmm!

We take this camping and it is a hearty good breakfast. I simply bake the hashbrowns in a pie pan beforehand, bring the liquid filling in another container and throw it in the trailer's oven in the morning. Bam! You have breakfast and you don't need anything else but some OJ. I like green peppers in this too.

Yum! I just made this with the tater tot variant and it turned out great. I meant to add broccoli but forget, will definitely add it next time. I used 3 eggs and seasoned with garlic powder, chili powder, salt and pepper. I also used a jalepeno chicken sausage and it is so good!!

This was quite tasty! I did have to bake the hashbrowns for about 40 min. to get them to brown but it was worth the wait! Way better than a traditional quiche crust! I added 5 eggs and 1 cup of milk as others suggested and it was soooo good!!! Will make again!

Awesome!   I used unfrozen packaged Hashbrowns--Southwest flavor. The flavor added a little kick.  Will definitely be making this again.  I made it for dinner, but I can't wait to make it for a breakfast potluck.

I had to modify to what I had in the fridge. Used colby jack chees ans bacon. Also put the shredded potato in a cloth and rung out the water. Wish I had crisped the crust longer. But very tasty.

This was great and EASY! I used hashbrown patties for the crust (like the ones you get at McDonald's). Worked great since I used a square dish. Then used 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk. Added green onions and spicy sausage to the egg mixture. Cooked completely, then added shredded cheddar to the top and broiled for about a minute to melt the cheese. Served it for brunch with my friends and everyone loved it.

Very good.  I left out the ham and added extra veggies and seasioning.  The only thing I would do next time is spread the potato's out to brown before I put them in the pie pan since I like them extra crispy.

My husband felt this was too salty and that the onions should have been chopped more finely (my fault, not the recipe's) but other than that we both enjoyed it.  The only change I made was adding an extra egg.

Everybody loved it. I also changed some stuff like less butter on potatoes, used O'Brien potatoes (2cups) and broiled them to cook faster, added cooked chopped bacon, thawed and drained spinach, mushrooms, and 4 eggs. Same recipe just added some stuff.

I live with my boyfriend and cooking for two is always a challenge for me. I'm constantly making too much food. This recipe is so tasty and can be easily made for two people! I used two 4-oz ramekins and reduced the recipe by a third on all the ingredients. I added about 1/8 cup of red and green peppers chopped and a little Parmesan cheese. I also read the other reviews and heated my hash browns on the stove top first with a little onion, salt and pepper before I baked the crust. I also topped with a little extra cheddar cheese and some fresh parsley about 5 minutes before it was done. It was really delicious!

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years. I use tater tots and crumble them for the crust(much cheaper). You can use any meat. I have even made this using spam. I brush the melted butter on the crust then bake it.  I always use at least 6 eggs and more cheese.

Excellent starter recipe.  Other ingredients to consider:  Tomato (finely diced), Spinach, Mushrooms.  But not too many ingredients at one time.  My fav is ham, tomato, and mushrooms.

This turned out nicely, but I'm not sure if the potato crust is supposed to be crispy on the bottom...mine wasn't and I would have liked it to be!  Perhaps it was because I drizzled olive oil on the hash browns (like others, I made them myself) instead of butter?  This is a wonderful gluten free option and I'm looking forward to playing with this great basic recipe!

I'm giving this 5 stars because this recipe is a good base, but needs a few modifications. First, 2 eggs is not enough, i made it with 2 eggs, next time I will probably use like 5. Also, I think less butter...maybe 1/4 cup not a 1/3. I substituted bulk sausage for the ham as a personal preference, but i think any meat would be great in this. I actually made it in the morning, then brought it to a brunch and warmed it in an oven on a low temp and it was great!!

Love this recipe.  Did one crazy thing different - I still used deep dish pie crusts, only because I had already bought them and then found this recipe on here. I reduced the hashbrowns to 1 cup and just threw them in frozen. Easy, fast and all three kids loved it.....which is rare!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe. I make it all the time now. The only thing I omit is the butter. I use a light coating of Olive Oil Spray with Garlic instead. It is so delish. I love the hash browns as the base. I was so hungry that one day I didn't bother cooking the hashbrowns first, just lined the pie dish and threw over the filling and cooked for 35 mins...it was still moorish!! So easy and so tasty too. Thank you

This was sooo yummy. I made my own hash browns using yellow potatoes. Shredded them up, cooked them in a seperate pan, then added them to the pie plate to bake fo radditional crispy texture before adding the filling. People came into work on overtime just to eat this dish.

Very good recipe! I put hashbrowns in fry pan with a little butter to crisp up and added Tastefully Simple Spinach & Herb seasoning and Garlic Garlic. I think this added so much flavor. I also put crust in the oven to crisp up a bit and think next time I will make sure its more crisp so its more of a crunchy crust. Used a lot of cheese (cheddar, mont. jack and parmeasan) so probably not the healthiest but very good! I added a can of mushrooms too.

I had a hard time getting the hashbrowns to brown and crisp up, but overall, it came out great! I added sauteed mushrooms and spinach to it just for more flavor.

DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  I didn't have any meat so I dethawed some frozen spinach and added that to the onions and cheese. I also added 2 extra eggs and cooked a little longer.  Even my picky four year old ate it:)

Super yummy.  I did add a few more eggs as well with some ham, onion and green peppers.  I did one using canola oil instead of the butter. Couldn't tell the differnce.

Holy  I love this recipe.  I tried it for the first time last Christmas for our family and they loved it!  Now I make it almost every Sunday night so I can take a slice to work with me all week.  Cooking times are a bit longer than suggested and that is even with my oven that seems to cook faster than most I have used.  I'd say an extra 7-10 minutes both times you put it in the oven.  I have had fun experimenting with different fillings as well.  My favorite is to use the recipe as is and add mushrooms and green bell pepper.  For an extra kick, I have even added about 1/4 cup of jalapeno jack cheese on top of the cheddar.  Yum!

Very fluffy and flavorful. I omitted the butter and salt, added another egg, and threw in some garlic powder. The hashbrowns didn't get as crispy as I would have liked, so I might fry them up a little beforehand next time. Thanks!

tasted ok. would have been much better with some chilies or jalapenos. Takes way too long to make to come out with something that is fairly bland.

I modified the recipe a little (used turkey, bacon bits and ham) and it was average.  There needs to be a recommendation on seasoned salt.  I think I used a little too much.  Also, the recipe does not specify frozen or thawed potatoes.

Whole family loved it.  I read some reviews and added 5 eggs instead of two, also some green pepper.  Did not use butter (sprayed pan with non-stick spray).  I didn't use either of the salts...felt the salt in the ham and the cheese made it salty enough.

Awesome! I modified to make a little lower in fat...brushed about a tblsp of butter over the hashbrowns before baking, I thought 1/3 cup was way excessive. I used 1/2 fat free shredded cheese and 1/2 2% shredded cheese and fat free milk. It still came out rich and wonderful. My husband ate half of it in one sitting and the only reason he didn't eat more was because he wanted the leftovers for breakfast. Great recipe!!

I made this quiche for a French wine tasting event and got rave reviews!  I did make a small substition - I used half of the cheddar cheese and then lay on top of the egg mixture some swiss (or gruyere) cheese for a more authentic French taste.  Delicious!

I've used this recipe for at least 4 years now and have varied the tastes. For example my family's favorites are Western - ham, mushrooms, green peppers and bacon all sauteed together topped with cheese then pour on the egg mixture. Or simply substituting cooked, drained and crumbled sage sausage instead of ham.  Experiment with this one! We've had a lot of fun!!

My husband loved it!  He's a fireman and knows how to cook really well so I was surprised when he sat down and ate the whole thing himself!

Great recipe!  I was really worried I would mess this one up because I used sausage instead of ham, but it turned out just fine, a little greasier perhaps, but still yummy!

I've made this two times and both times my family loved it. Even those who don't like onions loved it. I think this is one of the best "quiches" I have ever had and will make it often.

Excellent crust!  Very good.  Great all-round quiche recipe as well, even if you use the traditional crust.
