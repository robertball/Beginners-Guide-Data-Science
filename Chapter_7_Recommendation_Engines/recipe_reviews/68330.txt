Delicious!  I first had this dish when I lived in Japan.  The spicy "pop" of the tarako really perks up the pasta and balances the heaviness of the cream.  While tarako is probably tough to find in smaller communities, it should be a pretty standard item at most Japanese/Asian grocery stores.

I also like to add a touch of Kewpie Mayo. It's optional, but I seem to see a few recipes that use it.

thanks, this was so simple and tasted wonderful!  i added some sliced mushrooms (when i had this in japan, it came with shimeji mushrooms), and garnished it with some cilantro, which added a nice contrast to the richness.  also, i just added enough cream to smooth out the consistency, and it turned out great.

I would never have thought to make homemade tarako spaghetti.  Thanks for taking me away from the store bought mixes; they seem so bland now.  I didn't use the spicy roe so I just added crushed red pepper to my serving.  My kids loved it too.  I couldn't help but add 1 crushed clove of garlic after smelling the cream/butter mixture.  This is really easy and fabuloso!

A fun twist on a pasta dish. Tasty, spicy, creamy, and something I may make again since it was so easy to make.
