My family really loved this recipe.  I made just a couple of changes with I doubled the recipe.  I used 3 tbsps brown sugar instead of white sugar and threw in a can of pineapple.  I also used the pineapple juice instead of the water called for in the original recipe.

This is delicious, I doubled the recipe and added a can of pineapple chunks. Served over jasmine rice, everyone loved it! Will make again, thanks!!!

(came back a week later to say I made it with chicken and it was just as yummy, my family loves it!)

This recipe is REALLY good.  The only thing I did different was used boneless pork chops and cut them into thin strips along with the peppers and onions.  My boyfriend, who is not a fan of pork, absolutely loved it and said "save that recipe!"  I'll be making this again and I'll try it with chicken.  The sauce is delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

This is the best recipie I have ever found on this website.   I used pinapple juice instead of water, added a can of drained pinapple chunks, used red pepper and green pepper and substituted brown sugar for white sugar.  Served in on a bed of jasmine rice...  I  LOVED it, my teenagers loved it, my Asian girlfriend thought it was awesome and her small child loved it....  5 Stars!!!!!!!!  Also bought 2.5 pounds of bone-in loin chops, and cut it up into bite size squares, trimmed the fat and that left about 2 pounds of meat. It was perfect...

This recipe tastes better than what you would get at a restaurant, is healthier, and is fast to make! I followed substitutions already listed here: added a can of chunk pineapple, subbed pineapple juice for the water, subbed chicken broth for the wine, and subbed brown sugar for white. I also added two matchsticked carrots and served over brown rice with chopped peanuts and green onions. My fiance, who is wary of new things, loved this! I will make it again!

I didnt have white wine so I used chicken broth in place of the wine and the water. I also used a cider ginegar instead. I added a mixture of red, yellow and green peppers and served over brown rice.

This is a great recipe which can be used with chicken, pork or shrimp.  I used leftover pork roast and it was delicious.  I didn't have any white wine so I used chicken broth and it was delicious.

I just made this!!! It is delicious. I doubled the sauce, used 3/4 cup brown sugar ( in the doubled sauce recipe), a red pepper ( I had that on hand), low sodium soy sauce, and replaced the water with pineapple juice, and added the pineapple when sauteeing the pepper, onions, and garlic. At the end, I added just a hint of ground ginger for my taste preference. I will def make this again. Yum!!!

I followed the sauce recipe as written and it was FABULOUS! I did make changes to other ingredients b/c that is what I had in my kitchen...I used chicken breast instead of pork and a mixture of veggies I had on hand - onions, celery, peppers, baby carrots and it worked very well. I will definitely make this one again!

Wow!  This is one of the best stir fry recipes I've ever tried.  Did make a few changes.  Used some red as well as some green peppers and a few juilienne carrots, subbed brown sugar for white and decreased it to 1/3 cup.  Added a can pineapple chunks and used 1/2 cup juice instead of wine and water.  Added 3 Tbso chili garlic sauce to the sauce.  Also added a small can of water chestnuts.  Lots of changes but it was really wonderful!  Will certainly make it again!  I think it would be good with chicken too.

very good. added 4 packets of splenda instead of sugar. Drained a can of pineapples in juice (not syrup) and reserved juice. Used 1/4 cup juice instead of water & added pineapple chunks. Delish!

Wow, Fantastic.  Loved how it came out, though I did add the pineapple chunks to it and substituted the water for pineapple juice.  This is a winner, one recipe I'll prepare often.

This recipe is awesome.  Added pineapple like other reviewers have recommended including the juice in place of the water.  Also used apple cider vinegar, since I didn't have red on hand.  Turned out awesome.  Better than my local asian restaurant!

This was REALLY good and very easy! The first time I make a recipe, I normally read all the reviews but then make it exactly as written to get a baseline. However, most of the reviews on this one were so similar, I took a lot of the advice and made some of the changes. I used chicken broth instead of water, brown sugar instead of white, used 3 peppers (red & green), and added ginger. I didn't have any pineapple on hand but would have added that if I did. It would have definitely rounded it out. I should have doubled the sauce ingredients as well since I put in more vegetables than called for. Anyway, this is now a family favorite and will become part of the regular meal plans...in all the many incarnations I can imagine!!

A+ recipe. I doubled the sauce and substituted white grape juice for the white wine. I drained a can of pineapple chunks in juice and substituted for the water then added a few chunks in the sauce. Definitely will use this recipe again. I might try with chicken and shrimp also.

Followed the recipe to a T, save a couple of additions - and it was fabulous. We added a few dried chili peppers (we love spicy food) and some leftover bean sprouts, all served over rice noodles - mmmmm! Thanks for sharing!

It's good but was kinda spicy for us.  My kids weren't too crazy about this dish either.  I doubled the recipe & added pinapple to substitute for water & sugar (used onlyl 3 tbsp brown sugar).  The pepper was too much.  I'd only use 1 tsp for a double recipe, or maybe even 1/2 tsp.

I used malt vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and instead of 1/2 c. sugar, i used 3 tbsp. dark brown sugar.  Very good.  Reminds me of michealina's sweet and sour frozen entrees.

The only variation I made was to add a can of pineapple chunks and substituted the juice for the water.  IMO you can't have sweet n sour without pineapple.  I've made this numerous times and it remains one of my family's favorites.

This tasted awesome! I’ve always wanted to cook sweet and sour pork and this hit the spot! Like the others, I added pineapple chunks; and substituted brown sugar for white sugar, pineapple juice for white wine, apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar, and chicken stock for water. My husband loved it!

I too added 8 oz can of pineapple chunks and used pineapple juice instead of water.  I also used two peppers, one green, one red.  I found the sauce a bit thick so I diluted it a bit with chicken broth, about 1 cup, just before serving over rice.  Delicious!  Very easy for a weeknight especially when you buy the pre-cut pork strips as I did.  New favorite. Update: Made again tonight, hubby complained too sweet - cut down on sugar next time.

Yum. 2 particular teenagers & 1 particular husband even liked it!  I substituted apple cider vinegar for the red wine, since I didn't have any. I think the recipe is very forgiving & one could add what they want. I added 4 carrots sliced thin and a small can of water chestnuts. I doubled the sauce ingredients and used 1/2 C turbinado sugar & 1/2 C brown sugar, next time I will cut the sugar to only 3/4 C.

This recipe is a keeper!  I read the reviews, so added pineapple, brown sugar, and pineapple juice.  I doubled the recipe, too.  In addition, I didn't add the salt or pepper.

I doubled the sauce as some had suggested.
For next time, I'll add sliced thin carrots to sneak in more veggies, as well as chunks of pineapple. Maybe substitute the pineapple juice for the water and omit most or all of the sugar.

This was wonderful!  Easy to make though a bit time consuming. Like all stir fries, must have everything chopped and ingredients ready  before you start cooking.  Will definitely make again.

I did like a few others and added pineapple chuncks, pineapple juice instead of water, and brown sugar instead of white.   Will be making this again for sure.

Made this last night. Cut the meat like the picture, 1/2 x 2. Left out the sugar, used a can of pineapple pieces. Used white wine vinegar, and veg. broth for water. Cut the pepper  in half. Added 1 Tlb. of Korean Pepper Paste. Put it on quick brown rice and it was great.

This is a very delicious twist on Sweet and Sour. I've made it plenty of times, and is wonderful as is, but I also like to add some lemon juice, and a little bit of pineapple juice. It goes great with pork or chicken, and tastes great the next day too. Thank you for the share!

Wonderful recipe with a nice flavor which is not too sweet. I ended up using what I had on had: 2 pork tenderloins, 1 yellow squash, 1 zucchini, and 1 and a half red bell pepper. I didn't have the onion. I cut the pork into strips and cooked at directed. After removing it from the pan, I added some butter and my vegetables with a couple teaspoons of minced garlic. Stir fried it, and after removing them proceeded to make the sauce. I used a sweet Moscato white wine. 
I served it over jasmine rice made with chicken broth instead of water. 
Both my husband and I really liked it. I can't wait to try other variations.

This was really good.  I did subsitute the white wine and water for chicken stock.  Only other thing is I would double or triple the sauce so you have some for the rice.

Like nongard1, I think it needed a little more bite - substituting pineapple juice for the water, brown sugar rather than the white, and adding pineapple will all be on my agenda the next time I prepare this...which will not be long from now!

I forgot the garlic and it still came out great! I lightened it up by cutting the oil and butter in half and used sugar substitute, and also doubled the sauce per other reviewer's suggestions. It tasted and looked like it came from a restaurant!!! I also added chunk pineapple (with a little juice) when I added the pork back into the pan. Loved it!
