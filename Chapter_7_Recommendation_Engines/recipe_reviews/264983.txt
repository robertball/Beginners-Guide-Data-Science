This is my recipe, and I generally  marinate at least 4 lbs. of steak (usually skirt steak) at a time and double the marinade ingredients. One thing that should be mentioned is that the silver skin should be removed from the meat before putting it into the marinade. This helps to make the meat more tender. For my family, this is enough for 4 meals. After 24 hours of marinating, I divide the meat, cilantro, and marinade into 4 freezer bags. This provides us with 4 quick meals that I need to add only refried beans and Mexican corn.  This recipe is one of my family's favorites.

This is awesome. Once I got to marinade mixed up, I wanted to drink it. The aroma is mouthwatering. The next time, I will add more onion, though. One medium onion simply wasnâ€™t enough. I used half chicken and half steak. Thank you for the recipe.

It was pretty good, my first time making carne asada.  I overcooked it a little, don't forget that it'll cook a bit while resting.

I only had  hours to marinate,  however it still was delicious.  I added just a little more chipotle for a bit more kick. I will make again.

This was delicious, but a bit too heavy on the chile powder for me personally. I will cut it in half next time I make these. Otherwise, this was a wonderful meal and even my 5 year old devoured his fajitas.
