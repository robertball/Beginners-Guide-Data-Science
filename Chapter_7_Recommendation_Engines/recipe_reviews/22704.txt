What a beautiful cake!  We used crepe paper instead of ribbons, and wound 2 different colors around the foil handle, and then tied a big bow on top.  The round part of the cake that was cut out was frosted, decorated and given to the one person at the table who hated coconut.  I can't wait to make this next year when my son is old enough to help me decorate it!

Wow!  This was so easy, and it turned out to be so cute!!  For the handle, I wanted to use several red licorice ropes, but I accidentally picked up the wrong kind at the store.  I was in a bit of a crunch, time wise, so this idea will have to wait until next year.  Instead, I laid out a piece of rose-colored saran wrap, laid a piece of tin foil, the same size, on top of it, then rolled the two together.  The handle was pretty and strong; the ends went right down into the sides of the cake.  The coconut was a lot less messy than I thought it would be to color, and it looked great in and around the cake!  I filled the middle of the "basket" with some of the coconut grass and then put in some chocolates and jelly beans.  Thanks for a terrific idea that will likely be a new tradition!

I made an Easter basket cake many years ago and had forgotten about it. This recipe was a good reminder. I made this cake with an Almond Bundt cake and Whipped Cream-Cream Cheese frosting, both from this site. I baked it in a bundt pan. When cooled, I frosted and filled the whole with green tinted coconut and placed a variety of Easter candy in the middle. Instead of making a handle out of foil which does not bend nicely, I used floral wrapped wire sticks and curved them gently around a round object. Then I wrapped with bright colored ribbons and made two bows of matching, but different ribbons. Everyone thought I really fussed with the cake when in actually, it was very easy. It looked very festive with my Easter meal. I will definitely do this again. Picture to be posted soon. Thanks for sharing.

Great idea and fun to make.  I made a coconut cake and used a basket weave for the decorations.  My 4 and 2 year old helped make the molded chocolates we used to decorate the middle.  Several people at our Easter party didn't think if was a cake at first.  I used card stock folded and glued for the handle and then just attached a bow.  I cut a bamboo skewer in half and used them to help hold the handle.

I made this and it turned out great and i'm not usually a one to bake and be patient with a project like this. It was pretty easy. I have a tip though when cutting out the center use the smallest bowl or big tea cup push it down in the middle pull it out it is easier then trying to make it even with a knife. It is also a good small dessert for later. Don't go to heavy with the coconut. Overall it was fun and good tasting. Try it you will love it. GOOD LUCK

I have made this and it is so easy and so cute! Rather than go through the fuss of making a handle, I go to the dollar store and buy a cheap easter basket. I use wire cutters to cut the handle off and use it in the cake! Sooo easy!

very cute and easy idea.  I used some light cardboard to form the handle and wrapped with grosgrain ribbon.  You'll want to have about 2 cans of icing to get enough coverage and not be short.  Very fun for everyone!

SUPER easy to do!  I used my own combination of candies.  But definitely used the peeps.  That was a great idea/suggestion!  My nephew, who is 3 years old, was completely enamored by the Easter Basket cake and loved being able to have a little taste (a piece of candy out of the basket) before having to wait literally hours to be able to cut it.  :)  My bf, who is VERY handy, helped me fashion a handle out of thin jelly strips that I had found in fruity flavors, therefore in pretty colors.  I braided it and he weaved some floral wire loosely through it to give it strength and form...and then just un-weaved it when my nephew just HAD to eat the handle! :)

It was a big hit at the Easter party and it was easy to make. I have made it a few times since trying it.  You can also make it a xmas basket by adding fake Pointsettia flowers, winter berries (red hots or w/e candy fits your needs) and decor, and little xmas packages in the center, add garland to the handle or go candy cane style with red and white ribbon on the handle. Let your imagination explore. ^-^

I love how this cake turned out!! I used two hard plastic replacement straws along with the handle from a gift bag to assemble the handle and it is very sturdy. Applying the big bow added a lot and helped to detract from my less-than-perfect basket piping. I thought the basket weave technique was the hardest part about this project. Place a jelly bean with some icing for stabilization behind each Peep to keep them standing upright. I used a recipe for a lemon cake with raspberry jam filling and a lemon meringue  icing to make the inside extra appetizing. This cake is sure to add something special for young and old at your Easter meal!!

Well this cake looked so good, that even when part of it collapsed (due to one of the layers needing another minute or two in the oven,) I still received a lot of compliments.  I used a chocolate cake, which I covered in pink-dyed frosting.  Then, I used a basket weaving technique for the frosting using pink and purple colors for the sides.  (If you have never used this technique, it is much simpler than it looks.  I had found a tutorial by Wilton on Youtube.)  I used different colors of marshmallow chicks and spiced jelly bean eggs for the top decorations.  I tried to spread green-dyed frosting into the center of the cake basket, but then realized it would be easier to pipe it, since the cake sides were breaking apart as I was spreading it.  (I did not use the coconut, because i don't like it.)  Overall, this looked fantastic, despite the collapsed section.

Thanks for all the cool pictures to inspire me to make my own basket cake!  Did a 2 layer choc. cake frosted with a basketweave tip.  Used a piece of clear,flexable tubing (bought for cheap at Lowes) covered in ribbon for the handle.  Secured with long bamboo shish kabob sticks.  My Easter guests thought it was a real basket.  : )

I made this cake and it was lovely, very easy to make.  I used a small round bowl and pressed it in the middle and cut the circle out that way.  I would definately make it again!

Cute idea, easier than others I've seen, and I really like the handle idea. That turned out well. But the ring on top completely fell apart when I tried to frost it. I followed directions, but I was just asking too much of that cake, to have its center cut out, placed on top of another layer, and then smear frosting all over it, including the inside hole. I don't know that I'd attempt this again--maybe a smaller hole, but that'd leave very little room for candy.

This was so fun and easy to make. I wasn't sure exactly how I wanted to decorate it so I didn't put too much on the cake and it turned out so nice. Love this recipe and what an excellent idea, thank you.

I love it!  Make it every year now for my friend's kids.  Just be careful with the top layer cause it can split easily and it's hard to glue it back together with icing.

Fun! I used a chocolate cake with white icing and it does take 2 cans of frosting.  Loved the coconut grass, it is so cute.  Had a great time making this cake and using my imagination on the decorations.  My husband was surprised i was doing something so clever.

The instructions are excellent for this cake.  Mine wasn't as pretty as others, but then I'm not good at following instructions!  LOL!  It takes a bit of time, but I'm looking forward to see the child's face at the Easter dinner we're going to.  Thanks for the idea!

Very cute idea! To keep your cake from falling apart, freeze the layers separately, then cut out the hole, assemble  and frost. I bake a lot of cakes and I freeze most of them to make assembly easily, also, no crumbs!

Such a cute idea. I tried it two ways: once with the candies, and once with the forked basket weave look. Both were adorbs. If you're frosting challenged, the candy makes it all seem tidy and pretty, and if your cake is a little lopsided, well, that's just very basket-like, isn't it?

Loved it and so did my whole family! A huge hit. I used Hershey's perfectly chocolate cake recipe with homemade vanilla buttercream and was great. Thank you so much for the great idea!

Great! I made this for the kids. Because there were so many I baked a white cake recipe doubled and put into 9" Pans. Visited the local candy and cake store for lemon filling and food color spray. I sprayed the coconut green. Sprayed the iced cake to look like an easter basket (yellow & green). Picked up chicken and duck suckers to stick in the top of the cake, added chocolate marshmellow eggs & Easter colored M&Ms. No handle. Thought what I had was enough. Will add a picture as soon as I download it.

Finally an Easter cake idea that doesn't require cutting of small pieces of cake or a special mold.  I will make this simple cake this easter!  Thanks for a simple, yet creative, idea!!

This was a very simple and fun cake. I made it for a church potluck around Easter and everyone just loved how cute it looked. With this cake you can be very creative.

Made 3 layers with 9 inch round pans. Had to use 1.5 box cake mix. Used edible Easter grass instead of coconut for the grass.

Great idea!   Instead of using a white cake mix and white frosting I used a blue velvet for the bottom layer and pink velvet for the top layer.  I used cream cheese frosting.  It turned out great.  I thought it would be mostly the kids that would like it but I was wrong.  :)
