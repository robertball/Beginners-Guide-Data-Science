This was really good, very easy, LOTS of flavor.  I added 3 more tbsp of brown sugar (personal pref.) and it needed a tbsp of apple cider vinegar (made a big difference!)  My small 2 lb elk roast took about 7 hours on high in order to shred and I had to add about a 1/2 c. water at the end to keep it moist.  Be careful with the hot sauce!!  The flavors really condense and a few drops made it pretty spicey.  I served it on deli rolls, toasted with mayo & parmesean, a slice of provalone and some homemade cole slaw on top....Hubby LOVED it!

This sauce is amazing!!! I will use this recipe for ANY type of meat....would be delicious for barbequed beef or pulled pork as well. It really was perfect for elk, one would think they were eating beef! I followed the advice of "FAT~DOG~LANE" and added a tbsp. of vinegar. It did add some even better flavor....if that's possible! Thanks for sharing such a fabulous recipe! It's a keeper!

This was probably the best Elk I've ever cooked!  It was so moist and just melted in my mouth!  YUM!  I might go as far as saying it was the best thing I've ever cooked!

I made this with deer meat and it was great. I just let it all cook in the crockpot and had supper ready when I got home from work.  We enjoyed the leftovers of this for a few days.

I made this with venison and I found it very good but not saucy enough for my tastes. It was very very good, but I will continue my hunt for the perfect shredded meat recipe.

My sister and I do what we call "guina pig night" where once a week we take turns cooking a meal that has to be a recipe we haven't tried or a different version of an old faithful.  My husband just got his elk and it was my turn so I found this recipe.  I followed it to the letter and got scored 10 (we rate 1-10) all around!  I didn't have to add anything including water and there was enough sauce to put in a bowl and we could add extra on the bun if we chose.  This was the easiest recipe I've ever made and it will get made again and again.  Not that this isn't long enough, but I also fixed the Mom's German Cole Slaw I found on this sight and we added it to our sandwiches and it was a perfect topper and a huge hit!

Yum, yum!  Made this with 1 lb of deer burger and cut the ingredients in 1/2.  Husband couldn't say enough and I loved it too.  No deer taste at all.  Thanks for sharing.

I used ground elk which I browned before slow cooking it in the sauce.  I thought it was great and tasted just like a sloppy joe.  Another person who tasted it thought it was still a little gamey (but to be fair, they are sensitive to the taste in general).

Cooked more like 6.5 hours for it to shred and had to add about 1/2 cup water at the end so it wasn't so dry but delicious! My 3 and 5 year olds ate a whole one!!!

We made this years ago for our visiting family, and they have been talking abut it ever since.  My only change was leaving out the liquid smoke (didn't have any) and it was still amazing.  Today we get to pick up the meat from my kids' first elk...guess what's for dinner??!!! :)

I've made this several times now and each time I'm amazed at how good it makes the elk taste!! My husband's friend frequently gives us fresh elk meat and this is my absolute favorite recipe to use for it!! I usually add a bit of paprika and some extra garlic and onion powder because we love those flavors, but really this recipe is perfect exactly as it's written!!!

Everyone loved this! This includes four kids under the age of 10, one of whom is very picky. We will definitely be making this again. I didn't change anything.

So yummy and so easy!  We used venison instead, and used apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice because we didn't have any on hand and no W. sauce, because we have an allergy in the house.

We used this for an odd shaped venison roast.  What a great recipe!  Easy, tasty and great left overs.  What more can you ask?  We made this one weekend and ended up freezing the meat and using that afterwards for sandwiches on the ski hill a week later.  The meat still tastes good cold!  We will use this again for sure!  The only thing we changed was we used deer instead of elk.

This was delicious!! Did add a couple more tablespoons of brown sugar and 1 tbsp of cider vinegar as per reviews. I am extremely sensitive to the gamey taste of wild meat, but this is a keeper of a recipe! I served it on kaiser bun with cheddar and parmesan melted onto it, and with a cilantro mayonnaise. Fabulous!
