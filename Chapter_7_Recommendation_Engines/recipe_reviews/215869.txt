I researched and read many lasagna recipes for something different. I used this one a a major base and did make some changes that I saw in other recipes and this turned out just awesome! First bite your taste buds stand up and say HELLO!!!! Now I call this "Red & White Sausage Spiniach Lasagna". It really went together quickly! I will be making this again. I made 2 8x8 pans and froz one for our long weekend in the PA mountains.

This worked out great.  I tried it because I had a lot of the ingredients on hand and needed to use them up.  I did not have Lasagna noodles so I used egg noodles instead.  I also had fresh spinach that I wilted first and used instead of frozen.  I think it could use a little more sauce but it was still great with what was called for.  It wasn't hard to put together either.  My husband loved it and said he would like it to be a regular on our dinner menu.

Made it with turkey and every light option I could think of. It was excellent.
