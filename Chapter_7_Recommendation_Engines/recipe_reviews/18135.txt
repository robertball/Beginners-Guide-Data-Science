This is a VERY sweet cake because of the addition of the gelatin.  You might try
using only 1/2 of the gelatin package.
Overall, I think this could be a good cake for a child's birthday party with some tweaking
to the recipe here and there.

This recipe is good just like it is.  I have made this twice.  First time with the orange gelatin, second time with cherry.  Both excellent.  I also used vanilla ice cream to top it off.  YUMMY!  So quick and easy, thanks!
