My daughter and I made this with sole fillets for the family - adults and kids all liked it but as my daughter said, it seems more a 'good start' to a recipe, and could use some work. We all agreed it needs a bit more flavor. Next time we'll try draining the tomatoes so the veggies aren't as watery, and perhaps add red pepper flakes, more capers and a little more pepper.  The vegetables would be better sauteed in some of the olive oil before adding to the baking pan - they were undercooked and the fish would have been overcooked if left in the oven long enough for the vegetables to catch up. Precooking the celery and onions etc. would also enhance the flavor.  A good, healthy main course that just needs a bit of tweaking to personal tastes.

Very delicious.  I had it with cod fillet instead of halibut fillet.  Although it would be better with fresh tomatoes instead of canned I will still give it 5 stars

I did it with tilapia instead of halibut, and it turned out delicious! My wife and I loved this recipe, definitely a new staple :)

Excellent recipe, even my 10 year old enjoyed it, though she said it needed more garlic :) Fast, easy and healthy, I served it with lemon spinach couscous and salad.  Fresh halibut made it an awesome dish.

YUM! My husband and I made this recipe this week and it is soooooo tasty and filled with flavor. We actually used Mahi Mahi instead of halibut only because we couldn't find fresh halibut. We will definitely make this again.

Used this recipe with frozen cod fillets and it was still absolutely delicious! The capers and celery give it a fresh, different taste. I love that this was both healthy AND tasty!

Did with snapper (what was available) and had to use shallots instead of onion (forgot onion...sigh) and it turned out wonderful.

Quick and easy, with plenty of flavor.  This was a real hit!  The capers put a great touch on a simple dish.  The local store didn't have any halibut so I substituted flounder which did just fine.

delicious!  shockingly, even the 18 months old and the 4 year old ate the fish.  I took some liberties, added whatever veggies I had in the fridge - mushrooms, onion, cooked them with a bit of olive oil, and added a few green olives as well as capers.

You can’t imagine how much flavor this recipe has until you taste it for yourself! I make it at least once a week. I exclude the peppers simply because I don’t prefer them. I also dice my own fresh tomatoes. Other than that I follow the recipe and it is absolutely delicious every time. I serve it over wild rice and use all organic ingredients. Scrumptious and healthy!! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe! I love it so much!

Even thought I omitted the capers (havent found GF capers..) this turned out wonderful. Ive made it twice now both with halibut and cod. Used diced petite tomatoes from the carton. The fish turns out so tender. Great alternative to simple broil and grill methods.

Delicious basic recipe that can be adapted in many ways. I added fresh from our garden tomatoes, broccoli and zucchini. No canned tomatoes- white wine for liquid instead and of course garlic and onions. Yum! I know I’ll make this again and again!

It had no flavor at all. All it really needs is a good flavorful sauce, then I think it could work.

My husband was mad that I was using tomatoes (he nor our son likes them), but I told him I wanted them for the flavor against the fish. I used tilapia, omitted the capers and bell pepper and I have to say this was so good. Both of them loved the fish and I piled the tomatoes on my plate. Very good dish and my hubby requested I make it again.

This recipe is incredibly good!  It may be healthy, but it tastes like comfort food.  I used cod instead, it was wonderful.
