Used arugula and goat cheese crumbles and no oil- dressed with a bit of balsamic and also added a chopped hard boiled egg. Is it the same recipe at all? No- but the beets were already spiraled at the grocery & $3.00 off the usual $3.99 so thought Iâ€™d try something new

I have made this twice for my family, and we love it.  I used a high quality, syrupy balsamic vinegar, and included some minced garlic in the dressing.  A good strong blue cheese works best.
