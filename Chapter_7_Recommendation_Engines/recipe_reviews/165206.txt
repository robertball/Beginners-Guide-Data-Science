I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  It tasted GREAT -- only thing is my hubby had really bad heartburn afterwards.  He doesn't usually react this strongly to restaurant indian food, so this was unusual.  But my son and I loved it!  If I ever do it again, I may do less of the spices, as 2 tablespoons of ANY spice is a lot.  This recipe uses around 5 tablespoons of spices, which is a lot for most curries that I have made.  I think you could half the spice and it would be almost as good, and your husband's tummy won't go crazy!

I've eaten quite a bit of Indian food and this really didn't taste that authentic.  The beef stock confused the flavours.  I would use water the next time.  It has a bit of Indian character because of the spices but lacks the heat which is characteristic of Indian curries.  I added Chinese chilli sauce which made it hotter.  

This would be fine for someone who wants a hint of Indian character but would find an authentic Indian recipe too spicy or too hot.

Delicious!  Using the dried spices makes it so flavorful.  I have also used small chops instead of cubed meat.  I am sending it to a friend who is living on a sailboat off the coast of New Zealand.  Should be easy to make in galley kitchen!

This was really good. The spice mixture was excellent and the lamb was cooked perfectly, but I made a few modifications.  First, I doubled the cayenne pepper amount based on previous reviewers' comments that it was a bit mild.  Second, to save money on lamb (and to cut down on the calories), I used 1.25 lbs of lamb and supplemented the rest of the dish with 1 cup of chopped carrots (added when I added the onions), 1 lb. of cauliflower (added in the last 20 minutes when I removed the lid from the Dutch oven), and 1 cup of frozen peas (added in the last two minutes of cooking).  I will definitely make this again. We devoured it. Next time, I might try the slow-cooker approach. Thanks for posting!!

I found this to be a little on the mild side, I was hoping for more flavour from the amount of spices, the meat, however, was tender and delicious, I will make this again with some tweaking of the spices.

Delicious!  My family of 4 loved it.  Next time, I will double the recipe to have left over because it was devoured.

Im not sure about those who reviewed the recipe saying it was mild, because my mouth was on fire after eating this, and I loved every minute of it! I lightly floured and seasoned the meat before browning, like you would with beef stew. I also added potatoes and carrots. A great, unique (and spicy) alternative to your average beef stew.

This turned out quite good. I added additional cayenne and had to cook lamb for longer than an hour to get it tender, but I may have had the heat too low. I ground the cumin coriander and cardamom myself and I think that made the flavors nice and bright.

I followed this recipe exactly as written for dinner tonight and both my husband and I were very disapointed. We found it lacking spicy heat and the complex flavors we expect. I will definitely not be making this again!

I thought this was amazing!  Our family likes lamb but doesn't love it.  After we all tasted this recipe- we are ALL convinced lamb can be delicious!  Perfect seasoning, great sauce, wonderful over rice.  I will be making this again!

In addition to the spices listed here, I added cayenne pepper, red chile pepper, curry leaves, fennel, cardamom pods, one ground cinnamon stick, and a small amount of a meat masala blend (Laxshmi brand).  It came out slightly more liquidy than I am used to so if I did it in the future I would probably use less beef stock and possibly thicken with potatoes or a small amount of flour.  I served it over brown basmati with naan.

Delicious! Easy to make. You can substitute the seasonings for a good curry seasoning if you don't have everything to make it yourself.

I loved this recipe - the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars that I made a few modifications. Our family aren't die-hard spicy curry fans, so I halved all the spices. If you aren't used to spicy food, you should probably stick with only half the amount called for. I also only put in about half the amount of lamb called for - that was all I had. It was still delicious, and cheaper too.:) I served it over cooked quinoa - yummmm!!! Definitely making this again!

I made this following the recipe as written.  Everyone felt that some that something  was missing.  Not too spicy or hot. Couldn’t figure out the missing ingredient. But I loved the easy directions and the lamb was very tender ( although I cooked it a little longer to make sure it would be tender).  Will try again with some tweaking.

I already had ready-made Jamaican hot curry powder, which combines coriander, garlic, turmeric and cumin, so I used that instead of the four spices separately. I also omitted the cardamon (didn't have any), made a cornstarch slurry (1 tablespoon each cornstarch and water) to thicken the sauce and forgot the yogurt at the end. The recipe is indeed ideal for a slow cooker,  and my lamb-loving friend whose family hails from Trinidad and Tobago loved it as much as I did!

Very good.  We didn't find it too spicy at all and will play with  increasing the amount of the spices next time. I liked the suggestion to add cauliflower (with just enough time to make it tender) and frozen peas (at the end, again so as not to over cook).   There was also had lots of liquid, but that just gets absorbed by the rice or mashed potatoes that we serve it with.

First attempt at Lamb Curry, my partner who loves curry really enjoyed this! I used chicken broth rather than beef, added a bit more cayenne and a chopped tomato, simmered it in the slow cooker about 5 hours.....this recipe is a keeper!
