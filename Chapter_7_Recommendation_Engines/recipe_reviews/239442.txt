Excellent.  I've made this a few times and everyone comments that they love it. Substituted 3/4 package of diced ham for the sausage. Used a little under an 8 oz package of shredded cheddar last time because that's what I had on hand.  It cooks in about 7 hrs on low in my cooker & then I switch it to warm until everyone else wakes up. It smells yummy. Served with fruit salad, bagels, or croissants.

First time made it as written and it needed more flavor.  Second time I added sharp cheddar as well as some green peppers... perfect, was a hit!

The Italian sausage overpowers the hole dish. The hubs had to drown it in ketchup. I think it would be wonderful with regular sausage and a bit less cheese. Will def try again with our own tweaks.

It was good. Next time I'll probably add diced white onion.

I took the advice of others who have tried this to balance out the sausage and cheese. I did not add any salt, just the pepper and ground mustard. Rounded out the sausage with some bacon bits. Used monterey jack blend instead of mozzarella. The flavor turned out OK...and still on the salty end, so glad I followed that advice. But the texture was not appealing at all, The potatoes were just mush on the bottom where they had settled out, and the cheese was mostly on the top in a tougher crust. Won't be trying this one again.

Used maple sausage and mild cheddar. Decent flavor but next time will add a little onion and maybe red peppers for color and flavor. May also mix the potatoes with the cheese to get a more blended flavor.

I liked it, but the potatoes need to be cooked separately so they get crispy.

Turned out great. Add a little garlic salt for more flavor.

It was very tasty but like some of the other comments the bottom got a little burned . I cooked it on low in my crock pot for 3.5 hours - probably only needed 2.5

I don't eat meat, but my fiance does and he loves this. I may try it with "fake" sausage--it smells heavenly in the morning when it's done and I'd sure like to try it out!

Instead of sausage I used bacon bits and chopped ham.  It was excellent.

Everyone like it. I thought it could use more sausage and some red bell pepper to give it a little color.

I made it as the recipe said.  Next time, I'll add some veggies.  It was a little dry on the edges but family enjoyed it.

Made it as suggested except did regular pork sausage and half the cheese for lactose intolerant spoise. I thought it was kind of dry but I am not a big fan of hash browns. Others in family liked it with ketchup on top.
