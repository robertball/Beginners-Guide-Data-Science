Thank you for this recipe!  My husband brought home some elk steak and wanted me to cook him something delish with it. This recipe was it!  He LOVED it.  I followed it exactly and served it over some cilantro lime rice I made.  He also wants me to cook it again sometime and use beef.

Very much enjoyed this recipe.  We made a few slight variations based on ingredients we had available in the house.  Will definately make again..

Wow!  This is so easy and delicious.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except: I used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch as we like a thick stir fry, 3 tablespoons of soy sauce for more flavor and substituted  vegetable broth for the beef broth.  I also sauteed the mushrooms with the green peppers and onions.  I assume that they were added later in the recipe as they were already prepared or canned.  We served this over rice and it was so tasty! Thanks KACharles for a great recipe.

This may reflect the talent of the chef ;) but we weren't so keen on this one.  Threw in the veggies I had on hand ... it just sort of all went wrong ... I'll spare you the details!

Of the veggies all I had was canned corn. I thought the extra cornstarcy-sauciness was weird. But my husband seemed to really like it.

Just made this and it was super yummy! We just used veggies we had on hand which were peas, carrots, onion, broccoli, water chestnuts and bell peppers. We also used water and beef bouillon for the broth. We followed the recipe pretty exactly from there. It was one of the best stir fry dishes I've ever tasted at home!! I would definitely recommend it!

Soooo good!! My husband didnâ€™t want me to use our elk steak so I used the rump roast instead and doubled the other ingredients. I slow cooked the rump roast overnight first in some beef broth and then made this recipe with it the next day. Super healthy and delicious! A big hit.

Turned out great! only thing I omitted was the corn because I didn't have any. The only things I changed was using a red bell pepper in place of one of the green ones, added a fresh, chopped roma tomato instead of canned and added a few more dashes of soy sauce. The family was as pleased with the results as I was so it gets 5 stars from me!
