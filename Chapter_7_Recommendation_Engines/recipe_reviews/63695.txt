Another BBQ hit, the salad was pleasing to both eye and palette. Even the guys ate it, so that says a lot, hmm?

A nice change of pace from our regular dinner salad. I just marinated the veggies in the dressing and placed them on organic baby romaine. Didn't have enough fresh red peppers so I used the jarred roasted red peppers.

My husbands loves this, and I think it's pretty good, too.  I just mix up the "marinated" ingredients (artichokes, hearts of palm, peppers,etc) and add the dressing.  Then I keep it stored in the fridge and we just add it to our salads each night.  It keeps well - we run out of it before it goes bad.

Divine!  I love salads and am always looking for new and refreshing ways to serve them.  I didn't know anything about hearts of palm until I found this recipe and now I can't be parted with them!  This is a "must-have" twice weekly, in place of my standard dinner fare.  It's a light break from the same old grind and a real treat after a workout.

Husband and I really like this recipe.  Great flavor, nice way ti liven up a salad.  Brought rest in to work for lunch today.  Forgot the red pepper but added cucumber.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

I usually just make the marinated part plus the tomatoes, and don't serve it on the bed of lettuce.  It's fabulous.

I don't know where the South Beach people got this but they certainly did not come up with the recipe.  I have been making it for the past 12 years.  It is a wonderful recipe, nevertheless.

This is a nice change of pace from your every day salad. The marinated veggies - the hearts of palm (what?! I don't know but it's tasty) and artichoke - really give the salad a lot of flavor. The Boston lettuce (also known as butter lettuce; didn't know that!) is a a nice change from the standard romaine and iceberg. I would definitely recommend giving this one a try!
