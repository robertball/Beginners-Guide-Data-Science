The  submitter wasn't joking it's both sweet and WOW it's powerful.  Pretty good drink but the colour isn't so appealing

The color of this drink is unappetizing- it looks like murky iced tea.  That's the reason for 3 instead of 4 stars.  The taste of the drink is ok- nothing more.  It's strong because of all the booze, but the taste doesn't really warrant the cost (drunkeness or money) of the drink.  Not something I'll make again.  Thanks anyway!

I shook the alcohol and pineapple juice in a martini shaker with ice, poured it over ice and topped it off with Diet 7-Up to dilute the sweetness a little.
