I made this for the neighborhood Margarita bash on Cinco de Mayo weekend and these were a bigger hit than the frozen ones.  I substituted cognac for the brandy, and used Triple Sec instead of Cointreau.  I made about 1.5 gallons and used a glass dispenser and shook with ice and poured into rimmed cups.  It was very tasty! 
One note: I used a nice, middle of the road gold tequila, made from 100% agave (Legado). It makes the difference!

I used Herra Dura tequila and Triple Sec (since I didn't have Cointreau on hand). Tastes just like the original! Definitely 5 star
