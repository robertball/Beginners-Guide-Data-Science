This is your standard buttermilk pound cake. I used butter instead of shortening and do add two more eggs to increase the moistness. I also added 2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1 Tbsp. of real lemon juice. I served this with fresh fruit and real whipped cream.

This recipe appealed because of the buttermilk and simplicity. I did make some changes because the original recipe I found to be uninteresting and a little dry.   I subsituted 1/4 cup butter for some of the shortening and used the grated rind of 2 lemons rather than lemon flavoring.   Also I glazed it with a simple icing made from lemon juice (real) and icing sugar.

Very tasty and simple recipe to make, and I'll definitely make it again.  I included about a cup of frozen blueberries that I tossed with some flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottom and added some fresh lemon zest (about a tsp.) to the batter for a bit more lemony taste.

However, the temperature of 300° for 1 hour just didn't cut it (and my oven thermometer is working).  The cake was barely beginning to brown on top at 55 minutes and the batter was still "jiggly", so I cranked up the heat to about 350° and cooked it for another 15 minutes.  Cooled it on a wire rack for 15 minutes and then removed the sides of the tube pan.  Cooled it completely on the tube part of the pan, and then loosened the bottom and tube part with a knife and turned it over on a large round platter.

I baked this at 350 degrees (300 didn't seem hot enough) for 45-55 minutes. The outside turned nice and brown while the inside stayed soft. I changed the lemon to vanilla and upped it to 1 ts and added 1 cup chocolate chips. A very simple, light, and not really sweet cake which was a nice change. I definately want to try it the lemon way, too. I will most likely make this cake again when I have buttermilk to use up.

Delicious cake and so easy to make. I baked mine at 350 degrees for approx. 45 minutes. It came out moist. I would not change the recipe as we thought it very good. Served it with fresh strawberries and a dollop of cool whip...Although it would be great with out the additional garnishes.

i find that when a cake calls for crisco shortening in order to get a buttery taste also, then you crisco butter.it comes in sticks and should be close to the regular shortening

Very dry and "dull".  I think it would have been much better if not baked as long as the recipe called for.  Will try a different one next time.

really good taste, moist and flavorful. However, I found that it was necessary to cook at 350° F and for the full hour. Other than that a worthwhile recipe to attempt!

This is one great, easy recipe!  I followed the recipe ingredients with only one exception:  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening (butter flavored) because it just isn't pound cake without the butter.  I used this recipe to make cupcakes with what I had on hand, and they're WONDERFUL.  Not too sweet, a slight lemon-vanilla flavor (without adding any vanilla), and the perfect base for my lemon buttercream icing.  These were the hit of the cupcake table at our store's weekend sale/open house.  NOTE:  With the baking powder/soda/buttermilk combo these really rose.  Fill cupcake liners only 1/2 full for perfectly sized cupcakes.

It was OK.  The people in my family who like pound cake liked it but I thought it tasted like flour.

I loved this cake!  I had no shortening so, I used butter instead and set oven to 350.   Brought cake in to share with co-workers and they loved it!  Thanks!

Moist cake, but not something I'd make again. Flavor was kind of bland (I added some vanilla before baking) and baked cake was a little greasy, I'd imagine from the shortening in the recipe. Definitely nothing spectacular (or tangy, as the description says)

This one's a keeper. I was in a hurry, so I substituted self-rising flour, but added an extra 1/4 tsp. baking soda (because of the buttermilk). I decreased the flour by 1/4 cup and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. It was perfect!

Moist and tasty! Changes made: Used unsalted butter instead of shortening Doubled lemon extract Added lime zest (would have done lemon, but only had limes on hand!) Baked at 350 for 45 min (as suggested by another reviewer) It was delicious and moist!  My kids and hubby loved it even though it didn't have any frosting which is rare for them.  Hubby and I loved it, too!

I am a recent convert to buttermilk in baking--I got tired of throwing away buttermilk after using just one cup.  This one grabbed my attention because it only used 2 cups of sugar for the 3 cups of flour. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2  cups used whole wheat pastry flour and butter instead of shortening, as I prefer it.  I did add some spice: coriander, and mace.  This baked up light, airy, moist, and not too sweet. Made to go with some roasted rhubarb compote.  But alone this cake is delicious and I will make again.  Oh, I baked this in a 9x13 pan for 35 minutes at 350F.  Thanks everybody for your suggestions and comments. Will be doing this one again!
