Very tasty. I used butterscotch chips and white chocolate chips. I increased the amount of chips because it sounded low but I was wrong I wouldn't use any more chips than recommended next time. You can't tell by looking or by tasting that there is any oatmeal.

These cookies are great! I've made them a couple of times already. They are chewy light and delicious. The whole family loves them. Plus this recipe makes a lot of cookies. I followed the recipe just as it is printed and they turned out perfect. I only baked them till they were a very light brown.

These cookies are great they actually get 5 stars for taste but mine are a little crumbly so I only gave them 4 stars. The texture is great they are soft but have a crunch from the crispy cereal. I used 1 c chocolate chips and 1/3 c peanut butter chips. And I baked for 13-14 minutes. I will keep this recipe for a long time. And it made a large batch!

I think my expectations may have been set too high. I was really disappointed in the texture. The flavor wasn't bad but my cookies turned out really crisp. I used real butter so I don't know if that made a difference.

Love the taste and texture of these cookies. I used white chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate and they were great. I was able to make about 5 dozen good size cookies with the recipe for 3 dozen.

Iâ€™m not fond of chocolate chips, so I substituted chopped pecans! These are light and oh....so delicious!!!

Made this cookie exactly like recipe said except I used 1/2 butterscotch chip and 1/2 choc chip. They turned out really good! Only one bit of advice....cool cookie completely on cookie sheet before transferring. The first batch broke up when I tried to take them off the sheet. After letting them cool completely I had no problem with that. I think next time I will use all choc chips. The butterscotch made them very rich. Also thought of a choc. drizzle on top might be good....for you choc lovers!:) I would make these cookies again.

A really blah cookie. Too crumbly. Plain ol' chocolate chip cookies are much much better than this mess.
