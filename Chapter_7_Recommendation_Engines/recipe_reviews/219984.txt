This is a tough one to rate.  The marinade has great flavor but the cooking method is way off.  This what I would do in the future.... Heat oven to 425. Season the pork tenderloin with kosher salt and pepper.  Sear the tenderloin in a hot oven proof skillet - just a couple of minutes per side and then into the oven for about 20 minutes, until the pork is about 145 degrees - remove from oven and place on a platter, tent with foil to rest.  Mean while, heat a small amount of oil and add the garlic - cook for a minute or two and then add the remaining sauce / marinade ingredients - simmer on low heat and serve with the pork, rice and a vegetable like snap peas or green beans.   See the recommended cooking temps and times for pork.  ///Pork Tenderloin 
  (roast at 425°F.)
½–1½ lbs. 145° 20–27 minutes total time

This pork roast turned out very good.  I heavily basted the 2 1/2 lb. pork tenderloin roast and I still had left over.  I use Orange-Pineapple Marmalade instead.  I will adjust the marmalade glaze ingredients for a 1 1/2 lb. roast but still use a 2 /12 lb.  pork roast.  I will diffenently try again.

If the sauce covers the meat, the meat won't brown.

It was DELICIOUS!!  I followed the glaze ingredients exactly but I marinated it overnight. I removed the pork tenderloin from the marinade, salt & peppered it then browned   it quickly on stovetop. Roasted it in the oven without the glaze at 425 for 20 minutes. Thickened the marinade on stovetop and poured it over the roast. YUMMMMMY!!! I had to give it 4 stars only because I didn't like the method of cooking the roast without browning and wanted the marinade separate to glaze after it was cooked.

We thought this was terrific.  Moist pork!!
I braised it after reading that it doesn't brown.
We could cut the tenderloin w a fork and so moist!!
Terrific

Great recipe...However, the roast needed more time in the oven....next time I will brown the roast first.
Change 30 min covered to 40-45 min then uncovered for 10 more. To a temp 155

I made this not to long ago. I thought I had all ingredients at home however I didn’t have the orange marmalade, but I had apricot preserves so I used them as a substitute. It turned out fairly good. I will make it again using the orange marmalade.

I made this for guests the other night.  It was a huge hit with everyone.  I marinated the pork tenderloins for 2 days and then I dried them off and quickly browned them in a frying pan before putting them in the oven in the foil lined pan and poured the sauce over.  I only used 1T. of honey instead of 3 and found the seasoning was right.  With 2 more T. of honey it would have been too sweet.  My tenderloins were large, so had to cook it for 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  Will definitely make this again.  The sauce did not need any thickening and I did season the pork before putting it in the marinade.

I made the sauce according to the recipe and then I followed Baking Nana’s cooking suggestions, to a point.  I baked at 350 f. for 30 minutes and let rest, covered.   Did that because I don’t have a stove-top pan that can go into a hot oven, and couldn’t find one at the store.  Still, meat came out very nicely, and juicy!  Used the sauce as a drizzle over the plated meat.  Sauce did not smell nice to me, but tasted really good, husband thought it was a little sweet, which surprised me because he’s a major sugar hound.  But I will make this again because it is quick, easy,  and tasty.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Haven't made it yet.....but I question the "reuse" of the marinade mixture AFTER tenderloin has been marinaded.  I don't feel comfortable using same marinade.  I believe if reused, marinade should be boiled before baking with raw meat.

I used this recipe for church dinner. everybody was amazed how good it tasted. I heard no complaints. I did use apricots instead of marmalade and regular orange juice and I threw a little bit of soy sauce and marinated overnight. cooked it at 320 degrees for two hours and the convection oven. then I used drippings to make the gravy it was heavenly. I will use this recipe again

I followed this recipe but did a double recipe. The glaze did boil over but it was worth cleaning the oven.  Will definitely  make again.

While I liked the marinade, the cooking method for the roast did not work well. The roast was under cooked and did not brown well. I recommend cooking the roast at a higher temperature.
