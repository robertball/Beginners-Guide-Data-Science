This was great! I used dried pinto beans instead of black beans (since that's what I had), and we used cooked turkey I already had in the refrigerator (from the Simple Classic Roasted Turkey on AR) - I only added a little more chili powder and a dash of salt to the seasoning. We served over rice with some sprinkled Cheddar cheese on top. Made some Cornbread Made with Coconut Oil from AR to go with it, and it was a very delicious and comforting meal. (I did cut down a little on the sweeteners - I was out of molasses, so just used the TBS of maple syrup and thought that was just the right touch of sweet.)

AMAZING!

I added two small cans of tomato sauce, two tablespoons of brown sugar and doubled the molasses.
