I was surprised to find a recipe for kibbeh here... it's very similar to my recipe which is also very popular in Brazil. I finally found bulgur CAN be found here and the first thing I made was kibbeh. My recipe takes toasted pine nuts (about 1/2 cup) mixed in and you can place the whole mixture in a 9x13 baking pan (foil or glass) and bake it at 350F for 30/35 minutes. It's very popular to serve this way as well. I use to make a little vinaigrette to serve on the side: diced tomatoes, cucumbers, chopped parsley, some hot pepper drops and chopped parsley. My husband fell in love with it and the next time we'll make patties and grill the kibbeh. Thanks for posting, I'm sure everybody will enjoy this dish very much.

Hubby gives this recipe a definite 5 stars!  I finally realized why I can't get my Lebanese husband to care for any meatloaf recipes - after eating kibbeh, no meatloaf can compare!  Only addition I would make is 1/2 c. or so of pine nuts (sold in small bags in the baking aisle with other nuts).  Just isn't authentic kibbeh without the pine nuts.  (You can also use 1/2 ground turkey and/or 1/2 lean ground beef for your meat if desired; the spices make this recipe!)  Yummy!

This was AWESOME!!  I had been wanting to make kibbeh for a long time.  When I was studying in Mexico, I found that there were quite a few middle eastern restaurants, and this dish was very popular.  In the US, it seems not many people have heard of it.  I liked the fact that the mint and onion was mixed right up into the meat/bulgur mix, as I've only had it on the side before.  I made raita to eat with this b/c I thought the flavors would go well together and it was DELISH!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you so much for this recipe, it was absolutely wonderful.  I had been looking for a recipe for baked kibi (kibbeh) for a while now and this one was the closest to perfect I could find.  The only thing that i changed, and it is a personal taste thing, is added more bulgar and less meat.  Oh, one other thing, for an extra little change gently stir in some fresh toasted almond slices.  Thanks again for the great recipe!

it was perfect! I made it with low-fat minced beef and did not add any oil, baked it, and it was still really good. 

I also added more bulgur and spices (bit of cinammon, clove of garlic, ginger powder and cayenne pepper). For a dip, I mixed 1/2 cup of yogurt, 2 tbsp of tahini and 2 tbsp of water, salt and pepper. thanks for the inspiration!

Being Lebanese and this one of our national dish, we use fine burghul and we add some ground marjoram to the meat mixture.... And we serve it with youghurt mixed with chopped cucumber or green salad.

Just took this out of the oven and sampled.....it is delicious! I pressed it into a pan and baked it as instructed. It held together well. I do find the allspice a little overpowering for my taste, so I may cut it back a little bit next time.  This tastes very similar to the Kibbeh I have tasted that was made by my friend's Lebanese mother.

Easy to make and the family enjoys!  Served it with a green salad, and fried flat bread with Raita sauce, Tzatziki sauce and Hummus to choose from.  Everyone is happy!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my Lebanese paramour, who said this was the best kibbeh he had had in the states. The recipe is perfect as-is and way easy.

I made these last night and we really enjoyed them - we served them with the couscous and cucumber salad also from allrecipes, and the flavors blended really well together.  I did have to use  dried mint (@1/4 cup) instead of fresh and ground beef instead of lamb, as our supermarket didn't have either fresh mint or ground lamb available.  I'd probably use less mint next time (just personal preference), and we liked them even better when they were sprinkled with a bit of garlic salt while pan frying.  The leftovers were fabulous too, we didn't even bother heating them up, they tasted so great at room temperature and straight from the fridge.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was so good.  We had kibbeh at my husband's bosses house and we have been wanting it ever since.  This recipe was wonderful. I pressed it into a pan and baked it.  I added a half cup of toasted pine nuts.  Next time I may add more seasonings and salt.  I served it with a salad of tomato, cucumber, onion, olive oil and lemon.  Then some hummus, tzatkiki and pitta bread.

The taste was good, but I had a very hard time getting them to not fall apart while cooking. Some egg might be useful.

This is a great recipe! I subbed toasted pine nuts for the mint, and baked them in the oven, served it on pita bread with mayo, mustard, lettuce, and tomato. It tastes just like it came from a favorite local lunch spot! YUM!

Excellent recipe; this is one of my favorite ground meat dishes!  I make a double batch in a large cake pan, bake it for 35-40 mins and finish with a few minutes under the broiler.  The kibbeh freezes very well.  It's great topped with toasted pine nuts and a yogurt sauce (either raita or a quick mix of Greek yogurt, minced garlic, and dried dill).  I omit the 3 tbs olive oil - it's plenty moist and flavorful without it.  Also, I usually use a combination of meats - 1/3 lamb and 2/3 lean beef is great, and it's hard to tell the difference vs. all lamb.

I liked the recipe and my family thought it was tasty. I made it in the oven as it was one of the cooking options. I did find that it was not necessary to add the three tablespoons of oil on top as it ended up a bit to oily but overall it was a success. I did add a bit of cayenne pepper, garlic powder and cumin to the meat to add a bit more spice.

I made a half batch of this and my husband and I loved it. As per other reviewer's recommendations, I added an 1/8 cup of pine nuts to half the patties I made, and then I cooked another 1/8 cup in the pan with the lamb patties, which we put in the pitas with the patties. I am not sure which we liked more, as the toasted pine nuts added a delicious crunch, but the ones IN the patties added a unique, almost chewy texture. We served the patties in pita pockets with a little extra chopped mint, sliced tomato, tahini drizzle and a dollop of full-fat greek yogurt. Served alongside spicy chickpeas.

My family LOVES this! Sometimes I'll sneak a handful of baby spinach into the food processor with the mint, it turns the kibbeh a bit green, but you can't taste it at all, it's a great way to sneak some greens in for the family.

This was good! Not amazing...but good. I used ground beef because it's cheaper and then everything else was the same as the recipe. I think this is a good recipe, but I will definitely be experimenting with other recipes along the way.

This was so very good.  I didn’t change a thing, shaped into patties and baked them.  The flavours were exquisite!  I served them with some pita bread, hummus, tabouleh, fresh yogurt and cucumbers and a green salad.  A wonderful quick meal and so healthy!

This kibbeh came out moist and delicious. I was very happy that it was so easy to make! The only changes I made was to increase the allspice and cumin to 1 1/2 teaspoons and then I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I baked it rather than to fry it. Absolutely delicious! Thank you for posting Ron!!!

I didn't have bulgar so used couscous.  It was still very delicious.  I made a simple samosa pastry and baked them with peas.
It was a hit in my kitchen!

I have now made this recipe three times. I added some garlic, and have baked it two times. I think I prefer baked. I didn't put it in a loaf pan, instead I made traditional little football shaped patties. Delicious.

I liked this very much, however, I add in toasted, crushed pine nuts, and some raj al harout. ( middle eastern spice...yummy!)

 Also, I put only a hint of the oo on the top, otherwise it becomes too greasy.

I made this for my husband who is Lebanese and he just loves it. I use ground beef instead of lamb. We eat it with pita bread and plain yogurt. So simple yet so good.

This is the REAL DEAL!!! I did add pine nuts (1/2 cup chopped) and used half lamb half ground sirloin...just preference. It was awesome! Probably better than our favorite restaurant. This Eastern European wife made her Syrian husband very proud!!!

Good starter recipe. I added 1/2 cup of pine nuts.  In my opinion it needs to be jazzed up with more spice.  Will add extra cumin and allspice as well as cayenne and garlic as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks!

I made this a couple of weeks ago and wasn't so sure sure about it at the time. I sauteed a couple of small kibbehs in a pan. Afterwards, I baked the rest of the mixture, and put it in the freezer. Today, I decided to try a few pieces and I LOVED IT!!! In the final analysis, I think sauteeing it in the olive oil just didn't work for me. Maybe a little greasy tasting??? Anyway, two thumbs up for baking it!!!
