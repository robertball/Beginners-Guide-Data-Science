I expected more heat, the ice cream really reduced the burn factor.  I would use a third habanero next time.  My peaches were so juicy I had to adjust the cooking technique.  After the peaches were cooked I pulled then out with a slotted spoon.  I then continued to cook the syrup until it thickened.  This topping would also be very good on a cream cheese stuffed French toast. I would keep the peppers at 2 if it is not being used with ice cream. Thanks Dave for the post!

Please make this with habanero peppers and not jalapenos.  Jalapenos do not have that sneak up power that the recipe talks about. They are just dare peaches not double dare without the habaneros.  Amazing recipe!  The only tweak I would do next time would be to keep the peaches and ice cream separate on the plate so the ice cream doesn't melt and mix with the peaches.  It dulls down the kick.  Also, if serving for a big party, don't tell them that it is spicy and just watch.  Priceless!

These are incredible!  They taste EXACTLY as described.  Sweet peaches followed by the heat...ice cream required!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

such a great idea! this had my entire family going wild -- even those with the most sensitive stomachs. the flavors compliment each other so perfectly that not one overwhelms another. i would have to agree with pianobarry and say to serve the ice cream seperately, otherwise it quickly melts and takes the heat (both kinds) down a notch.

WOOOOHOO! I suspected this might be too hot for many of the people I was serving it for, but it really wasn't. Besides the ice cream that helps cool it off, the heat is just a little end note and doesn't overwhelm the peaches. I recommend making sure you don't dice the peppers too small. Maybe just chop them in quarters. The butter gets a little frothy and it can be hard to find the peppers to take them out. You wouldn't want someone to come across one on accident! YIKES! Everyone loved it. GREAT unique recipe. I'll definitely do this one again!

This is a fabulous recipe. Truly a unique taste experience. I have fixed it twice for company and everyone loved it, commenting that they'd never tasted anything quite like it.    I use habaneros from my garden to make this and it has just the right amount of heat. Habaneros have a wonderful, almost fruity (and yes, HOT!) quality and I think by substituting other types of peppers you would lose some of the sophistication of this dish.

This was delicious. I was too scared to even look at the habaneros in the store, so I used jalapenos. Someone had just given me a bunch of nectarines so I used those instead of peaches. I couldn't find a health bar or anything like that in the store, so I topped this with a little granola and some of the sauted jalapeno, diced up. A little heat, quite tasty. I'll make this again and maybe I'll get brave next time and swap out part of the jalapeno for some habanero.

This is a fantastic recipe!  You can make this as spicy or mild as you like. We love spicy so I used fresh peppers from my garden and some ground red pepper and fresh Palisade Peaches from the farmers market. Thank you SO much for this recipe!

Pretty good, would make again but would include the seeds or add more peppers cuz it wasn't very hot even by itself (and with the ice cream it was even milder).  I liked the fact that the peaches stayed relatively crunchy.

My whole family really likes this. I'm a weeny white girl and only used one habanero and it was fantastic.  Sweet soft peaches, then a little heat right in the back of the throat.  Even the kids love it, with or without ice cream.

This was fantastic! This is a new family favorite. I could see serving it with a nice cheese/cracker combo.  So delicious!  Mine could have been hotter, so I'll try letting the peppers simmer longer or buy bigger ones next time.  
I just tried it with habanero peppers, blackberries, white sugar and vanilla. It was also delicious, but be careful w/the vanilla or don't use it at all; it made the dish smell and taste a bit like a doughnut (filling).

Well, I stole my wife's ID to write this review.  She saw the recipe and we just happened to pick peaches yesterday and I had picked a couple habeneros during the week (they're not quite ripe yet).  We had stuffed bell peppers for dinner with most ingredients from the garden, then she surprised me with this.  My mouth is still tingling.  The ice cream sweet and cool with the peaches hot and spicy is a perfect combination.  Can't wait to share it with the family!

Excellent and very different. I reduced the servings to 4 so I only used 1 pepper and I subbed honey for the brown sugar. Served with frozen yogurt. Will make again...Thanks!

YUM!!!  I made this as a surprise for my hot spicy husband, and they did not disappoint!  I used habaneros from the grocery store, so probably not as spicy as fresh ones. I will double to habanero next time. Thanks for a fun exciting recipe!!

I have been making this recipe for years. My husband will talk about it for 362 days of the year after I have let him eat it over ice cream.
I have a question though. Has anyone ever made these and froze them? I want to take this to my son and his family and I thought they would travel better if they were packed into a cooler for traveling.  just don't want them to get mushy!

Perfect combination of hot and sweet.  I grow habanero peppers and didn't know what to do with the overabundance.  This was a great recipe that everyone loved.

I was expecting more heat. It's really not that hot... Just a tiny bit of heat at the end. That being said, the peaches turned out delicious and tasted so good over ice cream. I will make this again, but I think I will use more peppers next time.

I liked these peaches a lot - but it got mixed reviews from the fam. One son couldn't decide - he kinda liked it, kinda didn't. One son didn't expect the heat and despite loving hot and spicy food didn't care for it. Husband said it was good, but he probably wouldn't make it again. So - mixed bag. But, I enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe so many times in the last two years!  My husband and son love it!!  However, there are a few variables that make it a completely different experience.  First, using habanero pepper is critical.  Aside from the heat, habaneros have a different flavor from jalapeños.  Second, if you want heat, you must use fresh peppers. The first time I made this, I used habaneros straight from my garden, and the flavor and heat were  out of this world!!  Finally, the quality of the peaches makes a big difference. Blah peaches = blah outcome. I have never found a peach that compares to Colorado peaches.
