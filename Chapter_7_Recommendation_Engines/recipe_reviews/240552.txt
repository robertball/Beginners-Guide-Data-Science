Found this recipe while looking around desperately trying to find a way to use the numerous jars of applesauce we keep getting from our neighbors! Just had some of this fresh out of the oven at the time of typing this... it tastes really good when it's hot! And the recipe is adaptable too, I had to omit the coconut and walnuts due to a lack of said ingredients, and had to substitute regular milk for the buttermilk for the same reason, but it still turned out amazing. Will definitely make again.

Based on the posted picture of this cake, I thought it was exactly what I was looking for, and it was!  Nice density.  Moist. Chewy. Not too sweet. Not too cinnamon-y. Just made this on a snowy afternoon and ate it warm out of the oven.  Perfect. I did not add the powdered sugar topping since I was not looking for anything very sweet.  Good comfort food as is.

It wasn't what I was expecting. I followed the recipe and it came out dense and rather blah. I won't make it agsin.

I really liked this. I did not have walnuts or coconut, so I made it without those add ins. I did not make any other changes. This is very moist and dense. It has a very intense apple flavor that my kids did not love, however, I really liked the flavor.

Excellent recipe! Used sweetened coconut so cut down both sugars slightly but other than that made as is. Delicious!
