This is the fudge recipe that I've been using for over 20 years.  I don't add the nuts, and I don't beat it like mad, I simply stir until melted and smooth, spray pan with PAM, then chill.  Perfect every time.

I tried a few recipes before I found this one.  This is a great base recipe for perfect fudge.  This is my favorite recipe and I highly recommend this for first timers.  Don't ever use granualted sugar becauase it never turns out right if you do no matter how hard you try and believe me I tried.  Confectioners sugar is the secret ingrediant.

This is an excellent basic fudge recipe that can be added to any way you want, and makes a delicous tasting, rich fudge with a great fudge texture and color. It is also a very simple recipe. Here are a few tricks I have disocvered that help it turn out perfect every time:
butter the pan, then spray it with flour cooking spray to ensure it won't stick. Quickly stir in a half to three-quarters of a cup of caramel/chocolate mixed chips (otherwise they will melt), spread the mixture out evenly in the dish, then immediately put it in the refrigerator, uncovered for a few hours to harden.

This fudge is very easy to make - no soft ball stage - yeah! quick too - and the pot was easy to clean - what more could I want? Oh right, it tastes really good.  A keeper.

While I have a slight prefer for fudge made the traditional way, this was ready within 15 minutes or so, although it needed a little longer to set up.  My 9-year-old daughter was thrilled. 
I admit to using my immersion blender for a head start on the beating.   I wouldn't use so much salt next time, but a couple of pinches instead.  I will probably speed things a little more by melting or softening the butter first in the microwave, since that's the main hurdle to getting the mixture melted and smooth.

I actually made vanilla fudge with this by omitting the cocoa and cooking the butter first in another pan until it was amber color like in the Burnt butter frosting recipe. This gave the fudge a nice flavor.

Ok, I thought I was a pretty good cook, but this didn't turn out for me at all.  i followed the recipe except I got sweetened cocoa powder instead of unsweetened, but that is beside the point.  I cooked it as said on a double broiler until smooth then beated it.  I put it in an 8x8 pan because I dont have a 9x9.  Maybe that was the difference.  But it didnt harden up at all.  Not I have some good tasting pudding.  I may make again to see if it does the same thing.

This recipe was great and very easy to use! I used my metal KitchenAid bowl as the top part of the double boiler, and then transferred it to the stand for the mixing part. I mixed it on speed 8 for about 3 minutes--that's when it wasn't "glossy" any more. Also, I was initially hesitant about the amount of vanilla, but it was perfect. I will definitely use this recipe again!
Note: It is a very sweet fudge, which I love, but if you want more of a semisweet flavor, this recipe is not the one for you.

This recipe is fantastic! I didn't have a double boiler, but a pot worked just fine. The fudge tastes rich and chocolatey, one of the best recipes I've tried!

Love it! My husband love this so much - I've made 3 batches in 2 weeks. It is very smooth and creamy, and take no time, unlike old fashioned fudge. Plus, it keeps longer!

Crazy simple and has never failed me. I usually skip the vanilla and use almond/coffee, or occasionally rum, instead. If it's not setting up for you, you've not cooked it long enough.

An excellent smooth, rich fudge.  You must beat it for several minutes.  I forgot to time it, but I'm sure I beat it for at least 20 minutes.  YUM!

This is a very quick and easy fudge recipe.  I don't own a traditional double boiler but put a large pot on the bottom with water and placed the smaller pot on top. It worked fine.  The fudge tasted great and the kids loved it.  It is a small recipe so if you are looking to make it for a croud you will need to double it.

My old fudge recipe is good, but this one is my favorite. The fudge is easy to make and easier to clean up. I use the boiling water from the double boiler to clean the fudge pot and through it into the dish washer. Before I would have to scrub for fifteen minutes and end up with a fudge that sometimes wouldn't set. So happy with this recipe:-)

I use my rice cooker as a double boiler. I altered the recipe (no nuts) to one stick of butter (8 TB instead of 6 TB), with about 1/3 C of Evaporated Milk, and 1 TB of Pure Vanilla Extract. I let that cook until the butter was completely melted. Then added about 3/4 C cocoa powder, stirred it well. Then added 4 heaping cups of powdered sugar, one cup at a time, stirring for about 10 seconds. 

I then let the entire mixture cook in the steamer (sealed) for about 5 minutes until the consistency looked smooth.


I then put it in a glass bowl with a lid and set it in the freezer. I've found that letting it sit in the fridge for a few days improves the taste and texture, as more of the milk evaporates.

I made this tonight. It's good for what it is. I've been making the old-fashioned fudge with the candy thermometer for years and I was looking for short shortcut to that process. This is not it. There is not much of a chocolate taste to this fudge, just sweetness. When looking at this recipe, it seemed like way too much sugar for the amount of cocoa, but I followed it exactly. I am thinking about melting this fudge and adding another 1/2 cup of cocoa. Regular fudge has 2/3 cup. I didn't have an issue it setting, not sure why others have had that problem.
 Update : So this is the next day and I did melt my fudge and added 1 1/2 cups of extra cocoa to this recipe to get the taste right for me. I added a little milk to help with the melting process. It took longer to set, so I put it in the refrigerator and went to bed. The next day I took it out and let it come to room temperature. It's fine. It is still not the taste of the regular cooked with a thermometer fudge Dymista making, but the taste is much better.

Even when refrigerated this fudge is still much softer than most. If left on the counter it will never set. Once set it must remain refrigerated or it will pretty much melt before you ever cut it.

This is the first time ever making fudge. This recipe sounded simple and it was, but im not sure what i did wrong because after over 2 hours in the fridge I still had something that tasted like fudge but was more like thick frosting

I just made this and it turned out like chocolate sauce even after 24 hours in the fridge. What did I do wrong. Think I followed the recipe just fine.

I think I used the wrong kind of sugar. Mine turned out very gritty and I could never get the gloss to go away. I haven't tried it again with confectioners sugar but it seems to me that would make it really sweet. I would like a recipe that you can taste more of the cocoa in. I love dark chocolate and it seems that would be better.
