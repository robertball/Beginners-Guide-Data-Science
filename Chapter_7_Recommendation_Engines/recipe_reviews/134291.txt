Excellent, but I made several adjustments. First, I rubbed the chops down with olive oil prior to placing it in the flour mixture and I used kosher salt throughout the recipe. Secondly, I added shallots while searing the pork and added chopped apple when it was time to simmer. The apples and shallots really made the sauce. Lastly, I had no cream on hand so I used 1% milk and the sauce was amazing and still very rich. I think cream would of been too heavy. Served with mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce. Fantastic!

Very, very good.  Apple and pork is one of my favorite flavor combinations.  For me the apple flavor was a little too subtle and I added some unsweetened applesauce which perked the flavor up tremendously.  Also, for me, I would probably next time add some finely diced shallots.  I can see the sauce  being served just about anywhere fine food is made even without my tinkering :)

I thought this was excellent! The pork chops were moist and full of flavor. The smell of the apple cider while it was cooking was wonderful. The sauce came out perfect. I used light cream, but I think I may omit this next time. It was just a little on the rich side for me.

I made this last night, and it was pretty yummy.  I changed it up a bit and followed some other reviews.  I added some applesauce and used apple juice (no cider on hand) and added some cinnamon.  I also marinated the pork before I cooked it, with vinegar, salt, pepper, and garlic.  I think next time I will leave out the breading part, as it just made a mess in the sauce for me.  I also added some diced apples to the pan before I cooked the chops.  Then removed them and added them back in when I added the cream.  Overall I think this was a awesome recipe, simple and didn't take all night to prepare.  I will try this with chicken as well.

I changed the recipe to  give it more flavor.
I doubled the nutmeg, instead of using 1 cup of apple juice I used 1/2 cup apple juice, and 1/2 cup apple cider vinagar.

I also crushed 2 small apples and simmered with the chicken, and left them in the pan after removing the chicken for the gravy.

 I added some brown sugar to taste in the cream sauce.

This recipe turned out great! The pork chops were nice and moist, not tough.  Let me mention one thing I used applesauce instead of apple cider (didn't have cider) it "melted down" perfectly.  I also swirled some real maple syrup into the sauce and it added a really nice flavor!

This was delicious and a nice change. I did not have the allspice so I left that out as well as the chicken broth. I also added some sliced onion to the pan when searing the chops, leaving them in and incoporating them into the sauce, I also used 2% lactose free milk instead of the cream and it still made a nice gravy. I thought the apple cider taste would be strong but it was nice and light.

I tried this tonight and it turned out very well. The pork was definitely very tender, and I tend to sometimes dry out pork w/o meaning to. I also used 1/2 apple juice and 1/2 apple vinegar, like another suggested, (no apple cider on hand) and I would recommend this, as it adds a tartness, however, I would only add less than 1/3 cup vinegar and over 2/3 cup apple juice, and then do add brown sugar to the cream sauce at end. I also added the shallots when I seared the chops. My Dad was over for dinner and he is a very good cook - he really liked it. Thanks!

Very easy to make and delicious with or w/out the sauce. I didn't have allspice so I used approx. 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch or two of ground cloves.

I hate to change recipes but had no cream so used milk as suggested. Also used whole wheat flour since that's what I usually use in recipes. We thought it was moist, tender and excellent flavor thanks to the cider, allspice and nutmeg. The sauce also complimented the baked sweet potato and I thought that rosemary made the perfect garnish since our veggie was a salad on the side. Gotta get that color on the plate! I took the 1st photo posted of this dish.

Tweaked it - No Apple cider, so I did 7 ozs. Apple Juice and 1 oz. Cider Vinegar, also added a finely chopped apple at the same time the cider went into the pan. I only had a Pork Tenderloin handy instead of chops, and cut it in half, then lengthwise, into four even-sized pieces; Pork came out tender and moist - made my day. My wife commented that "people usually try to make their sauce smooth but you deliberately made yours lumpy! (with the finely chopped apple)."  I would make this again in a heartbeat.

I liked the idea of this recipe but I hated it.  Too vinegary.  I think if I was to make this again I would use applesauce.

This is the third time I've made it, and it always turns out delicious. To those who are considering trying this: the low votes are all because they used apple cider VINEGAR, not apple cider. That's like complaining it tastes bad after using wine vinegar when it calls for wine.

Apple cider is not apple cider vinegar, folks.

This was good, but my wife and myself found the cup of apple vinegar to be a bit overwhelming. 

Next time, I would use just 1/4 cup and increase the chicken brought or even use white wine.

Also, I had some dried cranberries which I added, which gave it a nice touch.

Very good but the sauce is too thick.  It needs only 1tbsp of starch or perhaps more apple juice for a bit more sauce.

This was good, with the potential to be great...but I found it a little bland.  I skipped the coating on the meat as some reviewers suggested, and substituted apple juice and sauce for the cider.  It ended up being a little bland.  That being said I will be experimenting with this one again in the furture.

My husband almost fell over; this was so good! I didn't have apple cider but had frozen concentrate, so I used 2 tbsp of it. I added cider vinegar as well. I also added apples and onions with the porkchops. Today I'm using hard cider, a bit of apple sauce, and apple cider vinegar with 1/2 & 1/2 for the cream sauce. Great over mashed potatoes!

Excellent!  I actually marinated the porkchops for a day in apple cider for extra taste.  Also, after adding the cider to the porkchops to boil I used two apples (cut into cubes) and a handful of baking raisins.

I really enjoyed the sauce on the dish, the pork however, not so much. I don't understand the point of breading the pork then simmering it in sauce. It just makes it soggy.  I will use the idea for chicken breast minus the breading next time.  Really good served with fresh steamed green beans and baked yams.

Great recipe that makes for some really juicy and flavorful porkchops. I prepared mashed potatoes to go with this and the apple cream sauce was a great compliment.

Fantastic!  This dish was great; my husband really appreciated it after a long day at work.  I didn't have any apple cider, so I used half apple cider vinegar and half apple sauce and it was nice and tangy.  I also added some onions while the pork was browning as some other reviewers suggested.

Not impressed w/ this. Followed the recipe exactly. The vinegar was very powerful, was almost all you could taste. Tried lots of recipes on this site, this was the first time something did not taste good.

These were very bland. They were okay, but I certainly won't rush to make them again.

With the potential for being 5 star.  I read some of the reviews and I added cider vinegar, onions, and used applesauce instead of apple cider (as I didn't have any cider or apple juice). I also added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice instead of the pinch as suggested. I sliced and cooked 3 Granny Smith apples in butter and added that to the dish.   I thought there was way too much sauce and I'm going to half the sauce ingredients the next time.

This is sooooo delicious! I cut the chops in half because they were very thick to reduce cooking time. I simmered for only 10 mins. I used 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar (it’s all I had). I also used a tablespoon of arrowroot starch instead of cornstarch and low-fat milk instead of cream. The gravy was perfect!

I mis- read the ingredients and bought apple cider vinegar instead of just the cider.
Had some pear cinnamon juice from Trader Joes and used that instead. Added some apple brandy I had in the house.
Used çhicken bone broth instead of broth.
The sauce was very tasty!
Next time will have the cider and add sliced sauteed apples and shallots as others described.
Not the lowest fat recipe, but relatively quick and easy! One pot.

Made this with chicken breasts and it was an awesome dinner.  Only change I made was to use water instead of chicken broth (didn't have any broth on hand).  Hubby is already asking when I can make again.

After making this dish I had to say I myself and other people who tried it for the first time LOVED it. Thank you for bringing this recipe on here and no I didn't modified or changed any part of this recipe.   ;)

Very nice change, sauce was nice and creamy and apple goes great with pork. Went nicely with new potatoes and green beans.  I did add a little applesauce for more apple flavour, don't make the mistake one reviewer made who said it was too vinegary....I think she used apple cider vinegar instead of apple-cider juice.

Delicious. Substituted a pinch of cinnamon for the allspice, and used just under 1/2 cup of frozen apple juice in place of the cider. Not too sweet, good consistency.

Served with lightly sautéed broccoli and roasted baby red potatoes. I would definitely go with mashed potatoes next time as someone suggested, but that's just a preference thing.

Overall an easy and flavorful weeknight recipe. This will become one of our staples.

Was a great meal. Used some of the  previous  comments. Rubbed meat with a little olive oil prior to the flour. Doubled dried spices didn't  have  fresh  on hand. Simmered with sliced onion and cranraisins. Added  a little brown sugar & maple syrup. Used a blend of 1% milk & half & half. Be careful not to overcook the meat. Served with  mashed & a mixed vegetable. Ate every  bit. Husband  was pleased  with  the  taste and commented  several time on the sauce. Will definitely make and share this one.

I tried this with chicken this evening. I followed someone else's suggestion to go without the breading and added a little apple sauce to the mix.  This wasn't bad, it just wasn't very exciting.  I kept thinking that it needed "something" - just couldn't figure out what would make it taste better.  Not likely to make this one again.
To the person who said this was to vinegary - the recipe calls for apple cider, not apple cider vinegar!

Fantastic! I made the recipe as written (a rarity for me) and was not disappointed. Even my husband who isn't a pork fan enjoyed it.

I made a slightly different version tonight. I coated the pork chops in an Italian bread crumb mix and I used apple juice instead of cider. (I was out of cider & didn't feel like running to the store). It was quite delicious. Even my picky toddler ate all of his meat.
