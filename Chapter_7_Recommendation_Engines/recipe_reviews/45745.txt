I got this off of a recipe card in the mail from Great American Recipes.  There's an ingredient missing that might make a difference - 2 tsp. of baking powder that needs to be added to the flour mixture.  This can be baked in a 9x13 pan at 350 for 45 to 50 minutes.

My mom has made this simple, wonderful recipe for years!  She calls it "Cherry Squares."  Her recipe calls for 1 Tbl. lemon juice, but other than that, this recipe is the same.  Mark the batter into 24 squares, and a good rule of thumb is to add about 3 cherries per square.  I sometimes make this with blueberry pie filling instead of cherry.  I love this recipe because if you have drop-in company, you can whip it up in no time, and I usually have the ingredients on hand already.  In fact, I keep a can of cherry pie filling on the shelf just in case I need to make this.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this all the time.  Very easy.  I also like it with blueberries instead of cherries.

Good cake.  A little bit misleading on the name as it's not 'glazed' with cherries.  Cherry pie filling is deposited by the spoonful in a grid pattern. I made it in two 8x8 pans.  Rose nicely, nice crumb, and is good to serve at any time.  I'm taking it to a meeting today for a Valentine treat.  I might drizzle it with a light icing next time.

Very good! I adapted the recipe by putting raisins, and pink food colouring, and cherry pieces in! Thanks

Easy!  Served cold from the fridge on a hot day for a bbq holiday get together.  Made 1/2 with cherry pie filling, the other 1/2 with blueberry for red, white, and blue dessert.
