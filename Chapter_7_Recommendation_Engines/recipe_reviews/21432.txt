I've made these several times now with a few changes:  I use cheddar/Jack cheeses instead of processed, and I double the hot sauce (Tapatio) and omit the seasoning salt; I also leave out the eggs, as they just don't seem necessary.  What I want to point out is that this can really be a one-dish meal.  It's not necessary to cook everything atop the stove and then transfer to a baking dish for the oven.  I simply throw all the ingredients together in a baking dish, then toss it in the oven.  After about half an hour, I stir well, then let it go for another half hour or so.  The grits are cooked to perfection, and I just made a very easy, quick meal!  My family loves it, so on occasion, I throw it together for dinner.  The ease of it all makes me happy, and they're happy 'cause they like it so much!

Great recipe! This is one where you can cut back on the sodium and calories without really missing them. In keeping with the way I grew up eating grits (as a foil for richer foods) I omitted the seasoned salt and used half the cheese (sharp cheddar instead of processed to keep the flavor) and reduced the butter to 1/4 cup.

This recipe is our family's favorite cheese grits recipe. Fluffy and wonderful! Only use 1/2 tsp of salt though. Last year we (30 of us) did a side by side comparison at Easter with the original recipe and a reduced fat version. I used this recipe and made it with half the amount of butter and light processed cheese and everyone liked the lower fat version better than the original. Just an option. It is also wonderful made with grated sharp cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese.  Great recipe Mollie!

YEEEHAWWWWWWWW! A while back, my husband spent some time in the south (helping clean up after Hurricane Katrina). While he was there he called me and told me that he, and the rest of the crew, had gone to Lulu's Diner (don't quote me on the name of the diner because the memory is not great here) in Baton Rouge Louisiana and he had had "THE BEST GRITS" he's ever had in his "ENTIRE LIFE". As you've probably guessed, my huband is "a grits man". Anyway, to make a long story short I felt it was my duty to "one up" Lulu's. So, I printed out this recipe and made it for my husband upon his return home. BAM! These are now "THE BEST GRITS MY HUSBAND HAS EVER HAD IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE". Try them! They are FAB. Bake them if you must but we just eat them right out of the pan.

I cooked this recipe for a bridesmaids' brunch. We were preparing for over 20 people so I doubled the recipe. Per previous reviews I reduced the amount of butter-in fact I used "I Can't Believe It's Butter" to reduce fat content. I used  less process cheese per other reviews and used Light Velveeta.  I did not add hot sauce because my friend does not like spicy.  I omitted the additional salt per other reviews. I cooked the grits in a pot on the stove and then mixed in all additional ingredients. I tempered the eggs (mixed some of hot grits into beaten eggs) before adding to the entire mix so as not to have scrambled eggs! Per another reviewer I baked in the removable crock pottery for a little less than an hour til top was golden.  Then transported in crock pot to destination and kept on warm setting. It was a hit! So if you need to take this dish to another location using a crock pot is the perfect solution. Lots of compliments. Thanks for the recipe and all the wonderful review suggestions!!

I made these using some of the hints from previous reveiwers.  I used 1/2 stick butter instead of 3/4 and 1 tsp. less of salt.  My husband really liked them but all I could taste was the Worcestershire sauce.  He wants me to make them with some bacon next time.

Made this recipe this morning for a brunch at work.  It was easy to put together and it was baking while I got ready for work.

Everyone who had some loved them. The stoneware part of my crock pot comes out, so to make sure they would be hot for the brunch, I cooked them in the stoneware part of my crockpot in the oven, then put the stoneware in the warming part, took the whole thing to work, plugged it in and put on keep warm setting.

This is a VERY RICH recipe. Don't even want to add up the fat grams, but was very good.  I'll definitely make this again.  Next time, I'll use light Velveta and a low fat margarine.  Thank you Mollie.

Very good! Since it was just me and my husband, I scaled this for 6--used a 7 x 10 inch baking dish and it was just right. I also only cooked it about 40 minutes and it was lightly browned and creamy. I will be making this often,especially in the colder months! Thanks, Mollie, for this great recipe!

My husband thinks these are the best grits ever. I've made them 3 times now, once for a church dinner where they were devoured. Serve it as a side dish as a delicious alternate for potatoes. This recipe is a winner and one I will make again & again. Thanks Mollie!

Made this as an "experiment" along with other usual brunch fare. Turned out to be the hit of the meal, everyone loved it! Its fun when that happens and you discover a new favorite to add to your collection. None of my guests had ever tied grits or even thought they ever would. This is delicious,really flavorful, the texture is appealing and it looks good. Also, it does not take an hour to make like the recipe says. Its very simple, maybe 25 minutes. It does have a lot of calories but for special occasions, so what!!

Hey... this was a great recipe for grits!  The prep time is actually only about 20 minutes, not 1 hour as listed in the recipe (it's usually the other way around!).  

The grits were light and delicious... Next time I am going to reduce the amount of butter used to 1/4 cup to reduce calories and keep the grits from having too much of a buttery flavor.

This recipe makes for a great base for Shrimp and Grits!

Very tasty! Next time, I'll cut back on the Worcestershire sauce. It became too dominating.

Really very good! I too am something of a purist when it comes to grits, so I didn't use seasoned salt, but garlic powder instead. I wish I hadn't added the Worcestershire. Next time I'll go without. I also didn't need the entire block of Velveeta; it was plenty cheesy with about 3/4 of it. The consistency was nice and creamy; the taste was great. I was able to mix it the night before, and pop it in the oven on Christmas morning.

This is fantastic!  Very delicious!  I followed the recipe, except instead of using 1 pound of gross processed cheese,  I used 8oz of sharp cheddar cheese.  I also didn't add any of the seasoned salt or salt.  Next time, I would double the Worcestershire and the hot sauce.  Would definately make again!

This has been a huge hit each and every time I make it. The only change is the cheese. I use shredded cheddar instead of processed. Thank you.

I make this every year at Xmas -- a tradition in this Northern home !  I usually use the Microwave directions for the grits .. and use a large 8 cup pyrex dish.   You can mix it all together in the pyrex dish before transferring to baking dish. I always use bagged shredded sharp cheddar instead of processed.  And I use garlic salt not seasoned salt. Delicious !

I made these for a breakfast pitchin for work.  They were very good.  I used 8oz shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 8 slices of processed american cheese.  For the salt, I used 2 tsp garlic salt and 1 tsp regular salt.  I left out the worcestershire sauce.  I baked them in my slow cooker crock, then plugged it in when I got to work to keep them warm.  It worked great!  I will make these again.

My go-to grits recipe! It’s more like a grits soufflé! Just make sure to use the casserole size recommended or else it gets too much butter on the top when it cooks. Even great the next day! We use it like a polenta the next day - great with carne asata or a pulled beef or pork recipe!

This recipe changed my entire family's opinon of grits!! I made a couple of minor changes. I only use 2 TBSP v. 3/4 c. of butter and reduce the table salt back to 1 TBSP. I have a batch in the oven right now...it has become our Saturday morning staple. :)

Great recipe! I scaled the serving size down to 6 for just my husband & I and baked in an 8x10 dish for 40 minutes. Perfect! My husband ate almost the entire dish. I would substitute another kind of cheese just b/c I am not a fan of the velveeta cheese, so I think I will cut the amount of cheese in half next time. Thanks!

I'm a Southern Girl and grew up eating grits.  I was really excited to experiment with a new method of preparing them.  Well, I was disappointed in the results of this recipe.  It's not that they were "bad", they were just too "different", than what I'm used to.  They were too fluffy and too light.  It's my own personal preference.  I prefer grits that "stick to your ribs".  I will continue to prepare grits the good old fashioned way: grits, butter, cheese and milk---cooked in a pot on top of the stove.

I made this for a family get together brunch and it went over well. Even my boyfriend who claims doesn't like grits enjoyed this! I would make it again! Thanks for sharing!

I love baked cheese grits, and this is a fantastic recipe.  My mom used to make these all the time, and since she passed away, I have been sad that I never paid more attention -- they were made so often and I helped her so often that I thought I "knew."  At any rate, I read the recipe and immediately recognized it!  I, unfortunately had been forgetting the eggs.   At any rate, I followed the recipe to the "t" and it was perfect.  They should be a little salty and decadent, because its not an everyday dish.  Its a Sunday morning brunch type thing. 

I am so thankful that I found this recipe, and that I could recreate a bit of home.  I'm originally from Oklahoma and thought it was great they were named "Oklahoma Cheese Grits."

I'm an Alabama native, so I've had my fair share of grits in my life.  This was by far the most flavorful grits recipe I've ever had.  My fiance RAVED over this dish.  He loved it!!!  I thought it was good as well, but I found it to be a bit salty.  I kept taking a bite of my scrambled eggs with it to cut the salt flavor down a bit, which tasted awesome.  I think I would decrease the regular salt by half if I make it again.  It's a strange "breakfast" flavor, and I was originally concerned that the worcestershire/hot sauce flavor wouldn't go well with bacon and eggs, but it seemed to taste just fine.  FYI, I followed the recipe exactly, but took the recommendation of practically every reviewer to use cheddar cheese instead of processed.  I would definitely make this dish again (in fact, I think I have to for my fiance's sake...haha)

Wonderful recipe! Scaled down to a third and the two of us practically polished it off . Served along with Charleston Shrimp 'n' Gravy recipe also from this website. Yummy! (Used cheddar instead)

A modified version of this recipe is one of our family's must-have dishes for any holiday meal.  We use 1/2 cup butter, 1 tsp. of seasoning salt (omitting the remaining salt) and 1 clove of minced garlic.  I've also had good results making a "lighter" version by using 2% Velveeta, Smart Balance instead of butter, and 4 beaten egg whites instead of the whole eggs.

My family has made this recipe many times and it always turns out fabulous. I have even served it to friends who don't like grits or have never eaten them before, and they all loved it. 

I always use extra sharp cheddar cheese, and add a bit more tobasco sauce than is called for :)

Amazing!  I served these New Year's Day with a breakfast casserole and monkey bread.  It makes a ton, but most had more than one serving.  I used the Kraft brand of processed cheese, since it temds to be a bit less salty.  Not sure if it was necessary, but these were absolutely DIVINE!  I hate leftovers and just had the last bite 4 days later.  The might stick to the ribs a bit, but I will add to a traditions list for my family.

These are great!  I was a little skeptical before I baked them, because it just tasted like Velveeta with a little grits mixed in.  The eggs and baking really help to blend all the flavors.  They were a hit at the baby shower I attended yesterday and my husband has already finished off the leftovers.
One change I made- the recipe calls for a lot of salt, so I cut both the seasoning salt and the plain salt in half.  It was just the right amount.

This was waaaay better than I expected it to be. I was just looking for something easy with a minimum of ingredients, but it turned out great. I halved the recipe, so I used a 7x11 dish and it only needed about 50 minutes to bake. I only had polenta (corn grits), so I cooked that according to directions, which took about 30 minutes. I used a mix of sharp cheddar and monteray jack. I did only seasoning salt-- no additional salt. We ate half of it one night, and then the next night, I warmed the rest up with a drained can of black beans mixed in. I will definitely make this again. It's a little time intensive, but it's easy.

This was wonderful. I used approximately one pound (two huge handfuls) of Colby Jack instead of processed cheese and it turned out great.  My husband requested less cheese and maybe an additional egg next time, but I think this dish is great as written. Thank you.

This is awesome - soo cheesy and fluffy, as promised!!!  The eggs are really a great trick.  Make sure to stir the grits as you are cooking them, otherwise you could end up with big lumps of it.  Also, as much as I love butter, I don't think you really need all 3/4 cups of it as not all of it even mixes in.  I would cut it down to 1/2 a cup max.  I used Franks Red Hot (1 tsp) and it didn't do anything.  I would either increase the the amount of hot sauce or use a hotter hot sauce.  I needed an extra 20 minutes to cook this, to get the brown crust.  I didn't use the extra 2 tsp of salt, as the nutritional value lists 1146 mg sodium PER serving!!!!!  I didn't think it needed it.  Great side dish!!!

I made this to serve as a gluten-free menu item at a bridal shower and everyone thought it was great!  Even those who weren't allergic to gluten!  This is a great brunch recipe.  Maybe next time I'll add chunks of ham or sausage, just for a kick.

I am not Southern and I did not come to appreciate the taste of grits until recently.  I LOVED these grits! I had some girlfriends over the night I tried this recipe.  I served this with collard greens and cornbread.  Several of the girls said they thought it was macaroni & cheese.  When they found it was grits, they were initially disappointed until they tasted them.  The grits got very good reviews.  There was one purist among the group that said grits should not be a casserole, but other than her, they were a hit.

I also had them for leftovers the next day.  I heated them in the microwave and added a pat of butter on top. WOW.

According to reviews' suggestions, I used one tablespoon of wocestershire sauce and two teaspoons hot sauce.  I also used 8oz Cheddar, 8 oz Velveta.

I used quick grits, but I could've cooked the grits until they were ALL THE WAY DONE, which for me is more than 5-6 minutes.  

Great recipe! Could be used for brunch or dinner. Instead of standing over my grits, I socialized. Thanks.

Excellent.  I had several variations including:  low sodium chicken broth instead of water, low sodium low fat Cheese Whiz instead of Velvetta, omitted the worchestire (as recommended by reviewers), used half the butter (as recommended by reviewers) and substituted chopped canned chilis for hot sauce.  I also added absolutely no salt.  The Cheese Whiz and broth add plenty. Northerns who had never considered grits are now believers.

These were sooooooo good.  It was my first time to make grits and I definitely was not disappointed!  The only problem I had was getting the cheese to melt.  I was in a time crunch, so I didn't let it melt all the way through.  They still tasted awesome and it was a nice little treat when you got a blob of cheese!

I have to admit that I never have rated anything on here and that is going to change because of this recipe! My husband begs for these now (after making fun of me for cooking grits in the oven). A true southern boy now loves grits made by his Yankee wife :)

This is a great recipe. I wish I had read some reviews first because I thought it was too salty, and I didn't even add all the regular salt that it suggested. In my efforts to be healthier, I used half the amount of butter and 2% grated sharp cheddar cheese. It was great if you can get past the saltiness!

Too much butter, salt, and cheese.  I also was not crazy about the worchestershire sauce taste.  I prefer stovetop grits with a little butter, cheese (not processed), and hot sauce.  However, I did enjoy the texture provided by the egg.

Way too salty for my family's taste.  I would suggest cutting the salt in half.  Either use all of the seasoned salt and no regular salt, or half of each.  We couldn't eat it and I love cheese grits.

This is a great recipe!  I only made 1/2 the amount, and omitted the seasoning salt, but I served it to friends from the South and they loved it - apparently, they never had baked grits before.  I was even asked when I was going to be making it again!  This one is a keeper.

No one in my family could even eat this and we all love grits.  The best cheese grits ever--The Flying Biscuit in Atlanta.  Look for their recipe if you want good cheese grits.

I love baked grits (especially with seafood), but I did make a few changes to this, based on how I remember my Mamaw making them.  I used milk instead of water, bringing it right under a boil.  Also, I used Cobly and Pepper Jack for the cheeses instead of processed.  With thosee changes this is just like Mamaw used to make (possibly better-I don't remember her using worsteshire)

Mmm... these really satisfied a cheesy craving. Plus, I had everything on hand w/o going to the store- double plus!  I scaled this down to just two servings (since I was just making it for me) and it came out perfectly when baked in a small pyrex. I also subbed garlic salt and used reduced fat velveeta. Delicious!

I had never made Cheese Grits before, I made this for a group of 50 people for a brunch and got rave reviews.  I made too much so we reheat them and ate them with dinner also.  Picky teenagers even loved them. This recipe is wonderful.

I am not a grits eater, but thought I would make this for my fiance' since he likes them.  I tried these and I fell in love.  He couldn't believe I made them. I definitely recommend this recipe! I can't wait to make them for his mother!

These grits are soooo GOOD!  Made these as a side dish with dinner tonight and everyone just loved them.  They were so fluffy and creamy and had such a terrific flavor.  We used processed garlic cheese instead of regular Velveeta.  The only changes I might make next time (and there will definately be a next time!!)is to add some tasso for a bit of smoky flavor and perhaps more pepper for added spiciness.  This was easy to prepare and 60 minutes seemed to be the exact baking time needed. This recipe is a keeper!

These grits tasted excellent!  Served them for breakfast on Easter weekend and the whole family loved them!  The hot sauce adds great flavor - NOT spicy heat, so don't be put off by this ingredient.  As mentioned in other reviews I would also decrease the amount of salt and butter next time.  I was a bit surprised that they were on the thin side, especially with the eggs, and I even used 1 additional egg. Also the top was a light brown after only 50 minutes but all ovens vary.

These grits are awesome.  However, they were WAY too salty.  I would not use the 2 tsp. of salt as the recipe requires.  My whole family liked them, but could not eat much of it because they were too salty.

Made this for a church brunch.  Good, but the worces sauce was a bit overpowering.  I will use a little less if I make it again.

The first time I made it just as stated.  Great!  Rich, smooth and lots of flavor.  It is a good basic recipe to tweak to your taste.  Leave out the cheese and the grits are a flavorful, creamy base for shrimp n grits. :)

Caveat: Neither I or my better half are grits fans but we loved it. Tweaks we made: We cut the recipe in half for two people. Keeping in mind we cut the recipe in half, we used 1 teaspoon of season salt but replaced the 1 teaspoon of salt with 1 teaspoon of season salt. Next time, I would reduce the 2 teaspoons of season salt to 1.25 or 1.5 teaspoons of season salt and just leave out the salt. We also added 1 cup of diced ham to our "half" batch and used just 2 eggs. Finally, I baked it in an 8x8 pyrex dish in my oven using convection mode at 375 for 50 minutes. On my convection oven reduces the temp approx. 25 degrees... that's why I bumped it up. Finally next time instead of using the 8x8 for the half batch, I will use a 9x13 so the finished product is thinner and hopefully a little firmer.

It was delicious, however the carb count has to be wrong. 1/4 cup of grits has 29 carbs so 1 1/2  cups has 174 carbs divided by 12 servings is 14.5 carbs .

The grits being baked had a solid quality. I prefer the grits to be more of the consistency of cream of wheat cereal. The taste was good.

This recipe is awesome. The only thing I did different is mix in a cup of mixture with my eggs and then folded them in.  My husband and family loves it. I serve with bacon wrapped shrimp or chicken makes a wonderful combo.

I made this recipe for staff meeting at work. They were a big hit. One co-worker (who is from the south) said they were the best cheese grits she had ever had. I used 1 tablespoon of hot sauce and a pinch of dried garlic. Keeper!

Great recipe, but four stars because to me they are not true southern grits.

The taste was good, but I had a huge problem with the amount of water to grits ratio.  I followed the recipe and even after baking the grits were soup consistency.  I had some instant packages of grits that I added to firm them up (I had to add 4 individual packages)  Then I had to compensate by adding some more of the spices to balance it out.  The end result still tasted great, but I definatly will use less water next time (or) different type of grits.

WOW! My husband didn't know what to think of the flavor, he said they were good though. The rest of the family LOVED it! It is a taste like I have never had. I couldn't bring myself to put that much butter, I only used 3/4 stick. That's all I changed though. Great recipe....baked grits...what a concept here in SC!

EXCELLENT recipe and will definitely be making again. I gave this 4 stars only because I made a few changes, not that they are necessary.  I used cheddar instead of American as that is our preference.  Also left out the eggs and did not bake them.  Served them right from the pan and they were fabulous.  My husband is from GA and loves cheese grits.  I have spent the last 20 years seaching for the perfect recipe and finally, by George I think I have it!

I have made this recipe several times, and it always gets rave reviews!  I do make the following changes: reduce butter to 1/4 cup, and use 2 cups shredded cheddar or cobly-jack cheese in place of the processed cheese.

So yummy!  My husband, who had never had grits before, thought it was awesome.  Though he thought it would make a good side dish for a dinner instead of breakfast.  I say whatever, it's good anytime!

Absolutely delicious! I also reduced the amount of butter and it didn't seem to need any more.
Like a previous review said, I used it as a base for shrimp over grits (or sausage over grits, or chicken over grits). Everyone in my family loves it, including my 16 month old! Thank you so much for this recipe.

These were awesome! I followed the recipe, and my husband and I loved them. I tasted the grits too before adding the eggs to bake, and they tasted great then too. Next time I'm in a hurry, I may just serve the grits without the eggs to avoid baking-- either way, they taste fantastic.

Never having grits before I thought I'd try this at Easter. The outcome was everyone liked them, but I thought they would be better served right from the pot without baking. More like polenta. I threw the leftovers out.

These were excellent and very well recieved.  I reduced the butter to 1/4 and they were still very rich and buttery.  Very easy to make, but also very unhealthy, so I would make this dish just every now and again.  It was perfect for our Christmas brunch.

My husband loves grits and these are his favorite.  The last time I made them, I didn't add any eggs and just served them hot off the stove - without baking.  I also always add garlic and extra hot sauce or use spicy cheese whiz.  EXCELLENT!!!

Great dish even for those who say they'd never eat grits. That's probably because the dish looks a lot like a cheese souffle. It's a stick-to-your-ribs comfort food.  The dish is inexpensive, easy to prepare, and quick to bake.  Like other reviewers, I cut back on the butter and salt a bit.

I tried this recipe yesterday for company and everyone loved them.  The unusual seasonings add so much to the dish, but they are not over-powering.  The texture is creamy and smooth.  We are from the South and very picky about our grits, this is a sure winner!  Thanks for sharing.

These grits are AWESOME!  I served these today at a brunch I hosted, and everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.  I did take the advice of others about the salt.  I added all of the seasoning salt becuase I love it's taste and then slowly added the regular salt tasting as I added.  I ended up adding 2/3 teaspoon of salt and it was perfect.  I highly recommend these grits!

YUMMMMM!  Best grits I've ever had and SO easy.  Made them for a family celebration yesterday.  To save on fat I used low fat Velveeta and low fat margarine.  Even my grits-hating father liked them.  The grits are not gritty at all--nice and smooth--and they are a bit fluffy.  I'll definitely make these again!

This was my first time making grits - they were amazing! Made exactly like the recipe except I used shredded cheese instead of processed. Everyone at my dinner party loved them too.

JUST the grits recipe I was looking for! I especially appreciate the suggestions made to simply combine everything in a baking dish, throw it in the oven, stir it up after cooking a half hour and then finishing it in the oven for another 30 min. It came out great! Also I did agree with the changes to cut out the seasoning salt and eggs altogether and cut the butter back to a 1/4 cup....it STILL tasted fantastic! Also I chose to do a mix of 2/3 pepper jack cheese to 1/3 processed cheese. DELISH!

I've made this many times and at the request of friends who love it!  I use Lawry's seasoning for the seasoning salt and sometimes use the mexican processed cheese for a little more kick (depending on the audience).  This is a can't -go-wrong recipe!

This recipe is very tasty! It reminded me a lot of my grandma’s cheesy grits, which I grew up eating. My hubby was leery of trying it, but loved it and went back for 2 more helpings. I definitely recommend!

Love it!  Even my husband liked it, and he won't eat grits.
I used half cream cheese and half mild cheddar cheese.  No additional salt, half the Worcestershire and hot sauce and one egg.  Turned out very creamy.

I personally have never had any grits before and didn't know what to expect.  My husband has tried some grits at some restaurants but they were all more dense.  I made with Cabbot 75% chadder cheese and light butter to cut down some of calories.  My whole family LOVED this dish!  I bet the original loaded version would be very rich and yummy (if you can afford the calories ;)

I just made this scaled down to four for my small family in an 8X8 pan using several reviewers' suggestions. I omitted seasoning salt (didn't have it), used cheddar cheese (it's what I had), omitted Worcestershire sauce cause I was making this for breakfast, added some precooked sausage (to use it up), and most importantly, followed Brandy Lee's suggestion to just dump all the ingredients in without precooking the grits. That was a huge time saver. Also, I didn't even realize it when I was eating them that I'd completely forgotten to add the butter! Oops! We didn't miss it at all, so I guess those who want to save calories could leave it out. I might add a little the next time I make them just for curiosity and comparison, but these were great without it.

I am from the South so anything with Grits is my very favorite. You can do so much with Grits - from the Cheese Grits or add fresh Shrimp for additional flavor. I do not use processed cheese, but use both grated Sharp and Mild Cheese. Have tried other additions and options with ham or bacon. Everything with Grits is my Soul Food.

Great basic recipe. Made some changes...used 8 ounce block of extra sharp cheddar, grated myself (do not use preshreded cheese in package, they put cornstarch in it so it won't clump & it does not melt as well)Omitted seasoning salt and used garlic salt and Tony's Creole seasoning. Omited hot sauce and used sirachi sauce instead & only used 3 T. butter. Wonderful ! Sprinkle chopped green onions on top for a change.

Wow, these are really good! I even cheated and used lighter margarine and reduced fat cheese, and they were still really good. Mine fell a bit after baking but it's possible that I overbaked them slightly, and they were still amazing. Not something we could eat every day, but delicious once in a while! Thanks so much!

"This is AMAZING", is how my hubby described it!  The only change I made is deleting the salt. There is already salt in the cheese & seasoning salt, so after making it a 2nd time, taste is a lot better.

This Yankee FINALLY realized why all the fuss over grits... I used the real thing instead of instant grits.  (cooked ratio of 1:3 grits to water for about 15 -20 minutes.)  This is the only time I've ever liked grits.

WOW!! I made this for Christmas morning and it was a hit! This is seriously the best grits I've made! The Worcestershire and Velvetta really make this dish!  I 1/2 the recipe and it called for 1 1/2 eggs, I used 1 egg and milk to make it a little more creamy so I didn't have to waste an egg or worry that it would be too eggy. Otherwise I followed the recipe with the exception of the hot sauce (I didn't have any). I used Tony C's for the seasoned salt to give it a kick to make up for the lack of hot sauce! No one in my house found it too salty. I have always been partial to another grit recipe but now this will be my go to recipe! Thanks  :)

Good grits. Love the creamy texture from the cheese, and the thickness from the eggs. The worcestershire sauce had me worried, but the flavor mellows out in the final product.

These are really good--I'd cut down a bit on the water when cooking the grits because they almost broke.  And, a stick of butter is plenty!

A new family favorite. The only change I made was to use extra sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta.  Great with BBQ pork and even better as leftovers with breakfast the next day.

I cut the salts down to 1 tsp each, used velveeta, and next time I think I would try it without the eggs and worcestershire. But even though I would make these changes I still think this is a really good recipe.

How can you go wrong with those ingredients?!! Perfect!  I cooked on the stove top, and dumped on the pan to cook in the oven later and everythign came out perfect.  I added paprika on top, and will cut the butter way down next time. Thanks for sharing.

I thought these were fantastic! I did cut the butter and cheese by less than half and used two eggs. YUM!

These are pretty good, but they just don't quite stack up to the Georgia cheese grits I've grown up eating.

REALLY GOOD RECIPE. WHILE I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT OKLAHOMA'S THE SOUTH IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM, (I LIVED THERE FOR A FEW YEARS & GRITS ARENT' AVAILABLE THE WAY THEY ARE IN THE SOUTH) THIS IS A REALLY GOOD RECIPE. GOOD CHEESY FLAVOR.

It is very possible that I did something wrong, however, I followed this recipe to the best of my ability and followed other reviews by adding garlic and cutting salt in half and it turned out really bad. It was super salty and runny.  Not even my husband or teenage boys would eat it.  I will continue my quest for that perfect grit recipe.

Made these for a New Year's Brunch, everyone was scared to eat them because of all the unhealthy stuff in them, but they all ended up trying them and raving about how good these grits really are.

I was looking for a good side dish for christmas dinner for the family. Went out and bought the the exact ingredients and went to town. Took this to the dinner table and everybody took a spoonfull. Not one person liked it, the response from everybody was "Its Ok". So I decided to try it and didnt like it either. Ended up throwing away the whole dish. It is ok, but definately not something to bragg about.

Great casserole!  Made it for a brunch and everyone wanted the recipe! My crockpot version omits eggs; add 1 lb browned sausage, 2 Tbsp honey, always real butter, shredded cheddar instead of processed block cheese and worschershire black pepper!! Awesome!

I am just 'discovering' grits and had them recently while on vacation. I came home and wanted to try this recipe. These grits came out wonderful. I scaled the recipe down to serve 6, only added 1 tsp of seasoning salt and left the regular salt out. I also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and used 1/2 pound of american cheese slices as that is all I had on hand. They were so good. Thanks for this recipe. It will be made often!

This recipe was fabulous.  I didn't add the 2 tsp salt, the seasoning salt was enough.  I also used shredded cojack instead of the processed cheese.  Even my picky 7 year old ate some and didn't say gross!  Definitely a keeper.

Very good.  Not at all spicy as you might think the hot sauce would make it.  I think the hot sauce just flavors it up a bit. 
My only complaint is that it came out a bit soupy in the center. Maybe I should have boiled the grits a bit more. I also used a smaller pan. So, that could have been the reason.

Very good recipe. I substituted garlic salt for the seasoning salt because I do not use msg. I also left out the regular salt and added extra tabasco.

We are right here in the middle (3 stars) on this one. I guess if you are an extreme cheese lover this one is for you! I did omit the salt and it was still salty. I didn't use a whole lb. of cheese either and it was way cheesy. I used sharp cheddar and maybe that was the problem all together, I am not sure.

I made this for a house full of twenty-something year old guys to go with a pork roast and what they didn't eat at dinner, they finished off the next morning at breakfast.  I made the recipe as directed, but feel as some other reviewers, that next time (and there will definitely be many more times) I make it, I will reduce the salt by a half.  You can always add more during the meal.  This is a great recipe and would easily taste good with ham, pork, or chicken.  Can be eaten as a brunch dish, a breakfast dish or a dinner dish.

This was a pleasant change of pace.  I grew up in the South, therefore, have eaten a lot of grits in my earlier days but not this way, usually butter and sugar added.  After reading the reviews I didn't add the 2 teaspoons of regular salt and the seasoned salt seemed to be plenty for us.  Thanks Mollie!

My family really enjoyed this recipie -- we had it along with egg strata and fruit salad for Christmas morning brunch.  The only thing I'll change next time I make it is to add more hot sauce.  It was a little bland for my taste but I love my food spicy.  Overall, great recipe -- I will make it again!

After 42 years of being a "grit eater" these are the absolute best I have ever had!  Just had my third bowl for the day and the longer they sit the better they are.  Even my wife (the grit hater)has eaten two bowls.  Thanks Mollie

Thank you all for the wonderful reviews !! :o)
The prep time IS shorter than the recipe states.....I would rather it be "long" on time, as to "short".
Also, this grits recipe can be frozen, but should be baked first. They won't be as fluffy, but yummy none the less!
Thanks for the great reviews !!
Mollie :o)

I thought this would be a nice change of pace, and it was.  It was different but not outstanding.  My husband thought it was "okay."
