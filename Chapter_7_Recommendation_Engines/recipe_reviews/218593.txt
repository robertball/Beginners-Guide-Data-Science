This is great with basically kind of greens!  I like to mix spinach at the last minute just to wilt it with the sturdier other greens.  Even my three uear old g'daughter loves it!

I've had pasta and Swiss chard before, but until now have only mixed it together on my plate, not as a dish of its own! This is pleasant, homey comfort food. Simple and satisfying.  I had the capers out and ready to go but forgot to add them. Enjoyed this just the same.

Really simple and delicious. I have a lot of chard in the backyard and I wish I had used two bunches!  Added a few more garlic cloves.  Loved the lemon- not overpowering like I thought it would.

Delish!! I've been making this dish for 30 years!! I saute chopped onion 'till carmelized first, then add crushed red pepper flakes and extra garlic and the swiss chard. I also add a few dashes of soy sauce to the finished dish. Great made with any shape of pasta.

A good basic idea, but very bland.  It needed a lot of help to make it palatable.  I added more garlic and just a dash of cayenne.

this was pretty good.  I followed the recipe except for the fact that I didn't have any olive oil so I sauted the swiss chard in bacon grease, and I added about 6 tablespoons of butter to the final mix.  I really enjoyed it, but my husband who has never eaten capers before said "this smells funny" and wouldn't eat it. :-)

I can't believe so few people have tried this! I doubled the recipe, and I used spinach instead of chard. I also added a bit of the juice from the jar of capers. It was very, very good.

My husband and I ate the whole thing (our toddler ate a little, too)! Will make this again, since we often have a lot of spinach.

Very flavorful and satisfying for such a quick recipe with so few ingredients.  Added a little extra grated pram to the plates.

I loved this so much that I make it at least once a week now.  I add more capers because I simply like more.  My boyfriend ate it the first time, but didn't like it and hasn't had a single bite since.  That's fine with me...more for me.

Just made this for lunch with rainbow chard... we didn't have capers so I used pine nuts instead. My 14 year old daughter was complaining when she saw what I was making... but she loved it and had seconds!

I had some late-season swiss chard to use up from my garden and stumbled across this recipe.  I was actually not expecting much, but it was a new way to use some ingredients up.  I was shocked at how delicious and flavorful this recipe was!  I did listen to one of the other reviewers and added an extra clove of garlic and made sure to season well with salt and pepper. I am not at all a fan of whole-wheat pasta, so I used a specialty pasta that was flavored with lemon and chive.   Next time I may add clams or shrimp, but it was extremely delicious without those additions!

Great use of chard (and a good change up from the traditional saute with adding capers). Pretty easy to make with minimal prep which makes it a good week night dinner.

A great use for garden Swiss chard - I had also made a "Quick & Easy" Alfredo sauce, so rather than have 2 sauces I mixed them - delicious!

I used elbow pasta because I needed to use up extra cooked pasta from the fridge. I wish there was some sort of a crunch element to the texture - maybe I'll try it with pine nuts next time, but overall, quite tasty.

I eliminated the addition of salt, and added some sliced Kalamata olives, & also increased the amount of garlic, capers, Parmesan cheese & lemon juice.  I topped the dish off with shifanoted Italian parsley.  (My rating reflects the changes which I made.  Otherwise, I would have given it 3*s.)

Perfect as written.  I can see using this same basic recipe with any tender green.   My only change was to use bow tie pasta.

i guessed at the amounts because I harvested the chard from my garden and since I do not like capers so I left them out but otherwise it was the same and it was so good. My husband and I really loved it. Couldn't quit eating.

Very hearty side dish. Plain, simple way to use chard from the garden. I used whole wheat penne, subbed minced red bell pepper for capers (didn't have any) and omitted lemon juice. Will definitely make again!

It was okay.  I doubled the amount of garlic in it and it still wasn't garlicky enough for my taste.  I used about 11 oz. of chard, based on what google told me a "bunch" was.  This was my first time cooking with chard.  While it was easy enough, I don't know if it will become a regular in my veggie rotation.

I love greens and this recipe hit the spot! For more flavor, add some lemon zest to the Swiss chard when it's cooking. I didn't add onion because that make it too sweet, but one can never put too much garlic!

I used this recipe as a base, it seemed kind of boring with just the chard. I sauted an onion before adding the chard. I also added some fresh green beans to the pasta while it was cooking and diced ham when I combined everything. It was pretty good, next time I'll make more of a sauce for it. Spinach would also work great in it.

Wonderful. We made it with 4 leaves of rainbow chard, a handful of spinach and no capers (forgot to buy them). Very yummy.

Loved the flavor. Threw in extra capers, extra lemon juice and sweet red peppers.

Very good - even my little guy ate it!  It was a little bland without the optional lemon juice and cheese.  We added some crushed red pepper.

Loved this! Only gave four stars as I didn't have capers so can't give it five. Will be making this when I want something a little different.
