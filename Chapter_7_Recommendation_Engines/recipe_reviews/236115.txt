As written you end up with far too much waste. My chicken came in a 4 pound package, I only used 2 eggs,  and I still ended up with half of the egg/water/hot sauce  mix leftover. If you only plan on frying the wings and not coating them in sauce in the end then by all means use the hot sauce in the egg wash and the garlic powder. If you are going to coat them in hot sauce and butter in the end then I recommend leaving the hot sauce and garlic powder out on the first steps.  They completely get lost.  The hot pepper sauce has plenty of salt so there is no need to add any additional. On that note, I recommend using unsalted butter as well. These turned out really good but it was the hot pepper sauce and butter combo that made them shine so save yourself some money by eliminating some of the unnecessary ingredients.

I had 20 wing portions, I live on a farm and have fresh eggs,  I used one large egg & one small egg. I mixed it with a little milk instead of water & the red hot regular sauce not wings sauce. Dipped in egg mixture then dredged in flour w salt & garlic pepper & 1 cup of regular  bread crumbs for additional crunch. Deep fried 4 at a time in oil at ~375 for 8 minutes (these were large wings). I drained them & when all were deep fried & drained I covered them w the additional red hot sauce. 

I been making different varieties of wings for 25 years & my husband said these were the BEST. Awesome for Superbowl sunday.

The one thing I disagree with is putting them in a bowl lined with a paper towel. They should be placed on a rack. I use an oven rack that I place over a section of my kitchen sink. That way the excess oil will drip off. Putting them all together in a bowl will make them soggy.

Great method! It can take a lil' time to butcher the wings to your preference, but it is worth it. The flavor balance of the butter & the hot sauce (I use Frank's wing sauce) was divine!! And a FAB texture on the wings post cook!

A tip: do NOT let the wings sit in the flour. I forgot to pull them out & they got a tad clunky. Also, I set some of the wings aside & tossed them w/ lemon pepper instead  of buffalo sauce since my daughter isn't into the buffalo flavor.

Loved this recipe! I used barbecue sauce instead of hot sauce because my mother does not like spicy foods.  The butter in the sauce gave it an amazing taste!  Very easy and fast to make.  Thank you for the recipe!
