7.6.19  I took a crepe course a number of years ago, I’ve tried quite a few crepe recipes since then, and never have I seen one where the flour and milk are equal.  Typically, you let the crepe batter rest for 20 minutes.  This recipe doesn’t instruct you to do so, but I did.  Crepe batter needs to be fairly thin, and I found this batter just too thick.  I added a little milk to thin it down a bit, but still wanted to stay true to the recipe as written.  The recipe doesn’t even tell you what size pan to use, even an approximate size.  But 2 tablespoons of this batter wasn’t enough to cover even a 6” skillet. The standard measurement for recipes that I’ve made is about 1/4 cup of batter.   I threw away the first two crepes, added more batter, but still less than a quarter cup, and at least I had enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan.  I could taste no chocolate, and the texture of the crepe, unfortunately, was rubbery.  Also, equal amounts of sour cream and cream cheese didn’t work for us, as the sour cream just dominated, waaaaay too tangy for a sweet crepe.  Sorry for the less than favorable first review but,  honestly, this recipe was a big disappointment.  And that comment is not meant to discourage others from trying, since we all have different tastes.  It just didn’t work for me.
