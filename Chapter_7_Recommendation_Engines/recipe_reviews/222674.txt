It is pretty sweet, not enough spice.  But, it comes together well.  Don't trust how it looks before you put in the plum sauce, it turns out darned tasty!

I didnt use chili pepper because I dont like hot spice and thought that the 1 1/2 cups of plum sauce would be too much so I halved it with mango chiptole salad dressing (also calorie wise) and tasted good. Also added some shrimp.

I used my homemade plum sauce which is spicier and less sweet than the store bought version.  We enjoyed the sauce over the chicken, mango, and bell peppers, but overall found the dish lacking in depth and texture.

Nice start but way too sweet. I added some cayenne to spice it up. Also, I did not need nearly as much plum sauce as the recipe called for.. I used half of one small jar..
