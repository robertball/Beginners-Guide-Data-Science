I've made these over and over again, but I always add 2 cups of chopped apple pie filling.  They always turn out great, and my soldiers all love them (they do excellently in the mail).  Very chewy, but you have to keep an eye on them...don't over cook!

The granola idea is good, makes it chewy. Cut the salt by more than half. It turned out really salty.  Very easy to make.

Although I didn't have apple-cinnamon flavored granola, I had plain granola, and it turned out great! I used margarine instead of shortening.  I added a handful of chocolate chips to half the batter, and left the other half plain (my husband doesn't like chocolate chips) and we both loved these cookies.   Great for extra granola!

Really great and chewy, ideal recipe if you have some cheap Gramola.

Should be eaten with a few days for best results.

I made this twice.  The cookies spread out so much that I thought I must have used too much shortening the first time.  I was wrong!  I followed the recipe to the 'T', measuring exactly.  The second batch was worse than the first. I even tried lowering the temp, after the first dozen came out so thin, but this didn't help at all.

I hate oatmeal cookies, but I thought these were so yummy.  My fiance says these are his new favorite cookies and askes me to make them every weekend.  They are really easy and quick to make. I suggest cutting the time to 7-8 min.

This was a fairly good recipe. Relatively easy to make, tasted good. It wasn't outstanding enough for me to give it 5 stars, but it was still good.

Like other reviewers I had a hard time making these rise. Added the step of chilling cookie dough prior to baking to help rise but they cooked flat and hardened. Taste was not exceptional,  though maybe granola at fault. Will not attempt again

I didn't have granola so substituted 1 cup oatmeal, 2 tbsp coconut, 2 tbsp sesame seeds, 2 tbsp linseeds, 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, dash allspice, cloves and thai chili and grated 3 large macintosh apples. Instead of white sugar I added a tsp of stevia. Didn't add salt, and added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder. The dough was runny so I added a bit more oats and flour until the dough was the consistency of cookie dough (drier). Baked 8 minutes (any more was too long). Came out as a chewy cookie with good form. I could have added more spice and a pinch of salt. Would make again!

These ended up paper thin and overcooked. Still have a decent taste.

I also attempted these twice with pretty poor results. There must be a cooking tip somewhere not listed here that helps with making these cookies. I made sure to remove the cookies from the hot baking sheet immediately onto a cooling rack, but the first batch resulted in sheet-like (but edible) cookies, while I lowered the temperature and cooking time for the second batch and watched them bake. They didn't rise and became a giant sheet of chewy, greasy brittle. Glad I tried as I made the apple cinnamon granola myself and the leftover granola was a huge hit with my roommates, but I don't think I will attempt these cookies again.
