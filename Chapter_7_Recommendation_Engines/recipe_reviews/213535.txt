I didn't think it was that great. I didn't think the dijon mustard worked at all. (And I enjoy dijon mustard!) I would not make this again

This was very good!  Substitued one giant, sliced portobella mushroom as that was what I had in stock.  It added a hearty flavor.  With savory, it needed the usual garlic and also added  parsley, chicken broth and a touch of white wine.  Will definately make again.

Great recipe, our preference would be to make a double batch of sauce.

I thought this was really good!  I think one key part is using organic chicken breasts ( they actually have flavor!).  Having only Cream of Chicken, this is what I used.  I over cooked the broccoli, but other than that, it was really good.  I might actually add more mustard next time!  Since we avoid excess salt, I didn't add any, but I could see some needing that extra oomph.  I'll be making this again really soon, and this time I will plan ahead and have plenty for leftovers!

Dijon took over the flavor too much, so I had split reactions to this dish.
