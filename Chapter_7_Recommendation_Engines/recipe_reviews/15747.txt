Oh my GAAAAWWWDDDD!  This was the BEST bread EVER!  Here are the changes I made:

* 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar

* add 1 tsp. vanilla

* add 1 tsp. cinnamon

* substitute apple sauce for the oil

* cooked in a Pampered Chef mini loaf stone pan (4 small loaves)

* sprinkled Ghiardelli chocolate cooking chips (60% cocoa) on top

* cooked for 57 minutes

* I used 3 overly ripe bananas, which was more than 1 cup

It is so out of this world...chewy on the outside and moist and dense on the inside...but not overly sweet.  I ate a whole mini loaf steaming right of the oven, b/c I couldn't stop.  I'm going to go into a banana bread coma!

Delicioso!

This is wonderful. Yogurt works as well as buttermilk. I also accidentally found out that if you use vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk, applesauce instead of oil, and cut out the sugar, it's a pretty good low fat, low sugar treat. Better if it sits for a day so the natural sugars can absorb. I've tweaked this recipe a lot and no matter how I make it it's wonderful! Thanks, Rose!

Thanks, Rose, for a wonderful recipe.  I have made this bread several times and it is definitely a favorite.  For a simple topping, mix together 2 TBLS. each finely chopped nuts and granulated sugar with 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a generous dash of nutmeg.  Sprinkle on batter before baking and press lightly with the back of a spoon.  This topping gives the bread a sweet crunch ~ delicious!!  Thanks, again, for sharing!!!!!!!

This is definitely THE BEST banana bread I've ever come across- but I swear I've made it even better.  Try this-
Take 4 oz. of room temp cream cheese, beat it together with 3T milk until smooth.  Add 1 cup of powdered sugar and 1/2 t. vanilla and mix until incorporated.  Drizzle this over your banana bread when it's done, take a bite and you will swear you've died and gone to heaven.

This banana bread lives up to its name as "best banana bread".  It freezes perfectly and tasted just as good a week later as when I had just baked it.  When I greased the loaf pan, I dusted the pan with sugar.  This gave it a crunchy crust with a moist interior.  Try this recipe!  You won't be disappointed!

Wow!  The title of the recipe couldn't be more fitting!  This stuff is the best.  I love banana bread and this one was very moist and oh so good. I used 3 overly ripe bananas that I mashed up so it was a little over 1 cup.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I left out the nuts, but next time I might add in some walnuts. I sprayed my glass pan with Pam for baking (a life saver) and baked it at 350 for a little over an hour.  It smelled incredible and tasted even better - great recipe!

Okay, I've made lots of Banana Bread.  This may satisy the palate of one who is used to eating out and eating processed foods, but if you are a down-to-earth, cook-everything-from-scratch kind of person, this recipe is not for you.  Too sweet, crisp sides (due to the high level of sugar), and not a real banana flavor. It didn't peak and crest, but remained kind of flat (I'm guessing from the lower heating 325 for 1 and 1/2 hour instead of the standard 350 for 1 hour).  It has taught me a lesson though . . .to stick with what works!

This is an exccellent banana bread recipe.  Most recipes I've tried turn out being dry or rather "blah".  I gave this recipe 5 stars (despite some substitutions I made) because of the moistness and great flavor.  I used vanilla yogurt rather than butt4rmilk, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, an extra 1/2 cup of mashed banana (I had 4 banans that were beginning to look like a scienc project), an extra 1/4 of flour, and a heaping 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I'm not telling my mom, but this recipe is better than hers.  I will definitely be making banana bread more often now!!

This is a great recipe!  To make it even better use brown sugar instead of white sugar, whipping cream instead of buttermilk and a bit of vanilla.  Perfect!

Best recipe I have tried.  I prefer the mini loafs and they only take 45 - 50 mins.

My kids are just getting over some tummy trouble and I wanted to make them a special treat.  I did alter this quite a bit because it's such a good base for banana bread.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and added about half a can of pumpkin and some spices...cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  I also added a big spoonful of sour cream and decreased the sugar to about 3/4 of a cup.  I added a splash of vanilla extract to the egg mixture.  I baked these in miniature muffin tins and got about 48 mini banana muffins. You wouldn't believe how moist these came out. My kiddos would definitely prefer this over a "loaf". Thanks so much Rose.

The name says it all. This is literally the best banana bread I have ever had. I was kind of discouraged by all the people who have reviewed this since it seems like almost everyone drastically changed the recipe. I made this bread exactly how the recipe says to and it is perfect. I also tried it with chocolate chips and it was amazing!

My husband took one bite of this banana bread and said, "This is the one, don't ever try another recipe."  That was encouraging!  When I took my first bite, it brought back the memories of my mom's recipe, which I have been trying to find for years!  Living in China and not having access to buttermilk, I remembered that my mom would put vinegar into milk for her recipe and wondered if THAT could be the buttermilk.  What WOULD we do without the internet??? YES!  For THIS recipe, add 1 teaspoon of vinegar to 1/3 cup of milk and let it stand for 5 minutes.  Voila!  The buttermilk! (For 1 cup of buttermilk, add 1 Tablespoon vinegar to a cup and fill to the top with milk and let stand for 5 minutes.) Thank you SO much for this wonderful recipe!  It is a huge hit and disappears almost as fast as I can bake it!

Excellent!!!  Easy and soooo delicious!  "The best Banana Bread I have ever made" was what my husband said after eating almost half the loaf!
Definitely will be making again.

Wow this was good!  I've tried multiple banana breads from this site and they all lacked 'something'.  THIS one worked.  Trying to make it healthier I replaced the 1/3 cup buttermilk with vanilla yogurt, the 1/2 cup vegetable oil was replaced with applesauce, I didn't measure the bananas I just used 3.5 (the other .5 went in my belly), and I reduced the sugar to 1.25 cups, oh and I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour and upped the pecans to 1 cups.  Ok wow...guess I changed this recipe a TON lol.  It's very moist and you can NOT tell these are a tad healthier. nom nom nom________________Just for the halibut I made this recipe again using the above changes AND as written and then I had 4 people blind taste test.  ALL of them picked the healthier version as the better tasting one (including myself)....no kidding.  I was shocked :)
Another update:  I used the recipe (subbing the yogurt and applesauce) and instead of bananas I used shredded zucchini.  IT WORKS for zucchini bread too.  I tossed in about a cup of chocolate chips (I do that sometimes with the banana too) and the zucchini bread was fabulous!

I have made this recipe several times and finally took the time to give it 5 stars.  Last night I doubled it and made one loaf and 12 muffins.  The muffins took about 30 minutes to cook.  This IS the Best Banana bread.  As with all, the riper the bananas, the better the flavor.  The ones I used last night were black-skinned, and I think it came out the best yet.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This is definately the best banana bread I have ever had. It is moist! I don't use butter milk, because I never have it on hand, regular milk works just fine. I also like to make a little more healthy by using 1/2 whole wheat flour and half white flour. I almost always just add 3 bananas- it is more than 1 cup- but is really yummy. Also I only use 1 cup of sugar.  This time I used brown sugar- if you use the brown, be sure to mix it in with the bananas. If you try to mix it with the flour the sugar stays clumpy- I know because I tried that the first time!  I have made this banana bread many times and it always comes out good, even with all of my tweaking of the recipe.

I am saying this is an excellent banana bread even tho I had to make one change - too sweet, but again that is a matter of taste (and health).  Perfectly moist and no problem making it less sweet.   I would not change anything else and staill rate a recipe because it isn 't fair to the contributor or others.  Thanks for adding something else that is great to my recipe files.  Did I say that it is probably the easiest banana bread - well it is!!!!!!

Shut the door good!!!  Added applesauce no oil or butter.  Added cinnamon, nutmeg and good slug of vanilla extract.  Moist, delicious and GONE in one day....and I made two loaves!  Added pecans to one loaf...didn't get to try it because it was gone so fast!  I'm throwing my other BB recipes out...this one nails it!  Also added 3/4 cup brown suar replacing 1/2 the white sugar.

I have been making this for years. I still have the original recipe I clipped from Bon Appetit magazine 25+ years ago. There are a few slight differences from the original recipe which calls for 2 bananas, 1/4 cup plus one tablespoon buttermilk, 1 cup chopped walnuts and 1 teaspoon vanilla. This is indeed the best banana bread recipe ever. I have shared it with many people. No need to look further.

Absolutely delicious and EASY to make.  I swapped out 1/4 cup of the sugar for brown sugar. I made 4 mini loaves (I think the small loaves cook better), and I coated the greased loaf pans with sugar for an extra sweet crunch on the outside.

This is awesome banana bread.  I make a double batch and bake it in a 9 x 13 pan.  After it's out of the pan, I cut it in half and freeze half of it.  If I didn't, we'd eat the whole thing in about 2 days and there's only 3 of us!

This is really good. I found it a little more firm and dry than I like, but it was perfect for heating a slice in the microwave and slathering it with butter. I added 1 tsp. vanilla and topped it with a streusel topping: 1/4 cup cold butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, and 1 tsp. cinnamon.

Good and easy to put together.  I have made this so many times.  As my banana's become too ripe, I peel them and put them in zip lock baggie in freezer to use for this recipe.

This recipe is great the way it is, especially if you like sweet banana bread.  I wanted to use less sugar so I cut it down to 3/4 cup and it's still plenty sweet.  I usually don't have buttermilk on hand, so I just add about 1/2 tsp of vinegar to regular milk which is a substitute for the buttermilk.  I am a 'nut' person and used 1-2 cups of walnuts-I don't even chop them, the more the better.  So good, moist and flavorful.  Keeps well too.

Nothing compares to this banana bread!  It's so moist and the kids love it.  I added some cinnamin chips into the batter and it was good that way too!

WOWZERS!!  This was AMAZING!  I made it in muffin form (made 17, baked for 26 minutes) and topped with the cream cheese glaze suggested by another reviewer (4oz cream cheese, 3Tbs of milk, 1c confectioners sugar and 1/2tsp vanilla--top when muffins are still hot) that really took it over the top!  Now I did tweak a bit (I know, I know) but had to take out all of the oil.  I replaced with 1/2c applesauce, 1tbs of oil and upped the buttermilk to 1/2c.  I also used a scant 1c white sugar and a scant 1/2c brown sugar, then added 1Tsp vanilla and 1Tsp cinnamon--also suggested by other reviewers.  These are seriously the best banana anything I have ever had....num num num!!

I bake for some of the most finicky folk on the planet, one of whom turns up her nose if a baked good contains cinnamon or "too much" vanilla! Another won't eat anything that is "too sweet." Two will not eat nuts. (I know... but they're a pretty good bunch otherwise!)This bread is so moist and flavorful that ALL of them were impressed and have requested it! Once I did not have buttermilk so I used fat-free vanilla yoghurt ( 1 to 1 substitution) and that tasted great too. When I make it for my house I use the pecans and add 1Tbs Penzey's "cake spice" which gives a warmer flavor. In short, this IS the best banana bread recipe I've ever come across in its origional form and with minor alterations made for necessity or personal preference.

Suggestion: Add thin slices of banana to the top before baking for extra caramelised banana flavor and a great look! Wonderfully light textured, flavourful and lightly moist. I put in a teaspoon of baking powder plus 1/2 tsp of baking soda as I didn't want to taste any soda. I added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon powder and half a cup of chopped walnuts. I used half cup of raw sugar + 1 tbs brown sugar and semi-melted butter.

Yes, it is the best ever banana bread.  I had a ton of overripe bananas so I decided to test this recipe against Banana Banana Bread on this site.  This was hands down the winner.  Lighter, easier to slice, prettier, sweeter and more balanced.  Plus, I love that it uses oil and the other recipe was a bit overwhelmed by the butter.  My only modification was to leave out the pecans to compare the two more fairly.

A definite 5 stars! The title "Best Ever Banana Bread, fits this recipe to a "T". It is moist and delicious! I had a little over a cup of ripe bananas that I mashed up. I also added a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the batter and mixed everything. I sprayed my 9x5 glass pan with Pam, poured the batter in and baked it at 350 for an hour and 5 minutes. The aroma smelled just incredible -filling up my house with a wonderful "banana-y" scent! The bread rose up nicely and produced a nice even brown color. It is moist, flavorful and delicious!  The buttermilk and oil obviously contributes to the moistness of the bread. Not only is this filled with great flavor but it's nicely dense on the inside. The "banana" taste is pronounced in the bread and is not overly sweet! I also like the crunch of the pecans, which is a nice change from the usual walnuts in banana bread.

I'm not a huge sugar fan, so I find using about 1/2 to 3/4 of the sugar, and adding a little extra banana makes the bread a little more moist, and no one ever guesses it's missing any sugar. Also, I never have buttermilk, so I use skim milk, take out a tablespoon and add a tablespoon of white vinegar and let it sit for a few minutes. Works great.

I made this to bring along on our "Girls Weekend in the Wisconsin Dells".  Well we (the three of us) pretty much ate the entire loaf Saturday morning.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer & sprinkled the pan w\ sugar (& cinnamon too).  The crust was a bit moist, but as it sat out it hardened up (which we all liked), the inside was incredibly moist.  Thanks Rose.

This is one of my favorite Banana Bread recipes.  I like others that use sour cream or plain yogurt, but I don't always have that on hand, so I always pull this out of my recipe book when I've got over ripe bananas in my fruit bowl.  I now substitute the whole amount of oil with 1/2 cup applesauce, and reduce the amount of sugar to 1 cup.  It's not as fluffy as it would be with the oil, but it tastes SOOOOOO good and makes me feel better about eating 2 slices at a time knowing I reduced the fat/sugar considerably. :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

Truly the Best Ever Banana Bread!  I doubled the amount of mashed bananas becuase I had ripened bananas that needed to be used. I also sprinkled sugar and cinnamon over top of the batter before baking...this made sort of a crunchy cinnamon topping when it was done. Took the bread to a party and served it with homemade honey butter (real butter mixed with honey - whipped until smooth).  The combination of the bread and the honey butter was a huge hit!  It was one of the first things to disappear.  Yummy! Definitely a keeper.

Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!! This is officially my go to banana bread recipe! I didn't have buttermilk so I created my own buttermilk. I mixed the 2% milk I had in the fridge and mixed it with a bit of white vinegar and let it sit for 5 minutes to create my own buttermilk. I was worried about using low fat milk to create the buttermilk, but it turned out very tasty:)

Since finding this recipe I have made this bread at least 25 times. I love it. The key for me was cooking it at 350 and not 325. I read in another review to substitute brown sugar for part of the white sugar and it adds great flavor. Also, I used vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk, and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup. Turns out perfect everytime.

Absolutely the BEST banana bread I have ever made!  I've tried several different banana loaf recipes over the years, but this one beats them all.  This bread is moist and fluffy - not heavy and dry like so many others I have made.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe, as it simply delicious and perfect as is.  This is the recipe I am going to use for all my banana loaves from now on.

Great recipe and you can mix it up a bit.  I make muffins and use some form of applesauce or baby food instead of the vegetable oil.  I also added a lil' bit of shredded coconut and added way less sugar and it was fine.  I reduced sugar to almost 1/2 because the applesauce and bananas are sweet.  I also added some yogurt I had on hand to subsittute buttermilk I did not have as recommended by another reviewer.  I made double batches and did not add nuts.  Also, added some cinnamon and pumkin spice.  It was yummy and the texture is nice to.  Not to moist and not to dry.  Great muffins.  Thank you.

This bread came out wonderfully moist and heavy.  I followed the recipe exactly and have now made it twice.  The second time I think I undercooked it (my oven may be slightly cool) and the middle fell a bit overnight.  It was still yummy.  Thanks for this recipe.  It will become my standard banana bread recipe from now on.

I have tried many banana bread recipes but I have to say that my mouth literally fell open when I saw how beautiful this banana bread came out of the oven and when I tasted the first slice...wow!! I baked the banana bread exactly for 1 hour and 20 minutes; no need to check it and have to bake it a little longer like some recipes. I didn't have quite 1 cup mashed bananas (I only had 2 very ripe ones) but the taste was still great!! I also only used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and that is because I love the taste of brown sugar. Oh, and I did put in 1/2 cup chopped walnuts; delicious!! I would love to give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!

This truly is THE best ever banana bread, in my opinion. I have tried a ton of recipes over the years, but now that I have found this one, I will never use anything else! I did make a couple of changes. I used half whole wheat flour and replaced the 1 1/2 cups of white flour with 1 cup of brown sugar (they are still plenty sweet!). I also use "sour milk" (add a splash of vinegar in your 1/3 cup measuring cup, then add milk to the top) instead of buttermilk. Lastly, we prefer muffins over loaves, and this recipe yields 12 "regular-sized" muffins AND 12 mini muffins. Delicious!

This really is fabulous! I did as others recommended and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Also used a mixture of white and brown sugar (about 1/4 cup less than called for). Outrageous! Also, we're not big nut fans, so I used raisins. This is a really moist, tender, and delicious bread/cake.

Delicious! I cut the sugar to 1 cup brown sugar (and even then it was sweet! Next time I will do 3/4 cup) added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Didn't have pecans, so didn't use it, but next time I will add walnuts because I like walnuts in my banana bread. I mashed 3 very ripe (on the verge of rotten! haha!) and because I couldn't find my loaf pan, I made 12 muffins and baked for 30 minutes. perfect and delicious and will make again!

I'm glad I waited before I reviewed this. Right out of the oven and this just tastes pretty plain, but the next day!! WOW! What a difference and soooooo yummy!

I did make a few simple changes. Used cinnamon applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. Added 1 tsp vanilla, a 1/4 tsp cinnamon and walnuts instead of pecans. Oh, I also took other reviewers advice and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and even with just one cup it was still plenty sweet! I would NOT use 1 1/2.

I've made banana bread often for my co-workers and one made the comment, "This is the best banana bread you've ever made. So moist and tastey!" I think I'll keep this one since it was much simplier than my previous recipe and taste so much yummier the next day!

I wanted a slightly bigger loaf so I used 2 cups of flour but only 1 1/4 cups sugar.  I added about 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, one teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla.  I tried this recipe because it used vegetable oil.  My standard banana bread recipe uses butter and I needed mine for something else.   Used walnuts instead of pecans.

This was okay. The crust gets super brown and overflows during baking. So be sure to place a pan underneath to catch drips. One thing we didn't like was it was wayyyyy tooo sweet. I think I will stick with Janet's Rich Banana Bread from this site. Thanks tho

I made 2 batches... Both with very ripe bananas...in one, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon with the dry ingredients, only used 1 cup sugar, and I folded in about a cup of mini chocolate chips, and baked to perfection in a 9x13 cake pan for about 45 minutes... 
The one I made exactly as written, after 45 minutes in the bread pan, the outside was getting very golden brown, so I had to tent it with foil to keep from burning, then cooked entire time. It turned out great, but next time I will probably tent it for the first 45 minutes. :D Thank you for posting.. The taste and texture is perfect :D

This really is the best banana bread I've made. It's extremely moist! I baked it in muffin pans for about 30 minutes or so and toasted the nuts while the oven preheated. Will not use another banana bread recipe!!!

This really is a great tasting banana bread. I substitute the buttermilk with coconut milk (not canned) and add 1/2 tsp. of almond extract to make it lactose-free for my husband and it tastes just as good.

I just made this version of  banana bread since I had buttermilk to use up and it turned out delicious.  I doubled the recipe and it made 4 mini loaves and 1 regular loaf.  I only used 2 cups of sugar and it was perfect.  3 cups would have made it way too sweet.  Make sure you use really ripe bananas because they have a much higher sugar content.  I've never added vanilla to banana bread and think it might throw off the strong banana flavor.

really good, really moist, great texture. my only gripe is that it's WAY too sweet. Next time I'll cut the sugar back to 1 cup (probably less).

This was SO nummy! By far the best banana bread I've ever had! I followed recipe exactly except I did not have any buttermilk so I used 1/3 cup of 1% milk and added 1 tablespoon of vinegar. I did this first while I prepared the rest of the ingredients until my milk started to curd. I did add the pecans as well. Thanks for the recipe!!! This was also super easy to make!

This is a great & fool proof recipe. Thought the amount of sugar would make it too sweet so  I tweaked it a bit by using only 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white, added 1/2 cup of milled flax seeds & a dash of cinnamon powder...perfect!

I absolutely recommend this recipe to anyone who is looking to make a phenominal banana bread! I tweaked the recipe a bit by I adding 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and this recipe came out better than I had dreamed. My family even requested it to be the Thanksgiving dessert instead of pecan pie, which speaks volumes! If you love nuts, add 1/2-3/4 c. chopped walnuts, which is my plan for when I make it later this week. It will make the absolute amazing and perfect banana bread. A definite keeper!!!

This is the best banana bread I've ever made. I made a few minor changes: I used 4 bananas instead of 3, added 1 tsp vanilla, added 1 tsp cinnamon and subbed 1/2c of the white sugar for 1/2c brown sugar. It is amazing. My husband and 2 year old both ate 3 pieces for breakfast. Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!! It`s a delight to your mounth. Loved the texture and moist. Very flavory but not to thick flavor on the banana. I used a bit less than 1 2/3 cups of sugar becuase the bananas were quiet sweet. At work EVERYONE LOVED IT & WANTED MOREEEE!!!

Everyone who has tried this banana bread says it is the best they have ever had.
I never have buttermilk so I make my own by souring the milk - adding vinegar, lemon juice or cream of tartar and letting it sit for about 15 minutes. The ratio is 3 tsp of acid to 1 cup of milk, or for this recipe, 2 tsp for 2/3 cup milk.

Very moist bread!  I did cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup and it was still sweet enough.  Sprinkled in a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to add additional flavor.   I used chopped walnuts in place of pecans sprinkled on top.  Finally I did use 3 mini loaf pans, baked 42 minutes at 325.  Will make again!

Very, very good!  For 6 small loaves (6"x3") I doubled the recipe using half cup oil/half cup unsweeted applesauce, 4 med sized brown bananas, 2 tsp. vanilla, and 2/3 c. sour cream instead of buttermilk mixed with the eggs. Used only 1 c. white and 1 c. granulated brown sugar instead of 3 c. white. As suggested by another reviewer, I added the topping of sugar, nuts, cinnamon and nutmeg* prior to baking loaves on a cookie sheet at 325 for 45 minutes.  They came out PERFECT!! Store in loose fitting bags, place a saltine cracker or two in each bag to keep bread from getting too moist.  
*for topping: 3 Tbsp sugar, 5 Tbsp finely chopped nuts, 1 tsp cinnamon, 2 generous dashes of nutmeg

I always thought I had a "Banana Bread curse" on me, every recipe that I've ever tried never turned out well until this one.  I think the secret is in the lower temperature and longer baking time.  The bread came out a nice golden brown color and really moist.  I made one change to the recipe.  Buttermilk is too expensive to keep on hand, so I substituted a 1/3 cup of sour cream instead.  Perfect!

I have to agree with all of the other reviews on this one, WON-DER-FUL. 
I added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of butter flavoring.

I know I'm in the minority here but I couldn't get through an entire slice of this.  While making it, I triple checked the recipe because a cup and a half of sugar seemed like way too much.  And it is.  This is sickeningly sweet with only a subtle banana flavor.  The sugary crust you end up with is way over the top and not something I've ever seen on banana bread.

This seriously was the best banana bread I've had yet....and I DIDN'T CHANGE A SINGLE THING ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS like so many reviewers on here have!!! What sets this banana bread apart for me is the chewy, crunchy crust that forms on the loaf as it bakes! Try it & you'll know what I'm talking about! (And with no substitutions or additions!)

I feel like I did something very wrong with this recipe. The only change I did was put in a little more banana and put a full two cups of flour. After the two hours it looked done but soon the top craved in and it taste like it was not cooked enough. I may one day try this again but not any time soon. With all the great reviews I feel it must have been on my part that this didn't turn out.

Agreed, absolutely the best there is.  I didn't have buttermilk, so used equal amount half and half with a teaspoon of vanilla.  I'm sure it didn't change the flavor or consistency at all.  This is now my go-to recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I did make a couple of changes that don't alter the base recipe too much.  I used melted butter instead of the oil, reduced the buttermilk to 1/4 cup and replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar. I also added 1/2tsp of cinnamon to the flour.  It was a nice rich, brown, sturdy loaf and was very moist.  I had a similar recipe at one time and lost it so I am glad to have found this one to replace it.  I can now throw out the other recipes that I've been trying out (and have been disappointed by) and  will use this one from now on!  Thanks, Rose; great recipe!

Simply awesome.  I only used 90g brown sugar and 30g white sugar as the bananas themselves are already sweet.  I baked one with soya milk for my sis who is vegan and she gave the thumbs up.  Gadzillion Thanks Rose for a most delightful banana bread recipe.  This will be my Go-To recipe henceforth for banana breads.  YUM!

This really is the best banana bread I've ever made! I used dark chocolate chips instead of pecans, and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I did my usual substitutions (ground flax for eggs, applesauce for oil.) I used organic "white whole wheat" flour, and 3 bananas. Very moist, and the banana/chocolate combo is sooooo good!

This was delicious! Himself (husband) pronounced it a "definite keeper" I waited too long to start it and so had to go to bed before it had cooled enough to slice, which didn't stop me from picking the crunchy bits that overflowed my pan! This was so rich you couldn't eat more than a couple of slices. I only tweaked a little bit: I used 1/2 brown sugar, added a little bit of vanilla, fresh nutmeg and a teensy bit of cinnamon (maybe too little). I did butter and sugar the pan per someone's suggestion.  I don't like nuts so I used a couple of tablespoons of walnut oil. I think I may have gotten too much sugar in because the top was bubbly & sticky-ish like when cake has too much sugar. WAAAY delicious.

This was easy to make but the recipe didn't work for me. I should have known it was too much sugar from the start. Bananas are already sweet. I'd cut the sugar in half and bake it at 350 for an hour if I were to make it again. But instead, I think I'll look for something else.

This is simply delicious.  I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon & sugar. DELICIOUS.  I split it into 4 tiny loaf pans and baked for 40 minutes.  For two of them I added a handful of semi-sweet chips.  My husband said this is the best banana bread he's ever had and I have to agree.

Oh my!!!! It truly is amazing! I had 6 bananas to use so I doubled the recipe. I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce to cut the fat. I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. It made 2 loaves - 1 regular and 1 bread-style loaf
Had 4 bananas - chngd svg size to 18; 3/4 oil (1/4 apple sauce, 1/4 coconut oil, 1/4 oil) - fitted perfectly into large loaf pan

Very flavorful -- better than the buttery recipes I have used in the past.  This one's a keeper!

I used 3 1/2 bananas, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.

I made the original recipe with no variations.  I think it is too sweet/uses too much sugar.  The loaf browned very quickly and by the time it was cooked all the way through, the sugar had caramelized and tastes a little burned.  For the reviews with many variations, I'd suggest posting a different recipe instead of giving this 5 stars even though you changed the recipe significantly.

I've made this recipe like 5 times already and my whole family LOVES it!!! I've tried a lot of different recipes over the years and this one takes the cake!!! I usually end up doubling the recipe and making a bunch of mini loaves to give to friends & family. I usually make the recipe as is except I add 1 tsp. cinnamon cause I like the flavor. I've also added different things to the batter like; blueberries, raisins, chocolate chips.... they all taste great! This is my permanent recipe for banana bread from now on! Thanks Rose!

I have to admit, part of the problem with my attempt at this bread is I added to many nuts. However, even with my error in judgment I wont error twice & make this bread again. This is why baking/cooking is an art. Some people like it & some people dont. Myself & my family did not like this bread.

Wow. This was awesome. I tried it because I didn't have any butter or sour cream in the house and the recipe my family makes uses both of those. I also had some buttermilk I wanted to use up. This banana bread was fantastic when steaming hot and fresh out the oven. I don't even know if I'll be able to review how it tastes after sitting because I am basically shoveling it into my mouth as fast as I can eat it. I added a splash of vanilla extract and cinnamon, and I substituted walnuts for pecans and 1 1/4 cups brown sugar instead of the 1 1/2 cups white because I really like my banana bread moist. I used four really ripe bananas and although it says "mix well," by habit I prefer to limit the amount of stirring I do with my spoonbreads, pancake batter, etc so I only folded the wet ingredients in gently. Stuck it in the oven for 50 minutes in a loaf pan. I am thinking of topping with bananas next time or a brown sugar topping for a bit of a crunch.

I scaled to 28 servings as I had 7 bananas to use up. I substituted pineapple juice for the milk as I needed it to be dairy free for my son's classmate. I also altered the leavening to 1 tsp of baking soda and 4 tsps baking powder to my 4 cups of flour. I used half the sugar and used brown sugar because of the juice. I used half each all purpose and whole wheat flour. I omitted the nuts due to allergies. I used 1 pullman pan and 1 regular loaf pan that baked in 90 minutes.

Great bread. I do not use Vegetable oil at all, nor canola, so I substituted Coconut oil, which was really delicious. I would imagine you could use butter as well. I also have not used the nuts - yet - as I have made this 6 times!!!!

This is a moist and delicious banana bread.  I used butter instead of oil and dusted the pan with a tablespoon of sugar mixed with 1/8 tsp. cinnamon.  The bread came out of the pan easily and the outside was a warm brown with only a hint of cinnamon.

This is definatelly the best banana bread! I used some of the changes others suggested (instead of buttermilk I used yogurt, instead of all white sugar I used a cup of white and the rest brown sugar, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and teaspoon of cinnamon, and also added hazelnuts). It came out so good that my family ate it before it got cold :) will be making it soon! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This banana bread is so good. I had to ditch my old recipe because it called for butter/margarine, and I have become lactose intolerant. So, I tried this one because of the oil. I used canola oil and lactose free milk instead of the buttermilk. I also added a streusel topping as one of the other reviewers stated, and it was so delicious. I'll be using this recipe from now on. Thanks so much for sharing.

Yum, yum, yum. I can't stand whole bananas, but my roommate had two that were getting brown and I didn't want her to have to toss them, so I figured I'd find an easy banana bread recipe to use them in. This came out really moist and delicious. I followed a few other people's advice and added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, as well as subbing 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also omitted the nuts, but it's great without them.

The recipe is short and easy enough just a bit to sweet for me.  Next time only one cup of sugar and maybe some chocolate chips :)

I tried this several times.  This is a great recipe.  I did use the suggestions of Georgia by using 1 c sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I covered the sides of the loaf with cinnamon and sugar mixture.  I also topped with cinnamon and sugar mixture.  This is a keeper.

This is a great recipe. I usually use an extra half cup of banana. To make this a "lighter" version I subsitutue apple suace for the vegetable oil and it still taste great and cuts out a lot of calories. Also this bread shouold not be served right away. It tastes best the next day. The banana flavor is much more powerful the day after than right before. Although I have a hard time keeping my husband away from the warm bread just out of the oven.

- Side note: I have read some reviews that said the did not use buttermilk. I would not recommend leaving out the buttermilk... in any recipe that calls for it. Buttermilk gives a great flavor and the bread would just not be the same without it.

Excellent recipe!! I highly recommend trying this recipe before all others! I have been trying to find a good banana nut bread and thank gawd I have found it :D My first batch I made a double for my bunt pan, funny thing is doubling made enough for my bunt pan AND an additional 9x5 loaf (good idea for neighbors or co-workers). The only substitutions I made was instead of buttermilk I used sour cream, I cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup, using half white and half brown sugar, I also added vanilla, cinnamon and mini chocolate chips - HEAVEN! I used walnuts instead of pecans, its preference really. Use cinnamon and sugar instead of using flour to dust your pan... trust me, it adds a lil special something to it :) Happy Baking!!

Had a carton of buttermilk that I needed to use and this recipe came up on a search. Have tried many banana bread recipes, as it's a favorite treat in our house but this one is the best!!! I added vanilla, extra walnuts and mini choc chips so yeah, it took it over the top! But otherwise I followed the base ingredients to a tee. Made four mini bundt cakes and the are so cute may give them for christmas gifts! Yummy!!

This bread was fantastic. I used applesauce as well in place of the oil and it stuck to the pan a bit. Next time I think I will try flouring the pan after spraying it. Also I added 1t of cinnamon as well as 1t of vanilla. Using 1/4 t of a citrus extract may be another good thing to add. I used to make only my great gran's recipe but this is superb. It has a GREAT flavor. Try this!! You will not be disappointed!!

I made a lot of my own alterations so I'm not even sure this counts, but it came out delicious and the buttermilk idea was a really good one for making the bread supermoist.  Here are the substitutions I made, mostly to reduce the calories -- plain non-fat yogurt instead of buttermilk (works in pretty much all recipes calling for buttermilk, as far as I can tell), used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour, only used 1/4 c. or less of oil and about 1/3 c. of cinnamon applesauce, only used 3/4 cup of sugar in total (1/2 c. brown, 1/4 c. white -- it was still plenty sweet, probably in part because of all that cinnamon applesauce), and added about 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. ginger, and 1/8 tsp. ground cloves to the flour before mixing the dry ingredients with the wet (the spices are just personal preference -- they give it a sort of spicy pumpkin pie flare).  I was in love with a different banana bread recipe from this website, but this one is at least as good even after making all the substitutions to make it healthier.  A very forgiving and tasty recipe!  I recently froze an extra loaf and thawed it a week later.  It tastes even better than the loaf I ate immediately.  This bread definitely freezes well.

I am very surprised with this recipe. Having such a high rating I was expecting something really good. I followed the recipe except that I only had 1 egg left and I'm sure that's not why this recipe didn't turn out for me. Its just blah, almost flavourless. It also turned out really dark, unlike the picture. I won't be making this recipe again, will stick with A-number-1 banana cake from this site. Sorry.

I saw so many good reviews, that I used this recipe to make several loaves of banana bread.  It just wasn't very tasty.  I couldn't give it to my neighbors, and ended up throwing it all out.

Spectacular exactly as written with the exception of the cooking time which is a bit too long.  In my oven 1 hr. 15 min. was perfect, but at 1 hr. 20 min. the bottom was getting a bit too dark.  I don't understand the reviews about 'too sweet'.  It was perfectly balanced in my opinion but also keep in mind that if you use very ripe bananas you could easily cut back on the sugar as very ripe bananas have more sweetness than just plain old ripe bananas.  I also don't understand reviews that make adjustments that don't work out and then give the recipe a lower rating because of it.  eg.  Using too many bananas then giving a 2 star rating!  Come on - if you alter the recipe and it doesn't turn out, don't blame the recipe!

This bread rose nicely and looked and smelled great when I pulled it out of the oven, but after it cooled it has sunk in to about half it's original size and left a very moist, borderline raw, bread inside.

I used whole milk instead of buttermilk because I didn't have buttermilk on hand and I also cut back to just one cup of sugar. I added some chopped walnuts and a few chocolate chips and it came out just fine.

Delicious. Like others here, I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, because hey--when has banana bread not benefited from cinnamon? It came out darker than my usual banana bread recipe, but so, so moist, and it kept its crispy crust after refrigeration! Double bonus!

I'm in agreement with many of the other reviewers that this banana bread is pretty yummy, though, the recipe as is would be ridiculously sweet in my opinion. Bananas are already naturally sweet and become even sweeter by the time they're ripe enough to be used in breads, cakes, etc. So I used only about 1/2 cup sugar. It baked without a problem and tasted great!

I make this delicious bread on a regular basis and it is fabulous!! My family loves it and I'm always complimented on it by others.  I've made a few modifications over time to suit my taste: 1. vanilla yogurt in place of buttermilk; 2.  Instead of 1.5 cups of white sugar, I use 3/4 C white and 3/4 C brown sugar; 3. I've cut the oil back to 1/3 C; and 4. I add a dash of vanilla.  Enjoy!!

LOVELY banana bread :)
For a VEGAN version, I substituted for the eggs with two flaxseed "eggs", and the milk with almond milk. Couldn't even tell it was vegan. It was gobbled up in no time! For 2 a flaxseed eggs you will need to combine 6 tbls of warm water with 2 tbls of ground flaxseeds. Mix it and let it sit for a about 5 min on the counter, and voila! you have a flaxseed egg substitute. The consistency should be the same slimy consistently as eggs whites. With the almond milk and flaxseed egg you have a banana bread with less cholesterol and less fat, without compromising the taste. Hope that helps. Happy baking everyone.

Of all the recipes I have tried from this website for banana bread, this is the clear winner. Family approved! I follow the recipe exactly and it takes me 3 bananas to make the 1 cup for the recipe. I made 2 loaves the first time and so they baked for 1 hour versus the longer time. I did them at 325. The next time I made banana muffins and they baked in like 15-17 minutes, still at 325. Those I sent off to my son at college.

Really a great, easy recipe. Thanks!

I have tried a lot of banana bread recipes on this site, and so far, this is one of my favorites because of its sweetness. I would like to add more pecans next time. I made 9 mini loaves and cooked them 30-35 minutes.

Real simple recipe and sooo good.  The only changes I made were I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup apple sauce to make-up the difference, I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and vanilla and I added 3/4 tsp. of white vinegar to the milk as I did not have buttermilk on hand.  Yum!

So delicious!!!! Best banana bread ever. Seriously. It was so moist and the definition of banana bread. I followed the directions exactly except I did not have buttermilk so I used regular milk with 1/2 Tsp of white vinegar. I made mine into mini square loaves so I only had to bake them 25 minutes. I recommend this recipe 1000X. This is my new go to banana bread recipe!

This is in the top five banana bread recipes I have tried over the years. It captures all the elements you look for and provides the platform for easy substitutions. If you don't have buttermilk, use yogurt. If you want, decrease the white sugar a half cup and add the same amount of brown. Add some vanilla. I wondered about that, but the original recipe stands on it own. Nuts or no nuts. I put them on top. Just remember not to overcook. Many breads are dry and tasteless because they are cooked too long.

I had four bananas that were soft, so I made two loaves, one with pecans and one without. My new go-to recipe. This is so wonderful! Best banana bread I've ever had. Thank you for sharing!

Delicious!  I followed "Georgia's" advice, and used 1c. white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and subbed applesauce for the oil (which worked great).  This made 2 nice 7" x 4" loaves, which I baked for about 65 min. at 325.  So moist . . . I just love it.  This will be my go to banana bread recipe whenever I have buttermilk on hand!  Thanks.

Super easy and REALLY MOIST!! I replaced some of the oil with 1/8 C apple sauce and omitted the pecans.  This took about an hour and ten minutes in my gas oven.  Thanks for the recipe!! Definitely hanging on to this one! :)

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!  This is the most delicious banana bread I have ever had in my entire life!  I just made another loaf last night and my husband ate over half of the loaf right out of the oven :)  I add walnuts instead of pecans and occasionally use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, just depending on my mood.  Fabulous, beautiful and easy recipe!

I've always used the same recipe and decided to try something different.  This beat anything I used to make.  It was so moist.  I keep powdered buttermilk in the fridge and it was perfect for this.  It was pretty sweet so think next time I'll only put in 1 cup of sugar.  I used the recipe for 2 small loaf pans and it was perfect.  I'll never make anything else.

Turned out pretty good. The bake time is too long. Mine ended up over cooking. I also added a walnut and brown sugar topping before cooking and only added half the sugar in the batter. I will make again but with more changes.

Delicious.  I was in a kitchen with limited ingredients, so I used vanilla greek yogurt with a touch of milk instead of buttermilk.  I also used approximately half the recommended sugar because I was wasn't in the mood for a sugar bomb. I also sifted in (these are all approximate) 1/2 teaspoon ginger, 1/4 t cloves, some fresh grindings of nutmeg, and 3/4 t cinnamon.  Also some vanilla in the wet mix.  

The crust is amazing. So chewy crispy, straight out of the oven.  We ate half of this loaf standing in the kitchen, armed with a butter knife and our bare hands.  Chicken soup bubbling away on the stove; so naughty! But as my grandfather would say - 'Eat dessert first! They might drop the bomb.'

Like the other reviewers, I made some modifications. Applesauce and plain yogurt with a dash of vanilla. Everyone loved this. I also made another variation where I added blueberries (but to make up for the additional moisture, I added some flour). I'm waiting for my current bananas to ripen to make this again. It's everyone's fave.

Excellent.  Wouldn't change a thing. The only problem I have is keeping it around longer than an hour.  My boys (10 and 12) and their friends gobble it down like it is candy!

I have used this recipe countless times and it never fails!!  My family and friends love it.  This recipe makes me 2 loaves every time and I never have to substitute anything.  Plus, I love any recipe consisting of buttermilk!!  Two thumbs up on this one.

I've been making this bread for years. Thanks Allrecipes! And it has always been everyones favorite. I have handed this recipe out more than any other in my life. It truly is the Best Ever Banana Bread! I never changed the recipe but I have one thing to add that's a must. The reason most of our parents and grandparents made banana bread was to use up bananas that were over ripe. I think the taste really comes through when you use bananas that have more brown on the peel than not. When you make it always have the recipe ready for those who try it. You will need it.

This recipe was wonderful. It turned out so much better than the recipes with sour cream in them. It is still moist but not soggy. I made 1-1/2 batches and made 2 loaves and threw the rest into an 8x8 and baked until toothpick was clean and that turned out wonderful also. Will definitely be keeping this recipe.

Very easy recipe that produces a moist, delicious, banana bread.  I did add some vanilla and some cinnamon to it, but the basic recipe is sound, it would have been delicious anyway.  I may add some raisins to it next time, just for fun.

This is a phenomenal recipe! I never have buttermilk on hand so I usually measure the milk and add a little bit of lemon juice to it. Let it sit about 5 minutes and it's good to go. I also add a little bit of cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla extract, walnuts instead of pecans and Craisins (dried cranberries). The baking time will vary, but stick a toothpick in the center and when it comes out clean--its done. 

I have made this time and time again and it is ALWAYS a hit. I usually have to make two or three loaves because guests never leave me any!

Next time I will try applesauce instead of oil, just to try something different.

I make a lot banana bread; especially in the fall.  I didn't have high expectation, I just needed to use my buttermilk before it goes bad.  This banana bread is AMAZING.  Truly the best banana bread on this site.  I can't imagine it getting better than this.

Love this recipe!  I usually use 2 large very ripe bananas, but ideally I like to use 3 bananas for stronger banana flavor.  Also, I use a little less than 1 1/2 cups of sugar (something like 1 1/4 cup) because it can be a little too sweet, especially when I'm using 3 bananas.

I like the buttermilk, I think it moisten the bread.  Im sorry but I had 4 large bananas that needed to be used & they made 3 cups mashed.  Used half whole wheat white flour because ran out of flour.  There was too much batter for one loaf so made into 2 smaller ones.  Omitted pecans nut. Allergies.  Added 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Breads came out yummy. Love all the moist banana pieces.  Will use more bananas in future breads. Thank you for a great recipe

I have made this recipe many times!  I did however cut back on the sugar and only use 1 cup.  I've mailed this bread to a friend and was overwhelmed with the compliments.  It is a very moist and delicious Banana Bread.  You will NEVER be sorry for trying it!

I was looking for something a little different, healthier, and not blah. I had recently made cinnamon applesauce and had some yogurt to use up so I substituted these for the oil and buttermilk. I made a double batch and split it between my pampered chef mini loaf pan which has 4 little loafs and a standard loaf pan. A last min thought I added coconut to 2 of the mini loafs (as an experiment). They turned out beautiful, flavorful, and moist. I will freeze some for a latter date. All in all this is a great recipe even if you change a few things and make it your own!

Great recipe.  Yum! I tripled mine because I had so many BANANAS! I would reduce the baking soda if you increase the recipe.  Mine flowed over the top of the pans. Froze two loaves. Will review later when I unfreeze! Also I didn't have buttermilk so I used evaporated milk with vinegar- could account for the rise reaction.  Tip-if you dont have buttermilk add 1 tblsp vinegar or lemon juice to 1 cup whole milk (or evaporated 1/2 c plus water 1/2 cup) let stand for 5 min.

The very best i have ever made, and eaten, used a few suggestions, substituted the buttermilk with plain yogurt, used the 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 sugar combo and added chocolate chips and a splash of vanilla extract. Not just a good recipe but a great one. I brought it to a dinner with family and it was received very nicely. Thanks for the treat.

Great resipe! Delicious, moist cake. 
I did alter the recipe some though and it came out amazing: 
I used 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar.
I replaced the vegetable oil with coconut oil and I replaced the buttermilk with plain yogurt and about 2 tbps of melted butter.
I also cut back on the baking time about 15 minutes.
One of the other reviewerss had a great suggestion for a crunchy top coat, so before popping in oven. I mixed together a tsp sugar with about 2 tbsps cinnamon and a good dash of nutmeg, sifted it together along with crushed walnuts and sprinkled this mixture on the top, pressing it gently down with the back of a spoon. 

It came out very moist in the center with a great sweet crunch on the top. So tasty!

I was looking for a recipe without butter and this did the trick :) I substituted the buttermillk with some 2% milk, used half white/half brown sugar and added some walnuts, cinnamon and chocolate chips. It was moist and delicious and according to the kids the 'best' I've ever made :))
Tip:Check the baking time, mine was done in 45 minutes although the recipe asked for longer.

I reduced sugar to 1c and did half white, half packed brown for the darker coloured bread.  I added 1.5Tbsp poppy seeds and cinnamon as well.  It baked slightly quicker than the recipe said.
I used runny yoghurt instead of buttermilk as well.

I was hoping this would be a good vegetarian entree, but it really couldn't carry a meal on its own. It probably would be nice as a side dish.

Definitely soft and moist. Best banana bread I have had so far. I had made it three times already.  I've reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup as I find it to be too sweet for my taste.  Works well with brown sugar too.  I used walnuts instead of peacans.  Next time I will try to add vanilla and cinnamon just as mentioned by the other reviewers and see how it goes.

This is by far the best banana bread I have ever had.  I'm convinced that anyone who did not rate this recipe high did not follow the recipe.  I made it exactly by the recipe, it turned out fabulous.  The only suggestions I will take next time are to add the cinnamon/sugar to the pan and on top for extra crunch and bake it as 4 mini loaves (the large loaf took 1 hr. 10 minutes in a convection oven.)  Absolutely fabulous, thanks for the recipe.

This banana bread is AWESOME!  Because I like extra spice and flavor, I did make a couple modifications per other reviewers' suggestions:  used 1 cup white sugar + 1/2 cup brown and added 2 tsp vanilla, 1-2 tsp cinnamon, a couple dashes of nutmeg, and a large dollop of plain yogurt.  Also, I added the following topping suggested by another reviewer:  mix 2T finely chopped nuts, 2T granulated sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and dash of nutmeg, sprinkle onto batter, and lightly press with back of a spoon.  The combination of moist bread and crunchy topping is amazing.  I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts in both the bread and topping.  I will be making this again and again..

I think this is indeed the best banana bread I´ve done but I´m a little bit concerned about cooking healthy so I made a little change and instead of the white flour, added whole wheat, instead of white sugar, brown. and it turned aout great!

So so good and really light and fluffy; not dense and dry like most banana bread recipes.  I even made a mistake and switched the measurements for the oil and half and half (which I subbed for the buttermilk) and it was delicious!  I used 3 bananas, omitted the nuts because I didn't have any and baked two 8x4 loaves at 325 for 45 minutes.  I think I can throw out my other banana bread recipes now because I'm not going to need them!

I've made this twice now - VERY DELICIOUS!!!  HOWEVER - It DOES need VANILLA! (teaspoon?) I also sprinkle nutmeg into the "dry" mixture portion. The suggestion of sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on a greased baking pan its BRILLIANT! Sprinkle it on top too.... Makes a delicious caramelized crust. YUM!!! COMPLIMENTS EVERY TIME!

AMAZING!!  Best banana bread I've ever had!  I joined allrecipes just to write a review on this recipe.  I left out the nuts and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  Made this 3 times in 2 weeks and got rave reviews from everyone who tried it!  Yum!

Hands down, this is THE banana bread recipe I use. Texture, flavor, everything is outstanding (and I'm not generally much of a banana bread fan). I've done as full-size loaves, mini loaves and muffins, and each has been great. Be sure to note the oven temp, as I have often turned it to 350 and had to scramble at the end to make sure it didn't burn! Truly a great recipe.

I am always looking for ways to use up left over buttermilk.  This was a perfectly fine banana bread recipe but not "best ever."  I have other recipes I like more.  Definitely tastier a day or two after its made.

This recipe works! It is moist and delicious and never, EVER last more than a day in my household of 2 adults and 1 preschooler :) I took the suggestion of other reviewers and substituted 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce for oil but added 1 tablespoon of olive oil - the bread was not as moist without that one tblsp of oil. Also, I always substitute plain yogurt for buttermilk - works just fine. Love this recipe and we end up making batch almost everyweek.

Very good banana bread.  I was looking for a recipe to make that had buttermilk in it.  It was nice and moist.  My picky 3 year old even liked it.  I used whole wheat flour and applesauce indstead of oil.

This bread was wonderful... definately need at least 3 bananas for it. My first batch didn't have enough banana flavor me for then I tried it again with another banana and was pleased. Have sent this bread to my husband in Iraq twice now. It traveled very well... even with how moist it is. He was actually shocked at how extremely moist it was but didn't arrive molded or anything. My husband and I both thank you for this recipe! :)

This was pretty good.  I doubled the recipe to use 4 bananas, and made 8 mini-loaves and one big loaf.  The flavor was good, and it was easy to mix up.  I used half applesauce for the oil, and olive oil because that's all I had.  It made the apartment smell great too.  Thanks.

I doubled this recipe and was pretty happy with the end results. Didn't modify it too much, I just reduced the amount of sugar to 2 cups (for 2x the orginal recpie) and added a tbsp of vanilla. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. I found the bread to have a nice sweetness to it, so I think that the extra cup of sugar would have been too much. Next time I'm going to try and replace the oil with applesauce.

My family raved about this banana bread and it was so easy!  I didn't have buttermilk so I used this trick:  add one teaspon of red wine vinegar to the 1/3 cup of milk the recipe asked for and it does the job great!  This is my second time making it and I've added dried cranberries, we'll see how it turns out!

This recipe is very easy to follow. More importantly, it tastes great. It's very moist. Since I don't have buttermilk, I used 1 teaspoonful lemon juice in a 1/3 cup of milk and let it stands for 5 minutes. Like others, I also added a splash of vanilla. BTW, I used 4 very ripe bananas. I have no idea how many cups that was. But, it came out great. It was so yummy. Try it. You won't be disappointed.

Great banana bread! I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and used 1 cup white four and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour instead of all white flour. Nice texture and pretty shape. It also holds up well in the toaster. Good banana flavor.

Loved the pecans--this really IS the best banana bread ever! The ONLY thing I changed was the cooking time---it only took about an hour for the bread to bake. YUM! I made it into french toast!

I’m eating this best ever banana bread as I’m typing. It’s soooo moist! I baked it in muffin cups. I reduced the sugar to 100 gr and add crumble for topping. For the crumble I use 100 gr flour, 100 gr butter, 30 gr sugar. Mix all of them, then pour on top of the mixture. It’s so yummy, thanks for sharing this recipe :)

I had some leftover buttermilk that needed using along with 3 overripe bananas so this is the perfect recipe for that.  I baked at 350degrees for 1 hour and it was perfect...didn't want to hold up the oven for the extra 20 min at 325..I usually bake all my sweet breads at 350 for 50-60 min...that is pretty standard.  Only changes I made was adding vanilla extract and a tsp. of banana extract.  **I could see that this being a thin batter could not take the addition of solids such as nuts or mini chips...they would only sink to the bottom.  I see that other reviewers had trouble with sinking and sticking to bottom of pans and this could be why.  I'll keep this recipe for when I have another surplus of buttermilk

I made this recipe awhile ago and it was excellent....dense and supermoist plus great flavor. Its hard to find a good moist, dense bread. I tried another because I couldn't find this recipe and it didn't compare....i just found it again and I can't wait to make it! YUM!

I just finished baking this recipe.  I made a small loaf and 2 dozen mini muffins.  They turned out delicious.  I substitued walnuts for pecans, because that is what I had at the time.  I definitely will use this recipe again.  My picky eater, 2 year-old son already ate three mini muffins!  I greased my pans with a generous amount of shortening, no sticking!  I think I will stick with this recipe for banana bread.

A great recipe that holds up excellently with healthful or decedent modifications. My only complaint is  that baking this for one hour and twenty minutes was much too long (in my oven at least.) Next time I make this I'll start checking the middle after an hour, maybe even fifty minutes.

Yup, definitley lives up to it's name. I was concerned because the batter practically filled the loaf pan but it rose just above the top of the pan and came out very moist and very flavorful. I followed other reviewers advice and used a little more than a cup of mashed bananas, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar, added vanilla, and cinnamon. This will be my go to banana bread recipe from now on!

I've used this recipe for years. I keep powdered buttermilk on hand, mix it in with dry ingredients, and use water in the wet ingredients. It's so delicious - perfect flavor and texture.

WOW!!!! Had some leftover bananas, read this recipe and the reviews.  Glad I did!!!!  Used applesauce instead of oil, vanilla yoghurt instead of buttermilk, 1 tsp of cinnamon and did the brown/white sugar mix.  Also lightly sprinkled the loaf pan with sugar as another reader suggests to give it texture.  Great ideas!!!!! The bread turned out soooo very moist and tasty.  There won't be any to freeze!!! Thanks all who contributed!!!

This is my favourite banana bread recipe. I generally substitute plain yogurt for the buttermilk  and double the recipe. Always turns out and disappears quickly at home and at the office. If you try it you won't be disappointed!

Yes, I think this will be my new standby.  I made it exactly as the recipe specified and while it is delicious and amazingly moist, it is too sweet, even for my sweet tooth.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar and - what the heck - may as well toss in a 1/2 tsp of vanilla while I'm revising a little.  I made my "buttermilk" by adding 1/3 tsp of white vinegar to 1/3 c milk and let it sit for 5 mins.

I am very grateful for this recipe as I have been looking for a long time for "the one".  Thank you!

Just made this and everybody loves it! I don't think we will have any leftovers from this batch. I used butter instead of vegetable oil (b'se we didn't have any) and added chocolate chips (personal taste). Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Love banana bread and this is a perfect recipe. Thank you! Only substitutions I had to make was using bread flour because I was out of the regular, and since I usually don't buy buttermilk, I mixed together 1/3 c. milk and 1/2 t. vinegar.

Made muffins out of this recipe for some friends that were coming over for coffee.  This definitely lived up to its name!  So moist and delicious.  Of course, had to adjust the baking time but they came out perfect.

Followed the recipe exactly though I didn't measure my bananas - used 3 1/2 overripe large bananas. I didn't want to use too much - but realized after eating it that the 1/2 wouldn't have hurt it. I also added chopped WALNUTS to the mix and a sugar/cinnamon/walnut mixture topping. Delicious and moist! Just made this and the whole loaf is almost gone - and there's only 3 people in the house (one of them a 12 yr old boy). I will continue to add a nut topping (maybe not as much sugar as I did this time)..and might experiment with apple sauce instead of oil as well as replacing some of the sugar with brown sugar next time. But this recipe is great just the way it is!

I just realized I may have already reviewed this a long time ago, but I always come back to this recipe as a dependable foundation for my banana bread. Because I often end up with two rotten bananas instead of three, I toss in a bit of greek yogurt or apple sauce to make up the difference. I also add cinnamon, and sometimes a bit of cocoa powder. My tip to people like me who never have buttermilk around the house, is that you probably do! Just pour a little splash of white vinegar into a third cup, and pour some milk on top of it. Let it sit for a minute if you want to see it start mixing.

I used 1 cup less sugar and split the remaining between white and brown and a tbsp of vanilla ... Made three mini loaves and topped two of them with chocolate chips because hubby and the boys love chocolate :-) 
Baked at 350 for just about an hour
Will use again :)

I made no changes to this recipe, and it is fabulous!  Not too sweet for us, and I did add the optional nuts, and really liked the crunch.  For me, all it needs is a thin layer of butter and a cup of coffee and I'm good to go.  Really moist and really good.  As I was baking it (for the full time, btw) I was a little concerned it was browning too quickly.  But no problems....turned out great!

Great banana bread! I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and used evaporated milk (with 1 t of vinegar to make "sour milk") since I didn't have the buttermilk or regular milk. Also added about 3/4C of toasted, chopped walnut and about 1t of cinnamon and vanilla. Also substitued applesauce for 1/2 of oil for less fat. Baked it for 1 hr and 15 min but it came out a little dry at the bottom and edges, so next time I will bake for 1 hr and see. I will definitely use this recipe again, probably with choc chips next time.

Great recipe. I didn't have any buttermilk so googled substitutes. I put 1 Tbsp of vinegar in a measuring cup and topped it up to the 1 cup line with milk. I let it sit for 5 minutes and then used. It turned out great. I plan to do this from here on out instead of buying/making real buttermilk.

So yummy and moist! My hubby says this bread is "perfect". Since I use rice flour instead of all-purpose (due to allergies), I have to decrease the flour by a few tablespoons. I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup like a few other reviewers. The result: delicious!

I've been making this recipe for a few years now. It's still delicious! I took other reviewers' advice and I only use a cup of sugar. It is delicious! I always use 3 bananas, which is about how much the recipe calls for. It has a really good banana flavor, and a great moist, banana bread texture. I often make it into muffins, and it makes 12. I don't find that it browns too much, but as with any baked good, if it does, throw a sheet of foil over it.

Excellent.  I made a few "healthy" changes-- I made the buttermilk by squeezing 1tsp of lemon juice into light vanilla soymilk and letting it sit while I combined the dry ingredients.  I substituted oil for applesauce and only put 1 cup of sugar- 1/2 c white and 1/2 cup brown.  I also used 1 cup of a,l purpose flour and 3/4 cup of whole wheat.  Also added 1 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon.  It was perfect.  We have already eaten 1/2 of the loaf, and it's been less than a day!

Very nice bread.  I have never made banana bread before because I don't like banana flavored foods, but I was looking to use up some ripe bananas.  I made this recipe exactly as written and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  The kids loved it.  It is a very dense moist bread.  Mine was done in 1 hour and 10 minutes so you might check it sooner than the recipes calls for.

I've made this twice now.  The first time was a bit of a disaster.  I doubled it (lot's of old bananas) and put the batter in two 9x5 pans and it boiled all over the place in the oven.  THe second time I made it, I did a single batch in two 9x5 pans.  And it was delightful.  5 stars because this is one of the best banana bread ever! 2 stars for me and my stupidity...

Very sweet and cake-like.  Missed the mark for me on banana flavor - just too mild.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out fine - the inside moist and dense, and the outside slightly crisp and sweet.  It just didn't pack enough banana punch for me.

WOW.
This is delicious and moist! I had to use 1/2 cup applesauce & 1/4 cup oil because I only had 1 egg. I used regular milk but put 3/4 tsp of vinegar in it and let it sit for 10 min. 
I made it into 12 muffins and baked them at 325 for around 25-28 minutes. SO GOOD.

i doubled the recipe and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, and it was still sweet.  also, i substituted applesauce for the oil.  used 6 bananas (5 would have been fine too).  very moist, flavorful bread, esp. with the brown sugar.  next time i could use even less sugar and it would make me feel better about eating it!  i also want to try 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon just to see how it changes.  but in reality, it doesnt need it.  thanks for the recipe!

This bread is delicious. However, I did change the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and it was plenty sweet, maybe almost too sweet. I did increase the buttermilk to 1/2 only because I'm trying to get rid of my leftover buttermilk! The bread came out so moist. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

So yummy! I made a few changes to make this a bit healthier. First, I used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. I switched the amounts of buttermilk and oil (1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/3 cup oil), and I used 1/4 cup brown sugar plus three tablespoons Stevia extract instead of the white sugar. It was plenty sweet and SO DELICIOUS! Highly recommended.

Perfect banana bread!  I use walnuts instead of pecans, and it tastes like Starbucks!  I suggest doubling the recipe and making two loaves, as my family devours two loaves in a weekend.

This recipe was great!
My husband loved it and kept asking for me.

I tweaked it a little bit by adding a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

This is definitely a recipe that I will make over and over again for my family.
Thanks Rose!

Excellent!  Everyne loved it..  Only problem I had was, living in the higher elevation, it needs to be baked  quite a bit longer when in a single loaf.  After adjusting the time, it came out perfect.

Look no further, this is an amazing recipe. With a few tweaks it truly becomes the perfect banana bread. As others have suggested, substitute vanilla yogurt (I use Greek) for the buttermilk. Also, use 1/2 cup applesauce + 1T vegetable oil instead of the full 1/2 cup oil. Use 1 cup brown sugar + 1/2 white instead of 1.5 cup white. Add 1/2T each of vanilla and cinnamon. Finally, mix up a little vanilla, milk & confectioner's sugar & pour over loaf immediately after removing from the oven. 
Never before have I felt so compelled to rate/review/share a recipe online. No doubt about it, this is the best!

This was so good. It was gone within the day!  I baked it in my pampered chef mini loaf stone and it came out great.  The only thing I changed was instead of 1 1/2 cup of white sugar I used 1 cup and the other 1/2 cup was light brown sugar.  I also sprinkled cinnamon on the top of the loaf before I put it in the oven.  I never rate anything but this is def 5 stars.

Loved this banana bread. I did something naughty and added an entire bag of Reese's mini peanut butter cups (8 oz.). I had read about someone doing it on a blog and I thought it sounded like a delicious idea - and it was!! ;-)

I am very happy with this recipe. I did not have buttermilk, but did have some half and half. I was scared to use the half and half, but I am so happy I did! This banana bread turned out beyond amazing and incredibly moist. I love experimenting. This a great treat for holiday time.

The best ever banana bread??? Heck ya! This bread rocked! Super moist, super easy, and super yummy! As usual, I try to stick to the original recipe since I don't have time to tinker around but I did add vanilla and cinnamon for an extra pop of flavor.

Makes a perfect loaf of banana bread. I didn't have any buttermilk so I made my own by adding 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to a cup of milk and allowing it to set for 5 min. After the 5 min I measured out the appropriate amount and added it to my mixture.  I followed the suggestions of others and used applesauce in place of the oil.  I also added 1 TB each of cinnamon and vanilla, and used a combination of white and brown sugar. I followed the cooking time to the minute, and it was perfect.
This isn't an overly sweet bread, and I think the substituting in of apple sauce causes it to lose some of its moisture. Next time I'll try half/half apple sauce and oil and maybe add another banana.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 1/2 C of brown sugar and 1 C of white sugar.  But I also added 1 t of cinnamon, and 1 t vanilla.  I think it could have actually done with a little less sugar, but it's a great banana bread.  I was worried about the batter because I've never made a quickbread with such a runny batter.  But it baked up beautifully.  It took about an hour and a half for me - still quite wet in the middle at 1:20.  But it was worth the wait.  Definitely a keeper!  I added pecans and it's the perfect add.  I might reduce the sugar and add a streusel on top next time.

Hands down this has to be the best banana bread I have EVER tasted!  I doubled the recipe and used 6 bananas that I had frozen!!  I had leftover caramel cream cheese frosting from another recipe and served it along side.  But my opinion is that it is great as is!  I've made banana bread before but never with buttermilk and now I will never make it any other way!

I used the ingredients listed, no changes there, but I did cut back on the sugar like some mentioned between 1 cup to 1.25 and I also lined the pan with cinnamon/sugar as suggested by others. It was moist and tasty!!!! My boyfriend and his mother, who are in the restauarant business and love banana bread, gobbled a loaf up in practically one sitting and said this bread could win contests!!! I love banana bread also and am kind of picky but this one is definitely very yummy and I won't look any further for the perfect recipe. Thanks v monte for sharing!!!!

Delicious. I added a small container of banana yogurt instead of the buttermilk and cut back to 1 c. sugar. Did 3/4 of the flour with whole wheat. Just wanted a healthier version for breakfast:)

Added ground cardamom, cinnamon, and ground ginger because I couldn't resist. Substituted with homemade " buttermilk" and reduced sugar using 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  Pecans instead of walnuts.  This is my keeper recipe for sure !

Delish!  I've made several banana bread recipes from this site including the Oatmeal Banana Bread and Banana Banana Bread.  I find this one particularly fluffy and it has the perfect consistency for a bread (not too dense and not too wet).  I have to admit that I made them into muffins because it was late and I couldn't wait the 1 hour and 20 minutes it called for.  I baked them on a muffin pan at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  It yielded 12 very large muffins.  I also did a crumbly topping that included the pecans (instead of in the batter).  Next time if I am adding the crumbly topping I will probably cut the sugar by 1/3 (1 cup instead of 1.5 cups).  I substituted 1/2 cup of the sugar for brown sugar as other reviewer suggested and added more than 1 cup of bananas (about 1.5 cup) because I needed to use 4 medium bananas I had.  Great recipe!! Thank You :)

I made this over the weekend so my husband would have breakfast for the week, as banana bread isn't my favorite, and because I had a ton of bananas in my freezer to start using up. The bread turned out great, moist, and beautiful! I made a couple of changes, as recommended by others. I didn't have buttermilk so I used vanilla yogurt (Dannon light n fit), I used 4 large over-ripe (thawed from the freezer) bananas. I used 1/2 c. white suger and 1/2 c. brown sugar), a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon and then I coated the pan with cinnamon/sugar and topped with brown sugar/cinnamon. I baked for 1 1/2 hours, as a knife in the center never seemed to come out dry, however after cutting into I discovered a large piece of banana in the center that might have been the culprit. The bread turned out very moist and the sugary topping added that little extra something. I also left out the nuts as I'm not a big fan of banana-nut bread. Will be making this recipe again!

This is the first recipe i tried when i start to learn/enjoy baking!  And it worked out perfectly!  The kitchen smelled so wonderful when the banana bread is baked in the oven!  The bread is really really moist and flavorful.  I added about 2/3 of the sugar though as the banana itself add some sweet taste already.

Love this recipe...made a few heart healthy changes and it was still wonderful!

4 egg whites (instead of whole eggs)
1/3 cup almond milk (instead of buttermilk)
1/2 cup olive oil (instead of vegetable oil)

Super delish! I made a few changes: olive oil for veggie oil, whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour and organic cane sugar for white sugar.

Poured into a (6) muffin pan and a (24) mini-muffin pan, sprinkled with chocolate chips and voila! Super yummy!

Just love bread and muffin recipes where I can use oil instead of planning ahead to let butter soften (we don't own a microwave). 

Thanks for a great recipe!

I was asked to use up a big bag of old frozen bananas(the kind that look so unappetizing), and this looked like the way to do it...I don't think I could have found a better recipe!  I took the advice of some others here... doubled the recipe to use my bundt pan.  Cut down the egg just a little, reduced the oil as well and added applesauce to make up for the difference.  I was using super "aged" bananas so halved the sugar, using a mix of white and brown.  The bread was still plenty sweet.  I would use even less sugar next time if using super ripe bananas .  I also took advice of others and used the sugar in the pan for extra fun crust and added a splash of vanilla.  I also added 1/3 cup wheat germ and used half white whole wheat flour.  This IS a very friendly recipe and lets you make a super tasty even healthy treat out of bananas that look terrible!

Love the rich brown color of the bread. I substituted the butter milk with vanilla yogurt and the vegetable oil with canola oil. This is the very best banana bread I have ever made.

Great recipe! followed another reviewer's tip, and substituted the applesause for the oil. And baked on 350 for 50 min, but middle was not done, so I turned it down to the original 325 and baked for another 15min. I made a double batch, so made a loaf and muffins(350 for 15min). I mixed walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, & baking raisins and then  sprinkled those on top of the muffins.  Could have gone  without adding the extra sugar to the top of those though. This is a sweeter recipe than my grandmothers, &def not as good, but still can hold it's own!

I made this bread because I was looking for a banana bread recipe that called for buttermilk.  I made it exactly according to directions and it came out wonderfully!  It doesn't puff up like I am used to, it stayed pretty flat on the top, but that doesn't matter to me.  I would rank this right up there with my normal recipe that I use, so it is VERY good!  Quick and easy to make too!

Ok, maybe not THE best ever, but pretty darn close! SOOO moist! It needed some vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg, and I replaced the oil with homemade applesauce. (Making it lower fat made me feel less guilty about all the sugar!) It has stayed moist 3 days later, even tho my hubby keeps leaving it out on the counter uncovered! Yum Yum.

I accidentally left out the eggs and the result was amazing. I almost didn't bake it thinking it wouldn't hold together but it was moist, flavorful and lower fat. It did fall apart a bit easier but I'm thinking one egg white might do the trick. (saved 142 cal. plus 10 grams of fat for the loaf).

Update: Made with one egg this time--perfect. Next time I'm cutting down the sugar!

This recipe is so easy that my 8 year old daughter makes it. Very moist and turns out delish every time. 3 bananas are perfect. I found there's too much batter for a loaf pan, so we always spray a Bundt pan w/ cooking spray & bake for 1 hour.  I also sprinkle a layer of cinnamon sugar on top before baking which we love. :o) Yummy.

Excellent!  I'm glad I had real buttermilk, because it is so good in this bread.  I used 2 large bananas, subbed 1/2 cup sugar with brown sugar, and added 2 tsp. cinnamon.  Smelled wonderful baking, tastes wonderful with a cup of coffee!

This is a great recipe as written-4 stars. I made it a second time using 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar and 1 T vanilla. These changes made it a 5 star recipe. Wet ingredients can be blended together first and dry ingredients added--requiring only one bowl for easy clean up. :)

OMG -lives up to its name. I used about 4 small very ripe bananas which I microwaved for about 20 seconds and then pureed. Probably ended up with a bit more than a cup but I thought it perfect. I added 1 teaspoon vanilla like MANY other posters, used butter instead of the oil and used only 1 cup of sugar and thought it was plenty sweet. Also sliced up some bananas very thinly and placed them on top right after pouring the batter in. Gave it a nice look but isn't necessary.

I've made this several times. Also, when I made this, I didn't have any measuring cups (just moved country) so had to guess. Apparently, guessing helps, as the bread was so moist and delicious! I purposefully buy bananas to go brown so I can make this bread. My brother in law, who says the only banana bread that is good is his grandmother's (she passed away 6 years ago) and he said he LOVES this bread. I followed the recipe, except I added vanilla (1-2 tsps) and also coated the greased pan with sugar. Absolutely perfect! I did find that it took less time to cook it, but that might be my oven and low altitude.   I definitely recommend this recipe!

Not what I would think of as a traditional banana bread with the changes many recommend, but its very good.  I did the recommended 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar, subbed apple sauce for oil, sprinkle of cinnamon, and a tiny bit of vanilla.  Its so good!

Loved this recipe for banana bread - I have made many different recipes and this is at the top.  Made exactly as the recipe stated the first time but on the second batch, I added a little cinnamon.

I love, love, love, love this recipe for banana bread!  I cannot count the number of times family, friends and co-workers have asked me for this recipe and I have guided them to this site.  The only thing different from the recipe is I substitute 1 teaspoon of white vinegar with 1/3 cup of milk for five minutes (as suggested by another reviewer) for the buttermilk.

This is a wonderful banana bread recipe. I doubled the recipe for 2 pans but could have divided the batter up into 3 pans since I had some spill over with my pans.

My five year old granddaughter voted this the best banana bread ever! Wonderfully moist and full of flavor. The batter is similiar to that of a cake. I took the suggestion of another and substituted l/2 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar for added flavor. Sprinkled loafs with sugar crystals before baking for an added crunch on top. Made 3 mini loafs, decreasing baking time to 40-45 minutes. This is a must try recipe for banana bread lovers!

I made this for the holidays (I made mini loafs and put them in my gift baskets with various cookies and fudge) and it turned out great!  It is a smooth moist bread with great flavor that is good anytime.  Everyone who has tried has said how much they like it.

I have used my grandmother's recipe for years, but this one is an excellent alternate in which I can reduce the fat.  I doubled the recipe which worked fine and baked it in two separate bread tins.  When doubling the recipe, I used 4 bananas, and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce instead for the prescribed amount of oil.  I also took another reviewer's suggestion to use 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the sugar amount.  Chewy outside is delicious!  Will definitely use this recipe again when I have overripe bananas!

I have made this several times and keep forgetting to rate it, but there will be no other banana bread recipe used in my house.  This is so moist and also freezes well.  For my oven the cooking time is a little off, but that is ok.

If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!!!  It was great!!!  I added a little vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It didn't take quite that long to cook, but I think that my loaf pan was a little smaller than what the recipe called for because I had enough batter to make six muffins too.  No big deal though.  I baked the muffins for about 20-25 min. and the loaf about 55-60 minutes!!!  I have used a lot of banana bread recipes, but this is the best!!!! Thanks!!

I'm absolutely not the best person in the kitchen.  After all, I'm a  single guy just trying to figure out how to boil water.  Anyway, I love banana bread and decided to try out this recipe.  It's super easy and best of all - it tastes great.  And, it's mom approved, as my mom tested it out a few months back and loved it.  In fact, she asked me to make it again for her.  I've actually made it for a few friends of mine and they loved it.  I definitely recommend giving it a try.

I am not much for  giving five  stars to recipes that you  have to  change. I  did  think 1  cup sugar was plenty. Any  more and that is all you  would taste.  I was  looking  for  a  recipe that uses  buttermilk I  have on hand but I did have to make too  many  changes to  give this five stars. 1/2  cup  buttermilk, 3/4 cup oil, 2 cups flour, 1 tsp.  vanilla and a bit of cinnamon make it good. I am not much for making  things healthier either  anymore. Just eat  less of the real thing. Applesauce  in place  of  oil just has never done it for me. Also, keep in mind if you do sub brown  sugar  that type of sugar  has more  moisture  so you will get a different texture.

This is one awesome recipe.  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I made sour milk with lemon juice and I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  Other than that, I followed everything else to the letter.  Doubled the recipe and made it in a bundt pan. Thanks for posting this, Rose.  This one is a keeper.

I wouldn't say that this is the BEST ever, but it is definitely a keeper in my book! My bread came out very fluffy and moist but slightly chewy on the outside. Really different than what Mom always makes, but really good. I added vanilla, but it seems to me missing something... I'll definitely keep experimenting to figure out what that something is! But definitely a great recipe.

Absolutely wonderful! Even with making a few changes of my own, this still turned out moist and delicious! In an attempt to make it healthier, I made the following changes: use 1 egg, 2 egg whites rather than 2 eggs; use 1/3 cup vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk; use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose; no nuts. I meant to use 4 egg whites, but I broke the yolk of the first one so I just used 2 egg whites with the 1 egg. Next time I will try using applesauce in place of the oil, and just to try a different flavor, I'll use 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar.

I played around with ingredients as well, using half whole-wheat flour, cutting the sugar in half, and using half brown sugar/half white sugar.  I also added about 50% more bananas.  It's such a great recipe, it's easy to modify it to your needs.  It came out moist and dense like those loaves you buy presliced at the grocery store bakery.  Unbelievably delicious.  This was fantastic hot and cold, and froze perfectly for 2 months wrapped in foil.  I adore this recipe - now everybody wants my banana bread.  I recommend bakign into mini-loaves, so that it doesn't disappear quite so fast!

This is truly the best banana bread ever. I used skim milk instead of butter milk and it was still so moist and yummy. I put a bit of cinnimon, nutmag and 1tsp of vanilla. Will use everytime I make banana bread. Thank you

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HIT!!  By a HIT I mean, there was not even a crumb left!  Everyone loved it!  It was super moist and sweet and delicious!  I did  add a little more bananas (about 1/3 of a cup more) and about to 2 tlbs of the brown sugar.  I kept everything else the same.  I usually don't like to do first time recipes for big events...but I lost my old recipe during our move to MD from FL...THIS IS now my new favorite recipe!

Agreed--great banana bread.  I followed the suggestion of adding 1 tsp of cinnamon, substitued 1/2 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar and added a tsp of vanilla.   Turned out excellent, thanks for the recipe!

Amazing banana bread!  I've made many different versions of banana bread but this one takes the cake....or bread rather.  :)  Similar to some of the other reviewers I also added cinnamon nutmeg and a splash of vanilla and substituted the pecans for walnuts.  I also used 3 bananas instead of the one cup.  I also mixed cinnamon, brown sugar and chopped walnuts to add to the top which made for a nice crunchy topping.  Delicious!  I will definitely be making this again!

I did everything as the recipe calls for except I used 1 cup brown sugar with 1/2 cup white sugar. I baked for one hour and it was delish! Will definitely make again.

WOW! I used this recipe because it called for buttermilk.  (Fun fact:  Buttermilk is lower in fat and calories than milk.)  I did add vanilla and some cinnamon (personal preference).  This recipe was perfectly moist and definately lived up to its name.

Three simple words to describe this bread --"OH MY GOSH!"  Couldn't have a better name!  I have tried numerous recipes for banana bread over the years and have never found the "perfect" one.  Now I have!  Made some very simple alterations...  Subbed half the white sugar for brown sugar.  Makes bread a beautiful dark color.  Added just a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Also because I live in a VERY high altitude area I added about a 1/4 cup more flour as I always do to breads, cakes, or cookies!  One more little change..instead of buying buttermilk I used the buttermilk powder I had on hand.  I sifted the powder with the dry ingredients...then added the amount of water needed to the liquid mixture. It worked fine!  Also double the recipe and it worked ok...just make sure you have a pretty heavy duty mixer...cuz it makes a lot!!

This is truly THE best banana bread I've made... I'm always looking for new ways to make it... then returning to the tried & true in my BHG cookbook...but this is the first time I've seen BUTTERMILK as an ingredient!  I made the recipe exactly as written, save the one change I made to the sugar that I subbed with splenda for my husband who watches sugar intake.  He raved about it (I suggested decreasing the sweetener because I personally found it a little TOO sweet... and he strongly disagreed)... and while I personally noticed the splenda before the bread had cooled, I did NOT notice it afterwards, with a little spread on it. Just a note, it took less than an hour in a glass bread pan.  Thank you for such a wonderful idea!

great recipe.  I was always taught to cook the bread in tinfoil and allow it to cool in wrapped in this foil for a more dense, darker bread.

This is definitely the best banana bread! After pouring the batter in the pan I mixed together 1 tlbs. brown sugar, 1 tlbs. white sugar, 3 tbls. chopped pecans and 3/4 tsp. cinnamon and sprinkled it on top of the batter. It's a MUST! The cooking time was perfect.  This is my favorite recipe from this site. Will be making again too soon!

This is one of the best recipes that I have come across for banana bread; it makes a very moist and delicious loaf. I did make a couple of minor adjustments. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter, and I also sprinkled the loaf with a cinnamon-sugar mixture. Before removing the bread, I let it sit in the pan for 5 min, and I then let it cool on a rack for 10 min. Once it had cooled for 10 min, I wrapped the loaf in tin foil to allow the cinnamon-sugar mixture to moisten, rather than stay powdery. If you do not have pecans on hand, walnuts make a good substitute. Also, I found that 2 bananas equaled a cup. This recipe can also be used to make muffins, which come out equally as delicious as the loaf.

This banana bread was one of the best and easist I've ever made.  I had 3 large banana's and that was more than enough.  The 9 x 5 pan was almost too small.  I had another slightly larger one and would recommend that.  Also, that seemed like a lot of sugar so I used a half cup of splenda and it turned out fabulous anyway.  It rose above the pan but kept its shape and everyone raved about it.

I've tried other banana bread recipes on this site, but this is hands-down the best!  I only had 1 over-ripe banana I wanted to use so I cut the recipe in half and put the batter into 2 smaller-sized bread pans.  I also added vanilla to the wet ingredients. (I didn't have buttermilk so I added lemon juice to regular milk).  Sprinkled some mixed spice and coarse bakers sugar on top and it was a delectable treat!  This will be my standard banana bread recipe from now on!

This recipe is good but not spectacular. There are better recipes on this website (there is one using cream cheese as an ingredient that is the best).  But I had all these ingredients on hand and I had some very ripe bananas so this is the one I chose.  Very moist, good banana flavor without being too banana-y.  I followed the recipe exactly but it might be a tad bit better with a splash of vanilla in the batter. One thing it wasn't is attractive - Mine did not dome at all and so the top was super flat.  I made a double recipe and it made 8 mini loaf pans. I like using the mini loaf pans because I seem to get a more even bake.  With the big pans, the edges and sides seem to get too done while the middle remains doughy.  I brought this bread to work this morning and everyone raved about it.  It is very tasty and also very easy to make.  You can put it all together and get them in the oven in less than 15 minutes.

I've made this recipe a couple times now, and each time it has turned out the same.  It tastes pretty good, but sinks down in the middle.  It looks really bad.  I will go with a different recipe from now on.

This was a really good banana bread. I used regular milk instead of the butter milk and I used 2 tsp of baking powder instead of the baking soda. The bread came out nice and big.  I will make this again. Did not use nuts.

Really good. Made a few tweeks... 1/2 whole flour and 1/2 all purpose white flour.. added vanilla and cinnamon..only 1c of sugar... used less oil and more buttermilk.. not sure what it measured out to, but i used 3 browned bananas. Also, added a butter, brown sugar and oat topping to the loaf. Turned out great! (I have a hard time following a recipe to the tee.)

THIS IS SO YUMMY! I have tried lots of banana bread recipes but this is definitely the best one yet.  I made a few changes: used 1/4 cup applesauce + 1/4 cup oil, cut the sugar down to 1 cup, used 1 cup all-purpose flour + 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour, and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Update: I made muffins with this recipe and they turned out great! It made 16 muffins and they took about 20 minutes to cook!

A very good recipe. To this point, I thought my mom's recipe was the best, but now I am on the fence :-). I used 1/2 cup of soured milk (put 1/2 tbsp of white vinegar in a measuring cup, and filled to 1/2 cup with 2 % milk) and 1/3 cup of vegetable oil. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, as well as 1 tsp of vanilla. I did add the pecans. A worthy way to use up those softened bananas.

Doubled the recipe,  substituted unsweetened store-bought applesauce for half the oil, and reduced sugar to 1 cup per loaf.  Used 3 medium-large very ripe (over 75% brown peel) bananas (a very full 2 cups mashed).  Delicious!  Very banana-y and still sweet enough for my 4-year old to ask for more "cake".

Ooh this is soo yummy! I didn't have buttermilk so I used plain yogurt. It had a very light, moist texture. I will definately reduce the amount of sugar next time to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2. It was a little too sweet, and I even like sweet! Excellant recipe, thank you!

The name says it all!  My only change is to substitute unsweetened applesauce for shortening.  This is my make all the time banana bread recipe.  Turn this into carrot bread using an equal amount of shredded carrots in place of the bananas - everyone will rave!

I substituted half of the oil for applesauce to lower the fat. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, & 2 pinches of allspice. A cream cheese based icing is great for an a sweeter treat alternative.

Seriously! THE BEST EVER! I too doubled the recipe and took the advice from Georgia by adding cinnamon, vanilla, and substituted the oil for apple sauce. I just can't explain how yummy this is! And whoever said it's the best the next day, yes it is! My co-workers, husband and neighbors love it! Thanks to Rose, I will definately be making this again.

The amount of oil can be decreased as it was a little greasy at the bottom of the bread.  Other than that, a great tasing banana bread!

I have made this twice--with just one cup of sugar and with walnuts in place of the pecans, and it really is the best banana bread recipe.  I have made many, and I was very skeptical when I saw this recipe without vanilla or any spices.  However, I think this is testament that sometimes the simplist recipes are the best!

Excellent recipe to play with! We added chocolate chips instead of pecans, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups white, 1/2 cup sucanat, upped the buttermilk to 1/2 cup, used 1/3 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup lite olive oil instead of the 1/2 cup of oil, and added 1/4 dutch process cocoa. Tasty!!!!

I've tried many banana bread recipes from this website and many were good, but I do think I liked this best so far.  I doubled the recipe (why make one when you can make two) but kept the sugar at 2-1/2 cups (1-1/2 white and 1 brown).  I also added 2 tsps vanilla.  The breads turned out moist with a very nice flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe for banana bread.  It always comes out moist, however, I have to cook it a bit longer than what it requires.  I have made this many times and will continue!!

I am a banana bread junkie!!! I am also on the quest for the best banana bread. This bread is good, but 1 hour 20 min. is too long to bake. It got too brown on the sides. I advise to put foil on top, loosely, after 45 minutes & then check after 1 hour. Maybe I'll try again this way. I do like Sour Cream Banana Bread & Oatmeal Banana Bread - both on this site.

This truly is the BEST banana bread!  I have made this several times and it comes out perfectly every time.  The bread bakes evenly throughout (no gooey or dry parts) which is a problem I've had with other recipes.  It is very flavorful and moist.  I also sprinkle brown sugar on the bottom of the pan and a dash of cinnamon into the batter.  I highly recommend this one!

I doubled this recipe since I had several ripe bananas.  It was great for us, since my husband and I thought it was terrific!  I also added a cinnamon/sugar mixture to the pan before adding the mixture.  Earlier in the day I made a Monkey Bread Recipe on this site and had leftovers begging to be used.  This is the second recipe I am saving to my on-line collection.  Try it, you'll like it!!

This recipe did not work well for me. I think it was because I am at 7300 ft elevation. Maybe I'll cut back on the sugar.  It did have a good texture. i'm sure it would be great if i tried it at a lower elevation.

I’ve been trying lots of different recipes for banana bread and this one turned out perfect!  Our favorite so far!  I did make some modifications / substitutions as follows:
Since EVERYTHING’s better with butter, I substituted butter for the oil and creamed the sugar, butter and eggs together with some vanilla extract and a touch of ground cardamom and cinnamon and nutmeg.  I made a double batch but only used the amount of sugar recommended for 1 batch.  Did 1 cup white sugar and a half cup brown sugar.  In addition to the baking soda, I added some baking powder and got an absolutely perfect rise.  After I started the recipe I realized I only had 3 bananas = 1 cup and I needed an additional cup.  I had apple sauce on hand and put in a cup of that. (Next time I’ll make sure I have more bananas!).  I also added some chocolate chips along with the chopped pecans.  Lastly, I baked at 350 instead of the recommended 325.  Heavenly!

Proves you don't need butter or sour cream, this recipe is perfect , super moist and flavorful.  As always, I didn't have exact ingredients: used milk w 1 TB apple vinegar for the buttermilk, and olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Did you know you can just throw ripe bananas in your freezer w peels on and make this recipe every time you have 3 bananas?  When they thaw, the peel just slips right off.

I have made this recipe—exactly as the recipe is written—numerous times, and it really is the very best banana bread ever!  My friends and family all agree with me. However, I do double the recipe and bake it in a bundt pan—at the same temperature and for the same amount of time. Delicious!

I followed the recipe and it was a massive failure. The batter does not cook quickly enough to provide support and it ended up flowing over the sides of the loaf pan and sinking in the middle. I posted photos in my photo log. Terrible. I won’t try that again.

I choose to make this recipe to use up some buttermilk I had on hand.  I used 3 medium-small bananas.  Two wasn't quite a cup and three was a bit more than a cup.  I did add some vanilla and cinnamon.  I had to tent the loaf with foil the last 30 minutes to prevent over browning.  The crust  was a little harder than I like but the inside was light and just the right texture.

Loved this! Definitely need to grease and flour thoroughly! I found it a bit sweet, especially with the the chocolates sprinkled on top. However I found the chips sank. Next time I'm going to try subbing in some brown sugar. I added a 3rd average size banana because I like a stronger banana flavour and I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon just for the darkened colour. The bread took the full 1hr and 20 minutes to bake in my oven. Enjoy!

Great base recipe for banana bread! No matter how you twist it, it will turn out great! I followed the recipe exactly the way it is the first time, super yummy so second time I used wholewheat flour, added blueberries and plain yogurt instead of buttermilk; it's more flavourful and dense, yet healthy. Look no further :) this is the recipe you go.

Really is the "Best Ever Banana Bread" 5 Stars just as written!!  It's easy and fast to make. TIP:  I love to save my over-ripe bananas in the freezer (in a freezer bag and peels removed)  until I have 3 bananas which= just over 1 cup of mashed bananas!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe Rose!!

Our very very picky 7 yr old son LOVED this!  #1 I'm thrilled he even bothered to try something different and new but the fact he was so proud of himself for trying and liking it! 

I made my own buttermilk since I did not have store bought on hand and I used 1/2 brown and 1\2 white sugar. These were the only 3 things I did differently :)

I have made this banana bread four times and each time it was wonderful.  I realized that I have only been adding 1 cup of sugar instead of what the recipe calls for.  But the taste is still wonderful.  Instead of the buttermilk I substitute Greek yogurt.  I LOVE this bread!

I have made this bread several times.  It is my absolute favorite banana bread!  Have tried different banana bread recipes, but now I only use this one!  Not only does it taste the best, the ingredients are things I usually always have on hand.  It is THE BEST!

Okay. This really is the best banana bread I've ever had. I made it for my family and they absolutely loved it as well as my very selective grandmother and diabetic father-in-law. It's incredibly moist it freezes well it's great for young kids who need something soft to eat but also eat with your parents it's awesome I've already made three loaves and two weeks!

Love, love this recipe. Most banana bread recipes are dry but the oil makes this one very moist and delicious. I usually don't have buttermilk so I use the old trick of adding vinegar to the milk and it turns out great. A comforting recipe that reminds me of home. =)

Didn't have any buttermilk so we substituted sour cream in the same measurement. Perfect! My ten-year-old daughter did everything herself and was so proud of how quickly the loaf disappeared!

Our family and friends love this banana bread. It's very true it does live up to its name. We added a teaspoon of vanilla to bring out the flavor of the bananas. The full ripeness from very dark bananas make the best bread . The sweetness  is fully pulled out of the over ripe stage. Sometimes we add pecans and sometimes we don't . Either way the bread stays  moist and slices perfectly. This is the BEST VIDEO ever made for easy to follow directions. Congrats to whom ever came up with this .

This is very, very good and easy to make. Only change I made (a matter of personal taste and no reflection on the original recipe) was to add a teaspoon of rum flavoring-just because I like the combo of bananas and rum.

Easy to make and tastes good.  I did cut down on the sugar by 1/4 cup because I added an extra banana so I had banana all the way to the top of a 1 cup liquid measuring cup.  Frosted it with home made cream cheese frosting with 1 teaspoon of added orange extract to the frosting.  YUMMY! Frosting:  1 8 oz stick cream cheese 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter 1.5 cups powdered sugar 1 T milk.  1t orange extract.  Blend all together.

Every time I have made this recipe it wows everyone. I believe the buttermilk is the key ingredient. I highly recommend this recipe if you want a perfectly moist and amazing tasting crowd pleaser. I have found that it needs to bake a little longer but that could be my oven.  Additionally I like to butter the sides of the loaf pan and dust with cinnamon sugar before baking.

My family LOVES this recipe! The only real difference is that I use applesauce instead of oil.  I never have buttermilk on hand, so I do the 1/2 tbsp white vinegar with enough skim milk to make 1/2 c (let it sit 5 minutes)then just use 1/3 c for the recipe.  I, also, wait until the bananas are over-ripe for the sweetest bread. It also works well for muffins, just reduce time to 25-30 minutes.

I altered this by substituting organic applesauce for 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 of the oil, and I used brown sugar instead of white
Like my mother did.  I also added one teaspoon of vanilla.  It was very moist and delicious.

This was terrific! Tried it because i didn't have butter or shortening to hand. I doubled the recipe and made half into muffins with chocolate chips for my niece and nephew and half into a loaf for my dad. The texture was perfect, dense but not heavy, and the flavor was great. I don't usually modify recipes before i try them, but i did cut the sugar a fair bit here and no one missed it. This is now my go-to banana bread recipe. Love it!

I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted for regular milk.  I also didn't have vegetable so I substituted for canola oil.  I also had to quadruple the recipe because I had quadruple the bananas.  Great banana bread though, my boyfriend loves it! (:

My GO TO RECIPE for banana bread it truly is the best and the bread never lasts long because everyone loves  it... I occasionally change it up (even though its great as it is) I just add 1/2-2/3 cup more of banana. Instead of pecans I use walnuts I also add some mayo just to make it super moist... I always make this in double/triples so I add some other things when splitting the batter depending on the people I make it for I've added chocolate chips/reeses/snickers, cinnamon pretty much everything but the kitchen sink! The only thing I believe this recipe is missing would be vanilla other then that its great I just add the little "extras" to change it up

Top browned while middle was still liquid. It is now done but with very dark crust. It taste like generic store bought bread. I will not make this recipe again. I will make French Toast out of this batch in the morning. I hope if I dipped it in captain crunch and put PB in the middle I can salvage it.

Absolutely delicious. We didn't have enough pecans, so we added a 1/4 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. What a great breakfast that was. We had to beat the kids away from it with a stick. :)

Excellent! Very moist and flavorful. I followed some suggestions and added vanilla and cinnamon,adjusted the white sugar to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I made four mini loaves, which baked in approximately 40 minutes.

This was amazing.  First time making banana bread and I'm glad I choose an excellent recipe; I've made this more than 10 times and everyone loves it.  Unfortunately I usually don't have white sugar or buttermilk but I substituted for 2%milk/whole milk and brown sugar.  Still very delicious so not sure if the buttermilk would make a difference.  Awesome recipe Rose!

I understand that ratings should be based on the original recipe, but there is benefit in doing both--recognizing a recipe for its general value but adding additional value in changes that enhance the original recipe.  Thank you Rose for this recipe!  And thank you to all the reviewers who offered additional enhancements!  I baked this with apple sauce instead of oil, and added some cinnamon and replaced a third of the sugar with brown sugar.  All minor changes, and with or without these changes, this is a great recipe.
I'm not sure why the original recipe suggested 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook, but I would say no more than 60 minutes is needed.

I thought it was good. The second time I too cut down on the sugar and added a few spices,cooking it the usual 350 degrees for an hour. However, I also thought Motherbeans' review was mean and condescending. Helpful reviews don't put down the rest of the people like they are uncultured idiots. Better just to have left out the snarky comment about satifying palates of one used to eating out. What does that do the help? Nothing. Just describe the too much sugar and the other things and keep your snobbishness to the country club. Other "experts" don't treat people this way. We're all trying to learn here and have some fun doing it.

OMG, this really is what everyone is saying, the BEST banana bread ever.  I did tweek a little after reading reviews. I used the yogurt instead of buttermilk, added 1 tsp Vanilla, Cinnamon, and some ground nutmeg. I did 3/4 cup each sugar white and dark brown.  I mixed the sugars together and sprinkled the bottom of the loaf pan with sugars. Gave it a sweet crispy crunch on bottom. (should have done the top too)  I happen to have walnuts so I tossed those in also. It came out so moist and flavorful.  Cant wait to make it again!

I just tried this and it is very good. I followed a couple of other suggestions and  used plain yogurt because I was out of buttermilk and I too reduced the sugar to 1 cup. It turned out delicious and my hubby said it was the best ever. I made 3 little loaves and reduced the cooking time to 35 min. They were perfect.

I’ve made this exactly as written, many times, and it always turns out fantastic every time. This time I made muffins, baked for 25 minute and they each rose perfectly, beautiful golden brown and taste heavenly. I’m not fond of sifting but it’s worth it. If you don’t have a sifter then use a whisk to get the dry ingredients fluffy/airy. If you prefer your muffins less sweet than just add less sugar. Family loves it exactly as written.

First time making this bread. I thought a cup and a half of sugar was much too much, do I reduced it to just one cup. I'm glad I did because it was sweet but not overly. This bread was really delicious, I'll be making it many more times.

I love this recipe!! I liked it the way it is written and made it that way the first time (no nuts). I also made it again with additions of my own and recommendations from other reviewers. I added a tsp cinnamon and 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar also a tsp of vanilla. I do agree that the sugar can be cut down a little if you find it too sweet. It had great banana flavor.

This is the best I've made so far.  I've tried others and not as good.  The first time I always follow the exact recipe.  Now I always add an extra banana if possible and make sure they are very ripe.   I follow the recipe as is except use a little less sugar.  I've also added chocolate chips, got rave reviews on this.

This really is the most delicious banana bread. It is one of the few recipes that I make as written-you don't need to change a thing! I will say that sometimes I probably go over on the amount of banana, but that's because I don't bother to measure it. I just use 3 bananas, so depending on the size of them that day, it may end up being a bit more than a cup but the bread turns out absolutely perfect every time.

It was my first time trying banana bread, and I swear, it will probably be the best out of all I try in the future. The outside was crunchy, and the inside was soft and VERY moist. All I added was 1/2 tsp of vanilla and i sprinkled the pan with some granulated sugar before pouring the batter, to make it crunchier, with a little bit of sweetness. This was also because I cut out 1/2 a cup of sugar in the recipe because I thought it was unnecessary. The over-ripe bananas plus 1 cup of sugar was plenty enough to satisfy my sweet cravings. Overall, this was a great recipe!

I thought this recipe turned out great!  I substituted butter for the oil...it was yummy.  To motherbeans:  all you have to do is wrap it in foil overnight, and it will be moist on the outside, too.  I kind of liked the crispy edges when it was still warm!  Also, I didn't have pecans, so I used English walnuts - actually my favorite - and it was pretty scrumptious that way.

I tried this for the first time today with some bananas I had previously frozen & thawed out. The loaf came out gorgeous, moist, and delicious.

I used applesauce in place of oil, but it was so sticky and gross consistency...will not even waste good ingredients trying it again, very disappointing:(

So disappointing! I followed this recipe exactly, although I had to make my own buttermilk (1/3 cup milk with 1 tsp. lemon juice...let sit for 5 minutes), which is a standard substitute. For as much sugar as is in this recipe, it was not as sweet and did not have as strong of a banana taste as I would've liked. I prefer really moist, almost creamy banana bread, and this was not that moist. The crust around the sides did get kinda crispy, which was yummy, due to the high sugar content. 

I added the optional pecans, which I think made the bread seem even more dry. I like pecans, but did not like their flavor in this bread.

I will keep searching for a more moist, stronger banana-flavored bread.

I made this recipe for my kids who have lots of food restrictions.  I substituted rice milk with a bit of vinegar for the buttermilk, and Costco all-purpose gluten-free flour mix for the wheat flour.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out AMAZING!  I couldn't tell that it was gluten-free!  Seriously!  It was so moist!  It was hands down the best banana bread I've ever had, and it was GLUTEN-FREE!  Amazing.  I would highly, highly recommend it.

This bread absolutely lived up to it's name! It's moist and flavorful without being gooey and the texture is perfect.  My family doesn't normally care for nuts so I chopped mine more finely to minimize the crunch - and they loved it!  I find myself buying extra bananas just to have an excuse to make more bread.  This will make wonderful Christmas gifts for our neighbors.

this is the first time I made banana bread and my family loved this recipe, I did however substitute the oil with applesauce, because in the middle of making this I realized I was out of oil, and I also added some chopped walnuts and a splash of vanilla, I cant wait for the holidays to get here so I can make this for my gift baskets that I give to my family instead of the usual cookies only basket...

Wonderful, great tasting banana bread. I made one modification - I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, and it tasted delicious. Less sugar allowed the flavor of bananas and buttermilk to surface.

I followed the recipe pretty exactly - I only added a dash of vanilla and a bit of cinnamon - but for some reason it came out too salty. I had doubled checked myself when making the bread, so I don't think it was an error of adding too much salt on my part. I also double checked my flour to make sure I didn't accidentally buy self-rising (which has salt added), and it was all-purpose. I'm sure what caused my bread to have such a salty tang to it, but this is definitely not my new favorite recipe.

This is a great recipe.  One thing that I added is a mixture of cinnamon and sugar on the top.  I mix together about 3 tbs of sugar, sprinkle in some cinnamon and sprinkle over the top prior to baking.  Yum! Yum!

The moistest, most flavorful banana bread I've ever tried! The only changes we made were to use 1 tsp vinegar in the milk (since we did not have buttermilk) Let it sit out on the counter for about 5 min before use. We also omitted 1/2 cup sugar since the overripe bananas make it plently sweet enough! That's all! Delish!

This really is excellent!!! You can make your own buttermilk with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice. Add 1 cup milk, stir let stand 5-10 mins. Then it's ready to use.

Really this is the perfect Banana Bread. No need to look any further, I promise you.  It's not greasy, it's tastes of bananas, not spices.  It is tender and somewhat dense on the inside with the outside baking up a beautiful golden brown.  Perfect just as it is, no need to mess around with it.  However, this is a great recipe to tweak to your tastes.  You can reduce the sugar to 1 cup without sacrificing sweetness, and I have found I prefer it this way.  Try doing 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar; it imparts a darker sweetness that is nice.  You can add vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg-so many variations for one go to recipe.  Add this one to your recipe box, 'cause it's a keeper!

I've been making this fabulous recipe for years since finding it in a Taste of Home magazine.  Two very minor differences in that published version:  the addition of 1 tsp. of vanilla with wet ingredients, and it calls for 1 C of walnuts instead of 1/2 cup pecans. I wrap the cooled loaf tightly in foil, and we wait until the next day to eat it.  That wait is torture, but it really intensifies the moistness and deep banana taste.  (By the way, for you cooks who like to lick the bowl, this uncooked batter may just become your favorite - it surely is mine.)

I tried this recipe and added more bananas (they were extra, extra ripe) and added a little vanilla and cinnamon. The bread did take longer than stated but the taste was amazing!! This did not last very long in my house!! (in a good way).  Husband asking when I'll make this again--that's the best compliment!!  A real keeper at my house.

Delicious recipe. Followed the recipe exactly except I don't have access to buttermilk so I used another reviewer's suggestion of mixing vinegar with the milk and letting it sit for 5 minutes. Awesome awesome awesome banana bread!

My teenage son is a banana bread connoisseur, and his eyes grew wide after one bite, and he mumbled through the second while giving a big thumbs up.  I am not sure the loaf will be allowed to completely cool before it is gone.  I did omit the nuts and had to substitute vinegar+milk for buttermilk since I am 30 miles from the nearest grocery store, but otherwise followed it to the letter.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very good banana bread.  I made the following modifications.  I use 4 bananas (more than what is called for in the original recipe); instead of 1.5 cups white sugar, I use 1 cup of Splenda and 0.5 cup brown sugar; plus I add 1 tsp vanilla and 0.5 tsp cinnamon.  Everything else is the same.  It's super moist and very flavorful!  A family favorite.

Excellent!!! I doubled the recipe and am glad I did.  I used 6 ripe bananas, didn't measure.  Baking time was perfect.  I added a little vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg--personal preference.  Definitely a keeper!

This is EXACTLY the type of BB I was looking for, and is incredible! I will never use another recipe again. It is dark in color, has a nicely crunchy caramelized crust, full banana flavor, and is tender and moist. Its also super easy and fast to put together. I modified the recipe as follows: 
1 C dark brown sugar
1/2 C white sugar
1/4 C Canola Oil
1/4 C Vegetable Oil
In place of Buttermilk, I used 2% Milk with 1 Tble. Vinegar added.

I made this recipe exactly as written (don't think it's fair to write a review when you've changed a million things). The outer crust of the bread was crunchy and so, so yummy and the inside was dense and moist. I will definitely be making this one again, thank you!

My daughter made this one and everyone raved over it. Great way for us to use up some over ripe bananas and some buttermilk. Used walnuts instead of pecans. Thanks!

Made according to the recipe - very easy. Super tasty - moist inside, perfect crust. And holy , it is rich. This is not a loaf you're gonna eat in one sitting. Will make again.

I made this with some modifications. I cut down the oil to a 1/3 cup and used 1/4 cup each of brown and white sugar. It turns out great every time!

WOW! I didn't have all ingredients on hand so I substituted eggnog for the buttermilk, brown sugar for the white sugar, used extra virgin coconut oil rather than regular vegetable oil, used three whole bananas, and added 1 cup of chocolate chips, then baked 1 hour at 350F.  No kidding, I was in heaven, so to speak! YOU MUST TRY THIS VARIATION!

Excellent recipe. Freezes really well. I followed Georgia's suggestions but substituted the pecans for chocalate chips - it is mostly for my kids! Turned out great!!

I'm only thirteen and I LOVE this recipe! It was sooo easy! I made this recipe once with my 8-year-old brother, then a second time with my younger sister. My family loves it! Thank you so much! I would absolutely recommend this recipe to anyone in search of a 5 star banana bread recipe

I was a little skeptical about this when I took it out of the oven.  I ended up having to cook it for about one hour and five minutes but my oven might be a little off.  Even then it looked like I had over cooked it on the outside and I almost threw it out.  I decided to cut it and try it.  This is the BEST banana bread I have ever had!  It was a little crunchy on the outside and really, really moist on the inside.  I didnt have buttermilk in my fridge but I made my own by adding one tablespoon of vinegar to a cup of milk and letting it sit for a minute.  I will definately be making this again!

Super yummy.  Has more sugar and oil than some of my other recipes so this is a 'sometimes treat'.  Consistency was great and the ends (yes, the ENDS) of the loaf were fantastic.  Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely delicious and everyone who ate it, oohed and aahed over it.  I did make a few changes for my own taste, I decreased the bananas slightly because I only had two.  I made a topping of coarse sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled it over the dough before baking! Mmm....

Made a double batch so we could freeze a loaf.  I used melted butter in place of the oil, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This came out really good!  I want to add a little vanilla next time, per others suggestions, also maybe a dash of nutmeg and/or cinnamon.  But overall, I'm really happy with this recipe, thanks for sharing it!

I just made this recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1/3 cup milk plus 1 T vinegar. I also added 1 t vanilla extract -- doesn't everything taste better with a dash of vanilla? I also shaved 5 minutes off the baking time. It may just be my oven, but I was concerned it was getting too brown. It is outrageously delicious! Thank you so much for sharing it!

So yummy!  I love that we can switch out the banana for a can of pumpkin, or a cup and a half of zucchini, and you totally change up the bread without too much work.  Love it!

Fantastic!  I doubled the recipe using a total of 4 1/2 cups of flour.  I used 2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and added 3 tsp. of allspice.  I used a total of 6 bananas.  Otherwise I doubled the ingredients I have not mentioned.  It turned out delish!

This really was probably the best banana bread I've ever had!  It was super moist and didn't last long at our house.  I substituted walnuts for pecans as I already had some chopped up and it was delicious.  I'm out of walnuts so I'll be using pecans this time but I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!  It's fabulous!

I've been looking for a good Banana Bread recipe for years now & now I'm Done looking! This is the all time Best & moistest recipe I've ever found. It ROCKS!! The only changes I did was to toast the nuts (I used walnuts) while I was mixing the ingredients. (10 min in the oven stirring once) & I also added 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips. This bread will only last ya 2 days tops before it's all gone. I'm sharing it with all my facebook friends! Loooove it!

I cooked this recipe as muffins and they turned out really good. They were perhaps a little too sweet for me but were still really good. Although I liked this recipe, I gave it four stars because I think the banana crumb muffins on allrecipes are a lot tastier and more healthy, too.

Made this tonight. Used 8 mini loaf pans, with enough for 5 muffins too. Used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown. That was only change I made. We couldn't wait until morning, hubby & I had to "test" one while warm. OMG!  So easy, and so moist. Will be making it again & again I'm sure.Thank you Rose, for a wonderful recipe!

Bummer!  Mine is already too brown is totally guey in the middle.  It could be my gas oven.  Also, the two ripe bananas I used went a little over a cup.  It is crispy on the sides and not done in the middle!  Any idea what I did wrong!

Great starter recipe. I only used 1/3 brown and 1/3 white sugar. The full 1 1/2 would be way too sweet. Also I added about 1 1/2 t of vanilla, sprinkled with mini chocolate chips and it was perfect.

THIS REALLY IS THE BEST BANANA BREAD RECIPE!! I've used many other recipes in the past but none of them are as good as this one! I doubled the recipe and was able to bake 7 mini loaves. These loaves were the moistest I've ever made or had! I made a couple of additions...I added mini chocolate chips to a loaf and finely chopped pecan pieces, cinnamon, and brown sugar to all of the tops for a crunchy bite! Soooooo yummy!!

There isn't anything I would change about this recipe.  This is the best darned banana bread -- ever!  I'm going to try to use this recipe for different breads, i.e. zucchini, squash pineapple, etc.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

This is a fabulous recipe.  The only changes I made were to substitute 1/2 cup of brown sugar for a 1/2 cup of the white and I scraped fresh vanilla bean seeds into it when mixing.  So flavorful.

Wow! This is really good! I baked this for a friend because he's been bugging me to bake him a banana bread, so I searched for the best recipe I could find. Of course I didn't try all of them, but this one caught my attention, so I tried it, and I'm SO glad I did. My friend was raving about how good it was. His mother tried some and insisted it was store bought because it was so good. My mother usually doesn't compliment me on my baking because she thinks she does it so much better, but she actually said that this was very good. Thanks so much for this recipe, and I will definitely make this again.

The best EVER!! I used butter instead of oil and I added coconut and nuts. 3 plumps ripe bananas gave it the MOIST texture of a divine carrot cake. Oh yeah 5 stars for sure.

I've finally tweaked this recipe so IMO it's perfection.
I used 1/4 c apple/pear sauce w/1/4 c oil
   "      1/2 c macadamia nuts
   "      1 t cinnamon
   "      1/4 t freshly grated nutmeg
Yummy, maybe next time a little toasted coconut on top! Aloha!

Very good! I didn't have buttermilk so I used a 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice and 1/2 cup milk, let sit for 5 minutes, and used 1/3 of a cup. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and no nuts. This was delicious. Will be making more of these!

This is by far the best banana bread I have ever made or had.  I stock up banana's in the freezer and make several loaves at once to freeze.  The only variation I make is not adding the pecans.  My husband calls it "pure unadulterated banana bread."

Finally found the right banana bread recipe!!!  The only thing I did different from the recipe was used light vanilla-flavored yogurt instead of buttermilk.  It was great!!  I also took someones suggestion for a crunchy topping....sugar, nuts, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Super easy and just delicious!  Thanks!

I have tried several banana bread recipes.  This is by far the best.  The flavor is perfectly balanced.  The texture is firm but tender.  Moist and not too heavy.  Forget the other recipes and let this be the one and only banana bread recipe you use.  You will not be disappointed!

Made this today but only the kids ate it. They said it was good and I agree. Also, I made half the recipe and made 8 muffins (but should have made only 6). Bake 325 degrees for 30 mins.

This is an excellent banana bread, very easy and very moist.  This will be the recipe I will use from now on.  Topped with sugar, cinnamon and nuts before baking as was suggested in another review and it was great.

This bread is very delicious. It was the first time that I have ever made bread and it turned out very good. If you use a glass bread pan I would recommend that the stove temp get turned down to 300F and cook it longer with foil on top, so the inside will finish cooking and the outside not brown too much

After reading some reviews, I decided to add some cinnamon and vanilla extract. This recipe turned out pretty good. It could use a little less sugar though.
Other than that, this was great!

My husband really liked this bread.  Flavorful and moist.  I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts.  I can't to try with the pecans.  I keep powered buttermilk on hand so that I always have buttermilk available.  Looks like I will be making this bread weekly.

I like this recipe even though I can't rate it on the exact ingredients. I didn't have buttermilk so I used a combination of yogurt and sour cream in place of the buttermilk. This recipe was very moist.

This is positively the best banana bread I have ever eaten.  It is really moist when it is first made, but gets even better every day (if it lasts that long).  I have made this banana bread many times and will never try another recipe.  You can't improve on perfection!

sooooo good! I had no buttermilk, so I used regular whole milk, and also omitted the pecans. My boyfriend says it's the best banana bread he's ever eaten and I'm inclined to agree.

This is the best banana bread ever.  I did make a few changes to make it a little healthlier - 1/2 C applesauce in place of oil, 1/2 white and 1/2 dark brown sugar, replace 3/4 cup of white flour with wheat flour.  I also added 1/4 sour cream and used walnuts.  I have also made this with the original recipe and it is the best banana bread too - named appropriately!!

Every time I make banana bread, this is the recipe I reach for!  Just a few changes - I use only 1 cup of sugar, and I hand-mill a combination of soft white wheat berries and spelt for the flour.  This really IS the best-ever banana bread!

The best banana bread I've ever made! Other than using half white and half brown sugar, I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfect - we didn't think it was overly sweet at all. Beautiful color, crisp on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. This will be a keeper next time I have extra buttermilk (and overly ripe bananas!) to get rid of. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I have never made banana bread, sampled alot of other recipes, but always dry. This recipe came out very moist and taste was great. I did mess up on this while making this recipe, thought i had enough flour but didnt so subutited 3/4 cup of bisquick mix for flour. (no time to go to store) i know sounds crazy.... but came out great.

I read through other reviews because my local store didn't carry buttermilk. I saw someone tried vanilla yogurt. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Good bread!

We made increased this recipe by 1.5 times and baked it in two pans - it still took about 1 hr 20 minutes. It's pretty good - I really like how it used oil instead of butter as oil is much, much cheaper, plus healthier, as well as easier to work with. Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful! The only differences that I did was I used bread flour and I didn't measure my bananas.  I used 3 nice size bananas and it turned out perfect.

This turns out very good.  Very moist and delicious.  We add extras to ours reguarly but the basic recipe is a great start.     Try adding peanuts, macadamian, pecan, etc. to your batter.  Also you can add a oatmeal type crumb topping to your bread halfway through the cooking process.  Sometimes we add chocolate or butterscotch chips to the topping.    This is really a delicious bread

I made this as directed, except I added a half cup of white chocolate chips and used a mini-loaf pan (made 8 small loaves). The white chocolate chips added some sweetness and seemed to melt out somewhat, so they were a bit too sweet. But even in the mini loaf pan, which sometimes seems to dry things out, these were very moist and delicious. My boyfriend just Hoovered two in quick order!

This recipe was very easy to make and came out very well. However I made some adjustments. I added some more banana, and also I felt the recipe was took plain so added cinnamon, nutmeg, and less than 1 tsp. of ground cloves. It came out great!

This is the best banana bread really.  I made it a few hours ago and have had two pieces already.  Only change I made was to use 3 bananas since I had them and didn't want to leave one out so I increased the flour by 1/4 cup to compensate the extra banana.  This bread has great flavor and texture.  Yum!

I wouldn't say it's the best ever but it's good. I added cinnamon and vanilla. Before you whine about how that's changing the recipe, I used this one solely because it uses oil instead of other fats. I do prefer the one with sour cream though. Thanks for sharing, I'll probably make this one a lot now as I don't have time anymore to remember to soften butter or buy sour cream!

I am not a Banana Bread lover, but I hated to waste a bunch sitting on my table, so I tried this recipe and Wow. I am converted it was terrific. I did change it a little using some ideas of another reviewer and added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and 1cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar.  It was terrific, moist and flavorful, my family enjoyed it as well and it was gone in 1 day!! Thank you

Great right out of the oven with a caramelized crust and moist interior. I know that most quick breads are wrapped and eaten the next day but when I tried a sliver off the end, I knew that it would lose that texture the next day...so we ate it :)

I had some very ripe bananas to use so  I tried this recipe. It is pretty tasty. I think I prefer regular banana bread to this but my kids liked it. I used low fat buttermilk instead of sour cream and it came out fine.

This is now my go to banana bread recipe! Very moist and delicious! The only thing I do differently is add cinnamon and vanilla. Don't get me wrong it is good without the addition but it's even better with it!

This was very sweet. I would cut back on the sugar next time. Maybe use some applesauce for some of the oil too.

I must have tried a dozen different banana bread recipes and this is by far the best, with the deepest, truest banana flavor. (I think recipes that use butter and vanilla somehow interfere with the banana flavor.) The second time I made this, I substituted low fat sour cream for the buttermilk. Plain vanilla yogurt would also work well, or you could add 1 tsp. lemon juice to 1/3 cup milk to create a quick buttermilk. (That's my trick for buttermilk pancakes.) For those who don't want to wait the 80 minutes for this to bake, try using a Bundt pan and turn up the heat to 350 degrees. It took 45-50 minutes, almost half the time, and the only difference was a slighty darker crust. After years of searching, this is now my go-to banana bread recipe.

Wow was this loaf moist and delicious.  It was better than any mix I've ever used and any recipes I've tried.  They've always been dry or bland, but this recipe was perfect.  You can make your own buttermilk - I didn't have any so I added 1/2 tbsp of white vinegar to the 1/3 cup milk and let it curdle for 5 minutes.  My husband said it was the best banana bread he's ever had.  Into the recipe box this one goes.  Thank you Rose!!

They were very  good.  I used 1/3 cup plain yogurt and 1/2 a cup olive oil instead of buttermilk and vegetable oil because I did not have any.  I sprinkled extra sugar b/c I was afraid my substitutions would make it not taste sweet.  I followed others advice and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  I also had extra soft bananas so I went over 1 cup/  I used 2 muffin pans and they were done cooking in 40 minutes.

I doubled the recipe and made 1 loaf and jumbo muffins adding vanilla and almond extracts and using banana cream pie flavored yogurt instead of the buttermilk.  I added chopped dates to the loaf and added pumpkin pie spice to the muffins as well as a struesel to the top of the muffins.  Very good, moist and tasty, both versions.

My family loves this recipe. I've made it in loaf, mini loaf and muffin form. Last time, I made muffins and topped them with crumbled gingerbread cookies, which was a nice twist. This recipe is easy, tasty and reliably good. Thank you!

My husband said this is the best banana bread he has ever eaten. That's quite a compliment!  I think it's the buttermilk that keeps it moist and flavorful.  It has become my new best banana bread recipe.

Loved it!  It was easy.  Great flavor!  Came out super moist.  I do wrap my bread in plastic wrap as soon as I pull it out of the pan.  I find that is makes the outer crust very moist.  We will keep making this one.

Very good recipe. Per other readers suggestions, I added the nut topping instead of nuts in the batter and an extra banana making it very moist.  I used part brown/part white sugar.  Not sure I'd do that again as it made the bread a darker brown and I had to explain to the kids that it's just darker in color and no it wasn't burnt.  Kids!!

It was fine - but too sweet and not as heavy and banana-y as I like.  More like a cake feel.

Brought the results of this recipe into work today and the 3 recipients hit me up for the recipe. I followed it to the T and they said it was the MOST MOIST banana bread they've ever had. One co-worker has been baking for many years and said in her attempts at banana bread, she has never been able to produce one this good. And I'm a novice cook.

I've made a lot of banana breads but this one takes the cake!  So perfectly moist with a nice chewy crust.  I followed others' advice and substituted 1/2 applesauce in place of oil, used whole wheat flour, added a little vanilla and left out the nuts--- Divine!

I added extra banana to put more flavor in. Tastes great; freezes well. I use powdered buttermilk that you just add water to. I put the powder in with the dry ingredients and the water with the wet. I also added dried cranberries to the mix....wonderful!

This banana bread is exellent! It was lacking flavor a little bit though. But, to fix that, almost every time I ate it, I ate it with lots of peanut butter! It truly tasted exellent! No lie!

I've used countless banana bread recipes, but this one remains at the top.  Just moist enough, with the buttermilk adding richness to it.  When we have family over, they directly ask for it -- it's been deemed "better than my childhood memories of mom's b-bread."  So I guess there's no reason to look for other recipes at this point! My only notes - reducing the sugar and making sure the bananas are overripe (I use 3, which is more than 1 cup), and a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg

This was fantastic!  I used this recipet, as I only had one bread pan.  (I will get another and double this recipe).  I had a pt. of fresh blueberries I wanted to use, so added them also.  It took about 10 min. longer to cook, but it came out DELISH!  My grandkids, who are all picky eaters, had 2 slices each and wanted more!  Unfortunately, it was all gone! A trick I learned from a friend, since I couldn't find a small container of buttermilk, I added about a t. of cider vinegar to the 1/3 C. of whole milk, and it takes the place of buttermilk!  I never have buttermilk on hand nor do I want to throw out the rest of a huge container of it!

For someone that doesn't bake very often this recipe was delicious.  I have made this bread several times, even without nuts and everybody loved it.  I thought I had done something wrong the first time because the inside of the bread was dark in color compared to the light color you would normaly see in bananna bread.  After making it several times, the consistancy and color was the same so I assumed I made it right from the start.

Wow!  This recipe is wonderful.  My bread came out light and moist with just enough banana flavor.  I did substitute the buttermilk with vanilla yogurt and a ½ cup of the sugar with honey and it was delicious.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This was awesome.  In the past 6 months I've experimented with atleast 15 banana bread recipes and this was the best.  I have always thought it was lame to give food away as a gift but 3 co-workers have said this is what they want for their birthday and 1 lady wants me to make several for her baby shower.

Just like its name this is the best ever banana bread.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular and it still came out fantastic.  Can't make it often though b/c I can eat the entire loaf by myself.

This is a great recipe.  I followed some of the suggestions and subbed in a little brown sugar for some of the white, wheat flour in place of some of the white flour, and did half oil, half applesauce.  I also dusted the pbread an with sugar and sprinkled some sugar and cinnamon on top before baking.  Good with chocolate chips too.  We can't get enough of it around here!

I love the taste of this bread, but my loaf fell in the middle. I live at high altitude so I will try this again and maybe add a little more flour..I hope it will work because this is great bread!

This banana bread is wonderful! While it was baking, I mixed a little bit of powdered sugar with a tiny bit of vanilla extract and a splash of the buttermilk I used in the bread and made a light glaze for the bread. It is out of this world! I put it on while it was still hot, and it hardens up a little, and is great!!! I would recommend it to anyone!!! (It makes it more like a dessert) Great stuff!!!

Very moist and lots of banana flavor. I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup and found that to be plenty.

I love this recipe. Although it is not extremely banana tasting, it is very 'moreish' where you just cant stop eating it. I did substitute the white sugar for 3/4 cup white and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. Added in some cinnamon and vanilla for a bit of flavor. It is definitely my favorite banana bread recipe, and I love that it doesn't call for butter, which is so expensive (for a poor student like myself!) so it becomes very economical!

Rose,this truly is the best banana bread ever! The only thing I changed was to add  a little extra banana to this since I love bananas. The buttermilk really makes it.   Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it as written before but this evening I replaced the white sugar with brown sugar and added some vanilla.  It gave it a really nice flavor.  It may be the "Best Ever Banana Bread"!

WOW, what a "cake"! I went to a Farmer's market and when I was leaving I found a whole box of bananas for $5.00 - the man I asked told me that they were the loose bananas left when customers selected a smaller bunch. The bananas were absolutely fine and with no blemishes, so I purchased the box with the intension of given them away at work - however, that was the week I had off, so I could not do that, so there sat the bananas getting riper and riper and between three of us could not finish them, so I looked for recipes as usual in AR, an I found this one - 16 loafs of bread later, one a 1/2 bag of nuts, 5 lbs of sugar, and same of flour, and I had almost a factory at home! I gave loafs to my family, my college nephews (who aske me for a concession to seld them at school!) and I freezed the rest. This is a fantastic banana bread, and the name is an understatement to the flavor!!! Thank you for a great recipe that will be in  my files as a "do it again, and again" recipe!

Moist, easy and fool proof. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of applesauce and a dash of cinnamon and vanilla extract to add moisture and flavouring.  I also stirred in chocolate chips - yummy!! Perfect for Banana Bread day!

I doubled this, used butter and added a tsp. each of vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon. (This is a gift for a friend and they like spicy banana bread.) It smells wonderful. This was easy enough for my eldest son to help with.

This really was great!  The first time I made it as is, and the second I added a tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp banana extract just for a little more oomph.

Can't say this was the best ever - just too sweet for my taste; however daughter and her hubby raved about it. It was definitely moist; I sprinkled chocolate chips over the top, very yummy, and also added a glazed icing with sprinkles on top since this was a birthday "cake". If I try this recipe again, I'll cut the sugar in half and sub applesauce for the oil as others have suggested.

My wife said this was "a piece of heaven!" when I first served it to her; she went on and on and said it was better than hers, which is no small feat. I doubled the recipe and used five bananas and a lunch-sized container of applesauce.  I also substituted demerara sugar, which is a coarser and browner than regular sugar and made a delightfully textured topping, and added some freshly grated nutmeg.  I was worried at first because the batter was thinner than I expected and it only filled a large loaf pan and one small one.  Plus the length of time and temperature were different than I'd seen before. Weeelll, safe to say, there was no problem.

i love this recipe!!! i used vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk, applesauce instead of oil and it turned out pretty good. i would reduce the amount of applesauce though because it was really moist...... but other than that change it is perfect!!!!

Very good. It is a little heavy on the oil for me. The second time I made it I was out of applesauce so I cut the oil in half and replaced it with more buttermilk. Turned out very good still but could use a little more doctoring for my taste, just want it a little lighter.

This was way too sweet even though I reduced the sugar by a quarter cup.  The flavour was nice but I thought it was still missing something like cinnamon and nutmeg.  Will make it again with these changes.

This bread just is NOT the "best ever" banana bread.  I have been baking for over 38 years now and have never had my banana bread doughy and undone in the center as this recipe produced. I had been baking breads before this one (my recipes) and they all turned out well except this one, so it was not the oven. I even tried it twice adding more time with the same effect-putting a foil tent over top to keep from getting too dark.

This was awesome! Using the reviews, i subbed apple sauce for oil, and plain yogurt for buttermilk, i was very impressed. Will make this again and again, a very easy recipe, with on hand ingredients, thanks! *UPDATE* still the best recipe ever; I now add a dash of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon!

This banana bread is delicious!  I made this recipe as written, in the loaf pan.  Then, I made it in a cupcake pan for banana muffins.  It cut down on cooking time dramatically.  It only took about 12 minutes!  The muffins were just as good as the loaf.  My daughter loved them so much, she asked for the muffins to be her birthday cupcakes.  I frosted them with cream cheese frosting and it turned out great!  Yum!

Really good, I made the following changes 1.  As someone suggested i did 3/4 sugar 3/4 brown sugar. Added vanilla and cinnamon.  Covered with a thin layer of cream cheese frosting from this site and drizzled with semi sweet chocolate glaze.

I loved this bread.  I added about a tsp. of vanilla, but didn't change anything else.  The crust was a little hard when I took it out of the oven, but I wrapped it in foil while it was still warm and it was perfectly soft the next day.

Excellent recipe.  I wasn't sure about putting the sugar with the dry ingredients or the 325 temp - but it works for this bread!  I added 1 tsp vanilla and choc. chips instead of pecans.  Delicious!

This was definitely good.  I think that I used bananas that weren't quite ripe enough since it didn't have enough of a banana taste for me.  Also, I had to cut down the cooking time to more like 1 hour and 5 min.  Still, bread was really good.

I used the exact ingredients that were called for. Baking time ended up about 1 hr 15 min. I doubled the recipe to make two loaves. I could have actually had 3 loaves by doubling it, but I only had 2 pans. My mom even admitted that this was the best she had ever tasted! This was super-moist.

I loved this recipe. I doubled the recipe and added about 3 times the amount of nuts and a few extra bananas. One of the other reviews suggested a topping of crushed nuts, nutmeg, sugar and cinnamon. I suggest going for it... Although I used half brown sugar and light on the nutmeg. Super good, super moist! I gifted most of the bread but I used a large cast iron skillet to make some for myself. My dad was visiting and ate almost half the pan. it was so yummy!!!

Excellent, moist, very good.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  Cooked for 10 minutes less then directed.  Also, if you have a bit more than 1 cup banana's, that's ok - just adds to the taste.

I agree... this is the best ever..It must have something to do with cooking at a lower temp and for a little longer..The only change I made was cutting the sugar down to 3/4 cup and adding 1 cup chopped pecans instead of 1/2 cup.  This recipe is a keeper.. :0)

Hubby and I made this last night together as part of our Christmas baking.  It was a lot of fun (first Christmas with empty nest)doing it together.  Followed recipe closely accept I had no butter milk so used 2% and we doubled the recipe thank the Lord and added nutmeg and cinnamon.   Delicious can't wait to try again with the buttermilk.

I only give this recipe a three because if you follow the directions without the other reviewers suggestions (which I accidentally did, meant to add the rum or vanilla) - It's rather flavorless.  the texture and moisture is excellenet, just needed a pop (nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla or rum!)  I'll do this recipe again with the edits :)  Oh, and I doubled the recipe, did two loafs and they were ready at 1:10.

Yes. This IS the best ever banana bread.  Wonderfully moist, flavorful, especially with really overripe bananas.
Thank you.  My family and friends love this delicious bread.

This is by far the most delicious banana bread I've ever had.  I've made this recipe twice in the past week.  The first time I included the pecans and the second time I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts.  Both loaves came out very well.  I've recieved rave reviews from everyone in my office about this bread.  The only suggestion I have is to watch the cooking time.  I had to bake my loaves an extra 20 minutes.  As always, the toothpick test is the best way to check if your bread is ready.

Wonderful base recipe that you can modify to your tastes.  I added raisins, cinnamon, and all spice and it came out wonderful.  I also used 1% milk and lime juice in lieu of buttermilk.  Only suggestion would be to reduce the sugar a bit.

Wow! I thought I didn't like banana bread, until I tried this recipe. I used apple sauce instead of vegetable oil as others suggested (healthier, but great tasting). Didn't have pecans, so used walnuts instead.

This is a very, very good recipe.  I did use some other reviewers suggestions of using 1/2 cup brown sugar, with 1 cup white sugar.  And I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and cinnamon.  It's a bit cakey, which I'm not used to.  I grew up on very organic, super healthy banana bread, however, this bread is still very delicious.  I would highly recommend trying this bread.

After reading reviews, I made several changes to "healthy up" the recipe.  My rating is for the healthy version.  That being said, with how tasty mine turned out, I am SURE the full-fat, higher sugar version would be AWESOME :D  I changed the following: used 1/3 cup light vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil, used almost 2 cups of bananas, only 1/2 cup of sugar (brown sugar that is- the bananas have enough sugar), and added 1/4 cup extra flour since the extra banana makes it stickier.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  The end result had a delicious spicy banana flavor, but the spongier texture you would expect from a bread with no oil.  I did a ballpark calorie count and each slice (12 slices/loaf) ended up having about 170 calories- not bad for banana bread.  I shared it with some friends and they claimed they couldn't tell it was healthy.  I would highly recommend these alterations if you are looking to cut fat and calories!  I'd make this again for sure!

Splendid flavor and texture.  I did add a tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Per another reviewer's suggestion I put in 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white.  I used two bananas.  Took about 1 hr. 40 min. in the oven.

This truly is the BEST EVER Banana Bread.  I have made many different recipes over the years and this one takes the cake.  I substituted Brown Sugar for the white sugar and used sour cream instead of buttermilk.  This is will be the ONLY banana bread recipe I use from now on.

I don't like bananas so I'm rating this Banana Bread for my husband.  He said this is one of the best that he has tasted.  He said it was moist and has a great taste.  I will be making this recipe again and again.  (Should be 5 stars instead of 4, didn't know how to change it).

Yummmmmmm!!!! This was an AWSOME recipe.  I followed the directions and it turned out just great.  Sweet, and a nice balance of the banana flavor.  I made it into 4 mini loaves, and cut the cooking time by about twenty minutes.  They turned out great.  Probably the BEST banana bread I have ever had.

"Best Banana CAKE Ever" -- it's wonderful, but as written: it's flat-out cake.  Cut the sugar a tad (and use at least some brown sugar, no matter what), increase the bananas, substitute half the oil with applesace and about 1/3 of the flour with wheat flour, and you'll have a delightful, moist banana bread.  That's how I usually make this, but I was out of applesauce and forgot to cut back on the sugar until it was too late.  Even with more bananas and the wheat flour, it still tastes like something Little Debbie would make.  Which means it tastes FABULOUS, but I'm only giving it 4 stars, because I don't think the title of the recipe accurately reflects the finished product.

This tasted like "moms". I used 3 large banana's ( slighty more that what it called for) and it was very good. This recipe is a keeper and will be made again.

I have tried many banana bread recipes and I have to say that this is the best banana bread recipe that I have tried.  Moist and delicious!  I toasted the pecans a little before adding them to the batter.  I've already made this banana bread 3 times this week.  I loved that it didn't call for more than a half cup of vegetable oil as other recipes.  I know that I could have used applesauce, but I think that it tasted just right as the recipe was written.

This is an excellent recipe. I think it's very forgiving; for example, I added a tbl of sour cream, 2 1/2 tbl applesause, and approx. 1/3c of canned pumpkin and a whopping 3 near-ripe bananas-- it was absolutely wonderful. I reduced the sugar to 1c and used 1c unbleached flr and 3/4c of wheat flour. I baked muffins instead (350 deg. for 40 min.). I'll be making these again- thanks for sharing and the reviewers by others was very helpful.

Good but not the "best."  It was just a tad too oily for me. I added chocolate chips and they pretty much sunk to the bottom and ended up on the bottom of the pan when the bread was removed.

I may use less oil next time, and like one reviewer said, sprinkle the chocolate chips on the top.

DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWERS AND CHANGE THE RECIPE, THIS IS THE BEST BANANA BREAD RECIPE, AT LEAST TRY IT FIRST BEFORE CHANGING IT BECAUSE YOU WON'T MAKE ANY CHANGES TO IT IF YOU TRY IT FIRST, IT AGGRAVATES ME THAT PEOPLE CHANGE IT ALL AND THEN REVIEW IT, PUT YOUR OWN RECIPES ON HERE THEN IF YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE SOMEONE ELSE'SBEFORE EVEN TRYING IT FIRST, GRANTED THERE HAVE BEEN SOME THAT I WOULD CHANGE BUT I TRY THEM FIRST AS WRITTEN. IN SAYING THAT, THE ONLY THING WITH THIS RECIPE IS IF YOU DON'T HAVE BUTTERMILK THEN MAKE YOUR OWN, PUT 1 TBSP LEMON JUICE INTO A MEASURING CUP AND FILL UP WITH MILK TO MEASURE 1 CUP AND LET STAND FOR 5 MINUTES, IN FACT I DON'T BUY BUTTERMILK I USE THIS EVERY TIME BECAUSE I NEVER HAVE IT ON HAND. ONE MORE THING IS THAT I PUT A SUGAR TOPPING ON TOP THAT ANOTHER REVIEWER SUGGESTED AND IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH BETTER IT IS 2 TBSP CHOPPED PECANS 2 TBSP SUGAR AND 1/2 TSP CINNAMON AND A DASH OF NUTMEG, COMBINE AND PRESS ONTOP OF UNCOOKEDE LOAF THEN BAKE AS RECIPE STATES. I MAKE 4 LOAVES AT A TIME THAT DON'T LAST LONG AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BANANA BREAD EVER!!!

I used vanilla soy milk in place of buttermilk, applesauce instead of oil (most of it) and used 3 ripe bananas.  Turned out VERY soft, moist and delicious.  My husband was eating the batter. Everyone asked for the recipe.

This really is the "Best Ever Banana Bread". I made 2 batches last night. First I followed the recipe exactly. On the 2nd batch I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon & 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I omitted the nuts & sprinkled brown sugar in the bottom of the pan.  Both batches are wonderfully moist & delicious.

This is the second banana bread recipe I have tried from this site.  This recipe is definitely the best ever.  It's moist, not overly sweet, and soooo easy to make.  Just a suggestion - make certain you buy very ripe bananas (this will make a difference in the flavor). I sprinkled just a little bit of ground cinnamon on the bottom of the pan for a nice smelling aroma.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Ridiculously delicious!! I modified this but it came out spectacular so i had to share.  I did not have buttermilk so i used 1/3 c. of sour cream, substituted 1/2 c. of applesauce instead of the veg oil, used three bananas (they were brown and needed a plan fast!!), I used 1 c. of brown sugar instead of 1.5 c. of white, and whole wheat flour instead of white flour (and i did use the pecans).  I greased my pan and sprinkled it w/ brown sugar then poured in the mix and sprinkled the top with a blend of brown sugar, the rest of the chopped pecans and a bit of cinammon. So moist! I even noticed a couple of pieces disappeared in the middle of the night...someone couldnt get enough! Yum Yum!

Excellent! Very moist. I did add 3 bananas as that is what I had on hand which gave it an excellent banana taste. It did stick a bit to the bottom of the pan so I would suggest parchment paper on the bottom.

Best Banana Bread I've ever made. Very moist and rich. Here's few tips . I used 2 frozen banana's ( make sure to thaw and add all the juices too) and 1 very ripe banana.
Instead of oil try use unsweetened applesauce for a healthy version. I also did not have buttermilk so i used another user's suggestion to add lemon juice to the milk.3/4 cup milk 2 tbs of lemon juice and let it sit for 15min.   I also added  1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe 
Delicious !!!I pretty much ate 1 whole loaf to myself!

Good but not the best, maybe 4 1/2 stars. I prefer Banana Banana Bread from this site. I chose this recipe to use up some buttermilk and it doesn't require as many bananas as the other recipe. I added vanilla and omitted the pecans. I will make again.

I've tried many banana bread recipes over the years (all great) but this by far IS THE BEST ever!  All my colleagues were begging for the recipe.  I did not have pecans and substituted walnuts instead and used half brown sugar and half white sugar as suggested in a previous review. I also used the crumbed topping with vanilla sugar and nutmeal (2 tablespoons each) with cinnamon (1 teaspoon) and a sprinkle of nutmeg.

This recipe is certainly terrific.  Like others, I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and freshly-grated nutmeg, and that gave it just the right hint of spice.  The bread was easy to make, but the best part is that it's moist and delicious.

Outstanding! I have never really raved about banana bread but this is delicious.  I made a few minor changes:  I didn't have buttermilk so I did the vinegar in milk substitution.  I also used light brown sugar for half of the sugar requirement and added a dash of cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again. Yum!

The recipe is amazing.  I used low fat buttermilk.  The flavor and texture is tasty.  I also sprinkled the bread pan with sugar for a crunchy shell.  Next time I plan to add chocolate chips.   It took 1 hour and 10 minites to bake in my oven.  
The buttermilk is a nice touch.   You will not go wrong taking the time out to make this recipe!

This turned out excellent.  However, I had no buttermilk, nor any milk to make soured milk, but I did have some plain yogurt so I used one small cup of that instead.  I added a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, and I also roasted some walnuts, finely chopped them and put them on top as the finishing layer before putting it into the oven.  I didn't eat it until the next day, but it was so moist and flavorful, and had others asking for the recipe.  I will make this again soon!  Thanks!

I NEVER cook. I'm new to allrecipes.com and  this is the second recipe I tried. I made it for my friends at work and shared some with my family. I'll use their words to describe it, "MMMM........so moist,this is like my mom's!", and  "I had two and I never go back for seconds". Yeah, so for someone who never cooks (me)this recipe was manageable and everyone loved it. I highly recommend it. It was delicious and it's the perfect thing to give to friends randomly to perk up their day. :)

Magnificent! Extremely moist, and the texture was perfect. I added dried blueberries and chopped walnuts for an additional crunch, and following another reviewer's suggestion, I dusted the sides of the pan with sugar after I'd greased them, and this gave me an excellent, firm crust.

This is pretty darn good! I was needing a recipe to use up some buttermilk, and this one didn't disappoint! I didn't have quite a cup worth of banana's, but it didn't make much of a difference. The bread came out super moist, and tasty anyway. I did add about a teaspoon of vanilla just for some extra flavor. This recipe is defenitly a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

This is the first banana read recipe that "turned out" for me! Yea! I think the only thing I would change next time would be to decrease the sugar a little. Other than that, this is a super recipe!

Great recipe - one for keeps! I didn't change much; as suggested by other reviewers I used only 2/3 of the sugar and added a bit more flour to compensate.  Instead of just nuts I used about 70 - 80g of a mix of different chopped nuts, sultanas, raisins and cranberries - delicious!!

Very moist bread! Next time I will add some cinnamon to the batter and sprinkle brown & white sugar with cinnamon on top for a little extra pizazz.

As another reviewer put it, this banana bread was "rediculously sweet."  It was so sugary I couldn't eat it.  I wish I had followed other reviewers' advice to cut back on the sugar.  I'll stick with Banana Bread V.  It is the best out there.

Very good if you love really sweet banana bread. It was very moist but next time I'll use VERY ripe bananas and cut down on the sugar. Talk about a sugar rush!!

This bread was outstanding.  It was incredibly moist and delicious.  I added about 1/2 cup of Hershey's cinnamon chips (which are about the size of mini choc. chips) and mixed them in with the flour so they wouldn't fall to the bottom.  The end result was fabulous!

What a delicious banana bread! I added about 1/2 cup extra banana to a double recipe. (because I had that much left, and it was over-ripe)I questioned the qty of sugar...looked like too much. Turned out delicious!!! The extra banana made it a bit flatter than normal, but it wsa worth it. The bread came out sweet and so moist. The sugar helped to make the crust sweet and just the tiniest bit chewy-crisp, which I love. I can't vouch for how well it freezes, because my family annihilated two loaves in a day. Can't wait to make it again!

This is, by far, the best banana bread and I have tried sooo many.  I used four black as night bananas and that always makes a great difference....love it, love it.  Rich, moist sweet and delicious.  My 2 year old loved it!

Huge hit with my family.  I reduced sugar to 1 cup, replaced 1/2 c of the flour w/ whole wheat flour, and 1/2 of the oil with apple sauce, and added some cinnamon (maybe 1/2 tsp, maybe 1, i love cinnamon).  Also cooked in 1 hours, i think.

This really is the best banana bread ever. I stuck 100% to the recipe (minus the optional nuts) and it was wonderful. My loaf tin was a little bigger than the one specified, but it was a good job it was as it was the perfect size. Thank you, I'll definitely be making this again!

The bread was definitely moist, but it tasted a little bland. I think this is a good starter recipe, next time I will probably add some spices.

Truly the best banana bread ever.  This bread is moist and flavorful.  I substitute applesauce for half of the oil for added moisture and less fat. This recipe also holds up well using whole wheat flour and sugar substitutes.  I usually only substitute half the flour or sugar, though.  Once you try this recipe you'll never use another banana bread recipe again!

This recipe was good. I found that the outside cooked way faster than the inside and it was a little too brown on top. I had to cook it longer cause the inside was still mushy at the suggested cooking time. Overall, I loved it when it was done!!

I am now buying one bunch of bananas for my family to eat and one to ripen so that I can make this bread!  My family and friends fight over who gets part of this loaf (I had a friend bring me ripened bananas so that I would make her some!) As someone else suggested, I coat my loaf pan with a dusting of white sugar after I grease it.  GREAT RECIPE!!

This is terrific. I use any bananas left over at the end of the week.  Sometimes I throw in a handful of chocolate chips.  It keeps very well when you mail it. My son's at college and eagerly looks forward to it. How long does it keep at home?  Who knows; it's never around long enough to find out! Simply terrific!

Nice and moist banana bread. Be sure to use ripe bananas in any banana bread recipe because the flavor is much better that way. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon in the batter to make it even more flavorful.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used walnuts instead of pecans and added closer to 1 cup.  I thought an hour and 20 minutes might be too long, but it turned out to be just right.  My whole family loves this bread - we can't stop eating it!!  I made a double batch and our first loaf was gone the same day.  We're already working on loaf #2.

Thanks for a delicious recipe.

It was a very good banana bread. Not too sweet and the banana taste was great. If I had something bad to say, I was say it was a TAD bit heavy and dense. I would have liked it to be slightly more fluffy. I might try to use a little less flour, make sure I don't over mix next time. 
EDIT: I have made this bread again, same amount of flour (I forgot to use less) and made sure I didn't overmix and it was excellent. I put a butter/sugar/oats crumble on top and it was just delicious!

The flavor on this bread was good. I do think the texture was a little rubbery, and it got very dark.  I made 3 loaves and all came out the same.

This is by far the best banana bread we have EVER had!  I have tried many different recipes using sour cream, cream cheese, etc. but the buttermilk makes this bread so moist but not "wet".  It is perfect.  It also works excellent using strawberries instead of bananas.  My family loves this bread!

Used whole wheat flour and unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and it turned out great. The original recipe is probably even better, but at least this is a little healthier version.

Really tasty - great banana flavor.  I was looking for something on the lighter side, but even without the nuts, this was heartier than I'd hoped.  It came out denser, a little rubberier (especially around the edges), and much darker in color than the photo.  My first time making this, I didn't change the recipe at all.  Am wondering if my bananas could have been TOO ripe, maybe causing some unwanted caramelization.  Still, I will keep the recipe for next time I want a heavier loaf.

Yum!  Changes to try:  apple sauce substitution for part of oil; whole wheat flour; sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on pan coating (go very easy on nutmeg); don't sift flour etc;  bake for only 1 hour or so (1 hour 20 overbaked for me!); but after freezing then defrosting in the fridge for a day, they were PERFECT and very moist.

This great recipe has become my 3-year-old's favorite "banana cake" and is making me a frequent buttermilk buyer.  And I only made the recipe to begin with because I HAPPENED to have buttermilk in the frig (used it for some other recipe at the time)!  I will say that the sugar can certainly be reduced to 1 cup (I'd like to try 1/2 brown sugar, as another reviewer suggested) and it is still plenty sweet.  And next time, I'm going to try substituting 1/2 of the oil with applesauce.  I'm trying a substitution using 1/2 nonfat yogurt right now, but it is currently in the oven and I'm not real sure how that will turn out...

This was amazing!  The buttermilk definitely keeps it moist and my family loves it.  It didn't quite look like the picture, but that could be because I used a cheap foil loaf pan.  But so worth making again and again.

I tried this recipe because I had both buttermilk and bananas that I needed to use up.  I substituted applesauce for the oil, but otherwise I didn't make any changes - and WOW.  This recipe will replacing the one I've been making since I was ten years old.

The quintessential banana bread.
I used three full sized bananas which is probably more than the recipe calls for and it came out perfectly, with a little more time in the oven.

This really is the best banana bread!!! I was thrilled. Doubled the recipe and used 1.5 cups sugar total. I added vanilla extract and made several variations  with cranberries and nuts.  I will make this again and again  simple, delicious and moist!

Excellent, even with substitutions, i.e. butter instead of oil, and using soy milk with 1 t vinegar instead of buttermilk.  Will make again.

This bread is better the next day.  I found it a bit sweet and a little oily but my partner LOVED it the way it was. Next time I will reduce the sugar slightly and add more buttermilk and less oil. VERY GOOD ANYWAY.

This is really a 4.5 but I made this three times in one day, all a little different. In the best batch I used half splenda and half sugar. I used egg beaters instead of eggs, and smuckers oil substitute intead of vegetable oil. I used 1 tablespoon of sour cream, 3 tablespoons of evaporated milk instead of buttermilk (it's all I had on hand I used all the yogurt I had on the first two batches). I added 1 teaspoon of banana extract/flavor and 1/2 a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract with a light dash of cinnamon. I sugared the bottom as someone else suggested and sprinkled nuts and sugar on top of batter. I took the recommendation from previous reviews to bake 45 min then cover lightly for the next 15.  Mine were all done at 1 hour. They were GREAT!

I can NOT stop baking this - dessert.  It is so delicious I serve it as a dessert plain, or drizzled with caramel over the top.  People's eys light up everytime I watch someone try it for the first time.

Oh my... this bread was so good.  SO GOOD!  I greased the pan with butter then sprinkled cinnimon and sugar to give the outside a nice sweet crisp (but not to crispy..)  Very good and will for sure make again.

I made again and doubled the recipe for 2 loaves, was not as good as just the one for some reason.

This is the best banana bread ever, seriously!  I've tried a few others from this site and this one is better by far.  I think I won't bother trying another banana bread recipe again, this is it!  I did not add the nuts because my picky husband won't eat nuts, and for the bananas I added 4 regular sized ones.  Yummy yummy!  Thanks for this recipe!

The name "Best Ever" describes this banana bread perfectly.  The only changes I made were to the recipe were 1 tps. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of Tupperware's Cinnamin-Vanilla spice, and added then the topping as suggested in another review.  Even my three-year old loved it!

This banana bread is wonderful. I bake it often. It keeps well but usually doesn't hang around long. A favorite at work and at home. I divide it into two smaller pans for shorter baking time. I have used both real buttermilk and the buttermilk powder you mix with water. Both turned out wonderful.

I loved this recipe as is. I used pecans and made several small loaves. Absolutely delicious! I made buttermilk with milk and white vinegar as I did not have buttermilk in my kitchen.

I followed the recipe complete. Didn't add a thing, but used a 4 mini loaf set-up (5"x 2.5") turned out perfectly done at 50 minutes!
This will be used over and over again with no changes!

Only change I made was adding 1 tsp vanilla.  I used 3 very ripe bananas, cooked in 3 mini loaf pans at a reduced time. This is the most moist, delicious banana bread I've made in my 80 years. Using buttermilk always makes baked goods better.

Best Banana bread I have ever had. Delicious and so moist. I am partial to walnuts so I substituted them for the pecans and I could eat this all day.

One addition; I took the advice from one of the ratings and sprinkled the top before baking with sugar/cinnamon/chopped nuts.

I use this to get perfection every time and I make banana bread almost weekly. The most common substitution I make is whole, unflavored yogurt for the buttermilk. Just way more convenient and gets the same result. It's great with less sugar too.

I made this for my toddlers because they like bananas and I wanted for their breakfast. I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 and thought it was perfect. I gave the recipe 4 stars because I think it would’ve been too sweet as written.

I always get so many compliments when I make this. I’ll normally add chunks of ginger or a cup of chocolate chips but either way the bread isn’t moist and delicious!

I made it and got RAVE reviews!  I left out pecans because I personally don't care for nuts in my bread, and used three (very ripe) bananas.

With the addition of 1 tsp. vanilla this is exactly my mom's "secret?" recipe. :) Funny she had us fooled all those years! 
Her notes were, "bake @325 until top is golden and splits slightly about 1 1/2 hrs but check at 1 hr and watch, do not over cook."
We love that it's a dense bread, not fluffy cake-like. 
So many people ask me to make it! If you like, it's also good later, toasted lightly with a little cream cheese.

I just made this on Sunday and love it!  It is very moist and tasty.  The only difference is that I added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I may cut back on the sugar just a little, as it is a bit too sweet for my taste, but everyone else loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you!

This is great -- but in reading the comments, I added the following: 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Really good, moist, more-ish. All that a banana bread should be.

This is hands down the best banana bread I've ever made. Since I never use up buttermilk before it goes bad, I substitute with sour cream in the same amount as the buttermilk it calls for. I've added chocolate chips in the past, which is really delicious.

Yes lots of reviewers have made changes, but that is the beauty of this recipe; it is perfect for adaptations! I’ve made it as listed, I’ve replaced the oil with applesauce, used less sugar and replace with brown sugar. It all turned out fabulous!

This is a great basic banana bread recipe. I experimented a tiny bit.  My eggs on hand were small, so I used 3. I used 3 tbsp buttermilk powder instead of liquid. I used 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder. I used 1 c sugar and substituted 1/2 c honey, to total 1.5 c sweetness. 3 small very ripe bananas = 1.25 cups mashed banana. Also added 1 tsp vanilla. I added 3 tbsp chia seeds, hydrated in 1/2 c water for 2 minutes. (Just trying to add some goodness!) Result was fantastic! Oh, and I used my silicone baking pans for the very 1st time. I did not add nuts, but the chia seeds gave it a slight nutty consistency. Baking time was 45 min for 2 small loaves. YUMMY!

This wasn't my personal favorite, but my dad thought it was great. I like my banana bread a little more moist; almost like a dense pound cake... If you're really going for a bread consistency (fair enough, I can see why you would want that in banana BREAD) this is a great recipe. I gave some to my dad and he said he enjoyed spreading butter on it and warming to have with his coffee in the morning. 

I did add some cinnamon (1/2 a tsp I think) because I add cinnamon to everything.

Extremely moist inside with a crunchy top!!! I didn't need to bake it for 1 hour 20 minutes. I baked mine in an oven w/ "Turbo" heat fans ( not sure if this sped up the bake time). After 50 min at 150 degrees celcius it was done!!!

Truly up there as the 'Best' banana bread. I will be making this again for sure. I used half  brown sugar and half white sugar and substituted melted butter for the vegetable oil as I out of it. It did require more bake time.

I made this with exactly the ingredients listed and now my husband wants me to throw out my old recipe. The house we are staying in for vacation does not have a loaf pan, so used 8” x 8” pan and cooked for one hour. Thanks for this amazing recipe to warm up the rainy day.

This was really good! The only thing I did different was instead of butter milk I used milk and vinegar. Mine did stick a bit when coming out of the pan and it split in half, but other than that this is a good recipe!

Everything a banana bread should be.  The only changes I made were to use 1 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also used 3 bananas which might have been more than 1 cup.  I baked several small loaves instead of 1 large one.    Thumbs up from my whole family.

I didn't have pecans, so substituted with cashew nut and pumpkin seeds.
I felt the sugar was too much. Used  about 100g of jaggery. The results was awesome. This goes into my permanent recipe collection.

The bread turned out great but using 325 for 1 hr. 20 minutes it started to get too dark on edges so I covered with foil for the last 15 minutes of baking. Metal heats up quicker than glass but glass continues to cook and cooks slower than metal.
Which to use for best bread? Thanks for great recipe Rose!

How did we attain the Best Ever title? Whom was the judge? Did they taste every other Banana Bread?

What were the parameters used to make such a judgement.

These grandeous titles makes me want to move to the next recipie.

Cooking time is wonky. My bread is way over cooked and I followed the recipe exactly. The sides are like a thick, weird, crispy crust from all the sugar/over cooking. It tastes like if banana bread and caramel had a baby but not in a good way.

Just now reviewing but I have been making this for years. Now everyone in the family freezes their bananas. When I say I am making this recipe everyone brings those frozen bananas over with smiles on their faces.  I will never make any other banana bread recipe. I quadruple the recipe and its always perfect. I have had it in freezer for 3 months and taste like I just made it.

This was very good!  I made it according to the recipe, but only put 1 cup of sugar in because my bananas were very ripe.  I sprinkled the top lightly with sugar and chopped walnuts (didn't have pecans), and the topping turned out great.  I couldn't wait for it to cool when removing from oven, so cut a couple pieces and they stayed intact, despite being hot.  Very yummy and I will make it again!

I made it as directed but doubled for 2 loaves. Cooking time was right on in my standard electric oven in a metal pan. Overall it was a good banana bread but not outstanding. We don’t normally keep buttermilk in the house so I probably won’t make this version again.

This is the BEST EVER Banana Bread and I changed the Entire recipe-hahahaha!  ( just being funny being that one All Recipes member stated "stop writing reviews of the 'best ever' when you change the entire recipe!!!!!)


I actually made this and followed the recipe. The only thing I did change out was the oil for the applesauce as someone suggested. The bread baked very nicely and all the way through. The taste was not as moist and kind of rubbery.  My wife loved it and that's a plus!  I would definitely make this again but use the oil next time.  I can also definitely say it was super easy to make and you cannot mess up the recipe.

With all that said, I made the recipe exactly as it was written, using walnuts instead of pecans because pecans are just nasty. The bread came out amazing. Bake temp and time were spot on. The bread raised up perfectly, despite someone else saying it was flat. Mine was fine. It was very moist and had amazing flavor. Again, I made this exactly as it was written, with the exception of the nuts. Great recipe. Thank you for sharing it!

I have been making this recipe for 6 years and EVERY SINGLE person who eats this asks for the recipe! Any time I take it to an event I come home with an empty pan.  I double the recipe and make  a 9x13  cake pan and 1 regular loaf pan. It is the moistest banana bread you will ever taste! Not healthy at all.......but worth the calories!

This used to be my go to banana bread recipe and i’ve made several times before and it was alway a success! Last 3 times i’ve made it i had issues with the bake time, where it would be nice and dark brown around the edges and raw in the middle, i have not changed my oven and all other cakes work out just fine. I tried waiting till the center was cooked all the way, but by then the edges and the bottom were burnt! I think i will try baking at 350 degrees next time and see how it turned out, if it doesn’t work i’ll find another recipe!

Like many of us who love to bake, I'm always on the look out for a bread that is more perfect than the previous one we've deemed a "10"!! 
This bread, by far, is THE best recipe i've ever made..and this coming from someone who is well known to make a mean banana bread! Love the recipe, thank you, Rose!
As for changes, i used half coconut oil and half applesauce and used an equal mix of brown and granulated sugar called for. I also added a tsp of vanilla because i love vanilla in breads. 
Added a topping at the request of my daughter, but this  bread is def stand alone terrific.  
Crumble topping-
1/2 C brown and 1/2 granulated sugar
1/2 flour
1/2 cup finely chopped nuts
1 tsp cinnamon
5 T butter

We love this recipe.  My one son doesn't like nuts, so I only put them in half the loaf, after I have poured the batter into the pan.  It has a wonderful texture.

I just wanted to write that 63 minutes, 325 degrees convection in a glass 4.5x8.5 inch glass pyrex is perfect!

also add 1 tsp ground cinnamon
substitute 1/2 cup oil to 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup applesauce
any type of milk works!

I was looking for a recipe close to the one I made with my mother all the time and this was the one most like it and everyone I gave it too at Christmas just loved it and they have recently requested for me to make it again so I am at 3am in the morning I work third shift so I'm up during the overnight hours when most people are sleeping.

Scrumptious! Like almost everyone else, I couldn't leave the recipe as is. I shaved off a little of the sugar and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon. I set the timer for 70 minutes and it was done. I took the advice from one of the reviews and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the bottom of the pan as well as the top of the batter. I also divided the oil in half and replaced with melted butter. I believe the recipe would be fantastic as is. I just have to tweak; it's in my nature. Saving this to my recipe box and looking no further for banana bread recipes.

This banana bread is the best I had 3 medium bananas so I just used all of them instead of measuring and because I never have buttermilk on hand I made some with milk and vinegar but other than that I stayed with the original recipe it’s really moist and thick throughout defiantly worth 5stars

The flavor and texture were wonderful.  However, As  soon as I took it out of  the oven I ran a knife around the sides and then flipped it upside down.  To my dismay the bottom third of the bread remained in the pan. BUMMER!  It tasted great but did not look great.  What did I do wrong?  I had sprayed the pan with PAM before putting the batter in the pan.  Would love to know what I did wrong so I can make it again.

I made this as is in the recipe except I mixed pecans and black walnuts as I did not have a half cup of either. Made muffins for better portion control as I am diabetic. Great muffins

I made this bread EXACTLY as stated and really liked it. I was worried I burned it when the outside was a very dark when I pulled it out of the oven but it was actually perfectly baked. I guess I'm not used to seeing/eating much banana bread to realize that it was no cause for alarm. The inside is moist and the outside (mostly the top) has a very light crispiness making the overall texture and flavors of this bread quite delightful. Adding this to my favs!

In the process of baking it now. We see when it comes out of the oven. I doubled the recipe and added a touch of baking powder just cause. I also april kled in some chocolate chips semi sweet of course and a few raisens for shits n giggles. We poured some into muffin tins to make muffins so we see how it all works out. I might change my review to 5 stars after and include some pics.

This really IS the best ever banana bread I’ve had! I made it two ways. Exactly as the recipe instructed and I also made it adding blue berries and cranberries. DELICIOUS either way!!  This will be my recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing.

Very delicious and moist. since I put in four large bananas I had to bake it for longer (1hr10mins). You really need to use sweet, ripe bananas. I didn't taste my bananas ahead of time and assumed they were sweet enough because they were browning but that wasn't the case. Next time I will use sweeter bananas for a stronger banana taste.

The best banana nut bread ever! The only change I made was to use Walnuts instead of Pecans because that's what I had on hand. The buttermilk makes it so moist and tasty. I took it to a bring a dish lunch and everyone wanted the recipe; like banana nut bread was new!

Moist muffins, but too sweet. With the natural sweetness of ripened bananas, the sugar could probably be cut in half.

Made as written.Did sprinkle sugar over loaf before baking.Very moist and good banana taste.  Loaf raised to a nice crown. to others who had the problem of the loaf being flat; blend wet and dry ingredients just to the point were you can still see steaks of flour and then just fold in the pecans. 
  When I make again will add cinnamon.

Chewy! Not "the best banana bread ever" Sorry op, but we do not care for this recipe and we did not over mix, not sure where the chew comes from but it is not good! Don't fall for the hype, use another banana bread recipe, there are many out there!

This was really easy! I read some reviews first and saw that there were issues with it rising nicely. I just used a heaping teaspoon(or approx 1.5) for the baking soda and it rose perfectly! Also I had pretty fresh bananas and I was afraid that there wouldn’t be much flavor from them so I added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla extract. Also since there were comments about it being too sweet I just cut the sugar in half to 3/4 of a cup and it was plenty sweet. I also didn’t have buttermilk and so I substituted vanilla yogurt whey for as much as was sitting in the yogurt pot and then added the actual yogurt to make it the right amount up to 1/3 cup.

I loved it! It was moist on the inside and crispy on the top. I used evaporated milk instead of buttermilk and it tasted great! For a beginner it was extremely easy.

Truly the most moist and delicious banana bread recipe I have found! This is my go-to banana bread recipe and every time I make it, it is requested at the next function! Can also make into cupcakes/muffins just as easily. I make it vegan, replacing the milk with nut or soy milk and replacing the eggs with ground flax seeds and water - so easy! If you like a little less sweet so more natural banana flavor shines, you can cut sugar down to just 1/2 cup and it still tastes awesome! Enjoy! :)

This is a wonderful recipe.  I used regular sized muffin cups and baked at 325 for 20 minutes.   I didn't have enough white sugar so substituted brown sugar at approximately half/half ratio.  

I am thinking of trying 1C pumpkin next time for a variety.  Has anyone tried this.

I always incorporate something new replacing the pecans. I have  added chocolates chips, chocolate sprinkles and cinnamon.

I used all the suggestions - line with foil, vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk and 1/3 brown sugar instead of white. Also walnuts instead of pecans. Came out great! Brown sugar gave crust a brownie-like texture and yogurt added a creamy vanilla flavor. (Btw oil is left out of the instructions).

I made a vegan version.  Used flax eggs instead of eggs, ACV and soy milk for the buttermilk and avocado oil instead of vegetable oil (just bc that's all I had).  Baked for exactly the time stated and it turned out perfectly.  Will keep this as my "Banana bread' recipe and throw the other recipes away :)

Best Ever Banana bread doesn't even begin to describe it.  Amazing warm or cold, with or with out butter.  I always triple this recipe and it never lasts more than a few days before the boys have eaten it all.

I have been making this Banana Bread recipe for at least 10 yrs, probably more.  Only change I ever make is the amt of ripened bananas, 3-4 of them. Depends on what is on hand. Oh, also never put nuts in it, as my family  doesn't care for it.  Other wise it IS THE BEST out there!!

I doubled this recipe and decided to do something different with 1/2 the batter. I placed wax paper on a sheet roll baking pan, greased it & dusted flour on the paper. It was done within 30 min while my loaf was still baking. I pulled it off of pan, placed a towel on top and rolled it while it was still hot. I let cool for 30 min. I slowly unrolled it, let it breathe then spread a cream cheese caramel topping on it leaving 1 in on sides. Rolled it up easily, dusted it with powered sugar & drizzled caramel topping on top. Easy, fun & turned out great.

Excellent banana bread which I drizzled a lemon glaze on for some zest.  Considerably less sugar and oil than most recipes.  I baked it for slightly less time to avoid dryness as it continues to bake for a short time after it's been removed from the oven.  Delicious!!

Moist, delicious banana bread with a deep dark color.  Takes longer to bake than some other banana bread recipes, but it's really good!  I'll probably add more nuts next time, since I like my banana bread nutty.  The only alteration I made was that I doubled the recipe and used 5 large over-ripe bananas- probably a little more than the recipe called for- but it turned out great.

Delicious!  Made it exact with the exception of adding 1/2 c. chopped walnuts to the batter, and sprinkling the top of the loaf with 2 tbls. chopped walnuts and about a tablespoon of white sugar  to give a nice, crunchy top crust.  Next time I think I will reduce the sugar by 1/4 - 1/2 cup and add 1/4-1/2 cup more mashed banana to increase the moistness of the bread even more without making it overly sweet.  My loaf was baked in a dark pan and was ready in 1 hour  5 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good light banana bread, more like cake. I changed it a bit to suit my tastes. Adding cinnamon and vanilla. Omitting any nuts. I also used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and exchanging 1/2 cup white sugar for brown. I cooked at 350 for an hour because that's what I usually do. It was perfect.

Great easy recipe with a few modifications. I used 3 medium bananas which I baked for about 10 min. at 300 degrees in the skins to ripen further. I also substituted a 1/2 cup I’d white sugar for light brown sugar and I added a slash of vanilla to the wet ingredients and cinnamon to the dry. Finally, I buttered the 9 x 4 loaf pan instead of using spray. It came out great!

I made a couple adjustments. I only had 3/4cup of white sugar left, so I had to substitute with brown sugar. I added chocolate chips, pecans and a dash of vanilla. Came out really moist. Will make it again for sure!

This is a great banana bread. I have made it several times, usually in three small loaf pans cooked for 40 minutes or so. It is so moist and freezes beautifully. I always add vanilla, and sometimes cinnamon,  or chocolate chips or walnuts (instead of pecans). I cut the sugar to 1/2 or 3/4 cup and it is still good, though not as sweet tasting when 1/2 cup is used. Also, spelt flour (white or whole grain) subs nicely for wheat. A family favorite!

This banana nut bread is amazing! Easily the best I've ever had. I used butter in place of vegetable oil (as I do with most baking recipes) and used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar. So delicious!

My guys love this bread. I add a few spices: Cinnamon 1 tsp, 1/ 2 tsp of allspice to dry mixture and 1 tsp of vanilla to the wet mixture. And if you like bananas always add more usually 3 bananas :)

This is seriously my go-to when I make desserts! Even my mom likes it and she’s very picky! Only thing I changed is to make sure you have pretty ripe bananas and also for the oil- I changed mine to coconut oil....when it sits it starts to solidify more & makes it wonderful!

I’ve made this recipe twice now, the first time only adding a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  It was fabulous.  The second time, I tried using some commenters suggestions of using vanilla yogurt instead of the buttermilk and applesauce instead of the oil.  I am not a fan of those substitutions at all; the result was too sticky.  I like slightly moist banana bread and the substitutions were not to my liking.  I encourage you to use the recipe as is, except if you want to add spices to enhance your bread.  Thank you for this recipe.  I will keep using it.

This was really good in many ways and I think buttermilk is really a key to its moistness and light texture.
I made it twice - once substituting gluten free flour because I was making it for my 3rd graders and I have two gluten intolerant children in the class.  The only switch besides the gluten free flour blend (by Bob's Red Mill) was to add a 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  And no nuts for that one because of the nut allergies in my classroom too.  The kids loved it and for a gluten free banana bread it was very moist and light.  But it was soooo sweet, that I decided to make another one for my husband and I.  I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat (because that's all I had) and I put half the amount of sugar recommended, plus a splash of vanilla, a tsp of cinnamon, and the oil that I used was a mild olive oil (again, that's what I had on hand).  Oh, and I added a 1/2 cup of chopped cashews.   It was plenty sweet still but best of all it was moist and light and delicious.  I've made a lot of banana bread in my life, and the buttermilk makes a huge difference!

this is the terrific recipe - i've  tried other recipes and nothing comes close! Used a bit more banana than called for and will try one of the topping suggested next time -- but otherwise this will be my go-to recipe...enjoyed by all!!!

It makes a good banana bread but if you're looking for a fluffy muffin top then this isn't the recipe you're looking for. I doubled the recipe so I could make a loaf as well as muffins but they all came out flat which was disappointing but they we're still quite good.

 I might try this again substituting butter for the oil and perhaps adding baking powder to get that fluffy top.

I have made this bread a number of times and it is my family's favorite banana bread recipe.  We love the crunchy crust. I bake it in a bundt pan for extra surface area. 

I use more pecans than called for, between 3/4 and a full cup. 

It freezes beautifully.

I'll definitely make this again. After I spray the pan, I like to dust the pan with a light amount of sugar.  It makes the crust extra special.

I did not make any changes.  I would add nuts but we have a grandchild that is allergic to nuts.  I made them into 4 mini loaves and they are perfect for taking to work for a dessert for lunch...very moist and great tasting....yes I would definitely make this recipe again...

The first time I made this I found it to be TOO sweet so I made it again but cut back the sugar to 1 1/4 cups.  Much better.  Next time I may even skim off a little more.  Other than that it was excellent.  I have small pans so was able to make 2 loaves.  They took close to an hour to bake.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I've tried a lot of different recipes to find the best one. All the others come out dry and tasteless compared to this one. I make it for special occasions but also when I have bananas that are just a little too ripe to enjoy unless they are in the bread. It's so simple yet SOOOO AMAZING!!!

The banana bread recipe is a good foundation; however I change a few things to make it the best banana bread ever! .  1.) I add more bananas as I never make one batch of this.  I usually do 3 bananas per batch, it leaves it more moist and more flavorful.  2) replace buttermilk with coconut milk - exact same measurement per batch.  3) replace vegetable oil with vanilla yogurt - again with the exact same measurement per batch.  These changes sound weird, I know; however they leave the bread amazingly moist!  I also make this bread into muffins by simply using a muffin tin.  My husband hates bananas, my best friend hates bananas...I have convinced them both to try this bread as it's so delicious and they both love it; in fact they both request it! My husband likes it to take to work for a quick breakfast, my best friend likes it over coffee or chai tea, and my kids love to bring them to school for snack.  The recipe itself is not something that came out incredibly well; however, with a few adjustments, it was incredible!

It was great!  I wanted to decrease the sugar level, so  I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and used the oil as stated.  The amount of sugar in even unsweetened applesauce is astounding.  The whole family loved it.  A keeper!

I've been using this recipe for years and it's a hit every time no matter who I make it for. It sooo moist, full of flavor, and when it's freshly baked (since it's even better when warm) it has this nice little crust on the outside and is super soft on the inside. I tweak it in the following ways: I generously add a few dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon to the dry ingredients and pure vanilla extract to the wet (1tsp). I don't measure out my bananas (the more the merrier) but I probably use roughly a little more than 2 cups. Also, the full amount of white sugar in the recipe is way too sweet so I split what's called for: half white sugar and half brown sugar and I still hold back a little of the white sugar to cut back on some of the sweetness a little more. This recipe is a keeper.

I absolutely loved the recipe! I was hesitant to  amount of sugar it called for, but  then again I dread banana bread that lacks the extra sweet flavor. I did make my own tweaks, and I must say I am impressed with the results! 

Added to the wet ingredients:
1 TSP VANILLA

Added to the dry ingredients:
1 TSP BAKING SODA
1  TSP CINNAMON

I opted for walnut pieces instead of almonds and a muffin tray instead of a loaf pan.

Instead of mixing walnuts in the batter, I just topped the muffins off before the went in the oven. 

For baking time and temperature:
Baked in oven at 425 degrees for 5 minutes,.
Then drop temperature to 350 degrees for an additional 12 minutes.

These Muffins turned out perfect and I cant wait to share them!

This was just ok. Much too sweet and the sides were almost burnt by the time the center came out clean. Not a lot of banana flavor. I'll keep looking.

I added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and it is delicious!  Using only a non-stick cooking spray didn't work though.  I should have used Baker's Joy or greased and floured.  Otherwise, my favorite banana bread so far!

Simply the best. I do not keep buttermilk around so I sub whole milk with a splash of white vinegar. Let that sit for 10 minutes and you are ready to go. Sometimes add chocolate chips and nuts when I have them.

I made a couple adjustments since I did not have a couple of the ingredients. I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder, since I  did not have baking soda. I  added wine vinegar (I did not have lemon juice or white vinegar (a more neutral choice) to the milk to sour it instead of the buttermilk  I did not have. We did not add nuts. This recipe turned out really moist and tasty. I used it to teach my granddaughter how to make Banana Bread. She enjoyed her time cooking and the bread was Yummy!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Only complaint is that even after using non-stick spray the banana bread stuck to the pan.  The crust is quite crumbly, but the inside is very moist.  Great flavor.  Will probably use shortening and flour on the pan next time to see if that reduces the sticking.

OK, it's in the oven now and will see how it turns out and come back to edit.  I did add 1 TBS spiced Rum and part  of the flour is  King Author white whole wheat and 1/2 tsp extra salt.  I have tried recipes with sour cream (used it this time)  and they turn out very tasty so can't wait to try this with Buttermilk. (Oh BTW- baked at 350 for less time. Keep an eye on it, oven temps vary).
Edit: Turned out lovely, glad i made a double batch !
Edit:   Buttermilk made this bread tasty too

Didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I substituted plain greek yogurt watered down to the consistency of buttermilk.  Made a moist on the inside slightly crispy along the outer edges loaf.  Made 2, not 1 loaf.

I keep trying new recipes because I had one years ago and lost it so I keep trying to find one similiar.  This recipe was very good and please do not hate me, I made a few changes that others recommended.  I love spices so I added one teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I used half white sugar and half brown.   The walnuts were sitting on the counter and I forgot to add them!  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

I used coconut oil as my vegetable oil and plain kefir as my buttermilk (I know, I know - I changed things!). Because I was adding chocolate chips, I dropped the sugar to one cup (3/4 c. white, 1/4 c. light brown). Even that way, it was too sweet for my taste. I used three bananas. The texture and taste are good, and I'm glad I cut the sugar. For some, it might be five stars as is, but for us, it would have been too sweet.

I've been making this for a couple of years now. Truly the best recipe for banana bread I've tried. I follow the recipe exactly as written and it turns out every time!  Since I don't use vegetable oil, I use coconut oil and raw sugar  rather than white. I also want to mention that the loaves freeze very well.

I've made this at least a dozen times and it's always a hit. Now, I use walnut oil (1/3C) instead of veg and sour cream+milk (1/4C each) instead of buttermilk, simply bc I never seem to have the latter. I also cut in some light brown sugar with the white and add a dash of bourbon vanilla. I omit the nuts as a preference, but the walnut oil gives it a nice nutty flavor.

Most banana bread is dry and bland...this is completely NOT. Very moist with a great banana flavor. It is dense without being rubbery or gummy. (don't over mix, just like other quick breads or muffins)  I added 1/2 C chocolate chips to the batter and also made an oatmeal streusel  topping for a variation and it was a WOW.  Topping was 3/4 C oats, 3 T soft butter, 1/3 C brown sugar, mix and crumble on top before baking.  ( I also added a sprinkling of sea salt to the top of the crumb before baking)  Love love love this keeper!

This was a very good recipe which I followed exactly. My only issue was that it got way to dark on top before it was completely done. (It was on center rack in center of oven) I did end up covering it with foil so it would not completely burn. I baked it in a stoneware bread pan which I greased thoroughly with shortening. (I will grease and flour next time) It still stuck to the bottom in the middle. Other than these two small issues I have to say the bread was delicious! I had many many compliments on it as well! I plan on making it into muffins next! This will be my go to banana bread recipe from now on!

Excellent recipe!I made it per the recipe which is the only way to ever rate a recipe.  I did use the non-stick spray on my loaf pan, but it still stuck a tiny bit. Next time I think I will use butter and see how that does. It could have been the brand of spray that I have.

Wow. Best banana cake I've ever made.  Only change was using half brown sugar and half white, and measured flour in grams at 125 g per cup.  Top baked up like candy : )

Loved everything about it, I did add some pumpkin spice because I love it!  I'm sick of people trying to alter the recipe, you don't like how it turned out,  then come up with your own!  People work hard to post their recipes and offer it to others!

Very tasty and easy to make. I wanted to make banana bread but my normal recipe calls for butter and sadly i was all out.  Luckily I found this recipe. I didnt have buttermilk so i used regular whole milk.  and i added a tbsp of vanilla, butter, nut flavoring. 1-4-17 I make this banana bread almost every week now. Today I doubled it, and used brown sugar in place of white sugar. I only used 2 cups not the 3 called for.

I would lessen the amount of sugar next time. Maybe it was due to using override bananas, but it sweeter than I would prefer. Other than that it was delicious .

After reading the reviews for this bread I was really expecting something amazing. It was OK- nothing wrong with it, but nothing special either. As others have said, it is VERY sweet.

I'm a pastry chef and work in a bakery. I prefer banana breads that use oil instead of butter; they're much moister. Although I sometimes add a teaspoon of cinnamon, my 5-star rating is for the recipe as written.  I used pecans because that's my nut of choice.  I double and make two loaves. Seriously, my family wipes out one loaf before I can even blink. Great recipe, thanks.

I’ve made this bread over 100 Times. The only changes I make are I use dark chocolate chips instead of nuts and I cut the sugar in half because I don’t like things very sweet. This is also excellent with milk instead of buttermilk if you don’t have one or the other. It’s a big hit with everyone!

Good basic recipe. One of the better I've had.  I made into muffins, added a few tablespoons of pb fit and used greek vanilla yogurt in place of buttermilk.

This is a great Banana Bread, however just from reading the recipe I knew the ratio of sugar to flour was too high.  The changes I made: Reduce to 1 cup of sugar (and even that is high, so will go down to 3/4 cup next time), add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and bake as 15 muffins @ 350* for 25 minutes.  They were wonderful !

I have made this a half dozen times now and love it. I did cut the sugar in half however, and substituted walnut for pecans and added a 1/2 cup candied cranberry which is very plentiful and cheap where I live.

My kids and husband loved this recipe. I like to make banana bread cupcakes instead of a loaf since it is easier to grab and go with the little ones. The cook time I used for the mini muffin pan was 20 min. and for the regular muffin pan I baked for 25 min. and they turned out great!

This recipe is delicious, easy to make and really fool proof!   If you don’t have buttermilk you can just add lemon to regular milk as a substitute.  We make this every time we have overripe bananas, which is often.  For an extra kick I add pecans, shredded coconut and chocolate chips.   Awesome!

I have made this before and it's always really good! I tripled the batch this time and threw in an extra banana at the end because it just didn't taste banana-y enough. Tastes awesome as usual! Only thing, the loaves that have nuts in them seem to rise better for me while the ones without get a little bit ugly on the tops.

Absolutely delicious! I made 12 large muffins and baked them for 30-32 minutes. I cut the sugar down to a 1/2 cup and the muffins were still very sweet. I also added a tbs of molasses to give the taste more depth. Before baking I added a dollop of banana mush on top of each muffin and at the very end set the broiler on high to lightly brown the tops. So yummy!!!!

I used heavy whipping cream (instead buttermilk ) I had left over from making ice cream last week, and sprinkled in some coconut shavings and chocolate chips instead of nuts.   I would not have put the chocolate chips in to a loaf if I had known that the chocolate that goes to the edges gets sort of burnt in an hour and twenty minutes. This was tasty, would be better if in muffin form rather than loaf. Shorter cooking time, no burnt chocolate :)

The whole family really liked the banana bread made in muffin pans. I didn't have buttermilk so I soured milk with a small splash of white vinegar. I also put a small amount of cinnamon (maybe an 1/8 tsp.) and used almonds instead of pecans.

05-14-16 ~ A nice, moist banana bread.  We love toasted banana bread and this was very good.  I knew the buttermilk would make a moist loaf.  I made a double batch using up overripe bananas.  The one change I made was to toast the pecans while the oven was preheating.  I like the flavor of toasted nuts as I think the flavor pops.  I got five (6 x 3 1/2) loaves out of a double batch.

A new family favorite.  My husband is a banana bread connoisseur (ha!) and this is by far his favorite banana bread (homemade or purchased).  It's excellent on its own, but my boys also love it sliced, lightly toasted with some butter.

This is my favorite  banana bread recipe!
I do tweak it a little. ...
Instead of butter milk , I use sour cream. 
And I always  use 5 or 6 very ripe bananas. 
It's melt in your mouth bread!

I have made this recipe so many times.  My husband  absolutely loves it.  I do cut back on the sugar as the overriped bananas are so sweet  I also subbed 1/2 cup wheat flour  but changed nothing else.  One of the best recipes!

I have gotten rave reviews for this banana bread. The buttermilk in it truly does make all the difference !!! I always add chocolate chips and walnuts to bring it all together. Delicious!

Used 3 ripe bananas, made buttermilk by adding vinegar to milk, and omitted nuts, no reason other than some don't like nuts.  This didn't last long!

I had three over-ripe bananas but was low on butter, so I looked for an alternate recipe that uses oil rather than my usual butter/sugar recipe. This is good! It looked perfect coming out of the oven and is definitely moist, as others have said. I did reduce sugar by 1/2 cup based on reviews, but next time I might just stick with it as written. It sounded like a lot of sugar at first, but then I saw that my usual recipe calls for 1 cup anyway.  I liked the idea of combining the mashed bananas with the wet ingredients rather than into the batter at the end. Since I almost never have buttermilk on hand and I always have sour cream, I used that instead.

Only made one change: used homemade kefir instead of buttermilk (should have the same effect). Final product was a wonderfully moist, flavorful, sweet banana bread that was exactly what I was looking for!

This banana bread is absolutely amazing. I personally substitute the flour for whole wheat flour and I do half brown sugar and half regular sugar which makes it absolute perfect. Don't forget to wrap it in foil until it cools down so it can soak up the moisture. * key part in making banana bread.

I doubled the batch! Omg! Everybody loved it! The only thing I did different is that I added 1 tsp of cinnamon! It was soooo good! And felt like giving it a twist I added brown sugar and butter till butter melted and chopped up some bananas then added the batter! It deserves 10 stars!

Do not change a thing  - works perfectly as it is. And by far the best texture of any of the recipes I have tried - not too heavy and nice crumb. Forgot this was the recipe I had used and accidentally used another "best" - it was NOT even close! Making the RIGHT "best ever" one again here momentarily...mmm

Not enough banana and way too much sugar. It is very sweet, but lacks banana flavor. 
It's also bland, even though i upped the salt to a teaspoonful (what I usually use in my regular banana bread recipe) and added two teaspoons of vanilla.

I made this recipe because I had some overripe bananas.  I usually don't care for banana bread; but this recipe is great.  I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and cloves to my batter and used bread flour.  I also topped the bread with foil for the last 20 minutes as the top was done, but still needed to cook. Delicious, I love this banana bread!

I used this recipe to make my first ever banana bread and it came out amazing!!! Better than any other banana bread I have tasted. I was worried about it being dry which it wasn't at all. I followed the recipe exactly the first time but at my husband's request, I added some cinnamon the next time which made it even better in my opinion, but it was still great without it!

Only thing I did differently was to add 1 tsp vanilla.  Loved the texture as well as the taste.  I set the timer for 65 minutes,  and it was on the border of being overcooked.   Very moist, and very important to wait until completely cool.  (After 4 hours, it was still a little warm/fragile when trying to slice it.)

It did make a large heavy loaf.  The next time I will use 2 smaller loaf pans.

This turned out great - very moist and flavorful!  I made a few substitutions - I was out of vegetable oil, so I used vegetable shortening instead.  Also, I didn't have buttermilk, so I used evaporated milk instead.  Based on other reviewers' comments, I also added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.

One of my favorite banana breads! I used 4 bananas instead of measuring the banana and I also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of vanilla. I also didn't have buttermilk , so I put 1 1/2 tsp of vinegar in the 1/3 C of milk. Like others say, the top is crispier and the inside is amazing!!

Such an easy & delicious recipe for banana bread! My family loves this one & I always come back to it. The Buttermilk is a great addition to this recipe & adds so much great flavor. The only thing I do differently is omit the oil & use apple sauce instead. Other then that perfect recipe

I love this recipe because it uses oil instead of butter, and it's super yummy! Where I live I can get butter but just not as easy as I can get oil, so this recipe is super convenient for us.  Thanks for a great recipe. All my coworkers and family love it. :)

Super basic, yet super delicious!  Instead of buttermilk, I used yogurt, per the suggestion of some of these reviews.  Instead of 1.75 cups of white sugar, I used ~1/2 cup of honey (I don't like it super sweet).  I didn't  measure how many cups of banana went in, I just mashed up 3 bananas and tossed em in the mix.  This only needed to bake ~30 minutes, perhaps due to my adjustments.  My only complaint is that there weren't enough nuts.  I'll put a whole cup of walnuts next time.

I made this into 4 mini loaves, and I'm glad I checked at 37 min because they were ready. The next time I'd check it sooner.  I used 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tblsp ground flax seed, and about 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. My bananas were good-sized and I used three (that equaled just over a cup for me when mashed). Before placing in the oven, I topped with cinnamon-sugar and some Ghiradelli 60% cocoa baking chips. It came out delicious! UPDATE 8/29/19: This time I added a handful of chocolate chips to half of the batter. Also using mini-loaf pans, I sprinkled a few of the chips on top of the two that had them in it.

Not my favorite banana bread.  A cup and a half of sugar in a single loaf of bread was a lot - I reduced to 1/2 cup each brown and white, and that was plenty.  While the flavor was good, the texture seemed wrong - maybe because of all the oil.  I'll look for another recipe for the next loaf - still have some bananas to use up!

I was running low on sugar, so only put in 1 cup, which turned out to be just right for my taste.
I was out of  pecans or walnuts so used slivered almonds that had been in my freezer for I don't know how long, but longer than they should have been. I did toast them to "freshen" them, and they were as good as new.
Bottom line, this is a great recipe that tastes great and is not too sweet due to using less sugar.

I made some substitutions and additions. I replaced 3/4 c flour with whole wheat flour, used 1 banana & added apple sauce to make the 1 c mashed banana. I also cut out 1/2 c sugar and  added 3 T chia seeds.
Baked at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, in 2 - 7x3" loaf pans.

I have tried a lot of recipes for banana nut bread and I finally found one that's moist and yummy! Best compliment was from a friend who said it's so moist she doesn't need to put butter on it. But why let that stop you!

I didn't change anything at all, expect the time. I baked it for 1 hour exactly because it started to look like it was about to burn.  I also didn't have buttermilk at home so I made it using regular milk, I added 1 tablespoon of lemon in it and let it sit for 10 minutes. Voila! Buttermilk.

This is the first banana bread I've made away from home without my Mother's family recipe. So I was a tough critic when it came to tasting the banana bread. It was absolutely everything I thought it should be! :-) My Dad also ate it with me and he raved about the crust being just a tad crispy and the inside having the perfect amount of moistness. I have added this recipe to my DIY cook book. I took the suggestions from a fellow chef on here and instead of * 1 1/2 cups of white sugar* I did 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar* I also added the *1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla*

husband loved this recipe. i did make a few changes
instead of veggie oil, i used one cup of unsweetened applesauce; used 1/2c of white sugar and 1/2c of brown sugar; used 3 riped bananas; added 1 tsp of cinnamon and dash of vanilla extract. i didnt have buttermilk but found a way to make it via internet. i mixed 1c of milk with 4 1/2tsp of white vinegar and let it stand for 15 minutes. Cooked for only 65 min or so...the bread came out moist and flavorful. will make again

It was ok. I made 8 mini breads and the rest into a larger pan. The bread came out dark in color and the outside was a bit tough, probably from all the sugar...

Turned out well. Made it following the recipe minus 1/4C of sugar. Next time, I'll decrease the sugar more (to 1C only or even 3/4 C) bit too sweet for my taste. I only had to bake for 1hr 10min on 325F.

Did not make any changes as for our family it was perfect.  Have made it twice now and will be onto number three shortly.  It is a very moist banana bread which freezes well.  It does not last long in house.

Hands down, the best. On the first go I did it exactly to the recipe and it was too sweet for me but this recipe was so easy to adapt to my taste (and make it more toddler friendly) this recipe helped me ease into getting my two toddlers to try new breads like carrot, zucchini, etc :)

I was looking for a banana bread recipe that called for oil and not butter, as my son is lactose intolerant.  I made buttermilk by putting 1 t of white vinegar into a measuring cup, then pouring in lactose-free milk to make 1/3 cup.  It baked up very well and I was surprised that it tasted so rich without the butter.  I'm sure the buttermilk made the difference.  This might be my new banana bread recipe!

The taste and moisture is excellent. I decided to bake them as muffins. I put them into muffin baking tin cups which I sprayed.  I changed the oven temperature to 300 convection bake and cooked them for 30-35 minutes. I did brush the tops with butter and dipped the tops into some cinnamon sugar.

The recipe was tasty, but the batter overflowed the correct size pan and it formed a hard unpleasant crust on top.

Great recipe, for a year now I have have been looking for this recipe but could not find it.  It turns out that I have been looking in wrong place (the food network) website.
Thanks for the best banana banana I have ever tasted.

Just the texture - moist and delicious!  My daughter said that she does not like banana bread, but when she smelled this in the oven she decided that she had to try some.  In fact, my family could not wait for it to cool completely and ate it while still hot from the oven.  Several other reviewers have mentioned that it freezes well, but we will never know because it will never make it to the freezer in our house!

My bananas were very ripe, so I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups.  I also added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon for a bit of extra flavor.  This will be my go-to banana bread recipe (and the reason that I will frequently buy butter milk!)

I've been making the same banana nut bread from my local church cookbook for years, but with a bunch of very ripe bananas and the cookbook nowhere to be found I decided to try this one. The popularity of this recipe is very much deserved. Following the directons exactly yielded a very moist, dense and perfectly sweetened loaf. The crust has a wonderful texture and this bread is excellent the next day pan-toasted in just a bit of butter. This will be my new go - to banana bread. Thank you!

Wonderful made as indicated in the recipe but also greeat with some of the suggested modifications.  I did not have enough bananas but had some pineapple that needed to be used up so I mashed that and added it.  Also used cinnamon sugar dusted on the pans and on the top.  Really yummy!

Seriously, this is the best banana bread recipe I've ever tried! For years I've been using the Betty Crocker recipe, which is really good, but a coworker brought this recipe to work and I couldn't stop eating it! It's moist and delicious! My coworker added blueberries in lieu of the pecans because they were in season here in Michigan, and I highly recommend this change if you like blueberries...or even if you don't. I made it myself and it turned out just as good. I may up the banana to 1.5 cups, but only because the banana flavor using 1 cup is very delicate. Can't wait to try it again using the pecans. I'm sure it will be just as good!

Decided to make this given I had a huge yellow plantain about to go bad. Didn't have buttermilk so subbed vanilla yogurt. Replaced 1/2 cup white sugar for Brown (going for a more molasses-y flavor), added cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. Used coconut oil for the oil (only other vegetable oil I had was Olive :) ha!).  I generally think banana bread is pretty meh and not worth the ingredients to make but this was absolutely an impressive and delicious baked good I will be making again and again! Thank you to the poster for letting us know this is great to freeze and thank you to the reviewer who suggested the substitution of yogurt for buttermilk!

This bread is moist, and I love the addition of buttermilk.  However, like many other reviewers, I had to change it to fit my tastes. I halved the sugar (it's WAY too sweet), added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and baked it at 350 degrees for about 50 minutes.  I think whole wheat pastry flour is great in banana bread too.

By the way, I'd like to add a note to me earlier review, in response to others, that I think there's nothing wrong with calling this bread the "best ever" and then suggesting changes or substitutes. This is an excellent "base" recipe, when there are lots of others out there that are not. Plus, it's fun to change it up. Even published, professional cooks would agree with this. Finally, this should be a community of people sharing ideas and experiences. We can all experiment and learn from one another, and should :)

Very good banana bread.  I made 4 mini loaves out of one recipe and the only change I made was using 1/4 cup less sugar and walnuts instead of pecans.  I did make another batch (for me) lightened up a bit using egg beaters for eggs and applesauce for oil, but either way, this is a tasty version of banana bread.

Great simple recipe. Takes WAY more than 20 minutes to bake. A little more than an hour. Made this 2 times once with applesauce instead of oil to make it healthier. Both times used 3 overripe bananas.

Oh my Gosh! I make this bread every Sunday at the request of my family and it has become a tradition. I added more than One cup of smashed bananas because I wanted more banana taste. This is a huge success and I highly recommend this recipe for anyone!

My daughter used this recipe to make banana bread for the family, We didn't have buttermilk at the time, so we used milk and apple cider vinegar. It makes the bread taste 100% better.Also the bread was fantastic!!!!!!

GREAT recipe! I added a little cinnamon, swapped out 1/4 of the white sugar for brown sugar and was sooooo so happy with how it turned out! Literally I am sitting here talking myself out of a 3rd slice. There may be none left by the time my poor husband comes home later!

We followed another reviewer's suggestion to split the sugar to 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, add 1 teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon, and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.  The bread was missing something (maybe more salt?) and the chocolate chips made it a little too sweet, but it didn't keep me from eating three pieces out of the oven.  :)

Darn - now I have to go buy more bananas!  I tried this recipe, wanting to use up some over-ripe bananas.  I've used all the bananas I had and need more bread!  I baked it as mini loaves and as muffins, loved it both ways.

I made this last night without any substitutions. It is good; the best textured banana bread I've made yet. However, I find it a bit too sweet for my taste. I might try reducing or using some sort of raw/turbinado/demerera sugar instead of white granulated sugar next time.

The texture is so much better than banana breads that use butter. This one is moist and tender and the taste is amazing. I like to 
substitute a little whole wheat flour for all-purpose. Enjoy.

This is by far the best banana cake recipe I have tried.  Everyone from my family to office colleagues raved of the taste and texture.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup as the sugar from the riped banana already added to the sweetness.  Thank you Rose.

I used vanilla greek yogurt for buttermilk and did half oil and half applesauce. Very good! It makes a big loaf.

Made it again following recipe but added a little vanilla. Used whole milk w/vinegar as a buttermilk hack. Topped with brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. Great!

I definitely love this recipe and have already made it multiple time and it came out wonderful everytime and the kids and hubby love it.

I recommend watching it closely  as the cook time may not be right. I always double the recipe as my hubby likes his with nuts and I prefer mine without. I always end up making 2 big loafs and 1 small one. I set the oven timer for  1hour 10 mins but it will be done way before then so I highly recommend keeping a close eye on it.

Delicious.  I tripled the recipe, used walnuts and a half a bag
of chocolate chips I had.  It made one large and 4 small breads.  I decreased the sugar slightly about 1/4-1/2 cup.  It was sweet enough for my taste.  Moist.  I agree that the buttermilk may be just the ingredient to tip this onto the "best" category!

I change the recipe a little bit, instead of using all white sugar, I substituted 1 cup of white sugar to brown sugar. And I made the buttermilk myself (3/2 tablespoon lemon juice + milk = 1/3 cup of buttermilk). The loaf is actually fluffier then I thought, I don't know if it's because of the brown sugar, since it seems to have this function.

Great recipe! Easy to make with kids! I added buttered the pan, and coated it with cinnamon sugar before pouring the batter in. Substituted milk for buttermilk and it came out great. Everyone loves it! Cooked in 80 minutes as predicted.

I kept the general recipe the exact same, cause really why change perfection, but before putting it in the oven to cook I sprinkle a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon over the top for added flavour when done. Delicious

I made this twice.  The first time, all I could taste was the vegetable oil.  I made it a 2nd time, but substituted a mixture of melted butter and coconut oil.  It was delicious, but so dense and overly-moist that  was collapsing on itself the next day.

Based on the recipe as written, it's too oily for my taste.  I'll have to try it again, looking at the reviews for cutting back on the oil.

Finally, a banana bread that stays moist!  I was worried when it didn't rise as most breads do, but it worked out fine, as did doubling the recipe.  It will be my new "go to" when all the bananas go at once.

This is a really excellent recipe.  I do make a few adjustments, but on its own, it's great, too.
I add about 2-2&1/2 Cups banana, a bunch of cinnamon, and about 1&1/2 cups chopped pecans.

I adjusted this recipe based on something a coworker had done.   I substituted 3/4 cup of flour for 3/4 cup of brownie mix and added 1/3 cup chocolate chips.  It needed an extra 5 minutes in the oven but turned out amazing!  It is moist and dense and just chocolately enough but not so much to take away from the banana flavor.

I added mini chocolate chips. I don't like Banana Bread usually but I had to try it since I had never made it before and it was fabulous! The best is no joke!

Liked this one a lot. Followed the recommendation of a few others on some modifications -- used 1 banana; 2/3c applesauce (instead of oil); added 1 tsp of cinnamon; added 1/2 c of raisins; used 1/2c white sugar, 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2 c stevia powder; used 1c AP flour and 3/4c wheat flour. I used lowfat buttermilk (since I had some and am trying to use it up).

All I have is a mini-loaf pan - and this came out to 6 mini loafs. I cooked it at 350 for 25 minutes -- came out great. A little crunch on top, I would say density is medium, while retaining plenty of moisture.

This was pretty good. I made it mainly because it did not call for cinnamon and I have a child in my daycare that is allergic.  I used sour cream instead of buttermilk simply because I did not have buttermilk on hand. Turned out pretty good and the kids liked it.  I will make this again for my daycare kids, but for me I prefer a little more flavor, vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar and applesauce in the one I make for our family.

My husband is super picky and he loves this! His friends always ask me to make extra so they can take some home. I make muffins, which have a shorter bake time and I sometimes add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, also use half white and half brown sugar. They always come out great! Thanks for sharing this recipe:)

Like others I thought this bread was too sweet, but I did not run into any problems with undercooking or it sticking to the pan. Since I am trying it again but with changes I thought the origonal recipe only deserved 3 stars.

I have this recipe several times due to the simplicity and your bread always is delicious. I take whole milk and add white vinegar to it plusI use three times the pecans it calls for then I grind them up in my food chopper .And I always use 3 times the bananas and if needed add more eggs and flour.Lastly I add one to two tsp. of banana extract to the mix and WHAM ,put it in the oven. By the time I'm done with it you may need to see a heart Dr. because heart problems or weight gain are the last thing I'm thinking about. Go ahead ,tell me I'm not a healthy cook.But so far I haven't had any complaints.My biggest problem is hiding it before everyone eats every bit of it.No photo required,mine looks like the rest of them

This is a keeper!  I needed to do something with the 1 1/2 old bananas I had, so I cut this recipe in half and made 9 muffins.  I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes.  I replaced the pecans with chocolate chips and added a crumb topping.  Moist and yummy!

delicious as gluten free with 2 small tweaks. I used Pamelas artisan flour blend.which is a gluten free all purpose flour. I also added one small packet of yeast. I let it sit for about 10 minutes before putting it in the oven. It turned out amazing. My 2 year old had a fit when I finally had to cut her off this morning. I am so excited to find a recipe I can use that's gluten free and does not taste it!

Nice banana bread. We used honey instead of sugar and cut it back a bit so it wouldn't be too sweet; good flavor.

Really good, but not as good as Banana Banana Bread, that is if you prefer more dense/moist banana bread. This one is more like a cake in texture.

This was great! I used applesause in place of the fat and added a tsp of cinnamon and dash of vanilla. It was really good! I think that next time I would add half the cinnamon. =)

I have made this recipe twice now, and it's a huge hit both at home and at work. The only deviation from the recipe was fat-free buttermilk instead of regular, and that was completely unintentional! I also lowered the oven temp down to ~315 because I have a dark loaf pan. The banana bread is so moist and delicious. This is now my go-to banana bread recipe! Thanks, Rose, for this amazing recipe.

I liked it, but it didn't taste banana-y enough. It was too bland for me. It needs something else, but I'm not an experienced baker.

Just baked this and really yum! Most times, I make some twist to recipes I'd find online but glad I didn't change a thing with this one. Having said that, using 1 cup sugar instead of the listed quantity would be the way to go for me next time I bake this.

I followed Georgias suggestions. I was skeptical right out of the oven, the banana bread seemed over cooked and average flavor. I put it in a Ziploc bag and put it in the fridge... however the next day I opened up the bag to the best banana bread I have EVER had. The term that came to mind although doesn't conceptually make sense is pudding like.

Well, if the other 999+ ratings didn't convince you, here's another one. I love this bread. I used coconut milk instead of buttermilk (I was out of milk and didn't want to run to the store) and I added a tsp of vanilla. Thanks for sharing!

This is good but too sweet as written. The second time I made it I used just a cup of sugar and half whole wheat flour and it was much better. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg because it's pretty boring and sweet otherwise.

I added a tsp of both vanilla and cinnamon and I replaced some of the sugar with brown sugar. I also replaced about half the flour with whole wheat flour. Finally, I added some chocolate chips because who doesn't like banana and chocolate? Wonderful results

Great banana bread. I made a couple additions. I added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon. I used 2 loaf pans and shortened the baking time to about 40 minutes. I omitted the nuts. Perfect.

This is by far the best ever Banana Bread ever tasted, so moist and tasty. It is very easy to prepare. It has been enjoyed by friends and family and keep requesting more they think it is some kind of family secret recipe but little do they know it's not.

We loved this recipe just the way it is presented. My husband isn't usually fond of banana bread, but we had some over ripe bananas and I looked for a recipe online. Found this one and used it. Today, he's asked me to make it again. Amazing. Didn't save it before, but found it again and am saving this recipe for future use.

Two words describe this banana bread,...Yum- my!!
I substituted the pecans (which I didn't have) for chocolate chips (which I did have) and it was delicious!  I needed to bake it about 15-20 minutes longer than the recipe states, but that just made a nice crunchy top!

Awesome recipe. I took the advise of others, using 1 cup of white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar, instead of 1 1/2 cups of white sugar. I also like to add a tsp of vanilla, but otherwise follow to the letter. This is the 3rd or 4th time making this & so far everybody loves it! Thanks for the recipe Rose!

This is the worst banana bread recipe I have ever tasted.  It is way too sweet and is more like pudding than bread (it's not that I undercooked it either) It was stodgy and blah!

YUMMY This is the best, moistest banana bread I have ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly and used 3 whole really ripe mashed bananas. I made 2 loaves at first then my family gobbled them up and asked me to make more. This will now be my recipe to go to. Thanks for the post.

I loved this recipe - I didn't make any modifications other than adding a cup of blueberries. It was delicious!! Very moist and sticky. I made it last week and my husband devoured it - making another one this morning! It didn't need anything else but I think I may add some vanilla next time as people are suggesting. But the recipe is already perfect as is.

Yum. This was delicious, moist, sweet, crunchy on top, just wonderful.
I suppose it's not fair of me to review this since I did it with MANY substitutions. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used plain milk + vinegar. I was almost out of baking soda, so I used up what I had plus some baking powder. I used canola oil plus some olive oil. And I didn't even have enough banana, so I made up the difference with applesauce. 
I imagine this recipe would be even better if i used the right stuff.

I made two batches, because I used 3 8-inch loaf pans. One loaf was plain, one with raisins, and one with chocolate chips. I would say that depending on the oven, it may mean a few more minutes. But regardless, this is a great and easy recipe! Delicious!

This was very excellent bread.  I have made it a second time exactly according to the instructions.  The baking time is just a little too long.  Perhaps 5 minutes shorter.  It is very moist and dense.

I wish I knew if this was any good -- I brought it to a potluck and it was like that movie:  Gone in 60 Seconds.  I'm assuming it was delicious!  I did make a couple of tweaks to the recipe.  I didn't have any buttermilk so for S & G's I replaced the buttermilk with sour cream.  No I did not use the low-fat kind, and I'm NOT sorry, not at all!  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon, per Georgia's suggestion (the Oh my GAAAAWWDDD review).  I have been going to a weekly wine/food potluck for a while now, and my dishes have been just meh lately.  Methinks I have redeemed myself with this one, though.

Absolutely the best I have ever made...just added a little cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg. I used brown sugar instead of white and prepped the loaf pan with butter and almond flour...it was gone in one day...next time I will double the recipe...thanks, Rose!!!

I love this recipe. Just got done making it. I did add vanilla and cinnamon and used walnuts(didn't have pecans). I also used an 8x8 square glass pan and it came out great. This is a keeper.

Truer words have never been used about banana bread! I can see why there have been so many great reviews.  I have fixed it as is, and have varied it as have others - with half wheat flour, half brown sugar. It is always devoured quickly, no matter what. Our oven bakes a little hot - so watching temp is crucial. But this is great.

OK, when this recipe said "best ever" I was skeptical, but now after making it I definitely agree!!  Not too sweet, yummy banana flavor and perfect texture.  Definitely a keeper.

The flavor was good, however, very dense. I prefer a lighter bread. I did substitute brown sugar for granulated and added 1 tsp. cinnamon.

Loved it, I chose this recipe because it called for oil instead of butter. I subbed out the milk because of an allergy but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My family has devoured the loaf in under an hour and everyone was very happy. The only thing is, mine was cooked in about 50 min. I did it in a loaf pan like the recipe said, so just watch your bread and when it smells done its definitely done. A sure keeper, I will be making this my main banana bread recipe. Super quick and easy too

I made this recipe yesterday and it is very moist with slight crispy top.  I only added 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.  But these are defintely taste as good as it looks. I just made muffins instead to ensure everyone  gets some :-) .

I have been making this recipe for a while now and my whole family loves it.  My husband decided he wanted some pumpkin bread so I used this recipe, substituted the bananas w/1 small can of pumpkin (not the pie mix), added pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon to taste and it is PHENOMENAL!!!  So moist and delicious!!!!

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......This banana cake is DIVINE! just made this and i did not change the recipe at all and they came out soft, and fluffy, albeit a little sweet for me but this could be due to the overripe bananas I used. There goes my diet! Lol! Thanks Rose for sharing :D

This is my first try at banana bread, and I loved it! I overfilled the pan because I assumed that the bread would be heavy and wouldn't rise- not so! This was light and tasty. I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts and thought it worked really well. My only problem was that I couldn't get it out of the pan- maybe I should have used more cooking spray or crisco.

I made this last night when I realized I had a couple bananas that needed to get used up.   I made only 1 change and that was to substitute almonds for the pecans since that's what I had on hand.    It's a very moist, sweet loaf of bread.   It would be good with pecans or walnuts also.

By far the best recipe ever. Weird thing is that it varied when I cooked it in a ceramic loaf pan, which tasted amazing, came out drier when I cooked it in a glass loaf pan. But any how, will never use any other recipe again. 
Thanks.

I love it and everyone who has had it loved it as well. i added some cinnamon and dark chocolate chips and it is fantastic. Also, instead of butter milk ( they do not have it in my country) I added plain yoghurt and some lemon juice. I also add some vanilla to make less eggy.

I love this recipe.  I often double it, sometimes I make the mini muffins for the kids for school.  I took it to a church potluck and literally everyone asked for the recipe.  That is high praise for me! The only thing I change is the vegetable oil to applesauce.

This recipe seemed so close to perfection that I made it twice in one afternoon.  Because I made a significant change, I rated it only 4 stars.  After reading many of the earlier comments, I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and, because we love them so, added 1/2 cup of sultanas.  My son loves his with chocolate chips, so I did another with the reduced sugar and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.  I've never tasted a better banana bread.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

For our anniversary yesterday I made my husband 4 different kinds of Banana Bread. He LOVES Banana Bread and is a self proclaimed "expert". After taking one bite of this recipe he said, "This is not Banana Bread. don't make this any more". Sorry.

I'm on a hunt for a perfect banana bread recipe and I feel like this is close but not quite there.
It has a really nice color and texture but doesn't seem to cook evenly.
Extra 1/4 cup of banana tasted better than the 1 cup called for.
Considerably less cooking time than the recipe calls for, as little as an hour for really moist bread and 70 mins for really well done. Even doing that though I find the edges are borderline over-cooked by the time the center is finished-which is why I only give 4 stars.

Hmmmm...definitely not the best banana bread I;ve ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and found that the middles of the loaves fell in and the sides and edges of the bread were too crispy, as if the sugar carmelized.  Won't be making this one again.

Just fabulous! 

It is rare to have a sweet bread that actually bakes in the amount of time stated in the recipe! I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted nonfat milk with 1 tbsp white distilled vinegar and it worked wonderfully. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top for a nice sweet crunch. This bread's batter appears thin but turns out great! I nearly added more flour when I saw it, so glad I didn't! Just have faith in the recipe!

This was so easy to make, just quadrupled the ingredients and made in a big dishpan.  The bread was perfect and so were the muffins.  Just had to keep testing for doneness.  A great way to use too-ripe bananas.

I doubled this recipe because I had enough ripe bananas that needed to be used. This is not the best recipe for banana bread I have ever tried. I thought the photo was a little unusual as the bread is still in the pan. Maybe the submitter had the same problem I did. Well, I followed directions and "sprayed my pans with non-stick spray coating." I should have greased them with Crisco, as the bread was not about to come out. I have very decent non-stick pans, but they still need Crisco. I really should have known better. Anyway, the loafs are cooling, minus their bottoms. I ate some of the bread that was stuck in the bottom of the pan and I believe it is going to be way too sweet. I'm just glad I didn't waste my pecans on this recipe. I will go back to my old favorite recipe from the Crystal Sugar Co.  I have been using it since I was married... 1959. It's a keeper.

So good! I absolutely love how the crust comes out on this one. I can't get enough of it. I didn't have any buttermilk on hand (we have milk allergies in the house) and used hemp milk instead. I am allergic to pecans and many other nuts, so I left that out as well. I know nearly everyone has drastically changed this recipe, but that was all I did. And it was so delicious. It was gone about as soon as I took it out of the pan.

This recipe was delicious! I don't eat dairy, so I used a little almondmilk with vinegar instead of buttermilk, but that was the only change I made. It was done right at 1 hour and 20 minutes; I was worried it was overdone, but it was perfect. I will definetely make this recipe again and would recommend it to anyone.

I love this recipe. I add vanilla & chocolate chips, but otherwise, I keep it the same. I have been known to run out of buttermilk, so I add vinegar to milk and it still turns out fantastic. It is on the sweet side, but it's tasty and has just enough banana flavor for a wonderful breakfast treat with coffee.

We liked this ,but I am going to stick with my regular recipe, which has more banana flavor and is just as moist. I think buttermilk is sometimes overrated as an ingredient.

I reduced the amount of flour by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of cocoa.  I also used 3/4 cup of roughly chopped raw almonds. The result was  a very moist chocolate banana bread with a nice crunch thanks to the almonds.

Very easy recipe, I made it into mini muffins (made 5 dozen, baked at 325 for 20-22 min) at the Ronald McDonald Family Room where I volunteer.  I am Very surprised at its high rating - not much flavour and blah glue like texture, even though I added chocolate chips (can't bake with nuts here).  They turned out for me, even rose nicely, and didn't turn out dark.  My co-volunteer said they were fine, otherwise i would have rated it a 2.  I will stick to the other recipe on this site, even though its a much bigger recipe.

I kept to recipe with the exception of replacing the buttermilk with unsweetened soy milk.  It came out delicious!  Good for those who cannot tolerate dairy.

Love this recipe!!!  I have never been able to make good banana nut bread, even using my mother's recipe, so this was a first for me. It was moist and delicious. Bread was rather dark and I wondered if it might be better to cook it a shorter length of time at 350 degrees instead.  Regardless, I was totally pleased with the results.

Delicious - one of the best for sure. I used just over a cup of banana to increase the flavor and shortened the cooking time by about 7min. Perfect! Also I had no buttermilk in the house so I used heavy cream to make butter and got 'homemade' buttermilk from the remaining liquid. YUM!

Best banana bread recipe I've tried. I will always use this one. I used the same proportions but used coconut sugar, home made organic hard white wheat flour, organic whole milk instead of buttermilk and olive oil. It was delicious. I also blended the wet ingredients in my blender.

Have been making this every week for a couple of months and it's just the best.  No changes to ingredients except just throw in a couple of small bananas without measuring.  For my oven 1 hour will do.

I made this recipe because I needed a recipe without butter as I was out! So I did modify it a little.. Used half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown. I pureed my bananas and used more than a cup. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and some crushed up Cheerios (my lil guy loves them) no nuts, made my own buttermilk (with milk and vinegar, lemon works too) and it came out delicious! The first time my 11 month old had banana bread and he loved it! Will def save this recipe and make it again! Thank you!

This is fantastic!  I make it into 6 mini-loaves and bake it at 325 degrees for 40 minutes.  The mini-loaves freeze beautifully!

Awesome recipe! The only thing more I did was add cinnamon and sugar on the top before baking. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Made this today & wasn't impressed at all. It was bland & had no flavor. Wasn't a fluffy moist but a heavy bread. It didn't raise well at all like my other recipe. I have made many different recipes & this one is not the best.

I didn't have enough bananas so subbed some home canned applesauce and some yogurt. I also added vanilla. I think most baked things benefit from it. I doubled the recipe and put nuts into one of the loaves. Very good

Excellent! I added some nutmeg, cinnamon & vanilla extract. I also substituted yogurt for the buttermilk, and I would have substituted apple sauce for the oil, but I didn't have any. And I used walnuts instead of pecans.

Wonderful, wonderful recipe!  This is my go-to recipe for banana bread.  Thank you, Rose!
Cooking the way that I do, I often make changes to such excellent recipes to play around.  For my most recent batch, I used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and the rest a good unbleached flour.  I added cinnamon and a smidgen of King Arthur Flour's Fiori di Sicilia, in addition to about 1/2 cup of crystallized soft ginger pieces.  3 mashed bananas.  Added walnuts instead of pecans.  At any rate, it's my variation on Rose's perfection.  Also divine!

Delicious and pretty easy to make! Only subbed vanilla yogurt for buttermilk b/c I didn't want to buy a whole bottle of buttermilk for one recipe.

Really great recipe.  I've made it twice, and though I couldn't have any due to my banana allergy (hands got really itchy just from handling the bananas), I got very positive responses.  The second time I made it was out of popular demand! The only change I made was in adding a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.

This is an awesome recipe. I made this today and subbed 1/4 of the flour with cocoa powder and used clabbered milk as I didn't have any buttermilk on hand. Came out amazing. I am not a fan of banana bread, so I had to comment on how wonderful this is. Now I need to hide the loaf from my 11 & 13 year old sons before they eat it all and none is left for their dad to try, heh.

My roommate didn't eat all of his bananas before they turned brown/black so he gave them to me to make banana bread. I looked through reviews on recipes for 2 days before I decided to make this one. I'm SOOOO glad I did. This recipe makes the most amazingly moist bread. I only changed the sugar. I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I added cinnamon, vanilla and sprinkled the top with brown and white sugar and walnuts. My boyfriend said it was as good as his mom's!

I loved this very simple recipe, the banana bread was very moist and tasty.  I did not have buttermilk, so I made my own by adding some white vinegar to milk, and allowing it to sit for a few minutes.  Works very well.

This truly is the gold standard for Banana Bread.  I have been using this recipe for years now.  To lessen the amount of oil I've made it with 1/4 cup of oil and a quarter cup of applesauce with no difference in taste.

i followed some reviews and used 1 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and used 3 bananas. Also I baked it at 350 for about an hour and 15 before it was done all the way thru. I did not put nuts in mine. The bread turned out great! Very moist, we loved the bread!! I will make this again for sure!

This is almost exactly the recipe I make. It was randomly chosen out of a large cookbook with several banana bread recipes. I don't put nuts in mine but I do make small loaves. My recipe makes 4 small loaves. I think it's the combination of small loaves and buttermilk that make this the best recipe ever. I have never heard any criticisms of this recipe.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with only changing the oil for apple sauce. as stated.  It did have a different taste than the banana bread that I usually make.  It was not as dense  It has a lot more moisture than my normal recipe that my mother passed down to me.   i would definitely make it again.

Definetly lives up to the name, made this as is first time and was amazing but only making one loaf it lasted 2 seconds in my house. Since then I have modified the recipe to my personal preferences using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 splenda, egg whites instead of whole eggs and applesauce instead of oil which not only makes it healthier but extra moist and flavorfull, i add cinnamon and vanilla, and we like enlish walnuts in place of pecans for this particular recipe, the buttermilk is what makes this recipe stand out from the rest which i also use fat free buttermilk.

I use this recipe all the time.  It's my go-to banana bread but I must say one thing.  I NEVER use as much sugar as it calls for.  I just doubled the batch tonight and used about 3/4 cup of sugar total!  It really doesn't need as much sugar as it calls for unless you're looking for dessert.  I do it with less all the time and my kids eat it up.  Yum!

Very good even after frozen. Moist with wonderful flavor. A keeper!!!!
6/17/17 - Substituted 1 container of plain greek yogurt for buttermilk.  Still remains excellent.  Try unsweetened applesauce as sub for oil next time.

A good base to start from; I didn't have a cup of mashed banana so I added enough applesauce to make a cup. I also only used 1 C sugar, and used 3/4 C whole wheat pastry flour in place of the regular flour. Also only used 1/4 C oil and replaced the other 1/4 C called for with more applesauce. It came out GREAT. I think next time I can even cut more sugar out.

The texture and flavor of this recipe are far superior to the recipes that call for butter or margarine. It moist but not oily like I find those recipes to be. Excellent banana flavor. Thanks for sharing.

This really was the best banana bread recipe I've ever had! It is super moist and my family loved it. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and it worked fine, will probably use all brown the next time. I also left out pecans and added chocolate chips. Saving this recipe for my "go to" banana bread recipe from now on! Yum :)

Just made this a little earlier today and it came out great! I substituted shaved almonds for pecans. Love the slightly crunchy outer crust then the inside is nice and moist.

Not enough banana flavor.  A bit too sweet.  But very moist.

My husband's favorite.  He craves this specific recipe every so often.  I have tried other banana bread recipes, but he always wants me to make this one.

This had basically become my famous banana bread - been making it for years and people beg for a loaf.

This really was the best banana bread ever!  Highly recommend.  Threw in some chocolate chips and that just made them even better!  I've already made this recipe 3 times in the last 2 months.

No modifications needed. It did cook a little faster than I expected (1 hour), but I was keeping an eye on it ;)

Definitely believe the hype on this recipe. It is delicious and so very easy to make. Actually, I put the wet recipes in the blender...a little less clean up. The kitchen smelled fantastic. 

In addition to the nuts, I added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Delicious! Making it again for my mom when I go down to visit her tomorrow.

I made this Banana Bread and it was great! Super moist and yummy! However, i sustituted the vegetable oil with apple sauce 1 to 1. Super yummy and i added walnuts instead of pecans. Everyone loved it!

I would agree with most people and it's a very good recipe.  I does have a very pronounced crust and it's probably due to the high sugar content.  I normally do a receipt with sour cream, but I was out and had some buttermilk so I tried this recipe.  I do prefer my recipe with sour cream and it's has a lot less sugar, however, this is great BB and it all comes down to the style of BB you like.

Additions:
I added 1 tsp Vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp Cinnamon
Kept everything else the same

This bread was great. I replaced the 1/2 cup of oil with apple sauce, added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and about a cup of chocolate chips. I think I could have cut the sugar even more (I only used 1 cup and 1/4)! The bread was super moist and delicious.

Add cinnamon chips, use whole wheat flour and almond flour. Used brown sugar!  I feel good about giving it 5 stars since I used the same measurements. I am certain had I used white flour, white sugar and not used a partial amount of almond flour ( you can substitute up to 50% of  regular flour with almond, hazelnut or oat flour) it would still be outstanding. The ratios of the recipe are perfect..moist moist moist and yummy!  Thank you

Amazing and easy recipe! I made it as it is but added 1 tsp of each of vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a mix of roughly chopped walnuts and pecans, I stirred it at the end. I used 3 large overripe bananas mashed with some lemon juice and zest. I love the texture. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1 cup and I'll bake it in mini loaf tins.

Wow...I have baked alot of bread in my time..but this was awesome! After reading some reviews, I added a 1/4 Ts. of Bakng Powder, as well, and 1/2 Ts. of Vanilla. It was simple and turned out really "Down Home". I might also add, that my oven is broken, so I made them in a small convection/toaster oven! It made 5 perfect mini loaves. I was so affraid how they would turn out. Perfect little Tea Breads for my friends! I did add 1/2 cup more walnuts, only because i want a nut in every bite....this recipe rocks..try it!!!!

I absolutely LOVE very sweet treats but using 1 1/2 C of white sugar made it overly cloyingly sweet. I will try with less sugar next time but other than that I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. The bread was very moist and delicious just couldn't eat that much at once due to the sugar level but will def make again.  
My fault for not re-visiting the reviews before actually cooking it! Probably would be 5 star if I did.

This was a bit bland for me. Even though I added more bananas, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and sprinkled with chocolate chips, I still found it lacking in flavor. Maybe next time I would add chocolate chips throughout the whole bread.

My whole family loves this recipe!  I've already made at least 6 in the past 3 weeks!  Thank you!  I had a tip if you didn't happen to have buttermilk handy:  1 cup milk (skim is ok)with 1 TBSP lemon juice, set aside for 5 minutes and there's your buttermilk substitute!  Still tastes awesome!  Also, I've added melted chocolate, ground walnuts and "craisins" to this as well, and it's still sooooooooo yummy!  Chocolate chips were too heavy for this batter, and sunk to the bottom... fyi.

Perfect combo of moist and dense bread. I noticed this recipe was basic for making it suit the person baking it. I added to mine a dash of vanilla, one whole nutmeg grated, walnuts instead of pecans, and some semi-sweet chips. Was amazing! One note was, when I checked the loaf after 55 mins, it was done. My advice, check yours too, the cooking time seems generous to me. 

***I also made these into a breakfast treat the next day. Banana loaf french toast anyone? They were so decadent!

Mmmmmm there is nothing quite like the smell of banana bread baking:)I really liked this recipe,it was a bit on the sweet side so next time,I will add less sugar or perhaps do as others suggested and switch to a blend of white/brown sugar.Nice banana flavor and the buttermilk adds some richness,I used nonfat to save calories but it was still delicious and moist.I also used muffin tins instead of a loaf pan,the recipe made sixteen generously-sized muffins.

This is an awesome recipe. I have tried a lot of recipes but this is the best one, along with being very moist. I used a little more of bananas, and since I didn't have buttermilk, regular milk worked just fine!

My husband  and I tried several Banana Bread recipes and could not find one that came out right.  We tried this one and finally found a keeper! It was easy to make and quick.  Not a lot of ingredients or steps.  Delicious!

OMG!!!! I made this banana bread today and it is delicious! I made some changes and addition to the original recipe. I added half tsp of cinammon powder and one more egg. Just becuase I do not have buttermilk and vegetable oil I used half a stick of butter and 1/4 cup of regular milk, used 1/2 a cup of extra virgin olive oil instead. ah...it turns out sooo good and moist. I am on a calorie count diet but a slice won't hurt. My husband just love it and advice me to stick to the recipe. For allergy reason I skip the nuts.

Was great!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white, 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and a dash of vanilla.  Yummy

Okay...this is my first review of a recipe. I made this bread just like the recipes stated and it was soooooo good! Then I made a few changes simply to make it more nutritous and lower calorie. I used applesauce for the oil, vanilla Greek yogurt for the buttermilk, 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 stevia, 1/4 c egg beater and 1real egg, 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 all purpose flour. My family loved the healthier version!  I only had two smaller loaf pans so I reduced the temp to 325 and baked them for 50 minutes.....perfect! I added chocolate chips to one loaf. This is a great recipe that you can easily modify to meet your own taste.

This bread is delicious! It was so incredibly moist however that I had to add about 15 minutes to the cook time as I was using a deep loaf pan.

Moist and flavorful! Got rave reviews from family and friends about this banana bread. Tastes better the next day (of course) so try to be patient and let it sit until then... Worth it!

Wow! This was absolutely delicious....I took the advice of someones review and added a cream topping to it. 4 oz cream cheese mixed with 1 cup powder sugar, 3 Tbs milk and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Superb! I baked it in two smaller loaf pans with my convection bake for 65 minutes. SO MOIST it tasted like a cake!

I had the black bananas but no butter at room temp (I normally use Banana Banana Bread and just add cinnamon and nutmeg).  I followed directions only adding a splash of vanilla and maybe 1/2 to 1 tsp cinnamon.  Baked at 350 for 1 hour, toothpick inserted into the center came out clean.  I let it sit overnight and cut/buttered slices for my man to take onto his job.  It seems like maybe not enough flour for the amount of liquid (eggs, buttermilk, oil, bananas)?  It's just SO dense and moist-and I'm usually a fan of those aspects in a quick bread!  Flavor-wise it's good.  Nothing wrong with it persay but I think I'll stick to the banana bread recipe that uses butter and more flour.  Something might have gone wrong for me since everyone else just loves it, I'm still glad I tried it..thanks for sharing!

The results were not bad, but not great either. We did tweak the recipe slightly, using soy milk instead of buttermilk, so that may have affected the outcome. We baked it at the recommended temperature and it came out a bit burnt... may have been the oven we were using.

My husband loves banana bread and he wants healthy ingredients, so I substituted the oil with vegan margarine (Becel), the buttermik with Almond milk, 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla
 and the bananas are over ripe. I half it to two - one half was added with bran flakes (from cereals) and raisins, and the other half I made it plain. Both came out very moist and tasty!

EXCELLENT!!!  I made this bread and the "Banana Sour Cream Bread" within a few weeks of each other and this was definitely my favorite of the two.  I doubled the recipe to use up the 5 overripe bananas I had on hand (which yielded just a little more than 2 cups, once mashed)...and actually chose the recipe to use up some buttermilk.  WOW!  It was very moist and had excellent flavor!  It's also worth noting that this bread is very forgiving...my newborn woke up and wanted to nurse towards the end of the baking, so I had to turn off the oven and leave the door cracked as I could not give it my attention at that moment.  I went back to it later and found that it was still very underdone in the center.  I turned the oven back on and baked it for another 20 minutes, all the while thinking the final product would surely suffer, but it came out delicious despite the fragmented baking.

This is the BEST banana bread recipe which yields a nice, moist dough.  The only recipe I use for banana bread and I've been baking for quite a while.  The buttermilk makes a significant flavor & texture difference.

Great recipe! Didn't want to buy buttermilk. For 1/3 cup, I used 1% milk with one teaspoon of white vinegar. Let stand for five minutes. Then mix.  Followed the rest of the recipe.  Baked on the third rack counting from top.  Gave a nice top layer!  Will definitely make again!

This was AMAZING! The only 2 things I changed was instead of buttermilk I used greek honey yogurt and instead of the oil I used applesauce (one of those little snack size) This was so so moist and EVERYONE who tried it loved it!

I have to admit that this is the best banana bread that I've ever made.  I made one slight change and used dry buttermilk powder and water, instead of liquid buttermilk.  You can also substitute sour milk (1 tsp. vinegar to  1/3 C. milk) if you don't have buttermilk or buttermilk powder.  Next time I have over-ripe bananas, I will definitely be making this!

Yeah, this bread totally rocks.  For some reason, though, mine only took 40 min at the recommended temperature (9x5 loaf). Might have taken less than that if I had checked it earlier.

Have to say, followed the recipe except did it with walnuts instead of pecans.  Not my best...  probably won't make this one again.  Maybe the baking time was too long??  was very dry??

this is moist and dense and delicious!  i used chocolate chips instead of pecans and found that my loaves (i made 2 out of this recipe) stuck to the bottom of the pans even with spraying them first.  i would recommend flouring them as well.  also, i only baked mine for about an hour and they were baked perfectly.

A very good recipe that yields a moist and delicious loaf. However, I reduced the quantity of sugar to 2/3 cup as I thought the amount  specified in the recipe to be excessive, particularly since over-ripe bananas were being used. It was still very good. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was an awesome easy recipe. I decided to do a little variation, as follows. I doubled the recipe using plain yogurt in place of the buttermilk. After all of the ingredients are mixed I separated the batter. In one half of the batter I used about a cup of chocolate chips. In the second batter I used 3/4 cup white chocolate chips, 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 8 thinly sliced strawberries. Pour into separate bread pans and viola! two yummy breads :)

Great basic recipe! Like another reviewer I cut the oil in half and used apple sauce (to make it a bit healthier) and used half white/half brown sugar. Also added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla, and used raisins instead of nuts due to a family nut allergy. In my humble opinion, buttermilk is the only way to go went making banana bread!

Awesome flavor and moistness.  I did substitute half cinnamon flavored apple sauce for half the oil and added a handful of fresh blueberries which tasted amazing in this bread.  Great recipe!!

I was really skeptical at how long it took to bake at first glance at this recipe, I'll admit... But I was pleasantly surprised! This bread was moist on the inside, light crunchy on the outside- everything a banana bread should be! Thanks for the great recipe! Definitely a staple to my baking repetoir.

Oh my goodness, this banana bread is delicious! It's the second time I've made banana bread and it turned out PERFECTLY. It works well with muffins or baked in a pan. Just add 1/2 a tsp of cinammon and 1 tsp of vanilla and it's delicious! I also used 4 medium bananas which was more than a cup, but the bread turned out very moist. Will make again ;)

Very, very good!  I baked it in a small (8ishx6ish?) rectangular cake pan and had enough batter leftover to make four muffins. I didn't have buttermilk but had plain yogurt that needed to be used, so I substituted that and it worked perfectly. I reduced the sugar just a bit because my little boy voted to add a handful of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips :)  This will not last long!

Great recipe. I baked it only about an hour and it was perfect. Very moist. I took the advice of another person and made a topping out of finely crushed walnuts and cinnamon.  Gave it that extra little wow.

Pretty good. Very similar to the one in my very old Betty Crocker cookbook but I prefer that one.  The BC recipe makes a taller loaf (same size pan) and is more flavorful. This is nice and  moist-just not my favorite.

This is a wonderful banana bread!  I used part brown sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did sprinkle the bottom of the loaf pan with sugar as suggested by another reviewer and also added the topping of 2Tb nuts,2 Tbs sugar,1/2 tsp cinnamon and dash of nutmeg. It is so moist and delicious! Thanks for this recipe!!

The best that I have found.  I love to add; blueberries, choc, I'm from NH, so, I love to add maple syrup (use less sugar or none at all) and then make a maple glaze....mmmmmm, my family loves it!   I also have added a package of banana pudding mix to the batter and less sugar.  I have also added Coconut and macadamia nuts crushed.Delicious!

This is the best recipe I've made so far.  I made a couple of changes- I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 yogurt (mainly so I could finish out my sour cream).  I also hadded 1tsp cinnamon and 1/2tsp nutmeg.  I then added an extra 1/4 cup - 1/2 cup of bananas (had one leftover), and about 1/4- 1/2 cup of applesauce.  Oh, and I froze my bananas because I read somewhere that it helps to keep the bread moist.  Great recipe!

Love this one.  I use yogurt instead of buttermilk, honey or agave syrup instead of sugar, and walnuts instead of pecans.  I had an over-ripe peach that I added last time along with a few flakes of unsweetened dark chocolate and some rolled oats . . .  Am making today and will throw in some blueberries that need to be eaten.

Excellent bread.  Prep time was very quick and the taste is amazing - very moist.  I even made a gluten-free version for my Grandfather and that was also very moist and yummy.

Am always searching for a moist banana bread and this is it!  I used 3 large ripe bananas because I don't often stick to only 1 cup of mashed bananas in order to get an intense banana flavor and this did the trick. I also only had egg beaters so used that instead of whole eggs, added a tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of ground ginger.  Took it into work today and it's almost all gone save for the ends!  Oh and used 1 cup packed brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar to give it a more carmelized sweetness.

I always get copliments on this recipe.  The buttermilk makes for a tender, moist bread.  I haven't fiddled using WW flour yet, but I may try that next.     Also, FYI, It's good as a loaf or as muffins. I didn't have the time to make a loaf this morning, so I made muffins instead this morning.  It took about 20 minutes (your oven may vary -- check after 15).  I made about 16 muffins in all.

I love this banana bread recipe. I've made it many times, sometimes following the recipe exactly and sometimes changing it. Any way I make it, it turns out great. I usually use more bananas than called for (maybe 2.5-3 regular sized bananas) and I use a combination of brown sugar and white sugar. Sometimes I'll add 1 tsp of vanilla and replace the buttermilk with lowfat vanilla yogurt. To make it even healthier, use applesauce instead of oil. I bake it in an 8x8 in glass pan at 325 F for 1 hr. I will keep going back to this recipe whenever I get a banana bread craving.

WOW! I decided to throw this together since I had 3 bananas that were WAY over-ripe and some extra buttermilk I needed to use.  Followed the recipe almost to the letter: only used 1c of white sugar & added 1t vanilla as many, many reviews indicated. Also added 3/4c semi-sweet choc chips and topped with chopped walnuts. I made one 9x5 loaf and used the rest of the batter to make muffins. Muffins cooked for about 25min at 325, just pulled them out and they are FAN-freaking-TASTIC! Can't wait for the bread to finish!!

Sadly, I had no nuts in the house but otherwise followed directions exactly-(ok, no, I baked 5 min less and covered w/ foil last 20 min since browning too fast) This bread was delicious! Very moist and fluffy on the inside but chewy and yummy on the outside!  This will be THE banana bread recipe I will always use!

Well, I liked it... a lot, but I'm only giving it a four, cause next time, I will look for a diff recipe. I added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 tsp cinnamon, as well as did the whole 1 cup white 1/2 cup brown sugar. Loved the texture (crunchy outside, soft inside), but something was missing. Worth a try for sure

I make this in a bundt pan. I grease the pan and then "dust" it with sugar.  It is the BEST ever banana bread.

hmmm, this bread is yummy but SO sweet! the only changes I made were to use yogurt instead of buttermilk and whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, and 1 c. sugar instead of 1 1/2 c., but STILL it was a little too sweet for me.  i will keep looking for a better banana bread recipe.

I've been trying a lot of different recipes for banana bread and I thought this was a pretty good one.I made it exactly as written except I added about 1/4 cup of walnuts.Next time I think I would add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and some vanilla.I really like the taste of cinnamon in my banana bread but that's just my preference.This bread did turn out really moist and I do plan on making it again sometime.Theres a few other highly rated banana bread recipes from this site I have to try first though.But this one is a keeper!

This banana bread was good.. not as much banana flavor as I prefer but still yummy.  My favorite is still the Banana Banana Bread from this site but you need alot of bananas for it.  I sub applesauce for the oil and half a cup Whole Wheat flour to make my banana breads a bit healthier. :)

I'd never made banana bread before, and this was super easy and very very yummy... I've been afraid to make banana bread because I was afraid that it wouldn't turn out how I wanted.... however, this was great! Very moist and sweet, just the right amount of everything.. Thank you.

Great recipe indeed. Very moist!  I used very ripe bananas and cut the white sugar down to 1 cup (instead of 1 1/2 cups) - it was still sweet enough for everybody.  Also, i might used about 3/4 cup of chopped pecans - we eyeballed them and it looked like more than the 1/2 cup the recipe called for. Next time i might toast the nuts briefly before chopping them...

I chose this recipe because it doesn't require buttermilk....and it's really good, but I wished it had more banana flavor.

This Banana Bread is Wonderful, I had some over ripe bananas and made this bread for some friends that were staying over,  later that day they bought some more over ripe bananas at the store  and asked me to make another loaf, it's that good. When the bread came out of the oven I rubbed the top of the loaf with softened butter and I used walnuts instead of the pecans, I also greased and floured the pan instead of using the non stick spray

This bread is a rich and delicious banana bread that I gave as gifts over the holiday.  I am now being asked for the recipe from my recipients.  My loafs did cave a bit in the middle but the taste overcame that problem!

This recipe is the best! The only changes  I made was using apple sauce in place of vegetable oil and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and doubled the recipe so the kids could have banana muffins in the morning.

I was skeptical when I read "Best Ever" recipe.  Who would've thought a basic bread could be made into such a wonderful creation!   I used banana yogurt instead of buttermilk.  I used the oil but will try again with cinnamon flavored applesauce, just to see what happens.   Also used 3/4 c. white and 3/4 c. brown sugar.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla and I truly think this adds an unexpected zing to this recipe.  My family went crazy for it, didn't last very long at all.  I highly recommend that you try it.   The only little piece that is left is still moist, 3 days after making this recipe.  One final thought, following the recipe to the letter will yield excellent results but what is also wonderful is that you can tweak it and it will still be "Best Ever".

This is a good recipe with the tangyness of buttermilk but way too sweet for my taste. Even 2 days later it tastes like sugar to me. I plan to cut the sugar down to 1 cup next time to see how that tastes. I used very ripe bananas so they were pretty sweet themselves. All in all a good moist recipe.

So I went to make this and discovered I didn't have any all-purpose flour. I substituted whole wheat bread flour and I also added some dried cranberries. I was worried how it would turn out, but  It was WONDERFUL!  I will make it again and use the whole wheat bread flour again.

Great way to use over ripe bananas.  I couldn't resist throwing a small bag of milk chocolate/peanut butter chips in.  It makes it very rich and very sweet, but so worth the extra calories!!

A staple in our home: in fact, this recipe is the reason I keep powdered buttermilk on hand. I make it every time I have a few over-ripe bananas. I do like the addition of 1 tsp cinnamon, and if I think of it I throw in a tsp of vanilla, too. My kids love it when I dust the pan and the top of the batter with a little cinnamon sugar.

Yum!! I had one (ok, two) hot out of the oven with a little butter slathered on - perfection! I'm on my third (next day) and I have to say I probably cooked them a little too long. I ended up making muffins and was unsure of the cooking time. I also made a few modifications and I can only imagine what they would've tasted like with full fat! Here's what I did - used 1 cup packed brown sugar, 4 small bananas and applesauce instead of oil. Will definitely make again!

Yum Yum Yum! Very good! I did cut back on the veg oil by 1/4 cup and threw in a extra banana and some walnuts. It was awesome and had the house smelling so good too.

This was absolutely wonderful. With three small children, banana bread is a staple for snack time for our family. I will never use another banana bread recipe again. The buttermilk is for sure what makes this recipe so moist. I am going to have buttermilk on hand all of the time. For sure! My husband, who is never a fan of banana bread said that when I made this recipe, it was the best ever, and actually asked for a second piece! :)

Delicious. I've made this several times and the flavor and texture are the best. If I have brown sugar on hand, I'll use that instead of white. And I always put a little more banana and a little more pecan than called for. Always has a nice chewy crust and soft, dense center.

Great banana cake, especially with a few changes * Half white half brown caster sugar * Add 3/4 cup of shredded coconut and almonds or walnuts instead of pecans * Add some spice, for example 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and some allspice and cardamom * 1 teaspoon baking soda AND 1 teaspoon baking powder * 3 large ripe bananas.

Very good and really, pretty easy.  I also used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, per reviews.  I made this a few weeks ago and again this weekend and this time, I added extra banana...I used 1 1/2 cups (for me, that was 3 good sized bananas) and I liked it better this time, with more banana...it was more moist.

This recipe is great! the thing I like about it is that it is light and more cake like than really dense! That is a major plus in my book, and to my 3 little kids! I only added 1 c. sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla, and a TBL. wheat germ! Perfectly light and sweet! i made 2 loaves and cooked them for 30 min. Enjoy...you won't be dissapointed.

Mmmmm...  Really good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but took the advice to sprinkle sugar in the pan after greasing.  It was really good!  UPDATE:  I've made this about a million times.  I just use regular milk and it comes out just fine!

This was very easy, next time I will use LESS sugar! Too sweet even my kids said less sugar.  I substituded butter milk with sour milk and added 1tblsp. of sour cream.  will use again, and again!

YUMM-Y! Quite delicious, most certainly a good base for banana bread. I added milk chocolate chips, and it was so tasty...you'd have to tweak it a bit more to turn it into the healthy banana bread with nuts & such, but I enjoyed my dessert-version. :) thank you!

It was delicious! Moist, great banana flavor, texture was perfect. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used sour cream, and I did add an extra banana after the one cup of mashed bananas as I had one remaining overripe banana. Thank you for the recipe!

Ok, it's offical. This is now my go to banana bread recipe! So moist and sweet, with TONS of banana flavor. I didn't measure the bananas, just put in 3 large ones. Lined some mini muffin tins and they turned out beautifully. So light and fluffy you could actually call them muffins (not just dense banana bread in mini muffin form). I did add a tsp of vanilla to the wet mixture, and a tsp of cinnamon to the dry. But those are just my personal preferences for banana bread flavor. I also used 1% buttermilk, not full fat. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have never been a fan of buttermilk, but this recipe was wonderful. You really dont taste it, but it definately makes a change in the texture of the bread.  Changes:  I ran out of sugar, so was 1/4c. less. And it finished baking in 45 minutes.

GREAT banana bread recipe. I usually stick to banana nut muffin mixes from the store, and tonight i wanted to try something different and from scratch. I used 3 bananas instead of 2, which was about 1 1/2 cups. I also added some vanilla extract, raisins, and cinnamon. This is my first time making banana bread. It is so unbelievably moist. I ate it when it was still steaming fresh from the oven. DELICIOUS!!! Nobody in the house gave it lower than 7 on a scale from one to ten. Thanks you so much for the recipe. I will definately bake this again. :)

Oh my goodness, this is the BEST banana bread ever! I will never need to try a new banana bread recipe again! The texture is lovely, the smell heavenly, and the recipe base fun to work with!  I made mine into 22 regular muffins. They came out perfectly at 30 minutes in the 325 degree F oven.  As many have done, I tweaked it. :-)  1) I used 1/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil, instead of the 1/2 cup of oil, to cut back on fat. 2) Instead of measuring out 1 cup of mashed bananas, I just used the four small/medium ones I had. 3) I used 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white sugar. I would think that so much sugar makes it too sweet but it doesn't. It is just right. 4) To add a little fiber, I used 1 cup of white flour and 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour. Next time I might do 1 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup white. :-) 5) I didn't use the pecans since most members of my family do not like nuts, but I added some pecan bits on top of a few muffins for me. I just put them on, but I would recommend pushing them down a little bit with a back of a spoon so they stay in the muffin and don't pop off when you eat them. 6) I added a splash of vanilla to the egg mixture. 7) I added a heaping 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the sifted flour mixture. 8) Oh, and last, but not least, I added 3 palm/handfuls (my hands aren't very big)of chocolate chips.  I know it sounds like a lot of changes, but most of them are pretty basic. Thank you so much for this recipe, it's going to go into a special box/folder of f

This is a great banana bread.  I was looking for a simple recipe that I couldn't really mess up.  This one was perfect!  I wanted it a little healthier, so I used applesauce in place of oil, whole wheat flour, and I added oats instead of nuts (only because I don't like nuts).  Thanks!

This turned out great! I substituted applesauce for oil and replaced about half a cup of sugar for splenda. I also used four ripe bananas and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. So good!

Delicious. I didn't want it too sweet so I used 3/4 cups of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also added fresh blueberries and omitted the pecans. I think next time i'll add in walnuts. Great recipe!

Wow what a awesome bread... I have made this several times already and it always turns out. I did change a few things like I added cinnamon, nutmeg , and vanilla. This time I even used 1/2 the oil and added 1/2 applesauce still turned out Great! I double everything and make several loafs to give away for teachers lunches ... anyway Happy Baking!PS: I have made this about 5 more times since this review. Its still Awesome we had family here from Ca. and I made 10 loaves and OMG it was gone in a flash! LOL I will be making this one for Christmas gifts this year with out a doubt.If I could give more stars I would.

AMAZING!! I brought this to a shower and it got rave reviews. I followed the suggestions by Georgia (adding vanilla, cinnamon, and topping with mini choc. chips). I didn't have any buttermilk on hand, so I just used regular 1% milk with a splash of lemon juice in it. Used a dark, non-stick loaf pan and baked for 70 min. This was so, SO good! Thanks for the recipe :)

Excellent! Subbed milk with a little lemon for the buttermilk since I didn't have any.  Also added walnuts because that's what I had.  Very moist and flavorful banana bread!

This is a really good recipe.  I have made it a few times and I use vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk.  I use it to make mini-muffins that I freeze in a ziploc bag for quick, on-the-go snacks for the car or school.  My kids love them!  This recipe makes 5 dozen mini-muffins (I use 4 bananas and 1/2 cup walnuts).  I bake them for 18 minutes.  Enjoy!

Excellent recipe.  I added 1 cup of frozen raspberries, made it into muffins and mini-loaves and added a streusel topping.  They were very flavorful and moist.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Very very delicious.  It's moist and flavorful.  Like others, I changed up the recipe a bit.  Use wheat flour instead of white and added a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove.  Will make again and again!

FANTASTIC!! FABULOUS!! AMAZING!! This is the first banana nut bread that I have made that has delighted the entire family and had them asking for more (and more)! It is very moist and tasty! The brown sugar, cinnamon, and nut topping is a must! The recipe is the "pièce de résistance"!! THANKS ROSE!!

The name says it all, it is the "Best Ever Banana Bread" without a doubt! It is moist, flavorful and sweet but everything is balanced so it's not too sweet or too moist. I made mine with walnuts and it was absolutely delish! I didn't change anything besides walnuts instead of pecans, and I only did that because I didn't have any pecans. I ended up making several loaves and gave them out as gifts for Christmas this year. So far everyone has raved about them. This is a permanant part of my recipe collection now.

I used vanilla yogurt in place of the buttermilk and it tasted great! The reason for the "3" was because of the length of time to cook...the outside was almost burned while the inside was still raw.  The smaller loaves turned out beautifully though! So my suggestion is to NOT use the big pan AT ALL, but to use only the small pans.  It tasted great...not as good as my dad's, but still great in it's own way.

My husband LOVES banana bread and this is the best recipe that I have found so far.\
Every time I make this it is perfect. Today I dusted the pan with sugar like one person suggested, and it made the crust SOO good. Not a healthy treat, by any means, but it is OH so yummy!

Fantastic banana bread. I made this exactly as listed for my moms christmas party with her friends and it was very good! I wouldn't make it on a regular basis because it is not very healthy, bu i might try to modify it to keep the flavour but cut down on some of the fat. Overall, EXCELLENT recipe!

This really was the best banana bread ever. I made three small loaves instead of one big one, so that I could make one without the nuts. Both ways were excellent. I brought one loaf to work and everyone raved about it. I would not make any changes to the recipe.

I did not change one thing about this recipe and am glad I didn't because it was perfect just as written!!  I actually doubled the recipe and made one large loaf and two smaller ones (just cooked the smaller loaves about 20 minutes less).  My kids and husband all loved it.  I saved this recipe in my recipe box because this is a recipe that I know I'll be making over and over.  This is an absolutely delicious banana bread that would be great for bake sales, holidays and etc.  Again, you may want to double the recipe, as it'll disappear fast...right out of the oven!  This recipe deserves every single one of those five stars! Thanks so much!

I tried banana bread from the bakery in my local supermarket and LOVED it, but wished I had a recipe that came anywhere close to how great it tasted.  This recipe did just that for me.  It was so moist, sweet and DELICIOUS!  My search for the perfect banana bread recipe is over!

This was alright.... but it was so so sweet. I love sweet, but this was definitely sacchrine...maybe it was the fact that my bananas were previously frozen, but the bread turned out really soggy and the crust never hardened! It kinda had the consistency of fudge X)
But if you're into really really sweet, it's awesome. Again, maybe just the pre-frozen bananas, but this didn't turn out like much of a /bread/.

This is a great banana bread recipe but instead of making loaves I made Muffins and added 1/2 cup extra mashed bananas.I baked them at the same temp. but for only 25 minutes and they were sooo moist and awesome I'll definatly make these again.

This was WONDERFUL! I admit I did change this alittle. I used half & half instead of the buttermilk (only because I didn't have any) and added 1 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I also split it into 2 smaller pan. My family loved it. I made another batch to send with my husband to work for a Thanksgiving week treat. He said it was Great and they wanted more for the Christmas holidays too. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Like others, I changed and added to this recipe, but I really think it would be terrific without my tinkering with the recipe. My husband and I voted that this banana bread was much better than my old bread and rated 5 stars.  I changed the sugar to 1/2 brown sugar, changed the pecans to walnuts (just because they are cheaper here) added some cinnamon (maybe a teaspoon ?)  I doubled the recipe and the first time I made 8 small loaves and the second time I doubled the recipe I got 3 larger loaves.  The pans I used were the disposable aluminum foil as I  plan on giving these as gifts for the holidays.  I wrapped them up secure in foil and then rebagged them in zip bags for the freezer.  When I remove them, I usually add some powdered sugar to the tops or a frosting glaze.  My one friend toasts hers for breakfast.

this recipe did not live up to the hype for me..I was looking for something different and this was not it, I guess that this is the same recipe that I have been using, It's good but I would not say that it is the best ever.

Had some leftover pumpkin puree and not enough banana mush, so I used about half and half each and it made quite a nice pumpkin bread with a slightly banana-y flavor. As other reviews suggested, I used brown sugar instead of white, cut down on the oil, and added a bit of vanilla extract for more flavor. 

Unfortunately, 1 hour 20 minutes was too long to bake this. Mine could have done with 10-15 minutes less to really be moist and yummy. As it was, it still turned out fine. 

Four stars instead of five because of the over-baking and that I've made much better pumpkin bread from other recipes, although I concede that it's not what this recipe was made for. It was still very good.

The name says it all!!! This is the very best banana bread I have EVER eaten. Dense, moist, not too sweet and saturated with banana goodness. My only change to the recipe was that I left the nuts out. This is the only banana bread recipe I will ever need or use again!

My family, friends and coworkers are raving about this banana nut bread! My husband doesn't like nuts so I omit them for him but I make sure to add them for everyone else. Even my picky 2 year old niece told my sister " I want more mama!" Great job guys, thanks!

It is such a nice recipe. My boyfriend loved it and I had to make more because my neighbours wanted some as well. I guess the smell got to them :) 
I made my own buttermilk. Thank you for the recipe.

Thank you very much for this recipe! I tweaked it a little bit for my liking. I added some cinnamon, and added 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar instead of just the white sugar. I also didn't have any buttermilk on hand, so I made some with whole milk and a tablespoon of vinegar. I used 3 ripe bananas which made over a cup. It turned out WONDERFUL! Was very easy to make and full of flavor. :)

Wow!!  This really is the Best Ever Banana Bread!!  I made it exactly as described--next time I may try to play around with the recipe a bit (add chocolate chips, vanilla, cinnamon, etc...) but it is simply wonderful as is.  It's my new banana bread recipe!  Thanks!

This bread is so delicious! I thought the baking time seemed like a lot, but it was perfect, and the 9x5 loaf pan made for a really big loaf. Definitely the best and most moist I've ever had! Try it!

Excellent recipe!!! Moist, dense, sweet like banana bread should be. Not cake like at all. I have been looking for a good banana bread recipe and have tried many before this one.  This is by far the best ever.  Everyone in the family can't get enough.  This is my forever keeper!!!  Thank you.

I substituted buttermilk for evaporated goat milk. I added a little vanilla flavoring. I used evaporated cane sugar. And I swirled in melted semisweet chocolate. DELICIOUS. I say that this is an easy, modifiable recipe.

It's no joke.  This really is the best ever banana bread.  I can't explain it, but when I slice a piece of this bread and enjoy, I SWEAR there is a layer of caramel on top.  Don't get me wrong, there is no caramel...but somehow in the way it cooks, there is a delicious prize on top for all those who partake.

This was soooo moist! The second time I used 1/2 applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, and 1/2 whole wheat patry flour and it was just as good! I used 3 small pans instead of one large, and it still took almost an hour to cook. It doesn't raise real high, but it is delicious!

This is actually identical to bread I used to make from a Fitness Magazine which I lost years ago.  In the magazine, they'd made healthy substitutions which I mimicked.    To make a super healthy loaf, I used whole wheat flour, only 1 c sugar, applesauce instead of oil, skim milk and lemon juice instead of buttermilk (that last since I never have it).  It still tastes awesome (some mini chips in there would be good for a treat) and is perfectly moist and plenty sweet.  Leaving it wrapped up in saran gives the outside that slightly tacky gooeyness to the top crust.  Yum!

This is very yummy.  The bread is moist and my favorite part is the light, sweet crust that seems to form on the top.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to a T and it was great.  The second time I made it, I used 1/4 cup plain yogurt and cut the oil to 1/4 cup.  I also added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and cut the white flour to 1 and 1/4 cup.  It is just a tad bit healthier this way and I really can't tell the difference.

The title says fot itself. The best ever. The most moist banana bread I have ever make compare to other recipes I have found. Only I add raisins and not pecan since my husband is not a nut eater. And add ground cinnamon. Definitely a keeper. Thank you.

I made this banana bread last night and it truly was the best I've ever had.  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe stated (no nuts due to allergy) and it was fantastic.  Thank you so much Rose for sharing your recipe, it has now become my regular banana bread recipe!

Tried an experiment and made two:
Threw in a 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips in one of them, and a 1/4 cup crushed walnuts in the other.  The chocolate one was gone in a flash, but the walnut one hung around for a day.  Both were good, but the chocolate chip one was awesome!

This was by far the best banana bread I've ever made, definitely living up to the name.  I've been in desperate search of perfection for years.  My husband ate half the loaf for a snack!  This one is going in the permanent collection.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I was loyal to my banana bread recipe for years but wanted to try something new when I ran out of shortening and had old bananas on hand.  So glad I stumbled upon this recipe!  I've made it with both buttermilk and sour cream instead - both fantastic!  I always add a little vanilla.  Wrap it up in plastic wrap after it's cool and you will have the moistest banana bread ever.  I can't wait for the loaf to come out of the oven!  Thanks!

This was an AMAZING banana bread.
Super moist and delicious. I'm sure that it'll be gone by tomorrow afternoon. =]
I followed the recipe exactly (aside from buttermilk. For that I mixed 1 tsp of vinegar with milk) and it came out PERFECT.
Thank you SO much! It's a keeper!

I made this and used Altern instead of sugar. (My kids are ADHD.) Instead of putting it into a loaf, I put it into muffins. The kids went crazy over it!!  Great recipe! I will be making it again!!!

WOW - sooooo good!!  I typically don't even care for banana bread & I thought it was terrific!  I doubled the recipe.  I used a third brown sugar & two-thirds granulated sugar (on a whim).  I also left the pecans out.  Lastly, I used dark/non-stick pans so I had to drop the temp down to 300 after about 30 minutes to prevent the sides from getting too dark.  I would HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!

I used only 170g out of the 300g mentioned to be used and it already turned out too sweet. I did add almost a tsp of vanilla and very very ripe bananas so maybe that contributed to the sweetness but I think I'll reduce the amt to about 3/4 cup like the other recipes. 1h 20min is also too long, mine got a little charred at the bottom. I decided to try out this recipe since I was low on butter (this recipe uses veg oil instead). Well, all in all, its banana bread and would probably taste very good with less sugar.

This recipe was great!!  Really moist and flavorful.  As a Diabetic, I tried Egg Beaters instead of eggs, Splenda Brown Sugar Blend for the sugar, and Apple sauce for the oil.  It made a little dense but still good.  Topped with Sugar-Free Ice-Cream and an adjusted Bananas Foster II topping and I was in heaven.  Thanks so much!!!

OMG This was great! I was trying to find the recipe my mother used to use when i was young and this tastes just like it if not better. This is what i'll be using when i make banana bread from now on! The only thing i did differently was that i put 2 teaspoons of baking powder and instead of buttermilk i just used regular whole milk.

SOOO yummy! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it was overly sweet. The first time I made it, I noted many people saying they would have decreased the sugar so I decreased it by 1/4 cup. It was still a little too sugary for me so the 2nd time I made it I decreased it by 1/2 cup and it was PERFECT. It was moist, the perfect texture and just plain delicious!

Five stars is not nearly enough for this banana bread!! It is absolutely delicious.  I too added the brown sugar, pecans and cinnamon to the top and baked it in. Everyone who ate it devoured it. I have never been able to make a banana bread that wasn't still raw in the middle, but this one wasn't and the flavour is to die for. The only thing I would change is to line the pan with parchment paper. I couldn't get the loaf out, but we still ate it.  mmm yummmm

This is the banana bread my mother warned me about.  I can't stop eating it!

The thermometer in my oven read exactly 325 degrees, but after only an hour my nose warned me it was done.  The texture is perfect and the flavor is heavenly.  I used to use a recipe off this site that uses twice as many bananas, but that's absolutely pointless when this recipe comes out tasting so much better.

This is a good recipe, i have a son that has food allergies and while he can drink milk cooked through, he has low tolerance to margarine/butter - so this was a good substitute. I add in 3 bananas, use 1 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. packed brown sugar with 1 tsp of vanilla. Instead of nuts (nut allergies) we substitute with Trader Joe's bittersweet chocolate chips since they have no milk or nut traces. We make a mix of mini loaves and mini muffins...delicious!

Wonderful banana flavour and so moist!  I didn't change a thing, made it exactly according to the recipe (even the baking time was right on) and it turned out great.  I'll be making this again the next time I have over-ripe bananas.

I used whole wheat flour & it's so dense & good! Also didn't have buttermilk, regular milk works fine. 1 cup of sugar is plenty. Added 1 Tbl. brown sugar & 1/2 cup of applesauce which helps make it very moist. Use the ripest bananas you can, it really adds the flavor! This bread freezes wonderful for several months.

I'm only giving this for several reasons. First of all I am sorry but I have had way better banana bread. Mine came out a bit dry....I have had banana bread come out a lot moister. And its sweet. I mean it has good taste overall, but I just cannot see myself making this one again when I know there are better recipes out there.

Very tasty! I used one cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white. Substituted whole milk with a splash of vinegar for the buttermilk because I was out. I will definately make it again, perhaps with walnuts. Thanks!

This banana bread is excellent; true to the title. The loaf is moist, dense, and rich, with excellent banana flavor. I made only one change - I used half brown sugar, half granulated sugar. 
The top of this loaf gets very dark, so be cautious, but don't take it out too early (do the toothpick test) or else the middle will be underdone.
To save this delicious loaf indefinitely, let it cool completely and slice into 1/2 inch slices. Freeze in a large airtight container with slices just apart or separated by wax paper, then you can remove one or a few slices at a time to thaw and eat. The bread also lasts for a long time whole in the fridge, but can pick up some funky fridge flavors if not tightly wrapped.

I followed the recipe exactly as is and my bread turned out excellent. I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips because my family loves it. My husband said "it really is the "best banana bread" ever!" My kids (5 and under) loved it! Couldn't get enough. They can't wait for me to make it again.

Frankly, I've had better.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the addition of 1 tsp vanilla and the reduction of the amount of sugar as recommended by other reviewers.  It was very moist, but otherwise not particularly impressive.  In fact, I found that the unbaked batter was much better than the baked bread.  I'll try this one again in order to give all the other reveiwers the benefit of the doubt and hope for the stellar results they've all raved about.

wow. This recipe is absolutely amazing!!! I don't normally expect all the "Best" recipes to be that great, but this one truly lives up to its name.  I used flaxmeal in place of some of the regular flour, as I always do.  I also added a splash of vanilla to the egg mixture, and WOW!!!!! I made it into muffins and they came out dark and moist and delicious.  I will never use another banana bread recipe again!  Thanks!

The best banana bread!  I made this intentionally because I cleaned out the freezer and had about six frozen dark banana.  I let them thaw- multiplied everything in the recipe by four and wow!
Maybe having them frozen may have helped.  I added about 1tsp vanilla as others suggested, reduced the oil by about 1/2 cup given that I had already used a good bit once I multiplied by four, and I added about 1.5 tsp of cinnamon.

I topped each loaf with chopped pecans and it gave a great presentation.  I shared two with neighbors and the rest went to church social hour.

I made these on Saturday morning and they were all gone by Sunday afternoon!  My mother's cousin said the bread was to die for!  And that cousin is no slouch in the kitchen!

Thanks for making me a wonderful cook!  It's our little secret!

A very nice recipe. I would suggest that if you don't have buttermilk in your fridge, you can substitute using a half cup of milk mixed with a half teaspoon of lemon. I find it is best if you let this mixture sit for a bit before using.

I'm always trying new recipes, so needless to say I've tried numerous BB recipes also.  My husband said this was the best BB I've ever made.  The 1st time I made this, I didn't have buttermilk so I used sour cream.  It turned out great.  The 2nd time I made as the recipe calls but added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  I sprinked a mixture of cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  I made in 2 med size bread pans and baked it at 350 degrees for 58 mins.  It was also great.  You can't lose. It's very moist and tasty.  Freezes well also.

Excellent banana bread, and I have tried a number over the years! This one managed to be great even through me trying to overbake it and using half soft margarine instead of all oil (neither of which I would recommended). I did add 1 tsp. of vanilla as well as generous helpings of cinnamon, nutmeg, mace and clove (I like spicy banana bread). I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and filled in the rest with Splenda to reduce the sugar.

I really liked the basic recipe .
 I added pistashios instead of pecans and added 1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter.
Great texture.

I was a little disapointed. I followed the recipe to the "T", but it was somewhat dry. It tasted more like peanut butter than bananas, but I really like peanut butter so it didn't matter. 200+ people can't be wrong, so I'm going to try it again.

This bread is VERY delicious. The first time I made it, it did not turn out and I thought "what are all these people (reviewers) talking about?!" So I decided that 200 people cannot be wrong and it must be something that I did wrong, not the fault of the recipe. And am I glad I tried it again! This is my new favorite banana bread recipe...just amazing! TRY THIS RECIPE - you will not be disappointed.

This is the BEST banana bread recipe EVER! I have tried so many and this one came out perfectly. I was out of vegetable oil, so I used melted butter flavored Crisco shortening, cut the sugar back and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, added 1 tsp. of red wine vinegar to the milk and let is stand for 10 mins. as I didn't have any buttermilk, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon. Baked in three mini loaf pans, greased & sugared, at 325 for 45 minutes. My husband took a loaf to work and I gave one to my neighbor and I've already had several requests for the recipe. This one's a keeper!!!

This recipe was absolutely heart-warming.  Everyone who ate it loved it a lot, especially myself.  I substituted the pecans for 4 tablespoons of baking chocolate, and it was absolutely delicious.  The melting chocolate mixed with the warm banana notes was extraordinary.  I can't wait to make this again.

Really good, really flavorful banana bread.  Easily used up the 3 nasty bananas I had left on my counter.  Watch your baking time though..I set it for the exact time, and it turned out a little too dark.  Thank you!

Absolutely fabulous! I wasn't overly impressed the first time I tasted it. When it was warm from the oven....but when I tasted it the next morning it was super moist and to die for. Everytime I opened the box the best aroma of banana bread came out. I also added the simple topping as suggested in the first post. Fabulous.

This really is stellar banana bread. And nothing fancy either, just a quick list of everyday items that make something seriously delicious. I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and vinegar. I let it sit for 10 minutes and it worked perfectly. I also used half the sugar and added nutmeg, allspice, ginger, oats, and poppyseeds. I will make this bread again and again!

Amazing! I was a bit hesitant at first, but the result was sublime. So moist, so yummy. I tried an experiment with using both an oven and a rice cooker. The rice cooker one too much longer, but it was so very moist. The over one was done in an hour, but it was a bit drier. And when I say a bit, I mean, it was still extremely moist.

This was good and easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly. I wish it had a little bit more spice in it though.  It isn't the prettiest either - but it raised a bit - not a sunken hole in the middle like other reviewers.  I would make this again if I had left over buttermilk. My husband loved it.  I used three really ripe bananas - I think four would have been better.

Wonderful flavor, moist and delicious.  Lovely just warm from the oven when the top is still crunchy!  Huge hit with the family.  Made my own buttermilk with milk and vinegar since I don't keep buttermilk on hand.

This banana bread hit the spot. It was the first time I ever made banana bread and me and DH just loved it. I added a dollop of sour cream and homemade applebutter to the mix.

Loved it.  My husband and mom loved it.  I used Splenda instead of regular sugar (you use half the amount of Splenda), and it was really good.

I've tried MANY banana bread recipes, and this is my absolute favorite!
The only thing I changed was subbing 3/4c wheat flour.

SO moist and wonderful!

I had to make banana bread for 60 and let me just say this recipe was a smash hit!  I added vanilla flavoring, cinnamon and nutmeg and it was just fabulous! People were wrapping it up and taking it home. I have requests for more!  I am on my way back upstairs to make another batch for my house.

Made it exactly as the recipe said.  It is delicious.  Dare I say the best ever.

Edit:
I have started cutting the sugar to 1 cup and adding more bananas (3 total ). It makes it slightly healthier, a little less sweet, and more bananay. The recipe is amazing as is, but it's delicious with the changes as well.

Ive made some good banana bread before as its my husbands favorite and I was a bit skeptical about not using ANY spices (vanilla, cinnamon) even though so many others had added, but I thought I'd give the recipe a chance as is....my husband declared it "the best banana bread ever, dont change a thing!" I love the "crunchier" sort of crust and the inside is just amazing. Honestly, its what he had for breakfast and lunch today. Then he went out and bought a new bunch of bananas and asked that I make it again. 
Thanks for this keeper!

This recipe is excellent. I made a couple of changes though..subsituted 1/2 cup of white sugar with brown sugar, used 1 1/2cups of bananas and increased the flour by 2 tablespoons. Before baking I sprinkled the bread with a mixture of chopped pecans/brown sugar/cinnamon.
Yummy!

This is a great recipe I've made quite a few times, the first time I made it I went to get the flour and realized I only had wheat flour, I then decided to use the white flour mix out of my krusteez bread machine mix.  It was amazing, the second time I used flour, it was stil good, but honestly it's way better using the Krusteez mix in place of the flour.  It does need a little longer to cook though, just keep checking it.  You won't be disappointed!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This really IS the best!I used half wholemeal and half white flour and had no buttermilk so used plain yoghurt and it still came out beautifully,very moist and banana-ey.My only worry was the amount of sugar so i may try to reduce this or substitute some for honey next time,many thanks for a fab recipe!!

I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used half sour cream and half milk instead. I added extra banana and some cinnamon. Came out great!! I didn't even measure the ingredients, just eyeballed it. Wonderful recipe, thank you!

Wow!  Great banana bread and soooo easy.  I rarely bake as I live at high-altitude and am always worried things won't come out quite right, but this turned out great.  I added about 1/4 cup extra flour to account for living 'a mile high', substituted walnuts for pecans and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I also baked it in a pyrex bread dish. It is so moist and flavorful.  Thanks very much for the submission- I am sure my guests this weekend will want to thank you too!

Wonderful!  I used 1% fat buttermilk, reduced the sugar a tad and used two fairly ripe bananas.  It came out nice and moist but crispy on the edges.  I'm definitely saving this one in my recipe box!

I have been searching for the perfect banana bread recipe and have tried many lately, but this one is the best so far.  I made it for my husband to take to work, but I couldn't give it up!  I always warm up my bread and put butter on it to make it better, but this is perfect.

This was my first time making banana nut bread and it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so moist and tasty.  Everyone that had some said it was not too sweet or too bland, perfect!  Beware, this is not diet food!

Excellent recipe. I followed it exactly and am pleased with results.  Loved the pecans instead of the usual walnuts.

This is a great recipe!  I ran out of sugar and was only able to use 1 cup.  Also, I decreased the fat and used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce.  I also added raisins to the recipe.  Turned out so moist and very sweet.

Thanks for a delicious new banana bread recipe Rose!  The recipe makes wonderful muffins, I also had 1 1/2 cups mashed bananas so I used it all and omitted the oil completely, split the sugar with half white half brown and added 1/8 tsp nutmeg, our new favorite, light and yummy!

excellent, but with some changes. i added butter instead of veg oil. i also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 2 pinches of allspice. i added pecans, and 1/4 C grated semisweet chocolate and 1/4 C bittersweet chocolate. chopped finely, the chocolate flavor is interlaced with the banana bread and quite amazing.

This banana bread is sooo good! My husband and son eat it like crazy. I use low-fat plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and it turns out great. I also love that it makes just one loaf. Most banana bread recipes make two. YUM!

This recipe was wonderful!!  It was so easy to make and very moist.  Will make again and again.  
I did have to bake it 20 minutes longer but I used 3 small bananas and didn't measure, so I probably used a little more banana than the recipe called for.
