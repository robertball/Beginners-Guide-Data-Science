This soup is so good, I can barely stand it.  I'm a gazpacho-junkie so this dish couldn't have been tastier.  I must admit, I cheated a bit.  I used commercially canned tomato juice...but that bumped up the quickness rating.

Divine!  I always use tomato juice in lieu of juicing the tomatoes (I don't have a juice extractor) in this recipe.  And for tonight's dinner party I added little salad shrimp.  It's delicious, refreshing and GONE way too soon.

I prefer to squish tomatoes instead of using the juice.  It tastes fresher and there's something satisfying about squishing tomatoes in a colander.  I use about 8 largeish tomatoes to make 3 or for modest servings.

We were pleasantly surprised how good this recipe was. I was very skeptical about how this mixture of ingredients would turn out. We have never tried a cold soup before because it never sounded all that appealing. After I mixed everything together and took a look at the soup, I thought to myself, "yuck" and quickly made a plan B for dinner (pizza delivered). I took a taste and was shocked at how good it was! We ate it all. Great flavor and consistency. I did what HIPPYJEN75 did and made “Grilled Poblano Pepper and Mango Quesadillas” using the mango filling from the “Fish Tacos with Tropical Fruit Salsa” recipe we recently made. Everything turned out delicious. The only difficulty with this recipe is finding GOOD tomatoes. I went to 3 different stores looking for tomatoes and was not happy with any, so I broke down and used canned tomato juice. I did buy two vine ripened tomatoes to dice up for the soup, but even they had no tomato flavor. Does anyone know where to buy/get GOOD tomatoes that TASTE like tomatoes? We will make this soup again.

My family had low expectations for this recipe.  I'd never made a cold soup for dinner before and both daughter and husband were skeptical.  Well, after they tasted this delicious soup, they were pleasantly surprised.  My husband even went back for seconds!  I served this with the Grilled Poblano Pepper and Mango Quesadillas from this site.  My husband said that this must be added to the rotation.  Thanks so much for the delicious recipe.  Oh, and taking the time to juice the tomatoes is worth it, as well as having the freshest ingredients that you can find.  The only change I made was to use dried cilantro (the store was out of fresh) and also used fresh basil because I had some and wanted fresh herb included.   Again, thanks so much!!!

It takes a bit of time to juice the tomatoes, but it's well worth the trouble.  Get the ripest tomatoes you can find and the flavor will be amazing!

Wow!  This is perfect for spring and summer when fresh tomatoes and corn are at their peak.  I boiled 4 ears of corn for about 10 minutes, let them cool, and cut them off of the cob.  I also used parsley instead of cilantro.  This is absolutely amazing!

Wow!!! This is the perfect fresh-tasting summer soup - better than any gazpacho I have ever had. I suggest going to a farmers market or local fruit stand to get the most flavorful tomatoes possible. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I like this - a very nice summer soup.  My only changes were to add a couple of large sea scallops to the soup.  I marinated thin slices of the scallops in a bath of fresh lime juice and onions for a couple of hours.  I then added the drained scallops to the soup. Yummy!

I would only recommend this if you have really awesome produce to use.  Mine was lackluster, and it really showed in the end result.

I was really concerned when I first made this... it really did not look appetizing. But as I let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple hours, the flavors got richer. It really has a refreshing flavor. My recommendations are to go liberal on the lemon juice and cilantro (especially if you like cilantro), and let it sit in the fridge for a while. Very nice!

I was a bit disappointed by how bland this turned out. Like someone else said, it tastes like just a bunch of ingredients thrown together. I used prepared tomato juice since I don't have a juice extractor and I didn't have corn on hand, so I threw in a bit of chopped bell pepper. After reading a few more reviews, I threw in a dash or two of celery salt, and some hot sauce. I guess cold soup is an acquired taste, because I couldn't even finish a bowl of it. :(

Fabulous, refreshing, and yet a satisfying finish to a hot summer day... freshness and quality of ingredients is imperative. Like others, I used prepared tomato juice to start, tomatoes from the garden, fresh (uncooked) corn off the cob, and threw in some fresh basil too.  I served it along with some sauteed baby scallops, which my husband put in with his soup and enjoyed that way. And, as someone suggested.... the loaf of three-cheese bread and fresh, fruity olive oil was super!! I might suggest preparing, chilling, and serving the soup in the same day to keep the flavors their  freshest.

I wouldn't rate this recipe 'The best' coz I am sure there are better recipes out there. But this soup is a pretty darned good one. Very refreshing as lunch/dinner on a hot summer day.

I juiced 4 fresh tomatoes and added a good meaure of baby carrots to the juicer as well. So the soup base was a combination of carrot and tomato juice. 
To this juice I added 4 bruised/smashed, garlic cloves to add some flavor. I then rubbed the cloves into the juice with my hands, making sure the cloves did not disintegrate. I then fished out the pieces of garlic.
I cheated and used canned corn. But all the other ingredients were fresh. I love lemon juice in my soups, so I was generous with it and the pepper. I finished it off by adding a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil straight into the soup and gave it a stir.
Served this soup with slices of crusty three cheese bread from Panera and a side of Low fat cucumber & dill salad.
My family thoroughly enjoyed this soup. I will definitely make it again when I need something light, refreshing and healthy.

I eat about a 90% raw diet, so I have a lot of recipes for raw soups. Although I'm happy to see a raw soup (other than gazpacho) on this site, I'm afraid it's only average compared with my other recipes. Something about the cilantro was just a little off--and cilantro is my favorite herb. I think this might be better with basil or maybe even tarragon. It's a gorgeous presentation, though.

Very good! I would suggest adding some black beans. Can substitute parsley or dill for the cilantro is you like. Can use tomato juice or vegetable juice in place of juicing fresh tomatoes.

Not bad.  I used premade juice and then after making it as written I decided I wanted a little more going on, added another 1/2 cup of corn, a diced cucumber and a couple tablespoons of diced onion.  Also added a little fresh basil.  Pretty tasty on a hot summer say.

This was more like a salsa to me. I would definitely throw in some canned tomato juice as my 10 tomatoes only produced about 1/2 cups of juice. I will probably not be making this again, unless I am making a salsa.

This recipe was really good, but seemed a tad bland. I added cucumbers, diced orange bell peppers, chopped basil, and a dash or 2 of Tobasco and some celery salt. With the lime juice, I added an equal amount of orange juice. Also, as I don't have a juicer, my wrists and hand started to ache from mashing the tomatoes by hand and since it didn't yield as much juice as I had expected, I ran to the store quickly and bought 2 bottles of organic tomato juice to add to my fresh juice. This was even filling enough for my 6'4, 220lb human "eating machine" that I live with.
Next time I want to add a shot of fresh wheat grass for some serious vitamin boosting!

So simple and so good. The avocado and parsley is really what lifts this recipe, so make sure you're using ripe avocadoes and fresh parsley. I usually opt for tomato juice because it's simpler (and it's so hard to find good tomatoes, in my opinion), and it tastes great.

Great for hot summer! I used canned juice and it was good. I can imagine how tasty it is if made from fresh tomatoes.
