Delicious and so easy to put together!  I know the submitter intended this to be more of a grilling sauce however I decided to put everything into a ziploc bag to marinate all day.  The result was moist, sweet and tangy grilled chicken.  The best part is this require no oil so it's low in fat as well.

Both my husband and I like this.  The flavor was unusual but fresh and not overpowering.  Instead of grilling it, I wrapped it in foil and baked it at 375 for half an hour.  It was moist and produced a nice juice that we poured over some rice.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Will definitely make it again.

We really enjoyed this simple but tasty recipe that I made exactly as written (although the amount of garlic was intimidating!).  Half of the family thought the garlic was a little too strong, the other half thought it had just a tad too much of mustard.  But everyone would love to have it again, just as it is written.

Used about 4 T of fresh tarragon from the garden, and it turned out awesome.  Did leave marinating at room temp about 30 min.  This is my new go-to last minute grilled chicken recipe.

My review is based on flavor, not on cooking method--for which I'd give a lower star.  I made half a batch and followed the directions exactly.  I KNEW that when I put those on the oiled grill that the yummy mixture would just fall off and burn (yet I still did that--go figure).  I think that the next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I'll try putting the chicken sealed in foil on the BBQ, opening it for the last few minutes or so.  Or I will just put all the mixture on the top after turning it and forget the bottom of the chicken.  We loved the flavor of the mustard sauce!  I could even try using a skillet on my stove next time.  Thank you!  We loved the flavor of our dinner tonight!

This certainly is easy to prepare, but had a little too much dijon mustard for our tastes.

I loved this! I like the flavor of dijon and tarragon anyway. I didn't really taste the dijon at all, maybe a little more next time. My only complaint is the sauce is a little runny and the chicken was a little dry by the time it was done. Maybe thicken the sauce a little for the grill for the next time or pan fry with the sauce might work better. I'll tweak the next time, full of flavor though! Thanks for the recipe.

Since it was 10 deg.F outside I elected to instead make it in a pan, covering it while it cooked.  The liquid that was created (thickened slightly w/ corn starch) made a nice gravy.   It was really good this way too.   I cooked the coated side down first so when flipped over halfway through cooking the other side got flavored as well.   I served with Potatoes Au-Gratin.  I look forward to warmer weather to try the BBQ version.

I used chicken tenders and marinated them over night.  I used fresh tarragon and the chicken was very moist and full of flavor, however, I wasn't a big fan of the flavor.  I did not enjoy mustard and tarragon together, even though I love both!  My husband did love these, so I'm guessing it's more personal preference than flaw in the recipe.  I don't think I would make them again, but I do think this recipe is worth a try!

This has a subtle mustard flavor that is barely detectable.  Perhaps marinading for an hour or two would help. The first time I made this, my husband thought it was really good.  The second time I made it he said, "please, don't ever make this again."  I thought it tasted the same both times.

Made this as written but doubled the recipe for more breasts. I left it on the counter in a ziplock for 30 mins. Also left a little to brush on on the grill. My kid hates chicken and loved this. My husband also loved this. It’s on a semi regular rotation in our house :)

This is one of my all time favorites and will be making it in a regular basis! Easy and made with ingredients I have on hand.  I sautéed the chicken as barbecuing in the dark and rain didn't seem like fun!  I made it exactly as directed, otherwise. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy to make. The flavor was outstanding. They were a bit dryed out  so watch the time I only did 6 minutes on each side. Maybe marinating before hand would be good or tenderizing.

I used 1 tbs honey instead of 1 teaspoon.  I used 20 oz boneless chicken breast tenderloins and fried them in 1.5 tbs olive oil, the tarragon, and half the garlic on the stove.  I then used the other tbs of garlic and the rest of the ingredients to make a sauce for the cooked chicken.  It turned out well, the perfect amount of sauce for 20 oz chicken.

I was excited to find this easy to put together recipe as a way to use the tarragon from my herb garden. My family really enjoyed it. I used a leg quarter rather than a thigh and indirect heat on the grill. It came out wonderfully. Will use this again when I need a nice change from traditional bbq sauce.

This is a good recipe.  I added a little olive oil because I was afraid that it would stick to the grill without it.  I also marinated it for about 8 hours before grilling it. Very moist and flavorful.

I added some seasonings (seasoned salt, minced onion, paprika) and let the chicken marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours. This was so good! Tender & juicy. Will definitely make again.

Read all the reviews but decided to give this a try, modifying it to bake in the oven, wrapped in foil. None of the 4 liked it so i will not be making this again. Not awful, just not very good.

Mine turned out not so good, but I'd give it another try. I think it does need more time to marinade to get the flavors to sink in.  I used bone in chicken breasts & it really was dry chicken with a tiny bit of flavor.  Next time smaller pieces of chicken & more time in the soak.

Enjoyed every bite. I did sauté it in butter as one reviewer suggested. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Next time will grill it but make sure to foil it as another reviewer suggested so as to not lose the terrific sauce. Thanx for a great recipe. Will add it to my rotation.

I marinated in a ziplock bag (for several hours in the fridge) like someone else mentioned.  The only extra thing I added was salt and freshly ground black pepper. Instead of grilling, I sautéed it on the stove in a buttered skillet. It was wonderful - even my kids were asking for seconds!!

Had high hopes for this one, but flavor turned out to be just ok - nothing special.  I did bake it instead of grilling.  Maybe grilling would improve the flavor.  Will not be making again

I cut 1cm into the breasts, so the sauce could sink in. It was very tasty and flavourfull this  way.
If using large breasts, up the quantity of the sauce ingredients.
Made it  twice now, both family and friends enjoyed the taste.
"Different and delicious"

Moist chicken with unique flavor--- a touch of tang, herb flavor and sweetness. Easy to make. This will be one of our go-to chicken recipes.

Very good,I did make double the sauce to use in the side for extra dipping. It does have a lot of garlic but we like it that way. I will make it again.

OKAY!!!   I haven't made this yet, but I DO plan to because I love the ingredients -- tarragon, dijon mustard, honey, lemon juice.  However, the recipe just seems so incomplete, and from some of the ratings by others, it's easy to see why.  If you want juicy, moist chicken, take the time to brine it.  I won't cook chicken any other way.  Secondly, even after brining, and before "slathering" with the mustard sauce, liberally salt and pepper the meat, as well as add garlic powder (or minced garlic to the sauce).   With these corrections it will definitely make it a 5 star rating.   I can hardly wait to give it a go.

Very good but would use lime juice instead of lemon juice. I would also use a bit more mustard to thicken the sauce and make it easier to brush on. Also, would dust with a bit of tarragon  at the end to increase the tarragon flavor.

I made this without the garlic (which I can't have),  doubled the sauce, and roasted in the oven. It was delicious, and I'll definitely be making this again.

Deliciously simple. I used boneless chicken thighs, lots of fresh tarragon in the marinade, cut back a bit on the mustard , marinated all in a ziplock while I prepared the rest of the dinner. M-m-m. A definite keeper.

It was a very strong taste of tarragon and hot sauce.  Will try it again with less measurements.  My family really didn't like it.  I'll give it another try.

Recipe concept is great and combination tasted great but I made a x10 batch and coated all the chicken pieces in it before I grilled it. It was awesome!

I tried the sauce before basting and liked the tanginess of sauce, but,  I did not think the chicken had a lot of flavor after it was grilled.  I think the chicken would benefit from marinating it in the sauce for several hours.   There are a lot of great sauces & marinades on AR, so, I don't think I would make this one again.

This was pretty good.  Like others I marinated it for about 5 hours before grilling on a grill pan on top of the stove.  I was afraid that the dijon might overwhelm the sauce so I added a little chicken broth to try to balance it out.  It turned out pretty good.  I sprinkled some cracked black pepper on it while on the grill.  I will make it again.

No Tarragon, so I used a teaspoon of fennel seed as suggested in the substitutions graph. Tasted strongly of licorice (fennel) and mustard - everyone seemed to like it fine. I had to cook the breasts twice as long as recommended in the recipe to get them completely cooked.
