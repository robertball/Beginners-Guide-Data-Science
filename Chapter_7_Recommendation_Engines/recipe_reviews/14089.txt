Oh so good! A true German potato pancake is "grated" as the recipe states, not shredded. Shredding produces something that's more like a hash brown. Make sure to not only drain the liquid, but to actually squeeze out the water in a kitchen towel. Time consuming, yes, but well worth the effort.

I loved this recipe due to it's simplicity and nutritional value.  Cooking spray worked well rather than oil to fry. I added herbs and used my food processor.

My boyfriend and I both enjoyed these. I will definitely make them again. We didn't use the onion since he doesn't like them. But to keep the pancakes from tasting bland, we used some dry minced onion and put a lot of salt and pepper and fajita seasoning along with parsley to add a little color. I had to add an extra couple of tablespoons of flour to thicken it up a little.

I love this recipe!! I just sauté the onions in olive oil before adding  them to the potatoes, then I lay out the potatoes in a baking dish and bake in the oven (325° for about 45 min.) Just GREAT!!!

Very Tasty.  My husband LOVED them.  We ate them for breakfast with applesauce. I used "baking" potatoes and it made A LOT more than 2-3 servings.  I had to add an extra egg and extra flour and will add more salt next time.

I was looking for a recipe for potato pancakes like my mother made years ago.  Several of the reviews said to "grate" the potatoes and not shred them but they didn't mention how to grate them.  Use the smallest side of your box grater.  The potatoes should be like a mush.  Then grate the onions the same way using regular onions not green.  Putting the grated potatoes in a sieve was a new one for me but sounds like good advice if you will also press down on the potatoes after they have dripped off on their own.  My mother fried them in bacon grease so I guess she got more flavor in them that way.  She cooked them in an iron skillet.  I have never made them successfully like she did because I think I'm afraid to get the pan hot enough.  The four pictures of this recipe all showed shredded potatoes.  If I ever make them successfully, I will send you a picture.

This is so similar to a recipe I used to make years ago, I used to love it. Maybe I messed up somehow or maybe I have pretty much just got away from greasy food. To me this was way too greasy. My grandkids didn't like it either.

Mmmm WONDERFUL!  I used about 4 tablespoons of flour though b/c my potatoes were fairly large, and added some seasoned salt and nutmeg.  Also added some chopped green pepper!  YUM!!!

This is a very good recipe, and one you can do a lot with. Here are some tips I hope you can find helpful. For those who are having trouble with the potatos turning black on you, try this. When you peel& grate them immediately put them in water until your ready to use them. Then drain them through either a strainer, or a clean dish towel, or both. regardless of the way you choose to drain them make sure you squeeze or drain out as much of the liquid as possible before you ad them to your batter. If you do it this way it should help with your problem. Another tip for anyone who likes their potato pancakes texture to be a little more like a traditional pancake is to either add a little instant potato mix, or instant pancake mix into the batter. If you'd like you can even add a little of both. Just make sure to add just enough extra liquid so that the end result is just a little thicker than what a normal pancake batter would be. Don't get me wrong, this is a great recipe as written. It's because of it being such a great recipe that your able to tweak it just a little bit with very minor adjustments and still retain the very same flavor that the recipe was meant to have. Give this recipe a try, as it's a very good one, and hopefully these few little tips can also be of some help.

Excellent Potato Pancakes.  When we made them, however they come out oily. We used paper towels but they are still a bit soggy.  Anyone have a suggestion?

My grandmother and mother made their potato pancakes exactly this way for years and years.  This is a true potato pancake batter from the "old country".   Potatoes should be grated and not shredded.  DO NOT leave skins on the potatoes as J-Dubb did, but peel first.

This recipe is awesome.  I used a few more potatoes so I had to add a little more flour, but as long as you make sure you drain all the liquid from the potatoes, you should be good. Make sure you don't flip until you can see that the bottom edges are golden brown.Also, make sure you add exactly the 1/4 oil in the pan and you put a little bit of oil on the spatula so they don't stick and your potato pancakes will be perfect!  Thanks Fishlove!

I used this recipe for my first foray into making latkes myself, and the process and flavor certainly brought me back to cold Hanukah nights at my parent's house during my childhood. A warning: latkes are REALLY messy and time consuming, and if you don't set off the smoke alarm at least 2 times, you aren't doing it right. Of course, that is no fault of this recipe, which was great. It cannot be stressed enough that you have to drain water from the potatoes before frying.

I added half pound of chopped/cooked/drained fresh bacon bits to potatoes before adding the egg.  Also, all I had was some cream cheese instead of sour cream so put some of that on top!  Both of my kids really enjoyed these!

This was perfect! Thank you! I served with applesauce, and next time I make will serve with sour cream and fresh chives. Yum. Cut down on the oil, by the way, you can get by on way less. I use Pam oil spray & they turned out terrific.

I loved them! Definitely squeeze or press the excess moisture from the shredded potatoes or the mix will be too watery and you'll have to compensate with extra flour, which makes doughy.  I also added some shredded cheese and served them with a fried egg on top (at this point, healthy has gone out the window).  They were delicious.

I followed the recipe right up to the oil.  I only used about 4 tablespoons of oil to start and just added a little bit more half way through.  The first pancake I made was a little greasy, but I know if I had left it longer it would have been fine.  My hubby who is German loved them soo much.

Very good recipe! I added a can of crab, and extra egg and Old Bay seasoning. Delicious with apple sauce and sour cream.  I avoided the problem of draining the excess moisture from the mix by placing it is a sieve and putting it over a bowl while doing the batches.  Excellent meal.

Grating the potatoes and onion together makes the difference! Do not skimp on this step. It's worth the effort.

Delish! I added a little more onion and a little fresh parsley.  Thanks so much.  I never thought to add the flour.  They were great!

I made these today and they were a hit with me and my family!  I doubled the recipe, using ten small to medium-sized potatoes, and added a bit of cayenne pepper to give it some spice.  We will definitely be making these again!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. It's very easy and it tastes great. I made a few adjustments: added garlic and I also lowered the heat to medium. I burned a few because the heat was so high.  Also, try not to turn your back on this recipe because they brown quick.

It's like a large hash brown with onion.  Very good, but not as the main part of a meal.  I though it would be more like a traditional pancake but should have known better when it only calls for 2 Tbs of flour.

I didn't grate the  potatoes I shredded them. It needs parsley or a tad more salt. I thought it called for way too much oil in the pan, too. Over all they were good but not fabulous.

Taste is 5 stars .....However, is there a special type of potato because my potatoes turned dark as I was grating them.  They tasted great but by the time I finished frying them they were almost black.

I added a lot more flour but that was probably because I didn´t do a very good job getting all the liquid out of the potatoes. I also added a bit more salt, parsley and garlic powder. Will make again!

We shredded the potatoes by mistake instead of grating them.  Also I skimped on the salt & I like alot of salt on my potatoes so next time I'll use the full amount.

These were the best potato pancakes I've ever had.  They were PERFECT, and the recipe was super easy.  I only had 3 potatoes, and didn't measure the flour - just added enough to thicken the batter a bit.  But they came out wonderful.  We ate them with sour cream or apple sauce.

These are delicious and simple to make.  Be sure to drain well before cooking, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I grew up eating potato pancakes with both sour cream and applesauce; both complement this dish spectacularly.

My first time making potato pancakes - this was a great and simple recipe. Cooked in bacon grease as well - the flavor was outstanding! I will, however, use my Kitchen Aid shredder to shred the potatoes and onion in the future. We had with sour cream and salt and was great also tried the maple syrup on them and they were really good. I really enjoy those recipes that seem to have more of an 'old time' feel to them - I can see someone making these while in the bush at an old mining camp.

The recipe was a great but the only problem I had with this recipe was that it was just plain with no seasoning. So, I, for the first batch, added about 2 tsp. of hot sauce. It give it a little kick. The second batch I added about a 1/2 cup of finely diced jalapeno peppers to the mixture. Wow! Serve with a sour cream to handle the heat.

This was very simple and came out great.  I used food processor which does alter the consistency to a "non-traditional" product but it tasted great.  Purists will definitely prefer grating.  I also added more salt thank recipe called for as 1 tsp won't cut it.

Very similar to my Mom's, which were the best!  Instead of flour, I used bread crumbs which my Mom always used, and I think they come out less soggy and more crispy!  You can even use "Italian" bread crumbs which add a little more flavor.

Needed to make some changes to make the recipe right, but other than that this is a good basic recipe for this dish.  I added spices and blended everything in a food processor.  Otherwise you just end up with hash browns.

WOW!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone LOVED these.    Followed the recipe exact except left out the onion. (just used a tad of onion powder. Also, I left the skin on and they turned a weird, dark color.  Next time I will take off the skin or wash them much better.

We love our hashbrowns.  One weekend I didn't make our big breakfast and had the fresh ready made package of southern style hashbrowns that I needed to use.  I made these and OMG they were wonderful.  How simple and my family loves extra crispy hashbrowns - these did the trick.  I will always make my hashbrowns this way.

I like to add dill and use 2 eggs instead of 1.

Great recipe. I prefer the texture and taste if I first soak potatoe in water to remove the starch, then squeeze it in a towel to get rid of the excess liquid. Also great with some apple shredded directly into the mix.

I used this as a breakfast hashbrown recipe and it turned out great!  Holds together nicely with some cheddar cheese on top.  I also added green onions and some garlic salt.  I think fresh parsley might also be good.  Don't be married to the amounts of ingredients.  Experiment and post!

Absolutely delicious!  I let the potatos get brown and crispy.  I served with sour cream.  We had a couple left over for the next day.  I reheated them in the toaster oven for a while and they were still fabulous!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Amazing comfort food. I made the recipe exactly with gluten free flour and it turned out well. I wish that recipes would post the weight of the food.  I grated four “large” potatoes and I had too much. As a result I doubled the batter and it turned out to be yummy, especially with sour cream.

I have been making these for over 40 years.  The only difference is that I use left-over mashed potatoes.  Saves lots of time and work.

This recipe was exactly the way I remember my mom making potato pancakes. They were perfect . I used my food processor to blend up everything & it gave the perfect texture.  it made 14 pancakes enough for 2 to 3 people.

I followed the recipe and they fried up nice, but they were really bland. It needed more onion, maybe some green onion too.

Terrific potato pancakes.. :)  My husband loves these.  I just need an easier method of grating all those potatoes!  Simple, and delicious!  This was sparked because I found out that homemade applesauce was so easy, and the applesauce requires potato pancakes to go with!

Easy and fast! I add dried chives and make homemade apple sauce for two - 2 apples 2 tbs water cover , microwave 4 minutes mash em up ( stick blender- not too much I like it chunky) add sugar or splenda and spices to taste. Put in freezer to cool down fast - Use 1 apple per person - the best pancakes w/ homemade apple sauce!!

My mom wanted to cook me something quick and Gluten-Free (long story).  I found this recipe and instead of flour, I used Gluten-Free pancake mix and left out the salt and pepper.  It was so yummy with Boysenberry Preserves and a scrambled egg on the side.  I, actually, cooked them on a frying pan like a pancake. DEEE-Licious.

This is good, my kids even ate them and they are picky eaters!  I used leeks from our garden instead of the onion, pretty tasty and added a little green.  I think next time I will squeeze the liquid out of the potato and maybe add some zucchini to them.

My daughter has been asking for potato pancakes for a while now, so we have tried a few different recipes.  She liked this one by far the best.  She doesn't like onions, so I did leave out the "real" onion and used a dried minced onion for flavor.  I had a little trouble with them falling apart when I flipped them, but since I'm a novice potato pancake maker maybe it was my technique.

These were okay. I followed the recipe exactly, but made then gluten-free by using corn starch instead of flour. I really prefer shredding the potatoes and just adding an egg - more like hash browns, but that's how I like them.

This was a great recipe! I made it just as stated, and they were crispy, flavorful, and tasty with plain yogurt and apple sauce on top. Do be prepared for the cooking time though, as it was longer than i had anticipated. so good!

Wow.  I am not sure what these are supposed to taste like....but these were great !!  The kids loved them !!

I was surprised by how much water/moisture collected at the bottom of the bowl while I was making batches - bu tit was easy to drain.  

These babies soak up alot of cooking oil...will have to try making them in nonstick with less oil next time.

I added a pinch of Adobe powder (seasoning mostly garlixc and onion powder mixture).

This is the first potato recipe that my kids (who are rice addicts) have gobbled down and asked for more. I used 1 Tbsp.cornstarch for 1 Tbsp. of the flour- not sure if that made any difference.  They were wonderfully crispy, and tasted delicious!  Now I know what to make for the kids when I just can't stand the thought of another bowl of rice!

This is a very nice recipe.  I followed the directions and drained the mixture well.  The pancakes were a little salty for MY taste but no one else complained!  I'll certainly make them again but reduce the salt slightly.

Simple and tasty.  My son loved them & can't wait to have them again.  My Polish family had them alot, but they're not exactly like those that were great.  But they're about as close as I've made and very tasty.

Unfortunately my slicer created small fries instead of the 
required grated potatos. This resulted in the problem of potato/onion not sticking together very well, (used 5 Tbsp of flour). Used Canola oil and regardless - they tasted great! Used sour cream on them. Will do them again - with more onion.

I make these all the time and have been for years. I now use non-fat cooking spray instead of oil. Also i use a mixture of low-fat sour cream and cottage cheese with lots of pepper for topping. Green onions are also really good sprinkled on top. These are the best.

Good and easy. I have to skip the onions and so they ended up a bit bland. I made them much thinner, too, as I like them very crispy. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious.  Very easy to make and they came out great.  Definitely helped me to have a very Happy Chanukah.  Will definitely make those again.  I only had to add a little extra flour so that the mixture would bind properly.  Highlt recommend it.

Doubled the recipe, used Bisquick instead of flour (all I had at the time). Needed a little extra flour (bisquick), but I think that's my fault for not being able to get as much water out as I would have liked. I'll have to get some cheesecloth for next time, I guess. Excellent, simple recipe and everybody loved them. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was a good base. To make it even better add:

Garlic
Sharp cheddar
Green onions
Bacon (optional)

That made this recipe way better!

Turned out so well as long as you follow the basic instructions. I grated on the fine side of the grater instead of shredding, added some fresh parsley and some minced garlic to enhance the flavor as well. I did make sure to use a fine strainer to get all the water out before frying as well. Medium heat worked well and let me monitor for the perfect crisp! Would definitely make this again

My dad was always in charge of Sunday breakfasts. He’d free pour pancake batter into Mickey Mouse, something I can’t master.

He’d make potato pancakes, but for the life of me, I can’t remember seeing him add the egg/flour. 

This recipe brought it all back to me. Thanks

This is a really good bass recipe for a beginner. The way we do it in the old country, Poland/Germany, we put in a colander and press it out  separate from the onion. If you’re using four potatoes I would use one and a half to two onions and do not drain the onions.  You want to add flour 2 tablespoons at a time until it becomes almost pasty and sticky. This generally takes me 8 tablespoons of flour for this particular recipe. I also add a tablespoon of garlic powder and a few chopped green onions.  The green onions really give it a prettier look . Try the recipe the way it’s written, and then maybe try my version. Has been passed down from years and years for my family before they migrated here to America. Enjoy! And more importantly have fun!

Great base recipe but I did a test pancake and found it to taste more like a hash brown patty.    I would definitely make the recipe "as is" as a side for omelets or with dinner!   I was looking more for the kind of cakes you eat as a meal, so I added another egg, about 1/2 cup of milk and another 4 TBSP of flour to make it more like the pancake batter I am used to.  Turned out great.  Again, the original version was excellent.

I found it somewhat confusing reading that the potatoes were to be 'finally grated', and then watched the video to see them shredded on the large hole shredder. My mom (Czech/German origin) used to shred them on the larger hole grater, and would add marjoram and some finally minced garlic before frying. Occasionally she'd add fried crumbled bacon on top along with sour cream or fried onions. I made it 'finally grated' as described in the recipe and didn't enjoy the texture much. I far prefer the texture shown in the video.

I agree entirely with the fact that you must remove as much liquid from the potatoes .I did this by grating the potato into a freezer bag and cutting a tiny piece of the corner (Just enough for the liquid to pass through) Squeeze until fairly dry. Don't do this to the onion as you lose the flavour.
Very good recipe.

I had no idea that there was a difference between grating and shredding. I think I may have shredded, which gave me what was like a hash brown,( so not a bad thing). I will probably make this both ways.

Just as I remember them from years ago - perfect.  Mum used to add pre-cooked bacon pieces - Yum.  Yes a  bit greasy for our taste these days but nonetheless a  special treat.

I wanted to replicate what my Mom used to make when I was a kid. I just realized that it's been so long since I've had potato pancakes that I don't know if I did replicate what my Mom used to make or not. LOL. However, this recipe was a success and my potato pancakes tasted great.

Good recipe but a few adjustments that took this recipe from a 4 to a 5.

1. Grate fine. I used the second smallest grate on my grater.

2. I drained the excess liquid after grating but. Also used paper towels to get off even more moisture

3. Add a clove of garlic pressed or 1 tsp garlic powder

4. Don’t skip the salt. I don’t use a lot of salt in my day to day cooking but this recipe I added about 1/2 extra tsp 

5. Add about 1/2 an additional onion. And about 8tsp flour total. 

6. I shaped the pancake batter in my hand before putting into oil and used spatula to spread. My favorite is when the pancakes are crispy.

7. After they are done in the pan I transferred to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to soak up excess grease. 

**** leftovers warm up in a frying pan to get some crunch back when reheating

After I drained the potatoes I rolled them in a towel and twisted to remove any leftover liquid.

I added fresh chopped parsley to the pancakes.

I served with cottage cheese to which I had added ground black pepper, some finely chopped sweet onion and fresh chopped chives.

These were exactly what I remember from my childhood.  I prefer these because they are basically potatoes and not as much flour filling as many other recipes.

i've made these for years - in the blender,  but more recently tried a food processor, which gave a bit more texture. for a dinner party, my mother would make them ahead, and then re-heat on a cookie sheet. in the "old days", we had them on fridays with apple sauce for dinner.

A home run of a recipe.

Quick hint to dry your potatoes (and grated or shredded, they are both good):  a salad spinner!  I shredded/grated my potatoes directly into the "bowl" of my salad spinner. When I was done, I just cranked it for about three minutes. Not bone-dry, but drier than I could have wrung them.

We made these for potato latkes for Hanukkah and upped the recipe. 5 lbs of potatoes, 3 onions, and left out the flour. Turned out really well.

My notes may not appear. So from a box of dehydrated potatoes i added 1 3/4 cup of boiling water to the box to produce about 3 cups of hashbrowns. After letting them rehydrate for 15 minutes I added two beaten eggs, salt and pepper, and about 1/2 Cup of flour to make them thick.. In an 8 inch sauté pan I added a tablespoon of olive oil and a half cup of Crisco to get the quarter inch depth, then heated it to 375F before adding the mix in 1/4 cup portions. These were pressed to about 3/8” thick in order to get them to cook all the way through and fried for a minute on each side. With maple syrup there were decadently delicious!

This was easy and delicious! I used my food processor to shred the potatoes and onion and I added some dried parsley. You will need at least 4 tbsp of flour to tighten it up and I found two spatulas made flipping them much easier.

It wasn't something I would make again.  My husband liked it but my 3 kids did not and for me it was ok but wasn't what I would call a potato pancake.  This reminded me of hash browns with onion.

I made a 2 potato version because I was cooking for 1 this time and didn't want a lot left over.
I used the grater attachment on my food processor. If I didn't have the processor I wouldn't have made latkes at all. I used the medium shredding disk on the potatoes first and added the onion without emptying the bowl. I also used the small opening in the cover - it seems to deliver finer shredding. Then I topped it into another bowl, beat 2 eggs in a cup and added them to the potato, added salt and pepper and mixed, dropped into the hot oil, turned the heat up halfway through. I decided to add panko them, so it was just on one side, but I had forgotten flour. Either, or, or neither. I'm going to try bacon fat next time - and there will be a next time. I like the idea of adding parsley, chives, something else. The possibilities seem to keep expanding. Applesauce next time too.

I have not made these yet but I will.  Mom used to make potato pancakes quite orten during Lent.  Wel loved them, topping with sugar, brown sugar, a fried egg or whatever you like.  I'll try to make them like Mom did but its been a loooong time!
Thanks for the recipe and I'll write more later.

I'm almost embarrassed to admit I never made potato pancakes  before I made these.  I mean, I know my way around the kitchen and can out-cook almost everyone I know.  I just never got around to making them.  I'm glad I did.  This recipe is almost impossible to mess up, unless the top comes off the salt shaker, or something.  I grated too many potatoes so I had to add another egg and more flour, but they came out perfect.  I chose olive oil/butter and fried them for a few minutes on each side.  I assume it was a few minutes.  I just went by the color.  I didn't bother to keep them warm in the oven because it was a warm day and these things are just as good cold as hot.  I ended up eating the last two with my fingers.  A touch of apple butter, for dipping, really brings out the flavor.

Finally found a good, old fashioned recipe for potato pancakes that turns out perfectly.  I used a cast iron skillet, and got the oil hot, and didn't change a thing about the recipe.  They do need to be drained and kept warm in the oven, just like it says, because they are too greasy right out of the pan.  But they are, after all, potato pancakes! ; )  They are a treat!

Excellent.  I cheated and shredded the pancakes in my food processor, but they were delicious anyway.  Next time I'll try less oil in the pan and plan to cook them longer.  They did retain too much grease, but then they also reheated in a dry frying pan really well.

I loved it but with my own changes as the recipe on it's own looked like it could be bland. I added thyme, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder & served it with sour cream.  I forgot to include the green onions I got to serve with it. I fried them in a lot less oil than called for but used my cast iron pan & they turned out fabulous! I think next time I might try adding cheese and/or bacon to the mix.

Made this at the lake so we could have a different kind of breakfast. My husband came in from working outside and the smell of the potato pancakes frying was so yummy!   It was a nice surprise for him and a yummy breakfast.  Can't wait to make these again!!

Wow this is a great deal of work for little reward.  If you make it as is the pancakes will be bland.  I added onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper,  garlic salt, green onions, and they were still a little on the bland side.  I floated my shredded potato in water and drained, then squeezed water out with a towel.

I added cornstarch instead of flour.  The only way to get them crispy is by using a good amount of oil , in my non stick pan they never browned.  

Too much work for too little reward for me.

This is the best recipe I've found and my boyfriend and I loved ones. The only the I did differently was to finely dice the onion. It proved for a stronger onion flavor which we both wanted.

Excellent in taste, very fast and I will make this again.  I left out the salt cause hubby can't have salt.  But I put it on mine while we ate and it still was super good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy to make and quite tasty. I didn't use the fine part of the grater, instead I used shredder, they  came out pretty good for my first effort. I will use this recipe again.

I used olive oil in a Misto to coat the griddle, patted down with back side of a slotted spoon, set temp. to 375 degrees. Spouse loved them and said it must be a California thing because he put ketchup on it!

These are just like grandma use to make. If you don't want to hand grate your potatoes and onions shred them in the food processor, remove them to a bowl, let rest 5 minutes. Place blade in processor, squeeze out excess water from potatoes and place back in processor. Add flour, egg and seasoning. Gently pulse to form course batter.Heat pan and spray with pan spray.

Really liked this.  Mostly followed the directions.  Made a few changes.  Did not add salt.  Was heavy handed with the the pepper.  Added one quarter of a green pepper and instead of fresh potatoes, used a can (15 oz) of Whole White potatoes, grated.

This is a great everyday recipe.  I have even made it with left-over mashed potatoes.  I use whatever herbs and spices go with whatever the main entree is.  My husband loves these potatoes.

Simple and delicious. I made this for a Meatless meal during Lent. My family are not big potato eaters, and even my finicky 6year old looked them. I made as per the recipe.

The first time I tried the recipe I couldn't wait till it was done. I was having so much difficulty waiting I forgot the flour for the first batch of pancakes:) The pancakes are so good even without flour. Potato pancakes are the perfect holiday meal. Or if you can't wait till the holidays , have them for a weekend breakfast. Start the day with a delicious meal.

This was a yummy easy alternative side dish to go with my baked salmon. I did add some extras like garlic and some extra flour to make it not as runny.

I made these last night to go with pork chops. Although they did turn out well, they lacked in flavor and did not stick together as well as I would have hoped once I put them in the oil. Next time I will be sure to add extra herbs and spices as well as another egg.

Great traditional recipe.  I made them for my son for dinner today along with homemade applesauce, bacon, and homemade dinner rolls.  We like lots of onion, so I increased the onion.  Green onion would be good. I used crisco because I read that it fries better, but I think I'll use the canola next time.  For those of you who serve this with applesauce; I can't stres enough how much better with homemade, and applesauce is SO easy to make.  Your kids will love you for it!
