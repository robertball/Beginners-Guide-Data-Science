These garlic knots are great, but I work at a pizzeria so I know you have to make them hot. Pour the toppings over them right when they come out so it soaks in. If you wait until they are cold it coats the outside and gets messy.

this was a delicious recipe,however I baked the knots for a while just before they turned golden brown, and then I coverd them with everything and baked it till golden brown so the flavor soaked in.

I made these for our bowling league and they were a huge hit. I decided to add all the ingredients to the olive oil so the flavors would infuse and it really turned out great!  Patti

These are delicious!  I used butter instead of oil (personal preference), and gently boiled minced garlic in the butter for a few minutes.  I brushed the knots with the butter/garlic prior to baking, baked for the designated time, brushed them with the butter/garlic again after taking them out of the oven, then sprinkled a little garlic salt and peccorino-romano cheese on top.  Fabulous!  I will never order these at a pizza joint again!

I did not have refrigerated bread dough but I did have refrigerated crescent rolls. I used that instead. I used just a pinch of salt. I took the top reviewer's suggestion and brushed the rolls with this olive oil mixture right out of the oven. That was the way to go. We really liked these. I think this would be good with italian seasoning, too.

Made these for me and my husband last night. We both think they're sensational; really tasty. Only problem, like for all garlic recipes, is your breath when you wake up next morning! Oh well, it definitely won't stop us having them again!

I had high hopes for this recipe as I was able to pick up cans of pizza dough on sale... But I didn't care for these hot. They were much better a few hours later. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic so that my two year old would be more inclined to try them (and I was glad I did this as she liked them), and I omitted the parsley and red pepper. But the olive oil was too much for it, both the quantity and the flavor. I will definitely try this again, but next time I'll mix garlic powder and salt into melted butter (not olive oil) to make a garlic spread sort of thing and pour it over the hot knots. Thanks, Jimmbo, it's just my tastes that are wonky. :)

These were easy and so good. I decided to dip the unbaked dough into the mixture prior to baking instead of after. My gang really enjoyed them Jim and thanks!

very yummy- garlicky!! Used local deli's premade pizza dough. Would probably be great if you changed toppings to a cinnamon sugar for dessert too!

Delicious and super easy to make! I recommend sprinkling garlic powder on the pizza dough before shaping the knots, gives it a more authentic flavor rather than only have the flavors on top. Then when out of oven brush butter and sprinkle some minced garlic and parsley on top. Agree with others that these need to be eaten while hot and fresh, they just don't taste the same cold or reheated.

A very good recipe. I mostly followed the directions given but I did make my own pizza dough using the Master pizza dough recipe from this site and used butter with just a splash of olive oil instead of all oil, it's just a personal preference in our house. To the butter/garlic/red pepper/parsley which I heated together to melt and let flavors combine I added a bit of dried basil, oregano and a dash of granulated garlic. My husband and I loved it! Easily restaurant quality!

I would recommend cutting the salt down. I used basil instead of parsley and dipped them in tomato sauce. Perhaps including the garlic at the bottom of the pan with some olive oil might kick some of the garlic after taste.

delicious! i grated about 8 cloves of garlic and mixed that with the salt. then, after i'd made a paste with the garlic and salt i added olive oil and butter, freshly grated parmesan, and crushed red pepper. also, i lightly brushed the bottom of the pan and the top of the knots before i baked them to get a nice golden crust during baking. did as others said and tossed it all together straight out of the oven, and it was garlicky, salty, cheesy, and perfect!

These were fantastic! 6 tablespoons seemed like way overkill in the garlic department even for a cook like me who believes garlic is better than sliced bread. I'm not sure they didn't mean 6 cloves instead. I used 2 1/2 tables spoons minced. And easy way to keep your knots neat and pretty is to first gently knot them and the pinch the loose ends together so they are not only pretty but they cook evenly. the fresh grated parm was great but it sort of fell off so I think the fake stuff might just be better. I also mixed it all together in a measuring cut before mixing in with the bread knots and it worked great.

I doubled the amount of dough but did about 1.5 of everything else.  These were the hit of the party.  Had a dinner party with 11 people and these were all gone by the end of the night!  Will definitely make again.

Quick and easy garlic rolls.  Because mine baked up so puffy, I did not put them in a bowl and drizzle with olive oil.  I mix up the olive oil, garlic, cheese, parsley, red pepper and salt and drizzled that while they were on the cookie sheet.  They were delicious with 'Lasagna Stuffed Shells' from AR and a tossed salad.

Whoa!! These things are out of this world! I used challah dough (any homemade white bread dough will do). I put all the ingredients (except for the cheese because I wanted this dairy free) in a big bowl and rolled the hot rolls around the bowl. Then I set them on a tray to dry. I served this with a big Greek salad and my family was raving!

The whole family loves these. The only tip I have is not to use garlic from a jar!  Someone had left some at our house and I used it in order to save time.  It ruined the knots. I had to convince the whole family to try them again. Now we eat them frequently.

L-O-V-E these! I used all the garlic called for and thought it might be too much, but it was perfect! I also used grated Parmesan and fresh basil (in lieu of parsley). I rolled the knots in this mixture prior to baking and they were delicious...crispy on the outside and soft inside. Very garlicky and SO FABULOUS!

I wanted to like this recipe, I really did.  Perhaps I didn't do something right but it just tasted greasy.  Perhaps it was because I used minced garlic instead of fresh.  I had difficulty getting the oil to stick and soak in the knots. They were good, but not what I was expecting.  I also thought the knots were better the next day after they sat.

Not very fond of this recipe at all. It was very simple to make, but far to much oil and toppings.  Personally I was not sure of the toppings, the taste did not seem to work well enough for me.  Pretty sure you would have just been better off brushing on a little olive oil and adding a few Italian herbs, parmesan and garlic.  I doubt I will make this again.

Coming from NJ to TX has been a culture shock when it comes to good Italian food...Fahgetaboudit! This recipe is just about as good as the knots we'd get from our favorite pizza joint back in NJ and so easy to prepare.

These would have been absolutely divine...if I hadn't burnt the bottoms of them. Tops looked golden brown, they are deceiving. I can see that the taste would be just great if I hadn't done that though. Will be making this again but keeping a closer eye on them next time.

My family loved these garlic knots!  I must admit that I used an 11 oz. can of refrigerator breadstick dough in place of the pizza dough, and it worked just fine (I didn't want to bother with rolling out the pizza dough)--tie each pre-cut strip of breadstick dough into a knot and bake at 375 until golden (about 12 minutes).  The only other thing I would mention about this recipe is that I don't think you need nearly the amount of topping (garlic, cheese, etc.) that is called for--most of it won't stick to the amount of knots you will make.  I had a lot of topping left over at the bottom of the bowl after spending quite a while mincing all that garlic.  Nonetheless, great flavor, and now a family favorite in our house!

YUM! I only had evoo, and I thought that would be too strong,  so I used butter instead, and I used less salt than called for (just to taste)...so good...a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

My husband and I love getting garlic knots from this little Italian restaurant down the road. So we were excited to find this recipe online, and seeing how it was the only one that looked closest to what we knew. But when we tried it, we used a 13 ounce can of pizza dough instead of 10. However, we used less of the ingredients. We used the salt as directed (we still thought it was a bit much) and 2 tablespoons of minced garlic instead of 6 and everything else the same. The garlic was even just a BIT much for us and the salt was so strong, we threw the rest of our garlic knots out. Next time we'll be using just a pinch of salt as it overpowered everything. Other than that we think the alterations of the recipe would be just fine. Can't wait to try it again. Thank you for posting this though, it's the closest we've come to finding the real deal.

These were good but I definately had better.  I do like how easy they were to prepare.  But, it was way too much olive oil and garlic.  This is coming from a garlic LOVER.  I think I will tweak this my way next time and it will be a keeper.

I used this recipe as a base to inspire.  I used refrigerated bread stick dough and cut each stick in half to form the knots.  Instead of olive oil, I used just a few T. of melted butter, with 1 clove of minced, fresh basil, 2T. parm. cheese finely chopped, and salt.  I cooked the knots until lightly golden and then tossed into the butter mixture.  I then pulled the knots out of the butter, so they would not be soggy.  These were great this way.

I don't know what happened.  I baked the dough and then drizzled the oil & sprinkled the seasonings and lightly tossed the knots in a large bowl.  But the cheese & seasonings lumped together and there was FAR too much garlic.  I'll keep looking.....

This was awesome.  I only had canned cresent rolls in the fridge - so I improvised.  Also, have chopped garlic in the jar from the Produce Section (higher 'shelf life') & dried parsley.  I am a cook that takes short cuts.  But with utilizing these - this recipe is awesome.  Co-workers were awed!  Thanks Jimmbo!  (Sorry to belittle your awesome recipe with 'quickie-fixes' - but that is a compliment - I think!)

I used a tube of breadsticks and twisted 2 together, baked  per directions on package. I used the topping per the recipe. They were great! 1/2 the recipe was perfect for 1 package of breadsticks.

I actually used the Pizza Dough II instead of store bought since it makes 3 pizza crusts and I had on hand. I also uses Exquisite Pizza Sauce because, again, I had it in my freezer from a previous meal. If you are interested in making a vegan version, then you can grind equal parts raw cashews and nutritional yeast along with a dash of salt to make dairy free Parmesan. That small change will make this recipe cholesterol free.

These are orgasmic!!! And I figured out the perfect topping recipe. While the knots are baking, melt 1 stick of butter, 3 Tbsp of minced garlic (I use jarred) a shake of parsley and a shake of crushed red pepper. As it melts all the flavors infuse. Then, as soon as they are out of the oven, drizzle them with the butter mixture (I use a spoon.) This makes the perfect amount to cover all the garlic knots. Then just sprinkle with the parm cheese. These taste great when left out over night on the counter lol.

I can't believe there is anyone out there who doesn't LOVE this recipe.  I cut back a bit on the salt and oil, but left the rest as is.  I cook very intricate dishes a lot of the time, but these are so simple and everyone goes crazy when I serve them.

I made these using Jay's Signature Pizza crust recipe from this site. They were awesome! There was a lot of garlic left in the bowl, but that was probably for the best. They were still very garlicy just from the garlic-infused oil. I made about 20 of them, and they were gone by the end of the meal eaten by my three girls. Two of them are under five and they loved them too! My four year old said next time I make them she will eat them all herself.

I liked the flavor of these but the process didn't seem to work. Next time I make them I will mix the oil, cheese, garlic, etc and then pour it over the knots without taking them out of the pan and then bake a little longer to melt the cheese. Also, there was no bake time for the knots and I believe it took me about 12 minutes to get them golden brown.

These were really good. I did a few things differently but I don't think it made a difference in the taste. First I used my homemade pizza dough and second I melted the butter with the garlic in it for awhile on the stove and brushed on the dough before cooking. Then I stirred in the parmesan and brushed the rest of the mixture on after they came out of the oven. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are very good.  I did not get 24 out of the 10 oz. pizza crust but it's still a work in progress.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and, instead of putting them on a greased sheet pan, I put on the olive oil mixture (which had been infused in the olive oil for over 4 hours) while cooking and then added the additional ingrediants, after the initial cook time.  The smaller ones I was told needed more time, the bigger ones were too done.  I'll update as I try this again.  Thanks for an alternative tho Jimbo.

These were really good. The only problem was that some of the knots turned out really small and cooked faster than others. But the herbs and olive oil mixture was soo delicious. I put some on the bread before I cooked them and then also put more sauce on right when they came out of the oven. Delicious. Everyone gobbled them up!

This is a recipe where measuring is not essential.  I made the knots, and put them in a Ziploc bag with some garlic salt, parsley, parmesan, and minced garlic and shook it up.  It worked really well.  The only down side to this recipe is that the pizza dough costs about a dollar more than grocery store garlic bread and take a lot more effort.  They do taste good though and you don't have to really measure, just dump all the stuff in a bag and shake.

A little on the greasy side. A little bland but I didn't use much red pepper or salt. Everyone else liked them but next time don't cut the pizza dough into such small pieces.

Good! I used garlic powder instead of fresh because I'm not a fan of uncooked garlic. Instead of drizzling and sprinkling, I mixed the oil, cheese, and seasonings together and then brushed onto the knots with a pastry brush. Very good. Thanks! :)

I make this using 2 thawed packs of frozen pizza dough. I double the topping recipe, but reduce the garlic, Parmesan, salt and red pepper by half. I love Garlic and salt, but trust me, the amount stated is way too much. The other thing I do is place the knots up against each other on the sheet. When they are baked you pull them apart and it leaves a soft spot on the knot that soaks up the oil better. Also, fresh parsley is a MUST, not dried, and fresh garlic, not jared. This is a winner made this way in our house. I've quadrupled the recipe for many pot luck type events and it is always a huge hit.

This recipe is fantastic. I am originally from LI NY and now live in outback Western Australia. I was missing a taste of NY and found this recipe for garlic knots. It has been a hit every time I have made it and I think I have single-handedly brought NY garlic knots to Outback Australia!

These knots were great with spaghetti last night.  I reduced the garlic to 3 TBSP and that was still alot.  I also used canned breadsticks and brushed them with the garlic/oil/spices mixture once prior to baking and again when they came out.  Easy to make and everyone enjoyed them!

These were really good.  I made as directed but in the end had to add some melted butter on top.  We love our butter in this house and found that a must on them.  But otherwise very good.  Nice way to use up pizza dough that I mistakenly bought :)

While these were good in flavor, I thought the prep time took to long.  I left out the red pepper flakes because I thought they might be too spicy for my kids. My dough also was very sticky and delicate and stretched easily.  Next time I will cut them into strips and just twist them slightly and use as bread sticks.  I used these knots with way/easy pizza sauce/bread stick dip recipe.

THE BEST RECIPE EVER!!!  I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS RECIPE FOR A LONG TIME!  I've tried to reproduce one of my favorite garlic rolls at an Italian restaurant, but every time, they never turned out the same.  This recipe is the one I've been looking for!!!  It is so delicious!  I used the frozen bread dough rolls from the grocery store, let them defrost, and then shaped them into the knot shape.  I also left out the pepper flakes as my chidren and I do not like spicy food.  I used garlic powder because I was too lazy to chop fresh garlic, but tonight I am making this recipe again, and I'm using fresh garlic.  I'm sure it will be just as good, if not better!

these were really good!!!  I took about half a stick of butter & melted, adding two garlic cloves that I put through my garlic press & sprinkled some basil in the mix too.  Spoon drizzled over the knots before I baked.  They took about 7 minutes in the oven.  Served to two families that came over this past weekend with my spaghetti & meatballs & there were only 3 left!  Eating for lunch today!  Will definatly make these again!

Great recipe, Jimmbo! I have made these twice because I wanted to see what the difference would be between dipping them in the olive oil mixture before and after baking. The after was way less messy. But I thought both were equally delicious. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!

A little strong on the garlic side. If you love garlic these are for you. Mine were kinda small. I think I would make less than the 12 to make them bigger. Overall they were very good and I would make them again.

Delicious! Used butter instead of oil because that sounded better to me personally and less garlic, again, for personal preference. They turned out great and the crowd I served them to were SHOCKED that they were homemade. Said they were pizzeria quality and I agree!

Love this recipe, although I did make some changes, I used 3 tablespoons of garlic 2 1/2 of the grated Parmesan 2 of the parsley and the rest I left as is.  I cooked the knots till they were almost done, put them in a bowl with the ingredients to coat them well them put them back in the oven to finish cooking.  They came out so good.  The whole family loves them and will definitely be making them again and again.

These were delicious and so easy. I made pizza dough and substituted basil instead of parsley. Next time I would probably switch out the olive oil for butter like others have suggested. I baked them for 8 min and then pulled them out and covered them with the olive oil mixture and covered them all and topped them with the cheese. Baked for another couple of minutes until the cheese browned.

Okay right out of the oven.  Not so much when cool.   First, I am a garlic lover but,  6 tablespoons must be a typo.  I used less than half and it was still too much.  I shook the twists in a plastic bag that contained the mixture and it helped with cleanup.  I baked half of them with mixture on and half without.  My preference was for the ones baked with mixture on.  Still tasted like canned biscuits though.  Bet they're good with fresh dough.

Way too much garlic and parsley, and I love garlic! Coated in butter before cooking (don't recommend), cooked about 15 minutes, and then coated in 'sauce.' Kids and husband liked them and ate most. Would make again, but with less garlic, parsley, and definitely wait until the end to coat.

Just not impressed. I cut the garlic back to 3 sm-med cloves, but the garlic was still far too over-powering. I think powdered garlic would be better for coating the knots. Olive oil was over-powering too. Perhaps half butter half oil would be better.

VERY easy to make.  My oven is very hot so the 450 was burning the bottoms I turned it down to 380 and just fine.  Similar to another reviewer, I brushed the tops before putting into oven, sprinkled with  cheese, Italian spices, and Garlic pepper. Then I brushed the tops again while in oven, and once more out of the oven (right away), to sprinkle more cheese on.  A hit with myi party!

I made these for my supervisors birthday lunch and there wasn't so much as a chunk of garlic left in the bowl. My bosses daughter even stole the last one straight out of my bosses mouth. I'll be looking forward to the same reaction tonight at Thanksgiving dinner (minus the mama bird, baby bird event)

I ended up putting mozzarella in the dough and made rolls. I baked about 17 minutes. Added the oil garlic parsley and Parmesan cheese together and then as soon as the came out brushes and tossed it in the garlic sauce. Delicious.

My girlfriend absolutely loves them. I think they are pretty tasty, but I don't get quite as excited as she does. It's important keep an eye on them while they bake as it doesn't take very long! Tasty, easy appetizer.

These were so easy and everyone loved them. I made homemade pizza dough using my bread machine, I added 1/4 cup butter and  poured sauce over  knots before cooking with excess on pan. They are sooooo good! Highly recommend this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and they didn't puff up, were flat pieces of pie dough.  I'm wondering if your supposed to let them rise before baking? The flavor is good but mine were flatter than door nails!! Won't attempt again

Mine got a little overdone on the bottom.  Not sure why, as I used an insulated pan.  But I will try them again.  Maybe at a lower temperature.  They were still popular at a lasagna pot luck.

I made some changes that were recommended by others who made them.

used the Pillsbury crescent roll - two cans for a total of 16 rolls.

in a bowl, mixed crushed garlic (fresh, not the jarred stuff), fresh flat parsley, chopped, red pepper flakes, EEVO (extra virgin olive oil),  grated parmesan cheese.  Since I was going to use the mix to coat the inside of the triangles, I added a little more of all ingredients....just don't use a lot of oil.

I spread some of the mix on each triangle, gently rolled them, not too tight.

the oven......if you use the crescent rolls, preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Place on the rack, second notch down from top of oven.  This way the bottoms of the rolls won't burn.

Pan - I used flat pans, lined with non-stick foil.  This way you don't need to grease the pan at all.  

baked until a light to medium brown.

remove - while hot, on each one, spread a LITTLE EEVO, then sprinkle the parmesan cheese -  you can also add more parsley on top if you wish - I did not do that.

Gently press the cheese on top of the rolls so it sticks better.

Then enjoy!

I used melted butter and added the garlic and parmesan which I brushed on before and after baking.  Next time I think I will use powdered garlic as my mixture was pretty thick.

We changed the proportions of the ingredients, but used everything that was listed, and WOW.  Just delicious - even my 6 and 8 year old loved them.  No vampires will be visiting us tonight... for several nights most likely.  Well done Jimmbo!

I made these with a chicken rosini dish for my husbands birthday and we both absolutely loved them! I used pizza dough that was intended for a New York style pizza. I used shredded Parmesan and it didn't stick as well as I would have liked so next time I will be using grated. I also like to put more garlic as well on mine because I'm a big garlic fan!

For some reason I couldn't get the toppings to stick to the garlic knots.  I had to mash them on each one individually.  May also try substituting butter for the oil in the future.  Flavor wasn't 100% what I was going for.

This was a good recipe, but I made a few changes to suit my family's tastes after first trying them the original way. In stead of putting the toppings on after the knots are baked, I combined all ingredients (minus the cheese and knots) in a bowl an hour before hand and let them infuse the oil. Then I dipped the UNCOOKED knots in the oil infusion, covered them with the parmesan and baked them.  We preferred them my way. :)

Instead of using a store-bought pizza dough, I used Valentino's Pizza Crust from this site. I also put the olive oil and the rest of the ingredients into a large zip-loc bag and mixed it in there.

My family loved these! I used the dough for Garlic Cheese Flatbread by Gina S., but the toppings for these. The next time I will combine the oil, garlic, parsley and salt, then sprinkle on the Parmesan cheese. Oh, I did lightly saute the garlic in the oil, and also added some butter to it. Then I brushed it on immediately upon taking the rolls from the oven.

Yum.  6 tbsp of garlic is way too much for this recipe.  I only put 4 tbsp in and it was still too much.  The next time, I used 2tbps and it was perfect.  We tried it with thin crust refrigerated dough and thick crust... equally as good.

This recipe was super easy and very yummy!  The ONLY thing that I would change is to reduce the salt a little.  Maybe I put in too much (I am almost positive I  put in the correct amount), but it was just a little too salty.  I would maybe cut it in half?  I will try it with the reduced salt with the next batch, and they should be perfect!

Awesome, looking forward to making these again! I used fresh dough from my local grocery store.  After drizzling with olive oil, I combined the garlic, cheese, parsley, red pepper & salt all together, then sprinkled a little bit at a time while tossing.

I just made these and they are delicious.  I made my own pizza dough in the bread machine.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried instead.  Like others suggested, I cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, which is plenty and could probably be cut down a bit more.  The garlic, parsley, cheese, olive oil and pepper are a fantastic combination.  I mixed all the topping ingredients and tossed with the knots as soon as they came out of the oven.  Delicious and easy - even when you make the dough yourself.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great idea - but WAY too much salt as written.  (And I like salt, believe me!)  I think next time I might either use 1/4 tsp. or leave it out altogether.  I was concerned that the garlic might be a bit sharp if left completely raw, so I gave about a minute of saute time in some of the oil.  I used an entire head of garlic, and it still only produced about 4 1/2 tbsp. minced - and that was definitely enough.

Easy and yummy.  Only took ten minutes start to finish.  I also mixed half butter with the oil and nuked it with the garlic and spices.  Then tossed it all with the warm knots and Parmesan cheese.

Holy smokes!  Family gobbled these little boogers up. My 8 year old actually said, "Please pass the knots of glory."  I did use butter instead of olive oil, and used dried parsley, as I didn't have fresh on hand.  Nom nom nom.

These are fantastic. I used half olive oil and half butter and my own pizza dough recipe, but kept everything else the same. My son said these were the best garlic knots he's ever had (and we've sampled many). Thank you for the great recipe.

Very good, but I agree with others.. a little bit too much garlic. Very easy to make and will make this recipe again!

Made using the "sweet dinner rolls" recipe from this site and added less of the topping on to each "knot". So good, these were a request from my husband (we've had these before). :)

These were sooo goood!!! I made them for dinner one night to go with the steak. The next night my friend had made them also for dinner! They disappeared very quickly! I used the refrigerated can pizza dough while she used the ready-to-use pizza dough they sell in the Publix bakery. They both turned out to be very yummy!

This recipie was amazing!!! It was soo easy, and delicious! I used fresh pizza dough that I bought from the super market. I prepared all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and sat on top of the oven to let them heat up. Then put the ingredients in a big mixing bowl. As soon as the knots were out of the oven I mixed them while steaming hot! My husband and I ate all 24 of them! Delicious recipie, thanks for sharing

These were very good.  I used the bread sticks since I didn't have pizza dough and took some of the other suggestions and brushed them with butter first and added some fresh basil.  When they came out of the oven I sprinkled them with parm and some coarse salt.  Next time I'll make sure to have the pizza dough on hand and will try it as written.  I did think they were very good and my family loved them.

These are really tasty! My kids and I all loved them - I made them to accompany the Lasagna dish I got from this site. I used real butter and 2-T of jarred/refrigerator minced garlic and was surprised- I should have used a bit more. I also dipped them in the melted butter & garlic, sprinkled with all seasonings before baking - when golden brown, I took out and sprinkled with the cheese. VERY tasty! Thank You 4 this recipe!

I absolutely loved these! I did make quite a few changes though. I pureed the garlic with the oil and poured it over the knots before baking. I also used fresh basil in place of the parsley which I added with the parmesan as soon as I took them out of the oven. Even my 3 year old son loved this recipe!

These were really easy, my oven cooked them in just under 15 minutes.  My daughter said these were just like the pizza place.  Very easy!  I used butter instead of olive oil.  Will make again!

I love these and they were so addicting. I used the can bread sticks instead of cutting up pizza dough. My bf said it was to much garlic so next time i will cut that down but still its very good.

So much better than the pizza place!  I made these exactly as listed but only used half the amount of the spice mixture just because I knew the kids wouldn't eat all that topping.  But I kept the extra topping to dunk in for the adults!  Such an easy and tasty recipe!

I followed the recipe almost exact except I did omit the pepper flakes & cut the galic way down like some suggested. I thought it was way too much olive oil. I will make them again but cut the olive oil in 1/2. My kids did like them though!

They came out hard, too much garlic and the red pepper had too much bite for some. I would not make them again.

Giving a 4 only cause I didnt use pizza or bread dough....I used a can of crescent dough cut into 16 pieces. I made into mini knots and brushed with some of the oil-garlic-herb mixture prior to baking and then brushed again after baking. I used dried parsley instead of fresh and also added some dried oregano. I only used 2 tblspns. of fresh minced garlic which I thought was way more than enough....very tasty! Will try again with pizza or bread dough. Thanks!

This recipe is awesome!  The only thing wrong with the recipe is that it calls for way too much fresh garlic.  I shook off the excess garlic from knots and they were really good.  I used dried parm in the can it seemed to work better than fresh parm would.  The next time I make these, I will reduce the fresh garlic to only 1-2 teaspoons.  I will add garlic powder.  I used fresh parsley to this and it is a really pretty presentation.  Definitely try these!

LOVE these! I've made them twice. The second time I used bread stick dough which was even better and easier. The crushed red pepper and garlic combo is perfect. Makes a great appetizer.

I use this recie all the time now to feed a flat full of 5 adults.  I make my own pizza dough and let the oil infuse while the strips are baking.  I use any chees i have and just a little its not the cheese that makes it. then spoon it over for equal coverage and let it rest.  Theres never any leftovers.

Tried this recipe out for my son's pizza birthday party and everyone enjoyed them. They were easy to make. I prepared them on the baking sheet the day before and I also mixed up the oil and seasonings so that they could marry up. After they were done I stirred the seasoned oil and tossed with the knots. Delicious!

These were pretty good.  It made a ton of tiny little knots.  I used butter & tossed all toppings on in a bowl after baking.  I'd make these again, but adjust the garlic amt & try to get bigger knots.

very good. i left out the red pepper. and used butter in place of the oil. (i melted the garlic and butter together) for the people who complained about chopping the garlic, i use 'gourmet garden' garlic its in a squeze tube, and you find it in the produce section near the fresh herbs. (thats where they have it at Publix)

These were good-- spicy!!  I screwed up making them and combined the olive oil with the seasonings before I realized what I had done.  Since I knew it wouldn't look as nice spreading it on after it cooked, I cooked it with the spread on.  I look forward to trying it again the correct way!

These are terrific.  The kids always love when I make these.  The only thing different I do is use homemade pizza dough.
