This bread is excellent and very quick and easy to make. I only had one package of yeast so I was only able to make one loaf. I did sprinkle kosher salt and some mixed herbs on top during the second rising period. One other note is that this bread sticks very bad to your pan so make sure you use lots of shortening to grease the loaf pan.

We didn't care for it. It didn't have much of an onion flavor.  It didn't rise very well either, maybe it was my yeast.

This recipe is delicious and pretty easy.  I added real minced onions and garlic instead of the mix and it turned out great.  Thanks for posting!

Fabulous bread! It looks just like a loaf you would get from the supermarket, but tastes even better. I cut the recipe in half and it worked very well. Don't change a thing!

I only make 1 loaf at a time, but I use the entire package of dry onion soup mix for half of the recipe.  5 stars made this way!

Made this for the first time today and it was wonderful! I used water instead of milk to make it non-dairy, and it was still perfect. Garnished with chopped onion before I baked it. My dad couldn't believe I made it!

My family and I really like this yummy recipe.  I only made one loaf, but I still used an entire packet of the soup mix because I like the stronger onion flavor.  It was my first try at baking bread on my own (just last night, without a stand mixer or bread machine for help) and to my surprise, the loaf baked up perfectly.  It's delicious!  I added a small handful of canned mushrooms that I dried out a bit in the oven first, and then I topped the loaf off with a few sliced spanish olives to make it look different.  This bread makes tasty ham sandwiches, or it can just be eaten alone.  I will be making this one again soon.

This came together nicely, it's just taking donkey's years to rise. Almost two hours later and it's finally risen to almost the top of the loaf pan! I'll edited my review later after I've baked it and we've tried it with dinner.

This was great bread, even though I did some things wrong.  I don't have a bread pan, so I used muffin pans.  I halved the recipe, which gave me 15 rolls.  I still used an entire packet of onion soup mix because I wasn't paying attention.  Despite all this, the rolls were delicious, and I really want to get a bread pan and follow the directions properly because I'm sure it'd be even better!

This bread is really good, but I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars...I'd rate it a 4.5 if I could.  I served it with some homemade vegetable-beef soup and it was a nice accompaniment.  Everybody had seconds of the bread (and soup!).  I'll make again as it was easy and tasty.

I loved this!  I changed the technique considerably, however, to make it even easier. To start with, I used a Knorr onion soup mix which is double the recommended size, so I left out the salt. I also added about a cup of grated old cheddar. But here's how I made the process easier: I used fine yeast (fast rising or bread machine) and mixed it with 2 1/2 cups of the flour and the grated cheese, then I put this aside. I scalded the milk in a pyrex measuring cup in the microwave, added the butter afterwards, which melted in the hot milk, then added the cold water, which made the liquid the perfect temperature without having to wait for it to cool. I added the soup mix and sugar to the liquid, mixed well to dissolve the sugar, then whisked the liquid mixture into the flour/yeast/cheese mixture. I let the yeast dissolve and start working, and returned 20 minutes later to find the mixture starting to bubble from the action of the yeast. Finally I added the remaining 3 3/4 cups of flour, and started kneading when the mixture got too thick for the wooden spoon. I kneaded it really REALLY well, so that it was smooth and elastic, then divided it into loaf pans and let it rise only once. Next time it might be nice with chia or sesame seeds added to the dough.

The flavor was delicious, but it was a heavy dense bread. Still I will make this again, the flavor was so good & unique but not too strong. It was a sticky dough at first but sprinkled with flour as recommended took care of that :) I will try to upload my picture of them.

this bread was perfect! I love onion bagels and that's what I was looking for in the way of flavor. It was so easy. I'm sure I didn't even form the loaves very well, but they still baked perfectly! great recipe!

Great Recipe, thanks for sharing! I used i half of this recipe without 1 package dry onion soup mix. I did put some herb like oregano, basil, dill, parsley, green onion, and slices onion on the top! baked it for 50 min!

Great bread!  So tasty but only when it's hot and fresh.  The next day it's kind of dry and stale tasting.

This bread was easy to make and full of flavor.  My who family family enjoyed it.  And the onion flavoring is not overpowering like my wife thought it would be.

This was really delicious.  I baked one loaf in a stone loaf pan and preferred it as there was no sticking.  My second loaf was in a metal pan (I did grease it) and it still stuck a bit.
