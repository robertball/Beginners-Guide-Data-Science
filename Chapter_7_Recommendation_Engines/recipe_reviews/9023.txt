This is a really good one!!!  Definitely double the sauce.  Here is what I did differently.  Used lite soy sauce to cut the salt, increased the garlic, used 1 tsp. minced fresh ginger.  A lot of reviewers said to half the amount of sugar but I tasted it and felt I needed to add more but not the whole amount.  Since I doubled the sauce, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar.  I lined my pan with heavy duty foil then poured most of the thickened sauce over bone-in thighs (skin removed) and some boneless breasts but reserved a little.  Cooked, covered with foil for 30 minutes, removed foil, poured remainder of sauce over and bake another 20-30 minutes.  Wow.  Really good! Update: I made this again using slices of tri tip and it was great.  Fantastic with salmon.  I had a large fillet and basically baked it the same way but reduced the oven temp. to 375 and baked for a little less time till fish was flakey.

Delicious!  I substituted 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and dumped all the sauce on top prior to cooking.  I also used an 8x8 baking dish and cooked at 400 degrees for 35 mins.  It turned out GREAT!

Absolutely wonderful! The recipe didn't mention it, but I decided to cover the pan with foil to help keep the chicken tender. And I used lite soy sauce too. I think I may decided to line the pan with foil too the next time I make it--otherwise, you have a sticky, black mess. Delicious flavor, and the chicken was so tender. Will definitely make again.

Excellent. After reading several reviews, I did make the following changes: Doubled the sauce. In the doubled recipe, I doubled the garlic (fresh pressed), reduced sugar by half and used packed brown sugar instead of white sugar, used lite soy sauce (I always use lite, regular is TOO salty), rounded the tablespoons of cornstarch, used fresh ground pepper (five pepper blend), and I had boneless, skinless thighs. I baked at 375 degrees, 25 mins covered with foil, then 15 mins uncovered (total 40 mins). I did not baste, but just covered the thighs with the sauce. Would've used fresh ground ginger if I'd had it. Cleanup was a breeze as long as I soaked pans right away, it washed right out. With these changes it was scrumptious and got rave reviews from my family. Great with thighs, would also try breasts or other cuts. Definitely a keeper! Thanks Marian!

I make this recipe in a slow cooker and it is simply fantastic. I just put the chicken thighs in, cover with the sauce (exact recipe)and put it on low for at least 5 hours.  The longer the chicken cooks the more savory the dish, and the chicken just falls apart (shreds) in the sauce.  About an hour before I'm ready to serve I throw in some chopped green pepper, carrots, celery (or whatever vegetables I want to get rid of in the fridge), and then 20 minutes before serving I throw in a can of drained pineapple chunks. The pineapple removes the saltiness and the dish is perfect spooned over rice.  Absolutely amazing! I find this recipe foolproof --today I tripled the sauce (made 20 thighs), dropped the bowl and lost most of the sauce all over myself and the floor (GOD what a mess!) and was too lazy to make more so just used whatever was left.  It STILL came out perfect!!  And if the sauce is too thin I just remove some from the crockpot, add a little cornstarch paste and/or Veloutine gravy thickener, microwave it till it boils and thickens and mix it back in with the rest. Too easy!  Thank you for an unforgettable recipe that everyone loves!

Fantastic!!! This has become a favorite in my house. The only changes I make is using boneless skinless chicken breasts and I do cut the soy sauce down a bit and I substitute some of the white sugar for brown sugar to cut down on the saltiness because my husband thought it was a bit too salty. Also,do cut the temp down on this. I go 375 for the first 15 minutes or so and then down to 350 for another 20-25 minutes. Continually baste to get that yummy glaze. Terrific recipe!!! Definately 5*'s!!!

What a great homemade teriyaki sauce! It has a much richer taste, than many bottled. The only thing I changed was I used a "low-sodium" soy. To make a meal, I added fresh snow peas, sliced water chestnuts, squares of yellow onion and green pepper, and fresh pineapple chunks. We put over white rice. It was as good as a very good oriental restaurant's! We did not like the chicken thigh dark-meat with the bone in much though, so next time I will make with chicken breast,BONELESS,SKINLESS thigh meat, shrimp, or pork. Thank you Marian, this sauce is a keeper!

This recipe is totally awesome. You owe it to yourself to try it. I took the advice of other reviewers and I cooked the chicken at 375 degrees. The teriyaki sauce is best I have ever had. I doubled up on the sauce for basting purposes. I used chicken breasts and cut them in strips and served on top of brown rice which was cooked in chicken broth,cooked onions,and a dash of soy sauce. Thanks MARIAN

Loved the sauce, although I do plan to reduce the amount of sugar next time.  Poured the sauce over chicken breasts which had been pounded to about 1/2-inch thickness.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes, turning the chicken pieces over halfway through.  Everyone raved about it, even my 2-year-old: yummy, yummy!

This is a great recipe.  I split the sugar into half brown and half white sugar like someone else.  It was so good I made up more teriyaki sauce, bought chicken when it was on sale, and froze the chicken in the teriyaki sauce so it would marinate as it froze and thawed.  Then I cook in the crockpot on low for most of the day.  I like the chicken so tender it falls apart.  Cooking in the crockpot eliminates all the mess others have talked about.  And since you cook the chicken right in/with the teriyaki, you have the hot teriyaki sauce to serve with the chicken.

The is the second time I'm rating this, and it's STILL 5 STAR!  Since I've used this recipe as an hors d'oeuvre and now as a main course I think I get to rate it twice! hehe
Main Course 5 Star Rating ---
Ditto to ellygirl's 5/21 rating/review.  Use boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into 3rds. DOUBLE THE SAUCE! Yum! I used fresh ginger.  I stirred the chunks of meat into a bowl full of the thickened sauce before putting it all into foil lined pan.  Poured the remaining sauce over the meat in the foil lined pan.  Baked 375° for 15 min. Turned meat over...baked another 15 min. Done to perfection.  IF IF IF IF I was to change one thing it would be to use low sodium soy sauce next time.  It was just on the verge of too salty, but still very very VERY good!! I tend to prefer chicken thighs, but this was great with the breasts. 

Hors d'oeuvre - 5 Star Rating - 
YUMMMMMMMY!! I tweaked the recipe just a bit. I used chicken wings (tips removed). I **BAMMED* it up a bit by doubling the fresh garlic. I only basted twice during the baking. Bake 350° 50-55 minutes.  I made an extra batch of the Teriyaki sauce on the stove top while the wings baked. When cooled I mixed in a dollop of sour cream, and served that mixture for a dipping sauce.

Very good!  I used 6 breast pieces with good results.  I baked them at 400 degrees for the first 15 min and then reduced the heat to 375.

This was ok but not great.  I used boneless, skinless breasts and baked for 30 min. basting and turning every 10 min.  My husband liked it.  I thought it was too salty even though I used low-sodium soy sauce.

As a busy Mom, I rarely have the time to make this recipe. (also I dislike the 13 X 9 mess) My remedy: I prep the sauce in a skillet and once thickened, throw in boneless, skinless chicken strips and cook until no longer pink. Quicker and still tasty!

DO NOT COVER YOUR CHICKEN! Lol. I followed some other members advice and it was all wrong. If you cover your chicken in the first half of baking you end up with a pan full of the juices from the chicken. It thins out your sauce and it takes a good hour or so for the juices to evaporate. Also the sauce would not stick to the bottom of the chicken. I ended up throwing them in the broiler for a while and that helped. If you insists on covering your chicken, drain the juices out of the pan half way through. It will save you LOADS of time and effort. I didn't have ginger and I didn't miss it. The sauce was delicious!

The sauce sounds delicious & I plan to try the recipe ASAP, using both thighs & bone in skinless chicken breasts. A couple of comments, 425F with a sauce containing sugar, is much too high, & would very quickly burn. 325- 350F would be better, & even at the lower temperature, baking for an hour  might dry the chicken or burn the marinade. Best to check  with an instant thermometer after the first 30 minutes. to judge the additional  length of cooking time.

Great dish, worth the 5 stars!  I made this today for a dinner party, tripling the sauce amount, and making the following adjustments recommended by other reviewers: 12 boneless, skinless breasts, cut in half cross-wise, fresh ginger, reduced sodium soy sauce. Brushed chicken w/ sauce, turned over and brushed again, then poured remaining sauce over breast pieces and did not turn/brush during baking time.  Had two large baking dishes to fit in the oven, so I baked w/ convection oven at about 380F/195C for approx 25 minutes.  Served chicken on a platter, and accompanied with hot stir-fried veggies (broccoli, snow peas, sliced water chestnuts, yellow onion, julienne carrots, zucchini, red and green pepper, and fresh pineapple), loads of rice, and remaining sauce from the baked chicken (and a tossed green salad for good measure.)  Got rave reviews from my guests; will definitely make this again.

I made a few small changes to improve the flavor of the chicken. I used reduced salt soy sauce, brown sugar instead of white, increased the garlic, used fresh ginger and increased the amount and increased the amount and I threw in some chopped green onions. I made the sauce early in the morning and let it cool a bit before I poured it over the chicken so it could marinate all day. I think that was what made it so good--that it sat in the sauce all day. 350* for about an hour and it was good to go. I'm glad I doubled some of the ingredients, especially the spices and used fresh ginger and green onions. It really helped this recipe really taste awesome.

These are the slight changes I made.  Doubled the sauce for 4 large bone in chicken breasts.  Used low sodium soy, rice wine vinegar, and half white and half brown sugar.  Poured the sauce over the chicken and baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes then turned oven down to 350 for 30 minutes basting often.  Moist and delicious used in my Chinese Chicken Salad!!

This smells wonderful when it is baking!  I read through most of the previous reviews and took some advice.  I used a bag of boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut up in thirds and doubled the sauce.  I also reduced my baking temperature to 400.  It did not need to bake the whole hour either!  I baked mine for about 50 minutes and it was a little tough.  Next time I will try baking it for about 30 minutes.  Very good served on rice!

I love this recipe.  I make the sauce, but add 1/4 cup pineapple juice & then cheat, I put everything in the crockpot for slow cook on 6 hours.  When chicken is ready, I top with 1/2 cup pineapple chunks, 2 chopped spring onions. I let it sit in the warm liquid til warmed thru. Then serve with what my children affectionately call "Mom's jewelled rice".  It makes a wonderful meal!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this before but didn't rate it til now. This is my second time making this and something in the back of my mind said that the last time I made this I should have marinaided this longer. So with that in mind I did warm up the sauce so that the sugar would melt then poured the juice over the chicken pieces in a marinaide bag and left in the fridge overnight. Total time was around 17 hrs. Then I cooked it the way the recipe said. Hubby raved about it. Our friend said that some pieces had more flavor than others so next time I might tenderize the chicken to see how that works. Otherwise this was a great meal and I'll make this again!!

I've made this recipe several times and the family has loved it everytime.  I have found that if you use about 1/2 the sauce at first, bake for 30 minutes....then, remove from oven, pour off most of the excess water that has formed in the pan, and then add more sauce, the chicken glazes over much better.  Turning and basting about every 10 minutes towards the end helps too!

What a FABULOUS recipe!  This is just outstanding!  I did make one significant change, based on previous experiences with roasted chicken: I reduced the temperature to 350 F (and even with this 75 degree difference, an hour-- at least in my oven-- was just about right).  I only had six thighs (I left the skin on for roasting), and the amount of sauce specified was perfect.  I made the sauce ahead of time, and marinated the thighs before cooking them. Many thanks to the reviewers who advised to line the pan with foil-- it made for an easy, painless clean-up.  I garnished the dish with toasted sesame seeds, as another reviewer suggested, and it was the perfect finishing touch.  I served this over brown rice simmered with a bit of soy sauce, seasoned with garam masala, and tossed with some minced green onion, which turned out to be a great flavor complement.  My RM, who is not overly fond of chicken, RAVED about this recipe (and I didn't even have to solicit his opinion, as I usually do).  As for me-- dare I admit it?-- I actually LICKED my PLATE clean!  No doubt about it, this is going to be a featured favorite at our house, and I can hardly wait to make it again.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Very good! Be sure to double the sauce and don't cover. Sauce thinned out too much. Bake 375-20 min each side. Use low sodium soy sauce. Line pan with foil!

This recipe works just fine and the flavours are intense. I challenged two of my studens to prepare and enhance since we try to avoid white sugar and brown sugar is mainly molasses. The first substituted raw cane sugar and increased the acidity by using white wine vinegar and the heat by subsituting jalapeno chili for garlic and also avoided the pepper. The second used melon sugar (available at Asian markets) reducing the amoun to 1/3 C and also substituted the vinegar by using Mirin and retained the garlic. We did a blind test in the class and #2 was held highest but only by a slight point. However, the recipe presented above works fine.

Wonderful!! We served with "Baked Vegetables" recipe also found from this site and the taste was AWESOME! The best part is that it tastes like you spent hours preparing when really, it took only a matter of minutes.  I bet this "sauce" would also taste good with beef(maybe I'll try in the future). Thanks again allrecipes.com for providing busy families like mine a quality meal!

Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe! I used boneless, skinless thighs. I think the original recipe is probably perfect as-is. However, I did use half brown sugar, half white sugar, because I thought that would add nice flavor. Also used low-sodium soy sauce just because that's what we had in the cabinet. It turned out moist, juicy, flavorful, perfect! I cooked it 15 minutes less since I was using boneless thighs.

THIS IS A KEEPER - BIGTIME.  I made this recipe exactly as stated and loved it.  I recommend that you make a double batch to pour over the chicken once it has baked as the original sauce you pour over the chicken while baking becomes diluted with the juice that drains from the chicken.  

I loved it, my husband loves it, his colleagues love it and my mother loves it.  Excellent.  I will never purchase Teriyaki sauce in a grocery store now that I have this recipe.

Excellent!  I also, as a previous reviewer did, used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and just put them in a baking dish with the sauce poured over top; baked at 400 for 35 minutes - fantastic! The only other change - as we are watching our sugar/carb intake, I threw in two packets of Splenda instead of the 1/2 cup sugar.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe. The only thing different that I did was, that I used my crock pot instead of the oven. easy clean up and I was able to make other things instead of basting the chicken every 30 min or so. I just let it cook for about 2 hours and it was wonderful. Once again Thank you.

Wow we just got done eating this for dinner. Very Very Good! 
I would have needed more sauce if I used 12 pieces. I made almost exactly like the recipe calls for, but I could only fit 8 pieces of chicken in my baking dish. The amount of sauce was perfect for that amt of chicken thighes. I used bone in and skin on..Because it's all about the flavor baby. What I do is trim the flap of skin that goes under the thighe and just leave what's on top. I added 1/4 green bell pepper (small slices) I had in the fridge. Mixed it with the sauce. I cooked at 400 for 30 minutes w/foil on top after basting both sides, pulled it out removed foil, turned pieces over and basted heavily. back in at 400 for 30 more minutes. Out of the oven and there was plenty of wonderful sauce all over the chicken. I could not see why to baste every 10 min. Also that would probably keep dropping the temp down in the oven. Put over a bed of white rice with a little bit of the juices sprinkled in the rice. Wonderful flavor just like my favorite chinese restaurant. I don't give out 5 stars very often, even when I like something. But this got 5 stars. A keeper for sure. This old single Dad thanks you very much for this recipe. Oh and I did line the dish with foil then sprayed with pam.

I changed the recipe just a bit by cooking it in the slow cooker.  

Instead of doubling the sauce (per some reviewers), I made the sauce with 3/4 c. brown sugar (instead of white), 3/4 soy sauce, 1/4 c. vinegar, 2 cl. garlic minced, 1 t ground ginger and 1/2 t black pepper and poured it over 3 lbs. of boneless, skinless chicken thighs and 1 coarsely chopped onion.  I cooked it on LOW for about  6 hours, then turned the crock pot on high.  Added 1 can pineapple chunks (drained) and 1 chopped orange pepper, 1 1/2 T. cornstarch mixed with 1 1/2 T. of the leftover pineapple juice and cooked on HIGH for about 1 hour.  

Served over rice (and it had plenty of sauce) and my family LOVED it!  I will definitely make this again!

I have made this twice and I think I got it right this time.  The sauce is excellent, that is, until the chicken juices dilute it in the pan and make it all runny.  My solution is make about four times as much sauce and use half of it for cooking the chicken, the other half to pour over it when it's done.  Strange I didn't read about anyone else with this happening to them, but that's my take on it.  My family ate this right up, the three-year-old even went for thirds!  This will become a very regular dinner for us with those revisions.  Thanks, Marian.

Really good, going to give it an "A".  the reviews are very helpful, I with Valerie'sKitchen & doubled the sauce, including the sugar but went with 3/4 cup brown & 1/4 cup white.  With regular soy sauce, it needed it for me.  Next time will try either light soy, or using water in place of some of the soy, approx 1/4 cup.
Baked for 30 minutes with foil, poured remaining sauce on chicken & baked 20 minutes uncovered.  I baked with skins on, but next time will try removing to see if I like it better (and save on some fat). 
*Also threw some fresh broccoli in the pan  around the chicken for the last 8 minutes of baking.  Very delicious.   Will also try having it all over rice next time.

This one was so good, my boyfriend kept sneaking into the kitchen to swipe a little sauce while it was cooking!  I cooked the chicken as directed and was very pleased with the results.  I doubled the sauce and, as others suggested, substituted the sugar for 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, and also used 2 very large cloves of garlic.  I also added the tiniest pinch of red pepper flakes--it didn't make the sauce spicy but did add a lovely warmth in the background!  I served the chicken sliced over rice with more of the sauce and garnished with sliced scallions. Too good! I can't wait to make this again!  UPDATE: I made this a second time--again, recipe doubled--but used low sodium soy. I didn't notice any difference at all in the taste! I also took another suggestion and lined my pan with non-stick aluminum which made clean up far too easy! This is still a favorite in our house!

I have tried several recipes for teriyaki chicken and this one is my favorite. It tastes like it does in Japanese restaurants.Not to sweet and the perfect thickness so it stays on the chicken while it is baking. Super flavorful and moist. I line my baking pan with foil for easy clean up. Left overs make a great teriyaki chicken bowl the next day. I add rice and broccoli and some sauce- yummy.

I don't often submit reviews for the various recipes I have tried, but, since this one came up as recipe of the day, I feel I must put in my 2cents. This has become a favourite in our household. Works well with breasts as well. The sauce has become a staple for the numerous stir fry's created in our kitchen...even my kids love it and that's saying quite a bit!! Don't change a thing, except you may want to double the sauce to use in other dishes.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I have made it several times now and my family loves it.  My 8 year old actually asked for me to make this dish again and told my sister about "this new recipe mommmy made."  Do line the pan with foil which makes for a much easier clean up.  The only change I made was to cut the sugar in half and add 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I do throw in a few more cloves of garlic also.  If the kids love this recipe how could I not make it again?

Great quick and easy dish!  I used 1 1/2 tsp minced ginger (from the jar) and 3 cloves garlic.  I browned boneless, skinless chicken thighs, removed from pan, made sauce and returned chicken to pan to bake.  I turned the chicken 3 or 4 times while it baked.  It was excellent over rice with sesame green beans on the side.  This would probably be great if you added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little spice.  Will try it next time!

Fabulous! I made this today for my family. Everyone raved and not a bite was left over. Based on previous reviews, I doubled the sauce using 1/2 cup of pineapple juice reserved from a can of pineapple chunks in their own juice and 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar in place of the 1cup white sugar equivalent. I also used a low sodium soy sauce and boneless chicken breast I had cut in 1/2 thickness wise. I coursely chopped 3/4 of a red pepper, 1/4 of a large sweet onion and spread 1/2 a can of pineapple chunks on top of the chicken. I poured the sauce on top of all of this in the baking dish and let it marinate in the fridge for 5 hours. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes, flipping the chicken 1/2 way through. I removed chicken to warm plate and changed oven setting to broil, and let the sauce, onion, pepper and pineapple broil 5 minutes until it was thick. It was perfect to drizzle over the chicken. I served it with white rice. This is a new FAVORITE for my family.

This was awesome! I read previous reviews and lined the pan with foil sprayed with Pam, doubled the sauce part of the recipe, and covered the chicken with foil.  I agree that it was not too sweet or salty.  I had regular soy sauce, and used the advice of one reviewer with 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 cup of granulated sugar. I almost forgot to double the cornstarch. 
I also used some of each cut of chicken ~ thighs and breasts. I believe the thighs were the absolute best! Covering the chicken with half of the sauce, baking it for 30 mins., then turning the chicken and putting the remainder sauce over the chicken was the best idea!  This was so much better than the bottled sauce! 
I paired it with some homemade cole slaw.
Thank you for such a good recipe.  It's a keeper for me!

Marian, another great review for this wonderful recipe. I did as many other reviewers by doubling the sauce. I also used twice the amounts of garlic and ginger, and I found the cooking time to be more like 40 minutes. Truly delicious... a keeper in my book. Thanks for the post!

Great teriyaki recipe, and very easy!  I used chicken breast tenderloins instead of thighs, which decreased the required cooking time (as well as the calories).  I added a little bit of sesame oil, too.  Next time I make this, I will use rice wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar, and fresh minced ginger instead of ginger powder.

This was a wonderful teriyaki chicken recipe.  I have to admit, I was overwhelmed with all different cooking instructions in the thousands of reviews, and every time I read another one, I forgot what the previous one said; finally, I settled on brown sugar instead of white, basting and baking at 375 for 30 minutes, turning and rebasting at 20 minutes, and baking for about 15 minutes more (45 minutes total baking time).  I used boneless breasts, pounded a bit and cut in half.  It was simply delicious.  When I tasted the sauce before I used it, I thought it was much too salty, but when it baked into the chicken, the flavor was perfect.  Every one of my 15 dinner guests (from age 3 to age 65) loved it.  A keeper~~thanks so much.

Mmmm Boy!  That's some delicious Teriyaki sauce.  I'll be using that for grilling too.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  If you do, cut the cooking time to 35 or 40 minutes. Put it in the pan pretty side up and don't turn and baste often. Double the sauce but don't change anything.   I have to disagree strongly with many reviewers that say cover with foil.  All you do is trap the steam and ruin that wonderful gooey coating that forms in the heat of the oven.  DO NOT COVER WITH FOIL!!! Delicious, thanks for sharing.

I am sooooo not a fan of teriyaki, but THIS was really good!!  I was pleasantly surprised!  My husband LOVED it.  We had it over basmati rice and it was great.  The second time I made it I tried doing it in the crock pot, and it came out even better!  It seemed like the sauce really got into the chicken that way, and SO easy!!  Even my picky eater enjoyed it.

This is the first recipe I've tried that tasted better when I ate it the next day as "leftovers". I added some orange juice as suggested by others and a blend of white sugar and brown sugar rather than all white sugar.  The chicken was delicious-thanks!

These were good, everyone liked them and raved about them.  Instead of basting them every 10 mins, what I did was pour all the marinade in, and flipped the pieces every so often, much easier.  I didn't have cider vinegar, so I just used plain vinegar and it worked fine.  The skin was great, but the meat itself was rather plain and I did marinate them for 4 hours.  However, I enjoyed them more when I dipped them in the marinade from the pan.  I think next time, I'll double the marinade so I can have some for dipping.  Will be making again, thanks.

I was just looking for a quick way to prepare some boneless skinless chicken breasts and this looked like a good idea. I admit I wasn't expecting much, just another home made teriyaki sauce, but oh my, was this one GOOD! I prepared it as written, only reducing the sugar to 1/3 of a cup and using seasoned rice vinegar. My soy sauce was low sodium. I put the breasts on a rack on a foil lined tray and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes, basting several times throughout. The sauce formed a beautiful sticky and delicious 'crust' on the outside, while the inside remained juicy and tender. This recipe will be my standard teriyaki basting sauce from now on. I had lots of leftover sauce, and 1.5 breasts left as well. I used those leftovers to make a quick and delicious stir fry the next day.

This was fantastic! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs, Splenda in place of the sugar, and low sodium light soy sauce. I also cut the cider vinegar in half. It came out sooooo well. I marinaded the chicken in the sauce for 6 hours and then baked covered in foil at 375 for 30 minutes. I didn't find it necessary to double the sauce... there was more than plenty for two of us. It really stuck to the chicken breasts and made a thick glaze, which is what I liked best. I will be making this again!

This is a great recipe. I doubled the sauce, but otherwise stuck to the recipe ingredients. I did change one thing in the way I cooked it.  I cooked the chicken thighs for about 20 minutes first, then I drained the liquid that the chicken threw, put the sauce on and continued following the recipe from there.  The first time I made this it never got super sticky because I didn't know to drain the water from the cooking chicken.  Thanks to my mom for telling me to cook it this way.  I have referred several of my friends to this recipe and will continue to do so!  Thanks, Marian for a GREAT recipe!

Great recipe. I subbed half the sugar with brown sugar and used light soy sauce to reduce the sodium, and left everything else the same. I cut the chicken leftovers into bite-sized pieces and served it over rice the next day. I think we liked this even better.

Update:  An alternative to baking, and heating the kitchen is to mix the sauce ingredients and set aside without cooking. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and sauté in a large skillet in a small amount of oil. When chicken is done, pour sauce over meat and simmer until sauce thickens. Serve over rice.

I read the reviews before making and ended up tripling the recipe. I only used 6 chicken thighs and had about a 1/4 cup of the sauce left over after all the basting. I would give the taste a 5, but had to rate it overall 4 stars just because all the basting every 10 mins and the horrible sticky black mess it left in the pan. Although, I would def make this again and use foil to line my pan first.

This was really yummy. I have three kids and usually one won't like whatever the dish is but everyone gobbled this up. I made the sauce exactly but I used 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts. I cubed them up an poured the sauce over the cubes in a container with a lid and shook it up. Put them in the greased pan and cooked for 15 minutes then stirred up and cooked for another 15 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes. Served with jasmine rice and steamed stir fry veggies. This is definately a keeper.

The teriyaki sauce is really excellent.  I used fresh grated ginger and a little extra garlic, and half brown sugar.  I used boneless thighs and boneless breasts (doubled the sauce and used half to start with), cooked at 375 covered in foil for 30 minutes, then flipped, added more sauce, and cooked 30 more minutes at 375 uncovered.  I turned on the broiler for about five minutes at the end.  Adults and kids alike thought this turned out AWESOME.  Thanks!

I used 6 boneless skinless chicken breast halves each cut into thirds.  I dumped them into the sauce pan with the teriyaki sauce before placing them on the pan (covered with aluminum foil).  Then I dumped the remaining sauce over them.  I turned them over at 15 minutes.  They were done at 30 minutes.  Super good and very easy.  Will use again.

I have been using a recipe very similar to this for years on chicken wings.  They go over GREAT at parties, etc.  I do not baste the chicken pieces, though.  I pour all the sauce over them and occasionally turn the pieces while they are baking.  One hour does the trick but, prepared this way, you can bake longer and the sauce really sticks and caramelizes.  Yum!

Wonderful stuff here. Doubled the teriyaki sauce, used boneless skinless chicken breasts and just poured the teriyaki sauce directly onto the chicken in a large lined glass pan. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes then turned over and baked for another 20 minutes. Great flavor & the chicken was so tender. Definite keeper. Thanks!

Very easy and good. Made these adjustments: doubled sauce recipe, used white wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar (b/c I didn't have it), used almost 4 lbs. chicken breasts cut in half, baked at 350 and up to 375 near end for almost 1 hour, did NOT simmer sauce before baking and did not cover while baking and it turned out the perfect glazy consistency. I did baste often, which is necessary - really creates a great glaze. Definitely use less sugar - my 4 year old thought it was too sweet! - It didn't taste bad at all, but my preference would be less sugar. Great recipe overall.

I did not care for the cider vinegar. I would also cut out the white sugar and use brown, leave out the pepper as well, and instead add a smidge of cinnamon. (Trust me, it's delicious).

Great!  Will line the pan next time.  I doubled the sauce and it was too much.  I also used low sodium soy sauce and that worked just fine.  We don't eat dark meat, so I used boneless skinless tenderloins and they were done in 30 minutes.  It really would be great on a bone in chicken cut though. I used low sodium soy sauce too since we need to watch our salt intake.
EDIT: Now that I have had a chance to eat a whole plate, OMG this is GOOD!  We serve it over chicken flavored rice.  I don't even like Chinese food that much and I love this.

Excellent. We all loved this. Hubby and kids all agreed that this should be made often. We have a large dinner here every Sunday for the entire family and hubs suggested that this be remembered for one of those huge, special meals. That is fine with me, as this is soooo easy and absolutely delicious. I doubled the sauce, used BLSL chicken breasts, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, rice vinegar instead of cider and grated fresh ginger in place of the ground. Perfect. Thanks for sharing!!

As other reviewers have suggested, this is a tasty and easy to prepare chicken recipe. I halved the recipe for 8 deboned chicken thighs (there was plenty of sauce), and substituted fresh for the ground ginger (1 tsp of fresh for the halved recipe). Even without reading the reviews, I cooked the chicken for 1/2 hour turning at 15 minutes and basting at 10 minute intervals - but figure the recipe initially was for boned thighs. Great recipe and a super sauce that can be used for other meats.

I didn't read the reviews first as I normally do, I made it as is and I only buy low sodium soy sauce so that's what I used.  My husband and I both loved it and thought it would be great for wings.  We also think it would be great for the grill.  I think incorporating pineapple would be good in this recipe.  I'll pass this recipe on and I thank you for sharing!

I made this tonight and it smelled delicious but when we went to eat it...another story. One out of four of us actually finished supper. The rest of us found something else to eat. Way to sweet and had a strange taste...could not put my finger on it. Sorry.

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, as we all thought it tasted exactly like bottled teriyaki sauce. It seems like alot of people are using chicken breasts instead of the thighs, so of course you would have to reduce the cooking time and/or temp. I couldn't fathom cooking chicken breasts at 425 so I reduced to 375. I doubled the sauce as recommended, but it was kind of a waste as I personally wouldn't pour bottled teriyaki sauce over rice so this was the same. I am glad I followed the advice of other reviewers and used lite soy sauce, this recipe calls for alot (1/2 cup!) so it definitely would be salty with regular. For those of you who mentioned the black on the bottom of the pan, it is because of the high heat. There were also people mentioning that the sauce is on the thinner side, well, it is, but if you cook at a high temp for that long it thickens because it is almost starting to burn, I would recommend instead if you want a thicker sauce to add a little more cornstarch, then you can cook at a reduced temp. Our chicken was not dry but I did watch my time, just cooked until they were done (used meat thermometer). It isn't the best smelling sauce either, because it contains cider vinegar (which on it's own smells like stinky feet!) I guess if you really like bottled teriyaki sauce, then you'll really like this recipe, for us, it was not worth the effort. Sorry to lower the rating, but I won't be making this again.

My husband is a HUGE fan of teriyaki, so to impress him was going to be a real challenge.....until I found this recipe.
Ever since I've made this teriyaki, he tells everyone he'd eat mushrooms if they were dipped in this sauce (he HATES mushrooms).
I probably make this at least 6 ot 7 times a month-it's a true "regular" in our home.
I just throw all ingredients into a pot, boil until it thickens, pour all of it over chicken breasts, then bake COVERED at 375 for 30 minutes.

I then cut up the chicken and serve over a bed of rice pilaf-don't forget to save the juices!
My husband's favorite thing is the extra sauce for dip :)

This recipe was DELICIOUS! Way better than the store bought sauces...those I'll never buy again-especially since this is sooo easy to make! I used chicken breasts and halfed the sugar. Superb served over steaming white rice and stir fried veggies.

Agree with most! Yummy. Used white meat. Had to add more cornstarch to thicken sauce up a bit (very good idea to double recipe!). Had snow peas and rice with it, sprinkled sesame seeds on top! Very pretty, light and tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

This is such an easy recipe.  People think you spent hours preparing this dish.  Very flavorful.  One suggestion, line your casserole dish with foil, it makes the clean up so much easier.

I didn't brush on the sauce, I just poured it over and let it go. It's my favorite Teriyaki sauce ever.  I have put it on chicken, pork, and rice with veggie stir fry and it goes great with all of it. Thanks!

Very Yummy!  I have a recipe I use equivalent in taste...in my opinion that is much easier and doesn't require all the basting.  Equal parts of honey, soy sauce, and BBQ sauce.  Pour over chicken bake for an hour.  Still this recipe was very tasty!  My husband and children loved it with rice.  YUM  Thank you!

My husband LOVED this recipe. I did use boneless skinless breasts instead of the thighs. I cooked on 400 for 35 minutes as recommended by another reviewer and they were so tender and juicy! I will be making this again soon!!!

This recipe turned out great!  I  doubled the teriyaki sauce but only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I purchased bone-in chicken thighs with skin  because they were less expensive and took the skin off. I marinated  the chicken overnight.  I cooked it at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes with foil covering the pan.   This made it more like hawaiian style shoyu chicken.  It was so juicy and almost fell off the bone. Next time I will try to cook it covered with foil for the first half and remove the foil for the second half.

Sauce was delish. Used 3 thighs and 3 legs with the same amount of sauce. Did take about 1 1/2 hours baking time till chicken was done, but well worth the extra time.

Two things for sure, and I just made this. It is a 5 star receipt for both the Teriyaki Sauce and the chicken. I did not make this until I read some of the reviews, and I definatly agree that if the sauce volume is not doubled, it needs to be increased by about 50%. Kinda funny, out of coincedence a friend droped by my house and told me that he had the best "chicken" he had ever had for lunch, so I gave him a couple of peices (bone in), and he came ungluded shouting "how'ed you do that?!!". I explained that I found it on All Receipts. I am a 61 yr old male and was a Regional Manager for Faultless Starch/Bon-Ami, and I have loved to cook since around 1980.
  Wonder, can I freeze the leftover sauce? No more friends tasting this at this time, because what is left, is for me.

First time making this recipe tonight and it will most definitely be a staple in our household! Teriyaki chicken has always been a favorite in our house, but store bought marinates just cant compare to this homemade mix. They key was definitely to have the patience to let the sauce thicken up.The directions stated to allow an hour for prep, but if you have everything layer out, it only takes about 30 minutes from the time you get it all in the pan, til it finally bubbles and thickens.  I poured a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of the pan & continued to baste/brush the sauce over the chicken throughout the baking process. I also turned the breasts over several times to really soak up the juices and added chucks of pineapple about 1/2 way through so that they too could take up the flavor of the sauce. AMAZING flavor!!! Yummy!  :)

YUM!  I love finding a recipe that I know I will use over and over again, and this is one!  I didn't have fresh garlic on hand so I substituted 1/8 tsp. garlic powder for the clove.  I wanted a sticky chicken and this recipe was right on.   My only other change was to bake at 375.  It was sticky and juicy.  Thank you Marian Collins for sharing!

Really flavorful chicken!  I made the sauce in the morning (used half the sugar and brown instead of white sugar) and marinated the chicken all day long.  I BBQ'd it since it was such a nice night.  Once the cold hits i'll be making this in the oven like the recipe states.  Served it with "Mushroom Rice" and "Broccoli with Garlic Butter and Cashews" from allrecipes.com

I made this for our family and my kids LOVED it! My 6 year old threw a fit because it was all gone & she wanted more!  I had to make it twice in one week it was so good & EASY!  I did cut down on the sugar the second time around. Definitely a "keeper" for us!

Delicious, tender, perfect chicken! We loved the flavor of this dish! I used skinless-boneless chicken thighs & baked at 400 deg for 35 minutes (brushed every 10 min as instructed). No other changes were necessary for us. There was plenty of the yummy sauce to go around & no leftovers when it was all said and done. Will definitely be making this one again. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

This recipe was really tasty. I used brown sugar instead of the white. I marinated the chicken for about 1.5 hours and then dumped everything into a foil lined pan to cook at 375 for 30 minutes. Turned the temperature up to 400 for the last 20 minutes (also flipped them over). I think next time I'll use Lite Soy Sauce as it was quite salty.

Turns out great every time.  I've also tried this in the crockpot.  Just put in the chicken and sauce and turn on high for 3-4 hours.  Easy and delicious!  Thanks!

I have used this recipe over and over. Our family loves it! I've used it with chicken and beef. When using beef I cut it into smaller pieces and bake as suggested and 5-7 minutes before the beef is done I add in wedges of onion and green bell pepper. I cover the veggies with the sauce and cook until just a little tender. I pair this with plain white rice for a simple, yet delicious dinner!

This was simple and has potential but was WAY over cooked!  450 degrees for an hour on skinless breasts didn't sound right but nobody else said anything in their reviews so I did it.  Next time I'll only cook it for 1/2 hour

I followed the recipe exactly and even used low sodium soy sauce and this still came out way way way too salty.  Will definitely not be making this one again.

YUM. I have used the sauce on steak as well as chicken thighs and oh so good. I've also subbed truvia for sugar and it was just as good, better for you too. To make with chicken thighs, I didn't baste that often, I just turned them over partway through... laziness. Also, I read reviews that advised doubling the recipe. But that was unnecessary for me. In my baking dish (foil lined of course) I ended up with so much extra sauce, and that's with the chicken pretty heavily coated. I also halved the recipe once to use on 2 smallish steaks - half for marinade and half for basting. Marinating wasn't really that effective, probably I didn't tenderize the meat enough... I am not so good with steak... but on chicken I will definitely make this over and over. Cheap and good to impress people with. Great with rice and pretty much any vegetables.

This recipe was so easy and yet it turned out to be better than restaurant quality!  I'm so pleased.

Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Doubled the sauce, as everyone else mentioned.  Used 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar.

Lined dish with foil and cooking spray.  Put 1/2 of sauce on to the chicken, covered with foil, and cooked at 375 for 30 minutes.

Took out of oven, turned pieces over, drained some of the extra liquid, and added rest of sauce.  Baked, uncovered, at 350 for 20 minutes.

Chicken was so moist and tender, it was falling apart!  Will definitely make again!

This was absolutely delicious! I will say it was a bit on the salty side, but that was mainly my own doing because I seasoned the chicken before I put the marinade on. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and doubled the sauce. I poured half the sauce over the chicken and then put in the oven for 30 minutes covered in foil. I then took it out, flipped the chicken and poured the rest of the marinade over the chicken, returning it to the oven this time uncovered, for an additional 30 minutes. It was falling apart! And it was so delicious!

I can't believe how good and easy this dish is!! I doubled the recipe for the sauce otherwise I would've had enough. We love ginger and garlic so I added about 8 cloves of fresh garlic ( smashed and minced ) and 2tbsp of ginger paste. I also did 1/2 cup white and brown sugar.  I spooned part of the mixture over the chicken, turned the meat over and spooned more on the chicken. Covered with foil and baked at 425 for 30 min, then uncovered the dish and spooned the rest of the sauce all over the chicken and put back in the oven for an additional 10 min.  It was perfect!!!

This is wonderful! It is even better the next day! I plan to cook this in the oven Sat. night and then reheat it in the crock pot while we are at church on Sunday morning. We have also tried it with chicken tenders and the marinate gets even deeper into the meat. Our family loves this chicken!

Simply wonderful! I made this without any changes the first time through and it was just fine. Then I made it with doubling the sauce, and putting it all together, covered - this resulted in the sauce getting too thin. So I made it again - doubling the sauce, increasing the cornstarch to 4 Tablespoons, adding 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes for zippiness, covered it for half the time, and left it uncovered for the other half of the time. I also turned each piece during the 2nd half of the cooking time to get a nice teriyaki coating on it. Served it each time with coconut rice, and there aren't any leftover to be had! Thanks for the recipe - it is a keeper!

This was a really good dish. Having moved from Hawaii I'm really picky about teriyaki and usually don't like anything without a marinating process involved. However, this was, hands down, the best teriyaki sauce recipe with chicken I have ever tasted. I've passed it along! Thank you.

I didn't think this teriyaki sauce recipe was all it was hyped up to be. I halfed the sugar like most of the reviews said and my asuce ending up tasting like vinegar. I think you need all of the sugar, possible using brown sugar for the rest. Probably won't make again.

AWESOME!! Used arrowroot starch in place of the cornstarch and used a low sodium soy sauce.  I thought this was a perfect dinner over jasmine rice with some roasted broccoli that I put in the oven at the same time as the chicken.  I used a stoneware pan in the oven that I lined with parchment paper and cleanup was a breeze.  A super easy and fast dinner!!

This was a Very good base for me to start with, I do not do refined sugars and eat Raw or organic, so I did change a couple of things, I used 1/4 cup of brown Sugar, and some natural raw Honey and it was great! I also doubled it. but it was great just the same.

Yum.  This recipe is very similar to the one I use for wings.  I use honey and only about half the amount of the sugar.  White wine instead of vinegar. My husband is not a big van of pepper so I use dry mustard for pizzaz.  Also, the sesame seeds are a great addition and I sometimes cook them on my indoor grill.

I didn't give this five stars, because I made some changes. Similar to other reviewers, I doubled the sauce (but I had alot left over). I added two tsp of sesame oil and some red pepper flakes. I used low sodium soy sauce and rice vinegar. But, if Marian had not posted this great recipe in the first place, I would have never had the chance to tweak it and enjoy it. We loved the flavor of the sauce - just like a Korean restaurant we used to patronize. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and used 2 garlic cloves instead of one.  Very Very Sweet but Very Very Good :) Oh and I only used 4 chicken thighs since I was cooking for one.  Leftovers for lunch tomorrow :)

This was awesome and I made it in my slow cooker!  I slow cooked the chicken (5 large chicken breasts in plain old water) on high for 5 hours and made the teriyaki sauce (which I tripled so that the chicken would be saucy).  I drained off the water and shredded my chicken, poured the sauce over the chicken and turned to 'warm' setting for the rest of the day.  I served it over steamed jasmine rice.  It was very good and I love that I was able to make this in the slow cooker!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite teriyaki chicken recipe. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said, and it was great. The second time I reduced the sugar, added extra garlic, and added a half teaspoon of chili powder. It was the perfect kick to balance out the sweetness, and my fiance liked it much more the second time. I always have this sauce in a bottle in my fridge- I make a quadruple batch a couple times a month. I chop up boneless chicken breasts and mix with the sauce in a bowl. Then I let it marinate for about a half hour, or even overnight for a quick dinner the next day. I heat a little oil in a frying pan then cook the chicken and sauce until the chicken is done. It's fabulous poured over rice!

Very good!  I made using white vinegar because that was all I had.  I also used 5 thighs and 2 legs for chicken, leaving the skin on.  This was a hit and I will make it again.

I doubled the sauce and used only four thighs.  It was plenty of sauce but half of it would probably not be enough.  I used refrigerated minced garlic and ginger.  When I make it again, I would use more ginger and possibly some red pepper flakes.  I put foil on the pan for the first 30 minutes.  Hubby loved it!

Crazy good for how easy this is.  I didn't have any cider vinegar so I used half distilled white and half malt vinegar.  Yum!  I poured the sauce over 2 hindquarters in a glass baking dish and set in the oven at 350 for an hour.  I basted a couple times during baking.

Best chicken recipe I have tried on here. I use about 2tablespoons less sugar than the recipe calls for. I bake the chicken in my dutchen oven covered and then uncover it for the last 10 min to allow the sauce to carmelize. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I made modifications as I went: I prepped as directed but added 2 tbls. of brown sugar and 1/2 cup pineapple juice to give it a sweeter, less soy-sauce taste. To keep the chicken REALLY moist and tender, I waited to thicken my sauce until the end, which allowed the sauce to completely soak through the meat while basting and baking. I did like some others cooking for the first 15 minutes at 400 degrees F then lowering to 350 and cooking 25 minutes longer. After that, I removed the chicken from the oven, set the temperature to BROIL, sliced up my boneless skinless chicken thighs, basted with my newly thickened sauce, and popped in the broiling oven for 5 minutes. After these little tweaks, my chicken wast SO moist, sliced and super flavored like in a teriyaki bowl at a restaurant, and perfectly sweet, not salty.

So so good!  Even better grilled.  One night I didn't have soy sauce...I had already started the sauce so I used Worcester instead.  Turned out great, but not really teriyaki-ish.  Sauce seems to take forever to thicken, but I learned that it will thicken up the rest of the way as it cooks on the meat.

This sauce is so great, but I add the juice from a 15 oz can of pineapple tidbits or rings. Then I have enough sauce to flavor some brown or white rice. Yum!

This was very good! I doubled the sauce. I recommend using lite soy sauce. As another user suggested, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar. This was very authentic teryiaki and next time I will try it on charbroiled chicken.

It was mouthwatering.  I poured the sauce all onto the chicken(bone-in thigh) and covered in foil (used a disposable foil pan).  Baked for 90 minutes and broiled uncovered for 5 minutes.  There was enough sauce to add to the steamed rice for a great meal.  I substituted flour for the cornstarch.  May add a little more next time for a thicker sauce.

WOW!, I WAS MAKING TERIYAKI STRIP STEAKS & REALIZED I DIDN'T HAVE ANY JARS OF SAUCE. I JUST MADE YOUR SUPER EASY SAUCE WHICH ACTUALLY WAS QUIKER, EASIER, AND TASTIER THAN ME RUNNING DOWN TO THE STORE FOR A JAR!!! I WASN'T GONNA COMMENT SINCE I DIDN'T MAKE THE CHICKEN, BUT THE SAUCE ALONE WAS AWESOME! I WILL USE OVER & OVER. THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT WAS ADD SOME HONEY, GREEN ONIONS, & SESAMEE SEEDS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING!

I used chicken breasts with ribs and this was GREAT!  One very important piece of advice for anyone making this recipe: Put aluminum foil on the bottom of the pan that you use to bake this in.  It will make your life much easier when it comes to clean up.

This was excellent.  I used 9 boneless, skinless thighs in a pan lined with non-stick foil - no mess to clean up!  I used low-sodium soy sauce and half brown & half white sugar.  I also poured the sauce over the thighs & baked till done.  The sauce does thin out due to the chicken juices, but that was OK for me.  We poured the sauce over rice.  My husband, who doesn't like garlic, said he really liked it.  I probably will never buy teriyaki sauce at the store again; this is just too easy & good.

Very good.  Timing in oven @ 30 mins per side may need to be reduced (bake 30 mins, then check and turn pcs.  Will find they may only need another 15 or 20 mins to avoid overcooking and drying out.  Need to brush more mixture may not be necessary as the sauce spreads out from initial coating, but the check will avoid over cooking.

Great sauce.  I didn't bake my chicken though - live in Vancouver, B.C. with a climate that allows me to barbeque 365 days a year. I did double the recipe as noted by another reviewer.   I made up the sauce, marinaded the chicken in the fridge for a couple of hours then grilled the chicken, basting with some sauce.  I kept some sauce seperate and served it over rice.  It was a hit with my company that night.  I LOVE teriyaki sauce and will use this one again and again!  Thanks Marian!

This is a great recipe.  I used thighs and drumsticks and baked it at 325 degrees for a couple hours.  The meat fell off the bone and it was very delicious.  I will definitely be making this again!

The taste was great but the chicken thighs turned out overdone and tough. I would cook at a lower temp. As others have stated, it might help to leave the skin on and/or cover with foil. Warning: Even though I greased the pan as the recipe calls for the sauce made a burned mess in the bottom of my glass pan and smoked up my kitchen (at 425 deg). It was not fun to clean up. The sauce takes a long time to thicken (20 min over low). I will not be making again. To much work for the everyday kind of meal that it is.

This was the best recipe I have come across for chicken.  My picky husband even LOVED it.  I substituted 3 things when I prepared it.  I used 4 chicken breasts, used 2 cloves of garlic instead of one, and also used fresh minced ginger root instead of ground ginger.  It tasted like something from a chinese restaurant.  Next time I am going to use the sauce as a marinade and try it on the grill.

Decided to write a second revies, my first was written in 2001 and said "Very good!! I used foil in the pan for quick clean-up, and I baked at 375 instead of what it said. The thighs came out moist, perfectly done, and delicious. I cut a bit of the soy, was afraid it might be too salty. Served over noodles."  Still stands true...I forgot about my temp. change, used pieces of breasts and over did them at longer than 30 minutes! oops! The sauce is still perfect though (i add extra garlic).

Boy was the baking tray hard to clean. Also! it tasted alright except the entire procedure wasn't enough to get the chicken to really absorb much of the flavor. I suggest marinating the chicken first before baking.

We love this recipe. It's great and very kid friendly…well for my picky eaters. However, I do use chicken breast and cut it into bite size pieces. After I bake it with about half the sauce I drain the extra juices and coat the chicken pieces with the rest of the sauce and bake it until the sauce is warm and nice and stuck on the chicken, usually 5-10 minutes. We love this dish for baseball games in the spring. We use the plastic cups and put rice in the bottom of the cup and top it off with the chicken. The kids always come looking for seconds and it gives my pitcher a chance to grab a bite during down time.

I made this sauce for the first time tonight.  My family is trying to lose weight, and we're eating a lot of chicken and fish.  I made a few modifications so that I can stay within the parameters of the diet.  I substituted Sugar in the Raw for the white sugar, and I substituted 2 tbsp of almond/coconut milk for the cornstarch.  Instead of letting it simmer, I allowed it to come to a boil and then cook down to thicken.  Just make sure to keep stirring and keep an eye on it, because I almost cooked it down to nothing. Finally, I used this as a stir fry sauce instead of for baking the chicken.  It was excellent and better than any teriyaki sauce that I ever bought off the shelf.  You must try this recipe!

Very good flavor.  I like a lot of extra sauce to be able to use for rice, etc., so I tripled the sauce.  It definitely was not too much.  I used half brown sugar for the sugar and went just a little light on the sugar, cutting it by maybe 10%,  because of the other reviews (and am glad I did.)  I also used low-sodium soy sauce because of the crazy amount of sodium in the regular, and it was still salty enough and quite flavorful.  

I used breasts and flattened them a bit in a ziploc (to keep the juices from splattering everywhere) because I don't like a thick piece of chicken. I just adjusted the cooking time a bit shorter due to using breasts and due to flattening them. 

You really don't have to keep basting them.  With the sauce I made, basting didn't make any difference; it was staying on fine anyway.  

I did however cover the pan with foil for the first half of each side baking.  In other words, for the time period before turning the breasts over, I had the pan covered half of that time; and for the time period after turning the breast over (halfway through cooking), I had the pan covered for half of that time.  Covering it for the first half helped keep it very juicy; while uncovering it for the second gave it a nice and barely crusty glaze.

This was sooooo good! It was for sure too salty, so the second time I made some plain white rice to go with it, and it "washed" some salty flavor away. I also did it in a frying pan (with chicken breast cut into pieces) colored the chunks, then took them out and used the pan to make a sauce and put the chunks back in to finish cooking... delicious!

Best barbeque type chicken i have ever made, nice crispy skin when you use chicken thighs with the skin on them. Easy to make as well.

Def. double the sauce so you can marinade prior to cooking. 3-6 hours is sufficient, otherwise, it doesn't soak in to chicken. Use some honey or molasses to make it a glaze, and sticky! yumma!

I love the recipe but I would suggest three alterations that take it over the top. First replace the white sugar with brown, replace soy sauce with low sodium soy sauce and finally add a dash of sesame oil.

Awesome!!!  I did what some of the other viewers recommended. I doubled the sauce, used brown sugar instead of white sugar, ginger powder instead of fresh ginger and garlic in a jar.  I also used lite soy sauce and organic apple cider vinegar. Used boneless chicken breast instead of thighs. I layered a roasting pan with foil place the chicken in it then poured half of the sauce over it. Baked in the oven covered for 30 minutes. Took foil off basted chicken again  then cooked for 40 minutes uncovered. The chicken was very moist and tasty. I will definitely make this again. -Tiny

Did this with 4 chicken breasts at 350 degrees 20 min. covered, 20 min. uncovered and it turned out great!. As a side dish I combined 2 cups brown rice, 2 fried eggs, 1 cup peas, 1 cup broccoli slaw, 1 tsp. siracha and the sauce from my pan of chicken after it got done baking (talk about bang for your your buck!) My hubby couldn't stop raving about it!!!! Awesome

This is a good basic recipe.  Like others, I made changes based on personal preference and taste.  I used a Japanese soy sauce that is lower in sodium.  Baking takes a lot out of garlic, so I initially put 4 cloves in the doubled sauce recipe.  Once the sauce was heated and reduced, I put in a couple more.  I also reduced the amount of cider vinegar and replaced the amount with Sake, something I never leave out of any Asian sauces.

Very yummy recipe.  First, I doubled the sauce like a few others suggested.  I had ran out of ground ginger after only 1/4 tsp.  Luckily, I had some fresh ginger on had and just minced it to make up the difference.  I only used 4 chicken breast (large breasts) then sliced them into strips.  After my sauce started to bubble, I turned the temp to simmer and put the chicken strips into the sauce itself.  I then let the chicken cook like that.  Not only did it lessen the cooking time by making them into strips, it also allowed the sauce to flavor the chicken all the way through instead of just being brushed on top.  The chicken and sauce were placed on top of hot white sticky rice with a side of veggies.  Will make again and maybe will try the way the recipe calls for, I was just pressed for time so changed things up.

AMAZING! So good! I can't believe how moist the chicken turned out, although I did NOT bake it at 425 for an hour+....That's just crazy! I baked it at 375 for about 40 minutes or so. Poke fork holes in the chicken and you will not believe the amount of flavor in every bite! Will DEF make again!

My modified recipe: I used 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup white. I baked 8 skinned thighs at 425 for 40 minutes ( the thighs were still partially frozen- very cold). I poured 3/4 of sauce on thighs and baked for 25 minutes then poured remaining sauce on and baked for the last 15 minutes. I did not baste. I cut the meat from the bone in slices and served with white rice. It was delicious, everybody ( including my 5 kids) liked it! I would double the recipe if I was making more thighs, but for 8, the recipe yielded the correct amount of sauce.

Great teriyaki sauce recipe. I've used in baking salmon and for stir-frying veg, both with great result. I used fresh ginger and lots of it, substituted the cider vinegar with Japanese cooking rice vinegar called "mirin" - more subtle than cider vinegar,  I reduced the sugar to taste, and used light soy sauce. Really and super easy and versatile.

Delicious! I used chicken breasts, and decreased the temperature to 375, and baked until they reached 155F, about 35 -40 minutes, basting frequently.

I cut way back on the soy sauce and still found it to be too salty.  The sauce in smaller amounts would be fine but as a sauce for an entire chicken breast, it's just too overpowering.

I liked the flavor, I would recommend putting a lot of the sauce on the chicken to enhance the flavor. I also recommend lining your pan with foil, otherwise huge huge mess.

This was tasty and an sauce to put together. I used pieces of chicken breast, which turned out well. Next time I will divide the sauce after cooking (I made this in the microwave), so that we can use some of the sauce over rice and not have to dump out sauce that was brushed on raw chicken. The family liked it and says I can make this anytime.

I made this with the restaurant style fried rice recipe and it was a hit! We ate it two nights in a row! The kids cleaned their plate and asked for seconds! The only thing I changed was I pre-seaoned the chicken and when the sauce was done I poured the entire thing over the chicken, covered with foil and baked 35-40min as described by other reviewer. Extremely tender and delicious! The only thing I would recommend is to be sure to let the sauce get thick as it is simmering as it sticks to the chicken better. I didn't let it get as thick the second night but it was still delicious! Definitely a keeper!

DELICIOUS!! i have made this COUNTLESS times. its the near perfect easy and delicious dinner when you dont have lots of time, or the will to make a complicated dinner. even a 12 yr old can make this. very easy and delicious! like others, i used brown sugar instead of white, extra fresh minced garlic and fresh garlic, and rice vinegar b/c i didnt have cider vinegar. after rinsing my chicken wings, i patted and squeezed extra dry, dry,dry with a paper towel. i baked at 375, the first 25 mins covered with foil (the foil is the part that makes it so delicious), then the last 15 mins uncovered. theres no point in basting it every 10 minutes- waste of time. when i take off the cover after 25 minutes i just spread the sauce around and turn the chicken pieces over. Delish!! end result is so juicy and smooth and fragrant! i could go on about this easy chicken recipe forever!

Yum!  Like some others, I reduced the sugar a little and increased the ginger and just baked the thighs in the sauce instead of basting.  I found that an hour leads to overcooked meat, but since I used bone-in thighs, they were still ok.  The sauce is quite salty, but with some brown rice it was fine.  This could be a regular.

Followed recipe exactly as written. I wish I would have done some of the substitutions others made. This was not good to me or my boyfriend. I don't know if it was that there was too much ginger or if it was the white sugar vs brown sugar. But, I did not like this one AT ALL. Sorry, but I will not be making this one again.

EASY recipe for Teriyaki sauce using ingredients I had at home.  Substituted brown sugar for white and added red pepper flakes as other reviewers suggested.  Marinated boneless, skinless chicken thighs in about 3/4 of Teriyaki sauce for 2 hours.  As the chicken was baking, I marinated it with rest of sauce as in directions.  Total cooking time about 40-45 minutes.

This is so good.  I served it to company before even giving it the ususal (try before putting it on the guests menu).  Everyone gave it a 5 even my very fussy hubby.  Thanks for a great recipe Marian.

I use a lot of bottled teriyaki sauce when grilling.  Never even once thought of making my own.  I came across this recipe and tried it.  Not only was it simple, but the flavor is out of this world.  Nothing you can buy in a bottle.  I've been using this recipe for quite awhile now and will never buy a teriyaki sauce again.  This is perfect, easy, and I always get compliments and requests for the recipe whenever I serve it up.

Fantastic.  Better than any other I've had.  The only change I made was to do half white/half brown sugar--perfect sweetness.  I made three chicken breasts--if you make more than that, double the sauce.  UPDATE--the teriyaki sauce is so darn good we also use it for stir-fry--brown rice and whatever vegetables we have on hand.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!

Husband and child loved it... but not on rice.  I made it with almost the full amount of sugar.  I'll cut it down next time.  Where we live, restaurants often add green onion cut up in the sauce.  It's really good, so I'll try that next time as well.

WAY too sweet and way too much soy sauce flavor.  even with the alterations that some people recommended, I won't make this again.  I'd rather start from scratch with a different base recipe.  Sorry.

Excellent Recipe for teriyaki sauce.  I would tone-down the pepper next time and I did not use any added water like the recipe calls for.  The color, thickness and flavor was perfect!!

The flavor was good other than being a bit salty even after using low-sodium soy sauce.  I made it with boneless, skinless thighs.  I doubled the amount of sauce but reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup for that amount and added 1/4 dark brown sugar. Freshly grated ginger replaced ground.  As per the "Most Helpful" review, I covered the pan with foil for the first 30 minutes and held back about 1/3 of the sauce for basting.  Upon uncovering the chicken after the initial baking period,  the chicken was swimming in liquid and the center pieces were not evenly cooked.  I repositioined those pieces along the perimeter, covered it again & baked for another 10 minutes.  At that point, I uncovered the chicken and baked for another 10 minutes.  The appearance of the chicken was nothing like the sample photo but more of a braised appearance - not what I was hoping to achieve from the photos.  I decided to grill the thighs and baste them with the remaining sauce.  I would recommend grilling rather than baking if at all possible with this recipe.

This is a definite go to recipe on those days when chicken is for dinner but you aren't sure what to do with it. I've been making this for about a year. Made it just like the recipe states and it was wonderful. Life got busier so I modified now for time. I use lite soy sauce like most and boneless skinless breasts since no one in my house likes dark meat. I add all ingredients to a saucepan then when done, just dump it all over the top of the chicken. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes or so. Uncover and spoon the sauce over the top and finish baking uncovered another 20 minutes or until done. Works great in a slow cooker too!

I would easily give this 4-1/2 stars!  I followed the recipe with the following changes - I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and 1 tsp fresh grated ginger in place of the ground ginger. Everything else was as stated in the recipe.   I did add 1 big squeeze of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - we like it spicy!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and cooked them at 375 for 40 minutes basting every 10-15 minutes.  After 40 minutes I basted them one last time and broiled them for 3-4 minutes to get a carmelized top.  Yummy!  Definitely will be adding this to my recipe box!

Prepared this while dressing for church yesterday.  Delicious easy lunch with brown rice and broccoli/cauliflower mix. Liked because: 1. Easy to prepare 2. Simple ingredients and not too many of those. 3.Taste yummy.  My favorite kind of recipe since I have been cooking almost 50 years, I don't want  to work too hard. lol  I always try to follow a recipe the first time as written after reading the reviews.   If I don't have all the ingredients, I go to the grocery and get them. Pet peeve: people who leave out or change half of the ingredients and then say how bad it was! I did use wht/Splenda brn sugar, 1 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh. Cooked at 375, covered for 30 min., turned the meat and uncovered and cooked for about 15 min. more.  The sauce was like a thick pancake syrup, which I really liked. Will try chicken breasts and maybe add a little crushed pineapple to the sauce next time.

Ive used this recipe so many times now that I could probably make it in my sleep. I started making it my first year on my own in college when I was living off pasta and those huge bags of frozen chicken breasts from Costco. I needed new ways to use it up, and this was perfect. Everyone I've made it for gobbles it up. Quick, easy, and delish.

OMG! I made this last night for my family and it was a hit! My changes...I doubled the glaze to begin with (you can always freeze any leftover). I used seasoned rice vinegar since I was out of apple cider vinegar. I also used brown sugar per other reviews, the change made sense to me with the combined flavors. I substituted lite soy to cut down on the sodium (a must). Also, I added a can of crushed pineapple. If you add the pineapple, cut back on the sugar. I had chicken breasts on hand and threw in some chicken legs for the kids (all skins removed). ***MAKE SURE you line your pan with aluminum foil! I'm still scrubbing my stovetop with oven cleaner because of spattered glaze. I can only imagine having to clean an entire pan! I served with steamed rice and broccoli for sides. Better than any restaurants at a fraction of the cost. Thanks for the recipe... SO easy and delicious!!! :)

We made the sauce as written and it was really good!  When we tasted it before cooking with it, we thought it was going to be too strong.  But once it has cooked with the chicken, the flavor mellows out a bit and is so good.  I think this will become our "go to" sauce!  Like other reviewers said, double the sauce.  We cooked only five chicken breasts and there wasn't any left over (dipped the chicken in, then used it to baste as they cooked on the bbq).  Next time I think I'll try adding in sauteed onions as well.

Quite nice but I didn't double the sauce, so didn't have enough to baste during cooking. I cooked at a lower temp as well. The flavour didn't really come through as much as I expected and it was starting to dry out.

The family loved this recipe.  I didn't have garlic; used 1 tsp garlic powder.   Drained the chicken mid-bake to let the sauce thicken, probably because of the saline solution that is added to frozen tenderloins.  Served with rice pilaf and green salad.  Excellent taste.

I've made this with boneless skinless thighs and with bone-in skin on thighs.  It was much better with the boneless skinless thighs.  The flavor of the teriyaki went into the meat much better.  All in all, a good, simple, and easy recipe.

I have to give this recipe 5 stars! It is very rare to have my kids begging for seconds. I will be sure to wrap my baking dish in foil the next time I make this. The baked on sauce was a pain to clean up. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! I usually marinade veggies to go with it.  By the way, make the marinade, put it on the chicken and throw it in the freezer.  It makes for a great, easy meal.

Really nice recipe, got rave reviews from family. I used chicken breast cut in halve and also substituted fresh ginger and rice wine vinnegar. I basted the chicken lightly and baked for 10 min on 400, flipped and baked for another 10 mins. Then added the entire sauce to the pan and baked for remaining 10 min....just until sauce bubbles and thickens.
Top with toasted sesame seeds.

The only thing different I did was cooked it on about 375 and I didn’t brush it every 10 min.   I put the entire sauce in the dish, let it marinade for a few hours then just turned and brushed the chicken 3 times in an hour.  The last few minuets of cooking time, I put it on broil to get the glazed effect on the chicken ~Turned out perfect!!
I made an extra batch of just the sauce then sautéed and stirred in an onion, green, red and yellow peppers and served it over rice.  Perfect meal as is, no side dish needed.  Will make again.

Great sauce. Husband thought it needed more sugar and I have no idea how much he added (dumping straight from the sugar bowl) and it was still great. It made alot of sauce for the two of us and I used only half the prepared sauce, but we didn't use a lot of chicken. Served with rice and drizzled with extra sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband also liked the combination of flavors. I did cut back on the soy a little because I prefer to use light soy, but our local grocery store doesn't carry it all the time. :D  My husband likes anything teriyaki and asked me to "make this again sometime." Since that doesn't happen often I am pleased.

This is some of the best chicken ever. I poured all the sauce over the chicken, covered with foil and cooked for 1 1/2 hours at 350. Then I removed the foil and cooked for another 30 minutes. It takes longer but the sauce doubles and can be used over rice. The chicken is tender and juicy. I took it to a church potluck and it was gone in minutes. Even my picky pre-schooler likes it.

I actually was looking for a simple teriyaki recipe for chicken stir-fry and found this one.  I made the sauce as suggested but with sliced chicken breasts and stir-fry veggies in a wok --it turned out great.  Thanks!

The flavour of this dish was okay, but it wasn't outstanding. I used drumsticks which were moist. I lined a pan with foil and covered with foil for the first 30 mins. The problem was that I expected the sauce to be coated on thicker leaving a sticky saucy coating. The juices from the chicken turned the sauce very watery so that it could not adhere to the chicken meat. They hardly looked cooked because of their pale, milky colour. I'd recommend using this marinade over a grill or where the chicken will not sit in its own juices.

I made this for my family and they loved it! i sprinkled toasted sesame seeds on the chicken before serving it and served steamed broccoli, brown rice, and snow peas sauteed with evoo and pepper.  I also doubled the sauce to use on the rice and veggies as suggested.  It was delicious!

This is a great teriyaki recipe and has become a staple in our house.  I substitute lemon juice for the cider vinegar, as I don't like the "bite" of vinegar.

This could be on the menu at a fancy restaurant. My wife REALLY liked it. I made this without any changes and it was great. I did use low sodium soy sauce. An IMPORTANT TIP would be to line the baking dish with foil before baking!!! It's almost imposible to clean if you don't. I made a side dish of snow peas and mushrooms (also from this site) and used the same teriyaki sauce that I made for the chicken. I also made some white rice and put the chicken on top. It made a great Chinese meal!

I think it's the apple cider vinegar that makes this dish fabulous!  It's the best chicken teriyaki I've ever made.  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic! I used 3 chicken breasts and halved the sauce recipe. Next time, I am going to doubled the sauce and stir fry veggies in it while the chicken is baking and serve it all over rice. Very oriental tasting and my husband loved it, too! I'm definately making this incredibly easy and oh so tasty recipe again!

Wow a very tasty meal. I did follow one poster's advice and lined the pan with tin foil and used it for a top as well. Served with stir fried vegetables and rice it was a big hit in our house. I did use boneless/skinless chicken breast for my chicken. A true keeper in every sense of the word.

My family loved this--and it was so easy!  Instead of baking it, I dumped everthing into a slow-cooker and cooked it on high for about 4 hours.  I served it with rice and broccoli--a great meal!

I have made this a couple of times and really enjoy the flavor. I use boneless chicken breast which cook on 400 in about 20-25 minutes. I also highly recommend lining the pan with foil and spraying that. Also don't skip the first step. I tried it the first time without thickening the sauce and it is not nearly as good. I usually thicken on the stovetop as directed but add a little more cornstarch. I also prefer using brown sugar to white. It gives it a richer flavor. Basted often and served with a slice of baked pineapple over brown rice and steamed broccoli on the side. Yummy!

This was really great.  I followed the recommendations for one of the reviewers that used 4 skinless/boneless.  I used an 8x8 pan lined with renolds release tin foil (so I wouldn't have a messy pan to clean).  I added some chopped green onion, pineapple slices, water chesnuts, and slices of an orange bell pepper.  I baked it at 400 for 25 minutes and raised the temp to 425 for the last 10 to get the glaze to thicken and stick to the chicken breasts.  I also basted every 10 mins as suggested.  I served it over white rice with steamed sugar snap peas and carrots.  This one is a keeper and I plan on making it when my mother-in-law visits next week.

Yum!! I used 5 chkn brsts cut into large chunks, boiled the sauce on the stovetop and poured it over the chicken in the pan. Baked at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. I definitely recommend lining the pan with foil...much easier clean-up! Will definitely make it again!

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I of course added more garlic :) and cut down on the sugar, and this was excellent teriyaki sauce.  Add steamed broccoli with the dish and this is a great dinner.

My family loved this recipe!  The teriyaki sauce was very simple to make and it was better than store-bought sauces.  I usually have all these ingredients in my house so I will make this often!  I took the advice of lining the pan with foil and I'm glad I did!  Definitely a sauce to use with other meats.  Thanks!

This one is amazing! I doubled the garlic in orig. recipe & chicken was out of this world. Then I doubled (4 garlic) the recipe again & used it on pork ribs. WOW!!!  This is a great sauce. Not salty at all.

YUMMY!  This is a terrific recipe which needs no modification to taste GREAT!  I served this with a rice casserole (soya-sauce based), carrots and a green salad with Japanese dressing from Jean Pare's "Weekend Cooking" cookbook.  It was a hit!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tweak this recipe a bit to be more like the teriyaki chicken you find in restaurants.  I like to use boneless skinless thighs and slice them into bite size strips, then saute them in a bit of olive oil.  Pour the sauce over the top and simmer until the chicken is supertender and shreds easily with a fork.  The sauce gets a little bit watery this way, so once your chicken is cooked, remove it from the pan and bring the sauce to a rapid boil to rethicken.  You can also add a little more cornstarch mixed in with water to help thicken the sauce.  Stir in a splash of vinegar at the end to make the sauce tangy again.  Serve over jasmine rice with steamed broccoli.  YUM!!

I've made this several times and its a winner every time.  I use boneless skinless chicken breast and cut them into bite-sized pieces and bake until carmelized, always has a nice gravy.  Recently took it for a work potluck.  No leftovers and one coworker went for thirds.

Excellent dish! I would follow as others stated and line the dish with foil before baking, and next time I would double the sauce to use over rice. I think it was a very tasty dish and I will definately make this again. Thanks Marian!

AWESOME teriyaki sauce!  To reiterate the other reviews, line your baking pan with foil because the sugar in the sauce will make a mess.  This sauce will probably be great on other meats.

Great teriyaki sauce! I used boneless chicken breasts and baked at 350 for 50 min-- came out too dry. Probably 30-40 min would be right.

I LOVED IT! This is one that I will share.
I followed the recipe step by step and the only thing I would change is decreasing the amount of baking time to 50 mins. 
Can't wait to make it again.

Yummy to my tummy.  I just about love anything "teriyaki" and this recipes was easy and delicious.  I didn't have any thighs so I used boneless tenderloins instead.  I didn't bother with the basting and just poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it accordingly.  I served this with steamed broccoli and cauliflower over rice.  Thanks Marian.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I made twice already and added some changes thanks to everyone's reviews!  I doubled up the sauce and poured all over chicken, covered with foil and halfway through turned chicken once. I used a mixture of thighs and drumsticks(left the skin on)in a 9x13 pan at 325 degrees for two hours.  The sauce needs to be thickened a little more, maybe by adding more cornstarch?  Overall, very tasty and so juicy!

This is the best teriyaki chicken I have ever made. I topped each piece with a pineapple ring and served it over wild rice with a salad on the side.  Thank you Marian for such a great recipe.

The recipe is almost exactly like my mom's game hen sauce.  Living in Japan for several years my mom learned how to cook using their favorites.  I must admit it tastes SO much better when brushed on a buttered game hen while cooking then using the sauce to dip the bites of chicken, so tasty!

Bravo!!  This was moist and tender with a wonderful flavor.  I was too lazy to skin the thighs.  I baked it at 375 for 1 hour and 425 for 15 minutes.  The result was fork tender chicken and perfectly carmelized skin.  I have never been impressed with a teriyaki chicken recipe until this one.  Thanks.

Love this recipe! I make it almost weekly it's that good. Served with rice and broccoli. I follow the recipe as-is. I don't feel it needs to.be doubled or altered. I use 2-3 lbs boneless breasts to ensure leftovers for the next day.

Was worried the sauce proportions would not yield enough to cover the chicken, but it worked out great.

I made the sauce as the recipe states and let it cool for a bit and put the chicken thighs in a big ziplock bag with the sauce and let it marinate for 24 hours in the fridge. Preheated the oven to 425 the next night poured the chicken and sauce in my stoneware baking dish and baked for an hour!! Turned out delicious!! My 13,9,4,3 year olds ate it up like it was going out of style!!! Yay, finally found a family-friendly recipe!!

Made this last night! Bomb.com! Doubled ingredients and used half sugar half brown sugar. Made it in my ninja crock pot. Used about 12 chicken legs and wings. Low sodium soy sauce... 475 until the last 15mins turned down to 200. Really good will make again!

This is a great recipe - got kudos from all the family, young and old.  I did follow the suggestion from another user and poured the sauce over the chicken (boneless, skinless thighs) and baked it that way.  Turned out very well.  Also, following another suggestion, fully lined the pan with foil for easy clean up. This one's a definite keeper!

I followed the temperature and time instructions, but ended up with burnt chicken teriyaki. The glaze is what burnt. I did get one thing right,  I lined the pan with foil so cleanup was easy. I recommend reducing the temperature.

This recipe is going to my favorite dinners list. The sauce which I doubled was perfect for us. I also stir fried green and orange peppers, square onions, water chestnuts, fresh pineapple and baby bok choy. It seemed to me the pineapple really brought the veggies together. I also served Basmati steamed rice. The only thing I changed was I browned the chicken thighs first.

I have tried this a few times as stated.  It's very good, however i have now used the sauce for marinade on steaks and chicken with great reviews. I currently have a portion in my fridge for use with chicken tenders. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and simple to prepare for high impact! The sauce was perfect, didn't change a thing. The amount of the sauce was just enough for 8 chicken thighs. I browned the chicken thighs in a dutch oven with a little olive oil, then transfered the browned thighs to a greased  glass 9 x 13 pan. I cooked the teriyaki chicken  covered with foil at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes, basting every 15 minutes. I used the dutch oven to make fried rice. This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent teriyaki sauce! Super easy, basic kitchen staples - used fresh ginger instead of minced, heavy on the garlic. I doubled the sauce, took previous reviewers recommendation - not doubling the sugar, used 1/4 cup brown & 1/2 cup white sugar - fantastic. I set aside about 1 cup of sauce (to use with our steak tonight) & baked the chicken in the oven as directed. Super easy & super delicious.

What an intense and delicious terriaki sauce this is. We really enjoyed it. I followed recipe and cooked exactly as instructed. Worried a bit about an hour at 425, but the basting and the high heat gave the chicken a wonderful carmelized texture. Yummers! Can't wait to make it again. Hubs said don't lose that recipe! I like the review about adding some pinapple and veggies near the end, I may try that some time.

Loved this one! Definitely double it though.  For the first time I followed the directions, other than doubling and using low-sodium soy sauce, and it was great.  By brushing with the sauce every 10 minutes the flavor really got into the meat.  Next time I will probably experiment with it a bit. I thought a few pepper flakes might make it more like General Tsao's which my family loves! It's a great sauce to experiment with, a definite keeper!

Absolutely wonferful! You definitely need to double the sauce, but it tasted great. Also, next time i am going to use foil to make the cleanup easier, it makes a black sticky mess that is really hard to clean

This turned out really good.  Based on other reviews I also used brown sugar and cut the amount in half.  I used boneless, skinless thighs so it didn't need the full hour but I did turn them a couple of times.  Will be making this again!

This was great. Maybe just a tish less vinager and used all brown sugar.Everyone loves it!  Thanks for sharing.
Made this again and doubled the sauce. I used light brown sugar, 1/2 cup water and followed another reviewer's suggestion used 1/2 the sauce to bake. poured out juices at the half way mark then added the rest of the sauce and added 8 oz can pineapple chunks. Also I cooked 400 and that thickens the sauce. this is delish. Served with rice and steamed broccoli yum!

Amazing!  I didn't change a thing and it was the best teriyaki sauce I've ever had. Even my husband, "the chef" loved it.  He said there's no need to buy bottled teriyaki sauce anymore with a recipe like this one. It's true. Plus, it was also fairly easy. I managed it myself in a small apartment with three young kids running around and I'm no chef.

This was SO good!! I absolutely loved it! My husband loves chicken teriyaki and this recipe did NOT disappoint! I only made 4 boneless thighs and jasmine rice to put it on and the amount of sauce was PERFECT! Thanks so much for posting this! I will definitely be making it again.

I had two people try this sauce and both said it was the best teriyaki sauce they have ever had.  I had apple cider vinegar so i used that instead and it was great!  I've made this twice so far, once with chicken and again with pork chops!

Great recipe. 1st time I did it, I followed everything but it was ok. The sauce was a little to much. 
2nd time I made it, I added a lot of garlic, added more water, a little more ginger, did half white/half brown sugar, shorten the cider vinegar, add more cornstarch since I did it in a crockpot.  I followed someone else review & added pineapple chunks & poured in almost half of the juice from it (the last hour).  I cooked on high I think about 6 hrs. Soooooo tender & delicious. My kids was asking for more.
By the way, I used a big pack of chicken thighs with bone & triple the sauce mix to cover it in crockpot.

Holy heck, this is fantabulous. I doubled the sauce and then doubled the garlic again. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, low-sodium soy sauce and added a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes for a little heat. BF said this was one of the best things I've ever made. Definitely making it again!

Delish...disappeared!  I did double the sauce as others recommended, but don't think that was really necessary.  Used low sodium soy sauce and glad I did.  Used half brown/half white sugar.  Poured the sauce right over the thighs and turned every 15 minutes, cooked at 400 for an hour...perfect!

This chicken is excellent.  I've tried making it at 350 degrees instead of the 425 called for.  Don't do it.  The high heat is essential for caramelizing the sauce onto the chicken.  I've also questioned the amount of sauce used, because it just barely covers the chicken.  Don't do that either.  The chicken juices render out and make good basting liquid, and the amount of sauce ends up being perfect.  No extras for rice, though, but I made fried rice and didn't need it.  The chicken ends up incredibly juicy and the outside turns a pretty dark brown color.  Will make again and again.

I used chicken breasts and only had low sodium soy sauce; everything else I followed exactly and although the chicken was very juicy, the flavor of the teriyaki was terrible and was too salty. I did not care for this at all. I gave it two stars cuz the kids and hubby did finish what was on their plate but we all agreed not to make this again.

This is an excellent recipe! The first try was awesome. The second time around, I doubled the sauce. I added a bit less sugar and supplemented with honey. 

Also, the oven temp is better IMO around 375/400 degrees, less burning that way. Use a pan that the chicken fits snugly in so the sauce can't spread out and burn.

A definite favorite in my house! Oh, and PS: My picky 2 year old loves it!

Great recipe! V easy to do and very delicious! I served with white rice and broccoli (thanks to the photo!) and my husband, 4-yr old son, and guests were very impressed; they were just disappointed that there wasn't more!

I only had 6 chicken thighs to serve 4 adults and 1 child, and 12 would have been better, as per the recipe. The sauce was delicious and for me there was plenty of it. 

Will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!  I don't care much for bottled teriyaki sauce because they're always so overpowering.  This sauce is JUST RIGHT.  The ONLY revision I made to the original recipe is, instead of a half-cup of sugar, I cut the amount down to a quarter-cup.  Five stars!

Oh, I so loved this recipe! Made no modification, and it turned out just so wonderful!! I was really appreciative that I could make the Teriyaki Sauce from the scratch.  This one was not too rich or too sweet to me.  I don't like the store-bought Teriyaki Sauce in general as they tend to be too sweet, too rich, or simply missing something.  I didn't need to wrap with the foil, with 30 min each side along with every 10 min brushing of the teriyaki sauce did a great job, it was moist and tender when they came out from the oven. The top side of chicken was very well looked like the typical teriyaki chicken with thickened teriyaki sauce on top, and the other side of the chicken was moist, as the juice from the chicken was about 1/3 of the baking dish and kept the another side well moist, so this side, the sauce was a bit thinner looking, but the sauce was already well absorbed in the chicken, so no downside as to the taste.  This recipe will be definitely part of my routine dinner meals :)

Tried this recipe once and it was a hit with my husband! I made a few changes by doubling the sauce, low sodium soy sauce, 3/4c white sugar, used white wine vinegar(b/c that's what i had), 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in half(making them thinner) and 4 gloves of garlic. Placed them in the oven with the sauce brushed on the top and bottom at 350 degrees conven bake for 45 minutes. I basted 2 times (once mid way through and once more at the end. The chicken came out sooo moist and tender! I gave it 4 stars because the juices from the chicken made the sauce thin again. I will remove that text time in mid bake. Still was really good.

This is a great foundation for a recipe. I used about 2.5 lbs. of cut up chicken breast, and used fresh ginger and garlic. Poured on top, baked for about 30 min., although next time I will do about 45, we were just really hungry. Other than, no changes.

My family just flipped over this amazing sauce!  I will never buy store bought again .  I have made it several times with slight variations.....a little more ginger one time when severing it with turkey, a bit more garlic when having it with pork....things like that.  each and every time it turned out great!
This is a perfect base recipe to experiment with for different dishes and different tastes.

My husband said this one's a keeper - we both loved it. The only things I did differently were cutting the sugar (by less than half, but I'll cut it even more next time, and maybe even substitute brown sugar or honey) and cooking it the way I always bake chicken - 375 degrees uncovered for 1 hour, then 15 minutes at 400. During the last 15 mins. I roasted chopped broccoli which I had poured some of the extra sauce over. Then mixed the broccoli with brown rice. Dinner was delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly, but doubled the amount of everything for the sauce and used breasts instead of thighs.  So, so good.  Put about half of the sauce on the chicken, baked for 10 minutes, then drizzled some more on, baked for 10 more minutes, added a bit more and left them in the oven til they were done.  Had some sauce left over.  My husband said it was the best thing I've ever made...and I had to agree. :)

This was truly wonderful! I did add half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it a bit of a kick, as we like our teriyaki spicy. I followed the advice of another member who just poured all the sauce over the chicken, but next time I will baste it because once the water and fat came out of the chicken, the sauce was watery (though still tasty). Very, very nice! Will definitely make this often.

This is a delicious recipe. I was worried because I am not a vinegar fan, but all the ingredients just work together for a tasty wonderfulness. I did make a few changes to make it fit our lifestyle better: I doubled the recipe and used low sodium soy sauce, (8) boneless-skinless chicken thighs, 2 rounded tablespoons of cornstarch, 1/2 cup of Splenda granules, and 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar blend. It did not taste weird from the sugar substitutes at all. It was simply delicious! We also like spicy, so I rounded the ginger and black pepper spoonfuls. I could definitely pick out the ginger taste, but the pepper only gave it a hint of spiciness without making it taste peppery. This is going to be a new "go to" recipe in our household!

Definately a "keeper"!  I used boneless skinless breasts and some of the tips from other postings.  My family LOVED it!  My son complained the entire time I was cooking that he didn't like it and wasn't going to eat it. (even though I'd never made it before and he'd never ate it before..)  He ate the WHOLE thing!  THE WHOLE THING and liked it!  You just don't know what a HUGE deal that is! Will definately be making this again!

I liked the vinegar idea really spiked the flavor. The dark meat of the chicken is  so moist hard to use breast portions. I did use it two ways, I used the sauce as an overnight marinade, then baking pieces in the sauce at 350 for 40 mins. I then put the chicken on a broiler pan and broiled until done and crispy. The original is very good, mine is too.

Loved this recipe. Just for personal preference I squeezed in a little fresh Orange juice and added some red pepper flakes to add a little spice. Following the advice of others I used the lite soy sauce.  Will definately make this again.

This sauce is excellent.  I used low-sodium soy sauce, used raw honey instead of the sugar, and added more garlic.  Baked at 425 as instructed, in a foil lined pan, brushing with sauce at 15 min, at 30 min when I flipped them over, and again at 45 min. So good.

Excellent!  It was delicious and so easy to make.  I had been looking for a recipe like this for so long.  My husband was quite pleased and even suggested a stir fry with the same sauce.

This is FANTASTIC.  I doubled the marinade, used brown sugar instead of white sugar, used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar and did 8 boneless chicken breasts instead of 12 thighs.  I marinated the chicken breasts all day long (10 hours) and then grilled them on a charcoal grill.  I can't tell you how DELICIOUS it was!  Big hit with our guests.  Served with chinese fried rice (also from this website) and green salad.

I did this exactly as is the first time with chicken, and the sauce was excellent on the baked  chicken! So easy to make, and absolutely delicious! My boyfriend hates sauces, but he loved this. I also used the sauce on pork chops tonight, and they were amazing. Great recipe!

Wonderful flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used six chicken breasts in a 9x13 dish.  I dumped the sauce over the top and flipped half way through instead of basting.

Excellent teriyaki recipe. I did modify a bit due to a special diet, but I did stay true to the original. Changes were agave in place of sugar and coconut amines in place of soy sauce. Delicious!

My husband loved this recipe and so did I, It made the house smell so good! I Just did 3 super large chicken breasts l and shoved them in a 8X8 (lined with foil), used half the sauce and only flipped them once and when I did I dumped the rest of the sauce over them.  I did the oven at 400 degrees for 35 minutes as suggested but another review. Came out really moist. Will make again!

Love this recipe! I substituted chicken breast  and sauteed in the skillet. I also added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies I found at my local grocery store. I'm not much of a cook and this recipe was easy and delicious.

This turned out so much better then anticipated. I needed to make something for my family for dinner and I was out of ideas. I saw this, it seemed simple and fast so I went with it and was glad I did. I used chicken breasts and doubled the sauce as well. I also covered with foil for the 1st half of cooking.. it helped make the chicken super tender. Overall this was a winner for us and will become a regular in our house.

Easy to prepare, very moist chicken. Love this recipe.
Added some canned crushed pineapple for added flavor and served with rice and broccoli on the side but any green vegetable should work with this dish. Thanks for sharing this recipe. My family liked this dish.

Followed all the advice in Valerie's Kitchen's comments and it turned out SUPER yummy. My husband loved it and made sure I knew about it. :) I'm a vegetarian and HAD to try it. Delightful. Will absolutely make this again.

Really Good Teriyaki Chicken. I didn't change the fundamental recipe much, but I did add some things.  First I doubled the sauce as others suggested.  I used low sodium soy and fresh garlic and ginger - I added some hot red pepper flakes to the sauce to add a little kick. I covered the chicken with foil for the first 30 minutes and again for the last 5 minutues because I used skinless, bone-in legs and thighs; even though I basted them, I didn't want them to dry out. I served with regular long cook rice and stir-fried brocolli, carrots and pea pods.  I added a bit of teriyake to the veggies thinned with a little white wine and chicken broth.  It was all really awesome and went together well. Thanks for the great recipe Marian!

This chicken was great, especially the sauce.  I did double it as others suggested so that we had extra to spoon over brown rice.  I also used low sodium soy sauce and I'm glad I did or it would have been too salty.  I used part brown and part white sugar, and cut it down to 3/4 cup for a double batch of sauce.  I used fresh ginger and quite a bit more garlic (we are garlic lovers!).

It's very good!  My chicken was kind of dry, but it was my fault.  I used chicken breast cut into  pieces, so it didn't require so much time in the oven.  I baked for 40 min, total, and it was too much!! Still, we enjoyed it.

I made it just as the recipe reads and found it to be just ok.....Way too salty for me, which could be corrected with lite soy sauce.

Turned out less sweet than I expected, but that was a good thing. I believe next time I will use chicken breasts, as my family are not fans of dark meat, plus the thighs I bought were fatty even after trimming. Overall, a quick and easy yummy sauce that could be used on any meat.

The best teriyaki recipe! Not super sweet and not inundated with ginger. I would recommend covering the pan with foil because the teriyaki sauce does burn while it cooks. Will use this recipe for shrimp and steak next time.

Amazing....In error, I used skin on chicken thighs, but, no matter, they were delicious.  I did not cook at 425, I cooked at 350 for 45 minutes in my oven on convection, and I also poured the sauce over the chicken (used 8 chicken thighs), and as others recommended, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar...... Yummy.

Really good recipe.  Make sure the thighs don"t touch and they will carmelize better and won't be so wet.

I used the sauce to make teriyaki turkey tenderloins.  Instead of baking, I took advantage of the nice day and grilled the meat instead, basting with every turn.  Very good sauce that the whole family liked.  Thank you for sharing.

Picky husband loved it!! Like most people I did do some changing... my husband can taste any type of vinegar from a mile away so I left that out. I doubled the sauce and so glad I did! I used skinless, boneless breasts and lined my baking pan with foil, laid the chicken on that, covered with sauce and then baked till done. I served with rice and steamed veggies. This will be in the monthly rotation - and this would be a great sauce to use for a lot of dishes.

Edit - I now make this sauce every month to keep on hand. I double it, cook it up and put it in a jar. My family eats a lot of stir fry and rice throughout the month and they love this sauce. Keeping some in the fridge makes it easy to use whenever anyone wants some Terriyaki sauce. Much better than store bought!!

I made only the teriyaki sauce and then used it on salmon.  This was a winner!  I won't ever buy sauce again.  One recipe was perfect for a pound of salmon.  I did half the sugar and use brown instead of white as other reviewers had suggested.  In the future I'll play with using less soy sauce in an effort to lower the sodium content.

Not that you need another 5 star review  but I have to tell you, I get so tired of the "usual" with chicken and find myself going back to this recipe more and more.  Entire family loves it, GKs now ask for it. Have shared it with just about everyone I know.  This eliminates any stress of what to do with thawed out chicken thighs.  You are my hero!

This is THE best recipe for chicken thighs EVER!  I made this for company and they raved about it and asked when I'd be making it again!  I tend to like things on the sweet side so I did add more sugar, mostly Splenda, and mixed it with some brown sugar because I thought the vinegar was too "bitey" and strong.  I also lined the pan with foil and I didn't cover it while baking which help carmelize the sauce.  It was DELICIOUS and my husband already asked when I'll be making it again!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

We LOVED this.  I changed the sauce just a little because I had some leftover from a dish I made the day before.  So mine had some honey and Worcestershire and brown sugar in it.  But even my picky son ate it.

I think this is great how it is. Sometimes i add pineapple tidbits with their juice and omit the water. Often I even make the sauce in an oven proof dish (no cooking at this point), place the chicken in to marinate then throw the whole thing in the oven at 375 for 40 minutes. It's great EVERY time.

i used chix legs boneless w/ minimal skin that was easy to trim. i actually did not double for sauce; there was plenty!
i didnt baste throughout cooking. 25 mins foil covered then 15 min uncov at 375 ,,
when the chix was done, the sauce wasnot glazy or thick. 
the meat was just a sheer tan color.
but the sauce was delicious!!!
i also used brown sugar (w/a splash of white sugar) but used a whole garlic clove ..
by the way, i "calculated" the recipe for servings of 3 (just me & my hubby)
so if youre expecting a thick dark molasses type glaze burnt on your chix, it wont happen.
but, this dish was DELICIOUS & i will make it again!

I found this recipe to be a really solid healthy meal and I fed 5 people for under $10.00.  I served the chicken over brown rice and held some of the sauce back to put on top of the chicken and rice.  As several people recommended, I doubled the sauce and I used lite soy, 1/2 cup white suger and 1/4 cup brown sugar (1/4 cup less suger than called for).  I baked it for 50 minutes on 375 and basted every ten minutes.  It came out great.

I gave this recipe to my husband to make, and he disregarded my instructions that "skinless" did not mean "boneless". He used 2 skinless boneless thighs and 6 chicken tenders  The oven temperature was much too high, and the finished thighs were much too sweet and dried out.  One hour in a 450 degree oven annihilated the chicken tenders. Only the thighs were barely edible. He warned me that he follows recipes without making any adjustments.

The family liked the "glaze".  I used boneless breasts, since no one but me likes thighs.  I could have baked it a little less or cut the temp to do the full hour of baking time.  But, everyone said it was a "Keeper".  So, we'll do it again in a couple of weeks.

i`m sure it`s scrumptious on chicken too.

I have made this several times with both boneless and bone-in breasts and thighs. The sauce is tasty, but you could add more garlic if you are a fiend. Frequent basting gives the chicken a nice saucy glaze. I think I'll try this on some party wings next time, and I hope to try it on a pork tenderloin.

I definitely changed it up a bit with chicken breasts--- AMAZING... i hate eating boring chicken all the time, and I took this and instead of cornstarch, used self-rising flour, i used white distilled vinegar, and took 2 thick chicken breasts, cut them in half to shorten cooking time, so it was 4 breasts in a dish, covered the chicken with the sauce (which was still a little watery) and put it in the oven without covering it for 30 minutes!! It soaked into the chicken AND thickened up so the chicken was amazingly tasty and i took the rest of the sauce and pour it over some brown rice!! OMG SO GOOD!!

It's a keeper.  Everyone loved it!  This will be a definite "go-to" recipe for the future.  Only thing I did differently was use brown sugar rather than regular sugar.  I also added some Texas Pete to rev it up.  Delicious!

We loved the sauce it was excellent! I doubled it however, and used about a 1/4 c less sugar. IF YOU DONT WANT A MESSY STICKY RESIDUE ON YOUR BAKING PAN I SUGGEST USING ALM. FOIL!! :) ENJOY

This is really good.  I served it over brown rice.  It is very WW friendly too.  The only improvement would be a pinch of red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  Can't wait to make it again.

Wonderful!  I hate it when people rate things when they don't make it 'exactly' as written, but I did make a couple changes.  I doubled the sauce like many had suggested, did 1/2 brn sugar, 1/2 white..then i threw them in the crock pot all day, only using 1/2 the sauce. When they were done I put the rest of the sauce over it, then stuck them in the oven to warm for a short amount of time.  Everyone raved. Will make them again, for sure!

Very, very good! I used Splenda instead of sugar. Great teriyaki sauce!

Easy.  I followed suggestions such as lining the pan with aluminum foil (the sauce still leaked through but it wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been) and cooked it at a lower temp.

Flavor was great but my chicken was dry.  Used sliced chicken breasts.  And used 1/4 c White Sugar and 1/4 c Brown Sugar.  I lined my pan with foil for easy cleanup.  Covered with foil for first 30 minutes at 375 degrees, then removed foil and reduced heat to 350 degrees and cooked another 30 minutes.  The whole time brushing with sauce.  Would like to try the sauce with salmon.
Made this a second time with no changes and loved it!  So increased my stars from 3 to 4!

This was against the law good! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used brown sugar instead of white. Also I made extra sauce and marinated the chicken overnight in a large storge bag. I also used the foil lining trick and made clean up a breeze. This recipe works great on other proteins. Its da bomb!

I've tried numerous teriyaki sauce recipes and this is the BEST, by far.  Just make sure that it simmers long enough to thicken - don't be too anxious to take it off the stove or it may turn out to be runny.

AMAZING! So easy! I followed a previous review and just put the sauce on top of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked at 425 for 35 minutes and it turned out perfect! It was great with brown rice and broccoli. Will definitely do this one again.

My 13 yr.old twins ate 3/4 of the entire pan (I used skinless boneless thighs) before I got home and raved about it.  Awesome and easy. I also doubled the sauce, used fresh grated ginger and used brown sugar, substituting 1/2 with Splenda brown sugar.  I will only 1 1/2 times the sauce next time.

The marinade melted all over the bottom of the pan during cooking and caused a burnt mess. There was hardley any marinade left on the chicken.  I brushed on the remaining marinade right before serving, but the flavor was still really really bland.  Not like teriyaki at all.  Will not make again.

Have made this several times and every time my son says it's the best meal ever! The last time I made it I exchanged honey for the sugar and it came out great too.  We also like the sauce over rice.

I made this for dinner last night and the family really liked it. It was simple to make and so darn good. I doubled the sauce and added cut onion and bell peppers to put over rice. Great to have a new recipe to add to dinner menu.

AWESOME!  This was a hit with all family memebers.  I left out the mushrooms because we don't like them and left out the chives because they looked really old when I went to use - yikes!  I will certainly make this part of our rotation.

This chicken is very easy to prepare and is always a hit whenever I make it. I always line my pan/dish with foil before baking because the teriyaki sauce bakes into a hard, crusty mess that is very difficult to clean.

Incredible! After reading the reviews, I figured I'd need more sauce, so I made about 1.5 times what the recipe called for. Turned out to be the perfect amount. I thought the flavour of the sauce was perfect, probably the best teriyaki I've had. Mine were done in about 35 minutes at 400 degrees.

We live in Germany now and I guess this recipe is something to write home about because that is just what my husband did and he called it "heavenly."  I followed the recipe exactly except that I only had four thighs so I didn't need to make extra sauce.  I served it with fried rice loaded with Wok veggies and there was enough sauce for us to drizzle over our rice as we ate it.  This really was great and has gone into my recipe book so I can share with family and friends.  Thanks!

Very good baked chicken recipe.  Instead of brushing the Teriyaki sauce on, I poured it into a medium bowl and dipped the chicken in; then marinated it over night.  I also had to substitute brown sugar, because I was out of the white kind. Served it with peas and rice.  Overall, it turned out very well and will make again in the future.

Yummy! Everybody liked it. And sooo cheap! We fed 11 people for under $15 and made extra for lunch the next day, but that was all eaten up too! I bought about 9 pounds of chicken from Costco, and this was the perfect recipe to help use it all up.

This is quite tasty though I would not call it teriyaki chicken since authentic teriyaki sauce does not call for vinegar which has a pronounced taste in this recipe. I made this the easy way following others who cooked the chicken in the sauce.  Next time I will try basting it which I think should come out equally good.

This was a really excellent recipe.  I tried the method another user mentioned, baking the chicken in the sauce, but the sauce just mostly burned on the pan.  I made another batch of sauce to serve with the chicken and it was so good.  I will try the recipe as written last time.  Sometimes it doesn't pay to take short cuts!

This was absolutely to die for. Did everything exactly as described in the recipe. I only aded 2 minced gloves of garlic to the sauce. This couldn't be easier. So yummy. Make sure to line the pan with aluminum foil so even clean up is a breeze. Mhhh mhhh good!

Well what can I say...other than delicious! I did not split the sugar as people have mentioned however I will try this next time.  For fellow UK readers of this 'cornstarch = cornflour'.  5 stars Marion on this one!!  Next time will do my best to find boneless and skinless thighs!  Highly recommend foiling the pan, saves a lot of mess.

I gather others' review, marinated my bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces overnight and lined pan with foil before baking. I reduced amount of sugar, soy sauce and cider vinegar (roughly by 1 tbsp each) to suit personal taste, and increased the lack amount with water instead. Meanwhile, I doubled the amount of ginger and garlic (to make it spicier) and baked at 425 degree for 1 hour (1/2 hour covered and remaining ½ hour uncovered). Chicken DID NOT stick to foil like others and they taste GOOD… very much oriental-style…tender, juicy and yummy! Thank you for this quick and easy recipe.

This recipe was simple and delish. I took another reviewers advice and put aluminum foil on my 8x8 baking dish to make cleanup much easier. I used boneless chicken and just poured all of the sauce on top and turned chicken once while cooking. Served this on top of brown rice with broccoli on the side and ate every bite!

I made this last night with chicken thighs... SO GOOD! I know it's not authentic grilled teri"yaki", so, should I call it teri-baked chicken?? Anyways, it was delicious with jasmine rice and some steamed veggies... Will definitely cook again.

What a great recipe! The chicken came out perfect, a bit like the Chinese BBQ pork, and was super tender and juicy. THe taste was great and it beats the teriyaki chicken I've had in restaurants!

I loved this recipe!  Easy to prepare with every day ingredients.  I split the recipe in 1/2 for my family of 3 and it turned out perfectly.  As other reviewers suggested, I only need to cook the thighs for 45 minutes and lined my pan with foil.  Clean up was a breeze.  A keeper for sure.

I have made this many times.  It turns out great every time, everyone loves it.  I doule the sauce, put the leftovers in the freezer to use in stir fry combined with House of Tsang's  spicy szechuan sauce.

This was excellent, nice and moist and very flavorful.  I really liked the sauce, although I did use brown sugar instead of white. Another little change: used 6 boneless, skinless breast and baked at 400' for 40 minutes covered with foil.  Then at 350' for 10 minutes, uncovered.  I found that the sauce was enough and the au jus from the chicken roasting was great to spoon over the rice.  Thanks!

Delicious! A new spin on the everyday chicken dinner dish. I used 4 breasts in place of the 12 thighs, but kept the amount of the marinade the same. I also reserved half of the sauce for dipping purposes! Yummy!

Good recipe! I doubled the sauce, marinated the chicken in it overnight in the fridge, then dumped it all in the crock pot in the AM and cooked on low all day. Meat fell off the bone and the chicken had a thick layer gooey, yummy teriyaki sauce from sitting in it all night. The only way this would have been better is if I'd have grilled the chicken first to give it that grilled teriyaki taste, but I didn't have time!

All I can say is, "YUM!"  I took the advice of others and doubled the recipe.  I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and used white wine vinegar (didn't have any cider vinegar on hand).  I also covered the chicken with foil for the first 30 minutes and uncovered it for the last 20-25 minutes of baking. I served it with stir fry veggies and rice.

Easy and delicious! I use 1/2 cup splenda instead of the white sugar to cut some calories and light soy sauce. It does smell very "vinegary" while simmering, but it tastes fabulous! My mother in law raved and asked me for the recipe!! Love it!

Started making this to marinate, and then had an emergency and had to leave.  So I put it all in the crockpot.  4 hours later it was perfect...my daughter's favorite meal is teriyaki chicken, and she said this was the best ever. Gobbled up the juice on white rice.

This was very good chicken! I only had one issue that could be "recipe" and not me, it was a little too salty. I think next time try lite soy sauce and see what happens. I also used whole chicken legs as that's all I had. I should have paid more attention though, cause I didn't take the skin off, and it would've been a lot better without it on so the meat could soak up the sauce. Overall very good. I will make it again with the adujustment of the soy sauce! Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe! Gave the chicken an awesome flavor, so tender! My husband doesn't care for chicken, and normally only takes a bite or 2, but he ate the whole piece this time! I did however use chicken breasts, and it was still fantastic. Be sure to line your pan with foil or you will be throwing it out ;) Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome. I followed the advice of reviewers and doubled the sauce, which ended up being waaaay too much. This was a very tasty dish. I'm looking forward to grilling and serving this at bbq's this summer.

This was good! I found it just in time, too. I'd given up making teriyaki at home because I don't like bottled sauces...too much sugar and sodium. 
This recipes was just what I wanted. I used light soy sauce and used brown sugar instead of white cuz I prefer it. I think I ended up using less sugar than the recipe calls for, but it still tasted great. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I tried chicken breast and chicken thighs and the breast meat was way too dry and hard to swallow.  The thigh meat was juicy and fall-off-the-bone tender. Will definitely make this again.

Used less sugar than called for and topped with toasted sesame seeds. This was proclaimed "the best chicken teriyaki ever", and even a hard-to-please child said it was "YUMMY!". I often use the sauce portion of this recipe for baked salmon too.

Doubled the sauce and used half the sauce as a marinade and let it set for 2 hours in the frig.  Cooked the remaining and brushed as the recipe suggested.  Great flavor through out the meat.  Will definitely use again. Works wonderful on chicken tenders (about 40 min cook time)

I love this sauce!  Store bought sauce is always too pungent and too salty for me, I will never buy bottled teriyaki sauce again.  We usually cut up some chicken breast into bite-size pieces and cook it with some oil until no longer pink and then add the sauce over the chicken.  Cook for a few more minutes to thicken and serve over steamed rice.

10 STARS **********!  Wow, this is absolutely a fantastic recipe for teriyaki chicken.  No one should use bottled sauce when you can make this so easily.  Costco nows sells skinless boneless chicken thighs so I bought a combo pack.  The flavor of the thigh meat with this awesome sauce is to die for.  Save some of the sauce before you start basting your chicken for your veggies.  We were literally dipping our broccoli into the 9X13 pan drippings.  Marian, you have a winner here!

Delish!  I doubled the sauce, cooked and let cool.  After cooling, I lined the bottom of dish with foil. I let 4 chicken breasts sit in the sauce until I was ready for dinner.  Cooked at 375 for 40 mins.  The chicken had a great taste and the sauce in the pan was great over white rice.

This is one great baked chicken recipe! I've been making a variation of this recipe for years,but my old recipe just got replaced by this one:) The sauce was very easy to make...I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar,added a little shot of Teriyaki just bacause I had some,and a few sprinkles of chili powder.I,like some of the other reviewers,did not baste every 10 minutes as the recipe called for. I just covered it and put it in the oven.I baked the thighs @ 375 for 1 hour and they were moist and wonderful.Towards the end, I uncovered the dish,and I did baste it once. I think this sauce would taste great with pork,too. I'll have to try that:)

The flavor was great, but BEWARE!  My pan was ruined completely.  Next time I will be lining the pan with foil.

the only thing i changed was, instead of brushing on sauce every 10 minutes, i just threw the whole saice mixture in teh baking dish with the chicken- also marinated it for 20 minutes prior to cooking. came out great, everyone loved it. i also added broccoli- just washed and threw them in there too. tasted wonderful, felt like i was at a reasturant. family members who dont even like Asian food, loved this teriyaki chicken. (i have been craving it all week now!) will definitlyy be making lots more in teh future!

Wowza! I used thighs with the skin on and seasoned and browned the chicken until golden.  The chicken then went into the sauce to marinate for the day.  We started with skin side down and then flipped and continued to baste. Served this with a Lo Mein recipe from this site.  A wonderful recipe Marian and thank you!

Definitely 5 star worthy.  The sauce was exquisite even though I had to substitute white vinegar for cider.  Served with "Chinese Fried Rice I"  As an after thought I also made another half batch of the sauce to serve with the chicken and rice.  The whole family loved this chicken.  The sauce would also be delicious with pork tenderloin.

Scaled this down to 2 portions and used it as a sauce for tofu, yellow bell pepper and green salad onions. Used fresh ginger, honey and sherry vinegar as that is what we had in. Marinaded the tofu and veg for about half an hour and then stir fried them, added the sauce and voila a lovely meal as good as a bottled sauce.

Covered the dish with foil for the first 30 mins, that helped a lot.  I think it took less than an hour to cook through.  Great tasting sauce.  Used less sodium soy sauce which was a good idea.

I am a novice cook so I am always looking for easy recipes... other than the constant basting, this one was easy and my fiance loved it.  I made no changes to the recipe itself, but I did only cook it for 40 minutes (uncovered) and it turned out great.  Again, I am a novice, so maybe it cooked quickly because I only had 6 chicken thighs instead of the suggested 12 but other reviewers seemed to also reduce the cook time...  Agree with other reviewers too... definitely coat your baking pan with foil... it makes clean up much easier!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and added a little honey to the sauce. IF you use chix breasts too make sure you reduce the baking because breasts cook fast! I baked mine at 375 for about 25 min (flipping them 1/2 way through) i had fairly large chicken breasts which i also pounded.  I doubled the sauce so that I could use the reserve to stir fry with bok choy and frozen stirfry veggies (snow peas, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, carrots etc courtesy of Trader Joes) Served it over brown rice. VERY good.

A moist, tender chicken dish in a thick, flavorful sauce. We loved it and I'll DEFINITELY make it again! I made the recipe exactly as stated, except that I used chicken tenders instead of the bone-in thighs and reduced the baking time to 20 minutes. Any longer and I think the glaze would have begun to caramelize and burn. Next time I'll use reduced-sodium soy sauce, as the teriyaki came out a bit salty for my taste. I served the chicken with baked sweet potatoes on the side; I'd definitely double the sauce if planning to serve it over rice.

Loved it.  I used 3 chicken breasts, which I pounded to about 1/2" thick (pounding always makes chicken breasts MUCH better).  I poured the sauce over the breasts and let it marinate for a couple of hours before popping in the oven.  Mine cooked in about 20 minutes.  Oh - and I also doubled the ginger and garlic...yum!

Definitely a keeper!  I used some other reviewers suggestions: half white/half brown sugar for the sauce; doubled the sauce for extra goodness; used chicken breasts cut into thirds in lieu of thighs (for lower fat content); marinated the chicken in part of the sauce (maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of my doubled batch) for 30 minutes; lined my pyrex dish with foil for easy cleanup.  I didn't bother basting every 10 minutes since the marinade was sufficient coating.  However I did flip my chicken pieces over after 15 minutes and let them cook for another 15. They came out great!  NEXT TIME:  We like thinner pieces of chicken so I plan on thinning the breasts by cutting in half widthwise.  This of course will shorten the cooking time even further.  And in the summertime we can envision grilling the marinated pieces out on the BBQ.  YUM!  Thighs, of course, would be absolutely juicy and super tender.  But you pay for it in the fat :)

I didn't have cider vinegar, so I substituted with regular vinegar but the sauce still tasted great. Next time I'll double the sauce and serve it over rice.

Excellent recipe! Probably my favorite asian dish to cook now that I have perfected the recipe to our taste! I add some pineapple (YUM!!) for the last twenty minutes since we love pineapple in our asian dishes, and use boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs. Also, it is very important to continue brushing the chicken with the sauce every ten minutes, so the flavor can soak into the chicken, otherwise it will be a little bland.

I used Boneless Skinless chicken breasts, baked at 350 and they would have probably been done closer to 30 minutes.  I served over rice and sauteed some green peppers in some of the sauce that was remaining.  Overall, I thought this was a pretty tasty sauce.  Will make again.. just will watch my chicken and remove sooner.  I made the amount of sauce the recipe suggests, but with the 3 chicken breasts I used, AND the amount used for the green peppers, I still didn't use all of this sauce.

Absolutely delicious! I lined the pan with foil and I was so glad I did because clean up was a breeze.   I halved the recipe but made three-quarters of the sauce.  Spooned the rest of the sauce over rice.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and only had to bake for about 40 minutes.
Thanks for the terrific recipe.

This was quite tastey.  I used 4 chicken breasts & they turned out very moist & flavorful & I even had enough sauce left to pour over rice.  I have had better teriyaki when I was in Hawaii but this is very good.  My biggest complaint is that is took me forever to clean out my glass pyrex afterwards.  I would suggest using some parchment paper under the chicken to keep the sugars from burning onto the pan to make cleanup easier.

BismillahirRahmanirRahim -- An hour was a bit much for my oven and I felt the chicken came out overcooked, but I was shocked at how overwhelmingly enthusiastically this recipe was received. People were GUSHING about it. Seriously, the guys were so happy I thought they might start speaking in tongues. It was super-easy to make. I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour, which I discovered made a huge difference the next time I tried this with the cornstarch -- with flour the sauce was much thicker, and I recommend flour over cornstarch. Anyway, scrumptuous and easy. Thanks!!!

This is the best teriyaki chicken I have ever had, and I don't usually care for teriyaki sauce. My entire family loves it. I poured the sauce all over chicken breasts and baked it that way instead of basting it, turning them halfway through. It is soooo good!

Wow. Loved this. Very easy to make and tastes like teriyaki chicken you'd get in a restaurant. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and added some sesame seeds. Yum! Also, watch the sauce carefully, cook it slowly and stir it all the time. In one second mine went from the consistency of soup to jelly! Next time I make this I'm going to add some pineapple slices. Thank you for sharing Marian. This recipe is a KEEPER!!!

This was really good! I just loved it! (I've already used the homemade teriyaki sauce on another recipe, which turned out tasty!) Excellent! I agree - the dish needs to be lined with foil. I had sprayed with cooking spray, which did little to help with the gooey, sticky mess afterwards, but it was WORTH it! Next time I may try using Chicken breasts in place of the thighs. Overall, very EASY and great tasting!

The sauce in this recipe is quite good, but there's not enough. After I coated both sides of the chicken, there wasn't enough left to baste the chicken with at the 10-minute intervals. I would at least double the sauce recipe. You can't have too much of this sauce so don't worry, you can use it with rice or tofu as well. Yum! Also, be sure to check the done-ness of the chicken well before 60 minutes. Mine was done in only 40 minutes.

I will never buy another bottled sauce again.  I made slight modifications.  First, double the recipe!  I used chicken brsts which I cut into chunks.  I lined my dish with foil (highly recommended).  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of regular sugar.  I used 4 cloves of crushed garlic.  I used Lite soy sauce.  I cooked the sauce on the stovetop, and had to add a bit more cornstarch to thicken.  I poured it over the chicken chunks and baked uncovered at 385 degrees for 40 minutes.  I served with wild rice and steamed broccoli, and I added a grilled piece of pineapple to the top. Absolutely the best!

This recipe turned out excellent for me. I made a few adjustments to it, but nothing major. I used a whole chicken cut into 8 pieces (minus the back). I didn't have quite enough soy sauce, so I added a little more water, and it didn't seem quite as sweet as I liked it, so I poured in some sweet chili sauce. My whole family loved it, especially my daughter who only likes chicken fried.

This is the best, easiest chicken!  This is one of probably 10 recipes that I can make that my entire family will eat without complaining, and in fact loving it!  I always use boneless, skinless breasts in place of the thighs, and I have served it with rice, served it with lettuce and chow main noodles, as a teriyaki chicken salad, and tonight I am trying it as a pizza!  Thanks so very much for this wonderful recipe, it's the fifth time I've made it since I found the recipe! :o)

This is absolutely delicious. I scaled the recipe for 12 to have extra sauce for dipping. I also used boneless chicken breasts. My boys & husband loved it. I won't buy store bought teriyaki sauce again. I would make just the teriyaki sauce to have on hand.

WONDERFUL.........one of my husbands favourites,
and very easy too.  This is a little bit sticky and messy --so cooking on parchment paper makes clean-up super easy.

Great teriyaki taste and super moist!  We loved it.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it turned out fantastic.  I'll be cooking this again soon.

I have to give this recipe five stars because it got me to eat (and enjoy) a different cut of chicken rather then my old standby -- boneless skinless breasts.  Removing the skin made this more appetizing for me, and my husband got the flavor of his favorite, dark meat.  The sauce was delicious!  This dish was great reheated too.

This was absolutely delicious. I did make it with chicken breasts which I cut into chunk size pieces.   I served it with a wild rice side dish and a spinach, red onion and mandarian orange salad with balsamic dressing.
What a hit.

We liked this and thought it was easy to prepare. Made with chicken breasts instead of thighs and served over brown rice. Thought this tasted more liked Lean Cuisine's Glazed Chicken, which is great.

Have used this recipe on all kinds of chicken cuts--thighs, wings, legs, breasts...always line the pan with foil....always comes out terrific, usually serve with jasmine rice and pea pods (and a little extra sauce drizzled over everything.  DELICIOUS!

This was the best teriyaki recipe I've made.  I did use brown sugar instead of white sugar and I only used 1/4 cup.  I also used 3 cloves of garlic.  It was delicious.

The whole family (including the 2 and 4 year old grandkids) loved this chicken! I used lite soy too, and poured some sauce in the baking dish and some on top, then as it thickened in the pan I turned the chicken periodically, but not every 10 minutes. Also baked them uncovered. When serving I scooped some of the thickened sauce out of the pan and made sure each piece was covered. I just made baked potatoes and steamed brocolli on the side (kid friendly). Next time I plan to make some kind of rice and an oriental salad with mandarin oranges. Easy and good. I also think we would love it using chicken breasts. Remember to take the skin off whatever cut you use...you don't want to miss any of the sauce!

I used boneless skinless chicken breast strips in the recipe. My family loved it and all took seconds. I served with the oriental salad on this site.Thanks for a simple great tasting recipe, Marian!

Great recipe for a teriyaki marinade.  Thanks to all for the suggestions of lining the pan with foil to ease up on cleaning.  Next time I will let the chicken marinade overnight for more flavor.  I also cooked the dish on a lower temperature as suggested by other, but I think 400 degrees is the way to go with my convection oven.

The sauce tasted great by itself, but was a little too mild when baked with the chicken.  I wish it would have had a stronger baked-in flavor.  Also, chicken came out a too dry when baked it for an hour.

This recipe was GREAT!!  My husband loved it!!  I followed other reviewers hints - a lot more garlic and ginger, lowered the temp. to 375, covered the pan with foil to avoid messes, and covered the chicken with foil to make it tender.  Next time for a healthier dish, I will use skinless thighs!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good. I did reduce the amount of sugar based on other reviews, and turned out good, just the right sweetness.  I poured the marinade right over the chicken, rather than basting.  In doing that, I needed to bake longer.   Will definitely make again.   Even my picky 6-year-old liked it!

This was SO good! I used fructose (instead of regular sugar) and chicken breasts, and baked it at 400. The sauce around the edges burned pretty black, but the chicken was perfect! Next time, I'll probably go down to 375. The house smelled so good, and my son LOVED it. I made jasmine rice with it and it was wonderful! Oh, I also decreased soy sauce and sugar to 1/3 cup as suggested in previous reviews, and it was great. Thanks!

This was a yummy but not spectacular recipe.  I used honey instead of sugar so it had a lovely sticky but not too sweet glaze and the chicken was super juicy!  I cooked it in a disposable aluminum dish so the cleanup was super easy.

My husband and I liked this recipe. I used the light soy sauce and it worked just fine. I used chicken thighs some with skin and some skinned. I found that the chicken with the skin on was more juicy and tender.

I hate to be a voice of dissent, but I did not like the way the chicken tasted with this recipe.  It was way too soy sauce-y for me...too salty.

I thought this recipe was okay.  My boyfriend and I thought the sauce was a bit salty.  Next time we plan on cutting back on the soy sauce and possibly adding some honey instead.  However, the chicken was quite tender and the sauce had an excellent consistency.  Overall, we thought the chicken was good and we'll definately try it again.

I made this for my daughter's graduation party.  It's excellent!!!  But, it's time consuming, since you need to baste every ten minutes (and the basting is the key to the wonderful glaze that it gets on it). I highly recommend it for small dinner parties only.

This recipe is excellent! We normally make the teriyaki sauce and use it to grill chicken breasts. It is very easy to make and is wonderful.

I just had to add my praises to this recipe.  The whole house smelled wonderful.  I used skinless thighs.  They were devoured!  My family still thinks they smelled better than they tasted, but then explain why they ate them all!!!! Thks for the recipe!!

The chicken tastes sooooo good.  I can't stop eating it.  My husband loves it very much too.  I would definately make it again and I would put a foil on the bottom of the dish before I bake it.  It is very hard to get the burned sticky stuff out of my dish.

Everyone loved this dish - teenage boys, parents, and elderly grandparents. Served with riced cauliflower instead of rice. Was a huge hit! Next time, I think I'll put just a splash of orange juice in the sauce or add pineapple chunks for fun. You can really play with this recipe.

I made this but put it all in the crockpot, on low for about 6 hours. I also added carrots, green pepper, and celery. I doubled the sauce and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup regular sugar instead of all regular sugar as the recipe calls for.  I only had about 7 thighs but doubling the sauce would be plenty for the 12 thighs the recipe calls for. The chicken was so tender and just pulled apart. I served it over rice pilaf and it was so good. Big hit, cheap to make, and can feed a crowd. Even better heated up the next day. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe idea.

This is a tried and true favorite among my husband & I. I've made it over a dozen times and it *never* disappoints! I have zero complaints about the flavor--it's so addictingly delicious--but I do have one small "irk". Lol. No matter what I try, no matter how long I simmer the sauce high enough to allow it to bubble for a bit, I absolutely CANNOT get the sauce to turn into a "glaze". For the life of me, I just can't get it to thicken up. I'm debating doubling the cornstarch/cold water combo next time because I don't know what else to do to prevent it from being a runny-type sauce.

Please, oh please do the basting! It made such a difference. It was juicy, and the sticky glaze made me want to cry tears of joy. I have made this before and doubled the sauce to avoid basting. Don't. Unless you plan to use the sauce over rice or something, don't bother. Still good for sure, but just not the same. Having less sauce made sure it caramelized just right. I did use low-sodium soy sauce which helped with the saltiness others complained about. I will definitely make this again.

I made it exactly as indicated, (I'm not a big fan of reviewing recipes which one has substantially altered.)Next time I make the recipe, I will make 3 changes, which I am certain will raise it to 'OMG I want the best teriyaki ever right now!' status. First, the sauce, though almost perfection, doesn't need as much powdered ginger. I'd use 1/4 tsp. Second, I'd double the amount of sauce, because it's so darn good people are going to want it for passing with the rice. Third, a 425 degree oven for 1 hour is way too long and way to high for boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Next time, I'll brine bone-in, skin-on pieces, place them on a wire rack and bake for 45 minutes at 400. I know I'm sounding super-critical, but I actually loved this recipe! Just needs a few small tweaks...

I wouldn't change a thing, but if you're going to use boneless chicken breasts as I and many others did, cut the bake time in half.

This recipe was delicious. The only change I made was to double the sauce. At first it looked like there was too much sauce, but once cooked there was just enough.

Awesome!! The sauce was so easy to make and much better than any bottled sauce. I cooked 6, bone-in thighs and kept the sauce amount the same. I cooked them bone side up, (at 350 in a glass pan) for the first 30 minutes then flipped them over for the last 30 minutes. In a smaller pan, I didn't even have to baste it. I sprayed my pan with cooking spray for easy clean-up. With steamed rice and a crisp salad it was a great meal!

This was awesome to make! I used 1/3 cup of cold water to make the glaze because I knew it wouldn't be enough. Opening the oven every 10min to baste the chicken was well worth it at the end. I will be making this more often.

Did use the original soy sauce. Tho thought the low sodium soy sauce would be much better. Just used what I had in the fridge. I also doubled the garlic too. My husband really liked it, even poured some of the left over sauce on his rice and he normally don't even like teriyaki. Now me, I didn't care for it. Was too salty. Next time I'll make sure I have the low sodium soy sauce. It was very quick and surprisingly easy.

My picky son loves this recipe.  I use boneless skinless chicken thighs.  YUM!  I line the baking sheet with foil because the soy sauce and sugar burns and smokes.  I think I will try the sauce on beef next to see how that turns out.  Thank you for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it is absolutely amazing. My only recommendation would be to double the sauce. (It's so yummy, you'll want more.) It's packed full of flavor. We ate it over white rice. We will definitely be making this again.

This was very easy to make and I added a pinch of chili flakes, pineapple chunks, red pepper chopped in cubes and roughly chopped onions. I also sprinkled the green of the green onions over top when it came out of the oven. Make sure to use tin foil to line your pan and spray well with oil. I cooked my boneless skinless chicken thighs at 400 for 40 min., basting twice, and let cool for 10 min. before serving.  Excellent!

Amazing!!!! Tastes just like a restaurant, but somehow is better all the way around. Instead of basting the chicken, I put the sauce in the 9x13 pan and rolled the chicken in it and then baked in it, rolling over at the half hour mark. Delicious!!!

I made this recipe tonight due to my daughter highly recommending it. I was very very impressed with it, we loved it so much, it has loads of flavor and the ingredients were spot on with the exception of cutting the sugar back from 1/2 cup to 1/4 and believe me you would never know the difference. I had skinless with bone in chicken breasts in the freezer so i cut them in two. follow the directions closely and you will get raves from your family and friends.

Really great and easy recipe! Substituted brown sugar for the white and cut back on the amount slightly. No need to double the sauce as some did. Plenty for 12 thighs.

Really enjoyed this!  I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviewers about doubling the sauce.  I used 6 thighs and 6 drumsticks, and the chicken was swimming in the sauce by the end.  Definitely no need to have more.  The only changes I made were to triple the garlic and cut down on the sugar (1/4 C brown instead of 1/2 C white).  Baked covered at 375 for 30 minutes, turned and basted, and cooked uncovered for 20.  The chicken was awesome.  Even my incredibly picky 4 year old ate it!

The chicken has an excellent blend of flavors and is so moist and tender we didn't even need a knife. This will go in my chicken rotation of meals.

This was a HUGE success. My husband and I loved it. I used bone-in thighs and took the skin off myself. Much cheaper at the grocery store to buy bone-in, skin on.

Judging from the gazillion reviews, I hardly think mine is going to change anything.  I'll just say that we really, really enjoyed this.  The sauce was certainly better than anything you can buy at the store.  I do recommend using foil to help with cleaning.  I almost had to get a hammer and chisel to get that black stuff off my baking dish.

Fabulous recipe!  The sauce is rich, complex and delicious.  Definitely double up the sauce, and if you like spice, season the chicken with a bit of garlic powder and ground pepper before adding the sauce on top.  After pouring about 75% of the sauce on the chicken, I covered the pan with foil and cooked at 375 degrees for 25 minutes, and then added the remainder of the sauce and cooked uncovered for 15 minutes. The chicken is very tender, flavorful and by adding quinoa and carrots, this made for a delicious meal.

Sauce is a little sweet. But, double it and keep half of it back to smother the chicken with just before serving.

My boys loved this! My youngest, who is not a big fan of chicken, said that it was the best chicken he ever had! I used 2 large boneless skinless breast sliced into strips and it was enough for 4 of us. The amount of sauce was perfect. I used a little more than 1/4 cup soy sauce. May cut the sugar back a bit next time. Defintely a keeper.

Absolutely delicious!! I doubled the sauce (thank goodness bc it is soooo good) followed directions exactly and my fiancee and I loved it. This is a keeper. The only thing I would recommend is if you are using chicken thighs or drumsticks, leave the skin on. It just gives it that much more flavor. Without the skin though, it is still awesome! Thank you for sharing!! P.S. I was going to take a picture but we ate it up so quickly I forgot lol

This turned out pretty good.  I got a little impatient with the sauce and didn't let it thicken up enough before baking. The flavor was excellent without changing anything. I baked the chicken in a foil lined pan and covered it with foil to retain some juiciness and to make clean up easier. I also just poured all the sauce on the chicken before baking it. My family liked it, although my husband said that it aggravated his acid reflux.

SO DELICIOUS! I pretty much followed this exactly except I doubled the sauce - BUT did not double the vinegar or the soy sauce. and I only had apple cider vinegar on hand and it worked out fine. Also, this didn't take nearly as long to cook as the recipe says. Maybe my oven runs hot but it only took 20 mins and the chicken was done! I had to stop myself from eating it all right after taking it out of the oven. haha Yummy yummy!

Delicious! I only had 4 chicken thighs on hand and figured that was plenty since it's just me anyway. I kept the sauce amount the same, and there was just enough! I love mixing sauce in with the rice and veggies though. Only change I made was using garlic powder instead of cloves simply because I didn't have any. Didn't measure, just did to taste. This sauce definitely trumps any bottled sauce I've had, and made the chicken thighs so tender and juicy. Will certainly be making this again.

One of my absolute favorites. My husband ate until he couldn't breathe! The only thing I did differently is instead of baking as recipe suggests, I cooked in a skillet with the sauce. Turned out wonderfully! Thanks for the recipe, going in my binder for sure.

I made this recipe as written, except my thighs were not skinless. I liked the idea of using the various ingredients, instead of buying bottled teriyaki sauce, but found the end result less than hoped for. While a lot of folks use a timer to tell them when something is done, it's much better to use a thermometer. I found the chicken got to an internal temp of 165 (perfect), long before it had been in the oven for 60 minutes.

This chicken was perfect. The whole family loved it and asked me to make again! I did double the water and cornstarch so it would thicken faster, but other than that no changes.

I used the recipe for the sauce (doubled the amount), marinated my chicken in the sauce, and grilled the meat; it was a fantastic meal. The teriyaki taste was really authentic!

Pretty much followed the recipe just substituted the white sugar for brown sugar and used 1/2 the amount less of soy sauce and it was excellent. Double the recipe for the sauce, a must!!! Great job Chef!!!

I added 1 tsp of each and it was even better:

Honey -
Sesame Seed Oil -
Rice Vinegar (SEASONED)

Absolutely delicious! Hubby asked for me to make this again the next day. I followed the recipe to a tee, except I baked for 22 minutes in 400 degrees. The thighs came out perfectly cooked, moist, and the sauce is just too good!

Everyone LOVED this!  I doubled the recipe and used breasts instead of the legs. I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar as someone suggested, it was awesome!! I threw everything in the crock pot on low for 5 hours, tender as could be!

Fantastic, definitely a keeper.  I followed the sauce recipe pretty much to the letter (though substituted fresh garlic and ginger) but only used half the chicken,  but that turned out well with just enough for the basting.  It was so flavorful and tender.  Served over rice to soak up juices.  I would serve this to company, maybe adding some breast meat to the  mix and doubling the sauce if making a full recipe.  Too delicious.  Thanks.

Great recipe. As suggested by others I used part brown sugar, and I used fresh ginger. The hint of lining the pan with aluminum foil helped a great deal.

A huge hit for my family! Everyone loved the chicken. In addition to thighs, I also used wings and drumsticks.  I would not cook the wings at such a high temp next time, but the drumsticks and things were perfect at 425.

Delicious recipe! Among the best teriyake chicken I've had. I did listen to the other reviews to double the sauce. Also, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. Made it even better. And I use heavy duty aluminum foil to line pan and save it from teriyake destruction. A muct have for any recipe box.

As written, I only gave this recipe 3 stars. It was far too sweet and we don't like chicken thighs.  However, with a few changes, this recipe is 5 stars and the whole family loves it.  The changes I made were, using boneless skinless chicken breast, cutting the sugar in half and subbing brown sugar for "half of the half", used low sodium soy sauce, a little bit of red chili flakes for some spice, tablespoon of peanut butter and a little sesame oil, and baked the chicken for only 30 minutes.  This is on the weekly rotation now.  If you like a lot of sauce to put over rice, double all sauce ingredients.

OMG! This was amazing! Thank you for the recipe! I kept the sauce the same for 4 thighs, and we only had a little left over. Keep in mind that we love sauce, especially when it's as good as this. The only change I made was that I cut back to 1/4 cup of sugar, added a little honey instead, and a few dashes of cayenne pepper because I love kick. The chicken was so tender and tasty! Thanks again!! Will be making this again and again!

This recipe is fantastic! I use it over boneless skinless chicken breasts and it is amazing. Took it to a church group one night and a friend tasted it them promptly invited herself over whenever I made it again. Best teriyaki sauce I've had, restaurant or otherwise. I generally do it without the cornstarch and water, then let it cook a little longer to thicken up. Baste the chicken and set the remaining sauce on the table to use as needed. I serve this over Garlic Rice from this site and it is a meal that never fails to please!

We had a friend staying with us so I thought I'd try this recipe. How could I go wrong with 3,499 reviews! The three of us loved it and, thankfully, there was enough for husband and I to have leftovers tonight. It's delicious!

This is the perfect, go-to recipe for teriyaki chicken. The sauce goes very well with steamed brown rice. I'll be using this sauce with different meats and fish in the future. I agree with some of the other comments about increasing the garlic and using more sauce but it gets 5 stars as-is.

Used brown sugar instead of white, and used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar. Would love to make teriyaki salmon using this recipe.

This chicken is the bomb dot com, I didn't baste the chicken though every 5 minutes... aidn't nobody got time for that! I just poured the sauce all over the chicken and let it bake, plus that way there's plenty of sauce to eat it with. LOVED IT

Amazing!!! Took the advice of other users and doubled the sauce, also covered with foil for the first 30 minutes, then removed the foil, basted again and cooked uncovered for the final 30 minutes. I used 8 bone-in skinless thighs and they came out perfectly, so juicy and tender!! My 11 year old son actually gave me a fist bump after his first bite and asked that I add this to our nightly meal rotation. Served with wild rice pilaf and broccolini. Will definitely be making this again!

I made this exactly as written using a mix of skinless legs and thighs and it turned out wonderful. I didn't have any trouble with the amount of sauce so I will be leaving the the same when I make this next. I found the balance of sweet/salt to be spot on. Many teriyaki recipes turn out more like a candy coating but not this one. The one thing that I might add next time is some crushed red pepper flakes strictly because I like spicy food. 
A VERY good recipe. Thanks.

Keeping this recipe! Made the sauce exactly as directed and it turned out great. I used a foil lined dish and poured all the sauce on at once before putting in the oven. Tasted delicious! My 6 year-old loved it. I served it with white rice and steamed veggies.

Definately double the sauce. I know the sauce ingredients seem like a strange combo but the sauce is quite good. Ill use it all summer on lots of stuff. Try a little red pepper flake for some kick. I like it very much much not nearly as much as I LOVE the Cherry Bomb Chicken from this site

Made this recipe for my husband. He's a pretty picky eater and he was raving about this teriyaki recipe!!! I cook with a wok on a weekly basis and I'm going to use this same recipe with steak, red & green pepprs, onions and rice for a teriyaki stir fry. Definitely a keeper!

Very good, made it with chicken parts. We enjoyed this recipe, I found some low sodium soy sauce and used that on the chicken. I don't care much for soy sauce, but on this very tasty. Will make again.

Made recipe exactly (used about 6 pieces of skin on chicken thighs) and everyone loved it, that includes a 2 year old. This is now an almost weekly dinner for us.  Baked at 375 for about an hour and foiled for the first half hour. Soo good.

This was a good teriyaki sauce, but a little on the tangy/sour side for me. I used all of the ingredients as directed above, but I also added 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar to make it a little sweeter. I used the sauce over sautéed chicken, peppers, onions, water chestnuts, and broccoli with rice. A great option to stir fry.

My family really loves chicken like this. However, I wasn't able to turn as often as the recipe indicated. It wasn't done when the time went off I pan sheared it until it was done.

Really, really great recipe. SO much better than anything I've ever had out of a bottle. A VERY easy dinner, but packed with flavour.  My husband who doesn't typically like 'sweet' sauces on meats really enjoyed this, too.

I used boneless chicken breasts which I cut into several large chunks.. Covered with tin foil while baking for 35 minutes at 425 degrees. Also added a squeeze of siraccha to my sauce to give it a bit of spice. Was perfect!

This recipe is awesome! I doubled the recipe and had 4 smaller chicken thighs (boneless). I cooked covered with foil for 30min then flipped them and cooked covered still for 30 more min. Covering it made the meat so tender! I made the sauce before baking and let the thighs sit in it for about an hour. Think about doing that. Low sodium soy sauce would have been better, I just didn't have it, but I cut the regular soy sauce in half with water. This is so yum! This would be great to make in bulk for a party. I served over  brown rice.

I did not like this recipe at all. The teriyaki sauce did not taste good and I followed the recipe exactly. I thought I did something wrong the first time so I tried it again and with the same results, I knew it wasn't me. Will be going back to the Yoshida sauce from Costco.

Awesome!  I would definitely recommend using the thighs.  I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and son both loved this!

Great recipe. I doubled the sauce because one review recommended it but I found out it wasn't necessary. I used chicken breast because that's what I had. My family loved it. I will make it again

I threw everything in the crockpot. Before serving I combined 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water to thicken sauce. I also added a bag of frozen Asian vegetables. This is delicious served over rice.

Made it as is, and thought it was great. Didn't need to double the sauce, as I did chicken breasts instead of drumsticks.

I love this recipe! It is so simple and yummy, I used the remaining sauce on plain white rice to make a super yummy teryaki chicken bowl. Used boneless skinless chicken breast sliced, doubled the recipe for the sauce, and separated it out to use as over top on some of the rice. My kids loved it.

I was out of cornstarch, so I used flour (suggested substitute simmered longer) and I also used chix tenderloins.  Also, used garlic powder since I was out of minced garlic.  It was fantastic.  Perfect amount of spicy and sweet.  Paired with some honey carrots and brocolli and cheese.  Fantastic meal, and even my picky 5 year old love it!

Thank you for such a great recipe, I marinated the chicken over night in the sauce.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I also omitted the ginger and added a few sprigs of rosemary, which added a totally different flavor to the sauce.  If you marinate in the sauce overnight or for any length of time, you can reuse the sauce if you put it in a pan and bring to a boil for about 10 minutes to cure the sauce of any bacteria from the chicken, etc.  Either way, this was a wonderfully different recipe.  Thanks!  There is no limit to what you can use this for, sweet and sour, add hoisin and make it a little peppery, very great recipe, thanks again!

We love this recipe! The only thing we changed was to add more garlic (fresh garlic)and pepper. This is my 12 year old son's "GO-TO" Recipe when it is his turn to cook. We have done it in the oven and on the grill. If grilling, wait to baste with the sauce until the end of cooking time, or it will burn.

I love this recipe. I made a few changes. First of all I doubled the recipe. Secondly I used a half cop of brown sugar and a quarter cup of white sugar. I cooked it on 375° the first half hour, then decreased the temp to 350° for the remaining 30 minutes. I used both boneless chicken breasts and thighs. Will be making again in the near future.

Even if you don't want chicken, you really should make the sauce for this, and double it, if you want a good teriyaki sauce! This stuff tastes way better than than the mix/bottles you get at the store, and so much better for you because you can control the salt (use lower sodium soy sauce) and other ingredients (no high fructose corn syrup or some gobblygoop sounding ingredients here!). Definitely use fresh ginger though, not ground...it makes a difference!

This recipe was perfect! I made it exactly as written. The chicken was delicious. I doubled the sauce recipe to have some leftover. Glad I did that because I decided to try it on some chicken breasts I needed to cook. The breasts turned out juicy and tender. I have never had breasts turn out so wonderfully. Will definitely make this again. Everyone loved it. Thanks Marian Collins. This is a winner to say the least.

What a delicious recipe for chicken! I followed Valerie's Kitchen review without covering it and it came out perfect! I did not have light soy sauce so I used 3/4 cup regular soy sauce and 1/4 cup water. It seemed to be just the right amount of saltiness. Great with rice and veggies. My sister copied the recipe and made it for her family too!

this is amazing - loved the sauce just the way it is - so so yummy - the best teriyaki sauce i've had or made - this is now on our regular rotation - one tip - i line a pyrex dish with alum. foil and spray it with nonstick spray before adding chicken to bake... once this sauce bakes it is literally impossible to get off of those glass pans.  Great great recipe!!

Just tried this recipe today! We had drumsticks for awhile and I was trying to think of a good recipe for them. Wow! They were the best drumsticks I have ever made. I made the sauce with 1 tsp of fresh ginger and used brown sugar. I doubled the sauce like everyone said and basted the chicken every 10-15 min. I cooked them with a foil cover for 25 min. Then I turned them over and cooked them uncovered. They were perfect in 45 min at 375 degrees.

This was the best teriyaki sauce ever! Me and my husband loved it! I put the chicken in a crockpot with the sauce and the last hour of cooking I threw some broccoli in. Then served it over rice, it was delicious.

The recipe was easy to follow and turned out great! We added half a cup of cooking cream when the chicken was ready and it totally added a new dimension. Yummy!!!

I was hesitant to rate this review since you have so many already.  But had to let you know that I cooked this today for my son and grandson.  Made exactly as posted except doubled the sauce as others suggested.  They devoured it!!!  Made 13 thighs for the 3 of us and have only 4 left.   Was hoping to have more for leftovers tomorrow, but that won't happen.   Served with fried rice.  Delicious.

Add a another 5 stars!  I also prepared this recipe using 1/3 cup soy sauce as suggested by other viewers.  I had 3 large boneless chicken which I pounded flat to about a 1-inch thickeness.  I poured all of the sauce mixture over the chicken breasts and topped with pineapple tidbits and and coarsley chopped red pepper (that I had on hand) and sprinkled with a few red pepper flakes.  The chicken baked for about 35 minutes at 350 degress and was done perfectly....moist and tender. I did baste the chicken with the sauce twice during the baking period.  Brown rice and a green vegetable was served with the chicken...delish!  I will be preparing this recipe again!!

Awesome recipe!  I made 4 x the recipe and froze the sauce in one cup portions.  I also use to marinade chicken pieces overnight, then drain and coat in seasoned mixture of half flour and half cornstarch, salt and pepper, deep fry.  Chicken is tender and flavorful.

Hubby loved it, pre-schooler ate it.  I used one recipe of sauce for 4 boneless breasts (1lb of boneless chicken).  When i checked it at 35 min. the biggest breast was at 160, so I took them out.  Next time I'll check a bit earlier.

I am a big fan of marinating for flavor so adding this last minute was unique for me, but was definitely surprised. My two boys (8 & 12) absolutely loved the sauce...make sure you double the sauce as stated in other reviews.

Delicious, juicy, and overall wonderful! I used chicken breasts as a healthier alternative (no skin), and cut the oven time to just 30 minutes (20 minutes one side and 10 on other).

5 stars with a couple changes. I used equal parts white sugar, light brown sugar and dark brown sugar (if you double the sauce use 1/3 cup each). This was to enable it to caramelize the sugar without too much molasses flavor. I also used rice vinegar instead of cider. 
Tthe 2nd time I made this I sauted the chicken with a little of the sauce until it was browned all over and the sauce had caramelized. Then I added the rest and simmered it for about 30-40 minutes until the sauce thickened. The result was awesome! I do recommend using reduced sodium soy sauce if you do this or it will be a bit too salty after the sauce reduces that long.

AMAZING FLAVOR.  I USE 1/2 WHITE SUGAR AND 1/2 BROWN SUGAR.  IF YOU WANT SPICY ADD SOME ROOSTER SAUCE.  PLAN ON TRYING THIS SAUCE ON PARTY WINGS. THANKS FOR THE GREAT AND VERSATILE RECIPE.

This was delicious.  I used less chicken thighs and marinated them for a few hours before cooking.  I followed other reviewers advice and covered with foil.  
My husband really liked it.  Next time I will try it on steak.

I have made this several times as written.  We love it. I think it could easily be used on other kinds of meat or fish.  The only difference is that I do not cook the thighs so long. They only need about 45 minutes.

yum! really good. I lined a 8x8 glass baking dish with aluminum foil, poured the sauce over the chicken breast. Turned my oven to 425 Degrees F and baked it for 30-35 minutes.

Made this last night and as others had advised, I doubled the sauce (used 12 chicken thighs).  

Also I covered and baked at 350 for about an hour.  

Delicious and this would be great on salmon or shrimp.

I've made this sauce many times over the years.  I keep fresh ginger in the freezer so it's really easy to use freshly grated in this recipe.  Such a great sauce to use for all Asian recipes!

I used 1/4c. of teriyaki sauce and 1/4 c. of soy sauce, and added some minced ginger then followed the remainder of the recipe.  It was very good.  The next time I will line the pan for easy clean up afterwards.

I didn't have enough soy sauce and I still thought it was a bit too much. I also didn't cook the sauce long enough so it wasn't thickened, but the chicken still came out very tasty!

I am a lousy cook. I burn water. I was debating with myself over ordering take out chicken teriyaki or attempting to ruin some frozen chicken breasts I had in the freezer. I decided on the latter and used this recipe. This was amazing. I can't get over how good it is, and I made it. As I said I used boneless skinless chicken breasts but only baked at 375 for 20 minutes on each side. FANTASTIC. Everything about this is so easy and if I can make this, anyone can.

Delicious!  I followed sauce recipe with two small adjustments. I used reduced sodium soy and had to use red wine vinegar as I discovered while making it I was out of apple cider vinegar.  I marinated breasts for 1 hr prior to baking.  This recipe is now in my recipe box!  Thanks for sharing!!

Awesome recipe!  Used tenderloins and cooked only 40min, turning over once.  My husband said they melted in your mouth and my kids devoured them.  Need to make more next time.  Great company recipe over rice.  Thanks!

Sauce was delicious!!  I can't rate the recipe fully as I changed a few things.  I sliced the chicken thighs in strips, I seasoned them with salt, pepper and garlic powder, then I coated them with flour and fried them.  Once they were cooked through I added the sauce to the chicken.  I served with white rice and steamed broccoli, it was yummylicious.

Another recipe that has gone into heavy rotation in our household. It is really nice to know it is so easy to make teriyaki sauce from scratch, since all the bottled versions these days have high fructose corn syrup and other undesirable ingredients.

This tastes just like a favorite local restaurants Teriayki chicken.  I used boneless chicken breasts and instead of sugar, i used Truvia and a mix of brown sugar.  I baked in the sauce over a bed of sliced onions.  Added broccoli at the last 15 minutes. SO good. Baked in a foil lined  pan at 425 for 30 minutes covered, uncovered and lowered to 350 for 30 minutes.  Delicious!!

Update:  I used brown sugar, all of what was called for and it was divine.  We ate it with brussell sprouts.  

Definitely cut down on the sugar - WAY too sweet!  And double the sauce.  I used fresh ginger and next time will use lite soy sauce.  I covered the chicken with foil for the first 30 mintues and while it was cooking, I stir-fryed some chopped bell peppers, an onion and some sliced mushrooms for about 3-4 mintues.  Then for the last 30 minutes of cooking, I took the foil off and tossed the veggies in the pan and covered everything with the rest of the sauce.  Cooked it uncovered & served t with rice.  If it were not for the dish being too sweet because of the darn sugar, it would have been perfect!

This recipe was good. I listened to a lot of the reviews. I doubled the sauce recipe to baste the chicken. I only had sodium soy sauce, so I added the amount posted (because I doubled the recipe) and then added more to taste. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar (doing the same thing with the brown sugar as I did the soy sauce). My chicken was partially frozen so I baked for 30 minutes at 375 covered and then 30 minutes at 350 uncovered and turning every 20 minutes. The chicken was a little drier than expected and I think basting every 10 minutes might be excessive. I think you can baste every 20 minutes and be all right. The flavor of the sauce was good even though I'd never heard of using vinegar in a teriyaki sauce. I think if I make this again, I might marinate the chicken in the teriyaki in order to add more flavor.

A real crowd pleaser. Good idea to double the sauce. The drippings can burn, I recommend using a rack and lining the baking dish with foil.

This recipe was good, but needs some tweaking, thus the 4 star rating.  It's close though, and with the proper tweaks I could see it being 5 stars.  I'm sure the recommended changes in the comments are the right way to go, but since I have not tried them yet, I can't say for sure.

Great, easy recipe made with pantry staples.  (I do prefer to scale the sugar back to about 1/3 cup.) I've also made it super-quick by cutting the chicken into bites and browning in a skillet while I prep the sauce in a separate pan. But baking as directed is better.

This was delicious!!!  My husband, kids (ranging from 4 to 10 years old)  loved this.  I made it as is and it was fantastic.  Only advise it to double this!!  
I did make some thighs and some breasts in separate pans...both were yummy!!

I as well used a lower sodium soy.  I used Bragg which is not fermented and lower in sodium.  Also used brown sugar instead of white.  My hubby and 12 year old step daughter loved it.   Great base recipe to make your own adjustments.

I did not care for this recipe, it was to watery I ended up adding a whole bottle of store bought teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was not very tender, I would not make this again.

Mmmm, yummy! Made as directed but subbed dried minced garlic & fresh ginger. I didn't bother to thicken the sauce prior but rather poured it over the chicken to marinate 2 hours. The sauce thickened well enough on it's own while it was baking & the more I basted the more of that yummy glaze built-up on the chicken pieces & I am telling you don't ignore the advice of others & DO double the sauce recipe. You'll want to keep dipping your chicken into it as you eat & will probably want to pour a little over your rice as well! De-licious!

Pretty good. Would probably be good on the grill too or as kebabs. I doubled the sauce recipe with exact measurements but the flavor of the soy sauce was a bit too dominant in my opinion. In the future, I might reduce the soy sauce and add pineapple juice in its place.

This was easy and tasted awesome. I did it in the slow cooker by throwing all of the ingredients in there and cooking it in low for 6 hours.

We LOVE this recipe.  It's delicious, lowfat, and does not make a mess of the kitchen like a lot of asian dishes can.  I used fresh ground ginger (the bottled kind you keep in the fridge).  If you 1/2 the sugar like some suggest, it's WAY too salty. Perhaps start out with half and add more to suit your tastes, but it's teriyaki! It's supposed to be sweet.  Definitely double the sauce, you'll regret it if you don't.  The only thing I add is a splash of sesame oil.  Fabulous!

Easy, and the family enjoyed it. I didn't have light soy, so I used half the amount of soya sauce.  It didn't make much sauce once it boiled down. I used the entire recipe for 6 thighs, and it was exactly enough to coat each thigh. Baked at 375 for 40 min, basting every 15 min. Yum!

I made this exactly as written with the exception of I hate basting so I poured half of the most wonderful sauce on my leg quarters. I first had them skin side down.  I then baked (350) them for 30min. then turned them over skin side up and baked the last 40 min after pouring the rest of the sauce over them. I also used a small aluminum pan. Easy clean up! Toss it! WhooHoo! Regardless of skin on, off we like skin on with all parts of the fat removed. This was the best ever tasting chicken. I can't wait to use this on a whole baked chicken. Then I will have to baste. Love this!

Used only 1/4 of sugar and recipe turned out great. Tip- use brown sugar or honey in place of white sugar. Gives recipe more depth of flavour.

I didn't care for the taste of the sauce at all in the beginning.  Even after reducing and thickening, I was thinking to myself "blech - I hope this turns out".  And turn out it did - I couldn't get enough of it!  I was only cooking for 2 of us, but I made a full batch of sauce and cooked each chicken thigh in individual ramikens (covered with foil for 35", then without for 10).  I let them rest for 10 minutes and when we were ready to eat, they were fall of the bone tender.  We ladeled the sauce cooked with the chicken over steamed rice and were in heaven.  We'll be trying this grilled, on skewers with pineapple, and - oh, I have 20 different ideas!  Thank you so much for recipe - a real keeper!  So happy I made a full batch of sauce as we'll be using the rest as a marinade later on in the week.

This was delicious. We substituted chicken breast for the thighs (personal preference) but made the sauceexactly per the recipe. We loved it- my 4 year old ate seconds. Served with white rice and edamame.

Made this recipe for a church potluck.  Used all chicken legs (more kid friendly). Had approximately 38 chicken legs, and tripled the sauce recipe.  The only thing I changed was used about 1/2 to 3/4 regular sugar it called for and added some brown sugar.  Took the skin off of the legs, and basted them several times during cooking with sauce.  Baked them in 3 pans and used convection.  Had 2 pans of them in one oven and 1 in another.  Took approximately 1 hour for all of them to cook, on convection.  This was yummy and loved the sauce!

Sooooo Good! I made this with chicken legs and decreased the cooking time by 20 minutes and the chicken came out moist, full of flavor, and by the end of the meal all gone! I doubled the amount of sauce because I knew I would want to slather it on.

My family loved this! I did double the sauce as recommended by other viewers and I also covered it with foil. I did think it was a bit too sweet after cutting it down to 1/3 cup sugar so will probably reduce it further to 1/4 cup. Great recipe!

Oh! Family of 4 says "this turned out perfect..." I trippled recipe, 1 for meat & 2 for spag. noodles.  Used pulled baked chicken in skillet. Changes made: used brown sugar not white,
           1/8 Cup oj and 1/8 C. lemon juice
           instead of 1/4 cup vinegar.
Thank you for sharing:)

Made this with chicken legs... I adjusted the sauce a little. I tasted the apple cider vinegar a bit too strongly.  Basted the chicken every 15 min and they came out DELISH!!

Thank you Marian for a great recipe...these were delicious.  I've made them several times & I believe cooking them at 425 degrees for 1 hour was too much. I cooked them at half the time, turning every 10 min. & basting & they were scrumptous. Please try these, you'll be glad you did.

I love this recipe.  However, I think it needs to be doubled.  I find it hard to coat everything properly without the increase.  Also, Chicken thighs are the best with this...

This was amazing! My husband, toddler, and I all loved it!  I used different information from other users' comments to come up with my creation.  I doubled the sauce, which I think is a must.  I used  1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I covered the chicken for the first half hour. I baked the chicken at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  I brushed them with sauce about every 10 minutes and turned over the pieces after 30 minutes. 
The one thing I did differently than everyone else- I think- is I used only 1/4 cup regular soy sauce and 1/2 stick of unsalted butter.  The butter took away the excess saltiness and gave the sauce an amazing taste. I'd read somewhere a long time ago that adding butter or some other fatty substance to your cooking can take away saltiness.  Worked for me and made an amazing sauce!

This is such a FABULOUS recipe. Such accessible ingredients...I had them all on hand already.  The chicken comes out perfectly juicy and coated with the delicious, gooey sauce. The only thing I did differently was add a dash of crushed red pepper...I like a little kick. The only thing I will do differently next time is USE FOIL! The pans are a nightmare afterward!

This chicken was absolutely delicious.  I made it the first time according to the recipe.  I did double the sauce and add fresh ginger per other reviewer’s suggestions.  I’m usually not a big fan of chicken thighs but they work in this dish. I like this because chicken thighs are cheap which makes this a cost effective meal as well.   Let me tell you, whip up some fried rice and broccoli and you have a meal on your hand that is restaurant quality!!! The hubby was like oh yeah babe this is a keeper!!! Will make again and again! Yummy!

This was sooooo good! I did use 2 cloves of garlic and 1/4 cup white sugar & 1/4 packed brown sugar. My fiance has already claimed we need to use this sauce to marinate a steak in!

This was a HIT for my extremely picky house of eaters!! The only thing I did different was use garlic powder because of no fresh on hand and I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I bet this sauce would be good on any meat. I had extra sauce so I will be trying this on other meat.

I only used this recipe for the sauce, I just cooked chicken thighs in a pan and then glazed them with the sauce. With that said, the sauce was delicious! To counteract some of the saltiness-factor, I put in a little bit of honey- gave it a nice touch.

I loved this! Beats anything you'd buy in the supermarket. I didn't have dried ginger so I grated fresh ginger-maybe 1-1.5 tsp... used 2 cloves garlic.. followed the recipe to the letter otherwise. Oh.. only had 4 skinless thighs and the sauce was the right amount so if you are making more- definitely double up on the recipe. I didn't find it too salty, but maybe because I served it over plain white rice, shredded with brussel sprouts. Will make this again.

I loved this sauce and I will make it again.  I only had chicken breasts but I agree that this would be better with thighs.  I didn't have all the soy sauce so i used teriyaki sauce to fill the blance of the 1/2 cup. I also didnt use as much sugar either.  I think this sauce would be awesome on ribs.

The sauce was VERY tasty and easy to make, but it wasn't nearly enough. While the chicken was baking, I made an extra batch of sauce and put it on the chicken while still in the oven. I cooked for my fiance's family and they all loved it!

This was delish!!! I made some changes so that it would be healthier. I made my own soy sauce by boiling then simmering 3 c's water, 1/4 c red wine vinegar, 1/4 c honey, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp garlic for 30 mins or untiI had about 1/2 c of soy sauce. Instead of the sugar I used 1/2 of honey and added 1/2 tsp of salt. It came out awesome! My bf loved it and wanted more. Next time I make it though I think I will cut back on the garlic. I think it offset the flavor a bit. Otherwise 5 stars!!

LOVED this sauce!!! Even my EXTREMELy finnicky-eater grandson ate TWO thighs, and requested left-overs a couple days later. When I heated him up one, he asked for the other as well...you just don't know how hard it is to get him to eat anything!! For those reviewers who said to cut the sugar...I say DO NOT mess with this recipe!! It is WONDERFUL as written. The only thing I did different was to turn and coat every 15 minutes rather than every 10 minutes. Since I used skinless thighs (didn't want to, but had no choice...), I did cover the pan the first 30 minutes. THESE TURNED OUT FANTASTIC!!

Made according to directions.  Only had 2 large boneless checken breasts.  Absolutely line the pan with foil!
Bakes at 350 (convection oven) for 40 min.  Very good!

Very good! But you MUST cover the dish in tin foil to avoid a very miserable clean up. The sauce turns to a tarry glaze after being in the oven so long. Delicious though. Will make again!

Good basic teriyaki recipe; I think the sauce would be good in stir-fry as well.  I did not make any changes and thought there was plenty of sauce without doubling, especially if you prefer a nice thick glaze rather than sauce for dipping.  Great idea other reviewers had to line the pan with foil.

Would add a little less soy sauce and cook a tad longer but also depends on the oven you use. Overall it was wonderful and excited to make it again.

Lots of flavor but very, very salty.  I only use low sodium soya but it didn't seem to matter on this one.  Turned out salty anyway.  Best "homemade" teriyaki recipe yet.

This is a good recipe, however the oven temp of 425 for an hour can't be right. Maybe 325 for an hour.

This was excellent and easy! I used brown sugar instead of white..that was my only change. I used both breast & thigh meat, I thought the thigh meat was better. I would line my baking dish with foil next time. It was a bit messy. served it with white rice & stir fry veggies.

Delicious.  I added a couple of additional items, but left the main recipe as is.  I added green bell peppers and pineapple chunks, as I enjoy those flavors along with Teriyaki.  As others suggested, I doubled the recipe with the exception of the sugar.  I probably only used about 2/3 of a cup.  I also put the chicken (sliced chicken breasts), bell peppers, pineapples and all of the sauce in a foil lined glass dish to cook.  The chicken stays moist and soaks up all the flavor.

Generally good 
a bit tough _ followed the recipe exactly, but didn't brush with the sauce every 10 min, maybe every 15 - 20 min and turned 3 times.

(if) i make this again, i would marinate it than continue.

This is definitely a favorite now.  I do agree with other reviewers who say the sauce should be doubled.  I only used 6 thighs and the original amount of sauce and it worked out fine.  If doing more chicken, however, it would not be enough.  Also, I did not have cider vinegar on hand so I replaced it with white wine vinegar and the sauce still tasted delicious.  I also used a mixture of white AND brown sugar instead of only white.  You can definitely amp up the heat a little when cooking the sauce if it is taking too long.  The cooking time for the chicken is perfect.  I didn't find any need to change that.  You can get away with brushing the chicken every 15 minutes if you find every 10 is too tedious.  I also poured the remaining sauce over the chicken once there were only 10 minutes remaining.  A little time consuming but definitely worth it !!

Wonderful combination of flavers. I did change it to my way of cooking. I added all the ingredients, used brown sugar, fresh garlic and ginger, (did not measure anything) I did not add the cornstarch and marinated my chicken all day. I poured the liquid in a sauce pan and then added the cornstarch. I boild for a few minutes. I cooked my chicken on the grill and basted the chicken with the sauce. It was fantastic!!! :)

This was very good and simple to prepare. It will be a regular recipe in my house now. The sauce soaks in the chicken just right and has a great flavor. I love the cider vinegar in it, gives it a nice twang. I made this with drumsticks and thighs. I used low sodium soy sauce because that's just what we use at my house and it was great. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

As other reviews said...Double the sauce. I used some chicken breast diced and baked at 375 for about 30 min. This sauce was excellent...finger licken good, I used brown sugar instead of white and added a couple tablespoons of honey. This would be great on Salmon.

This was very good, my husband loved it, BUT the thighs do not need to cook for 1 hour at 425 degrees. That's too long. I normally cook thighs at 350 for 1 hour. So I pulled them out after 50 minutes and they were fine.

I've made this several times & I keep getting requests for more.  I make it exactly as the recipe states.  Excellent recipe!  We'll never buy teriyaki again!

FABULOUS!!! 
I must say I will definately be making this again, I do recommend to double the sauce and add little more garlic.. 
The temperture was a little high so I turned it down to 400 instead of 425. 
I give this a 5 star and + this would also be amazing on wings as well! sauce is great on rice.

Excellent!!!  Definitely double the recipe, and cut the sugar in half.  Used low sodium soy sauce and chicken breasts.  Use half the sauce to cook with and save the other half to add on top after cooking.  Great with steamed broccoli and carrots!

I made this for supper yesterday.  It was delicious, and so easy to make.  The only change I would make next time would be to lower the temperature to 400 as I needed to add water twice.

Overall flavor was awesome...great sauce.  I made the mistake of covering it in the oven and it was way too runny.  So, I put it in a pan on the stove and poured some of the sauce over the top and cooked over a high flame for a couple of minutes.  The sauce thickened right up and tasted great!

My family decided to try this recipe for our Easter
dinner instead of the traditional Ham.  It was fair but not great.  My family liked my own recipe much better.  My recipe is the original recipe of the Hawaiian Islands.

This is an awesome recipe.  Everyone I serve it to asks for it.  We now make it very frequently.  I personally don't like ginger, so that doesn't get added and its still great.

The kids loved it and so did I. It was easy to make and I did not leave it sitting for the flavor to be in it. I did make some changes but it turned out great. I used stevia instead of sugar and tamari instead of soy sauce and apple cider vinegar which is a little different from cider vinegar. Thank you

I fixed this for the first time for my family over the weekend and I followed the recipe just as it was written.  They loved it!! Even my picky 4 yr old son ate all of it. While it was baking my boys kept coming in asking what smelled so good.  The only thing I would change would be next time to line the pan with aluminum foil to speed up the clean up.

I sliced the breasts up into smaller pieces, and poured all the sauce in a pan. Every 15minutes of so I would open the oven, and baste the top of the chicken. It turned out GREAT!

So delicious!!!  I don't eat meat, so I used this with a saute of mushrooms, onions, and shrimp.  It was fabulous!!

I used honey instead of sugar to pretend it was healthier... it was a bit too sweet (I'm not sure it that was the recipe, or the honey) so I would reduce the amount next time... but otherwise the flavours were phenomenal together!!

My husband and children absolutely LOVED this recipe! I substituted half of the soy sauce for liquid aminos. No one could even tell the difference.

Awesome recipe! It's become one of the family favorites.

I used boneless chicken breasts, doubled the sauce but probably didn't need to, that was for 2 whole breasts. I used brown sugar and less sodium soy sauce, it was still salty but very good. I had planned on lining my pan with foil per the reviews but I forgot. I will def. not forget next time.

As a variation to this, I mixed the sauce ingredients together and threw everything into the crockpot.  I did not have time to cook the sauce on the stove first.  Although the sauce did not thicken, as I expected it would not, it was still very good and made a good thin sauce to use on the side for our oriental style dinner.  Can't wait to try it baked, as well.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is amazing. I would recommend doubling the sauce. Definitely stick with the bone-IN chicken. I usually do boneless with other recipes but the bone in this one makes the chicken unbelievably moist and will make this recipe go from great to glorious.

The sauce turned out really great! I didn't bake the chicken, I cut up small pieces and sauteed it in a nonstick pan. After the chicken was cooked, I added about 2 tablespoons of the sauce and let it cook down a bit and used the rest of the sauce to top the chicken and rice on our plates.  This is a keeper!

I followed the recipe except for using boneless skinless chicken breast and I did pour the sauce right over the chicken and baked in the oven, turning half-way through.  I will definitely try this recipe again, but reduce the sugar...it was too sweet for me but other than that, delicious!

Forget the bottled teriyaki sauces!  This is the bomb!  I cut the soy sauce in half, and used 1/4 C brown sugar in place of 1/4 of the white sugar. Awesome!

I used this recipe using 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Per the recommendation of some other reviewers I did change it a little.  I added 1 t of honey, a dash of worcestire sauce (sp?) and a sprinkle of chili flakes for a kick.  This sauce was delicious even before I made the modifications.  I highly recommend it and will make it again.  We had this dish with broccoli and jasmine rice.  Highly recommend.

Love it! And agree with other reviewers that you can definitely double the sauce so that there is leftover to put on the rice.

Not impressive.  The positive aspects were that the chicken was moist & tender & nicely browned & preparation was not difficult.  Most of the ingredients are those I have on hand most of the time.  The family thought it was good, I thought it just lacked flavor.  Not bad just not what I was expecting & certainly nothing to brag about.

This was delicious.  Sometimes teriyaki can be too salty, but this was not.  I used skinless bone-in thighs and it took only 40-45 mins to bake.  I served this with glazed carrots and sweet basil broccoli.

This was absolutely delicious!!!  I did substitute fresh grated ginger for the dried and I cut the amount of thighs in half still using the full recipe for the sauce and I placed it over Jasmine rice to complete the dish.  This is going to become a staple in my house!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I liked it very much, except brushing the sauce on every 10 minutes was a pain. I definitely could see making this recipe for a crowd.

this turned out as good as everyone said!  My 4yo gave it two thumbs up and the hubby said it was pretty good, but there was something bitter in i.  I dont know what, but he has very discriminating taste. We will definitely be making this again. I am interested to see how well it washes out of my baking dish.

This is a very easy and tasty meal.  The prep time is minimal. My family eats chicken often.  This recipe will be one my son's favorite chicken meals.

Delicious. I did cut into strips, but needed to double the sauce (since there was more surface to cover that way). You only need to re-baste after 15 min of baking, then one other time after 15 min of baking on the other side. If you baste every 10 min it gets to be too much. Do line the dish with tinfoil. Easy clean-up. :)

This teriyaki sauce isn't my favorite but I gave it four stars because this is the best BAKED teriyaki chicken recipe I've tried.  While it was good, it left me looking forward to BBQ season when I can make great teri chicken on the BBQ.

Great recipe! I used de-boned chicken breast with the skin left on and marinated it in the sauce and then grilled it. Made extra sauce and poured over it over the chicken after it was done. My husband and kids loved it.

Great recipe! Since my first post, I have made this 2 more times. The first time I added the sauce to fish and it was ok (no fault of the sauce, I'm just not that into fish).  The second time I made the recipe as written and the only addition I made was adding crushed peanuts at the end.  It was delish! As written, the sauce becomes a yummy glaze.  The last time I made this I added a pint of fresh diced mushrooms and baked the chicken with the mushrooms, it was great too!  The mushrooms definitely made it more liquidy, but it was perfect over rice.  Glaze or with the mushrooms - both are great,  I will definitely make this my go to teriyaki.  Can't wait to try it on meatballs, burgers and more.  Thanks!!!

I followed the davice of others and doubled the sauce except I used 1/2 cup suagr and 1/4 cup brown sugar and only 3/4 cup soy sauce.  I added a little extra garlic.  I cooked 4 boneless skinless breasts with all the sauce at 375 for 25 minutes covered with foil.  I then took the foil off, turned the pieces over and brushed with sauce and cooked uncovered for an additional 15 minutes,  They turned out better than I expected.  I will definitely make these again.

This was the best Teriyaki Chicken I have ever made.  I did use light brown sugar instead of white sugar.  One word of advise is to use foil to line your pan it is a mess to clean without it.  This is a family favorite that I will continue to make for years to come.

The sauce is great!! A little salty but a bit extra water makes that better. I have also used it as a stir fry sauce with chicken and vegetables over rice. Very good!

Very good.  It's a little salty as written so I'd add less soy sauce next time.  I also added some pineapple juice for flavor (and to cut the salt) and it was tasty.

This was so delicious!!! I only SLIGHTLY tweaked the recipe. First, I doubled the sauce. This is key! I am also on an extremely low sugar diet, so I replace the white sugar with an equal amount of granulated splenda with fiber. We LOVE garlic, so I added 2 tsp minced garlic. My husband literally jumped out of his seat and said "OMG THIS IS SO AWESOME!" I served it over jasmine rice. Thanks for this recipe, it will definitely be a regular around my house!

Amazing!  Doubled the sauce so I could add some to the lo mein I made to go with these.  I only brushed chicken 3 times total and they were still amazing.  I left them in long enough to get crispy.....at first I tasted the sauce and thought, "eh....it's ok".  But after baked on the chicken???  Fabulous!!!!!!!!!!

This was really good. I don't like dark meat so I  used chicken breast.  It does not need to cook for an hour though.  Mine got kind of dry.  I also omitted the ginger because I did not have any.  For the future I would definetly use low sodium soy sauce.  Otherwise great recipe.  I will make again

Wonderful flavor, just be sure to use lite soy and keep it covered with foil to ensure moisture and no burned sauce taste.

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes. The only thing I do differently...is I cover with tin foil for approx 30-40 mins then take the cover off to crisp the skin....yum yum!   This is also the only chicken my picky teenager will eat.

I don't know what I did wrong but we didn't care for this. The sauce wouldn't stick to the chicken. It kept running off and mixed with the fat from the thighs, it just became a runny soupy mess that the thighs baked in. I had to grill the thighs to get my family to eat them. Probably won't make again.

I deboned the thighs and they cooked in about half the time.  What I will do differently next time: Definitely line the pan with foil.  The baked-on sauce was really hard to clean.

Very good and simple, double the sauce - could try with turkey breast or pork chops and would probably be good as well. Served with stirfry frozen veggies from Costco (surprisingly good, cook up crispy not mushy!) and rice for a quick easy weeknight supper.

Very good. I started the dish by cooking uncovered, but noticed the sauce was starting to burn on the sides of the pan, so I would cook covered in the future. My husband loved it, and he says that he usually doesn't like teriyaki chicken.

This was a good homemade teriyaki sauce, but it didn't wow me as much as it did others. My sauce wasn't as thick as it looks here in this pic, and I made sure it boiled...it was thick in the pan but not cass dish after all was said and done. Kinda weak tasting. I did double the recipe, used fresh ginger. I even added a lil orange citrus as one reviewer did, I think it cut back on the saltiness. I also used more brn sug than white.  I am the only big teriyaki fan...well was years ago, but I guess I am still looking for that "Happy Teriyaki" thickness and flavor...(it's a resturant chain in WA)

The kids love this one.  We use boneless, skinless breasts and drumsticks.  Very sticky, but very good.  Make the house smell delicious.

This was GREAT and so easy in the crockpot too!  The first time I made it I didn't have boneless skinless thighs, so I used bone in thighs with the skin on.  I doubled the sauce and loved them.  My son, not so much because of the bones and the skin.  I've made this a second time with boneless skinless thighs and now we are both happy!  GREAT recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing!

When I told him what was for dinner, my husband's first question was, "Am I going to like that?"  When I served it his comment was "You can make this anytime you want to!"  There wasn't a morsel of leftovers so I think I'll double the recipe next time.

I did this a bit differently. I cubed boneless skinless  chicken breasts, and just poured all the sauce over it. I covered the dish with foil (because I used brown sugar instead of white and I figured the dish would get crusty), and baked it at 375 for about 40 minutes. I served it over brown rice and I'll definitely be making it again!

This was fantastic! Tasted soo good! What I did differently was used chicken breasts, and cut them into cubes. That's how I usually eat teriyaki chicken at restaraunts. The chicken baked at 30 minutes (maybe cause I was using cubed pieces of chicken?). One reviewer said that her sauce didn't thicken.. mine thickened like honey! You should turn the heat up a little bit when cooking the sauce.. after it boils, set it aside to cool down a bit. It won't thicken while it's on the stove.. it needs to cool down. If you used the cornstarch, then it should thicken, no doubt! Luckily I had some extra sauce which I poured on the chicken after I took it out. If you don't have extra sauce, cook up some more! The chicken is not the same without the extra teriyake merinade! Remember to NOT use the leftover water/juice from when the chicken was baking! It can really make you sick!

Sauce never really thickened for me, but had great flavor. I doubled the sauce recipe per other's suggestions with the exception of the soy and Ginger. Additionally I used lite soy sauce and jarred minced garlic (all I had). I also took the suggestions of others and lined the pan with foil and covered with foil while baking. I used bonless skinless thighs and baked for 30 min at 400 with half the sauces poured on top. Then I flipped the chicken, poured the rest of the sauce on top and baked for another 30 min at 400. The chicken was super tender and clean up was a breeze. I served with steam Asian veggie medley and white rice.

Thought I'd try this basting way instead of my usual marinating then bake way. It turned out perfect! I used chicken leg quarters, reduced the sugar, soy and ginger a tad bit as other reviewers mention. Also when the skin starts to burn before the chicken is done, just cover loosely with foil.

Excellent tasting, easy meal.  I stir-fried broccoli and red bell pepper with some of the teriyaki sauce, adding a splash of sesame oil to them at the end of cooking, and served it over white rice next to the chicken.  Fantastic and easy!  Also used honey/brown sugar in they teriyaki sauce, and some ground red pepper.  Thanks for a keeper!

This was so yummy made as stated, except I had to reduce the oven temp to 175 C as the chicken pieces where starting to burn on original temp after 5 mins. Thanks so much, a KEEPER!!!

I used 1 whole chicken, doubled the sauce (except for the sugar) substituted pineapple juice in place of the water, added some pineapple chunks, and some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. Glad I did, it was great!

5 stars is not high enough for this! It is very good. The only change I made was useing brown sugar instead of granulated sugar after reading the reviews. I also like to use this sauce for stir fried green beens. I doubled it  & it was a huge hit! Defintly a keeper.

All gone! The whole family loved it. I did not change the recipe but I did change the way I tackled it. I don't have time to sit in the kitchen and brush/baste every 10 minutes. I made the sauce early in the day, let it cool slightly and put it in a gallon ziplock bag along with the thighs. It marinated in the fridge all day. When I was ready to cook, I poured everything into a glass pie dish (to keep the juice almost covering the chicken for moistness) and turned after 15 minutes. Only took another 15 min to cook thoroughly (30 min total). SO GOOD and much easier.

Chicken was pretty good. At first I was afraid the vinegar might be too overpowering but it turned out just fine, adding just the right bit of zing to the flavor. Like other reviewers, I added less sugar and a bit more garlic. I did not have a problem with the sauce thickening and made the amount of sauce the original recipe called for which was just enough. I'm not sure if I would call it teriyaki chicken though because it doesn't taste like the traditional japanese teriyaki chicken I've had at restaurants. If anything my own concoction of soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine tasted closer to the latter ( I might add this recipe to the site later so stay tuned) . I also took other reviewers' suggestion of baking the chicken for only 35 minutes which came out just right. I would make this again.

We adored this in our house! My boyfriend wants some of this sauce on hand at all times - to put on EVERYTHING!  I followed one suggestion about pouring it on and covering the dish, this is nice but the sauce didn't stay on the chicken very well, so we spooned some on at the end, removed the foil and broiled the chicken for a little bit

Pretty good! My fiance thought this was too sweet, but happily ate it anyways. :) I've had this recipe on my "to try" list for some time. I needed a quick-fix meal last night, so I decided to give this a try. The fact that, start to finish, this took under an hour to prepare AND called for basic ingredients I already had on hand, made this a winner! I pretty much followed Marian's directions exactly except for two changes. First, I used a package of three boneless, skinless chicken breasts (I HATE dark meat!) and low-sodium soy sauce (I was afraid that regular would be too salty). I lined my 9 x 9-inch baking dish with a double-thickness of aluminum foil for easy clean-up. I ended up baking first at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, basting/turning, then reducing the temp to 350 and baking for another 20 minutes, basting/turning every 10 minutes as directed. My only gripe is that my meat was a tad dry, but I don't blame that on the recipe (after all, I DID use breasts). Served with basmati rice, sugar snap peas and iced green tea, this was a decent Saturday night meal. Thanks for sharing! :-)

The sauce is very authentic tasting and easy to make.  I heated mine over medium heat, as it seemed to take forever on low!  Anyway, it saved time and was just as good.  I also poured all of the sauce (over eight thighs) and covered it with foil, baked on 500 for 15 minutes, then turned the oven down to 300 for 45 minutes.  I removed the foil and baked for an additional 15 minutes after mixing up the chicken and sauce.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  I make this when I get that craving for Chinese, but don't want all that MSG!  It's great with House Fried Rice

I thought it was a very easy, good weekday meal.  My 15-year-old loved it.  I think next time I may cut down slightly on the soy sauce.  I would definitely recommend using low-sodium soy sauce.

Oh boy was this Great! I wish I could give it 20 stars:) I was going to make this with chicken and had planned on it but they had country pork ribs on sale> .97 LB, and decided to go with those instead of the bird. Wow was this sauce Yummy! Sweet and salty. Perfect. Thank You, I will make this again and again!

I made this for the hubbs, and he loved it. This review is based entirely on him as I don't eat meat. I made double the sauce and used 4 leg quarters that were left over and couldn't fit on the grill. I also made it with less sodium soy sauce (Lite). He says that he liked this better than the meat that he cooked on the grill, he said it was the best Teriyaki Chicken he has ever had and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Will make again. I baked it for the first 30 minutes covered, and then placed remaining sauce on the chicken and cooked for another 30 minutes, uncovered as Valerie's Kitchen did.

This was delish! I fed it to 11 people on a total whim and got rave reviews from everyone. I doubled the sauce and had extra to put on the chicken at the table, and we also drizzled it on our steamed rice. I think this will become a regular on my menu :)

This was delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly except I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of bone-in (decreased cooking time), and lower sodium soy sauce (still was plenty salty).  As others suggested, I lined my pan with foil, then sprayed the foil with Pam (no cleanup!).  Poured all the sauce over the chicken and baked it; served with white rice and broccoli with some sauce drizzled on top.  So, so good-- don't hesitate to try this recipe!

This recipe was great! I made it for my boyfriends family and they LOVED it. I doubled the sauce as recommended by others. I also doubled the garlic and put in lots of extra ginger and added in a chopped scallion because I happened to have one. I split the sugar and did 1/2cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. Added a bit of red pepper flakes. I marinated the chicken for a few hours and then baked it and just cooked the marinade on the stove and basted the chicken a few times with it. This comes out sticky and saucy and YUMMY! I also threw in some skinless drumsticks that I found in the supermarket.

Delicious. I substituted Soy sauce ( too salty ) instead used teriyaki marinade. Used boneless skinless chicken thighs.   Also, because of other reviews, I put parchment paper in bottom of pan & covered chicken with foil. Definetely a Keeper!

Had to substitute apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar. Everything else stayed the same. This was a big hit with my children and husband. Served with rice and stir-fry veggies.

This is delicious!  My 12 y/o and 1 of my 4 y/o twins loved it even!  The super picky one ate it too...and that's saying alot!  It isn't something that I would be able to make during the week, because it takes a lot of time (not just throw in the oven and take it out in an hour), but its well worth the little bit of effort it takes!  Thanks for the recipe- it will be added to the rotation.

Although I make this at least every other week(BTW, my husband normally hates chicken but he loves this recipe) I don't bake it. I make the sauce, marinate the chicken in it for about 20 min. or so in the fridge while the grill warms up and then grill it. I don't baste the chicken on the grill. I disguard the sauce once I've put all the chicken on the grill.  I agree with everyone about doubling up on the sauce. I also serve the chicken cut up over a bowl of white rice. DELISH!!!!

I made the sauce exactly as the recipe states and my husband and I both thought the balance of sweet/tangy was perfect.  I put 6 thighs in a glass dish, basted with sauce, covered with foil and baked at 375 for 20 minutes.  I removed the foil and basted again, baked for 10 minutes uncovered.  In the last 10 minutes, I upped the oven temp to 400 and basted twice.  The chicken came out perfect and clean up was a breeze.  Paired with white rice and some broccoli, this was a fantastic weeknight dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Nice, easy recipe for teriyaki chicken!  I made it with lite soy sauce instead and will definitely do so next time.  I also used chicken breasts and baked them at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes.  Half way through, I flipped them over and basted them with more sauce.  As others have mentioned, definitely line your pan with tin foil!  Served with a modified version of Oven Brown Rice from this site and broccoli.  Will make again!

My family loved this recipe. I will be a permanent recipe in our collection.  I did not use the low-sodium soy sauce, but will next time.  It was salty, but not to bad.  I lined my pan with tin foil, and poured part of the sauce over then covered and baked for 30 minutes.  Then uncovered and poured the remaining sauce and baked for an additional 25min.  Wonderful.  The sauce is amazing.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a winner!  The sauce is super yummy.  I served it over broccoli and sesame noodles for a homemade noodle bowl.  I have tried lots of teriyaki recipes but have never been satisfied until finding this one.

Wow this was amazing!  I put about 1.5 lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs in a casserole dish, poured all the sauce in, covered with foil and baked at 425 for an hour, taking it out twice during cooking to cut the chicken into smaller pieces and stir, this was by far the easiest, tastiest recipe I have ever made!  Seriously just like what they serve in the restaurants.

I made this and it was very tasty.  I read other reviews and did use low-sodium soy sauce.  To accompany this, I made a mix of pineapple, sugar snap peas, water chestnuts, red bell pepper, and orange bell pepper.  After I cooked those, I drizzled a little bit of that teriyaki sauce from the chicken on the vegetables.  That mix of vegetables went very well together with the teriyaki chicken thighs.

Didnt have any cider vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar.  I also used boneless chicken tenderloins.  I doubled the sauce recipe and baked for 22 min covered in foil, flipped and baked another 22.  Absolutely the best teriyaki sauce I have had.  This is great!

Oh MAN, this was good. Whole fam loved it. I served it with a rice pilaf. I doubled as recommended by many and just poured the entire baking dish of chicken and sauce over the rice and served it right in the wok. Great! I forgot to take out the chicken from the freezer even. I just put the frozen chicken in the dish covered it with sauce and put it in the oven. It took longer of course but still tender and delicious. A meal worthy of a permanent place in the rotation for sure!

I don't see how people can say to use chicken breasts and to dump in all the sauce before you bake.  I tried that the first time and was left with bland chicken which while not bad, wasn't memorable.

This time we used thighs and brushed sauce on the meat every 10 minutes and it made all the difference in the world.  This is one case where the recipe is better left untouched.

The one thing I agree with from the comments, put some foil paper in your pan before you bake this.  Otherwise you are left with a mess of burnt sauce.

I have made this recipe a few times with following a couple of suggestions.  I always double the recipe to assure there is plenty of sauce.  I line the pan with foil and cover while cooking.  It comes out PERFECT every time!  This is a crowd pleaser!  Family and friends always ask for the recipe afterwards.

Very good and very easy. It was too hot last night to turn on my oven so I did this on the stovetop and added some water so it wouldn't burn. Mixed with broccoli, mushrooms, and served with rice.

Very Good. Served at a dinner for 25 people- it was a hit! and very easy. I doubled the sauce as suggested and used a combination of brown sugar and white sugar. Also I used fresh ginger. Used boneless skinleess breast and drumsticks. Baked in a diposable tray so clean up was a snap.

Very good.  Will definitely make again.  I used skinless, boneless thighs, so baked at 400 degrees - 20 min. covered and 20 minutes uncovered.  Also, I lined my baking dish with Reynolds non-stick foil...and I'm glad I did.  No mess.

I just made the teriyaki sauce to marinade some boneless breasts in for a while before I try my attempt at teriyaki here at home. This sauce is almost as good-if not better-than a lot of sauces I've had in Japanese restaurants! Thanks so much for sharing it with us!

Delicious!!! The only thing I did different was bake it at 375 and used low sodium soy sauce. I also made a fried rice recipe on this site to go with it. I will use this recipe again and again. My whole family loved it, even the kids =)

Great flavor.  I added onion and green peppers to a doubled recipe.  I especially like that this can be baked in the oven which makes this oriental recipe much less hectic than stir-frying.  Served with Jasmine rice.  My only cautions: don't add the full amount of soy sauce if you are watching salt levels, and you may not need to bake this for 60 min...so be sure to check on it early.

I made this with chicken breasts and doubled the sauce.  We had leftovers, so I made teriyaki chicken wraps. I used 1 Tbsp. melted butter and added a package of crushed ramen noodles and 2 Tbsp. sesame seeds.  Baked them in a 350 oven for 10 mins.  Then made the wraps by using chopped teriyaki chicken, shredded cabbage, and the noodle/sesame seed mixture.  Put them in a flour tortilla shell and topped them off with a little extra teriyaki sauce.  Absolutely delish!

Amazing. Doubled the sauce, but probably only needed to 1.5x the sauce because it made too much. I used 1/2 the sauce to marinate my chicken legs and theighs for 3 hours, then I drained it, lined a baking pan with foil, sprayed with PAM, added chicken, some sauce, baked covered up for 30 mins, then uncovered and topped with the rest of the sauce. YUM!

Delicious!!!  I marinated my chicken in a zip-loc bag with all the ingredients for 3 hours prior to baking.  Only change was I used brown sugar instead of white. Turned out fantastic.  However, I should've taken other folks' advice and used less sugar.  For the last 5 minutes I broiled my chicken because I like it drier.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it is just too salty with regular soy sauce. You definitely need reduced sodium soy sauce. But the over all sauce has a great flavor once you get past the saltiness. Will make again with reduced sodium soy sauce.

Believe the wonderful reviews!  I used four chicken breasts, pounded thin.  I didn't need to double the sauce at all, I would have had way too much.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup but otherwise made no changes, the sauce is absolutely delicious and I agree with others that it would be great on salmon and other meats.  THanks for a great recipe!

Made this last night and family loved it. Had to double the recipe and basting was out of the question, I have a 10 month old daughter. But I turned them over halfway through cooking and they were great! Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good, but not swoon-worthy.  I cooked bone-in thighs at 350 degrees for one hour and it glazed perfectly, and fell off the bone.  425 degrees is simply unnecessary.  I sprayed the pan with cooking spray, which made clean up easy after soaking the pan while having dinner.  I think I might like this better as a marinade for beef.  It really does have a teriyaki flavor.  For chicken I've got several other marinades I prefer.

fantastic teriyaki sauce!  We don't like dark meat chicken, so I used boneless skinless breasts.  I used low sodium soy sauce and did not have a problem with it being too salty.  After taking the sauce off the stove, I stirred in a SMALL amount of toasted sesame oil.  As some other reviewers recommended I doubled the sauce, and I also added some cut up FRESH (not canned) golden pineapple to the chicken in the dish before pouring the sauce over all.  Chicken was very tender! Next time I am going to use the sauce for beef.  Thinly slice some top sirloin, and lay the slices out in a baking pan, drenched with the sauce, and bake till tender.  Will be delicious folded up in some flatbread with sauteed green peppers and onions.

I have made this a few times now and each time it is all eaten up even though I make extras!  It is really easy to make but tastes as if you've spent all day cooking.  Definately use foil in your baking pan and then spray the pan foil - your clean-up will be much easier.  As others said, I doubled the sauce to have extra for rice.  If there is any left over I use it to make fried rice the next day.  This recipe is a definately a keeper! Thank you for sharing.

Delicious. This sauce is very tasty and I love the thickness. you absolutely need to double recipe. That ensures you have enough sauce to dribble over some sticky rice. I would not consider it spicy at all though. You could put crushed red pepper or Korean hot pepper paste to kick up the heat. My kids even enjoyed this and that is an achievement.

This was the first time I've made Teriyaki chicken and it turned out better than I expected!! It was really good, the only thing I didnt have was the ginger and it was still good. I used wings, thighs and legs for my chicken since that's all I had.You do have to keep rotating the chicken because the sauce will sit on the bottom of the pan. I will make this again!!

Awesome dish! My wife and I enjoyed it. I made the recipe exactly as written, just doubled the quantities so I had left overs. I had bone-in thighs, so I had to remove the bones. Whew! Next time, I buy the boneless thighs and save myself some time. This is a keeper, and has been added to the recipe book. 

Have made some notes though. DON'T use lite soy sauce b/c I can taste the difference from regular soy sauce. Use half brown and half white sugar. Use ground garlic so that it dissolves in the liquid better. Otherwise, that's it. 

EXCELLENT RECIPE!! THANKS!

The teriyaki sauce was superb!  This does not need an hour to bake, though.  Check it frequently after 30 minutes.  Depending on how thick your pieces of chicken are, you may not need nearly an hour.

This was just ok.  I think because it really needs a grilled flavor to be Teriyaki.  As is, it is a good marinade or sauce for chicken.  It seemed like a lot for the pan, however and my chicken ended up more boiled than baked, so I took it out of the sauce and put it under the broiler to finish it up.

I've used this recipe at least once a month for over a year - everyone in my family loves it that much!  The last time I made it I was out of ginger so I subbed in 1/2 teaspoon of Chinese Five Spice - and they loved it even more.  Instead of doing the baste every ten minutes, I pour have the sauce over the chicken, bake for 30 minutes, flip the chicken, pour the rest of the sauce, and bake 30 minutes more.

I made the sauce and then put it over chicken breasts.  As other users suggested, I covered with foil for 15 minutes and then did another 10 minutes uncovered.  I re-brushed chicken every ten minutes with sauce. Great taste, my husband insisted we use the sauce in a stir-fry. So last night we used the sauce in a beef stir fry.  Excellent flavor, I omitted the white sugar and added 1/4 cup brown instead.  It's sweet enough!

Delicious!  Like others, I covered with foil for the first half of baking.  Thighs came out moist and flavorful.  The remaining sauce was excellent with brown rice and broccoli.  I don't think I would cook them as long next time because they were slightly overdone.  I didn't add the ginger and didn't miss it at all.  This is definitely going into the regular rotation at the request of my very picky boyfriend.  He even asked for it again just a couple days after I made it!

Made this a few nights ago, and WOW !!! Followed the basic recipe, kinda. As per other reviewers, I doubled the sauce, used brown & white sugars, cubed the chicken(4 boneless, skinless breasts) prior to baking, and added chunked onion, bell pepper, canned pineapple(drained) and water chestnuts. Served over white rice. What an AWSOME recipe Marian!!! Thank-you for sharing !!!!
Most definatly a keeper in this house!!

Instead of baking the sauce onto the chicken, I just pour the sauce over some already cooked grilled chicken.  Since I did not bake the chicken with the sauce, the teriyaki sauce turned out too thick and sticky so I thinned this out with a couple extra tablespoons of water at the end.  And as other reviewers suggested, I used brown sugar instead of the white. I served this with rice and some grilled onions and peppers.  I also topped it with fresh cilantro and that added color to the plate and a refreshing bite to the dish.

I grilled it instead of baking it.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and marinated them in a large ziplock with the Teriyaki sauce for a few hours before placing them on kabob skewers and grilling.  Delicious!

I used seasoned chicken leg quarters instead of thighs, and used 4 cloves of garlic.  I opted to grill the chicken instead of baking it.  I grilled it with skin on directly over medium-medium high heat for 10 minutes (no sauce) then finished cooking them over indirect heat for another 45-50 minutes. I started basting with the sauce during the last 20 minutes of cooking.  Served this with corn pudding, and southern style green beans.  A big hit!

Excellent!  Took other reviewers advice and used a foil lined pan.  Great idea!  I used boneless skinless thighs and baked for 30 minutes.  I did reduce the sugar by almost half too.

Very good, so easy to make and this cooked fast in the oven too. I used boneless breasts and baked them for thirty min at 425. I made 4 and lined an 8x8 baking dish with aluminum foil and so glad I did since the sauce leaves a dark sticky glaze and clean-up would have been a mess otherwise. I used teriaki sauce instead of soy. Great dish. Thanks, we'll have this again.

Oh my goodness....this recipe is the best I have ever had. I made it exactly as written and it was fabulous. I did line my baking sheet with foil and it really helped. Next time I will be making the thighs on the grill. Very good. Even my son who loves barbecued things loved this more. It is a keeper and very easy. I did put foil on the pan for the first 30 minutes. Very moist. You will love it.

This is a delicious recipe and makes a beautiful meal. My husband actually said it looks like something from a fancy place...lol. I followed the advice of a few and used foil to cover, however after the first 30 minutes I noticed that it wasn't getting sticky so I took the foil off for the remaining time. It was perfect. Better than any that you would get out.

This was very good and super easy to make.  I only had 6 bone-in, skin-on thighs but these weighed 2-1/2 to 3 lbs total.  I didn't bother to remove the skin and I left the sauce ingredients the same which allowed enough sauce to spoon over the steamed rice.  I started my thighs in the pan skin side down so that they would finish skin side up and form a nice crispy coating.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We're NEVER ordering in teriyaki chicken ever again!  Why would you need to with this fantastic recipe?!

Wwwwwwooooooow. 

I used two chicken breasts and poured almost all of the sauce (we didn't have cider vinegar so I used white vinegar) right onto the chicken (both sides) and then baked it for 35 minutes (at 425)....AMAAAAAAAAAAAZING!

We were starving by the time everything was done, but it was well worth the wait!! My husband was very happy ;) And I'm going to pass this on to the rest of my family and friends.  

Thank you!  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a delicious teriyaki sauce base.  Next time I make it I think I will do the chicken on the grill and baste with the sauce.  In the oven, the sauce mixed with the pan juices and became too thin, so the chicken didn't have as much teriyaki flavor as it could have.

Loved this recipe! I only made it with 4 chicken thighs for 2 people and it was simply delicious. What I like about this recipe is that it takes no additional work if you make it for a crowd as well! So if I even have a party or something this is really good because you can easily make a lot and just stick it in the oven! I served it with brown rice and salad.

A good taste and flavor. Great sauce to go with rice! My husband loved the leftovers, and actually said it tasted more like Chicken adobo from his childhood, so he calls it by that. I did half white and brown sugar as rec'd, next time I will try bbq'ing this. I have a phobia with this recipe, however, since my oven smoked while baking this at 425 degrees, and lit all my smoke alarms! Still the dish remained in tact, and I'll just have to get someone to fix my oven! Thanks.

This was awesome. Used chicken breasts cut into 1 3/4" strips. I followed a few tips from several of the reviews. I doubled the sauce recipe and still only used about half the sugar; it was still quite sweet. I added a few dashes of red pepper flakes to give it a subtle kick. Also, the tin foil lining for the baking pan is a must!!!! I placed the chicken in the foil-lined pan and poured all the sauce over the top so that the chicken was pretty much engulfed. Baked for 30 minutes at 425 degrees, turned the chicken, removed the foil and baked for an additional 15 minutes. I am going to make it again for sure!!!

I doubled the sauce and basically let the thighs "swim" while they baked.  Absolutely deliciious!!  The whole famiily loved this and hubby took the left-overs for lunch the next day.  His co-workers were so jealous!  I made fried rice, egg rolls (frozen), steamed dumplings, and noodles to complement the delicious teriyaki!!  Definite do-again!!!

This recipe far exceeded my expectations! I followed the recipe except I added 2 heaping tablespoons of garlic chopped, halved the soy sauce, and added 3/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. I put thighs and legs in the crock pot, and I wanted a little more quantity of sauce so it wouldn't burn, so I added the apple sauce. It worked great: didn't dilute the flavor of the sauce, and kept it from burning. Cooked in crock pot on high for 5 hours and served the sauce over brown rice on the side. AWESOME! Can't wait to make it for company.

I followed the recipe as written and it was fantastic.  I used drumsticks and thighs.  My only suggestion is to start them skin down so the last 1/2 hour the skin gets crispy.  My 7 year old son is a teriyaki freak and he loved this!!

"Simply the best!" This sauce was NOTHING LIKE BOTTLED! So authentic and homemade. My only changes were: 3 boneless skinless chicken breast(only 2 of us eating), added 2tbs of brown sugar, 1tbs pineapple juice, 5 pineapple slices, and 1/2 seeded sliced green pepper. I served my chicken with white rice and steamed veggies. Super delicious and easy! Thanks so much for an awesome recipe. I will be making this again in the future!!!

YUMMY, I served this for a dinner party, I baked the boneless chicken breasts according to the directions but doubled the sauce in order to coat the veggies I served with it and topped the chicken with a slice of pineapple.  Chicken was a little dry, I'll try covering it next time.  I stir fried red peppers, zucchini, and yellow squash , the veggies with the sauce were great by them selves.   It was a great success.

Tried this today, and so glad I did!  I doubled the sauce as others mentioned, using 1/2 dark brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and spooned it over chicken pieces to start, then basted once before turning, and twice after turning. I did not cover, but did bake about 15 minutes longer (in my unpredictable 1954 oven!) and they came out delectably tender. As I am serving them tonight, I have placed chicken and sauce from the pan into a large ziplock bag in fridge till later - I hope this might allow the teriyaki flavor to permeate the chicken even more, as it has EXCELLENT flavor. Just the right amount of sweetness for our tastes. PLEASE DO line pan with HEAVY-DUTY foil...I did, and so glad others mentioned it!

First time cooking with boneless thighs. Don't know why I waited so long. This was wicked good. I didn't have regular soy sauce, just dark soy sauce so I think that made it a little more intense than intended. Tasted fabulous, though. Will def make again but use regular soy sauce. I also added 3 cloves of garlic just because I love it.

I cooked this for my friends and they LOVED it (one is a very picky eater)!  I followed the recommendation of another user and used foil to line the pan and to cover the chicken-- made cleaning easy and meat tender.  Friends were quite impressed that the teriyaki sauce was made from scratch.  I'll definitely make this again!

1,089 reviewers can't be wrong. The only substitution I made was using Splenda instead of sugar. My only complaint is that I should have doubled the recipe. We served it over steamed rice and having more of that incredible sauce to pour over the rice would have been great. Loved it. Thanks.  That was over a year ago. Yesterday I decided to make it again, but read some of the newer comments. This time I did double the sauce, but also added a can of drained pineapple chunks, sliced water chestnuts, a handful of snow peas and chunks of green bell pepper to the sauce as I cooked it. I lined my pan with parchment paper and cleanup was a snap. Then I poured all of the sauce with all of the chunky things over the chicken and baked uncovered for about 45 minutes. Served over rice. All I can think to say is OMG. It was incredible. Deserves more than 5 stars.

Oh my!! Sooo delicious! The chicken was incredibly tender, falling apart. I forgot to baste with the sauce every 10 minutes, as the directions said (I did it a total of 3 times), and it was still wonderful! Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!!

Awesome recipe!! Even my picky kids love this EASY dish. I use boneless skinless thighs and bake for 40 min. Comes out perfect every time. I took the advice of another reviewer, use foil on the bottom of baking dish and cover with foil. Clean up is a snap!! Will make again and again.

This was super easy and tasty. The family gave it 4 to 4.5 stars. I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and I followed another reviewers suggestions. I doubled the sauce. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I poured most of the sauce over the chicken, covered with foil and baked for 30 minutes. Removed foil, turned chicken, poured the rest of sauce over the chicken and baked another 20 minutes. I might try baking uncovered the   whole time next time to see if the sauce gets a bit more "sticky". Thank you reviewers for your suggestions and thank you, Marian, for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This was great, but it tastes almost the same as the Caramelized Baked Chicken that's also on this site, and the latter is much easier to make. The only difference in taste was that this one was somewhat sour.

Wow!  Again, another great recipe with common ingredients and easy instructions.  My husband and I order teriyaki chicken when we go out.  Now I have a recipe to make at home.  My hubby and kids loved it!  I used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I covered with foil and baked at 375 for 25 min. each side.  Five stars and one word:  wonderful!

Terrific sauce! I dissolved the cornstarch in the cold water first and once it was gloppy i added 3 TBSP of orange juice. I used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and 1/2 a cup of white sugar, i substituted rice vinegar for the apple cider vinegar.  double the amount of garlic, used dark soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce. And a splash of lemon juice. Instead of baking the chicken breast, I dry rubbed it with a little seasoning, chopped into chunks and then I sauteed it on a griddle with seasame seeds and and green onions basting the chicken with the sauce about every 5 minutes until it carmelized.  served over authentic chinese rice with stir fried broccoli,water chestnuts, bean sprouts peppers, and mushrooms.  My boyfriend loved it and so did the baby, she started kicking all over the place. Way better than any teriyaki i've had, esp. since I usually pay $10 at the one in the mall since they were always my favorite.

This is a tasty, easy recipe, but if your using chicken breasts to cut the fat and calories, I'd suggest lowering the temp. to *375.  Chicken breast really dry out at the higher temp in the recipe.  I usually serve this with coconut rice and a veggie.  Kids love it!

Very good sauce and much healthier than the bottled stuff.  Definitely use chicken with skin-on to get a good caramelization while baking.  Best made with chicken thighs w/skin served over sticky rice and a side of steamed baby bok choy.  Simple and so good.

My family loved this recipe. The only changes I made were to use boneless, skinless chicken breast and substituted brown sugar for the granulated sugar. I didn't double the sauce, but next time I will and will serve with rice. Will definitely be making this recipe again!

Excellent.  I used skinless/boneless breasts instead of thighs and it baked for about 25 minutes until done, using my meat thermometer.  I can't wait to try this sauce on the grill.  Yum!

Good! Double the sauce part if you want to serve it over rice. I added crushed pineapple to it, just because I had some to use up, and it was good, but I think it would still have been tasty without the pineapple.

This was so easy!  I made the sauce a few hours early and marinated the chicken while it finished defrosting.  My husband and 2 young kids loved it.  The only change I made with the sauce was that I used half white sugar and half brown.

Very good Teriyaki sauce!  The chicken was great, but a little tedious to keep brushing on the chicken.  Next time I will marinade the chicken in the sauce for a few hours, with some sauce reserved to brush on once during baking.  We use this sauce to marinade our steak in now.  It's wonderful!

My 2yr old daughter who refuses to eat meat LOVED this!  I used lite soy sauce and lined the pan with tin foil.  I also added chunky pineapple to the pan and poured the rest of the sauce in...I did not brush it over the chicken every 10mins and it still turned out wonderfully! Definately a keeper!

Not worth the trouble.  Putting chicken leg quarters on the grill and basting with your own homemade BBQ sauce or a good store bought one is simpler and more practical.  
If you are going to go to the trouble on this one definitely line the pan with foil.

Great recipe!  My husband said this was the best chicken he's ever had.  I think it would go perfectly with the Chinese Cabbage Salad from this website.

Excellent marinade.  My cousin made the marinade and we put it on fresh shrimp on skewers.  It was so good!  We generally triple the recipe, and I pour it over chicken breasts and keep them in the freezer for quick meals.  The marinade itself keeps nicely in the fridge.  Thank you for sharing!

Awesome!  My husband and I ate nearly all of this in one sitting!  Make sure you use a metal pan, though or the sauce will caramelize.  My husband used a glass dish and it had to soak for days before I could scrub it clean.

This was a tasty dish even though I made a few alterations. I did not have ginger so I eliminated it.  I also used Teriyaki sauce instead of Soy.  I used a whole cut up chicken instead of just thighs.  The wings came out the best so perhaps next time I make it, I will just use the wings.

Hands down, this is the best teriyaki sauce I've ever had.  I cooked the chicken on the grill after marinating it in the sauce for two hours, and basted it during cooking with additional sauce.  Heaven!

Fantastic flavor and the chicken cooked perfectly.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to line the pan with foil, as it took forever to clean up!

When I was simmering the ingredients in the saucepan, my husband complained about the smell.  Made it twice just to be sure I did it right and even though it did smell the same, I charged ahead and put it on the chicken anyway.  Thank goodness I did!  This is one of the prettiest dishes (and now a favorite of my husband's.) I have ever made.  Also, I had doubled the recipe for a party and it was a huge hit all around and very easy.

Delicious!  We all loved it.  The sauce was a little different than I had anticipated.  I'm not sure what it was -- spicier? tangier?  Whatever it was, it really made this sauce stand out.  Since I used boneless chicken breasts, they only cooked for about 20 minutes.  I halved the amount of meat but made the full sauce amount to pour over brown rice and stir-fried vegetables.

This was very good. I tasted the sauce before baking and was terrified. But after baking with the chicken it was great. I doubled the sauce and added an extra clove of garlic. The sauce was way too much and I ended up only using maybe half. Also used a bit less sugar and used a big squeeze of honey. Served the sauce over white rice. The kids said it was awsome and it "rocked". Next time I'm going to try marinating the chicken as it didn't have much terriyaki flavor inside the chicken.

This recipe was soooo good.  Perfect balance of tangy and sweet.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I served over white rice and stir fried green beans.  Thanks to the other reviewers about the foil lining tip.  That was definitely helpful!

My family enjoyed this, but I have to say I made a few changes.  I added more cornstarch as the sauce was too thin, I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and I cooked this on the stove top.  Made the sauce in a non stick, heavy stock pot.  Browned cut up thigh pieces in a dutch oven in hot EVOO, drained the meat, returned it to the dutch oven and poured the sauce over the meat.  Simmered for about 10 minutes, added broccoli and thin, diagonally sliced carrots and green onions and cooked for 5 more minutes.  I served it over fried rice and it was great.

Delicious and easy to make.  I used skinless whole chicken, cut up, and it still was wonderful.  Important to baste every 10 minutes for the last 1/2 hour.  I used extra garlic cloves, which I mash with a garlic crusher, its much easier than dicing with a knife.

I cannot say enough about how yummy this recipe is!  I will double the sauce next time! I didn't bother brushing the sauce on every 10 minutes-I just dumped it all on & covered it with foil!  The chicken was very tender!

Great recipe. I substituted brown sugar for white. I used 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into pieces in a lined glass dish, cooked it for 35 minutes. I drained the juices from the pan, returned it to the stove, added some more brown sugar, soy sauce and ginger and reduced it over low heat until it was very thick and used it for a dipping sauce.

This was very tasty. I just served it over plain rice, I should have served it over stir fried vegetables. I also just mixed up the ingred in a bowl and poured over chicken I did not put it on the stove first and the sauce was still thick.

The terriyaki sauce has a perfect flavor. Don't, as some reviewers say, cook in a covered casserole sauce. I did it this way once, and the sauce turned to water. Still tasted good, but the texture is MUCH better when you follow the basting instructions.

Teriffic! Instead of basting the chicken every 10 minutes, I poured the sauce on top and baked it in a covered casserole dish for 45 minutes.  I used boneless chicken thighs.  I think the thighs are the key in the success of this recipe.  Chilcken breast would come out very dry.

So easy and so delicious! #1 thing to do is line your baking dish with foil! This is very necessary otherwise you will be scraping away at sugar that has been burnt onto the glass. I made a revision that changed the taste and made it sooo much better than it already is. I toasted three tablespoons of sesame seeds (easy to do, heat pan on high toast seeds for two minutes each side) and mixed it in when the sauce was done cooking. Delicious! Thank you.

EXCELLENT! I used boneless chicken breasts instead and split them down the center. I also changed the recipe to 10 servings. I cooked them on 425 degrees but only cooked the chicken breasts 20 minutes each side instead of 30 minutes each side. It was delicious!!!!!! I think this might be a weekly thing for me! lol

This tasted great! I used chicken breasts instead of the chicken thighs and substituted red wine vinegar in place of the cider vinegar (because it was all I had on hand). Great recipe.

SPECTACULAR! MARVELOUS! DELICIOUS!  This chicken is SOOO tender!  I did follow the advice of others and lined my pan with tin foil.  I also baked it in a casserole dish that had a lid, this eliminated the basting.  P.S.  Despite the gripes of other cooks that said that the sauce took too long to make, I only found that it took about 10 minutes...they must have really been in a hurry!!  :)

What a wonderful recipe!  We have never cared for bottled teriyaki sauce, so I'm very pleased that I found this one. I thought perhaps that I needed to double the recipe, but actually there was plenty for the chicken. The only thing I added was some red hot pepper flakes, and that really "lit it up". I'm anxious to try it on some grilled salmon, I think that would be wonderful. Thanks Marian for a super recipe.

I found this recipe while looking for something to do with the chicken thighs I bought on sale at the grocery store.  My husband doesn't eat anything that sounds Asian since he claims not to like it, so I just didn't tell him that this was "teriyaki" chicken and he really enjoyed it!  I made the recipe as directed except I left out the ginger since I'm not a fan.  I also skinned the thighs.  I baked it in an oven bag - clean up was easy and I didn't have to keep brushing the sauce over top.  This was moist, yummy and is now in regular dinner rotation in my house!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I've used it many times on chicken breasts and on beef.  It is one of our family's all time favorites.  My husband is a garlic fiend so we add at least 5 cloves of garlic which makes it perfect for us.  Thank you for sharing this one!

This sauce was delicious and very easy to make.  I used boneless chicken breast baked in the oven with the sauce poured over it, saving a little to use over rice and Veggies(broccoli, water chestnuts and carrots).  Just wonderful!!  Will make again!

We have a new favorite!!!!! This was the best chicken I have ever eaten. Husband and son both loved it also. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar and added just a splash of pineapple juice. This is definitely going to be a weekly thing at my house. I used boneless skinless breasts, and made sure I brushed with the sauce often as the recipe stated. Try it, I promise you'll love it as much as we did!!

This is the second time we've tried this recipe, and this time it turned out much better. This time I did 1/4c. white and 1/4c. brown sugar and then added some pineapple juice also.  I also cooked the thighs in an oven bag with all the sauce. I only had 3 thighs so they were covered in the sauce. It was great!  The last time I followed the recipe exactly but with chicken breasts and I think this recipe tasted better the second time around with dark meat.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because I had to change it around some, but it is really good!

A delicious homemade teriyaki sauce.  When I made it my chicken was a little dry because I didn't brush it often enough, so be sure to follow that part exactly.  Very good taste though.

DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe except to use brown sugar instead of white (makes a much richer teriyaki in my opinion) and since I only has distilled white vinegar, I only used 1/8 C instead of 1/4 C. Served with fried rice and had no leftovers! Deifintely a keeper!

This was tasty.  I also used 5 boneless breasts cut into 1/3s and baked (at 425o for about 25 minutes) them with 2/3s of the sauce.  I watered down the remaining sauce and thickened a bit to use as a dipping sauce or to drizzle on the rice.  The whole family enjoyed this -- even the 5 and 6 year olds!

Fabulous! I absolutely loved the sauce on this. Better than any homemade teriyaki sauce I've found and just as good, if not better, than any bottled sauce I've used. My whole family loved this, my husband ate the leftovers the next day and he never eats leftovers.  I used skinless chicken breasts I brushed them with sauce and turned them every 10 minutes or so. I cooked them at 400 for 35 mintues. Perfect! Served with rice and sugar snap peas. Will look forward to making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Simple as could be. Made it last night for us and she loved it. Just keep an eye on the chicken in the second half hour. I cooked according to directions (keep brushing), but cut the second 30 minutes down to 20. Skinless Chicken Thighs with the bone-in. Came out juicy and perfectly cooked. A definite keeper recipe.

Great teriyaki sauce! I used a whole cut up chicken and I dont think it turned out as well as just thighs. I am going to try it with dark meat next time.

This was the best teri sauce I've ever made, which is saying a lot as I live in Hawaii and have made A LOT of teri sauce!!
My changes were:
1/8 c. brown sugar, 1/8 c. reg. white sugar & 1/4 c. Splenda (cooking kind). Used white vinegar as I was out of apple cider vinegar, BUT... stirred in 4 oz. apple sauce for that flavor. I only use 'low sodium' Aloha shoyu (soy sauce). And I used 1 inch fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated. I didn't add the cornstarch until later. I mixed up the sauce, used it to marinate my raw chicken for 6 hrs. Then, while they were grilling, I brought the marinade to a boil for 2 mins. (you must do this to kill any bacterial from the raw chicken). Then I added the cornstarch that I had mixed cold water into, making a 'slurry'. Turned down the heat and stirred constantly until correct thickness. Removed from heat, covered & served with grilled chicken & 'sticky white rice' (made with Calrose rice... the way we like it over here)and kernel corn on the side. 
Amazing! Thanks for this winner of a recipe!

This was an excellent and flavorful dish!  Got rave reviews in my house, and will be used over and over again.  I cut the chicken into chunks and poured the sauce over the top.  Great with rice.  Thank you for a "keeper".

Fast, easy and tasty. A good choice for a weeknight. I used wings and boneless breasts and they cooked in about half an hour. I served this with rice and a packaged Oriental salad, and dinner was on the table in about 40 minutes from start to finish.

Not only is this teriyaki chicken the best I've ever had, it is fairly simple to make and the ingredients are all things I generally have in my pantry.  The chicken turns out so flavorful and so juicy that you can eat it all by itself.  I used boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs and baked them for 30 minutes instead of an hour with the sauce poured all over them.  I turned and basted them every ten minutes.  They could not have turned out better.

This recipe is awesome!  My entire family loved it so I made it for a party and the chicken was a definite hit.  The only change I made was to add fresh ginger and I made 20 pounds of chicken for the party and had to make a triple batch of sauce. The previous advice about lining the pans was excellent - helped me a lot with clean up.  Thank you so much for submitting such a great recipe!

We make this recipe all of the time. By using inexpensive cuts of chicken (we use thighs and drumsticks), you could have a cheap, quick and easy weeknight dinner.

This sauce is amazing although I made a few tweaks. I added 1 cup orange juice to the sauce (scaled to serve 3, added a little more corn starch to thicken it, 3 cloves garlic and used 2 chicken legs. I found the extra liquid was perfect and added a great flavour to the chicken. 425 was way too high in my oven to cook the chicken so I turned it down to 350.  
Fantastic sauce! I will definatley try it with pork chops next time!
Thanks for the great recipe.

This was an awesome receipe.  My guests were late and the supper was overcooked, but the chicken was still moist.  I threw the extra sauce right in the pan to cook with the chicken. I was great.  I would definately use this one again. I will try chicken breasts next time.

I'm very impressed! This was absolutely delicious! I also used plain vinegar and poured the whole marinade in at once. I did let it marinate for appr. 3 hours turning them once. Will use this marinade for teriyaki chicken cordon blue.

I made this a couple nights ago and turned out nicely!  I did cover the pan in foil, which saved alot of clean up time.  Also, I cut down the sugar a little bit after reading the reviews.  I served it with fried rice.  My husband just cut his up and ate it mixed in with the rice.  Husband said he really liked it!  I will make it again!

The teriyaki sauce is very good and can be used to baste other meats.  I used boneless chicken breasts instead of the chicken thighs.  Because I was in a big hurry while making dinner, I took some of the left over marinade and mixed it with a can of baked beans.  It was pretty good.

In a word, delicious.  The sauce was exceptional.  I used red wine vinegar, lite soy sauce, granulated fructose instead of sugar (used about 3/4 of a cup for the double batch of sauce I made instead of a full cup), made a double batch of sauce, set the oven to 375, lined the pan in foil, added a couple of extra skinless thighs, and the recipe was done in 50 minutes.

I served brown rice with this and spooned the sauce over the rice.  I also boiled some delicious corn cobettes.  We also had a little cottage cheese on the side - overall, a very hearty and delicious meal.  Thanks to all who offered additional suggestions - they were all worthwhile.

While I did brush sauce on the chicken every ten minutes, I wish more of the sauce had penetrated inside the chicken.  Maybe that's to much to ask without marinating.  Next time, I will serve individual sides of sauce which would be used to dip the chicken for added flavor.  The sauce is clearly the highlight of this recipe.  Good stuff Maynard.

This was really good.  I did use less sugar than stated in the recipe and I baked  chicken breasts for  40 min. instead of 60 min.  I then cut the breasts up into chunks and served over rice, broccoli, water chestnuts and pineapple topped with extra sauce I had reserved.  This was a great and simple recipe.  Thanks.

I use this teriyaki sauce as a base for everything.  I especially like to add it to stir fried sliced chicken along with Asian-Style frozen vegetables and serve it all over rice!

This was SO good! We need more than five stars here! The sauce was delicious and it doubled easily (recommended). What a delicious combination of flavors. My only substitutions were to use regular vinegar and lower-sodium soy sauce, and it turned out great. I pour the entire amount of sauce on at once and let it bake until the chicken is done - so easy this way. Be sure to line your pan with a double layer of foil for easy clean-up. I serve it with sticky rice and broccoli - the family LOVES this and requests it often.

This recipe was very good.  My whole family liked it which is incredible because my husband is very picky about food.  I reduced the sugar as suggested by some and it worked out great.  I also substitued breasts for thighs.  I think if I'd you'd thighs it would have been great!  The breast meat came out a little dry.

Excellent over rice! Definitely a keeper! I make this recipe about once a month, and have learned to lower the oven temp a little (to about 375), and just keep brushing on the sauce every 10 min. until the edges of the chicken just start to get a little burned. I use 3 or 4 chicken breast halves instead of thighs, and reserve about 1/2 of the sauce to drizzle over the chic. when done.

My Husband and I Loved it!!!  The only draw back is that it is messy if you use bone in chicken and aren't shy about eating with your hands!!  I did take some of the previous suggestions and cut the sugar down a bit..and added some honey in it's place.  We are garlic freaks, so I used more garlic.  I also found that my sauce didn't want to thicken up quite right so I added a bit more cornstarch.....  It was wonderful and great leftover, I will be making it again!  Yummy Yummy!  Thanks :)

Too much pepper in the sauce, and I think it is cooked at too high a temperature, making the meat tough.  Great with sticky rice though.

Very good.  Watch it though, if you are using boneless breasts.  They cook in only about 20-25 minutes...if you let them go longer they are VERY dry.  The sauce is yummy though.

I was a bit reluctant to try this recipe...as I already have my own very good teriyaki recipe.  But I must say, this sauce is very good!!!  My boyrfriend said it tasted a bit like the mandarin chicken sauce from Panda Express.  The chicken was a bit bland but the sauce recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is really a great recipe.  I used the same amount of sauce with six thighs.  The basting really helped.  Very yummy.  I will definately make this again.  One tip:  the pan is a mess, so soak and soak early.

Like others have said before, the cooking time is a little long.  I bake it at 400 for 10 minutes, and an additional 20-25 at 350.  This way it turns out nice and juicy.  Otherwise, it's a favorite!

This made the best chicken I have ever tasted!!!
I poured pineapple juice over the chicken (boneless skinless breasts) before adding the sauce and then put a pineapple ring on each piece of chicken for about the last 20 minutes of cooking.  Excellent!!  I'm about to try to sauce on pork chops!!!

very good.  However, I cooked it at 350 for 40 min as I could only imagine what it would look like if I cooked it for the whole time.

AWESOME!!  I made this recipe for my parents.  Little did I know that they did not care for Teriyaki.  They raved about this recipe.  I will use it again. I used low sodium soy sauce.

This was fantastic!!!  I thought it was wonderful, but I would re-name it Sticky Teriyaki Chicken.  As soon as the sauce cooled, it was extremely sticky and thick.  I used aluminum foil for quick and easy clean up.  Make sure the utensils and plates get into hot, soapy water as soon as possible.  It is definitely worth the mess to clean up.  It can be an elegant, easy dinner for guests with white rice and broccoli.

This is the best thing I have eaten lately.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into chunks and sauteed until brown.  I then added the sauce and served over rice--turned out so great.  I am making this for dinner again tonight.  This sauce would also be good over buffalo wings.

I think there's a 100 degree error in this recipe. I first tried it at 450 as the recipe states and got Chicken Teriyaki ashes! Then I tried it at 350 and it was fine. Makes you wonder about all the rave reviews. How could all those folks be so fond of burned chicken??? Hmmm....

Great flavor.  Modifications:  I combined the sauce ingredients & reduced as directed, but then I simply poured the sauce over the chicken (breasts) in a sous vide bag and cooked them that way.  Then a final saute in a pan to give them a nice texture.

UM THIS IS AMAZING! My husband and I LOVE it with rice and broccoli. I did double the sauce as others suggested. It only takes 45 minutes to get to an internal temperature of 165 degrees- and I can't wait the full hour to eat this :)

I only made slight technique changes, everything else was right where it should have been. The sauce had a great balance of sweet and tangy. I chose to marinate 6 skinless chicken thighs in a 1/4 cup of the prepared sauce overnight. I cooked as directed. Marinating allowed the flavor to really penetrate rather than just having a surface flavor. Also I would NOT recommend covering as other posts suggest. This sort of dish really benefits from the build up of the layers of caramelizing sauce to bring out the proper flavor profile. Awesome recipe, thanks!!

My only changes were half white half brown sugar and putting it in the slow cooker. It was very good. Used pounded boneless, skinless chicken breast. My husband thanked me for making it. Will make again. Will make it again....

The recipe is really for a Teriyaki marinara sauce that works for the oven or for a grill.  But it gives a sweet soy sauce type flavor.  I followed the instructions and cooked in the oven since it was my first time making it.  Setting the oven at 425 ensures the chicken will be done, and it was not overcooked.

I served it with fried rice, but I'm sure it goes good with anything.

What I really like about the instructions, is that tells you exactly what to add and how long to cook.  Just follow the instructions and it will turn out great!!

Super easy recipe!!  I made mine in the slow cooker & it turned out great!   I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cooked it on high for about 3 hours & it was SO tender & juicy!    Everyone loved it - will definitely be making this one again!

So incredibly delicious:) I took some people’s advice and used white and brown sugar. I used fresh boneless chicken breasts and it turned out amazing:) my family didn’t talk for the whole supper all I heard was utensils off the plates! And my crew is picky and this is a definite winner here :) served with white rice and mixed vegetables

I love this recipe!  I used the recipe out of the Allrecipes magazine and it was different in that it did call for lite soy sauce for less sodium..I did use the thighs and it was amazing.  It's a keeper!

Made it exactly as written and it was great!  Very tasty; next time I’ll add some red pepper flakes for a little more “zip”; I also had the thought that those who are concerned about processed sugar could always leave out the sugar and add some crushed pineapple.  It would sweeten it and thicken it!

Excellent dish!!! I cooked this for dinner last night using boneless, skinless chicken thighs that I had absolutely no idea what to do with. I didn't want another standard bland chicken recipe and after searching I stumbled upon this recipe. My family LOVED this recipe and asked that it be added to the rotation. I however, grilled my chicken on a gas grill and then basted it and set it back on the grill for a few minutes on each side. The end result was pure delight. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This was really wonderful.  I had frozen chicken pieces to deal with so that probably changed things. I agree with others that the sauce should be doubled. Also the temperature is a bit extreme, it caramelized the sauce making for a nightmare cleanup. I'd advise 350 degrees like every other chicken recipe. But after prying the chicken out of the carmelized and burnt sauce it wasn't too bad.

First of all, this is quite delicious and the whole family loved it. I made one BIG change (as someone mentioned in their review) and just added everything to the crock pot. Placed the chicken in first then blended all the ingredients and poured over. Cooked about 4 hours on low then added in 2 cups of frozen Asian style veggies, and a small can of pineapple tidbits (then let that cook for about an hour). Served over rice, and it was simply wonderful

I make this more than any other recipe on AllRecipes so I figured I should probably rate it.  It is excellent as-written. I don't change a thing. I have never made double-sauce and I have never felt that it needed it.  I usually do try to baste the chicken with the sauce/juices a few times while baking, but I have forgotten to do this on some occasions (and I rarely do it every 10 minutes as suggested) and it still turns out great.

I made 6 chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces, and made the sauce times four. I saw the green onions in some of the pictures and gave them a try. I thought the green onions/scallions added a lot of flavor. This recipe is better than most!!

Delicious!!!  I doubled sauce. Used low sodium soy sauce. Basted one side of chicken and pour a little over each piece. Baked for # min. Half way through flipped chicken, basted bottom. Baked for # min. Before serving, I heated up remaining sauce to serve on table.

Very good!  I doubled the sauce (except the sugar) because I wanted sauce for rice.  I will add broccoli and maybe water chestnuts next time.

This was very easy to make and would give 100 stars.  Perfect base sauce for any meat.  Made it exactly as was listed with only a slight variation to the cooking method.  Instead of basting every ten min., I double the sauce and dipped the chicken to coat. Then poured sauce over the chicken.  Covered and cooked for 30 min. Then took chicken out of oven turned chicken and turned heat down to 375(started chicken at 400). finished cooking uncovered for an additional 30 minutes. Absolutely delish.  The only thing I will change when making this again will be to cut chicken into strips.  I will make this often. **For a side I made lo mien noodles. Cook noodles according to package and set aside.  For the sauce  I used 1  cup chicken stock, 1 tsp soy, 1 tbsp. sesame oil, 1tbsp corn starch, 1 tbsp. water. and a pinch of ginger.  cook until thickened and pour over noodles .  I added steamed veggies and added to noodles.

I had five boneless, skinless thighs, but kept the sauce amount as stated. I used half brown sugar and half white. Using an 8x8 foil lined pan, I put most of the sauce over thighs, reserving some. Baked at 400degF for 20 min, then put reserved sauce over them and baked another 15 min. They came out so moist, and the sauce was excellent. May try the sauce with salmon, cooking at reduced temp for shorter amount of time, as another reviewer mentioned. Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out wonderfully!  I assembled the ingredients earlier in the day, so the chicken ended up marinating in part of the sauce.  That seemed to really infuse the flavor.  The thighs came out tender and flavorful.  I will definitely make again and my husband is anxious to try the recipe with chicken wings as well.  Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe.!

My husband loves this dish!  I use chicken thighs that I have skinned and removed the fat from.  I make the sauce exactly as listed EXCEPT I add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. This gives it a little zing, but not too much.  I also lay the thighs in a baking dish and pour the sauce over them and then turn them over to coat well.  I bake at 425 degrees for 30 minutes and then turn them and bake for another 30 minutes.

I followed JAYZGURL77's suggestion and made this recipe in the slow cooker....made the sauce per the recipe and poured it over the chicken in the slow cooker.  I wasn't ready to eat after 5 hrs. so it cooked for about 6 1/2 hrs on low.  Also I threw in some  fresh vegetables (string beans and broccoli--because they were on hand)  with about an hour to go, and  I only had to prepare some noodles to serve dinner. The chicken was VERY tender, and the sauce had a delightful flavor.   Such a simple meal.  I'll be making it quite often.

OMG!  Was this ever good!   Filleted the  chicken and pounded it, then served it over rice with stir-fried veggies.  I found basting during cooking really helped.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It will become part of my rotation!

Great recipe. Followed it exactly but didn’t baste chicken every 10 minutes. Also doubled the sauce to have extra. Everyone loved it. Don’t expect it to be crispy on n the outside like it would be if you grilled it. It was super juicy

I love baked teriyaki chicken and rice. I made this with the sauce, and it was great. However, I  have to say, I am also finding a lot of really delicious bottled teriyaki glazes and baking sauces on the market lately that are just as good and save time. I think boneless chicken thighs not breasts work best and I usually garnish my teriyaki chicken with toasted sesame seeds and chopped green onions. I also usually cook the thighs plain for about 10 mins then drain off fat. I baste with the sauce after that. You get the richer thigh flavor but minus some of the fat.

My sauce never thickened up. Not enough cornstarch? I don't know but all I know is it remained very watery but flavour-wise? It was good. I will likely try it again and see if I can get it thicker.

The recipe is better than average as written.  Next time I will amend based on others reviews:  Slow cooker, chicken breast, double the sauce, add pineapple. And serve over rice.

I doubled the sauce, basted every 10 minutes for 30 minutes, then turned them and poured the rest of the sauce on. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar but followed the rest as written. Used boneless thighs. My husband never cared for thighs but he loved this recipe. Served over rice with a veggie side dish. Just the 2 of us ate 5 of the 12 thighs.

Delicious sauce. Definitely a keeper! I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar, added a little extra garlic and ginger. I would definitely use this again but next time I may try to dice the chicken, cook on the stovetop and then add the sauce.

I made this recipe and it was very good. I did make one important change though. Instead of cooking it on the grill I poured the sauce over the uncooked chicken and cooked it about 5 hours in the crock pot on low. It was delicious. I served it over rice and had a lot of extra sauce to pour over the rice.

I made this dish last week and it went over GREAT!! The only problem I had was I now need to double the batch for the four of us. My husband and my youngest son were "arguing" over the last piece of chicken. I asked my husband last night what he wanted for dinner tonight, I am making this dish again tonight.

Excellent recipe! My family loved this recipe. I used chicken breasts cut up instead of thighs and poured the sauce on rather than basting. Definitely had plenty of sauce. I'm not sure why others said to double it. Also, use foil in the bottom of the pan. It makes a mess! Will make again for sure!

Not bad. A little sticky. A little salty! A little messy! But that is what all teriyaki recipes are like.   To me, this tastes the same as others that I've tried. I guess it was just...okay!

Doubled the sauce, used boneless thighs baked 40 mins. It was nice to have extra sauce to serve with steamed rice. Next time I would line baking dish with foil and reduce sugar, maybe by 1/2. Try this recipe with salmon & beef. Everyone did like, but I thought a tad too sweet.

I loved this recipe! I did line and cover the pan with foil and double sauce, and by the time I took it out the chicken was falling apart. I would also recommend using boneless and skinless thighs instead, they bake much more evenly.

Just cooking it now and it smells really good! HOWEVER: Definitely line your baking sheet with aluminium foil because all the sugar in the sauce gets baked onto the sheet and I am going to have one hell of a time trying to scrape it off! Good recipe other than that.

**side note: for those that feel it's to salty instead of using regular or lite soy sauce you could try Liquid Aminos (I use Bragg Liquid Aminos or Coconut Aminos. Tastes just like soy sauce w/out the salt.  Gluten Free & non-gmo. 

We all loved it! Made the sauce according to the recipe (minus the cornstarch and water. We have to be corn free) Doubled it though.  Used boneless skinless chicken tenders and cut the time in half and lowered the temp to 400. While the chicken was baking, I sautéed red and green bell peppers and onion in a pan with a little butter. Threw some broccoli in the microwave.  Served it all over brown rice. Definitely hit the spot!

I had loved how moist the chicken had come out!  However, I had double the recipe and used 12 chicken boneless and skinless breast.  I had basically submerged the chicken in the sauce in a half size foil pan.  I would definitely make this again!

I love this recipe! It is one of my family's favorites. I tweaked it a little though. I  substituted the white sugar for brown sugar, I cut up my chicken thighs into 1" pieces. I lined a shallow baking dish with foil, seasoned my chicken lightly, then poured the entire mixture over the chicken and baked for 20 minutes. Spoon over your choice of rice and enjoy the deliciousness. This method cuts down on cooking time.

I made this for the 1st time the other night & it was amazing! I almost made a few changes to the sauce as you could really smell the vinegar while cooking. I'm very glad I didn't as it turned out perfect w/a really great flavor. It was a hit for the entire family & will definitely be making it again

I did double the sauce ingredients with the exception of the sugar.  I only added 50% more sugar and used sodium reduced soya.  The temperature I adjusted to 400 degrees and used the convection bake setting.  I cooked 8 skinless bone-in thighs and 5 skinless legs.  I also found it helpful for me because of all the basting, to put the timer on for each 10 minutes and check them off on a slip of paper so they were turned at the exact 30 minute mark.  Sometimes we get interrupted and wonder where we are!  A fantastic recipe!

I made the sauce as indicated and used it on grilled chicken. Brush it on during the last 10-15 minutes, like regular barbeque sauce.  Nice change and really good with the charcoal grilled flavor. 

Tasting the sauce freshly cooked, it does seem terribly salty (even for salt-aholic me). But in the cooking, the soy-ginger-garlic flavors came out nicely.  I will definitely do it again, possibly substituting fruit juice for part of the vinegar and sugar.

Great recipe! Even my picky 11-year-old loved it. I used boneless, skinless thighs. Didn't take an hour to bake, so I'd suggest lowering the amount of time to 7 minutes per flip. Otherwise, no changes. Delicious!

This is quite good.  Like others, I used low sodium soy but also increased the garlic.  Turned out great, and the amount of sauce is just about right for 6-8 thighs.  It thickens up and coats the thighs wonderfully, and we  thought the flavor was fantastic,  even though it's a tiny bit strong.   Will reduce basting next time.

Made this twice. Delicious both times. Didn't change a thing. But as the tip says (cover with foil to cook evenly and keep moist). Will definitely make it again and again

This was great with the modifications by Valerie's Kitchen. I could even go with a tad less sugar than she used but not quite as low as others recomended. When I reduced the sugar by half, the salty soy sauce was too pronounced. But by using 75% of the sugar, it was great. I might go down to 67% of the recommended sugar instead. We grilled the chicken first to give it a nice flavor and drizzled the sauce over the chicken. The kids loved it with broccoli and brown rice. I plan to bake salmon with the sauce next. Yum!

I made this in the crockpot and it turned out great. I doubled the sauce and used half brown sugar half white. Cooked on high for 4 hours. The house smelled so yummy and hubby said it was delicious.

From reading the reviews, I get all kinds of good ideas.  I've made this recipe several times, as boneless, skinless chicken thighs are so affordable.  I pour half of the sauce over the chicken thighs - to heck with "brushing". I do not cover them. After 30 minutes, I drain the juice from the pan, turn the chicken pieces over and pour the rest of the sauce over them.  Bake another 30 minutes and it is absolutely perfect!  The sauce becomes sticky and totally yummy!

This recipe is really good. The only thing I did differently is I cooked mine in the slow cooker like someone else suggested. I did not change any of the ingredients, though. In the future, I will likely cut down the sugar a little. I found it to be a little too sweet, even though it was tasty. Not the healthiest of recipes but a nice treat.

This recipe comes out perfect every time! I use boneless skinless thighs and bake 30 min, basting about three times. Juicy and delicious. We look forward to the leftovers the next day.

This is an amazing chicken dinner recipe... came out great! The only change I made was I  doubled the amount of garlic. Other than that, followed the recipe precisely and it was wonderful. Served it with allrecipes.com's baked pineapple side dish and white rice. Will definitely make this again sometime!!

This is a great tasting recipe. Definitely double the sauce. I mixed all the ingredients except water and cornstarch and marinaded the chicken for a few hours while we were at the pool. When we got home I drained the marinade into a pan and mixed in the cornstarch and water. After it thickened I basted the chicken while it was cooking. We used chicken breast and thighs and only baked for 20 minutes before turning and basting, then another 20 minutes. Big hit with my family. Thanks for posting.

Great, easy sauce to jazz up some chicken thighs. I baked for 20 minutes, flipped and reglazed them and then baked for 15 more. Found that to be plenty of time. Served with rice and sautéed carrots and zucchini.

Fantastic!  Of course use low-sodium soy and definitely double sauce if using 12 thighs as recipe indicates,  yum.

Great go-to weekday recipe.  I use with boneless skinless chicken breasts and serve over steamed rice with a green veg.  I always cook an extra piece for lunch the next day.  Big hit with kids.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a foolproof recipe and is so impressive! I actually don't cook the sauce beforehand I put the sauce and chicken all together in an ovenproof pan or casserole dish and then keep turning it every 10 minutes.. the sauce gets just as nice and thick and gooey. I've used this recipe with breasts also turns out great. Throw some green onions and or sesame seeds on it and serve over rice with broccoli! 

Also i cut the chicken into chunks then mix around in the sauce.

Great recipe for the crockpot, easy to put together before work in the morning. I doubled the sauce ingredients except sugar (used brown and only 1.5x), used light soya sauce and extra cloves of garlic. And a Tbsp of minced ginger.  Put the chicken in and ensured it was coated in sauce,  and put it on low for 10 hours. Turned out I should have used the full amount of sugar, it tasted a bit vinegary, but I added a can of pineapple tidbits with some of the juice but not all, and it was perfect. Served over rice

Sauce took the estimated time to thicken so as long as you plan for the full 90 minutes this one is a winner. We used a whole sectioned chicken and it turned out perfect.

Whenever I crave teriyaki chicken, I use this recipe.  I agree with other reviewers that if you love sauce, you should double to portion listed in the recipe.  I find that at 425 degrees, my chicken is done in 25 minutes (I use an older gas stove).  You should definitely use a thermometer to check your chicken so it's not overcooked.  The last time I made this, I added mushrooms in the last ten minutes of cooking (that's the way I grew up eating teriyaki chicken) and it was fantastic!

I used rice wine vinegar because I don't have cider plus to give it Asian kick. I also used fresh ginger. The sauce is good. Next time I will try to marinade the chicken for a bit to make sure the inside of the meat will be tastier. Definitely use foil or put a boiling water on the pan right after you use it.

Definitely a keeper; keep in mind to line pan with foil or you will be scrubbing for days. Either that or throw away the pan.

This recipe really makes a good tasting sauce. 
 I used half brown sugar instead of all white which I'm sure did not make too much difference in the taste.
I will definitely make this one again

I tried this tonight. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and used a little less of it. I did the same thing with the low sodium soy sauce. I used this recipe for 6 thighs. Had just enough sauce. Basted them every 10 minutes. The last twenty minutes I did not base them but the last 8 minutes I added a quarter each of red and green bell pepper and a pinch of sesame seed. I cooked some broccoli and carrots and white rice to go with this dish. It came out perfectly! Not too sweet and the thighs were moist. Very good! My husband enjoyed this too! I will make again.

I made this recipe last night for my family. They totally loved it!!! It was amazyng. I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs and it was so tender. OMG i can still taste the flavour. The sauce is amazing. I can imagine how good it would be with pork or meat even salmon!

This one is all about the rich, tangy sauce! It's one of my family's favorites. I use garlic powder instead of minced garlic and boneless/skinless chicken breast. I'm going to use the sauce recipe on slow cooker pork loin tomorrow for dinner. Give it a try!

Fantastic sauce! I used it with tofu. I made the sauce and heated it over medium heat until it started to bubble and thicken. I sauteed the tofu slabs in sesame oil until lightly golden while the sauce thickened. Then, I poured the sauce over the tofu and turned the heat down to low to finish cooking while I made some veggies for the side. This was amazing! I did cut the sugar down to about 1/3 of a cup and it was still great! Thanks for sharing!

I tried it last night and I didn't like it. I used low sodium soy sauce and it came out salty... It also tasted like a form of knock off soy sauce.. Didn't seem like teriyaki to me... My bf thought it was okay but salty. It's two stars for the effort in putting this together. It just wasn't for me.

My family loved this! I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and it added just enough of a kick to the sauce! Like one reviewer suggested, I poured half the sauce over the boneless thighs, covered and baked for about 30 mins at 400 degrees. Then I uncovered and baked 30 mins longer, basting every 10 minutes. The sauce thickened up nicely and the chicken was delicious over a bed of steamed jasmine rice. Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make this again!

I made this tonight and doubled the recipe. Used brown sugar instead of white since it's all due to preference. Instead of using thighs, I used chicken tenders. Baked it for 20 minutes then turned on the broiler for 5 minutes to get a nice glaze. The sauce was nice and thick. Not as sweet as I'm use to. The cider vinegar did calm down a bit after you cook it but you could still taste it. I'll make it with rice vinegar instead for more sweetness next time. Otherwise, my son and husband liked it. I thought it was ok as is but when I drizzled sriracha sauce over mine, it was better for me since I like my teriyaki spicy and my family doesn't.

First I want to start by saying that im not one to twick recipes that much. I did read several reviews before making this and I noticed many said to use low sodium soy sauce...I should have listened..This recipe with the regular soy sauce was very salty. Maybe if I'd be less salty i would have liked it better. I just thought it was an ok recipe and dont think I will be making it again.

My family LOVES this recipe!  I have to quadruple the sauce and cook a ton of rice every time I make it because my son is so crazy about it.  I swap the thighs for chicken tenderloin simply because it cooks faster and I hear 'is it ready yet?!'  that much less.   I add more garlic too since we're big garlic fans.

Absolutely delicious.  Didn't change a thing other than doubling the sauce as others had recommended and it was terrific.  My husband said it was the best teriyaki chicken he has ever eaten.  Made it for Christmas Eve with drumsticks with rave reviews.  This recipe is a keeper.  Will be making it again soon.  Thank you so much for sharing it!

I used boneless tenderloin because that's what I had. An hour made the sauce burn and stick to the dish. Luckily the chicken was edible, but also had a charred flavor.

I read previous reviews - lined my pan with foil - cooked covered for first 30 minutes, and doubled the sauce (actually only cooked 6 thighs) Works well with gluten free tamari sauce. As soon as I was done eating I copied this down on a card for my "for-real" recipe box. I will make this again and again. I served it with white rice and roasted sweet potatoes.

My husband loved this so much i made this recipe twice in one week! Anyone can make this, super easy. Definitely use foil for an easy clean up afterwards. I served with plain white rice and broccoli. So delicious

This tasted great! Morgan rated it 2 stars. Used 2 chicken breasts instead. Put foil in the bottom. Doubled the sauce. Try to let it simmer more next time. Cooked at 375 degrees for 15 min. Then flipped the chicken over and cooked another 15 min

As hubby is diabetic, I used brown sugar Splenda (slightly less than what was called for) and substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar. Also followed another viewer's idea and lined dish for foil and covered with foil for entire baking time. Very moist. Definitely a keeper!

I'm giving 3 stars right now, but will change my recipe next time. I did what others did and throw the whole mixture/chicken in a slow cooker. The sauce seemed to be too much, and not thick enough either. Also the chicken just didn't have the strongest teriyaki taste. I will try baking it next time and update my review.

I made this for a family birthday and everyone loved it.  I used boneless chicken breast, fresh ginger, half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Baked for 30 minutes covered, uncovered and turned the breasts, then baked for another 30 minutes all on 375.  Simply amazing!!!

This was quick and easy. I followed as is except I didn't have the viniger and I cooked the breasts at 325. Fantastic!! As a side I whipped together some fried rice with whatever was left in my fridge- not much- red/green peppers, onions, egg- and soy sauce. I added a little tariyaki sauce that I had left over at the last second and it was delicious for a quick side!! Yum!!!

Delicious! Made exactly as the recipe except I used drumsticks instead of thighs (that's what I had on hand).  Everyone thought it was wonderful and I will definately make again.  I cooked at 400, but my oven always runs hot.  I found the cooking time fine, since I removed from oven to brush on more sauce every 10 minutes.  This is not a "toss in the oven and let cook" dish, but well worth the effort of basting every 10 minutes.  Served with fried rice, steaned carrots and green beans.  Yhanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely delicious. My kids didn't like the multitude of flavors, but it was so easy to make, very flavorful, and better than the store bought teriyaki sauce.   I used it with chicken legs on sale and cannot wait for the leftovers!   If you like teriyaki, you'll like this.

Absolutely delicious! My oven is not working (new one coming within the week) so I browned the chicken in a skillet, removed it and proceeded with step 1 using the same skillet. Once the sauce thickened I placed the chicken back into the skillet, covered it and let it simmer for 30 minutes.  Easy and soooo yummy!

To me this was just ok. I used chicken breasts and added pineapple slices. The taste was really nothing special. My family liked it and that would probably be my only reason for making it again,

Very good sauce.  I cooked my thighs around 350-375 for 30-35 min.  Use a thermometer to gauge.  I marinated the thighs in the sauce for a couple hours and it really made the meat tasty!  I also used fresh ginger instead of powder!  Next time I would use breasts or legs.  Thighs have a pretty game-y flavor.

Wow! This is a new favorite. What I love the most about this recipe is that it seems very flexible. All I had on hand were two chicken breasts and I cut them up into tidbits to make them go further. I followed the sauce exactly as stated but with low-sodium soy sauce because that is all I had on hand (it was salty enough and I think it might have been too salty if I used regular soy sauce). I lined an 8x8 pan with foil based on another reviewer's suggestion and poured the sauce over. Soon after putting it in the oven I found out my husband would be late so I just turned the oven down low to 300 degrees and let it cook for well over an hour. I stirred it around every now and then. Moist, tender little tidbits of chicken in delicious sauce came out. If I were using the full amount of chicken, I would double sauce because it is so good and I'm not even a big teriyaki fan.

Yum the whole family loved this. I made two pans one with the thighs and one with chicken tenderloins. I doubled the sauce. I added about an extra half cup of sugar(brown sugar) fresh ground ginger and hot pepper flakes. We served with jasmine rice and broccoli.  Will make again.  Oh only cooked the tenderloins for 30 min.

Perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly but didn't baste, I just flipped the chicken over halfway through cooking.  I love to use the sauce as a gravy over rice or mashed potatoes.  Delicious!

I made this recipe using a technique I use on beef, chicken, & fish. From a recipe called Cook steak Like a Chef...preheat oven to 450. Combine all the ingredients for the sauce. Set aside.  Rinse and pat  Chicken breast dry. I used 4 breasts. Add spices to chicken if desired. Using an oven proof pan heat over med-high heat. When hot spray with non-stick spray. When the pan starts to slightly smoke add the chicken. Cook for two minutes. After two minutes lift each piece and place back down on the same side. Cook one more minute. After the one minute turn the chicken and immediately put on the lowest rack in the oven. Bake for 8 minutes. After 8 minutes take the pan out of the oven ( use mitts...very HOT!) pour the sauce over the chicken and put back in the oven for two minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and place on the stove. On med-high heat, heat the sauce. And chicken till sauce thickens. Let sit for 5-10 minutes. Serve with rice. Mmmmm.

This was OK but not great.  I find it kind of boring.  I tried this recipes on wings and thighs and breasts and found it works best with wings.

Great recipe.  I doubled the sauce and cut sugar to 3/4 cup (1/2 white, 1/4 brown), used skinless, boneless chicken thighs that we don't usually eat, but got on sale. Covered with foil for the first half of cooking and finished under the broiler.  Love it will be having this again.

This is a great recipe to start with. I have made it a couple times a couple different ways and liked it both times. I always double the sauce of just about any recipe to be sure. The sauce is great and u can use any type of chicken. We love it over brown rice.

Delicious recipe. Don't be afraid of high temp and I didn't cover with foil. I had 6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs so  I cooked 15 minutes less.  I made sauce almost excactly, but I subbed orange juice for half of the cider (my kids are very wary of vinegar, so I needed to tone it down with oj, or pineapple juice.   I also ran out of soy sauce, and only had 3/4 the amount called for and used garlic powder because I didn't have garlic.  Instead of brushing sauce on I just poured spoonful of sauce on each side and every 10 minutes I would pour spoonful more on chicken.  After chicken done I sliced it into strips and put it bake in baking tray and mixed it with the glazed sauce then put it on top of steamed rice. It looked just like a terryaki bowl from a restaurant.  My family loved it, even my son who is not very fond of chicken.  You can double sauce and stir fry some broccoli for a yummy healthy meal. Thank you for this recipe!  God bless

I made this recipe and then realized I had no ginger, so  tossed in just 2 dashes of Tabasco.  I have to make this recipe doubled to make enough sauce so that my family, and the assorted girlfriends, "adopted" children and other drop-ins, can have enough to mash into the rice I usually serve with the chicken.  We've even done it on the grill and it was fantastic, just make sure you put the sauce on near the end of cooking so the sugars in the sauce don't burn.  Excellent recipe.

Do yourself a favor and try this recipe. ;) I did cut the cook time to around 20 minutes on one side and 25 on the other (instead of 30/30). I also slightly decreased the soy sauce to sweeten the recipe. Delicious. The taste was amazing, and the chicken was so tender it fell apart on the fork.

I absolutely adore this one. I made  the sauce but I used a whole chicken (cause it was around 12 midnight and no stores were open and that's the only chicken I had) and I must say it's the best chicken teriyaki ive ever had. Thank you so much for this one, I will make sure to make more of this when friends and family comes over and im sure they'll love it!

Delicious! I didn't alter a thing! I used the recipe as stated for 6 chicken legs.  It was more than enough! I bake-sprayed my baking dish as recommended and poured the sauce over the legs and baked at 450 for 40 minutes.  I have enough sauce left over to baste my rib-eyes for tomorrow!  I served this with (get this!) cilantro lime rice!  Yup! It was fantastic! Very possibly next time I will use fresh ginger but really if I don't have it, I'll still use the dried ginger!  Try this!  You will not be disappointed!

Best Teriyaki sauce I have ever made, hands down.  I think it was better than the bottle I buy at the store.  And my 11 year old pickiest eater ever daughter loved it as well, so a total win.  I am thinking of using it for meat balls for New Year's Eve....  We'll see.

This was SOOOOO good! Love, love, love it. I only made about half the chicken with the same amount of sauce, because honestly, you can't use too much of that teriyaki sauce it is so yummy. I am a huge fan!

The recipe is easy and delicious!  I doubled the sauce and used the extra sauce to pour over my rice and chicken after it was cooked.  I would definitely line the baking dish with foil as it leaves a black, sticky mess on the the dish.  I will be making this again!

Loved this, doubled the sauce! I split the breasts to make two fillets, so cooking time was about 30 mins.  So moist, going to make this over and over!!

Wonderful!  I did what was suggested by "Valerie's Kitchen", except that I used Splenda since I am dieting.  I didn't baste at all...covered the chicken breasts with tin foil and voila!    Will most definitely make again, and again.....  One thing I do wonder about...what is the 1 tbsp. of water for?...to dissolve the corn starch?

The sauce was so bad that no one in my family could eat it. Ended up rinsing off the chicken, cubing it and throwing it in a frying pan with some sesame oil and a few other things to get that horrid taste off!

It was good.  And easy.  A little too much vinegar flavor for me.  I added orange bell pepper and onion to the sauce.  Pineapple would have been nice I'll bet!  I'd make it again.

Very very good!! I used brown sugar instead of the white, doubled everything except only used 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup soy sauce, and a little less then half a cup vinegar. I also added 1 T honey and poured all the sauce over 3 chicken breasts cut into strips. I baked at 350 for 15 min then turned and basted and cooked an additional 15 min, basted one more time before turning on the broiler for about 5 min. Carmelized really well and tasted amazing! Served with steamed broccoli and brown rice, will be making it into the monthly rotation. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Love!  We ran out of apple cider vinegar so I used half regular vinegar and coconut sugar  in place of regular sugar.  DELICIOUS!  Definitely double the recipe of the sauce.  YUMMY!!!  Thank you!

I've made just the sauce portion of this recipe several times, cutting back on the sugar as other reviewers have suggested. It makes a good sauce for the chicken meatballs from Costco, just add some chopped bell peppers.

The whole family loved this chicken teriyaki. It was easy to make and the final presentation was worth all the basting. Didn't change a thing, didn't need to. I would definately line my baking pan next time. It took two days to scrub the baked on teriyaki sauce off my corningware. I will definately be making this again, especially for company. I agree, double the sauce so you have some extra for your rice or dipping.

The flavors were perfect in this recipe! I would add peanuts or cashews to the pan also, and peapods or broccoli and serve over noodles. We used boneless skinless chicken breasts and cubed them which cut the cooking time.

This was really just ok. The meat was very juicy. Therefore, I gave it a three stars for not being dry without covering it will foil. The flavor was very subtle which didn't make it any better than plain baked chicken. I don't think this is a recipe I'd make again.

I just made this recipe for an easy Sunday lunch.  I followed the recipe as written and used a few of the previous tips--I lined my pan with foil, baked the chicken on 375, and kept the chicken covered while it baked.  I also made some extra sauce that I used to cook broccoli and served everything with rice.  My family and I were very happy with the results.

Very good!  Husband liked it too.  I cooked two large chicken breasts and both had skin on and bone in.  They were very moist and delicious.  Since I only cooked the two breasts, I reduced the soy sauce and sugar by half.  Will definitely make again.

First tip: USE FOIL!!!! This is going to be a hellish time cleaning up if you don't. Next tip: double the sauce- maybe even triple it. I only used 3 chicken breasts and it was enough to cover once on one side after baking the first 10 minutes. but this was really good. I say cook it 5 mins less so all the chicken is juicy. sorry to start off negative, but yes i did enjoy this chicken w/ a side of broccoli yum!

Super easy and delicious! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs (personal preference), so it didn't take as long to cook. The sauce was really tasty, though. I just dumped the sauce on top and turned them over halfway through. Yum!

My 15 yr old son made this for dinner and it turned out great. He adjusted teriyaki to his taste by tweaking sugar and cider amounts. Also he made separate sauce for basting cooked meat to avoid contamination. We will do this again and try with flank steak.

Not a huge fan of this sauce.  It's only okay because the sauce has too much vinegar and is only edible after marinading chicken then grilling it.  It doesn't work as a sauce to use afterwards and is much too tart.  As a marinade for grilling, this does work pretty good but not for baking.  Instead, I use a similar sauce made without vinegar or white sugar.  Use 5 tablespoons of brown sugar, one tablespoon honey, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 cup of cold water and the rest of the ingredients listed.  This turns into a great teriyaki sauce for dipping or drizzle.  Use this one listed as marinade and the other as your dip, drizzle, baking or teriyaki rice bowl.

Made with ingredients listed. I used thin sliced chicken breasts. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes. Basted when it when in the oven, at 15 minutes I turned chicken and basted one more time. Served with brown rice and asparagus tips. I thought the vinegar came through just a little too strong.

These were a nice solid recipe. Wouldn't say over the top great, but good. I skinned my chicken thighs first and maybe that played a part. Served with baked asparagus from this sight and a curry chicken salad. Skinning the chicken I felt like this method would make a really good Chinese meal with rice if you took the chicken off the bone and cut it up into chunks. Looked and tasted like what you'd get on a Chinese buffet.

This recipe was alright. I think I should marinade it next time. Instead of just basting and one not. I did, however; enjoy the smell it left in my apartment. Yum! Taste didn't match up though haha. I served this with potato salad on the side. My boyfriend enjoyed it though...oh yeah and so did the cat. :)

I love this recipe! I usually double the sauce so that my family can pour it over the rice. I only have candied ginger, so I just smash a small piece of that and addition to the sauce. I also add red pepper flakes and a bit extra corn starch. It comes out well every time.

I had high hopes for this simple recipe but I was disappointed. Something seemed missing. The flavor was okay but needed more punch. I added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes (my only tweak) but this didn't do enough. The coating did not stick well to the chicken, either. Most of it pooled in the bottom of the pan so we used it for dipping to eke out more flavor. I don't understand why it slipped off as I dried the chicken well and the coating cooked up nice and thick at the start. 
Also, the baking time is too long. I temped my chicken after 50 minutes and every piece registered at well over 175 F. The coating was beginning to burn by then so I stopped the baking.

BIG thank you to the reviewers who suggested lining the pan with foil first! You saved me lots of scrubbing as the coating tends to stick to the pan(not to the chicken sadly).

Hands-down, the best teriyaki sauce you will ever taste.  I double up making the sauce because my husband is so obsessed with it that he puts on everything.

Good recipe. Here's my suggestions: double the recipe, use brown sugar, line the baking dish with foil.

This recipe was awesome. I completely messed it up and it was still good. I actually had all of the required ingredients, but they were not visible in my cabinet so I replaced Worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce and flour for the cornstarch. I used bottled minced onion and way too much pepper and it still survived. I just poured the sauce over the chicken because I didn't want extra sauce left over and cooked it in the oven. I ate it with stir fry vegetables and seasoned rice(cheap store package). There was more than enough sauce since I only cooked about 6 pieces of chicken.

Made this exactly like recipe - unfortunately the sauce became really runny in the oven and didn't really coat the chicken - it tasted ok -but not what I expected.....

I think this definitely needs low sodium soy sauce.  I only had regular and it was a bit salty for me and I love salty!  I didn't double the sauce recipe because I was making only two chicken breasts and it worked out fine, but I would definitely double it if I were cooking more chicken. I browned my chicken first and set it aside.  Then, I made the sauce per the recipe's instructions, but left it a bit thinner and baked the chicken in the sauce using a small covered casserole dish @350 degrees.  I had no issues with the sauce burning or sticking to the dish.  This was yummy served over steamed rice with some fresh green beans.

In searching for recipe for delicious and juicy chicken I've decided to try this recipe, remembering how much I heard about teriyaki sauce. I baked chiken for a bit less time - about 20 minutes for each side because I feared that it would burn on pan. But still everything turned great! It is quite juicy and have amazing aroma and taste(even exotic for me)! Must say that this recipe doesn't have anything difficulties and rare ingredients. Absolutely would cook for big family holidays!

This is ridiculously good! Mix the sauce then taste it to see if you need to change it to your liking (more or less sugar etc). My husband loves it when I make this!

Very easy, very good, sauce. I was feeling lazy, and used powdered garlic in lieu of fresh, and it was fine. Would be an excellent sauce to use with pork, too.

Wonderful recipe! I used 1/3c of brown sugar , lite soy sauce and chicken drumsticks. It was adequately sweet ( without being cloying). The blend of flavors was excellent. We enjoyed dinner, thanks to you! I will definitely be making this again .

Yummy!  After reading all the reviews, I doubled the recipe for 4 boneless chicken breasts about 3/4" thick.  I cooked in a covered 9x12 baking dish on 375 for 20 mins ea side.  Perfect!

So easy and authentic.  I fried wings and used the sauce to coat before putting in oven to set.  I made some changes, I added additional water because whenever I make any recipes that has soy sauce, it always tends to be too salty so, I added about a total of 1/4 cup of water, a tablespoon or so at a time to thin it out and make less salty.  Because I added the water and lessened the flavor, I added about 2 tablespoons of honey which really didn't change the flavor that much.  It was really good before adding the honey.  I will make this again and again because the flavor was so good and because it was so easy.

Wow. This was fantastic!  My daughter said it was her new favorite :) I used my nuwave oven to bake the chicken (thighs) and baked for 8 minutes on each side.  Next I cut the chicken into bite size pieces, drizzled w/ marinade and put it back in the nuwave for 2-3 more minutes to let the sauce caramelize on top.  Served with rice & veggies-my daughter loves me more today than she did yesterday LOL!  Thank you Marian!

Great recipe.  I used 2 large 1/2 breasts.  I pounded them to 1/2 inch.  I also aluminum foil to line the baking dish and sprayed it with non stick spray.  I put the breasts in the baking dish and then covered with sauce. The only change i made to the sauce was the 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I also covered with foil and baked for 30 minutes on 375.

I used this recipe however I used chicken breast tenderloins, because I'm not a fan of dark meat. However, I chopped up my chicken fried it along with some onion then I added steam chopped broccoli then poured the sauce with it and let it cook for a little bit. It was amazing taste, and it was so flavorable along with my rice I shall do this again.

Very tasty and tender!   Didn't change anything except used less sugar and cooked it In a covered skillet on the stove top instead of baking in the oven but I only cooked 6 thighs.  Would do it in the oven for a larger quantity.

This had potencial to be really good, it was just WAY to strong of a flavor.
I followed another reviewers advice to double the sauce, but found that I needed to add a lot of water to tone down the flavor enough to make it palitable, so I found myself with way to much sauce.

My recamindation- do a single recipe and add 1-3 cups of water.

I was skeptical at first, but desperate for a new spin on chicken. It was so good!  I ran out of soy sauce (used tamari) so I had to use 1/4 cup soy and then 1/4 cup Bragg's Liquid Aminos (similar to soy sauce). 
I used thighs and one breast cut into thirds so the pieces were roughly the same size as the boneless thighs. I dumped the sauce over the chicken in a sprayed Pyrex, turned it to coat both sides, covered it with foil,and then baked it at 325 for an hour and twenty minutes- removing the foil after about 50 minutes. It was really really good and flavorful. I'd love to try it on beef and salmon. Thanks, Marian!

Mades this recipe with five chicken thighs. Seemed to be the perfect amount.  A bit salty but only basted and didn't use extra sauce as it would have made it way too salty. :)  Sooooo yummy though:)  Enjoy

It was so good! I did however double the sauce. And next time I'm gonna line the pan with foil, it took forever to clean without it. But definitely my new favorite!

This was reallllly good, just a little messy to eat. I will probably use boneless breasts next time. I used 3 cloves of garlic, a mix of white and brown sugar, doubled the sauce, and cooked for about 50 minutes at 375. Me and my boyfriend really enjoyed the sauce, and will be making it again very soon!

Simply Deelish.!!!!  Unlike others who altered this highly ranked recipe I did NOT.  I followed the instructions exactly as listed and the result was out of this world. It is def not too salty or sweet, simply put its perfect as is.  I did make extra sauce though, and simply doubled the ingredients.  It turned out great.  My wife, and two fussy daughters had seconds and said it was excellent.  I will def add this to may favorite meals list.  Easy to prepare and clean up, as I lined the baking dish with foil first.  Would not change the 425F temp as it helped crisp up the chicken tighs at the end....they were tender inside and fell apart when served.  A++++.

This is a very good recipe, however, I see this exact same recipe listed on many different recipe sites, several of which are dated older than this one. I thought recipes submitted to Allrecipes are supposed to be original recipes. Am I wrong?

So disappointed you said to cook for 1 hour, turning after 30. The chicken was cooked through at 40. 60 would of made it horrible. The taste was good, but way way off on cooking time

This was delicious!  I used a cut up chicken and pulled the skin off.  I also doubled the sauce and covered the chicken with foil and baked it for 30 minutes.  I then poured more sauce over the chicken and baked another 30 minutes.  Served with broccoli, rice and pineapple chunks.  The whole family loved it!  This sauce is very versatile and could be used on many different meats, tofu or veggies.

The sauce was DELICIOUS. I adjusted the cooking time for the chicken according to it's size and doubled the serving amount of the recipe for the sauce; Highly recommend making extra to go with rice or vegetables! My boyfriend loved it too, I caught him literally licking the plate off haha.

My first time writing a review for any recipe.  This was great! I couldn't believe that my home-made teriyaki sauce tasted better than most of the bottled sauces out there.  My picky eater daughter kept talking about how good it was even the next day and my 21 month son keeps saying yummy. My husband was amazed. I took the advice of others and tripled the sauce and other ingredients because I was cooking more chicken. I lowered the heat to 375 degrees and cooked each side for about 45 minutes. I didn't have to baste much because the chicken was fully marinated and swimming in the sauce. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I'll substitute the sugar with honey next time to see how that turns out. Will let you all know.

This recipe is exceptional!  I have tried for years to add things to the bottled teriyaki sauce to make it edible - to no avail.  The only thing I did differently was to marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before I put it in the oven and didn't baste at all.  I used chicken breast that fell off of the bone as if they had been in a smoker.  Yum Yum!

Tasty! My new favorite recipe for chicken! We all but licked the platter clean! lol! I asked my brothers if the recipe was a keeper. They stayed quiet, but the way they were going at it, I knew it must be. Totally making this sometime again! I had fresh ginger root on hand, so I used that instead of the powder.

This recipe is AWESOME!  My wife is not a big fan of Asian food and LOVED IT!  I was thinking ahead of time of reducing the amount of sugar but opted out of that idea and added lots of veggies in instead, thankfully it was for the best.  The only change I would make would be to double the recipe for the same amount of chicken since I had no sauce/glaze left over for those who wanted some on their rice or vegetables.

This sauce is amazing: dark, rich, and smoky. I followed the other reviewers by reducing the sugar 'cause I'm not fond of overly sweet meat sauces. Because I doubled the recipe, instead of using a full cup of white sugar I used 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup brown (also recommended by a reviewer). I would have preferred to give this recipe 4.5 stars, only because the meat came out swimming in sauce, so it was wetter on our plates than it looks in the photo. But nevertheless, this recipe is very, very good, and it's the only sauce I would ever use to make teriyaki.

Made this last night and it turned out delicious.  Only used 5 thighs so I imagine with 12 there would not be enough sauce.  Cooked at 425 as stated in the recipe, uncovered and it turned out perfect.  Didn't grease pan but soaked after and cleaned easy.  Pyrex rocks.

This is excellent. Definitely not enough sauce though. I used chicken breasts and only cooked 2 and it was barely enough sauce. I took someone elses tip and baked it in an 8 x 8 baking dish. That worked well. The sauce is excellent. Will definitely be making this again soon. Thanks Marian.

Made this for dinner, and added extra garlic as suggested by one reviewer. I used the same amount of ingredients but for only 6 chicken thighs. Tasted the sauce after heating and thought it was too "vinegary," so I added 1/4 cup of agave nectar (just to finish up the bottle of nectar in my fridge ). I followed another reviewer's suggestion and foiled the baking dish before baking at 400F. After 30 mins. I removed the foil, added more teriyaki sauce and baked for another 30 minutes. The chicken thighs were wonderfully tender and tasty! I served the chicken over rice and stir fry veggies. I used a reserve amount of sauce (about 1/4 cup) for my  veggies, and it made them even tastier! Will definitely make this again!

Delicious and easy chicken recipe! I subbed boneless chicken thighs, light soy sauce, and white vinegar. Then I cooked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Great served over brown rice with a side of green beans.

This is a great Teriyaki recipe...easy and quick just add to the fact that this is one that will be made again.  It's worked great as a sauce for baking and bbq'ing, and it adds even more flavour when marinated for a few hours. Wonderful.

This is the best teriyaki chicken I have ever tasted. I recommend doubling the sauce. I thought it did need balanced with the sugar ratio. But that is a taste preference .  I added fresh ginger minced along with 3 tablespoon of finely minced onion in addition to the garlic. Wow!  The sauce would also be great as a glaze on salmon. I used bone in chicken thighs (12). Deliciously moist.  Thank you .

I give this 4 stars only because it was a little too sweet for me.  I think I will use a little less sugar next time.  Most of the family really enjoyed it.

I love the way the chicken turns out when I make this! Cooks perfect and the teriyaki sauce is delish! However, instead of chicken thighs I use boneless, skinless chicken breast. Super easy and tasty meal to make that it think everyone will like!

So good! Tastes like it should have came from a restaurant. I have already made it twice. I doubled the sauce and that was just enough for about 4-6 thighs!

Tried this tonight and the family loved it! I stir fried some zucchini,carrots and mushrooms to serve over rice and used the remaining sauce to pour over just as I removed the veggies from the heat. Great easy and quick meal.

This was good. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I cooked 7 decent sized breasts with the sauce as in recipe. It was just enough so the quantities are correct. Everyone liked it and it was moist with turning mid cooking time and two basting times. Careful to not overcook because the chicken will become dry. Will prepare again. Thanks.

Tasted very good! But, I used teriyaki instead of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar. Don't know if it made much of difference but it tasted really good.

I made this for dinner tonight, and I have to say my husband,my
sixteen year old son and myself enjoyed this a lot. The sauce went together very easy, I think I may try like other reviewers rice vinegar and fresh grated ginger , maybe an extra tbsp. corn starch because, I felt it could be thicker. My son like it so much he scraped the empty platter to get the extra sauce off for his rice. I have cubed venison steaks that I will make using this sauce and I'm sure it will be spot on. Thanks for a great recipe Marian!!!!!

This is a great winter recipe!  I used chicken breasts and always use low sodium soy sauce.  I also made extra sauce and put it in small ramekin dishes for each person to use for dipping.

I loved the flavor of the sauce. I doubled the sauce and put it in a slow cooker for about 5 hours on low. The chicken was tender and yummy. I used boneless thighs and breasts. The sauce needs to be thicker, so I thickened it, I sautéed some zucchini and mushrooms and made some rice with it to make almost an Asian theme to my dish. I will be making it again.

I really liked this recipe. It was very easy. I did add a little pineapple juice and pineapple tidbits to the pan half way through the cooking time. I also cooked boneless skinless breasts at 350 degrees, covered with foil until the end. I checked them with a meat thermometer until they were 165. Thanks for a great recipe.

I was looking for a recipe for chicken thighs, and this was the first one that came up. It was SO good. I only did 6 thighs, and followed the directions for the sauce, so I wold suggest doubling it. Also worth taking the time to baste every 10 minutes. I think the sauce got layered on better than if you just dumped it on and cooked for the whole time. Will definitely make again!

Important to use thighs in this recipe. Breasts do not lend the needed flavor or oil. Very good recipe.

Doubled the sauce. It was soooo salty and didn't have very much flavor other than the salt. It was so so. I probably won't make this again.

Great recipe! I followed it exactly except added a bit more of the ginger, garlic, and pepper.

Tip for juicier chicken: cover it with tinfoil for the first half of baking

This was SO easy and delicious! I made exactly as written. Be sure to baste as directed--it makes a difference and adds the crunchy, caramelized finish. I didn't need to make additional sauce; I just used my baster and re-basted. I had plenty of sauce.

Loved this recipe. I am new to cooking and was looking for something new and this worked out great. I made a large batch for a potluck and rubbed sauce on it while it baked in 10 minute intervals and then dumped the remainder of sauce all over at the end. Delicious!

Best chicken I have had in a long time. This sauce is the best homemade Teriyaki! 

I made the sauce as directed except I cut back the sugar by 1/8 cup). I cooked 6 skinless bone-in thighs. I lined my dish with non-stick foil, covered for 30 minutes at 375 degrees then uncovered til done (about 45 minutes total). I served with rice and sauteed zuchinni with onion). My very picky husband said I could make this dish anytime.  I told him I would like to try the sauce with baked Salmon and he was on onbard with that. Will make again routinely. Thank you!

This was absolutely awesome and it was super simple.  Huge hit at my house.  Even my picky kids loved it!  Only thing I would change is next time I plan to line the baking dish with foil instead of just lightly greasing it.

I make this recipe as is every week and it is amazing! The only things I do is I buy skin on thighs and skin them myself because I think the chicken tastes better and I put some sauce on the side for after the chicken comes out to give it that look for presentation value. It's a family favorite!

This is one of the best ways to make chicken! The sauce is amazing!!! The first time I made this I used regular vinegar, then the 2nd time I used the cider vinegar, bothe times were delicious so if you dont' have any cider vinegar it's ok. Other than that I didn't change a thing!

This was an awesome recipe! It's a huge hit at home and I now cook it regularly. I do recommend making an extra serving of the teryaki sauce. We like to pour a little bit over our rice as well.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was so delicious that I had to come here right away and write a review!
Previously I had a go-to recipe of balsamic glazed chicken that was somewhat similar to this recipe, but this one definitely trumps my old one! Sorry, balsamic glazed chicken, you are being replaced!
Everyone in my family loved it. I didn't have cornstarch at home, therefore I thickened the sauce by first making a roux. It worked great and didn't alter the taste at all.
I used large skinless boneless chicken breasts in place of the thighs, because I enjoy that cut of meat better.
The only other very small alteration that I made was to the ginger. No one in my family likes ginger, therefore I substituted a small amount of ground cloves and nutmeg instead. Ohhh, it was yummy! I highly recommend trying this to anyone who is not a ginger lover. Simply add SMALL pinches of each spice, until you have reached your desired taste. Remember, you can always add more, but you can't take it back if it is too much!
This recipe is truly superb and much easier to make than my old one (which required you to stand at the stove constantly stirring). I threw the breasts into a casserole dish, topped with the sauce on both sides, and let it bake. I only had to open the oven a few times to turn the meat.
I served it with white rice and a broccoli/cauliflower mix. Thank you Ms. Collins for this wonderful recipe which will be going into my favorite recipe box to be used over and over again!

I fixed this for a crowd of non picky eaters and we all decided that it was not a keeper.  It was eaten, but my husband especially requested that I not make this again.

Made this last week.  Didn't change a thing except used plain white vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  Turned out perfect, eveyone loved it - served with basmati rice.  Great!  Thanks for the recipe...

This recipe is wonderful! The sauce is delicious and my chicken came out very moist and flavorful. I actually added about 1-1.5 extra tablespoons of sugar to the recipe (I was using regular soy sauce, so it helped cut down on some of the saltiness). I covered the chicken with foil and didn't baste every 10 minutes. I just set the oven on 375F, poured the sauce on, cooked for 30 minutes, flipped, basted and cooked for 20 more minutes. I took the foil off and cooked for 5 more minutes. Wonderful!

Highly recommend this.  I only used 2 breasts and the extra sauce for dipping.  Same amount of ingredients for the sauce. Only considered boneless, skinless chicken.  It may seem tedious for the basing, but it was really quick to do.  Added Pineapple at the end of the baking time.  Side of "Asian Sides"  "Teriyaki noodles" that took 7 min + cool down time.

Excellent and detailed recipe. I found the teriyaki too thick so added half cup of water. Also marinated the chicken in the sauce prior to baking. Would sugest using a termometer if you have it to avoid over cooking. As a side dish I made mexican rice . Family is asking for a repeat very soon.

I LOVE this recipe. I've made it twice so far and both times came out excellent. Actually exceeded my expectations. Definitely better than any other teriyaki chicken I have had. I followed the recipe exactly. No real need to make any changes. I did find that the chicken cooked in about 45 mins. Doesn't take the whole hour. ENJOY!

I have tried lots of recipes from this site and while I have really liked a lot of them, I have never felt compelled to write a review...until now!  This recipe is fantastic!  I followed the changes that Valerie's Kitchen recommended and everyone loved it.  My husband said he would gladly eat it every night.  And my son, who hates anything with sauce, is begging me to make it again.  It was also very easy.  I made it on a weeknight after work.

TRY THIS IN THE CROCKPOT! I doubled the sauce recipe, then added another two tbsp. of corn starch. I whisked the sauce ingredients and poured into my crockpot, placed two chicken breasts in and turned on LOW for 3 hours. The last hour I turned it up to HIGH to get the sauce to boil and thicken. IT WAS DELICIOUS over white sticky rice. My husband said this tasted better than any other teriyaki sauce he has had. He told me never to buy marinade again.

Tasty. I doubled the sauce but I'm not sure that was necessary. My chicken breasts released a lot of liquid so next time I may try baking on a rack-lined baking sheet so the sauce will stick better.

Very yummy.  Made breasts and thighs.  30 minutes was a little too long for breasts that were pounded.  I used maple syrup instead of sugar (about 3/4 amount called for).  Doubled sauce which was unnecessary for 6 thighs and 2 large breasts.

My family LOVED this!!  I took 3 large chicken breasts and just dumped all the above ingredients (marinade) in a plastic bag and froze it. Took less than 5 minutes! When we were ready we defrosted the chicken, cut it up in pieces and had an incredible stir fry.  EASY and so yummy! Added 3 cloves of garlic and a tsp of fresh ginger.

Made it just last night, came out amazing! Used 1 1/2 cup of honey instead of sugar and used a half cup of diluted malt vinegar in the place of cider vinegar. Came out Awesome and I agree with Valerie's Kitchen, doubling the sauce was a great idea. Would recommend to everyone! _Zooey

This was perfection! My boyfriend and I agree that the sauce tastes like it came straight from a restaurant. We found ourself scraping the extra from the bottom of the pan to dip the chicken in, so next time I'll make some more on the side. So good!

This has become a weekly favorite. We double the sauce and use chicken breasts although it is great on chicken thighs. My son eats everything every time.  We steamed broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage and made homemade teriyaki bowls! Fabulous! Lora Deanne

Really tasty. I used the sauce on pre-made meatballs. And, I did not have white sugar, so I used honey instead. Just FYI, using honey caused the sauce to be thinner. Only other mistake was that I did not double the sauce!

easy recipe to make! I double the sauce and make it with just 6 thighs. Leaves plenty of sauce to pour over white rice with the meal. Made it several times, everyone loves it. Didn't have meat left over and someone still wanted to take home the left over sauce just to eat with rice. I do marinate it, I make the sauce in the morning before i leave for work and throw it in a ziplock bag with the meat in the fridge. Then I come home and dump the bag into a dish to bake it in turning them over every 10-12 minutes while I make the veggies & rice. Just a wonderful recipe!

Great Recipe!!! Made this for my girlfriend's dad's birthday. Her whole family loved it and so did I. This went straight into my recipe book.

P.S. Follow the directions! the couple negative reviews I've seen for this recipe all didn't follow the directions. Cook them for 30 minutes on each side, not 30 minutes all together!

The recipe is OK as is, but I followed my mom and really modified the recipe.  First of all, you must double the sauce - there's no other way around it.  And no veggies?  Really?  I had never heard of teriyaki chicken without veggies, not to mention pineapple.  So we add sliced carrots (or baby carrots), sliced mushrooms, chunks of sweet onion, and a can of pineapple tidbits.  I reserved the juice and added to the sauce.  The best part?  Letting the chicken marinate in the sauce overnight.  That makes a HUGE difference.  And you will need to cook it longer depending upon the type of chicken you use.  I had to look for 90 minutes using bone-in, skinless thighs.  Next time I will use half boneless, skinless breasts and half thighs.

More than loved this recipe!!! I would definitely double the sauce especially if you want some for dipping purposes. I almost use boneless skinless breasts, but instead I chose to stick true to the recipe and I am SO GLAD I did! My boyfriend LOVES this chicken. The sauce is so easy too that you could use it for other recipes that call for teriyaki sauce. One thing I do feel like I have to complain about is that it ruined my baking pan somehow. The sauce got burnt to it pretty badly. I would use a glass dish or cover your pan with foil. Other than that it was the absolute BEST teriyaki chicken I have tasted. Thank you for sharing!

The sauce came together very easily - my only regret is I halved the amount of chicken for my two person household, and the chicken did not get to cook as long with that yummy, yummy sauce.  Very, very good.  I'll have to just make more next time.

This was excellent. I seldom make a meal that all 4 of my kids like -- let alone fight over what's left! (Note to self: make more than one package of thighs next time!) Per other reviewers, I doubled the sauce, tho I had extra left over so I don't know if it's necessary. It also made for a messy cleanup so next time I will line the pan. But easy and delicious!

UPDATE: I have made this recipe many times and have determined that using foil doesn't give the same caramelizing that a glass pan does. The recipe is 10x better when not using foil. Unfortunately, the clean-up is 50x worse!

Good flavor, and chicken was very moist. Doubled the sauce as suggested by several reviewers. Baked at 375° F for 45 minutes. I wanted a ‘sticky’ sauce that clings to the chicken but it wasn’t as thick as desired in spite of basting several times. Prior to making this recipe, the suggestions to foil the top of dish for about half the baking time seemed like a good idea for retaining moisture (more important for those using chicken breasts, and a lesser issue for those using thighs). The undesirable consequence is that the sauce doesn’t get as sticky thick when the moisture is trapped by covering the dish. The wide range of appearances in the 124 photos as of this date reflect the many different times, temps, foil/no foil, oven bake vs. grill, and other cooking variations being employed. Next time, I’ll use a roast 'n broil pan w/ rack so that the chicken doesn't sit in the drippings . . . or cook in a Big Green Egg. With trial and error adjustments, this recipe has the potential to be 5*.

This recipe is quick and delicious! I shared it with friends and I love it. I made the recipe as written but I'm sure I will alter it next time I make it (which will be today!)just to make it my own. I didn't have time to base the chicken but I did let turn my chicken over once and used the remaining sauce. I will double the recipe next time because the sauce is SO good!!

Definitely will not make again.  After seeing all great reviews made it for family and guests.  Followed the recipe exactly and the cider vinegar taste was too strong, everyone ate it but said nothing and my husband ran for the alka seltzer.  Clean up was not fun either!  Sorry but disappointed in this, I just don't understand the great reviews.

This recipe appealed to me as soon as I read it.  I appreciate the other reviews which mentioned the excess saltiness so I was able to cut down the amount of soy sauce, not having any of the low sodium variety. I also cut down on the amount of sugar. I also had some boneless thighs to use up and used some boneless breast meat to use as well, so I was glad of the guidance from the others suggesting the reduced times and reduced temperature.  I added the thighs first and gave them 10 minutes more than the cut up breast meat and basted all at the 10, 20 and 30 minute mark with just another 5 minutes to coat all before serving over rice.  I normally salt my rice but in this case let it cook without based on other reviews mentioning the saltiness.  It did the trick.  Thanks, Allrecipes and readers who offered their reviews.  :-) I have enough left over for another meal for the two of us and will definitely use this recipe again.

My family loves it. I use a package of boneless skinless chicken thighs that usually has 12 thighs. I double the marinade. Only cuz I'm lazy, I dump a bunch of marinade on the chicken in a bowl, stir it around, then arrange on a broiler pan. Then every 15 minutes baste and flip til you hit the 1 hour mark. I serve with rice and sauteed teriyaki greenbeans. I did run out of minced garlic one time and substituted with garlic powder. Worked very well too.

This is an awesome teriyaki recipe!  I had 4 chicken breasts and apple cider vinegar.  I reduced the cooking time to 25 minutes total.  Also, as the chicken cooled a little and the asparagus baked, I basted and the sauce ended up nice and thick. Very very good!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because it has potential.  I found it to be way too sweet and so did my husband! 
1.) I doubled the sauce (next time I will NOT double the sugar & might even half) also, had to add extra water/cornstarch mixture to get the thickness I like.
2.) Poured all of mixture over chicken thighs and it covered them all perfectly
3.) Lastly, I cooked on 375 for 25 minutes.  DO NOT cook at 425 for an hour!!  Your chicken will be totally dry.    So, I will try this recipe again but will use the changes that I stated above.  Think it will be much better next time.  Oh, and brown rice takes longer but the flavor of the rice is way better with this dish (and most) over white rice.  Plus, it's healthier!

This came out fantastic after a few changes based on other reviews. I used 4 boneless skinless breasts cut in half. Line the baking dish with foil for easy cleanup. Definitely double the sauce! I don't think it would have been enough sauce if I didn't double it. Used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white. Baked at 375 for 25 minutes, flipping once and dumping more sauce on the chicken. Sprinkled with green onions, served with rice and steamed spinach. So delicious!!

This recipe was amazing! I used chicken breasts and thighs and I must say that I preferred the thighs! I read some of the comments that suggested covering the chicken with foil and next time I make this I won't cover the chicken at all. I doubled the sauce recipe and am so glad I did. However in doubling the recipe I only used a scant 3/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce.  You must try this! It's exactly like the chicken teriyaki from my favourite Japanese restaurant!

Other than using chicken quarters instead of just thighs, I made this to the letter of the recipe and it was fantastic.  Definitely a do over.  The only think I didn't like was having to clean the baked on teriyaki sauce.  Ugh!  Maybe next time I'll use foil to line the pan.

Spiced it up by adding some sriracha. Doubled the sauce to keep it from drying out because I used breasts instead of thighs.  Used batch one before I put it in the oven. Make sure to line the pan with foil.

Made this in the slow cooker.  Wasn't sure b/c the ingredients seemed so simple, but tried it anyway b/c of the great reviews.  Made it exactly as stated, just poured the sauce over the chicken.  After a couple hours it didn't look like enough sauce so I made another batch of sauce and poured it in.  After about 6 hours on low I shredded the chicken and let it go for another hour or so.  We loved it and were surprised by the full flavor of the sauce. My husband suggested adding pineapple (as have other reviewers) so I'll be trying that next time.  Delicious!!!

I made this as directed and found it to be too heavy in soy taste.   I will make this again but I think I will cut the soy in half and add either some pineapple chunks or honey for sweetness.   I think I would also sub in white pepper for the black pepper.

Fantastic.  I only used about half the amount of chicken thighs, so I would double sauce if I were to use more thighs.  Delicious without any changes!

This was amazing. I doubled the recipe for extra sauce and it was a huge hit . Kids loved it. Husband loved it. I opted to use Light Brown Sugar due to personal preference but which ever way it's made it's amazing!You can either just bake your chicken in it or use it for basting..dipping..endless possibilities for it's use.I even used it to baste on Italian Sausage's that I was grilling   Thank you!

This is a favorite in my house.   
Boneless skinless chicken thighs are a great value.    The sauce is so good that I always make a double batch to serve with the rice and vegetables.  I do modify it by using brown sugar instead of white.

This recipe was, by far, the best teriyaki recipe I've ever tried. Super simple to make! Had all the ingredients in my pantry/fridge anyway. Not hard at ALL to prepare. And my family loved it. We all went back for seconds....no left over here. Served it with stir fried fresh veggies and basmati rice. Next time (oh YES! There WILL BE a next time), I'm going to try this with boneless pork ribs. Try this and you will not be disappointed!!

This recipe is amazing! Here's what I did differently. Instead of bone in thighs, I used boneless. Switched out the soy for low sodium, and instead of cider vinegar I used a red  wine vinegar.  Instead of baking, I pat dried the chicken thighs and grilled them (about 8 minutes per side on medium high heat). Let stand for 5 minutes, slice chicken into thin strips and serve over white rice with desired amount of sauce. Also, serving with boiled cabbage isn't too bad either!

I followed suggestions and used brown sugar, and doubled the recipe for sauce, I also reduced temp to 375 and baked covered for 35 and uncovered for another 15. Perfect! Hubby gave it a 12 out of 10 ;)

Made this for dinner tonight.  Took the advice of others and used brown sugar instead of white.  Good enough there was a debate between hubby and little man about who was going to take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  LOL

Though it does take attention to it of basting every ten minutes, it is absolutely delicious. Follow the instructions to the t until you really got it in terms of basting. Your family and friends will love it.  The recipe for the teriyaki sauce is probably better than anything you buy in a bottle. I am so glad to have learned how to make REAL LIVE TERIYAKI SAUCE.

Yummm..used chicken breast chunks, instead of thighs. Baked at 425 for 35 minutes. Delicous over brown rice! Will make this simple recipe again. DH put left overs in a pita pocket with lettuce and enjoyed it that way as well.

Far and away the best teriyaki sauce recipe that I've found.  And I've tried a lot.  It has a nice, rich texture and perfect not-too-sweet sweetness.  I usually fry the chicken instead of baking, but the sauce recipe works just the same.  Highly recommended!

This was very delicious! I ended up cooking half in a square pan and half in a pie pan.  The sauce was the perfect amount for my 13 pieces of chicken.  I'll definitely make it again!

So I love this recipe, I made one big change. I cut the chicken up and cooked it on the stove and then added the sauce and mushrooms. It was fantastic and cutting the chicken and cooking it on the stove cuts the cook time almost in half

I used chicken breasts and put a layer of foil in my pan, then just added all of the sauce over the chicken.  I turned the chicken over halfway through.  Even my picky husband thought it was amazing!

I like to make teriyaki bowls for dinner I did not have any sauce so found this one and made it it was great!   It is a do over as we say in our house.  I read the reviews and did what they said.  I used lite soy sauce and used 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar instead of sugar.  My dad is diabetic so this helps.  I just poured over the boneless thighs and cooked covered at 400 degrees for 30 minutes then uncovered for 25 minutes.  I will make this again served over rice with steamed veggies very good!

I have made this recipe 4 times now.  The only thing I omit is the ginger and I do double the sauce recipe.  Quick trick, don't cook the sauce in a pot, make your sauce and pour over chicken arranged in the pan, about an hour before cooking.  I put my thighs skin side up until ready to turn on the oven (maximum 390f).  When I turn on my oven I turn the chicken skin side down for half hour of cooking time, then flip to skin side up for last half hour.  That way the tops get a nice glaze to them and the meat absorbs the flavor.  The house smells amazing and the chicken looks professional.  We love this recipe and use it on pork, chicken and meat balls to be served with rice.  Yummy thank you! 
Clean up is easy as this is a sugar based recipe, occassionally I will line my pan with parchment paper but it's not really needed. Tin foil rips off when serving because the sugar is sticky and glazed, and ultimately makes a bigger mess.  Soapy hot water cleanup is all you need.

This was good. I used BLSL and more or less immersed them in sauce. I uncovered and only basted them the last 15 minutes so as not to get my brush unsanitary. I do think the key to this recipe is to simmer the sauce so it gets nice and thick, because the chicken will water it down so you want it nice and thick going on. If we liked chicken with skin on it, that would be better too because the sauce will stick better to skin. I served this with plain brown rice and some peppers/onions/pineapple that I stir-fried. Thanks for sharing!  NOTE: I used 3 BLSL breast halves with this amount of sauce.

Awesome recipe!! I don't use as much sugar. I also use white sugar and brown sugar, just like the past reviews. I use more of the brown sugar. I also add a bit of grounded chilli peppers for a little spice, and a bit of sweet and sour chilli sauce for a bit of a zing.

My husband loved it, I thought it was pretty good...When boiling all the ingredients together, the sauce got nice and thick. After baking it, however, it was all very runny and did not stick to the chicken as well as the picture suggests. More incentive to use a baking dish and pour the leftover sauce over chicken after baking.

Excellent recipe - all my picky eaters loved it.  Definitely keep basting every 10 mins, makes all the difference!

I made this dish precisely according to the recipe and while it was flavorful and moist, I would agree with other reviewers that a) there was not enough sauce and b) the sauce was rather salty. When I make this again I will probably double the sauce and use low-sodium soy sauce.

The sauce-absolutely WONDERFUL. My family has asked for me just to make the sauce in bulk to give to them. 
The reason I gave the recipe 3 stars, it doesn't say to cover the chicken before placing it in the oven. It makes a huge difference. Cover it with aluminum foil or wax paper, and pour most of the sauce in with the chicken and then cook it.
If you try to bake it uncovered and just brush it lightly with the sauce, it is extremely dry. 
COVER  BEFORE YOU BAKE IT!!!!!!
Other than thatm its great!

This was pretty good. I made changes due to what was in the house and hubby really liked it. I thought it was good but I didn't think it tasted like true teriyaki sauce. I doubled the ingredients and used brown sugar instead of regular sugar and chicken breasts and tenderloins instead of thighs. I halved the ginger per my personal preference. I made the sauce and then marinated the chicken in it for 3 hours. Finally, I covered the pyrex with foil and cooked at 400 for 30 minutes. I'll make it again.

This was amazing.  The only substitutions I made were to use light brown sugar instead of white sugar, and I used lower-sodium soy sauce, as it's what I had in the house.  Basted it at 20 minutes, then again after another 20 minutes; took it out at about 55 minutes.  Absolutely delicious, wouldn't change a thing, other than next time, I'll line the baking dish with aluminum foil!

I made it, doubled it. For some reason, the taste of ginger over took everything. I added about a teaspoon or a bit more of lemon juice. I used chicken breasts. I injected them with it at 15 minutes, then basted it, then allowed it to cook for 15 more minutes. The chicken tasted not so full of flavor, which is surprising.

Only thing I did was line my pan with foil so it made for easy clean up :)

My kids and I really enjoyed this.  I cooked 4 chicken breast at 375 for 30 min and flipped them half way basting a 2nd time.  I stir fried some veggies and added the sauce to them.  When the chicken came out of the 8x8 casserole dish I used to cook it in, I sliced it and tossed it back in the dish so the glaze could coat all the chicken...delcious.  I also made rice on the side.  I will definetly make this dish again.

This is the best homemade teriyaki sauce I've ever had.  It makes a mess of my baking dish when I bake it in the oven, so I cook everything on the stove instead and let the chicken simmer in the sauce.  Fantastic.

This recipe was ok but not one I'd make again. I used skinless thighs and doubled the sauce as someone recommended. Sauce never thickened up as I was hoping the sauce would stick to the chicken.

I've made this a few times with both white and dark meat. I follow the exact recipe and it's absolutely awesome. After the chicken has been baking for a while, I like to add some chopped fresh broccoli to the perimeter of the baking dish and then baste everything a few times during the remainder of the cooking time. Serve over steamed jasmine rice and you get healthy homemade Chinese food!

The sauce is a little bit too salty and sticky. I would recommend to use low-sodium soy sauce. Also, laying some onions under the chicken would bring out the flavor.

Absolutely wonderful.  I followed some others suggestion and doubled the sauce, used lower sodium soy sauce and used half brown and half white sugar.  I dumped all the sauce over the chicken at the start and baked 110 min. at 375.  I covered with foil the first half, then removed it. I did turn them half way through and basted the tops about 5 minutes before they were done. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs cut in half because I wanted smaller pieces and I had also put a couple of chicken breast tenderloins in to see what tasted better.  The thighs win hands down.  

My son ate his over rice and I made a stirfry of red and green bell peppers, celery and cabbage which I put the chicken over.  It was great!  Can't wait for the leftovers!

I just finished making and eating this chicken....it was DELICIOUS. I used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar because it's what I had, but I will definitely be making this again...maybe with pork or beef too.

Excellent,Easy, and Tender!! Cut back on sugar slightly ... but NOT by 1/2. Cooked 4 chicken breast and covered with tin foil. Removed tin foil the last 15-20 minutes. Sauce thickened in the oven. Served with wild rice. Did not need to increase the amount of sauce ... had plenty of sauce and some left over.

WOW, was this delicious.  I followed the recipe except for subbing rice wine vinegar for apple cider and by using four boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I cut the breasts up and let them marinate in the sauce for about 4 hours before cooking.  I baked them uncovered at 375 for 15 mins, flipped the pieces over and baked for another 15 mins.  The sauce is out of this world.  I had plenty for my 4 chicken breasts with some left over for dipping.  I'll be making this recipe again for sure.

Tried this over the weekend. Came out GREAT. Followed the comments, lined the pan with foil which is a MUST. cut the soy sauce in half to lower the salt and it was perfect. My 11 yr old says we should always cook chicken this way! It's a hit and super easy.

Really enjoyed this.  I made full recipe of sauce for half the chicken.  I think it would not have been enough otherwise.  Also ended up baking the chicken for 45 minutes total, so that cut some of the overall prep time.  I made the sauce while the oven was preheating so the timing was great.

I made this for dinner last night and everyone LOVED it.  Even my 7 year old, who will usually complain that he doesn't like something without even trying it.
I had about 8 big thighs and made the recipe exactly as directed.  It created so much of it's own sauce in the baking pan it was great to pour even more over the chicken once on your plate.
I'm definitely making this again and would like to make it for a crowd.

Easy, quick and hands free. Works for me on a busy night with kiddies. I doubled garlic, ginger and used light soya and added extra 1/3 cup water to make sauce go further. Ate over white rice.  Everyone loved including 4 year old.

This recipe was delicious!! Immediately after reading the reviews, I decided to make this for dinner.  I doubled the recipe and added ½ a cup of brown sugar as well as white sugar.  I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them up into strips and served them over steamed brown rice and veggies.  I am in the process of creating a recipe scrapbook and this recipe has made it’s way in without a doubt.

This was excellent. I was worried that using chicken thighs would result in greasy chicken, but it wasn't at all.  I made this exactly to the recipe. It is accurate in saying 2 thighs are one serving.  Yummy!

Divine! I took some earlier advice and lined my baking dish with foil and doubled the sauce (didn't really need to, but I'm glad I did). I will absolutely, without a doubt be making this again! Love it! Thanks so much!!!

Delicious sauce but DOUBLE it! The stated amount is good for about a pound of chicken. Would be GREAT w/ wings!! I made w/chick breast b/c thats what I had on hand. Used 1 tsp grated ginger and increased the garlic. Used brown sugar instead of white, decreasing it just a tad but not much. #Keeper. UPDATE 8/3/12 I made these with wings yesterday and they were AWESOME!! My 10 yr old son is obsessed w/Zaxby teriyaki wings and this is the first time I came close to their high rating lol. I baked them at 400. Doubled sauce and poured half over wings before baking, then basted every 10 min roughly until wings were done and sauce was gone. Finger licking good!

My kids loved this so much that my son had me make it it 2 nights in a row! The basting sauce really thickened while it sat on the stove between basting, so I used a little of the pan drippings to thin it out.  :)

When I made this recipe I doubled it and made the following substitutions: used 1/2 cup Kikkoman Soy Sauce, 1/2 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce (because I didn't have enough Soy Sauce), 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. Before I even got it onto the chicken I was sampling it and thought it was amazing. Based on my experience with this recipe, I think it would take great even if you didn't make any changes. Definitely a recipe worth trying.

The sauce from this recipe tastes just like a local teriyaki place. We added a little bit of red chili flakes to spice it up, and I needed a bit of extra cornstarch to get the consistency I wanted. Otherwise, used this as is... cut the soy sauce with water to dull down the salt a bit, and used white vinegar instead of cider because we didn't have any. Will be making again & trying on the BBQ at some point. :D

This sauce is amazing!  It's wonderful on chicken thighs, as suggested.  I also used it as a glaze for a pork tenderloin, and that was great too.  Haven't tried it yet, but I bet the sauce would be great for party wings.

Great tasting chicken.  The sauce is strong so needs to be used sparingly on rice.
8-7-12: Also a '5'.

This one got rave reviews in our house.  I will no longer be purchasing teriyaki sauce in a jar.  I was concerned since it didn't taste as sweet as I was accustomed as I was simmering it, but it enhances in flavor as it glazes over on the chicken.  Next time, I will make 2X recipe and pour the excess over brown rice as a side dish.  That suggestion came directly from my teenagers!

We now use this recipe to marinate all our meat for the BBQ. It is delicious!

This was excellent! Following others' advice, I doubled the sauce (good advice). I also halved the sugar and used brown only. It came out beautifully and my husband went back for more sauce! Thanks so much!!

Too salty! I am not sure how to cut this down since there is so much soy, but at a minimum - use reduced sodium soy sauce!

Easy recipe. Definitely line the baking dish w/ tinfoil, it will make your clean-up easier. 3 out of 4 of my children liked this recipe. Be aware of the salt factor. But other then that, try it out!

Delicious. The chicken turned out tender and with enough sauce leftover to drizzle on top.  I combined the meal with steamed broccoli and some baked butternut squash with brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and butter.

This was a  big hit! My hubby usually won't touch anything made with Teriyaki sauce, so I just told him it was a different sauce recipe and he LOVED it. He went back to two more helpings. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. Next time though I think I will try it with boneless skinless breasts cut into chunks, add some pineapple chunks while baking, and serve it over rice. If you're in a hurry, this should cut the baking time down by at least half.

LOVE!  I doubled the sauce (but only used 1/2c of sugar) and then poured 2/3 of that into a separate bowl for basting.  The rest I served tableside for dipping.  My 5 yr old couldn't stop telling me how good the sauce was!

was good; followed other advise and doubled sauce, also cooked 20 min with tin foil cover, and 10 with it off. Used breasts. Think it would have been better if I had marinated the chicken a bit first.

This is a good recipe for teriyaki.  Not sure if I will make again though because it is very salty.  I had trouble getting my children to eat which surprised me because they usually like sauces like this.

I used to make this one regularly, until my family got tired of it. I did 1/4 brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar, used 1/2 lite soy sauce to reduce saltiness, subbed potato or tapioca starch for the corn starch, put it on 350 degrees. For step 3, I don't brush it on - I just pour the sauce over because I don't have a brush, and don't want additional cleanup. I listened to reviews and doubled the sauce so that it can be paired over rice. I also baked it covered with aluminum foil to retain moisture because without the foil, I think it'd be pretty dry and nasty.  Not my cup of tea but my friend's kids liked it. I give it 3 stars because of all the alterations made, and that it's something you can easily get tired of if you make it regularly, despite all that sugar.

Great homemade teriyaki!  The family gobbled it up served with brown rice & pan fried asparagus.  Unlike other posters I found there to be exactly enough sauce without having to double the recipe or anything like that.  I basted every 15 minutes.  However, a word of caution, do not leave in the oven for much longer than instructed!  I turned the oven off and left it to caramelize slightly as there was literally no caramalization... just a nice thick sauce.  No more than 7 minutes later, the sauce had separated and sugars had burned.  Chicken itself was still excellent but next time I'll leave it be, or drain off the sauce before trying to caramelize!

I'm sure I would have enjoyed this recipe in its entirety. However, due to diet restrictions I had to make some substitutions. I replaced the sugar with Stevia and the chicken thighs with boneless skinless chicken breasts. The chicken was excellent! I served it with whole wheat couscous and steamed broccoli.

Whats better than going to chines restaurant? This recipe. Like others have said, it's a good idea to double up on the sauce, and cover the baking dish with foil to help keep the chicken tender. This has become one of my favorite recipes!

The taste of this is just ok. The sauce was even thicker when I stirred all the ingredients in the saucepan, however, when I transferred the sauce in the baking dish the thickness disappeared so I got all the sauce again and stirred everything up on the saucepan. I guess next time when I do this again, I will raise to 1 1/2 teaspoon - 1 tablespoon ginger to add up a bit on the taste. Will definitely do this again next time with a bit modification I guess. Thank you Marian!

Very tasty, and very easy to make!  Also great on vegetables.  I'm going to try this with beef on my BBQ in a couple of weeks.

My husband ended up making this in a skillet instead of the oven, but it was excellent.  I can't wait to share this "homemade" teriyaki chicken with my parents as they normally buy theirs in a bag from a club store.

It came out delicious! great call on doubling up on the sauce. That was perfect for 10 chicken thighs. The sauce took a little long to thicken on low heat so I increased it to a medium low. All in all great dish. I will definitely be cooking it again.

Loved this recipe and so easy! I also used lite soy sauce and cut back on the sugar. Used 6 chicken thighs so cut the cooking time down. Kids gobbled it up! Thanks!

Excellent!  I used low sodium soy sauce and more cornstarch for a thicker consistency. I baked the thighs at 425 for 30 minutes, brushed with more sauce, and baked for an additional 30 minutes. Husband and teenage son loved them!

I love this dish!  I certainly agree with doubling the sauce...there just wasn't enough to brush on every 10 minutes.  How good is it?  I caught my husband in the kitchen licking the pan!!  Enjoy!

I adjusted this recipe several ways.  I used boneless chicken thighs, malt vinegar, and splenda brown sugar.The cooking time was reduced to 30 minutes.
I would also double the sauce for basting during baking. This is great.

5+++++++++++ stars!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband loves good Teriyaki so I decided to try this recipe! I was skeptical at first because when I started cooking the sauce it smelled like it would have too much of a vinegar flavor.. but after it was cooked all of the flavors evened out perfectly to make the best Teriyaki sauce I have ever had! My husband raved about it All night saying it was the best he ever had, and even said it could be at a fancy stake house! 
I did a couple changes to it... I put 1/4 brown sugar and 1/4 white, and I left out the ginger because I didn't have any. Also I used boneless skinless breasts and cut them up small so the flavor would get all around! I will be making again, thank you Marian for sharing! :)

This recipe is fantastic!  The sauce has become my go-to terriyaki sauce for any stir-fry I can conceive of.  I use fresh ginger and red pepper flakes to add a bit of a kick.  Thanks, Marian for a superb recipe.

Best teriyaki sauce I have had. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar (and doubled the sauce). My girlfriend liked it so much she wiped her plate clean with her finger so could get every last bit!

I made this again last night and the entire family loved it.  This time I doubled the sauce and served the chicken over rice.  I used the extra sauce to pour over the rice and the roasted vegies I made.  I use boneless/skinless thighs.  Thanks for this simple and delicious recipe.

Very good! This is the first time I have made a sauce myself vs. buying a bottled version at the store! So needless to say I was so proud! I did use red wine vinegar b/c that's what I had on hand. Made a pot of white rice, and had stir fry veggies on the side. Yummy goodness my entire family enjoyed! Thanks!

Wonderful.  When I "tested" it after trying the recipe for the first time, I ate entire chicken thigh before I could even get the meal to the table.  Will make again and again.

EXCELLENT recipe!!  I doubled the sauce, too, and just let it bake in the sauce.  This sauce works wonderful with pork as well!!  Definitely a 5-star!!  Addendum:  Great for slow cooker!  Threw the sauce in crock with meatballs... turned out awesome!!

Very good on its own as a tame version! I like a little more tang, so I added 1tsp ginger paste instead of ground, someting equivalent to the juice from 2 limes (too lazy to measure) and a tbsp of Szechwan chili sauce.  So good!!!

Excellent sauce!  Doubled recipe and mixed brown and white sugar (but not as much as called for). We love a garlicky teriyaki, so I added 4 cloves of garlic to the doubled recipe.   Pierced thighs with fork before brushing sauce on there.  Also due to time constraints, I seared the thighs on both sides before putting in oven to cook faster. Sesame seeds were added to sauce and put on top of rice with thighs.  Super good!

I've made this twice now. I made a couple changes when I did it. I used garlic powder instead of real garlic and poured all the sauce into the baking pan and covered it. I flipped it a few times during baking and left it uncovered for the last bit. Family loves the teriyaki sauce!!!

I used frozen chicken tenders and let them marinate as they thawed.  It really is better than bottled teriyaki.

This recipe was SO easy! I REALLY mean that it is EASY! I don't know how to cook very well...and this came out FANTASTIC!. It made the house smell wonderful. My husband loved it and so did his buddy. I did not have white sugar, but instead I used brown sugar but just a little less. It was yummy! Thanks for the great compliments I got from my husband and his buddy!

Yum! Flavorful and liked the thickness of the sauce which clinged to the meat and didn't drip off. I liked that I didn't have to marinade for hours. It was quick and easy. Clean up was a mess though, I used glass pyrex lightly greased..next time I will line with well greased foil.

This was simply awesome.  Added a bit of Chinese chili and garlic paste to give it a little bammmm!  My Other half don't like meals to be sweet. The paste give a good off set to the buds.   Next day leftover was even better. Diffently a keeper in our house

The only thing I did differently was reduce the sugar by about half.  After the chicken was done, I poured the sauce over steamed green beans.  Yum, yum, yum!

I thought this was great.  Very easy, very tasty.  Even the 6 year old liked it, and believe me, that's saying something.  I followed the recipe exactly except I just dumped all the sauce over the chicken and baked at 375.  I didn't think it was too salty.  I served over rice w/onion, and drizzled the extra sauce from the baking pan over top.  We'll definitely be making this again!

We THOROUGHLY enjoyed this. I only made 4 chicken thighs (w/ skin), but after reading the reviews I decided to make the full amount of sauce. I also put foil on top for the first 30 minutes. It was delicious, and was also thoroughly cooked in 45 minutes.

Very good sauce.. I substituted soy sauce with store bought teriyaki since soy sauce is too salty.. Instead of minced garlic added powdered garlic and these were wonderful.. Also added a little mirin.. Delicious sauce

This is a number one favorite at our house! So juice, tender, and delicious. The only thing I do different, and boy does it make a difference, if make a double batch and I marinade my chicken in a tightly closed zip lock pack (flipping over periodically) for 2 full days. Then I cook it exactly as the recipe calls for. I have tried this recipe with and without marinading the meat and I have to say that when it is marinated, it is 10 times better! Thank you so much for this recipe! We love it with steamed broccoli and carrots with a little sauce added after the steaming process and some homemade fried rice. Delicious!

This was so delicious!!! So moist and tender! I did use 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar and cooked at 400 for 35 minutes. I did cover for the first 20 minutes as well. Now a staple in my book!

This is a great sauce to make any teriyaki dish. Sometimes I just use vegetables and it's great.  We don't like things as sweet so I usually cut back on the sugar a bit, but I've had it as is, and it's wonderful.

I was excited to try this recipe after seeing so many great reviews on it.  As I was simmering the marinade, the vinegar was SO pungent, I started to hesitate, but it came out GREAT!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and cooked 20 min, then flipped sides, and cooked another total of 25 minutes. I don't think it needed that, but I flipped it often to try and get a good caramelization on the chicken.  There was too much marinade for what I made, but it came out DELICIOUS!  My kids LOVED it.  I also did what others did, used lite soy sauce, and also microplaned ginger, since I didn't have ground ginger.

This is the first time that I had cooked teriyaki chicken using a recipe card(I usually use just bottled teriyaki sauce) and I had to say this is the best teriyaki chicken I ever had.When I started preparing it I allowed chicken to marinate in sauce for a few hours(8am-2pm). I did a minimal change to the recipe, in that I only used half of the soy sauce the recipe card called for and replaced the other half with teriyaki sauce. I cooked chicken at 425 degrees uncovered and loved the color of chicken after it was done cooking. I did not see a need to baste chicken every ten minutes, but I allowed chicken to cooked 30 minutes on each side. Instead of whole chicken I used chicken wings. I really enjoyed this recipe and I am looking forward to cooking it in the near future!!!

After reading many reviews, I decided to make this recipe as it called for but using just 2 boneless chicken breasts.  There was plenty of sauce left over for pouring over the rice and veggies we served with the chicken.  I baked it at 375 for about 30 min in a small cast iron frying pan covered with foil.  I did think it was a bit more salty than I would have liked, but it was still very good and my husband raved about it.  I'm sure I will make it again.

This was delicious!  Really easy to make, but I think next time I'll take the advice of one of the other raters and line my baking dish with aluminum foil.  That sauce was great, but made a big sticky mess.  Definitely will be making this one for the family on a regular basis!

I will have to say this is delicious and moist. The sauce is plentiful and amazing-even though it will knock the roof off my insulin resistance.  Made a double recipe and am freezing it.

This is a great recipe! I added yellow and orange peppers. I also added medium sized sliced onions as well as broccoli. All vegetables were steamed and served on top of the chicken and rice. That would have pushed it to a 5 star recipe. I will be adding this to the lineup for sure!!!!

Cook the chicken for less when cooing on high, otherwise chicken is very dry. 
Use only the amount of corn starch they recommend, the juice will seem thin. But the flavor is really good.

I really liked this recipe.  As a southern gal who frequents Houston often, I can be picky with my mexican food.  I did a few things differently by adding 5 chili peppers, reducing to 2 anaheim peppers, 2 tomatillo and 2 jalapeno peppers.  I used about 3 cups of beef broth rather than the beef bouillon and because I needed more liquid so as to eat like a soup.  Lastly, I cut the cream cheese in half because DH is not a fan.  Turned out delicious!  Cant wait to cook again!

This was absolutely delicious.  I used a whole cut up chicken instead of chicken thighs and it was good.  I would recommend adding a little bit more cornstarch just to thicken up the sauce more though.  The teriyaki flavor is quite good and not overwhelming, so it will probably please most palates.

It was so salty from the soy that I had to rinse the chicken and try to salvage it...but no luck. It had already absorbed the soy sauce.  I love soy sauce, but this was not what I was expecting.  I was hoping for the sweet and tangy taste of Teriyaki.

This is finger-licking yummy!  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Marian.  Made the recipe exactly as written, but used four thighs and four legs.  Next time I will line the pan with foil for easier clean-up.

Well, this is my first attempt at writing a review, so here goes:  I thought this sauce had excellent flavor and was a beautiful color.  We are "sauce" people, so since I was using boneless, skinless chicken breasts (5) instead of thighs, I thought I should make extra.  I tripled the sauce mix and was GLAD I did!  After basting a cooking, the liquid cooked away to almost nothing.  When I try this again (which will probably be awhile since there are a million other receipes), I will definitely make even more sauce.  This was excellent with rice and stirfried veggies.  My family gave it a thumbs up :)

Awesome sauce!.. I didn't have any ginger, but I really didn't miss it.  Used bone in thighs, but next time will use chicken breast as I prefer white meat. I did as others & doubled the sauce, happy I did!  Thanks for a great easy recipe.

This sauce is AWESOME!  This is my first time making this and the chicken is in the oven as I type.  The sauce is better than any bottled teriyaki sauce. It's thick, bubbly, glossy and delicious.  I doubled the sauce but used 1 heaping tablespoon of ginger because it gives it a nice kick.  I can't wait to taste the chicken and then I'll be back to write a second review.  Btw, we used chicken thighs and drummets.  Next time, I'll try chicken breasts. I'm also definitely going to try this on Salmon, then put the salmon over an Asian salad (recipe on here also).

This was a very good recipe.  A pick from my recipe box by my boyfriend, and he LOVED it.  We made double the sauce, but we only had about 6 thighs, so we had plenty of sauce.  We served it with rice and an Asian veggie mix that we mixed together.  Since we had so much sauce left we ended up mixing it right into the rice/veggie mix.  It was great!!

Really yummy.  I changed it a tiny bit, but I suspect it would have been delicious originally anyway.  All I did was use half white sugar and half brown sugar, and I almost reduced the soy sauce to half (I doubled the recipe and used a little less than 3/4 of a cup).  Yes, it's essential to double the recipe.  I used 3 chicken breasts (sliced in half to make 6 servings), and I grilled them and put the sauce on them 3 times.  There was a tiny bit left over, but my husband thought it could have used a little more sauce still.  And that was doubled.  I have no idea how this could be enough for 12 thighs!  Oh, and it is NOT too salty with regular soy sauce.  I think if you used lite soy, you'd have to add some salt to it to get the true teriyaki flavor.

The baking temperature is right on, as far as I'm concerned. I used skinless, boneless thighs, which make a much, much tastier teriyaki than breasts do. Just follow the recipe, and it's a sure favorite!

Basting the chicken every 10 minutes is a must for the flavor. 400F for 35minutes was the cooking time I used per the comments.  Thanks for the new keeper.

This is excellent.  My only suggestion would be to reduce the vinegar by about 1/3.  Also- great on the grill- we grilled chicken breasts and basted them after an initial searing, then reserved some of the warm sauce to drizzle over the chicken and sides (rice). Super yummy.

This is a good back up if your out of jarred teriyaki sauce. The kids liked it. I thought it needed something more so I sprinkled mine with toasted sesame seeds.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs. I cut the sugar to 1/2 c. of brown sugar and 1/4 c. of white sugar. I cooked it at 375*for 15 minutes then cooked at 400* for 15 minutes. I wish I would have kept it at 375 for the whole time because some pieces came out a little dry. Served over rice and steamed mushrooms, broccoli & carrots. Will definitely make again!

WOW! This was pretty darn good! My boyfriend and I LOVE the sauce! The only thing is, as others have said, 425 degrees is much too high- You can turn down the heat to 400 or even 375 degrees and it will come out great. The sauce burned badly (no surprise, as it contains sugar) and it took me ages to get the black mess off my pan. Definitely line your pan with foil just in case! I've used this sauce with chicken drumsticks and wings as well and we're always licking our fingers afterwards. I like to place the sauce and chicken in a ziploc bag and let it marinate for at least a couple hours. Yumm-y!

I used boneless chicken breasts and apple cider vinegar as that is what I had on hand. I think the apple cider vinegar gave the sauce a flavor that would be great with pork but it was only okay with chicken. The recipe is relatively easy to follow and so I will be using it in the future.

Great way to make chicken thighs. Hubster usually does not like them, but ate seconds w/this recipe and the kids ate it, too!

Tasty sauce, but may need to marinate the chicken in it for a little bit so that the flavor gets absorbed into the meat.

Great Teriyaki flavor!!!  Easy for a luau gathering so no one stuck at the bbq.  Tip:  To save clean-up time...I used a roasting bag & untied it the last few minutes of cooking, just long enough to brown up a bit.  Pretty it up by placing some pineapple rings on top of platter.

Tasted GREAT!  Used Splenda Blend instead of straight sugar and didn't taste any difference.  Sauce thickened very quickly.  Went together fast and easy.

Marian, thank you for a truly wonderful Teriyaki Sauce recipe !!! I only slightly changed it. I made a double batch, and, instead of using 1 cup of white sugar, I used 3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar, with 1/4 cup white sugar. We were very pleased with the results. I'm looking forward to making it again, and this next time, along with the sugar variation, I plan on using pineapple juice instead of cider vinegar.

Fabulous recipe!!!  I loved the teriyaki sauce recipe, but I prepared my meal on the stove top.  I made half the volume of sauce and poured it over ~1 lb of chicken breast that was cut into bite-sized pieces.  I let this marinade overnight in the fridge.  The next day, I poured off the marinade and cooked the chicken in a non-stick pan (no oil added).  The chicken was very tasty but a bit tough when prepared this way.  Just for fun, I made another half-volume of the sauce and poured it into the pan after the chicken had cooked through, then thickened it with a bit of cornstarch and water.  WARNING:  When cooked this way, the sauce is a bit intense.  Next time I'll leave the sauce off, try reducing the amount of vinegar, or I'll actually bake the chicken as directed by this recipe. :)

Great recipe, and so easy.  I made mine with boneless chicken tenderloins to cut down on the bake time, added some hot pepper flakes as others had suggested.  I also double the sauce and did half white sugar half brown.  Will make again.

I mixed sauce ingredients and poured over boneless chicken thighs and covered with foil.  Baked at 350 for 55 mins.  Chicken was oh so tender.  Very good - it's a keeper.

Proof that good teriyaki can also be easy! I used 5 thighs with 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of white (some may want more if they like it sweeter), low-sodium soy sauce. Cooked at 375 for 30 minutes, then lowered to 325 for 30 minutes. Basted twice every 15 minutes for the first half hour, then just poured on the rest and let it ride. I'll use bonless skinless breasts next time since the thighs were a bit oily for my taste, but the sauce is a keeper! Thanks!

This was the easiest and most amazing chicken dish. I was gloating the whole time that I made this sauce from scratch. I normally buy the teriyaki sauce, but not this time! I had people over and I tried this dish as soon as I received the email from allrecipes. It tasted like restaurant quality. My picky children loved the taste. The guests loved them and of course my husband did too. My family ate them the next day too and my daughter took a dish to her friend's house. I didn't change anything in the recipe or I would be rating my own! I only added a bit more of each ingredient as I did the whole leg cut up into two pieces each. That made 24 pieces. I didn't double the sauce, just a few tbsps more. I didn't find ginger powder so I used ginger paste, but past experience taught me to just put a tiny bit. So I used just as much as a pea size for the whole thing which didn't do much. I am telling you, try it and you will NOT regret it. My kids asked for it again for next weekend!

Excellent authentic tasting teriyaki sauce! I didn't have as much chicken as in the recipe but I still used the same amount of sauce, so I would definitely double the sauce when I make it again with more chicken. I only had to bake for 30 minutes and they were done. My family were very pleased with the results. :) The sauce would be great on chicken kabobs as well!

As per other reviews I only added 3/4 of the sugar stated in the recipe.  Substituted 4 chicken breasts instead of the thighs, with this amount of chicken you don't need to double the sauce as long as you cover the chicken with foil.

This was a great recipe!  The teriyaki sauce was very tasty - I did add a bit more sugar.  The chicken was tender and very flavorful.  I baked it as directed except for the first 30 minutes I covered it with foil and then took the foil off for the last 30 minutes.  Mmmmm!!

This came out awesome! I followed everything exactly except I used chicken breats instead of thighs and cut them into little slices like they do at Chinese restaurants. My boyfriend brought over some Yum Yum sauce, and it was absolutely amazing!
It's easy, it's  quick, you don't have to marinate. It's a perfect dinner recipe.

This recipe is fantastic! I've been looking for a teriyaki chicken recipe to try and this is the one! My husband loved it and my kids did too- all of them..and they're very picky eaters!

The only thing I will do differently from now on, is use boneless,skinless chicken breast...just our preferred chicken! Fantastic recipe though and I've already shared with family and friends who can't wait to try it!

My entire family loved this recipe.  To cut down on calories and salt, I used Splenda instead of sugar and lite soy sauce.  Added a heaping tablespoon of Chinese hot sauce to give it a kick.  Great keeper recipe.

I made this recipe for dinner today. It was simply delicious! I seasoned the chicken with my favorite seasonings before brushing on the sauce, covered the baking dish for the first 30 minutes, and then brushed them again, and baked them for an additional 20 minutes. I served Jasmine rice along with the chicken, and I will definitely share this recipe with my co-workers, and other family and friends.

AMAZING! Chicken is my absoulte favorite thing to cook since I love it so much, so I'm always trying different kinds of chicken dishes. I used a little less honey and soysauce, as I ran out, I maybe used a third of each of what it called for, and it still came out saucy and delicious! I left out the minced garlic and ginger, I just dashed a little garlic powder. I used red wine vinegar insteaad of cider too. PERFECT!!!

Great week night recipe and very yummy!  I can't wait to try it with chicken breast.  I added a tsp of honey and a tsp of worcestershire to the sauce.  The sauce was delish!

Very good, but I agree with the other reviewers who said to increase the sauce.  It would not be enough to do that many pieces of chicken.  Made it exactely as written except I had fresh ginger on hand.  Definitely use foil for easy clean up.  Thanks!

It was good, but I used bonless, skinless breasts and an hour was too long for baking.  I will make it again but bake it for half the time, turning after 15 minutes or so.   I served it with vegetable fried rice, which was yummy!

I didn't have any cornstarch....so...I skipped it and the water. Into a 1/4 cup measuring cup I put 1 tbsp. brown sugar, 1 tbsp. white sugar, about 1.5 tbsp. molasses, and filled the cup the rest of the way with honey. Used 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup plain vinegar, extra garlic and fresh minced ginger root. These amounts made more than enough to coat 2 leg/thigh combos. Without the cornstarch it was a little slow to thicken; I ended up adding in a little flour and heating the sauce over a slightly higher temp in order to get it going but once it did it thickened nicely. I did end up adding another tablespoon of soy while it was thickening because it was a smidge too sweet but the end result was great. I will definitely make this again. Absolutely delicious.

The sauce will taste very differently before and after it has been cooked. Before it tasted salty, vinegary and garlicy. After it is baked on the chicken it tastes much better.

I made this recipe last night. It was soooo yummy. The house smelled wonderful as it was baking. I didn't double the sauce and the amount was fine. I added an extra clove of garlic. I served with potatoes and pineapple coleslaw. Next time I am going to serve with rice. Make sure you line your baking dish with foil for ease of clean up. I will definately be making this dish again. We just loved it!!

Absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again soon. I added a can of pineapple (drained) before I baked it and it was great! I also used chicken breasts instead of thighs. I Lined the pan with foil and also covered with foil before baking. Very good and the chicken was super tender!

This chicken was soooo yummy! Really moist and juicy. I've made it twice and made some changes: low sodium soy sauce - to get the flavor but not make it too salty. I made 8 chicken breasts and baked it on 350F for 30 mins total, flipping halfway through, and it was perfect. Cooking it for 1 hour cooking I think would have made it really tough.
All in all, FANTASTIC RECIPE, VERY EASY, VERY QUICK!  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This was very good.  I did double the sauce and I used four chicken breasts instead of thighs.  I think that next time, I will try cooking the chicken separately and cutting it up.  Then I will add the sauce to the chicken and mix with rice and broccoli.  This recipe can certainly be used in many ways!

This is a fabulous recipe that is part of my regular menu rotation. As many suggested I double the sauce. I bake it in a 9x13 lined with foil because it is really messy to clean up. I usually bake it for about 30 minutes covered, then add more sauce and cook for another 15 minutes or so.

Great recipe! The sauce goes very well on wings also. I double the recipe and use 3/4 c. soy sauce and add 1/4 c. orange juice for a bit of a mandarin twist.

Very tasty recipe.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into chunks and marinated them in the sauce for 30 minutes then stir fried it and served over rice with vegetables and it came out nicely but not the best teriyaki I've ever had.  Would probably be better with fresh ginger and mirin instead of cider vinegar (possibly sesame oil also).

A very tasty teriyaki sauce. My husband, who dislikes anything teriyaki, (from a bad restaurant experience) raved about it. Doubling most of the ingredients and using 6 ckn breast halves, I cut the soy sauce down to 1/4 cup and substitued a 1/4 c. of teriyaki sauce. I also used 1/4 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I will def use this sauce for other meats as well.

This was delicious!  I made it as written except I subbed white wine vinegar for the cider vinegar as that's what was on hand.  I baked it at 425 for 50 minutes and did not baste it aside from when I flipped the chicken half way through.  It turned out very tender, juicy and flavourful - this will definitely be making a repeat appearance on our dinner table!

Very good!  I would recommend using fresh grated ginger instead, about 1 tsp.

My husband LOVES this sauce on everything. The only thing I change is leave out the vinegar and add crushed red pepper for a kick! Delicious.

Made this exactly as written and it was wonderful!  My guests loved it!!  I did double the sauce to make sure I would have enough and I saved some to put on the rice.  I did about 15 different pieces of chicken in a 9x13 dish and it definitely needed to be in the whole hour and the temp. written.  This is a keeper!!

Wonderful flavor hot and made a terrific salad when cold. I did use half brown sugar, half white. Also added about 2 tsps sesame oil.   As to the foil, I seldom use it to line pans. If you lightly grease your pan with shortening (Crisco) or butter, there's really NOT much of a clean up. Just fill the pan with water right away and let sit a little while. Cleans off easily.

This is so easy and delicious!  No need to dbl the sauce as other people suggest.  Place over white rice with broccoli & mushrooms.  This chicken is also great served the next day chold and chopped over a salad!

I have been tryin new dishes online and have been somewhat disappointed. I absolutely loved this recipe!! It was soo easy and very tasty. Good way to use up the thigh meat. I'm going to try a different chicken part next w/the same sauce! Thanks for sharing:)

Sauce tastes great but I think you have to marinate first and use boneless chicken thighs cut into pieces. Also at minimum you have to double the sauce. I would like to try steak strips and shrimp.  After marinating I'll come back and rate again.

Everyone loved it! From my picky four year old to their grandma. My six year old said "You have to make this again. "the best" from 4yr old. It was an easy recipe to make. I made it for a larger group using thighs, wings, and drumsticks. I used a spoon to add the sauce to the meat then flipped them over. At 1st I thought I would need to season the meat prior to adding the sauce as I have done with pre-packaged marinades, but it was really flavorful. I made rice and green beans as a side dish. This is the best teriyaki I've ever had and I will be making it again and again. I can't wait til summer to try it on the grill. Thanks Marian!

yummy! I did double the sauce and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I seasoned the chicken thighs with a little pepper and garlic powder. I poured the sauce over the chicken, cooked 30 min, flipped and cooked another 20 min, then took the foil off and cooked about 10 min to give it some color. Loved it!! Family Loved it! Served over brown rice. Fast and yummy!

This was pretty good.  My husband isn't a huge teriyaki fan (which he pointed out when he found out what was for dinner!), but he enjoyed this recipe too.  I am planning to reduce the portion size next time, since we had a ton of leftovers.

Very good, will probably cook again, followed the recipe practically to the letter. Changes I will make in the future though, will probably go about half and half white and brown sugar, and 10-15 less minutes in the oven, was just a touch dry for my taste.  I also used skinless breasts instead of thighs, and 2 tablespoons of flour instead of cornstarch. The flour may have been responsible for the glaze on the bottom side of the chicken becoming runny, if you still choose to substitute flour for corn starch, I would recommend 3 tablespoons.

Tastes great.  I combined the ingredients and baked it with chicken breasts in a baking dish at 350 deg. for 40 mins.  It thickened while it baked and it was awsome. Thanks.

This was fantastic.  I followed others advise and used brown sugar and low sodium soy sauce and it was perfect and my boyfriend asked that we make this regularly.  An easy dish and very good!   Also agree with others that the baking time should be cut down as it cooks faster than the recipe allots for.  Try this recipe!

My hubby requests this often and we love it at our house.  I don't make any changes to this recipe, we think it's perfect as is!  We've tried this with chicken breasts but definitely prefer the boneless skinless thighs.  They soak up the sauce much better.  We do like to double the sauce recipe to pour over rice and over the chicken after it's done.  This is a favorite at our house!!!

Good recipe. Easy to boot. Used 5 chicken breasts with the same volume of sauce. Covered and baked at 425, and then flipped, resauced and popped back in for another 15 mins at 350.

This was very good as written. However, next time I will use reduced sodium soy as this was a bit too salty for us. Overall, vert yummy...we will make again.

Nice change for a chicken recipe. Followed others suggestions and added extra ginger and added 1-2 tbs brown sugar. Also used boneless skinless chx breasts.

I just made this 2 weeks ago, and I can't even believe how excellent it was. I doubled the sauce as others suggested, and served it over amixture of brown rices with sauteed onion in it. I have never had a teriyaki that tasted so good. I passed around the recipe at work too. Just make it!

I was out of ginger, so I used this Sesame Ginger salad dressing I had because the ingredients within were similar to what was called for here. I combined that with all the rest of the ingredients this recipe called for essentially, DOUBLING the sauce and it was AMAZING!!! There were no leftovers.

This was really good. I used boneless chicken breast. Cut down the cooking time to about 40 mins and boiled for about 5 mins at the end for the carmelized loook. Great dish!

Tasty! We used whole chicken legs (both thighs and leg portions) and doubled the sauce. Instead of using the whole amount of soy sauce, we substituted half for "Mama Sita's" bbq marinade. I used another reviewer's method cooking; lined my glass baking pan with aluminum foil and poured the sauce over the chicken pieces. Covered and baked for about half an hour; uncovered and added the rest of the sauce then baked another half an hour. It might seem like alot of sauce at the end of cooking, but you'll want to slather your vegetables and rice with it! This would be great on salmon too, and maybe a bit of whiskey thrown in to kick it up a notch.

Easy and delicious for dinner.  I used brown sugar and baked at 350 for an hour.  Very tender.  Could have been slightly less salty, but when served on rice, the salt was balanced out.  Will be making this again!

Excellent!  Husband LOVED the sauce...glad I doubled it.  Tasted a little salty (maybe will use low-sodium soy sauce next time).  This is a new favorite!
Cook at 375 with foil for 25 minutes and then another 15minutes without foil.

The chicken was tender and delicious.  I doubled the sauce and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and slightly less than 1/4 cup white sugar.  Had enough sauce to use some of it on the rice.  I will make again!  Thanks

All 4 children and husband loved this recipe!  I doubled the ingredients and used 6 large chicken breasts. I covered with foil and baked at 375 for 1 hr, removing foil last 15 minutes.  Served with sticky rice and egg rolls.  Delicious!

Wow!  I don't really care for Teriyaki but this was AWESOME.  I did make a few changes.  I used 1/4 c packed brown sugar instead of the white.  I didn't have cider vinegar so I replaced it with red wine vinegar and used fresh ginger and pepper.  I went by other reviews and lined the pan.  I used 6 pcs of legs/thighs in an 8X8 and had enough sauce.  I also covered the first 30 min and uncovered 25 min.  I will make again!!

Doubled the sauce. Made with Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts. Cooked @ 400 for 40 minutes, basting every 10 minutes. Restaurant quality for sure. Made this for some guests and they raved about it and asked for the recipe.

Update: I've made this in the crockpot several times  and it turns out awesome.

Great recipe ~ so easy. I used boneless chicken breasts.that turned out very moist. The glaze on the chicken looks just wonderful on white plates. I served it with Chinese stirfry rice w/veggies, sliced on top. Spoon a little extra sauce over the top.

This dish was so easy to make :) I recomend double the sauce. When you are cooking the sauce it taste really salty , but once it's baked you really can't taste the salt. It's a very tasty chicken dish.

The recipe was exactly the "base" I was looking for.  My previous and favorite teriyaki sauces have had citrus in them.  My family thinks I took this over the top by my addition.  I did double the recipe as other cooks did, except as another cook, instead of doubling on the white sugar did half in brown sugar; as many other cooks, I recommend the "light" soy sauce 2 1/2 tbls (or if not doubling 1 1/4 tbls) cornstarch and added the zezt and hand squeezed juice of one small orange. Yum, yum, yum.

Excellent and easy recipe.  Used brown sugar instead of white sugar and chicken breasts instead of thighs.  Reduced soy sauce a bit.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes, basting and turning every 10 minutes.  Served over rice with sauce.  Delicious!

Excellent, I put it on the grill and it caramelized nicely.  The chicken by itself was delicious, but  I made sandwiches out of it, too, with wheat buns, grilled pineapple, red onions and swiss cheese.

The sauce was great except it was VERY gingery. I doubled the garlic and added red pepper. Next time I will add more red pepper and decrease the ginger slightly. Yum!

I just wasn't impressed with this recipe. I really wanted to like it ( I LOVE teriyaki), but it is missing something. Or maybe it just wasn't thick enough to really get good flavor on the chicken... I don't know, but I'm not sure that I'll make this again.

This is really good.  Many have issues with the amount of salt or sugar...here's how you fix both problems. Don't bother with only making a single serving of sauce unless it's for only one or two people. Double the sauce with the amounts specified above, and here's the kicker...add one cup of water for each batch ( 2 cups if you double it ). It will still thicken up just fine.  Don't bother with the 1 tbsp. of water...just make it a cup. It will even everything out, without making it bland...I got rave reviews.

Great taste! Everyone loved this one, will make again! Only difference is I used white and brown sugar, fresh ginger, and an extra clove of garlic. I didn't have cider vinegar so i used white vinegar and added some apple juice to it. Baked covered 30 minutes then uncovered 30 minutes! Must try!! Enjoy!!

Easy to prepare, excellent taste, terrible to clean up. (haha!)  I've made several times, sometimes with breasts and/or thighs and much prefer the thighs.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish is super easy to make.  We love it.  The sauce is rich and thick.  However, to save myself aggravation, I line my cooking sheets with foil and grease the foil.  It doesn't matter how much you grease a baking sheet, you will have to scrub ... a lot!

This was wonderful! Probably the pest teriyaki I've ever had! I did use the brown sugar instead of the white and it was wonderful! Also, I was lazy and just poured the mixture over the chicken and baked the whole thing for an hour without basting. It was wonderful! It was very tender and the flavor was just spectacular!!

Absolutely delicious!  I doubled the sauce but used 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup white sugar.  I used chicken thighs, turned the temp down to 375/400 and was sure to baste often.  This reminded me of General Tso's chicken more than anything and I plan to add chili garlic paste next time!

The sauce was wonderful!  I did take the advice of the reviews and used brown sugar instead of white.  Lined my pan with aluminum foil and was glad I did.  It made clean up so easy.  Will definitely make again.

Made this tonight and it was FANTASTIC!  Made a bit of changes. Instead of cider vinegar I used 1/2 cup sake 1/4 cup mirin  Used 3 heaped tablespoons of brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Also, I grated about a tablespoon worth of ginger and only used the juice I squeezed out of it.  I layed out the chicken on a baking dish and coated everything with the sauce. Then I covered the dish with foil and put it in a pre heated oven for 30 mins. After 30 minutes, i took out the dish, removed the foil, turned over all the pieces of chicken and poured in the remaining sauce. I baked the chicken uncovered for another half hour.  It turned out so well! Initially i thought the teriyaki sauce was WAYY to salty but it somehow turned out just right. The chicken was so moist and tender. Definitely a keeper! =)

Awesome recipe.  I used brown sugar instead of white and a little more garlic and ginger than what the recipe said and this came out perfect!! Also used low sodium soy sauce.

It was OK. I had to add brown sugar, put garlic powder on the wings to go along w/ the sauce, and I added cayenne pepper to give it a little heat. And not to mention, the sauce was THIN. ...I MIGHT make it again. ...But to each is their own. ;-)

While I enjoyed this recipe, to me, it tasted like all of the other chinese chicken sauces I have made from this site.  It did have a good flavor though.  I also cheated and pan cooked the chicken.

I give this 5 stars.  This was really good and I doubled the sauce so there would be extra to mix in with the rice that I made to go with it.  I also used chicken drumsticks and it turned out fine.

I've made this twice... the first time I didn't had fresh garlic and it still turned out fantastic.  The next time I used fresh garlic as well as fresh ginger and it was wonderful.  Fresh is usually better, but I really thought this was wonderful either way.  My kids all loved it as well.  We serve it with jasmine rice and a vegetable.  Yummm...

The teriyaki sauce is wonderful - just great! The only change I made was use fresh ginger. Like others suggested I baked the chicken in marinade. I had extra sauce left over so I'll be trying it on salmon, I suspect it'll be great.

This was an awesome chicken recipe! I added about 3tsp of corn starch as I like my sauce thick. I also lined my pan with foil as suggested by others. I marinated my chickend overnight and baked it at 425 for 50 minutes. Everything else was the same. The results were fantastic!

Okay, so this recipe has been reviewed ALOT, however, I just couldn't resist adding my own.  My husband and family loved this, so simple and lick your fingers delicious.  The only mistake I made was not making more!  I will be making this over and over again, to reduce the sugar I will substitute splenda, guilt free slice of heaven.

When we moved from Washington state to North Carolina we thought we would never have good chicken teriyaki again in our lives.  I have tried bottled sauces and none of them even come close to the little teriyaki joints that are all over the Puget Sound area.  I am quite pleased to say that this was EXACTLY what we have been missing.  Give it a try, it's a great recipe.  

*Makes a great sauce for teriyaki burgers too.  I make mine half beef, half pork, top with sauce, grilled pineapple, and swiss cheese on a Hawaiian sweet roll bun.  Yum!*

Super delicious! Used skinless, bone-in thighs. I followed the ingredients, but eye-balled everything as I usually do. I did add more garlic than called for. Also, following another suggestion, I marinated the chicken pieces in the sauce for a while in the fridge - about an hour or so (good tip!). Baked at 375 for 40 minutes. Sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, and served with basmati rice, broccoli and carrots. Yummmmyyyy!!!

DEILICOUS!!!!!!  Made as is. Instead of basting I just turned chicken while roasting in sauce every 10 mins.  My entire family was raving about the taste and how the meat just fell off the bone.  None of us, dont usually like thigh meat, but this was great made this way, I will make it like this every time. Thanks!!

Made this with steak and chicken. Didn't have the cidar vinegar so I used white vinegar. The steak was definitely more flavorful then the chicken but both came out good.

Definitely adding this to the weekly repetoire.  I made the recipe as is only with 4 bone in chicken thighs for my little family of 3.  I wish i had more chicken because everyone was asking for 2nds (including my 6 year old) and leftovers would have been nice.  Perfect amount of sauce for the 4 pieces. We drizzled it over brown rice.  When i make it again with more chicken i may double the recipe just to have more sauce.  DEFINITELY use foil on your dish for easy cleanup.  Also my thighs were on the small side and i don't think they took the full hour to cook.

Delicious!!!!! Love this recipe and highly recommend it to anyone who truly loves teriyaki. I used some of the recommended alterations and used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar. I also added more garlic and one time used roasted garlic. This recipe is a keeper and one to share with everyone!! :)

I'm pretty unimpressed with this recipe. For me, there was too much cider vinegar; it sort of overwhelmed all the other flavors. Also, the area directly around the chicken on the pan was burned black. Chicken is really moist, but I'm not enjoying the flavor.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  I would encourage you to use low sodium soy sauce and line the bottom of your baking dish with aluminum foil.  I cooked two chicken breasts, sliced about a half inch thick.  Bake in the oven at 400F for about 30 minutes.

This is a great homemade teriyaki recipe.  I double the sauce a cook it the day before.  Then I take half the sauce a marinade the chicken in it and then cook it on the grill.  I basted the ckicken with the leftover half of the sauce and serve whats left as dipping.  Really good.  This time I am trying with half brown sugar as some reviewers have recommended.

This was delicious! The only change I made was to replace the white sugar with 1/3 c. Splenda and reduce the heat to 400. Wonderful!!

I made this according to the recipe, using Tamari (no MSG added) and the sauce was very good.  I used boneless, skinless thighs and baked for 45 minutes, turning after 30.  My husband loved it.

tasted amazing.  just a head's up that my sauce didn't thicken as much as the picture looks so i would add some extra corn starch if you like a thick glaze.

This sauce is really good!  I actually added about 1/4 of brown sugar and gave it a little more sweetness, but instead of basting the chicken, I had some ckn. thighs (about 12-15) I needed to use up, so I cubed them, browned them in a skillet, added about 3/4 to 1 cup of frozen veggies and then added the sauce to the ckn and veggies.  We then spooned it over rice. Yummy!

Yummy.  Very, very salty - but we all went back for seconds anyway.  While I'll use a lower-sodium soy next time I make this, the high salt content didn't seem to deter anyone from eating every bite of this.  I doubled the sauce and reduced the sugar a bit, using 2/3 of a cup instead of a full cup.  1/3cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar.  Used 8 chicken thighs, that I de-boned and removed the skin from before cooking.  I covered my chicken with foil for 30 minutes while cooking, then baked uncovered for another 15 minutes.  Served on top of Fried Rice and Soy-glazed mushrooms.  Delicious, take-out quality meal.

I was really excited about this....but I think this would make a better marinade for grilling chicken breasts. I found my chicken just tasted like boring ole chicken in the center, no flavor whatsoever once you got past the outside.

Excellent!  I didn't change a thing.  I love sweet sauces and this one hit the mark.  The glaze clung to the chicken just as it should and the chicken was tender and just fell apart (which is the benefit of thighs over breasts, obviously).

Doubled the sauce as others had suggested; my 2 picky daughters asked me to make it again 4 days later!  Have tried it with beef, but we prefer the chicken.  Added chunked roma tomatoes, red pepper strips and sliced mushrooms  to make it a complete (read lazy) one dish meal! Friends have used the recipe and have all rated it an excellent also.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Teriyaki sauce is a simple sauce; a balancing act of salty (soy sauce), sweet (sugar), sour (vinegar) and consistency (cornstarch), and the key to this recipe is to find own balance. With a little trial and error you will be a funambulist (not sure if that's a word...) in no time. I doubled the sauce but with two tsp of ginger, 1 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup cider and 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar, and used low-sodium soy sauce. cooked half the time for each side since I was making breasts (breasts cook faster than thighs). Thank you Marian for the wonderful recipe.

This stuff is AWESOME!  Great on baked chicken.  I like to add a little more cornstarch to make the sauce thicker, but that's it.    As for the chicken, I've added the sauce two different ways.  The first time I simply poured all the sauce on top.  It came out great.  The second time I followed the directions here and turned the chicken over multiple times, hitting it with the brush.  My conclusion?  It actually came out better pouring the sauce on top of the chicken.  The sauce seems to permeate the entire breast/thigh this way.  I didn't get as good of a taste turning it over constantly and brushing it, and it took much less effort.    Note:  I still turned the chicken over at regular intervals.  After experimentation, I'm thinking I may try dipping the entire breast or thigh in the sauce and then baking it, maybe dipping it in the sauce once more in the middle and putting a little bit of sauce on the bottom of the pan.  When I baked it IN the sauce, it had a nice brown color on top where the sauce caramelized a bit (Due to the sugar I guess).  Dipping the whole breast or thigh in the sauce will probably have this result on the entire piece, resulting in a very nice looking and great tasting piece of chicken.

Absolutely Delicious! I used 5 boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them in half and doubled the recipe.  Poured half the sauce on at the beginning and the other half 10 minutes before they were done.  Had plenty of sauce.

This chicken is so good.  The sauce has an excellent flavor that my entire family enjoyed.  I made it just like it is written except I double the sauce so I would have plenty for basting.  My only suggestion and what I plan to do next time is marinate the chicken in the sauce overnight in a ziploc back so the flavor is picked up through out the chicken.

The flavor was excellent.  I did not enjoy the thighs.  Probably use breasts next time.  Remember to grease the pan!  The sugar baked onto mine and took a day to remove.

I really liked this recipe. The only modification I did to it was added some Chili sauce to the sauce to make it spicy. Also, instead of baking it in the oven, I used a stove top grill and it came out great!

I tried this recipe out on some friends and it was a hit!  They enjoyed it so much that they asked for the recipe and cooked it for their dinner guests the next week.  I served this with Broccoli w/ Garlic Cashew Butter.  A recipe I also got from this site.  Next time I will double the sauce recipe, I always add more garlic, and sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on top.   I wouldn't change anything else.  Quick, simple, and delish!

I really liked the recipe and i also turned it into a freezer meal. i mixed all the ingredients in a large ziplock bag and then added the chicken. I removed all the air in the bag and put it in the freezer. on the day i wanted to cook it, i just  thawed it completely and added a little extra (3T or so because you loose some moisture when you freeze) liquid and baked it as directed in the sauce. it was great. Thank you for submitting this recipe :)

Made this the other night and it was great!!!! Just like the teriyaki down the street.  I used low sodium soy sauce and I know what is going in it, so not all the gunk you find in the bottled stuff.  Excellent....not too sweet, just right!!

I made these for my daughter's school pot luck day.  I decided to make chicken wings out of the recipe and used my crock pot to bake them.  Here is what I did: 1. First I doubled the sauce recipe and used a 3-lb bag of frozen chicken wings. 2.In crock pot combine all ingredients except chicken wings and stir to combine.   Add in frozen chicken wings. Cook in crock pot on low for 6-8 hours 3.Turn oven to low Broil. 4.Line cookie sheet with foil and coat with non-stick cooking spray. Take chicken wings out of crock pot and lay them on the cookie sheet 5.Put the cookie sheet in the oven under the boiler for 5 minutes.   Take the cookie sheet out and turn the wings over and return to oven and broil another 5 minutes. (I sometimes take cookies sheet out again, turn wings over and broil another 3 minutes on the first side.) Take wings out of the oven. 5.While the wings are cooking, pour the remaining sauce from the crock pot into a saucepan, over low heat, add additional cornstarch and use a whisk to stir the sauce until it is a nice thick consistency. 6.At this point you can either just put the wings on a serving plate and brush on some of the thickened sauce and serve and put the wings back in the crock pot and brush on the thickened sauce and put the crockpot on warm.

Excellent flavor. May add more garlic next time to suit our personal taste but it was great as written.

This was a great dish, very tasty and tender. As some of the other reviewers said, I lined a cake tin with aluminium foil and just put all the sauce over the chicken and cooked it covered in the oven on 205C for 35 mins.  I also used reduced salt soy sauce and did not have any ginger on hand. The sauce is so good, next time I will serve over rice. Very good recipe, thanks!

This was just ok.  I doubled the sauce as suggested, used a little fresh ginger along with ground but otherwise followed the recipe.  With so many reviews of 5 stars, I expected it to be excellent.  Was quite disappointed.  It was bland and sweet, and simply missing something.

For me the Cider vinegar killed this, it was way too strong. I decided to try this because it is similar to a a recipe my husband and I use all the time that is equal parts water, soy sauce, brown sugar with minced garlic and ginger. Also I cooked this for half the time because I used a thermometer. The only thing I am going to take from this recipe is the step in using corn starch to thicken the sauce.

Wonderful dish....I used skinless, boneless thighs.  Also I took half the marinade/sauce and after it cooled I poured it over the chicken and put it in the fridge over night.  The next day I popped it in the oven and brushed the marinade/sauce as written.  Leftovers freeze very nicely.  This is now a regular at my house!

This was fantastic. My husband thinks I am the greatest cook in the world due to the fantastic recipes  I find here. This recipe only added to my reputation. I doubled the sauce, but I didn't think it was necessary in the end. I did it just becasue so many others did. When making it again, I think I will stick to the recipe as is because it was fabulous.

I double the sauce as recommended by other. My whole family loved it! Even my Very picky 4 year old had seconds. I served it with Jasmin rice. I will be making this a stable at my house.

I didn't read the other comments and baked at 400 for 25 minutes until I was concerned that it may be overcooking. I took it out and it was just slightly past done. I'm pretty new to cooking so I wouldn't begin to suggest a proper cooking time, but for me at least, the cooking time indicated was not correct.  Otherwise, a very tasty dish

These have the best flavor and are really easy to make.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and they turned out very good.

This was wonderful! As other's suggested, I doubled the sauce. I used white vinegar vs cider, because it was on hand. I substituted Splenda for the sugar. I used 6 chicken breasts & placed them in a wide sheet of tin foil, poured on sauce, wrapped it up, placed on a cookie sheet & cooked for 25 minutes. I then opened the foil & cooked another 15 minutes, and did not baste. The meat was tender & everyone loved it. I will definately make again! As another suggested, this sauce would be great with beef.

The sauce wasn't bad but had a bit too much soy. I used chicken breasts and they cooked faster than the recipe said. I might try again and make some changes.

This recipe is great. I poured half the sauce on the chicken breast for the first 30 min. then fliped them and poured the rest of the sauce on for the last 10 min. of cooking. My chicken breast were moist and had a very good taste. Be sure to put tin foil in the bottom of the pan as stated in other reviews as it does burn on to the sides. I also did not have an ginger and subed clove garlic with garlic salt and it was very good.

This recipe is awesome!!! I just do one thing different that makes the chicken so much more delicious and easy. Instead of precooking the sauce, I pour the uncooked sauce in the pan and put the chicken in. The sauce bubbles up and creates a thick coating on the chicken. I turn it once during baking and put some broccoli in at that time. I cook up some rice and make an awesome rice bowl with broccoli and chicken!!! Yum!

I made this for the 2nd time tonight.  I used chicken breast because they were on sale this week. :)  It was delicious. I cooked them 20 minutes on each side.  We sliced it up and served it over rice and had broccoli on the side.   Yummy!

Edit >>>  I am a huge fan of this recipe and I make it often but I have to add some detail - I usually make this with half tamari and half soy and it is 5 stars this way.  I made it recently with all soy (low sodium) and found it to be a bit too salty.  If I am out of tamari again, I will reduce the soy for sure.  >>> Original review: 5 stars: This is my first ever review, but I had to comment on this recipe.  My daughter absolutely adored this chicken.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and cut them horizontally into about 3 pieces, removing any visible fat.  Placed in a shallow baking pan and covered with sauce.  Baked at 375 for about 30 minutes, turning once after 15 minutes.  I had about 9-10 thighs and did not double the sauce; there was plenty.  After the chicken was done, I drained off most of the sauce and thickened it on the stove with 1 T cornstarch to serve on the side.  This recipe is similar to chicken teriyaki we get at our local mall, but much much better.  I used half regular soy and half tamari and it was perfect.  Served with vegetable fried rice that had lots of good veggies and extra water chestnuts for crunch, and I think this may be my daughter's new favorite meal.  Thanks so much for posting this - I will be making it often.  So easy and sooooo good.

Wow! This recipe is DELICIOUS! I just made it for supper and couldn't get enough.   Before cooking, I cut 3 chicken breasts into strips which cut the cooking time down by about 15 mins. I only cooked it at 375. I made the amount of sauce showed in the recipe and had way more than enough. I paired this with some fried rice. Great recipe!

The only ingredient I omitted was ginger (didn't have any) and I cooked 5 thighs.  The amount of sauce was perfect for my amount of chicken.  I'd double if you had any more.  I sauced the chicken and cooked covered in foil for 30 minutes.  I removed foil and set timer for 10 minutes and basted.  10 min; basted. 10 min; basted.  I turned the broiler on for about 4 minutes as I like crispier skin. The chicken was perfect.  Seriously. P-E-R-F-E-C-T. :)

Excellent! I used chicken breasts and brown sugar (cooked covered for 35 minutes on 400, uncovered for 5 more minutes). The chicken was super tender and the sauce had great flavor! Thanks for sharing.

Awesome sauce! Just the right thickness and flavor...next time I'll use low sodium soy sauce...kids said it was a bit too salty..but they ate it ALL! Chicken was very tender. Loved using the boneless skinless thighs. I covered mine. Be careful not to overcook as ovens vary. Thanks Marian. This one will be a regular.

I tried this tonight and we LOVED it. I will defiantly make it again. I would double the sauce recipe because I didn't think there was enough to keep brushing on. Other than that this is one of my new favorites.

SO good!  I doubled the glaze, used rice vinegar, cut the sugar in half, and fresh ginger. Shortened the baking time by 10 minutes.  I used half thighs and half chicken breasts.  No surprise the breasts dried out a bit, but the kids loved it!  Will definitely make this again and again. Thanks so much!

I made this recipe to the "T" and WOW is it yummy. I used bone in thighs and next time I will use a boneless cut of meat. Except for wings. I can't wait to try this sauce on some wings!

This was an excellent and easy recipe - I replaced the .5 cup of sugar with 6 packets of Sweet-N-Low and the sauce tasted great and had the same consistency. That reduced the calories by 64 per piece - So 150 per serving.

This was delicious!!! My husband & I ate it all up for dinner last night! It was so easy to make! I served over white rice & threw in some pineapples & it was delish!!! Much better than store bought teriyaki marinade! The only thing I changed was that I didn't have cider vinegar so I just used white vinegar & it was just as yummy!!!

I thought this was delicious and my daughter thought it was just "okay."  I really liked the sauce a lot and will never buy teriyaki sauce again.  I made one sub and that was to use orange juice in the place of water.  I too, just poured the sauce over the chicken.

This dish was good, but not "knock your socks off" fantabulous. I think prepared teriyaki sauce in a bottle would have been just as good (and cheaper to serve).

I've made this 2 times now, and both times there have been no leftovers.   I line a casserole dish with foil, put the chicken in, then i brush the sauce on both sides of the chicken. I'll re-brush with sauce every 10-15 minutes or so, but i reserve a good chunk of sauce for after the chicken is cooked.   When the chicken is done, i chopped the breasts into bite sized pieces, then add the remaining sauce and mix it all so the chicken pieces are evenly coated.   I serve over white rice.   *I use grated fresh ginger *I use chicken breasts *I double the sauce recipe  I almost recommend making a HUGE batch of the sauce, then bottling it and keep in your fridge. It's quite tasty!!

Wow! This recipe was sooo good! I like this so much i'm thinking when i can serve it to my friends to show this dish off.  I used white vinegar and fresh ginger instead as that was all i had and it tasted just like the teriyaki chicken in restaurants.  Added a splash of hot sauce as well.  Definetly a keeper in my house!

I thought it was a good recipe but VERY salty.  i would use half the amount of soy sauce next time and maybe a little more water.  the soy sauce dominated the garlic and ginger.  could be a great recipe with a little tweaking.

Wow, this was great!  I used boneless skinless breasts rather than thighs.  Made the recipe's amount of sauce for 6 pieces.  I followed one reviewer's advice to just dump the sauce on and bake, and next time I'll baste it, as the juices thinned the sauce out.  I ended up broiling these for about 8 minutes, turning halfway thru, to thicken the sauce.  Served with rice and steamed veggies.  Will definitely make this one again.

What an awesome recipe!  It was so easy and had WONDERFUL flavor!  I made some little changes to mine. I cut the chicken in long strips, melted a little butter in the pan, then brushed the strips with browning/seasoning sauce as they browned.  I replaced the cider vinegar with balsamic vinegar. I added the remaining chicken juice, butter and browning sauce from the fry pan to the teryaki sauce and let it all thicken together before pouring over chicken to bake.  I only baked the chicken for 1/2 hour, since it was somewhat cooked already. The chicken came out moist and delicious and the sauce was perfect! We ate it over brown rice served with broccoli. My husband kept raving about it!  I can't wait to have this again!

This sauce was amazing. I used it a little differently then explained in the recipe. I cut up boneless, skinless chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and cooked them in Pam on the stovetop. While the chicken was cooking I made the sauce just as described. Once the chicken was done cooking I poured the sauce over the chicken and let it simmer for about 5 minutes. I served it over white rice. It smelled so good and my boyfriend LOVED it! He said it tasted just like something you would order at a restaurant. I will definately be making this again!

I took other reviewers' suggestions and substituted brown sugar for white sugar, and doubled the sauce.  I made thighs, because my husband and I love dark meat.  I just dumped all the sauce over the meat, and cooked it covered for 30 minutes, then flipped the pieces over and cooked it uncooked for another 20ish minutes.  Served it over rice.  The meat was SO TENDER!  YUMMM!  My husband thought the flavor was a bit odd, and I'm not sure if it was the ginger or cider vinegar or brown sugar, but I loved it!  I also just used some of the leftover sauce:  I pan-fried some onions, mushrooms, and yellow squash (I didn't have any zucchini, or I would have added that, too) and then poured the sauce over it and heated it through.  It would have been even better if I had marinated the veggies.  Served it over rice.  It was a delicious vegetarian meal!

My oh My!  I have had this recipe in my recipe box for months and I just got around to trying it for supper last night.  It was a BIG hit.  My DH loved it!  I used chicken breasts and doubled the sauce.  Cooked in a 425 degree oven covered for 20 mins and uncovered for last 20 mins.  So easy and makes a delicious meal. Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe......

I made this for myself last night (altered it down to 1 serving) with brown rice, and it was delicious and tender. The only downside was that it has just about wrecked my baking dish. I guess I just wasn't thinking and should have used a glass dish. Here comes the scouring!

I made some changes--used Kikkoman teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. I also used boneless skinless chicken breast. I pounded them until they were about 1/2 an inch thick and poked holes in them using a fork. I poured the sauce on top and baked them at 350 F for 50mins. It was quite tasty.

Great recipe!  I omitted the ginger (personal preference) and used dried minced garlic as a time saver.  If this effected the flavor, I didn't notice, it's already on next week's menu.  I made this with a macaroni salad because it was leftover, but next time I'm serving with rice because the sauce is so good.

The teriyaki sauce was fantastic.  I followed the instructions for the sauce almost to the letter except I used 3 to 1 brown sugar rather than all white sugar.  I didn't have any thighs so I used chicken breasts instead and they were very moist and juicy (400 for 35 minutes, uncovered).  Like a lot of others I just poured the sauce over the top and turned half way through the cooking time.  I think next time I'll follow the suggestion of draining the juice half-way through so that it carmelizes a little bit better.  Lastly, I added in some sliced onions just because I like them.

My husband really liked this. I made it with "restaurant fried rice" from allrecipes. I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of the thighs, but that was the only thing I changed. Very good. I think personally I would give it 4 stars but my husband gave it 5 and that's what really matters. :) ok. so I also doubled the sauce which is completely unnecessary. I had a ton of sauce left over. And personally, I think they would be better broiled or grilled rather than baked.

I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and doubled the sauce.  During baking, I covered the pan with foil.  Delicious!!! Everyone in the family loved it.  Also good for next day lunch poured over rice. It has become a family favorite standby.

Very nice sauce.  I didn't have Cider vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar and malt vinegar, and I also used brown sugar.  It was nice but next time I think I will used a bit more ginger, garlic and I want to add 2 minced green onions.  Great thickness to the sauce.

I love this recipe. I have passed it out to several people in the Pacific northwest that love Teriyaki chicken resturants that are on every corner! This is so good! And the only thing different I did was cook my boneless chicken in the oven until it was half way done and cut it up then poured the sauce over it and it finish baking!! Yummy!!

This was very good. I only gave it three stars because it wasn't as good as I anticipated. Probably because, like others, I thought it was a bit too salty. I didn't have low sodium soy sauce, but next time I will definitely use that. It was great over white rice, and I also added frozen peas to the rice as it was steaming. Turned out yummy.

Excellent!  Even my picky husband loves it and says, "That's a keeper!"  The sauce took a little longer than I expected so, I'll make up a big batch of the sauce and save it. It is so much better and cheaper than store-bought teriyaki sauce.

My husband is a diabetic so I doubled the recipe for the sauce and substituted Splenda in the yellow bag for the sugar one for one.  He LOVED it. I didn't have any chicken thighs but I had three chicken halves.  It looked marvelous!

Oh my gosh!!!  I am not a fan of teriyaki but wanted to get rid of some thighs I had in the freezer.  I couldn't stop eating this.  My husband wrinkled his nose when he heard we were having chicken teriyaki but could not stop eating it as well.  I did double the sauce, because we poured some of it on the rice.  Plus, this is KID FRIENDLY!!! I was soooo surprised my picky, PICKY 4 year old loved it, and asked for seconds. He kept saying, "Hmm...that's good."  My 2 year old ate it as well.  I love this recipe...and I had all the ingredients on hand!

With Chicken Breast!  I am not a fan of dark meat chicken, but this is fabulous with the chicken breast.  I make extra to add to stir fried broccoli, cauliflower, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and baby corn and serve over steamed rice.  It is wonderful.

I used this sauce recipe to marinate our chicken parts in overnight. The next day we grilled them up on the BBQ and have never had juicier chicken. The breasts were very tender and moist, not dry at all. Marinating overnight was key. Ours did not taste salty at all. Will certainly make this again.

So yummy!  I used a mix of breasts & thighs and lined the pan w/ foil.  425 for 40 minutes, turning once & reglazing, and leaving uncovered.  Rice & broccoli sides. Picky hubby gave it a 10! (previously only spaghetti got a 10!) and 2 yr old had seconds!  Will definitely do again!

This was truly excellent.  Very easy - I would agree with KARENKY that lining the baking dish with foil is the way to go to avoid a messy cleanup.  I added about a 1/2 cu of chicken broth and let the sauce thicken to almost a barbecue sauce consistency then just poured it on top of the thighs.  I turned them once at the 15 minute mark.  Absolutely delish.  Even my 2 year old loved it.

This is so very good! I used boneless skinless breasts / low sodium soy sauce and cooked at 400 for about 30 minutes. Served with brown rice and broccoli ( drizzled those with the sauce)

Really good and so simple...that combination always gets a 5 in my book.  My pan juices did get really liquidy as the chicken cooked but I had reserved much of the sauce and was basting every so often so I eventually just moved the chicken to a different pan and continued basting and by that point no more juice was being released from the chicken so the sauce stayed thick and stuck to the chicken.  I used low sodium soy sauce, brown sugar instead of white, and fresh ginger.  And, I used boneless, skinless thighs and cooked at 400 for about 45 min.

Very, very good. Now one of my Wife's favorites. Ordinarily, I highly disapprove of folks rating a recipe with a dozen or more of their own alterations. A recipe should stand on its own merit. In this case, I made an exception. With the cider vinegar (brown) and the soy sauce (brown), I felt it just naturally called for brown sugar. Not that it make a huge difference, but it adds a subtle richness that I prefer.

I really enjoyed this Teriyaki chicken recipe. I did make a few changes: I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and baked them in a foil lined pan + covered them with foil at 400 for 30 minutes. That was perfect - they were juicy and tender. I used about 1/10 cup of brown sugar and 1/10 cup of white sugar, reduced the soy sauce to cut back on the saltiness and I used balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar. It was excellent and very flavorful.

Delicious! The homemade teriyaki sauce is so much better than a restuarant's.  I only used three chicken thighs and halved the recipe so the sauce is not enough. I'd recommend doubling or tripling the sauce.  It's yummy :D.  This recipe could also be applied to pork, shrimp, etc.

I used only 6 bone in, skin on chicken thighs but made the full amount of sauce, retaining some of it to put on the rice.  I baked mine at 425 like the recipe says, but the chicken was done after 40 minutes so keep an eye on it!  I used normal soy sauce and the glaze seemed super salty to me but I think it was perfect on the chicken.  The chicken turned out wonderfully and the reserved sauce was amazing on the rice (though you only need half a tablespoon or so for a whole serving).  I'm going to try making this again with skinless chicken, and also try with reduced sodium soy sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!  UPDATE:  I have made this with skinless chicken and it's only half as good.  Kinda watery and nothing spectacular.  Make it with skin-on chicken!  It's the only recipe I buy skin-on chicken for.

At first I made the sauce directly from the recipe. Then after tasting I decided to play with it a little according my tastes. I think that everyone should do that because we all have our own taste preferences. I made extra sauce so I could keep adding it to the chicken every few minutes. I took longer to cook the chicken because I did this, but it had lots of flavor. I cooked snow peas, brocolli, and pineapple bits and added to rice to make it a meal.

I give this 5 stars for ease.  I want to try this again.  I doubled the sauce by only using 6 wings, but wish I didn't because I'd rather the skin be crisper.  Used less sugar, some brown sugar and more water and vinegar.

I made an account just to rate this recipe! I made the sauce for some salmon, and I used brown sugar instead of white, and slightly diluted the soy sauce with water, and the sauce turned out perfectly. It was nice and thick, and just like what you would get at a restaurant... I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe, but I did follow some other reviewers suggestions to make it a 5, otherwise it would be a 4.  Doubled the garlic, used brown sugar instead of white, and low sodium soy sauce.  This has become a staple in the recipe rotation at my house.  Served with broccoli and white or brown rice, depending on what we have.  This is a meal that everyone in my house will eat, and it's hard to please 5 people at the same time!  My 4 year old loved this, and he doesn't like anything except Mac & Cheese so it was definitely a compliment.  Thanks for a great recipe!

SUPER EASY!! This will be my Teriyaki sauce from now on.  This recipe is delicious! I took some of the advise from the reviews and doubled the sauce. I used a heaping teaspoons of corn starch which help make the sauce thicker. I used 1/4 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, also I only had regular soy sauce AND since I doubled the sauce I diluted half with tap water to make a cup and it was not salty and it was still WOW! I used what I had, (10)chicken wings and a couple of chicken breast in freeze that I threw in. I also seasoned my chicken with cayenne, pepper flakes and onion powder and poultry seasoning to my family's taste for extra flavor and kick before baking. My six year old licked the ready sauce off the spoon. I will make again and again. Ps. and yes, use Real Ginger if you can.

Awesome! What a super easy recipe. One of the best chicken recipes I've ever tasted. I doubled the garlic and next time would maybe triple it. I love garlic! I also used half white sugar and half brown to get that nice dark color. I am sure it would be even better with fresh ginger too. I baked it for 30 mins and turned it over and baked for another 25 mins and basted every 15 mins with the sauce. Had a nice carmelization and didn't dry out one bit! I didn't even have to cover the pan with foil, I just stuck it in the oven and it came out great! Served it with white jasmine rice and sauteed green beans. Wonderful..thanks for sharing!!

Very good sauce. I covered the chicken for the first 30 minutes, then turned it, basted it and cooked it for 15 minutes, repeated it again, and it was ready to serve.

Wow we loved this sauce.  I used boneless chicken thighs, cut them so they were long and weaved them on wooden skewers.  My son loved them.  I used this sauce on Salmon tonight basted and broiled both sides and finished with toasted sesame seeds. That was awesome!

This recipe was super easy and absolutely delicious. I doubled the sauce like was suggested in the reviews and am so glad that I did. Will definitely be making this again. Everyone loved it.

The teriyaki sauce is fantastic and very easy to make. With Splenda and low sodium soy sauce it's not too bad for you either. I'm going to use it for other dishes as well.

We loved this chicken!  The sauce is divine.  I followed the directions for the most part but I used boneless, skinless breast and did double the sauce and used it all during basting.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Everyone loved it.  I made it with three chicken breasts since they are bigger than thighs and people suggested doubling the sauce.  I could have easily made four to five breasts with the amount of sauce the recipe generates.

This was a very good recipe for teriyaki sauce.  The amount of sauce in the recipe is actually good for 6 pieces of chicken and extra sauce to use for rice, potatoes etc, so since the recipe calls for 12 pieces, you may want to double the sauce.  I only gave this a 4 because I didn't cook it exactly as directed.  Make sure that you mix the cornstarch with the cold water first before adding it to the saucepan with the rest of the ingredients to ensure that it dissolves nicely. I placed the 6 skinless chicken thighs in the baking dish and poured the sauce over all of it basically smothering the chicken.  I cooked the chicken at 400 degrees, covered w/foil for 30 minutes.  At 30 minutes turned the heat off and let the chicken sit in the oven an additional 5 minutes before removing and placing on the stove to cool. Chicken came out very juicy and tender. Make sure to tranfer the chicken and sauce to a servish dish or other dish so you can clean the baking dish right away.  The sauce will not stick if soaked asap.

I followed the ingredients for the sauce as written but used boneless skinless thighs. Instead of baking, I cooked it in a pan because I didn't have time to bake it. It was so good. Will definately make it again.

This recipe was excellent.  I used chicken breasts instead for a healthier version.  I doubled the amount of garlic and ginger because my husband and I love a lot of those flavors.  I actually just poured all of the marinade over the chicken and baked while turning the chicken over once halfway through instead of brushing every ten minutes.  This was delicious.  The breasts had a candied coat on the surface and were juicy on the inside.  These were in the oven for fifty minutes instead of the full hour.

This is very tasty!  And it's coming from a hopa (half-japanese)!  I used white wine vinegar once and once with rice vinegar - both with equally good results.  The sauce is a perfect consistency - just like most japanese restaurants and the taste is better than most japanese style restaurants.

I only followed this recipe's instructions as far as the teriyaki glaze, since I used boneless chicken breasts and cooked the chicken on a pan lined with aluminum foil for only 25 minutes.  The glaze is great!  Great tangy flavor, very easy to bring together; perhaps I will use a little less sugar next time, since it did seem a little overly sweet for me.  I used low sodium soy sauce, just because that's what I prefer.  This also makes a LOT of glaze -- since I typically never make more than four chicken breasts at a time, I'll probably halve the recipe next time.  Overall very good!

Excellent recipe.  Has a very intense flavor and is quick and easy to prepare. I used chicken tenders instead of thighs and it cooked in about 30 minutes.

Chicken comes out very tender and flavorful.  A little on the salty side and it takes a super  long time to get the teriyaki sauce to thicken when cooked on low.

AMAZING!  I didn't mess with brushing the sauce onto the chicken.  I simply added all of the sauce into the baking pan and basted the chicken every 5-10 minutes.  Such a great flavor!  I served it with oriental rice and green beans tossed in soy sauce.

Super flavor!!  I used wings and legs this time, but I will definately try chicken breast next time.  I cranked the oven down to 375 for the entire cooking time and covered with foil as others suggested.  I thought about doubling the sauce, but I didn't. I did reapply some of the juices in my pan and it worked out just fine.  Very good loved it!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic. This sauce is simple to throw together and the chicken was delicious.  I made the sauce last night and used it on salmon.  It was probably the best salmon I've ever made.  The salmon only took about 15 minutes to cook too.

Terrific!  I used bone in thighs and added red peppers and onion like another reviewer mentioned, very tasty and moist!  I had to use brown sugar (all I had) and still great.  This would be excellent to toss chicken wings in after they are cooked and then throw them back on the oven for another 15 minutes to soak up!!

The flavor of the sauce is great, but I thought it lacking. I made the addition of cooking sliced yellow and red peppers, and pineapple chunks with the chicken. When it came time to turn the chicken I added as many pineapple rings as there were chicken pieces. When it was all done, I plated it over a bed of wild rice and the baked pineapple on the top. Our dinner guests for the evening were impressed by the presentation and wowed by the taste. Can't wait to make this again!

I decided to try something new for my "Chicken Fried Rice" recipe. I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the thighs. I used brown sugar instead of white, and I baked them in a 8x8" pan. Had I not been cutting this chicken into chunks and mixing it in my fried rice, I would have had to give this recipe 3 stars. The chicken was very tough, I'm not sure if it was the sauce or something else. I followed the instructions exactly, so I don't know what happened. The flavors in the sauce were great, and it was very easy to make. I will make this again, but only for my fried rice.

Wow this recipe is amazing. So far I have found 4 deliciously incredible recipes that I will make again and again and this is one of them. I doubled the sauce and only cooked the chicken for 45 minutes..it falls off the bone! I would NOT recommend cooking it for more then 45 minutes on 425 oven. I had an expensive temperature thermometer in the chicken and it reached 165 in 25-30 minutes but I left it in extra because I wasn't sure..but it was definitely cooked in 30 minutes..I really feel like this is a restaurant quality recipe that you can impress your friends/co workers or just your family with. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

This chicken is awesome! I make it about twice a month, everyone loves it, especially the kids. I don't baste it at all, just cover and bake for 45-60 minutes. Comes out perfect every time. Serve with rice and salad, it's the perfect chicken dinner.

This was delicious, my husband loved it.  I didn't have apple cider vinegar, so I had to use balsamic vinegar and instead of sugar, I used splenda, even with those changes, it was still the best sauce, I have made.

The best chicken teriyaki we've ever made or even tasted!  As good or better than take out.

This was a really great recipe.  The only thing I would recommend is to line the pan with foil and spray the foil.  It was a little difficult cleaning the pan after it cooked.  But other than that...it was great!

Just what I was looking for and love to see the variations.  I added green onion.  I'm going to use this as a marinade for 24 hrs., then reduce it to use as a sauce after I BBQ the chicken or flank steak.

Very, very good teriyaki sauce.  You can use this on anything.  As written it is delicious - you can always adjust to your taste...I like bit more ginger and garlic and sometimes I add a Tablespoon of seseme oil for a change.  No need to by bottled sauce once you try this recipe!

Wow.  What great chicken.  My entire family loved it, including my picky eaters (ages 6 & 9).  I used skinless, boneless breasts and cooked it at 375 for about 45 minutes (which was too long).  I used the lower temperature because I was also cooking rice and it required that temperature.  We loved the sauce over the rice too.

Easy to make and my family loved it (all of them)! Definitely good to double the sauce to go over rice - next time I will serve with broccoli and I'm going to try using fresh ginger (although the powered was fine). I am also going to put down foil because it is sticky to clean up! This will be great on the grill too.

I was a little skeptical but seeing all the reviews I thought I would try it. OMG, this is soooo good. I could sip on the sauce, it's that good. I added some red pepper flakes and I also used chicken breasts. I like it crispy so I baked at 425 and then used the broiler for the final carmalizing. Total cooking time was about 25 mins. I used the rest of the sauce for the brown rice and broccoli that I served it with. I will be using this sauce for more than chicken! Thanks for posting.

Darn good. I don't make any changes. I don't use a pastry brush, 'cause I don't have one - I just put a spoonful on each thigh at the beginning and a 1/2 spoonful at each rotation. This has made it into the meals-we-eat-often rotation. I put it over top of the Napa Cabbage Salad. GOOD!

I followed the recipe , but I think I put too much water in the sauce. So the chicken really get that thick sauce taste. But it was still good to me, the kids and husband thought it was a little plain.

LOVED IT!! What can I say...the whole family loved it.  Even my most pickiest eater had seconds, actually thirds(3yrs..so u may know how that goes!). I did not have enough soy suace to double. So after reading a few reviews I made a few adjustments that worked out GREAT thanks to other members (had enough to spread over rice): 
-mixed 1 1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch in 1/3 cup cold water
-lite soy sauce soy sauce
-3 tablespoons of rice vinegar
-1/4 teaspoon of ginger
I used skinless breast strips covered with foil first 30 min, uncovered for 15. Yummy. Tasty and tender! Enjoy!

I thought this was just ok. I like my teriyaki a bit sweeter- this just tasted like fancy soy sauce. I didn't try making it with more sugar because I don't know what the extra sugar will do to the consistency, so I'll keep looking.

hi everyone! just wanted to say there is no need in doubling the sauce. the primary ingredients in this recipe are the sugar, soy sauce and vinegar. very powerfull stuff!! so i did things differently. first off, instead of 1 tablespoon water i disolved 1 1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch in 1/3 cup cold water. i used regular soy sauce, light brown sugar (white would have worked fine) and 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar. i have been told that cider vinager is stronger than rice vinegar so i definetly think it would be smart to use less. i used 1/4 teaspoon of ginger and this worked great for me. very strong sauce even adding all that water!! i think it all depends on what your using it for, i wanted to use the sauce but if its just a glaze it would probably work fine just as it is written. good luck! dont be intimidated by the recipe you can play around with it! thats why i give it a 5. if you use it exactly as written, just brushing the chicken it will come out fine following the recipe :)

This is definitely a keeper!  My husband is Asian and makes his version all the time.  I generally think his has too much soy sauce or something, but this was just pleasantly right.  I did not change a thing from the original recipe.

I had 10 pieces and skinned half of them (hubby likes skin), put them in a corning ware dish for 1/2 an hour (too much liquid in the dish) and then transferred them to a cookie sheet with foil for the remaining 1/2 hour.  

Turned out perfect!  The chicken pieces with skin were somewhat burned(skin only), but the skinless ones were not burned at all.

Even dear hubby thought these were very good!

Top notch teriyaki! Followed recipe for sauce almost exactly except used lots more garlic =) Turned mine into more of a "baked stir~fry" Marinated chunks of chicken breast in the sauce for a couple hours then dumped into a foil lined baking dish. Added Sliced green pepper, sliced white onion, pineapple chunks, water chestnuts and 1/2 of a second batch of sauce (saved remainder for steamed broccoli and rice) Baked at 375 for about 40 min ~ stiring up once or twice and broiled for anout 5 min. This ones going in the box!!

I have been searching quite a while for the right teriyaki sauce & I have to say I found it. YOU MUST double the recipe & its a good thing I automatically did just that my first try out... none was left even after a double recipe! Okay I tweaked it slightly I used the first half cup of white sugar but on the second half for the double I used brown. That came out great. Now believe it or not I ran out of ginger and had to use my pumpkin spice for a substitute but I tell ya you hardly tasted the cinnamon. So even that way it was so good. ( I didnt use much pepper as it calls for but thats my personal choice I used 1/4 for the total didnt double up) You really have to try this one it will save you money and headaches searching. Also I used chicken breasts with about 5 cuts across on top to allow the sauce to fall in between. Serve with broccoli and white rice mmmm so so good!

This is so good and SO much better than bottled Teriyaki Sauce. I accidentally doubled the cornstarch and water and I think I'll do that again because the sauce was a really great consistancy. Next time, I'll try it with halved breasts to cut some of the fat.

SO easy and delicious!  Used boneless thighs.  Doubled sauce.  A family hit served with rice.

I wanted to make a teriyaki stir fry and thought I'd use this sauce.  Perhaps it was the brand of vinegar I used...but it was way too strong!  I had to dilute it with some extra sugar (I used brown) and some more water.  It ended up pretty good, but I think next time I will not use as much vinegar!

I believe the flavor of this depends on the use of good soy sauce. Choose LITE (less sodium), and avoid one with caramel color, which has a very inauthentic/odd taste. I made several batches of sauce, varying the ingredients each time. The recipe made exactly as directed was very sweet and *extremely* spicy-- was it the pepper or the ginger? I finally settled on the combo of LITE soy, FRESH grated ginger (world of difference!!), rice vinegar (cider v. wasn't awful, but rice was better), and half the sugar for the most pleasant taste and aroma. Added a bit of red pepper flakes for zip. Thighs had the best taste and texture, tenders were next, and boneless breasts came in last. Glad I used foil, 425 baking temp. WAS perfect, but next time, I will dry chicken very well, and baste as directed instead of dumping all the sauce on (too soupy).

This is delicious!  Only problem is the sauce did not stay on the chicken.  I just spooned it over my chicken and rice after it was cooked.  I might try this as a marinade.

I have made this a couple of times, the first time I followed the recipe & thought it was just ok.  The second time I made some changes & thought it was really good.  I used brown sugar instead of white & rice vinegar instead of apple cider.  Instead of thighs, I used a rotisserie chicken that I cut up into bite-size pieces.  I coated the chicken with just enough sauce (don't use too much!)  & baked it at 425 for 20 minutes, until it caramelized a bit.  It turned out so good.  I sauteed some veggies & combined them with the chicken & served it over rice.  My husband doesn't normally like teriyaki sauce, but he really liked this. This would be a great way to use leftover chicken.

I've never given 5 stars to a recipe on this site, but this one deserves it.  My picky husband said "this is as good as any teriyaki at a restaurant".  I only had two chicken breasts, and put them in the crockpot for 3 hours on high.  Delicious!!!

It's very fast and easy to make, but you might want to double it for the extra sauce. I served this with oven baked boneless chicken thighs with a trio blend of peppers and onions, over jasmine rice. So so good, the kids sure ate it up!

Like other reviewers, I doubled the sauce and still wished there was more!  I used chicken tenders and lined the pan with foil and cleanup was so easy. This was a very simple and easy recipe that uses stuff I already had laying around the house.

This recipe was so easy.  A lot of people changed things, I didn't change the ingredients with the exception of using low sodium soy sauce since I'm pregnant.  My husband commented on how much he loved that it was not a real salty sauce so I will probably always use low sodium.  It was delicious and one of the best teriyaki sauces we have ever tasted!  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs because that's what we prefer and it turned out great.  I also tenderized them down to about 1/2 inch and cut them in half if they were large so they would cook faster.  The chicken really did cook  in 30 min which was great and I also put the heat to 400 degrees instead of 425.    I used foil to cover the pan (9X13 glass, only thing big enough!) instead of greasing it but it did not keep my pan from getting the sticky teriyaki sauce baked on but that's totally ok.  This will definitely be made again in our family!

I usually do not review any recipes, just read other people's reviews, but I just HAD to on this recipe!!  This was the best recipe I have ever made and was the best teriyaki chicken I have ever had!!  I followed other reviews and adjusted this way:  Changed the white sugar to 1/4 c., and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I used boneless chicken breasts, and while I was cooking sauce added meat to saucepan, so it was soaking up all that marinade.  I cooked in oven about 375-400 degrees, and covered with foil for 20-25 min., and then uncovered for 15 minutes.  I am a single parent of 2 children and both my kids devoured it!!  We absolutely will make this time and time again!!!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

I have made this OVER AND OVER again and it gets the most raving reviews of anything I make.  I even tried to make it from memory early on and was off on measurements---but I could not ruin it!  This is the best recipe, hands down.

This chicken was so good! I followed the recipe exactly except I used boneless chicken breasts and baked the chicken on 350 for 15 minutes covered then added the rest of the sauce and cooked it 20 minutes uncovered. It was wonderful!

Waaay too salty, overpowered any other flavor.  I followed recipe to a T. If I decide to make this again, I'd make sure to cut back on the soy sauce.

I had to give it 4 stars because I did have to alter it. But all in all this is a great marinade. I have baked my chicken and also BBQ with it. Basically I triple the recipe and use 1/2 cup less soy sauce. 

I make up the sauce pour 1/3 to 1/2 in a dish to baste the chicken (depending on the ammount of chicken) and use the rest over rice and veggies. What a great meal.

Good.  A little on the salty side as written.  I took others advice and halved the sugar with brown sugar.  Really glad I lined the pan with foil, thanks for that advice!!!  I will try it again, cutting the sodium a bit.

This was really good although I did things a little differently.  First of all, I don't like my teriyaki so sweet so next time I might use a little less sugar.  Second of all, I wanted more of a stir fry so I cooked the chicken first, cut it up in to pieces and then made the sauce as directed.  I put the pieces of chicken, some mushrooms, a bag of stir fry vegetables (thawed), and some cooked brown rice in the pan and simmered covered for 10 minutes. It was a hit!

OH MY GOSH.  I followed this recipe to a T, and it came out SO GOOD!!!!!!!!  (Wait... I used Low sodium Soy, and 6 thighs instead of 12.)  Ok, first, I don't really like chicken thighs, but it's all I had.  I nuked some frozen broccoli and tossed it in the leftover juices.  WOW.  It's so good.  I really recommend this recipe to anyone.  I hate too many ingredients and using too many dishes and this one was so easy.  I put foil in the bottom of the dish and cleanup was a snap.  Don't get discouraged if the chicken and glaze looks to watery.  By the 45-60 mins, it starts glazing up.  SO GOOD!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Based on all the positive responses, although nearly all had been tweaked from the posted recipe, I thought it worth trying. Unfortunately, I found this recipe, prepared as stated, resulted in extremely overdone chicken swimming in a pan of watery sauce. I won't be making this again.

My husband and I loved this chicken! I only did 1/3 of the amounts mentioned (so I also only used 2 thighs and 2 legs), but I did have to double the sauce.

Awesome!!  I doubled the sauce, used half Splenda sugar and half brown sugar. I used boneless chicken thighs that were baked at 350 for 30 min , then 30 min at 450.  It was great served over white rice...

Awesome!  Tastes just like restaurant's teriyaki chicken.  I even used red wine vinegar instead of the cider as a mistake, still tasted super.

Really good! I subbed balsamic for the cider vinegar and grown sugar for the white. Doubled the sauce as other reviewers said. Didn't need that - boiled the chicken. Will make again. Thanks!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts because that is what I had and we thought this was very good on top of a bed of jasmine rice.  I will make this again...easy and good!

What a great, easy recipe! I took other reviewers' advice and used lite soy sauce and a bit more sugar than called for, and the sauce was still a bit salty for my taste. Next time I make this, i'll definitely cut the amount of Soy sauce I use. Other than that, great recipe! Even my extra picky fiancee liked it!

Pretty good. A little too salty. Next time will use low sodium soy sauce. Used boneless skinless chicken breasts and just poured all the sauce over it. Lined pan with foil for easier clean up as others suggested. Made double the sauce & served over rice.Liked the Caramelized Baked Chicken on this site better.

I used extra firm Tofu cut into slices instead of Chicken and it's great.
This is what i tweaked:
Added double the garlic, 1 tsp. chili paste and seasoned rice wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. I used 1/4 c. of sugar in the raw instead of 1/2 c. of white sugar.

I made this tonight for dinner. Used chicken breasts and cooked at 350 for 35 minutes. It was very moist but no one really seemes to care for it as it had a very strong flavor. I thought it was just ok and was a little dissapointed as it seemed that most everyone tat rated it, really liked it. Not sure that I would make it again.

This chicken recipe is awesome!  The entire family loved it - even my picky son, the "non-meat eater" in our family.  I followed previous reviews and covered the dish during the first half-hour of cooking,and it was perfect - the chicken nice and moist, but he last half-hour uncovered gave the sauce time to carmelized and thicken.  

The amount of sacue is perfect for one package of boneless thighs, but make sure to baste the chicken every 15 minutes, if not more.  It really helps.

This is pretty good. I followed the directions exactly except that I lined my baking dish with tin foil and covered the dish for the first 30 min. The sauce was quite thin to enjoy it spooned over rice as a side dish but the following day it had thickened up. Made great left-overs.

Made this for my boyfriend and I tonight.. was fabulous. Been trying to find a good teriyaki sauce to make at home.. and this was great! Will definately make this again and it takes all the igredients that are normally in my kitchen. Thank you so much! BTW: I only had close to 1/3 cup soy sauce and it still turned out faboulous.

Awesome chicken. This was the best teriyaki chicken I've made from this site. Hubby and kids loved it.  Definately a keeper. The only thing I did different was I covered with aluminum foil for first 30 minutes and removed the foil for another 10 minutes of cooking.

This was really good!  I used bone-in leg quarters and cooked it in my hot air grill.  I used Splenda brown sugar blend inplace of the white sugar, but otherwise didn't make any other changes.  I'll make this again for certain!

Very easy and sooo delicious.  I marinated chicken tenderloins in the sauce, then baked but at 375 degrees and for only 20 mins. so as not to dry them out.  Served over rice w/ extra sauce.  This would work well w/ larger boneless breasts or bone-in pieces in a crock pot, too, I think.  I may have to try that.  Might be good w/ pineapple chunks.  Love the sauce!  Great meal!  UPDATE:  Made double batch of this amazing sauce...before cooking/thickening, I marinated 8 boneless pork loin chops for 4 hours in 1/2 the sauce, then grilled them.  Simmered/thickened remaining sauce on stovetop in small pot.  Served sauce over grilled chops...amazing!!

Wow, this was awesome!  The only change I made was to sub chicken breasts for the thighs.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and rubbed down my baking dish with sesame oil.  Can't wait to make this again.

I thought the flavor of this chicken was really tasty. I took some suggestions from other reviewers by greasing the pan with sesame oil, doubling the sauce, using half white and half brown sugar and adding 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the doubled sauce. I also covered the baking pan for the first 30 minutes of cooking. Yes, the pan was a mess and took some scrubbing, but I avoid having aluminum leach into the food I serve my kids whenever possible - as it is a known neurotoxin. The chicken thighs came out juicy and delicious - and I reserved some of the sauce to drizzle over the rice I made with it. Will definitely be making this again.

Excellent Recipe - love it :) - I don't have to use the ready-made teriyaki sauce anymore.  

Only change I made was - I "grease" the dish with 2 tbsp of sesame oil (gives a special taste to the chicken).  Hope this helps :)

I've made this recipe multiple times and everyone in my family loves it! I use boneless skinless chicken breasts. It is delicious even if you don't baste your chicken every ten minutes, but I think it is so much better and has more flavor if you do. I also pound my chicken with a meat mallet to make it more tender and absorb more sauce. I also think lining your pan with foil is smart, because if you don't it makes a sticky mess.

This was good, I doubled the sauce and marinated the chicken for 24 hours. I also added some pineapple chunks before baking. This added great flavor, but thinned out the sauce a bit, so I reduced the sauce after the chicken was cooked. Definitely worth it for the amount of ingredients involved, thanks!

Not a fan.  The vinegar was awkward tasting and the sugar made it too sweet.  I may try to doctor it up with mirin and brown sugar instead, but we ended up throwing this meal out.

This recipe has potential, it was way too salty, will try again with low sodium soy and will try it on the grill instead of baked.

Yum, Yum, Yum!!!  I too lined the bottom of my pan with foil and covered it as well during the baking.  I just poured all the teriyaki sauce over the chicken, not big on basting! Loved the flavor and the moistness!  Will definetly make again!

YUM. This recipe tasted similar to a recipe that my mother used to make.  I don't have her recipe, but I know her recipe uses honey. Well, I'm on the Atkins diet and only had to substitute the sugar for Splenda, and voila, GREAT low carb recipe. The flavor is great. I would advise those with high blood pressure to use low sodium soy sauce. I love salt, and to me, the saltiness was just right. I dumped the cornstarch/water combo in the pot and it immediately thickened the mixture, so make sure you have a whisk nearby so you can whisk it before it clumps. This made it a perfect glaze consistency...  Simple recipe, perfect flavor!

Yummy! Doubled the recipe and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon as it is an ingredient in other teriyaki chicken recipes I've used and I feel it is crucial. Give it a try!

This is a very good recipe. I usually double the sauce and use it as a marinade for all my chicken- Baked, BBQ'd, and Grilled. I have been using this recipe for years. MMMMM so good. Thank you for the recipe.

This chicken was very good. I doubled the recipe when making the sauce. I also made a single recipe of the sauce earlier, and I marinated the chicken in it for a couple hours before baking. I think the next time I make this, I will cut some onion chunks and green peppers and put in with the sauce. It was delicious.

THis was pretty good and easy to make.  I marinated the chicken in the sauce for about 4-5 hrs and then put them on the grill still bastong and flipping every 10 min for about 45min to an hr.  I would probably make this again.

this was really yummy!  the sauce is the best teriyaki, so much more than store bought.  we used the extra teriyaki glaze and dizzled it over the chicken before serving, and over fried rice we made for an accompaniment.  wonderful!

Absolutely wonderful!!!! This is probably the best chicken I have ever cooked. After a couple times of making this recipe, I tried to experiment with making thai "money bags." Those too are great! After baking the chicken, shred it. Add a little bit of the sauce and mix with diced onion, cilantro, jalepeno, etc. Take wonton wrappers and put about a tsp. of the filling in each. Take corners and pinch and twist like little money bags. Fry at 365 degrees until golden brown. YUMMY!

Yum, yum, yum!!! Doubled sauce recipe, cooked it, cooled it, and then marinated (2) 20 oz packs of boneless skinless thighs for 3 hours, turning once.  I poured the chicken and marinade into the foil-lined pan. Changes per other reviews: Used 3/4 brown sugar and 1/4 white, low sodium soy sauce, added equivalent of 4 garlic cloves, lined baking pan with foil, sprayed foil with non-stick, and cooked covered with foil at 400 degrees for 30 min. and uncovered for 15 minutes.  Sauce good on rice too.  Next time I might put a little less vinegar.

OMGosh! This is soooo good! I did take the suggestion of doubling the recipe, using brown sugar and white sugar and lining my pan with tin foil. I used a fryer pack that was on sale this made my cheap meat taste DELISH! Even my pickiest eater ( who is six ) could not stop eating. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Really good! This sauce could easily be used for a Teriyaki stir fry (add sauce from saucepan to a sautee pan with cooked chicken, shrimp, pork, etc. with veggies and cook for approx five minutes). Would also work great on Kabobs on the grill! I followed the advice of reviewers & doubled the sauce (but not the vinegar). I also lined and covered the pan with foil for baking; easy clean up & no black, smokey mess. No need to brush or turn chicken if you use boneless breasts in a shorter, deeper dish as doubled sauce will nearly cover chicken. The cook time suggested is too long for boneless breasts though; 30/40 minutes is plenty. Served over wild rice with sauce as "gravy" over rice. Nice recipe! Possibilities are many! P.S. used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup white. Not at all too sweet!

Made with 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Didnt have cider vinegar, so I subbed red wine vinegar. Also, I didnt have ground ginger, so I used minced ginger (fr a jar). I added 3 tbsp of water to even out the taste. Marinated the chicken overnight in some of the sauce... baked next day and it came out juicy and incredibly flavourful. Excellent teriyaki chicken recipe!

Flavor was good, but I found the chicken a little dry.  I used breasts and baked at 400 for 30 minutes, per another's suggestion, but I wasn't watching the clock closely, so maybe I overcooked.  Will try again.

Making sauces and dressings just makes sense for us.  We know exactly what goes in them and they taste better!!  This is my go to teriyaki sauce recipe!!  It's really incredibly simple and turns out fantastic every time!!  I do always double the recipe... but before simmering it I will remove enough to use in the crock pot.  Then the remaining I hold onto for adding to the chicken at dinner as well as for the rice.  Everyone loves it!

Will become our standby teriyaki recipe.  Used chicken breasts & added extra clove of garlic. Served with lemongrass-jasmine rice.  I wish I had heeded the warning & lined pan with foil; it's a huge sticky mess.

I can not say enough good things about this recipe.  My only changes were to substitue Splenda for the requested sugar (I'm low-carbing and this made it allowable!), and I omitted the ginger (due to personal preferences only). This was soooooooooooooooooo good that when my husband came home from work the next day, the first thing he asked for was left over chicken and he wasn't too thrilled when I told him I had taken some for lunch :o)--trust me, my husband is very finicky and he has asked me to make this regularly!!  This is officially a staple in my recipe box. FYI:  12 packets Splenda=1/2 cup sugar and you won't even notice the difference. Excellent sweet tangy taste!!  No after-taste (and I used regular Splenda, not the "for baking" splenda!) Thank you soooooooooo much for such a quick and yummy recipe that I will be sure to pass down to my kids!

Used thigh fillets and followed directions as written. Kids loved it. I broiled it at the end of the cooking time to make a crusty cover, really tasty.

Really tasty.  Be sure to line the baking pan with aluminum foil that has been sprayed with cooking spray, however, or you will be throwing away your pan afterwards.

Excellent Teriyaki sauce! Followed the recipe exactly (alert the media!), but doubled the sauce recipe and marinated the chicken pieces in some of it for about an hour. Instead of cooking in the oven, we threw the chicken thighs outside on the grill and slow-cooked them, basting every 10 minutes with the sauce until they were done. Awesome flavor and gives a great carmelization on an outdoor grill! The next time I make this, I might toss in a few crushed red pepper flakes for a little extra kick to see how that turns out...can't wait to try basting burgers and ribs on the grill with this! This was a pleasant surprise - I have to admit that the vinegar smell was pretty strong throughout the house while it simmered, but there was no overly strong vinegar flavor at all in the end. Just sweet, tangy perfection!

I forgot that I cooked this once before using thighs and basting like crazy. It turned out great. This time I took others' advice and used the crockpot. I don't recommend that. Well, that or b/c I used boneless breasts rather than thighs. My chicken came out fairly dry and not too tasty. The sauce is great which is why I rated it as such (its super yummy on rice). And I know the recipe works, just not for me using breasts & a crockpot. I think the sauce takes awhile to cook though personally, so its not a 5 minute prep for me. I don't want to burn it so it takes awhile to boil and get thickened, like maybe 20 minutes or so after I get all the ingredients in. Oh yeah, I think there is a little bit too much vinegar in it (I only had garlic rice vinegar) and I will not put the entire amount in next time. I had to pour extra (low sodium) soy sauce in to balance out the taste. I'm going to try this on pork chops and chicken wings next time.

MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS DISH, IT WAS EASY TO MAKE AND I HAD DINNER ON THE TABLE IN ABOUT 45 MINS. THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS TO SUBSTITUTE THE 1\2 CUP OF SUGAR FOR 1\2 CUP OF SUGARFREE APRICOT JAM.    COOKED TILL IT WAS THICK. POURED THE SAUCE OVER 5  BONELESS CHICKEN THIGHS. THIS IS A KEEPER. THANKS

This was so good and easy to make. I did not have time to keep basting, so I just made the sauce on the stove and poured it over the chicken, covered with foil and let it cook for about 40 minutes. I used boneless, skinless chicken pieces. I served with rice and it was so good!!! Thanks for the recipe. This recipe is also toddler friendly. My 2.5 loved it!

This was very good.  I used chicken breasts, I marinated them overnight and had extra sauce cooked for the veggies and rice.  I cooked it covered with foil the first half an hour and then uncovered for 17 minutes.  Next time I will add sesame seeds and green onions.

I made this last night for my fiance's family, my fiance raved about how perfectly done it was! I used that amount of sauce over 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts in a 13x9 pan (they are rather big chicken breasts, they just fit :3) and poured the sauce over it and put foil in the pan first, then the chicken and sauce, then covered it with foil and baked at 400 for 30 minutes. Turned out fabulous with a side of rice and corn.

good recipe, and really easy.  I used chicken breasts I cut them into strips and I also doubled the recipe.  I didn't have cider vin. so I used rice vinager and it still tasted good.  I cooked the sauce then marinated the strips in the sauce for a good hour then dumped the sauce and the chicken in to a foil lined baking dish and cooked them slowly.  There was plenty of sauce and it was great over rice.  A little to much ginger for my taste so next time I will use less...but I am not much of a ginger fan anyway.

Excellent sauce. Hubby LOVED it. He compared it to that of an upscale Chinese restaurant his company frequents. I stir-fried the chkn and added veggies.) I double the sauce & saved it for a salmon dinner two days later!

Delicious.  I only had 2 Perdue ready to freeze chicken thighs.  I did the same recipe, just cut down a bit on each ingredient (but really not that much - I like saucy).  I poured the sauce right over the 2 thighs in an 8x8 dish and cooked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  Served over jasmine rice with the bacon-y bok choy from this website.  Wonderful.

Wonderful Recipe. I used chicken breasts instead of the thighs and left out the vinegar (just because I didn't have it). It was delicious. I fix it all the time now and could eat the whole pan by myself. Serve over rice. Perfect.

My family loved it. This is so easy to make that my kids did most of the work. We used boneless chicken thighs so we did not cook it as long as indicated in the recipe.

Excellent chicken. The sauce is a bit overwhelming while cooking on the stove top, but once it is baked onto the chicken, it is delightful! My family loves this recipe, including my picky 2 year old =)

It wasn't as good as I expected from all the great reviews, but it's still tasty. Definitely double or even triple the ingredients for sauce - more for vegetables, rice, and just extra flavor generally. But could reduce the cider vinegar and soy sauce because it is a little bit on the salty side. Also reduce the sugar. I felt the recipe was missing a key ingredient: SESAME OIL!!!! Add 2 tablespoons or so will definitely make it a lot better. The final product came out tasting good, but very commercial. I was hoping for a more gourmet teriyaki recipe! Also I used breast tenders and it came out very dry, next time I will definitely try chicken thighs instead.

I really enjoyed making this and the teriyaki sauce was very good. Instead of chicken thighs I use breast which was good.

GREAT flavor~!  Awesome!  I used maple syrup instead of sugar (son shouldn't eat sugar), fresh grated ginger...baked the chicken in the marinade with a lid on - approx. 45 min...PERFECT!  Thank-you for sharing!

I used about 10-12 chicken tenders for this, because I wanted to make teriyaki chicken skewers. I followed the directions for the sauce, marinated for 8 hours, then cubed the chicken. I put 4 or 5 pieces of chicken on each skewer, along with some pineapple chunks. Set the oven to broil, lined a cookie sheet with foil (crucial!), and poured 1/3 of unused marinade on top. Broiled for 5 minutes. Turned, added more sauce, and broiled again. I ended up cooking these for something like 20 minutes. I served them at a cocktail party, but I got distracted and left them in the oven too long. I was afraid they'd be tough or dry, but people literally devoured them. I wish I'd made more--10 chicken tenders made about 20 skewers. Be sure to marinade for at least a few hours, so the flavor will really get intot the meat.

We love it. It doesn't taste like store brand at all and is a perfect compliment for thigh or breast meat. I like to put it close to the broiler for about 5 minutes towards the end of cooking for a crispier taste on the thigh meat. Thanks it's quick, easy, cheapier and delicious. PERFECT!!

I used chicken thighs with skin (only about 4-5) and put them in a loaf pan instead. I made the amount of sauce needed for 12 pieces of chicken and didn't turn the chicken over but kept it baking for an hour. It ended up to be WONDERFUL! I would suggest doubling the sauce if you actually make the 12 pieces, having the chicken 'drowning' in the sauce makes it very very tender.

This was very easy to make and had great teriyaki flavor. I used boneless chicken breasts, covered the chicken for first 30 minutes and left uncovered for last 5 minutes. Very good and definitely line your pan with foil - it makes clean up super easy.

Pretty darn good! I followed the recipe exactly except for using skinless chicken breasts. Also, I think that the baking time needs to be decreased, the chicken turned out somewhat dry! Enjoy this one!!!

This was okay. I was expecting so much more because of all the positive reviews. It wasn't that we didn't like it, it just wasn't something that makes me think WOW. I doubt I'll make it again. I have better teriyaki recipes.

Wonderful recipe! I made it as written except used 1/2 tsp garlic powder since I didn't have any fresh. I also covered to bake until the end. Very flavorful! I didn't find it very sweet, but sweet enough. Served over rice with carrots on the side.

Very good sauce.  Rated it 5 for taste & ease.  As suggested by others, I doubled the recipe; used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup regular.  I also added 3 green onions and pineapple chunks.  Chicken came out tender & the sauce was really good.  Would definitely keep in the rotation for dinner.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I added some red pepper. And it turned out just like it said it would...but, it was too sweet for me and I was hoping it would be a lot spicier. Everyone else said they liked it though. Next time I won't use so much sugar and will add some cayanne pepper or something  to give a little more of a kick.

We were really hungry, so we cut up the chicken and cooked it with the garlic while we prepared the sauce. Once everthing was mixed together we poured it over the chicken and cooked it until it thickened. We also added a little bit of honey towards the end. Over white rice this was easy and great.

This was great!! I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the recipe and I used fresh ginger (about 1 tablespoon for a double recipe). Also I used 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. I served this over rice and with a side of broccoli. Oh yeah I cooked it at 400 degrees in my convection oven for 30 minutes covered with foil, then turned and cooked for 15 minuted uncovered. Chicken was incredibly tender.

I used chicken cutlets and the dish was pretty tasty.  The color or appearance of the chicken was a little tough to look at but it went well with rice and green beans.  I covered mine with foil halfway through and it cooked for about 45 minutes.  The chicken stayed tender as well.

Very good flavor, easy to make! Loved the sauce - made double. Added 1 more clove of garlic and minced fresh ginger instead of powder. also used lite soy sauce. I used chicken breasts and yes, they did cook much quicker (I had put in oven at 400 for about 40 mins) and they came out kind of dry. I will have to make again this time not over cooking! very delicious though!

I will definitely make this again...I really liked the sauce, but next time I will double it like some other reviewers suggested...the chicken was not as tender as I would have liked, but that was my own fault...that got my wheels turning that this would be a great slow cooker recipe...next time I might just try it that way.

The sauce took about 3 minutes to whip together and the flavor was great. Next time I will try with breasts or thighs. I used some leftover sauce and cooked it with some frozen corn and peas, adding a little water. My son loved it all.

This is a consistent hit with the kids.  They love the sweet sauce.  I've overcooked it a time or two, but as long as I follow the right cooking time it comes out perfectly tender.

Really delicious!  I took the hint of lining the pan with foil (great cleanup saver).  Next time I make it, I'm planning on taking the skin off the chicken before baking, as my family does not like soft "rubbery" skin. Great flavor and pretty darn easy to boot!

Followed the ingredients exactly....However instead of brushing the sauce on I dipped the chicken in the sauce to coat then place it on a foil lined baking pan and poured the remaining sauce over it and marinated it for about 6 hours then baked covered in a 400 degree oven for 30 mins then uncovered for another 30 minutes.  It was very good.  Although hubby said it tasted like BBQ Chicken as opposed to Teriyaki.

Very yummy recipe!!  I've made it twice now, skinless breasts and thighs and I thought the thighs(skin on) were much better!  I baked at 400 for an hour and that was plenty, dumped most the sauce in at the begining and halfway through dumped the rest, basted a couple of times the last 30 minutes.

Amazing sauce. I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce but stuck to the recipe exactly except for having to use garlic powder instead of a clove. I used a whole cut up chicken and poured half of the sauce over it before baking and then basted every 10 minutes.  Best teriyaki I've ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for this great Teriyaki recipe, Marian! My dish turned out great and the whole family (even my two year old) enjoyed it. I just adjusted the soy sauce (used low sodium) and sugar to how I liked it. It is an easy recipe and very close to the Teriyaki served in restaurants.

loved it! tried it a gazillion times since only made a couple of changes after searching for other teriyaki recipies, added a touch of honey into the marinade and i left the chicken thighs in the marinade overnight.  Made it last week and everyone loved it, but i subbed ground ginger for real grated ginger, and think i put a little too much in :(

I was very impressed with the way this turned out. I used chicken breast instead of thighs. Also I spooned some of the juices out during the cooking process and it turned into a thick wonderful sauce, otherwise followed everything exactly. This is an excellent recipe!

This is one that is really good and simple to make.  The flavors are just perfect and it just makes you wonder why go out to eat something like this when you can make it at home.  My daughter thought it smelled weird when I was making the sauce and she didn't think she would like it. Um, well she loved it and always wants me to make it.  We ate this with rice and spinach.

After only one bite, this was already getting rave reviews. I used white wine vinegar instead of the cider vinegar because i didnt have any on hand. But it still turned out AWESOME and this recipe will be used again in the very near future.

I used skinless thighs.  They didn't crisp as they would have if they were with the skin on.  Don't cry of there's too much sugar or salt.  You have enough time to taste the baste before you start marinating the chicken.  I always use fish sauce with these kinds of recipes but remember, don't exceed 1 tsp; it is a very strong flavoring ingredient.  I cut some very thin slices of cabbage to lay the chicken onto, which intensifies the flavor by nullifying the pungencies but pushing the texture.  YUM.

everyone loved this dish. i used chicken breasts, and marinated them for about an hour. then baked at 375 for 30 minutes and at 400 for about 15 minutes more. they were drier than i'd hoped, so next time i will skip the last 15 minutes at a higher temp and just cook at 375 the whole way through. there was enough sauce for everyone (but we didn't use it on the rice). i used rice vinegar and brown sugar, plus a bit more ginger. thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is YUMMY and very versatile.  I used this to make stirfry chinese veggies with tofu ande udon noodles.  This was fantastic!  I had originally intended to use this for teriyaki chicken wings, but Thought I would try this with the stirfry inst4ead. I had everythihng in the house except cider vinegar, so I used rice vinegar with a bit more garlic and ginger.  The recipe was a bit sweet, but perfect after I added a dab of Wasabi.  Now I can't wait ti make this on chicken or beef.......Thanks Marian! Definitely a keeper.

This was excellent.  Like others suggested, I doubled the sauce and changed the sugar to 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup white sugar.  I used to make an adabo recipe.  I am switching to this one!

I also used chicken breasts, marinated them in the sauce for about 3 hours, and replaced the sugar with Splenda.  The chicken cooked in half the time, and was pretty good.  I don't have a brush so I just kind of scooped on sauce every 10 minutes.  I didn't get that teriyaki "crust" because I think I used too much sauce on the chicken without the brush.  But the flavor was still really good, and my husband loved it.  I will be making this again.

I cut the chicken into large pieces and cooked in a wok on the stove-top, not that great. **Changing my review: FANTASTIC when grilled! Made extra sauce to serve. I have not tried to bake in the oven, but do not cook this on teh stove.

SUPER GOOD!!!!  I've never been a fan of teriyaki ever but my husband is so I thought I'd give it a go.  So glad I did.  Husband devoured it!  Made just as written served over white rice and side of brocoli.  Will absolutly be making this again!

My family loved this dish.  It was very, very tasty but I used boneless, skinless thighs so I cut the cooking time by 20 minutes.  My husband suggested adding strips of bellpeper, onion and water chestnuts to the dish while it cooks.  I'll try it next time.

This was very good. I doubled the sauce and used half for a marinade then thickened the other half for basting. I used half apple juice and half soy sauce because I didn't have low sodium soy sauce and was worried about the salty taste as other reviewers noted. Thanks for the recipe!

i thought this recipe was easy and very tasty.  i used low sodium soy sauce, and instead of sugar i used calorie free splenda, and was very pleased to find it cuts 65 calories per serving, as well as 16.7 carbs!  for those of us watching what we eat, that makes a big change and the taste is still right on.  first night i ate it with brown rice and it was good, but second night over broccoli and sweet potatoes was super delicious and even healthier.  will make again, thanks.

I made this a few days ago and I modified it, not much though.  I changed the sugar to 1/4 cup and used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce.  I boiled it up to let it thicken and then poured it over my cut up chicken breast in large chunks, broccoli, match stick carrott sticks and thin sliced onion in a foil oven bag and baked it on 325 for about 45 minutes to an hour.  Served it over thin spagetti.  It was to die for.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

I love baked chicken recipes, and this one did the trick. The sauce was nice and it complimented the moistness of the chicken. Not too sticky either.

Our family of six all LOVED this dish!So easy and so good...The only thing I did different was to double the sauce and marinade for several hours as the chicken breasts were thawing out.  Can't wait to try this on chicken wings.

This was excellent and so very easy!  I used skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (about 2 1/2 pounds) and doubled the sauce, using brown sugar.  Definitely a keeper as it is especially easy to prepare for a large crowd.

Delicious and easy!!  I made the sauce earlier in the day, used a whole cut up chicken, and marinated it for a few hours in the fridge.  Also, since I was out of ginger, I used some candied ginger slices that I diced very fine...it worked wonderfully.  I baked it in a clear glass 9 x 13 dish...and it really wasn't that difficult to clean since I let it soak while we were eating this yummy chicken!  This is definitely going into the rotation.  Thanks so much for sharing and making me look like a good cook!

Very good recipe. Totally agree with covering the baking pan before placing the chicken, or you'll have a big black mess. I will do it again, but will half-cook the chiken before baking it in the sause for better taste.

EXCELLENT!  Used chicken breasts and subsituted white wine vinegar for the cider vinegar.  Doubled the sauce, but had over half of it left over which is fine because it's VERY good and I'll use it up with other meals.

We LOVE this dish. The sauce I made came out wonderfully thick. I made 1 1/2 servings of the sauce-didn't quite double it. Definately baste every 10 minutes. Thank you for this recipe!!!!

This was good.  I used chicken tenders in place of the thighs and it worked well.  Used regular soy sauce and I didn't think it was too saltly. Also, I didn't double the sauce recipe and it had a lot of sauce when done. Sprayed a casserole dish with nonstick spray and it cleaned up pretty quickly.

Holy Salt!  Def need to use a low sodium soy sauce.  I doubled the sauce which I made in the afternoon and poured about 3/4 of it in 13x9 inch pan and put 8 boneless chicken breasts in.  I let that marinate in the fridge for a few hours with some pineapple slices on top.   I took out of fridge 1/2 before baking and baked uncovered at 375 for 30 minutes and they were perfect.  Didn't really need the extra sauce I reserved.  Next time I will also add 1/2 the ginger as well because I'm not a huge fan of a strong ginger taste.   As a side note-the sauce does take a good 1/2 hour to thicken and bubble.  Will def try again with minor adjustments because it was good!

This is a staple in my home.  I've modified the recipe based on my families tastes.  I use Chicken Breast instead of thighs and make this into a stove top stir fry with broccoli, carrots, and onions.  The soy is pretty strong when making it this way so I normally half the amount of soy and substitute it w/orange joice or sometimes chicken broth.

Delish! I looked in my pantry for cornstarch, & realized I was out- subbed flour & it worked fine! Being lazy, I just mixed the marinade & poured over my boneless, skinless breasts. I covered the dish for the first 10 minutes, then baked for 30 more minutes, turning the chicken over every 10 minutes. Came out with a perfect slightly thick glaze. Used a 375 oven & also subbed out 1/3 c. Splenda instead of sugar. Yum!

Really good and the whole family loved it.  Easy and chicken was tender and nicely glazed.  I also put the chicken in with all the glaze from the beginning and basted and flipped the chicken a few times during cooking.  Also, decreased the oven temp to 375.  This will definitely be made again!

This turned out great.  We love ginger.  We used leg quarters that were on sale and boiled them for about 20 minutes with skin on, then let them cool for about 10 minutes deskinned then, added rest of ing. let bake and they were tender, juicy and just awesome.  Thanks for the post.

This was great! I bbq'd the chicken rather than baking it.  I put the sauce on half way through cooking the chicken.  It was cooked for an hour total.  What a great way to change up BBQ chicken every once in awhile.  Definitely a recipe I will pass on and make again.

Another winner! This recipe was quick and made the house smell incredible. I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar and added more garlic and fresh ginger.  I, too, doubled the sauce.

My family loved this, but I am only giving 4 stars because I think the cooking temp (or cooking time) is too high! I cooked 6 thighs and 6 legs at 375 for one hour - perfect. I doubled the sauce and used Splenda instead of sugar. Was a big hit and would be good on pork chops or salmon too!

I thought this recipe was great, it had lots of different flavors: sweet from sugar, sour from soy sauce, and spicy from the garlic.  My husband doesn't like anything that has flavor, and complained about it being too sweet.  I will make this again, but will cut down on the sugar.

Very flavorful and moist!  I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  Because they were thick, they baked for about 40 miuntes.  Very yummy!

Minor changes. Used lemon juice instead of vinegar. Used boneless breasts. I dipped the breasts into the marinade and placed them in the baking dish and flipped the chicken and poured more sauce on them about every 5 minutes. WOW talk about tender and juicy and yummy!

The sauce was delicious!  My husband loved it.  I will make it again and again.  The sauce took a while to boil, so I turned up the heat a little bit more.  I doubled the recipe so I could have sauce for the rice too.

Yummy!  I used pkgd chicken that's already cut up and trimmed the fat and skins off.  I was afraid of it being too dry so I doubled the sauce and poured some of it in the pan before I placed the chicken in it.  I basted every 10 minutes as instructed.  My husband and I albsolutely loved this recipe!  Next time I'll try stir frying some veggies w/ the extra sauce.  Thank you!!!

The only reason I give this recipe a 4 is that my husband has yet to believe it is supposed to be Teriyaki sauce! We really like the taste, but he always says it tastes more like a barbeque sauce to him. So, if you're looking for a very tasty recipe, try it, just be warned that you may not find this to be a real "Teriyaki" recipe.

This came out perfectly.  I used 1 lb of chicken breast, and took the advice of other reviewers to double the sauce - it was a bit much for so little meat, but now I have leftover that I can use for a stir-fry or something.  I also cut back on the soy sauce, and used 1/2 c brown & 1/4 cup white sugar.  Served this over rice with broccoli, green peppers, and snap peas. Great leftover too. Thanks Marian!

This was really good, my husband said best chicken ever!!! You do really need to brush the chicken every 10, otherwise the sauce burns in the bottom of the pan! Loved it!

I can't believe how easy and delicious this recipe is! My husband went nuts for this chicken and it has become a regular in our home. So good! I threw a couple chopped scallions (green & white parts) on top for the last couple minutes of baking for an extra touch of color and taste.

Great easy meal. I doubled the sauce, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. Put half the sauce in with the chicken, covered with foil and cooked 20 minutes on each side. Thanks for a good tasting, quick meal.

Really good.  It was a bit sweet, so I cut down the sugar the second time I made it.  I also used boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  The second time I made it was vegetarian night, so I just made a vegetable stir-fry and made the sauce to pour over it.  Great!

Used a mix of legs and thighs and it was delicious.  So tender that it was falling off the bone.

WONDERFUL!!!! MY HUSBAND WILL NOT EAT CHICKEN BREAST UNLESS IT IS MADE THIS WAY. THE ONLY THING THAT I DID CHANGE WAS I CUT THE CHICKEN IN VERY SMALL PIECES AND COOK IT ONLY ABOUT 20-25 MIN AND I WON'T DARE CHANGE THE SAUCE.

This was a very good & easy recipe, and the chicken was tender. For a bit more flavor marinade chicken for about 30 min. Try using low sodium soy sauce for a less salty flavor and fresh ginger if possible. Tried again using sushi vinegar, also excellent.

This recipe has become a favorite in our house, plus I've passed it on to all our friends.  Some of our friends run board and care homes, and their residents request this dish often!  It's so tasty and healthy too, and simple to make.  I substitute splenda for the sugar, and no one even notices.

I am a big fan of Teriyaki, and this marinade is terrific!The chicken was tender and flavorful. I used just 1/4 tsp. ginger and one tbsp. less vinegar than stated, and this was a hit with three generations of my family! Thanks for a great recipe! (PS: Great served with "Bud´s Potato Salad", also found at allrecipes.com)

this recipe turned out really well the first time i tried it.  i'm impressed with how easy and simple it was to make.  marinated the chicken with the sauce for an hour before baking.  cooking time only took 30 minutes (15 minutes each side) instead of 1 hour.  didn't need to brush with sauce every 10 minutes as i had placed extra sauce in the baking dish.  only brushed more sauce on once after 15 minutes when chicken pieces were turned.  overall, great recipe.  did find the taste a little bit too sweet/sour but will adjust next time i try it again!

Great Recipe!  It's a great tasting teriyaki sauce, although a bit sweeter than what I'm used to.  I took some other peoples advice and marinated the chicken in the sauce for a couple hours.  It was delicious!  i also didn't need to cook it as long as stated, the cook time for me was 30 min.  I ate it with sauteed mushrooms and rice.

This is the best! I tripled the recipe and used it to cook four cut up chickens. This was the big hit at the family reunion. I even had extra sauce and used it for a grilled Salmon a few days later. It was yummy too.

We really enjoyed this!  Used extra garlic and boned, skinned chicken breasts and baked for 45 minutes.  Should have oiled the glass baking dish, though, because it was a beast to clean.

After eating a chicken teriyaki hoagie from Subway I really wanted to try this. It was really good! I used about 10 chicken strips and only baked it for about 45 minutes. I followed the directions and brushed it though. It was DELICIOUS and everyone loved it!

I LOVE this sauce...!  I made a double batch as suggested by others but STILL used all of it on the chicken while it baked. I made another batch (as originally listed) for the table.  The whole family loved it - Thanks!!

Yummy! I thought I could only buy teriyaki sauce in a bottle! I used the EXACT ingredients the recipe called for. Very easy. I heated the sauce in the microwave until it bubbled and thickened. I only stirred once. It’s fast because of the sugar. I didn’t do thighs. I injected the sauce into a whole chicken and roasted it, basting it with the remaining sauce 2 or 3 times. I roasted the whole chicken according to the per lb. directions on the wrapper. You might want to double the sauce recipe if you have a really big roaster. It was very moist and delicately flavored. Real restaurant quality - fit for company fare. The chicken came out picture perfect brown, as good as any I’ve ever had rotisseried from the deli. I WILL make this again.

Wow, this was great.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly.  The only thing I did difrently is I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and instead of basting every 10 minutes I basted the top real well and just poured the rest of the sauce around the chicken.  This was so tender and so yummy.  It will defintley go into rotation for dinner at my house. Thanks for sharing!

Not bad but I'll stick to marinating my chicken to get more flavor inside.

Love the sauce! It's better as a marinade. It's much better marinated couple hours or over night. Love it. It will be a keeper. Thanks!

My boyfriend swore he didn't like Teriyaki until he tried this recipe!  The extra sauce was good with rice/veggies.  If you happen to buy chicken thighs with the skin on them, make SURE you remove it before you start baking the chicken.  If you don't, it'll get black and crusty.  Very good otherwise!

This recipe is wonderful as is, but something that makes the teriyaki even better is a little pureed pineapple blended in after it's cooked, and before you put it on the chicken. The cooked chicken also goes well over rice.

I found this to be an easy and great tasting sauce.  Didn't change a thing.  Took about 30 minutes to make the sauce thicken, left it simmering as the chicken cooked, was really thick by the end.  On last rotation, I poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it that way for 10 minutes.  Result was that the sauce really stuck to the chicken.  My 2 year old ate 3 drumsticks, WOW!  No more store bought teriyaki sauce!!! Thanks for sharing Marian!!

This recipe could not be any better! I followed the directions exactly and followed the basting regimen of every 10 minutes. I did double the sauce to ensure I had plenty for basting the chicken.  I used a turkey baster to limit coating my kitchen with the sauce (but, I am a messy cook). The chicken thighs were tender, moist and had an excellent flavor. This recipe will forever stay in my recipe book because my entire family of picky eaters loved it. Thank you for sharing.

YUM!!!!  My husband (who is soooo picky) LOVED this recipe!  Wowee!  It was excellent.  I only cooked my chicken for 40 minutes (tested it with a thermometer) and I took other readers advice and doubled the sauce mix.  Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe!  I'm taking the leftovers to my son's church choir teacher tonight!  She'll love it!!!

I think the ratings really speak for themselves.  This is a great way to eat chicken.  You can even grill the chicken too, and put the sauce over it.  I use the teriyaki sauce on salmon too.

My family loved this one!  It was so easy and tasted great!  I did make one substitution, I used about 8 packets of Equal in place of the white sugar for the diabetic in my house.  Next time I might try using low-sodium soy sauce, just to cut down on the sodium a little.  I only made 5 pieces of chicken, thighs and drumsticks, and there was just enough sauce, but I basted it a lot!  Even my five year old loved it!  Thanks for the quick, easy, low-fat recipe!

This was a success at my house. My kids like pineapple so I wanted to add some sliced pineapple on top of my chicken breasts.  I also poured a little pineapple juice in the teriyake sauce.  I poured the sauce over the chicken and made sure each piece was coated on all sides.  Midway through cooking, I turned each piece and made sure each was coated in more sauce.  I was too lazy to brush them every 10 minutes, and they turned out fine.  A few minutes before taking them out, I put a slice of pineapple on each one.  This was great with rice pilaf.

The second time I made this recipe, I did everything exactly the same as before but I used one of those oven bags.  Much easier to coat the chicken and easy clean up too!

Nothing special.  
The sauce was similar to bottled varieties...which has both pros and cons.  Pro, you can adjust flavoring to taste, and only fresh ingredients are going into the sauce.  Con, why spend the time making something that's inexpensive and readily available at the store?
As far as the cook time, the constant basting left a pool of sauce on the bottom of the pan, which burned while cooking, leaving a lingering "burnt food" smell in the kitchen.  It also left a sticky mess on the bottom of the pan.  I highly suggest lining your pan with heavy duty foil, grease it, then place the chicken.  In the end, I wasn't impressed by the sauce.  I thought it was very generic.  My husband said it may go well with grilled salmon.  That may be true, but until I find a standout teriyaki recipe, I'll stick to bottled sauce.

So easy and delicious!  I used only 1/4 of regular sugar and upped the garlic to 3 cloves, as others suggested.  Cut some boneless, skinless chicken breasts into strips and mixed them in to my saucepan when the sauce had thickened (I did not have a small saucepan, just medium sized).  Did not do any brushing, just mixing.  Poured it all into my foil lined pan and baked at 425 for about 30 minutes.  Wonderful recipe!

Wow! Absolutely incredible! Better than expected! It tasted even better the next day.. better than any teryiaki restaurant I've been to. Next time I will use low sodium soy and less sugar, but that's just personal preferance. Also, I will reduce cooking time down to 45-50 minutes as it started to get a bit dry. MMM good. Will make that again very soon.

I love the fact that I can now have teriyaki sauce, homemade, hence the 4 stars. I made this with cut up wings and drumsticks, which I marinated overnight in the fridge. I used fresh garlic and ginger, which I pounded. After trying this dish baked, which is ok, I tried it again, but this time grilled (and basted with fresh lemongrass 'brush' dipped in oil/melted butter at intervals), which makes the chicken yummier, aromatic and crisply glazed, mmmmm. A very good blend of ingredients. Had them with fried rice and bird eye chillies (for zing). Good one.

The sauce is fabulous.  Next time I will make double the amount as my family wanted more to spoon over their rice.  I think I will use boneless thighs when I make this again.

Absolutely wonderful!  I used chicken tenders and cooked them for 15 minutes, basted them on both sides and then cooked for another 15 minutes. They turned out really juicy and tender.  I also lined the pan with foil for easy cleanup.  I used a little less sugar than what was called for and 3 cloves of garlic.  Superb!

I baked this on top of a broiling pan - the fat dripped out and the skin was nice and crispy.  Husband and 3-year-old said it was a keeper.

I used brown sugar in place of regular white
sugar, and then grilled the chicken outside. It
was very good. I don't know if it would've been 
as tasty without doing those 2 changes. I made
fried rice from a recipe on this website to go 
along with it.

I made this last night, but it came out with an oddly salty flavour.  Next time I will use lite soya sauce. I didn't find it too sweet at all..try using half white sugar and half brown, it seems to give the sauce a nice depth.  Also, definately double the recipe, the sauce is great over fried rice.  Overall, a recipe worth keeping.

This recipe was very, very good. I did not cook the sauce on stove top. I just added it to the chicken and baked it. I recommend doubling the sauce.

I like my teriyaki chicken grilled so I used this as a marinade.  I doubled the garlic and added olive oil and skipped the cornstarch.  Also used brown sugar in place of some of the white.  Came out great.  Next time I will add a bit of hot sauce and onion powder and other spices to give it even more of a kick but the recipe as it is, is surprisingly good and easy!

I thought the marinade didn't quite penetrate the chicken.  Next time I'll marinate it in the sauce for an hour or two.  It was delicious regardless.  My friends raved about it.

Very delicious....I would reduce the soy sauce just a little to lighten up the saltiness,other than that it's great with chicken or tofu.A winner,thanks.

I always thought making teryaki sauce was much more difficult than this!  This was wonderful.  Boyfriend said I could make this anytime!  I did double the sauce, and marinade the chicken before cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  I used red wine vinegar and chicken breast strips.  It only took 30 minutes to bake.  Next time I'll try adding fresh vegetables and a little bit of red pepper for some heat.  This goes great with rice.

I thought this was just ok. The prep time was very fast.  But I cooked the chicken for 50 min and it was way too dry!  The teriyaki sauce was good, but maybe a little too sweet.  I don't know if I'll use this recipe again.

This was good.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Next time, I will use white meat--it needed a different texture.  I would also highly recommend doubling the sauce.  If you don't, there is no sauce to pour over the rice.  Will make again.

Very good. I used boneless breasts cut into bite sized pieces & served over rice. I also added 1/4 c crushed pineapple with the juice & used 1/4 c white sugar & 1/4 c brown sugar, plus 2 cloves garlic since we're garlic lovers.

Excellent recipe!  1 hour cook time was perfect - chicken was juicy even with boneless, skinless thighs.  Just baked them in the sauce & we loved it!

This was so-so, it really wasn't as great as I had hoped.  

I trippled the sauce recipe and added some green onions and pineapple to the leftover sauce to make a teriyaki topping for the chicken, and that turned out good!

If you modify this recipe at all, watch out for the ginger!  Use less and less ginger the more you double the recipe.  It can take over.

We love the flavor of this recipe.  I have made it a couple times now.  I use chicken breasts and cut them up into cubes after they are done cooking and serve it over rice with extra teriyaki sauce.  It tastes great and the leftovers are even better for lunch the next day!

Yummy!  It's a little bit sweet so I would cut back on the sugar, but it was delicious and the chicken was very tender.  Make sure to take off the skin!  (I almost forgot that part)

This is a "must" recipe if you love teriyaki chicken. I doubled the sauce recipe, used chicken breasts that I had pounded out thinner, and also did as others suggested and used foil on the bottom! of the pan. I baked them at 400 degrees and it only took about 40 minutes because of the thinner breasts. In a small skillet I sauteed some green oinions and diced red pepper until soft, added pineapple tidbits with a little juice, some of the teriyaki sauce and cornstarch and cooked it until it thickened and then put it on the chicken just before serving. This is wonderful eating....try it you'll like it. Thanks, Marian!!

An absolutely delious tasting sauce for chicken or pork.  I use rice vinegar when I make this. I also make stirfry recipes and add this sauce near the end. Everyone loves this teriyaki sauce.

My family really like this one.  It can get a little messy cleaning the pan afterwards so I put a piece of foil on the bottom first, and it makes cleanup a snap.

I just got done making and eating this dish with my wife.  It was wonderful!  I made it over rice, and the sauce was fantastic.  I used a mix of breasts and thighs, and I prefer the breasts (note: it's about 1.5 breasts to 1 thigh for recipe sake)  Also, put a slice of pineapple on each in the last 10 minutes.  Wonderful!  I'm about to clean up - the pan looks pretty bad :(

Delicious!  My husband thought it a bit sweet, but we both rate this recipe as a "keeper".  Next time I'll try using the sauce to grill!  I preheated to 425 as the recipe suggested, but then cut the heat down to 350 while baking.

I used chicken breast pieces (375, 40 minutes) and put pineapple chunks on top for the last 10 minutes. This turned out fantastic! It even passes the picky eater test.It's quick, delicious, and definitely a keeper!

I loved this recipe!  Made it twice in a week and my husband and I were very very happy!  I doubled the recipe and adjusted the ingredients a little...which I always do.  I also used aluminum foil in the pan and sprayed with oil, as I read this was very sticky!  I used the sauce to put over mashed potatoes!!  Also, I used breasts instead...which I loved!  Be sure to adjust baking time!  This is a wonderful recipe that I will continue to use!  Thanks!

I loved this sauce.  It's not too sweet and not too soy.  My EXTREMELY picky boyfriend said it didn't taste like normal teriyaki but he scraped his plate clean!  In the future, I would probably add a little more cornstarch for a thicker sauce and a dash of lemon juice.  Otherwise, it was simple and tasty!

The recipe was excellent and very easy.  I would use slightly less sugar next time because it was a little too sweet

This recipe is great!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it turned out wonderful.  I baked them at 375 for about 40 minutes and they were just right.  Might try using the sauce for stir-fry?  Great tasting sauce, will definately make again!

What a great recipe!  I made it for my wife and daughter and they LOVED it, the sauce
is easy, tasty and flavorfull.  The clean up is a mess, but I boiled water in the pan after
I was done and it cleaned up pretty quick.  
I am making this sauce again tonight and using it with another recipe that calls for Teriyaki 
sauce.  
Thanks Marian!

My boyfriend told me *5 times* (within about an hour) how much he liked this recipe.  Like many others reviewers, I substituted chicken breast and adjusted the cooking time.

I have cooked this several ways now.  I have found following the recipe and basting every ten minutes to be the best way.  The sauce gets caked on the chicken instead of running off of it.   I used a glass dish to cooked them in.  Makes a mess of the dish but just let it soak for a few hours or overnight.  Edit: still making this years later.  We love the sauce!!!

This is the best teriyaki chicken I've ever had.  The sauce is wonderful!  I plan on using this recipe again and again.  Next time, I'll add some red pepper flakes to spice it up a little.   I may even use the sauce over some sesame chicken.  Thanks, Marian, for a great new recipe!

I love this recipe!  I have not only used this sauce for the recipe indicated, but I also use it in my chicken stir-fry.   I just cook up a batch of the sauce, cook the chicken and throw frozen vegetables, onions all into a large skillet and cook for about 10-15 minutes.  I serve it over instant rice.  It's awesome!

Although there was nothing wrong with this recipe, it just didn't WOW me or my family.  The good thing about it is that I had all ingredients on hand and it was quick.  It was tasty enough, but I probably won't make it again.

Yum!  I used the thighs (skin removed) and it came out great!  I did run out of basting sauce before the cooking was done and wound up using pan drippings instead - next time I'll 1 1/2 times the sauce.  Thanks!

The sauce was amazing - I double the recipe and was so glad I did. One warning, though...I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and followed some of the other reviewers suggestions for cooking times, and my meat was over-cooked. Check the chicken each time you baste it and you should be fine.

Instead of baking the chicken, I grilled boneless, skinless chicken breasts with the sauce on them.  I used the remaining sauce on white rice to taste.  It was absolutely wonderful.  It ranked right up there with the teriyaki I have had on the West coast.

This was very easy & fast. Even our fussiest eater loved this & wanted more.  Maybe the temp could have been a little lower because it started to burn the sauce on the outter edges but otherwise a keeper!!!

A very nice change for dinner. I used chicken breast cut in half. Placed them in a 9x13,lined with foil and coated lightly with olive oil. I added one extra garlic clove and approx. 1 tsp. of sesame seeds too. Brown rice was what I served it on top of and it was decicious!  The cooking time is a bit much in my opinion.  I cooked  the chicken at 425 for 15 min. then 375 for 30 min.

While I must concur with those who say that this recipe makes quite a mess out of your baking dish, it was very much worth the cleanup effort.  This makes for delicious chicken.  One comment, though.  I tried pouring the excess sauce on my rice, and I don't know if it was because I used fresh ginger, but it was really strong.  The sauce that was basted on the chicken, however, was MUCH tastier.

Yum! I didn't have the ginger so I left it out. I did, however, add about 1 tsp of sesame seeds. My husband and 15 month old daughter loved it, I know that if my 7 year old was home she would have loved it too! I used chicken breasts cut in 1/2 instead of thighs, this would make some yummy wings as well!

Great recipe!  My daughter who hates chicken loved it, the one who loves chicken didn't care for it.  Didn't have cider vinegar, so just used white.
Will definitely make again!!!

I’ve been looking for a teriyaki sauce recipe for a long time and I think I’ve found what I’ve been searching for!  Loved it so much I made it twice in one week.  I strongly suggest that you use parchment paper to line the baking dish/sheet.  Not a big fan of tin foil.

This recipe is delicious!  The only change I made was in the baking time.  The first time the chicken was very dried out.  I reduced the cooking time after turning to 10 additional minutes and it was very tender and juicy!!  I will definitely make this again and again!!!

Super easy to make. My family enjoyed it. Made it with  coconut rice, so would add less sugar to teriyaki sauce. Added steamed veggies and poured left over sauce on them. Cant wait to make again

nice basic recipe
I made some changes though
First i parboiled some bell pepper and onion slices and lined the bottom of the baking dish.
I also used fresh ginger and only brown sugar after doubling the sauce.
yum yum

This is a really tasty recipe! The only think I changed was the sauce method. I poured half of the sauce on the chicken before putting it in the oven and then added the remaining 30 minutes into cooking time. Came out perfect! I paired it with steamed white rice and it was great! Will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe! I usually cook the chicken alone for the first 30 minutes and drain off fat. Then after flipping begin the brushing, just because I don’t want all the wonderful sauce to get tossed out as I drain off the fat. So good! Thank you for the submission.

This recipe is quick and easy, but honestly it did not have a real teriyaki taste. The sauce had an overwhelming soy sauce taste and while the chicken cooked all of the juices and the extra sauce burned and smoked up the kitchen, so I don’t think I’m going to use this one again.

Perfect and delicious. Place a baking rack over the 9x13 pan to keep the chicken from baking in it's juices, at 425 it gets slightly carmalized and the fat baking out of the thighs keeps the meat tender.

As others have said, I doubled the recipe.  For mine, I put foil in a 9x13 pan and then put about 6 thighs (I made two pans), poured half the sauce over each pan, and cooked for 20min.  After 20 min, I flipped the chicken over and added diced bell pepper, mushrooms, carrot slices, snow peas, pineapple, and fresh green beans to each pan and poured sauce over them.  Continued cooking for an additional 20min.  Turned out fantastic.  Served with rice. and spooned the sauce from the pan over the entire bowl.

Very popular in my house. I doubled the sauce, covered with foil first half hour, used chopped fresh ginger, skin-on thighs (4) and 3 half breasts (boneless, skinless). Breast were cooked after 30 min., became dry, but thighs were very tasty. Lined pan with foil.

Delicious!  The only changes were to use low sodium soy sauce and to replace half the white sugar with brown sugar.  I made the sauce ahead of time to simplify the evening meal preparation.  Following the advice of previous reviewers, I doubled the amount of sauce.  Before basting the chicken, I set aside about 3/4 cup to sparingly drizzle over our rice side dish.

I used bone-in, skin-on thighs and I dipped them in flour and did a quick browning of the skin in the fry pan before following this recipe. Beyond that, I followed it to a tee and it was amazingly good. I will make this again and again.

I made w life soy sauce and doubled the sauce. I kept the sugar amount as is. However, the dish was overwhelmed with chicken grease that we couldn’t enjoy the sauce. When I make it again, I’ll bake chicken in 1/2 the sauce until done, then I will remove chicken from the pan it was baked in and transfer it to a different dish where I will then Add the other half of the sauce to it so the final dish isn’t so greasy.

I used the recipe but only 6 chicken thighs and it turned out perfect! Definitely use aluminum foil! I poured all the sauce over the top from the beginning and just spooned it’s back over about 4 more times while it was cooking.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I have tried this with chicken breasts, bone-in chicken thighs as well as boneless chicken thighs. 

I like it best using boneless chicken thighs, cooked at 400 for 30 minutes. Unfortunately, the chicken breasts came out too dry.

Recipe was really good! I doubled the sauce and used boneless skinless breasts. Cooked covered at 425 for 35min. I just poured the sauce over the split/filleted breasts instead of basting them every ten min. Turned out tasty and it was easy.

Love the recipe! Second time I changed the recipe to accommodate just the two of us with 6 chicken thighs, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup soy sauce and added some pineapple tidbits. The rest of the recipe remained like the original. It's one of my honey's favorite meals!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, and used my Ronco Rotisserie cooker. I basted the chicken every 15 minutes or so and it turned out perfect!

I used boneless skinless breasts cut into strips so there was more surface area to soak in the sauce. The recipe amount of sauce is perfect for 3 breasts IF you put them into a small baking dish. If you spread this out in a big dish it'll smoke and burn because of the high sugar content. I rolled the chicken in toasted sesame oil before pouring on the hot sauce. Also added 2 Tbsp cooking sherry and 1 Tbsp oyster sauce to add depth. And of course fresh ginger and garlic grated on a rasp! (If you don't have one of these you should get one ASAP.) Baked them for 35 minutes at 400°, turning in the sauce halfway through. Served over rice with roasted cabbage wedges and toasted sesame seeds strewn on top. EASY and DELICIOUS!

I've been making this recipe for some time, I'm not big on making alot of changes and then reviewing, I make the recipe and review. Having said that, I confess I did use low sodium soy sauce and I grilled the thighs. FANTASTIC!! I imagine this is good with any meat, not limited to chicken. I think I will double  the recipe and reserve some for the table next time.

Just made this tonight.  Came out pretty good.  I also used half the cream cheese and only one can of soup.  I added onion and garlic to the beef while cooking.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I would make this again.

I love this recipe! I can see so many uses for the sauce. The only change I made as I doubled the recipe was to use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  A 1/4 cup less soy with 1/4c water. Next time, I will make sure the sauce has thickened further in the sauce pan prior to basting chicken.

The sauce was great! I re-adjusted the serving size for 2, and recommend doubling up on the sauce! Only because I love extra sauce. But everything turned out great!

This was good, better than okay, but not delicious.  I used chicken breasts and that could have been why I didn’t think it was five stars.  I doubled the ingredients because I baked 10 chicken breasts and made the chicken in disposable aluminum pans.  I baked them at 375 for 20 minutes and turned them over and baked them for 20 more minutes and rotated the pans as well.  Clean up was easy and the sauce didn’t stick to the disposable pans. Like other reviewers I recommend adding more cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I will make again and use dark meat and if using white meat marinating them before baking or grilling them.

Fabulous recipe!! I thought perfect amount of sauce. I transferred chicken to clean baking dish for last 10 min, tossed on rest of sauce & parsley from my garden...sauce caramelized  a bit...yum! I served with green beans. It looked so pretty.

Delicious recipe. Lined my pan with tin foil sprayed with Pam. I used chicken thighs with bone in and skin on. I took about 50  mins to cook. I did double the sauce and served it with calrose rice and carrots. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!

This is an easy and tasty chicken recipe, the ingredients are  staples in most kitchens.  I used bone in chicken thighs, removing all the visible fat and skin.  I baked them in a medium sized roaster.  Doubled the sauce recipe,  used fresh grated ginger and low sodium soya sauce.  Poured the sauce over the raw chicken, let the oven do the rest of the work!  425F for 30 minutes on each side was perfect.    Served with Stir Fries and Brown Rice.

Great recipe!! I made this with several chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces. I quadrupled that sauce. I used half the sauce initially and baked in foil for 30 minutes. I poured off the cooked sauce as it was runny. I replaced with the remaining sauce. My husband absolutely loved it. It's a keeper!

My whole family loved this recipe!  Even my normally picky husband!  I used breast strips instead of thighs and cut the cooking time to 20 minutes.  Served with rice and veggies!  Delicious!  I will cook this again!

5 stars for the sauce recipe but the cooking time is way too long! Used liquid aminos instead of soy sauce. Will double the sauce and cook for 25 mins next time

The sauce was delicious! Definitely would double the sauce next time especially if you like it thicker. I had to use a lot of cornstarch to thicken it...i marinated the chicken with the sauce before cooking. If you want thicker and sticky  sauce  on the chicken, cook chicken with covered with foil , HOWEVER wait till the very end to coat the sauce on the chicken, and then cook briefly uncovered. If you cover the chicken back, the thicken sauce will become liquid. I cooked the chicken uncovered for too long and it became a bit dry.

These were really salty, so I suggest either using low sodium soy sauce or cutting down the amount.  Also, if you are using boneless thighs, keep an eye on the chicken. I only had mine in for 50 min, and they were a little overcooked.

This is a fabulous easy recipe to prepare. I didn’t change a thing and the flavor of the sauce is one you’d want to use with other meats. I did double the recipe of the sauce and next time I think I would even triple it to have more sauce left over. Cooking time is almost 1/2 of what the recipe calls for when you use skinless, boneless chicken.

I made this recipe and it turned out amazing! My family said it was the best chicken they’ve had! This recipe is super easy and fast. I baked a whole chicken in a cast iron Dutch oven till 3/4 of the way done. Then pulled the pieces of chicken apart and poured the sauce over  it and baked it till done.

This is one of my favorite chicken dishes.  Followed the recipe as written first time and was impressed.  In my spirit of trying to make it my own and working off suggestions from family and friends, I have made the following changes.  Reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup, added 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 cloves minced garlic and 1 tsp fresh minced ginger to help add a bit of a kick.   I usually also double the sauce recipe and whatever isn't used is put into a squeeze condiment bottle and stuck in the fridge (tbh, i love the sauce recipe here just by itself)

So glad I read reviews.  Adjusted the recipe like many suggested.  Doubled the batch of sauce, didn't use as much sugar and what I used was brown sugar.  Used fresh garlic and ginger and used more than suggested.  With all the adjustments it turned out wonderful.  So thankful someone mentioned using aluminum foil.  Probably saved my dish.  The aroma of the sauce burning  onto the aluminum wasn't pleasant, but the taste of the chicken was AMAZING.  Didn't have but 5 large thighs so I used a chicken breast sliced in half for the balance of meat.

For being baked, this was really good. It's easy to make, and I chopped up the chicken before mixing it. Next time I will try to cook most of the chicken before and sautee it with the ingredients to see if it's more moist. Excellent for making stir fry

After nearly ruining my pan with this recipe I have finally conceded-- teriyaki is not for me. The chicken was good but the flavor was nasty so we just peeled off the outside and ate the chicken.

I used grated fresh ginger instead of the ground ginger. It was delicious. Very tender and juicy. The baking pan was a mess, but worth it.

My Husband is he real cook in the house and he made this for us, oh my!  He did say he used less sugar than called for (we all prefer less sweet) and it was yummy!  We will do this again, he said it was really easy to do!

Everything with this recipe was great.  I used fresh ginger for a little more of the ginger flavor in the sauce.  Next time I make this dish, I will be cutting the cooking time down.  1 hour is way too long to bake at the suggested temp.  The chicken was overcooked and dry, and that could be because I only had chicken breasts thawed.  I always try to follow the recipe first then make my changes.  Overall, great recipe.

Notes for myself: Used 3 chicken breasts, doubled sauce, used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, sub'd 1/4 white vinegar. Set oven to 375 degrees. Lined pan with foil, 15 mins, flip, then 15 more mins. Removed some watery sauce, re-covered with remaining sauce reserved on stovetop.

I noticed chicken was chewy and bland, so i sliced it up into strips and put it back in the sauce. Was yummy over white rice, topped with scallions.

(Next time, just cook in the covered skillet, rather than bake.)

Loved it!  I was out of ginger, but it was still delicious.  I covered it in foil and baked for about  45 min.  There was plenty of pan juice to flavor the rice.  We brushed on the reserved teriyaki sauce before serving.

A great recipe for making and taking to pot luck and kids’ school party.  I cut the sugar in half, doubled the garlic.  I used boneless thighs and there is a lot of juice came out, so I added 30 more minutes of baking.

This is a good teriyaki chicken recipe. I would advise as others did to use 3/4 of the amount of sugar and soya sauce that was called for. I also added extra ginger and doubled the sauce recipe. Don't cover it in the oven as others have advised. If you do there will be too many chicken juices which will make the sauce very watery. My husband and I will make this again!

This was very good, I only made 6 chicken thighs, but made the sauce according to recipe.  It was great to have extra sauce. I used some of it to stir into the rice I made and served thighs on top of rice.  I will make again for sure, also a great recipe for company.

OMGosh... my husband wined, I don't like teriyaki, whaaa whaaa whaaa !! I made this recipie "as directed"  & he said, "that was reeeally good honey, but I think I'd like it better on a chicken breast next time" ! He especially loved, loved the " fried rice" I made from this app also. I just about fell on the floor but graciously just 
accepted the compliment. So, I'm safe in saying, "these two are keepers"!

Making this recipe for the third time tonight I just love it so much! I have made a few adjustments and have found the PERFECT cooked chicken! I doubled the recipe for the sauce, and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Lined a 9x9 pan with tinfoil, and dumped the sauce on the chicken, prior to cooking. 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then flip and cook for another 20 minutes. I LOVE the texture it adds to the chicken.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  It was delicious.  We had left over chicken & sauce.  The next night I made vegetable fried rice (Oh ok, I stopped at our favorite Chinese restaurant & bought vegetable fried rice) - put the leftover chicken and the fried rice together with some sauce.  It made for a great meal.

Very tasty, very good. Hubby loved it over rice. Out of powder ginger had to mince a quarter size slice. Had boneless skinless chicken breast and use instead of thighs.

It was very delicious! I am a pretty lazy chef, so I didn't tend to it every 10 minutes. Instead, I put half the sauce on all sides of the chicken (using a spoon because I do not have a brush) and cooked it for 30 minutes. Then I put the second half on and flipped the chicken to cook for another 30 minutes. Worked great and was very delicious!

There was more juice than I expected - I did put foil over it for the first 30 mins maybe that was it. Anyway it needs some more salt and pepper I think to my taste next time I will salt and pepper and garlic the chicken before applying the sauce

This is easy and delicious. Out of pure laziness I followed the tip of another reviewer and just dumped the sauce over the chicken. I also lined my pan because sugar based sauces will get thick and sticky and burn into your dish so again, out of laziness, line with foil. I also used boneless skinless thighs because A) I had them and B) Speed. Cooked all the way through in maybe thirty minutes. Turned them once about 2/3 of the way through. Tender, flavorful, I didn’t mess with the sauce because it’s a pretty standard mix ratio for soy and sugar based sauces. It’s adhered so well to the chicken! Great recipe for school night dinners!

Delicious, but the sauce turns eerily gelatinous when leftovers are stored in the fridge. Would a little less sugar help?

Absolute keeper. I also double the recipe. So easy, I just pour it over my meat. Just turn it while baking. I’v used it on chicken and pork both delicious. With rice or noodles, I put that s*** on everything, it’s so good ??

I made this tonight for my family and it was a total hit. Just enough leftovers for my lunch tomorrow. I used skinless, boneless thighs. I doubled the recipe and instead of using 1 cup sugar, I used 3/4. It was a good adjustment because it was nicely tangy from the Apple cider vinegar. I also used pre-chopped garlic but next time I’m gonna try fresh garlic. This is on the list of favorite recipes.

This is my go-to teriyaki recipe now, I love the flavor and the consistency is just how I like it.  I don't always use chicken thighs, sometimes I like using chicken breasts and cooking them same temp but for 20 minutes and I don't do any re applying of the sauce then. That's a quick way to make it but thighs are better

Tastes amazing! I didn't make any substitutes and it was perfect. There is quite a lot of sugar in it and just for health reasons, I would probably half the amount next time-- I think it wouldn't do much to the taste.

This is close to my aunt's "Japanese Chicken" recipe, for which I use a combo of white and brown sugar and white vinegar, additional water instead of all soya sauce, plus no pre-boiling the sauce and uses all the pieces of a whole chicken. For today I followed this Teriyaki recipe and baked 9 boneless, skinless pieces with the sauce in a casserole dish. I made extra sauce per the reviews, but it wasn't necessary as my baking dish was smaller. I also kept a lid on until near the end, and only baked for about 40 minutes at 400 degrees. Even my picky kids loved it!

First time making this recipe and was very happy with it! Chicken was moist and tender. I went with brown sugar, thanks to all the recommendations. I definitely used aluminum foil on the baking sheet (I doubled the foil) which was a life saver and made for a quick clean up.

Made this tonight for my extremely picky family and it was a hit!!! I know that people get upset when you rate a five but then make changes but the ones I made I stole from other reviews and were really quite minor so I think it still deserves a 5! I changed temp to 375, used half brown sugar and half white, I lined dish w aluminum foil and then covered as well, also used low sodium soy sauce as others mentioned. It was so good served over rice! My kids even ate it and I can rarely get them to eat meats!

I must admit I made two changes to the recipe- I used brown sugar, not white, and I seared boneless skinless breasts in the skillet, then made the sauce and threw the chicken back in. I didn't read the recipe close enough and didn't see to add water and less soy if you were using full sodium soy- so next time I will be sure to do that. Overall this was incredible- very easy, family loved it. I definitely want to try the baking method this recommends. Also I will add chopped green onions for garnish.

I used a half of cup of sugar and had to water the recipe down because the sauce was a little too tangy for me, but it turned out delicious.

It turned out amazing!  I made some minor tweaks like adding sesame seeds, substituted Honey for sugar and used fresh grated ginger and added orange juice and canola oil and a little crushed red pepper for some heat.  I served it with steamed veggies. Very versatile, I want to try this with salmon.

I made this following the sauce recipe but instead of thighs I used thinly sliced, boneless, skinless chicken breasts.
Oven set at 350, cooking for 20 minutes, turning them over halfway through the process.
9 out of 10, would make again.

What a great recipe! It was not only pretty simple to make but also delicious. I didn't change anything expect decrease the amounts since I was only making three large thighs as opposed to the twelve the recipe calls for. I made white rice and buttered peas as side dishes. I will definitely be making this one again!

This was delicious! Only used four chicken thighs since it is just my husband and I. Kept the amount of sauce the same.Put half on chicken & baked 30 mins then added remainder & baked 15 mins. Served over brown basmati rice. Sauce was so good, I plan to double it next time. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Delicious. I didn't change a thing other than that I made this in the Crock Pot. I skipped the first step and instead mixed everything together in a bowl and then poured it over 4 boneless chicken breasts (frozen) in a slow cooker. I cooked it on low for about 6 hours, then shredded it and served it over rice. Great!

I’ll definitely keep this recipe. My family loved it! I would recommend to double the teriyaki sauce as it makes chicken very soft and juicy.

It was great. The only change is, once it was done, I broiled it for 5 mins on high to get it extra sticky.

This recipe is a staple in our house! I make  the recipe as is and my kids and husband devour it every time. I don’t double the recipe, I baste before they go in, and baste every 10-15 mins after and turns out delish ! I serve with a garden salad and fried rice!

I loved making the sauce instead of buying premade teriyaki. The taste was great but I also used a little sesame oil, fresh ginger instead of ground dried & added some green onion to the sauce while it cooked. Also, I use daily 3 breasts fileted.

This really is an amazing recipe. I ended up having to make more sauce I the middle so doubling (at least) the sauce recipe is a good idea. Otherwise made it true to the recipe. SO good! Beautiful color and texture. A bit labor intensive with all the basting but absolutely worth it! My husband hurt himself because he ate so much. Thanks so much!!

It was fabulous. I used boneless breasts of chicken and I cut them in large pieces. I used 3 large breasts for two. I used low sodium soy sauce. The sauce was excellent but I agree - double the recipe.

This was ok. Not great. A lot of work to brush chicken every ten minutes. The five other recipies I made here turned out to be 5 Stars. I wasn't going to make this again however, I read other reviews. One person said it turned out great in a slow cooker. I'm going to try that and low sodium sauce. Unless that turns out better, I am not using this one again.

This has become a family favorite - even my picky son likes it! The only thing I do different is baking it right in the sauce, as suggested from other reviews.

DELICIOUS! And I’m not a huge teriyaki fan! I had boneless skinless breasts and needed something quick and easy. I had no idea homemade teriyaki sauce was so easy or so yummy. I doubled the sauce, followed suggestions to cut sugar just a little (I think I used 1/2-ish cup brown and 1/4 white), and cut the chicken breasts up in strips. Baked at 375 for 35 minutes. Tender delicious and devoured by the family!

It's a little sweeter than I prefer. I left out the green onions because I've found they don't always reheat well.

I followed the recipe but used only 4 bone-in skinless thighs so if I made more pieces, I'd increase the sauce. Wish it was thicker. Lined the dish with heavy duty foil, covered and baked 30 min, then uncovered, poured more sauce and finished baking, as per another review. Everyone liked it. Wished I'd served it with rice though. Next time.

I love this recipe!  I have made it several times now each and every time it is exceptional.  I did not have any garlic on hand the first time I made it and it was so delicious I have just made it the same way each time.  I actually make extra so the husband can bring leftovers for lunch!  I serve with jasmine rice and it is the perfect combination.  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!

Although the sauce wasn't quite as thick as I expected it would be, this dish was really good! Super simple directions and ingredients, and didn't take a long time to prepare! I made no changes, but may substitute the white sugar with brown for better depth of flavor next time!

I used chicken breasts, and I think it would be better with thighs as there isn't enough fat in the breasts to keep them moist.  Great sauce!

Although I made a few changes, I used the basic recipe.  I didn't like the idea of all that sugar in it, so I used orange juice.  Cut the soy sauce in half and didn't use the cornstarch at all.  I doubled the recipe so I would have sauce to spoon over rice.  Definitely going to be a recipe staple.

Okay, I never do reviews on recipes (or even to remember to save them) but this was delicious. My 1 year old ate until we got tired of sitting at the table, and then licked his fingers and stuffed the piece in his mouth he found in his bib. My husband claimed it's the best teriyaki chicken he's ever had. Subbed rice vinegar for the acv because that's what we had, & used the full amount of sauce for half the chicken. I flipped it after 20 minutes so I could start basting it every 10 and pulled it out after about 40-50 minutes once temp was right (>165F). The sauce was thick and thickened even more as it cooked, which made it stick really well & kept the chicken juicy. Way easier than I expected, and so good!

My family really enjoyed this.  I did double the sauce and used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I thought the sauce was going to be too sweet and salty after taste testing before adding it to the chicken but once it baked on the chicken, the ratio was just right. I made jasmine rice on the side and found myself drizzling sauce over it as well!!

I made it as written.  My husband and I loved it.  One nice thing about this recipe is you can flex either the Ginger, Cider Vinegar or Sugar to get the flavor that fits your pallett.  For example, the second time I made this I wanted it to be slightly less sweet and more vinegar so I dialed the sugar back from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup and left the vinegar as is.  It was perfect. 

I also tried, the second time I made it, tenderizing the chicken using a tenderizing tool while my sauce was heating and that worked nicely.  At 425 degrees my cooking time was 10 minutes per side and thus a total of 20 minutes - less than what the recipe calls for as is.

Finally, Trader Joe's sells a wonderful low sodium soy sauce that I use to keep the sodium in check.  It's a wonderful flavor I prefer over the Kikkoman low sodium soy sauce.  (I have no affliation with Trader Joe's, Kikkoman or whoever the supplier is that makes this product.  I just enjoy the Trader Joe's product for this dish.)

I did this recipe for a school project and it was easy, fun, and everyone loved it! I had to leave out the ginger, unfortunately, but the result was still amazing and I'll definitely be making this recipe for my family again. The only problem I had was the chicken coming out dry and the sauce in the pan with the chicken coming out burnt, but that was purely my fault and I'd definitely recommend to any people who need a recipe that they can let bake while they make the rest of the meal.

I make this recipe alot in my home. Its a family favorite. This recipe is very good with the chicken thighs because it turns out very juicy, however my husband and children prefer chicken breasts instead. I do make 1 other change to this recipe and that is that i double the sauce because when the chicken cooks in the sauce it turns out pretty watery so i save the other batch of sauce for the end. Turns out amazing everytime!

Definitely would make again but used half the amount of sugar.   Also, chicken should have an internal temperature of 165 degrees.   Boneless thighs only take about 25 minutes to reach that.

Wow, really good! I made a few changes to this recipe. I had 6 small thighs. First I used 1 1/2 Tbls of corn starch because I wanted a sauce that will stick to the chicken. It took a while to thicken, so be patient! I used  1/4 c. of brown sugar and 1/4 of white sugar.  I preheated the oven at 400. I did not cover the thighs with aluminum foil. . I cooked one side for 25 minutes. Then after brushing the sauce on the other side, I reduced the oven to 375 and cooked for another 20 minutes. Delish! Thank you!

Made it a few times, it’s my husband and I’s favorite recipe for chicken. We swapped brown sugar for the white sugar, add a lot more garlic (honestly it might be 3-5 tablespoons depending on the day we make it), and we added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of smoked paprika. Also tried mixing sriracha into it and that worked too.

Simple, easy & good....works for me.  Unusual for me, I made no changes and had a little sauce left over which kind of surprised me based on others comments.  I will for sure make it again and will likely try it with pork loin instead of chicken thighs.  Should work but will have to reduce the cooking time.

Great sauce, although I did use low sodium soy sauce and I cut the chicken into strips putting them on skewers with pineapple  chunks and green peppers. I then put the skewers on Jasmine rice which I then drizzled with more sauce on the top! Delicious!!!

The absolute best! I use the sauce recipe for everything. I just go a little heavier on the ginger- 3/4 tsp. But stay with 1/4 cup of vinegar. It’s ready when the rice is done and the protein is cooked. 20 minutes. Great for a weeknight meal!!!!

So easy and delicious! I substituted rice vinegar for the cider vinegar because it's what I had on hand but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Served it over white rice with a side of broccoli and my family didn't even leave me leftovers for lunch today. Even my boyfriend who usually puts hot sauce on everything ate it just as is and loved it!

I'm in LOVE with this recipe! Doubled it because I wanted to have some leftover. I have teens and a toddler who are picky so I used chicken breasts cut up in bite sized pieces and let those suckers swim in the sauce in the oven at 375° for 30 minutes. My husband says there can never be enough garlic so added a tad more for him. I had some honey that had crystallized and I didn't throw it away yet so thought, what the heck and squeezed about 3/4 cup in there with a little less brown and white sugar.  Served with rice and veggies and edamame. I'm not ashamed. I licked my plate. Thank you for such a great family meal! YUMMMMMM! For those of you who don't like to scrub that dish, let it soak right away in some soapy water, sit down and have a glass of wine, relax, and it will rinse out just fine!

We loved this recipe! It was very tender and juicy. I used boneless chicken breasts. I put foil on top for first 15 minutes and then turned the chicken and took foil off, basting every 10 minutes after flipping. I reserved teriyaki sauce and tossed in remaining sauce before serving. Delicious!

Took it out 20 minutes early and it was already dry as a bone. Every bit of liquid had come out of the chicken and carbonized on the pan. Cut the cooking time WAY down if you want to attempt this

This was delicious but I did something different. I seared the chicken thighs first in a cast iron skillet. My husband loves the skin and for it to be crispy. So when I baked it, the  skin sat above the sauce and remained crisp, and they loved it!

I really like the teriyaki chicken recipe. A couple of suggestions is to double the batch, so you can use the other half for a sauce if you are putting over rice. Also to make the sauce and marinade the chicken in it (for about day).

Like other have said, I would make double the sauce that the recipe calls for. I only used six (6) chicken thighs and used what the recipe called for and it was perfect. But if you're making the full 12, definitely double the sauce.

The glaze did not turn out like pictured, as it was runny.  I wonder if the whole dish was broiled at the end in the picture?

Pretty easy chicken recipe. I cooked it with the sauce as opposed to basting it. Served on rice cooked in chicken stock with porcini mushrooms.

I’ve made this recipe a few times, first the way it was written which turned out delicious. My only gripe was that the leftover sauce gelatinized and couldn’t be reused. I tried everything to resurrect it, but to no avail. The second time I dumped all of the ingredients into a ziplock bag and threw in chicken. I let everything marinate for about five hours and then put the chicken onto the BBQ. It turned out beautifully. The flavors were still there, along with the dark color and crusty outside. It saved me some dishes too.

My husband & sons favorite chicken dish by far!   Great easy recipe.   I use boneless chicken thighs most of the time (just for ease of eating) and only takes about 30 mins to bake.  Great recipe!

Unfortunately I was disappointed by this recipe. I thought it lacked flavor. I used chicken strips rather than thighs so maybe that had something to do with it.  I think I will try some other recipes before making this again.

I made the sauce and poured it over B/S Chicken Breasts.  Then I covered with foil and baked.  Half way through I turned the breasts over and uncovered.   Turned out delicious.  Super easy!

I used light soy, added 4 oz of orange juice and orange zest. I recommend covering for the first 30 min with plastic and foil then uncover, turn them, baste with remaining sauce, and then finish cooking.

Amazing teriyaki sauce!  Just as good as a bottle but with more kick!  I substituted tapioca starch for the cornstarch as hubs is Type O and cannot have corn products.  Perfect! He loved it and so do I.  It was super simple to make.

This has become one of my family’s favorite chicken recioes. Made sauce exactly as written. Put the chicken thighs in a 9x13 dish lined with aluminum foil. Poured marinade over chicken and put in frig for an hour. Baked at 375 for 45 minutes. Served with rice and steamed broccoli. Yum!

Great recipe! Definite keeper. Only change I made was I grilled the chicken on a very hot  indoor grill pan for  one minute per side to give a little char.  Then I cooked in the   oven as directed. Basting frequently in key. Also when you make the sauce, set some aside  (that hasn't touched the raw chicken) to serve  with the rice once finished.

Instead of 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1 garlic clove, i doubled them up because we love those flavours. And instead of wrapping them up or putting them on a tray, I let the chicken dripping off all its fat and baked them for 7 minutes first time, brushed more sauce on and turned them, then baked them for another 10 minutes.

This is a keeper ! Easy and quick. I used honey in place of sugar and liquid aminos in place of soy sauce. Then is shredded red cabbage and sauteed with onions and served chicken over this and poured extra sauce into cabbage. Only thing missing was a egg role. And I did reduce the temp to 350 to start and increased it for last 20 min. Next time I might start out at 425 and then reduce it. My total cooking time was about 40 min with bone in thighs.

REally delicious. My husband said it was the best teriyaki he had ever had. This way you dont have a pre-packaged sauce that has preservatives. Sodium benzoate triggers my migraines.

Quite good and easy to prepare/cook.  I did add some chili & garlic sauce to kick it up a tad.  And to make things go faster, instead of brushing the sauce on each side of the chicken, I just rolled each piece in the sauce and placed them on a baking rack.  Thus, I didn't have to turn them over as the recipe instructed.

I was worried that it might be a little too salty, but it seemed just right.
My mom liked the teriyaki sauce so much she wanted me to fix it again with pork chops. We'll see how they turn out.

This was really good. Specially with fresh ginger instead of powder. I did add just a little less sugar as others suggested and it was plenty sweet. Just had five boneless, skinless thighs and the sauce was plenty to sumerge them. My super picky 10-year old asked for seconds.

I cut the sugar in half and substitued Stevia. I also didn't flip the chicken, nor did I marinate the other side at all. I added Green Onion.  

Best recipe of this I've had. Goes absolutley perfect with the Autumn Apple Salad II.

This dish was very good.  I used chicken breasts and baked 400 for 35 min.  I also doubled the sauce as other people suggested. which was good. I had some extra to pour over rice that I made with it.   I used fresh ginger and garlic since I had some.  Very good, I would make it again. perhaps  a little less vinegar next time.  It was a little sour to my liking .

Very tasty especially with fresh garlic and ginger.  I did use low sodium soy sauce which was a great modification.
The thighs did not brown up on top even though I baked it  uncovered.  I did not  try  broiling for fear it would dry it out.

We loved this. I made it with half chicken breasts and cut them into nugget sized pieces. I cooked them in the sauce and covered with tin foil. I cooked them at 300 for about 25 minutes and then took the tin foil off for another 5 minutes. It was so tender!!

This glaze/sauce is delicious! I used it on chicken breasts instead of thighs. I added a tablespoon of local honey to the sauce recipe. I also added fresh basil. I think I will use less sugar next time.

I made this dish following the directions to a T.  The second time I made it my daughter suggested I shred the chicken, and so I did and the sauce and flavor soaked in beautifully.  Next time I make this dish I will garnish with green onions.

My husband and I agreed that this was better than the teriyaki chicken at a chain restaurant we go to. I didn’t change a thing about the sauce recipe and it was great. For sides I cooked up some vegetables I needed to use up, and I cooked a pack of ramen noodles but threw the salty flavor pack away and stirred in some of the sauce from this recipe instead. Easy peasy and all home made. I’ve made this several times now and it comes out good every time.

This was incredible, used half the sauce to cook the chicken in the crock pot and left the rest for the rice and vegetables. Added lots of extra garlic, half tamari and half soy sauce low sodium I also put a dab of molasses in it.

Ed says this sauce is better than bottled teriyaki. I used four chicken breasts cooked for 30 minutes at 425. Served over white rice with peas mixed in.

This was really good. Everybody loved it. I didn’t have ginger, but it was yummy. This is a cheap dinner to make, since I have most ingredients and thighs are cheap. Definitely will make again!

Yummy! The sauce wasn’t too salty and it thickened to a nice consistency. The ingredients are not hard to come by and it  was easy-peasy!  I saved some sauce to pour on top and that was amazing. I chopped my chicken into smaller pieces and only cooked it for 10 minutes after turning it. I might cut down the first sides’ cooking time just a hair next time. We will make it again!

Delicious sauce that tastes like it came from a restaurant. I took others' advice and doubled it. I also added more ginger and garlic than it called for because my family likes a lot of flavor. Will be making again! Thanks for a great recipe. I only gave it 4 stars because the sauce in the recipe isn't enough for 12 chicken thighs. If it only called for 6 thighs, I'd have given it 5 stars.

Definitely will try it again.  I used chicken breast instead of thighs... came out watery than I expected.  Therefore, did not char enough and the sugar did not have a chance to transform its sweetness.  I'll pat the chicken dry and put it on a rack next time.  Note:  My bad for using more ginger than directed.  Hence, it was slightly pronounced.  I think if you follow the measurements, the teriyaki taste will be more balanced.

Used the sauce,  but made this in the slow cooker. Put chicken thighs and sauce in cooker, then cooked on high for 4 hours. Then added pineapple chunks, bell pepper, celery and carrots and cooked for about 45 minutes more. Served over rice with an Asian slaw for dinner. We loved it! BTW doubled the sauce, so we had plenty for the rice. The chicken was fall off the bone tender with great flavor. Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely make again.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I always keep the ingredients in the cabinet because I know that it's a great staple, even if you only have chicken breast.

The way the recipe is without adjustments isn’t the greatest. The flavors are “flat”. I highly recommend adding double the sauce and use fresh ingredients.

I would make this again. It was really delicious. It wasn't very sweet but the sauce still tasted great. Takes a lot of effort to make though. The only reason why I'm only giving it 4 stars. It's delicious but you cant' really multi-task because every 10 minutes, you have to put more sauce on.

I had 8th grade students make this as written. It turned out amazing! We served it with Fried Rice Restaurant Style. I normally don’t like dark meat chicken, but the boneless thighs were delicious! I’m making this recipe this evening, and lined the pan with aluminum foil.

Delicious!  I used chicken breasts and cut them into chunks so it would cook faster.  Done in 20 minutes with a convection oven at 425 (lucky me!).  I paired this with Carrot Rice (recipe on here) and it was a lovely dinner and leftover lunch.  Careful when baking - the sugary sauce will burn up around the chicken, but if you flip chicken and add more sauce every 10 minutes, you can keep it under control.

My family enjoyed it, but it made me realize I don't really like teriyaki - ha! Also, sauce was pretty watery after baking and not the honey-like consistency it appears in a lot of the photos.

This was delicious! I gave 4 stars only because I made minor changes.  I kept the skin on the thighs, used red pepper flakes instead of black pepper, doubled the sauce and added some scallions to the sauce (had a few that I wanted to use up).  I also lowered the heat to 350 after about 15 minutes as the sauce was starting to dry out and burn.

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I may have not let the sauce thicken up enough however, because it didn't really "stick" to the chicken like I wanted it too. And I only had chicken breasts to work with. So next time I will try it with the chicken thighs and have a bit more patience with the sauce. Other than that, Thank You for sharing this, it is well worth trying it again.

Simple recipe with minimal ingredients yet astounding taste! Next time I will add a second round of the sauce about 15 minutes to the chicken being fully cooked.

This is an amazing recipe. I didn’t change it. I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly. I served it with rice and stir fried vegetables. Great meal! I would use less sugar next time.

I  used chicken beasts  instead of thighs.  I found 425 degree oven way too high.  Reduced it to 375 half way through.   Will definitely make this again.

I doubled the recipe but next time will most likely not double the ginger! It made it pretty spicy-hot. My hubby loves this dish. It will be a definite repeat at our house

Fantastic easy recipe.  I used bottled Teriyaki and it was even faster.  Served with rice and a steamed veggie, this is our easiest weeknight meal.

We will make it again. Our complaint-marinade didn't saturate the meat thoroughly, leaving most of the meat bland. Even after doubling the sauce. The recipe has a nice flavor, but we will add additional spices next, too. Overall, it was a nice recipe that we will occasionally revisit.

A very simple and easy recipe. Very tasty, a real croud (family) pleaser. 
This will definitely be on the  short list when it comes to kids choice for dinner.

I swapped out half the sugar for slightly packed brown sugar. And I baked for 15 mins at 375 and then about 30 mins on 350 with two large, pounded out breasts. I was surprised they took that long but they were cooked perfectly and the chicken was so tender.

It was a good teriyaki, but I think I prefer a sweeter, thicker sauce. Will make it again, but will use less vinegar more sugar and more starch and see how that comes out.

Delicious!  Put in the crock pot with double the sauce.  The sauce was a bit thin because of the crock pot, so added a bit of corn starch and cooked without the lid for a few minutes.  Served with rice and roasted veggies.

Really really liked the sauce, but I used boneless skinless chicken instead, and the chicken was a little dry for my taste.  I think if I’d used the wings instead, the skin and bones would have made the meat juicier.  But the sauce is delicious!!!!

I used honey instead of sugar. I used half the chicken thighs and the full sauce recipe with about 1/3 cup of honey. It was so delicious. Definately adding into the dinner rotation.

I had to add a little extra cornstarch and water to get the right consistency. Used chicken thighs with the skin on. Started with skin down for 20 min then flipped it skin side up, added more sauce and cooked another 30 min. The last 10 min I broiled it until it browned slightly. Very good.

I read the reviews and then decided to make it as the recipe was stated. So glad that I did.  It was great.  The sauce was delicious and it was very satisfying if your looking for a quick Chinese food dish. Best of all, thinking ahead, I could easily prep this and have in a pan for my husband to cook during the week night rush!

I curt the recipe down to 1/3 because I didn't need 12 servings. I also used boneless, skinless thighs because that is what I had on hand.  It turned out great!  I cooked the thighs in the oven, basting  and turning them every 10 minutes. When they were almost done, i removed them from the pan and poured the liquid in the pan into the pan I used to make the sauce and boiled it for a few minutes to thicken it up a bit.  I returned the chicken to the baking pan and dumped the thickened sauce over the thighs and popped it back into the oven for the last 10 minutes.  I toasted  hamburger buns and served these as a sandwich.  They would have been great with some rice.  I think this recipe would be good also if you  added some pineapple, green pepper and onion to the sauce, cut the chicken in bite-sized pieces and baked it in the oven and served it over rice.  I am going to try that next time! Great recipe!

Good, a little sweet. I added smoked paprika to the sauce, as well as hot sauce to give it a kick. Also, seasoned my chicken with some black pepper and other spices after flipping it and then coated everything in the sauce once again.

The sauce came out good. The meat didn't have too much flavor by itself, but,when dipped in additional sauce, it was very good!  The chicken was very tender .  My husband and I both liked it.

Super easy to make and a great sauce for Teriyaki! I let the sauce simmer a little longer to get it to thicken more, resulting in a perfect balance of sweet to tangy. I used 6 boneless/skinless chicken thighs and baked for less time called for in the recipe (about 25-30 minutes at 425 F, basting every 10 minutes and flipped after about 15 minutes).  I did not scale down the recipe and made the sauce as written, which means I technically doubled the amount of sauce. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because some of the sauce burned horribly and set off my smoke detectors. We still had some sauce left, but would have liked more. I'll make this again for the sauce alone, but in my wok as a stir fry instead of oven baked. Again, super easy recipe to make and will be a repeat here! Thanks for sharing the recipe! The sauce is very good!

I pan fried the skin on bone in chicken thighs first to get some color. Then it only took 30 minutes in the oven at 400 degrees... came out excellent!!

I made this exactly as stated however I did double the sauce per previous suggestions but I didn't use it so not sure that was necessary.  My whole family loved it! I sauteed some snow peas, water chestnuts and carrots as well and served over steamed rice.  It was a hit. Will definitely make again.

A winner at my house! Very tasty. Used  6 large boneless skinless thighs, baked in a smaller dish and placed close together at 425 degrees. Added sauce once every 15 min. Did not dry out. Served with Hawaiian coleslaw.

I'm sure this is a 5 star recipe as is... but I use chicken breast so I don't  use this cooking method... I just pound the chicken thin and pan sear until almost cooked... I put the sauce on the cooked chicken and bake for 15 to 20 minutes... The sauce is awesome... but I do add more cornstarch because I like a thicker consistency... Thank you for sharing this recipe..

I was looking forward to make it but it turned out to be dry.  I followed the instruction exactly.  I think baking it with the skin on would be better/juicier.  The flavor though was very delicious.

Fantastic sauce. Kids loved it want it made often. If you use thigh meat, as the recipe suggests, you won't have worry about the meat drying out, since it is naturally more moist than breast meat. No need to cover with foil.

I have not made this yet. From the viewpoint of a parent, make sure you do not dip the finished product in the same sauce you’ve been basting the chicken with all day. That brush you use brushing the raw meat could transfer salmonella to the sauce. You’re looking to Make people very sick that way.

Excellent recipe! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, cooked for 35 mins at 400. I covered the pan with foil for the first 25 mins and cooked it without foil until it was done. The chicken stayed really juicy. Double the sauce so there’s extra for dipping!

Really good, but felt the flavor was missing a bit. Added  an Asian Chile sauce at the end and it was much more flavor forward as the spice brought all the flavors together.  Chicken was super tender and recipe very easy.  Used boneless, skinless thighs so cut the cooking time to 30 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered but could have shortened that even more. Served with risotto.

I just got through eating this dish!  It was very good!  I really did like this Teriyaki Sauce better than the one I used to make.  I did cover the chicken for 30 minutes then removed the foil, turned the chicken, added more teriyaki, and cooked another 20 minutes.  I made up some rice with peas and onions in it.  DEEElicious meal!  Thank you very much for sharing it!

I had seen a video on FB of four different teriyaki bowls and couldn't find it for the life of me.  So I turned to my reliable friend (the reviews on AllRecipe) and found this one.  It was very easy to make, had great flavor, and I love that I could have this baking while I made the fried rice.  I used what I had on hand, so instead of soy sauce, I used teriyaki sauce... I had chicken thighs not breasts, but everything else was the same.  The flavor was fantastic, just right as far as sweet/salty goes.  The bake time for me was less, I cut mine into smaller pieces so we wouldn't have to cut it later, and they turned out great.  I was asked by my husband to make this a "keeper" recipe so in the recipe book it goes.  Thanks!

I made this  recipe following the directions as written except I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts since I did not have chicken thighs.  i baked at 425 degrees and adjusted the timing to 30 minutes.  The result was an incredible, flavorful  dinner. I served it with yellow rice and green beans.  The teriyaki sauce was superb over the rice.  I will make this for a company.  Thanks for sharing!

Love love love this recipe!!! Doubled sauce, added brown sugar and lined the pan with foil and baked at 350°F . My husband was a little leery because of the soy sauce, but he went back for seconds! Definitely a keeper!!!

For diabetic and allergies I changed the sugar to Splenda.  I changed the soy sauce to coconut aminos.   Changed garlic to 1 tsp chopped.  So it’s diabetic and FODMAP friendly with the garlic since it doesn’t bother me.

My kids and husband loved this recipe!  I used six boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 2" pieces and put into a glass baking dish.  I then poured the sauce over the chicken and baked at 425 degrees for only 25 minutes (that's a really high temp for chicken).  Then served it over white rice with mixed veggies and egg rolls and we had a hit!  The sauce was soooo delicious!

Way too salty as is. I'll def try lite soy sauce next time. I used chicken breast. I bet it does taste better with thighs and brown sugar. Also going to put it in the crock pot next time.

Recipe was good I did make a few changes I kept the chicken covered for the first half of cooking about 30 minutes I flipped all the pieces of chicken over and removed the aluminum foil uncovered it and baked it another 30 minutes I took the teriyaki sauce that was in the bottom of the baking dish when done and boiled on the stove till it was the thickness that I would like about 5-10 min and I broiled the chicken in the oven about five min I used low-sodium soy sauce and I added honey to the recipe it turned out wonderfully

Made it three times so far!  Do a large batch then freeze leftovers for later meals.  Suggest you double the amount of sauce you make so you can baste the chicken better again after you have turned it over halfway through cooking.

Review for sauce  only - tasty over stirfry with tofu, bell pepper, broccoli and pineapple with rice. Will make again. Think next time I would use fresh ginger for more kick.

My family loved this recipe. A couple of tips- between making the sauce and stopping to baste every 10 minutes, this will take at least an hour to cook. Definitely not a dish if you are in a hurry!  I may cook the chicken for a few minutes and drain before basting to rid the dish of juices next time we have this.

I thought this was good. I made no changes to the sauce. It was sweet and tangy and salty all at the same time, if that makes sense. I would make it again with a little less sugar and reduced sodium soy sauce for a more mild flavor. I could see using the thickened sauce itself for dipping chicken strips into or for a stir fry. I would imagine it would be good with salmon as well. It was simple and quick to put together. Just a little too sweet but I can make adjustments next time.

The good reviews were right... this was awesome!! I did take other cooks’ advice here and doubled my portions. I didn’t double the sugar or the soy, but close enough. Used brown sugar, fresh ginger, fresh garlic. This sauce was absolutely amazing and better than any teriyaki I’ve ever tasted in a restaurant. Best thing about it - is you probably already have all the ingredients at home anyway, so get cookin’! :-)

This recipe is excellent enough to replace store bought sauces. Followed exactly  and will cut bake time to allow at least 3 minutes per side to broil to give that extra charred appearance. Over all very good Teriyaki Sauce and will adjust where needed  on what I see can be used on a wide array  of meals, cant wait! Amend: Summertime marinade (24 hr) for chicken sandwiches from the grill ..... best Chicken Sandwiches!

I found it to be slightly salty so I ended up using Apple Cider Vinegar and also added 2 tbsp of fresh orange juice. Was the perfectly sweet/salty. Served it with fresh steamed vegetables and white rice. My family now said this is one of their favorite meals now and the kids even asked for seconds which is rare in my house. If I could give more then 5 stars I would. Defiantly will make this again per request of the family

This was great. I did make a few changes, instead of ginger I used a mixture of nutmeg and cinnamon. Covered in foil for a hour and baked on 350, then removed foil and baked at 450 till done and wonderfully colored.

I'll definitely make this again. I used two big boneless skinless chicken breasts, and followed the recipe exactly for the sauce. For that amount of chicken, the amount of sauce was perfect for us. I served it with rice and mixed veggies, and everybody enjoyed it.

Excellent. Followed recipe as written. The high oven temp of 425 caramelized the sugar in the sauce and gave the thighs an almost slightly barbecued char. Totally delicious. Will definitely make again with one change. Will use fresh ginger next time instead of powdered. Like some others, I recommend lining baking pan with foil for ease of cleanup.

Used chicken breast since that is what we had on hand.  Quick and easy recipe with things I have in the pantry but it just wasn't amazing for us.  Asian flavor but I wouldn't really call it Teriyaki.

SO YUMMY! I made a couple changes. I doubled the sauce, I laid boneless chicken breasts in a baking dish and covered them in the sauce, I baked them on 400 for about 40 minutes. Served with rice it was AMAZING! We will be doing this again! This sauce would be great on stir fry as well!

It was ok, but much too sweet.  I think I’d up the garlic ginger and reduce the sugar

Easy and yummy! Also, because the recipe is so simple it's makes room for you to change it up or ad other things you like.

Love this recipe, this is my go-to for delicious family dinners. Reviews say to double the recipe, I don't. I do double the garlic and let the sauce simmer for a couple of minutes until it is thick and gooey. The amount of sauce left in the roasting pan is easily enough to use as a sauce for rice or potatoes as a side dish.

Not bad, I agree with the other reviewers that you should double the sauce and it is indeed very salty so the low sodium soy sauce may be better. I used agave instead of sugar and it still turned out good. Nice quick recipe for weeknight dinners.

This is amazing!!  It was so good!  Even my picky child loved it and all of them requested it again.  I made three minor changes.  I used 4 huge, boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut in halves.  I also left out the ground ginger because I didn't have any.   And I used brown sugar instead of white.   I look forward to making it again with the ginger.

This is so, SO delicious!! I served it over some salty, buttery rice that I made with peas. I just read other reviews that said they lowered the temp. That would probably have worked too, since I used boneless thighs. I'll try 375° next time. Overall this is a winner!

Tried this dish for my son this evening! He really liked it....even said that he preferred it to the crockpot version...he loved the stickiness of the sauce. Served it over some stir fried noodles with egg....definitely a winner! I used some fresh grated ginger...grated on the very small side of the grater....thinking of using a similar sauce like this on salmon.....the sauce may have to be a tad thinner...I'll experiment and see.

We added in some pineapple juice and followed everyone's suggestion of 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar. Next time, we're going to try using a low sodium soy sauce as it was a bit salty still for us. Otherwise, everyone loved it!

Great recipe.  Made sauce as directed, but used boneless, skinless thighs. Also used lite soy sauce as that is always what I use. Cooked chicken, uncovered for 30 minutes, basting every 10 minutes as directed. Delicious and easy to make. Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

Delicious! The whole family agreed. Followed the recipe as written other than using half brown sugar and half turbinado. Baked uncovered at 400 for 30 minutes each side. The boneless, skinless thighs were falling apart tender. Doubled the teriyaki and used it all, basting as the recipe instructed. Served with stir fry veggies and rice. Will definitely be making again!

Wow, I am a complete novice in the kitchen but this recipe absolutely made me look like a pro.  I took the advice of others and doubled the recipe while using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I also used shallots instead of garlic and light soy sauce.  All of the chicken meat was de-boned and all skin and fat removed which allowed me to fully marinate the meat for a few hours before putting it in the oven.  Served over brown rice with crisp green beans this turned out amazing.

Made recipe with no modifications. Used tin foil to cover while baking. Gets two thumbs up from SD&HTS (single dad and hungry teenage son).  Chicken was moist and tender. “Look Dad, the meat just falls right off the bone!  This is my favorite meal on the website.”

Awesome!!! Only changes were that I doubled the sauce, used boneless breasts (left them thick and unpounded out), lower sodium soy, 1/2 brown sugar/1/2 sugar in the raw and cooked uncovered at 425 for 30 and 400 for 20 basting every 15 minutes, reserved half the sauce for mid-way through  the cooking and a quarter for the last 15 minutes. Served with brown rice that I sautéed with a little bit of the reserved sauce, Asian salad and a veggie. MY FAMILY ABSOULTELY LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!!

I have made this recipe about 15 Times. It’s a very easy, fast week night meal that my family loves. I don’t even bother removing the skin on the thighs. Just crisp it up with broil on the oven for about 3 minutes and it’s not rubbery.

I made this for my family for dinner last night and it was a hit!   Not only was it simple to make but absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe was written except with gluten free soy sauce as my children have celiac disease.  It was AMAZING.  Thank you Marian.

I doubled the amount of the sauce. I love using the extra drippings over rice! And if I have extra rice I make delicious eggnog flavored rice pudding from allrecipes.com

So I made the sauce exactly as it said. I however used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I cut them in three as they were so big.  Then I baked it but not at the high temp it called for because my family was going to be late for dinner.  I poured all the sauce on the chicken then I rotated them to cover them well and did so about 2-3 more times while cooking.  There was lots of sauce in the end.  I poured a little over my steamed veggies near the end of the meal.  Next time I plan to use the sauce and turn it into a sort of stir fry.  The sauce was very good.  Guess I didn't give it 5 stars because I used the breast.  I think legs or wings would be better and cooked at a high temp. I am not partial to thighs. Too much fat.  Reading other reviews I can not imagine why anyone would think the sauce needs MORE sugar.  There was also more then enough sauce to cover 4 VERY large frozen chicken breasts I buy at Sams Club in those large bags. Those breasts are HUGE.  Just saying and the sauce was more then enough.

Loved the sauce.  I doubled everything, except the sugar (used 3/4 cups brown sugar), and I have plenty for about 15 boneless skinless thighs.  Cooked at 400 for about 35 min, it was just a titch too long.  Served over rice and the sauce made everything delicious.  Easy to make.  Will try next time with chicken breasts or tenders.

I already made this twice! Delicious recipe. Doubled the sauce , used low sodium soy sauce, and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I also baked it at 350-375. Made stir fry veggies and pineapple chunks and served all over rice!! Everyone loved it!

Delicious- after reading the reviews I doubled the sauce but found it wasn’t necessary, cooked with foil on for first 30 minutes then without.

INCREDIBLE ... Big hit with the whole family.  I made the sauce and put it over boneless pork chops instead.  Flash fried the pork chops then baked in the oven with all of the sauce on it for 20 minutes then seared the sauce in on the BBQ .... AMAZING!!!!!

I wonder if the heat was too high.  (my oven registered 437.  )  I personally found the sauce was too hot for my tastes.  Maybe I'll try it again some day.

Very, very good!  The only thing I changed was the preparation of the chicken; I flattened it with a mallet and then only baked for 20 min each side.  Some other thoughts:
*Definitely line the pan (I used no stick Reynolds foil).  
*Using all of the sugar was good for us
*I didn't cover the chicken with foil because I wanted the sauce to get thick and sticky gooey, which it did!  Delicious!  
*I can see where doubling the sauce would be a good idea so I'll do that next time. 
*Oh there will definitely be a next time!  Maybe with salmon!

I've made it just as it is and my family loved it. I've also made the marinade and put it in a gallon ziplock bag with 2lbs, boneless pork ribs and let it marinade overnight in my fridge. I then baked it and served it over rice and veggies. it was excellent. I know I will make it again.

This was super easy to make in the crock pot instead!  Tastes really good.

I made one and a half times the sauce, because I started with like 16 chicken thighs. Toward the end of cooking it on high for like 5 hours, I took some of sauce out and added about a half a cup of cornstarch to make a rue I added to thicken it up.

I will surely make it again! Next time, I may add some sesame seeds and a tiny bit more ginger.

I followed the recipe in it entirety. The whole family loved it over a bed of rice and broccoli.  I would double the sauces next time just to have extra to drizzle over the rice.

I made 8 thighs and felt like I could have used a little more sauce. I broiled the chicken the last couple minutes to got that nice sticky texture. I also added red pepper flakes to give it a little more kick.

This is an easy recipe to make.  I made it all in a wok or a pan on stove.  I used chicken tenders or cut up chicken breast.  I brown the chicken on the pan and then I add all the sauce ingredients in a bowl, mixed and then added to the pan with cooked chicken.  Let it all simmer until thick and served with rice.  Perfect for a quick weekday meal.

Good recipe. I did double the sauce keeping the sugar at 1/2 cup. I used blonde organic coconut sugar. Next time I might use minced fresh ginger. I used a cup of tamari (gluten free) but to cut the saltiness next time I will probably use half tamari and half coconut aminos. If you aren't using the sauce over rice or stir fry vegetables you don't necessarily need to double it. It's plenty  for the chicken alone. I made stir fry vegetables as a side (onions, julienne red peppers, carrots, snow peas, and savoy cabbage) and wanted to use the extra sauce for that. This is a good one and I will make it again.

It was very tasty,  However, the bake time was only about 30 minutes not the hour that the recipe stated.  After removing from the oven I scooped my chicken and sauce over a bed of rice with oriental vegetables.  Since there are only two of us, I used have the number of chicken thighs.

I sort of made it, but with modifications.  I used rice instead of pasta; and I seared the thighs, then brushed them often as they  baked in an electric skillet.  I'm 76 and chose the skillet as a way to avoid the up/down of baking in the oven and removing from the oven to brush.  I served with oriental veggies.  The carnivores in the family loved it.  We are a "mixed" family (I'm Nana, d-in-law, 2 teens, and son, 3 carnivores and 2 mostly vegetarian).  My 4 stars is about my need to modify, no problem otherwise.

um.. yeah.. this was really good.  I made a double batch of the basting sauce (based on other reviewers), but really didn't need to double it.  I made with 8 good sized thighs in a roasting pan lined with foil.  I used mostly low sodium soy with a little regular soy sauce.  I think I will make it next time with half low sodium soy sauce and half regular soy sauce though it still came out great.  I served the dish with rice and Asian vegetables (bought frozen).   Kids really liked it and I plan to make it every other week.

I've made numerous recipes from this site but this is the first one I'm leaving a review for. This was 
ah-maze-ing!! The boyfriend loved this so much and my picky little 5 year old finished his and started eating mine!! I had leg quarters on hand so I pulled the skin off and followed the recipe as it was given and doubled the sauce like other reviewers suggested.  I'm going to also make this sauce and cook it with a pork tenderloin cut into chunks or maybe even porkchops. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

It reminded me of a dish I had in the army  many years ago. I think they called it five spice chicken and it was soy and teriyaki based chicken. I used a boneless chicken breast because that's what I had on hand at the time.  I had been planning on flattening the breast out, marinating it in teriyaki before placing it over some coals, then topping it with chopped green peppers, chopped onion and cheddar cheese. Then I came across this recipe and figured I give it a try. Glad I did.

This was very tasty, but chicken came out dry. The recipe cooking time of 1 hour at 425 is too long. Next time I will reduce cooking time to 45 min. I used low sodium soy sauce. I cut up an onion, green pepper and carrot and added it to the pan last 30 minutes.

It’s really good! I agree with the rest to double the sauce. I used 4 chicken thighs / legs in a 9x13 dish. Baked at 400F for 30 mins and at 370F for another 30 mins. Lined the dish with foil for easy cleanup and didn’t cover the top with foil as suggested by another user to prevent it from being watery. Baked chicken teriyaki was juicy and tender. This recipe is a keeper!

Instant hit with the family. I used boneless thighs and just cooked it for 15-20 min less. My picky daughter and wife loved it. I would make it according to the directions before you start to get all crazy with additions.

I made this for dinner for my husband and I.  I made exactly as noted in the ingredient list.  It was awesome.  I used the foil and put in a baking dish to make clean up a breeze.

Will definitely be making this again.

Made as written with eight boneless, skinless thighs.  Flavour  was excellent.   My pan did not become a black, sticky mess at the end, so will not waste the foil next time.

Huge hit at my house! I served it with white rice and it complemented it nicely! Cooked nicely, in an 8x8 dish because I only made 4 thighs. I also covered it with aluminum foil and the chicken came out real tender and juicy!

I was taking it out of the oven and I got second degree burns on my fingers and dropped my favorite pan in the oven.  It didn't taste that great either and added negligible flavor to the chicken, had to use my cooking expertise to save the meal by making curry.

The Baked Teriyaki Chicken recipe was perfect! Instead of powdered ginger, I grated fresh ginger and used chicken legs instead of thighs. The chicken was moist, flavorful and extremely tasty!

Used boneless chicken breasts chopped into bite sized pieces in place for of thighs.  The sauce was just the right thickness, and very flavorful.  Served it over rice with side of steamed broccoli.  Had doubled the recipe as I wanted left over.....well that plan failed.  It was gobbled up so fast I barely had chance to get a second spoonful. They loved it.

This was delicious! I did double the sauce because we like more than a coating. I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar so it wasn't too sweet and lite soy sauce so it wasn't too salty. It only took them 40 minutes to reach 165 at the bake temp of 425. I used boneless/skinless thighs. Definitely a keeper!

Made with chicken breasts and after first 30 minutes covered with foil and dropped temp down to 350.  Kept moisture in and made them very moist, could cut with a fork.

Just my way of doing things but use the sauce to marinade the chicken all day or overnight then grill. Make sure to have reserve sauce to add once chicken is grilled I had green onions to the sauce and some honey and garlic chile sauce. Everyone I know work people friends and family devour this

My family and I absolutely love this recipe. However, I can only make it on nights when I can be home during the entire cooking period to do the basting. This can be difficult as my kids are involved in many activities requiring a lot of chauffeuring & late nights. Tonight I made it in my Insta Pot and was very pleased with the results! Doubled the sauce, added an extra tablespoon of water. I let the chicken thighs marinate in the sauce for 20 min, removed them & used the sauté (more) setting to bring the sauce to a boil. I put the chicken back in, set a steam team on top and a bowl of rice on top of that (1 cup rice, 1 cup water). Then 6 minute pressure cook time with natural pressure release.  After pressure released, I removed the chicken to a baking pan, basted with the sauce & broiled it for about 3 minutes while I re-sautéed the sauce to thicken it.  With all the time involved for prep, pressure time & broiling, it was probably a 40 minute meal, but only about 12 minutes hands on!  7 up front and 5 on the back end.

I used chicken thighs with the skin on and bone in. The sauce was delicious and reduced down nicely. However, lots of fat came off of the chicken during cooking and took off the sauce because it was sitting in grease. Regardless, it was good, and I'd make it available.

This is the first time I've made homemade teriyaki sauce, and it will be my go to recipe! It was really delicious! The whole family loved it. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, so cooked it at 400 for about 35 minutes, which was perfect.

This is a delicious recipe and I have no clue why I never made it before tonight. I did make a couple small changes though. I doubled the recipe and used half white sugar, half brown sugar as suggested by other reviews. I also used gluten free soy sauce and for the other half water due to the complaints of saltiness. I brought to a boil on low and then cooked for 5 minutes then stirred and then let it simmer for 5 more minutes. Then I removed from heat and allowed it to sit for 20ish minutes before preparing the chicken. I did use bone in chicken thighs but I removed the skins and extra fat and baked at 400 for 1hour.

7.11.17  I used skinless-boneless chicken thighs, checked the doneness with a meat thermometer, and they were done at 25 minutes. so watch your time.  They were tender, juicy, flavorful, and quick and easy enough for a weekday meal.

I added 3 Tbls of  Honey , reduced the cider vinegar to 1/8 less than what the recipes calls for, and for a added flavor brown sugar was used instead of regular white sugar.  Then topped off with some green onion garnish .

Um, I'm not sure. This was my first time making it. I felt that the temperature was too high and it was baked for too long. I had two sheets with meat. On the smaller one the meat was dry. I didn't expect it to be so dark but it tastes like jerk chicken without the pepper, the uniqueness. If you didn't what it (jerk chicken) taste like, you wouldn't be able to guess at all. But it doesn't taste bad. I'll definitely try it again. Hopefully I don't burn it

I made it to the recipe.  It came out great!  Next time, though, I will make a double batch of the sauce, and, divide it.  Then, marinade the chicken for 6 to 8 hours, and follow the recipe from there.  Delicious, no matter what.

I doubled the sauce ingredients and used boneless skinless chicken thighs which I cooked in a slow cooker as someone else suggested; 4 hours on high.  Delicious and so easy.

My kids love it and eat it every time we make it!  Especially love the fact that it does not have to be marinated.  Thank you for a quick, yummy meal!

It was a good teriyaki recipe, I made the sauce and used it to dress up my stir fry. Family loved it. The sauce itself was way salty but when added to the stir fry it was tamed due to the red and green bell peppers. I also did not use cider vinegar but a combo of rice vinegar and Mirin. Worked well, great recipe!

I was only preparing 6 pieces so I cut down the quantity. I used "splenda" instead of sugar, wosterchire sauce instead of soy sauce, sauted my garlic, fresh ginger and added onion. Had to add more water than called for. I baked my chicken w/sauce for 20 min., flipped, added more sauce, baked 20 min. Placed in microwave to sit, added  quinoa brown and red rice, heated 5 min. Oh my goodness, it was great!

I actually made this in my instant pot with chicken breasts. I created the sauce as instructed, however, I saved the water and cornstarch mixture for the very end. I cooked this on high pressure for 25 minutes with a quick release.

This was so delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly, only substituting chicken breast for the thighs. I also popped it under the broiler for an extra minute or two. We all loved the taste, and I will keep this recipe for future use.

Husband said it's the best teriyaki sauce he's ever had. He's a tough critic so definitely making this again. A bit too salty though. I'll use reduced sodium soy sauce next time.

Love this recipe!!!! I've made it several times and will continue. I double the sauce and use chicken breasts. I pour the sauce over the chicken and bake 30 min at 400 degrees. With a side of rice, this is awesome!! The extra sauce goes well with the rice. I haven't changed the ingredients like others have said. It is salty but I like that. Would probably be just as good with low sodium soy sauce and less sugar. But hard to stray from what I've liked so far.

Wow this is really good. Easy to make. Basting every 10 minutes is great. I MAY add a citrus flavor (fresh squeezed orange or lemon) as this dish is sodium rich. I also prefer a little heat, so I used some crushed red pepper. With that said, this recipe is great as is and needs nothing....thanks for sharing!

Loved the sauce! I also doubled the recommended amount except for the sugar. To add a little pep I also included hoisin sauce. I ended up using thin chicken cutlets and it cooked WAY faster, like in 20 minutes. So if you do use something thinner I'd recommend checking on your chicken more frequently with a meat thermometer to target 165F!

It turned out good so I thought I tasted it but it came out to rubbery I cooked it too long I didn't have the cornstarch so I replaced it with all purpose flour. Lesson to learn.

I gave it a four because I changed it a little. I wanted a sweeter sauce, so I added about 1/4 cup pineapple juice and an extra 1 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch.  Yum! I coated the bottom of the pan and then put some Chinese veggies in the bottom and drizzled them with sauce. Then I put the chicken on top of the veggies.  Great recipe!

Amazing!  Delicious and EASY!! I tripled the sauce and baked the chicken right in the sauce for 1.5 hours.  Served over rice w/broccoli on the side. It was a perfect hit!

I used ginger paste. Other than that I quadrupled the teriyaki recipe. Then froze the leftover in 3 separate freezer bags so then, all I have to do is thaw one and it's off to the races!! 
Other than that, the first time I made it was on Monday. Then was requested again by the end of the week. So I made it again Thursday. I'm making it again now. So, 3 times in 9 days!
A new family favorite!

Easy and good. Poured soy mixture over chicken, basted. Baked for 30" total. Chicken came out fully cooked and juicy. I used half sugar and half brown sugar, as others suggested. Next time I'll use low salt soy, because too salty with regular, imo, and I might use all brown sugar, too. A keeper.

Very good, though I made a notable mistake on my end. Like many other reviews, I doubled the sauce recipe. Also swapped out the Sugar for 3/4ths as much Honey, and cut the water to compensate. Where I screwed up is I only used 8 Chicken Tenderloins, which was too little.

Definitely making this again. I made 2 small additions- 1tsp fresh grated ginger and 3 cloves of garlic (I love garlic). For garnish, I sprinkled the chicken with sesame seeds. I also used the sauce recipe on my broiled salmon (1 hour marinade, 5 minute broil each side) and it was delicious! 

Love this!

I loved this recipe. I ran out of sugar so I used my stevia, took a little longer to thicken up.  Because I have little ones I also substituted with large cut up chicken breast.  Family love it!!!

I have been making this recipe for years. It is my all time favorite dinner to make for people (and the best recipe I've ever tried from All Recipes). I would definitely double the sauce, shorten the cooking time, decrease the temperature, and spray the pan with cooking spray.

Followed one of the reviewers changes and the result was a winning meal for my family of 5! Had to use Tamari sauce to ensure gluten free and used the brown sugar. Dipped my chicken in the sauce and then poured rest of sauce over after half an hour. Amazing!

Absolutely awful.  Only my husband ate it.  My homemade teriyaki has molasses in it and that may be why I hated this.  Mine and my son's went to the dog and we had something else.

Very good! Made the amount the recipe calls for even though I was only making two large chicken breasts.  I used all the sauce! Used low sodium soy. Cooked at 425 for 20 minutes, flipped chicken, then cooked at 375 for 20 more. Perfect. I did baste the liquid over the chicken every 8 -10 minutes or so. Sauteed chopped red, yellow & orange peppers and mixed in with the sauce and poured over meat at the end. Served dish over long grain wild rice. Delicious, tender meat. Not too sweet OR salty! Great recipe.

It was a nearly perfect Teriyaki. Some are way too sweet, this had the perfect balance of flavors. That said, i am going to try lowering the sugar content a little at a time.

Cooked it for my girlfriend's family, went down very well. Using a foil to cover it makes the chicken very moist and was amazing, the flavour of the sauce wasn't as prominent with the chicken. I served it with rice and broccoli, the leftover sauce in the tray with the chicken goes amazingly well with the rice

I made with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Like other reviews, I used low sodium soy, and equal parts white and brown sugar.  Will use more cornstarch next time as it was still runny.  But everyone liked it!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! I have also made the sauce itself for stir fry, beats any pre-made sauce in a jar!! Never going back to store bought! Thanks for sharing!

I had high hopes for this but it was just ok. The sauce was not as thick as it could have been. I have a bahn mi inspired chicken crock pot dump that is a somewhat sweet flavored chicken that i prefer. It uses honey and sugar.

This was delicious , I did as others suggested and cut back on the sugar. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and used sodium reduced soya sauce.  The sauce didn't stick to the chicken as much as I thought it would but the flavour was incredible.  A very quick and easy dinner.

Very easy and the flavor was almost perfect. I'll use low sodium soy sauce next to cut the "almost too salty" taste down. 
Because I was short on time, I actually put the chicken in the oven while the sauce was simmering, about 15 minutes. I starting basting every 10 minutes  for the remainder of the cooking time and it turned out very good.

Probably some of the best teriyaki chicken I have ever had!!! Modified it slightly as some of the reviews suggested, but this has some seriously amazing flavor. The sauce would be really good as a marinade for grilled chicken... That'll be what I do with it next! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs and baked for 35 minutes as another review had suggested. My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  We will definitely make this again.

I used the recipe as shown except for using six thighs instead of 12. I think if I were to use 12, then I would have to double the sauce. Brushing them every ten mins seemed like too much work for me so as another reviewer suggested, I just put all the sauce on and saved a bit back to pour on mid-baking. For 30 mins I cooked them covered in foil, and then removed the foil for the last 30 mins. They turned out tender and delicious. Next time I would like to try using honey instead of sugar.

I did change it up just a little... I doubled the sauce and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of white sugar, probably didn't need to cut the sugar at all but I liked the idea of the brown sugar in there from other reviews, and used 2 tsp fresh ginger instead of the ground, lined the pan with foil.

This was very good. I only had six thighs, so I cut the recipe in half.  I had run out of soy sauce, so I subbed Kikkoman teriyaki sauce, and cut back on the sugar.  Next time, I'll try it with soy sauce.  Baked it in the toaster oven in a foil lined pan.  Served over rice.

This is a review mostly for the sauce (instead of thighs, we used two pounded out breasts and quick fried them with the sauce as a glaze) but it was awesome! The leftover sauce will be used for some shrimp we have that's calling out for the same love.  The recipe will definitely be kept and used over and over again - thanks so much for sharing!

I really liked this recipe, it was easy and tasted delicious. Probably not very healthy but wow I love it. I can't wait to try it with other items like salmon. I only made 6 thighs and coated generously throughout process. Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious. I used extra garlic and poured the sauce over only 4 thighs instead of a dozen. The extra sauce worked out wonderfully when I put the chicken over rice.

Regardless of what meat you cook with, this teriyaki sauce is a winner!  I tend to double(triple) the sauce so I can keep some handy.  So tasty!

This is a really delicious teriyaki recipe, and it's fantastic served over brown rice.  However, there  is a problem with one part of the recipe.  The recipe calls for baking the skinless chicken thighs for a total of 60 minutes, which would only be suitable for bone-in skinless chicken thighs.  Boneless skinless chicken thighs only need to be baked for about 25 minutes depending upon the thickness of each chicken thigh.  It would be helpful for the recipe to specify the times for both boneless and bone-in skinless chicken thighs.  

Marinating the chicken thighs in the teriyaki sauce before baking enhances the flavor of the finished product.  I was able to successfully substitute the half cup of white sugar with a quarter cup of Truvia, which is a sugar / stevia baking blend.   Also, I used reduced sodium soy sauce.  Thank you for such a flavorful teriyaki chicken recipe.

I followed the recipe as stated. I double the sauce and added carrots, celery and onions in my slow cooker. The sauce was tasty but the overall – was just OK. It cooked for five hours in the slow cooker and was tender but the sauce did not stick to the chicken. Safe to say I will not be making this recipe again..

Cooked this just as the recipe stated and it was fabulous. What made it even better was I got my boneless, skinless thighs in the thrift bin at the grocery store, so they were only like $1.50/pack. Win for mom! I did NOT cover it with foil. I baked without anything on top of the pan, however, next time I would line the pan with foil because cleanup was a doozy!

I really liked this recipe.  I never have fresh ginger on hand, and I was happy to discover the ground ginger still gave it a good taste.  I will try this again with fresh ginger though, and will keep this on regular rotation.  I used 2 (large-from a deli) chicken breasts and cooked them on convection bake setting @ 360 degrees for 30 minutes.  They came out perfectly done and tender.

I made this tonight.  Not the first time, but 1st time reviewing. My only suggestion is to make more of the sauce! I made two servings of the chicken and made four servings of the sauce. That still wasn't enough for my husband. I think the next time I will make 12 servings of the sauce for my 2 servings of chicken. Other than that, it's easy to put together. I poured all the sauce on the chicken at once and cooked until the meat thermometer read 165, not an hour.

TOO SALTY!  I almost tossed it in the trash. I salvaged dinner by adding another 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water and it was much better. Next time I would use less pepper and low sodium soy sauce. Husband loved it with the adjustments.

Great taste. I only cooked (6) thighs but I made all the sauce and needed every bit of it. I found the original sauce to be too thin for my liking so I added (1) more T of cornstarch and it turned out nice and thick....like barbeque sauce.

Chicken was very tender, but overall there was a little stronger cider vinegar taste to my liking.  I will try and reduce the amount of vinegar next time.

I am going to give this one a four star, only because I am just now making it, and it is for a friend.

Super easy to put together. I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs.  I did as others suggested and foil lined my pan and covered with foil.  Since I am using a nonstick 8x8 pan, I am baking at 400 and checking in 20 minutes as I know that my oven runs hot.

I hope to remember to use this recipes for making teriyaki sauce for other recipes.

Thank you!

Yum!  Hubby requested teriyaki chicken and I found this recipe.  I thought the chicken might be dry after following the directions exactly, but it was good and tender with a great teriyaki flavor.  Will definitely make again, but might cut some cook time.

My family hates bottled Teriyaki sauce and so do I. I was hesitant to try this but figured since it wasn't bottled I would give it a try. WOW! Everyone raved over it! Now they want me to put this sauce on everything! I used reduced sodium soy sauce since we're all on a low-salt regimen. Use real garlic not the dried stuff. We will be making this over and over again!

Excellent flavor. All of my four kids ate it and enjoyed it. I don't care who you are, but that is success!
We served it with short grain brown rice and sauteed broccoli.
Meat cooked in only 30 minutes total, not 30 minutes and then flip to the other side for another 30 minutes.
Need to double the recipe though.

Made it as written... absolute perfection! Meat was close to falling apart, but stayed together well enough. Poured the sauce left over in the pan into a bowl and drizzled it over rice.

I doubled the recipe and cut down the sugar.  It was good but the sauce was very intense...I would weaken it next time but will make it again.  Just beware!

Made recipe according to directions which I usually do first time out. I used 6 thighs since I was only cooking for two but made full amount of sauce. Had about half the sauce left over. Thighs were cooked in 50 minutes. Tastey and moist. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious! I have a diabetic husband so I substituted the sugar with Splenda and it turned out great. I should've looked at the comments again before making it. I really wished I would've doubled the recipe. I'll remember next time along with using foil inside the pan. It's a keeper.

Loved this recipe. Half way through I cooked it on 450 so it would get crispier.  Very moist chicken and tangy glaze.

We only had half as much chicken as the recipe called for, but I still made the same amount of sauce, and it was excellent!  (With the full amount of chicken there probably wouldn't be enough sauce.)  My whole family loved it, even my 4-year old who can be pretty picky.  The only problem was that my wife was jealous at how much the kids loved the food that I cooked.  :-)

This was a delicious dish.  I omitted garlic because I don't like it and used fresh ginger instead of ground ginger.  I suggest lining the pan with aluminum foil to reduce cleanup.  My boys loved this and ate a huge amount of it.  I served it with white rice with lime and cilantro and broccoli.

Awesome sauce!  I used chicken tenders and cooked on the stove.  I only seasoned chicken with some garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and cracked pepper.  Cooked those in a little olive oil until just about done.  Then I just poured the sauce into the pan (that I had made this morning before going to work) and let it bubble and cook for about 10 minutes or so longer.  Delicious and easy!!  For the sauce, I did not double.  I used 1/4 cup each white and brown sugars.  I doubled the garlic and added a pinch of pepper flakes.  The uncooked chicken tenders are from a bag you can find at most stores, 2lbs I think.  Thanks for this.......looking forward to trying with wings in oven!

This was very good. Double the sauce but keep the sugar and soy sauce the same. (I used lite soy sauce to cut the salt.) I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I suggest putting foil on the bottom of the pan so the sauce doesn't burn. Try dipping the chicken in the sauce (I used boneless and skinless thighs) then pouring the remaining sauce over the chicken before baking. This is my family's favorite recipe.

Everyone loved it! It reminds me of what you'd get at a good Chinese restaurant--solid, whole flavors, nothing artificial.  The alterations I made when making 1.5x recipe: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 sugar, added pineapple tidbits. This was the right amount, and by reserving about 1/3 of the glaze for basting and topping when plating the dishes, we were good to go. Saving this for new moms who have Take Them a Meal trains :)

I love this recipe I have used it several times and this time I tried it in my pressure cooker... it was amazing.... the chicken was moist and packed full of flavor... I doubled the recipe and that is it then I only cooked it for 25 minutes in my pressure cooker.. I think I could have cooked it for about only 15 minutes and it would have been good but this was the first time so I didn't want to take a chance...

I did 8 thighs & doubled the sauce per many other reviews & I did not completely double the sugar but the extra amount added I did use brown sugar. I also didn't double the vinegar but having an orange tree in the backyard I did the zest and juice of a medium sized orange. Came out PERFECT! Not salty at all as others mentioned in their reviews. 

I have a Ninja cooking system which is the best thing ever! Did it for about 45 mins total cooking time. 25 mins on first side then turned for another 20 mins (reduced heat slightly after turning). Bone in thighs, no skin and cooked to perfection.

This was very good, but I did change it a bit, so 4 stars instead of 5.  I used only 1/3 cup brown sugar, and it was plenty, and I added about 2 tbsps fresh minced ginger and 3 garlic cloves.  I used lower sodium soy (less than the recipe called for), and 1/4 cup water.  Like other reviewers, I covered the pan with foil for 30 minutes and took off the foil for the last 30.  The chicken and sauce came out delicious--the chicken was tender and flavorful, and the sauce thick, tangy, and caramelized.    I'll definitely make this again, and I'll use a little less soy next time to mellow the flavor.

Yummy yummy.   Only thing I did different was to use the variety pack of chicken, breast, thigh, legs, wings. That covered all the favorite pieces for the family. Everybody was happy.

Yes very good! but definitely will make it with boneless skinless breasts next time- dealing with bones just took away from my enjoyment of the meal because the meat was too sticky and saucy to handle with fingers- but a fork didn't work great either. so was delicious, but messy to eat. and I will NOT double the sauce next time. i doubled it as many reviewers suggested and i found it to be too soupy-like. by the way, i cooked mine on top of the stove to save time, it worked just fine. excellent flavors. yes, i used light soy sauce and it was a great match of not too much salt but plenty of soy flavor!!!

Added a little sesame oil and it was delicious!
Kept it warm in the slow cooker and it was fall-apart moist.  Our guests loved it too!

family gave it a thumbs up. I thought it was a little strong. I doubled the recipe as many suggested, but found that to be way too much. will make agaib, but may cut the vinegar back just a tad...

Made it with SMART chicken.  It was tender and wonderful.  However, I do not feel any smarter after eating this dish.

I made this last night. I doubled the sauce, but also added about 6 more thighs (6 people, plus leftovers). I used boneless, skinless thighs, therefore, you don't have to cook as long. I cooked 30 minutes (turning at 15 and removing some of the juices, and adding more marinade, as mentioned in some of the reviews, and then broiling for 10 minutes). I used the low sodium soy sauce, which everyone recommended. I also didn't add as much ginger as it called for, as I wasn't sure I would like it - but I did. The sauce took a bit to get thick on the sauce pan and it didn't get too thick on the meat, but it was still delicious.

This was great! Made it as written but with chicken thighs with the fat trimmed. Next time I will add some green onions for a little crunch. It was excellent over rice and beans. I will consider covering pan with foil next time because clean up will be a beast later!

I made the sauce from this recipe but cooked my chicken differently. This sauce is amazing! After reading some reviews, I doubled the recipe and had just enough for 10 thighs. I also used brown sugar instead of white, and lemon juice instead of cider vinegar. Next time I'm going to try it with orange juice.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Made this for the family last night and it was AMAZING!  We have another chicken teriyaki recipe that we enjoy that is made in the crockpot but this recipe beat that one hands down.  After the meal we all rated it on a scale of 1 to 10 and all 5 of us that ate it gave it a 10.  The best part was that it was super simple and pretty common ingredients.  I doubled the sauce as per recommendations but I also  did about 1/2 again as much meat.  For the doubled recipe I used 2 tsp. fresh ginger and 4 cloves of garlic and I used 3/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar.  I also used 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 coconut amino acids.  When I tasted the sauce before brushing the meat and baking it I was skeptical, it was very vinegary and I am not a huge fan of vinegar but we decided to try it anyway and we are so glad we did.  This will definitely be a new family favorite that we make regularly.

I actually followed Valerie Brunmeier's (previous reviewer) modifications and it came out delicious. I think I want to add just a light dash of red pepper flakes to spice it up a tad. Other than that, I was very happy with the outcome. My wife asked me, if I bought the sauce. "That's a good one Honey!"

I  used 4 large Chicken thighs  and made the sauce exactly as recipe stated. I did baste the thighs every 15mins and did NOT turn them over. They had a beautiful glazed color. I used the rest of the sauce in the pan and sauteed some green onions, mushrooms and carrots and then mixed that with some cooked Chinese noodles. Or you could use rice if you prefer. I served the  chicken thigh over the noodles and it looked and smelled great.     The chicken fell off the bone, was very juicy and tasted great! Will definitely make it again!

I really enjoyed this chicken. At first, I followed the recipe for the sauce, and as other reviewers said, I doubled it.  I will say line  the pan with foil! The sauce caramelizes in the oven and is  very, very hard to clean off.

this is the best teriyaki chicken I have made!  Only changes to the sauce were to add cayenne pepper and garlic powder.  I had chicken breast which I cubed and marinaded with some of the sauce.  I threw that in a frying pan with some vegetable oil to cook while I simmered the rest of the sauce for extra dipping.

I made this recipe for my  "test kitchen" friends. You know, those ones that will forgive you if something comes out less than expected. They all loved it! I made a double sauce but don't think I would have needed it. I covered with foil but think I won't the next time. I think the steam kept the sauce from staying on as well. I uncovered it part way through and the sauce stayed on better. It worked well with boneless/skinless chicken. I will be making this again for sure.

This was very easy to make and the flavor was great. I used diced chicken breast and added some red pepper flakes for a bit of heat .  I had to cook it a bit longer than suggested to get the right consistency but overall followed recipe and will make again.

Full of flavor and could've kept eating it all day!  Made it exactly as the recipe was listed. I don't like chicken thighs but my husband loves them so generally, he'll eat them and I make chicken breast for myself but in this recipe, the thighs makes it more juicy and the sauce is what made it stand out so it was a win-win for our family.

I will make this again! Doubled it as suggested. I put these on the grill (7 min each side - basting with extra sauce) to crisp up after baking for 30 minutes. I grilled them because I put too much chicken in the baking pan. They were awesome!  The whole family loved the chicken and poured some of the extra sauce on their rice. Oh - I used boneless skinless thighs.

I cooked this dish at 400 for 40 minutes instead of 425 for 60 minutes.  It was perfect and did not need the extra time.  I lined the dish with foil as the sauce tends to burn.  Delicious.

The best teriyaki recipe EVER!  As so many other reviewers, I have found that I prefer less sodium and double the sauce.  I have made this recipe several times.  Always a hit here at home.  The last time I made it, I cooked the chicken on the stove top in a deep skillet.  The chicken is much juicier when baked, but still turned out delicious!

Delicious! I always read reviews before making any meals, so I made double the recipe, used low-sodium soy sauce, and cut back on the sugar (used a little over 1/2 cup since I doubled the recipe.) I also used 4 skinless chicken breasts, poured all the sauce on top, left uncovered, and baked at 375 for 30 minutes. The chicken was already cooked, maybe a little dry but there was plenty of sauce to moisten it up.:) At first it sounded like way too much pepper and I thought it was a misprint, but since none of the reviews mentioned too much pepper I went with it. Glad I did cos I think that's part of what makes this so good! Definitely my favorite teriyaki sauce to date and will certainly use again. Will probably try it with shrimp too. I finished off the meal with a side of sautéed onions, mushrooms, zucchini and yellow squash. Great meal!

This turned out amazing! I subbed lemon juice instead of the cider vinegar and I ended up adding more corn starch to try to thicken it a little faster. It was a bit tedious basting it every ten minutes but it was worth the effort.

Followed the recipe as listed except used Splenda Brown Sugar in place of reg. white sugar.  I cut the chicken breasts into small slices and baked them with the sauce.  Served the chicken over brown Basamati rice and steamed green beans.  Simple, not too sweet or too salty.  Can't wait to try the sauce on the grill.

Thank you for this easy and excellent recipe. All 5 of my kids and husband enjoyed it. The only changes I made were to double the sauce recipe, and I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic before I poured the sauce over the chicken. I rolled the chicken pieces in the sauce, covered the pan with foil, and baked for 30 minutes. I flipped the chicken and cooked for 30 more minutes. Then, I uncovered the chicken and cooked for ten more minutes. I served it with steamed white rice and steamed veggies.

Substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and added a bit more garlic. Also used skin-on chicken thighs. Came out really tender and delicious.

Very tasty...needs a little less sugar....maybe 1/4 cup. Also use only 8 chicken thighs so you have leftover sauce for your potatoes or rice. Mmmm good chicken!

Delicious. I actually let mine marinade in the teriyaki sauce for a few hours before cooking and it was great. Line the baking dish with foil because it was super hard to clean the teriyaki mixture off.

This is a great recipe.  I sub 6 chicken breasts, usually use mirin instead of the apple cider vinegar (because my husband likes a sweeter teriyaki--this is very good with the cider vinegar), and cook it in the oven covered with aluminum foil for about 30 minutes.  I put all the sauce on first, slather it all over the chicken, then turn it over half way through the cooking time.  We eat it with jasmine rice, and I have sesame seeds with mine.

I feel the heat is too high on this recipe, we had a burned mess. I used chicken thighs and used the aluminum foil suggestion., what a burnt dinner I had to serve. Cutting the temp may take a little longer but I think it might be better.

This truly is the BEST easiest teriyaki sauce ever found anywhere. No ingredients that aren't pantry staples. Easy to double, triple or quadruple for a crowd. My go-to sauce for a lot of types of meats and veggies.

Very tasty! Both me and my husband loved it! I would agree with other reviewers to only put your oven to 375. The glaze started to burn a bit on mine. I should have taken it out at 45 minutes.

This recipe turned out great!  

The only thing is that I made double the batch of marinade. 

The chicken was cooked just right, juicy and tender.

Love this recipe.  I use boneless skinless thighs or boneless skinless breast of chicken.  Must line the pan with foil to make cleanup a breeze. Served over rice with stir fried veggies on the side.  Wonderful!

the only changes I made were using brown sugar, added a splash of orange juice to the sauce, and used chicken legs (that's what I had). So many reviews suggest putting all the sauce on at the beginning but by  brushing throughout cooking adds the layers and builds the sauce on the chicken through cooking. I did not cover - I was a little worried at first - but everything turned out wonderful. served with rice seasoned with turmeric. I had exactly enough sauce that still was sauce-y enough to put on the rice. My rice hating husband went back for seconds just to put the sauce on the rice. He even swiped the last piece of chicken from me

I have made this several times. Some following the recipe and a couple of times pouring the sauce into the baking dish. I prefer it when I bake the sauce after preparing it on the stove with the chicken. A great dish that the whole family enjoys!!!

It was delicious. I made it with chicken wings. I used brown sugar instead of white as suggested by one reviewer.  I cooked it a total of 45 minutes and it came out perfect.

I made this and everyone loved it! I would just suggest doubling  the sauce and serving it with some white rice. I cooked it until it was at 180 degrees fahrenheit and it was really good.

I changed the sauce a little bit with more of a custom teriyaki and used 5 boneless/skinless breasts. I wasn't sure about covering during the baking process due to the liquids of the chicken, so I decided to baked uncovered at 400 for 15 mins then at 350 for 25-30. It came out perfect!! ??

So easy, very delicious. I will definitely make this again when I want an easy meal with not much prep.  I used 2tbsp tapioca starch instead of cornstarch because that's what I had. It worked perfectly. I also just added all the sauce in the beginning and just turned my chicken after thirty minutes.

I loved this recipe!  I used Bragg's Liquid Aminos (Natural Soy Sauce Alternative) and Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar.  I doubled the sauce just as Valerie did and served it with brown rice.  DELICIOUS and EASY dinner!  Great when you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen after a busy day!

Great recipe!  My whole family LOVES this recipe, and I have 6 kids 10 and under!  I gave it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I did follow the reviews and made some changes, but overall it's fabulous!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Apparently this is delicious. I made it one evening and was going to serve it the next evening. My sons and husband all tasted it and said it was delicious. The next day when I was going to serve if, one of my sons came home from school and ate it all!!! I had made a 1/2 recipe. So... I think it must be delicious. I definitely will make again so I can at least taste it.

This is great. We throw ours on the grill about half way through cooking time and get gorgeous caramelization. Also kinda adds a smoky flavor we love! Dressing works on salmon as well and is another favorite in our house.

Delicious!  I made the sauce as written but doubled everything because I am a big Sauce-Lover.  I poured the simmered sauce over chicken quarters in my slow cooker and cooked on high for 5 hours.  Wow!  Great recipe.  However, I can understand why some cooks felt the recipe was too sweet as written, but I highly recommend trying it as written first.  I was very pleased!

This was really good. I unfortunately used skinless boneless thighs therefore it cooked very fast meaning it was on the dry side. The sauce was tasty. I would recommend double the sauce so people can add more if needed.

I didn't add or delete specific items but took the other reviews into consideration (we like more garlic, little less sugar), didn't double the sauce and was fine.  Doesn't look like the picture, my sauce didn't thicken as much.  But the taste was very good, I got boneless chicken thighs and my kids ate it with sauce over rice.  They really liked it.  Will save to make again.

Double everything.  Use Zing Baking Blend to reduce the bad carb amount by at least half.  Taste is awesome.  Added a little Low Sodium Dale's.  DO NOT USE Regular Sodium anything.  OMG...I did 16 Boneless Skinless Thighs (Walmart Yellow Tags) for a buck a pound so 5 pounds and it turned out perfect.  Added all color peppers and served over Bullet Proof Par Boiled Rice.  Perfect and lots of leftovers...

The flavor was really good but it was way too sweet! I'm amazed that I made teriyaki sauce though so I will try it again with less sugar (probably half the amount called for).

I made it with chicken   breasts. it was good. when I make it again  I would  use low sodium soya sauce. also I don't  think you need to double sauce it was enough. I would also marinade  it for a while.

This dish was really great!  I doubled the sauce, used brown sugar instead of white (3/4C.), and added fresh pineapple, green peppers and onions.  It could not have been easier!

Amazing. Followed the recipe. It does not need doubling of the sauce. Plenty with left over for six thighs. The kids loved it.

Very nice recipe. Followed instructions as written. Took the chicken to my fathers house to make dinner for him so put the thighs in the already made sauce to transport. This marinated them for a couple of hrs before cooking. Dinner was a hit, thanks for the recipe!!

I did make some changes. I used a 1/4 cup of Teriayki sauce and a 1/4 cup of soy sauce. For garnish I sprinkled some sesame seeds on top. Highly suggest the you line the pan with foil. So much easier on the clean up. I also poked holes into the chicken so the sauce could go all the way through. Next time I am going to grill it instead.

Yep, really good - much better than using bottled sauce. I used big boneless thighs and they took about 45 minutes. Voted a family favorite. Thanks!

Flavourful! 
As others suggested, I used low sodium soy sauce. Halfed sugar and used a mix of brown and white sugar. Others suggested to double sauce but I found I had too much left over when I did that.
Marinate meat. Used 4 large chicken breasts cut in thirds.
375* for 20 mins each side. Baste every 10mins. 
Pan cleans up well if I soak immediately once I remove chicken. 
Next time I won't bake on cookie sheet but in a medium/small casserole dish. One a cookie sheet it gets ever so slightly dry, so I rather have chicken cook closer together in the sauce. 

Next time:
Can use sauce on chicken, beef, pork or salmon (for fish bake less, until it flakes)

Mods that I made:  Based on feedback from this recipe and others...I reduced white sugar to 1/4c and added 1/8c brown sugar, added red, green and orange bell peppers, an extra onion, fresh snow peas, water chestnuts, can of pineapple chunks (drained) and a splash of white wine.  I quadrupled the sauce, and used four large chicken breasts...cut into bite-sized pieces.  Baked off in two 9x13 baking pans.  We had enough for 8-10 servings over rice.  It was delicious!  Next time, I'll reduce the sugar even a bit more, use even more veggies - maybe thin sliced carrots (softened in micro first), or toss in some steamed broccoli or fresh spinach at the end.  Everyone loved it!

Great recipe! The only change I made was using maple syrup instead of white sugar, and adding a bit more ginger. Super tasty and will definitely be making it again.

I rinsed small red potatoes to put on the bottom of my baking pan.  Marinated chicken breasts in sauce for a bit and then put them on top of little potatoes.  (followed by sauce over all).  Absolute yummy dish!!

Double the sauce and chicken if you are making for a family, or want to have leftovers. I browned the chicken and then put everything in the slow cooker, it went over wonderfully with the family.

The sauce dried up and burned in my pan. The overall first to the dish was smokey in flavour instead of teriyaki. Very disappointing. If I tried it again I would hold out a large portion of the sauce to put over top at the end.

Great recipe! I made a few alterations due to lacking some key ingredients. Instead of minced garlic,  I used a tbsp of garlic powder, and an 1/4 cup of dales seasoning  in addition to  the required soy sauce.  Also I used dollop of  Ken's sesame ginger garlic dressing and sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce too as an extra additive for the flavor.  My 6 and 10 year old loved it!!!!! I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe but used boneless chicken breasts. Very good but I didn't cook it as long as the chicken was well done in 40 minutes. Next time I'll reduce heat and cover.

My husband and son LOVED this. I only had 5 thighs, so I baked it in a glass 8x8 pan at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. I used lite soy and it wasn't salty at all, and kept everything else as listed. Not too sweet at all. I poured some of the sauce in the pan and saved the rest to baste the chicken every 10 minutes. If I had more than 6 pieces, then I would double the sauce because it's delicious on rice or orzo. This recipe will be in our regular rotation!

I have an issue with the raw chicken smell that persist in some chicken recipes.. It happened with this one. I kept the sauce the same, but used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and just poured all the sauce over the chicken pieces an baked for 45 minutes, flipping the pieces couple of time.
I might need to marinate the chicken in some garlic-ginger-lemon marinade prior to baking next time.

I'm so glad I ran across this recipe on here!!! I felt like it didn't make up enough sauce so I made a double batch. I used garlic powder. I used thighs with skin on. It was a lot of work to baste the chicken every ten minutes but it was so worth it. This would be awesome on wings too. The sauce was perfect and turns the perfect color after it comes to a boil. I was worried it would be hot with the amount of pepper but it was fine. I will be making this dish once a month. Yum.

I used boneless, skinless breasts so cut the cooking time by about 10 minutes.  Also added sliced green and red sweet peppers and some onion slices.  The sauce was a little too salty and strong, so will use light soy sauce next time as suggested by others.  Otherwise, very easy and tasty.

I made this and it turned out great!!! The only thing I did differently is that I marinated the chicken overnight. It saved me the hassle of having to brush the chicken every 10 minutes while baking PLUS the chicken came out soooo flavorful! Definitely making this again!

This is yummy!  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and baked the chicken on 375 for 30 minutes (I turned them halfway through).  I used 6 chicken thighs instead of 12 and the amount of sauce was just fine, so if you are making 12, I would definitely double it!

I made this recipe but only for the Teriyaki sauce for a chicken stir fry.  My husband has a soy allergy so instead of soy sauce I used Worstshire  sauce low sodium instead and it came out delicious! Highly recommend!

Watch the sugar, I used less. I also used lower salt soy sauce. Lowered oven temp after awhile like others suggested.
Tip:  line your pan with foil. Or use a pan that is dark, this sauce really leaves some tough to get off  spots!

These were really good.  I followed the suggestions from others and cut the sugar in half.  I used tamari instead of soy sauce in order to reduce the amount of salt  I thought I should have marinated them more but my husband thought they were perfect.  I baked them in the oven but next time I will put them on the grill.

This was so so good! I doubled the ginger and garlic in the sauce. Used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I think you could (and should) cut down on the sugar a little bit (maybe only 3/8 cup), but it was good! I also did about 5-6 shakes of red pepper flakes! I only had 6 boneless chicken thighs so I made this recipe as stated but with only half the amount of chicken. (Essentially doubling the sauce).  If you made this with 12 thighs then you would need to double the sauce for sure so you could have a little leftover to pour over veggies or rice! Also because there was more sauce I believe there is absolutely no need to baste every 10 min.  I just lined the entire pan in heavy duty aluminum foil and then covered the thighs with foil while they cooked (following directions on cook time of 60 min and also turning the thighs over after 30 min). SO much easier this way! Another tip: Make sure you cook the thighs (or whatever you use) whole and THEN slice them up. Don't slice before you bake, so that they will remain juicy!  I am thinking I will be making this regularly in our house! Thanks for a DELICIOUS recipe!

Easy and delicious!  Great recipe for a novice, hard to mess up.  I had everything on hand, except the chicken wasn't skinless and I used raw, unrefined sugar.  Tasted great -- this recipe is a keeper! 

Reminder: Don't forget to grease the pan or it will be hard to clean.

This was fantastic!  I have extremely picky eaters and this was a HUGE hit!  I did use Coconut Aminos in place of soy sauce and I was out of ground ginger--so I added a little bit of GF Teriyaki sauce.  Loved this!

Really enjoyed this chicken, the sauce was amazing! It did come out slightly overcooked though, I will look towards shaving ten minutes or so off of the cook time in the future.

Fantastic! I doubled the sauce, using a little less than 1/2 to marinate the chicken in overnight (I used a combo of legs and thighs). I reserved the other 1/2 to baste on while it was baking...delicious! The whole family LOVED this...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Sauce was great tasting, used a little less full salt soy and it was not salty. Made it with chicken thighs and salmon but should have tripled the recipe.  All in all a success! Thanks!

Made this last night for the second time and it was much better than the first time I made it. I followed the ingredients but doubled the sauce. Reserve some sauce in a separate bowl in case you want to add extra sauce to the cooked chicken when serving it.
Instead of brushing the sauce on the chicken, I dipped each piece of chicken into the sauce, put them on the pan, then covered the chicken with one layer of foil. I baked the chicken (without brushing additional sauce) for 30 minutes, flipped the chicken, brushed on more sauce (just this one time), uncovered it and baked for 30 minutes. It turned out juicy, delicious, and tender!

Good recipe - the taste was nice and came close to teriyaki. I personally think this dish was better served hot and fresh out of the oven, rather than kept in the fridge for a day.

Easy and can't screw up.  I added a spoon of marmalade cause I like it and a dash of red pepper cause that makes everything better.  Not only is it delish, but the house smells yummy too.

Only changes I made were to substitute 1/4 cup brown sugar for the 1/2 cup white sugar and I used low sodium soy sauce.  Delicious and easy.  The chicken was very juicy.

I completely followed the recipe other than I put the extra sauce on every 20 minutes and then made an extra batch of sauce to pour over after it was finished. I also used chicken tenderloins instead of the chicken thighs. Overall, it was absolutely delicious.

I wasn't sure about this sauce at first, but after the time in the oven it thickened up perfectly.  Very tasty.  The pepper really added some heat, so use this at your discretion.

Fabulous! I always use low sodium soy sauce so I used it here. I followed the recipe (doubled the sauce) but used squeeze ginger instead of ground and took the advice of other reviewers and used brown sugar instead of white. I also had the idea of adding 2 T. of frozen OJ just to give it that "orange chicken" or "General's chicken"kind of flavor. Amazing! Cooked 6 thighs in the oven covered with foil. 400 degrees for 25 minutes. Served with rice and broccoli. Will definitely do again, so tasty and so easy.

Great recipe...I doubled the recipe as others have done. Also, since it can be messy, I used Reynolds Non-Stick foil but I didn't cover it. Baste often...Enjoy with or over rice and a green veggie! 

Also...If you have leftover... Check out the Chicken  Rangoon recipe. Great snack.

This was very, very good! I made it for my son and his family and served it with rice and a veg and salad. I doubled the chicken and quadrupled the sauce and had lots left over to put into the freezer for another meal for my hubby and I. It was very easy and yet bursting with flavour. I think it's worth it to use the fresh ginger and maybe add a bit more than called for according to your taste. If it doesn't thicken quite to your liking add a bit more cornstarch and thicken it on the stove. No worries! Just remember to add more cornstarch to the recipe next time you make it.

- Doubled the sauce with these modifications: 3/4 c soy sauce, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c white sugar.
- Used 4 chicken breasts.
- Covered chicken with sauce (rather than basting).
- Cooked for 30 minutes covered in foil, then turned and cooked for another 10 minutes.

I halved the recipe for 8 chicken drumsticks. I substituted the sugar for Splenda and used extra minced garlic, and it turned out delicious.

I brushed the sauce onto both sides of the drumsticks, and then baked at 375 for 35 minutes. Next time, I won't make only half of the sauce, because I'd love to try them super saucy, and maybe broiled for a crispy texture.

I make this recipe every couple weeks! I make with the ingredients as the recipe says, dip my chicken thighs (6-8) in the sauce, put them in a foil lined 8x8 and dump the remaining sauce over it. Bake for about 45 mins. I serve it with broccoli and rice. It's a win every time!

Granddaughter, son, and hubster approved.  They all really liked the flavor, but my sauce didn't thicken up as nicely as I wished.  I'll probably do this recipe again, as I love to use chicken thighs.  Thanks for posting!

Pretty good, coming from a beginner cook. I should have doubled the sauce.  And I needed to turn it up higher than low for it to thicken. Had me panicking got a minute lol.

My family and I loved this recipe. I did not change a thing and after making it, I still would not change a thing. My picky granddaughter liked it too.  Yes, this is going in my rotation! I made this again last night and had to run out so it didn't get based. I did turn the thighs over halfway. That did not make a difference. It was just as good as ever. Thighs are perfect for this recipe so don't substitute!

This was really good. Too much vinegar for me and mine, but I got the thumbs up to make it again sometime.   Notes: probably better with rice instead of Sweet Hawaiian Rolls,  next time I might put it all in the slow cooker and see how it turns out and lastly, i feel like its missing something-maybe some chopped green onions or chili flakes...can't quite put my finger on it,..at least I get to make this more than once.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Have made it several times now. The only thing I recommend is to use low sodium soya sauce, unless you like it very salty. Great paired with grilled asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes. Perfect meal and easy to make.

Pretty close to perfect. The only change I made was I used 1/3 brown sugar instead of the white sugar. I prefer brown sugar for marinades and sauces. I used low sodium soy sauce and I used boneless thighs which really reduced cooking time. I heated the sauce until it thickened a bit and then poured it over the chicken before baking. I baked 4 boneless thighs at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. I think I'll try to adapt this for a stir fry next time.

The sauce is very good. I used a little less half white and half brown sugar with 2 TBS. of honey added for stickiness. Doubled the recipe so I could use the rest for later (another cut of meat).  Used boneless thighs and almost over cooked. 40 min. Is enough for boneless.

Read the reviews so I reduced the soya sauce to 1/4 cup.  Husband said it's a keeper.  Chicken very tender, good flavor.  Used a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, clean up was a zip.  Will make this again!

Very easy and tasty.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  It has a lot of flavor but not overpowering so my picky eater husband, who won't eat anything with vinegar, garlic or other spices thought it was excellent.   It's a good recipe for casual dining with a group, as it's easy, and would make a great appetizer.

Delicious! I've made this as is, and also made the sauce for stir fry instead of a bake. I've always done low sodium soy as well. Love it!

Wow!  This was fantastic!  Everybody loved it, even my hubby who traditionally doesn't like a sweeter sauce.  Will definitely make it again.  

My mods: I used a gluten-free soy sauce (as I'm celiac) but I only used about 1/3 cup.  I tasted it before cooking to make sure it wasn't too sweet or too salty.  Then, I added 1/4 cup water to make up for the missing liquid.  A wonderful recipe!!

Soooo delish!!  I made this and followed the recipe as is.  Only change was instead of using 12 chicken thighs, I only used 4 and it was perfect!  I would definitely suggest trying it! :-)

We loved the sauce but found that the chicken thighs were too fatty, we're used to a leaner cut.  Next time we'll make it with chicken breasts.  

So, the second time,  I used chicken breasts and this recipe is a keeper.  Fantastic!

My husband loves this. Instead of baking I marinade chicken for a few hours and grill it. I baste the chicken with the  soy sauce mixture in the last 5-10 min on the grill. When I serve it I top it with the soy sauce mixture. I followed other reviews and doubled the sauce and used more brown sugar than white.

Followed other reviews and baked at 375 for 25 mins covered with foil and 15 mins uncovered. Super tender and incredibly flavorful! I only made 6 thighs with this sauce and it was nice to have the extra sauce,  so for 12 thighs I might double it like others recommended. I also did not add the whole amount of sugar like many others stated, used light soy sauce, fresh ginger, and did not add any extra salt.

Easy recipe and great alternative for bottled Teriyaki sauce.

Definetly use aluminum foil to line the roasting dish for easy clean up.  Will use double or triple layers next time,  it tore when I turned the chicken.

Changes made were:  1/2 cup of white sugar , fresh ground ginger and low sodium soy sauce. After cooking it and getting it slightly thick,  I pored it all on the chicken.  I made a  combination of  chicken thighs and boneless chicken breasts  since my son likes chicken cutlet only.  Next time will try using the sauce to cook the breasts on the stovetop to avoid overcooking as thighs are perfect at receipes cooking temp but breast weren't but that was my mistake.  The thighs were fantastic! 

Once The chicken was cooked I poured the sauce from the rosting pan into a pot and cooked until reduced to a thicker consistency and pured on the chicken.  

Can't wait to make the sauce again and try it on salmon & shrimp!

It was quite tasty and I will make it again. Was a little sweet for me, so next time I will cut the sugar.  I used boneless, skinless breasts and the cooking time was too long, making the chicken drier than I prefer - my fault for being lazy and not using my thermometer.

A  hint to everyone out there that is saying the recipe is on the verge of being too salty. Solution is to use the SWEET SOY. If you can't find it in your grocery store, go to an Asian grocery store. Its very inexpensive & a very tall bottle. I used all brown sugar instead. I also used chicken breast & doubled the sauce recipe for pouring over the Breast  when served. DELICIOUS!!!

Great basic recipe that can be used many ways.  I made the sauce, cooled it, put in my raw chicken breasts and let is sit in the refrigerator until ready to bake.  I added some sesame seeds, green onions and a chopped green pepper baked it  and  then served it over cooked rice.

This is a go-to recipe in our house.  We have it about once a month.  I always double the sauce, use "fresh" ginger (from a tube in the produce section), and cook it about 15 minutes longer so it falls off the bone.  YUM!

This one is a keeper.  I used half the amount of chicken (there's only three of us), but kept the same amounts for the sauce.  There were three sad little scallions in the fridge so a sliced them into the sauce while it was simmering.  I also added about 1/4 cup marsala to the sauce after cooking it and then poured it over the chicken.  This sauce would work well with shrimp, pork, or beef.

I use 4 bone-in chichen breast or thighs & the sauce is just enough, so I also recommend doubling the sauce if your using more chicken. My 3, 8 & 10 year old all LOVE this recipe and request it often. Very easy. We don't cook with salt, and it is just right with the low sodium soy. We always add more garlic, and use less sugar... personal taste.

This was a delicious recipe!!!  I did have to make a few alterations due to lack of ingredients & then flavor. I did not have any cornstarch or enough Cider Vinegar.  I substituted flour for the cornstarch, same increment and I used half cider vinegar & half dark rice wine vinegar. I also used 1 whole cup of sugar and 2 tbls. Of Honey.

I made this recipe exactly as it says. It is by far the best teriyaki sauce I've ever tasted. It doubles nicely too. I used it also as a marinade and dipping sauce.
Thank you Marian Collins for sharing this very good recipe.

This was so flavorful! The chicken was moist and it reheated even better than the first serving. Will definitely make it again.

This is the second time I made this recipe. Followed it as written, with the exception of the sugar. I only used 1/4 cup. It was terrific again! I did leave the skin on a few of the thighs and thought I would crisp them in the broiler, it didn't work out and they are so flavorful without the skin, I wont bother again. Having covered the chicken for the first 30 minutes, there was a lot of juice, I removed the chicken and poured the juice into a saucepan. I cooked it down and bit to thicken and used it to pour over the rice that I made with this dish. Very good, quick and easy recipe with wonderful results.

I thought the taste of the sauce was really good, but I think next time I may marinate the chicken in the sauce overnight. I used boneless chicken breast and baked at 375 degrees, basting every 10 minutes. That was a bit of a pain but if I marinate the chicken and just dump it all in a pan, I can just flip the chicken every ten min or soy. I also think I'll use a lower sodium version of the soy sauce. Besides that, this turned out great!

The sauce for this one is very tasty! It didn't get quite as thick as I would have liked, but it was delicious. I did as another reviewer suggested and poured about 3/4 of the sauce over the chicken initially, covered the dish with foil, and baked for 30 minutes. I then removed the foil, covered the chicken with the remaining sauce, and continued baking for an additional 20 minutes. I served it with salad and rice. Very good!

only thing I do differently is use Bragg's liquid aminos instead of soy sauce....fraction of the sodium with the same great taste! My husband had kidney disease so sodium is a big no-no...I have experimented and learned alternatives for many favorites!

I took others advice but used six thighs to the sauce and it was delicious! Used fresh ginger instead of powder also. Cook temperature sounded way to high so I baked it at 375 instead it turned out great. After I removed chicken I thinned out the sauce with a little water and poured it over some steamed broccoli and cauliflower. Awesome! Just like take out Chinese.
Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved this recipe, I covered the chicken with foil for the first half of the time and then removed it so the chicken could become crisp on top. It turned out juicy and flavorful. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious.  I usually don't eat thighs but will be buying more in the future to use with this recipe.  I didn't change a thing....I made it exactly as it is written.  The chicken came out  tender and full of flavor. I will definitely make it again.

The only change I made was to substitute a portion of the soy sauce. I used fish sauce instead. The sauce on the bottom of the pan burned and I was glad I'd used aluminum foil, which made cleanup so much easier. I don't see the need to double the sauce, as we didn't dip the thighs. They were perfectly seasoned/sauced as it was. My kids loved it and ate the leftovers happily for two days. I'm making it again tonight and we're all excited!

This was a hit with the kids. I had to modify the recipe a little because didn't have everything on hand. I substituted Tamari Low Sodium Soy Sauce for regular soy and rice vinegar for the cider vinegar. Turned out great!

This was a hit, Subbed 1/2 of the white sugar for brown and used chicken breast, made a great stir fry sauce.  Next time I will cut the sugar down completely maybe on 1/4 cup sugar total.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Put in tin foil lined glass baking dish.  I doubled the sauce recipe and used fresh ginger & doubled the garlic. I doubled the cornstarch to make the sauce  thicker  & poured the entire amount of sauce onto the chicken while cooking. Cooked at 375 covered with tin foil for 30 minutes and then turned the chicken over and  took the tin foil off for 30 more minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly. I think the apple cider vinegar was the culprit. I've made other recipes on allrecipes and this one has SO many reviews so i thought it would be amazing no matter what but now im just confused.

Yum! Halved the chicken for us two, but kept amount of sauce the same, as per other's suggestions. This worked out well.  Reduced cooking temp to account for butterflying two breasts, and only basted twice.  Very nice recipe.

I decreased the recipe in half to serve just 2 people. Perfect amount when served with rice and a veggie. I also cut the cooking time in half by cutting the boneless thighs  into strips. My husband loves this recipe and has requested a number of times already.

I have made this recipe a least a dozen times over the years, and it always turns out great.  Of course it varies slightly depending on how saucy, garlicy, or gingery I am feeling that day, but it is always a family favorite. I use fresh ginger and cracked pepper, but otherwise stick pretty close to the recipe. Our favorite side dish with this is coconut rice and a deep green vegetable.

Boyfriend and kids loved this! I followed the recipe exactly except I only had 6 chicken thighs, and had just enough sauce for the chicken and a couple of sausage links (see note below), so I definitely recommend doubling the recipe if you're making 12 thighs.

I didn't have as much chicken on hand as I thought, so I also basted a couple of hot Italian sausage links with the sauce, and that got rave reviews as well. The sweet and spicy together were a great combo!

I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and covered with a loose layer of aluminium foil on top to prevent burning/drying out.

My boyfriend loves this recipe!  Such an easy, tasteful meal.  After making the Teriyaki Sauce, we marinated the chicken in it for about 30 minutes to soak up some more of the taste and it was just amazing!  Definitely will be hanging on to this Recipe!

This was excellent and so simple! I reserved some of the sauce to sprinkle on the chicken before serving it. We used this on lettuce wraps with wontom strips and sesame seeds.

This is really a fantastic teriyaki sauce. I made it as per the recipe and it turned out scrumptious. My family and I were/are pleased. This one is a keeper. The next time I make it however, I'm going to cook it on the charcoal grill. I'll be making it again...soon. Thanks for sharing a fabulous teriyaki chicken recipe.

I doubled the amount of sauce and added about 1 cup of honey to it. It was DELICIOUS! Served it over rice and the extra sauce was great for that.

Awesome! Baked 30 mins while basting every 10. Then broiled approx 2 mins. I opened my boneless skinless  thighs up though which is likely why they cooked quicker. So good!!!

I used four boneless, skinless chicken breasts in place of the thighs and doubled the sauce (because I LOVE teriyaki sauce!). It turned out great, and I'd definitely make it again!

This is my new go-to glaze for chicken, pork and salmon!  So flavorful!  I didn't want to make an extra trip to the store, so I substituted red wine vinegar--doubt that it made a difference in the end.

Wow!  I will definitely make this again.   I was amazed at how much my child of 'discerning taste' :) enjoyed this - she kept asking for more!  I did double the sauce, and ended up with plenty left over. 
I did change a few things (some of which were based on earlier reviews).  I had chicken tenders on hand, which were cut in half.  I used half brown sugar, half white sugar.  After preparing the sauce, I dropped the chicken pieces in the saucepan and coated them all before dumping the whole thing into my foil-lined pan.  Baked it  covered at 375 for 15 mins, turned the pieces over, then baked it (still covered) for another 15 mins.
But I am rating this based on 1) how much my family liked it and 2) how easy this was to prepare.
Thanks for a great recipe!

I doubled the sauce but with 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. Used boneless skinless thighs. Poured half the sauce on in beginning and covered with foil. Baked at 375 degrees for 25 min. Poured remaining sauce on chicken and baked another 25 min uncovered. Delicious!!!

I didn't make any changes to this recipe.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will make it again, but want to try marinating chicken breast tenderloins and then grill them on skewers.   
I do recommend making extra sauce to dip when done.  Delicious!

My husband really like this - and he's not a big fan of chicken.  I did half white sugar and half brown.  I also added more garlic.  I kept the sauce the same amount but only cooked two boneless breasts that I pounded a little bit.  400 degrees for 30 mins - flipped once in the middle of the time.  Next time I'll try 25 mins.

Excellent!  We ate the whole thing up!  I had about 10 boneless, skinless thighs and it was the perfect amount of sauce.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and halve the sugar.  I did brush the sauce on the chicken every 10 minutes, as directed, but ran out of sauce after 30 minutes, so then I just basted with the sauce that was in the pan after that.  I think I only cooked these for about 45 minutes and that was plenty.  There was plenty of sauce in the pan to spoon out a bit onto each piece of chicken, which made it even more delicious.  Will definitely be making this again and might try it with pork or fish.

Truly amazing!  Perfect as is, just didn't need to cook for quite as long.  We used this amount of sauce for 6 thighs, for 12 I would double the amount of sauce.

We really did not care for this.  I used chicken breast, and put in the crock pot. I did not use garlic, as we do not like it. We ate it, but  will not make it again.

I've made this twice now; first time I made it with extra ginger and garlic, second time I used organic sucanat (dehydrated sugar cane juice). Both times it was excellent, though you won't need the cornstarch and water when you use sucanat. The heat will caramelize the cane juice sugar allowing the sauce to thicken quickly over the stove.

Yum!  Super easy!  I used chicken breasts cut into big chunks (3rds) instead of thighs (hubby hates them).  I poured all of the sauce into the pan and let them bake for about 45 minutes (turning half way through).  Made a fabulous dinner with stir fried red and orange peppers, zucchini, chariots and green onions plus steamed rice.  Will absolutely make this again exactly as written.

Absolutely one of my favorite dishes to make and one that my daughter never complains about.  I follow the recipe as written but I do double the sauce. I serve with white rice & broccoli.  I would definitely suggest lining the pan with foil to assist in cleanup.

Some reviews say that this is too sweet and you need to cut the sugar. For my taste, the sweetness is just fine. Definitely double up the sauce. I also used grated fresh ginger. I poured half the sauce on the chicken, covered it with foil and baked for 30 mins. Then I removed the foil, poured the rest of the sauce and baked for another 15 mins. Serve it over rice.

The sauce was okay, although it was a little thick. I may have cooked it too long so it thickened up a lot. Unfortunately, the chicken came out very dry. Otherwise, it would have been a pretty good dish.

Doubled the sauce, less sugar, a little honey, rice vinegar instead of cider, fresh grated ginger and garlic, a dash of sesame oil and red pepper flake- tossed with wingettes- Perfect teriyaki sticky wings! I will definitely use again!

I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and low sodium soy sauce.  I like my food salty and I didn't have to salt this.  It was a huge hit!  I'm going to use my garlic press instead of mince it next time.

I made this tonight and it was great. I was worried that the sauce would be too salty as i used regular soy sauce so i added about 2/3 cups of water and it made the sauce watery :( i added just a tiny bit of garlic and ginger. Overall it was good, better than bottled teriyaki.

I used 5 small boneless chicken breasts and baked it at 375 degrees for 
40-45 mins. Delicious!

This was great! I doubled the sauce and it was the perfect amount. To cut calories I used Splenda-- 1/4 cup of the brown sugar blend (for the doubled amount) and a little less than 1/4 cup of the white Splenda for baking. I also used 2/3 c. of reduced sodium soy sauce instead of the 1 c. of regular and 3 cloves of garlic.
For the chicken I used 3 (2 lb. total) large boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in half so I had 6 smaller pieces. I poked holes in the chicken with a fork and covered with half of the sauce. I baked for about 18 min at 375 deg then poured off the chicken juices flipped the chicken, covered with the remaining sauce and baked for another 12-15 min. I served with brown rice and steamed broccoli. It came out perfect and there was plenty of sauce left in the baking dish.

I used 3 tablespoons white sugar, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 3 cloves of garlic, and 1 small ginger grated. Fresh ginger really makes a big difference! My boyfriend was slurping the teriyaki! Very delicious and definitely a keeper. I am going to try it on salmon next time (used chicken today)!

I made the recipe as-is with one  very slight adjustment: I used 1/3rd less sugar. I also used chicken breasts, cut them in half and baked 'em at 400 degrees for 30 mins. Chicken came out moist and pretty danged tasty. Served with yellow rice and steamed broccoli. Will definitely make this again, thank you!!

Perfection. Stick to recipe for BEST results. Family favorite! I serve with microwave veggies over angel hair pasta, egg noodles, or rice for an inexpensive, easy meal that tastes EVEN BETTER as a LEFTOVER the next day.

This recipe was defiantly not a keeper for us.  The vinegar flavor was too overpowering, it just seemed to be way too much.  Nobody really liked it and I won't be making it again.

Excellent! This dish quickly became a family favourite, the three teenagers raved about it. I tried cutting the sugar, but ended up adding the full amount to balance out the sauce. I had 24 skinless chicken thighs in two pans side  by side, and there was enough sauce to go around (and to pour over the rice).  So easy to make, will definitely add to the regular rotation.

This is a 4 star dish, but it is a 5 star dish (DELICIOUS) with modifications. I used lite soy sauce AND cut it in half. I also used 1T fresh ginger, minced, for the ground ginger. That gave it the zing that really put it over the top. I used less sugar than it called for (about 3/4 the amount), and substituted brown sugar for half of that. The sauce was absolutely fantastic with these modifications, but it really needed to be doubled for our tastes.

Also, the chicken ended up swimming in water. I'd either bake it most of the way and then drain it BEFORE putting on the sauce OR put it on a greased rack to bake. 

With those modifications, this would be wonderful! We served it over rice with steamed veggies and a salad.

I used all the ingredients to make the sauce; diced chicken breast and stir-fried all together.  Served with sticky rice.  Much faster this way.  My son loved it!  Very tasty.

I made the mistake of not removing the skin from the bone-in chicken that I used.  It turned out very "watery."  If I make this again I will use chicken breasts.

A lot of reviewers said to half the amount of sugar but I tasted it and felt I needed to add more but not the whole amount. Since I doubled the sauce, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar. I lined my pan with heavy duty foil then poured most of the thickened sauce over bone-in thighs (skin removed) and some boneless breasts but reserved a little. Cooked, covered with foil for 30 minutes, removed foil, poured remainder of sauce over and bake another 20-30 minutes. Wow. Really good!

Followed recipe exactly with exception of doubling it (I have 4 kids with good appetites). Only thing I may suggest is you should double the sauce no matter what. It absorbs during the cooking process and while the chicken will be excellent you'll find yourself wanting extra sauce at the end.

this was really good and so easy to make. With some rice and stir fry veg this is such a wholesome dinner. I tried doubling the sauce, but ended up covering the chicken thighs with it and had some left.

I cooked it for only thirty minutes and the boneless, skinless thighs I used were cooked (even a little dry). I spread them out, though, and next time I will try leaving them folded. The flavor was great and I liked how much more tender the thighs were than the standard boneless breasts.

Good flavor but SALTY!   After making it the first time, I drained some of the sauce added more water and sugar and marinated the chicken thighs for several hours.  I grilled the thighs and they were wonderful.   The sauce, however, was way too salty for me, my family and grandparents so it was not used with the meal.   I am getting ready to make this dish again and will be using only 1/4 of low sodium soy sauce to see if it makes a difference.

I doubled the recipe and used low sodium soy sauce and 3/4 brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated sugar.  I thought the sauce was a little strong with the amount of apple cider vinegar, so I added about 1/2 cup water to it.  Baked it in a baking dish lined with foil and used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Baked at 375 degrees.  It was very tender and flavorful.  Would make again.

This was really good. I love a yummy teriyaki chicken, and this one hit the spot!
I made it in the crock pot instead of oven. Made the sauce per recipe directions (doubled the sauce ingredients) and poured over 3 lb frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Cooked on high about 5 hours. Came out perfect! Served over Jasmine rice with buttered broccoli on the side. Kids loved it as well!

Excellent and quick weeknight meal.  The entire family loved it.  Didn't change a thing and served with roasted asparagus and rice.  We actually had to flip a coin to see who would get to take the leftovers for lunch!

Excellent! I doubled the sauce like everyone suggested, used lite soy sauce, and used a total of 4 garlic gloves. Be sure to line your pan with tin foil for an easy clean up! I also covered the chicken for the first 30 minutes, but when I went to flip the chicken it was a soupy mess! I left uncovered for the remaining 30 minutes and the sauce thickened up perfectly. This recipe will definitely be added to my collection.

Very good!  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  I didn't use skinless thighs, that's the only change I would make. I had it over a bed of rice. Excellent recipe!

amazing sauce that I'm assuming would be great on any meat.  Ours thinned out quite a bit in the oven so next time I'll either reserve some to serve with it or make it thicker.

This teriyaki  sauce is amazing!!! I, on the suggestion of other reviewers , poured most of the sauce over the chicken and covered with foil, and baked for 30 minutes. After that I uncovered it, poured the remaining sauce over and baked uncovered for another 30 minutes. This turned out well, except that the sauce was quite runny and did not stick to the chicken. The chicken was still great, and the sauce was awesome on rice.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The only changes that I made was the fact that I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs because that's all I had on hand. I also replaced the white sugar with brown sugar. My family gives this recipe a thumbs up so I will definitely be adding this to my recipe book. Thank you so much!

You do NOT need to double the sauce. I repeat! Do NOT double sauce.  You aren't poaching the chicken, it is just for brushing!  DO NOT DOUBLE!  I did and I have more than twice as much as I need. Changes:  Always use light soy sauce or it is just way over powering.  I added a bit of orange juice, because we like that, and I cut the sugar by 25%. All Teriyaki recipes have equal soy and sugar, so there must be a reason...but still I cut it.  And I did use brown sugar.  I also added about a TBS of sesame seeds, because I had them. The sauce can't be used for gravy, it is far too intense.  It's like 30x concentrated.  Maybe because I accidently had regular soy and not light.  But, generally speaking, I liked the recipe, my kids ate it and I will make it again (Since I have all this sauce left)  Oh. I baked 45 mins at 400 and brushed sauce every 15.  For the last 15 I poured out all the residual liquid, and kicked up to 425....good browning of the sauce then. (we like dry chicken...I know, but hey)

This is a great recipe. For our family we double the sauce, and I also choose to use garlic powder and powdered ginger. I find this is easier. I have done both ways and notice little difference.  This recipe is easy...and a great teriyaki chicken made at home.  Do take the advice of others and use foil pans...makes clean up so easy!

My family really enjoyed this dish. An important thing I noted was to mix the cornstarch and water before adding to the sauce. I used a little less sugar, almost 1/2 C; regular soy sauce; 2 garlic cloves, but could have used another. I wanted to used fresh ginger, but ran short on time and used powder. It was still good. As someone else suggested, I poured most of the sauce over the thighs (bone up), covered and baked 30 min. Then I removed the cover, turned the chicken and poured the remaining sauce on and baked for another 20 min.  It was very good with a side of stir fried veggies.

Made the sauce exactly as the recipe is written, but I cooked and cubed the chicken in a frying pan and then stirred it into the sauce. It was WONDERFUL! Thank you :)

So easy and very few dishes! Made it exactly as recipe states. Would recommend covering with aluminium foil while baking and taking it off the last ten min.

Found this too tart. Increased sugar and water and corn starch to calm it down.  It was good after I tinkered with the portions. To make again  I would  add vinegar  a little  at a time replacing  about half with water.

I made it the dish exactly as it was listed but it lacked some flavor. I ended up doctoring it up and adding some roasted sesame seeds. I also served it with a side of canned crushed pineapple and honey mixture as a chicken dip.   Adding those two items to the – really made the dish a 4 instead of three. My family did love this and I would make it again as altered in my review.

Made some basic changes based on other reviews here ( used breasts pounded and cut into 1/3rds, baked at 350 for 30 min, doubled the sauce).  I always use low sodium soy, so also made that substitution.

I'd like to see more of a crisp or carmelization of the sauce on the chicken.  Next time I might try brushing the tops of the breasts with sauce, and searing them a bit for color.

Flavor was good, we both liked it.  BF commented on how nice the presentation was - rice, chicken, a drizzle of extra sauce, and a sprinkle of green onions with a side of carrots, shrooms, and onions sauteed in sesame oil and naan.

Nice simple meal for a work night!  I'll make it again, for sure.

I made this as directed.  I was surprised with the amount of liquid produced by the chicken.
I used 8 boneless/skinless chicken thighs and served with green beans and chicken flavored noodles.  I also doubled the amount of sauce, as others have.  The extra was really needed.  The amount in the recipe is not nearly enough.
Excellent recipe. I will surely make it again.

This was good.  I halved the sugar.  I used 2 parts low sodium soy sauce/1 part regular soy sauce.  Next time (and I WILL make it again) I will probably add more ginger--or use fresh--and maybe not cut the sugar quite as much.  Also, I cooked it at about 350 degrees for an hour or a little less.  One thing I really like about this recipe is that its ingredients are things most people have on hand, but it still tastes special.

I doubled the Teriyaki sauce ingredients, and used fresh grated ginger root minced in with the garlic. Using chicken breast, I brushed all sides with Teriyaki sauce, covered, and baked for 20 minutes. I uncovered, turned, and basted heavily with Teriyaki sauce, then backed uncovered til chicken was done.

Wow! The best! The prep time was off (it took a lot longer than 30 minutes...), but in the end it was worth it. The kids and my husband loved it and that doesn't happen very often! I also have a habit of acidentally over cooking baked chicken, so I was nervous since this has a total of 60 minutes  cook time, but it was perfect! Not over cooked at all. Very moist and tender. I will definitely be making this again very soon.

I was cooking for only my husband and myself, so I just threw our two chicken breasts on our little indoor grill to cook them. But I made the sauce per this recipe, and it was great! I used low-sodium soy sauce as was suggested, and it was still a little salty, but delicious anyway.  I cut our chicken up into pieces, cooked it up in the sauce for awhile, then layered rice, steamed broccoli and carrots, and the chicken with the sauce on top to make Teriyaki Chicken Bowls. It was an excellent dinner. Will definitely use the sauce again-- thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so good and it's a must have for those chicken thighs.  I make a double batch to be able to baste every 10 minutes during the entire cook time.  I don't really change anything with the recipe except I used reduced sodium soy sauce.  The boys love this.  If I have thighs in the house this is what I will do with them.

Excellent recipe ... next time I will back it at 400 for 30 mins skin down, then drain the juices from the meat ... then brush on the sauce, both sides, with skin side up bake for 20 mins and then brush sauce again and bake for another 13 mins ... let meat cool and then sauce your chicken on each plate .. I served with Au Gratin Potatoes and Iced Tea ... fantastic meal, great recipe ... Everyone loved it ...

I doubled the sauce and had more than enough.  I used a whole cut-up chicken (we raise our own) and it filled a big roaster pan.  Our birds are big! (6-7 # dressed) This made dinner for 2, another dinner for 2 and 2 lunches with rice, broccoli and carrot salad.  Yumm!!

I did not have any ginger, so I used Chinese 5-Spice in the sauce.  Great flavor.  This recipe is a keeper, and pretty quick to make.  My bird took about 1 1/2 hours, but just because of the size and some of the pieces were not completely thawed.  I did not baste, but just turned the pieces every 20 minutes.

Great recipe.  I use tamari sauce rather than soy sauce so that it's gluten free.  I double the recipe, skip the water, and  make the sauce a day ahead of time so I can marinate the chicken (thighs or breasts both work fine) in the sauce for a day before baking.  I also don't cover the pan with foil as I want the sauce to thicken slightly as it cooks.  I serve this with rice to soak up the extra sauce.  I get requests to make this dish!  Thanks Marian!

This was good but we thought it a bit too salty. I used half white, half brown sugar and definitely low sodium soy sauce. Doubled the sauce recipe and used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into thirds. Cook at 375 in a foil lined pan for approx 30 minutes

I've made this every week for the last 2 months and it's a great base. If you follow the recipe to a T and you'll be golden, once you get comfortable play with other flavors in there like sriracha, more ginger, adding pineapples

Good recipe but a little too salty. Next time I will use light soya sauce as I didn't have any this time. I ended up using 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of all white. After the sauce thickened I tasted it and was too salty so I added 1/4 cup water and a tbsp more brown sugar and tasted a lot better. I also switched out 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts(cut into halves) instead of the thighs, spread in a 13x9 dish and poured all the sauce on top. Covered with foil and baked at 400* for 35 minutes. Served over rice. The husband loved it!

Really good, we used Bragg's liquid aminos in place of soy sauce and used fresh grated ginger. Kids ate it up.

This recipe is awesome! I used skinless thighs and skinless legs (dark meat girl) and seasoned the chicken with red pepper and garlic powder. Used low sodium soy and doubled sauce. Glad I did this was so tasty. This recipe is a keeper!

This was outstanding. My husband (the ultimate grill master) is against baking chicken, says there is no way to do without it coming out dry - this recipe changed his mind.  I followed the recipe exactly (did not double the sauce like many said - don't do it - you are just making it unhealthier, it's not necessary) and it came out fantastic.  I did cook at a lower heat with foil on for the first half hour. Did not have the issues that others did with the pan being any harder to clean than normal (but I bet that's because they doubled the sauce and/or didn't grease the pan enough). THE FLAVOR of this dish is outstanding. It took awhile for the sauce to thicken, but it was worth it and I will make it again.

I substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of the 1/2 cup white sugar, cooked my chicken covered with foil for the first thirty minutes then uncovered and flipped the chicken over to the other side and finished cooking (another thirty minutes).  AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS and everyone always loved it!!  I absolutely adore this recipe and will continue to use and share it! :)

I made this tonight and it was yummy. I used half regular soy sauce and half light soy sauce because I ran out the of the light. I made the sauce without the water and corn starch, poured it over the chicken and baked it. When the chicken was done I added the water/corn starch mixture to thicken up the sauce. I also used half brown sugar and half regular sugar. Will make again

Made it twice with drumsticks and thigh (skin and skinless). Just double the recipe for extra sauce. Only addition was some chives or spring onion and sesame seeds. Husband loves it and a friend said it was like his mom's cooking!

I doubled the sauce, I used fresh ginger and some crushed red pepper for heat, marinated chicken in it for 6 hours. It was not thick 
put chicken in long pan with foil on the bottom .
Boiled the sauce as I marinated the chicken in it. 
It took around 20 min's and than thicken. Than cooked the chicken with some of the thick sauce. TIME IS WAY OFF ON SAUCE
 I cooked it on 400 for 30 min's half way I turned the chicken and put more sauce on
Than at the end of 30 min's put the oven on boil to get them nice and brown.To me, this was the key.

This was sooo very good. The only thing I did differently is that i  pureed a pint of my fresh canned pineapple grown here in hawaii. There is a difference in how the pineapple tastes here than on the mainland. I would never use canned pineapple unless it is canned fresh at home. If you are able to get a whole pineapple where you live then just puree approx 1/4th of it. You will be amazed! Everything ele i followed the directions to a T. The natural fresh sweetness from the pineapple fixed the saltiness of the soy!

My family enjoyed this.  I lined the pan with foil and covered for 20 minutes.  I doubled the sauce ingredients except for the sugar and 
subbed brown sugar for white. I also added 2 tsps of dried mustard.  Served with rice and broccoli and it was really good.  I was expecting the sauce to be a little more baked on.  It seemed that the chicken simmered in the sauce.

Winner in my house!  Everyone in the family liked it.  Anything that my picky kids eat without complaining gets 5 stars in my house.  This was easy to make and had great flavor.  I used boneless skinless chicken.

This was really good! I should have read the reviews because you have to double up on the recipe and use lite soy sauce.  I do plan on cooking it again but will cook the slow cooker and see how that comes out.

Used slightly less than 1/4 tsp black pepper, and I'm glad I did.  Added less than 1/4 tsp Sesame Oil, and I don't believe I added enough to make a difference.  Or maybe that small amount is just right.  

Had just bought 7 large boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Cut them in half.  Cooked casserole for  60 minutes total,  last 30 minutes basting every 10.  When I took pan out of oven, added rest of sauce.  I will make this again, and probably make the sauce many times again, I can picture it on pork.

Definitely double the sauce. I used lite soy sauce to cut the salt, increased the garlic to 3 cloves, used fresh minced ginger and halved the amount of sugar.  I did boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs. Cooked for 30 minutes.  Turned out awesome!

I've made this for a large gathering on two occasions, and it got rave reviews both times. A friend told me it was the best chickens she had ever tasted. I've also made it in the crock pot and it turned out fabulous.

This was really good! When I first made this a few weeks ago, I made it just as written and it turned out great, but I thought it was a little tedious basting so often. To simplify the cooking process on my second go around, I went ahead and prepared the sauce (do not cook it) and set aside, then took the chicken thighs and cut into small pieces. I cooked the chicken in two batches using about 1 tsp oil until the chicken had a nice golden color and was slightly crisp on the outside. After all the chicken was cooked, I put it all in the pan together and started adding in little bit of the sauce each time and stirring until it caramalized. Perhaps this method sounds more tedious but actually it's pretty simple and cut the cooking time in half. I also halved the sugar to 1/4 cup and used brown sugar instead. This recipe is a winner and this is one I would be proud to serve to our guests for dinner!

I was worried the sauce would never thicken up, but but it did in the baking dish and turned out pretty well but I'll likely double the sauce next time.

Loved the flavor, but it was way too salty. Will make it again but either cut the soy in 1/2 or use Lite. Lined the pan in foil, but did not cover. Cooking time was 45 min.

I really like this recipe. It was the first time making a sauce from scratch so I was a little hesitant when I smelled the vinegar, that it would be too over powering in the recipe....to my surprise it was not, the vinegar smells awful but is perfect in the recipe...I made the sauce as directed and used boneless thin breasts and baked at 375 for 15 min then flipped and cooked another 20 mins and kept basting through the cooking time...perfect! I will be making again.

This is a keeper!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs (6) . I used 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of light brown sugar,  and I also used lite Soy sauce. Those were the only changes I made and followed the directions. YUM! YUM! I doubled the sauce now I have extra sauce to make this again very soon! Thanks for sharing!

Our family's favorite recipe. Made it dozens of times. Since first making it we have had to go gluten free. There isn't anywhere that we can eat that has gluten free teriyaki. So this is our favorite gluten free dish! Substitute soy sauce with gluten free soy sauce and it's perfect! We don't change anything else to the recipe except for doubling it!

This recipe is divine!!! My boyfriend and his father couldn't get enough. I will definitely be making this again. I will also try this sauce with other meats, to see how we like that as well. The only thing that I did differently was added more garlic, this is because I am a garlic lover. Thank you for this great recipe. :)

No leftovers! I did read reviews and doubled the sauce. Well worth it. Cooking time was 1 hour at 375 and 20 minutes at 425 to get a good thick sauce. Don't bother basting just flip in pan every 20 minutes. I used thighs and meat was very tender. Serve with white jasmine rice and broccoli. It will be a once a month dinner for our family. Thanks!!!

This recipe was very easy to make and my husband even complimented my efforts.  I had to reduce the servings because there are only two of us.  When I reduced the servings there wasn't really enough of the sauce to keep the chicken moist so it got a little dry and it was really dark.  Hmmm?

The SO didn't say this was the best chicken I had ever made; he said it was the best he had ever eaten! What I think is important is that the recipe was written for bone in thighs. While, of course, it can be adapted to any cut, as soon as you change that you must change time and temperature. The temperature is so high (425) because you are supposed to baste every ten minutes. Opening the oven this often results in the necessity of a higher temp. I set my timer in ten minute increments, basting each time and flipping after 30 minutes. The results were flavorful, tender, and juicy. People who lowered the oven temperature (and used a bone-in cut) couldn't possibly have followed the technique of basting in the recipe because the chicken wouldn't have cooked thoroughly. You thought it was tasty before? Try it the way it was written! Yum!

I loved it. I did read how a few people adjusted the amount of soy sauce which I was going to do but I totally forgot. Not that it mattered because ours wasn't salty at all. I like to cover my meat in foil to make it juicy but my guy doesn't like to cover it. We didn't cover it and it dried up the outside of the meat but the inside was juicy. Next time I would cover plus maybe turn the oven down to 400 degrees instead. The juices dried up so we had no sauce to put over the rice. Will make again but will marinate the meat over night in the fridge next time.

Made exactly as directed.   Sauce should be thicker than I had it (mine was like ketchup consistency)  should have been more like syrup.  Maybe should have marinated to get flavor through out the chicken instead of just on top.  Hubby gave 3 star, rest of family a 4

Absolutely flipping delicious. I made a little more sauce than called for to pour over rice. Will definitely be lining the baking pan next time to aid with clean up. I'm going to be scrubbing this thing for hours...

Loved it.  Dipped the chicken in the sauce.  Then baked for 30 minutes brushed sauce on both sides.  Still keeping some sauce for later.  After another 30 minutes chicken was done.  Brushed more sauce on it.  It's a keeper!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious, one of my favorites and going in my file!  I was only sorry that I hadn't made more!  I did double the sauce only because I love sauce, not because it needed it.  Very tasty and very juicy!!

There's a lot of salt in this recipe; it might be wise to use a low-salt soy sauce if possible.

Sweet and saucy!  Omitted all of the spices and it tasted great.  Super easy and fast.  Watch the oven as it burns very quickly near the end of cooking time.

Delicious!  Much better than anything bottled and very easy.  My family loved it!  Followed the recipe almost exactly. The only change I made was to use brown sugar rather than white and loved the results!  YUM!

This is a great sauce to use with anything!  Chicken, fish, steak.  You can use it as a marinade or I stir fried it with chicken, onions and broccoli and it tasted delish!  My kids said it smell like Panda Express in the house :)   I normally double or triple the recipe so that I don't run out in the middle of cooking.

I. LOVED. EVERY. BITE. Wish I would have bought more chicken. Maybe in the top ten best things I ever made. I had 4 thighs and would double the sauce with 6 or more.  I used brown sugar and doubled the garlic and the sauce thickened with no problems.  I also had lite soy sauce & don't regret it. Sweet & salty enough for me. Will make again & again.  Thanks for submitting.

The recipe was good but not great. Ran out of sauce and it started to burn on the pan. Made with both boneless breast and boneless thighs and the dark meat is definitely better. I might try this recipe again with low sodium soy sauc.

I will definitely make this one again. The only things I did differently..lower the oven temperature to 375F and used chicken breasts. Next time I may use chicken thighs, at the noted temperature and see how that goes. My family LOVED it!

Great recipe and super easy, the sauce was delicious.  However, you might want to put tinfoil on the bottom of your casserole dish before you add the chicken and sauce, because it's tough to clean after baking for an hour; but totally worth it.  My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.

A winner!  I used low sodium soy sauce. Double the sauce, but instead of doubling the white sugar, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar.  I lined my pan with heavy duty foil then poured most of the thickened sauce over bone-in thighs (skin removed). Cooked, covered with foil for 30 minutes, removed foil, poured remainder of sauce over and bake another 20-30 minutes.

I thought this had a great taste! A little tangy for me but my family loved it. I doubled the recipe and used a few chicken breasts cut up into strips. Then I just mixed the sauce with the chicken strips in the baking dish.  I was being lazy and didn't want to have to do a lot of brushing, turning etc. Cooked it one hr at 400 and BAM.....happy family! My mother in law tasted it and said it was the best she ever had. I actually went ahead and made another round of sauce for her to take home and use.

It was pretty tasty and 4 of my 5 kids ate it, which is a big deal in this house. My husband said it was so so, which is not unusual for him. The recipe called for 12 skinless thighs but I used 9 legs and removed the skin before cooking. The flavor was good but the meat wasn't "fall off the bone". I think this could be remedied by cooking the chicken in the crockpot for 4-6 hrs and THEN baking for 30 min, basting with the glaze every 10 min. The original recipe calls for baking 30 min, basting every 10, then turn over and repeat for another 30 min. It's an easy recipe but not one to make last minute.

I always like to make it just like the recipe says first, then decide if I want to change it to better suit my taste. I did this one just like it said except I did add a little red pepper flakes because I like the contrast of sweet with a little kick of heat. We really loved it!  It's a keeper for sure!  Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!

"Killer over the top" was my husband's comment. I would give it a six if I could. I followed the recipe but followed some of the review suggestions. I doubled the sauce (thank goodness!!), used 1/2 c. brown sugar, and because I had so much sauce, I layered 1/2 of the sauce onto my foil-lined pan, put in the thighs, then poured the rest of the sauce over it. I don't like cleaning my brush. I cooked at 375 degrees, skin side up, for 30 minutes, turned it, cooked it 20 minutes skin side down, then turned it for 20 more minutes. It was beautiful!!!!! Thank you so much. ~ Linda

This is a family favorite! I do agree with doubling the sauce especially when you have to continue to brush it on while cooking. Definitely line your pan with foil and use non stick spray so you don't have a huge mess on your hands (this just happened the other night when I ran out of foil, not fun). Thanks!

Ok, I am new to cooking and this recipe was very easy to prepare and really boosted my confidence to cook more. I followed all the steps but made an additional pan of sauce because i love my teriyaki chicken to be drenched. The taste of the sause was rich and yummy, my family loved it. I would definitely add this to my family menu for years to come!!!!

I have made this in the oven and in the crockpot. Both times, the recipe turned out great. With the crockpot, I threw four frozen chicken breasts in and topped it with 1.5 times the sauce and let it cook on low for 8 hours. Great recipe.

This was delicious-very tender and moist.  I cooked chicken wings, using low sodium soy sauce and about 1/4 less sugar.  I also used foil on the bottom of the pan, which eliminated a major scrubbing of the pan afterwards, and covered the chicken in foil while cooking.

This was really tasty.  It didn't need to bake 1 hour, though.  Next time, I will bake at 350 to 375 and start checking for doneness after 30 minutes or so.  I will also USE FOIL!

I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs, and it turned out really great! The sauce was delicious and went really well over rice. Definitely going to make this one again!

Very good! My family loves this dish!! I made it exactly like the recipe. The only thing is cleaning up the dish the chicken was baked. It was horrible to clean!! Next time I will use a foil pan.

Great. I found this when I was about to prepare chicken breasts instead of thighs... But that did not matter, they turned out fabulous, well with a good teriyaki base like this you can't go wrong no matter what you prepare. This is now also part of my daughters favorites when done veggie way e.g. with falafel. Thanks for this recipe!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I have made this for the third time and each time I love it more!  I have never been a fan for teriyaki, but this recipe has changed my mind.  I make it at least once a week with frozen chicken breasts and what ever left over condiments I have.  Thank you for sharing, I will never buy teriyaki sauce again.  I did change one thing, I used Tamari sauce instead of soy sauce.  Tamari sauce is still a soy sauce but a much more concentrated.

This a AWSOME, better than take out!! I had to bake the chicken first because my sister didn't think she would like it. I put the sauce on each serving and it was great. My sister did like it.  The sauce is great and I use it for stir fry dishes also. My husband loved it asks for it often.

I will admit, I was a bit skeptical about this recipe at first. As I began cooking the sauce,I honestly thought it smelled horrible. But as it turned out, it tasted FANTASTIC! I used 1/4c. white sugar and a little less than 1/4c. brown sugar as another reviewer suggested. I also put foil on the pan for easy clean up, and covered it for half an hour and uncovered the other half hour. I basted both sides of the thighs before i put them in, again after a half hour, then after 15 minutes, and then when I took them out. I served it with homemade garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Turned out awesome, and everyone loved it! Definitly a keeper!

This recipe is very good! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs which turned out very tender. I did double the sauce. My very picky kids loved it.

Excellent flavor and extremely juicy!  I lowered the temp to 375 and doubled the sauce.  I reduced the sauce just a bit and then poured part over the chicken before covering and baking for 15 minutes.  I finished reducing the remaining sauce, uncovered the chicken and basted every 5-10 minutes for another half hour or so.  Great recipe to make a very inexpensive cut of chicken into a wonderful meal!

I triple the sauce,  throw it all into a skillet  and mix it.  I turn it on medium low, Then after I cut up 6 boneless skinless chicken breast into bite size pieces I toss it in to the bubbling sauce and let it simmer until the meat is cooked.  I serve this with 3 Cups white rice a bag of steamed veggies and a box of Tai pei spring rolls. Everyone loves it !

Soooo easy.  I followed recipe except I used half brown/half white sugar, added more garlic and a pinch of five spice. I just dipped each chicken thigh in sauce pan to coat; the sauce was exactly enough for 12 trimmed thighs, which fit snuggly a 9x9 lightly oiled stone dish.

Absolutely loved it! The only alterations I did were that I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and lite soy sauce.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and would make it again.  Thank you, Marian!

Made it exactly as is, with the exception of the amount of chicken simply because all I had was 1kg, in result there was more sauce.  But this was delicious!!  So perfect and so easy!!  New fave!

The only change I made was to use thawed, boneless, skinless chicken thighs. They required less cooking time. A definite keeper.

We followed the ingredients exactly. I made the sauce & used it as a marinade for 5-6 hours. We took the thighs out of the marinade and put them in out smoker for about an hr. I put the marinade on the stovetop to thicken. When the chicken was just about done we brushed it on the thighs. SO very good!

Yum! The only change is that I dumped the sauce on the chicken and baked that way. Hubs loved this over bread too.

Turned out GREAT. I made as-is except for two things. I used 4 cloves of garlic, and chose a low-sodium soy sauce. Definitely double the sauce, though! It's already saved to my recipe box and the hubby said he definitely wants it again. Success!

Super easy and really good. I was not willing to bake for an hour because we were really hungry so I browned the chicken and then mixed the sauce in a measuring cup and brought it to a boil and simmered it with the chicken until the chicken was cooked. The sauce was nice and thick and there was plenty to serve over the chicken, rice I made and there will was extra sauce for leftovers. Instead of thighs I cooked up about eight chicken tenderloins because that's what I had. That's probably why I had so much sauce but I like extra sauce for rice and so my leftovers aren't dry. If you're using breasts or tenderloins this is plenty of sauce for 8-10 tenderloins or equivalent chicken breasts and rice.

Delicious, sticky, sweet, perfect teriyaki chicken! Served it with an Asian noodle salad (also from this site) and it cut the salad's sour perfectly! I also used fresh ginger- a must with Asian cooking!

This is such a good recipe. The sauce is great. I use chicken legs instead of thighs. I think it gives a better meat to sauce ratio. :-)

Excellent dish... made it tonight, and really liked the flavor.  Everybody in my family liked it.  I didn't remember to baste every ten minutes, and it still tasted great.  I had about a cup of sauce left over -- because as others suggested, I doubled the sauce ingredients.  I don't think that was really necessary ... but hey, I've got enough sauce to do this again!  Definitely a keeper.

This is very good and easy. Chicken stays juicy and flavorful. You could really tweak the sauce any way you want. I used boneless chicken breasts, poured the sauce over top and baked it at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes, basting every so often. I also add a about a 1/4 cup of apple juice to the sauce and use half soy sauce, half water instead of the full amount of soy sauce. If there are more than 3 chicken breasts, I double the sauce. Serve with rice and snap peas.

I could drink this. I've tried many teriyaki recipes and I love this one only.
I use a bread pan to cook just three boneless, skinless chicken thighs immersed in this, and only for 30 minutes total.
Then, we pair it with the simple, sweet, coconut rice.
Perfect.

Turned out amazing! I did make a couple of alterations. Changed the sugar to half white, half brown sugar and used the low sodium soy sauce. Very versatile - I'll definitely be making this again.

This recipe is wonderful!!! The teriyaki sauce is incredible. I used low sodium soy sauce, and two chicken hind quarters I had at hand. I removed the skin and deboned them. Baked them in the toaster oven for 30 minutes, basting and turning half way through. I served it with rice and a side of green beans with vinagrette. I added a few drops of sesame oil to the left over sauce and refrigerated it for future use. Both, my husband and son asked me to make this dish more frequently.

Excellent!  The kids loved it.  Ate all of it (I doubled the recipe) and with the addition if some grated a
Orange peel and some juice it tastes like restaurant orange chicken!  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

I used the same recipe except with brown sugar instead of white and 3 tbs flour instead of cornstarch. I also only used 4 chicken thighs instead of twelve. There is lots of sauce to go around and because it basically surrounds the meat I only flip it at 30 mins and don't have to check in on it and it comes out perfectly. The only thing I would say is maybe marinate the chicken in this over night cause the outside was flavorful but the insides were a bit bland.

I didn't change anything about this recipe except that I used chicken breasts and low sodium soy sauce. I used a digital meat thermometer to monitor the temperature until perfect. I made sure to baste it every ten minutes and it took about 40 minutes to bring it to temperature. With brown rice and sesami seed oil roasted veggies, it was a good healthy dinner.

This recipe was excellent! I didn't double the sauce and it was ample. I did use fresh ginger instead of ground and only basted every 15 minutes instead of 10. My husband, who doesn't like chicken thighs normally, said it was one of the best chicken dishes he's ever had!

I absolutely love this recipe. I make this for my family every other week or so, and it's amazing every time. 

Pair this dish with a nice Risotto and some asparagus...unbelievable.

I really like this recipe, but like a lot of other teriyaki chicken recipes, it just has that weird "twang" to it along with the weird after taste. but all in all, it wasnt bad!

This was so great! I am not much of a teriyaki fan but my husband loves it so I decided to give it a shot! I am very pleased with the result and the ability to customize the flavor.

I doubled the sauce, as suggested, and only used brown sugar. I did use low sodium soy sauce, as well. I poured most of the sauce over boneless breast tenderloins. I baked them in a foil covered dish at 375 for 30 minutes, flipped them over, and poured on the rest of the sauce and baked for another 15 minutes. I turned the broiler on for about 5 minutes to caramelized the top a bit, too.

I served this with fried rice and broccoli and it was so yummy and so easy!! I have a new perspective on teriyaki thank you!!

Both my husband and I love this and he's very picky. Definitely double the sauce if making 12 thighs and cover with foil while baking. Thought of substituting the thighs the first time, but so glad I didn't. I'll be making this for years to come!

I love the sauce. I turned it into a skillet dish, with four chicken breasts and rice.  I cooked the chicken in the skillet til almost done.  I added the sauce and cooked for 5 minutes til sauce starts to thicken then add 2 cups of cooked rice stir for  5 minutes.

I love this sauce.  It is so easy to make and always a crowd pleaser.  I don't always follow the chicken part of the recipe, sometime I use chicken breasts and precook all the chicken and then pour the sauce over.  And if I'm feeling extra fancy I pop it under the broiler for a couple seconds just to make everything sticky and delicious!!

Delicious! Without much effort, you can have a yummy terryaki sauce that didn't have to come out of a jar.  The sauce is delicious, but, as other reviewers have said, line the pan with foil or you will have a black, sticky mess.  I have made this many times.  It's my favorite chicken dish.

I thought it was good. My husband thought it was great. My three-year-old ate it--WITHOUT KETCHUP--so I'm deeming this one a hit. I assume you could find a bottled version of the sauce but it would probably have a billion preservatives in it so I like to make my own. 
The sauce that touched the sides of the pan burned and made my kitchen smell something awful, but the sauce on the chicken and that we used to coat the chicken was delicious and not burned at all. 
We don't eat ANY sugar at all and so I used honey instead. But other than that, I stuck to the recipe exactly.

Great recipe, I didn't use he garlic (because I am allergic). But it was fantastic!  I found he cooking time was a little long and mine was done in about 50 minutes but that could be because my chicken thighs were small ( I used hormone free, trimmed thighs).    They were tender and delicious.  I will make this one again!

This was delicious!!  I made it tonight, and was totally pleased.  I took others advice and doubled the sauce.  Also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Didn't have many thighs, so I used legs and wings; turned out great!

Second time I made chicken quarters in slow cooker. 2 hrs on High plus 3 hrs on Low. For the last 40 min I added green and red  pepper, diced pineapple from the can, and onion. I made double amount of sauce following all instruction, but much less on sugar. Came out just OK. Next time will bake in oven.

Maybe I didn't let it thicken enough but my sauce was on the bland side.  It wasn't awful.  Everyone ate it and one son went back for more.  I'll keep the recipe and maybe cook it down a little bit more.

It's really hard to mess up,this recipe. Awesome every time.
I've made it according to this recipe to a t. Also used chicken wings instead(only diff is the cooking time, about 5-10min less.
Last night made 28 wings.drums frozen, with slight less brown sugar and soy bc that's all we had, still turned out great.
Tonight , drunk cooking, cooked wings with garlic powder, and added dash of cinnamon and chili ..with all the asked for ingreds, Tasted great.

I made it using chicken thighs and  many of the suggestions here, doubled the sauce, less sugar, less soy sauce, added some low sodium chicken broth to equal out the liquid.  Added some currants to the sauce.  It gave it more eye appeal.  Poured sauce over all and covered it for 30 minutes and then uncovered for remaining time.  Really delicious.

Very good.  Recipe makes enough sauce for up to 6 breasts.  Lining the pan with foil is a must to help with clean up.  I used fresh ginger which adds a nice flavour.  My family loved it.

I was very impressed with how easy the sauce was to make! I'm new at cooking and this was really really easy!  I didn't cook it as long after I turned it over because I didn't need too. The only bad I have about it was that the chicken toughened up a lot over night so it wasn't nearly as good the next day and my house reeked of teriyaki sauce that night and through to the next day, but other than that... It was amazing! My friend enjoyed it as well! I also paired it with some garlic green beans which was nice. I am looking forward to making this for my husband! :D

Well, I doubled the sauce as one reviewer suggested, but it made it too liquidy.  There wasn't anything clinging to the chicken.  It was more like a marinade.  I double the corn starch too when I saw that it was not going to glaze.  Disappointed!

We cooked this last evening.  I used boneless skinless thighs.  I doubled the sauce recipe and I used about a one and a half inch piece of fresh ginger which I minced.  I also doubled the garlic.  Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I cooked the sauce for a few minutes in a saucepan to blend all ingredients, then put half the sauce in a crockpot with the chicken thighs.  I cooked it for 5 hours on high. It was watery, so I removed the chicken with a slotted spoon, served on top of brown rice with a side of stir fried vegetables.  I ladled the remaining sauce (which was now very thick) on top of the chicken and garnished with chopped scallions.  There was a lot of food on the serving plate and it was totally gone!  This is probably the BEST teriyaki recipe I've ever had!  My husband loved it!  I'm a very picky eater, everything I eat has to be very flavorful and robust and the recipe really fit the bill!  I think everyone would love this and you will never ever want bottled Terriyaki sauce again!

I lined the glass pan with foil and used four half chicken breasts. I cooked on 375 for about thirty minutes and the chicken was cooked to perfection. My S/O and I both thought the sauce was way to sweet though (and I can eat sweet/salty foods fine). I'm not sure if it was the vinegar, the soy sauce, or the combination. Nice recipe though if altered a bit!

This didnt work for us AT ALL! It was tangy and bland and just plain weird NOT at all like ANY Teriyaki I have EVER had ... ( and I was born and raised in Hawaii). I ended up dumping the sauce from this recipe and using my own teriyaki sauce after thickening it.

Really loved this!!! Instead of baking I used my crock pot so not to heat up the kitchen. Doubled the recipe for the sauce and poured over the meat and cooked on high for 4 hours. Meat was tender as ever. I pulled some of the sauce out and added water chestnuts and cooked for a little bit and added to my own plate. Wishing I had snow peas and a few other veggies to go along with this. Served over white rice.

This is a great teriyaki sauce. Rich and very flavorful. I made boneless chicken tenderloins and baked them for about 20 min. Served the chicken on top of Goya yellow rice mixed with peas and corn, it was a great dinner. Thank You for sharing.

Double the sauce. I used lite soy sauce and didn't think it was too salty. Great easy dish!! Going into the regular dinner rotation.

I made this for the first time yesterday. As always, when making a recipe for the first time, I followed it exactly-well almost exactly.  I truly intended to, but forgot the vinegar & didn't realize it until I was putting the chicken in the oven. I also accidentally used my 1/3 measuring cup for the sugar instead of my 1/2 cup & put the sauce on the chicken all at once. I inadvertently marinated it for 30 minutes as I was distracted by being on the phone and/or got confused by reading so many different reviews. 

I used regular soy sauce & we did not find it salty at all. I didn't  salt the breasts. It was a little sweet but I am sure if I had added the vinegar it would have cut that down.

In any case the sauce was really good, I love the stickiness of the glaze and will definitely make it again but double the sauce. I am sure that if I pay attention & follow it exactly it will be perfect next time. I did sprinkle with sesame seeds as a garnish but don't consider that changing a recipe. Definitely line the pan with foil!

My oven is convection & bakes a bit hotter than normal.  When I set the temperature at 425 it automatically dropped to 400 so that is what I cooked them at. I used two skinless, boneless breasts that were quite large so I cut them in half lengthwise. I turned them over & basted at 10 minutes & then again at 20 minutes.  Chicken was done at 30 minutes & very juicy. Enough for two people & still had one piece of breast left over.

Thanks for sharing Marian!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and also chicken legs.  The legs came out great, but the breasts were tough and chewy using this recipe.  I see others who used chicken breasts cut down on temp and time, so I'll have to do that next time.  I think the thighs would have been more tender.

Loved this recipe!  Even my 2 year old gobbled it up! I've made it twice and each time followed the recipe and doubled the sauce. First time, I accidentally poured all the sauce over my chicken thighs....oops. The second time I followed the baste and brush part. Both hubby and I agreed we actually liked the accidental method more! The pain was a beast to clean that time but the sauce glazed and became so rich and gooey. I'll be dumping on sauce and getting my scrub gloves on next time I make this :) served with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. Definitely a keeper!

30 minutes covered, 25 minutes uncovered--foil lined pan. 1/3 cup sugar. Everything else the same.
6 boneless skinless thighs. Very good. 5 pieces for 2.

VERY good and a hit with the kids! I stuck very close to the recipe ingredients but I did use 1+ tsp grated fresh ginger (powdered ginger is better for baked goods like gingerbread). I also used boneless chicken thighs and a BLSL breast to keep the calories lower for me. Using boneless cut the cook time in half. The chicken thighs were more flavorful and moister than the breasts. This was a very easy recipe to make- a keeper!

I made this for me and my husband. It was AMAZING! The first time I made it I used chicken thighs which was good but neither me nor my husband are fans of dark meat. The second time I made it I used boneless chicken breasts - it turned out SO good!

Really great recipe. Instead of soy sauce I used Braggs Liquid Aminos.  It really cuts down on the saltiness. (It may not be salty enough for some).  Also, is anyone having trouble with water in the chicken? I poured the sauce on top, covered with foil and when I removed the foil, the sauce was runny not thick.

This is an amazing teriyaki sauce recipe! It was easy to make and I already had all the ingredients. Like many others, I used brown sugar instead of white, due to personal preference. This sauce is now a staple in my recipe box!

Love this recipe!  The chicken turned out really juicy and tender, not dry at all like baked chicken often is for me.  I used boneless skinless breasts cut into large pieces, and per some of the reviews here, I baked at 375 for 20 minutes, flipped them over, then 20 more minutes (basting along the way).  I also broiled for a few minutes at the end to brown them a bit.  I also doubled the sauce, and reserved some to use over rice and broccoli (though there's enough at the bottom of the pan to use that way, too).  Delicious with steamed broccoli!

This recipe was very quick and easy to make.  The sauce was delicious.  I used 6 thighs and 6 legs, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make again.

So much flavor, and so tender! This recipe filled the void when I was craving Hawaiian food. I found a recipe for the Hawaiian pasta salad (also on this website) that paired perfectly with the chicken.

I have made this more than once, the only thing I really changed was using a low sodium soy sauce. I like my food flavorful, and using low sodium did not seem to take away from the dish at all. If you wanted to use LESS low sodium soy sauce, it could probably would be okay too, I haven't tested it out but I'm sure it would be just as flavorful. I definitely recommend making it at least once.

This really is a great recipe!  I used 12 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and used suggestions from other comments to replace the cider vinegar with pineapple juice and the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also used low sodium soy sauce as that's what I had on hand.  It was very tasty and my kids (3 and 5) loved it!  I doubled the sauce and would do the same next time even with less chicken because it was good as a sauce for rice and extra juice for dipping the chicken in. Thanks for another tasty recipe!!

Made this last night for the family.  Like most of the "most helpful" reviews suggested, I doubled the sauce (using a combo of brown and white sugar).  Hubs said when I had his taste the sauce, "YEP, that's Teriyaki sauce!".  I think next time I'll cut back on the sugar (in the double sauce version) using 1/4 c of white and 1/4 cup of brown. I think I'll also cook down the sauce even more next time.  Once my chicken/sauce done baking (400deg for 30 minutes), I added the contents to a sautee pan, 1 bag of stir fry veg, and stir fried up some rice noodles. Delish!

This sauce is unbelievable.  It's almost as if someone used to work in a Japanese restaurant and stole the secret family teriyaki recipe.  I've used this sauce in many different ways.  Just great.

It was very good sauce but don't cook it too long cause it will burn and the sauce will burn too.  I used chicken breast. So that's why. But it was tasty.

This is a fantastic recipe! I followed another commenter's advice and subbed real minced ginger for the ground, and added more garlic. I had 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs that cooked at 425 for 60 mins total (30 mins with foil on top; 30 mins without). I also just dumped the mixture on top and didn't worry about continually glazing it. Turned out perfect! This chicken was so juicy and tender, and the marinade so flavorful that I could not stop eating! Served with basmati rice... it was a real treat!

This was great! My husband said it tasted like something out of a restaurant. Used low sodium soy sauce, and just poured sauce over top instead of brushing it every 10 minutes. It also took a long time for the sauce to simmer, so I bumped it to 5, let it simmer, then bumped it to low. I just sped up the process.

Very good!  I used a little less sugar and instead of skinless thighs, I left the skin on, dipped in egg, rolled in flour and fried in oil to brown and crisp the skin.  Then put in a pan, basted with sauce and baked at 350 for half an hour, basting once again half way through.  I suppose this would be the less healthy version!  :)

Thanks, this tasted just like teriyaki, although I cut down on the sugar.  I am rating on flavor, not cooking technique, because I cooked it on the stove top.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone who has eaten it likes it even my picky brother! I do as others suggest and double the recipe halving the sugar between brown sugar and white. So much better than store bought teriyaki sauce! Thanks for sharing :)

Delicious! Everyone liked it. I baked 2 split breasts and 2 wings in half the sauce, sans cornstarch, and then added the rest 20 minutes before it was done, basting and turning so the chicken would be thoroughly coated. That way I did't have to wash as many dishes (I didn't cook the sauce on the stove, first). My husband thought it was a tad too sweet, but I thought it was perfect!

Too sweet. If you like that then it is great. Made with white rice and the sauce worked good with that.

Absolutely loved the flavor. Only used 4 skinless thighs for the amount of sauce, extra sauce was used to flavor the rice it was served with. Great with Asian veggies. Key is to keep basting these. Cleanup is not a snap though, but well worth the extra elbow grease. May consider low sodium soy sauce on next purchase.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and did half white and half brown sugar as someone else suggested and it was perfect. I also baked it in the sauce but after the first 20 minutes the sauce in the dish was starting to burn so I started over with a new pan and didn't add any extra sauce, only for basting.

I used brown sugar and low sodium soy sauce. This sauce tasted so good, but I just couldn't get it to stick to the chicken enough. I did reduce it down and also used corn starch. I will try this again and see if I can get it to stick better. I used chicken breasts.

I really like salt and this was very close to being too much for me. Use either low sodium soy or do not add additional salt. I will make again but will use less salt.

The Teriyaki sauce is amazing! We had just had baked chicken the night before, so I ended up cooking the chicken in the skillet, addded a bag of frozen stirfry veggies and made a stir fry with it instead. This was so simple to make and had much more flavor than store bought teriyaki sauce. We are big fans of stirfry, so we have found our new sauce. I did add some extra water (maybe 1/4 cup to the sauce as it had a very strong flavor. I waited to add the extra water over the stirfry and not when the sauce was thickening though.) This was a hit in our house! We will make it again.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  I used chicken breasts (4) and cut into thirds and put into a 8 x 8 baking dish.  I poured the sauce on top, baked at 400 for 15 minutes, stirred and baked an additional 20 minutes.  It turned out perfect.  The chicken was so tender you almost did not need a knife to cut.

Yum! I used boneless skinless thighs but I only had 6 so the sauce amount was perfect. This would be excellent with any chicken cut. Lined a 9 x 13 Pyrex with foil dumped the sauce over the chicken. Baked it covered with foil at 375 for about 25 mins and then removed the foil and baked for another 15. Perfect with brown rice and veggies! Thank you!

I agree that the sauce should be doubled and the temp reduced. I substituted allspice and flous for ginger and corn starch (none in the house, couldn't find my frozen fresh ginger...) and it was a big hit. Want to try it with beef soon. With this we will save trips to the Hawaiian BBQ place for teriyaki :)

Great recipe. As other reviews suggested we doubled the sauce.  We used chicken breasts but everything else  we followed as written. Since we used breasts we didn't need the full hour to cook.  Next time, I will line the pan with foil to avoid the messy cleanup that results from the sauce getting baked on the bottom and sides of the pan.

My family LOVED this chicken. Leftovers were used for burritos by adding chili powder to the de-boned chicken.  Both nights were a hit. A keeper!

Tried this recipe last night. Served with mashed potatoes & green beans. Used 4 chicken breasts and had Plenty of glaze. This is a simple weekday meal and one I believe I will make again. My only hesitation...This can be a Very Salty meal...I Really need to buy a bottle of low-sodium soy for recipes like this.

Excellent! Only had enough soy sauce to make a single batch but it turned out just fine. I also put foil on the bottom and covered for the first 30 min., applying more sauce occasionally. I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white. I would also suggest soaking the chicken in a brine at least 6hrs before cooking, does wonders for keeping it tender. I will make again.

I like this little easy recipe, the two things I left out was the sugar and the cider vinegar and it was still awesome.

I made a simple fried rice with peas and egg drop soup for sides.

A good homemade happy meal!

It's a perfect recipe as is, but I made two adjustment to make it perfect for the two of us. I tried this first as is with the minced garlic, I just think my mincing skills are sub par because the little pieces of garlic just seemed to stand out against what otherwise would be a perfect meld of ingredients. I found the sauce to be saltier than I would have liked too. So the next time (and all the times afterward) I've used powdered garlic (1/8th teaspoon) and low sodium soy sauce and it is just the most beautiful silky sticky sauce and incredibly delicious!

I've made this a couple of times now and love it! I use 6-7 chicken thighs instead of 12. For the sauce, I omit the tablespoon of water and instead add the grated rind and the juice from half an orange. I make 4 servings of white rice while the chicken is cooking. When the chicken is finished, I remove it from the pan and stir the rice into the sauce. I then serve the chicken on top of the rice and top each serving with some sliced green onions.

I just lived this recipe and it truly was delicious!! I did like a reviewer before me had and added 1/4c of white sugar and 1/2c of brown sugar. I didn't have any clove garlic so I substituted it with simply garlic powder.My plan was to put half into the pot with chicken and the other half during its duration, but I ended up, by mistake pouring it in there all @ once. So after about 35 mins, I simply rotated the legs, and then once more in about 15 mins after that. My bf rarely eats a lot of chicken but it really liked it and even had it for breakfast the next day. Great recipe indeed. Thank you

I have made this over and over for family and friends. It's super easy. The only modification I make is to double the sauce/marinade. It is absolutely delicious.  Everyone asks for the recipe every time!

Love this recipe! My husband said "it's so good we don't need to order Chinese food again, just make this." I did the recipe just as posted, using boneless & skinless thighs, and it turned out sweet and rich with flavor throughout. I would have to say its one of our top 10 recipes.

I used this sauce on a baked chicken, then on some steak strips another day.  Dinner was really quiet, lots of chewing faces.  One of my favorite new recipes.

My family loved this both times I made it and they would rate it 5 stars, however, I was a bit put off by the vinegar taste. May try balsamic vinegar or use less next time, but overall it is very good and very easy. Fresh ginger is always better than bottled. Definitely worth a try.

These are VERY good.  The only change that I made is that I doubled the sauce, and honestly I didn't need all the extra sauce. GREAT, give these a try.

My absolute favorite recipe. I usually use fresh ginger (2-3tablespoons grated) and gluten free Tamari instead of soy sauce (it's expensive but so much better). When weather allows we grill the chicken and serve with extra sauce. A family favorite!

This recipe is awesome. I do use boneless, skinless chicken thighs but another reviewer said that they had used chicken breasts which I can't wait to try. If I use 12 chicken thighs then I double the recipe. I highly recommend this recipe. It pleased my whole family

I followed the recipe just as written and it came out wonderful!  My son said "Best chicken ever" and he thinks he's a food critic!  I used a glass pan so after a good soaking it should be easy to clean up even though the sugar did burn up a little.  It was so tasty that it's worth it!  Thanks for sharing!

Very very good. I made it exactly except I doubled the sauce, used half white and half brown sugar. I threw in about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. My kids loved it. I will definitely make it again! Thanks

I have a hard time finding yummy allergy free food that me and my family can eat.  Fortunately this was one of those delicious recipes I was able to make with one adaptation and it worked exceptionally well for my family.  I am allergic to corn and can not have any of the teriyaki sauces from the store, but this one was better than any sauce I tried.  I substituted the cornstarch with potato starch and it was absolutely delicious.  The entire family enjoyed this dish.  Even my son who is tired of eating chicken enjoyed it.  This recipe is a keeper, thank you Marian!

Great recipe but next time try brown sugar instead of white and rice wine instead of cider that IS Teriyaki! A tblsp of sesame oil is optional for more of an Asian flare.

This is an amazing recipe; The only things I changed, was I let the chicken baste in about a cup of Soy Sauce, while I was making the sauce itself. Also, instead of coating the chicken every 10 minutes, I just poured the sauce in with the chicken and let them cook together for about 45 minutes. It was the juiciest and best tasting Teriyaki Chicken.

This is really good!  Everyone in my family loves it.  I have made it several times.  I make it with boneless chicken thighs, and double the sauce.  The sauce is so good, I have also used it on pork tenderloin in my slow cooker.

I've made this recipe 3 times and it's definitely one of my family's favorites. Even my 2 year old can't get enough of it! (and she's not a big meat eater)

This was very good as is, but I highly recommend covering the dish when you put it in the oven to avoid having it all burn to the bottom of the pan.

Great recipe! I doubled the sauce.  I brushed it on meat and BBQ'd it for 5 minutes on each side.  Cut the meat up into pieces and brushed more sauce on it.  I then put in the oven for 20 minutes on 350. Served with white rice. Used the extra sauce to put on top of rice. Excellent! There was no leftovers!

I used the crockpot and just mixed up the ingredients and added the boneless skinless chicken thighs whole (breaking them up when they were falling apart after cooking through).  I don't think it needed to cook 8 hours like I did, much less would've sufficed.  While I didn't think it tasted quite like teriyaki, it was tasty enough to qualify as Chinese food.  I served it over white rice and it was delicious to half my family.  I'm contemplating if I'll try it again.

I used only 1/3 cup soy sauce and replaced the 1/2 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I boiled it a little longer to make sure the sauce was thick.  I put it over three thinly sliced chicken breasts and baked for 30 minutes altogether, turning at the half-way point to make sure the sauce completely covered the chicken.  Because the sauce was thicker, I wasn't able to baste, but this wasn't a problem.  I found it to be still too salty, but not bad.  Next time, I will cut the soy sauce down to 1/4 cup and see how it goes.

Really great recipe!  The chicken comes out so delicious. Only thing is that I had to double the sauce. The amount wasn't enough. Definitely a favorite though!

I only used 4 thighs, but made all of the sauce.  Very good, but the whole house smelled like the sauce for hours afterwards.  The sauce that wasn't on the chicken burned in the pan.  The chicken was delicious!

:D A.W.E.S.O.M.E.!!! I used this sauce recipe w some cubed up bnls skls ckn breast I browned in a skillet w pepper and ckn bullion granules. Tossed in some grn onion and let it cook w the ckn in about the last 2 min, added the sauce, then served over noodles flavored w a little ckn bullion. Thank you so much for this recipe! I now can cook any variation of chinese brown sauce I want and feed the fam sooner, make it healthier, taste better, and its CHEAPER! Trying the sauce with a little oj for rice, shrimp, and broccoli tomorrow

Very good recipe. I would suggest using less soy sauce and less vinegar.  They gave it a bit of a salty taste. Otherwise, great recipe.

Very yummy and easy! I was lazy and just poured half the sauce on top of the chicken and then cooked for 25 minutes at 375. I then flipped the chicken, poured the rest of the sauce on top and cooked another 15 minutes. It would probably be better if basted regularly but it was yummy without doing that too. I also halved the amount of sugar and will probably use even less next time, it was very sweet! This would be delicious grilled!

Absolutely delish.  Served it with sautéed baby spinach with chopped fresh garlic in light olive oil and infused truffle oil.  Baked a large yam with butter, fresh ground nutmeg, cinnamon and NH maple syrup. Great cold night meal and really easy.

I made this one with chicken breasts, not thighs. Same temp but 15 mins per side, basting once on each side. Winner winner chicken dinner!! My son usually doesn't like the teriyaki thing but he liked this, so I'm counting it as a definite win!! Thanks Marian, I'm holding on to this one for sure!!

Line the casserole with heavy foil. Pound the breasts first, brown on both sides, then pour the sauce (doubled or tripled) over. Cover and bake at 375-400 for 30 minutes, take top foil off and continue baking for 15-20. Serve over rice.

Sauce was great, but needed a little more thickening. So I added 2 Tb of corn starch instead of one. Also in order not to dry out the chicken, must cover with a top of some nature; foil does a fine job.

The flavor was wonderful, but even though I doubled the sauce there still wasn't enough for all my chicken thighs.  I will make again, but I will be making a lot more of the sauce to go around.

Made this exactly as written and the flavor was great. The chicken thighs were super tender and none of us thought this was too salty. I was a bit concerned after tasting the sauce by itself, but after baking, the chicken had a nice glaze and the sauce had mellowed quite a bit. If you're looking for a quick and simple, inexpensive dinner to feed a bunch of people, this is it.

Could have used more sauce. The sauce, what little there was, was good, just needed more of it. Overall, it was good, paired with sautéed asparagus and long grain wild rice from Uncle Ben's.

This recipe was very good. My husband said that it tasted like it came out of a restaurant. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Will cook again.

This was delicious!! I served the chicken over white rice.  This recipe made just enough sauce to allow me to put a couple tablespoons of the sauce on the rice which I like to do.   I recommend placing the chicken skin side down first so that when you flip it at the half way point the skin will be up for the last 30 minutes of cooking.  Doing so results in a crisper skin when serving.   Thank you for sharing.

Amazingly delicious. Easy recipe. I think the sauce will be great for a stir fry version also.

Kids loved it. Will use boneless next time. Less messy. Tripled the sauce, loved it. Made 10 thighs. Keep basting and top with more sauce before serving over rice.

This is a fantastic sauce, unfortunately I didn't have the ginger :-( but even without it, the sauce turned out wonderful! Next time I make it I will take a closer look on other comments to spruce it up but it's a great starter base.

Great recipe! I made chicken breasts for dinner. Using others' suggestions: Doubled the sauce, added 2 more garlic clove, 1t fresh ginger, substituted brown sugar for the white, used low-sodium soy sauce. YUM! We'll be having this again.

This is my go-to recipe if I want something other than regular baked chicken.  Definitely better on dark meat chicken (sorry ppl who only eat chicken breast, this may not be for you lol) and I always double the sauce.  But definitely a keeper.  I will be feeding this to my future children lol

Great flavor. I cooked 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs in crockpot on high for 3 hrs. Drain juices, return chicken to crockpot. Then add cooked sauce.  Serve over brown rice.  Delicious!

I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but my sauce never thickened and there was barely any flavor. The chicken was still edible, and my 1 year old daughter enjoyed it. However, I will not be making this recipe again.

I'm only giving the recipe, as written, 4 stars because I found the vinegar was overpowering, but still tasty.  I don't know if our cider vinegar is more potent where we live.  Anyway, I cut the vinegar in half the next time and my family thought it tasted just like the restaurants, which is exactly what we wanted.  This is so easy to make and uses what I have in my kitchen, which I especially love.  No more bottled teriyaki sauce for us!!!

Sooo delicious! Let me start by saying I almost never do reviews, but this was so unexpectedly fantastic I really just had to. We are not huge fans of chicken on the bone, so I was looking for something that would make it more appealing. Wow, wow, WOW was this it! The only thing I did different was I subsituted the soy sauce with a jar of stir fry sauce because I was out of soy. It's much the same anyway. This tasted so much like the General Tso chicken out local chinese take out serves that I will never pay for takeout again.

Came out dry and slightly hard near edges of meat. An hour at that temperature seemed like a long time. I'm thinking my results were different than others because I did not have a 9 x 13 baking dish available, so cooked it on a foil lined cookie sheet....so no one else make that same mistake!  :(

I doubled the sauce as most suggested and also just poured half the sauce over the thighs and covered it while it cooked for 20 min. at 375. Then flipped them over and poured the rest of the sauce on cooking for another 15 min. Served with broccoli and rice. It was delicious!

This recipe is great! I tweaked it a bit based upon the suggestions - double everything. Change the white sugar to 3/4C and 1/4C brown, and I also added just under 1/4 cup of honey... OMG it's to die for. A favourite!!

This was the best teriyaki chicken recipe we've ever had!! Its well balanced. We use boneless skinless thighs when we make it. We usually dont eat dark meat, but it makes it so much more moist!! I make a double batch EVERY time because the sauce is SO yummy!! I use half regular soy sauce and half low sodium. But even if I used all regular soy sauce it would be just as amazing! Sometimes I will do regualr sugar and brown sugar. No matter what, you cant go wrong. You HAVE to try this!! Simply YUM!!! 5 stars, no doubt!

The sauce for this is amazing!  Way better than anything you can buy in a bottle.  I dont think ill use it on thighs again, took too much time trying to trim off all the fat.  Will use for chicken breast or tenders though.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out fantastic.  I used up every bit of sauce though, which was the perfect amount for us, but if your cooking for a large family, you might want to double it.

Fabulous!  I drained off a bit of liquid halfway through so the marinade would thicken and bake onto the chicken.

Perfect! I was going to give this 4 stars but I gave it 5 stars just because I'm glad Marian shared this, Thanks. This recipe wasn't flawless but with a little tweaking, it's great. The sauce would have been too salty with the 1/2 cup of soy sauce. No need to run buy low sodium soy, just cut the soy in half and replace the remaining liquid with water. This recipe will turn out tough via the cooking method recommended in this recipe. I personally did not want to stand over chicken and marinate every 10 minutes(this is why it takes so long and ends up tough) so I doubled the sauce to have enough to cover all of my chicken tenders (a WHOLE bag). I put them in a glass dish, covered with foil and baked for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. PERFECT! If you like to have thick glaze on top, save some of the glaze and after baking the chicken, increase oven temp to 425 and take the tenders out of the original dish and place them on a cookie sheet. Brush chicken with glaze and put them in for 5 minutes. Turn chicken and brush marinade on and cook for another 5 minutes. This way they turn out tender and saucy. This recipe is a keeper! My crew cleaned the entire dish!!

This recipe was okay. I made double the sauce and I was happy that I did. After 30 minutes of baking, the sauce was watered down from the water from the chicken. So I poured a lot of the water (grease) off and added the extra sauce. I think I will try this again with chicken breast the next time.

I got rave reviews from my family on this dish! I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and doubled the sauce. I didn't use all of the sauce with the chicken but left the excess to keep warm on the stove to drizzle over rice and veggies. I intend to try the sauce again later, but on salmon. It's definitely a keeper!

Soooo awesome and easy!! Followed it to a T and all I did differently was I poured the mixture into a ziplock bag and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and let it marinade for a few hours. Baked beautifully!! Less time about half an hour turning every 15 minutes. Man! Everyone wanted more so I made more tonight for dinner! Awesome with mashed potatoes with Parmesean cheese and asparagus and or rice! Thank you!!

This was great! Made exactly as recipe states and it turned out wonderful - and no, I did Not cover the chicken.  It was very moist, juicy and flavorful.  I made it a second time just today but used brown sugar instead of white and added a half cup of sliced green onions.  I also marinated the chicken over night in a watered down version of the sauce and then used the regular strength sauce the last 30 minutes of baking, basting every ten minutes.  Wow! Nothing at all wrong with the original but I really liked this recipe when I marinated the meat over night!

Not being one to "tweek" a recipe until I've tried it, I made this exactly as written with the exception of using boneless/skinless thighs instead of breast.  I will make this one often and not change a thing..the sauce was delicious, easy to prepare and tasted like a meal I had spend a lot of time on.  A huge hit in this household!

This recipe was good as a base to build on.  I ended up using a mix of 6 tablespoons dark brown sugar and 2 tablespoons honey instead of white sugar and using rice wine vinegar rather than apple cider vinegar.  I also cut the soy sauce to 6 tablespoons. As far as the preparation was concerned, I blended the soy sauce and sugars and brought them to a simmer.  I created a slurry of 2 Tablespoons cornstarch and 1/4 cup cold water and dumped it into the simmering soy sauce and sugars.  It thickened up nicely and turned out to be an excellent sauce over boneless skinless chicken breasts.

My entire family moved it.  The chicken was slightly drier than I would normally like.  I might recommend baking time of only 45 min total.

Great recipe.  It was simple and very tasty.  I doubled the sauce.  I had to substitute rice vinegar for the cider vinegar, because that was what I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again.  My family loved it.  Finally, I have a great teriyaki sauce recipe.

It was delicious! Nice balance of sweet and salty. I used four bone in chicken leg quarters and doubled the sauce...ended up with a little extra sauce to spoon over the chicken. I made mashed sweet potatoes and corn bread as side dishes. Family loved it and requested I make it again.

While the sauce was delicious, I think the chicken would have been better if it marinated in it for a bit before baking. Also, my sauce didn't thicken nearly as much as in the photos I looked at, so I'll work on that next time. Those things aside, why buy a bottled teriyaki sauce when you can make something this quick and tasty?? Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Just the right recipe I was looking for. Perfect! We love it so much. My son who was very picky told us at the dinner table that it was so good. This is a keeper. Thank you for this recipe! I followed most of the ingredients except for the white sugar & soy sauce. i substituted brown sugar just because I ran out of white. And a low sodium soy sauce to cut the amount of salt in our diet.  I also used a dutch oven instead of a pan. Pour all the sauce and baked it turning once to coat the rest of the chicken. Turned out perfect. So juicy and tasty. Love it! Marilou

This sauce is excellent! I still have the glow on my tongue as I added 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper to the sauce as both my husband and I like the heat.  This sauce is SO delicious.  I pre-made the sauce and will use it tomorrow on bone in, skin on chicken thighs (thought I bought boneless/skinless from Costco - apparently I'm not capable of reading ;)).  I cannot wait to put this in the oven as the house smells amazing. BTW - I quadrupled the sauce recipe as written and used the 2 t. of cayenne.

Delicious! The sauce was so good I ate some of it w/out the chicken. The only thing I did differently: I brushed on a ginger spread that I had in my frij for the final 5 minutes, under a high broil to get the caramelized look.

Best chicken I have ever cooked.  Most of the ingredients were already in my pantry.  The entire family loved it.  Definitley a weekend meal since it takes an hour to cook.

Wow! Out of this world! Made exactly as written and served with side of Roasted Vegetable Orzo (from this site) and fruit salad with lots of pineapple. Great late summer recipe. Also- we did grill it- we did not want the oven on in the heat- came fantastic!

This is my go-to recipe. I use chicken breast instead of thighs. 
I have also used this as a sauce over shredded chicken (from making chicken stock) with white or jasmine rice - for Teriyaki Chicken Bowls.

Awesome tasting sauce! Works well in crock pot too. Texture of chicken was different but oven or crock are both great. I think I will try adding some broccoli and pineapple next time. I served it on top of parboiled rice that was cooked in chicken broth and my hubby raved about it.

Amazing as written.  Definitely recommend the 2x on the sauce as I ran out of basting sauce before it was done.  Also make sure you pat the chicken dry first.  AMAZING recipe.........

I double the recipe as reviewers recommended because i was cooking 10 skinless chicken thighs.  rather than use soy sauce, i used brag's amino and used about 3/4 cup.   wow was this salty.  it smelled wonderful while baking.  1/2 way through and basting, i tasted the sauce and decided to add a little (1/8 cup) of orange juice....thinking that this would bring down the saltiness.  overall, good recipe, but too salty for me.

The sauce was unbelievably delicious out of the saucepan. I added another 1/2 tablespoon of corn starch for thickness, but otherwise it was perfect. But: Baking at 425 was way too hot. The excess sauce had burned in the baking dish by the half hour mark.

You definitely want to double the sauce and use 1/2 to cook chicken in, then pour off watery sauce, then add the other 1/2 sauce and warm through. Delicious!

Very good recipe that will go into my permanent file.  I followed the instructions except that I used chicken breasts and decreased the sugar a bit using half brown sugar and half white sugar.  In order to make a bit more sauce, I added some dry white wine to the other ingredients.  When the chicken was cooked, I sprinkled the breasts with garlic salt.

This is hands down a ten star rating! I triple the sauce so I have extra for my rice its just so darn good. I add little extra ginger, I buy lots of fresh ginger take it home and mince all of it and freeze it so I always have fresh ginger on hand. Only change is brown sugar instead of white, Thanks so much for sharing.

Very nice rendition. There is a suggestion I'd like to make. Use your leftover chicken and finely chop it and make either spring rolls or egg rolls with it. I make Teriyaki meats at intervals and just chop and freeze it then thaw overnight in the fridge and create something else with it. Also don't forget it works wonderfully well in a stir fry or a fried rice. So many ways to keep it Asian style inspired and use this for the week and of course freeze it too!

Tasted amazing - even my daughter who hates chicken loved it! I only used 8 chicken thighs, so I altered the recipe as such, also substituting honey for sugar, halving the soy sauce, used 1/3 more garlic and fresh ginger instead of powder. I paired it with Vegetable Fried Rice and it was incredible!

Delicious! I used brown sugar instead of white, a tad more cornstarch, and much less soy sauce. Also, I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and used as a marinade for the chicken before cooking, which I also seasoned with garlic salt and pepper. Made white rice, peppers, and mushrooms to go with chicken and used a dollop of the leftover sauce for more flavor.

I personally enjoyed this recipe but my husband thought it was WAY too salty.  If I try it again, I will use reduced sodium soy sauce.  Double the sauce!

It was delicious.  My husband, who's very hard to please and often thinks dishes with sugar in them are too sweet, loved this dish and said it was "really great."  I made this with the restaurant style fried rice and some asparagus.  My thighs were boneless and skinless, since that's what they had at Pavillions.  This cut my cooking time in half to a total of 30 minutes.  When i make it next time, I'll drain some of the juices out of the baking pan at the 15 minute mark.

The sauce is delicious! The recipe says to bake for 60 minutes total but that was way to long! At 40 minutes I had to take it out because the sauce was carmelizing and starting to burn. I wouldn't cook it for longer than that!

This was excellent and super simple! I followed a few suggestions and doubled the recipe but used half the sugar (brown instead of white). Otherwise I kept the ingredients the same. I poured all the sauce on top before baking and took off the foil for the last half hour, basting it twice. I sliced it and put it with some sticky rice... Divine in no time! :)

Delicious! I used boneless, skinless breasts because that's what I had on hand. I served it with veggie stir fry, white rice, and an Asian salad with yummy 'Japanese Ginger Salad Dressing', also from this site. What a fantastic meal! Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely amazing recipe!! I used skinless, boneless thighs so cooked slightly less time than recipe called for. The sauce was to die for. The only drawback is that my glass baking dish was covered with burnt on sugary sauce and it was a pain to clean. Maybe use an old pan that you don't care about too much for this recipe.

I absolutely can't get enough of this.  (But I'm just a teriyaki fiend!)  For a little extra zing I like to add a splash of orange juice to the sauce mixture as it's cooking, before I pour it over the chicken.  It brightens it up nicely.

I only could get thighs w/skin on, and it was good, but I can really see how skinless would be soo much better.  This was a great recipe and soo easy.

I give this recipe 5 stars. The only changes I made were to add brown sugar and I usually eyeball it around 1/2 cup and use boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs. I like this recipe better than store bought teriyaki sauce and it is very simple and quick to make.

Totally scrumptious! Will keep this recipe in the regular rotation on our menu because everyone loved it. We did double the sauce and was glad we did. Other than that we followed the recipe as instructed. Served with steamed asian veggies and fried rice.

After reading all the reviews, I made the chicken last nigh.  My husband just muttered "AWWWW"  with  each bite.  I followed previous reviews and cut the sugar with brown sugar and doubled the sauce recipe (definatly important so you have extra for the table).  That sauce is amazing.  As he was eating, he was planning how to use it next....pork chops and ribs are next.  And I used breasts which came out  soooo moist. I basted them every 10 minutes.  

Thank you for a great recipe!  It will definately become a favorite in our house.

I'll use it again....3 stars because it was good but not knock-your-socks off good! I used honey instead of sugar, boneless chicken breasts - nice and sticky! The only other change I would make would be to add a little orange juice to give it a little bit of a fruity flavor...

Great dish! I followed the recipe exactly for the marinade and used boneless, skinless thighs. I only had one package of thighs, so I added two chicken breasts also.  The thighs were outstanding, very moist and delicious.  The breasts were dry and a bit chewy.  My 10 year old who hates chicken ate every bit of the thigh! Will definitely make this again.

Very good you can even use chicken strips and put on rice. Just don't cook as long. As I'm sure many would know that.

The fact that I always have chicken on hand because it's cheaper and I get bored with eating the same thing all the time, unlike my husband, I'm always looking for recipes and I searched and found this one.  My entire family loved it, especially my youngest, who only likes chicken if it's fried.  The only thing I noticed when preparing the sauce was that it was a little too sweet.  So, I added some pineapple juice from a can of pineapples I opened and put in the refrigerator.  It did the trick.  When I made it again, I added diced onions, since I love onions, and I didn't think it would take anything away from the recipe.  This recipe was a hit!

This was absolutely delicious. My 6 year old ate everything off of her dinner plate and that's a rare thing. I took the advice and doubled the sauce. I used low sodium soy sauce and it still was a bit salty but not terrible... so please use low sodium. I also used a total of 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar for the doubled recipe as recommended by another review. I poured the sauce on one side of the chicken and let it bake for 30 min and then poured the rest on the next side for the remainder of the baking time. I used a Enamelware/graniteware roasting pan. The lid helped to maintain the moisture. This recipe was totally worth it! Thanks!

Delicious.  I doubled the sauce, used brown sugar instead of white and used lite soy sauce. I also quartered boneless skinless breasts to make them more like tenders as I was saving cooking time and put them over jasmine rice.  I set aside some of the sauce and kept it hot so that we could put it on the rice or add more to the cooked chicken later.  It's so good, not too sweet and has a little kick.  I will definitely make it again!

I really liked the flavor of this however I found that the sauce took a very long time to thicken, I'm not sure if maybe I had the heat too low or did something else but I ended up adding more cornstarch and turning the heat up. Very yummy, will make again.

Loved this recipe!  Since I was only cooking for 2 people, I split the sauce recipe in half and used chicken breasts cut into strips.  I only baked the chicken for 30 minutes.  It was delicious!!!

I absolutely loved this! So did my 1yr old...He had seconds. My husband have it an 8 out of 10. So I made this just like the recipe but used chicken tenders instead of thighs and I cooked it at 375 15 minutes covered, turned the tenders over and cooked 15 more minutes uncovered. Instead of just basting the chicken with the sauce, I poured the sauce in the dish almost submerging the chicken. My sauce never really bubbled or thickened much but it was still delicious!

Amazing! I loved the simplicity of this recipe, especially since my house is very limited with ingredients! I followed the suggestions of other users in using brown sugar instead of white, pouring the sauce over the chicken instead of brushing, and covering the entire pan with foil before placing it in the oven. As a result, the chicken was very moist and the sauce just had the right amount of sweetness. Oh, and it smells wonderful! I can't wait to try this recipe again!!!!

This was a great dish....did make a couple of changes like other reviews. I doubled the recipe and on a skillet simmered 3 leg quarters. I used less than half of the vinegar since that is very strong. I stay with the amount of sugar for one recipe but used regular dark soy sauce.  Next time I will take the advise of low sodium soy sauce since it was a bit on the salty side. instead of cooking the sauce first I decided to marinate the chicken in the sauce for about 2hrs. I did have to add more corn starch at the end since it does come out kinda watery.  Will try again with some modifications.

We have used this recipe on every kind of meat, pork ribs marinated and basted on the bbq, chicken breasts and thighs done casserole style, meatballs in the crock pot, even chicken thighs marinated, basted over the fire....yum! It's always a hit with our family of 6, its a quick easy weeknight dish! We always double the sauce, use whatever kind of vinegar we have in the cupboard and use fresh grated ginger to enhance the ginger taste. I've passed this recipe onto family and friends and it's become a regular in all households.

I have to try this again the ginger over whelmed the sauce.I used skinless boneless thighs and 45 min was plenty long just have to adjust the ginger amount like in half or none,other wise I think this would be awesome.Teriyaki is one of my favorites for chicken and I think this would blow away any store bought sauce with way less ginger.

This recipe was awesome! My family loved it, and I was disappointed that I only had one thigh. I wanted more! I didn't have ground ginger, so I used a little fresh ginger and it worked, except I did bite into a ginger piece, so next time, (and there will be a next time) I will use ground ginger. I put a little water in the bottom of the dish so I could have extra sauce and it worked well with the natural drippings.

This recipe was delicious, I loved the homemade Teriyaki glaze.
Did not need to bake the full hour, and tasted perfect no changes to the the recipe. Will try again with boneless, skinless chicken in the future!

I did not have any cider vinegar so I just used regular vinegar and it turn out great! I wonder if the cider vinegar will make it that much better. I also used lite soy sauce, I think too much regular soy sauce can ruin a dish. I had extra sauce and froze it for next time.

This is a favorite! Tastes great and like it took alot of effort to make but is super easy. I did not use the corn starch and cut the white sugar from 1/2 a cup to 1/4 cup and was still super delicious.

I liked this very much. Instead of sugar I used Truvia but only 1/2 of what the recipe called for in sugar. I also added about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give it a little spice.

Hubby is a picky eater, but liked this okay. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and followed the instructions for the recipe, only baking about 45 mins instead of the full hour. It was good, but just didn't wow us. Great for a go-to meal, if you have the time to baste the chicken every 10 minutes like the recipe calls for. If not, I would either marinate the chicken in this sauce over night, and pour over the chicken and cover it with aluminum foil while baking, or skip this recipe altogether.

Wonderful!! The sauce is so delicious, so definitely double it. We like the sauce over rice along with the chicken. I would also recommend putting foil on the bottom of pan if you use a lot of sauce. Otherwise it makes a big goopy mess on the pan. I cook the chicken longer than the recipe calls for. The chicken gets really tender and the sauce caramelizes. Sooooo tasty!! My 13 year old son's fav.

This recipe was super easy to make, and the family loved it. I couldn't image not doubling the sauce, its a must. I served the chicken with a fried rice and french bread. It made an amazing dipping sauce. My only concern was how spicy it turned out. I used fresh ground black pepper. Next time I may cut it in 1/2 but the family likes the extra heat. I also added 1/4c pineapple juice. I cooked at 375 for the 1st 20 mins then put the temperature to 425 to finish it off. The chicken came out so moist and delicious. I cant wait to make it again!

I've made teriyaki chicken for years and only used the store bought teriyaki sauce.  
This was very simple to mix up and marinate the chicken while it was cooking.  I did not have cornstarch so just used flour.
My husband said it was so much better then how I've made it in the past.  Loved the homemade sauce!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a good Teriyaki sauce. But a bit salty. It said it was spicy,I wondered where the spice was I think next time I will add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit.

This was very good.  Made it exactly like the recipe said.  The pan burned, I used one of those throw away pans, which is what I did afterwards.  I think I would use spray shortening next time.  The chicken was great, very tasty it fell right off the bone

I have been searching and searching for a good teriyaki recipe. The difference is that I used mirin instead of the cider vinegar, and boneless/skinless chicken breasts instead of the thighs. The sauce is great for making stir-fry to go with it too! Finally,  I no longer have to be disappointed by restaurants serving poor teriyaki!

perfection!   this recipe is delicious.   the meat was still tender and the sauce was the perfect amount to keep the chicken moist and have additional sauce to put on top with rice.

This is a keeper.  Like others have done, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar.  I baked as directed and it came out perfect.  The entire family agreed!   Also, I lined the baking dish with foil for easy clean up.  Thanks Marian for this easy and delicious recipe!

Incredibly easy to make with items most people probably have in their pantries.  Instead of baking chicken, we used it for stir fry.  Great taste and consistency, I'd definitely make this again.  I'll probably use a little less sugar next time though, it's a touch on the sweet side.

It was great, but with some changes.  I did what the others did and cooked it at 375 degrees.  I also added slices of green pepper,  and some chunks of pineapple.  Perfect.

Made this for girls at work!  They loved it and wanted the recipe!  I actually baked it once and the sauce didn't stay on meat as well as when I grilled it.

Absolutely loved it. I didn't baste every 10 mins (too much work for me, haha). I basted once every 30 mins. Turned out great! Even my 2 picky girls loved it!

THE best teriyaki chicken recipe - period. No need to look further. I never knew it was this easy and simple to make such a delicious teriyaki sauce. It could easily be restaurant quality taste! I have made this at least 10 times now and it is always a hit. Children love it as well as adults. It's so easy to double, triple the recipe, that I once made it for my son's 4th birthday party for about 20 kids and they just kept coming back for more. I had Moms asking for how to make it and some though it was restaurant bought! The only thing I don't necessarily put in is the ginger - only because I don't always have it on hand, and it still turns out great. It's definitely one of my staple recipes that I can whip up if there's a small gathering that's easy, but doesn't look or taste like a half- @**ed dish, but one that took effort!

So delicious, almost too salty so next time I would take the light soy sauce. I also upped the garlic and used only brown sugar. But my husband's mouth was watering and that's all I can ask for :) I liked it too! So tender and flavorful-better than the teriyaki chicken I've had recently. Thanks!

This was quite tasty. I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the sauce and just poured it over the chicken. Though I had LOTS of sauce left over. Also, I think I will cut back on the cornstarch next time. It was THICK. I used 2 rounded T and I think I'll just use 2T next time. Very good flavor though. Even my 4 yo thought it was great!

I liked it. I altered some things because it packs a bit of an overwhelming punch between the soy sauce and the vinegar.
I used low sodium soy sauce as one of the reviewers suggested and I also added pineapple juice and crushed pineapples to give it that sweet tang. oh, I also used brown sugar instead of the white sugar. 
Prettytasty. :-)

I made this last night and it was a winner for my whole family.  I will be making this as an appetizer for football Sundays.  Also this makes an excellent dish to share with other.  I like that the sauce is not to sweet or spicy.

So easy and tasty!
It doesn't burn like other sugary sauces.
This is our new family favourite.
Tip:I halved the sugar quantity.Also,I didn't have cider vinegar so I added malt vinegar instead.

I used a lite soy sauce, doubled the sauce and didn't cook as long as recipe states.  Very yummy.  Hubby liked but would prefer on boneless chicken.  Will definitely try again!

This recipe was an instant favorite for my family. I did double the sauce, and the whole recipe is easy to double or triple for a crowd. Makes excellent leftovers for lunches the next day.

Very tasty! I had one large chicken breast to use up so I made a small portion of the sauce (approx. 1/4 of what is listed here) and cooked the chicken for about 35 minutes, turning it every ten. There wasn't a whole lot of sauce leftover for the accompanying brown rice, but it worked. I accidentally forgot the ground ginger, but it was still scrumptious.

i put this in the crockpot. i added two cups of water, tripled the cornstarch/water mixture, plus added flour. i wanted lots of thick sauce.
i doubled all of the spices and added onion powder, garlic powder, and minced garlic.
i also used brown sugar instead of white, i like the taste of brown sugar better!
because it was in the crockpot the chicken shredded instead of just one piece, but it was really good. 
i've made this a few times and love it!

I've made this half a dozen times - it's fabulous!!  Don't substitue and use brown sugar.  I did that one night when I was out of white sugar and it burned on me.  Chicken meat was still good but the skin *(which is usually sooooooo fabulous with this)  wasn't edible.  Great recipe.  Double line your baking sheet and clean up is a breeze.  Worth the effort!

This was very nummy; quite the hit with my family.  The only suggestion that I would make is to definitely line your baking dish with foil (I greased the dish, but still had a petrified layer of Teriyaki sauce that took a lot of soaking and scrubbing to remove).

Very good.  I did increase the vinegar by about 1/4 cup to cut out some of the salty taste of the soy sauce.  My husband who hates salt really liked this recipe.  I will make again.

Great for the whole family!  I made this stove-top rather than in the oven.  Just a little olive oil in a large saute pan over medium to high heat.  Browned both sides, then turned the heat to medium.  Added more sauce as in the directions for baked, then added the rest of the sauce at the end to heat it with the chicken before serving.  Agree with other reviewers that you need to double the sauce. I made the sauce as per the instructions, but had half the number of chicken thighs. Easy and delicious.

This is my husband's new favorite dish! It is awesome and I make once a week. I've also used this teriyaki sauce for steaks, chicken and veggies on the grill as well. I'll never buy teriyaki sauce again since this is so easy to make.

This smelled amazing while it was cooking, but the taste didn't equal the aroma. It needed something else. I may make it again, but will try to add to it, maybe garlic powder and ground ginger?

Best teriyaki chicken recipe I've ever tried.  Simple and delicious!!  Sometimes I replace the apple cider with Mirin, which I suspect may be what they use in Japan anyways...

BEST TERIYAKI SAUCE EVER! I'm going to use it on everything including cheese sandwiches! (Okay, probably not on cheese sandwiches, but there will be baked teriyaki chicken wings in my future.)

While I was in the grocery store shopping for the ingredients for this recipe I almost grabbed a bottle of teriyaki sauce - I'm sure glad I didn't! This recipe was super-simple, quick and delicious!

I followed the instructions exactly, but went a little heavy on the ginger. Perfect just the way it is!

This was wonderful!! I double the recipe, and tripled the sauce. I added 1 can of crushed pineapple, and 1 tsp cider vinegar to the sauce for a wonderful teriyaki flavor! Thank you for the great recipe! Praise Jesus!

I used 1" chicken pieces instead, and cooked for 15 mins at 425. I also substituted 1/4c brown sugar instead of the white sugar, per other reviewers' suggestions. I served with cellophane noodles and mixed veggies, which went with the chicken very well. This was fantastic and I absolutely love the sauce.

I tried this recipe because I had gotten the hindquarters really cheap... and wasn't sure what to do with them. The only thing that I had issues with is the baking temp and time! I started out at 375 with the chicken covered by foil. I let it go 30 minutes and then uncovered it... and let it go another 30 minutes. It still was not done. I bumped up the temp to the 425 and let it go another 15 minutes and it was finally done.  I think the next time I make this... I will do what the original recipe called for. Oh yeh, I will also use low sodium soy since I could hardly bend my fingers they were so swelled in the morning. :) Really Yummy!

Delicious - i doubled  the recipe-used brown sugar instead of white, rice wine vinegar didn't have cider vinegar and low sodium soy sauce. was enough for 5 drumsticks, 4 thighs and 2 breast- followed everything else and directions exactly! Yummy!

This was possibly the best teriyaki I've ever had. The meat was moist and fork tender, and the sauce had substance. My boyfriend said it was as good as any restaurant would serve. The only thing I did differently was to reduce the temp to 375, and it took 40 minutes to cook (I used boneless thighs.) I also broiled it for 3-4 minutes at the end to make the glaze really stick. Next time, the only thing I would change would be to use reduced sodium soy sauce.

I JUST made this and it turned out amazing!! I took some tips from other people and it was amazing! I used about 1/4 c sugar and 1/2c brown sugar and white vinegar, I didn't have any ginger but I dont think it makes a difference! I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs and it, I'm going to say it again.. turned out AMAZING!!! will use this recipe for a long time!!

Good chicken.  I used fresh ginger and it was a little strong in the ginger flavor for me so I will use less next time.  Definitely double the sauce as others have suggested.  Other than that I made it just as the recipe states and it was yummy.

This sauce is perfect, and I am very picky with teriyaki sauce. Very tasty and easy to make, absolutely no fuss.  The sauce had perfect consistency as well, not watery and not bland. I followed the recipe exactly as it read.  Chicken came out perfect. Delicious!

Good basic recipe - it was a little heavy on the salt and ginger for my taste.  I will use less ginger, lite soy sauce and some sesame seeds next time.  Other than that the chicken was tender, tasty and made a great lunch the next day.  I did use boneless/skinless chicken breasts because I don't like dark meat and cooked for less time.  Hubby and kids liked it as well.

I was so excited to find this recipe. Lots of reviews suggested doubling the sauce. But as I was only cooking for 2, I had less meat so stuck to original amounts. Loved having the extra sauce to soak up in the rice! I used the full 1/4 cup if vinegar and next time I will reduce it by half. Too strong for my taste. Otherwise a perfect recipe :)

I made this for dinner. The sauce by it's self tasted good. I did like the recipe call and put the chicken in the oven and put sauce on the chicken every 30 min. It did not flavor the chicken at all. Plus it made a mess of my pan. I should have used foil or something in the pan. Not very good.

So good and sooo easy!! I used chicken breasts in the oven at 400 F for 40 minutes and just dumped the sauce mixture on top--no need to reduce beforehand, the oven took care of that. I basted it all 1/2 way through.

Excellent! After reading the reviews, I also doubled the sauce. I poured the sauce over the entire chicken in the pan and just turned the chicken. The next time I will use boneless chicken breasts cut up which I think will be easier and taste great over rice.

This recipe is a definite keeper and will be included in my menu rotation! I basically followed the tips from "Valerie's Kitchen".  I'm not sure if anyone else mentioned it, but this sauce reminds us of Filipino-Adobo chicken!  I'm sharing this recipe with my brother, who is always looking for recipes that are flavorful and easy to prepare. LOVE IT!

This recipe has the capability to become a great mainstay teriyaki sauce. The cider vinegar in here makes it different, & gives it some excellent tang. 

I felt it had too much sugar, although if I had grilled it I think it would have helped the sugar in the sauce to burn out more and reduce the sweetness. Next time I use it for baking, I'm planning on reducing the sugar to a couple tbsp. The recipe as it comes is still really good, it should just be used sparingly over any steamed rice or veggie sides

Adding a few drops of lemon juice and cutting down some of the sugar gives it some sweet and sour flavor, although this is more on the sweet side.. tossed the chicken in the sauce and some olive oil and grilled. A good basic recipe- The sauce is dark and glossy and tastes nice, but I still want to look for how I can improve on this. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This was just perfect!  I have made this twice now and each time I make the sauce then stick boneless skinless chicken thighs and marinade them overnight.  Hubby is a huge fan!  This will be made quite often!

Thought this was very good. I used BLSL chicken breasts.  My sauce didn't get as thick as I would've liked but that was probably my mistake. We will definitely be making this again!

This is a keeper.  The flavor was good, a bit salty for us but overall good.  We used the leftover sauce on some leftover noodles for lunch, paired with a light salad.

Great recipe, Thanks!

My sauce became too gummy and pretty much ruined the meal. Plus, it was too sweet for our family's taste. I would use less sugar and less corn starch, if I made it again.

This is so delicious, and could not be easier! I did reduce the amount of sugar - I used approx. 1/8 cup - but kept everything else the same. I have made this numerous times, with anywhere from 4 - 12 drumsticks and/or thighs, skin on or skinless.

So good!  I doubled the sauce just like other reviewers had mentioned and it was perfect.  I made sure the sauce thickened enough into a syrupy consistency so that it stuck to the chicken.  Perfection!

Excellent dish! Everyone in the house (from 2 year old, tween, teen and adult) loved this dish! I doubled the sauce (because we are sauce lovers here) and saved some to drizzle on top. Thanks!

We loved this recipe.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast(I filleted which cut the cooking time to 30 minutes.)  This will be a regular in our home.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was wonderful! The only thing I did differently was that I marinated it for 24 hours in a zip-lock bag and added about 6 cloves of mashed garlic to the marinade. Would definitely make again! This was a great hit to the family.

I really didn't care for this.  I felt the soy sauce drowned out the other flavors.  My hubby wasn't crazy about it either.  I did double the sauce as others suggested - no help for me.  It wasn't bad, I just am not crazy about it.

Fantastic as is.  I basted at 15min & 30min then at 40 min poured remaining sauce and let it go.

Cut down to 1/3 cup brown sugar the 2nd time.  This time my sauce thickened up a lot more than last time.  Also added a bunch of carrots and foiled the pan w/ some sauce brushed on them as well.

Great recipe! I follow it exactly, and it comes out great every time. I sometimes sub out the thighs for breasts so be a bit healthier, but it does taste better with the thighs. Thanks for this recipe!

I took this recipe pretty much straight, the only changes was I used brown sugar instead of white and increased the garlic as per taste. I also used bone in breasts instead of thighs. I basted it about every ten minutes and had it in the oven at 375 for 40 minutes. The only thing that kept it from a 5 star recipe is this tastes more like a rib glaze then something you'd put on chicken, although it was pretty good. I would use it for ribs not chicken.

I made the sauce as the recipe is written and poured all of the sauce over the chicken prior to baking.  Then I baked 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs at 400 degrees for 30 minutes covered, then uncovered for an additional 15 minutes.  Turned out fabulous!!!

This was a hit with my family, even my four year old ate it and she is PICKY.  Very easy to make.  Made it  with some brown rice and sugarsnap peas.  I used the recipe given, except I did half the sugar as many people recommended to do.  Yum!

Great flavor! Doubled the sauce and only used 1/2 cup of the soy sauce instead of the full cup and added 1/2 cup water in it's place. I used fresh ginger in place of the ground. It defiantly helps with the flavor! I was in a hurry and put all of the sauce on the chicken thighs and baked 40 min. It turned out great!

This was a wonderful dish with lots of flavor. Good company dish. The only thing I change now and then is to cut up the chicken and just pour all the sauce on it instead of basting.Love it with the Harvest Rice dish on this site. YUMMY! Leftovers are wonderful if there is any left!

excellent!! My family loved it. I didn't have cider vinegar, so I used apple juice and a little white vinegar. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I made enough to coat whole wheat thin spaghetti.  I can't wait to try it on beef! This will make a good marinade also.

I tripled the sauce so I would have some left over for a marinade. I used a mix of brown and white sugar, using more brown than white. !/4 cup less soy sauce, 1/2 tsp. chili sauce for heat and I used boneless skinless thighs. I also added extra crushed garlic. Basting every 10 min seemed like a pain and a heat waster so instead I just poured the sauce on the chicken. I coated it well and just turned a couple of times during cooking. It cooked in less time due to no bones and no loss of heat from the oven. The chicken was tender and moist. I served over jasmine rice, poured some additional sauce from the pan, and topped with chopped cilantro. The unused sauce that I didn't put in the oven I put  in the fridge to use as a marinade for pork later in the week. My family loved it and so did I!! This has already been requested again and for birthday dinners as well. Thank you for submitting this recipe!!

Delicious!  I doubled the sauce and per recommendations of others used half brown sugar.  Let me say that I tried the sauce after it came to boil in saucepan and I did NOT like it.  It seemed so acidic.  It definitely changes when cooked with the chicken.  I had mine bone-in thighs skin down for first half and then turned to skin up for a crisp yummy glaze!  Will make again for sure!!!!!

Great recipe. I have made it multiple times.  Stick to the thighs ( I go boneless) instead of breasts, it is a lot juicier and more tender.

I made the recipe exactly how it was written and don't know how someone could mess up on this, it's so easy.  The whole family loved it.  I used boneless chicken thigh's, 40 minutes would be enough, but the meat just fell apart, will definitely make this again, everyone commented over and over how delicious this is.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I just realized I forgot to put in the cider vinegar.  It turned out just fine.  The only other modification I made was only adding 1/4 cup soy sauce, not 1/2 and then adding a 1/4 of water.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I actually made it twice and didn't like it either time, but wanted to try again just in case I messed something up the first time. I would have only given 1 star, but my hubby said it was fine (not good, but tolerable) so it got 3 stars for his remarks. I followed the directions exactly, so my review is true to the recipe. I will not be making this again.

This was super easy and very good! I listened to some other reviews and split up the sugar 1/2 brown and 1/2 white. I also doubled the recipe and cooked only four chicken breasts. I poured the whole mixture over the chicken and baked it like that. They came out great, very flavorful! Paired it with vegetables and brown rice.

The only change I made was to use boneless chicken breasts - cooked at 400 for 35 minutes. This was absolutely delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I used the recipe for the sauce, left out the cornstarch, & used as a marinate for boneless skinless chicken breast.  Thickened leftover sauce with cornstarch on stove, then served over grilled chicken with homemade fried rice. This was so good, I had it for dinner three nights in a row! So easy, with ingredients already in the cabinet!

Went looking for something different to do with chicken breasts and came across this recipe. I made a few alterations because of what I had on hand. Used rice vinegar instead of cider, jarred garlic instead of fresh and boneless chicken breasts. Like others suggested I substituted brown sugar for the white. Poured all of the sauce over the chicken and baked at 400 for 30 minutes. Yum!!! I even got a thumbs up from my kids who are the pickiest eaters ever! Will make again.

Nice moist chicken, I doubled the sauce it was just enough for 4 people. I sprayed the bottom and sides of the 9x13 pan really well and had no problem with cleanup. I used lite soy sauce and added no salt.  When I tasted the sauce before I poured it on the chicken to bake I was not quite liking the flavor but after it cooked it was much tastier.

Delicious.  My picky kids also love this recipe.  I tried it with chicken breasts but find the thighs are much better.  The only change I make is I add an extra clove of garlic.

This is an excellent recipe! I've cooked it for many guests and they love it too.  Be sure to always line the baking dish (non-stick aluminum foil is the best for this).. otherwise the sauce will burn onto the dish/pan.

I followed this recipe exactly and it's a delicious way to make chicken thighs!  Very flavorful.  The only thing that I'll do differently next time is line my baking dish with foil as the sugar/teriyaki burns a bit on the dish.

I wanted to make a terikayi sauce to use on pre-cooked chicken strips. This recipe was perfect, I had this in a chicken teriyaki sandwich wrap. Delicious.  I only changed the white sugar to brown sugar, as I have read on other recipes that teriyaki sauce comes out better that way. Also, if your concerned about salt then, try using a low sodium soy sauce. That's what I had on hand and used and it was great!

Very very VERY good! Great flavor and everyone loved it! Brushing it with the sauce every ten minutes caused the flavor to soak through really nicely. I give it 5 stars for presentation too. Would be a great recipe to serve to guests. Just cook the chicken presentation side down first, use the juices the chicken cooked in as a sauce, and sprinkle with Italian Parsley as a garnish! The only changes I made was I used Blue Agave all natural sweetener instead of the sugar. The ratio of sweetener to sugar is 1:1 but I used about 3/4 c. sweetener instead of just 1/2 c. Also the chicken only needed 30 minutes on one side and about 15-20 minutes on the other and it came out perfectly juicy and tender! I will definitely keep this recipe and make often! *To prevent the burnt mess in the pan, coat the WHOLE pan with a good layer of butter.

Absolutely the best flavor ever. Reason for the low rating-i ruined one of my best pans with the impossible to remove thick black mess this left behind. I soaked the pan immediately afterwards for 3 days, still wouldn't come out. Would have been nice for the recipe to mention putting foil down first for inexperienced cooks like me. House smelled fantastic while it was cooking, and for hours afterwards. Will definitely make again-with foil down first or in a disposable pan. I used light soy sauce as well, simmered everything until the chicken was placed in pan then just poured it all on.

One of my favorite recipes when I need a tasty meal requiring no marinating time.  The sauce is so thick and yummy that it easily coats each piece of chicken.   I usually use party wings and chicken breast sliced into strips.  It takes 30-40 minutes at 425 to bake since the size of my chicken pieces are smaller.  I do double the sauce recipe but am usually left with a lot left over.  I reserve some for dipping (the kids like this).   For a quick meal serve this chicken with rice, steamed broccoli, and sliced tomatoes.  It's a hit each time even with my 8 and 5 year olds.

I doubled the recipe for the sauce and used it over 4 chicken breasts.  I made the sauce exactly as listed (except I used lite soy sauce).  This was good, but I am going to stick with using the Teriyaki Marinade III recipe from this site.  We enjoyed it a lot more.

I only heat the sauce until it comes to a boil.  Make extra, save the leftovers, including the sauce.  Bone the chicken the next day, and add the chicken and sauce to stir fry vegetables.  Serve with chow mein noodles, rice, or angel hair pasta.

This recipe is wonderful! Husband rated it a 5 as well. Only thing that I did different was use brown sugar, instead of white.  I did not cover during baking. Dumped extra juice on bottom out half way through.  For those that think that the sauce was thin after making, just let it sit until it cools down, and then it gets nice and thick.  Thank you for this recipe. Will be in my regular rotation.

This was so easy and delicious; I had everything I needed on hand at home. I made the sauce but only four chicken breasts. I just poured the sauce over all of them and it took about 45 minutes to bake until the chicken was done, turning about halfway through. Double or triple-layer your aluminum foil for easier clean-up. My one layer ripped and the pan was a pretty sticky mess. My guests all loved this!

This recipe was really good, and easy to make.  However the 1 hour at 425 was a bit long and high.  I had to turn the temp down and only cooked for 45 min!

instead of using chicken thighs, i followed the advice of some other reviewer's and used boneless skinless chicken breast( i dumped the sauce over the chicken). i also lined my baking dish with foil. other than that i did not change the recipe. i was worried while making the sauce and while the chicken was baking, the vinegar smelled really strong but it came out so perfect! i will definately make this again!!

Fantastic recipe. As the other users said, double it because the sauce is great to spoon over the chicken on the plate before serving. Its also great over rice. I cooked the chicken at 375 degrees for 20 minutes covered in foil, then brushed it, and left it for another 20 without foil. Turning over the chicken in the sauce wouldn't hurt either. Also it's best to use low sodium soy sauce and brown sugar instead of white, it makes it so delicious.

This is a great sauce.  I've brushed it on and made it in the oven as well as on the grill.  I recently just poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it.  It was yummo!!!  We loved it this way as well.  A keeper!

Very good recipe. I only gave it a 4 because I don't like ginger so I left it out. There are only 2 of us so I used 6 boneless skinless thighs with the same amout of ingredients for the sauce and it was perfect. If your using 12, I would definitely double the sauce. I covered with foil as well for the first 30 mins. It made for a lot of juice in the pan, but I just dumped out before adding more sauce. Turned out perfect. I will definitely make again.

This was really good, I ended up using 3/4 c. soy sauce and 1/4 cup Worshershire Sauce, because I ran out of soy sauce. I also added a little more ginger and a little more garlic and it turned out great. We all loved it. The sauce was wonderful!

This reminds me of a teriyaki place in Seattle I use to go to (it was ALWAYS packed)! I loved it! I did follow the other suggestions of lining the pan with foil and then covering with foil for the first 30 minutes. Worked out great!

This recipe is wonderful! I made both thighs and chicken breast in the same dish. The secret I think is to baste the chicken first with somewhat liquidy sauce and then cover it and bake on 425 for 20 min. And then I thickened the sauce with more cornstarch until it became a glaze. I glazed the chicken and then baked for another 45 min, taking it out every so often to flip and glaze again. Last step I broiled the chicken on low for about 3-4 mins.  Made with garlicy mashed red potatoes and it was spectacular. The gravy went perfectly with the mashed potatoes.

I made this the other night for my boyfriend and myself. It was amazing. I made the same amount of sauce, but less chicken since it was only the two of us, and then poured the sauce over rice. I'll definitely have this again.

Yum! I pretty much followed the recipe but used boneless chicken breast instead because that's what I had. Turned out great! I think I had it in for less though because I only had 2 chicken breasts and they were kind of thin. My husband and I aren't huge teriyaki fans because it's usually too sweet, but it was good! I will try with salmon next time, like someone else said! Thanks!

I think the cooking time and/or temperature aren't quite right for skinless, boneless thighs.  I even took them out a bit early and still the glaze was rather burnt and the chicken, overcooked.  I think it could be pretty good with a bit of tweaking, though.

This is a very good recipe.  Like many I made some minor adjustments.  I think the type of soy sauce can help a lot with this if you feel it can be too salty in addition to cutting back the amount some.   I used Kikkoman.  My family enjoyed it very much.

Very Yummy, there are 8 kids plus two parents in my family and we all loved it. Plus it was very easy.  I made double the sauce for 7 large chicken breasts and served it with rice. We scooped up the sauce in the bottom of the pan that had fallen off the chicken and had it on the rice. Thanks for the Recipe!

This dish is quite tasty, I doubled the sauce, and halfway through pour out the juices and re-thicken to get that thick top layer at the end, it presents great for guests!!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe for the ingredients (except I used half the sugar), but baked it covered with the sauce poured over, and turned the chicken half way through.  I didn't make extra sauce as many suggested though, and I think that was the right call, there was plenty.  I also foil lined the pan, and clean up wasn't bad at all.  I served with baked potatoes and butternut squash - yum!

My picky husband, 11 year old son, and I loved this dish!  I followed the advice of others and made double the sauce and cut the soy sauce to 3/4 cup instead of doing 1  cup for double the sauce.  We didn't think it was too salty at all.  You can make this with sticky rice and pour a little of the remaining sauce on the rice...so good!!!

Made this almost as written and it was pretty good.  I tripled the sauce because some reviews said there wasn't enough sauce, there was waaay to much.  Just double it if you like sauce.  I used chicken tenders and instead of brushing, I just dumped all the sauce in a casserole pan and cooked.  Also, I added frozen broccoli and we served it over rice, it was a nice meal.

easy and quick dinner : )  i used 1/2 the sugar, rice vinegar, light soysauce, and added 1 tsp cayenne pepper.  these changes to the sauce yielded a very flavorful and slightly spicy variation (but the cayenne is less spicy that ya think, so if you like lots of spice add at least 2 tsp)

Delicious! The only change I made was to use honey instead of sugar, and the chicken was delicious. We grilled the meat for an extra layer of flavor.

My family loved this recipe.  I didn't double the sauce.  We don't like too much sauce.  It was enought for basting and a little left for the rice as well.  Plus you have the drippings from the chicken.  Delicious!  Thanks

this recipe was DELICIOUS! I was skeptical about the amount of time it would take to cook the chicken (an hour seemed way too long) but ended up being perfect, the sauce made a delicious coating on the outside of the chicken and it tasted just like something you might get at a chinese restaurant (but healthier since it's just baked!) like others, i doubled the sauce, this is a MUST, i used up ALL of the sauce while basting and there is no way i could need just half. Seriously...this is a MUST MAKE recipe!!

I thought this was great!  I put it on some boneless chicken breasts and salmon fillets that I had in the freezer and it was wonderful on both.  Will defininitely make again!  I love recipes that cut down on the grocery bill by allowing me to make the sauce myself.

Great, easy recipe.  The sauce has a very rich flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not find it to be too salty.  I was nervous the sauce would be runny but it thickened nicely.  I followed the amounts exactly and made 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts..it was just the right amount of sauce (might have had a little extra).  I dumped all the sauce and baked.  Next time I will do half and baste while cooking.

This sauce is delicious as is. Instead of baking chicken thighs I brush some on the boneless, skinless chicken breasts and grill them. I cut the chicken and serve over rice with a little sauce drizzled over. It's a family favorite! I also like to grill some white onion and pineapple. sooooo gooooooood!

This was too easy and really good.  It was a little too sweet for me but next time I will reduce the sugar amount.  I doubled the sauce and next time may triple the sauce since I needed it to serve with veggies over rice.  I used sliced chicken breasts and they were done in no time.  Hubby said this is a keeper!

This was really good if you like Teriyaki! My family liked it so much they asked me to make the sauce the next night and put it on ribs instead. The only thing I might do differently next time is thicken the sauce a little more then I did so it sticks to the chicken nicely. Yummy!

This is so worth to try out! I did the sauce exactly the same as the recipe but only cooked 4 pieces of chicken thigh (with skin). I used the grill instead of oven, it becamne even more tasty!! Grill 10 mins per side just perfect. Side dish were grilled vegies & mushroom. That was a hit!

Wonderful recipe! I halved the recipe but kept the amount of sauce the same. I decreased the sugar and soy sauce and used garlic paste because that's all I had. This turned out so moist and delicious. I will definately make this again and again.

I made this twice.  First a partial batch using chicken legs.  I also used a coconut based faux soy sauce because we don't do soy or wheat.  I only used 4 drumsticks and told daughter she could have two that night and two the following day.  She wanted it all!  It was a bit overcooked though and the hour wasn't even up.  Tonight I doubled the amount of sauce.  Used 4 chicken breasts and 10 drumsticks.  Will put the extra in the freezer.  I checked at 40 minutes and it was done.  Daughter loves this stuff.  LOVES!

Very easy to make. The sauce in the pan started to burn so I lowered the temp a bit. It only took about 45 mins to cook through. Next time i'll try with brown sugar.

Very good.  I think I added too much garlic, so it was a bit overpowering, but it was still very tasty.

This chicken was so good and really easy to make.  I liked that I had all these ingredients on hand.  I cooked chicken breasts and only cooked about 15-20 min on each side. This is truely a keeper!

Really tasty!! The sauce was EXCELLENT.  I had to double the sauce as weell...i cooked it with 3 boneless breast. yum. The sauce thickened quickly for me. It is a mess to cook unless using foil. I followed everything else.

OMG!  I don't usually rate recipes, but this was fantastic!  As others I doubled the sauce (I'll use less soy next time) and used 6 chx breasts.  To simplify, I baked at 400 for 45 minutes - superb/fast/easy!  Thank you Marian!

I love this recipe. Unlike my previous teriyaki recipe, this one doesn't require marinating, yet the flavor is still just as good.  I didn't have cider vinegar, so i used regular vinegar and added a little less. When the sauce thickened, it was a little strong, but perfect for basting. The left over was too strong to use as a side dipping sauce, so I added water and used flour to thicken it. It came out great. Everyone loved it.

The sauce is amazing!  I triple the amount when I make it so I can use the sauce for other meals.  Last night I saute'ed shrimp in the teriyaki sauce and served it over brown rice.  Yummy! I do use half brown sugar and half white sugar.

I absolutely Love this recipe! I've made this several times already. I follow the directions pretty much, except instead of constantly basting, I pour the sauce mixture in a small aluminum lined baking dish with the chicken. The sauce covers the chicken, and then I cover it with more foil & bake it for 30 minutes, then turn it & bake for another 30 minutes. YUMMY.

You have got to try this!  I will never buy bottled teriyaki sauce again!!  Changes I made were I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, used lite soy, and added a little red pepper flakes to give it a tiny bit of kick!  I also used boneless, skinless thighs and marinated them overnight in the sauce  (after it cooled) to help the meat absorb the flavor.

A-mazing! I thought to myself, so many people can't be wrong and followed the recipe to the T. I lined a pan with foil and baked for 30 mins at 400, flipped the chicken and baked for another 30. That's it! Simple & so delish! I highly recommend using thighs. Ended up pairing with a side of brown rice & steamfresh Asian medley veggies for a complete meal. Try it, trust me. Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent, the best teriyaki I have ever tasted, and it was so easy to make. I doubled the sauce per other reviews, used fresh ginger instead of ground, and boneless skinless thighs. I poured half the sauce on and covered the pan with foil for the first half hour, basting with the same sauce every 10 minutes.  Then I removed the foil, turned them over and started to baste with the other half of the sauce from the pot.  This kept the thighs nice and juicy.  In the future, I think I will marinate the chicken in some of the sauce and then bake it uncovered, basting every 10 minutes like the original. My family was extremely pleased with this one.

This is delicious! My husband now requests this for dinner and comments the whole time about how good it is! Thank you for the recipe! I have made this recipe without any changes and it was very good! The second time I made it I did put less sugar, more garlic, and used light soy sauce to cut the sodium. This is fantastic with boneless, skinless chicken thighs, it comes out very juicy and flavorful!

This recipe was exceptionally delicious and easy!!  I tripled the recipe and grilled the chicken.  The only different thing I did was added 1 cup of crushed pineapple to the sauce and used the juice instead of water.  I thought that the sugar and everything else was fine.  I used some of the sauce in some sauted veggies and cooked spaghetti to make lomein for a side dish for the chicken!!!  AMAZING!!!!  Thank you!!

Really tasty, tender, and easy. I served it with ramen and veggies. I used boneless chicken (less than asked for as well), cut into strips. I baked it in a foil-lined pan and also covered it with foil for the first half hour. I also subbed brown sugar in for the white. Give this one a try. I'm definitely saving it.

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!  I doubled the sauce and let it get really thick.  I would put foil in the pan as suggested.  I did not cover the chicken with all the sauce, but would baste it every 10 minutes. About half way through, I drained the sauce (fat) and kept basting.  It was sticky, sweet, and moist and will definitely be a regular in our home.   Thanks so much Marian for the recipe! : )

Very, very yummy with these changes: Double sauce. (even with small amount of skinless chicken pieces, i.e. drumsticks or thighs) Here's my own take on the sauce: 2 T cornstarch, 2 T water, little less than 1/2 cup white sugar, little less than 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup regular vinegar, 1 full tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp black pepper. Pour half the sauce on the chicken and cover and bake half an hour. Uncover, pour rest of sauce on chicken, bake 15 min, then baste chicken with sauce in bottom of pan and bake 15 more minutes. Comes out PERFECT this way! Can use chicken breasts and bake at 400 for half an hour.

I made this recipe without any changes and found it was the perfect amount for 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I baked the chicken at 425 for 30 minutes, flipping once halfway through - tender and delicious!

I agree about the low sodium soy sauce, it was a bit salty with the regular. Though, my husband and I still loved it :)

Best recipe for teriyaki I've found! Not too sweet, not too acidic like so many others I've tried.  I used brown sugar, powdered garlic (what I had on hand) and fresh ginger.

This was very good, just the tiniest bit salty.  I used boneless/skinless thighs and breasts and although i usually prefer white meat, the thighs were better in this recipe.  It may be because there were more creases for the yummy gooey sticky marinade.

This recipe surpasses any that I have found before it!  It is amazing!    I made this for dinner and my family LOVED it!    The only thing I might do differently next time is add a bit of orange juice to it.  This recipe is a keeper!

so yummy!  I didn't have any vinegar so I left that out and I used chicken breasts instead of thighs.  I will be making this often now.  I didn't use foil to line the pan and will be regretting that later!

YUM! We really liked this! I used a bit less sugar and a bit more garlic. You really do have to baste it though while it's in the oven. I used a whole chicken cut in eighths.

Wow!  I'm never buying the bottled stuff again!  Thanks so much for a delicious sauce that comes together perfectly!  My 5-year-old LOVED the stir fry on which we put this sauce.  We also use low-sodium soy sauce, but it's still fabulous! Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Tastes like restaurant Chinese food.  Per previous reviews, I doubled the sauce, used brown sugar, low-sodium soy sauce, and fresh minced ginger, and baked at 375 F.  I also used a jellyroll pan because both my 9"x13"s were in use - it worked fine.

Made this for dinner last night and it was good. My husband liked the sauce a lot. We came up with many ways you could use the sauce.  I served it over rice and added stir fry veggies. This will definitely be made in our house again.

I followed this recipe exactly and the chicken was delicious. There was a problem getting the sauce to thicken and I needed to add an additional TBSP of cornstarch. This sauce would be a very versatile addition to any cooks' repertoire.

This was a great way to fix chicken.  A must is to line your pan with foil for easy clean up.   I use thighs and breasts so everyone has what they like.  Do baste every 10min. it will make a difference.

This was OK. Was done in 30 minutes at 400F and by that time the sauce around the sides was burned black. Tender, but somewhat bland.

Very good recipe!!!  I made this last night and we loved it.  I only had 6 chicken thighs (and were pretty small) - so the sauce amount on the recipe was perfect for 6 pieces.  It did only take 30 minutes to cook at 425 degrees.  Also, the sauce took a long time to get thick - but soooo good!  Very tender and great flavor!

Great recipe. Similar to one I already have but a little easier since it's done in the oven. Only change I made was to add a little more garlic. I also just poured all of the sauce over the chicken and just flipped it every 15 minutes or so instead of brushing the sauce on. Worked out great.

Plenty of flavor here. Reduced sugar but still pretty salty even w low-sodium soy. Awesome as marinade then grill, too much flavor for us in the oven.

LOVED the sauce.  My hubby and kiddos liked it too.  And for my kids to like it, it MUST be good.  I thought the balance of sweetness was just right... but then again I'm more of a sweet teriyaki lover instead of the more tangy or salty kind.

This was delicious but I had hoped the flavor would penetrate the thighs more.  I only used 10 thighs because that is what was in the package.  The sauce took about 45 minutes to thicken and I think I will double it the next time.  I only had enough to baste and none at the end for dipping which I like.  I left out the ginger because I didnt have it.  I cooked the boneless thighs covered for 25 minutes at 400 degrees. I drained most of the liquid from the pan, then baked uncovered for an additional 20 minutes at 425 degrees.  They were very juicy.  I served them with Pinapple Fried Rice II from this site.  Yummy!

This turned out very nicely. I did add about twice the garlic and ginger that were called for. Served with Rice and an asian salad.

the best teriyaki I've ever had. such an easy recipe and it taste great. why would I ever buy teriyaki sauce at the store again!  I made it with chicken breast cut up into strips. You don't have to cook it as long. I only had to cook it for 30 mins.

Good.    Based on reviews, I did double line the baking dish with tin foil and spray oil on it.  I was surprised by how much liquid ended up in the pan.  If I weren't busy making other food I might have taken the time to get it out with a baster as it went along.    The sauce is good but even baking it longer, there was too much 'juice' in the pan.

The sauce tasted good but not great. Make sure it is very thick and like a syrup before you put it on the chicken. Also you MUST pound it down to atleast 1/2 inch.

Dry.  The baking recipe calls for 1 hour.  Way too long.  At 1 hour the temperature was 189 and not 165 as it should be.  I would say cook 1/2 hour max and check.  In another recipe I saw, they baked the chicken thighs for 10 minutes at 425 degrees.

Everyone from my mother-in-law to my 3.5 year old loved it.  I followed the recipe but only used 7 thighs, so if making 12 I would definitely double the sauce as others suggested.  I poured the sauce over the chicken, making sure both sides were coated.  I covered the pan, baked for 30 mins, turned the chicken, covered again, baked 20 minutes, then basted again and baked another 10 minutes uncovered.

Love this recipe! So convenient that you can whip up the sauce and get cooking right away - without having to plan for time to marinate like most of the teriyaki recipes on this site. I cut the sugar down a bit based on other reviews, used low-sodium soy sauce, and used 1 T fresh ginger. I also baked at 400 degrees for 1 1/2 hours based on my usual chicken recipe. I let the chicken bake for a half hour and started basting every 20 minutes after that. It turned out perfectly. I have also made this successfully on the grill.

Made this exactly as written, except that I used low sodium soy sauce, and I baked it covered with foil for the first 20 minutes or so. It turned out very well. I think next time I will half the sugar. This is a keeper, though!

Excellent!  The sauce is delicious and makes a generous amount, great over rice.  I used low-sodium soy sauce and it was perfect, but I could see how regular soy sauce might make it too salty.  The second time I made this I just made the sauce and used it in a stir fry with diced pork tenderloin & veggies, fantastic!

Awesome!  Well worth the effort.  Took a long time for my sauce to thicken, 45 min or more.  Will also double the sauce next time.  Will definitely make again.  Mmmm ... dreaming of the leftovers in my fridge now!

Pleasantly surprised!  Followed recipe except used lite soy instead of regular and used brown sugar in place of white sugar.   Cooked sauce & then dipped boneless chick breasts in sauce pan, poured remaining sauce over chicken & baked covered for 25 mins.  The chicken looked very bland...but after removing foil, baking an additional 25 mins,  basting the chicken, the  sauce thicken & adhered to the chicken.  The sauce carmelized on the chicken!!  It has wonderful flavor.  Next time I'll used chicken tenders.

Very, very tasty dish. Doubled the sauce - probably was not necessary. Used brown sugar instead of white. Baked at 375F, 30 min covered in foil, 15 min not. - came out perfectly.

I served this to my boyfriend and two of our friends, along with rice and mixed veggies.  (I made everything as stated in the recipe, except I used four large chicken breasts.)  We all enjoyed the meal very much, especially the sauce.  While we will certainly eat this meal again, I don't know that it'll make it into the regular rotation.  Lining the pan with foil helped a lot with clean-up.

I only used 4 big chicken thighs. I accidently boiled over the sauce when trying to thicken it. Besides that, this recipe turned out pretty darn good. I dont know if the boiling over messed up the ratios but it was a bit more bitter than I would want it. Perhaps it needs less vinegar but I am not sure. Will use this recipe again though :)

I used chicken breasts, baked 15 min at 375, then turned every 10 min for total cook time of 45 min.  Very moist, good flavor, think it would be better on the grill so the sauce could get thicker and gooey, will make again.

I doubled the sauce, by the way and I just dumped the sauce over the chicken and I cooked it uncovered.  Will make again, thanks.  I served it with fried rice and green beans.

My family has chicken at least once a week, and this recipe was a sure winner.  I wasn't sure about the glaze, but I made it exactly as stated and it came out marvelous.  The finished product was not too salty; it was just right.  The sauce took just a minute or two of simmering before it thickened.

I followed the recipe for the sauce to the letter. I cooked it in a wok until it thickened. I then tossed deep fried chicken wings in the sauce and coated them. Made a great appetizer!

great recipe, even with regular soy sauce, and all the sugar ( brown not white though). it wasn't too salty, because the brown sugar balanced it all out. i did like many suggested. i lined my pan with foil, added the chicken, poured the teriyaki sauce, covered with more foil and baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for another 30, making sure to turn the chicken every 5 minutes or so.

I didn't have cornstarch so I used 2 TBL of flour instead.  Kept everything else the same.  I was suprised at how tasty this was.  The ground ginger and garlic seems to be the secret in this recipe.  Not the healthiest dish with all that sugar and soysauce but still a great recipe overall.  I think I will try this with chicken wings next time.

Yum this was good!!!  Followed the recipe exactly!   To get the most flavor brushing the chicken every 10 minutes with the marinade is a must.  The chicken just soaks it right up!

Very good flavor. My family enjoyed this. My husband wasn't home at supper time so I wrapped the chicken in foil. He thought it was leftovers from a local restaurant. He loved it! I did double the sauce like other reviewrs suggested. That worked out great. Thank you for sharing.

4 stars as written, 5 stars with changes.    I used 6 chicken breasts and cut in chunks.  Lined pan with foil.  Doubled recipe.  Added dash of chili powder, paprika and cayenne pepper to sauce because we like some spice.  Used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white.  I brushed on sauce throughout cooking.  Turned out DELICIOUS!!

Made this for dinner tonight - delicious.  I modified only a tad - used light soy sauce and split the sugar (half regular/half brown).  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wished the sauce was thicker.  I'll probably try adding a little more cornstarch next time to see if that helps thicken it up.

I have made this a few times and it always comes out great!  For the sugar I use half white and half brn sugar.  I always line my pan with foil for easy clean up.  I also follow another reviewers comment and cover it for the first thirty minutes and uncover it for the last part of the cooking time.  This results in very moist chicken.  Excellent, excellent recipe!

Wow! The wife loved this one. The only, only change I would make the next time would be to use brown sugar instead of white sugar. But, that's it. Easy to make too. Would be good for a crowd too.

When using for salmon, place fish in a shallow dish and coat with the teriyaki mixture - place in refrigerator.  
Bake at 400 for 20 minutes, or until salmon flakes easily with a fork.
Love it with boneless thighs!

I've made this many times and it always turns out great. Many people have asked for this recipe. I would recommend aluminum foil in the baking dish if you are using a metal pan to prevent a messy cleanup. I always double the sauce. Thanks for a great recipe.

YUM!  I couldn't find the skinless bone-in thighs so I had to use boneless and reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes total.  I would probably cook it less than that next time, but it was delicious with stir-fry veggies and white rice.

Wonderful, easy marinade. I doubled the recipe, used a little less sugar and used freshly grated ginger.( I refrigerated 1/2 of this marinade to use again.) Instead of baking, I marinated about 6-7 skinless, boneless chicken breasts(Costco) for about 4 hrs and cooked them on the bbq, basting a few times. The marinade creates a beautiful golden glaze on the poultry.

I thought this was very good. The sauce recipe should be doubled. I felt that it just needed more. I had some yosidas sauce and put that on in the end. I will make again.

Very good - maybe a tad salty.  Doubled sauce for 8-5oz. boneless, skinless breasts; 1.5 times original recipe would probably have been enough.  Poured sauce over chicken, baked covered 30 minutes, turned chicken, baked uncovered 15 minutes longer.  Excellent w/brown rice & parmesan-garlic broccoli.

I loved this!   And more importantly so did the kids!  I doubled the sauce quantity except for the soya sauce because I didn't have low sodium.  I also divided the sugar between white and brown. Lined the dish with foil but didn't cover the chicken.  I used skinless thighs and it turned out wonderful!  Next time I think I'll try something boneless thought.  Wonderful!!

This is the best chicken dish I have ever made! The homemade teriyaki sauce was perfect! I did not have any cornstarch so I made a roux for the thickening agent in the sauce and it was delicious! We have made this several times already and will continue to have it as one of our top dishes!

Super easy, super tasty recipe.  The only thing I did different was double the sauce, which we used to top our fried rice with.  This will be a go-to recipe for sure!  I didn't baste the chicken, I just turned it once 1/2 way through the baking time.  Perfect!

This chicken dish is well worth the wait! I used skinless, boneless chicken breast halves and they worked just wonderfully, and actually did not really need to cook the full hour. This dish is so simple, and it gives you a nice, strong teriyaki flavor. I definately suggest serving with a slice or two of pineapple on top!

The entire family thought this was really yummy!  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use boneless thighs, but I did, and they were great.  I did half the soy sauce and used flour (twice as much) for the cornstarch, since I was out, and used brown sugar instead of white.  I actually doubled the sauce based on the comments here, but had way too much left, because I did not dump it in the pan--I brushed it on as instructed.  Because my oven runs so hot, I lowered the temp to 400.  This was an excellent dish, and the leftovers (barely any!) will make a nice lunch tomorrow!

The flavor of the Teriyaki chicken was good.  The sauce was a good consistency.  I modified the oven temp and covered like others suggested, but the recipe was just average.  I broiled the chicken at the end to kind of get it to be a little glazy, otherwise it was a bit dry.  I'll try it again and maybe with boneless thighs instead to make it easier to eat.

The sauce is awesome.  Made this recipe as stated and my family loved it.  It reminded me of General Tsao's chicken from the Walmart deli minus the hot peppers.  I had plenty of sauce left over and my family poured it over their whole meal.  Thanks for submitting this.

I just hate it when 1800 people love something and I feel ho-hum.  The key issue to me was the sauce - I found it salty (used reg version of Kikoman soy sauce) and garlic and ginger didn't shine through (probably needed to add more as others have suggested).  When I tasted the sauce, I decided to add a splash of pineapple juice and about half a cup of drained crushed pineapple to cut the saltiness.  That worked fine, but I still wasn't sold on the sauce.  My problem may be that I once took a Japanese cooking class and have memories of a wonderful homemade teriyaki sauce we made.  Unfortunately I no longer have the recipe so I will continue searching.  Glad so many of you have found this to be a crowd pleaser, my vote is "just OK" - certainly not offensive but not 5* WOW.

This was fantastic! I substituted brown sugar for white, and red wine vinegar for cider vinegar (only because i didn't have the required items in my pantry).   It still turned out very good. I made it with a slightly different method. First I sliced my chicken breasts into strips, and fried in olive oil until fully cooked. While I was doing this I cooked the sauce in another pan, and let sit over low heat until it thickened. When it reached my desired thickness, I just tossed the chicken strips in the sauce, and served over rice.  Very easy and very yummy!   ** Also, I did not double the recipe and found it was enough to coat 4 chicken breasts that had been sliced. There was extra sauce too which I drizzled on top before serving.

This was very tasty and moist! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked for about 30 minutes at 400. Definitely line your pan with foil as suggested by previous reviewers to avoid a clean up disaster. This will be a regular at our house.

Great!! I followed most of the suggestions and baked it at 375- covered for 25 mins and uncovered for 15 mins. I didn't brush with the sauce, just dumped the sauce in pan. I also used 2 T flour because I didn't have cornstarch, 1/2 c brown sugar instead of white, and halfed the soy sauce. I lined the pan with foil and sprayed it with Pam and the chicken came off no problem. Also if you cover the pan with the sauce it heats up very quickly! Great chicken! Everyone loved it over rice!

Super recipe! (Definitely use reduced sodium soy sauce, though.) I baked this uncovered, and for the first half with the chubby side down. The meat was flavourful and moist. This got a 3 thumbs up from our boys with a request to make it again, soon!

This is great! I made it for guests, and they loved it! I cooked it in my crockpot while I was at church. I used drumsticks and bone-in thighs and served it over rice The sauce was a bit too runny, but tasted delish. I put in the recommended amount of sugar, approximately. I warmed the chicken up in the oven at 400F for half an hour and then left it in the crockpot on high for 3 1/2 - 4 hours and it was just done. If possible , it should be in for a bit longer. Anyway, it's a keeper!

This was absolutely delicious BUT...with people commenting on the sauce burning and having to double the sauce....I made the sauce exactly as is...but before I put the chicken in a 375 degree oven for 1 1/2 hour (no burning sauce and there was plenty to serve with the chicken), I removed all the skin from my legs and thighs and put the chicken in a bowl and bathed it in olive oil and seasoned it with salt and pepper as I do with my rosemary chicken and it came out moist and fully cooked and delicious...thank you for this recipe.

I decided to use skinless, boneless breasts.  I baked it for the entire time, but next time won't leave it in so long because I think it dried it out.  The flavor of the Teriyaki was good; however.  I fixed stir fried rice to go with it and my husband really liked it.

Very good recipe. I doubled the sauce based on others but think next time I won't, based on the fact that the sauce thins out in the oven. Very good flavor and I didn't find it too salty.

Great recipe!! I have been making this for over 2 years now and everyone (even my picky eaters) LOVE this. My husband requests this very often. We have used the sauce for every meat imaginable and have used it as a marinade, a grilling sauce, a stir fry and fried rice sauce, and a dipping sauce!!! The only thing I substitute is sometimes I use the equivalent of dried ground garlic and ginger or the fresh stuff...whatever I have on hand. I would also suggest doubling (or even quadrupling) if you want to also use sauce as a finishing sauce as well. I have also made this sauce in the microwave and it still turned out excellent! 5+++ stars!!!

This was refreshing he didn't add any salt that would have made a world of difference. It should have been marinated over night but it was good and refreshing. Needed (SALT).

recipe is great as it is! I didn't have cider vinegar on hand and had to use rice wine vinegar, I recommend not using that! It was a little too tangy. I got some cider vinegar this time =) my husband loves this and he is asian and it's really hard to find asian recipes he likes, Thank you Marian! You scored a 5 from my asian husband. PS- use the whole amount of sugar, teriyaki should be sweet =)

I followed a lot of recommendations here like doubling the sauce and baking at 375 degrees F.  I used foil pan and greased the pan with cooking spray (because I needed to use the foil for something!).  I added celery seeds seasoning to the sauce mix, and it tasted fresh.  I had to use a lot of sugar than what is called for in 10 servings (I have a huge family, and we love leftovers), so I basically sampled the sauce each time I added more sugar.  Also, I may use more brown sugar next time.  Overall, my family enjoyed it.

I made this last night and it turned out great! I didn't have low-sodium soy sauce so the level of sodium felt a little scary - will try that next time. I put baby carrots in the dish and used chicken breast. I think next time I'll add peas and onions too. GREAT over rice! Also considered wrapping the breasts with bacon but that would drastically cut the healthiness, I think.

Slow Cooker version w/ tri tips!  Made the sauce doubled, little less sugar and without the cournstarch and water.  Seasoned the steaks with a bit of salt and pepper and seared in hot olive oil.  Placed in slow cooker, poured sauce over and let cook on low all day.  Put steaks in baking dish, poured sauce into saucepan and thickened with water and cornstarch.  Poured over steaks and broiled for a few minutes on each side.  Wonderfull and easy!

Our kids absolutely ate this up.  We made no alterations to the recipe, but did use organic, never-frozen chicken thighs. It's a little more expensive, but the meat just fell off the bone.

LOVE this sauce.  I substituted regular vinegar for the cider vinegar.  Will use this teriyaki sauce on other types of meat as well.  I didn't bother with the basting, but did reserve some sauce for dipping.

I got home late the night I had planned on making this. So, instead of baking the chicken, I let it sit in the sauce a few minutes and then grilled it on my George Foreman (I had a hungry hubby and needed to hurry!). It turned out great!! Halfway through cooking I spooned some additional sauce on and it really turned out perfect. This chicken teriyummy is going to become a regular!

I bought skinless boneless thighs by accident and they worked fine with this recipe.  Just reduced the cooking time.  This chicken recipe was very delicious.

My husband loved it!!! Made a couple of changes though. Used brown sugar instead of white sugar, used "uncooked" sauce when I baked the chicken and covered the chicken the first 30 minutes of cooking. This is definitely a keeper!

This is easy and wonderful! Would be delicious with sticky rice  on the side.  We used legs and wings since thighs are not our favorite...devoured the legs BEFORE the party and placed the wings in a crockpot FOR the party :) They did not last long!

The only change I made to this was the sugar based on other reviews. I did half white sugar and half brown sugar. This came out so delicious and the house smelled wonderful!

very umami!  I make this frequently and it's delicious.  It's a great use for boneless skinless chicken breast too (reduce cooking time though).  That was it is VERY low fat but doesn't taste like it. I like it with brown rice and veggies! Another great thing about this recipe is that it's made from kitchen staples!! I always think of this to make when my fridge is bare LOL :)

This is so great! Thank you!  I also use 1/2 c Brown Sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar for a double batch...need to always double it! I sprinkle in some red pepper flakes as well, this adds a great kick! Thanks again!

Definately a keeper.  The whole family gobbled it up, including my 2 and 4 yr old, which is a plus.  I do think next time though I will double the sauce and also cook it at a lower temp for longer as it was a little dry on top.

This chicken was delicious! It didn't look quite as pretty as the picture, but yummy! I served it with the Roaster Lemon Broccoli from the site and it was delic! The sauce is rich and heavy, so I would go light.

This is a great recipe. My family requests this weekly and is very easy to make. Definitely double the recipe. I use an electric skillet -400 degrees- slice 4-5 chicken breasts, 1/4 C brown sugar, throw everything else in and let it cook for about 30 minutes (until chicken is no longer pink) and serve over Jasmine rice. YUM! Left overs are even better the next day.

Delicious! Like some of the other commenters, I doubled the quantity of everything. I was glad that I did, because we served this with unseasoned brown rice and there was enough sauce to mix some in with the rice. Yum!  Like some of the other commenters, I reduced the total amount of sugar by about a third and used packed brown sugar instead of white. I also doubled the garlic.   Next time I might add some fresh pineapple or some veggies. The sauce is quite salty because of all the soy, so it paired well with plain unseasoned brown rice.  Great recipe!

A wonderful recipe.  I have found that the teriyaki sauce is good on shrimp and pork, as well.  I haven't tried it on steak yet, but am planning on doing so soon.  I have made this several times and have started doubling the sauce recipe and I freeze half of it for future use.

This is a perfect recipe for ICF chicken breasts.  Next time I'll also double the sauce as it was really delicious and with just the right consistency to make a wonderful glaze on the chicken.  So much better than bottled.

Easy to make, and tasty. After taking the pan out of the oven, we poured the drippings back into the saucepan and let it reduce some more. Then we poured that over the white rice we made.

We really enjoyed this dish. My son said,"I don't usually like chicken thighs but this is exceptionally good!" When I was making the sauce, I found it a bit strong but it was delicious on the chicken. I had to drain the liquid from the dish a few times while it was cooking to allow it to brown. I put it under the broiler at the end also.

Had made some minor adjustments. I used Garlic Wine Vinegar instead of cider vinegar (it was what I had in the cupboard). I also didn't have a brush, so I just spooned the sauce on the chicken. Since, I was spooning the sauce, I didn't not have enough sauce to continue applying every 10 minutes. I applied at the beginning of course, but only applied at the 1st 15 minute mark and then just let it bake for the remaining 45 minutes without turning.... ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!

Hubby and I love anything with teriyaki. Because of eating healthy we eat lots of chicken so anything to make it different is appreciated Reciently I tried a piece of fish with teriyaki sauce on it. Im thinking my hubby might like it as well. Thanks again

Abbsolutely luv this recipe but I do tweak it up a bit . I usually use 4-6 thighs.I mix brown sugar and white sugar and use a lil less soy sauce...oh! It has to be low sodium soy sauce. I use lots of ginger and add red pepper flakes and minced onions...yumm DELISH!

I have made this recipe numerous times and it is a favorite wherever I serve it.  Lots of teriyaki sauce with the chicken and the flavor is wonderful.  This will be a keeper in our house for years to come!

This chicken is great!  This was my first time cooking chicken thighs and it turned out fabulous.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I covered the chicken while baking which kept the chicken moist.  I served with the "Colorful Fried Rice" recipe also found on Allrecipes.com.  Bon Appetite!

i LOVE this recipe. the first time i made it, i marinated chicken and shrimp kabobs and then grilled them. tonight, i just poured it over an 8x8, foil-lined pan of cubed chicken breast and am going to serve it with leftover rice and steamed broccoli. it smells wonderful!! i left out the ginger, but otherwise made the recipe as-is. yum!

This was delicious! I did like other reviewers did and just poured the sauce into the baking pan instead of basting the thighs.  They turned out so moist and flavorful. I have been looking for recipes for legs and thighs since they are the least costly portions of chicken and since our budget has gotten tighter with the economy this recipe worked perfectly. I will keep this recipe in my recipe box even after the economy gets better. Thank you so much for posting this!!!

Very good sauce and easy to make.  Will definately use again.  I am also just considering using the sauce and baked slice chicken breast on top of steamed veggies and rice to make a rice bowl!  Very yummy sauce indeed.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I've made about 5 times now. The only thing I do different is use red wine vinegar instead of cider. I made the swap one day when i didn't have any cider vningar on hand and it turned out fantastic. It's great as is, but if you want to switch it up a little bit, try adding the red wine instead. :)

This was so good! I used two chicken breasts. Same amount on all other ingredients just added more garlic. When the chicken was done I added the leftover sauce to some stir fry veggies. D'Lish

Love it! My daughter is allergic to milk and eggs. This is a perfect receipe! I usually bake the chicken by itself a little bit in the beginning, so the skin does not burn when I put the sauce (sugar burns fast). Thanks for the receipe!

Quite tasty!  I loved how easily it came together.  I used ~3/4 the sugar and only had pomegranate-infused red wine vinegar on hand.  It turned out great and we made it twice in one week.  I doubled the sauce, so I didn't need to turn them, as they were well-covered already.  Served over rice.  Thanks Marian!  *UPDATE* Tried this in a crockpot with disappointing results, possibly all my fault.  I added fresh pineapple after 4 hours on low.  The sauce was very diluted and gravy-like.  I think a lot of the liquid was from chicken juice and the pineapple juice destroyed it.  I ended up pulling the meat off the bones and remaking the sauce to drizzle over.  It was certainly passable, just disappointing.  Might try it again, but will stick with the oven!  Thanks Marian!

I made this tonight for our dinner.  I made the sauce and then just glazed the whole chicken in the oven every 10 min.  It came out looking beautiful.  My teenagers and husband all loved it.  My husband especially liked how thick the sauce was coating the chicken.  We did drizzle the rest of the sauce over the potatoes.  I did double the sauce recipe.

I altered the recipe and doubled it. when doubled I put 1/2c soya sauce and 1/2 cup teriaki sauce, sugar I put half brown sugar and half white sugar did not have cider vinegar so used regular vinegar and jsut put ginger as I was out of garlic. Thickened the same way and baked skinless/boneless chicken thighs at 400 for 1 hr and it was fabulous. Everyone was looking for more, definetly make it again

Love it! I've made it twice. Once on the stove top and once in the oven. I doubled the sauce so there would be plenty to spoon over the brown rice! It is the perfect - not too sweet or tangy sauce.

I didn't have cider vinegar, used 1/3 cup of white   vinegar instead.  Also added one more Tablespoon of sugar. Easy and tasty recipe!

The only change I made was to double the sauce and I'm so glad I did.  I served this over rice and next time will add broccoli.  This is a wonderful recipe!  My whole family loved it.  It's easy and delicious!  Thank you!

Ran out of ginger, so I added cayenne for some kick and only used 1/3 cup of sugar.  Poured it over the chicken and baked at 375 for 45 min, as my chicken wasn't fully thawed.

I too doubled the sauce (probably didn't need to) and used 5 breasts.  Easily in the top 3 of chicken dishes I've EVER made and the best sauce I've EVER tasted.  No more words are necessary.  :-)

**********etc, this is a GREAT recipe!  Like others, I used chicken breast and doubled the sauce.  I can't say enough about this teriyaki chicken.  It is so moist and tender you can cut it with a fork.  Since I double the sauce there is always some left over so I use it to stir fry beef and brocolli the next day.  It is so easy and delicious!

The BEST teriyaki chicken I have ever had!  Relatively easy and very, very tasty!  I loved it!  I like to serve it with rice and drizzle some of the sauce over the rice.  Yum!

This was okay I used chicken tenderloins because that's what I had on hand. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I did triple the sauce as other reviewers suggested and I had a lot left over. My very picky daughter did eat this so that was good!!! I will probably make again... Thanks

This was delicious! We used boneless skinless chicken breast and cooked on a charcoal grill and basted the chicken with the sauce every five minutes. Next time I am going to inject the sauce in the chicken. The flavor was some yummy.

This sauce is better than any of the numerous bottles I've wasted money on from the store. I make Japanese sticky rice and broccoli to go with it. It's my two picky eater's favorite meal.  The only change I made was to use rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar. I've never made it with cider so not sure if it really makes a difference, it just seems to make more sense. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Warning do not try this if you currently use the bottle sauce...you will never be able to use it again.  Made this recipe with chicken breast and it was amazing!.  Substituted brown sugar.Definately line the pan with aluminum foil.  Seasoned chicken with S,P, and kickin chicken season as well for a little spice.

I just found this recipe last week and its already the second time I'm making it. It is very authentic--tastes just like from a teriyaki restaurant. This is by far the best teriyaki recipe ever.

This was very tasty and pretty easy, but not the "teriyaki" taste I was looking for. The only thing I did different was sub white vinegar for the cider vinegar. All in all a good dish that I will make again.

This came out delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Just reduced to 2 servings, left skin on chicken, and reduced sugar. I thought the sauce tasted like something you would eat at a restaurant.

tastes ok! i didn't have lite soy sauce on hand so it did come out a little on the salty side. but the white/brown sugar mix others suggested worked well.

also, cooking at 425 degrees for 30+ minutes was overkill for my 5-6 chicken breasts. I would reduce the oven temp to 350 and then keep cooking till the chicken reaches 160 degrees in temp.

No huge wow factor for me, but it was very simple and low-fat which scores points for me.  I followed the measurements exactly but used boneless skinless chicken tenders instead, and there was plenty of sauce. All kids ate it without complaint, but they didn't compliment it either.  I'll probably make it again sometime when I need a quick meal.

I'm on the fence about this one.  The flavor of the sauce was spot on. It was the baking of it that I think I'm not a big fan of.  I think I would like this on the grill better. I may try it again that way.  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely amazing.  Best chicken ever!  I did double the sauce like other reviewers suggested, but only used 1/4 cup of sugar.  And I used fresh ginger.  Served over brown rice with broccoli.  I'm having leftovers for lunch today, can't wait.

I hate to give bad reviews when I alter the recipe, but the sauce was made the same as directed and was a little too "sour" for us. Tasted more like sweet and sour than teriyaki. My change was to use boneless breast instead of thighs. Not horrible, but will probably not make again.

I made this yesterday for a new guy (potential boyfriend) and he LOVED it!  I definitely doubled the sauce just to be on the careful side and I used lite soy sauce to cut down on sodium.  Also I used way more sugar so that it was more sweet than tangy.  To finish off the presentation I added a slice of pineapple and he thought it was PERFECT!  I will definitely have to make this again.  Also for all your health fans...I made myself some too but instead of using regualr sugar for my batch I used regular splenda and brown sugar blend splend...it came out WONDERFULLY.

This recipe is delicious and VERY college student friendly! I don't mind a complicated recipe but after a long day sometimes tossing a bunch of stuff together and throwing it in the oven is all I can handle. I used 3 large, pounded boneless skinless chicken breasts and baked 40 minutes at 400F in an 8x8 dish lined with foil. Hardly any mess left over, and the chicken was perfectly tender and drowning in sauce. I served it with basmati rice and steamed broccoli and I am SO satisfied. To think, I used to pay $15 for the same dish at a Japanese restaurant! Never again, all of these ingredients are cheap and ALWAYS lying around somewhere!

1st time I made this the sauce seemed really salty,  So this time I watered down the soy sauce. (Just opened a brand new bottle of soy and don't want to waste it. Next time I will buy low sodium sauce.) and it tasted great. Smells really good. Turned it up on high and stirred it til it thickend up a little.

This is an awesome recipe!!! I did make a couple of adjustments though... for one I used chicken breast halves instead of thighs, 1 can of pineapple chunks, and brown sugar instead of white> i even used a little bit of the pineapple juice in the sauce, not too much though because I still wanted the sauce to be thick and bubbly! MMMMMM....my family loves this one!

This dish had a okay flavor, however, my chicken came out dry. Thank goodness I made vegetable fried rice that saved the dinner.  I think I will try another teriyaki chicken recipe next time.

I just made this for lunch. It was terrific. I will be making this again and again. I used boneless skinless breasts and covered the pan with foil. It came out so moist.I paired it with quinoa and peas.

I made this recipe with chicken wings and it was very succulent and delicious. I did make some small changes. I used freshly grated ginger instead of ground ginger. I also used mirin instead of cider vinegar. I reduced the sugar to 1/4C. I hoped to make it with ingredients which would be used in Japan, and I have to say this recipe was a success.

Things I did different was use brown sugar instead of white and poured in about 3 tables spoons lemon juice and 1 tblsp of Sesame Oil. The lemon juice really rounded out the flavor and the sesame oil intensified. I used split chicken breasts also and I tripled so I could use remaining sauce to mix with rice and to pour over pineapple. This was absolutely wonderful and reminded me of my favorite Kikoman baste in the bottle but better and much less expensive. Made if for some friends. Her husband had 3rds and our combined 6 children raved more than once. Thanks for the hit! Will definitely make again!

This was a great basic sauce. I slightly modify it to our family's tastes by dividing the sugar into one part white and one part brown, adding a dash of red pepper flakes, and using low sodium soy sauce. I also double the sauce to ensure there is plenty for basting and pouring over rice/noodles. I cooked 8 skin-on thighs at 425 for 50 minutes, turning and basting as stated, and they turned out beautifully -- tender and moist. I think this recipe would be even better if used on grilled chicken!

Except for using real ginger, I followed this recipe.  It has a nice teriyaki flavor, but I thought the sauce was too runny to really coat the chicken.  Because my dinner had to wait after it was cooked, the cooled sauce got thicker and ended up coating my chicken, but if I had served it hot it would have been thin.  Definitely line the pan with foil for easy clean up!

I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, added some chopped peppers, mushrooms and onions to the pan, doubled the sauce, and poured it over. The chicken was tender and delicious. However, I felt that the ginger taste was too strong, and we like a sweeter sauce. Next time we'll add more sugar and less ginger.

Yum!  I made this for dinner last night (used brown sugar instead of white) and we loved it!  The chicken was very moist and the sauce was delicious - I might use a little less soy sauce next time, but that's just me (my husband loved it as is.)  Thanks so much!  This is a keeper!

Is nice but I had to use some of the suggested modifications to make it that way. Experiment with the cooking times and try covering for first part of the cooking to keep meat tender.

This was a flavorful and easy to prepare recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, I like to do that the first time... and then make changes in the future.  I think next time I may use brown sugar.. to add a little more depth to the sauce.  The chicken turned out juicy and tender.  It did make a big mess.  the pan I used had to soak for a few days!  Next time I will use foil to line the pan.

This came out really tender and with such good flavor.  My boyfriend said it was a bit too sweet for him, and I agree so next time I might cut down the sugar a bit.  I did double the sauce, and next time I might use the single recipe amount since I love a sticky teriyaki and this was not, the way I made it.  Overall a very yummy dinner and so easy with all the ingredients things I have on hand.  Thank you!

I make this recipe all the time. The only thing I added was a little bit of salt. Other than that, I really loved this recipe and so did my son and husband.

I make this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it turns out great.  For an extra bit of flavor I cut up a couple of bell peppers (1 per person) that I include with the chicken breasts and follow the rest of the recipe as directed.  Turns out great every time!

I was making chicken wings using Alton Brown's steam/bake method but wanted a Teriyaki sauce to toss them in when they were done.  So I can't attest to this exact recipe, but I can tell you the sauce is top-notch.

Why in the world anyone would buy Teriyaki sauce when this is the best I have ever had.  I did increase the brown sugar and added toasted sesame seeds.  The best.....I couldn't quit tasting it you would of thought it was soup.....YUM!

We ate the chicken, but I would not make it again.  There was too much vinegar, and the sauce was not very flavorful at all.  Very boring.

I used boneless thigh meat. It's pretty easy to make and the taste is pretty good. But it is different than the teriyaki chicken from restaurants.

This was really good.  I just poured all the sauce in with the chicken instead of basting.  It was perfect, but then I left it in the oven for 5 extra minutes and the sauce around the edges burned.  My husband was mad because he had to clean to pan.  I learned my lesson though.  30 minutes is plenty for chicken tenders.

Everytime I've made this, I've gotten compliments that it's the best chicken ever.  Moist, falls apart, not tough and easy to cut and delicious!  You can have extra sauce left over for on top if you get some of the extra juice out toward the end of cooking it, put it on the stove pot with some cornstarch to thicken like gravy to put on top.

I have made this several times doubling the sauce and subbing with lite soy and we absolutely love it!  I had a whole roaster chicken so I decided to try the sauce on it.  Doubled the sauce reserving half.  With the remaining sauce I put some in the cavity with some sliced onion and the rest between the skin and the breast/legs.  Then I brushed the bird with olive oil and sprinkled with black pepper.  Chilled in the refrigerator for about 4 - 6 hours cooked in the oven at 350 degrees for about 2 1/2 hours.  I used the reserved sauce to baste the chicken every 20 min to half hour or so.  The chicken had SO much flavor and the drippings made a wonderful gravy to put over white rice.  Will definitely make again!

I was looking for something quick for dinner and found this.  Definitely a keeper.  We're trying to eat clean so the sugar was a no go but I used maple syrup instead and it was awesome. I just didn't make enough!!  Very very good chicken.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  I doubled the sauce as others instructed and used some brown sugar.  I also reduced the soy sauce by a bit. I added sliced pineapple and swiss cheese on the top.  I also did the chicken breast at 400 for 30 minutes.  I flipped the chicken a few times then added the pineapple at the 15 minute mark.  I added the cheese right before I pulled it out and let it melt before removing it from the rack.  One of my guest had been insisting he had the best Teriyaki sauce recipe but he walked out with this one! FABULOUS!

Delicious recipe!  I actually have not cooked in a long time and finally decided it was time to start eating healthier at home and this was my first recipe back in the kitchen and it's inspired me to continue cooking at home again.  It's so simple, easy, and a contains a lot of ingredients you already have in the house.  Serve it up with rice and vegetables and your done!  Thank you!

Amazing.  Restaurant(not take out) quality tasting Chicken Teryaki.  Used Boneless breast - baked it for about 25 minutes turning twice & basted with sauce, then finished it in the broiler for about 5 minutes to caramelize the remaining glaze.

This recipe was easy and delicious! I skipped the whole basting every 10 minutes thing, and just cooked the chicken in the sauce, and flipped halfway through. They came out great.

This would be a 3 or 4 star recipe if the cooking times had been accurate.  I used boneless skinless thighs and it took only about 30 minutes to cook.  One hour was way too long.  Was the cooking time supposed to be for bone-in thighs?  The teriyaki glaze (called "tare" in Japanese) resembles the tare that's popular for yakitori at Japanese restaurants in the US.  I would recommend making the tare and brushing it on chicken breast pieces alternated with pieces of green onion skewered on bamboo sticks, and placed on a grill.  It's called "negima" and it's delicious...

I made this last night.  My kids (and husband who refused to eat at first) love them.  The sauce was very simple to make.  I didn't have any cider vinegar so I used regular vinegar.  Still came out fine.  I did took the advice of another by lining my baking pan with foil for easy cleaning.  I did left the skin on and cut the theigh into 2 pieces.  Delicious !!!!

I think this recipe is fabulous. I found this recipe today and tried it and wow it is delicious. My husband loved it. I will do again. I did it exactly what the recipe said. Most people were saying that they brought down the baking temp but I didn't I found that 425 degrees was perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

Great sauce - just the right amount of sweetness!  I just make the sauce on its own and served it with my grilled chicken breast - fantastic!

One of the better chicken recipes that I have found.  I stuck with low sodium ingredients and it had amazing flavor.

This turned out amazing!  My entire family was very pleased and asked for me to make this again.  I did modify the recipe a tad.  I used a little over half of the sugar.  I did a combo of light brown and white sugar.    I used the regular soy sauce, although others claim that it is too salty, I thought it was perfect.  When you are making the sauce on the stove top it will taste VERY salty, but don't worry it cooks right down in the oven.  We also bacon wrapped our chicken breasts (I would highly recommend doing this).  Then, dumped all of the sauce on the chicken in a disposable aluminum pan.  Cooked at 375 for 40 minutes.  Came out juicy and very flavorful!

Excellent recipe! It turned out wonderfully. I did substitute Braggs Liquid Aminos for the soy sauce. This is a healthy alternative if you are concerned about sodium.

Followed the recipe exactly, and my picky 3 year old devoured it. Then he asked for more. We'll be adding it to the rotation since it was easy to make and loved by him.

This was yummy. I used brown sugar splenda instead of white sugar and I didn't have cider vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar. I made the sauce and then tosseed the raw breasts in it and let it mariante overnight in the fridge. The next day, I tossed it all into a pan, covered with foil and baked. The sauce was pretty runny when I first took it out of the oven from all of the chicken juices, but thickened up as it cooled. Very tender chicken.

Great dish my family loved this meal. After two attempts at the sauce it finally came out just right. Once I read the reviews I realize I needed to cut down on the soy(too salty first batch) so I did half soy and half water which gave me extra sauce which my kids spreaded on the dirty rice kit meatless I served alone with the meal. I did double up on the ingredient. We will used this sauce deal on other meats in the future.

Made the chicken tonight and it was very tasty. I happen to have bought boneless skinless thighs. After resding the reviews that said that there was too much sugan I added 1/3 cup instead of 1/2. I only put half of the sauce on the chicke and then added the rest when I uncovered the chicken. At this time there was so much juice in the pan that I took out moxt of it obtaining over a cup. I then cooked the chickenuncovered for the last part. The chicken was very good but not juicy. We put some of the jucic on the chicken and some on the rice. I will make this again.

I modified just a bit with less sugar, and used brown and subbed rice vinegar for apple cider, but still turned out great!  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

This recipe is a keeper!  I used chicken leg quarters, which I separated, de-skinned and deboned, and then I marinated them in the sauce for several hours before cooking them (still in the sauce).  The flavor was wonderful!  I followed other reviewers' advice about doubling the sauce, but I really didn't need to.  We drizzled the extra on top of rice and enjoyed it that way.

Really good.  I don't normally like anythihng Teriyaki because it is so sweet, but this was really good.  I used 1/2 the sugar (I actually used splenda) the recipe called for, and low sodium soy sauce.  I put thighs in a foil pan, poured the sauce over the top and turned the chicken in it a few times, covered with foil, baked for 25 minutes, turned thighs, returned to oven for another 25 minutes uncovered and they were great, skin was crispy and meat was tender.  I served these with fried rice.  I doubled the sauce as mentioned by so many viewers, but I don’t think it was necessary.

This is also great used as a marinade for steaks or pork chops.  Marinate overnight if possible.  This is one of my tried-tested-true recipes.

This was simple but very tasty.  I did use a little less sugar but otherwise followed recipe except used boneless, skinless.  My hubby said it's a keeper and all 3 of my sons gobbled it up.  I think next time, I'll double sauce as my hubby is a "gravy" man.  Thanks for recipe.

Very good; I did not think, however, that you needed to double the recipe.  I used boneless, skinless thighs and since I had so much sauce left, I threw in a couple of turkey cutlets.  The thighs were far superior to the turkey cutlets.  I used white sugar and honey to sweeten the sauce.

This was good - not wow, but good.  I like to follow recipes as exactly as possible the first time I try them.  In this case, I wasn't able to brush on more sauce every 10 minutes because I ran out after the first round.  It still came out flavorful, but the cooking time/temp is off.  I have a gas oven, so I adjust accordingly.  Actually, I brought the temp down by another 25 degrees.  It was more than done when I took it out after 40 minutes.  I did cover with foil for the first 20 minutes, but other than that, the recipe was executed as-is.  Like so many other reviewers suggested, I'll double the sauce next time.  On the whole, this is a good routine meal I'll be repeating.  EDIT:  I doubled the sauce this time, which allowed me to use the basting process.  So much better this way!!!  I wish we could rate recipes by half-stars, because this still wouldn't be a five-star, but I would raise my rating to a 4 & 1/2

Very tasty!  I used fresh ginger and loved the taste.  I did reduce the soy sauce.  However, I think next time I will double the sauce and just turn the pieces over in twice the sauce instead of basting it so often.

Excellent Recipe!  I substituted sugar for brown sugar and reduced amount by half. Reduced cooking time for skinless boneless chicken to a total time of 40 mins. Delicious! Entire family loved it.  I will be making this again soon.

Delicious for the whole family.  Used boneless chicken breast pieces, poured most of the sauce over chicken. Only took about 30 min. to cook at 400 degrees.

This recipe was so delicious! I also doubled the sauce and pre-marinated my chicken a bit. I did not have low-sodium soy sauce so I only used half regular soy sauce and half (extra) cold water. I lined my baking pan with foil and covered with foil, after I turned the chicken halfway through cooking I removed the top layer of foil for the next half hour of baking. The sauce thickens up so nicely by the time it is done and is really good over fried rice! All the flavours melded wonderfully. Yum!

Very yummy... the whole family loved it! I double the recipe and used 6 chicken breasts, cut into smaller strips. I agree with other reviewers... lite/low sodium soy sauce should be used. We made rice and served the chicken over rice and poured extra sauce over the top!! Great!

Delicious recipe. Only thing I changed was using brown sugar instead of white and didn't add garlic because I didn't have any on hand. I also added a littl ground chili pepper to give it more kick. This one is a keeper for sure!

I was so disappointed with this.  The smell of this cooking was very strong and didn't taste good.  The day after I went and bought a bottle of Mr. Yoshidas at cosco.  So much better.  Sorry!

Delicious!  Made exactly as directed, except I removed the skins before baking.  It probably didn't need the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Next time I will cook for 50 minutes and serve.

Fantastic!  My 4 year-old isn't much of a meat eater, but she asked for seconds and thirds of this.  It was wonderful.  The only change I made was to double the sauce, which I think is a definite must because the sauce is so good.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Made this the other night and was very good, like others I covered the dish I used with tin foil to help with clean up.  I also used boneless chicken breast and covered the dish while it baked with foil.  We did double the recipe but found that we really didn't need to, as I  forgot to take the foil off they never did get carmalized but they were still very good, nice a moist as well

Yummy & easy to make!  Ok, so here's is what I did.  I took some others suggestions & doubles the sauce.  Used a comination of brown & white sugar (1/4 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar).  I left the bones in to cook.  It seems to keep the meat more moist while cooking.  Will make again!

Really easy and good recipe.  I didn't bother boiling the sauce on the stove...I just mixed it all together in the 9X13 pan, turned to coat and baked the chicken turning every 10 mintues.  I only had 6 chicken thighs so there was more than enough sauce.  I added red pepper flakes to make it a little spicy and I used 2 Tbsp of brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup white sugar to cut some calories.

Loved the sauce.  Definitely 1/2 the sugar amount and used brown sugar--unless you have a sweet tooth.  Also, I doubled the sauce and had plenty to cover the chicken--no need to baste.

I followed AMYLEIGH's advice about cooking times (375 covered for 25 minutes, then flip and uncover for 15 more) and the chicken turned out perfectly.  I did find the soy sauce pretty overwhelming, but I think this recipe could turn out really nicely if tweaked.

This is a delicious recipe that's full of flavor and a great and easy recipe to follow. I did substitute a few things such as the cider vinegar for white, that's what I had on hand and also, I had some jarred roasted garlic which was wonderful as well. I used fresh ginger instead of powder, and added about 2 tbs of brown sugar which I think might of helped a tad more to caramelize and maybe not so tangy. I love love love this recipe. Thank you so much!!!

Chicken was moist & tasty. I followed the directions(doubled the sauce) and added chunks of bell pepper and onion. Baked at 425 covered for 30mins, uncovered for 20mins. Added cornstarch to thicken the sauce & a splash of orange juice, and then broiled for 10mins. My husband and kids enjoyed it. The sauce complemented the veggies very nicely. Next time I'll use boneless chicken thighs.

Excellent! Dear hubby said next time to make 3x more sauce.  We can't wait to try it on Salmon as another poster suggested.  Very easy to prepare.  I did not have Cornstarch and used Wondra flour (2 tblspns flour = 1 tblspn Cornstarch) to thicken instead.  I also used bone-in, skin on thighs, covered with foil to bake and doubled the sauce. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.  Thank you for such a great recipe and our new favorite Teriyaki sauce.

I used this recipe as a starting point. For a little more kick, I added 1/2 tsp. of Thai Kitchen roasted red chili paste  and used less sugar. To make it more Hawaiian style, I used Japanese rice vinegar for half of the vinegar and used a mix of brown and white sugars. 

  I get my dry ginger in the bulk spice area of a busy local food coop, so it's very fresh and flavorful.  This recipe would be good with fresh grated ginger in it, too.

In going for a gooey, glazed surface to the chicken, I ended up overcooking the chicken slightly. I don't have a lot of patience for repeated basting, but it might be worth it to get that glaze!

DEEE-LISH!!!    My fussy 6 year old, who dislikes everything, devoured it!  

 I followed the recipe as is with the exception of putting it under the broiler for the last 10 minutes, which gave it a nice caramel color!   

The ONLY things I'll do different next time is to double up on the sauce and put foil inside the pan before cooking (my glass pan was NASTY to clean up)  :)   I will make this again and again!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Unbelievable! I thought this recipe was delicious. I am always trying to find a good bottled teriyaki sauce but never can, and now I don't need to because this one is it. I used the sauce on my chicken and on the rice as well and it was great. I can't wait to try it on salmon!

Followed the recipe to a T and it was marvelous!  Next time I'll chop the ginger in huge chunks to make it even yummier.  I had both chicken breasts and thighs, and liked them equally; this would be amazing if I could find a reliable way to make the chicken crispy.  I'll have fun experimenting!

The sauce in this recipe is delicious - perfect on thin sliced chicken breast, but also great on beef tenderloin.

Loved it. But the one thing that I do is I marinate the meat over night. I used it for baked chicken and also making beef jerky.. It is awsome!! Thanks!!

This was good.  I made the sauce as written, except that I used low-sodium soy sauce.  I did double the sauce so I could serve it over rice.  Also, I took the suggestion of lining the baking dish with foil, which made cleanup a breeze.  I used chicken thighs, but I think this would be good with other meats as well.

The chicken turned out moist, but the sauce had too much soy sauce. It was really salty. We'll try this method again, but with a different sauce next time.

THE SAUCE IS GREAT!! I MADE THIS RECIPE TWICE. THE SECOND TIME I REDUCED THE SUGAR BY A QUARTER, I CUT UP THE CHICKEN BREASTS INTO SMALLER PIECES AND POURED THE SAUCE OVER THEM. COVERED AND BAKED 30 MIN. UNCOVERED STIRRED AND BAKED AN ADDITIONAL 20 MINUTES. MY HUSBAND WHO IS THE EXPERT CHEF AND VERY HARD TO IMPRESS LOVED IT!!  THANK YOU!

This was easy to make and very tasty...I doubled the sauce as others suggested and used it all, so I'm not sure how it would have worked with half the sauce. I served it with white rice and a salad. Next time will top with sliced green onions and serve with rice and sesame green beans.

This was fabulous.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, just cut back by a smidge on the sugar.  I only had 5 chicken thighs, and had more than enough sauce, although I concur that you might want to double if you were making a full 12 thighs.  I will be making this again and again.

This was enough sauce for two huge chicken breasts halves with a little to put over rice and veggies.  Don't see how it could be enough for 12 thighs.  The flavor was wonderful just as is, wouldn't change any ingredients - just double it if you really want to get 6 servings worth.

Good! I marinated it for about 4 or 5 hours before baking it and  I'm glad I did. Since I used skinned chicken quarters that tend to be greasy, I put them on a rack above a cookie sheet to let the fat drip off, and only turned them once. The only complaint I have is that it splattered all over in the oven and made a good bit of smoke, probably because of the high temperature.

This made a really delicious sauce.  I did double the recipe as other reviewers suggested.  I also covered w/foil the 1st 30 min and probably won't do that again because the juices water everything down.

I used boneless,skinless breasts and doubled the sauce and threw in some fresh pineapple chunks.  The guest were late so the chicken got a little dry but the sauce was awesome, next I would try using thighs to avoid it getting too dry.  Make sure you line the pan!

I'm usually not a big fan of chicken thighs, but we had some extra and I decided to try this recipe based on the rave reviews. I'm glad I did! 

The thighs were moist and the flavor was rich and deep; I did slather some of the sauce under the skin before I cooked it and I believe that added some of the flavor to the meat itself.

One thing I wish I would have done was either oil the pan a little better or put a foil liner in it and up the sides; the sugar in the sauce burned to the glass in a few places and I'm still scrubbing!

Notes: I followed the directions to the letter and changed nothing. I even basted every 10 minutes, which was time consuming but worth it.

I thought this was good as well.  I doubled the sauce and used fresh ginger rather than ground.  I also used 1/2 cider and 1/2 rice wine vinegar as I ran out of cider - still was really good.  Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce.

HOLY SMOKES IS THIS GOOD! This tastes EXACTLY like the KC Masterpiece Teriyaki Marinade! At $2.58 a bottle and needing two for dinner this is a huge savings for us! I am adding this to my recipes tonight! Steamed some stir fry vegetables and steamed some white rice and have a wonderful dinner. I did make a ton more sauce. I poured some of the sauce into the bottom of the 9x13 pan then placed the chicken breasts on top and poured the rest of the sauce over them then baked for 1 hour. They were sooooo tender! Thanks for the recipe!

As advertised: good and easy. Since so many recipes from this site end up a bit bland, I souped up the glaze with some toasted sesame oil and hoisin sauce. Turned out great.

My family LOVES this recipe, it is one of the best just as is and SUPER quick and easy!

My suggestions (I will probably be repeating several, sorry!) Use boneless skinless chicken breasts rather than bone-in thighs to save on time. True, they have a lighter flavor. But they're a bit healthier and so much faster to cook. As written, this sauce is delicious, but really salty. I like salt, but this is too salty for me. Now just cutting back on the soy sauce would kill the flavor, so it's best if you can find reduced sodium soy, really. That will save you the flavor and kill the over-salted effect. I don't keep cider vinegar in the house, so I usually mix regular white vinegar with a splash of wine - works great! And a huge ditto to the many others who have said you MUST double, triple or quadruple the sauce depending on how much chicken you are making and how much sauce you like (ie, do you want extra to eat on rice.) As written, this recipe makes about a cup of sauce. That's enough to marinate a couple of chicken breasts well, but not enough for 12 thighs, or for people who like extra over rice. Just a FYI!

Do try it, it's really tasty and good, plus the sauce takes about 3 minutes to boil together. Et voila, you look like a fancy schmancy cook for putting it over chicken and rice! Yay!

I thought this was great, especially since I'm on a gluten-free diet.  I just used my wheat free tamari (soy) sauce, and ended up with a wonderful teriyaki sauce!  I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly, but I used chicken tenders instead of thighs.  I marinated the chicken for about 3 hours before cooking.  I've made this a few times now, and have baked it and grilled it on the bbq - both are great (although I think I prefer the grill).  I usually heat up the sauce that I marinated the chicken in (until it is 180 degrees so I don't have to worry about raw chicken in the sauce) and serve it over the chicken and some rice.  I'd been craving a good teriyaki chicken and rice dish since being diagnosed w/ Celiac disease. This definitely satisfied my craving!

Made this for supper last night and it was so easy and tasted wonderful!  I used fresh grated ginger, about a teaspoon, and an extra clove of garlic, which really helped to bump up the flavor.  The sauce was so thick and rich and really stuck to the chicken.  Boyfriend said it tasted 'incredible'.  Served on top of rice embellished with a little sesame oil and chopped green onion and steamed broccoli on the side.  Great dinner - definitely a keeper!

I made this sauce without the cornstarch and water and put my chicken thighs in it overnight to marinate. When I cooked it, I put it on the grill instead on low heat for almost 40 minutes. The sauce I put in a small saucepan on the grill, brought it up to a boil, and basted my chicken with it every 5-10 minutes when I flipped it. I was told this was the best chicken I've ever made in my life. Plus, I had hardly any cleanup! No sticky baking pans for me! Try this method!

This was a winner with my family!!!!  Made the sauce exactly as written (I did double it) and served with brown fried rice.  Fantastic!  Even my daughter, the most picky eater, loved it!

This was very tasty. I doubled the sauce as recommended by others,and there was plenty.Also,DEFINETLY line the bottom of your dish with tin foil,unless you are planning on throwing it out after!
Really good with rice.

I really really enjoyed this! I liked how easy this was. I didn't baste every ten minutes, just turned them over once in the middle. I only used about 1/3 of the chicken called for (it's just the two of us) but still used the whole recipe of sauce. It actually turned out to be much more than needed. We used the extra sauce on rice. It was great, and I'll definately make this again.

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I used 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts and doubled the recipe.  It had very good ginger flavor and was healthy. I will make this again but maybe next time put it in the crock pot and let it slow cook for the day.

This chicken recipe is really good.  I had no idea I could make teriyaki sauce. I did increase the garlic and decrease the ginger, because I am not really fond of ginger.    I would recommend that you use a disposable pan or line your pan with aluminum foil.  The sauce is very sticky and makes clean up difficult.

Very nice. I used the sauce on 4 thighs and 1 lb fillet of salmon. I stuck the thighs in for about 15 mins and then added the salmon and finished the cooking time for about 20 more mins. We both liked the salmon better but I think it's because we are not big fans of chicken on the bone. Next time I will do this recipe on chicken breasts.

Perfect! I made 6 servings using 2 cut-up chicken breasts, brown instead of white sugar, and baking about 45 minutes. Make sure to line your pan with foil as it makes cleanup easy. I served it with rice but can't wait to add some veggies next time!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. It's a weekly request in our house. If you have time I would highly suggesting marinating it in the sauce for 6-8 hours or even overnight....flavor is awesome and my husband cant stand vinegar.

I don't know what made me try this recipe because I've never liked teriaki sauce you buy in the jars.  This is fantastic and such a great recipe I've shared it with my friends who like to cook and think it would be great on pork, too.

i've never made teriyaki chicken from scratch before. this is simple, tasty and easy. I didn't use any cide vinegar, instead I just added a capful of white vinegar. I doubled the sauce recipe to drizzle over my white rice. I baked in a casserole pan initially then I transferred to foil on a regular pan because the chicken was not "crisping" at the tip! IT is awesome! I forgot to add that I used regular soy sauce but since I doubled it, I used half soy and half water and it still turned out yummy!

Delicious!  A bit salty, though.  Next time, I'll use low sodium soy sauce.  Also, many reviews said to double the sauce.  I, personally, found the recipe to yield plenty sauce.  Tip: if you don't use a silicone brush, your brush will smell STRONGLY!

Great recipe; juicy, flavorful chicken; everyone loved it!

Very easy & tasty.  I subbed brown sugar for the white sugar and used reg. soy sauce (instead of the light so many people suggested). I used chicken legs because that's what I had. My entire family went nuts over this.  Even my husband who "hates dark meat" ate three drumsticks!  Thanks!

Excellent recipe, my family loved it. I covered the thighs for the first 30 mins and then uncovered them and basted them for the remaining hour. I also added about 1/2 tsp of sesame oil to the sauce mix.

Wow this was awesome.  The only thing I had was chicken leg quarters, I made the sauce and injected some into the meat then basted only 2x, cooked at 400 for 1 hr.  So juicy and tender with an incredible flavor.  I did not cover at all.  I also doubled the sauce but did not double the soy and it wasn't salty at all.

This was very good!  Like others, I doubled the sauce, otherwise followed exactly.  Usually with chicken recipes I stick with boneless skinless chicken breasts regardless of what the recipe actually calls for, but this time I stuck with the thighs.  I'll probably try the breasts next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times now (in fact we are having this for supper tonight) and this is by far the BEST teriyaki chicken I have ever had.  My husband requests this recipe often.  I will never buy teriyaki sauce/marinade out of a bottle again, as the taste doesn't even compare to this.  The only thing I do different is lower the oven temperature to 350 when I bake it.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Makes a good stir fry sauce. I made it as described the first time,and it was a hit. The second time, I made the sauce, stir fried chicken and vegetables, tossed it together with the sauce and some pasta. Another good dinner.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband! At first I tried with chicken breast in the oven it was good. I marinated it for two days.  The second time I made the boneless chicken thighs on the grill and it was delicious. Thanks for this recipe I will make it all the time.

I really like this recipe!  I usually fix half the amount of chicken but still use all of the sauce on my rice and veggies.  I'd suggest cutting down on the sugar unless you like it really sweet.

I did tweak the recipe a bit due to other reviews by using 1/4c white and 1/4c brown sugar, and added fresh chopped ginger in addition to the ground. I was amazed at how wonderful the sauce was!!! I cooked only 6 chicken thighs and the sauce was just enough! I didn't use it all so I had extra to pour over the top just before serving. Wonderful recipe!! Thank you! I'm looking forward to trying it with beef and salmon!

Incredible!! Make double or triple the sauce so you can drizzle it over white rice. Will make again, my hubby loved it!

I didn't change a thing and like so many others, the teriyaki sauce was the best I've ever had.  Great flavor.  I've been searching for a good teriyaki and finally found it!  It was so simple to make too!  Thanks.

SO YUMMY!!  Made these the other night using bonless, skinless thighs. Used full amount of sauce even though I only had 7 thighs.  Also used fresh minced ginger and used all brown sugar (about 1/3 cup unpacked).  These were great!  I lined my dish with foil (great tip!) and cooked covered at 400 for about 30mins and then uncovered for about 10 - flipping and basting occasionally throughout, yum!  Next time need to make sure I have rice or something to use up the yummy sauce!

This is a very good chicken dish.  I modified it by using honey instead of sugar, fresh ginger instead of powder and white wine instead of vinegar and boneless, skinless breasts instead of thighs.  My spouse really liked it and he doesn't like chicken much.

Easy and delicious. My toddler LOVED this and he is not much of a meat eater. My husband joked that I "could make this every day." Instead of powdered ginger I used fresh, and added a dash of sesame oil. But otherwise followed the instructions as written, basting every 10 minutes. I may try others' suggestions for pouring 1/2 over chicken at beginning and 1/2 at mid-point of baking time just to save having to run back into the kitchen every 10 minutes.

I just had this baked teriyaki chicken for dinner and it was yummy! The sauce was easy to make and the chicken came out perfect. I used standard vinegar instead of cider vinegar because I didn't have it at home, and I cut the vinegar to 1/6 cup. I also dipped the chicken before baking them to give them more taste and poked the chicken with knife to create little holes for the sauce to be a little marinated to the meat. This is my first time cooking chicken and thank you for making it easy to make and to please!

This is delicious!  My family absolutely loved this.  My son asked that I make it for dinner tomorrow also, since he didn't get to eat as much as he wanted to.  I did not read the reviews so I didn't see that you should double the sauce, but i wish I knew, because I ran out quickly.  I just used the pan juices to keep basting.  It turned out great!

I paired this with the Rice with Summer Squash recipe I found here tonight.  Delightful.  I did replace the 1/2 cup white sugar with 1/4 cup brown sugar and then used to line the pan and covered it with foil for the first half of cooking.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Like others, I used tin foil in the pan – a must for cleaning, it made everything so much easier!!!  But I did not put tin foil on top, I found it juicy enough without, but I also cooked everything at 350 after about 20 minutes.  And I like my teriyaki sweet, but not too sweet, so by not using as much sugar, and using both brown & white sugar it made it perfect!  One last thing, definitely double the sauce!  You without a doubt need it!!!  Overall, it was amazing, so yummy!

I USED THIS RECIPE PURELY FOR THE SAUCE! I DOUBLED THE SAUCE INGREDIENTS & USED 10 PACKETS OF SPLENDA INSTEAD OF SUGAR. I ALSO ADDED 4 TEASPOONS OF FRESH GRATED GINGER (INSTEAD OF DRIED GROUND GINGER), 1 TEASPOON OF CRUSHED RED PEPPER FLAKES & 1/4 CUP OF PINEAPPLE JUICE. I PUT IT ON CHICKEN WINGS THE 1ST NIGHT & USED IT IN A CHICKEN STIR FRY WITH FRESH VEGGIES (RED PEPPER, WHITE ONION, BROCCOLI, MATCHSTICK CARROTS) AND CHUNKED PINEAPPLE SPOONED OVER WHITE RICE THE SECOND NIGHT...DELICIOUS!!!!

This was amazing! The only thing I did different was I added sesame oil and diced onion. This was so simple and delicious. So few ingredients that you will have them all on hand. Great for those nights you do not want to go to the grocery store.

This was soooo good and easy!! no complaints from my family. Thanks for this wonderful recipe I thought it would be to salty but it wasn't. I used 4 boneless, skinnless chicken breasts, and baked them 375 for first 15 minutes or so and then 350 for 30 minutes. REMEMBER baste EVERY 10 minutes and turn the chicken. I also doubled the sauce to have extra, plus, you WILL need it.

Delicious and so easy to make! When I have time, I use fresh minced ginger.  I also put foil on top to cover. It keeps the chicken tender but I remove the foil in the last 20 minutes.

This was very tasty! I did make a couple of minor changes. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs and, therefore, only baked them for 35 mintues. I substituted low sodium soy for the regular and used 4 tbl of honey instead of the 1/2 cup of white sugar. I agree with previous posters who suggested the sauce wasn't enough and after baking it half way through, I ended up making an additional batch of sauce to baste on the second round of baking and to have some for pouring over the finished chicken. I also agree that you should definitely line your baking pan with foil since this did make a burned on mess with the sauce on the bottom of the pan. I served this with roasted green beans and mushrooms which baked along with the chicken. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I used boneless chicken breast, that weren't very "meaty", so I wasn't that impressed. Everyone ate it and no one complained, that's always a good thing. I actually think I might try marinating it for a few hours and then cooking them on the bbq and basting with the sauce.

I needed to add like a pinch or two more cornstarch to make the sauce thicken up, and we didn't have minced garlic so I substituted a few dashes of garlic powder. The end result was still AWESOME, however. I will definetly be making this again. Dont be frighted by the taste of the sauce in the saucepan, it's much less potent after put on the chicken and cooked.

I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, and put in brown sugar as well as white. 

Thank you for the recipe! I will DEFINITELY make it again!

I made this for my Hawaiian Mai Tai party last night, and it was a big hit.  I followed other suggestions posted by reviewers, including cutting down the sugar a bit, but splitting between brown and white.  I made extra sauce and didn't have time to baste every 10 minutes, so just covered for the first 30 minutes, then turned and removed the foil for the second 30 minutes.  Juicy, carmelized a bit on the top, and great sauce to pour over rice.

Oh, and for those of you who know people who are gluten-intolerant, this is a great recipe provided you can find a substitute for soy sauce, which I did at our local Fry's.  It's a bit saltier, so I cut it down, but followed everything else and was able to serve a dish made separately to a dear friend, who said it was fabulous.  

Thanks for the great recipe!

EXCELENT!!!  My husband and I just finished eating this.  It was perfect.  :-)  I cut it down to just two chicken breasts and I cooked it for 45 min.  But I turned the chicken over at 15 min. and brushed some more sauce on it.  :-)  I served it white rice and steamed brocoli.  YUMMY!!!

I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, but in my opinion, that was just too much!  Most people cut the sugar in half, but I used 2/3c which was perfect, but no matter what I did, the soy sauce overwhelemed the dish!  My fiance and I both almost gagged eating it.  In my own opinion, I would definitely cut the soy in half rather than the sugar.  I used half the sauce on the chicken thighs, covered with foil, baked at 400* for 25 min, and then I poured the other half of the sauce on the thighs, and baked another 25 minutes.  The chicken itself was perfect!  Very tender and juicy!  I will definitely try this again, just not so much soy!

This was good as is, but next time I'll use cubed chicken breasts, add sliced onions while baking, and toss in some matchstick carrots and snow peas for the last 10 minutes.  Serve with rice for a complete meal.

I made this with chicken thighs with skin removed. Followed the recipe but used only 1/3 cup sugar. Came out great! Wonderful flavor!

Great recipe with things I already had in my pantry (I had boneless skinless thighs so I used that). Very easy to prepare. I didn't have fresh garlic though so I used about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and it was still very good. Thanks for the great recipe! I will NEVER buy the bottled teriyaki marinade sauce again!

This recipe would have been excellent but for one thing, WAY too much sugar. I would cut it in half if not less. I guess it depends on how you like your teriyaki. I believe you should rate the recipe based on its merit AS IS, not on how it turns out after you make a ton of changes. That way the rating system is actually accurate.

I really like the taste of this sauce for chicken.  I started it in the oven and finished it on the grill.  Think I cooked it too long in the oven, but that is my fault, not the recipes.  I will definately use this again.

This recipe was delish!  My entire family loved it.  It was so fast to make.  I didnt have cider vinegar so I used white vinegar instead.  I also tried adding a little pineapple juice and the end too...it was a good edition.  I tried grilling the meat after marinating for 2o minutes...super yummy.  I would give this recipe 10 stars...so much better than any bottle or jar sauce/marinade.

Very good. Maybe a little on the salty side. Next time, I'm going to try using a low-sodium soy sauce.

Good, I used chicken breast but I think to do true justice would be to use dark thigh meat.  

And just to confirm line the pan with something after many days of soaking the pan ended up in the trash.

The chicken turned out delicious and so very tender.  I think I will cut down on the amounts for the marinade.  I had some leftover after basting the chicken as instructed.  I definitely will make this again.

Great recipe.   Really easy.  Note to an inexperienced cook - make sure to mix the cornstrach and water before you add to sauce to avoid clumping.   I doubled the sauce and poured over rice and fresh steamed veggies.  yum!

This was really good!  I was skeptical that it would have a real teriyaki flavor, but it did.  I agree that it's too salty, so next time I will use low-sodium soy sauce.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts because its what I had, but I'd like to try it with boneless skinless thighs too.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was just fantastic. It took a while to cook, and with brushing the sauce every ten minutes, my hands were kinda warm, but it was definitely worth it! I added about half a cup more sugar to make it less salty.

Awesome!!  This is the recipe I have been looking for.  The chicken turned out very moist and not dried out.  Even my pick daughter enjoyed the chicken.  The chicken has a tangy sweet flavor the way teriyaki should be!!  Will definately make again.

This recipe was great!! I used 2 skinless boneless chicken breasts, an 8x8 pan, and 1/2 sodium soy sauce. I set aside most of the teriyaki sauce to use during and after baking. I baked the chicken in a preheated oven at 375 degrees fahrenheit for 30 minutes.

Before I put the chicken in the oven, I put a little bit of water in the bottom of the pan, and poured some of the teriyaki sauce over the top of the chicken. I baked the chicken for 15 minutes. Upon taking out the chicken, I drained off some of the liquid. Then, I flipped the chicken and poured some of the reserved teriyaki sauce over the chicken. After that, I put the chicken back in the oven for 15 more minutes. When those 15 minutes were up, I poured the remaining reserved teriyaki sauce over the chicken and served. 

The sauce tasted great, and the chicken was very tender. The chicken went great with chopped pineapple and grilled veggies on the side. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! Now I can make teriyaki chicken myself instead of buying it at a Japanese restaurant. :)

My whole family enjoyed this chicken. The sauce tasted great with the steamed rice served with the chicken.  The leftovers were great in a chicken fried rice a couple days later.

This is an awesome recipe. I've made it twice now, and my entire family raves about it. Both times I got lazy and didn't baste it, just dumped the sauce on top, and it came out great! Thank you!

I doubled the sauce, which was my mistake - I followed another reviewer's suggestion but it wasn't right with the boneless skinless breasts I had.  It is extremely sweet as well.  But it really does taste like teriyaki and would be great for kids.  Thank you for the recipe!

Amazing!! My whole family loved it. I didn't double the recipe and it was perfect, but next time I will cover with foil for the first 30 minutes to keep chicken a little more juicy. Thanks for sharing!

Moist and juicy! Lined 9x13 with foil. Marinated chicken thighs in half the sauce.  Then baked them in remaining sauce. Covered pan with foil.  Served with teriyaki noodles and broccoli.  Family enjoyed!

Okay I made this to a tee and the chicken turned out a little dry but the teriyaki sauce was really good, not sure what I did wrong but all in all was good.

I have never made teriyaki sauce before.  I am never going to buy teriyaki sauce again.  This was so easy and tasted sooooo good.  I am all about really savory food and this sauce was packed with flavor, my family really enjoyed it. Thank You!

This is great! I doubled the sauce and basted & flipped the chicken every 15 minutes. I really globbed the sauce on (for lack of a better term). It was soooo good. I served with rice. the rice absorbed all that extra sauce i put on the chicken. I tired this with chicken breast also but thought the thighs were so much better.

Followed the recipe exactly, except i used chicken breasts because thats what i had. I didnt take quite as long to took as the recipe said, probably because i used the boneless,skinless breasts. Conclusion: Delicious!

Pounded out chicken breasts to even thickness. Baked at 400 degrees. Poured entire sauce over and periodically basted chicken with it. Turned as well. Served over brown rice that had onion, lemon zest, and lemon in it. Scallions in the rice would be excellent. Next time I will make extra sauce to pour over top.

This recipe is amazing. I did take the advice of some others and added 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/4 white sugar. The brown sugar is a musst, but next time I won't use quite as much as it was a little too sweet for me.

This recipe is very good - I do make a few changes though - I add 1/2 cup brown sugar and only 1/4 cup white.  I also use cut up chicken breasts instead of thighs and from another reviewers suggestion I always cook it in a pan lined with non stick foil for easy clean up.

We loved this chicken. I used breasts and doubled the sauce and poured it over them, instead of basting and saved some sauce back and we poured it over the "onion rice" from this site. YUMMY.

I doubled the sauce as suggested by others which was too much. Tasty but not great. I may try baking on a rack instead of inside a pan.

This was really good! I didn't bake it, however. I cooked up the sauce, cubed my chicken and cooked it in a pan right on the stove. The only difference was adding just a touch more cornstarch to thicken. My boyfriend and I loved it and will remember to make a bigger batch next time!

The sauce for this chicken is really good. I usually cook with chicken breast only and was a bit skeptical using the thighs but used them anyway and I did not like them. I like this recipe and the sauce is awesome but next time I'll definitely do it with chicken breast.

soOo good!  must be aware of the time and temp control according to the size of breast or thigh.  got lots of rave reviews for the taste though.  very authentic teriyaki taste.  my bf's coworker even asked to taste the sauce, because it smelled so good;  he loved it.

The sauce came together beautifully - DELISH!  The only changes I made were I used boneless skinless thighs, I used half white and half brown sugar, and I dumped the entire pot of sauce over the chicken all at once.  The only mistake I made was that I rinsed the chicken without patting dry; so when I added that beautiful thick sauce it became quite watered down.  Didn't matter - this was still a 5 star recipe.  It's a keeper!

Excellent!  Scaled the sauce down to 4 servings and used for 2 boneless chicken breasts.  Baked in a 8x8 lined with foil and just poured the sauce over the chicken and turned a few times to coat.  Covered with foil and baked for 30 mins @ 400 degrees, spooning sauce over the chicken a few times during baking.  Only modifications I made to the sauce was that I used garlic powder and brown sugar instead of white.  This is definitely a keeper!  Not too salty or too sweet.  Way better than the bottled stuff and easy to make as well.

I loved the sauce, it is worth making extra for rice or vegetables, but the thighs turned out very dry which was disappointing.  Might try using hint to cover with foil the first 30 minutes next time.

Excellent. It was very very good. Two changes: I covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes like recommended by others and I used a large dash of cinnamon. I think it made all the difference. Will definitely make again!

Good. Baked it in the oven using chicken breast. Only used about 1/2 the marinade, saved other half for over rice. Husband thought it would be even better on the grill. Next time I think that I will put in less pepper because my daughter thought it was a little spicy.

Really 4.5 stars. After reading a lot of reviews, only changes I made was to decrease sugar (white) to 1/4c, used fresh grated ginger, low salt soy sauce.  covered with foil for first 30 minutes, then turned over and basted every 10 minutes for last 30 minutes (uncovered). You really want to line pan with foil for easy cleaning.  It was very good and will make again.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used low sodium soy sauce.  I also used skinless boneless Chicken Breast.  It was delicious.  My picky husband and y 2 yr old enjoyed the meal.  I served it with steamed Broccoli and fried noodles.

For changes I had 1/8 of soy sauce used white wine vinegar to equal 1/2 cup total. Used boneless skinless chicken breast in place of chicken thighs. Over all the dish was spectacular. Very moist and juicey.

? this recipe. Definitely company-worthy. It has a little too much ginger for us though, so I use 1/4 tsp instead of 1/2. Otherwise, fantastic!

Very good recipe. Everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was sub out the chicken thighs and used chicken breasts. I also cut the chicken breasts into strips so I could serve it over rice. I will definitely make this again!

These were really good.  I made a little extra sauce, and used thn boneless breasts. They cooked in 20 mins, so that didn't give me many bastings. I did line the pan with foil, but I don't know if I'd do it again; I know it helps in cleaning up (and how!), but the juices accumulate more when a pan is lined, and that dilutes the sauce. I added about a teaspoon of toasted sesame seeds to the sauce, and that worked really well. Might add tahini next time for an added flavor boost. I think this sauce would work REALLY well on salmon, and probably beef, too.

Very good and easy! I used fewer thighs but kept the same amount of sauce to put on rice and veggies. Also I didn't realize I was almost out of white sugar so I used half white and half brown sugar. With 3 children under 4 years old I didn't have time to go back every 10 minutes so I poured the sauce over it and baked about 35 minutes.

The sauce had a really good flavor and it was a very easy dish to make. But the chicken itself was very dry. I used boneless chicken breasts, though, so maybe that was the problem.

This was awesome; I cut up the chicken breasts in half, poured all the sauce on top prior to baking with pineapple chunks. I turned the breasts over midway through. The hubby LOVED IT

Fabulous! Perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I made the sauce and placed it over chicken tenderloins until ready to bake. I baked the chicken for about 30 minutes and flipped/basted it once. Perfect!

I am not a huge fan of chinese food, but with all the rave reviews, I decided to give this a try. I loved it, as did my husband who is somewhat of a picky eater. He would never eat rice with soy sauce, but he loved it in this recipe.  My three children enjoyed it as well.  I served it with brown rice w/ peas.  Very filling.  The only thing I did differently was I used it as  a marinade with 6 chicken breasts, baked 350 for an hour and I used two cloves of garlic instead of one.  Great recipe! Thanks

This was good - my husband said it was pretty good and he isn't a huge fan of chicken. I had to add Rice Wine Vinegar instead of Red Wine since I was out.

I changed this recipe a bit and got it to taste like the chicken they serve in the mall and my picky husband loved it. I added more sugar, a tad more ginger and some orange juice along with adding more corn starch in the beginning to make it a thicker sauce. I used chicken breasts and the thing I think that made this recipe was coating the chicken with the sauce every ten minutes like the recipe calls for. I did put the foil underneath the chicken to save my pan otherwise you will be scrubbing! Next time I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces then bake and coat as this will make the chicken even more like the mall chicken. I think I didn't cook it as long as it calls for but when your coating it every ten minuets then you can really see the progress and take it out once it's done. This was so good and it will go on my rotating menu since we loved it so much! Thank you for this recipe!

I'm changing my rating to 5 stars. I've made this 2x now, and both times to rave reviews. The second time, I made the sauce in advance, cooled it and put it in the fridge waiting for a night when I needed something fast. I baste the meat with the sauce, and I also add it to the stir fry veggies. Excellent. Thanks for the recipe.

We really enjoyed this with boneless, skinless thighs. I did not use all the sugar as called for and will cut back even more next time. I'm also a little concerned about the sodium so I will try a low sodium soy sauce next time. Baked covered with foil for about 40 mins total. Sauce really is excellent. I think it would be best with plain rice and broccoli or steamed snow peas. Don't let anything compete with the sauce. This will be easy to feed a crowd - I'm thinking next food day at work.

So GOOD!!! Definetly double the sauce especially since you have to brush the chicken with it every 10 min while cooking. I had just enough even with the sauce doubled. Will make again!

This recipe is sooo good!!  My husband wanted a teriyaki chicken with a thick, flavorful sauce, and boy, was this the perfect recipe!! I cut up the chicken in medium sized chunks after it had baked for 40 minutes, and let it continue baking in the sauce. We ate over rice and loved every last bite!! Hubby was very impressed.

I was super excited to try this one out! I followed the advice of others and lined the pan!  Great idea!  I also followed and doubled the sauce. I'm not a beginner cook, but I messed something up! I used apple cider vinegar, because that was the only cider vinegar I could find. I used a lite soy sauce. I did something WRONG!!  I used chicken breast- thick ones- and it only needed to cook for 40 minutes. Was very tender and juicy. But the sauce WAS Nasty!! I salvaged this by getting a paper towel and getting as much sauce off as I could. The whole time it was cooking my house smelled Nasty!  I would love to know what I did wrong. My family did like it, but only after I got as much sauce off as I could. Good luck!

This is the ONLY teriyaki sauce I have made and liked - a sure bet! I served it with brown rice and vegetables. Sauted geen/red peppers and onions are a perfect complement. Pea pods would be a nice addition as well. Enjoy and thanks for the recipe!

This was good. It's not like a teriyaki you'd find at a restaurant, but it's good nonetheless. I will make it again, maybe I'll add a little bit of orange juice or orange marmalade to cut the saltiness.

LOVE this recipe!  As others suggested, I cut out a bit of sugar (to ~1/3 cup) and used half the amount of chicken (more sauce per chicken that way).  My husband went back for thirds!

Great recipe! I doubled the sauce and used it to marinade chicken thighs. In the oven, put the skin down first. Everything else left the same. As others mentioned, line your pan with foil and spray with Pam.

Delicious! Followed the recipe for the most part. I used 9 drumsticks in a round glass casserole dish. Whoever recommended lining the dish with foil instead of greasing...I love you. That would have been the biggest mess in the world to scrub out of my pan. But with the foil. 1-2-3 and clean. Thanks. Also, I found the hr. recommended was perfect. I used a glass lid to cover my chicken the entire time to stay moist. And I found since it was covered, the sauce was thick enough to coat, cover, but never evaporated enough moisture to overly thicken. It was perfect and easy.

I really liked the flavor of this. I followed others' advice and lined my pan with tin foil. I also broiled at the very end to make a crust with the glaze. I did not use thighs.  I used Chicken Breast Tenders Strips from Costco. These worked fine, but they needed a lot less time then indicated for the thighs. I will use this recipe again. Thanks!

I loved it just the way it was. Next time I am going to use this marinade on chicken parts and try it on the grill! The sauce was delicious.

I thought this was easy and tasty. I followed others advies to line the pan and cover it during the first half of cooking. I also substituted the sugar with Splenda and only use about 1/8 cup. I used thighs which I think went really well with this and were so tender. I may double the sauce next time but otherwise this will be made again in my house.

This was really good and easy.  My kids even loved it.  The sauce was tasty and the chicken was moist.  I did not baste regularly; I baked it the first 30 minutes skin side down and then the second 30 minutes I turned skin side up and basted heavily so it would get nice and caramelized.  Thanks!

This chicken was very easy and tasty. I also used chicken breast and used lite soy sauce just like some reviewers did. It turned out better that expected.

a truly great recipe!  Hubby said, "you can make this again!"  That means he loved it and so did everyone else.  Watch the sauce carefully and don't overcook because it will get too thick.

Excellent sauce....but I guess that is really the recipe right?  ...the sauce. I didn't want to have to remember to baste so I poured sauce over chicken then baked. I then stir fried veggies and poured some sauce on the stir fry and served over rice. This was really good.  Like others, I'll never buy bottled Teriyaki again. Thanks for this recipe.

HOLY COW!! This was delicious..I burnt my mouth twice trying to shovel it in before it cooled down. I can't wait until summer, I'm going to whip up a batch of this sauce and baste some chicken thigh skewers on the grill! Thanks alot for the recipe..in the "box" it goes. Update..I made this again, and I added a Boneless skinless chicken breast with the thighs just to make a larger amount, and with the sauce that was left in the pan after cooking, I added a hefty helping of cilantro, tender crisp carrot shoestrings and sweet pea pods, and served it over rice noodles. It really tasted so awesome, sort of a Vietnamese flair...and as always, Delicious!!

Yes!!  This is a delicious way to prepare chicken!  Very easy and quick prep.  We had it with a green salad and was a perfect meal.  I did pour the sauce over the chicken in the pan instead of brushing it on, and did turn it over after 30 minutes of baking. I had made extra sauce as one reviewer suggested and ended up not needing it.  I did, however, add 1 more tablespoon of water to thin it out a bit because of the review that said hers turned black and stuck to the pan.  It worked great!  Easy clean up!

Great Recipe!  I'm not a great cook, I'm not even a good cook but I can follow directions pretty well.  This was easy.  My husband, picky eater that he is, loved it.  I gave it a 4 star because some of the pieces of chicken were dry but otherwise a great recipe.  Thanks! This is definitely a keeper.

This is the teriyaki recipe I have been looking for.  My only change was using chicken breasts and I should have sliced them thinner so that the sauce was more evenly distributed, otherwise this was a definite keeper.

Absolutely delicious. This is the best teriyaki chicken that I have ever had. The only change that I made was to use a whole cut up chicken in place of the thighs.  Served with Fried Rice II from this site and steamed broccli. My family loved it and I am sure that I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a keeper. My three kids ate it and liked it, so that is all that counts. I did have to substitute 1/8 tsp garlic powder for the one clove of garlic, and 6 boneless breast instead of the 12 thighs. (I can understand me forgetting the garlic at the store, but the chicken...! Anyways, I used what I had on hand) 
A great recipe to try!

To start of I am not a big fan of the kitchen...but this past weekend I wanted to give it a try and cook something for my honey. This recipe was awesome, it was easy to follow and it turned out great. I never would have thought I would be able to cook something this good.

Loved this easy recipe!  I added one sliced onion for fun and some frozen peas for color.  Definitely going into the regular rotation.  White rice is a must to go with this dish...

Very tasty! I couldn't get my sauce to thicken very well, but that didn't matter. It still turned out great! I used skinless, boneless chicken breast and it only took about 20-25 minutes to cook. I basted it every 5 minutes. Very nice flavor. Hubby loved it!

This is a great recipe!!! I loved it, even my picky husband loved it. It is easy, tasty and fast!!! I will recommend to be served over fried white rice. It is also great for those days when you are in a big hurry, instead of usig whole chicken pieces use boneless chicken ( bite size ). I will add this recipe to my weekly menu. Also great for dinner parties since it is hassle free. Serve over fried rice and decorate with chopped green onions... Thank for the recipe!!!

a little too tangy for our taste, maybe not so much vinegar?  it was pretty good and all the kids ate it.  It was also really good over rice.

Awesome recipe!  As per other reviewers, I chose to double the sauce.  I made it with boneless breasts and cooked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes one one side and then turned the breasts over and cooked for another 20 minutes.  I also covered it with foil for the first 20 minutes.  Thanks Marian for posting this easy and tasty recipe.

Too much tome in the oven (1 hour?!), it was very dry.
The sauce was also too sweet.
I've eaten better chicken teriyaki. sorry, i didn't like it, I thought it was better due to the hug amount of exelent ratings. didn't work for me.

This was really easy! the way I make it on the stovetop is i first sautee chicken breast completely on on side. When I turn it to the second side, i only let it get brown and then immidiately add the teriyaki sauce. Cover until the chicken is cooked through. To make the sauce thicker, I just remove the lid about half way before the chicken is completly done.

I thought this recipe was really good. It was a bit sweet for my taste so next time I will probably use half of what's called for. Even though I read the reviews, I still forgot to line my dish with alumninum foil! I'll have to remember to do that next time because I'm sure it would make the cleanup a lot easier.

Made this a few weeks ago and used the electric grill. I simmered up all of the marinade together, and marinated 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts along with 1 tablespoon of sherry in a ziplock overnight. I did bake it at first, but after 30mins, the chicken was still not cooked in the middle and not looking very nice on the outside. That's when the electric grill came out. They took about 10mins to cook through on the grill and they were absolutely delish! SO moist and juicy.

This was delicious!! Very Simple as well. 

Like others I made a few alterations. 

I had 1.36lb of chicken thighs. (thighs will make for a tender chicken)

I practically doubled the sauce:
2TBSP cornstarch
2TBSP cold water
1/4 cup white sugar (if you are worried about too much sugar I think you could cut this altogether) 
1/2 cup light brown sugar 
1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce (kept this the same since a lot of reviewers said it was too salty)
2cloves of garlic
1TSP ginger
1/2 TSP of ground pepper

In the large sauce pot that I made the sauce, after letting it cool a bit I placed all the chicken into the sauce and let it soak for a while. Maybe 10-15 minutes while letting oven heat up. ( I bet letting it sit overnight in a ziplock bag in fridge would be great too) 

375 for 30 MINUTES

I placed chicken on foil lined pan and brushed with more sauce on both sides. I place another piece of foil on top and close the sides and corners making sure it was nicely wrapped. 

Every 10 minutes I would take out of the oven and re-coat both sides and flip the chicken to the opposite side to cook, re-wrapping the foil. 

Served with seasoned broccoli. 

Fantastic!!

This turned out WONDERFUL! I served it with some white rice that I mixed soy sauce, ginger powder, Italian herb spices, and some cumin powder with. It had an excellent flavor and texture. Tip though for next time... line the pan with foil!! :-|

I followed the recipe and I added a small can of pineapple chucks with the juice into the baking dish with the chicken with onions,red and green peppers. I poured the sauce a little at a time every 10 minutes and turned it over and did it again until the chicken was done.  There was some sauce left in the dish and it was good to serve over some rice.  My two year old could not get enough of this chicken!!!  Our family loved it. Thanks!!!!

Very good. Made as directed except covered for part of the time. I did let my sauce boil down to a thick consistency, but it still thinned out some while in the oven.  Maybe because I covered the chicken for a while?  Anyhow, this is very good and I will make again. I will try boneless skinless chicken breasts next time as others have suggested. Thanks!

Came out really good. I could noly find regular chicken thighs (with the skin on) and the skin did get a bit mushy. I would recommend if you can only find skin, then just take the skin off. Other than that, a really good recipe.

This was the best chicken I have ever made! I double the sauce (using 1/2c sugar and 1/2 splenda) and added an extra clove of garlic. So tender and flavorful, my family was asking for it again the next day!

I used chicken breasts and doubled the sauce.  Next time I will not double the sauce as it was way too much.  It also was a little too sweet for my liking and I consider myself a sweet tooth.  I will definitely make again.

I was a bit put off by the strong aroma of the cider vinegar cooking, but it mellowed out for the final product.  Everyone enjoyed it at the dinner table, but I wished for a stronger flavor.  It wasn't bad, I just wish it wasn't so mild.  We don't eat skin, so I skinned the chicken thighs and just poured all the sauce on the meat... too time consuming to baste every 10 minutes.  It made a great dinner that I'm glad everyone enjoyed (this is rare in our house).

In response to the review "CookinCA" wrote, I have always used BNLS/SKL Chicken Breast and only cook it for 20-25 min. uncovered. Chicken breast doesn't take very long to cook. Try making it again but just dont cook it for so long. It really is a great dish.

Fantastic recipe. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. I made it twice so far. First time I didn't have ginger and second time I did. I liked it more without the ginger. Per some others, I added water chestnuts and chunck pineapple.  I used light soy sauce and used breasts instead of thighs but sliced them to make them thinner.  I lined the pan with foil making cleanup a breeze. I served it with brown basmati rice along with mushrooms. I'm definitely going to serve this for my "Christmas Buffet" that I have with friends a Saturday just before Christmas.

Good! Had company over and they all really enjoyed. I made this along with chicken fried rice and cheese wontons (all recipes found on this site and I gave a review for). What an excellent and complete meal. NO changes were made. Just make sure to turn the chicken every 10 minutes to baste with the sauce.

This teriyaki sauce is so good!  I made just the sauce and used it with cubed steak, green peppers and onions served beside brown rice. My husband and I mixed everything together with the sauce and ate every bite (this sauce tastes great with rice). The only changes I made was to use pickled, sushi ginger, minced well, and powdered garlic. Still turned out excelent! Thanks fot the keeper!

After I started preparing the sauce, I realized that I didn't have any ground ginger. I took a chance, and glad I did. Even without the ginger, it was delicious. I also used convection for the baking, which browned the skin nicely.

Wonderful recipe.  I used the exact recipe for the sauce and used half the amount of chicken thighs.  Used low sodium soy sauce.  Delicious with rice and stir fried veggies.

I followed the rec exactly except I used chicken breast. Meat was juicy but sauce wasnt really thick and didnt stuck to the chicken as well as I expected. I wouldnt really call it teriyaki, but flavor was still nice for a change.

This was delicious! The absolutely only thing I will change is the thighs. None of us cared for them. We will definitely be making this again real soon but will use chicken breasts from now on. Great recipe!

After reading all the glowing reviews I couldn't wait to try this, and unfortunately I was very disappointed. I made it specifically according to the original recipe, except using garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and also used low sodium soy as recommended, but it was very salty, and dry (used skinless/boneless breasts too). I had high hopes but it fell short...Cooked covered 30 and uncovered 30 basting every 10 on the last 30 as well. Might try again with major tweaking.

Just made last night.  Didn't know how good this would be at first since I've never tried "baking" teriyaki chicken, but within the last minutes of cooking I could tell it was going to be good when I saw the glaze on the chicken.  My husband loved it (as did I), so this is definitely a winner and a keeper.

Made this three times so far.  First time I doubled the sauce, using only 3/4 cup of the sugar, and baked it.  Second time I used the grill (fabulous).  Tonight I baked it again, I'd love to try it in the crock pot.

If you have not made this recipe yet, you have to try it! It is so super easy and it has tons of flavor. If I ever have to bring a dish to someone, this is what I bring along with some basic white rice. Kids love it as much as adults!

This was so good!  The sauce was just excellent!  I made this using boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but didn't change anything else...sure it would be much better with the skin on thighs..but we are watching fat :)  Thanks for the great recipe...I'm using it again tonight and trying it with steak!

This is soooooooooooo good. the only thing I did different was instead of minced garlic n ground ginger I used a ginger/garlic paste, doubled the sauce and added frozen mixed vegetables. I only re-brushed it once 30 minutes before it was done. Still tasted great especially over rice!! whooo hoo!

My husband loved this! I only had a little less than 1/4 cup soy sauce left so that's all I used but I think that I would do it the same way next time. Also, I used red wine vinegar since that's what I had. I did not cook the marinade on the stovetop the first time I made this, I didn't realize I was supposed to, when I made it again I did bring it to a boil but we didn't like it as much like this. Next time I will mix the marinade and just pour over chicken right before I put in the oven. Usually teriyaki chicken has too strong of a soy sauce taste for me. I made the sauce ahead of time and threw it in the fridge. This was a nice easy meal to make with 2 small children demanding most of my attention.

This was amazing the whole family loved it. Next time I think I'm going to let it sit and marinate for awhile. I didnt use as much soy sauce and added more corn starch to make the sauce a little thicker. Will definately add this to my recipe box. Thanks

This was great! I used skinless chicken breasts - and since my husband is not a fan of white meat, i prepared the sauce the night before and let the chicken slices sit it in overnight. In the morning, i put it in the convection oven for 35mins while i gave my daughter a haircut. It came out really tender with a nice sticky sauce. Thanks for sharing this. I will continue to prepare this over and over. :)

The sauce didn't do so well for me. I followed the recipe to the letter. I actually found it to be a little too bland, and a little too thin.

Yummy! I followed the sauce directions to a tee, plus added a teaspoon of sesame oil like another user recommended. It tasted way too vinegar-y - until I let it cool in the fridge overnight when I marinated the chicken in it. The taste mellowed out it and was perfect.

Following other users' suggestions, I put foil over the pan for the first 30 minutes, and then dumped off the juices from the drumsticks. When I put the drumsticks back into the oven, I took off the foil and put more sauce on top of the drumsticks and kept basting every ten minutes until the hour was up. The meat was incredibly tender and my friend couldn't believe the sauce was made from scratch.

But yes - the pan is a mess. I must remember next time to line the bottom with foil!

edit: I made this for my coworkers. They loved it so much they asked for the recipe.

Great recipe! I used boneless, skinless breasts and cut the sauce in half because I used only 4 breast halves. But next time I will make the full amount of sauce so there is some left to spoon over rice.

I'm giving 3 stars because I thought it was on the salty side and a little too sweet. If I decide to make it again I will cut the soy sauce and sugar in half or maybe use brown sugar. Another thing is the clean-up. HORRENDOUS!

Delicious, quick and easy --- just the way I like it. I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast (I find the former more tender and juicy) and have had to substitute brown sugar (along with a bit of maple syrup just for kicks) for the white and white vinegar for the cider because it was what I had on hand and it still tasted great.

Very simple meal, my son loved it!!! I almost baked the chicken to a crip, just the way I like it, and I copied some other examples by simply pouring the sauce over the chicken then baking. Yummy!!!

I used boneless chicken breasts, poured the sauce right over it and baked it.  It was delicious.  The leftovers were just as good and were gone in a day!

The chicken really packed tight into the 9x13 pan.  Absolutely delicious & worth the effort to baste as it bakes.

This was nearly perfect! The only reason I am not making this a 5 star recipe is that I am not for super sweet foods, and this is pretty sweet... but it is still SOOOOO good!!!

The sauce was amazing! I actually used Teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce which gave it a bit sweeter taste. I also used brown sugar instead of white.
 I think next time I will marinate the chicken like others have suggested, the sauce didn't soak in very well. I will certainly try this one again!

I used Boneless/skinless and it was rather bland on the inside.    Maybe next time I will marinate the chicken in the sauce for the day first.  The sauce was delicious though!

This was a very good recipe. My fiance hates chicken, and he asured me this was great! I will tweak this a bit though. I think next time, less sugar, and i combined all the ingredients and poured over top the chicken and baked, then the sauce is thick with some left over, and less work! Thanks for the recipe.

This chicken was so easy to prepare! My boyfriend loved it.  It is definetly a recipe that I will use time and time again. The first time I used chicken breast and baked them at 375 flipping once at fifteen minutes. I also substituted garlic salt for the garlic.

GREAT! I used this recipe last night. My whole family was licking their fingers and wanting more sauce to pour on their rice. I'm glad I doubled the sauce, but now I wished I tripled it! I added more ginger than the recipe called for. Will definitely use again. Thanks!

It was very easy to make but way too salty.  I even used the low sodium soy sauce.  I don't think I will make this again.

I used boneless skinless thighs and they cooked in 30 minutes at 450 degrees.  I substituted brown sugar for the white and rice wine vinegar for the cider vinegar.  I also added a teaspoon of sesame oil to the marinade for flavor.  This was delicious and I highly recommend it.

The chicken tasted pretty good.  Fine for a weeknight dinner. Next time I would marinate the chicken for several hours for more flavor.

I dont know why but this sauce didnt carmelize on the chicken like it was supposed to.  It may have been because I used chicken breasts and it wasnt cooked as long but I saw other reviewers who used chicken breasts and they said that theirs coated well.  Mine basically was runny from the start.  I added a little more cornstarch to it to thicken it a little more but maybe there needed to be more added.  I might try to make this one more time just to see if it turns out.  Overall it tasted good but Ive had better tasting teriyaki sauce before.  This in my opinion tastes almost like the bottled stuff which im not to fond of.

I didn't have any ginger so I didn't include it. I followed the advise of others and dumped all the sauce in the pan prior to baking the chicken. I basted for the last 30 minutes. The chicken turned out delicious and juicy. My boyfriend raved about it. The only reason it didn't get five starts is that the meat was flavorful all the way through. I will try marinating it next time.

Astounding amount of reviews... too many to read so I just read a few of the more helpful ones, and took it from there. The sauce was easy to mix up, and chicken did come out tender. However, I may have put too many vegetables ( potatoes, carrots, onions ), so instead of caramelizing, it got a little watery. Delicious though, so we will make it again. Thank you for sharing.

Great! Doubled the recipe and served over rice and added stir fry veggies. Great tip to line the pan with foil, saved lots of scrubbing time.

Fantastic! Will make again!

This is awesome!  I did decrease the vinegar by half based on other reviews. Have tried this in the oven and today I tried it in the crockpot with skinless thighs. I doubled the sauce so we would have extra to go on rice. I's great either way!

Good, but really created a sticky black mess in my pan!  I will definitely use foil to line my pan next time.

This is one of the best dishes i have tasted, just like many others i too used boneless skinless breas, but i pounded mine about a 1/4 of and inch thick and in total i only cook the chicken for a max. of 15 min. Very Quick and simple dinner. This sauce is so rich i Love this recipe. Definatly a Keeper

Great recipe! My teenage daughter gets so sick of chicken but loves it when I make this one! Thank you! I always bake in about 1/2 the time though. Maybe it's just our oven?!

Good recipe. Not as sweet as I feared with all that sugar. The sauce didn't thicken very much, but that's okay. I just dipped the thighs in it, and then poured it in the dish rather than basting it every ten minutes. Turned it once, and that's it. Served it with sticky rice and stirred fried veggies.

The chicken was good, but I did not like the sauce on the rice.  I could really taste the apple cider vinegar.  Rating 4 for the chicken.

This was good.  I used white meat chicken because I already had it on hand.  I did like the sauce, but it didn't thicken like I thought it would.  I also reduced the oven temp because 425 seemed really high for an hour.  It was good...thanks for the post.

This was delicious.  I fixed this for dinner tonight and got nothing but high praise from the entire family.  Followed the recipe exactly except I quadrupled the sauce and used 8 boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into large chunks.  Served it with rice and steam brocolli.  This will be a regular on our menu.  So easy and good.

This recipe was so easy to follow and family and friends loved it.  I dumped all the sauce on top and used chicken tenderloins.  Came out very tender and flavorful.  It took a little while for the sauce to begin to simmer so I got worried and turned up the heat. It still came out perfect!  Thanks!

Great recipe! I started by pouring 1/2 the teriyaki over the chicken.  I then used the rest to bast it a few times during cooking (I thought every 10 minutes was too labor intensive).  The underside that was sitting in the teriyaki was very moist and flavorful but not carmelized like the side that was just basted - so I can see the point of only basting it.  But either way it was very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I used boneless, skinless thighs and tossed them with some 5-spice powder.  Threw them in the wok with some oil, added some mixed veggies and then poured on the teriyaki sauce (only half the sugar and 1 tsp each of garlic & ginger and sub'd red wine vinegar).  It makes the perfect stir-fry, 15 mins later!

Just found this recipe yesterday, and went home and made it last night. I must say, I am an awful cook, but this recipe was EXCELLENT! It turned out SOOOOOOOO good! I did as others suggested, and doubled the sauce. Also lined the pan with foil. Big help! No mess! I served with rice and steamed broccoli. I used the sauce over the rice and broccoli. Very very good! My boyfriend was impressed! Thank You! Definately a keeper!

My picky 3 year old took one bite and said "UMMM... this is SOOOO good!"  You can't get a better recommendation in my book.  I made this without reading the reviews and next time I will line the pan with foil.  I made a half batch of the sauce since I only had 1/2 the soy sauce and I only cooked 1 full chicken breast, cooked for 40 minutes.  I recommend doubling the sauce also.  I don't even normally like Teriyaki, but this isn't too strong and the ckicken is very moist.  I marinated it for about 2 hours.  Can't wait to try it on the grill.

I loved the mild, yet tasty flavor to this recipe. If cooking in a glass dish, I suggest lining it in foil. The coating really bakes itself on and I literally had to scrape it off.

Yum, this was great and easy.  I used 3 boneless chicken breast cut in threes.  I cooked at 375 for 45 minutes.  My boyfriend thought it was a bit salty, so next time I would use low salt soy sauce.  This will be a regular recipe.

I added way too much cornstarch, but it still came out so good...best teriyaki chicken I've ever had by far.

This was awesome!  My husband, who is a picky eater and is concidered a very good cook, could not stop talking about how good this sauce was!  He is planning on using it on all kinds of meat!  I had to substitute Rice vinegar because I didn't have any Cider vinegar.  After reading the other reviews, I lined the baking pan with Heavy tin foil.  After cooking, I just rolled up the tin foil and put the pan back in the cupboard!  It didn't have a spot on it!  THANK YOU

This was so good! I asked my boyfriend to taste it and he said "I don't need to taste it, it smells amazing". It did and it tasted amazing too.  I did double the sauce because I love sauce. Definetely double it if you like to have extra sauce.  Thanks again!

This is the best teriyaki chicken I've ever had or made. My husband and friend rave about it. I use bone-in thighs, and cook the chicken with all of the sauce in baking pan. It makes great juice that I use to coat steamed brocolli, and it is sooo yummy. I also make resturant style eggdrop soup to go with this meal. White rice is a must to balance out the meal. :)

Our family enjoyed this chicken. I followed the recipe to the "T" and I thought it came out great, my only thing was I would have liked it a little sweeter. I will make this again.

Really tasty!  I doubled it for a party and used skinless breasts too. Since I used bone-in chicken I lowered the oven temp to 375 and just cooked the chicken a little longer.  I also threw in some pineappple rings during the last 2o mins of cooking.

I made this for a memorial day picnic this sping.  It was very good.  I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  It seems very pungent at first, when I am making the sauce, but truns out pretty mild, yet quite flavorful.  I prefer a marinade that sits for a long time and becomes quite powerful, but this is great when you are in a hurry.

This recipe definitely resulted in success.  I followed it in terms of basting the sauce the sauce over the chicken.  But i tried something a lil different the two times I made it.  The first time, I took a cup of soy sauce seperately and used it occasionally for dipping.  It added a different flavor to it that was actually great.  But make sure u use a low sodium soy sauce.  the second time I did the same thing using the leftover sauce that I made.  Went great with California Blend and cheese

This is a great and easy recipe. It took a little time for the sauce to thicken, but it turned out to be the perfect texture.  Like others said, it was too salty.  Next time I'll use low sodium soy sauce.

When I first made this, and I told my husband that I made the sauce as well, he didn't believe me!!  He swore up and down the sauce came from a bottle, so I made him see if he could find a teriyaki sauce bottle and he couldn't!  He did find all the ingredients that I used though and now we used that sauce on so much!  It's also awesome on grilled chkn!

This is very good.  The soy sauce does make this dish just a little too salty for our tastes, but perhaps with low-sodium soy sauce that might be fixed.  We will be trying this one again because it has such a good teriyaki flavor once we cut back on the salt.  The chicken was very tender as well.

This was a very tasty recipe and the preparation was a breeze.  I used chicken tenderloins and baked them for 15 minutes at 375, flipped them and covered the pan with foil (to prevent them from drying out), and baked for another 15 minutes at 350.  Also, lining the pan with foil as one reviewer suggested was a great idea.  Clean up was super easy.  Next time I might use lite soy sauce as the glaze was a bit too salty.

This is a very yummy dish. I used chicken breasts (partially frozen) intead of thighs. And to cut the time even more, I cut the breasts into large pieces. The cooking time was only 30 mins and I basted every 5, and turned the pieces over at 15 minutes. Turned out great. I will for sure make again. Thanks!

This was o.k....The sauce was good...I added extra garlic....The chicken was a bit dry...I did use boneless chicken breasts, maybe that's the reason...I doubled the sauce so we could dip the chicken in it...Yummy sauce :)

Changed heating to 375, started with half frozen breasts, and 45 mins was enough.  At first I thought sauce (as directed) would be too much, but turned out fine.  Would only recommend more if you wanted to add to rice or side dish.

I dont want to be negative, but I thought this was just okay.  It was way too salty for my taste, I used chicken breasts, that may have had something to do with it.  I probably wont make this again.

Awesome chicken!!! I don't care for teriyaki that much but I love this recipe. It would be terrific for a picnic/family reunion. ( I tried it with pork loin and it ruined my pan) It needs the fat of the chicken thighs to not stick.

This has a excellent sauce to it but I found that my chicken was a little dry. My children or my husbanc like this too much but I thougth it was good.  I will use the sauce recipe again for sure, maybe for a marinade or a grill sauce.

I'll be making this again!  I used lemon juice instead of the vinegar and used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  There was extra sauce for a veggie stir fry.  I also baked for slightly less time.

This was really good!  I served it for Easter dinner, and everyone loved it.  I used split Cornish hens instead of chicken and cooked them for 1-1/2 hours, basting every 15 min.  Served with stir-fried asparagus, jasmine rice, and strawberry shortcake for dessert, it made a great holiday meal without a lot of fuss, so I could spend the bulk of the day with my family.

This recipe is fabulous!! I foiled the dish and also covered it on top except for the last 5-10 min.  I halved the recipe which turned out perfect for us newly weds. Dont be fooled by the smell!! The whole time it was cooking and that I made the sauce it did not smell pretty. I had doubts but it turned out SO good, and I will definitely make it again. I accidently used bone in chicken thighs, but next time I will get them without the bones! THANK YOU for the recipe!

Good but very salty and I used lite soy sauce. Pineapple would be good in it or on top as a garnish. As others suggested, double the sauce and use half to pour over chicken when serving. Can't wait to try over grilled chicken!!

Everyone from my picky husband to my super-picky 5-year-old was impressed with this recipe!  

I did make two small changes... I used low-sodium tamari rather than soy sauce because I like the taste of tamari better.  (Trust me, whatever you use, you want to make sure it's low sodium.)  And I used chicken tenderloins, cooked them at 350 for 20, basting every 5 minutes.

So.  Yummy.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I've used it on chicken & pork, and plan on using it as a stirfry sauce next time I stirfry.  It's easy & quick.  My brother (who is fairly picky) even loved it & asked for the recipe.  Thank you!

This was great!  I used chicken legs and thighs.  You NEED to cover your baking dishes with foil or have fun scraping off all the burnt sugar!  This tastes great with broccoli and hot white race.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Excellent! I would definitely line my dish with foil next time as it made kind of mess that required soaking.  This was really tasty.  I happen to have breasts instead of thighs but it was still very moist and flavorful. Will definitely make again. Thanks.

Delicious!  I cut the sauce in half because I only had 4 chicken thighs but left the garlic as is and it was truly fantastic.  It was so easy to prepare as well!

Awesome recipe! The chicken was flavorful and delicious. I tried a combination of skinless, bonless thighs and wings. The thighs were much better. I'll definately make this one over and over again as my 5-yr old sked for seconds as he was stuffing his mouth. :)

This was great. I didn't let the sauce thicken up because I was inpatient but it still turned out good. It definitely would have been better if the sauce was thicker so I will make it correctly next time!

Yummy!  My enitre family LOVES this (including 3 kids)!  I substituted lite soy sauce, flour, and a mixture of Splenda and a little brown sugar since that is what I had on hand.  It turned out perfect!  I will definitely be making this again!

This was absolutely amazing, and very easy.  Maybe next time I will just bake the chicken in all the sauce, without taking the time to baste it every ten minutes.  I think it will turn out just as yummy, and be even easier!

This was pretty good, but all of the basting was a bit of a pain - my husband thinks it's tastes like the chinese food chicken you get at the mall.  Not sure if I'll make again...?

Don't know what I did wrong with this but something wasn't quite right.  Used boneless chicken breast instead of thighs.  Mine turned out very dry, salty, and I didn't have any "juice" to mix with the rice when served.  Again, I'm sure this is delicious but mine just didn't turn out.  Thanks anyway!

I made the sauce and used it on salmon instead, cuz that's what my SO requested, it was fantastic. Tastes better than some restuarants, and exactly like others, loved it.

My husband liked this more than I did so I guess I'll be making it again sometime for him but I didn't care for it. I used chicken tenders. I think if it was to be marinated it would be better flavor. I served it on Basmati rice which was a good combination.

I love this sauce. It makes a very tasty marinade for chicken lettuce wraps. I cut chicken breasts into small pieces and bake them in the sauce, then sprinkle the chicken with sesame seeds and wrap it in butter/Boston lettuce and add julienned carrots, cucumbers, chopped green onions and black mushrooms. They are always a hit!

This was really tasty!  I think it needed a bit MORE sauce.  Next tme I will double the sauce for this amount of chicken because everyone wanted some sauce on their rice and there was not enough to go around.  Other than that it was delicious!

This was a great recipe!  I used splenda in place of the sugar and boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into strips.  I lined the pan with tin foil so clean up was a snap.  The ultra picky boyfriend enjoyed as well. Thanks Marian!

I didn't follow the teriyaki sauce recipe, but instead just used the baking method with my own favorite teriyaki recipe--it came out beautifully.  I had to turn on the broiler and baste frequently at the end to get that perfect glazed look, but otherwise the recipe was perfect and I highly recommend it.

This recipe is wonderful!!  My entire family loved it- including my 4 year old.  I did add some pinnapple juice and used brown and white sugar to make it.  The sauce does take some time to cook so I started making the sauce a day ahead of time so that I'm not rushing to finish dinner on a weeknight.

Very good recipe!  It was gobbled at the supper table and had meny good reviews.  I did add a 8oz can of crushed pineapple because it seemed really sour and salty but it came out a little too sweet so I will try again without it.  A keeper I think.

I thought this was very good, but with the time it took and with all the ingredients, I find it just as good and easier to buy the store bottled teriaki sauce. It's great for people who like to make things from scratch though. I probably won't make this again.

I did not eat this, but my b.f. gave it only three stars. I marinated it all day, then baked, brushing extra sauce on top. He, howeveer is not a big "sauce" fan.  He said it would have tasted just as good plain.

I made this with boneless/skinless chicken breast. My family loved it!!!! They then asked me to make it the very next night and I used chicken wings. Delicious then also. We even used it on the fried rice I cooked. Thanx

Made this twice, once in oven on breasts, once on stovetop with bite size pieces of meat. Great both ways! Fast when simmered on the stove until chicken is cooked through. (less mess too)

I made this for dinner last night and it was fabulous!  Even my picky daughters loved this homemade teriyaki sauce.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used an oven bag for easy cleanup.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This recipe was okay, but nothing great. Do not cook the chicken as long as it says unless you like overcooked dried out chicken.

It came out really well. I used a pound and a half of boneless-skinless checken breasts and just flipped them every 15 minutes during cooking. They took only 45 minutes and came out well.

I put foil in the pan and greased that instead. The sugar tends to make baking    dishes hard to clean up.

This is a great sauce for stir-fry. I cook a variety of veges, throw in some peanuts and chicken, add the sauce until it thickens, and serve over rice. Yum! It will become a regular.

This is a great dish.  I used boneless chicken breats instead of thighs and cut the cooking time down a little.  I also doubled the sauce and divided it to save some for use on top of veggies and rice. mmmmm

Very, very good sauce!  Made the recipe to a T with the exception of using chicken legs with the backs attached.  As others said this sauce takes a long time the thicken, about 40 mins on low, so be prepared, but it is well worth it!  I think I'll try chicken breasts next time and see how that works.  This sauce is my one and only teriyaki sauce now, thank you Marian!

Yummy teriyaki goodness. It takes a little while for the sweet sauce to thicken, but I kept it on low heat while I was cooking the chicken so the other two basting times saw thicker and thicker sauce. I also used drumsticks instead of thighs and it worked just fine with a lower cooking time.

This recipe was so good it was SMOKE’N!  

I followed the recipe to a T and I could not have been happier.  Such great flavor and man oh man was that chicken juicy.  Anyone that gives this recipe less than 5 stars is probably a closet vegan.  :-)  Ha!

Truly a recipe worth giving a shot.  Thank you, Marion!

Soooo good! And I don't like dark meat! My entire family and my company raved. Great with crushed pineapple mixed in while basting in the 2nd half. Ate with jasmine rice and stir-fried vegetables, made with 1/2 brown sugar. My pickiest son asked for seconds. Thanks!

Yummy! Im doing the low carb lifestyle so suffice to say could not use the sugar..substituted an equal amount of splenda, decided to also keep the tablespoon of cornstarch since the sauce was going to be divided among six chicken breast...great recipe and very adaptable to the low carb diet! thanks

This was great! I skimped a little on the sugar and added some green onion and a little cayenne for a bit of a kick. Even the VERY picky 11 and 12 yr olds liked it!

I used the sauce to marinade steak and chicken for kabobs. My husband loved them and said our 16 month old baby couldn't get enough of the chicken. Too bad I had an evening out with my mom and missed the end results. It just it gives me an excuse to use this recipe again!

after we tasted the sauce we thought this would taste terrible, but when it was cooked it was allright. don't double the sauce if your only using two boneless breasts.

WOW. This was yummy. There werent any leftovers, thats for sure! The only thing I did differently, was that I added a small can of crushed pineapple to the sauce before baking, and that did it for us. Thanks, I will use this many more times.

I made this up, in a skillet(by using cubed chicken instead of whole breasts), and tossed it in with some bow tie pasta.. it's a huge hit at my place. :)

Pretty tasty- I used 2 boneless chicken breasts. A little sweet for me- next time I will increase the garlic and reduce the sugar. Also, I ran out of sauce so I will double the sauce next time to make it even more flavorful.

Everybody in the family loved this chicken. The teriyaki sauce so 10 times better then the stuff you buy at the store. The chicken came out real juicy. Used breasts unstead of thighs.

This was okay.  My kids ate their serving but not enthusiastically like others have mentioned in their reviews.  I used brown sugar and lite soy sauce.  I am not sure why everyone likes this so much other than it is easy.  I doubt I will make this again.

This was a great recipe for chicken teriyaki to use in the winter when the grill isn't available.  My husband and young children loved it. I doubt I'll ever buy a teriyake marinade again.  Thanks!!

Wow! What a great recipe, and simple, as well. My husband said it tasted like the teriyaki chicken at our favorite Japanese restaurant, and even my kids liked it. I used light soy sauce, and found the saltiness exactly right. I also added about a tsp of sesame oil and a shake of onion powder, plus lots more than one clove of garlic. I used other reviewers suggestion of 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar. I didn't bother w/basting, but ladeled 1/2 the sauce over the chicken (turning each thigh to coat well), then added the rest of the sauce at the 30 minute mark. Since I used boneless, skinless thighs, I just cooked for an additional 20 mins -- perfect. My only problem was not enough sauce -- I'll double it next time! Soooo yummy over rice.

Fantastic!  I used this recipe as a sauce for stir-fry.  It was fantastic and I will do as others on this board and make a lot to refrigerate for easy use.  It was really yummy!  Thanks for sharing.

Think BBQ.  Use this as a marinade.  I marinaded for 4 hours.  Lots of sugar so you have to keep it low on the grill - 250-300.  My daughter, who is a fussy eater requested again this several days after I first tried it.

This sauce was easy and quite tasty!  I made one change. I used sweet soy instead of regular soy and left out the sugar. Probably should have lowered oven temp., as some of the chicken pieces got a little dry.  I'm sure it would work for any cut of meat though and could be used for grilling and stir fries. Good recipe!

This is a very user-friendly recipe.  I kept sauce warm while baking since had to brush frequently.  Also, removed some of the juices part half way through. Also good reheated as left overs.

This had to be the best Teriyaki chicken that myself and my family has tasted.  Everyone said it was better than resturants teriyaki.  I used boneless chicken and added more water and cornstarch to thicken it up some more, but other than that, the recipe was great!

Excellent sauce!  I doubled the garlic, used lite soy sauce and covered the dish with foil.  Very good recipe.  The whole family loved it.  I thought it tasted better than any restaurant.

DELICIOUS! I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs (8) and doubled the sauce to drizzle over rice.  I reduced the baking time to about 45-50 minutes- the chicken came out juicy and TENDER. I also reduced the sugar considering the advice of previous reviews.

Awesome!  I halved the recipe and started my chicken thighs partially frozen so the cooking time worked out fine.  I did lower the temperature to 400 degrees.  Delicious teriyaki sauce; don't think I have ever had better.  Will definitely make again!

This was great!  I used boneless, skinless thighs and it turned out just wonderful with nothing left in the dish.  We ate every smidgen. The hardest part was cleaning the chicken.

The chicken turned out excellent! Using other people's suggestions, I used less soy sauce. Also, I used less sugar and added some honey instead. I topped off the chicken with some toasted seasame seeds. YUMMY!

Yummy teriyaki recipe.  This is the first one I have ever made, and I really liked it.  I used chicken breasts instead (2 pounds) and I think I overcooked them a little bit.  Maybe less time at 350.

Delicious recipe. I cooked it too long, but it was still delicious.  If using chicken breast you could probably go with cooking it for 30-45 minutes. I would most definitely make it again.

This Teriyaki sauce was very good!
I marinated chicken breasts overnight in a different Teriyaki mixture, cook them for 30 min. skin side down while I was making this sauce, then turned them, and brushed on every 10 min until done.  Then brushed on extra sauce before serving.  Delicious!!!

This is a great recipe. I use this as my "go to" teriyaki sauce recipe. Tastes great on any kind of meat or vegetables. Tonight it's one of my family's favorites: beef and broccoli teriyaki.

Excellent chicken  -  I did not find it too salty and it wasn't especially sticky either.  I was nervous  - but it turned out fantastic.  My husband doesn't normally eat Teriyaki and he loved it!!

This was dee-licious!  We all loved it! I used one package of drumsticks and one package of boneless breasts. I boiled the chicken before baking at 375 for an hour and it didn't turn out  that sticky like everyone said.  I think this will be one of our family favorites.  Thanks, Marian!

This is a pretty good recipe.  My wife thinks that it is great but I can't taste the difference from other teriyaki marinades
