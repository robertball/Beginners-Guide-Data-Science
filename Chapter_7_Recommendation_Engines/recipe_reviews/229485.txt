Nice twist on canned beans. I didn't have any kind of chili peppers so had to leave those out. Served with Chef John's Turkey Burgers (from this site) and the two complimented each other quite well. Will certainly make these again. Thanks, Don.

This recipe is so simple and delicious!  A great weeknight side to just about anything.  I up the spices a bit, and use minced jared jalapenos in them, oooh, there's a kick there!  Great recipe, Don.

A different twist to baked beans.  I made this as written, using the ingredients as listed, but after saut√©ing the veggies and adding other ingredients, I baked these in the toaster oven.  The flavor is very nice, but different than what I'm used to as there is no brown sugar added.  This is a recipe that I will be making again.  Thank you Don for sharing!
