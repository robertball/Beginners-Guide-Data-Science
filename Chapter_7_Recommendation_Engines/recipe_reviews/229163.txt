Season these to your own taste - such as more or less sugar, low sodium soy sauce, add garlic, ginger, honey - whatever your family & friends prefer, but the key to getting them dark is the combo of soy (and/or teriyaki) along with the black food coloring.  Have fun with it!

While these were okay. I thought the whole theme of the idea grand. I had to add several upon several drops to get the really dark black look because in the marinating...they didn't look all the black to me, dark with a greenish look to them. The sauce was very zippy. I think if my kids want these again, I'd knock down the teriyaki and soy sauce just a bit. Other then that, my kids thought there were just fine.

I ended up needing several drops of color more than called for but otherwise followed the recipe. It tasted ok, although a little unappetizing where the food coloring made the fatty parts of the skin look...well just very unappetizing. My daughter loved them but I think next time I'll try to remove the skins.

Made these last year for work and I now have had many request to make them again.  They were very easy to do and tasted very good too.
