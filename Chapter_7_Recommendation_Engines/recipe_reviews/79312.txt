I'm giving this 5 stars because it was the hit of my dessert buffet for Christmas.  However, I had to make a few mods.  Couldn't find gingerbread cake mix, so I used the spice cake as another user suggested.  I made it the day before serving which probably wasn't a great idea since the topping soaked into the cake and made it soggy.  To cover that mess up, I made another batch of the syrup-sugar-butter mixture and thickened it with cornstarch, heated it and poured it over the whole thing before serving.  It was definitely the hit of the night... Highly recommend the additional thickened topping even if yours comes out great to start with.  That put it over the top.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will probably make again, but will likely thicken the original sauce as well.  Merry Christmas!

This is a quick & delicious cake that can be personalized endlessly to suit anyone's taste. I made it as written except for replacing the water with pear juice. It made the whole house smell like Christmas & I was even inspired to take a pic which I'll post when I'm not having such a lazy day:o)
Thanks Mallinda!

Good holiday flavor.  My husband and I both agreed that it needed more pears.  Next time, I'm planning to cover the entire bottom on the pan with the pear slices.  I think that will make it look prettier too.  ;)

Well, this just throws off the ole diet!!  Delicious cake, Mallinda!!  I had to use Spice Cake instead of Gingerbread as it appeared the grocer was out of it and I took Cheepchick's suggestion of replacing some of the water for pear juice.  That topping is sinfully delicious - I could eat the whole thing in one sitting, I am sure!  Thanks Mallinda, this one was nice and easy even for a novice baker like myself!

Wow! I made this for a dinner party and was told that I had outdone myself. Really great cake for the holidays. I didn't have corn syrup so I used a little bit of honey. I also used 2 cans of pears instead of one. I decided not to use a cake mix and instead made the gingerbread cake using an old fashioned gingerbread cake recipe found elsewhere on this site. Put some minced ginger in the cake for some added zing and served with the option of whipped cream on top.

I loved this recipe!  It was SO easy and delicious.  I chopped the pecans so it didn't look as beautiful as Cheepchick's photo, but it disappeared so quickly, no one even noticed.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!  Thanks Mallinda!!!!

This recipe was super easy and delicious. The pears were an excellent compliment to the gingerbread. My kids really gobbled this cake up. As an extra bonus, the house smelled great while it was baking. Thank you, Mallinda, for sharing this recipe!

I didn't have pears, so I sliced an apple and used that. It was very good.  I would like if it had been gooier caramel top. And would use apple or pear juice instead of water next time in the cake. But very tasty!

This cake will make you look like a superstar chef; Nobody needs to know how easy it is!  I was trying to use some left over Christmas pantry ingredients and found this recipe.  I'm almost sad that only my husband and I got to enjoy it, not a huge crowd.  It was great, not too sweet but with a definite holiday flair.  I made a few changes, but nothing major.  First, I sliced the pairs to about 1/4 inch thickness and sauteed them in a skillet with some butter, adding the brown sugar and nuts so they'd be nice and crunchy.  I arranged the slices covering the bottom of the dish.  My cake was done after 35 minutes, maybe because the fruit was already hot, not sure really.  I served it with some whipped cream.  It'll definitely be an addition to my next Christmas dessert table.

This is easy to make, especially if you have silicon or easy-release baking forms.  It would be a shame if this stuck or got torn - the fruit on top is very pretty.  As another person recommended, I used honey instead of corn syrup, since I don't stock that.  Turned out great!

All I can say is YUM!!!  I made this for our Thanksgiving dessert to try something a little different.  I had trouble finding the gingerbread cake mix so I used the spice cake mix instead.  This was absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to try it with the gingerbread.  Thanks for a great recipe Mallinda!  :)

This turned out quite good.  I used a boxed spice cake mix since I had one in the pantry.  I'm betting it would be even better with a homemade spice cake or homemade gingerbread cake.  I omitted the pecans since I am mildly allergic to them.  The main complaint I have about this recipe is that it did not fit in a 9" cake pan.  I did not think it would but trusted the recipe and reviewer's comments.  I had enough cake batter for a 9" cake, 6 cupcakes, and still had a little bit of batter left over.  Maybe I used a bigger cake mix than the 14.5oz that the recipe called for; I didn't think to check since I thought they were all the same.  I believe I used Duncan Heinz.  If I make it again using that cake mix, I will probably make two 9" cakes or a 9x13" cake.

Beautiful cake.  I used canned pears and cut up one fresh pear to fill in.  Personally I thought the cake was too heavy, sweet and rich and actually may have liked it more using a spice cake mix rather than the gingerbread cake mix the recipe calls for.  I wouldnt make it again.

Yum!  It's so pretty and tastes great!  I made mine in a 9" iron skillet, like I do my pineapple upside down cakes.  It came out so pretty!

I love to make upside down cakes. This cake was a gem to discover while looking for a last minute dessert option for an impromptu dinner party. The house smells delightful, and cake is not only seasonally appropriate, but it is a unique and tasteful addition to a tradional dinner.

We loved this! I made a couple of little changes: I toasted my pecan halves in the toaster oven with a little butter spray, salt and sugar b/c I like the flavor and texture of toasted nuts the best when they are in cakes. Also, I doubled the pears and doubled the "syrup" concoction. This turned out beautifully - such a pretty cake, and not too sweet. Served with a dollop of whipped cream - it was a hit this Christmas! I'll definitely make this again.

Super quick and easy to put together. Actually my fourteen year old did it. We thought it came out really bland. I used a Betty Crocker Mix. My in-laws loved it. I thought it would have much stronger gingerbread taste. So I am blaming the it on the brand of mix I used. Update: Made again for the in-laws since they liked it so much. I used Trader Joe's gingerbread cake mix and added some crystalized ginger, about 2 tablespoons. It was much better. But I tried to substitute the oil for applesauce and it was a little rubbery. Topped with a whiskey carmel sauce.

Tastes great.  But didn't turn out pretty at all.  I'm not a fan of corn syrup so I substituted honey like a couple other reviewers.  Maybe I used too much...  I lined the pan with easy release foil because I was afraid of the sauce sticking to the pan.  It didn't help.  Most of the sauce is still stuck on the foil.  Disappointing.  Also I didn't have pears so used apples instead.  But all if the apples floated up in to the cake instead of staying in the sauce...

The Cake turned out OK. I should have used the pan specified in the directions. The cake needs to be eaten within a few days of baking.

This cake was very simple to make and was a hit! A dollop of cool whip is the perfect finish. The only thing I did differently was to use the juice from the can (*lite pears = pear JUICE, not syrup) as part of the water called for in the cake mix. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's been saved to my recipe box :o)

As other reviewers said, it was soggy, but as it cooled completely it firmed up.  I think it was very nice, we topped with whipped cream, not too sweet.  I think it could have stood a bit more zang but is a good middle of the road flavor to please the masses.  It does look very nice.

Very good cake, and it looked nice.  Wish I had used spice cake instead of gingerbread cake, and should have used more pears.  I will make this again with those changes.

This cake was delicious.  I made a couple modifications, I used spice cake instead of gingerbread, because I already had the spice mix.  For some reason I couldn't find my cake pan, so I used a 9x13 pyrex dish.  I had to double the pears because of the size and cooked the cake 10 minutes longer.  It came out perfectly.  My first upside down cake! Thank you!

Not impressed. First day, cake was dry and just ok. Second day, the topping had soaked through and cake was a little sunken and too moist: almost soggy. Good flavor that day, but wouldn't want to serve it like that.

I left it to cool a bit too long it seems, so when I turned it over the pears were ok, but the extra nuts I used as decoration stuck to the bottom of the pan in the sugar syrup.  I'm going to try finely chopping some extra pecans and scattering them over the top to help hide the look of the top of the cake.  Tastes wonderful though.

I followed the recipe exactly, but made these in a cupcake pan.  They looked like tiny little cakes, very pretty, but I was the only one who actually liked them.  Although, my family is too fond of gingerbread in the first place.  I may try this again with a different cake mix.

Nice cake! I used a spice cake mix and added ginger and molasses to it (I also used the pear juice as another reviewer suggested). I had more cake batter than my cake pan would hold - and filled it a little higher than I should have, but it worked out fine and I made a few cupcakes with the leftover batter. I took this to work today and everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe!!

BIG BUT . . .  There is no way that the cake batter  will fit in just one 9" pan!!!  I only had enough pears to make the one cake, so I used up the remaining batter for cupcakes, which made a dozen!  Having said that, the pear cake itself was yummy, and gobbled up by DH and his best friend :-)

I baked this cake in a springform pan and it came out perfectly!  I did slice the pears and roughly chopped the pecans.  Very moist and flavorful.  Next time will try with apples.

This was very easy and delicious!  The cake was light and not too sweet, even though I did use pear juice in the cake mix instead of water.  I also bought two cans (15 1/2 oz each) of pears and used about 1 1/2 of the cans.  I didn't have dark corn syrup so I used extra dark brown sugar and mixed a little molasses with light corn syrup.  After the cake was done (34 minutes in the bundt pan), I ran a table knife gently down all the edges of the pan, gradually lifting the cake away from the pan edge.  When I turned the cake onto the platter it came out perfectly.

OK, with apologies to the allrecipes purists who hate when you don't follow the recipe exactly...I used two fresh apples, peeled and sliced instead of the pear. Also had to sub "sugar in the raw" because I didn't realize I had run out of brown sugar. I used the "Gingerbread I" recipe from this site for the cake onstead of a mix...turned out great! Wish I had some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, that would have made it outrageous.
