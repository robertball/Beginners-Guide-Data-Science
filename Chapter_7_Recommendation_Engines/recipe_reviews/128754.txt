I don't really know how to rate this. The flavor was good- interesting- but good. It would have been VERY helpful to know what size casserole dish to put this in. The ones I had were all either too small or too big. I used a 9x13 and the casserole filled it a little over halfway.

Fabulous casserole! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I added mushrooms, shredded cheddar cheese, black pepper (to taste) and water chestnuts (for a nice crunch). I highly recommend adding water chestnuts to this dish for the crispy/crunchy appeal. Definitely making this again!

This is a great "backbone" recipe. I added a little shredded cheese,  fresh diced onion, green onions, some bacon, and a little leftover ham and it was delicious. Also, I used frozen green beans and fresh chopped spinach because I happened to have that on hand instead of cans.

I followed the directions to the tee. The dish was bland, the texture was not pleasant, and seemed a bit dry. Perhaps I made an error, but I won't be trying this one again.

Awesome!  I loved this with spinach.  I used only 1/2 the can of cream of mushroom soup because I don't like a real mushroom taste.  And I used french cut green beans.  It fit perfectly into a round deep dish 9 inch casserole pan.  I took this to a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!

I've made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Big Hit!  I've been told that I can no longer bring anything else.  My only addition is that I cook the green beans and spinach w/ bacon before I put it into the mix.   YUMMY!

I can seriously eat green bean casserole any time of the year. I enjoyed the addition of spinach which was great since I was going to make creamed spinach. This saved me from making an additional dish! I never make a green bean casserole without adding cheese, so I baked this with sharp cheddar tossed into the mixture and sprinkled a coating of it on top with the fried onions. You don't need to wait for a holiday to make this dish. Whenever I am craving comforting food, I look to green bean casserole!

Great recipe.  If you would like to use fresh green beans, simply steam them with a little salt and pepper (either on the stove or in the microwave) beforehand.  We also added some sauteed onion and mushrooms...and just as the author stated, this is a recipe that lends itself to being creative and adding in extra ingredients.

I started with the posted recipe and yes, I did make some changes to it. I used one can of french cut green beans and about a half package of frozen chopped spinach (it was a 32 oz. bag, so it came out to about 16 oz of chopped spinach) I just added straight from the bag still frozen. I used 1 can of mushroom soup, 1 package of dry onion soup mix ( I always add it to my green bean casserole so went with this time) rather  than a whole cup of sour cream, I used about  1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of softened cream cheese. I also added some bacon crumbles because I had some left and figured they would go well in the mix!

For the topping, I put a layer of the french fried onions then added a layer of frozen shredded hashbrowns. I baked it for 1/2 hour then put it under broiler for about 10 minutes to brown up the hashbrowns, once the hashbrowns crisped up a little, I topped with cheddar cheese and returned to broil until the cheese melted. 

My kids have been eating the requisite green bean casseroles in many forms for many years and are usually pretty unimpressed with the dish... I got thumbs up and applause for this version!

The author recommended creativity and that's what I did.  I used frozen, steam-in-bag vegetables and cooked them according to the package.  I sautéed an onion and garlic in olive oil and then tossed it with the steamed beans and spinach.  I also added some seasonings for flavor and put a little bit of cheese on the top.  Perfect!

Loved this version of green bean casserole.  The spinach makes this dish!  Will probably not go back to the original.  I added shredded swiss and some garlic pepper.  Just could not stop eating this! Thanks for sharing!

I cooked this for Thanksgiving 2013. And again for Christmas 2013 and again for my brother's bday on New Year's Eve 2013. This was such a huge hit that my family has made me promise to make it for each function. :)

What a great new twist, love this and will add to our collection. I gave four starts because in my opinion it could use more fluids of some sort.  Just a little dry.

Very good!  Nice change of pace from classic green bean casserole.  I used frozen green beans and frozen spinach (both thawed) because that is what I had.  Keeper.

The flavor was good, but the consistency was a little wonky. The cream of mushroom with the sour cream and milk congealed into a goat-cheese-like paste clumped around the green beans. In the future I will adjust and add more milk and less sour cream.

Yes, 
Everyone who ate it commented that this meal tasted much better than regular green bean casserole.  It has a lasting taste that is pleasing to the palette.

This was delicious! I used frozen spinach instead of canned, and added about a cup of freshly shredded swiss cheese and 8 slices of cooked bacon crumbled up. We served this as a side dish for Thanksgiving, but I'm sure it would make an awesome dip too!

I made this for Thanksgiving. It is is best ever! I substituted creme fraiche for the sour cream (personal taste preference). When I make it again, I will add a twist or two of pepper and maybe a dash of soy sauce. This is truly a winner. Thank you.

This is to die for! I also added some Romano cheese. Can't wait to try it out on the rest of the family at Christmas.
