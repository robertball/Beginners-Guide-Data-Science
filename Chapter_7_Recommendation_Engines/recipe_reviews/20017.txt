We went fishing for trout this afternoon and the kids came home with 5 Rainbows so decided to try this recipe.  It was easy and quick as well as delicious!  This kids loved it!  The honey was a nice touch.  We left out the spices for the kids and it still was wonderful.  Served with grilled asparagus and sweet potatoes for a healthy meal.

Overall good flavor, but too HOT!  I'll cut back on the cayenne.  I baked a huge filet at 400 for about 30 min before it was done.

I used steelhead trout (similar to salmon)... 

I substituted Cajun Seasoning for the pepper...
(tried to use sparingly since other review indicated it was too spicy)

it was good (not great).

I loved the flavor combo in this but it was a little bit too spicy for me and I like heat. This recipe also works nicely in a smoker, it just takes longer. I'm anxious to try this with other fish but I will definitely scale back the heat next time.
