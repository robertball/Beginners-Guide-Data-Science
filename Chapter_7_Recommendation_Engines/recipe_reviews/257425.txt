EXCELLENT!   I watched the video.  It made it so quick and easy to make.  The amount of sweetness was just right.  My only change was that I used vanilla bean paste.  It was the perfect finish to tonight's dinner.  Thank you Chef John for sharing another EXCELLENT recipe!  You never let us down!

Sweet, creamy goodness perfect for that sweet tooth! 

It had been awhile since I had made any dessert  and I was craving something sweet.  I didn't want to make cookies or cake or pie so I thought I'd look to see what I could find that was different than the usual.  When I signed in I saw this recipe on the main page and immediately thought, THAT'S IT!  That's what I'm gonna make!

62 years old and I have never made rice pudding before, even though I always liked it so wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.   It was fabulous and SO easy!   One pot is all you need and Chef John was right, it did NOT stick to the pot at all so no need to use that second pot that other recipes call for.  The only change I made was to use raisins instead of the cherries.  

 I will definitely be making this again!

Oh my goodness, this is the BEST rice pudding! I didn't realize how much I missed it! So good that I doubled the recipe and made the doubled recipe three times in one week (I shared, I swear). I used Arborio rice instead of long grain white, because that's what I had. I also left the cinnamon out because I like to sprinkle it and nutmeg (oh, the nutmeg!) on top. I found that turning off the heat while the pudding was still a little soupy and letting it sit for a bit made the consistency perfect, whether shortly after cooling enough to eat without burning yourself or out of the refrigerator the next day. Sooo good, and makes me feel like a kid again. :-)

Love, love, love!  I used about a cup of leftvoer white rice we had from Chinese food!  We always have plain white rice left over from Chinese take out.  This is a great, easy way to use it! And I always love Chef John's recipes and tips. Thank you!

I've made this recipe several times now, and it is the best rice pudding I've ever had. I will pretty much only use this recipe from now on. Comes out very creamy and rich. It's also super easy to make and I love that it only takes one pot. Don't be afraid of the egg trick here. As long as you stir in the egg yolk fast with the heat off, you aren't going to have scrambled egg in your pudding, trust me. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter. It was perfect. In subsequent tries, I've made it with part heavy cream instead of all milk, which gave it a little added richness. I've also used other dried fruit like raisins and cranberries. You can also vary the flavoring, like almond extract instead of vanilla, or nutmeg instead of cinnamon.

I made this and I didn't cook the rice long enough - my bad. But the flavor was incredible. I plan on making it again soon. It is a bit time consuming as you have to continuously stir which always takes some effort for me as I am constantly moving around the kitchen.

Delicious and simple.  I used golden raisins and will try the cherries next time.  There will definitely be a next time.

Delicious! 
I adjusted based on what I had on hand, which was 6C of cooked brown rice left over from Chinese food. I never expected it to be as good as it was. I cooked the rice with 6C milk, 1-1/2 C sugar, and 1 tsp salt for about 25 min. I scrambled 3 eggs (all I had) and added them quickly while whisking the rice mixture to avoid egg-drop effect, then added about 2C black raisins. I cooked a few minutes more, removed from the heat,  then added 4 tbls butter and 2 tsp vanilla. Seriously yummy! You wont get the same creamy effect as white rice, and brown has a bit or a bite to it, but I never thought it would be this good. Great recipe.

I used a mountain of leftover rice from a meal prepared for a nonprofit so multiplied the recipe x 6!  It- turned out great.  I prefer it less sweet, so will cut down a little next time.  Cooked half in  a double boiler which meant only stirred a few times- turned out as well as the pot over direct heat which was stirred frequently.  I used nutmeg & only a tiny amount of cinnamon.  Will definitely be cooking "extra" rice on purpose in the future so can have this often.

Excellent flavor! The first time that I made it, the rice wasn’t done but the water already run out. So make sure your rice is cooked. Also I soak my raisins in Marsala wine left over from tiramisu.

I have been searching for a recipe that was creamy yet didn’t separate from the rice. Although I love the custard, I didn’t want it to separate - and here it is - the perfect recipe!  I added an extra egg yolk and white raisins in place of the cherries. You can add more sugar if you like really sweet, but not me!  Thank you John for the recipe that is most like my Grandmas!   I’m 71 years old and I finally found it!

This one is going into my personal recipe book! It was easy and delicious.  I doubled the recipe with no problem.  I prefer craisins to raisins, but my husband doesn’t like either so I add them at the serving stage.  Perfect recipe!

I absolutely adore this  pudding more than you can know!! It has the perfect amount of rice and sweetness!!  I finally stopped using the recipe and I just go!!   The only thing I change is the vanilla sometimes. I love vanilla bean paste so much I could eat it with a spoon!!!  It's too bad it's so expensive! ?? 

I saw the review where someone was talking about making a double batch but it doesn't work for some reason.  It's so good just make it twice!!

Thanks Chef John for a great recipe!!  Thanks to Allrecipes , I have learned a lot from you!! ??

I love rice pudding! I made no changes. It was so delicious. I had to cook it a little longer to thicken but that is because my stove is slower cooking.

This dessert was easy and delicious ! Not too sweet or heavy !
I didn't have any dried cherries, so used raisins instead. I used Basmati rice  and that was not the right kind for rice pudding because it isn't starchy enough to make the pudding creamy.. I will be making again with the regular long gain rice.

I really liked it. I normally make baked rice pudding which I still prefer, but this is perfect in a rush. I left out the dried fruit all together as I didn’t have any on hand.

I substituted almond milk and stevia sweetener for the milk and sugar and it was just delicious. Will definitely make it again. There are so many variations you can make in the sweeteners and fruit, the possibilities are endless.

I loved this rice pudding.  I didn't believe the cooking time, (it still looked way too runny after 8 minutes) so cooked it longer which resulted in a rather stiff pudding.  I would have liked it more creamy, but that's my fault for doubting the recipe!  I'll be making this again.  The ultimate comfort food in my estimation.

I think I found my new favourite dessert! Thank you!
I had 3 cups of leftover cooked Basmati rice and I figured 1 cup would be the right amount for the recipe . . . so I TRIPLED the recipe exactly!
I was a bit surprised at how long the cook time was. I started with 15 mins, and it was still very separate rice and milk, (maybe because I was starting with cold rice, and had triple the amount of rice and milk) and so I added on additional 5-minute periods, totalling 30 mins! The addition of the eggs was easy-peasy. Instead of cherries I used sultana raisins. (I licked the spoon, the pot, and had one portion warm!) 
Will definitely be making this again, and I'm curious to try the cherries next time!

Good recipe, I was looking for a faster recipe than the rice pudding I usually make using Arborio rice, and this was the one I chose.  It is good,  and creamy, and tastes delicious.  It's still warm right now, but looks runny still, I hope it thickens up as it cools.  I doubled the recipe, and used 1 can of coconut milk in place of  400 ml regular milk, it has a subtle coconut flavour that I like.  The rest of the milk I substituted whipping cream for, to make it extra creamy and special.

I love Chef John, but I have to agree with a few of the reviews.  This has a strange taste. I couldn't put my finger on it but it was almost like graham crackers.

I made this today.  Super easy, makes 5 1/2 cup servings.  Haven't eaten much yet but cleaned off the spoon & cooking pot, was really good, creamy, used just a few raisins.  Next time might try something else.  Real test will be when my husband eats it!

Tasted great, but I must have missed something. Flavors were all there. It did not set, however. perhaps an additional yolk.

Made it to recipe, turned out well. Set fine, looks good. The taste is just meh. Not sure why but it tastes artificial. 
With a minimal list of ingredients we can't figure out why. Used unsweetened organic dried cherries. 
It is certainly edible but just not 5 stars so.

I enjoyed this very much. I'd cut back the sugar, though. It was very sweet. Maybe it was because I put raisins in. I'll make it again, in any case.

This was totally different than any other rice pudding I have ever made.  Always baked mine for hours.  This is soooo much simpler and tastes great!  I did over cook it a little and will not do so next time.  Not as creamy as I was hoping but it was my own fault.  Tastes great and added a handful of dried cranberries. Very yummy will make again!

This rice pudding is easy and delicious.  Because we only cook with organic ingredients, our pudding is more "beige" instead of creamy white because we used organic long grain brown rice and raw organic sugar.  I used raisins finely chopped.  The organic brown rice takes longer to cook but so worth the effort!

Excellent!  I watched the video first.  This is a quick and easy to make.  It is not too sweet which I like.  Rice was done and not under or over cooked.  Topped it off with fresh whipped cream and a little cinnamon sugar.  Will be making this again.

I love Chef John's recipes because they are so forgiving. I didn't have some of the ingredients so I used what I had. Royal Blend is white, brown, wild and red rice. I cooked according to its direction and doubled Chef's recipe. Used 1/2 & 1/2 and brown sugar. Eight minutes total time to cook. I strongly recommend watching the video especially for using one pot and adding egg yolk. It was easy once I saw how he did it. I wouldn't have tried it with my ingredients without watching the video. Mine looks brownish (no surprise there) and tastes fantastic. Thanks Chef John for another easy and great recipe.

This is true comfort food!  Mine took longer than 10 minutes to reach any level of doneness and to get the milk absorbed.  I prefer using a shorter grain rice and will certainly try this again with arborio or even short grain brown.

I made double the batch with exact amounts because I knew once I made it my family couldn't get enough.

I wanted to try this because the addition of dried cherries sounded good, and it was. The cinnamon and vanilla didn't overpower the cherry flavor coming through. I love rice pudding, and this is a good one.

I did a daring thing & made this for a pot luck even though I had never made rice pudding before. I had to make a lot, so I quadrupled the ingredients & followed the recipe exactly. My husband sampled it & said it was good, so we brought it to the pot luck slightly warm. It was a big hit & one lady told me it was the best rice pudding she had ever had! I cooked it for about 20 minutes because of the amount  that I had made & added raisins. Very good & easy to make.

Delicious and easy. The video was helpful—in the past I've run into a problem with the egg cooking rather than blending in. This time I handled the egg just as the video said to and got perfect results. Also, I used raisins instead of cranberries—I love raisins.

I really like this recipe, fast easy, and delicious.  It was slightly sweeter than I like maybe next time I will use 1 tbsp less sugar.  My only real complaint is it doesn't make enough.  Really doesn't very small amount.  I could easy triple this recipe. I cooked it with milk for 12 minutes instead of 10 and I think 10 would have been better.

Okay, I don't know what happened.  The only changes I made were I double the recipe (Rice Pudding is GREAT for breakfast!) and to use raisins instead on cherries.  Other than those, I followed directions to the letter.  My pudding sat overnight and still never set.  I really expected this recipe to work, and am very disappointed--not only that the recipe didn't work, but in the waste of time and ingredients.

I followed the recipe exactly, but did not cook the milk and sugar with the rice long enough, resulting in a too grainy pudding.  In consulting other recipes I noted that their time for cooking the rice at this point was twice the length of time suggested by Chef John.  I chalk this up to inexperience but also a weakness in directions.  However the taste was wonderful and I will definitely make this again with a longer cooking time in mind.

Easy and deliciòus. Next time I will add slightly less sugar but that's because I don't like things super sweet. My 16 year old son is a huge rice pudding fan and he said this was the best rice pudding he has ever had. Incidentally, I didn't add the died fruit because I don't like dried fruit.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it turned out delicious. It reminds me of when my dad use to make it when I was a kid, I will definitely be making this again.
