I didn't bother with dissolving the cocoa and the yeast, just put everything in the pan according to manufacturer's directions (for my machine, liquid, flour, then yeast on top).  My one complaint is that even though it rose nicely, it didn't expand to touch both ends of my rectangular pan.

Be sure to scrape the sides and corners of the pan, especially if you have a rectangular pan.

One of my favourite recipes to bring to a potluck -- it's so unusual, and I always get raves.  No one can believe it came out of a bread machine.  I've made it several times, and it always comes out perfectly.  Just be sure to cool the cocoa and boiling water before adding them to the machine, or the heat will kill the yeast.

I will agree with other reviewers that you can't expect a brownie or a piece of cake when you eat this.  It's less sweet, less dessert-like.  It's especially great for when you want something special and different and interesting, but not sugary.

In the words of one of my friends: "This doesn't know if it's bread or cake.  I'm eating food with an identity disorder!"  I love it for that, but apparently not everyone does.  Definitely worth a try though!

Very good!  Both my fiance and I loved it!  I don't have a bread machine, so I just made it by hand, like I normally make my bread. More or less followed the given directions of mixing the cocoa and water and the yeast and water, but instead of just throwing everything together, I added 1c of the flour to the yeast water after it sat for a bit, then added the sugar, salt, and oil.  After mixing that, I added the chocolate, mixed and added two whole eggs.  Then I started adding the rest of the flour, about 1/2 c at a time, until I hit the 3c mark.  It was still a little sticky at this point, so I added a few T more, until I could handle the dough.  Kneaded the bread as much as I could, but not as much as usual. I put it in a loaf pan and let it rise in a warm oven until it had more or less doubled, then preheated the oven to 375 and baked it for about 25 minutes, although there is a small amount in the middle of the loaf that seems like it didn't cook completely through, and the top is rather dark, so maybe 350 for 30 minutes would have been better. Definitely would try this again!

Deliciously different! I added a little more sugar to mine and it still wasn't very sweet. Tasted like a homemade loaf of bread with a hint of cocoa as an after-taste. My 8yo loved it! Next time I might try adding chocolate chips to the mix for more of a sweet chocolate taste. Thanks for the yummy post!

This is an excellent bread.  I followed the directions, except used a tablespoon of water instead of the egg yolk.  Turned out light, sweet and chocolatey.

While the basic idea of the bread was good I made some of my own changes that I think added to the overall texture and taste. 1/4C of Cocoa and water, 2 1/2tsp Yeast, 1/2C sugar, 2/3C warm water, closer to 4 cups of flour, 1tbsp vanilla,  one lunchable size chocolate pudding, 1tsp salt, 2tbsp of oil, and 1 egg. I placed in my bread machine according to directions and then put it on the DOUGH cycle. When completed I took the dough out, punched it down on a floured countertop (it was quite sticky), split it in half (makes 2 smaller loaves or one big loaf), placed in greased bread pans in a warm oven for 30 minutes. Warm oven up to 350 and cook for 25 minutes. I made this this morning and my mom and I have already eaten half a loaf because it is SO good. While it certainly does not taste like brownies, it was moist, filling, and has a delicious chocolaty after taste! It also makes the house smell amazing...  I will certainly make this bread again with the changes as it will be AMAZING with a peanutbutter banana sandwich!

Hmmm... I'm not sure I get the point of this bread. It hardly tastes chocolately and it isn't sweet so why not just make plain bread. Or real brownies. Just not what I expected.

I used freshly ground hard white whole wheat flour. I needed to add an extra 1/3 cup for proper hydration. I mixed it in my bread maker but baked it in two bread pans in the oven. The bread rose high and beautifully light. It made two one-pound loaves. I used slightly less sugar (about 1/2 cup) and left out the one egg yolk.  I froze the second loaf for later. The chocolate and sweetness are subtle. Don't expect it to taste like a brownie. My husband and I loved this special treat bread. Thanks for the recipe.

I don't use bread machines but used this as a hand made recipe. After the first rise, I rolled it out and spread it with 4 Tbsp of soft butter and then sprinkled it with sugar, (both white and brown), finely chopped walnut, and a little flour then rolled it and baked it. It made an amazing loaf of "swirl" bread. Next time I will leave out the nuts or put them in the dough.

This bread was SOOOO GOOD. The only thing I did was to make it with all whole wheat flour and both whole eggs. The bread was a nice dense bread - but light at the same time (I'm not sure if that makes sense). It was versatile - I was expecting the chocolate to make it a bread only good for butter or jam... But my kids were dipping it in carrot and ginger soup... The chocolate is a nice balance - it's not overpowering - if you eat it alone the chocolate comes out nicely - but it's not so much (like I said) that you can't enjoy it with a cup of soup or for a sandwich. I really really liked this bread - my kids loved it too!!! It was gone in hours... I'm making it again - but lots of loaves that I'll freeze so we'll have it.  But keep in mind like other reviewers mentioned. This is bread - it's not a brownie - it's not ooey gooey sticky sweet... It's a nice bread. If you want a dessert, make the brownies... If you want a nice bread - this will do perfectly!!

The idea of chocolate flavored bread is somewhat weird, but toasted with a smear of peanut butter makes this bread interesting. I had hoped it would be sweeter...

I didn't make this in a bread machine, but it rose nicely in a 9 x 5 pan. I added about 1/8 c. extra sugar and 2 T. gluten. I didn't think that it was sweet enough or really very chocolately, but I think if I want that sort of thing, I should make a quick bread. My husband loved this bread though. He said it was great toasted with peanut butter or honey. To each his/her own...

We didn't do any of the extra prep work (just layered wet ingredients and then dry, per our bread machine instructions) and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. We did an XL loaf with medium crust on our machine and the outside came out kind of hard and maybe burnt (it's hard to tell on a dark bread!) but it came out of the pan easily and the kids liked the inside.

Made it using a 2lb cycle.  It was more of a chocolate bread--didn't make me think of brownies, but it was still good.  I made a vanilla dipping sauce for it and my friends ate it all.

Not too sweet,  a bit dry, but you can taste the chocolate flavor and I did enjoy it.  I think the name suits this bread well.  I did use all purpose flour and it worked fine, but mine overcooked slightly so I will try the rapid setting next time as opposed to the regular bread setting. Additionally, since the bread was a tad on the dry side, I think a mashed banana or some applesauce  would be a great addition for moisture  to bump this recipe up to a 5 star rating.

Really enjoyed this as a breakfast bread. I followed the ingredients/amounts as stated in the recipe, but I combined them according to my bread machine's instructions (liquids first, the dry ingredients then yeast on top). I used the white bread setting.

Good bread.  As my husband noted, the texture is like a brownie, so that is likely where the name comes from.  Does it taste like a brownie?  Well, no, it's definitely bread with a bit of a chocolate taste, so if you are looking for a sweeter bread, you are going to have to make some changes or find another recipe.  It is more like a brown bread, similar to a pumpernickel.  thanks for the recipe!

Love this bread with a good cup of coffee. This bread is great with a little Nutella spread for a satisfying chocolate fix.

The bread was fantastic.  It was just a little sweet, but it was excellent with butter or served with a meal.  A very flavorful, hearty bread.  It's one of my new favorites!

The bread came out quite chocolatey for us, and would have been very good except it had an almost bitter aftertaste.  Personally, I think its from the large amount of cocoa powder, but it may be that mine was old.  Either way, this isn't a recipe that will be entering my beloved collection.
