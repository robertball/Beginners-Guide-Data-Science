EDIT: Revising my review after making this using a food processor. This is a fantastic dessert with a huge "wow" factor. You could probably substitute yogurt or vanilla pudding in place of the whipped cream for variety. This time around I also didn't put in any of the reserved liquid and found the texture to be a little less thin.

Thought that I could combine the canned sweet potatoes and canned pumpkin using a hand mixer - big mistake. Couldn't get it perfectly smooth and was stuck with tiny sweet potato chunks. Use a food processor.
