A great tasting and refreshing salad. Unless you like alot of onions, I recommend using a red onion and eliminating the yellow onion. I also left out the anchovies since we don't care for these and used iceberg lettuce in place of romaine.

Very nice! I didn't add the onion or the egg to this. I added croutons. I think it is easily customizable to your tastes...the dressing really makes this salad, the other ingredients can easily be interchangeable.

I just went out to a restaurant and they served a tomatoe salad. I liked it so much I wanted to duplicate it. I found this recipe and tried it and it comes very close. I really liked this.

This is a delicious recipe! The local Grainger County tomatoes are in and they are so delicious! I used iceberg lettuce and vidalia onions instead of yellow. Omitted the anchovies. Thanks for a refreshing post!

Great taste, we added a little Dijon Mustard -- gave it a little tang, and also used Iceburg Lettuce...The basis for this is terrific
