I almost Never rate a recipe I have altered in any way...especially a negative review.  One of my peeves on this site.  I did add fresh sliced mushrooms because I had 4 large that needed to be used up.  This rice came out so flluffy and delish with a subtitle flavor of the mushrooms . Added to my favorites for sure!!  Thanks for an awesome, simple brown rice recipe:)

I was torn between this recipe and another one so I kinda combined the 2. I boiled 2 cups of water and a can of beef broth for flavor. Sprinkled the rice with some onion salt & tossed on some mushrooms. Then I poured the boiling water/broth over the rice like the recipe instructed. Cooked for 80 min. covered with foil and it was amazing!!!

I made this last night, and at first I'd thought had a recipe fail, because after an hour at 400 degrees, all the liquid had absorbed and I had a dish full of crunchy rice! Not wanting to give up on it just yet, another cup or so of water was added and I continued to let it bake (adding more water after about 1/2 hour) until it was fluffy. It was slightly "al dente", but that might have been because it was brown rice. I did check the rice package afterward, and those directions called for 2 1/2 c. water to 1 c. rice, so I believe that was the source of the problem. I liked this method, so I'll make it again - just with more liquid at the onset next time.

I needed a large quantity of brown rice for a few "make ahead and freeze" dishes, and thought I'd try this method.  I followed the recipe exactly, and when I pulled the foil back an hour later discovered perfect brown rice - light and fluffy, all the water absorbed, and ready to use.  I thought it was much better than stovetop, and even beat my rice cooker.  And it doesn't get any simpler than this.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy peasy!  For the record, 2014 Mareellen rated this recipe 2 stars after having admitted she'd never made the recipe.  I don't get it.  Why was that review posted.  That is completely  unfair to the recipe poster.

I have used this and similar methods of oven-cooking rice (both brown and white) for many years, and for many large dinners for Lodge functions, feeding up to 100 people, with up to three full sized steam table pans of rice, and have had unqualified success each and every time. Enjoy!

Good cooking method, but I will add 3 3/4 cups water next time and check it in 60 min. May take 80 min. or so though. Mine needed more water and cooking time, but the final dish was fluffy and very good. Adding the boiling water/broth is key as well.

I eat brown rice a lot and have traditionally used a rice steamer to do this.  My rice steamer is not a very expensive one so the bottom of the rice tends to burn.  I hate using pots simply because you constantly have to watch it.  This is a perfect solution.  I basically just cook rice for the week to use in different dishes but I do think I am going to try cooking it with different veggies and/or broth as others have suggested.  And the quantities and time listed worked perfectly.

I'm a terrible rice cook but this is super easy! I left out the butter but added just a tad more water.  I accidentally forgot the salt, but it wasn't a huge deal.  I'm bad at making rice but this is kinda foolproof - thanks!

I wanted an Asian themed rice so is substituted some sesame oil for part of the butter, added some dried minced onions, ground ginger, and garlic powder and is was delish! Very easy way to make brown rice and easy to flavor to your taste.

I haven't tried the recipe this way. But I have a rice cooker and I already put butter in the rice so I wouldn't have to it this way.But if a large quantity is needed,I might.

I never have the patience for stovetop rice. I found this recipe and was intrigued. Thought I would just give it one shot. Well, the rice turned out really great! It was slightly al dente but that all depends on how much water, time, and what particular brand of brown rice you use. It was still fluffy, made plenty, and my fiancee was stoked to have good, yummy rice with his meal. The only downside for me was that some areas of my pan the rice stuck on, so I had to soak the dish overnight to get it off. (I used a ceramic glazed pan & lid, kind of like the LeCreuset dishes). Will keep using this recipe until I perfect the art of cooking rice in the oven! Thanks!

I love this process of cooking brown rice. It turns out perfect every time, and I can cook a larger bach to store in the freezer in quiet size freezer bags. So easy to do out side on the BQ set to low or med. for about 1 hr.

I always make brown rice in the oven. I use Alton Browns recipe however, think the only difference is the temp. he covers with foil,doesn't add butter and cooks at 375. I usually do end up cooking it longer and take the foil off at the end. It is super easy and always turns out

The rice turned out excellent.  Based on other user reviews, I did use 2 cups water and 1 can beef broth, added about 1/4 teaspoon onion salt, and chopped up a 4 ounce can of mushroom stems & pieces.  Cooked the rice for 80 minutes and let it sit covered for 15 minutes before serving.  Both my husband and I loved it!!  Thanks for posting!!

Better than my electric rice cooker.  Did a two to one ration of chicken broth to rice...perfect.
Added chopped mushrooms, garlic and onion powder along with chopped parsley...perfect flavor.
Timing is not an exact science.  Check at 1 hour and maybe longer if needed.  
Freezes beautifully.

I can cook white rice with my eyes closed, but have tried about three times unsuccessfully to cook brown rice in the last week or so. On the stove top - Too crunchy and undercooked, I could probably get this right but feel like it's too much of a hassle to watch rice boil for 40+ minutes. In the pressure cooker - Turned to gooey gluey mush. Rice cooker - Almost successful but stuck to the bottom and was inconsistent in texture. 

After reading all the reviews I had hope for this method of cooking so decided to give it a go. I used my Breville Smart Oven and used the bake setting, rack on the bottom, set to 200?. I cooked the rice in a Wiltshire porcelain enamel baking dish and covered with foil. I stuck pretty close to the recipe, using roughly 1 1/4 cup of rice, a pinch of salt, 2 teaspoons of butter and 3 cups of boiled water. My only deviation was adding a small splash of roast garlic infused olive oil. It smelled great even before putting it in the oven. I wrapped the foil very tight when covering it and set the oven for an hour. 

I was excited to check the rice when it was done and wasn't too careful with removing the foil - A LOT of steam came out. I fluffed it with a fork and am not going to lie, was pretty ecstatic that out came perfectly cooked brown rice. It smelled amazing and aromatic with the garlic olive oil, the flavour was subtle but great. I'll be using this method from now on, it's simple and easy, with many possibilities for flavours!

LOVED this rice or method of making brown rice. I usually make it in a rice cooker and it is so chewy. I lined my oval ceramic dish with foil, sprayed it with PAM, and added the ingredients with rice first. I microwaved the water right in my measuring cup in the microwave. I put the baking dish on a sheet pan and stirred the ingredients quickly. I covered with another sheet of foil not having a lid. After about an hour and 5~10 additional minutes I removed and the rice was nice and fluffy. This is my go to method now, easy clean-up and no stirring or watching. ty

Good alternative when you have an hour (instead of 50 minutes on the stove) to make brown rice.  I always add chicken, beef, or vegetable broth/stock when making brown rice.  It improves the "cardboard" flavor (IMO) of brown rice.

I will always make rice like this! I could never do it right on the stove. It turned out perfect and was good with roast and gravy. My family enjoyed it. The only thing i did different was added 2 cups rice and i had enough for the four of us and for lunch for work tomorrow. Very good!!

Ok, so you know how you are eating out somewhere and the brown rice is perfection in a bowl? You wonder, "sheesh, I wish I could make this at home....". Well, I'm gonna do you a massive favor by telling you to look no further. Do  N O T  waste your time trying other Brown Rice recipes —seriously. This has the bite, flavor, and texture you want. The trifecta of a perfect brown rice. Except wait.... it is also SO STINKING EASY!  So just do it. Make this rice once —WITHOUT changing the recipe. You will never need to worry about whether your rice will turn out yummy again, and all your guests will think you are a wizard.

Turned out perfect, even as a triple batch in a very full 9x13 casserole dish.

This was so much easier than standing over the stove. Came out great used chicken stock instead of water and added crushed garlic and diced onion was perfect.

This is completely foolproof. I have followed this recipe to a T, and mixed it up a bit for a change of flavour. Each time it has been perfect. My favourite variation is to sautee some onions in the butter, then to add some chopped mushrooms and a clove of crushed garlic, and to replace some of the liquid with pureed canned tomatoes. Another tasty variation is to add a soup cube and some broccoli florets. Anything works as long as the method and rice/liquid ratio is kept the same.  Thanks to the submitter. I now enjoy brown rice.

Like another reviewer, I added a bit more water about halfway through cooking time  - about 1/4 cup; it was simple and turned out fluffy.

Failproof! I never cook rice any other way any more! I have often  scaled it down by 1/2 for just 2 of us w/out any problem. Have used chicken stock in place of rice if I had it. My pan had no lid so I double foiled it while cooking. Honestly, you can't mess this recipe up!! Rice is fluffy & perfect.

This rice is fantastic.  It comes out the same way every time, and it's fluffy and perfectly cooked.  If you like, you can achieve a bit of a crusty edge if you leave in the oven for a little longer (10 minutes or so).  

I omit the salt and add a teaspoon of Better Than Bullion Chicken.

It's a great recipe because you don't have that rice taking up a burner and you don't have to worry about the rice sticking or burning.

I never cared for brown rice until I found this recipe!  I do use 3 cups of chicken broth instead of water, but it is great both ways.  Could not be any easier or more delicious!

This was a great recipe. I did use chicken stock for half of the water (which I would do any time I made rice). My casserole dish looked burnt when I pulled it out of the oven, but the rice came out perfectly and the dish cleaned rather easily (shew!). I even have a rice cooker and this works way better. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is the only way I make brown rice now.  I used to cook it stovetop, just like white rice, but it always came out gummy.  I was about to give up when I tried this method and it comes out perfect every time!

This is my go to recipe for brown rice.  We love it.  It turns out perfect every time.  I use chicken or beef broth sometimes.  I have also replaced butter with olive oil. Keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I now use this recipe ALL of the time and it never fails. Just remember to cover it with foil.

I also like doing large batch and putting the leftovers in the freezer.

This rice dish was absolutely yummy. I usually make recipes exactly as stated but used chicken broth instead. As another viewer, I had to bake it for 80 minutes before all the liquid was gone.  This recipes is a keeper. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I've been using this recipe for years.  I usually double it and freeze some of it for later.  

It has always required more liquid about halfway through the cooking time, but no big deal.  Brown rice can be tricky that way.

For flavor sake, I do saute a diced onion and add that in.  I also use half chicken broth, half water.....and I use kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  If I have fresh thyme, I'll also add the leaves from about 6 stems to the rice.   None of it necessary to the recipe, just do it this because we like it.  This freezes up well and I use it as the base of many yummy dishes!

This recipe is wonderful!  The best brown rice I have ever eaten.  I changed half the water for chicken broth and added some green onion and my husband said he had never eaten brown rice that was so light and flavorful.  He asked for the recipe to put with his own.  Thank you for sharing this.

I followed the recipe's measurements and oven temperature exactly.  All the liquid was absorbed, and the rice was quite fluffy.  My diet presently calls for different grains.  I plan to divide this into several portions, adding raisins and brown sugar and serving it at breakfast time.

Like most reviewers, I've been less than thrilled with results for brown rice cooking on the stove top or rice cookers.  I chose to use 2 cups of organic long grain brown rice.  I checked the package to see if the liquid requirements were any different than the recipe-they weren't.  I chose to use olive oil and lightly sautéed a package of white button mushrooms, sliced and a very large shallot, chopped (about 1/2 cup) in the olive oil.  I wasn't planning on adding the whole thing but changed my mind and added it all to the rice.  I was out of fresh garlic so I added some granulated garlic to the salt and added that to the rice.  I mixed 1 tablespoon of my homemade chicken boullion powder to the boiling water.  This was all placed in a 2qt covered casserole and I was worried because it was about 5 inches high and anytime I've seen rice baked it was in a 2 inch high dish. Cooked for 60 minutes at 400 degrees and then turned off the oven and left it in there for another 20 minutes so the chicken next to it would finish cooking.  It turned out amazing!  The mushrooms covered the rice and gave added moisture and flavor so no dried rice on the top edges. Perfectly cooked, great flavor...not like any brown rice I've ever had, and SO easy.  So now I have it in a decorative casserole that can go right to table...could it be any better than that?  Bravo!

Tank you! I will never make brown rice on the stove aagain! I used olive oil instead of butter and used a little more water as per a few reviews. I  am not sure about cooking time since I checked on it a few time.

Whenever I have tried to make brown rice in the past, it hasn't come out well.  I thought I would try again since my son's doctor said he needed more fiber in his diet.  I tried this method, adding a tiny bit of red pepper flakes, garlic powder and celery salt and it came out perfect.  The texture was perfect.  I like my rice plain, but everyone else had some in their chili and didn't even know it was brown rice until I told them.  Thanks mom2threelittleones.

Adjusted recipe to make 5 servings. Baked for 50 minutes. Rice came out perfectly cooked, fluffy, with a light nutty taste. Will be eating more brown rice as a healthier alternative to white. Family loved this!

I'm a late comer to using brown rice and haven't been able to convince my 15 year old son with the various recipes I've tried--until this one! We all enjoyed it so much that I won't even be bothered by the one hour cooking time; it is well worth it!

I have made another brown rice recipe for years, but this one is GREAT for a quick version!!!  I did as another person, I used water and beef broth, added some mushrooms and used onion powder for flavor.  Everything else, I did as recipe said.  I actually used quick rice because that's what I had.  LOVE THIS

I love this recipe! It is my go to recipe anytime I need rice for a meal. It turns out fluffy and perfect every time. Never sticky. Often I scale down the portion and just reduce the cook time when I do. Still turns out great.

This recipe makes perfect brown rice. I usually use chicken broth instead of water and sometimes add fresh mushrooms if I have them on hand.

This was not foolproof, for me, as it required more water and cooking time than stated.  However, it is definitely worth trying again with some modifications.

I made this dish exactly as the recipe directed. The rice turned out perfect! I immediately thought of some different ways to change certain things for my personal tastes and can't wait to make it again. But that will have to wait until I finish off this batch. 3 cups of brown rice is basically a 3 pound bag of dried rice. I have been taking it for lunch everyday, which will make my doctor happy!

Tonight for the first time. The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of water. It was terrific! I filled out the rest of the meal by making  savory creamed mushrooms with basil, fresh parsley, chopped onion and a couple of TBSPs of chardonnay (would have preferred sherry but didn't have it), thickened with a small amount of flour and milk. Served the mushrooms over the brown rice for a lovely vegetarian entree. Great! I am sure I'll make this again with many variations. Judi David

It worked really well - I did put foil over it and then the lid so it was really tight - it came out perfect and fluffy ! I must say I wished I had gravy to serve with it - anyway I’m going to make a salad with the left overs.

I grew up eating this dish and it takes me home every time. I did make some substitutions based on flavor preferences but this is a great recipe. First, I sub beef broth for plain water. Bullion cubes work great. Next I always add mushrooms since I’ve always got extra in the pantry or fridge. Last, I add a dash or so of soy sauce and Worcestershire. By far my most used recipe and easiest way to make brown rice!

I usually get the best white rice by baking it. So I looked for a recipe for recipe for brown rice...and found this. I am ecstatic. It worked from the first time to now. I have now made it about 6 times, and I don't usually eat rice. Not anymore, I crave this rice, and will be making it much more often. 
I have added different seasonings at different times, from garlic pieces, to veggie broth to yeast flakes, to cumin, to red pepper flakes, to ...the list is endless. Btw, I've always only used coconut oil instead of what the recipe called for.
Want to add veggies like carrots etc, next.

Very disappointed. Did exactly as directed, but part way through baking I checked on the rice. It was dried out & hard. I added more water & let bake awhile longer. The package the brown rice came in said to have 3 parts water to 1 part rice & that would've work much better than 2 water to 1 rice. Next time I'll  just use the recipe on the package the brown rice came in.

To me, the oven outranks the stovetop in so many ways. I recently started cooking brown rice in the stove using a cast iron, enamel braising pot. I doubled the recipe. Used saltless organic chicken broth (and one cup of coconut water). The liquid to rice ratio remained 50/50. 

I also roasted the brown rice in a pan for 10 minutes on the stovetop, with the butter, medium high heat. I love the nutty buttery aroma. I baked the rice for 45 minutes. Perfectly al dente. Bit some liquid remained on the bottom of the braising pot. So I removed the lid from the pot and stuck it back in the oven for 5 more minutes.

Done. 

I forked it out of the pot and all fluffy into a big bowl, though it hardly needed to be fluffed. Perfectly cooked brown rice and the flavor would turn a brown rice hater into a lover. 

I would suggest checking the rice early just to make sure it never overcooks. Mushy brown rice is a true sin.

This is a terrible waste of energy, making rice this way.  The simplest fool proof method is to put more water than the instructions call for, say about 1/2 cup more, then on high heat, boil the water.  When the water is boiling pour the rice and salt in the boiling  water, stir,  reduce the heat  and start a timer according to the package directions.  Taste for doneness. Problem solved, no wasted energy.  Perfect results every time.

I followed the recipe and the rice still came out hard. I'm now convinced that I need to get a rice cooker. I have tried numerous methods and they all result in hard rice.

I want to eat this every night! Seriously delicious and everything I hoped for. I added a bit of chicken broth and adjusted the liquid ratio to match the instructions on my bag of rice (2 + 1/4 cups of water/broth per cup of rice) them covered my pan with foil (as suggested by another reviewer) as I don't have a lidded casserole dish. Tasted like one of those microwavable flavoured rice packets but, obviously, far better. Thanks for the recipe!

This was an easy way to make rice....it turned out perfect in 1 hour.  I made it exactly as written, but  only used 1 T. butter.  Even my husband that doesn't like brown rice liked this.

I'm not a fan of brown rice and never found one I liked. After reading the reviews I adjusted the amount of liquid. I added 2 3/4 cup water and 1 cup beef broth. It took exactly 60 min to cook and was so fluffy. I'm embarrassed to admit how much I ate with my dinner and for lunch the next day. This made enough for several meals and tasted just as good reheated as it did the day I made it. Definitely a keeper and made me a HUGE LOVER of brown rice!!

This was great!  I'm glad I found this recipe, as it's perfect for a busy day.  I only made 1/2 the recipe, as there are only two of us, and cooked it for only 45 minutes due to the smaller amount, but there was enough for 4 people, so I used leftover rice in a southwestern salad I made for tonight.  Next time I'll make the entire recipe and freeze the rest, as one of the other reviewers suggested!  If you're not familiar with the texture of brown rice, note that it is chewier than white rice, so if you have chewy rice, you're doing it right!

Absolutely fantastic and easy to make. I only used 1 mug full of rice and a mug and a half of water. Bit of salt and around 25 grand of butter. Put it in the oven and walked away for 35 minutes. Came back to the first portion of brown rice I've ever actually enjoyed. I enjoyed it so much I signed up just to leave this review! Thank you so much for this recipe. I'll never do rice another way.

Follow the water amount on your selected rice package, comes out just moist enough,  to dry or mushy.

Wonderful!  Rice was really fluffy and light.  No way I could get such great results from the stovetop!  I added 1/4 cup more water because my oven runs hot, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks!

I've been making brown rice this way for years.  So easy and comes out perfect every time.  I use chicken broth instead of water, gives it a nice flavor and no need to add butter or salt since the broth has salt.  Bake about 1 hour at 400.  Best oven ware for this and many recipes are the Le Creuset dutch ovens.

The taste was great although it did come out a little bit hard.  **NOTE** I used chicken broth instead of water, teaspoon of garlic power, dash of cumin, and pinch of oregano.  If you try my recommendation, be careful with the amount of salt you add.

Just what I was looking for ... making several freezer meals for a friend and they all called to "serve over rice". With other reviewers mentioning that their rice wasn't done at the 60 minute mark I looked at the ratio of rice/water on my package of rice. Using a 2 water to 1 rice measurement this came out perfect. I will make it next time with half the salt and no butter just to cut sodium and fat but this is perfect as is.

I am a terrible rice cook. This came out great! I also tried it with jasmine rice. Came out great again!

I was so frantic about trying this recipe because I tried making brown rice with my slow cooker and it was a disaster!! It came out so mushy. I didn't want to give up and looked on this site to try another way and i must say... I loved the way it came out!! Only thing is I forgot to cover it so some of it came out a lil hard but not dramatically!! I boiled the water first with chicken bouillon for flavor, used a butter spray for my casserole dish and put the rice in the dish and but the water on top of the rice and let it cook for 55-60 mins!! If you never made brown rice, I highly suggest using this easy method!!

Come out great! Very simple. I seem to mess it up every time on stove top. After reading the reviews i decided to add just a tad more water and it come out sode and fluffy.
