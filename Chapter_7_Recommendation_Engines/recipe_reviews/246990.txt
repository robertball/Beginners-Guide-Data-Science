This is excellent. I had a bit of trouble finding the mace pieces and cilantro roots. Even my local Indian grocery store was out of both. I just used fresh coriander with the stems and all and one and a half tablespoons ground mace. I started grinding this by hand but finished it off in my mini processor because it was too much for my mortar. It makes a lot of paste. Grind the recipe in two or three batches unless you have a big mortar.
