Very moist and simple! As an amateur cook, I like this very much. It is not greasy and it goes very well with my homemade chutney. I actually covered my pork chops with garlic powder, but it was not overbearing.

Yummy!! And all my picky eaters gobbled it up!  I did not change the recipe however to avoid another dirty dish I put the 2T of butter in the baking dish and let it melt in the preheating oven while I prepped the egg wash, grabbed the seasonings and opened the pork chops.  It was an incredibly easy recipe and easy clean up. I served with scalloped potatoes and green beans. Thank you for sharing!

I had high hopes for this recipe considering the positive reviews BUT it didn't go over well with the in laws or my hubby or daughter (or me). The pork chops ended up dry and very bland. I won't be making this again. sorry but I normally don't give bad reviews:(

The baking temperature and time were spot-on for my chops; they turned out deliciously moist and temped at about 155 degrees when I took them out of the oven. They didn't look very appetizing, though; the color wasn't very good, and the egg cooked on the chops in little flaky bits, which was a bit strange. All in all, however, this was pretty good. Thanks.

I have found with almost every pork dish you need a digital measuring device.  Pork, more than any other meat, needs to be right at the number or it will be dry and tasteless.  I set my digital for 143 degrees for chops and when the buzzer goes off I pull them out and cover for 3-4 min.  The temp will rise to 145 degrees.  You can get a Maverick digital at Lowes or Home Depot for about 26.00 and it will pay for itself in no time.  All ovens cook differently and if you just go by the time recommended in recipes it will be hit or miss.

I have made this three times in the last three weeks. My whole family loves it. I don't change a thing. They come out juicy and delicious every time and I am a terrible cook!

as a new wife and cook, i have found it rather difficult to find recipes that are easy and taste good. my husband HATES pork chops with a passion. but with this recipe, he loves them. its easy and tastes great. very moist! i did not use butterflied chops so mine were a little thicker than they should have been. just add a 5 more minutes to cook them through!

I threw 1/2 of a sliced white onion and 3 small cloves of fresh garlic in with it, as well as a tsp of organic virgin coconut oil.. Oh, and some black pepper just before serving. It was fabulous. This is a great basic recipe that can be taken in many directions..

My husband and I both loved this. Can't be beat for simplicity and deliciousness combined. I didn't change anything, and won't when I make it again, and that's unusual for me not to tweak a recipe at least a little!

Tried this tonight for dinner. Quick and easy! It was so tender and flavorful, everybody loved it and wants it again. I can see this is going to become a regularly prepared meal in our house. I did coat the chops in bread crumbs before putting in the baking pan. Then, about 5 minutes before it was done, I added some hot cooked instant white rice to the baking pan, some under and some over the chops. Sprinkled some garlic salt and a few pats of butter on top and baked another 5 minutes (don't do longer or it will dry out the rice). Served with peas. It was delicious! I do prefer more wholesome basmati brown rice, but it does require a longer cook time so next time I will start sooner. But this was a great meal to whip up at the last minute.

Quite tasty. I think my oven cooks a little fast or something. I cooked my chop on the bottom rack for 10 min and on the top for 2. Came out perfect. Cooking it 20 min would have overcooked it. I also added pepper. How do you cook a nice cut of meat and not put pepper on it?

I did what another reviewer said and let the butter melt in the pan in the oven while it was preheating. Did recipe exactly as is. Very simple, fast, and tasty. Will definitely make this on nights I need a quick meal.

I just made these with Garlic mashed potatoes and Mac&cheese. I've never cooked Pork chops before (let alone really ever cooked) and they came out tasty and juicy! Glad I found this!

They don't look very appetizing and the taste is blah.  Cooked one chop to the recipe and it was nothing special. I saved the  other three chops by adding a schmear of dijon honey mustard and a quick grill under the broiler for color.

Simple but tasty. I wouldn't serve it for a fancy dinner among friends, but it is a great weekday family meal staple. I used thin sliced boneless chops and followed the recipe. I just used the pinch of garlic seasoning and pinch of seasoning salt on each side of the chop. Flipped midway and used more pinches. Served with roasted potatoes and veggies. I will definitely be making this again!

Great taste but be careful if you make your own seasoning salt for this. I made my own and because I like a lot of seasoning, I applied it liberally....Way too
salty ! Very easy recipe and quick cleanup if you line the baking dish with foil. Thanks!

Only rating a 4 because I love a bone with my chops.  My chops where thick so I baked 20 minutes on each side & they turned out very moist.  The people who said it was tasteless must not have put enough seasoning on them, I used A LOT.  Think I'll make these again but with bone-in & also use a little real garlic like another reviewer did.  Thanks for sharing.

as a new cook I have been looking for quick and easy meals to make that aren't that expensive on top of that. this recipe is very easy to do and doesn't take long at all. the only problem I have run across is that the egg mixture doesn't stick to the chops very easily so I end up having a cooked egg on the bottom of my pan. other than that I love this recipe and so does my boyfriend and his son.

Turned out great!  I used garlic powder vs. garlic salt, and added dried rosemary and fresh ground black pepper.  Yummy!!!

Simple and delicious. I didn't butterfly the pork chops, so I cooked them longer, but still so moist and tender.

I had very thick pork chops and felt they were a tad over cooked so I would shorten the time just a bit. Otherwise they were very good!

I loved this recipe.  The only thing that I changed was that I seared the chops both sides with butter in a frying pan and then cooked them in the oven in the same pan.  Half the time on each side.. 12 minutes one one side then 12 minutes on the other side  Turned out delicious!  Oh, and I used center cut 
 bone in chops, the fat in them gives them some extra flavor...

This was super bland and the egg-milk mixture made for a weird frothy coating. I would just stick with the butter and triple the seasonings. Or pan fry it first to seal in the juices.

This turned out great. My only alteration was to use adobo since I didn't have seasoning salt. Fantastic! Te def and moist.

I just about passed this by.  I'm SO glad I didn't!   It is so simple & easy to make with wonderful flavor.  I call it deceptively delicious!   I buy a whole pork loin (usually at Sam's Club or Costco) then cut it up into boneless chops (MUCH cheaper than buying packaged chops).   I did not change anything about the recipe & made as is.  Made garlic pasta & cooked carrots to go with it.  Very good!   This will go into my "keepers" file!  Thanks for the recipe, Michele!

Changed the garlic powder to fresh minced garlic. Besides the fact that it turned out a little dry it was really good. Will definitely make it again with minor experimental changes to make it juicer

Great starter for those who don't know what to do with a pork chop, like myself! I can see where this wouldn't be very flavorful. I added coriander, oregano, more salt, and more garlic powder. A pinch just wouldn't do it! Again, great place to start as far as how-to goes, but I recommend more seasonings.

The egg wash turned into scrambled eggs in the pan.  Next time  will just sprinkle chops with seasoning  and bake.  Thin chops, 10 min at 370, turned for another 5 min.  Tender.

I made this according to the recipe in a Convection Oven (it's new and I'm still working to understand it).  I had to bake this about 5 minutes longer to reach the correct temperature.  Also, in a couple of small areas, I soaked the pork chop too much with the egg/milk mixture and it looked like scrambled eggs.  With experience, that could have been avoided.  I also fixed this in a glass baking dish with a cover.  I noticed some of the comments about it being dry and thought this would help.  In all, it was very juicy and tender.

Super easy and fast and definitely edible when you're done. A perfect week day meal.  Try playing with the spices for variety. Our oven runs a little cool so we left them 15 minutes per side and they were great.  Know your oven people.  If they come out dry, your oven is likely running hot.  Keep an eye on it if you're not sure.  Thanks for posting a REAL recipe for real busy people.

As I avoid salt - I substituted Mrs. Dash instead of the Lawry's seasoning salt. Absolutely super easy with little fuss. Chops stayed nice and moist. 5 minutes to put together (while oven is warming up anyway) then 20 minutes in the oven!

This was very tasty but dry. Next time I won't butterfly them and I may brown them before baking so they look better lol.  For the people who said there wasn't any taste, just put more seasoning on them and garlic powder.  I doused my chops with garlic powder and garlic salt!!

Delicious! Very moist and tender. Used a 1/2" chop and didn't cook as long. Puzzled by the purpose of the egg wash...in that it didn't stick and ended up with a little scrambled egg in the pan. ??? Will make again!

Very good. The flavor was just perfect for my family and they weren't greasy or dry. For thinner pork chops you'd maybe need to adjust the cooking time, but we really enjoyed this dish.

Delicious! Super easy and quick! 
I cheated and used boxed scalloped potatoes and had some vegetables on the side, but it would be great with fresh mashed potatoes even! I used two boneless butterfly pork chops.  If I had made 4 chops, I maybe would've used more butter!

Loved it.! Yummy.
Next time I might pan sear it first before I put it in the oven, give it some color.

We did not care for this recipe at all. Make this if you like the taste of nothing and the texture of boiled meat. Would make again if for someone I didn't like.

Okay I hit done too soon the first time i wrote this!  This was really good and quick and easy for a weeknight. Do NOT over cook the pork chops. I used one of Penzey’s Spices blends - 33rd and Galena Chicken and Pork rub and granulated garlic. I also basted them when I flipped them. Served with garlic rice and a chopped salad. Use a digital thermometer so you can monitor them closely.

I totally missed the milk and egg as my son seasoned the chops when I wasn’t watching  and before I had prepared the liquids so I just baked them in the buttered pan  and they were delicious.  Moist and juicy.  I will make them again for sure and try to follow the recipe  : ) next time

I would make this again, but would add more garlic powder to it.  It was a little bland.  Plus, I think my chops were thinner than what the recipe was made for, so mine were a little over cooked and dry.  Still good, so I'll try it again with thicker chops and add a bit more seasoning.

I read the good and not so good reviews and decided to add regular salt and pepper to the recipe to ensure flavor. My son who is my food critic, thought the pork chops tasted good. I thought so as well. They were not very moist, however. I'm definitely into simplicity when cooking so this was a good recipe to follow.

This is fast and easy.  Very juicy chops.  Mine were ready in  17 minutes.  The only change I made is brining them for 2 hours before cooking.  Not really necessary, but I always brine my pork.  Oh, and I added black pepper.  Great recipe as is.

Good recipe. Not too strong garlic flavor which I liked. Still splattered quite a bit in toaster oven so keep an eye on it. Good pantry meal.

I followed directions to the letter. Needed much more time to cook, and finally browned them in a frying pan- saving them.  I will not use this recipe in the future. Can't beat frying in my opinion.

Simple recipe and it sounded tasty. However, I think there may be an ingredient or two missing.  The egg mixture just ran off the chops into the sides of the baking dish and cooked there.  Just ordinary baked chops with seasoning.

I followed this recipe using chops with the bones. I just also added pepper. It was moist, easy and just delicious. I prepared the dish as suggested and let it marinate in the fridge for a few hours just because I wasn't ready to cook them but wanted the prep out of the way.   I don't know if that helped with the flavor but these were perfect. Thank you.

My family loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was season chops before dipping.  I also used 2 tbs of heavy whipping cream instead of milk. Usually my family does not like to eat left overs, because they prefer a different dish every night.  However, left overs of this recipe was very much welcomed!

I cooked this just like it said except I added fresh cracked pepper to it as well. It turned out really good. It was super easy and a lot healthier than my usual fried pork chops. I will be making this again.

Easy, I added Greek seasoning too, but still seemed to need more herbs or spices.   Dinner included peas, applesauce and salad so it was all quick to make.

We like these very much. Perfect for a busy night when you don't have a lot of time to prepare a fancier meal. I add roasted broccoli that I'm a le to cook at the same time.

It tasted good and was juicy but it was not appetizing in appearance at all.  My kids and I are very visual about food so I doubt that I'll make this again.

I used minced garlic over the top of them and McCormick Montreal steak seasoning..  A smidgen more butter and set the temp to 375 for a little longer each side. Only because my oven gets super hot.. Didn't want to burn.  But I have picky kiddos especially with food...  My kids have never eaten pork chops I've made before...  They loved it even my 2 "oldest" which are the pickier ones went back for 2nd chops..

A total hit with my family.  I followed the recipe as stated but added red sautéed peppers for garnish because the chops did not look done. But they were cooked completely. This will be a regular meal in my home.

By far, this is one of the easiest & tastiest pork chop recipes I have ever made! Hard to believe something this easy could taste so good. They are very moist & had a great flavor. I used boneless chops & added 5 minutes to the cooking time. You must try these!

The flavor was good but too much butter to line the pan & the pork chops didn't really brown. I normally always have luck with all the recipes on Allrecipe website.

Presentation was terrible - they looked disgusting! But, they tasted good and that matters more. They did not dry out and they had great flavor. Thanks for the easy recipe for this beginner cook!

Followed the recipe exactly and these pork chops were delicious.  Moist and tender.  I had no trouble with dryness as others had mentioned.  Seasoned perfectly and my family didn't leave a morsel.

Very simple, but pretty bland for our family that likes full flavors.  Not sure the egg added much but extra calories.  Think we'll go back to baking chops wrapped in tinfoil to ensure they're nice and juicy, and adding more spices and herbs.

This wasn't bad. I would definitely use a meat thermometer much earlier in the process to avoid over cooking like I did, but it was decent, fast and easy.

The only change I will make with this recipe will be to salt only one side of the chops.  My husband and I enjoyed Dijon mustard is a condiment, and I will definitely be making these again!

I didn't use seasoned salt because i had none. I also fried them in a pan for about 10 mins. They were good but next time I will have the season salt and make it as it was intended to be made and I'm sure they will be delicious! Had stuffing and black-eyed peas for sides. As for the way I tried to make them, I give it three stars.

Maybe I shouldn't have butterflied the chops since they were not moist or tender.  They ended up dry and tough and bland. I did not overcook them.  While the recipe calls for four chops it doesn't mention how much they should weigh.

Very simple and easy recipe.  I like the total prep and cook time, didn't take long to prepare.  I may experiment with some different seasonings but this recipe was a winner for my time baking pork chops.

Thankyou for a quick, easy and tasty way to make boneless pork chops. I needed a lower fat version that my boys would enjoy and tried this one. I will be making them this way often. These turned out juicy without having to pan sear first as some other recipes called for.  Great for a busy week night for the family.

The flavor was good but my pork chops did not brown up nicely.  I ended up frying them a bit.

I had pork chops that I wanted to use before they spoiled and looked up baked pork chop recipes and this was the first thing that popped up and it will be the most often used recipe now.... It was easy, moist and very tasty. It seemed that when I tried pan frying chops they were tough or dry. This recipe is awesome and easy.: o)))

Quick and easy and made with ingredients everyone probably already has. They were cooked perfectly but I feel as though they lacked flavor. I might like to add more seasoning next time.

Way over cooked, tasteless, and dry. Glad I added pepper to give it something! Definitely need more than a pinch of garlic powder. Next time, I'll try 6 min each side and check the temp (just 9 on each side put it into the 160 deg area!)

So easy and very good! I will definitely do this again. I used just regular bone in chops but next time I'm trying butterfly chops.
