I made this tonight and my family loved it. I did not use cream, only milk. To thicken I added a roux of 1 tsp cornstarch and 3 tsp of water. I also added old bay seasoning and 1/2 cup Duplin's Scuppernong (sweet) white wine, and parsley flakes, and a dash or two of hot sauce. It really is a great base to make into your own.

I would recommend using this soup as your base to get started!  Thus the reason for the low or average rating. Just going strictly by this recipe - left me with a very bland soup with absolutely no flavor!!  I did alot of adding, just by taste, of course - no specific measurements.  I added a combination of the following: fresh basil, a little chicken broth, a little extra heavy cream, tomatoe and jalapeno flavored cheddar cheese (and even topped to decorate when served), pinch of sugar, Old Bay, and little additional salt and pepper.  Once all of these additions were made to the recipe - it was FANTASTIC!

Also gave 3 stars because by itself it would be a little bland. As a base for cream of crab soup it is perfect, and that's exactly what i was looking for. I added a TON of stuff: Cayenne, creole, lemon thyme, fresh purple basil, old bay, zesty seasoned salt with a hint of lime in place of regular salt, celery seed, red pepper, (if you haven't noticed, I like my soups SPICY!) I wish i would have had celery to add but i didnt, I didn't really add any other vegetables besides the onions. 

For the meat I loaded it up and used about a lb of imitation crab, a lb of jumbo lump crab drained with a little juice left and added to the soup, and 3 small pieces of tilapia i sauteed, and flaked up in a pan were added to the soup. 

I also added a dash of reisling wine. 

Anyways this is an awesome base so use it and get creative, make what you like!

This was very quick and easy and a good way to use left over crab legs.  I did add a touch of old bay to the recipe - simply because i love the spice

A little bland on it's own, but I added Old Bay to my taste and it made this soup perfect with a very nice texture.  It's a great way to use any leftover crabmeat - and a very easy soup recipe.

I'm sorry, I accidentally clicked this to rate it, however was trying to rate a different dish.

As for the Soup, Maybe I did something wrong, cause mine wasn't so good to me, but my husband did like it.

So yummy! Just put a pot on to cook - my girlfriends ask me to make this for them every year on our annual beach trip!  The lump crab comes from the local seafood market so it's always fresh, and it's so quick and easy to prepare!  Definitely one of our favorite meals!
