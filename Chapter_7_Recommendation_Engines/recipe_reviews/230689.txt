Sweet, salty, heat, bacon...what'd not to love?!  I was prepared to fall head over heels for these, but, sadly, did not.  Despite using Oscar Meyer (R) Center Cut bacon (which is wicked then and always crisps nicely), these still took way longer than stated to crisp, resulting in soggy, yet burnt, pretzels (even w/the wire rack to drain the grease).  One star each for the heat (which was a very nice addtion) and novelty, but that's the best I can do.  These won't be a repeater at the LTH house(photo to follow once I can get it to upload...).

Great recipe! These are super easy to make and taste great. The sweet and salty snack made a great appetizer. I made them the night before a party and put them in the refrigerator. I served them room temperature it was an easy snack/appetizer. I did add a bit more red pepper to add spice. Will make again. My kids love them!!

Pretzels were very limp. No pretzel crunch!

Made it again.  Just for my hubby and I.  Split the batch and made some with Parmesan cheese and parsley.  The one with brown sugar and cayenne is our favorite though.  I add a little more than a pinch of cayenne and some sweet paprika.
