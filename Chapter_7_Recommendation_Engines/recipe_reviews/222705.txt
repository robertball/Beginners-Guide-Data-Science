We made this last night for dinner because we had sausage that we didn't know what to do with. The old recipes get so boring. This was AH-MAZING! So good! The ricotta made it very rich and delicious. I only put 4 cups of the mozz cheese, but it was still cheesy delicious. We will definitely make this recipe part of our routine dinners. Thank you for sharing!

Really good....used hot and sweet Italian sausage that was grilled, leftover, and sliced, also used low fat part skim ricotta cheese, pecorino romano, and provolone cheeses. I did not use a crust! I made this frittata style in a deep dish pie plate and upped the eggs to 8. Thanks!

This is one of my family's favorite meals! Very easy and even people who are not fans of spinach or sausage LOVE IT! I want to bring it to events to share its so good! One big tip, LET IT REST when it's done, it will firm up! I would say at least 15 min. to 1/2 hour. Also, this would be even better (if possible) with a side of spaghetti or pizza sauce.

This was a great recipe. I used a deep dish pie plate. I made my own  pastry and it was really flaky as shown in my photo.   I would like to try the recipe in a 9 x 13 casserole dish and cut into smaller servings to feed a crowd. I think next time I will not use the yolk to brush the crust  and instead use an egg white wash.  I may add some finely chopped onion to the filling next time. The Italian sausage I used did not have an over powering flavor of fennel and we liked that as we are not big fans of strong fennel.  Served this with a side of fresh fruit salad.  It is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing your recipe Kimberly

I tried this recipe as 4 - 1 cup tarts and it worked well.  I halved all the ingredients except the pie crust and used low-fat ricotta.  I cut each of the pie crusts into quarters and placed a piece in the bottom of each lightly greased non-stick tart pan.  The filling divided up evenly and I topped it with another quarter of the crust.  I trimmed the crust a bit and baked at 375 degrees for 35 minutes.  I let it set for 15 or so minutes.

Very good recipe!  I used a 4 cup package of Mozzarella rather than the 5 cups stated.  Only other change was to sautee some onion and garlic with the sausage.  Delicious.  Only cooled about 10 minutes and was firm in texture.  Will make again for sure.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was good.  Since this is a fat and calorie heavy dish, I used 4 cups of mozzarella instead of 5 and bumped up the spinach from 10 oz. frozen to 16 oz. fresh. Also added about 1 tsp of Italian seasoning and a little bit of onion.  Everyone liked it, consistency was great . . . nice and firm as I took the advice here an let it sit for about 20+ minutes before slicing.

I loved this recipe because it is a good foundation.  I made it how it was written the first time . The following times (3) I changed ingredients. I used ham, cottage cheese, swiss cheese, cheddar cheese and onions one time.  Pepperoni, sausAge and swiss cheese another time.  It's just a good recipe.

Wonderful!! I followed the recipe to a T & it turned out perfect. I was a little weary about 5C of cheese but it was not too gooey @ all. There is quite a lot of filling. Since I do not have a deeper pie dish, I used a shallow one in addition to a square glass casserole dish. I just doubled up on pie crust. It was nice to have an additional meal to share with a neighbor.

Wow!  Flavorful and relatively simple!  This time, I used the basic recipe but had fresh mushrooms and spinach on hand.  I steamed the spinach in the microwave to release some of the water and drained on paper towels (used in place of frozen).  I saut√©ed the mushrooms in olive oil.  Both were added to the mixture.  Also, I had a little bit of Feta that needed to be used, so I added it, too.  I love that this recipe is great as is or can be adapted to what you might have on hand.!

I loved this as a kid, so I decided to try it out on my hubby and 8 year old son. They loved it! I put  just over 3 cups of cheese instead of 5. I think next time I'll add more veggies and a little less cheese.

This was sooo good!  I used fresh spinach and cottage cheese as my store didn't have Ricotta.  I also used a spicy Italian sausage for extra flavor.  This was the prefect easy meal to serve overnight company and could be used either for breakfast or a dinner meal.

Amazing.  Used turkey Italian sausage and didn‚Äôt quite have enough ricotta so I put a little bit of cottage cheese into it to make up the difference.

This recipe is a good start, but i didn't think it was quite enough flavor. I used 2 cups parmesan instead of 5 cups mozzerella because it's what i had on hand, added a small onion, mushrooms and italian seasoning (premixed). it was just enough to fill the pie plate and a little healthier with less cheese. PERFECTION!!

Made no changes except eliminating the addition of salt and it was WAY too salty.  What a waste of expensive cheese.  BTY used Bianca sausage which is known as the best available in the Northeast.

Made this for my beautiful bride tonight, and she loved it. I did make a few changes. I reduced the mozz by a cup, increased the ricotta to 1 cup, added onions to the Italian sausage, and doubled the amount of garlic. It was incredibly tasty, and my wife loved it. We will be making this again.

I used 4 cups mozzarella as someone else recommended and it was plenty. My husband commented on how creamy and cheesy it was. Also, I used coarsely chopped fresh spinach.  Delicious!

I had high expectations for this after reading all the rave reviews, but I made it exactly as written and it didn't have much flavor.  My 7-year-old was the first to say, "It doesn't taste like anything," and I agreed.  It wasn't terrible, but if I make it again I'll be sure to crush some garlic in there and maybe add some Italian seasoning and/or some tomato pieces with the seeds squeezed out.

I loved this recipe.  My 2 year old that only wants meat and cheese ate it all! I did make one change.  I didn't realize that my pie crust wasn't a deep dish until I was ready to pour in the ingredients. You will need a deep dish if you are using a pie crust because of the volume.  I greased a casserole dish, spread 6 slices of whole wheat bread on the bottom and poured the mixture on top of it.  I removed the regular pie crusts from the pans and creatively placed them on top of the mixture.  I still worked out WELL! I will be repeating this recipe--with or without the modification.

We really liked it, will make again.  The only change was to add a good heaping tablespoon of chopped garlic since we are garlic lovers.  My 9.5" pie plate was full and this was rich.  As I do with fruit pies, I covered the crust with foil for the first half of baking to make sure the crust doesn't burn.  I cooked for 60 minutes; the crust was golden brown, though the pie never did bubble.
