These turned out great. I used yellow and orange peppers. I left them in the broiler until their skins were almost black and then put them in a plastic bag for about 10 minutes so it's easier to peel them. I will definitely make this again. Thanks EC.

This was quite good.  I skipped the sunflower seeds- as I merely wanted the bell peppers on their own.  I also added a little more balsamic vinegar for a tangier taste.

Very different and very good. I'm usually not a fan of sunflower seeds, but done this way, they were delicious!

I marinated the peppers for a bit, then tossed them with some of the dressing after roasting. I toasted some sesame seeds with the sunflower seeds, and it was really good! We'll try this on the grill!

This is another very good way to serve roasted bell peppers. I didn't care for putting the dressing on before roasting as it just burned under the heat of the broiler. It is a very tasty accompaniment so I anded up adding a bit more once the peppers had roasted. The sunflower seeds add a nice flavor as well as texture. Thank you for the recipe.
