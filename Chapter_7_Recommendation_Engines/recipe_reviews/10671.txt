Great cookies...used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. applesauce instead of shortening to cut down on fat and they turned out great.  Also added 1 tsp of nutmeg.

Great recipe! Because I knew this would be a more cake-like batter I just spread it in a 13 by 9 inch pan and made pumpkin squares. I only had to bake it for five minutes longer and they came out so fluffy and light. Instead of just a cup of pumpking I added at least another fourth for more flavoe and a half cup of oats. Though I think next time I'll add a full cup.
Definitly making this again- we loved it so much my boyfriend is taking a bunch to work for everyone to try :)

very good.  used 1/2c butter & 1/2c apple sauce instead of shortening.  also added a big of nutmeg, and used the whole can of pumpkin.  hit the spot, no icing needed.... but i would probably use cream cheese icing if i did ice them.  :)

These are awesome cookies! They are soft and stay that way the next day. They are like little slices of pumpkin bread. The only things I did different is first I used pumpkin pie spice and then I heated up a can of cream cheese frosting for like 30 seconds and drizzled it over the cookies. Then I put a whole pecan on top. They were pretty and delicious. I made them the first time this last weekend and now my hubby wants me to make them for his shop for their Thanksgiving lunch. I am off to make them again, now!

Very tasty...great texture!  I added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and the whole (small) can of pumpkin (15oz?), just couldn't throw out the rest after adding the 1 cup!  Didn't need the frosting! Thanks Terry1

Excellent cookie!  Know before baking that these are more cake-like than cookie like in consistency.

Most of the recipes I found for pumpkin cookies called for rolled oats, nutmeg, etc.  Things my kids wouldn't eat.  This recipe is easy, very moist, and simple which means my kids love it!  They even love it without the icing!

Yummy cookies! I liked them with just a thin glaze of frosting. I did add about a 1/2 tsp. of ginger. Double the recipe - they go fast !!!

These Cookies are absolutely wonderful! I used the entire can of pumpkin, also,  I didn't bother with the icing and they were light fluffy and still sweet enough. YES, they do taste like muffin caps!  HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

I have been making these cookies for 3 years now and never get tired of hearing how wonderful they are! I omit the shortening and add 1/2c of butter and 1/2c of apple sauce instead. And in addition to the cinnamon I add 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and a sprinkle of extra nutmeg. I also add the whole 14 oz can of pumpkin to the batter!I have added chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, or drizzled with a light cream cheese glaze and all have been delicous!!

My 14 month old would live on these cookies if I let him.  They are really wonderful.  I had to share the recipe with my pregnant friend who couldn't stop eating them when she came over.  They are great becuase they aren't too sweet and they stay moist (if you can keep them around without getting eaten).  They keep you regular as well (another benifit for the pregnant woman!).

We loved these!  I did however, use  1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup apple sauce as others suggested to cut down on the fat and they were excellent!  Thank you for recipe and thanks to those who made the suggestion of lower fat.  You would not have known the difference!  (They didn't need to be frosted either!)

These were good- I subtitued margarine for shortening, and used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 white sugar. I threw in some dried cranberries instead of raisins and used the walnuts. I just dabbed the tops with store bought vanilla icing and my kids loved them. They are better cold then hot which is rare for a cookie. Good recipe

I made a few changes- but this is an AWESOME base!

I added a dash of clove and nutmeg to the mix and instead of raisins (which I think are icky) I used dried cranberries.  I also substituted the shortening for butter that was slightly melted and stuck the batter in the fridge for 20 minutes before baking.

They turned out FANTASTIC!  So cakey and delicious!  My husband ate 4 off of the cooling rack as I was putting the next round into the oven!

Delicious!  I used 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup applesauce as others suggested.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg and will add a sprinkle of ground cloves next time I make them.  I also used 1/2 All-Purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour since these were for my toddlers.  They rise nicely while cooking and end up fluffy and soft!  Stayed fresh in a tupperware container for almost a week.  I'm amazed they lasted that long!  They didn't need frosting, but I might dust them with powdered sugar next time, at my husband's suggestion.

These cookies are delicious!!  I took some to work and everyone loved them.  They didn't last too long at home either. I changed the recipe a little.  I use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of the whole cup of white sugar.  I used 1 cup butter instead of the shortening and I put about 1/4 tsp. nutmeg in the recipe.  I also put canned cream cheese icing on them.  They turned out wonderful.  I will definitely make these again soon.  This was the first time I made pumpkin cookies.  Thanks for the good recipe.

MY KIDS LOVED THESE!  I made them for a church gathering and the ladies just didn't go for them so my kids were pleased to see them come home!  I used baking butter instead of shortening.  They stayed in cookie form but were more of a cake.  Next time may try it as muffins or a cake. I didn't ice them this time but may try next time.

mmm delicious!! i used: 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup applesauce 2/3 cup packed brown sugar, 1/6 cup white sugar 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup bread flour 2 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp nutmeg about 1 1/2 cup canned pumpkin (i had part of a can left and just used it all. this is a versatile recipe) a mixture of about 1 1/3 cups of chocolate chips, raisins, and craisins  batter was good. fresh out of the oven was good. but... plastic wrapped when still warm and unwrapped the next day--the moisture gets trapped within the cookie. it's delicious. when people call a cookie "cake-like," i usually think of light, fluffy, not hearty cakes. but if this cookie is to be described as cake-like, it's definitely dense, the good stuff. loved this recipe!  ps--each cookie was about 100 calories

Absolutely fantastic!!! I took the advice of another reviewer and baked it in a 9x13 pan instead. It only lasted a day!! Even my ultra-picky 5 year old gobbled it up. The only change I made was using the Club House Pumpkin Pie Spice as I couldn't find my cinnamon. Turned out fantastic. I topped it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II (here on the site) and just WOW!!!! This is going in my keeper file for sure.

These cookies have a great texture. To reduce fat, I replaced the shortening with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup non-fat plain yogurt. I also added all-spice and ground ginger to the flour mixture. Finally, I added lemon zest and lemon juice to the glaze. They turned out very good! I want to try again reducing the fat content even more.

These were a big hit.  It's kind of like eating a muffin cap.  I made the batter plain, then added a few nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips to the top of each cookie before baking them, and made a few plain.  The plain ones had a tendency to fall apart.  I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  I'll make these every year!

This cookie was very good, though more cakelike than I usually like.  They also tend to be very moist when storing them.  I would make these again, though I'm searching for a less cake-like cookie with more of a pumpkin taste.

I'm an amateur baker, and I found this a pretty easy and delicious recipe.  I did make a few modifications, based on the ingredients I had at home.  

Instead of shortening, I used 1 cup of margarine.  And instead of 1 cup of canned pumpkin, I used 1 1/4 cup of canned pumpkin pie filling (already pre-seasoned), which was about half of an E.D. Smith 544mL can.  

I didn't add any raisins or walnuts to the batter, but I did add some walnuts as toppings once I dropped the batter onto the cookie sheets.  I experimented with toppings, trying pecans, semi-sweet chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips (in addition to the walnut ones, and the ones I left w/o toppings).

These are delicious. I did change the recipe as follows: omitted walnuts & raisins. Added 1/3 cup quick oats, nutmeg, ginger, xtra cinnamon, white chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips. I'm considering drizzling melted white chocolate on top to make them pretty and a little extra sweet. The cookie itself is not too sweet which I like. Great base recipe that you can add what you like to. The cookie is soft inside like cake, but set up well.

Melt in your mouth cookies!  I didn't ice them because I figure that would be a bit much sugar for my children.  But, I do think a cream cheese icing would be really good with these cookies.

Oh my goodness. I made these back in October and I am still dreaming about them, LOL. My co-workers ate them up. They truly are wonderful. I didn't use any icing because they don't need it. They are very cakelike and melt in your mouth. YUUMMY!

very good right out of the oven! however, not five stars b/c I had to add an extra teaspoon of spices after I tasted the first batch. Covered with a buttercream frosting with a bit of cinnamon mixed in. Used the "sugar cookies with buttercream frosting" recipe and omitted the butter extract

I have a feeling that these are going to be an annual fall favorite in my household!  The dough is a bit runny, to overcome this I just refrigerated it for 10 minutes before each batch and add an 1/8th cup of flour.  I added some cinnamon and chocolate chips and used the following frosting: http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/SeaFoamFrosting.asp?lnkid=563

They came out delicious, moist, and spicy, and made the house smell great too!  Thank you Terry for the great recipe!

This recipe was very good. The cookies just melt in your mouth. I make them plain and with chocolate chips. I accidentally used pre spiced pumpkin and the cookies turned out wonderful! Dont add any more spices they are perfect.
Thank you Terry!!

These came out great!  I added 1 tsp. of nutmeg to mine and 1/2 tsp. extra cinnamon (I like a bit of extra spice).  I also substituted light butter in place of shortening.  They are so soft but don't crumble easily.  Awesome recipe!

Goofed on the recipe and added 1 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar (I had two windows of recipes open). This turned out to be a happy accident! I substituted 1 cup of softened butter for the shortening and added about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. These cookies are great with white chocolate chips!

This cookies were so soft and moist.  My family really enjoyed them.  I had leftover pumpkin from baking bread and this was a wonderful way to use up the left over pumpkin.  I'll definately be making these cookies again.

These are very good cookies!!! I followed a couple other people's suggestions and substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup margarine for the shortening.   I also substituted 1/2 cup ww flour and 1/2 AP for the 1 cup flour and used the whole tsp of cinnamon, plus a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, allspice and cloves for personal tastes, also 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white.  But great recipe to work with!!!!!!!  Not too sweet or heavy either.  Thanks for the great base to start with!!!

Didn't turn out quite how I thought they would... They turned out even better.  Kind of plain, but I think thats a good thing sine we have three kids, one of which is autistic and doesn't need the extra sweets. 
Thanks for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

After all the glowing remarks I was so disappointed with these cookies. They baked nicely, almost like a cake/cookie, but definitely needed spicing up. I added a bit of extra pumpkin spice and, as suggested by others, added chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. They were still bland. HOWEVER my husband liked them so that's the reason I gave this recipe 4 stars!

I happily altered this recipe.  I substituted half of the shortening with applesauce, and half of the flour with oatmeal.  The first batch was a little runny, though, so I had to add more flour.  In the end, they turned out pretty good!  But not as good as mom made.

I used a whole can (15 oz or so) of pumpkin and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I didn't use the cinnamon. Next time, I'll add more raisins and increase the pumpkin spice a bit. These were good and more cake-like than cookie.

I felt it had very little flavor so I added 2tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to it. I also was not sure if you were supposed to grease the cookie sheet so they don't stick.  The answer to that is no!  I had to throw that batch out. It wasn't to bad.  I used cream cheese icing and stored them in the fridge.

Delicious! Perfect little bites of Fall. Very soft and muffin like, but that’s exactly what I wanted. I too added a little nutmeg and used more pumpkin than the recipe called for. The cookies are yummy on their own , but I’m definitely going to top them off with a little vanilla cinnamon glaze.

Easy. That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of these. 
I added golden raisins, which is probably a huge plus, as the recipe as-is doesn't have much flavour besides the  Crisco. 
TIPS: I recommend adding lemon grind, all spice .. maybe a bit of cinnamon.
While the texture was light and soft, they didn't have much to them. I don't think I'd I'd make them again. They tasted super bland.

These are the perfect texture, and not overly sweet. I used butter in place of shortening, and added pumpkin pie spices because I love that mix more than cinnamon alone. These are like little spice cakes. Made a simple cream cheese frosting and made cookie sandwiches, and rolled the frosted middle in a bowl of fall colored sprinkles. They looked as good as they taste. A huge hit with adults and children.

These cookies were absolutely delicious! However since I made some adaptations to the recipe I can't give it 5 stars. 
First off I eliminated the shortening as suggested, and instead used half a cup of butter and half a cup of coconut oil.  I didn't want to use white sugar so instead I used a combination of golden and dark brown sugar, and only put in 3/4 of what the recipe called for. Because I wanted these to have more of the pumpkin spice flavouring, I also added powdered ginger and cloves, and they turned out just the way I wanted them too. For fun I topped them with a single craisin, and made a ginger glaze (ginger paste, icing sugar, and a dash of milk) that just put them over the top delicious! They were a huge hit!

Very good, very moist cookies.  I substituted maple extract for the vanilla and it gave it a really nice flavor.
