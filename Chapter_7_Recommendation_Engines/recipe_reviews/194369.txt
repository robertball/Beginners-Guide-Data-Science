Delicious and easy recipe. For the crust, I used about 2 more tablespoons of butter for good no-crumble insurance. Hell, it's a recipe using over a pound of oreos and 2 pounds of fat laden cream cheese - no sense in skimping on ingredients :) I also used about 12 oz of whipped cream (cool wHip) to make it a little less dense. Again, very simple recipe that makes people think you did more work than it actually required.

So good! I used whipped cream in place of the frozen whipped topping. Really easy to make and more than satisfied my Cookies 'n' Cream loving family. Thanks.

This is one of the easiest and tastiest recipes I've ever tried! Took it with me to a party and it was the first cake to fnish :)  I used freshly whipped cream instead of whipped topping, so that the amount of sugar can be reduced according to taste. Because it wasn't so sweet, the focus was on the oreos and cream cheese - delicious!

This is pretty awesome.  I made it for my Christmas party and my friends loved it.  =)  My crust fell apart.  I think I needed more than 1/4 cup of butter.  Otherwise, everything else turned out great.

This cake was delicious, and quite simple to make. Just make sure to really crush the Oreos for the crust until the mass is as fine as possible, and use a bit more melted butter than the recipe suggests in order to make sure the crust stays together. I left the cake in the fridge for 24 hours, and the texture was perfect when I took it out. It looks good, too!

This was easy and surprisingly good! I don't like Cool Whip, so I made real whipped cream.. I beat 1.5 cups cream, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract and sugar to taste

This was the best ever I was nervous about it turning out good. I did add more butter for the crust though and it was a tad rich maybe next time I will use 1 less cream cheese but overall it was fantastic wii definitely make again thanks for the wonderful recipe

Made last nite but with a twist.  I used ( 2 packages )of Oreo Cookies that had Reese's Peanut Butter filling, that's 60 cookies.  I made 2 crusts.  One for the bottom and one for the top. When presented it looked like a big Oreo Cookie.  Any recipe that has Oreo & Reese's in the title can't be denied!!!! Was done in a springform pan.

This didn't turn out well for me. I used double stuffed Oreos maybe that's why. I could not cover the bottom of a 13*9" pan I had to use an 8*8. Mine tasted light straight cream cheese. I'm not sure what else I did wrong.

Need 2 packages of Oreos depending on your pan size and how thick you want your crust.

Made this the other day and all i can say is YUM! It is so easy and quick to make and it turned out great, even better than I expected. I made the recipe to a 't' and didn't change a thing. It has the perfect balance of rich cream cheese and Oreo cookie flavor without being too sweet and I absolutely love it as well did everyone else! I'll be making this again!

My kids and I were so excited to make this. I took a few if the suggestions that read: i used a 8 × 10 pyrex dish, 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/4, reduced the amount of cream cheese from (4) 8 oz bars to 3, 1 cup of sugar, and I used 1 and 1/4 tub of cool whip.  Even with these changes, it was still not sweet enough and the cream cheese overpowered the oreo cookie flavor. Next time, we will only use (2) 8 oz bars of cream cheese, two tubs of whip cream, 1 cup of sugar, and two packages of oreos. I think these adjustments will make this cheese perfect. But, it was still a decent recipe and a good base to tweak to your liking.

I always go a bit over with the vanilla flavoring, and it’s always highly raved about. This is a delicious dessert! It’s great with mint Oreo as well!

Made this for a friends birthday and it was great. If I made it again I'd probably reduce it to 3 blocks of the cream cheese though, it made a almost too much for my pie plate to handle!

This was very well-received by my company tonight. I don't know if I will make it again, but I might use this base recipe for other cookie-type no-bake desserts.  I put it in an 8" springform pan.  The cheesecake, including the crust, was slightly less than 2 inches thick.  I think it would be very thin if you spread it out in a 9 x 13 pan.  I dressed it up with some chocolate covered strawberries that I made myself.

I really liked it, except I felt it tasted a little too much like plain cream cheese. I think in the future when I make it (and I will make it again, because it was GOOD), I will add more whipped topping to it.

I love this recipe so much! It is super quick and easy. My best friend's dad can't wait for me to make it again! I would highly recommend the recipe, although it just barely makes enough for a 9x13 pan, so I increase the amounts of everything slightly.

I made this as our Thanksgiving dessert and the family loved it. I was nervous about its outcome and just as leery about a no-bake recipe, but it came out surprisingly well. I will most definitely be making this again, but with a little less cream cheese and a bit more Oreo cookies. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It turned out well, however it is VERY rich! I might try using less cream cheese next time and more whipped topping.

This is fantastic! The reviews I read about it having too much cream cheese are crazy. On the package of Philadelphia for making original cheese cake it says to use 4 pkg, and that's from the manufacturer. So if you don't like your cheesecake to taste like... cheesecake, don't use this recipe. But it was delicious. 

I didn't use the crust part of this, so I was able to use the whole pack or oreos in the cheesecake.

I used all reduced fat cream cheese and fat free cool whip and this was still very rich.  A small piece goes a long way, but I feel the crust should have been a bit thicker to help with serving.  Very easy to make and everyone raved about it at the potluck.

Recipe has possibilities but needs tweaking. WAY too much cream cheese.  I thought 4 eight ounce packages sounded like too much but I followed the recipe anyway.  I would try it again but with less cream cheese & more Cool Whip, just not sure what to use for measurements. Also, I used peanut butter Oreos & loved that aspect of it.

Disappointed.  I didn't like the texture and it was extremely sweet.  I guess this is what happens when an entire package of oreos is added.  I liked the simplicity of a no-bake cheesecake but I definitely prefer the smoothness and creaminess of a baked one.  Even my oreo loving kids were not thrilled.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except tried to making it a little bit healthier by using lite cream cheese and one can of lite whipped cream (since they don't have cool whip where I am) and it turned out perfect. Our oven is not working, so this was the perfect easy no-bake recipe. Thank you!
