This recipe is awesome. I did change some things: I used Whole Wheat flour (With the Cocoa color, you cant even tell, if youve got picky eaters), and I used half the oil . I made up the 1/3c difference with milk. I also added a handful of walnuts. This probably shouldnt be an every day breakfast, but its amazingly good!

These muffins were very tasty and easy to make.  I halved the amount of oil, though and used half applesauce.  They were very moist!

I read the other reviews and decided that 425 seemed a little hot for this recipe so I baked the muffins at 350 for 15-20 minutes and they came out perfect.  My husband and I have really enjoyed them.

i found my batter to be a bit dry when it was all mixed together, so i added 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt and then was able to get the right consistency of batter. turned out great!

After tasting these muffins and then reading the reviews I had to double-check to see if I remembered everything. The muffings were dry and tasteless. Even slathering them with butter didn't make them more appealing to my kids.

These are delicious and very easy! I was a little bit low on banana, so I added about a half cup of applesauce and they were great. My five-year old thinks they're the best ever.

These were delicious! I didn't have sunflower oil so I used corn oil. I used a slightly larger muffin tin (heart-shaped) so next time I would reduce the cooking time a by a minute or so. 15 mins. was almost too much.

Very fast and easy recipe.  I did have to substitute for a few things.  Canola oil works just as good, but I'm sure the flavour would be nice with the sunflower oil.  I prefer milk choc chips instead.  I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flower.  The cocoa powder is a really nice touch.

Absolutely delicious!  I subbed White Whole Wheat Flour for the all-purpose and Splenda for the sugar (we were all out).  They were eaten up in less than 24 hours, everyone loved them!  My subs made for a slightly healthier version (300cal and 5g fiber) but next time I'll definitely try adding applesauce and halving the oil since they're still quite high in fat (but arguably worth it!).  I certainly plan on making these again!

Really?!?!  People like these muffins??  I found them to be brick-like.  And only 2 TB of cocoa did nothing for the flavor, just made them brown in color.  I did use veg oil instead of sunflower seed oil so maybe that was the problem (?).  Blah.

When I made these, they came out awful. The bottom of the muffins were a bit burned, they did not taste good, and when I cut one open it was like the chocolate chips hadn't melted... even in 425 degrees.  Chips just popped out and I followed the recipe pretty closely. If you try these, read other reviews and see how you can improve.

Using half applesauce and half oil as well as lowering the temperature to 350 helped a lot and it addressed the concerns of it not being sweet, or moist enough.  If you're concerned about it not being enough "banana" flavor, trying using some banana extract.  Works every time. :)

These muffins were pretty tasty. I used canola oil instead of sesame seed oil and i'm not sure if that made a difference but there was a definite oil taste to the muffins. I'd suggest lowering the amount of oil like some other people have been suggesting. Overall they tasted real good. Also, maybe i'm just being stingy, but i had to use 5 bananas to fill 1 1/2 cups and that seemed a bit excessive.

This recipe is awesome! I used canola oil instead of sunflower seed oil and my muffins were dark brown due to the cocoa powder as well! They rose perfectly and I thought that I overfilled! The look and taste amazing! What a great recipe!

I read through the reviews before I made these muffins, just to make sure I got the best end product possible. I did not have sunflower seed oil so I used half melted butter/half unsweetened applesauce in it's place. I didn't want them to turn out dry, so just to be on the safe side, I added another large mashed banana. I also only used a teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda. I got 18 large muffins out of one recipe and I baked mine at 350 for just over 20 minutes. These turned out okay, I'm glad I added the extra banana as even with the extra banana, they still turned out a little dry. The kids liked these but my husband and I weren't huge fans. We just didn't care for the cocoa and the chocolate chips, we both thought it would have been better had there been one or the other. My husband made a comment about how mini chocolate chips would have been better and maybe half the amount, maybe.

Foolproof muffins that are delicious.  I forgot to add the oil -- had to add it at the end (usually a disastrous idea) -- but the muffins still came out moist and yummy.

I made no alterations to this recipe.

Love.these.  I wouldn't change a thing, but for my own preference on fat content I'll use half applesauce and half oil next time.

My family thought they were DELICIOUS! I substituted sunflower seed oil for olive oil and i also substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips for milk chocolate chips and instead of putting one and half bananas I put two bananas.  Even after all the substitutions they were still worth it!

I have to say that I almost didn't end up baking these muffins after I tasted the batter - but I am so glad that I did!  Like some others, I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 canola oil.  I also added a few spoonfulls of peanut butter (why not!?) and added some sugar in the raw on the top for an extra crunch.  Excellent muffins that I will definately make again.  I also used a slightly larger pan (6 jubmo muffins) and cooked for 20 minutes - which was way too long.  Will shorten next time.

I took the advice of many reviewers and they turned out GREAT!  I generally do NOT like chocolate/banana combined, but this is really good.  Here's what I did:  Baked them on 350 degrees for about 15 minutes; used whole wheat flour, no all purpose; added 2 TBSP of sugar; used about 1/2 cup of canola oil AND 1/2 cup of regular applesauce (Motts original, so I expect it has been sweetened); 2 TSP of vanilla.  The sweetness is just right, the moisture content is just right.  They are a heavier muffin, so don't expect something light and fluffy, but if you are looking for something yummy and substantial, this is a good one.

Very good recipe. The dough seamed too dry so I added 2 Tbsp of vanilla coffee creamer (instead of milk for more flavor). I took the advice from other reviews and lowered the oven temperature to 350 degrees and baked them for 15 to 17 minutes. My husband ate 4 muffins before they even had time to cool! We will definitely keep this recipe!

I bought a couple of bunches of overripe organic bananas on sale yesterday, and planned to make a bunch of different banana delights...  These muffins were absolutely delicious, and by far the best out of all the treats I made.  Definitely a desert muffin, which was fine by me! My 6 yr old son, husband, and mother all loved them... 

My adjustments included using sucanat  (unrefined pure cane sugar) instead of white sugar, and extra virgin olive oil instead of sunflower seed oil.  I followed all the measurements to a tee - was concerned about the generous amount of oil - but used it anyway...  They came out moist and packed with flavour! 

Next time I would like to see what happens if I decrease the amount of oil and add almond milk, applesauce, or an extra egg to compensate...  Also, I would like to try spelt and/or whole wheat flour, and decreasing the amount of chocolate chips.  Making them a little more nutritious and lower in fat would mean I could eat more, riiiiiight? ;-P  tee hee...

These aren't very good.  I expected them to have the light texture that you expect from a miffin, but they are very heavy (almost doughy).  They aren't nearly sweet enough, and are really pretty flavorless.  If not for the chocolate chips, they wouldn't be edible.

These were great.  Super easy to make and very yummy.  They do have a cake like texture and they are a nice change from regular muffins.  I did not make any changes and mine came out perfect.  I will make again for sure.

I was so disappointed in these muffins because they sounded like they'd be so good.  My kids didn't like them at all and I tried one and thought the banana was too overpowering and just tasted off.  I checked all my ingredients to see if anything was spoiled, but everything was okay...they just didn't taste good to us.

These were absoutely awful.  I read the other poor reviews and thought "how bad can they really be?"  They were hard, dense, thick, and TASTELESS.  I could barely choke one down ans threw the rest away.  Look for another recipe!

This recipe makes good mini muffins, using the amounts listed, it make about 3 dozen for me. I used half applesauce and half oil and also half whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier for my daughter. The batter seemed a bit dry, so I added a splash of canola oil :)

I altered this recipe to make it slightly healthier. I used whole wheat flour in place of regular flour. I also halved the oil (used canola) and added 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce. They turned out really well, and the wheat taste and texture makes them a little heartier and a lot healthier. Outstanding right out of the oven with a glass of milk.

Great recipe.  Substituted vanilla Greek yogurt and half whole wheat flour.  Baked some in a donut pan.  My kids love them for snack at school.  Have been making these for a couple of years, it's a keeper.

Very fast and delicious.  I did make a few changes to combat dryness: for the bananas, I mashes 3 1/2 medium very ripe and I added 1/3 cup applesauce to it.  This made the muffins nice and moist.  I also used canola oil instead of sunflower seed oil b/c it's all I had on hand.  I used paper cup liners in the muffin pan.  Instead of 12 muffins, it made 18.  Baked at 425 for 15 minutes and done!

I substituted applesauce for all the oil, added a few tblspns each of flax meal and wheat germ for added nutrition (you can't taste it at all!), and halved the choc chips.  It made 24 standard sized muffins for me.  My 1 year old and 3 year old both loved them!  Super moist!  A few people commented on the "baking powder" taste - whenever I mix my dry ingredients, I mix thoroughly with a whisk to get everything combined, then pour through my sifter - you will never ever have that problem again.  (tip - if adding wheat germ/flax/oatmeal or any other whole grain to make your baked goods more nutritious, make sure to add it to the wet ingredients - don't put it through the sifter, or you'll find some grains get stuck and come find their way out in your next batch of frosting, no matter how well you clean it!)

these are great muffins, I will make them again. After reading the reviews, I used whole wheat flour and instead of 2/3c of oil I used 1/3 c. oil and 1/3 c. milk.  It made 16 muffins.  The chocolate masks the whole wheat flour and no one will ever know! Yummy!

Wow..Heavenly! These were fantastic! Moist, and full of flavour. My 14 yr.old devoured half of the first batch. I had to make another batch and doubled it this time!
I made just 2 minor changes. I baked them at 375 (Convection)instead of 425, for 15-20 min. and added 1 tsp.cinnamon/nutmeg.  I used some very, very overripe bananas and barely mashed them, leaving them a bit chunky. I wasn't sure how the cinna/nutmeg would complement the cocoa/chocolate chips flavor but they were fantastic! Full of banana flavour..with heavenly, warm gooey chocolate chips!
Well done! My whole family thanks you for sharing this recipe!!

I wanted to find a recipe that was similar to my favorite seasonal muffin at Mimi's Cafe.  You can't get any closer than these!  I added suggested items: 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar, 1 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 the amount of chocolate chips, and 1/4 c. milk to make them lighter.  I also cooked them for about 25 minutes at 350.  They turned out perfect!!!!

Wonderful, easy recipe. I also changed a couple of things to create a healthier snack. Whole wheat flour, 1/3 C FF plain yogurt, 1/3 C canola oil & 1/3 C FF milk. Baked @350 for 20 min. They froze very well in individual ziplocks - defrost overnight in the fridge.

I just took these to a baby shower and got lots of compliments.  They kept asking where I bought them!  I used half chocolate chips and half butterscotch ones and a mini muffin pan.  They cooked about 13 minutes at 400.  Great recipe!  Thanks Noni!

these are great muffins although i did make it healthier by using applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil, added 2 teaspoons of vanilla, used whole wheat instead of white, and also used splenda in place of all the sugar- they are not too sweet and are a delicious but healthy great snack- also cooked at 350 for about 20 minutes.

These aren't as good as I thought and I followed the directions exactly. The amount of chocolate chips is good, but I am unsure what the 2 tbsp of cocoa is for. These have a taste of in between chocolate and in between banana, if that makes sense.

This is such an easy recipe! I also found the batter was a bit dry and I added about three tablespoons of milk and sorted it out.  My kids all loved them and I will use this again, as I said it's just so quick and easy.

These are great.   The first time we found that the coco powder over powered the banana.   Second batch we removed the coco powder and they were great.

These were not exactly what I expected, and I did not like them. However, my husband took them to work and everyone raved about them. So take that, I guess. It just wasnt my taste, personally.

Very easy to make and quite tasty.  My 10 yr old loves them.  I had to bake them for almost 25 minutes at 350.  I used the lower heat setting because of what the other reviews suggested.

Very good muffins.  Added 1/2 cup of quick-cooking oats, 1/4 cup of the oil instead of the 2/3 cup and 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips instead of the 1 cup.  They are good either way.  Thanks a lot!!

The flavors were good since I added sugar and more vanilla as suggested. However, the texture was not satifying at all. Very dense. I suggest adding more milk, some butter, cinnamon.. just realized could have done that.. I love this combo so much that I almost want the recipe owner to rewrite it and maybe add more details to it just in case I missed something here.. Might help. Might try another recipe with the combo of banana and chocolate. Cheers guys! And happy cooking!

Excellent muffins...the only comment I have is that the 15 mins baking time is too much. I baked them for 12 mins and they were already getting brown around the edges. But, overall, I definitely recommend!

These were wonderful!  Didn't have sunflower oil, so used canola.  They came out a little brown on the edges, so next time I'd lower the temperature or decrease cooking time.

We think they turned out great. A nice mix of chocolate and banana, just sweet enough and with a good texture. I made a big mistake, realizing I had accidentally turned the oven off, so they ended baking  at 350 - 375 for 25 minutes. They may have baked a bit too long. But still, great flavor and texture. I will make these again!

Yum!  Easy to make with ingredients on hand.  I used 1/3 cup canola oil and 1/3 cup applesauce - instead of the 2/3 cup oil.  Used 3/4 cup chocolate chips, which was plenty for our tastes!  Also, turned the temp. down to 375 degrees and baked for 20 minutes.  Used toothpick to check for doneness.  Will make these again and again.  Thanks!

Excellent muffin recipe. I did cut back on the oil though to 1/2c and used frozen bananas. The extra moisture from the defrosted bananas more than made up for the decrease in oil. Also I added about 1 1/2 TBS of peanut butter to experiment, next time I would add more for extra protein.

these were very moist and just sweet and chocolatey enough. here are my adjustments: baked at 375 for 17 minutes. subbed whole wheat for all purpose flour. subbed apple sauce for all but 2 TBS of the oil. Only used 3/4 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. Added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. FYI the 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas was equal to 4 small/medium sized bananas.  yummy!

Good...just a hair bland...next time I will add a little more salt perhaps? I used 1/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce and added walnuts since I didn't have a full cup of chocolate chips. 
This actually filled a 12 count normal sized muffin tin and a 12 count mini muffin tin. 
I baked at 400 degress for 13 minutes for the large and 8 minutes for the mini tins. But I think 425 would have been just fine too!

I thought the amount of oil in this recipe was way too much, so I only used 1/3 cup of oil, plus 1/3 cup of fruit yoghurt. The result was still delicious but not super greasy. I also skipped the chocolate chips and substituted with chopped almonds.

My family loves this recipe!  Used 1/3 apple sauce and 1/3 milk instead of oil, brown sugar instead of white and w.w. flour instead of all purpose.  Turned out to be a great healthy snack for all of us.  Thanks!

I have looked for a banana muffin recipe that when cooled, the top stays crunchy as so many banana muffins get soggy or too moist once cooled and in the container. Very yummy recipe and I too split the oil with applesauce to cut the fat a bit and added a touch more that the 2/3 cup called for as it seemed dry.

A very yummy recipe.  I used Spelt flour, half the sugar and added frozen blueberries which gave it more moisture.

Once a month I have a 'Baking with Stephanie' 1 1/2 hr. in the senior living residence where I work.  This was one of the best ever made. It kept the over ripe bananas from being tossed away plus they were loved by everyone... even those who had a taste and wanted to have a bite more... there was more than enough!!!!  Thank you.

These just came out of the oven a little while ago and my 2 year old daughter and I love them!  I changed the recipe as others had by using 1/2 the amount of oil and using some applesauce.  I baked mine in a mini loaf pan for 20 minutes at 350.  It made 12 loaves.  I will be using this recipe again.

these smell good but I didn't have muffin cups so i greased the muffin tin and they the edges burned  after 15 min.  i'm not a pro muffin maker so maybe there was a trick i should have known about.. but i think these will have a chance to rise more and cook better if they're at a lower temperature for longer... maybe 350 for 20-25 min?

Awesome muffines!  Taking others advice, I also cut the oil in half, using 1/3C canola oil and 1/3C milk.

The recipe was great! I follewed the idea of using applesauce as a replacement for half of the oil and ended up adding more applesauce at the end when the mixture wasn't stirring very well, it worked really well. my recipe made enough for a tin of 12 regular sized muffins and 12 mini-muffins.

I love this recipe and so do my kids.  I use mini-muffin tins to yield 36 mini-muffins.  I simply cut the baking time in half to about 7 minutes.  Great for school lunches.

This is more of a desert with a healthy twist when you cut the oil in 1/2 and add 1/3 cup milk as mentioned in a previous review.  I did 1 1/2 cups wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour.  They were still a little heavy.  Next time will probably do 1 cup white and 1 cup wheat.  All in all, they disappeared!!

These were a HUGE hit at my office. I added a handful of cocunut into the mixture as well sprinkled some of top prior to baking. Next time a may add some walnuts.
A great recipe that you can modify to what you have on hand.

These are amazing! I usually convert the recipe to yield 18 muffins and it makes about two dozen. Also, I use a half cup of oil and a half cup of milk.

These muffins have a great texture and taste!  I only gave them 4 stars because they were so soft they didn't come out of the muffin paper very well.  Other than that... totally perfect!  I will make these again.

Excellent recipe and very flexible. I didn't use the cocoa and prefer whole chocolate chunks rather than chips. Just be careful not to over mix otherwise they are a little dense, otherwise just lovely.

My husband loves this recipe.  I make it healthier by using applesause to replace half the oil.  Also, I use half whole wheat flour and I use baking splenda to cut down on the sugar.

Made it with only 1/2 cup canola oil. My kids loved them but I agree there is too much oil used (boy are they dense) and think it would be better to use the applesauce in place of some of it for next time.

I really liked this recipe.  I have made several different kinds of muffins and this one was great.  They were perfect.  I did use canola oil instead of safflower oil, but they were still very good.  I made them in a stoneware muffin pan and they were cooked to perfection.

Delicious!  I didn’t have the oil so used canola. I added a couple tables spoons milk because my better seemed just a bit too thick. Baked at 350 for 15 minutes. Yummy!

Cooking temp  is much too high. First batch (recipe as written) turned out tough and bland. Made a second batch with peanut butter chips instead & baked at 350 for 20 minutes - significantly better! Not a recipe I’ll save though.

Good texture and taste. A bit too sweet for us. Next time I'm either going to only add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of sugar or use bananas that aren't quite as ripe. But definitely will be making again

Delicious!! I didn’t have sunflower oil so I replaced it with canola. I also added half a cup of applesauce.

A good and quick recipe, but a little dry as is, probably why the people that added applesauce gave it 5 stars and I didn’t.

The flavor is great however I found even 15min to be too long to bake.  I suggest checking on them at 12min and then every two minutes....

I doubled the batch and used coconut sugar instead of white sugar (same quantity as the in the recipe).  The dough seemed kind of dry, but I didn't add anything more. It takes fine. Makes cakey cupcakes.

Followed the directions and ingredients except I used peanut oil instead and baked at 350 for 18 minutes.  Most and delicious.  Like a chocolate covered banana.

Followed others' advice to cut the oil in half and make up the difference with a 1/3 cup milk, but stuck to the recommended oven temperature rather than change that as well. These turned out fantastic! Will definitely make again.

These were really tasty. I didn't have quite enough oil, so I topped it off with milk. The muffins were really good, very moist. The only issue with the recipe is that 1 tbsp of baking soda seems like too much and left a slight chalky aftertaste. I'll try it with half as much of the baking soda.

Unfortunately, these were tasteless and dry. I even added 4 oz of apple sauce for some more moisture. Bummer because I thought these would rock with the cocoa powder...not so much.

These are fantastic! I was a little short on bananas, so I added cinnamon applesauce. I used my trick of preheating the oven to 500 and as soon as the muffins are in, reducing the heat to 400 and baking for 20 minutes. They were perfect!

These are a big hit with my hubby and his co workers! Like others, I made some adjustment- 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup of oil instead of all oil (I just use whatever oil I have on hand). I also bake at 375 for about 18 mins and I use a heaping 1/4 cup of batter for each muffin- I get a dozen perfect muffins. This is my go to muffin recipe!

I made this with 1/3 c veg. Oil and 1/3 c. Milk. Also subbed in 1/3 c. Light agave nectar for the sugar (mix this in with wet ingredients). If using mini choc. Chips I would recommend 1/2-3/4 cups as the chocolate gets overpowering. Baked at 350 degrees convection bake and they came out moist and perfect at 20 minutes! Yum!

I read a few reviews before making this recipe.  I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and used ripened bananas. I finished with a few chips on top. Someone suggested dropping the temperature so I heated the oven at 350, and baked them for 23-25 minutes. Tasted pretty good.

Very tasty, good texture, thanks for the recipe!  I've made the following tweaks:  I substituted 1/3 cup coconut oil and 1/3 cup applesauce for the oil. I reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp and I added 1/4 cup rolled oats. I started with the temperature at 425, but it seemed a bit high, so I reduced it down to 400 after 5 minutes. The toothpick came out clean at 15 minutes, so I took them out then. I have a convection oven, so it tends to cook faster. FYI - 1 1/2 cups of bananas was exactly 3 medium sized bananas. They get sweeter as they ripen, so make sure you wait until they are a little brown before using them.

I used whole wheat flour and that is the only substitution that I made to the ingredients.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  I made 12 regular muffins.  They did not rise very much.  They are flavorful though.

I would definitely make this again - and a friend even asked for the recipe.  I substituted some whole wheat flour for regular flour (about 1/2 a cup).  I also used a mix of brown sugar and white sugar, because I had some left over from another recipe.  Also, we were able to get 17 muffins out of the mix - they might be a little smaller, but they are still a good size.  Baked for about 17 minutes and took it right out to cool.

Amazing. We ate them warm and definitely needed milk to wash down the chocolate goodness. I was skeptical with all that oil but they were perfect.

I liked this recipe to work off of.  I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil, used 1/4 cup less flour, and did half white sugar and half light brown sugar.  I used no cocoa powder, aswell as 2 cups bananas. Mine turned out moist and tasty.  Thank you.

Like the other 1-star review, after I made them I had to check if I had missed something. They did not rise, were tasteless and dry

Easy and tasty recipe. I used 1/3 c canola oil and 1/3 c unsweetened applesauce.  Used 3 medium bananas; next time I will add at least one more because I think the bananas were overpowered by the chocolate flavor. Batter was slightly thick so I added 2 Tbs milk to loosen it up. All in all --- a success!

Delicious.  I used wheat flour & half oil/milk and baked at 350 for 13min (as per reviews) and they are super moist & flavorful.  It made 24 large muffin cups.  Thank you for sharing your recipe. I am always trying new ones.

I baked these muffins for only 15 minutes, and they did come out quite dry.  Perhaps they need more oil?  The taste is good.

These are honestly some of the best muffins I've ever made. I used canola oil because I didn't have sunflower oil. I used slightly less oil than the recipe called for and added some plain greek yogurt to make up the difference. They were excellent! Any time I make muffins, I always bake them at 425 for the first 5 minutes. It gets them to rise really nicely and they get tall and fluffy!

I like to whip up muffins just before the kids come home for lunch.  I used 4 medium bananas,  for oil I used a 50% mix of coconut oil and extra virgin canola oil.  My muffins didn't look anything like the picture since Cocoa certainly makes them look browner.  Muffins are super tasty and moist.  I will make them again for sure.  This recipe made 19 muffins, so I guess I should fill the tins up fuller or something?  I though you should fill them 3/4 full?  Kids liked them.  Didn't go GOO GOO over them, but they are good.

Yummy and easy to make. I like the fact that you don't need an electric mixer, and really only use 2 bowls. A quick way to whip up delicious fresh muffins.

Great recipe! I followed exactly other than substituting vegetable oil for sunflower seed oil. Moist, not overly banana tasting, even sprinkled a few chocolate chips on each muffin before baking. Wonderful way to use up overripe bananas!

Fabulous recipe! I don't generally have sunflower oil around so I've subbed olive oil....  What a delicious muffin!  there is more than enough chocolate flavour without the chips... So if you were looking to cut calories, it's still worth trying this recipe out as a banana muffin

I was disappointed. I thought these would be flavorful and they ended up being tasteless and bitter, I could almost taste the baking powder. Allrecipes is my go-to cookbook and this is the first recipe I have reviewed because I believe it's rating is very wrong. That being said, I did use vegtable oil rather than sunflower oil so maybe they would have turned out much better.  Maybe less baking powder would help.  I wish I could say I am enjoying these after making them but that is not the case.

Recipe was very easy and quick.  I made 6 instead of 12 muffins, I used 1 egg instead trying to measure 1/2 egg.  And I used very ripe bananas.  I used 1/2 c spelt flour and 1/2 call purpose flour.  It smelled great and tasted very rich.

This recipe is pretty easy and with some changes needed to ehance flavor n texture they came come out soooo good, Very MOIST n FLAVORFUL!  Changes are by using:  1 1/2 C flour only, 1/2 C Old fashioned Oats grinded almost finely, increased sugar and used 2/3 C brown sugar instead of white sugar , i also added 1/4 C sour cream (or u can use yogurt if u wish)  2tsp vanilla extract, and for more moisture as this recipe needs it per other reviews I added 1/2 C milk of choice( I used soy milk).  Kept all other ingredients the same. And make sure your bananas are "Very Ripe" (which means specks of dark spots on banana skin the darker skin the better) it makes such a difference in the flavor, and them being moist. Sprinkle a tiny bit of sugar on top b4 baking.  I baked at 350 for 20 min exactly instead of 425 its too high thats also why other reviews cane out dry muffins.. Let me tell u they were the best muffin I've made!. I couldn't stop eating them! Gotta try it this way. Promise u won't eat just 1.

Yummy! I used King Arthur white whole wheat flour, Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, and subbed canola oil for sunflower. The batter seemed a bit dense so I added a splash of almond milk. Baked at 375 for a total of about 23 min. I wanted to add a little something so after they cooled a bit I dipped the tops in a cream cheese/powdered sugar glaze and sprinkled with toasted coconut. The texture of the muffin was perfect. Will definitely make these again.

These muffins are amazing!  Light & moist, and I love how they rise unlike other muffin recipes that are flat and more dense.  After reading other reviews I did bake at 350 for approx 20 min; also added 1/2 cup light sour cream + 2 tblsp milk because my batter was very thick.  The muffins turned out perfect.  I also added 1/4 cup cinnamon chips along with the chocolate chips and allspice to the batter.  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing!

These are wonderful...I did make a few changes. I used 1 3/4 c. of flour and 1/4 cup of dark cocoa. 2 c of banana (was all I had) and 1/3 c oil (canola) and 1/3 cup if sour cream.They could use a little more sugar (5 yr old granddaughter was helping I am thinking she only put 1/4 cup in) BUT OMG these are wonderful, moist and finger licking!! lol I also like others baked at 350.

Extremely good! I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 milk instead of all oil and I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Also added 2 extra tablespoons of sugar! I baked them for 18 minutes,but at 350*,not the 425! They rose beautifully and were extremely moist! So glad I found this recipe! Thank you! And when I doubled it, I got 32 large muffins!

I used coconut oil in this recipe. They are yummy. I love the flavor that the cocoa powder adds. These are a hit In my home.

I do not see how people were getting dry banana (reading some of the reviews) remember its 1 1/2 cups mashed banana, not 1 1/2 cup banana then mash, and use riper banana, nice soft bananas right before they turn brown inside, after the pealing have gone past all yellow.  I used four large ripe bananas and mine came out great!  I did bake it at only 400, I would even go down to 375 not the 425.  They are fantastic though!

Just made this for the first time! I used one large banana, substituted applesauce for the oil, and did half whole wheat flour. So amazing! I also used a six count oversized muffin tin and it took only 18 minutes to cook. This is definitely a favorite!!!

I didn't have sunflower oil so I melted coconut oil being careful not to make it hot.
I also had four bananas which got me about 1 1/3 cups of mashed bananas so I added a half cup of apple sauce to top it up. 
I was tempted to substitute the granulated white sugar for organic coconut palm sugar but figured I shouldn't mess with the original recipe too much the first time.
I baked them at 375F for 20mins. 
They turned out fantastic! Next time I will try the palm sugar.

The muffins were okay. Not as moist as I'd like, but we still enjoyed them. I made this recipe instead of my go to because I was out of a key ingredient. I don't think I'd make them again.

MY MUFFINS LOOK JUST LIKE THE PICTURE!!!  I may start letting bananas go overripe on purpose just to enjoy more of these bad boys. The only change I made was to use vegetable oil in place of sesame oil. My neighbor's small boys were here when the first dozen came out of the oven and I immediately got rave reviews! I was worried while putting the batter in the muffin papers because the batter looked so oily but the muffins are so incredibly moist, and were perfectly cooked at 20 minutes. I doubled the recipe exactly but got two and a half dozen muffins, filling the muffin papers 2/3 full... BONUS!

For anyone who hasn't made it, prep time was about 10-15 minutes, then the bake time (as listed above) was15-20 minutes. It will overall take no longer than about 35 minutes

I ate 3 as soon as they came out of the oven! (Don't judge me, I'm pregnant!) They were to die for! I halved the oil and substituted milk like someone else suggested. I also cut dark chocolate into small chunks as I can't get chocolate chips here (Crazy, I know!). But it turned out amazing as I had big pieces of melt in your mouth chocolate chunks in the muffin. No doubt I'll be making these again!

Made it with 2 cups whole wheat flour, used 1/3 cup canola oil, 1/3 cup milk. Decided it was too dry and added 1/4 cup more milk. I also added a tablespoon of chocolate syrup. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also baked them at 350 degrees for 18 minutes. The batch made 18 instead of 12.  My family inhaled them!

Awesome! I added 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt because the batter was a little dry. I also used 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup semi-sweet along with 1/2 cup of walnuts. Mmmmm. Tried to put a pic up but it wouldn't let me :( Oh and I also baked them at 350!

Good muffin, I've tried a few other banana chip recipes and this was the best yet.  I do think it needs a bit more moisture so next time instead of doing half the oil and adding applesauce I would do all the oil and still add 1/3 cup applesauce.   Other then that a yummy recipe!

As many have had problems with the dryness of the muffin, I split the 2/3 cup of oil with 1/3 cup of mayonnaise. I found that the muffins are perfect, and I too baked them at 350 F for 25 mins.

I thought this recipe was great, and I'm not very good in the kitchen. Substituted with whole wheat flour and baked perfectly in 15 min.  Of course it never hurts to be a little more generous with the chocolate chips.

Cut down on the oil as per other reviews and baked at 375 instead of 400 and I was even short 1/2 the vanilla and they were still great.  Kids and husband loved them, thanks for the recipe.  Will make these again!

I think that these muffins are a great way to use up left over bananas!  Next time I will cover my chocolate chips with flour before adding to the mixture so that they dont fall to the bottom of the muffins.  I also set the heat in my over for 420, but had to cook them longer, so will use orginal heating and baking insturctions next time!  Might try to half the oil and use applesauce too!  Great recipe thank you!

I had a lot of overripe bananas to use today so when I found this recipe I decided to try it. I didn't have sunflower seed oil, so used canola oil in its place. I used all the recommended ingredients as stated in the recipe.   Having noticed that many previous commenters mentioned the given temperature was too high, I baked mine at 350 for 25 minutes. They came out moist and tender. They have a wonderful blend of banana and chocolate flavor and my kids all raved about them. I like them too, and look forward to having one tomorrow. I have 2 more bananas to use still and I will make more of these so I can freeze them, if they'll stick around long enough to do so!

Moist and yummy! Perfect for a snack during the day! I used 1/3 c. oil and 1/3 c. applesauce, WW pastry flour, about 3/4 c. walnuts, and an additional T. of cocoa. Frozen bananas -thawed- worked well (saved from the last time our bananas were going brown). I also baked them at 350 for about 20 min. It made more than I expected, so we made a dozen regular sized and 8 mini muffins.  Excellent!

I tried this recipe to bring to Thanksgiving dinner.  It turned out well.  I did not have the sunflower oil, but the vegetable oil worked out fine. Everyone enjoyed the muffins.  I was able to make more than the recipe stated.  I got 17 muffins from the batter.  I do agree with one of the reviewers, that the baking temperature did not have to be set at 425 degrees. Mine browned a little quickly.

I'm new to baking.  I took advice from other reviewers and substitued apple sauce for some of the oil, added cinnamon and ginger, and substituted 1/2 cup oats for part of the flour.  But I forgot the  vanila.  Still good, though.

made this thinking the kids would love it as they love banana bread and chocolate chip muffins.  The reaction I got was not as expected.  They just didn't care for them at all.  They were not as moist and flavorful to me either.

This is my first review on this site. I made these muffins exactly as the recipe states except I did not have sunflower oil so I used veg oil instead. I baked for 15 minutes. They were soooo moist and yummy! My hubby, youngest son, and I really enjoyed them and ate too many. Will def make these again. I did find them a tad bit salty and wondered if it was due to the Tablespoon of baking powder.

My boyfriend would probably give these at least 4 stars, he seemed to love them.  I thought they were good, but not great.  They were not as light as I would hope for them to be.  I took others advice and instead of just oil, I cut oil in 1/2 and used milk for the other 1/2.  Might try again.

I made these and thought they turned out very well. I would consider them more of a dessert muffin, because they are rather dense and full of chocolate. Will probably make these again! Good recipe.

My family loved these muffins.. I made them in mini tins.. and baked at 350 (instead of 425).  Next time I will use a little less choc chips or maybe mini chips..

It could be my oven but I think the temperature was too hot for 15 mins. My muffins came out rather dark. Perhaps next time I will try 180 degrees celcius and check them at 12 mins. I was concerned it was a tad too much oil but they came out moist with good texture. It's a great way to use up those sad looking 'nanas!

I used spelt flour as we have a wheat intolerance in our family.  The muffins were very tasty although a little bit too sweet for my tastes.

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except for instead of sunflower oil I used coconut oil. Unfortunately, this recipe is not a hit with me. It is good (and most chocolate-y things are) but the texture was completely off. It didn't feel like a muffin because it was way too dense. Also, I think it could use some extra flavors as it was a bit dull. I will experiment more next time. Still, it was yummy! With the right alterations I'm sure it would be perfect.

Pretty good for chocolate lovers. I found the chocolate a little overpowering the banana flavor... I varied a few things here and there, and it still came out pretty yummy

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and made the following changes: Half white, half whole wheat flour, half brown sugar, half white sugar, extra 1/2 cup of sugar, about six bananas total, flax seed and water instead of eggs, and one teaspoon cinnamon.  I also baked at 350 degrees for approximately 20 minutes.  (Definitely recommend changing the oven temperature listed!)  Doubling this recipe yielded two dozen large muffins and two dozen mini muffins.

These muffins were good...I added some extra chocolate chips to the tops of them before I put them in the oven.  That was a little too much cholcolate, we ended up picking them off.  I wouldn't do that the next time that I make them.  My partner was having a "boys night" out at a friends house...so I sent a container full of these muffins with him (as I had made a double batch).  He came home with an empty container and rave reviews...they even liked the chipits on top!  Not too chocolatey for them I guess!
