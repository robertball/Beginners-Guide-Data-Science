This is so delicious! My modifications - I used 4 cups of broth, added a clove of garlic, and subbed the nutmeg with cinnamon.

For my tastes, the seasonings needed some help. It was a rather sweet soup with the squash apple carrots and sweet potato. I added some chipotle and lots of salt and pepper.  One thing that I found was really off was the amount of broth. 2 cups was not nearly enough.. I used 4 plus some water and it still was a very thick soup. Buy at least one paper carton of vegetable broth when you make this... if not more

okay I'm one of those- I changed the recipe. But holy  this was good with very very small modifications. The only thing I did different was use homemade chicken broth and curry as suggested. Others are right though, the broth isn't enough so I also added milk for creaminess. It is not only phenomenal, but EASY. 10/10

used 4 cups of broth, 2 cups water, pureed veggies after adding 4 cups of broth in the pot.  It is impossible to puree the veggies before hand in the blender, requires more liquid to do this

Awesome awesome awesome! Same as some of the most amazing squash soups I've had at the restaurant without all the cream!! I love that!! Only thing I would do differently is DOUBLE THE SPICES. Seems to have lots of flavour when it's first made, but calms down the 2nd day too much. I love the spices flavour and want to keep them right through.

This soup is fabulous! I served at a luncheon & it was a big hit! I used more spices which gave it a kick to offset sweetness. Will definitely make again. And I made 2 days ahead & it was perfect.
