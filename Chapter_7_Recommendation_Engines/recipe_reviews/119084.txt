I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, made the dough in my bread machine but baked them in 2, 9-inch cake pans so they would come out soft.  They were absolutely delicious with a soft texture and wonderful taste.  We prefer the taste of whole grains so love love love them!  Thanks for sharing!

These are tasty and easy to make.  I had some buttermilk that needed using, and I wanted to make some wheat rolls so this was the perfect recipe!  I used oat bran instead of wheat germ, just because I'm out of wheat germ.  I made these by hand, so I warmed the buttermilk and 1 TBS sugar in the microwave until it reached 115 degrees.  Then I proofed the yeast in that mixture for 10 minutes, then proceeded with the recipe.  I added more whole wheat flour and used less than 1 cup of white.  I also added 1 TBS wheat gluten.  These rose well and turned out very soft.  Had these with Broccoli and Cheddar Soup for dinner and made some Honey Butter to go with them.  Yummy.

Used oat bran instead of wheat germ (didn't have any).  Made by hand rather than using bread machine.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Delicious!

I needed a recipe that used wheat flour (as my husband does not want to eat any white flour products and I wanted to used my bread maker).  This recipe was good - but not as good as white flout rolls.

For Thanksgiving this year I had excellent results with this recipe.  I had to alter it slightly because of recommendations for my bread machine.  I increased the bread flour by 1/2 c. and decreased the whole wheat accordingly.  I made it as a braid, let it rise in the refrigerator in a covered 9X13 cake pan overnight, and convection baked it 25 minutes - straight from the fridge.  My husband especially loved it.  I'll be making this frequently.

I followed the recipe, no changes. They were ok. Kids didnt like them but they like white bread. My husband and I only eat wheat. They were ok but nothing special. I still havent found THE wheat roll recipe.

Very yummy!  I only had powdered buttermilk (cultured butermilk blend for cooking and baking), but it turned out great!  I used one 13 x 9 baking pan instead of the cookie sheets and brushed with butter after rising.  Hubby loved them too!

These were easy to make and soft as advertised.  We used them to make mini-meatball sandwiches and they were yummy.  If I make these to eat alone, I will substitute 1/3 c. honey for the sugar.

I substituted olive oil for the canola and rice milk buttermilk (made with rice milk and lemon juice) for the dairy buttermilk. 

Thanks for sharing!

I made the rolls bigger than directed, so that may account for some of my difficult.  However, I found that dough a little wet and a little slow to rise.  It did not bake as pretty as I had hoped.

I didn't care for the flavor of these rolls.  They were soft and fluffy, but had a weird taste.  I won't be making these again.
