I didn't think you could get much better than just plain ranch dip.  Boy was I wrong!  My mother-in-law was looking for a similar recipie and we came across this and gave it a try.  It was excelent!  We used a jar of real bacon bits and it came out perfect.  I will make this again!

This is the best dip I have ever had.  I made it for my bunco group and they just loved it. There was so much that I  brought the extra to work the next day.  It was a hit twice.  Excellent!!

This is incredible. I used the real bacon peices that come in the pouch and saved myself from measuring by using a 16 oz. bottle of dressing and an 8 ounce container of sour cream. Its even better the next day and even the pickiest of eaters loved it and asked for the recipe!

Much better than the typical ranch dip.  Served with veggies and was a hit at the party!

I made this for a Christmas Eve party last year and all the guests raved about it. I personally thought it was just so-so. I would substitute real bacon for the bacon bits next time.

This was very easy and very good.  It had a tangy taste to it.  I served it with potato chips at a potluck, but it tasted even better on the loaded potato skins somebody brought.  Too easy!

This was just OK.  I made it to go with beer bread and I needed to spice it up a bit with some onion, garlic, and pepper.  Even then it had the taste and consistency of salad dressing.  I probably won't make again.

The recipe was O.K. It was very TWANGY and did not taste nearly as well as expected. I think next time I'll try a bacon dip without the ranch.
