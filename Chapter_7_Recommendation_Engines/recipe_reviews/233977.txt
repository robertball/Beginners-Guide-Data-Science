I liked this a lot. I did sub cheddar for the Chihuahua cheese since it is what I had in the house. I'll be making this one again.

The Chihuaua cheese was optional so I used Mozz instead and also used season salt in place of regular salt. Great recipe and one that would be a great side dish for many different things!

My family loved this.  We used all the butter, added a little garlic but no other changes.  Daughter wanted leftovers for her lunch salad.  Will make again and will probably add a red pepper for color

This was OK. My Mexican hubby gave it a 60% compared to his Moms. She has passed away and I can't ask her for the other 40%:( I think I did something wrong, since I added the buttermilk and it separated, was that supposed to happen? HHMM. I'm sorry Muy Bueno
