Some of the directions seem to be missing.....

When browning the onions, make sure the onions are a deep brownish/red color before adding the spices.  They should not be white. Also, once you add the tomatoes, let some of the liquid evaporate and cook until the oil separates from the tomaotes before going to the next step.  You will see the tomatoes thicken up a bit. 

miglenova:  There is NO curry powder in this recipe.  Most Indian curries do NOT use curry powder.

I made several substitutions.  I used a Tbsp of garam masala and substituted a Tbsp of a good curry powder for the other spices.  Instead of yogurt I used coconut milk as others suggested.  I didn't have the lemon or tomato juice (substituted a can of tomato sauce.  I always prefer more vegetables so I added chopped carrot, bell pepper and two jalapenos at the same time as the potato and for the last 10 minutes some frozen peas that I had on hand.  Many vegetables would go well in this dish. I also added a chicken bouillon cube to the water.  Salt was a must add!  Awesome recipe!  Everyone was begging for more and for thee recipe.

If you're looking a traditional INDIAN curry, then this is it. If, however, you are looking for a RED curry, then I suggest you try a THAI curry. The point of this curry is not the heat but the flavour.

As I was anxious to start this (and hungry) I put the lemon juice, salt and pepper into the pan with the chicken (I used chicken thighs). I also substituted low fat creme fraiche instead of the yoghurt and did not add water as we like a thick curry. This curry was delicious! Better than some I have had in Indian restaurants. This has been saved to my recipe box and will be used many, many times in the future!!

I was a little disappointed. I am a huge fan of curries, and this one seemed lackluster in flavor. It wasn't bad at all, but I think I should have doubled the spices, and might prefer coconut milk over yogurt. I might try it again with those changes, but not like this!

This was excellent. If you love indian food try this. I added some chopped spinach and substituted sour cream for the yogurt and served over basmati rice.

I would DEFINITELY make this recipe again.  It was superb; in fact, it was even better after it sat in the fridge a couple of days to let the flavors mingle.  YUM!  My hubby requested that I tinker to make it spicy, but I really enjoyed it.

I was nervous about the long list of ingredients, but now that I have made it so many times, I wouldn't change a thing.  This is a great curry that you can easily adjust the "heat" to your own preference.  About half way through, I divide the curry and make one very hot for myself, and the other I leave mild for my husband.

This was good, but not great. Another reviewer was really on point when saying this is closer to tasting like chicken chili. The only real change I made was adding a few veggies - zucchini, bell pepper, and carrots (all added after sweating the onions). Although I enjoyed it, it certainly wasn't what I was looking for in an Indian Curry. BTW, I waited to add the yogurt until near the end - as I've seen recommended by other reviewers and in recipes - but it curdled anyhow. Will definitely use coconut milk the next time I make a curry.

This dish smelled delicious!  However, I was a little disappointed with the end result - not sure why. I wont be making this again, but it was very fun to make a traditional chicken curry dish!

With a little tweaking this recipe could be super delicious.  Since it was my first time making it I followed the directions.  Next time though I will probably make it a a lot spicier.  Also, this makes a LOT more than 6 servings.

I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted more like a chicken chili. My 3 best friends are Indian, so I have had a lot of authentic Indian chicken curries. They all taste different, but this is not even close.

This is excellent as a starting base - don't be afraid to try substitutions though.  While it might not be authentic, this tastes great with about 2-3 tbsp of yellow curry, a handful of yellow raisins, and coconut milk instead of the yogurt.

Great flavor! The only thing I did differently was use boneless/skinless chicken thighs and a couple more garlic cloves. I also left the cover off the saucepan for a while to let some of the liquid cook off (it seemed a bit watery for my liking)I will definatley make this one again! I think next time I might add some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.

Simply delicious - a great recipe for Indian food lovers that won't burn a hole in your mouth.  My one "complaint" is that calling this a "curry" recipe without actually having curry in it is misleading.  Cumin and turmeric are in the curry family, but they aren't curry.  I shared this recipe with a friend of mine who doesn't care for curry and she wouldn't cook it because of the name - but I convinced her otherwise luckily.  Otherwise, this is super yummy and will please your hubby too!

I didn't follow the recipie exactly, didn't have a couple of the spices and a few of the ingredients, so I winged it a bit, but it turned out very nice.

This recipe was spectacular. i made one and a half of the recipe and doubled up on aromatics and spices. i used skinless drumsticks as i'm not a big fan of chicken breast. i also used unsalted chicken broth instead of water,  because i needed to use it up, besides, why use water when you can use broth! LOL i served it with basmati rice and naan. will definitely make this again and again!

I've tried this recipe twice so far and really enjoy it.  Although I didn't follow the tips of the previous reviewer, I will keep them in mind when making it again.
