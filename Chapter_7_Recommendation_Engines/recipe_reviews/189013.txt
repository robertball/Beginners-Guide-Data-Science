I substituted Rotel Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilies for the picante sauce and added Slap Ya Mama Cajun Seasoning (Louisiana) for the seasoned salt. In addition, I drained & rinsed the shrimp prior to adding. Super good!

WOW - what a surprise...very tangy, nice bite (albeit mild) and great texture.  From the discriminating chef to the frozen meal gourmet, all my guests loved it making it one of few universal crowd pleasers in my recipe collection.  I made no alterations and prepared the dip exactly as described in the recipe...can't think of anything I would have changed.   BTW, photo doesn't due it justice.  Mine came out a pale green and not the strange brown color in the picture.
