While I did make a couple of changes, I'm sure that as is, these cookies are wonderful.  First, I changed the recipe to make 24 cookies.  Then I added about 2 T of softened/melted peanut butter as the last ingredient while omitting the raisins.  I thought the batter was to die for, but then I tried a cookie.  It was fluffy and moist on the inside.  Perfect in my book! They remind me of my childhood fav- no bake cookies.  So I guess these are Bake, No-bake cookies.

Wow I love the cookies. They are better when you make them atleast a inch wide, because they are bigger. They don't cook as much and are doughier!

Delicious!  I went with the chocolate chips.  My husband said "the bites with lots lof chocolate chips are the best."  I thought they were great because they left me delighted with the cookie I had, not needing more, but I wouldn't have complained if I had to eat more.  They're fantastic!

I put in chocolate chips - which it definitely needed.  Also, I made this with whole wheat flour.  Overall, the greatest appeal of this recipe was that I had all the ingredients already.  Pretty tastey, but not a 5-star dessert :-)

Thanks for the easy cookie recipe!

These cookies are pretty good, but slightly tasteless (it might be because i didnt use the cocoa??) I would recommend using CINAMIN, it gives them true taste and dont add cocoa if you're adding cinamin!! *it'll be a clash*

These are really good.  I found they only needed to bake for 8 1/2 minutes to get the perfect texture.  I omitted the raisins and added 2 bars of chopped white chocolate (Swiss and German) ;) ).  They are so good this way.  Pretty easy to make too, even though I had to wear my 23-pound baby on my back in the baby backpack the whole time I made these.  ;)

I was looking for something to make with my 3 year old twin girls. I went through the cupboard to see what I had to work with and stumbled upon this receipe. I only had 1 c of fast cooking oats and used 2 cups of coconut. My husband and children enjoyed them. I did have to cook them for 14 min's with the adjustments I made as 12 min's made them more cakelike.

I thought these cookies were by far the best I have personally ever made! I make pretty ok cookies -  but I added choc chips in these and they came out in perfect circles, and stayed moist for 3 days! Very chewy and flavorful. Although I only had 1 1/2 c left of oatmeal, they came out perfect!!

We love these!  I used 1 c demerera sugar instead of the white and brown, used wheat pastry flour, and subbed choc chips for the raisins.  The oats give them a great texture - the chocolate makes them fabulous.

Easy recipe, and a good base to change up the added items. Batter was easy to mix and came together nicley. I opted out on the raisins and added chopped dried cranberries and some white chocolate chips! Took 11 and 1/2 minutes in my oven. Smell amazing. Quite a chewy cookie, good dunkers. Taste like a cooked haystack. Yummy!!! Added to my recipe box and will make again!

So moist, and the taste is awesome too! I used a little more cocoa than necessary (oh, you bad chocoholic, you!) and it was just sweet enough. It's easy to make and keep a dry mix for this; all dry ingredients except sugar mixed together, and then a separate bag for the sugar. Then you can make it anytime!

Quick, easy and tasty child-friendly recipe. Easy to follow with minimal mess/cleanup. Only modifications I made was to substitute the raisins for semi-sweet chocolate chips and to add an upside-down bittersweet chocolate hershey's kiss to the centre. (The chocolate in the centre was esthetically pleasing and added a nice surprise when you bit into them).  I made the cookies slightly larger and increased the cooking time slightly to 13 minutes.  Ended up nicely moist in the centre with a slight crunch to the outside.  Found them a bit sweet (even the bites without chocolate), so next time I would cut back the sugar. All around a yummy cookie.

I added about 1 cup of chopped almonds, about 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, dried blueberries, dried cherries, and raisins to make about 1 cup (instead of just raisins), and substituted half of the butter with applesauce.  Baked for about 13-14 minutes, the cookies came out slightly cakey, moist, hearty, and DELICIOUS!

This is a great base recipe!  For those of you who are looking for a healthy alternative version, I made the following substitutions:  1.) 1 cup applesauce instead of 1 cup butter 2.) left out the white sugar 3.) 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour instead of regular flour 4.) and I also added 1 cup of shredded zucchini to the batter along with the oats  Obviously the end result is very different from what you would get with the original recipe, but it's a perfect healthy snack to send with the kids in their lunchboxes!    My kids loved it and never guessed that there was zucchini in there!

I made these cookies with walnuts instead of raisins which made them more palatable. They remained firm when I removed them from the cookie tray which makes for a better cookie all around.

heavenly, added 4 heaping tablespoons peanut butter and didn't make any additions (no raisins, chips, etc) . wonderful recipe, smells delish baking. i baked mine at 350 for exactly 10 minutes on parchment and they are the wonderful combo between a crisp outside and lovely soft interior. the batter was quite soft (although my house is quite warm today) so i refridgerated 10 mins before and kept batter in fridge while they baked. didn't spread at all. YUM!

I'm a 30 year old guy and very new to baking, in fact these are the first cookies I've ever made from scratch as an adult. They're awesome. I halved the recipe and made a few additions; a 1/4 cup mini-chocolate chips and a heaping 1/4 cup of Reese's peanut butter chips. Because of these cookies my girlfriend (and her friends at work) regard me as perhaps one of the best boyfriends ever.

These are fabulous! I just made these but with a few changes. To make them healthier, I omitted the butter and added applesauce. Also, instead of cranberries I added a cup of a combination of mini chocolate morsels, cranberries, and walnuts. They turned out great! Thanks for the recipe :)

Really delicious cookies. I tripled the batch and froze 2/3's of it. Also I added walnuts and used Dark Cocoa. The cookies came out better when I made them bigger. Just soft enough. This is a keeper recipe. YUM!

Loved this cookie. The only change I made was to leave out the raisins.  I plan to make then again and reduce the soda or salt.  They did have a bit of a salty aftertaste but not enough to keep me from eating them....

I have made these twice now and absolutely love them.  They are soft, but also have some texture from the oatmeal.  Perfect combination.  I skip the raisins (only because I don't like raisins).  This recipe has a place in my recipe book!

I just made these and I really like them. I didn't have any raisins and I was worried that they weren't going to be sweet enough, but I actually like the fact that they are not overwhelmingly sweet. Just perfect! I also cooked them a little longer because I made them big and I like them crunchy better!

These were so good! Easy! My 11 yr old baked them herself! I like that it's still an oatmeal cookie n the cocoa isn't over powering just a subtle touch. If you like more cocoa it wouldn't hurt to add more. But I love it as written without raisins. Choco chips would be great in this :)

Yummy!  Hubby had a cookie craving and was about to dash off to the store to buy some when I suggested making some at home instead.  We had all the ingredients on hand for this recipe, though we decided to forgo the raisins.  I might try doubling the cocoa powder next time and/or adding chocolate chips.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

These were very good. I love coconut, so used (only) two cups quick oats and added one cup sweetened coconut that I had on hand. Also substituted chocolate chips for the raisins. These two additions made the cookie much sweeter that it would have been, but that's how I like 'em. Sort of like a chocolate haystack, but because of the oats, you can pretend these are good for you.

These are very good as is! I didn't have raisins so I added the chocolate chips. They didn't seem to flatten too much while baking so I helped that along by gently pressing them down with a damp fork. 8 minutes seemed to be the perfect time for baking with my oven. They are slightly crisp on the outside but still soft on the inside. Very easy and tasty!

Great, healthy-ish cookie. Really yummy! Halved the recipe to make 2 dozen and added about 1T peanut butter and chocolate chips instead of raisins to make it extra yummy!

I didnt have any vanilla on hand either so i used 1 tbs of mint syrup, not knowing if it would turn out but it did, you dont realy taste the mint, and i increased the cocoa powder to half a cup, im a chocolate nut (hehe no pun intended) My familys new favorite THANKS!!!

I love cocoa and I love oatmeal, and these were a good, not-very-sweet cookie (the taste was a bit more like a biscotti, according to my husband). I'll enjoy them with coffee in the late morning or afternoon, but when I want something sweet or buttery, I won't reach for this recipe.

Quick and easy, yes, but very bland.  They are not sweet at all.  I even tried sprinkling with powdered sugar after cooking to try to perk them up, but they are really pretty tasteless and not worth wasting any calories on.  I don't think I will be making these again.

Wonderful cookie!  The cocoa was just light enough without being overpowering, though I may double the cocoa next time for a richer chocolate flavor.  The only thing I didn't use were raisins, substituted walnuts instead.  Thanks for such a yummy cookie!

I wanted a lower cal cookie, I used this recipie but subbed Splenda baking blend for the sugar.  I used both the brown & white blend. *Make sure you use conversion chart when using Splenda Baking blend* I used 3 egg whites, instead of 2 whole eggs. Turned  out well.  I made the cookies larger to mimic the Quaker Breakfast Cookies.

Really good! I subbed 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips for the raisins, as the folks I'm making these for aren't fans of raisins in cookies.   I might try adding a bit more cocoa powder next time, but still these are very good.  If you overbake, they will dry out a bit - 12 minutes was perfect for heaping tablespoonfuls of dough.

These cookies are great! I'd suggest, pouring boiling water over your raisins and letting them sit for a few before using in any recipe. This way they don't absorb all the moisture and make it dry.

These turned out great! I am not a fan of raisins so I replaced them with chopped walnuts. I did another batch with the walnuts and white chocolate chips. Everyone loved them. Thanks for the recipe. My husband will insist that i make these again.

Great recipe in general, but needs minor adjustments. As it is it's too sweet, so minus the 100g of sugar extra, should be ok. It's a little dry with so much oatmeal, 375g was enough for me. Otherwise everything else was perfect and the batter was succulent. Thanks a lot for posting it!!!!

Made these with mint M&M's mixed in... YUMMY!  Also was out of butter, so used butter flavored shortening in it's place with a spash of water.

Yumm! These are addictive and so filling! I sprinkled some white sugar on top a few of the cookies before baking for a different texture.

This is my new favorite cookie.  The only thing I left out was the raisins.  They are soft, awesome and got rave reviews at the office.  They were super easy to make and in my oven I had to cook a little bit longer, but they were still perfect.

Perfect recipe, although I personally prefer to leave out the raisins.  Also, I always refrigerate cookie dough for about an hour before dropping onto the cookie sheet and baking; it helps the butter to stiffen, and the cookies don't go flat.  I have not tried this recipe without refrigerating the dough first.

These were fantastic, because they're easy to make and it's very easy to eat one at a time. They're pretty filling, and the calorie count isn't too obscene. What I did was I split the batter into two after adding the dry ingredients, and only added the cocoa to one half....the other half I added about 1/3 c of crunchy peanut butter and a little cinnamon, and they turned out terrific! Amazing. I added some chocolate chips to the chocolate ones, and they were very chocolately. A little powdered sugar on top and they were good to go! I also needed to add a little bit more oats to both, for a heavier consistency. So overall this is an outstanding recipe to add on to and play with.

I made these cookies for our youth bake sale and they are amazing! I added cranberries instead of raisins because I thought they would go better with the season and everyone just raved. When you're looking for something out of the ordinary this is it!

I have to admit we've NEVER had luck making cookies at our house so I was willing to try another recipe.  This recipe was EASY to make and VERY yummy!!!  Even my husband, who's not too fond of oatmeal cookies liked them -- he ate at least 5 of the first batch that came out.  CHANGES I MADE TO THE RECIPE:  I replaced the the raisins with 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips + 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips + 1/2 cup shredded coconut.  If you follow the directions precisely, including the 1 min cool on the sheet then to the wire rack they come out great (even with the changes I made).  Thanks for this recipe...it is definitely a KEEPER!  =)

I froze the leftover cookie dough and baked them this evening.....just as yummy as ever!  I baked them for 1-2 minutes longer than normal since they were frozen.  They came out perfect -- slight crunch on the outside and chewy on the inside!

Delicious cookies. I followed the directions, but used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose. I also left out the raisins. They are moist and very yummy and easy to make because everything was on hand!

These cookies weren't bad, but they just weren't good.  I made these at the same time I made Beth's Spicy Oatmeal Cookies (the recipes are nearly identical) and the Spicy ones were much tastier.  I will keep trying to find a richer chocolate oatmeal cookie.

Fantastic! Made a huge batch of mixture the oats were just the right amount so they weren't chewy. I ended up with a fantastic, slightly crunchy, slightly chewy, perfect cookie. Added half a cup of raisens (instead of full cup, thought it would balance the amount of sweetness as I didn't want it to be too sweet) and a cup of pecans. The pecans totally made it. Thanks for the recipe!

I think this is an awesome cookie recipe. I took another reviewer's advice and added some peanut butter at the end with the oats. I skipped the raisins. In addition, I had some patriotic marshmallows left over so when the cooking time was about 2-3 minutes out, I took the cookies out, plopped a star marshmallow on top and put back in oven to get slightly melty. The taste was heavenly and the gooey marshmallow put it over the top!

I added cinnamon and thought they were quite good. Adding another mix-in might make them outstanding, like dried blueberries or cherries or chocolate chips or peanut butter chips or something.

These cookies are delicious!  I didn't have vanilla or raisins on hand and they were still amazing!  I took them out at exactly 10 minutes and they were ready a minute later.  They dough is really soft but I guess that's how it's supposed to be since they turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Added 4 tbs peanut butter instead of the raisins and used 1/2C cocoa powder.
Batter was a little dry (small eggs?), so I added 2tbs Crisco (good for a softer cookie). Portioned for 30 cookies, came out great! Not to sweet, brownie-like texture. Next time I'll add some shredded coconut. 
The brand of cocoa powder will make a big difference in chocolate intensity. I like Ghirardelli for that extra chocolate kick...

I really enjoyed these. Used craisins instead of raisins. I think a person could add whatever tempted their palate to make the flavor more complex but I liked them just the way they were. Good texture, filling and a nice chewy consistency from the oatmeal. This is NOT a super sweet cookie if that's what you are looking for.

Followed the recipe exactly...awesome! I actually think adding chocolate chips would be too much chocolate. (Although if that's what you're going for...:) )

Cocoa Oatmeal Cookies' Haiku: "Tasted great when hot. Not my favorite when cooled off. Doubt I'd make again." My first batch looked kind of dogdoo-ish as they don't spread, so I squashed the rest flat with the bottom of a glass wrapped in wax paper to make them a little more visually appealing. I followed the recipe exactly, but ran out of raisins, so it was more like 75/25 raisins to mini chocolate chips, which was, in my opinion, the best part of the cookies. (The melty chocolate chip bites, that is.) Loved them right out of the oven, several hours later, not so much.

Great recipe!  I used the 2 tbsp peanut butter someone recommended instead of raisins, but it definitely needs a little something every now and then.  Choc chips, nuts, or raisins are all mine needed - too bad I was out!!  Thanks for sharing - we'll make this again and again!

These are sooooo good.  I made them several times exactly as the recipe calls for, then randomly added chocolate chips one run through.  No matter what you do to them, these are delicious, and so simple.  A nice twist to my favorite, the oatmeal raisin cookie, and perfect when you're looking for something chocolatey but not overpowering.  I, and the people I work with, and my family, thank you!

Very good and easy to make with little helpers! I used both choc chips and raisins, so they turned out chunky. Will be made again and again.

These cookies came out really good.  I made a huge mistake by putting the dough on parchment paper, then they started to burn in the oven...oops.  Then  realized to put them on regular baking sheets- what a difference. I made a couple of revisions: I substituted regular flour for whole wheat flour, and since I didn't have any cocoa powder, I used instant coffee instead. I omitted the raisins too.  Delicious! Nice and moist.

These were not bad.  I had to use almond extract instead of vanilla, also I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I cooked them for 8 minutes and then let cool for 5 minutes.  I will definately add chocolate chips next time.  A bit bland (the basic recipe).

I made these with my kids and they were fabulous!!! I couldn't stop eating them. I used 1 cup chocolate chips instead of raisins as we are big chocolate fans and raisins not so much. I also used quick oats instead of rolled. I did make the cookies a little larger and left the cooking temp and time the same to compensate for the quick oats. They turned out with the perfect feel and texture outside and the perfect gooey-ness inside

Baking these right now, and boy howdy . . . are they delish! Just a mite salty, tho'. Next time will try them with a smidge more than 1/4 tsp. salt. Only change I made to the recipe was to add some finely chopped walnuts. Thanks for the recipe. This one's a keeper!

We loved this cookie! I wasn't expected much at all- but they really suprised me. I added extra cocoa to make it a little more chocolately. They were moist for days. Make sure you don't overcook..it can be hard to tell for chocolate cookies : ) Big family hit.

A very good cookie. We didn't have raisins on hand, and didn't want to make a trip to the store for them, so we substituted white chocolate chips for the raisins. WOW! They're so good. I think next time, I'll add nuts too.

You know, I NEVER thought of adding cocoa to oatmeal cookies! This is a great base recipe; I add raisins AND chocolate chips (1/3 C each), as well as 2t cinnamon, 1/4t nutmeg, and 1/4t ground cloves, AND 1/8t almond extract.  Makes the BEST cookie for the Fall/Winter! Thanks for the idea and a great recipe!

I overbaked the cookies a little bit, but they still tasted good, chewy and chocolate-y.  Not a fan of the raisins, though.  They'd be great with chocolate or peanut butter chips, a few tablespoons of peanut butter, and/or some coconut.

It's great and it reminds me of health or power bars--that oaty feeling in your mouth and throat when you chew and swallow these morsels!! I now make these cookies for all who love the great feeling! These cookies are also great at any temperature. Definitely make these. Love em. I have more to say, but I'll stop. :)

I'd rate this this a 5 except I added about a tsp of cinnamon, and used chocolate/carmel chips instead of raisins.  I had thought about using dried cranberries instead of the raisins anyway.  I'll try that next time.  I love the chocolate flavor in the dough, not just the chips.

They tasted really very good, not amazing, but tasty. The recipe says to make each cookie 1 tablespoon, but I did that and the cookies came out tiny. They were way smaller than the picture. On my second batch I did 2 tablespoons of dough and it came out much better.

I have made these cookies several times and they have always turned out perfect. The only change I make in this recipe is omit the white sugar and add about 100 gms of chopped pecan nut. A great recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made a few changes. I used whole wheat flour as another reviewer had and I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. The tartness of the cranberries really offset the sweetness of the cookie and really recommend this substitute. Let me know if you try this.

Very yummy!! They totally remind me of my old fav. no bake cookies (flavour wise) I thought they weren't done at first but they are so soft and moist while staying sturdy on the outside. I didnt have raisins but I dont feel like Im missing a thing! These are delicioso cookies and I will definitely be making them many many more times.  Thank you for this great oatmeal cookie recipe for a chocoholic like meee ;)

These cookies were great! I substituted Spelnda brown and white sugar, and they turned out really good. Even my super-picky 9 year old liked them!

These cookies are delicious!  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins (thought they would be more "holiday"), and added some chocolate chips.  Yum!

These were amazing!  So quick and easy to make. They had the perfect chewyness.  I was skeptical of the cocoa at first but they were delicious!  I added dried cherries to the batch rather than rasins and they were the first empty plate at our halloween party this weekend.

Good cookies.  The only change I made to the recipe was to soak the raisins in the egg and vanilla mixture for about 30 minutes.  I'm not exactly sure if that makes any difference, but I'm used to doing that for oatmeal raisin cookies.

I have a new favorite cookie recipe!!!  I just made these and ate about 4 as I was taking them off the pans (ones in center of pan were extra gooey because I tend to under-bake cookies, so they kept breaking apart - but tasted SO GOOD)!  Used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. white, and couldn't even tell they were "healthy."  They were just right, chewy and chocolatey but not too sweet.  Oh, I also used white chocolate chips instead of raisins because that sounded good to me.  Thanks for a great recipe! Update: made them again with all whole-wheat flour, and couldn't tell a difference. Also chilled the dough before baking, and they came out a bit thicker. Last batch cooled on the pan because I forgot about them, and they came off in one piece even though they were under-baked - perfectly soft and chewy!

These came out pretty dang good.  Followed the recipe, but left out raisins though.  I might make these again.  I baked them for 12 minutes, but I made each cookie larger than recommended.

These are a very different cookie.  I made them just as in written and loved them.  Colour come out much darker than the picture here.  A nice change from regular oatmeal raisan cookies! 11 minutes worked perfectly for me.

These are good, but I'm not so sure about the raisins with the chocolate.  I made them for a friend, so if he likes them that's all that matters.  Bf thought they were good to, but said could do without the raisins.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Great for when you forgot to buy chocolate chips and have a chocolate craving! I omitted the raisins. I put in 1 less TBSP of butter, substituting 2 TBSP of creamy natural peanut butter. These cookies freeze well.

Made them without raisins as the "under 10's" in this house don't like them, and OH WOW!!! Yummy! Hubby and I had a few while they were still warm!!! That's definitely going to be a repeat recipe! 
Very very nice! Thanks for the recipe!!
(edit: I came looking for a recipe, having forgotten I'd bookmarked and reviewed this one already and the 2nd try was just as great as the first!! I did use choc chips this time instead of raisins, now this recipe is going in my recipe binder for good!)

Really good recipe.  I added a cup of chocolate chips into the batter as well and it just made the cookies every kid's dream come true.  My neighbour's kids just devoured them.

I liked these a lot.  I was thinking about making no-bake cookies when I came across this recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, except for leaving out the raisins and adding some chopped pecans.  I don't really care for raisins with chocolate and I love nuts.  I baked for 12 minutes and they were perfectly chewy and moist, just the way we like our cookies.  Next time, I think I'll try adding chocolate chips.

I will definitely make this again for friends.

My 9 year old daughter and I made these cookies today and we would rate them 4.5.  We followed the recipe exactly.  They are a very filling cookie that is not too sweet and they taste very good.  Next time I might try adding some cinnamon like some other reviewers tried.  They almost taste like a slightly healthy cookie, which makes you feel less guilty eating them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice!  I replaced half of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, used unsalted butter instead of shortening, and also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix as per other reviews.  They came out chewy and delicious, not too sweet and almost exotic tasting.  I made about 45;  I think next time I will make fewer of them in a larger size.  This one's a keeper!

I really like these. Not a really sweet cookie. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves to add a little spice. I think had I not added this these might have been bland.

Be careful! These are SO addictive. If you love chocolate and oatmeal, you MUST try these.

THis recipe was easy enough my 13 year old daughter had a wonderful time making them.  They were a hit at her end of the year school party. The kids liked them better than the original no-bake oatmeal cookies.

I made these today after getting a major craving for some chocolate. These are the best chocolate cookies, period. Not too sweet, not too bland - just right. I followed the recipe exactly except for I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, nixed the raisins and only added 1 1/2 cups of oats. I yielded just over 4 dozen addictive and chewy cookies. I will make these again!!

These were good, but not something I would make all the time. I didn't think the cocoa meshed well with the raisins. Next time I will omit them.

Kind of bland, maybe some cinnamon would spice it up.  Thought it would be a nice chewy cookie, but it was mostly just pasty.  Too cocoa-y for me!

How do you get them really flat do you press them with a spoon?  The first batch is out and cooling and I have not tasted as yet, but they are just not as flat as the ones I tasted up North and liked so much.

I changed the recipe to fit my health standards. Instead of the butter I used 1/2 cup coconut oil and 3 small grated, peeled apples. When I was done the dough/batter looked too wet, so I added almost a whole cup of flour! I think next time I will put in a lot less flour, but they did end up as very interesting lump-shaped cookies. They have a kind of mild chocolate flavor - I'll add more cocoa next time, but overall this is a really great cookie!

Delish cookies!  Soft in the middle.  I didn't have enough raisins so added dried cranberries to the mix.  I also used Turbanado sugar to replace the white sugar.

These are great, and perfect to make with my 5-year old helper!  We subbed half chocolate and half white chocolate chips for the raisins, and thet turned out fudgy and just right.

We rolled them into balls for uniformity, and they spread perfectly,  11.5 minutes bake time.

I read through some of the reviews from others who have made these before I made them myself. I'm not much of a raisin person so I left those out but used the suggestion given by a previous reviewer and added a couple of tbsp of peanut butter... oh my goodness, they are delicious! I love how they are not too sweet, and the addition of the peanut butter makes them so chewy and wonderful! I gave these to my in-laws and to some people at my church and they just went crazy over them! Wonderful, wonderful recipe!

Good cookies, made a half batch using Dutch processed cocoa.  Had a very light taste of chocolate, next time I may use the normal Hershey's cocoa and see what the flavor is like.

I would give is recipe 5 stars for easy baking. The flavour however was somewhat lacking. Next time I will make this recipe with double the amount of cocoa and some instant coffee crystals or cinnamon. Either way, a nice and tasty cookie!

This was not quite a cookie in texture and had very little flavor. Very crunchy and and tasted bland. No moisture whatsoever.

These cookies were very good.  I added chocolate chips and noticed that they were a little dry but overall very yummy.

These turned out very nicely. Perfect flavor, not too much and not too little. I cooked mine on 350 degrees for 9 minutes, let cool on sheet for 1 minute and then transferred to wire rack. They all turned out great.

Excellent! I did as other reviewers suggested and added 2T of peanut butter and chocolate chips instead of the raisins. They were best right out of the oven. We'll definitely make these again!

This recipe is terrific! As per the comments, I added chocolate chips and baked them for 8 1/2 minutes. I also substituted the raisins for hazelnuts. They came out firm but chewy, just the way I like them.

I'm new to baking and these cookies were perfect! They are soft and chewy with a sweet but not overly chocolaty taste. I took a reviewers advice and added the two tbsp's of peanut butter instead of adding raisins because I don't like them. I will for sure be making these again, but next time I want to try adding some chocolate chips.

A very good cookie, however I don't think the raisins 'fit.'  Next time I will substitute chocolate chips instead.  Great recipe!

These cookies are amazing!  My family doesn't like raisins so I substituted white chocolate chips.  They were so easy that my 3 year old and I made them together in about 15 min!  We will definitely do these again.

I had no baking soda, so I used double tha baking powder (a recommended substitution). I substituted choc chips for the raisins. In my oven, needed 15 minutes to bake. I used a 2 tbsp. cookie scoop. Yield was 3 doz. Taste awesome with dark beer. Really!

These cookies were good.  I would give 4 1/2 stars if possible, but not quite 5.  I made a 1/2 batch and instead of coco, added around 2 tsp of cinnamon.  The flavor was great in my opinion!  The cookies were a little thinner than I like my oatmeal cookies, so I will probably add a little more flour next time around.....

Alright, but it seems like they have too much butter.  They came out a little greasy. I did add a lot of coconut to them-- double yummyness!  Highly recommended.

We made these out of desperation b/c we were hot and sick and really wanted some cookies that used what we had on hand: oatmeal and chocolate chips.  They are now one of my favorites.  Chewy and rich but not over powering in the chocolate factor.

I've tried lots of oatmeal cookie recipes, and this is by far the BEST. I don't use raisins, and put in chocolate chips. I love these cookies because they come out very soft and doughy. And they stay soft for some days, not like lots of cookies where you have to eat them the first day before they go stale. Love it love it love it. Everyone I've given these cookies to asks for the recipe.

Everybody loves these, and they are pretty healthy, especially if you use half whole wheat flour (you can't taste the difference).  I also used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Yum!

Excellent! I put in dried cranberries instead of raisins and used whole wheat flour. And they turned out really well, everyone loved these!

Pretty tasty. I was just looking for a recipe to use up all my flour, oats, and sugars and this was almost perfect. Since I was running low, I had to sub 1/2 the brown sugar with agave syrup and I used 100% whole wheat flour. I also opted for chocolate chunks instead of raisins, and added about 1/4 c of peanut butter.

I subbed chocolate chips for the raisins since we are not raisin fans.  No one raved about these cookies.  May have to give some away.

I made these cookies last night since I already had all of the ingredients in my pantry. They were delicious! My fiance hates oatmeal and gave me a grimace when I told him I was making oatmeal cookies. After he tried one, he said, "So, this is what oatmeal was made for." This will definitely become a regular recipe. Oh, and I traded the raisins for chocolate chunks. Yummy!

This was pretty good.  I always seem to have oatmeal, cocoa powder and brown sugar around, and never have chips, nuts etc. So I made them with just cocoa, and took off some of the sugar.  I subbed some applesauce for some of the fat, and added a touch of oil so the dough wouldnt be too tough.  Baked about 16 minutes and they were pretty tasty.   I think hubby thinks they are too much like "health cookies," but I ate them right up!

Sounds wonderful! Neither I nor my husband like raisins; would I just add another cup of oatmeal to substitute for the raisins?  Or, do I not add anything and leave them out?

I made these exactly as directed - they were a bit cake-like with little flavor.  I would add maybe some ground ginger or something with a kick.  They were bland, but definitely on to something.

So delicious! I decided to make some yummy cookies to warm up a cold night and these worked great.  I did want to use up some peanut butter, so I added about 1/2 cup of it and a dash of cinnamon.  YUM!

Good cookie, similar to no bake cookies. They get harder once they cool so take them out earlier if you like them soft. Mine had a funny after taste but I'm sure it was just because the oats were stale. Will probably make again! (with frest oats) : P

My "healthy" version wasn't near as sweet or moist, but still fairly tasty. I cut the recipe in half and Xylitol for the sugar and Sweet N Low Brown for the brown sugar. I used Kamut whole grain flour and Chatfield's Premium Cocoa Powder (no sugars or fat) and Organic whole grain old-fashioned oats. I threw in about 2 Tablespoons of organic crunchy Valencia peanut butter and reduced the butter (Smart Balance w/ Flax) by 1 Tablespoon, as previously suggested. I omitted the raisins and threw in some sliced almonds. Took care of my sweet tooth, but wouldn't be my first choice if I could afford to indulge.

These are fantastic! My mom can't keep her hands off them and they are so rich, my 2 year old can't even finish a whole one! I don't really care for raisins in my cookies so I opted to use mini chocolate chips instead of the raisins and it was ALMOST too much for me. (not quite) Next time I might use 1/2 cup almonds and 1/2 cup mini chips. Very soft and chewy. GREAT COOKIE! Thanks.

A little difficult to make, but they turned out fantastic! The flavour is so much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. I wouldn't use raisins with these though.

I put m & ms in instead of raisins. They aren't realllllly flavorful but they are good. I made fat little balls and they didn't spread at all. This allowed for a doughy yummy center. Over all good but for an oatmeal cookie they could be better.

These cookies got an enthusiastic thumbs up from my husband and kids. I used coarsely chopped up chunks of baker's chocolate instead of raisins, but next time I will throw some raisins in, too. Fresh from the oven they were wonderfully chewy and the chocolate was gooey. Later, a quick pop in the microwave made them great again. I definitely will make these again many times.

These were good, but I cheated a bit and added chocolate chips. :) I think they wouldn't have been sweet enough without them. They were really tasty with the chocolate chips, though.

Great cookies! My all-time favorites. 

I laughed when I saw somebody say they switched the ingredients and that the resulting cookies weren't that great. Well, duh. At least follow the recipe if you are going to rate the recipe.

I made these GLUTEN FREE by substituting rice flour for ap. flour and used McCann's quick oats.  Also used 1c. GF. choc. chips.  don't make too big and bake for 12 min.  If too big, they become lacy.  Nice cookie!  No one will know  the difference.

These are soooo good! I substituted a little over a cup of chocolate chips for the raisins, and I did 1/2 cup whole wheat flour + 1 cup white flour. Butter is a MUST in this recipe--it really "ups" the richness of the cookies. This is an easy cookie recipe to make and I will definitely be baking these again!

Easy and delicious!  I changed the recipe to yield 12 cookies and used one egg white instead of one egg, 1/4c whole wheat flour and 2Tbsp all purpose flour.  Also, I added 1/4 c pecans (because I didn't have walnuts) and 1/4 c semi sweet chocolate morsels.

Delicious and relatively healthy, for a cookie.

I am not a baker at all but wanted to make something homemade for our children's "goodie" night so I saw what I had in the pantry and was happy to see that I had all the ingredients for this great cookie. I was nervous but after tasting one I am so pleased!!!!! Thank you for such a great and easy recipe for those who are "Baking Challenged" haha

I tried these out, as others mentioned, I had all the ingredients already and was itching to make something yummy.  Wow- exceeded my expectations!  I was told these were the best cookies I've ever made!  I did the 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2/ cup white flour to make it a little "healthier" and added the 2 T of pb for some more flavor.  For some reason (I'm thinking it's my oven), I ended up baking these for 15 minutes per batch.  Wonderful cookies!!

Fast and easy.  I omitted the white sugar, added another 2-3 Tbsp of cocoa, and mixed in some chopped semi-sweet morsels to make them extra rich.  They were delicious!

This recipe was really yummy-but once it isn't fresh anymore-it doesn't taste as good! A note- i only put foil over the plate of cookies for a couple days so that could have been why too. Will use again, especially for big parties where I know I wont have any leftovers.

I found these to only be so-so.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, found them a tad dry ... perhaps too much oatmeal?  I thought the batter all the way up to adding the oatmeal (the chocolate base) was delightful, so I was dissapointed that they didn't taste great.  I baked 2 trays, waited to people to eat them, had very mediocre responses to this recipe.  I'll keep looking for a better oatmeal cookie recipe.  Gave it 3 stars because the batter up until the oatmeal addition is really good.

These are yummy!  Used chocolate chips instead of raisins though.  And for a healthier, non-chocolate version, we've also made them omitting 1/2 cup butter, cocoa and white sugar.

What a great switch from run-of-the-mill oatmeal cookies!  I cut the recipe to 12, so I used only 1 egg white...and I skipped the raisins.  Constistency is great, flavor is great.  Perfect amount of chocolate to balance the sugars.  YUM!!

Excellent cookies. I only made tiny changes and it may be a version others will like as well. I had Hershey's dark chocolate powder (unsweetened) on hand so I used that. I also chopped up a Special Dark chocolate bar and added that to the mix. I don't care for raisins and chocolate so I omitted them. I also noticed I was 1/2 stick short on butter so I used 3 tsp of shortening to make up the difference. Still tasted great! The 4 year old loved them. I will be taking them to a pot luck today. I anticipate the plate fill to vanish. Thanks. PS...I made these for a second time and divided the batch in half adding butterscotch chips to one and white chocolate chips to the other. This time I also used regular cocoa powder. They are still delicious!

Yum! Only changes I made were 5 tbsp crisco since I was 5 tbsp short on butter, and 1/2 C raisins instead of 1 C (all I had) They are delicious - my kids are gobbling them up as we speak!

I made this recipe as a bar cookie and omitted the raisins. I cooked the cookie on a jelly roll pan for about 13 minutes. They turned out great! This is a great alternative recipe from traditional oatmeal cookies. I love the chocolate flavor.

I made these for my dad who requested that I make some oatmeal cookies and he really liked these! He said that they tasted like rum balls without the rum. I thought that they were only okay, I thought that they had a strange taste, but he liked them. And I only used 1/2 cup of butter rather than the whole cup. The cookies were still very chewy. If you only use 1/2 cup of butter than you will probably have to increase the cooking time by about a minute or so, but that's just in my experience.

Very nice! I really loved the combination of cocoa and oatmeal. I am going to make these again!

I just wanted to know... the ones I made came out to be soft. I wanted to make crunchier cookies, could I know what to add/omit? I haven't really made too many cookies before, so I'm not really an expert.

Very good but very different from the  traditional oatmeal cookie: the chocolate flavor is strong and yummy. Thanks!

Pretty good.  Not the greatest oatmeal cookies I've ever tried.  I may mess around with the recipe next time and see if I can get it any better.

Moist and yummy!  I have made this recipe twice, once with the raisins -which gives a wonderful flavor combination and once with a half a cup of chocolate chips and a half a cup of peanut butter chips and obmitted the raisins -pretty darn good!

I added almonds and currants to my recipe and they turned out great.  I had to cook them for a little longer than recommended, but it could have been because I made them quite large.  Very, very nice cookie.  I've eaten at least 10 of them!

Tasty (although not that appealing to the eye).  I didn't have raisins so I substituted some chopped dried apricots.  Nice flavor combo.  Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies are really easy to make and they turned out nice and chewy. I added some cinnamon and chocolate chips (instead of the raisins). I'll definetly keep this recipe handy.

Terrific recipe. Delicious. I added a touch of cinnamon, a drizzle of milk, and substituted a large handful of chopped walnuts for raisins. I let the first batch overcook a couple of minutes to get a crisp cookie and it worked like a charm. I'll time the other batches to the recipe specs to get a chewier texture. Next time, I'll add some orange flavor, some nutmeg and maybe a different kind of nuts. Thanks C. McDonald!

This is a great cookie! So easy and really rich and chocolaty. I used margarine because I didn't have any butter and it turned out great. I also left out the raisins, just because I'm not a fan of raisins in cookies. I will definitely make these again. I think they are at the top of my families favorite cookie recipes now! Thanks!

I'm not a skilled baker, but these we're pretty easy to make and my girlfriend seemed to like them. The first batch was a little burned even though i left them in for only 7 minutes. I think my oven is hotter than it says. Anyway, the second batch I took out sooner and they tasted sweeter and they we're a lot more chocolatey. Pretty good. I'd bake these again.
