Good start, but a bit bland for me, I'd make it again and add more seasonings.

The garlic ended up being overcooked - next time I will shorten the amount of time between the garlic and other ingredients.  Also, I ended up using a lesser amount of lemon as I prefer a more garlicky flavor.  Otherwise, a great, simple dish that I will certainly make again!

Spinach Toss Spaghetti w/ Tomatoes & Garlic Haiku: "Chef V, I loved this! Simple to make, elegant. (Added grilled chicken.) Per the cook's note, I added strips of AR's "Easy Grilled Lemon Chicken" along w/ a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese to make this a heartier entree. Subbed grape tomatoes for cherry: different shape, same taste, cheaper cost, IMHO. An easy meal to throw together in no time; I thought it was lovely; thanks Chef V!
