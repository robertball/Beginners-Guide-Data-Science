These are so good. Actually very easy too! I used 2 inch foil liners so I could just put them on a cookie sheet rather than using the mini muffin pan. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Drizzled the tops with some melted semi sweet chocolate. They looked beautiful and hardly had a chance to cool before we gobbled half of them. Thanks so much for the recipe.

These cookies are verrrry good.  I can't cook anything and I didn't mess these up.  I only made 30 cookies so they were a little bigger.

I would actually give the kid friendly rating on these a 10!!!  My boys' favorite candy bar is Reese Cup, as with many kids, I believe; so, these are a HUGE hit with them.....and my husband and me, too! :o)  Very quick, easy, and fun to make.  The kids love to help out!  Makes a great family-time activity that everyone can enjoy afterwards.

Definite kid pleaser and very easy.  The dough is a bit sticky, but they come out so pretty and are super yummy.  Much better made with the homemade dough than the refrigerated store bought kind.

These cookies look great -- especially with melted chocolate drizzled over the tops like in the picture.  The taste was good, but not incredible.  My guests all remarked how good they looked, but they each only ate one.

I make these for Christmas every year, and I also made them for the dessert buffet at my daughter's wedding. While the peanut butter cup is still warm I drop on a small royal icing flower for added effect. Everyone loves these!
