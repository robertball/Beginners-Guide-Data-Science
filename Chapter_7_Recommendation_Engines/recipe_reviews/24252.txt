I would suggest using less Miracle Whip, it was all I could taste (yuk!) and too runny to form a ball. However, I served it in a chip-n-dip bowl with crackers and who would have guessed.......my very picky husband LOVED it!  He even asked me to make it to take on a car trip.  Wow! Thanks for making my hubby happy. :o)

I had to make this without the nuts (can't eat them).  I did not use any miracle whip or liquid from the oilves.  It came out as more of a spread; no way could I have shaped it into a ball.  It made a very nice sandwhich spread though & I would make this again.

The best there is. I have made this for years, omitting the olives due to a personal dislike for them, and I roll it in paprika instead of nuts.

Even after resting in the fridge this is pretty loose. The taste is good but it is too wet to form into a pretty ball. I added green onions because they just go with ham but I recommend cutting way back on the Miracle Whip/Mayo if I were you. Again, taste is there but it needs to be tighter if you want a true cheese ball.
