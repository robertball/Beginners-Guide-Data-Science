I just LOVE this recipe.  I have made it a number of times and every time they turn out great!  A bit rich/sweet for breakfast but perfect for a snack or tea!  They were very moist when fresh from the oven, dryer when cooled but not overly so.  Cinnamon chips work great too!  Also, I have made with 2% milk because that's all I had and they tasted the same (great!) but the texture did change a bit (a little "chewy").

These are basically AMAZING.  I used regular old bittersweet chocolate chips and Splenda, just what I had around, and they turned out really well.  I would probably sprinkle them with real sugar next time; the Splenda looks a little bizarre on top.  

I am by no means a kneading connoisseur, so I had a bit of trouble getting all the dough kneaded together (felt like I had added a bit too much flour and that those chocolate chips would never blend in!), but I got it after about 5 minutes.  (Nice upper body workout!)  I sent these to my family through the mail, and they loved them a week later.

Delicious!  I made these for Christmas morning brunch, and the whole family loved them!  They were so easy to make, too.  I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, which worked out great.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

Excellent recipe! This is the first time I've used whipping cream instead of butter in a scone recipe, and it sure made it a lot easier.  I used a giant hershey dark chocolate bar and chunked it up (couldn't find the chips in the store) and I think I'd prefer that to the chips.  Definitely my favorite scone recipe so far.

this was my first scones recipe, and it didn't turn out very well. maybe it was just me, but they were extremely dry on the outside and really wet on the inside. the taste was satisfactory but it didn't look very good.

OUTSTANDING, I love these scones, as the other Renee said, they are to sweet and rich for breakfast, but great any other time.

These were fantastic and easy to make! I've never made scones before, not to mention never made anything 'bready' before - this recipe made things wonderfully simple and the result was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I both love them and can't wait to try variations!

Used semi-sweet chips and heavy cream and they were great for breakfast.  The powdered sugar made them almost too sweet.

I served these warm out of the oven...PERFECT.  Moist and delicious.  No need to add the extra powdered sugar.  My guests adored them!  And they were so easy to make!

I served this as one of the scones at a bridal shower tea party.  Yum!!  I couldn't find the Special Dark chips at the store so I used semi-sweet and it still turned out great.  Rave reviews from everybody who tried them.
