This cake is WONDERFUL!  I know jalepenos sounds like a weird ingredient to add, but it is surprisingly good.  I haven't been brave enough to try it with 2 TBSP, but I find one TBSP gives it just enough kick.  The cinnamon is exactly the right amount, too.  I top the cake with almonds and it really enhances the flavor of the cake.  Another plus is vanilla ice cream on the side.  The spice of the cake combined with the coolness of the ice cream is like a party in your mouth.  Try this, you won't be sorry!!!  When serving this to a crowd keep the jalepenos a secret, and then when your guests rave about the cake let them in on the mystery ingredient!!

I'm a huge fan of spicy foods and spicy chocolate, so I had really high hopes for this. Unfortunately, it turned out disgusting. The recipe calls for way too much cinnamon, and while I love jalapenos, they don't mesh well with cake. I will say, however, that the moisture and texture of the cake was near perfect, so perhaps it would be best to bake this sans jalapenos.

If you think Jalapenos in a cake sounds disgusting, go with that feeling.  I thought the current ratings were impressive and since it was a Nestle recipe, I could not go wrong.  I had 4 people all try this cake and they all agreed.
