Incredible!  I accidentally mixed the pesto into the egg salad instead of following the directions (oops!) but LOVED it.  My 10 year old thought it was the best egg salad she's ever had, and I agree that it is delicious.  This is going in our school lunchbox file as a sandwich filling!  5 stars all the way, thanks!

I cut this back as best I could for one serving. I used real bacon bits instead of freshly cooked bacon and made this an open faced sandwich using one piece of whole wheat bread instead of sourdough. This was actually quite good, I was shocked. This was my breakfast this morning, I paired it with a small bowl of fruit and a large glass of ice water. I am actually quite full.

The bacon made it smell and taste rancid. No one in my family didn't even touch it.

VERY GOOD  We both enjoyed. Very creamy with Mayo and 
melted cheese on top. I used deli mustard instead of yellow and I would do again.  I used 7 grain Hamburg bun and real bacon bits. Very enjoyable and filling..
