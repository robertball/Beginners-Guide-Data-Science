I added a little more melted butter and some lemon pepper seasoning. Really yummy. NO leftovers. I totally ate my weight in broccoli tonight and the kids inhaled their portions.

Great side dish!  I tossed the broccoli with a little olive oil, a dash of salt and cracked black pepper along with the garlic.  I then mixed up the bread crumbs (italian style), parmesan cheese and melted butter until it formed crumbs and then sprinkled that over the broccoli.  It stuck better due to the olive oil.  I put it under the broiler and watched it closely until it browned.  If you like this side dish you'll like "Baked Garlic Green Beans" from this site.

I don't know how I missed this recipe until now.  Had I known about it, and how good it was, I would have made it a long time ago. Of all the ways to prepare broccoli and give it a little style, this is certainly one of the best.  I prepared the recipe as directed, using good quality Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, although I did drizzle some melted butter over the broccoli before topping it with the crumbs.   Watch cooking time carefully! It only took a few minutes to cook the broccoli to crisp-tender and, depending on where your broiler rack is set, considerably less than 4-5 minutes to brown the crumbs. Hubs and I were both very impressed.

I'm going to say that this is average. Not bad but not exceptional either. I've never cared for broccoli prepared in the microwave so perhaps if I'd steamed as usual I may have a different opinion, & slighty sautee the garlic in the butter prior to mixing w/ bread crumbs...but as written I'm sticking with 3-star average.

These are a favorite way to make broccoli now. I don't cook ahead of time, I roast with a little olive oil and top with the parm and just a tablespoon of bread crumbs. I even do these on the grill in a disposible pan.

I skipped the steaming and just tossed everything together and roasted in the oven at about 425 for a half hour or so.  I used olive oil, not butter, and next time will add some lemon zest as other reviewers suggested.  Very tasty!

This was ok.  Nothing was wrong with it, but I like plain broccoli better.  It was just broccoli with some crispy garlicy topping.  Wait, as I type that, it sounds awesome again.  I'm not sure why we didn't like this more.  My husband suggested it needed more butter so it would stick better to the broccoli.  It mostly just fell off.  I was thinking it might be better to saute the garlic first so it's not such a sharp garlic taste.  I don't know, the idea is good, but the execution just didn't turn out right for me.  Thanks anyway!

This recipe is a keeper!  I added 1 tablespoon of fresh grated lemon zest into the topping.  I do wonder if the topping would be less dry if I used olive oil?  Due to health reasons, we were forced to use light butter.  Either way, this certainly is a tasty and quick way to "dress up" your basic broccoli.

Simple, delicious and easy...you can't get much better in a recipe.  I absolutely love the crunch that the topping gives to the broccoli.  It had just the right amount of garlic and buttery crumbs.  I did steam the broccoli in the microwave, but next time I may try just roasting the broccoli.  This is definitely going to be a staple in our house...even the little guy loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

As broccoli is one of the heartier veggies in our frig (read:  can go a long time unused in the crisper), this recipe will become a side staple at the LTH house.  We had this tonight w/"Grilled Delmonico Steaks" and it was wonderful combo.  I couldn't stop picking florets off the baking dish as I was plating the food.  That good.  I'm lazy, so I skipped the steam and simply roasted at 425 for somewhere between 10-20 minutes.  Awesome.  THANKS so much for delightfully simple recipe that adds some oomph, yet still allows the veggie to shine, Bryan!

Yummy!  I thought the bread crumbs were probably unneccesary.  But, parmesan on broccoli was tasty.  Also, steaming in the microwave worked perfectly.  Quicker than my usual method in the steamer.

Delicious!  I would just say, however, if you're not a garlic lover, maybe saut√© the garlic first or use garlic powder instead.

Love how easy this is to prepare and how good it is.  I will probably cut back on the toppings next time, only as a personal preference though.  Thanks Bryan!

Loved this! I didn't have fresh garlic on hand so added some garlic powder and a little lemon juice. Microwaved for 5 minutes and broiled for two. I loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good, but ours turned out a little of the dry side.  Next time I will add a bit more melted butter to the mix and maybe a bit less bread crumbs.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Bryan!

The garlic cloves gave it a spicy twist that we liked.  The breadcrumbs didn't stick to the broccoli but we just scooped them up with the fork so no big deal:)

Tasty broccoli.  My only problem was that the 6 minutes in the microwave made my broccoli a little soggy and over cooked  even before going in the oven.  Next time I will probably either just steam for maybe 2 minutes before going into the oven or skip that step as another reviewer suggested.  Did omit the bread crumbs(didn't have any on hand) and we didn't miss them.  Thanks. Will make again.  Tasty and healthy.

OMG. I just can‚Äôt believe I ate the whole thing. I was making this for lunches. 4 cups worth with broccoli and zucchini. It is gone. Next time, I will try the lemon zest, maybe red pepper flakes too.

Made exactly as stated, I wasn't a huge fan of it but my hunny had seconds and was supper excited he had leftovers for today. I will make this again just because he was so happy and enjoyed it so much. I think next time I might add more garlic and a bit more butter as I found it sort of dull

Yummy!  I never thought I would be saying that about broccoli.  This was a quick and easy way to prepare broccoli.  I seemed kind of fancy actually.  My family loved it.  I served it as a side to herb crusted pork loin.  Broiling the whole dish at the end really makes it.  Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this recipe.  It's easy and quick.  I like my broccoli not crispy but not mushy, and this recipe cooked it just right.  I will make this often.

This was great but next time I will increase the breading by another half and toss the broccoli in a little bit of garlic butter as only the top pieces of broccoli were touched by the topping.

I used the recipe mostly as an idea base to make a low-fat broccoli side dish using bread crumbs.  I followed the directions for steaming the fluorets (but also added minced garlic at that point)and then sprayed them with "I can't believe it's not butter" spray, sprinkled with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  I finished it in the oven under the broiler as suggested.  LOVED IT!!!  It significantly lowered the fat content and made it into the healthy side dish I was looking for.  Thanks for the recipe as a starting point for what I was looking for!

This is outstanding!!!  I steam the broccoli, rather than microwave.  Also add a little color with a fresh tomato cut into chunks before broiling.

Terrific!  A tasty change from our normal broccoli sprinkled with lemon juice and parmesan.  Husband and I love it; kids were split 50/50.  Per earlier reviews I added lemon zest and substituted olive oil for butter.  Definitely a keeper.
