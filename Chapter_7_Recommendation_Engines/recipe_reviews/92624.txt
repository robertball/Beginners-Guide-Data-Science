We loved this, served it up to the inlaws on a bed of couscous. It took a while to make, but it was really delicious. The only problem was that we didn't make enough for left overs!

This was a very tasty way to prepare turkey legs.  I made the sauce, but didn't have the pomengranate molases, so I used half regular molasses and half honey to make up the difference.  I used fresh sage.  I basted the legs 3 times during the roasting.  Hubby said they were great too!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. My boyfriend didn't want to try it out, he's a whimp. So I just made mine with the sauce. He ended up wanting to eat mine! Go figure. just the way I like it, with the ends crunchy and flavored with sauce. It seemed to put a glaze with crunchy juiciness. I also ended up using the sauce on a pork roast, not as good as the turkey legs but still very moist.

This is a great recipe. Everyone loves this - from my toddler to Great-Grandma. I even made it without the pomegranate molasses, and it still tasted yummy. Try it!

I made this according to the directions.  The glaze is basically a BBQ sauce.  The instructions made a lot.  It was very wasteful.  It smelled nice while cooking down, but my son, the only reason I was making turkey legs, said that it was too sweet.  If you are making four turkey legs, you could probably cut this recipe (the glaze portion) to a quarter or an eighth of what it calls for.

This was quite a process to make, but worth the effort.  Turns out I didn't have any molasses in the house, but honey, corn syrup and brown sugar were fitting substitutes.  I am sure it is even better with both types of molasses.

I was looking for a good turkey drumstick recipe but unfortunately this was not it. I followed the instructions and it was too sweet, and the sage and thyme seemed like they belonged to another recipe, they did not work well with this one. I had printed the recipe but tossed it along with the leftover sauce, which I could not imagine eating again.

Thank You for this recipe. Finally a good one for close to the taste of the turkey legs from fairs and festival, if not better!
