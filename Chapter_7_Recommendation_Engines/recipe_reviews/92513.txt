The salad is good, the vinagrette I found a little bland for my taste, therefore I added salt and three times the suggested vinager.

This mild citrus dressing really lets the taste of the other ingredients come through.  I usually add nuts (walnuts or almonds), fruit (dried cranberries or sliced pear), and a little crumbled gorgonzola to the spinach salad.  This dressing compliments it nicely.

I thought that this vinagrette was absolutely yummy! I prefer my spinach salad with almonds and dried cranberries. This dressing goes great with it!

I loved this recipe and even share it with my friend.  Since my husband does not like mushrooms, i subsituted them for oranges (sliced).  Thank you for sharing!

The vinaigrette is just fabulous - one of the best dressings I've tried from this site. I like the combination of ingredients in the salad - it's more of a "classic" spinach salad, with the mushrooms standing in texturally for the traditional hard-boiled eggs. Brilliant!

I loved the flavour of the citrus with the spinach. I also have added orange segments to my version-it is really tasty! I made it for a dinner party and now am always asked to bring my spinach salad!

So easy and light.  I used 1-T of Splenda instead of 2-T sugar and added just a splash of rice vinegar in addition to the white vinegar.  Next time I'll try a shallot in place of garlic and maybe even add some lime or lemon to taste.

This citrus vinaigrette is absolutely to die for!  It is better than any store-bought dressing I have ever had.  The only change I made to the recipe was to season the dressing with salt and pepper before adding it to the salad.
