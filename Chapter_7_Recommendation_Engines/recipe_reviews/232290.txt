Instead of hot dogs, I used half of a package kielbasa. The recipe didn't specify which kind of hashbrown potatoes to use, I made my own from scratch. Both the kids had ketchup on theirs, the grownups used hot sauce instead. This was inhaled--NO leftovers.

I had problems with the amount of potatos. I used 3 or 4 cups & for 2 people,  it was still to munch,  next time I'll use less. I'll also cook everything seperate becaus the potatoes never browned in the pan after I mixed them with the eggs. Almost any knid of mest would be good with this meal,  I added shredded cheddar cheese to one serving, overall this is a recipe I want to try again.
