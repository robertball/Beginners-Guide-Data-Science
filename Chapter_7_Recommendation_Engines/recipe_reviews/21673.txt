I made this without the liquer because I didn't have any and with decaf coffee and it was awesome. It was a big hit at my party. I added some amaretto to it and it was great. It's great with or without liquer.

Oh my gosh this is so DELISH! I didn't even add all the ingrediants - just the coffee, milk, cream and sugar.  The cream I used however was french vanilla and seriously it is the closest thing to a Starbucks Vanilla Frap that I could ever imagine.  And I can have it in a PITCHER in my fridge for less than a buck!!!!  I am SOOOO happy!!!!

This was a big hit at my neighborhood "Thank God the kids are back in school" coffee.  Very easy to make.  I left out the alcohol for this morning get together!

Excellent! I am with K.C., I also omitted the liquer and just used some chocolate syrup. This is a great drink for a fraction of the cost. We have a blender and an ice maker in our kitchen at work and can make these up in a flash. What a savings from going around the corner to the expensive coffee shop! Thanks!

I loved this!  I didn't use the liquor but substituted Hershey's chocolate syrup.  I also froze some of the mixture in ice cube trays and blended the ice cubes with the liquid - yummy!

This is super easy to make, refreshing, and, as others have noted, a fraction of the cost of an iced coffee at Starbucks. I left out the liquer, and used 1 and 1/2 cups lowfat milk along with 1/2 cup half and half. Absolutely delicious - I'll be keeping this on hand all summer long!

YUM!!! Great way to use up leftover coffee so it doesn't get wasted...refreshing on a hot & humid day. I topped mine with a pretty swirl of ReddiWhip...bummed I don't have chocolate syrup to drizzle over the top, but this still gets a FIVE! Thanks! :)

Having never had iced coffee before either at Starbuck's or anywhere else, I can't compare this to any other iced coffee. The ingredients list and great reviews inspired me to give this a try. I'm normally just a regular cup o' Joe drinker so this was a real departure for me.  I enjoyed the flavor and just the touch of sweetness (I normally just take my regular Joe with cream, no sugar) and hint of chocolate (Godiva Chocolate Liqueur).  The final analysis is this...I'm not an iced coffee drinker but I'd love to try this again - hot!

Wonderful guideline to follow.  There is no need to chage it but I did to reduce fat & calories.  I used 2 cups of vanilla soymilk & 10 packets of Splenda.  I didn't have Cho Liquor on hand so I had to make it without.  It must taste amazing with it.  Thanks so much, my Mother loved it.

This coffee drink is saving me a lot of money. Taste better than the Frapp drinks that cost $3. I also add chocolate syrup to it. It's GREAT! Thank You for sharing.

I didn't use liqueur and it was still amazing! I substituted the half-half cream for mocha mix creamer. Quick and easy and delicious!

Loved this! I used Hershey's carmel syrup in place of the cacao. It's way better than Starbuck's, and I never thought anything could beat that!

I made this recipe as two servings, for my husband and I. I used a combination of fat free evaporated milk and fat free half-n-half and two jiggers of creme de cacao for each cup. What I did was combined the ingredients in my martini shaker and just shook it real well with a handful of ice. This was a nice nightcap for the both of us after a long day.

This was nice. :) I did a half-batch and it made 4 cups, one of which I drank last night while the rest will be enjoyed today. I used 3 cups of very-strong coffee, ½ cup milk, ½ cup half-and-half, about 3½ TBS sugar, and about 1 tsp vanilla. The vanilla helped cut the bitter taste of the strong coffee before the milk and cream were added. I added around 1 ounce of hazelnut-flavored Kahlua to my coffee last night and left the rest without alcohol. This morning, I added around 1 TBS of praline-flavored liquid creamer and it was excellent. Both my daughter and I enjoyed it this morning! Thanks for sharing, Sara!

EXCELLENT! - didn't have the choc-liquor so used swiss-miss hot chocolate mix, (french vanilla) while the coffee was still hot. Good results, gone in a flash. Thank you for a less expensive alternative to the high priced ones.

Not as good as Starbuck's but my wallet is happy. I cut the recipe down to 1/3 to try it out...next time I will make the full batch. It wasn't quite sweet enough for me but that could be because of faulty measuring. (I have nooo idea how much a 1/3 of a 1/3 of a cup is, so I just eyeballed the sugar). I used Godiva white chocolate liquer but I didn't decrease it by a 1/3....I used the full amount.

When my mom was here for a visit, I finally decided to make this recipe. I cut it down to 2 servings (just in case we didn't like it). It was very easy to make and tasted great; so creamy and good! The only difference is that I used Almond Joy creamer instead of half-n-half. Delish! Today it was just me so I adjusted the recipe for 1 serving and I don't know what happened since I used all the same ingredients, but it just wasn't as good. I sure will be making it again though. Made it again with the Almond Joy creamer, with almond extract instead of vanilla. And I figured out when I use this, it doesn't need the added sugar. YUM!

This was a little too watered down for me. Next time I would either use less milk or less ice.

Delicious!  Like mentioned by others, I didn't have the liquor (plus was serving to my younger siblings so I avoided the alcohol) but I'm sure it would be great with either ameretto, baileys, khalua, or the creme de cacao that's suggested.  I took some chocolate syrup and drizzled it on the inside of the glasses that I served it in and put whipped cream on the top... delicious!

This is very good iced coffee basic recipe. You can use different syrups and liqueurs. I used cream and milk and I didn`t have a chocolate liqueur and used Kahlua. The taste was the same you can get in a cafe.

7.25.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21673/creamy-ice-coffee/ ... Expiring half & half prompted me to try this.  I used all half & half.  Huh?!  ;D  I used double strength coffee & added a bit cocoa extract instead of liqueur.  I also added coffee extract & more vanilla.  It's better the next day.

I am not an iced coffee fan, that being said, this is fantastic! My teens and hubby love this too.  I do not use the liquor, instead I actually mix 1 tablespoon of pure cocoa into the coffee. The 1/3 cup of sugar is just enough to make this slightly sweet.  I like mine a little creamier so I add extra half and half to mine after I pour it into my glass. SOOOOO Good!!

Sal - thanks for a great beverage recipe; same great taste as the local coffeehouse (minus the steep price).  Like DONAGOTT, I made this cold drink without the liquer and it turned out swell.
