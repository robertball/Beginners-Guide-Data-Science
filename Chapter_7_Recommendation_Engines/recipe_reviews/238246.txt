Easy, tasty and healthy.
I didn't have any flaxseed or fennel so used Chia seeds instead. turned out really well. not sure how many I made six but would make 8 next time as they were big. kept well for a few days. Definitely will make again.

I made these with all-purpose gluten free (GF) flour, GF rolled oats, & substituted the soy milk with almond milk.   I also added a little cinnamon for fun.  Mild flavor, but tasty!
