Excellent flavor and texture.  My family enjoyed these thoroughly.  I substitued dried apricots for the cranberries and added 1/4 cup walnuts.

I tried this recipe and the cookies were OK.  I then altered your recipe by substituting the blueberries with 1/4 walnuts and added 1/4 cup s-s chocolate chips.  I had to add 1/2 cup applesauce for moisture.  A little trick that I used on the dried cranberries and cherries was to steam them for 3 minutes, it adds plumpness.

The dough was pressed to 1/2 inch thick and this made the time increase to 20-22 minutes at 350 degrees.
