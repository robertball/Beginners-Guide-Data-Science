I always follow the recipe EXACTLY the first time I make it if I am planning on doing a "review." Otherwise, how can you trust the "stars" if everyone is rating it based on changing the recipe?

This was extremely yummy. Very flavorful. Easy to make. DELICIOUS! I found none of the problems that other reviewers did.

Ok-I change some of the recipes I use from this site-I usually hate it when people do it, but I can't help myself!  I used a whole pound of bacon-sauteed that until crispy- drained off most of the grease (left about 2Tbsp.) sauteed a small onion with the garilc- added some dried basil and cayenne pepper- and added the tomatoes (I used tomatoes with green chiles) while I cooked the pasta.  Once the pasta was almost done, I added the spinach to the tomato mixture and then drained the pasta and added it to the tomatoes.  Once I brought it to the table, I served it with parmesan cheese.  YUM-O!! My husband said 4.  I said 5 because I think it's great.  This would be good at room temp as a buffet dish, I think it'll be great as leftovers and would be awesome with some grilled chicken and mushrooms.  Great recipe with lots of room to personalize!  Thanks for an awesome start to a great meal!  Served with garlic bread and a green salad.

VERY GOOD! Just a couple upgrades...I used a pound of bacon and almost 2 pounds of pasta. I put some spinach in the skillet and some in the pasta drainer to test both ways. It's good both ways. The strainer/colander spinach was just bland and wilted.  The skillet spinach absorbed bacon flavor, so I recommend the skillet spinach version. (Already putting in a pound of bacon, we're not exactly watching our figure here.) I added onions and garlic to the cooked/drained bacon. And at the end I added some cream to the skillet before dumping it over the pasta.  This was really good.

I made this a second time and made some changes to make it taste better.  I removed my bacon and added fresh tomatoes to the 1 tbsp garlic.  I boiled that down and then added a box of spinach.  2 minutes later I added the bacon back in.  I turned off the heat and added 1 cup of parmesan cheese.  Everyone ate it this time.  
This was my first review.  "Tasted better the second day.  Added parmesan to flavor it up."

This recipe turned out great, with one fairly major change on my part.  Mine is not a tomato-friendly household (neither of us can stand the things!) so I used a small jar of sliced roasted red peppers (drained) in place of the tomatoes.  I sprinkled some crumbled Feta cheese over the top just before serving and it was a great, light meal.  I also used this basic idea for a pasta side dish, except I used orzo in place of penne and I sliced the spinach chiffonnade-style to make the leaf size more suited to the pasta.  Great, versatile recipe!

I knew this recipe was a winner when my husband exclaimed, "Wow! This tastes like restaurant food!" It tastes very good the next day, stays moist and reheats well. Thanks for such a delicious and easy recipe that I'll be making over and over again.

Very good as is, however, in order to make it a less fattening, replace chicken broth for olive oil and bacon drippings and substitute bottled real bacon peices (not imitation) for fried bacon. Must splurge and top with parmesean cheese.

I took the bacon out when it was done cooking and then added it back in at the end so it would stay crispy.  Also, I wilted the spinach into the sauce and served with a bit of feta cheese sprinkled over the top.  Delicious!

Love it! We added fresh mushrooms and used whole wheat pasta. I don't usually eat cooked vegetables, but the spinach and tomatoes were just right. Highly recommend.

This is a great dish, and is so easy that it has replaced my default pasta dinner of spaghetti with ground beef in tomato sauce (you know, the dinner you make when you're too tired to think about cooking anything else!). 
I've also made this with pancetta and sweet italian sausage (crumbled & browned), and it is divine. 
To CALGRET1: I drain the bacon grease before adding the tomatoes.

For those who complained that this was watery... Don't sauté the spinach! Put it in a large colander & when the pasta in done, pour the hot pasta water & pasta over the spinach. This wilts it perfectly. Then toss with the rest of the ingredients. I served this with sautéed scallops. Yummy!

Family really liked it. I changed it a little and  added to it based on what I had. 

Step 1 the same except I timed it to be at the end so the pasta was hot.
Step 2 and step 3: Didn't use olive oil, didn't need to ...just heated the bacon ....cooked it till crisp...removed form pan chopped it small and put it in in big bowl.... left all bacon grease in pan.......added finely chopped red onions (1 cup) and 5 cloves of garlic finely copped to bacon grease in pan and sauteed till done....added to big bowl....threw spinach in hot pan with bacon grease and took off burner let sit then stirred to wilt just a little not to much and coat with remaining grease... then threw spinach in the bowl...chopped 25 grape tomatoes and threw them in bowl (never cooked these- i like them very fresh- the hot pasta cooks them a little)....added grilled chicken (grilled on outdoor grill brushed with balsamic vinegar and small amount of olive oil)...cut chicken into bite size pieces.....threw the chicken in the bowl....
drained 1 jar of artichokes and threw in bowl.....added cooked pasta...drained and threw it  hot into bowl with all the other ingredients and then tossed...added salt and pepper and sprinkled with parmesan cheese and then tossed again and served in low shallow bowls added another small sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Wonderful!

first shot was ok but a little...lacking?
second try i added one small onion, one small green pepper, dash or two of red pepper flakes, some basil, and didn't do the draining of pasta over spinich, it wilts just fine on it's own. Love the second version and will make it many times!

Delicious and easy, how could you ask for anything more?!  I had made this several times before and I always seem to forget to rate it (and make it often).  It is the perfect pasta dish if you want something fast, easy and tasty.  It is light and refreshing.  I do skip the olive oil and just use the bacon grease.  I top it with feta and a few kalamata olives, but it is good as is.  I can't wait for the summer to use fresh tomatoes.  Thanks Jean for sharing!

I used considerably less bacon and garlic (both were excessive as written) and a 5 oz. package of baby spinach. Beautiful and compatible ingredients.  Good, humble comfort food. Finished it with a good sprinkling of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

Really delicious and very easy for those quick, gotta get it on the table dinners. Used whole wheat penne, and tossed in some Kalamata olives at the end. Also added a little dried basil and oregano.

I'm giving this basic recipe a five for easy  prep versatility and flavor! You can do a lot with it and it turns out delicous! I added saute chicken tenders,  mushrooms and I used fresh romas  that were over  ripe with  some roasted red pepeprs that  I had already. I used  lots of garlic ,  chopped shallots, hot red pepper flakes,  and basil. I skipped the olive oil and used the  bacon fat  to cook it all in   -my bacon was  very lean, so not much  grease  from the bacon but it gave flavor. When it was served, I   sprinkled feta cheese and  fresh grated parmasan over the top. This will become a favorite dish>> thanks for sharing your recipe!

Awesome dish that really takes 25 minutes max to complete, great for a hectic weekday meal.  Just throw a crusty loaf of bread in the oven and you're set. I didn't change a thing and my entire family loved it, even my picky 6 & 9 year olds.  Not sure why people are using a whole pound of bacon, 6 slices is perfect and more would make the bacon grease overwhelming.  Also save the trouble of washing a bowl and just dump the pasta/spinach in the pan with the bacon/tomato mixture.  I may use pancetta instead of bacon next time add parm. cheese, but honestly this recipe is good as is.

KC* uses 8 oz. penne, 4 slices bacon, 10 oz. pkd frozen chopped spinach, 1 cup finely chopped onion, 3/4 cup dry white wine and 1 10 oz. container light Alfredo sauce.  Cook bacon, then onion in bacon drippings Add wine and stir to partly evaporate the wine.  Add drained spinach and alfredo to skillet.  Add pasta and bacon and mix. Parmesan would be good on this

This was fantastic and I don't know why!  Just basic ingredients came together in a delicious way.  Although I liked the idea of wilting the spinach in the colander by draining the pasta over it, in theory, it wasn't a good idea.  I used my biggest colander and it wasn't big enough for the pasta and the full bag of Fresh Express fresh spinach.  The pasta sat on top (I used linguine, btw, it's heft held up well with this dish) and crushed the spinach and I had trouble separating it from itself once it was wilted.  That's my only complaint.  I'll just toss it on the tomato mixture and cover for a minute next time to wilt it though.  NOTES to me:  Used 2 cans petite diced tomatoes, sauted chopped onions with the garlic, added Italian seasoning and/or oregano, added 1/3 cup skim milk.  Keeper file.

This dish was fantastic, but I did have to make some changes.  To cut down the fat I drained the bacon, but if you're not concerned with fat then don't because it tastes better with it. I also added salt, pepper and basil and oregano and then stirred in some parmesean cheese, just to give more flavour...yum. Lastly, you will want to drain the diced tomatoes slightly, unless you like watery pasta. totally agree with others that this keeps VERY well overnight, in fact it tasts WAY better the second day! Also was VERY quick!!!

Excellent recipe - I will definitely continue to make it.  I followed recipe with a couple of changes.  I did not add oil as it didn't seem necessary and I used Italian style stewed tomatoes instead of diced for more flavor.  I have also made this recipe with mild Italian sausage (with casings removed) instead of the bacon and was is wonderful.

AMAZING DISH!  My kids HATE veggies but they ate every bite.  I was even able to sneak in some sundried tomatoes and a handful of pinenuts.  I did use turkey bacon instead of regular so I had to use a little more olive oil.  I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh.

Two of my favorite foods, bacon and spinach. I used leftover spaghetti sauce instead of the diced tomatoes and this was great.

Giving it a 4 because I did make modifications to the recipe based on other member's reviews. Here are the changes I made... Cut bacon into pieces and fried in the pan.  No oil was required.  Cooked the bacon until crisp and removed from pan and allowed to drain on paper towels.  I removed most of the oil from the pan and used the rest to cook some chopped onions and garlic.  Once the onions are garlic carmelized I added a large can of whole tomatoes with basil.  I crushed the tomatoes in the pan to create a chunky sauce.  I then added my whole leaf spinach and allowed to cook and wilt in the sauce.  Finally I added the bacon back to the mixture and cooked a few minutes longer.  I served over the penne pasta and topped with grated parmesean cheese.  It was a hit with the boyfriend and I will definatley be making this again!  Great easy pasta recipe!

Love this recipe.  My entire family loved it.  This was our summer dish.  I added two large cans of dices tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano in it instead of one 14.5oz can.  I did use the spices called for in recipe as well.  We prefer a bit more juice to a sauce.  I also use turkey bacon which is good, but real bacon is better.  Sooo easy to  make and it's really good leftover as a cold pasta side, if there are any leftovers.

This recipe is going into my top 10 favorite pasta recipes with some modifications. I followed others advice and added onions, sauteed with the spinach. Then I added several colors of chopped bell peppers toward the end of the saute portion of the recipe, along with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. In addition, I substitute penne with a small sea shell pasta for a little fun. Not only is the dish taste great, it is very vibrant in color and texture.

This was a nice simple weeknight meal. I cheated and used the OM pre-cooked bacon, but other than that I followed the recipe.  Nothing outstanding, but a solid weeknight meal.  Even Mr. LTH enjoyed it and went back for seconds.  I wasn't as big of  a fan, but it was still good (I am wondering if it was because of the weird bacon...).  I have to give it a "5" (even though I think it was a "4" as made my way) because I'm pretty sure it would have been way better w/"real" bacon and it's not the recipe's fault I'm lazy.

This was a great recipe.  My family (husband and three kids 2 - 8yrs) enjoyed it as well. I used fresh tomatoes.  Yum!

This is a great recipe for a dish that is not too heavy.  Just make sure you follow the directions...I forgot to chop of the bacon before cooking it and ended up making a mess when it was already covered in garlic and then had to chop it.  This dish is great and I will make it again!  Thanks

I modified a few things cause some reviewers said it was bland  or too mushy; 1.) I used 16oz box of penne  2.) I used 2 cans 14.5oz diced tomatoes 3.) I used white pepper on the drained pasta to taste ( and regular salt on the boiled pasta) 4.) I used 1 lb. of fried bacon and reserved the bacon drippings aside in a bowl. After I fried the bacon and boiled the pasta and washed the spinach and shredded it, I set all 3 aside seperately.  I used fresh clean pot and added 1T oil and 1 T butter and let that come up to a heat melting butter and then added 2 cans diced tomato and 1 T onion powder and mixed real well with the minced garlic.  Then I added the shredded spinach (cause others said it got too wilty if draining pasta over it) and I mixed well, then I added the pasta and mixed well again, all the while over low med heat.  And then I added the reserved bacon oil all over this final product.   Wow, was it awesome, my husband who hates, hates, hates vegetables ate this all up!  While I was making it he kept saying it smelled wonderful.  I served this with a french bread and sprinkled mozzarella on the pasta dish.  So fantastic!    Thanks for posting! (Even though I modified it a little, I could not have done it without you! :-) )

This was fantastic! As usual for me, I made a few changes. In place of tomatoes,I tried chopped roasted red pepper. About 1 Tbs. of butter,1/2c. evaporated milk and a little crushed red pepper finished it off. Wonderful...very easy to add your own special touch :)

We have a similar recipe only we use linguine pasta.  Instead of spinach we add green and black olives, minced garlic, and mushrooms (canned or fresh) to the cooked bacon sauteed together for a few minutes. Then add that to the cooked drained linguine with olive oil.  Then we add fresh sliced tomatoes(roma, cherry or campri are best) and a lot of chopped green onions mixed in and then top with parmesan cheese to our liking.

This was very good, easy, and the feta on top made it wonderful.  Both kids asked for seconds.  I used precooked bacon, no olive oil, and fried it up just long enough to grease the pan, then added garlic, for one minute, then tomatoes.

So quick to make and so lovely to eat! We really enjoyed this. Followed the recipe exactly, but wilted the spinach with the bacon, as others have done. Would be great with parmesan sprinkled on top and some garlic bread on the side. Will remember this for summer evenings when we feel like something light and quick.

This was fantastic...it was easy to make, I didn't have fresh spinach...but I had some I made yesterday, so I used that, I wouldn't hesitate to used frozen either. I didn't have a can of tomatoes, so I used fresh.  I used the microwaveable bacon..I added a little more Olive Oil too.I also added black pepper, the bacon takes care of the salt very nicely. We sprinkled some Parmesian cheese to finish...It's addicting. Substitutions are easy, I dont think you can ruin this one..My husband is picky...he ate it and went back for more. My son raved about it. This is now one meal I will keep on my list of favorites...It looks beautiful also..very nice to serve for last minute guests...I just made a salad and everyone was happy...especially me because it was easy and quick besides delicious. Thanks to Superman's mom for sharing a great recipe.

This is a great quick meal to whip up at short notice and is pretty healthy too. I always use turkey bacon instead (less greasy), and petite-cut canned tomatoes (less chunky).  Add some mushrooms when you saute the garlic, for a bit of extra texture & flavor.  Delicious!

This was so easy and absolutely delicious!  I did add some sauted onions and mushrooms.  I also used turkey bacon so I did need to add the olive oil.  The family raved about it!  This dish is definitely going into the bi-weekly rotation!   Thank you!

Made recipe once as written, then again with some minor changes. (star rating is "as written). This will become a go to recipe in my home. As written it's a really good recipe, nearly as easy to make as regular spaghetti. The changes I made were to add sliced mushrooms (sauteed after cooking the bacon) and red pepper flakes (added after adding the tomatos). This is really good with whole wheat pasta as well.

I would suggest keeping the cooked bacon out of the tomato mixture until serving.  Also more garlic.  I didn't like how the bacon softened.  Other than that it was okay.  My family liked it better than I did.

A bit plain for me as is. Added some feta and crushed red pepper and liked it much better. Only other change was using fresh tomatoes instead of canned.

I always have such high hopes for these 5 star recipes and they usually don't quite turn out to be 5 stars for me, but this is one is exceptional.  It lives up to its 5 stars.  It was delicious and my 2 picky kids loved it too - that's saying something!  I'll be passing this one on to friends.  Thank you!!!

I really wanted to like this recipe because it has all of my favorite ingredients.  However, it just did not come together for me. It did not mix well and the flavor was missing something.  Will not try this one again.

Quick and yummy lunch!  I used a 16 oz. box of penne, so I added a 5.5 oz. can of V-8 juice for added liquid. My tomatoes were the seasoned kind and it worked quite well. I did saute the fresh spinach in with the bacon and garlic before adding the tomatoes. I added some sea salt, coarse ground black pepper and served with a sprinkle of parm on top. I enjoyed this  for a lunch, and will add some scallions, grape tomatoes, fresh mushrooms and shrimp or chicken to serve for a dinner the next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good! I added Canadian bacon to make it a main dish without adding so much fat. It was all eaten quickly; thanks for a good recipe! (I also used whole wheat egg noodles.)

This was excellent. I made some changes, I drained all but about 1 tsp of bacon fat.  Cooked the spinach in with the garlic and tomatoes.  Also added a pinch of crushed red pepper and at the end some ground black pepper.  I sprayed the pasta with some olive oil to keep from sticking, but omitted all the oil called for.  It didn't need it.  There was only a spoonful left!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was good.  I plan to make this again, but next time I will add some fresh basil, red onion and parmesan cheese.  I think that will turn it into a wow recipe for me.  Additionally, this was an easy 30 mintute complete meal for a weeknight.

Update:  I just made this for the second time.  Added sauted red onion and basil this time and it was perfect.

This is very tasty and filling just the way it is or you can add various ingredients as others have stated.  Besides being a favorite at home we have also fixed this when we're in our RV and on the road.

This is an excellent side for chicken or fish.  i recommend using fresh tomatoes instead of canned and a little butter for more flavor.  Make sure to toss in some seasoning like basil or oregano.  Without it, this tends to be a little bland.

this took me just 20 minutes to make - so easy!  I did sprinkle fresh parmesan on it and also drained part of the bacon grease but then used the remainder to wilt my spinach like another person recommended.  I didn't end up using olive oil at all.  I also used fresh roma tomatoes instead.

Five stars for quick, easy, and flavorful!  I used whole wheat penne and omitted the first TBS of olive oil.  I also drained most of the fat from my bacon.  Instead of using a serving bowl, I just put the pasta/spinach back into the large skillet I had cooked the bacon in and served it from there.  Used about half a bag of ready-washed baby spinach.  Loved it!

I made this last night and my fiancee thought it was so good. I liked it because it was easy and had a lot of flavor. I improvised a little bit and used mini penne pasta, turkey bacon and added a big spoonful of sundried tomatoes, sliced mushrooms and grilled chicken. Very yummy!

Great recipe. Try it with white wine and pancetta (Italian bacon) instead of regular bacon.

This recipe was phenomenal! We used diced tomatoes with sweet onions and topped with a bit of parmesan cheese. I also drained the pan after cooking the bacon so that only a very small bit of bacon grease was left in the pan. Less calories, but still a great bacon taste. This will be going into our dinner regular rotation.

Absolutely fantastic and easy to make. Got asked for the recipe from a few friends too! Made one batch minus the bacon for a vegetarian friend. It was good but still missing a bit of flavor in my opinion

I'm giving this 5 stars for taste and how easy it was to make.  There is a lot of flavor here for so few ingredients.  The only change I made was to not use the oil.  Next time I will add fresh basil to it.  Thanks for sharing Jean.

Excellent dish! I subbed garlic and onion powders for the garlic (my stomach can't handle full-strength garlic). My husband didn't like the smell of it cooking, but devoured at least two full bowls, and then the left-overs. It was delicious!

Loved this recipe. Cooked bacon, drained and then added garlic and a medium onion sliced very fine. Sauted for a couple fo minutes and then added about 2 tsp italian seasoning and 2 cans of tomatos for extra sauce. As tomatos heated stired in spinach and then as others suggested added 1 cup of parmesan cheese. Tossed pasta with sauce and my husband and I both agreed we would be hard pressed to find something this good at a restaurant.

Delicious! I didn't use the olive oil. First cooked the bacon (about 7 or 8 pieces), then set the grease aside and used as needed. I sauteed onion, garlic and mushrooms, then added the spinach, then the tomatoes & feta cheese, which gave it a nice touch. Definitely a keeper!

I fixed this for dinner tonight and it was really good.  I did drain some of the bacon grease and sauted about 1/2 cup diced onion with the garlic but other than that followed the recipe to a T.  My husband liked it so that is a plus.  I will definitely make this again.  It still needs a little something...maybe some kind of cheese or some spices for more flavor...so I will experiment.

Pretty good. The only thing I did different was use wheat penne pasta. I am one who very rarly (almost NEVER) salts my food, but this needed a bit of salt added to it. It was a little bland. I never would have guessed that a recipe with bacon would have needed salt added. Over all good and I will make this again.

This was very quick and simple to prepare.  I did add additional ingredients to give this dish even more flavor!  In place of the canned tomatoes I used chopped sun dried tomatoes in oil, cut up red roasted peppers and added grated fresh parmesan before serving.  Next time I will use turkey bacon in place of regular.

Very good, and easy to make. I had everything on hand, except the spinach. I used green beans, because that's the only green veggie I had on hand. I know it sounds weird, but it was actually pretty tasty.  I used radiatori instead of penne, because that's what I happened to have. I also added basil, garlic salt and topped it with grated parmesan. **update** 6/5/08 ** I made this again but this time exactly as written. My husband said the bacon grease made him feel 'nasty'. I think I must have drained the bacon the first time I made it because he liked it then.

A great quick recipe to use fresh garden bounty.  I used two large beefsteak tomatoes chopped instead of the canned tomatoes, topped with fresh grated Romano cheese and crusted sourdough toast.

This was quick, simple, fresh tasting and delicious. I prepared this recipe as written with the exception of added Feta cheese and loved it. It's great as is, but has endless possibilities for variations. This is ranking high in my favorite pasta recipe collection.

Oh my Gosh!  This was fabulous!  My fiance and I had leftover pasta from lasagna and leftover fresh spinach and this was amazing!  I just cut up the lasagna and heated it (I wilted the spinach with plain boiling water).  I also used diced tomatoes seasoned with Garlic, Basil, & Oregano and took another reviewer's advice and topped it with feta (I used garlic & herb flavored crumbles).  There was barely any left for me to bring to work today because we ate so much!!!

This was great.  I used turkey bacon (twice the amount) and added crab (imitation- 6oz), crushed red pepper, and some other spices to flavor it up.  I wilted the spinach in the bacon pan before cooking the sauce, and skipped the olive oil altogether. Next time I will make sure I have some fresh basil on-hand, and I will add a small can of tomato sauce, but it was great as is, with some parm cheese sprinkled on top.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I have made it twice.  I used Canadian Bacon to make it even healthier and added grated Parmesan Cheese and pine nuts.  This recipe is a great starting off place for many variations!  I'd like to try it with shrimp and chicken and other vegetables.  Thanks for a quick easy recipe.

FANTASTIC RECIPE!  My only changes were in amounts...I used a whole pound of bacon (grease drained), a 16oz. box of Rigatoni and 2 cans of garlic and olive oil diced tomatoes!  My husband has been telling everyone we see about this dinner!  It was SO fast and easy to prepare and my 1 and 3 year old kids loved it too!  This is a keeper...can't make a mistake!  THANK YOU for sharing it!!!!

I got this recipe the other day and had to try it.  It was fantastic!  My three year old grandson ate it, all of it including the spinach.  My husband kept going back for more and my daughter loved it also, which is saying a lot.  The only thing I did differently was used seasoned diced tomatoes instead of just plain.  I believe I used the oregano, basil and garlic, since I could not find the Italian seasoned.  Spectacular!  Not only does it taste good but is easy to make.

OMG this is soooo good! The flavor's blend so well it's amazing. Like most other people I added to the recipe according to our tastes and what I had on hand. Hubby had seconds and would have eaten more if his stomach would have allowed. I used spiral noodles because it's what I had on hand. I also sauted an onion, some diced green bell peppers, 1 1/2 tsp. minced garlic (from a jar) in a little bacon grease until onions were clear. Then I added a jar of diced artichoke hearts, my diced cooked bacon and I partially drained two jars of my home canned tomatoes and added them as well and seasoned with some salt and pepper. I simmered this until my noodles were tender. Meanwhile I washed and rinsed a whole bag of fresh spinach then added them to my simmering vegetable mixture and turned the stove off.  Once the noodles had been drained I mixed it all together and the spinach wilted perfectly just from the heat of both the vegetables and the noodles. Added more salt and pepper to taste. Next time I'm going to also add some sliced fresh mushrooms. I can see that this would also be good adding some diced roast chicken in it too. We tried it with and without added parmesan cheese on top and we liked it better without the cheese. Thanks Jean for sharing this wonderful recipe with the rest of us.

So easy and so delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and had no complaints... Husband and 19 month old loved it too! It's more of light pasta even though it has bacon in it but still filling... Anything with bacon in it is great in our family! " keep calm & eat bacon. "

I really liked this recipe.  I took some of the advice of other posts and used a whole pound of bacon, added an onion to the garlic, and added the spinach to the tomato mixture to wilt it down so it absorbed the flavor.  I thought it was really good and will definitely make this again.

Easy peasy! Used slightly more bacon than the recipe called for, added in a chopped onion and used 16 oz of penne and a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes. Also sprinkled some basil in the sauce and mixed baby spinach right in. Served with French bread and parmesan cheese. Yum-o! Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  I didn't much care for the spinach; I prefer spinach raw.  Overall though it had good flavor and was really easy to make. (Must have been because it's the 1st time my fiance hasn't completed hated something I've cooked in the last week & half.)  I almost forgot the tomato, though.  Once I had it all tossed together, I threw in 1/2 a fresh tomato since I had it on hand and it needed used.

Wow.  This was great.  I used thick pepper bacon and added more than the recipe called for.  Since I used extra bacon I took some of the bacon grease out.  Unfortunately extra bacon makes extra grease.  For the pasta I used Barilla Plus Penne Pasta.  I served it with garlic bread and passed a grater and block of Parmesan Reggiano around the table.

Super easy and delicious! Nice break from tomato-based sauces. I first used the specified amount of bacon but halved most everything else as the quantities seemed off balance, and ended up cooking another batch right away (it really feeds about 2-3 hungry people). So I used a full bag of pre-washed fresh baby spinach and a total of 1 lb. of bacon for the full recipe. I cooked the bacon until super crisp so it crumbled, to extend it, and drained nearly all the fat off before sauteing the garlic, too. The recipe doesn't specify seasonings, but salt/pepper and red pepper flakes were all that it needed. Can't wait to make this again and adapt it with other leafy greens/proteins.

I love this recipe!  I've been making it for a couple of years now, just haven't rated it.  I agree with some of the other cooks and wait until serving to add the bacon.  This is still one of my 5 year old daughter's favorites!  Thanks for sharing!

I added 2 tablespoons of oregano to boost the flavor a bit. I used 12 oz. of bacon and added Parmesan cheese on top. Delicious and a great way to get kids to eat spinach.  No leftovers!

This really is an excellent simple recipe with a lot of room to customize to taste.  I couldn't resist tweaking to add some spice (via fiesta style chiles) and I deglazed the pan with some white wine.  Also, I don't see the need for the olive oil since you're using bacon (in fact, I drained off much of the bacon fat).  My husband who usually isn't crazy about pasta had seconds and asked for the leftovers for lunch the next day.

Gave this four stars because although it was very good, it didn't totally blow me away like some of the other recipes on this site. 
With that said, this is a great recipe, especially when you are running low on time! I will definitely make it again (maybe with a few alterations).

I used Turkey bacon and followed the recipe. Pouring the hot pasta over the spinach in the colander is a great way to wilt it. I put some grated parmesean over each serving and it was quite tasty!  I can see where adding mushrooms, or onion or other seasonings could be successful!

This was good, but needed some flavor. I used precooked bacon slices. I added the garlic in with the tomatoes and simmered them a bit.  Just before serving I threw in the spinach to let it wilt.  I also added a couple of dashes of red pepper flakes, a little salt and pepper, and Italian style cheese blend on the top. THEN it was really yummy!! I could eat the tomato/bacon mixture all by itself :)  Thank you for the recipe!!

I added mushrooms and some onion and didn't put the cooked bacon back in until the end, so it stayed crunchy.  Completely skipped the oil, since the bacon grease was more than enough, and added a few dashes of Italian seasoning.  It was very good!  A light taste easily adjusted for individual preferences.  It's a keeper.

This dish is amazing!  I made it according to the recipe, and topped with mozzarella cheese.  Boyfriend and I agreed it was a hit!  Would love to play with the ingredients, since it's so simple to put together, but the basic recipe is just delicious!

This is a simple but delicious recipe.  We used a whole package of bacon and cooked that well.  Then we sauteed some minced garlic and then put in some fresh mushrooms, fresh asparagus tips, and two cans of diced tomatoes (did not drain the tomatoes) in the left over bacon grease.  After those ingredients had cooked for a couple of minutes we added in the fresh chopped spinach and let that wilt.  Finally we added in some fresh chopped basil.  Lots of beautiful colors and wonderful flavor!

Giving it a four b/c if I had made it according to the directions, it would've been too bland and greasy for my taste. I used bowtie pasta since that's what I had, diced tomatos with garlic, basil and oregano, sprinkled some red pepper flakes and added some leftover grilled chicken breast. It was really delicious and I will definitely make it again! Thanks for an interesting dish :)*** I didn't mention the changes I made in my original review, so here goes. I didn't use any olive oil and drained most of the bacon drippings from the pan before adding all the other ingredients. The juice from the canned tomatoes was saucy enough for the pasta.

Awesome, I followed the recipe and it tasted fantastic.  Here are some tips: Draining the pasta onto the spinach in the colander will wilt them fast but make the leaves stick together. I recommend heating the spinach in with the diced tomatoes.  Adding in a few more strips of bacon is fine, the pieces shrink and I found myself with only a few bits here and there.  You don't need any olive oil in the pan to fry the bacon, bacon will release a TON of grease which you should keep draining out of the frying pan.

Pretty good - would make again but probably cut down on the bacon or use turkey bacon. It tasted good but pretty unhealthy.

Thought this was really yummy, my mom agreed but my little brother said it was "too flavorful" - he's 15, go figure!!! I used 3 slices more of bacon and the tomatoes I used were marinated in garlic and basil. I also added some Italian blend cheese at the end - YUM!!!

I am rating this 4 stars as I made 2 changes that other reviewers suggested: 1) I used Italian style diced tomatoes and 2) Cooked the spinach with the tomato and bacon mixture rather than wilting with the noodles.  It was definitely 5 star with those changes.

All of my family really  liked this pasta dish - including my seven and 14 year old. I used whole grain pasta. I also baked the bacon and didn't use any bacon fat to cut some of the fat out of the recipe. I just used olive oil as called for, and it was fine. When I served the pasta, I put out some goat cheese, gorganzola and parmesan cheese. Everyone put a small spoonful of one or more cheeses on their pasta bowl. It was delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

This was so so good...added extra bacon but pretty much kept the same - good thing I made extra as not only did we have seconds - but thirds - it was that good!!!  Served with the toasted garlic bread and a green salad.

Made this last night for dinner and it was fantastic!  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except I used turkey bacon and omitted the tomatoes as I did not have any on hand.  Topped this with some fresh parmesan cheese and served with crusty bread.

I think this was a really good recipe.  It just lacked a little seasoning in my opinion.  I added extra salt and pepper, but still will probably adjust a little more next time.  It definitely helped to serve a nicely marinated chicken breast on top.  The seasoning from that added to the pasta.   I wanted to give 4 1/2 stars, not 4 because we WILL make this again.  ooh, i sprinkled a little grated parmesan on top and it would be really good with a few toasted pine nuts!!!!

This was just okay. I used canned tomatoes and I think that might have been why I was not convinced by this recipe. If I ever make this again, I would use fresh tomatoes. Pouring the pasta water over the spinach turned out great!

Excellent flavor (even with frozen spinach)!  An inexpensive, but hearty meal that makes great leftovers!

I'm giving it a 5 because my husband is IN LOVE with this recipe. I made it two nights ago and he loved it so much he asked me to make it for the next night when we had company over. Then today he still wanted some of the leftovers! I made it exactly as is except I omitted the olive oil and put fresh parmesan on top.

Seems like this would be really greasy with the 2T olive oil, and not draining the bacon. I fried up the bacon, drained it, added tomatoes that already had oregano & garlic added, last step add spinach til wilted. Throw over whole wheat pasta with a bit of fresh parm. Really good & easy.

Very good but made some changes- a lot of them. Used 16 oz pasta (who uses only 12?) No olive oil- the bacon made enough grease. Increased bacon to 9 slices, was about 3/4 lb. We hate tomatoes so liked Katerinajb suggested, I used a jar of roasted red peppers. And I also used 1 bag of baby spinach. After the bacon was done cooking (dumped a little bit of the grease out but left a lot in) I sauteed the spinach in with the bacon & grease as Server33 suggested (we're not watching out figures either, lol). Added the red peppers to that & once heated tossed with the pasta. Served with Parmesan on top. Next time I will cut the garlic down to 1T & may try adding some red onion to saute with the bacon. This was very good, thanks for the recipe, sorry I changed so much.

This was good.  I added onions with the garlic and wilted the spinach in the pan.  I also used back bacon - trying to be healthier.  My husband and son loved it but I thought it was missing that streaky bacon "taste" - the saltiness and crispness. Next time I will use streaky bacon.

Yum, yum, yum!!  This was a huge hit!  It looked delicious and I needed to use up some bacon, so I gave it a try.  Funny thing is, hubby was tired of me trying new recipes (I think I'm becoming an allrecipes addict!), so I had to talk him into it, but he was raving about it in the end.  I LOVE that its so easy and only really required 5 ingredients - perfect "busy night" meal, and my family loved it!  Everyone went back for at least seconds.  Add a little "snow cheese" (my kids' term for parmesan cheese) to the top and its amazing!  This one very may become a staple recipe in our house.

It has always been my pet peeve when people give a recipe a rating/review based on changes they made to it. However, I'm guilty as well. I had to change this recipe because my fiance requested "MEAT!"--so I added chopped chicken breast meat to the bacon in the skillet. Also, I used Italian seasoned canned diced tomatoes--which I am glad I did. The dish was "ok" that night, but lacked real flavor. However it was VERY yummy the next day when I took it to work for lunch. I think that overnight in the fridge actually made this dish BETTER. I will more than likely make this dish again--however---using the changes I made.

Wow! This is yummy and light (despite the bacon). I used a little less pasta, more garlic and added fresh ground black pepper and a little crushed red pepper and some feta on top. Wilted the spinach in pan as others suggeted and drained off some of the fat from the bacon. Also, use a quality can tomato such as Glen Muir to best flavor.

This is a quick and easy under 30 minute meal.  The whole family liked it.  I sauteed the spinach with the bacon and garlic before adding the tomatoes.  We topped ours with sea salt, pepper, and shredded parmesean cheese.  Definitely will make again.

I MADE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND MY FAMILY SAID IT WAS AWESOME. I CUT THE PASTA BACK TO 1 LB.AND USED 12 BACON SLICES. I USED 6 CLOVES OF GARLIC AND ADDED SOME FRESH BASIL AS WELL AS 2 CANS DELMONTE PETTITE CUT TOMATOES. I POURED THE WATER AS WELL AS THE PASTA ON TOP OF THE SPINACH IN THE COLANDER AND MIXED IT AROUND A BIT TO WILT THE SPINACH AND IT WORKED JUST FINE. MY SKINNY FINICKY 21+ YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ATE 2 PLATES. I JUDGE MY RATINGS BY HER. WILL 100% MAKE AGAIN.

We LOVED this.  I read the reviews first and followed advice to wilt spinach in pan with garlic and bacon grease.  Used canned italian seasoned sliced roma tomatoes (basil and oregano seasoning was very tasty).   Used sprouted whole grain penne pasta which is kind of heavy but worked great with this recipe.   Feta cheese topping would have been perfect but I didn't have any.  Will try that next time.

Simple, delicious, and very inexpensive. Since I used a full 16oz. box of penne, I used 8 slices of turkey bacon and 3 cloves of garlic. I also didn't cook the bacon in oil; it turned out perfectly without it in a non-stick pan.

I had figured the dish would need something additional-- parmesan, oregano, etc., but I'm glad I tasted it first. I thought the bacon, tomatoes, garlic and spinach were a fine balance of flavors "as-is." I'll be making this again and again, and I passed the recipe along to a few relatives.

This recipe was awesome!  I did some tweaking according to some of the reviews...used fresh chopped tomatoes (about 3 medium) instead of canned...I also added about a tblsp of Tastefully Simple Italian Seasoning Blend, 2 more cloves of pressed garlic (my cloves were small), as well as a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  This recipe has endless possibilities!!!  I'm thinking some artichokes would make a really good addition.  My picky hubby loved this and said it tasted like something from a restaurant.  Kudos!!!

Delicious!  Something lighter than pasta and tomato sauce proper.  I did follow some suggestions:  added chicken to make it a meal (cooked in in the bacon grease MMMMMM), wilted the spinich with the drippings, fresh tomatoes since we have a farmers market down the street, and topped with fresh parmasean.  It's being added to the family cookbook!  I can honestly say Allrecipes.com has done more for my cooking than any of the tons of cookbooks I've collected -- I USE Allrecipes.com!

This was a great dish - quick, easy, cheap, and arguably healthy.  I did drain most of the bacon fat and wilted the spinich w/ the sauce.  I will definitely make again.

The meal would have been fantastic if you could taste anything over the 2 TABLESPOONS of garlic!  Stick to 2 cloves, learn from our pain :-) The addition of chilli and feta are nice. As is wilting the spinach in the pan - I can imagine it would taste nice with bacon flavor - all we had was overpowering GARLIC!

This one is definitely a "keeper".  But the next time I make this recipe I am going to fry the bacon and use the grease from it to saute my garlic and then wilt the spinach in that, too so it has the bacon flavor.  Then add the tomatoes.  I loved how easy this recipe is.  This pasta is even better the next day and not too bad cold (room temperature) either.  Thanks Superman's Mom for sharing it with us!  :)

This recipe definitely needed a little bit of tweaking.  I added sliced sausage and I doubled the amount of diced tomatoes.  I also added extra garlic and other italian spices.  After the few additions, my husband LOVED it and I would definitely make again.

Pretty good recipe.  Next time I will add more bacon and less tomatoes.  Also, instead of wilting the spinach with the pasta water, I sauteed it just until wilted in the bacon grease.  My hubby loved it.

This was really easy and delicious. I followed the recipe, except I added a bunch of fresh cherry tomatoes (cut in half) and stirred in feta cheese at the end. Topped with parmesan. Next time I might try turkey bacon for a healthier alternative.

I make a variation of this recipe.  I use steamed broccoli instead of the spinach.  I cook bacon, remove, drain and crumble.  After cooking garlic and tomatoes, I add the crumbled bacon and steamed broccoli and toss all with penne pasta, served with a sprinkle of Parmesan or Feta cheese, (depending on what I have on hand).  Served with a green salad and hot French bread, you have a complete, quick, easy and nutritious meal that have people coming back for second helpings.  Great for informal get togethers!

I would give this recipe 5 stars only if served with feta cheese crumbled over, as suggested by a previous reviewer - a delicious combination. Some freshly milled black pepper and a bit of freshly grated parmesan is nice too.

Wonderful. The aroma from just cooking this made the whole family hungry. Awesome with a seasoned chicken breast.

Generally I like to first make a recipe as written for a fair rating.  But this time after reading all the reviews and suggestions I decided to make changes as I had most of the additions on hand.  I added mushrooms, basil, a dash of cayenne pepper and small onion.  I held out some of the basil and bacon and topped the dish along with some parm. cheese.  With all these changes it was beyond 5 stars!!!!  So I figured w/o all these changes it would still be 5 stars.  Thanks Jean Tagliere for a great recipe that my husband and I enjoyed so much.

very good but even better using fresh grape tomatoes halved instead of the canned ones and a liberal sprinkling of freshly grated reggiano parmesan cheese. I increased the bacon to half a pound and used a little Hellmanns mayo as well to make it all bind a bit and make it creamier.  did not try adding the onion as some have done but can see how that would be a good addition.
a very pretty side as well.

We liked this. Since I don't care for canned or fresh tomatoes, I used sun dried.  I also added some low fat half and half and sautéed spinach with bacon after the bacon was cooked, as others suggested.

My husband had thirds! And took the leftovers for lunch the next day. I made a few changes; I added an onion to the garlic and tomatoes and used pre-cooked bacon instead. Since I didn't have bacon grease I used chicken broth and a spoonful of butter to cook the onions in.  I also did not drain the pasta over the spinach.  I added the spinach directly to the sauce at the last minute with the crumbled bacon and tossed it with the pasta immediately.  I also added fresh parsley, basil and oregano to the onions when they were cooking. It was delicious!  Definitely making this again!

Very delicious! I didn't make this bacon instead I just added red roasted peppers with the tomatoes and tossed a little pesto into the pasta. I also added a little oregano herbs into the tomatoes and peppers.

This was a great easy recipe. We altered it by chopping up an onion, and some mushrooms. Roasted some Brussel sprouts  and added them at the end. Nice hearty meal for low cost.

Made this tonight with my picky eaters and they all had happy plates.  I did not change a thing and we loved it.  I can see adding other veggies or other items but the appeal of this meal was the simplicity for me.  Didn't take any time to prepare so was great for our busy schedules!

I really liked this dish but I have a husband and 2 teenage sons and all three thought it was a side dish. I followed the recipe exactly, great flavor. I guess it's just not filling enough for a meat and potatoes kind of person. I will make again but will have as a pasta salad instead of a main dish.

A family favorite!  I use almost a pound of bacon and a whole box of penne with two cans of diced tomatoes for my large family.  I add shaved parmesean at the end and then offer it to sprinkle at the table.   This is sooo good!

We loved it - we even added in some mushrooms and some fresh basil the second time around to give it our own twist. 

I think a lot of the low reviews saying "Noodle heavy" you're not looking at how much you're adding, you see 1 Bag and assume it's 12oz, while MOST pasta is actually sold in 2-3x that quantity. Please be careful when you are measuring things. We do 1/2 of a 900g bag of pasta which is just over the 12oz. And don't drain your bacon. I know what you're thinking - just don't. You lose a lot of flavour doing that. You don't need to add anything into your bacon to cook it. Bacon + pan + low heat. It won't stick, you won't need to add oil because as it heats up the fat cooks out. Then when you add in everything else it blends and mixes. The bacon ended up being so tender and everything was wonderful. 

I agree with other reviewer. You can't complain about a recipe if you've changed most of it to your taste.

Im giving the recipe 4 stars as wrote but with a few minor changes it's easily a 5 star recipe! I add onion with the garlic and I also add Italian seasoning and then I add the spinch to the bacon and tomatoes to wilt it that way. We like to add a bit of parmesan cheese to the top. You can serve this as a meal or as a side dish. And it goes well with Chicken,  fish, pork, and beef!

This is a great recipe for a quick, relatively healthy meal.  I deleted the olive oil altogether and cut back on the amount of pasta; it came out great.  A must add:  Parmesan cheese!  Thanks, Jean.

This was a huge hit at my house :) Just made little changes, cook the bacon first and emptied the drippings, cooked the spinach in with the oil, garlic and tomato, added some mushrooms and sprinkled with some parmesan. Gosh this was really good :D

OMG!! This is easy, yummy, and cheap to make..I did use the whole pound of bacon, chopped fresh tomatoes (6 romas), and I didn't have any spinach on hand..so I left it out...GREAT dish!!  It went really well with the London Broil I bar-b-qued!
Thanks so much.

Tried this one out tonight.  It was sooooooo good!  Even my picky eaters scarfed it down!  I did 9 slices of bacon instead of 6, and 16 oz of pasta.  I also mostly drained the bacon and removed the bacon, garlic, tomato and then cooked the spinach in that pan before tossing it all together, rather than wilting the spinach with the pasta water.  I think this might be good with or in addition to chicken, or even add some mushrooms, and/or peas.  Might even be good with Tuna or Salmon.  Or, you could even add to the bacon, or replace it, with canellini (white kidney) beans.

I've made this several times and love it every time. I go ahead and use the whole pound of bacon... the more the better. I also throw in a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese at the end.

This recipe was awesome! I varied a bit with ingredients by using Italian sausage instead of bacon, added some finely minced shallot to the garlic and threw quite a few artichokes in their oil instead of using the second tbs of olive oil. Once it was all combined I topped with an Italian cheese blend I had in the fridge, covered the pan and let it melt. The whole meal was finished in 15 minutes!! Thanks for a fabulous inspiration and idea!! Looked and tasted like something I slaved over, this one is going in the books!

This was a nice change from the usual pasta and sauce dishes I usually make.  Next time, I will add two cans of tomatoes because mine cooked down very quickly and left the pasta bit dry for my taste.  I added shrimp also because i wanted a protein included. A nice dinner overall, which I will make again.  Maybe I'll add sun-dried tomotoes too!

It's good. Per reviews, it is light. It is extremely easy to make. It's garllicy. If you don't about garlic, you'd need to reduce the amount. I liked it fine where my husband loved it.

This was a FAST, EASY recipe, and it tasted terrific. I dont usually change things on a recipe but I will admit, I doubled the tomatoes and bacon. I couldnt get over how well the flavors blended. I will be making this one again. Toss a salad, grab some bread, and theres dinner! It was like I was a gourmet chef!

This recipe called for way too much garlic! Other than that it was fine, but the extra strong garlic taste kind of ruined it.

I made this exactly as recipe states except used spaghetti noodles instead of the penne.  I thought it was bland and definitely could have used some seasoning.  It was disappointing...

Used 1/2 regular, 1/2 whole wheat pasta.  It made the whole wheat a little more appetizing (I'm not a whole wheat pasta fan).  Also used real tomatoes.  Lastly, I added a good sprinkle of feta cheese.  It really added a whole new dimension to the dish.  Without it, it would have been lacking flavor.

My husband who will usually eat anything put in front of him was only tempted once. After that it was "no thanks" highly unusual, I didn't think it was that bad. Stuck to the recipe and made no changes. Anyway, maybe it was too bland and should have added more spices.

I only review if I don't change anything.  This was easy and nice and light.  My husband thought it needed meat in order to feel full so he diced up some cooked chicken in his.  The bacon added nice flavor, but isn't exactly a heart healthy choice.  I used whole grain pasta as well.  Next time I think I'll use fresh diced tomatoes to lower the sodium content.  Otherwise, a super week night meal the whole family enjoyed!

Just okay.  I used tips from others and added mushrooms & onions to the bacon grease and garlic before the tomatoes.  I also added grilled chicken to the mixture.  It was just lacking something.  We added a lot of salt and Parmesan cheese when we ate, it helped.  It should be noted that my husband REALLY liked it!

This recipe is good and couldn't be easier.  I omitted the olive oil, because the bacon rendered plenty of fat, and I just wilted the spinach in the skillet with the bacon and tomatoes.

This is so yummy and easy!!!
The only thing I added was after frying the bacon, I left the grease in the pan and added chicken strips which have give the chicken more flavor and make the meal more hearty!!

Very good!  I used pre-cooked bacon and just "refried/reheated" it, so there wasn't as much bacon grease flavoring but still tasted like bacon.  I wilted some of the spinach with the pasta, poured everything back into the pan, and then wilted a bit more spinach with it.  Topped it all off with parmesan and it was yummy!

I live in China right now and most of the recipes on this site are hard to make because I can't find the ingredients here. BUT, with this recipe I finally was able to find most of the ingredients (substituted canned tomatoes for cherry tomatoes), it was quick and easy to prepare and I had a meal in less than 1/2 hour! I also could not find penne pasta, so I substituted for spaghetti. Just as good. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Wonderful!   This one is a keeper!  Purposely got diced tomatoes with italian seasonings.  Just chopped up the bacon (7 pieces) after it had cooled a little, but still sauted the garlic and then the tomatoes, juice and all, in the bacon grease.  THEN added the chopped bacon and poured it over the pasta/spinach mixture.  Be sure to drain your  pasta water over the spinach (used a bag of baby spinach leaves) already placed in a colander.  It wilts it perfectly.  Topped each serving with some shredded parmesan cheese.  A  light but very tasty side....not a lot of ingredients and very easy and quick to prepare!  NOTE:  My box of pasta was 16 oz so make sure you use only the 12 ounces or the flavor might not be as it should be.

Drained most of bacon grease.  Sauted onion with garlic, added sliced mushrooms to tomatoes, then the spinach.  After adding the cooked pasta, added the crispy bacon back in and topped with feta cheese.  Black olives on the side or on the fingers of the kids.  Husband, 3 kids and I really enjoyed this and will make again.

Fast and fabulous.  I didn't have any bacon so I substituted in prosciutto instead.  Still turned out amazing.  I also mixed the spinach with the sauce mixture instead of straining the pasta over it.

We all loved it, even my son who isn't a fan of spinach. I did like some others and didn't use the olive oil since the bacon had enough moisture.

Followed recipe plus a few extra pieces of bacon, and this was fabulous!!  I used an entire 7 oz container of baby spinach and didn't bother tearing it up, wilting process takes care of it for you.  My two young girls LOVED it.  Yum.

I added walnuts and feta cheese........so good!  I did drain the excess bacon fat off, but allowed some for flavor.  I used veggie pasta, whatever amount I figured I could eat in a meal and had two small-med frozen tomatoes I cooked in..:)  I guess I used this recipe as a basic to build to my own needs and loved it!

This is 5 star if you drain off the fat after the bacon is cooked.  Not sure if that a step everyone would just assume but I took one look at the volume of fat and drained it off before adding the garlic.  I think all that fat would ruin the dish.  With that one change this is unbelievably delicious for something so simple.

This was a fabulous quick meal!  Only variation was with can of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano mixed in it instead of plain diced tomatoes.  When I served it in bowls, my husband added crumbled blue cheese which was fabulous!!  Will definitely add it into our dinner rotation.  Love this site for helping us 'normal' people be better cooks. Thanks for this recipe Jean!!

Great!  I used the whole package of bacon (just because it would have gone to waste otherwise).  That's the only change I made.  Husband and I both loved it.  Quick and easy.

I made with whole wheat penne, and used a pound of bacon as other reviewers suggested.  I don't think a whole pound of bacon is necessary (or very healthy), so next time I will use less.  I did also add about 1 1/2 tsp of ital. seasoning with the spinach into the tomato mixture, and next summer we will try it with fresh basil from the garden.  I put in 2 large handfuls of fresh baby spinach, and wish I had thrown in one more...other than that, even my picky 13-yr old had 2nds!!!

I sauted the spinach in the bacon grease and added feta cheese to make it a little more of a greek pasta which added that much more flavor I think.  Either way it is a great recipe.

I made this as written other than adding an onion to the pan when the bacon was almost cooked.  I tried it after it was done and ended up adding some parmesan cheese as topping because it needed a little extra flavour. If I make this again I would add some mushrooms with the bacon and fresh italian herbs at the end (basil would go great with this). This is a great base recipe that you can add things to and make it your own. Plus, it's quick and easy so it's a good middle of a busy week meal.

Followed some other reviewers and added extra bacon.  Wilted the spinach in with the bacon and let it cook with the tomato mixture. Added a splash of cooking cream at the end and added some fresh parmesan to melt in.  Amazing. Hubby was licking the pan clean when I asked him to do dishes!   Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

My husband and I did not like this at all. I drained a little over half of the bacon grease but it still tasted like grease instead of anything else. Will not make again.

Simple and delicious.  Made mine with bow ties since that is what I had on hand. Love the idea of just wilting the spinach with hot pasta.

Basic and tasty. Didn't have penne on hand, so I used macaroni. I used 3 cloves of garlic and my man isn't a big fan of fresh spinach, so when I put the noodles into the boiling water, I added the spinach to the tomato mix. By the time all was ready, the spinach was nice and soft. I also added some chicken broth and a dash of white wine to add some flavour and more liquid.

Delicious! My two year old declared: I am not gonna like it! as he finished his entire meal. I made two changes. I had no olive oil so after adding the garlic I added a dab of butter, I also used frozen chopped spinach. I added it after the tomatoes. It came out beautifully!

I'm not a smurf but this is my customization... I added 4 T chicken broth, 2 T white wine,  several good shakes of red pepper flakes. Half the pasta, used Filei, and topped with 1/2 cup of Panko crumbs toasted and tossed with 1/2 cup Parm.  I had some of the cold  leftovers for lunch today, delish as a pasta salad.

This is a great recipe. I did change it a little though. I used marinara sauce instead of the diced tomatoes, italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, real bacon bits (which have less fat) and added some rotisserie chicken. I mixed all of it and once the sauce was simmering I added the spinach (the whole leaves, no chopping) waited until wilted and added the pasta. Once served I sprinkled some parmesan on top. This was amazing!!!! I'll definitely make it again!

I made this exactly as recipe stated.  I understand the first reviewers comment about not judging fairly, as judging based on changes so my rating is for the original recipe, exactly as stated.   I found it to be bland, missing something.  I didn't want to throw it all out, so I tried to save it.  I poured most of the bacon grease out of the skillet and then wilted the spinach.  I used about 3/4 lb. of bacon, and then added a little mayonnaise to the finished pasta.  It was almost like a BLT pasta!  With the changes I made, I would give it 5 stars.

I wasn't very impressed by this, won't make it again. I had to slowly plow through this entire batch for my lunch all week so it wouldn't go to waste. No one in my family would eat it.  I followed the directions exactly. Sprinkling w/Parmesan cheese is definitely helpful to do on this one.

This was really good.  Personally, there was way too much bacon and pasta for the amount of sauce.  Next time I think I will reduce the amount of bacon and add it at the end so it remains crispy.  In order to make this a more complete meal for my bf, I added cubed chicken that was sauteed in EVOO, salt and pepper.

My husband loved this! But I on the other hand thought it was kind of bland, even with my tweeking of adding garlic powder, crushed black peppercorn and salt. Maybe next time I will add black olives...I am not sure.

I wouldn't call this "gourmet" but it was definitely delicious!!  I followed the recipe as is, except for wilting my spinach right in the tomato mixture before adding the pasta.  It helped with flavor and wilted just fine.  I also topped with grated parmesan/romano.  Halved the recipe and it was perfect for two of us.  Great recipe!

Very tasty, easy to make, and light (perfect for a hot summer meal).  Next time, I plan to crumble the bacon more and add more garlic, to help spread these flavors more.

Yummy!!! I made a few of the suggested changes! I found the leanest bacon I could find to cut down on the grease/fat. I used a seasoned can of tomatoes which had basil/oregono in it. I drained most of that. I then put the spinach in with the tomato/bacon/garlic mixture and let it wilt like that. I saved about a 1/2 cup of the pasta water to give the pasta a little bit of liquid, and added parmesean and feta cheese and mixed it all in. Talk about flavorful..this will definitely be a normal in my house! Even my 13 month old ate it!!

I loved this recipe. I used turkey bacon as well. I left the tomatoes out because my husband isn't a fan. Had friends over and they loved it too. The second time I made it, I used bow-tie pasta. I also used more olive oil and a little cream to make it more saucey. Delicious! Thanks for the post.

I made this exactly as written with spinach and green garlic from our latest CSA box, and both my husband and I thought this recipe was outstanding.  It's light and very, very tasty.  Thanks for sharing this one; it will be a regular for light summer meals.

This recipe is really good.  I added ginger in with the garlice and instead of the spinach I tossed in some cilantro and green onions.  To finish it off, I crubled some feta cheese on top!  Ummm so good...

Very good, I used turkey bacon and while it didn't get crisp the texture was fine.  4 year old daughter and husband loved it.  Put some pepper and parmesan on it.

I've made this a few times.  Each time adding a little bit of chicken broth right before I toss with the pasta.  My family likes their pasta soupier as opposed to dry.  This way it's a definite 4 stars.  Tonight I decided to experiment with this recipe.  I cooked the bacon until crispy.  Drained and set aside.  I used the bacon drippings to cook an onion along with about 4 cloves of garlic.  I added about 10 ounces of mushrooms and 3 roasted red peppers.  Added 1/2 cup of white wine and 1 cup of heavy cream.  Threw the bacon back in.  Threw in the spinach at the very end and tossed altogether with the pasta.  Wow, this brought it to a whole new level.  The original recipe is light and fast and delicious.  My tweaking made it a 5 Star but also increased fat and calories.  Will make again both ways BUT will make it more the way that it is written.  P.S.  I had fresh spinach earlier in the week but was afraid it was going to spoil, so I washed it...DRIED it very well and then froze it in a ziploc baggie.  I was able to use my fresh/frozen spinach without a problem.  Thanks for sharing. Beautiful dish !

Delicious and comes together so easy.  Great for a week night meal!  The only change I made was to add some diced chicken I had marinated in some olive oil and Italian seasons.  I cooked the chicken up with the bacon (hubby loves his meat!).  I love how the spinach is wilted when you drain the pasta - great idea!  I served it with "savory biscuits" from this site.

This was very quick and easy.  I used four cloves of garlic and one small onion chopped insteadof the minced garlic.  I just put it in with the bacon to cook.  I sprinkled parm on top of each individual portion.  I will definately make this again as a quick and easy supper.

This is such an easy, light and delicious meal!  For my fiance and me, I use half a box (so 8oz instead of 12oz)and there's plenty of "sauce" for the pasta.  I think if you use the whole 12oz (I actually can only find 16oz boxes) there would be too much pasta.  Anyways, I don't change anything else with the recipe because it's wonderful as is!

I'm giving this 4 stars because as written, this was a very bland, very soggy dish.  With the addition of oregano, basil, lemon juice, chicken, and some sugar, it turned into a spectacular dinner.  I didn't  use the diced tomato called for and instead substituted halved grape tomatoes.  Also, try adding some diced broccoli to the bacon drippings. Good luck!

This was an easy, light, delicious and quick supper.  Four stars because it's so simple.  It's great recipe to have in your repertoir because you can almost always have these items in the pantry for a last-minute meal.   Perhaps I'll add in Italian seasonings and/or black olives next time.  Thanks for posting this one, Jean.

Quick and simple pasta recipe. I used 1 lb of bacon and chose to steam the spinach to wilt it. I also added a little extra garlic as is my personal preference. Next time I will probably add Feta cheese.

Served this for group.  Can't believe the recipe doesn't call for removing all the bacon grease before adding garlic and tomatoes.   A whole box of penne pasta was too much for the amount of sauce.  I would cut back on pasta by 1/2 (for 4 people) or double the sauce.  I will try the suggestions of other reviewers to add cheese, spicy tomatoes, etc.

Made exactly as written and wasn't thrilled. Although it had a nice smoky flavor from the garlic and bacon,it was not enough "stuff" for all that pasta IMO. So, I prolonged dinner and... made an additional batch of the bacon/tomato/spinach etc. mix. And, sauteed (sith the bacon and garlic) fresh yellow and red peppers, some separately-cooked (al dente') broccoli and added (surprisingly, with all that bacon) 1/4 tsp. salt, lots of fresh cracked pepper, and 1/2 cup shredded parmesan at the very end. Enjoyed it much more after that.

My boyfriend and I both LOVE this recipe. It is so simple and quick.. and most importantly, tasty!! I did add some extra bacon and used diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano added the second time around, and we liked it just as much. I even passed this along to my mother and father, who loved it so much they passed it along to my brother! It was a hit in my entire family! Thanks =)

Very good and simple. I added a little extra bacon, about a half a medium white onion, and a little oregano. I used a whole 6 oz. bag of spinach. The proportions seemed just right. From reading the reviews I also omitted the olive oil and cooked the spinach with the tomato mix. This was great. Definitely a keeper!

This was very wet and a little bland.  I would make it again without draining the pasta over the spinach.  I think that caused the spinach to hold water.

Absolutely delicious.  I did follow one of the previous reviews and instead of blanching the spinach I added it in the skillet with the bacon grease and it was SUPERB!  Very easy, very good!

This was very tasty for having so few ingredients!  I was pleasantly suprised.  I will definately make this again.  My box of pasta was 16 oz. and I just used it all.  I used 8 oz. of frozen spinach and will use 2 to 8 oz. more next time.  I also added about 1/4 c. parmesan cheese.  UPDATE:  used 10 oz. frozen spinach this time and it was perfect!

Made this last night and it came out great!  I didn't make any major changes, I did use bowtie pasta instead of penne, and I didn't brown the bacon in the oil because bacon gives its own grease. Which by the way this recipe does not tell you to drain the grease off your bacon-I did and left a little more than a tablespoon in the pan before adding the garlic and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Surprisingly, this was very good.  I'm not a big spinach eater but would like to incorporate it into my diet more.  I thought this would be a good recipe.  Bacon makes everything taste better...right!!!  I followed the recipe except I poured 1/2 the grease off the bacon and did not use the olive oil.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add either parmesan or mozzarella cheese at the end and save some of the bacon to sprinkle on top.

This was so great. I followed the exact recipe with the exception of 2 extra slices of bacon (leftovers).  Even my 1 & 3 year old ate it.  They even asked for seconds!  I will keep this as a favorite!

EXCELLENT dish! I was trying to find a way to use up my fresh baby spinach before it went bad, and this was perfect. 
I made a few substitutions to make it work for us, like whole wheat pasta, and three diced, fresh tomatoes, uncured, nitrate-free bacon, and added 2 green onions to the sautee. The green onion added an excellent extra dimmension of flavor, without being over-powering. I also sauteed the spinach with the bacon/tomato mixture, to avoid a gritty texture often found in wilted spinach.
We also added a sprinkle of parmesean and romano cheese over each serving. SO good! Even my 21-month-old loved it!

I made a few modifications to the recipe and gave it a little kick and less fat hopefully.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, removed a lot of the fat from the 6 pieces of bacon and didn't use olive oil, just the bacon drippings.  We also used whole wheat penne and sprinkled a little parmesan on our plates.  This is a really great dish!

This is a quick and easy meal.  I used Italian-style canned tomatos that were already seasoned with basil, onion, and garlic.  I only used 1/2 lb of bacon and also added parmesan and cherry tomatos.

What a fantastic dish!  I was amazed by how much flavor it had with so few ingredients.  I like my spinach cooked so I added it to the bacon tomato mixture and left it for a few minutes.  I also added parmesian cheese to the finished dish.  I highly recommend this recipe!!!

Delish, but I would definitely not call this a "quick light meal."  Quick, yes, but light?  Not my version. :) My sister-in-law had given me this recipe and her version calls for a full pound package of bacon so that's what I used. Shame on me! I fried up the bacon, drained off the grease and then just sauteed the garlic in a little bit of the grease remaining in the skillet. Feeling guilty about the bacon, I eliminated the 2T of olive oil, and it wasn't missed at all. Also, instead of pouring the hot pasta over the spinach, I just added the spinach to the pasta before adding the tomato/bacon mixture. The texture was right on, slightly wilted but not slimy, with a slight crispness.  I will definitely be making this dish again, but only on those days where I get in an extra workout! :) FYI: My kids really enjoyed this dish, especially the bacon, so I think the full pound was necessary. Six slices wouldn't stretch very far or add as much flavor.

Oh so YUMMY! My hubby isn't a big spinach fan, but he just about licked his plate clean! This will definitely be a new favorite in my house!

This is always a hit at my house.  Very easy and very tasty.  The only changes I make is that I use an entire pound of pasta, 7 slices of bacon, and top with grated romano cheese.  This is a great recipe!

Mmmmmmm... we really liked this, including the two-year old and the not-a-big-veggie-person husband. I loved how simple it was to pull together!  I used a bit more bacon than was specified and substituted turkey for regular but, other than that, stayed true to the recipe. I'll make it again soon.

This is delicious and very easy!  Good for a quick dinner when I got home from work, which I'm always looking for.  I cooked the bacon the night before for another recipe, so I just crisped it in the pan tonight.  Very good.  Used more garlic than called for, and topped with parmesan (seemed a bit bland).  Otherwise, perfect, and we loved it.  Thanks!

Well, I'm eighteen and I just began cooking full meals. This was perfect! Easy and Delish. I made it for my mother and I and she loved it. I will definantly make it again, I did make alot of changes though because I didnt have everything. I didnt have canned tomatoes so I cut up my own, I didnt have Penne Pasta so I used the colorfull curly ones it worked just as well. And I didnt have fresh Spinach I only have frozen but the meal turned out amazing anyways. Fives stars!

I loved this, its good for using up leftover pasta.  I had some Penne already cooked.  I did not use any olive oil, I cooked the garlic with the bacon.  I also used fresh tomatoe chopped also, for health reasons.  I then added the pasta and spinach to the skillet and put on lid to wilt the spinach..turned it off and let set because I had go pick up the kid.  The flavors worked together very well.  Thank you.

Pretty good for a quick weeknight meal in a bowl.  I used breakfast sausages and sliced them after browning.  Also used jarred garlic and dried onion in the tomato mixture---much quicker and more readily available in my kitchen.  I will try with bacon another time.

I LOVED IT!  LOTS OF BACON FLAVOR BUT AT LEAST THE SPINACH IS HEALTHY!!  A GOOD WAY TO GET THE FAMILY TO EAT SPINACH.  I SERVED WITH CAESAR SALAD. I USED PENNE RIGATA TYPE NOODLES AND IT WORKED WELL.  (NEXT TIME I MAY ADD SAUTEED ONIONS)

This was pretty tasty!  I did not use the bacon grease - I fried up the bacon, drained then wiped the pan clean before adding olive oil to saute the garlic in - also, I added some portabella mushrooms which I thought went extremely well in this dish, and I used three fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned, and fresh baby spinach.  Finished with some freshly grated parmesan.  Delicious and a great choice for a quick meal!

Okay......so yummy and so easy!!
I actually did a few changes because that is all i had on hand. First off i just used whole wheat spaghetti since i didnt have any penne and loved it.. will have to try with penne though. I also didnt have real garlic so just used lots of garlic powder, added red pepper flakes and some oregano. I also saute some onion with the bacon and i used 10 strips of bacon instead. Then i just used the same pan and added the tomatoes and added the spinach to that just before serving. 
I am actaully suprised and how divinely good this was.. Definetly a favorite!! Oh and also topped off with some parmesan cheese.

This was quite good, and really easy. I didn't use any olive oil to cook the bacon as the bacon I had was quite fatty. After I cooked the bacon I drained off the fat, but next time I may leave a little behind just to add flavour to the sauce.

This is a wonderful, flavorful meal! I only changed a couple things to make it taste great! I added a little more garlic than it called for. I think I diced up 3 cloves. I also used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, SOOOO good! My husband and I loved it!!! Easy, healthy, and so, so yummy!!

Great, easy and versatile recipe. Will definitely make again. The only change I made was I added the spinach the last minute to the sautee pan with the tomatoes, bacon, etc. Then I tosssed it in the pot with the penne. It was great with my lemon pepper chicken and crescent rolls for my Valentines Day dinner. =)

Great, easy recipe.  I used 6 slices of thick cut bacon.  Did not use any olive oil.  Discarded most of the bacon grease and only left enough in the pan to saute some red bell peppers and onion, prior to adding the garlic.  There was no problem with the dish seeming dry, even though the olive oil was omitted.

THIS WAS GOOD. WHAT I SUGGEST IS TO COVER IT UP AFTER MIXING IT TOGETHER AND LET IT SIT FOR 10 MINUTES. THIS WILL GIVE THE PENNE A CHANCE TO ABSORB SOME OF THE MIXTURE. I ATE MINE RIGHT FROM THE STOVE AND THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE BLAND. HAD TO PUT A LITTLE PEPPER AND CHEESE TO LIVEN IT UP. WENT BACK TO PICK AT IT ABOUT 1HR LATER AND IT TASTED MUCH BETTER.

This is a quick and easy supper.  When the bacon was done cooking, I soaked up some of the grease with paper towels and then put the spinach in to cook.  I added the tomatoes and then the pasta.  I used fortified pasta to make it more healthy.  My husband and I both really liked it.  We both hate tomatoes but felt that they were a nice touch.  He also hates spinach but didn't mind it in this dish.  It is a keeper for an occasional meal.

This little gem of a recipe is pretty darn good. I used 8 slices of bacon and baby spinach out of a bag. It is super easy and fast. You can't beat dishes like this when you consider the alternative....drive through!! Yuck!

What a great "Base Recipe"!  I can imagine tossing in some sliced leftover chicken the next time I make this.  I made it with the turkey bacon and spiced canned tomoatoes, too and served it with shredded parm.  Yum!  Thanks for a great quick and easy weeknight recipe.

I really liked this.  I didnt have regular bacon so i used Turkey  Bacon...I didnt have leaf spinach so I used frozen chopped spinach and angel hair pasta. I topped off the dish with tons of mozerella. YUM. The flavor is tasty and doesnt make you feel stuffed afterwards like some pasta dishes.  It was super easy and quick.

Loved, loved, loved this one. I made it as is the first time and it was very good. The second time I used fresh tomatoes, extra garlic, and threw in some leftover grilled chicken.... it tasted like my favorite dish from our local italian restaurant. Thanks so much for this recipe, it is definitely a keeper!

WOW! Really good. I wilted the spinach in the pan (per other reviews). And, (as always) used VERY LARGE measurements for the garlic. Next time will use fresh tomatoes and more spinach. My 3 year old loved the pasta and bacon.

This was excellent.  My whole family liked it although I had to pick the spinach off for the kids.  I made a few changes.  Instead of a can of diced tomatoes I peeled, seeded and diced five fresh roma tomatoes.  I also used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon to save on the fat.  I would definitely make this again with my changes

This was ok. Maybe it's just me, but I have a really hard time wrapping my head around a 'healthy' recipe that includes that much bacon and oil. Initially, I tried to stick as close to the recipe as possible, but made slight changes to keep it healthy. I halved the recipe, omitted the oil entirely (I don't see why you'd need it with greasy bacon involved), only used 1 slice of bacon, fresh tomatoes, and bow-tie pasta instead of penne. As is, it was somewhat bland. So at the last minute, I spritzed on some Fat-free Italian dressing and a dash of oregano. Better. A little garlic salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Better still. And then crumbled some low fat feta on top. Not bad at all. But not great. I might make this again and play around with it. It made a decent side dish to the Spicy Chicken Breasts recipe on this site and it was fairly easy to throw together. It's a good starter to something you can really tweak to your own tastes. On it's own, it's a little lacking.

This IS a great fast, light dinner!  I made this last night, and my family including the small children loved it!  I think next time I will add some chicken to make it different.  I did use fresh garden tomatoes instead of canned.

This was alright.  Not my favorite by far.  I agree w/ the other reviewers that said that it was bland.  It is really healthy but not tasty.  Maybe w/ a few additions it could be.

Absolutely delicious!  After reading the reviews, I used fresh tomates and added grated parmesan cheese just before eating.  Next time I will add a little more spinach.  I will definitely make this again, one of my new favorites!

VERY GOOD, I added some chopped onion to the bacon drippings and witled the spinach in the pan. This will be my new go to meal, since all the ingredents are easy to keep on hand.

All I added was shredded parmesan and my whole family thought it was delicious! I didn't use olive oil to cook the bacon in because who needs it? Turned out a little greasy, so next time I will drain out more of the bacon grease. It was very flavorful though, and so quick and easy!

Of all the recipes I've gotten from allrecipes.com, this has, thus far, been our household favorite. So flavorful and delicious. Next time, we might toss some grilled chicken in the mix! My husband will even eat this "leftover" and he detests leftovers.

This was a great meal! Following the recipe, my spinach came out a little too wilted (more like soggy and limp) but the dish still tasted great.  Next time I'll just toss the spinach with the pasta right after draining.

What a delicious and easy recipe! The only thing I did differently was after pouring the pasta water on the spinach I then added the spinach to the diced tomatoes and garlic mixture that was heating on the stove. The boyfriend absolutely LOVED the flavors!

If you want a low fat version use:
1. turkey bacon or the real bacon piece in the bottle
2.  Instead of olive oil (which is pretty good for you) use a fat free vineagerette
3.  Fresh tomatoes always taste better than canned tomatoes.  Don't cook the tomato, It will add a nice layer of flavor!
4.  The spinach still tastes good when it is not wilted.
5.  If you don't have penne pasta, used what you've got on hand!

These were the things I changed when I made this recipe. I was awesome.  My family wants me to put this in the dinner rotation!!

I made this again tonight and I added about half a cup of mascarpone cheese to the tomato mixture right before mixing with the pasta.  Totally made the dish!  Added just the right touch of cream that went really well with the spinach & bacon.

Excellent! I made twice the bacon,used fresh Roma tomatos, and cooked the garlic with half the bacon grease. And yes, you only need two garlic cloves. Two teaspoons would be way to much. This will definetly be on the family rotation! Thanks for all the great tips out there!

I didn't like the chunks of tomatoes so much, but this had an excellent flavor.  So easy.  I like the idea of hot pepper flakes and adding the bacon grease to the pasta.  I also topped with a little fresh grated parmesan.  Next time, I'll probably puree the tomatoes, add a bit more bacon  and more spinach to balance the pasta.  Thanks!

My husband and son both loved this recipe, I however thought there was something missing.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and I wilted the spinach in with the garlic, bacon drippings and tomatoes.  I will make this again but next time I think I will add some chili flakes and parmesan cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

I added a bit of fresh basil along with the spinach, used the hot and spicy bacon, and then topped with fresh grated parmesan.  So good on a cold rainy day like today, but would probably be good chilled and served as a salad.

Quick and good.  If you find the recipe bland as written then up the flavor!  I added a couple shakes of italian seasonings, hot pepper flakes, and some grated parm.  Still only 4 stars, but better.

Kids just didn't enjoy the taste. I made this for myself and my 4 kids because I had everything and they all love bacon and pasta.  But none of them liked it!  I think the tomatoes with the bacon must have been a new combo.  Even my 8 yr old who eats anything said her tummy felt sick before bed.  Though easy, won't make again.

Delicious! I did a couple alterations like used about 5 or 6 cloves of fresh garlic and used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes in Olive Oil & garlic..adding the extra can of tomatoes gives it more liquid otherwise it could be on the dry side. I will defintely be making this dish again and again.

You have to love a recipe that is on the table in under 20 minutes from start to finish! However, like another reviewer, there was not enough sauce-to-pasta ratio.  I used a 16 oz. box of penne because I never heard of a 12 oz. box.  So I upped the bacon, garlic, and spinach a bit, but next time, I will double them.  Adding black olives, cooked chicken, or asparagus would help even things out too.  Remarkably light dish, even with the bacon!

I added a small can of tomato sauce to add a litle more liquid to the recipe as well as fresh tomatoes and mushrooms.  I adjusted the recipe to feed five.  The flavor was wonderful, and to my amazement my husband and three children enjoyed it.  They are pretty picky eaters.

I loved this recipe!  It was so easy and really good.  I had a lot of leftovers too.  I served it with a simple Caesar Salad and a warm French Baguette.  Yum Yum.

This was very good I can't wait to use fresh tomatoes it will be even better.  I did drain the fat from the bacon off it seemed a little wrong not to.  And I thicked it up with parm cheese.  This would be very good with a good bread and a glass of red wine.

This was pretty good, and very easy. My only change was to use fresh tomatoes (all I had), and my only complaint was the low sauce-and-stuff ratio to pasta- I would have liked a saucier dish. The great part is the speed (under 15 minutes) at which this can be served, and a ton of other additions that could be added- red onions, feta, pine nuts, mushrooms, aparagus, fresh basil....

I really loved this recipe!  I followed the recipe, although I used pre-cooked bacon (and added one extra slice) and used 1/2 the olive oil.  Unfortunately, my oldest son picked out all the tomatoes, my youngest son only ate the bacon and pasta, and my husband ate around the spinach.  I was the only one who liked ALL the ingredients.  My only complaint was that it seemed to need a bit more liquid....but since it wasn't to the rest of my families taste, I probably won't make it again.  Too bad, too, I thought it was both simple, very tasty, and it looked really pretty =)

This was really good!  I drizzled the entire salad with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  My husband and I agree that some roasted tomatoes next time around will be the ticket.  I served it as a main dish with some crusty french bread, also drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  Excellent!

I LOVED this recipe!! Really good, quick and easy. The only modifications I made was using turkey bacon and finishing the dish with a little parmesean cheese. I'll definately keep this in my recipe rotation.

my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The one thing I did differently was put the spinach in the pan with the tomatoes so I could get a good wilt. it only took about 2 minutes to wilt with a lid on.  I also added a sprinkle of fresh ground pepper. I will definitely make this again.

I made this with 16 oz of orecchiette pasta (didn't have penne). Added a few extra slices of bacon and little more spinach to account for the slight increase in pasta ounces. Delicious.

Loved this!  However, next time I will double the spinach as it was the best part and just not enough of it.  I also cut up peperoncinis and that added to the good flavor.

I prepared the meal following the recipe as printed. The only change I made was to the bacon. I used turkey bacon instead of pork. We are a no pork or beef house. The meal was very bland. I was able to taste the spinach and tomatoes, but it was still bland. I attempted to season it up by adding basil and oregano and a little salt and pepper.  I also added more garlic and tomatoes. It was a little better not a whole lot. 
I would maybe try it again.

This turned  out  fine, probably  didn’t need a recipe to make this.  But  the real kicker is you better  prepare to  eat all of it right away because it does  not make good leftovers.

This is really 3 1/2 stars but it’s a great base for a quick pasta dish. I made the recipe exactly as written and felt it was a little bland. I definitely would add some  basil,  parsley, oregano and salt & pepper.

Easy and delicious.   I’m more hesitant to try new recipes lately given that it’s always a risk.    This has a nice simple goodness from the bacon so you really can’t go wrong.  I drained half the bacon fat to reduce the fat and it was still a delicious meal.

Easy enough, but not much for flavor. I did take others suggestion & tried some with feta cheese on top & some with parmesan cheese. Feta gave it more umph, but still was missing something. I thought the parmesan cheese tasted better though. Hubby said it needed some spice. I thought the 2T of garlic & adding onion would've helped. We decided we won't be making again since there are so many other dishes we do like more.

This Turned out so delicious. The only changes that I made was to drain the bacon and tomato juice and added some Parmesan cheese.

I use two fresh beefsteak tomatoes and while the original recipe is delicious, the freshness of the tomatoes takes it over the top for me. Love this recipe!

i use recipes as a baseline. i added 2 pinches of baking soda, and a teaspoon of sugar and a pinch of salt because it tasted too bland, kike the flavors were not integrating. i added the spinach to the sautéing of the garlic. i didn’t drain the tomatoes before sautéing, so when i added the baking soda, it became creamy without having to add cream or anything to make it creamy. next time i will just put the bacon by itself on top just before serving it because the bacon kind of gets soggy with the tomatoes and i like the crunch, crunch when i eat bacon.

I’ve made this a couple of times. I’ve made minor changes - I used 12 oz of bacon since I don’t otherwise know what I’d do with a few leftover slices. I drain off all but 2-3 Tbsp of the grease (which begs the question of why you need 1 Tbsp of olive oil before frying up the bacon - bacon generates plenty on its own, even when I’ve only used 6 slices). I also wilt the spinach with the bacon/tomato mixture instead of in the colander with the pasta, and season with a bit of pepper before serving.  It’s a really great recipe, and every time I make it, my husband asks why we don’t eat it more often.

This is really good comfort food. 

I don't always follow the recipe exactly. I often use whole garlic cloves, skip the spinach (if I don't have any on hand), or add chicken broth. I also remove the bacon after cooking it and then add it back to the sauce at the end so it remains crispy.

Followed other reviewers advice and added an onion and green pepper.  It's a great base for just about anything else you want to throw in it.  Quick and delicious!!

This was super easy to make and a hit for the whole family. I did drain the fat off the bacon. Although the recipe didn't explicitly state to do so, I think it would have been greasy otherwise. The garlic and the bacon really complement each other well.

I used turkey bacon instead of real bacon and used 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese (as another reviewer suggested).  I just tore up the spinach and tossed it in the saucepan. it came out great. will be making this again.

I added a little onion and mushrooms, which I pretty much add to everything I make. I also used a can of stewed tomatoes with onion and celery. Per another suggestion I sprinkled some chili pepper flakes also. I saved the olive oil for the end and finished the dish with a drizzle of some very good quality olive oil. I have basil growing so I threw some fresh basil on the almost finished dish and   i did add some shredded mozz and parm to my individual serving.  I add cheese whenever I can! This was a great fresh, easy dish. I will definitely make it again.

This was easy to make and absolutely delicious.! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly. I just made a few adjustments. I didn't use any olive oil since the bacon makes its own oil in the pan. I just thought adding olive oil would make it too oily.  I also added some seasonings into the tomatoes as they were cooking. I added some dried basil, fresh ground pepper and a little bit of garlic powder. I added a few more slices of bacon too and removed them after they were browned and crispy. I added 1/2 the bacon back to the tomatoes when the sauce was just about done. I added the other 1/2 of bacon right before serving along with crumbled feta cheese. My family and I loved this dish. This would be a great summer dish since it is light and quick and easy to make.

It's good, but it definitely needs more bacon.

I never know how to rate a recipe when I make changes.    I didn't have high hopes for this recipe but I loved it.  I browned the bacon as stated but then took it out of the pan and drained the grease.  I added garlic, red pepper and mushrooms to the still slightly greasy pan and sautéed them.  I added the bacon back when the mushrooms were almost done.  I did not add the tomatoes because my husband doesn't like them but think they would have been a great edition.  I followed the rest of the recipe as it is written.    It was really good and I loved the taste of the mushrooms with the garlic and bacon.  Yum

I just recently got back into cooking after a several-year hiatus, and this is the first recipe I made!! Despite my slight over-cooking of the bacon (I need some practice, but that's okay! An excuse to eat more bacon... mmmm...), this was delicious. It is easy but yummy, and it gave my boyfriend and I enough food for two dinners and one lunch each. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My family loved this dish.  It was a hot day and I didn't want to cook but I had to feed them.  This was easy, full of flavor and it was so quick to make.  I will have to make a double batch next time because they wanted more for lunch the next day.

It was bland. 

I did the following: used turkey bacon instead of regular (health nut boyfriend) but I doubled the amount. (Which probably doesn't get us anywhere.)  I used veggie-based pasta. I doubled the garlic. I used 2 cans of tomatoes and instead of plain, I got the oregano/rosemary kind. I added Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper flakes. 
I served it with Parmesan cheese. Very good. I caught my boyfriend eating it cold out if the container in the fridge.

It was one of those nights when I decided to use what was available to me.  Luckily I had most of these items on hand which speaks to the ease of creating this dish.

Next time I make this dish I will add mushroom and maybe experiment with collards.

Overall I liked the taste and will likely make it again.

Love, love this dish!!  Had unexpected company when I planned on making this dish.  So it was taking a chance cooking something new.  I did put whole pound of bacon in it.  Only change.  Was afraid it would be bland so did think about adding spices but didn't. So glad I didn't !!  It was wonderful and everyone said to make it again.  Really really good and easy!! Such a simple recipe.

This is awesome, but I did make a few changes. Instead of bacon, I cut up chunks of Genoa salami. Also, I never measure garlic and always use more than a recipe calls for. I also use more tomatoes. I've served this both hot and cold and it's always a hit.

Sautéed chopped onion with bacon (6 to 8 slices chopped)  and garlic.  Used canned diced tomatoes with italian seasoning.   Added several handfuls of fresh spinach directly to tomato mixture to taste. Added red wine to keep sauce from getting too thick and to taste. .... could use water or red cooking wine.   Added salt and pepper to taste.

My family thought this recipe was very tasty. I did add sliced mushrooms to make it more filling and thought it was great. I also used a fresh tomato instead of canned.  I didn't notice the bacon in it, and think it would be just as good without. I might try Italian sausage next time instead.

Like many of the other reviewers, I too found this easy to modify.  I used fresh tomatoes, sauteed with onions and garlic (lots of garlic for me) and slowly simmered it all together. I DID like the idea of wilting the spinach by pouring the pasta over it while hot.  I used a fancy, striped, bow tie pasta just for fun.  THIS is a great "first" recipe for new cooks and definitely a keeper to pass on.  I can think of 100 ways to modify it as you see what's in the fridge!

Not bad, but the spinach didn't really add much. I suggest that you make the bacon first, then remove it from the pan to crisp up. Make other ingredients separately.

I cooked the bacon and cut up the night before. Used to fresh plum tomatoes instead of canned. I thought it was very good. Easy to make. Next time I might add some black olives. 4 stars only because the left- overs didn't taste as good as the first time around. recipe says it makes 8 servings but it was so good we only got 6 out of the recipe.

Just tried it.  My Italian husband loved it.  Did add onion and some red pepper flakes.  Next time might make sauce a little earlier to allow the pepper flakes to add some zing

I always doctor any recipe with any fresh herbs I grow.  We eat very little Bacon, so I would use Canadian Bacon.......yes I know the fat makes it tasty, so not having the fat, use olive oil and spices you like, herbs.  I think this would be great with sauteed Asparagus, Spinach, fresh tomato's from your garden.  What a great idea.  Then some good cheese grated on top?  I like Parmesan cheese.  or sharp Cheddar, maybe both........have fun with your food!  Duana Hoffhines

Made recipe as written except used almost a whole package of bacon.  This tasted very good; it's not a strong flavor, kind of mild and garlicky but not "too" garlicky. Make sure you don't cook it too high once you add the garlic so that you don't burn the garlic.  
If you're looking for something for guests, this looks beautiful on a plate, it's a really nice presentation.   My kids and picky husband all liked it a lot.   I paired it with some good bread and a big salad. I'll definitely make this again.  I don't think you even need the olive oil at all really. Bacon adds enough "oil" so I think you could leave it out.

I cooked the onions and garlic and spinach in the olive oil. I sprinkled with parmensean cheese after adding the diced tomatoes.   I baked a pound of bacon in the oven.  My husband loved it.  Will make again and again . I love 5 ingredients or less.

It was easy and tasty.  I followed the one reviewers suggestions by adding more bacon and cooking diced onion with it.  I used canned tomatoes with chiles as she suggested and then I threw a very small amount of sliced black olives for color.  My sons all like a bit of spice so I think the canned tomatoes with chiles was a hit.   The next time I make it I'll just use the smaller amount if bacon.  You could taste it but I try and cut fat whenever I can and a full pound was not necessary.    Appreciate the original cook and those who added some good ideas.

Was going to add slivers of red onion, didn't. Thought about making a light alfredo because the ingredients looked so bland, didn't. Took this recipe on it's own merits. About the only thing I did differently was to use a full lb of bacon because I used a lb of penne and four chopped roma tomatoes seasoned with salt and pepper instead of a can. Topped with fresh grated parmesiano reggiano this with full of flavor. The wife, my 16-year-old son and I really liked it

However you slice it (sorry!), cooking bacon is a bit labor-intensive. That's the only reason I took off one point. And I can never seem to cook just 6 slices, or half a package. Three teenagers almost command a pound of bacon per person, lol. But ok, the recipe. It was very versatile. Enjoyed it as written, with the exception of tomatoes. My "adult" teens hate tomatoes. I slid by that using sun-dried tomatoes, per another review. Sauteed the onion and garlic in the barest amount of bacon grease. (Hint: here's how to dispose of bacon grease. Find a styrofoam soft drink cup, let the grease cool, and, using a funnel, pour into cup. Let grease harden and throw away.) I added a bit of Parmesan, a shake of red pepper, a tiny bit of salt -- there's bacon, after all -- and it was so delicious. Forgot to  sautee the spinach -- just folded it into the final product -- but it was great as is. Thank you for this recipe! Throughly enjoyed it!

Followed recipe but use the bacon drippings in the skillet to sauté garlic and tomatoes. Absolutely delicious. Will definitely make again.

Very yummy! I used a 16 ounce box of macaroni (it was what i had on hand) instead of the 12 ounce penne, diced a tomatoe instead of a can, and drained a little more than half of the bacon grease. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, got some bakery bread for the side, it was delicious! It will make for some very good leftovers, good warm and cold! Will definitely make again!

I made this for supper tonight and it was well loved! Yeah! Like one reviewer, I used orzo pasta instead of penne but everything else remained the same well, I also used garlic powder in the seasoning, I absolutely love garlic in almost everything. My dad who had a terrible accident back in January ( he was thrown off a mule ) and hasn't been able to eat very much since then had this and loved it! I will be making this again!!

OMG....delicious. I did listen to a few reviewers and sauteed the spinach in the bacon grease. I also added a chopped red pepper, some sliced mushrooms, and a can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic. Fabulous! A great light dish for the warmer weather.

My husband loved this recipe, but I think it would be better if the bacon grease was drained until only a 1-2 TBS remained (as other reviewers noted).

Very yummy!  I was excited to try this, and it did not disappoint.  Low sodium bacon instead of regular was the only change I made.  I'll make this again for sure, I'd like to try serving it cold at a picnic.

Very nice flavor, just had to drain the bacon to keep it from being too greasy and next time I will add less tomatoes (possibly half a can). other than that it was GREAT!

Really great and simple recipe! I followed another reviewer's suggestions to change it up a little bit. I used an entire package of bacon (about 1 lb) and removed as much fat as possible while chopping it up. Add in a small onion or half an onion to accompany the garlic. When adding the diced tomatoes to the batch I also added the spinach to cook it more than just a slight wilt underneath the cooked pasta. The other reviewer added in dried basil, it really made a difference! Once everything was mixed I topped it off with parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper. Next time I make this I'm adding another bunch of spinach for sure, that's how much I love spinach. There are definitely a ton of different ways to make this a bit different and still very tasty.

I just made this dish for dinner tonight.  I added mushrooms, onions, and topped with fresh shaved parmesean cheese.  I also added some thyme and red pepper flakes.  My husband thought it was great, but I have to say thought it was kinda bland.  Not sure if I'll make it again....unless my husband specifically requests it  :)

I love that the preparation and ingredients are so simple, but did not think it had much flavor.  Also, both my husband and I had a stomach ache later that night - maybe from the bacon grease?

I really enjoyed this recipe and followed it mostly. I used truffle oil to mix it and used a little home made alfredo sauce to just give it an extra kick. I think next time adding roasted red peppers and an onion might make it even better.

Not sure what I did wrong but based on all of the positive reviews, it must've been me.  Followed directions exactly but found it to be unappealing.  Too overpoweringlly spinachy with no other noticeably flavors (not even the bacon stood out). Will not make again.

Yummy! This was REALLY good (and it complemented my main dish chicken entree nicely!). The smokiness from the bacon paired with the garlicky aroma as this cooks is INTOXICATING!!! Although fine as is, I would have preferred this MUCH better had I used fresh tomatoes. The canned ones kinda ruined this for me.... NOTE: Steaming your spinach by draining pasta over it is INGENIOUS!!! I wish I would have thought of this idea myself lol! All in all, this was SUPER delicious, but fresh ingredients are the way to go IMHO. Thanks for sharing, Jean! :-)

I want to give this a 3.5 star rating, and with fresh home grown tomato's this is an easy 4 starer. It is light and satisfying. I suggest not using any oil to cook the bacon in, add some parm and black cheese to take this to the next level.

Loved this! I wilted the spinach in 2 Tablespoons of bacon grease and like other reviewers added the bacon at the end so that it was crisp. Will be making again very soon!

Made it exactly as the recipe, tried it & I wasn't a fan of it. Not enough flavor. So I added parmesan cheese & a little caesar dressing. Made it much better.

Perfect!  After removing the bacon I removed some of the bacon grease because I felt all of it was not needed.  I added about a tsp. of olive oil then added the garlic.  Instead of doing the colander thing with the spinach I just added it into the saute pan, cooked about a minute then tossed in with the drained pasta.  I did not add the Tbs of olive oil cause it was wet enough.  Great flavor and went well with the chicken I made!  Thanks!!

Instead of Bacon, I used sausages.  Also, to spice it up a bit, I added two table spoons of Chinese Hot Pot Sauce (???).  Two picky kids and husband ate every bit of it.  Thanks.

i really enjoyed this.  Didn't have fresh garlic so used garlic in the jar.  I had some already pepared pasta so I just poured warm water over it and the spinach.  In spite of the bacon, it needed some salt.  Next time, might add a dash of red pepper flakes.  Ued baby spinach!

This was a great meal that was very quick and easy to make.  Thanks!!  I had a 14 oz. box of pasta so I would have liked to have a little more of everything.  Especially the bacon!  I added some red pepper flakes.  Next time I will add some chicken.

A great pasta dish. I think it is a good base, you can change it to fit what you have on hand or what you think it needs. Add mushrooms or onions, etc...I made it following the ingredients listed and liked it but it would have been great if I added other things to it also.

This was very good.  When I started making this dish, I realized I didn't have a package of bacon so I cheated and used real bacon bits.  I also took the advice of several others and it turned out wonderful.  Another dish for the "repeat" list!

Very delicious and easy to make. I used whole wheat penne pasta instead. A little gritty because of the whole wheat pasta, but really yummy. You don't feel over stuffed like you do when you eat regular pasta with marinara sauce. My boyfiend is a very picky eater and he loved this. We will be making this as a regular dish!

Plates beautifully but very bland.  I added diced onion and fresh parmesan cheese to this recipe and it was still very, very bland.  I will not be making this again.

I give this 2 stars only because it is a quick and easy recipe. I followed the recipe, and it was tasteless. Before serving I had to add basil, lots more garlic and more tomatoes. I topped each serving with tons of fresh grated parmesean cheese, and it still seemed bland.

Very disappointed in this recipe. I followed the recipe - however, had to drain some of the grease from the bacon - who could eat that much grease? The bacon got soggy when I added the tomatoes...Not a keeper for us.

Great to build on.  I like to save pans--so, cooked the bowtie pasta and rinsed slightly.  Same pan-Browned 12 oz. center cut bacon and some onion; removed but left drippings. Added tomatoes and sliced fresh mushrooms with a dab of butter (for the musthrooms); added organic spinach and when just beginning to wilt, put in pasta (but only half depending on how it gets coated) and it was to die for!  Husband loved it and wants it again--soon!

I can't believe I'm in the minority here, but we were not impressed with this recipe. I followed it exactly and did not like the outcome. We found it overwhelmingly bland and noodle heavy. It did not suit our tastes.

This was a nice, different pasta dish to cook. It was a little bland, but nothing that can't be corrected with a little more seasoning during the cooking process and/or some cheese sprinkled over the finished product. I also used much more bacon than the recipe called for, cooked it to a crisp and crumbled it into the dish right before serving. I also used diced tomatoes with tomato sauce, which gave it a little more moisture than I think it would have had otherwise. Very good, and I'm sure I will cook this again.

This is delicious.  I did  not add olive oil to the skillet before cooking the bacon because I did not see the point.  Also, I do not have a colander, so I put the spinach in the skillet on top of the tomatoes, then the pasta in a large bowl.  Then I quickly flipped the tomato/spinach mix onto the pasta.  It was great, the whole family loved it and I will fix again soon!

Was a little disappointed, seemed a little bland. Didn't care for the grease coating my throat afterwards either, even though I emptied half the grease from the bacon out.  Thanks to other reviews I opted out on adding the olive oil.  
I give it a 3 because my 7 yr old enjoyed it VERY much, he wanted to take the left overs for lunch & he never asks that so I think I'm being generous on my rating.  For his sake it's a keeper :)

This dish was just okay.  I felt it needed "something" when I prepared it as is...I made a few adustments and it was a little better, but still not great.

My family and I loved it!!!  What a way to serve spinach to kids.  Instead of tossing the pasta and spinach in a serving bowl, I threw it in the pot with the bacon, garlic and tomatoes.  I also drained some of the oil from the pot before combining all.

Since I had abundance of fresh garden tomatoes, I used them instead of canned.  I don't know if that was the reason but it was VERY bland so I had to add few dashes of salt.  It was very good and family ate it up!

We really liked this a lot!  Not great for calorie/fat wise but delicious!  Today is my 2nd time making it.  I do everything as is except I use a separate pan for the tomato/spinach mixture and the bacon....I gradually add in the bacon grease to taste.  I add the bacon to the sauce just before serving to keep some of it's crunch.  Love it!

Excellent quick meal!  The only things I did differently was that I used a whole pound of turkey bacon and I added diced onions to the saute.  My girls and hubby loved it.  In fact, he said it was the best meal I've made!!

i really liked this.  i am usually trying to lose weight, so as i was cooking i decided to omit the oil to reduce the calories and fat.  may have been a litttle better with it, but it was definitely not needed - the garlic cooked up great in the bacon grease.  i used rotini because it was all i had.  thanks!

None of us were overly excited about this recipe, though I think the pan was too hot for the garlic and it turned a bit brown despite having immediately removed the pan from the heat source.

I made this twice in the same week because we couldn't get enough. It reheats really well in a pan with just a little heated oil. I did pour off all but 2 tbls of the bacon grease and added parm to finish. Yum-O

This recipe was so easy and SO GOOD!  I made a few small changes to the original recipe: I added some sliced mushrooms (cooked with the bacon), and I used italian style diced tomatoes instead of plain.  In the last step, I wilted the spinach in the pan with the sauce, not the pasta.  This was a great way to use spinach fresh from the garden!  My husband loves his bacon, but isn't a huge fan tomatoes.  After adding in the tomatoes, I was worried that they might overpower the dish, but the smoky bacon flavor still came through nicely and my husband loved it.  Fresh shredded parmesan is a must!

Wow, this was really good! I didn't have any olive oil so I used some of the bacon drippings. Less healthy that way, but everyone really liked it! My four year old and picky hubby cleaned their plates! Amazing for a dish with green in it! :) I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes, I love the flavor it has. Thanks for the recipe, it was easy and I will be adding it into regular rotation!

Delicious! I used a jar of sundried tomatoes (drained, rinsed, and chopped) in place of the regular tomatoes and it was so yummy. I also wilted my spinach in the pan and not in the colander. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this one is a keeper! Try topping the dish with the bacon AFTER plating so that it retains its crunchy texture.  I actually added chicken because I'm such a carnivore. ;o)

My first recipe rating.  I was intrigued because of bacon.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out bland.  I wound out using 1.5 pounds of bacon.  The first slices came as instructed.  The next set, I cooked the bacon as I would for breakfast.. CRUNCHY.  I discarded the oil and crumbed the pieces into the finished mixed.  I also had to add italian seasoning, basil and oregano spices to the mix.  It was too bland.  Some tomato sauce and salt help as well.  For some reason, it tasted better the next day.. microwaved after being put in the fridge.  Overall, double the bacon, add some italian spices and it'll be great.

I accidentally added an onion (so used to frying garlic with onion) so I am not sure exactly how it would have been without it, but it tasted good even with the onion.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a really good and easy dish.  I added a bit more bacon the second time I made it per hubby's request.  I also added a nice quantity of Parmesan cheese.  I think next time I will try fresh tomatoes instead, as the canned tomatoes taste, well, canned....One more thing, mine certainly wasn't as pretty as the picture above, wilted spinach doesn't look so nice.

My family and I tried it. We added more cheese. Someone added bacon, so we tried that too. It was really good. The picture makes it look a bit like a soup, but really, it comes out nice. We really liked it.

made this exactly as written except for draining the bacon grease. this is a light mild pasta dish that can be improved to add more flavor if desired. i made without reading reviews to get the true taste of the recipe and would add a few ingredients next time based on some reveiws. overall a good dish to try at least once. it case it sounds strange in first line, i did drain bacon grease.

This was great as a quick meal. I added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes and a few Tblsp of sun-dried tomatoes to get a sweeter sauce.

This was really good. It reminded me of something my mom used to make, but better. It didn't wow us, but it is for sure a quick and easy meal.  We added Parmesan cheese to ours and it was great.

If you want to leave out the bacon (and greasiness) use prociutto. Other wise tasty, fast and easy.

Rated 3 stars as is. Very good recipe to start from, but I think it could use a few adjustments. I cooked the tomatoes, spinach, etc together as others suggested. I also added grilled chicken and drained the bacon fat as well. At the end I added chicken stock and parmesean to make it more of a sauce. With those alterations, it was a 5, but as is, I'd give it a 3. Thanks for the recipe!

This was such a deliciously simple dish. I'm still amazed how easy yet yummy it all was! I scaled the pasta down to 2 people, used 10 slices of turkey bacon, 3/4 can of diced tomatoes, and about 3 cloves of garlic! Can't wait to make it again!!! Thanks!

This is such an easy and satisfying dish!  I use a few more strips of bacon (who doesn't like bacon??) and 2 cans of the diced tomatos -  also I add sliced portobello mushrooms when adding the garlic.  I always make enough for leftovers and it's even better the next day!

My husband gives it two thumbs up and said that I can make this recipe "anytime"!  I removed the bacon from the pan, removed most of the grease from the pan, sauteed garlic for a min or so, added the tomatoes and spinach, and the bacon (torn into pieces) and then the pasta.  I also added about 1/2 cup alfredo sauce to the tomato mix before adding the pasta.  Very yummy...I'll make this again!!

I seemed like it needed a bit more flovor and I think the bacon brought out the bitterness of the spinach.

This recipe is outstanding.  I think I gained 10 lbs. because I couldn't stop eating it.  It has such a great mix of flavor.  I have to say, I followed many peoples suggestions by 1)using diced tomatoes with herbs 2) putting the spinach in with the bacon/tomato mixture and 3) I used a little bit of half and half.  Before making the recipe, I was afraid (because of some reviews) the flavor would be bland and the recipe would come out soggy.  I have to say it burst with flavor and was far from soggy.  I was also afraid that the bacon grease would be too much, but it wasn't.  This is a KEEPER!  What a treat!  I’ll be making this for our Mother’s Day party for sure!

This was decent.  I added a bit of brown sugar to cut some of the acidity from the tomatos.  I think if I make this again, Ill add some onions to my bacon.

I precooked my bacon for this recipe, and then added it to the oil just to heat up.  I also added the spinach to the skillet to warm as suggested by another reviewer.  It definately doesn't look like a promising recipe when it's completed and in the bowl, but it's surprising tasty!

This was pretty good.  I cooked a 1/2 pound of bacon, then drained the grease and fried an onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  I added a bag of baby spinach, a 1/2 teaspoon of basil, a can of diced tomatos with jalapenos and a little half & half.  Then I put it in the pot with the pasta.  Sprinkle a little parmesan when serving.

This tastes great.  The second time I made it though, I used a box of frozen spinach instead of fresh, and the spinach absorbed all the sauce and it became one big green lump of bacony-tomatoey sauce.  So be warned--only use FRESH spinch!

This is a good recipe for a weeknight meal since it's so easy to prepare. I used 8 oz pasta, extra bacon and added a generous amount of black pepper. I like cheese on everything, so I also sprinkled some Parm on top. Next time I'll try using rotel tomatoes for extra spice and drain some of the liquid off.

Oh man this is delightful! We all loved it including three kiddies. Hubby said it was "Awesome". I used extra bacon because I had a bigger box of pasta, also used fresh tomatoes which I think is the way to go. So yummy. Thank you will definitely be making this again.

Family loved this recipe and it is now in weekly rotation. I did make changes so it is 5 stars by my liking.I used the diced tomatoes with oregano and basil and a can of rotel for a bit of spice. I also use the wheat penne pasta. After it's done sprinkle some parmesan cheese on dish and garlic toast on the side!

This was delicious and very easy to make. My husband loved it. Instead of pouring the pasta over the spinach we drained the pasta first and mixed the spinach in with the warm pasta.

My husband and I found this to be really bland.  I added a dash of salt and pepper and an extra clove of garlic.  It needs something extra but I'm not sure what.  Thanks anyways!

Very tasty dish & so easy to make it your own!  Made the recipe as printed the first time & we really loved it.  Very fresh flavors. We have also tried it with italian turkey sausage added & with cannelini beans added.  A new favorite at our house!

I usually don't cook a lot, however, this recipe was really easy to follow and really good. I made it for a dinner party and it was such a great hit! The only thing I did was to replace regular bacon with turkey bacon, so it wasn't too salty. Great recipe!

I really thought I'd like this considering all of the positive reviews. I thought it was very bland, and I had even added extra bacon and parmesan cheese. I will not be making this one again.

Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe!!! I have some girlfriends who don't eat red meat so I switched from bacon to chicken. It was still good.

This recipe was okay...It was a little bland for my family.  I used frozen chopped spinich that may have been a mistake.  Probably will not make again.

My family enjoyed this recipe for dinner.  Our youngest daughter, mistaking pasta for chicken, kept wanting more.
This was quick and easy.  I also enjoyed preparing this for dinner.  Thank you.

This was a great, easy weeknight meal!  I already had some cooked chicken so I added that to the pasta instead of the bacon and it was delicious! I took other reviewer's suggestions and sauteed the spinach with the garlic and it was perfect that way!

VERY good comfort food on a cold day, good with wine, my 2 year old ate it and so did my husband (although HE picked out most of the spinach) It's not the best ever but it is definitly very tastey, simple, and will be making it one of my "regular" recipes I turn to.

This was okay. It was quick and easy. I used frozen spinach instead of fresh because that's what I had and added mushrooms. Some cheese (romano or parm) would probably help this out a bit.

I had been making a very similar recipe from Real Simple (BLT Pasta), but this tastes just as good and is a lot easier.  Only changes I made were to use whole wheat pasta and Italian style diced tomatoes.  I also drained almost all of the bacon grease before sauteeing the garlic to make the dish a little healthier.  Very delicious!

I use the very best bacon I can find from the butcher.  The bacon has less fat which actually makes it taste better and makes me FEEL better about the dish. Enjoy!

The bacon in this dish is amazing!  But isn't bacon great in just about everything?  This is simple to make and different from your regular ol' tomato or cream sauces.  Will make again.

I love this recipe! I make two versions of this: one with regular bacon and one with veggie bacon, depending on who's eating. Both versions are loved. The recipe is five stars as is, but one of the great things about the recipe is that you can play around with it and is very forgiving. I like to add chopped sun dried tomatoes right before adding the garlic and pine nuts right before adding the tomatoes (be careful, they burn easily). I also prefer to put the spinach in with the bacon as one reviewer suggested. Yum!

This was excellent!  So easy to make, too.  I didn't fry the bacon in oil (doesn't really need it) and added the spinach to the bacon/tomato mixture to wilt it, before tossing together. Also drained as much grease as I could before I added the tomatoes and only drizzled the pasta lightly with oil when tossing together (instead of the full tablespoon). This dish might not need the oil at all because of the grease from the bacon.  I'm sure the addition of red pepper flakes would give this a nice spicy touch. Also, I think adding shrimp to this would be divine.

The recipe was great!  I followed some advice given and chose the whole wheat penne pasta and did not use the oil.  I drained practically all the bacon grease, added some diced onion and garlic powder and then the diced tomatoes with green chiles.  Thanks for the awesome recipe and helpful hints to make it healthier for my family!

Very good and very easy to make.  I didn't use the olive oil and added an entire bag of baby spinach leaves, as they cook down to almost nothing.  I also added a bit of parmasan cheese at the end.  Very good and I can't wait for the leftovers!  Next time I'll experiment with different cheeses and maybe some other vegetables too.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Really tasty and as another reviewer mentioned, a nice change from pasta with meat sauce! My changes were as follows: cook bacon, pour off most of fat then add spinach, drained tomatoes, and minced garlic to hot pan - this way you get all of the crispy bits up and heat up the rest of the ingredients. Next I added a good sized ladelful of pasta water and melted in 4 oz of cream cheese. Season with salt & pepper & top with parmesan cheese. Rich, creamy and delicious!

WOW!  This is SO good!  I, too, used a whole package of bacon (I think mine was 12 ounces) and took it out of the pan after it was done cooking so it would stay crisp.  I wilted the spinach in the skillet instead of in the colander as well.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This was delicious! My husband had three helpings....my kids picked thru and only ate the penne, but at least they allowed all that spinach on their plates!

I used whole wheat penne and uncured nitrate free bacon. Left out the olive oil as many reviews suggested. Topped with parm. Will definitely make again. I bet sliced black olives would be yummy....

I made this recipe a few weeks ago.  I didn't have fresh spinach so I defrosted some chopped spinach and added it to the tomato mixture before I added the pasta.  I also added some shrimp.  My husband loved it so much he asked me to make it again tonight for his birthday.  This time he wants me to put some chicken in.

didn't follow the recipe to a "T" but is still really good.  added more garlic, didn't use as much bacon, used a small pack of frozen spinach and added it to the bacon and tomato mixture while it was still in the pan, and topped with parmesan cheese.  i don't feel bad eating this dish since I'm trying to lose my pregnancy weight..tastes pretty healthy yet I still get the pieces of bacon in some bites.  yumm!!

Very easy and very delicious! I stuffed myself, my husband, and three children full with this and I still have leftovers. I will make one of my staple meals. The only drawback to this meal is that it is not good at all reheated. So make it and eat it all!

Both my husband and I loved this.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and added black pepper and parmesan cheese.  I think it would have been just as good with out these changes, tho!

It can't get easier than this! I came across the recipe looking for ways to use left over (wilting) spinach. I just so happened to have a box of bowtie pasta, and some uncooked bacon too, and the staple garlic! I made this in less than 20 minutes. I surprised even myself! And it was GOOD! Perfect light, quick meal before you head out the door.

I love simple pasta salads like these, and this one is definitely joining the rotation.

I doubled the recipe and followed it to the T (minus most of the olive oil) and this was amazing.  My whole family loved it (and there is 6 of us)  Thanks for sharing

I thought this was very good. I did change it somewhat. I used around 7 slices of bacon and ended up dumping half the grease. I didn't use the oil at all. I put the spinach in with the bacon like others suggested.I used fresh tomatoes and scallions, but didn't cook them. Instead I put them in the pan after everything else was mixed. I don't like mushy tomatoes. I also added lemon juice. It sounds unpleasant, but if you like lemons, you'll like the juice in it. I then topped it with shredded parmesan and asiago cheese. Very Good!

Great taste.  I did not have garlic (left it out) add the spinach to the bacon and fried it as others sugested - gave it a great taste.  Used fress small tomatoes.

This was very good...easy, quick, flavorful! I gave it a 4 because I plan to make 2 changes next time...first, I plan to drain off some of the bacon grease before adding the garlic. Second, I plan to add onions. But otherwise, this was a family hit!

Not that good. I really thought the bacon was out of place. The basic idea of the diced tomato, pasta & spinach was good. But this recipe didn't work.
also, i didn't like draining the pasta over the spinach. you end up with clumps, just like others complained about. Add your spinach to the pasta immediatley after you drain, it wilts just enough and stays nicely dispersed throughout the pasta.

I made this for my mom for Mother's Day, and she really liked it. I thought it was a bit on the bland side, but she doesn't care for highly-seasoned foods. It was perfect for lunch on a warm day: more filling than just a salad, but not too heavy. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I really liked this, but I did have to make some modifications because I had no spinach at home.  Next time I'm following it to the letter and expect it to be wonderful!  I added chopped onion to the bacon and garlic, and I used turkey bacon and whole wheat penne.  I also stirred in about a 1/2c of shredded mozz once I'd tossed everything, and will probably do this or add parmesan every time I make it.  I had seconds, which I almost never do, and my husband asked me to fix the leftovers for his lunch(added some leftover baked chicken cut up at his request).  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I love this recipe.  I have made it twice now.  I like it as is but I think it is something that could be switched up every now and again.  The second time, I did cook the spinach with the tomatoes and garlic (after draining some of the bacon grease).  Also, I reserved some of the grease and made a cream sauce as well.  Both times I have eaten it, I think about putting sun-dried tomatoes in it.  I think that would be great too.

In my opinion, this recipe was a little off. I followed the recipe to the T. The only thing I changed was, I added onion, roasted red pepper, fresh tomatoe instead of canned and grilled chicken. The dish was way too greasy and heavy. Maybe it was because the bacon I used was not quality bacon. It was too smokey and the flavor was....not a hit. I suggest using high quality bacon. Make sure the spinach doesn't overwilt, pour out a little of the bacon grease and add a little pasta water, add fresh basil, some shreaded parm. and maybe a differant shaped pasta would help too. Sorry to leave a bad review but I was very disappointed with this recipe and this website hardly ever produces a dish like i made today. Procede with caution, because it does have potential.

This was pretty good!  My 11 yr old (who only likes frozen spinach - not fresh) liked it also.  I only used two strips of bacon and when it was almost done I stirred in chopped red onion and the garlic.  I also added 8 oz tomato sauce with the diced tomatoes.  I added the fresh baby spinach when the dish was hot, put a lid on it so the spinach would wilt and like so many others I finished it with some freshly grated parmesan. I'm sure we will be making this often because it's a quick, delicious meal.

Pretty good.  Followed original recipe, but next time will wilt spinach in the skillet with bacon instead of in the colander with the noodles because the spinach came out in one big lump.  Also, will add more olive oil to the final toss.

This was good and easy.  I could not understand why you would add oil to the pan before cooking bacon but I decided to try it and see why.  What a great idea. The bacon pieces crisped up evenly and didn't stick to the bottom of the pan.  I did end up getting rid of almost all the grease though.  The only change I would make is not to add the olive oil at the end.  It made it too greasy for us.  Would make this again with that change.

This was good but i made some adjustments to fight the battle of 'blandness.'  I doubled the bacon, i cooked the spinach in the skillet, and i ended up tossing it with a handful of parmesan cheese.  My father wanted his sprinkled with mozzarella.  So in the end i guess i ended up with a parmesan pasta with spinach and bacon.  It made a nice, light, side dish.

Excellent, simple, and quick!!  Just what we like in our active household!! The only thing I did different was to add an entire pound of bacon and since my family is ALL about the cheese I topped this great recipe off with shredded parmesan cheese...DELICIOUS!!  Also, instead of using straight olive oil, I used some of our favorite dipping oil for bread.  I also added some mushrooms before I put the tomatoes in.  The dipping sauce added a nice flavor.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!  It is now a household favorite!

DELICIOUS!!! This was really good, I had to make a few adjustments though because I didnt have penne.  So i used farfalle(bowties). I also didnt have diced tomatoes, so i used crushed.  It was sooo good.   I know some reviews stated that they didnt like wilting it, but I actually think thats a wise thing because if you sautee the spinach it wilts down to almost nothing.  I cooked the bacon till crispy, and drained.  Added sliced red onion and garlic just until slightly tender.  After i drained the pasta over the spinach, i put in a large pasta bowl so that the spinach would be on top and salted a little.  Then added the sauce. Tossed and added parmesan cheese.  MMMM i love the little crunch the bacon gave and it was sooo good!

My family and I loved this recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly but did add fetta cheese on top.  It is a very pretty dish with the green and red, makes a nice presentation.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Simple and delicious!  I decided to not use the olive oil at all...bacon is greasy enough, so I just cooked and drained that, added my garlic and a 19oz tin of tomatoes with garlic/olive oil.  I added a few handfuls of fresh spinach to that mixture and then added a few handfuls while I was draining my pasta.  Mixed all together and voila, dinner!  Fresh grated parm on top and it was yummy!  Would definitely love to try with turkey bacon, only used regular as I had some to be used up.

This is a good and very easy to make dish. All of the ingredients complimented one another very well. After following the recipe, in the end I added just a touch of cream to the sauce and it was delicious. However even without the cream added the sauce is great!!  This is a tasty meal!!

I'm giving this 3 stars because my husband seemed to enjoy it, but I wouldn't rank it as one of my favorites.  It was a nice dish to try, and tasted pretty good, but didn't really stand out at all.  I think I would have liked it better with half the amount of pasta, then there wouldn't be quite so much plain, blah pasta to eat in addition to the smaller amounts of spinach, bacon, tomatoes, etc.  Thanks, anyway!

This was a very simple recipe to make.  The only change I made was I omitted the olive oil and added diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil.  It was great.  My picky 6 year old loved it and my one year old could not get enough.  Will definately make it again.

The dish is very tasty.  I think when I make it next time I will not cook my bacon untill it's crispy.  I didn't really like the crunch when I bit into one.  Also, I don't recommend adding oil to cook the bacon in because it has enough grease on it's own.  I drained the bacon fat as well.  THX.

The addition of some Parmesan cheese on top takes this from okay to really good.  I love that it's a tasty dish than can be made in a very short time. Will definitely make again.

My husband & I love this recipe! My kids weren't thrilled, but did finish it.  The only things I did differently were to use whole wheat rotini pasta, baby spinach, and parmesan cheese on top.  Sensational! Will make again & again!

Very delicious! Quick, easy, and even tasty the next day! I would never think to use the water from the noodles to wilt the spinach but doing this saves time and extra work! I also added mushrooms to this recipe. A++++!!!!

Quite yummy. I only had turkey bacon in the house, so I used that. I also tossed in some sauted red onion. A little fresh parmesan on top might be a good addition next time. I served this with baked eggplant rounds and enjoyed my meal

This is some good stuff!  Since I had a 16 oz. box of noodles I added 2 more slices of (Hickory Smoked) bacon.  I did use the first T of oil but I ended up draining over half the grease anyway so it wasn't needed.  After I cooked the garlic I then added the spinach to wilt it that way.  Then added the tomatoes that I partially drained.  Topped that with some freshly ground pepper and a sprinkling of basil.  Didn't add the last T of oil either since there was still plenty of grease from the bacon to coat everything.  Perfect dinner for a warm day!

Very good and very easy! I made small alterations which added a bit more flavor.  I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and it was much more robust, plus I experimented with different seasonings (parsley, cilantro, oregano).  I also used a pound of bacon, although I think proscuitto would work well too.  Will definitely make this again, especially when we need dinner in 30 min. or less.

Worthy of making again!!!
This could even be a great pasta dish to take to a party
I usually never change up a recipe, but I did just a little...
I used 1/4 cup bacon bits, green onions, a little of frozen spinach (Couldn't find fresh at the store), can of diced tomatoes that already had garlic, basil and oregano and added already cooked - grilled chicken. Didn't use any oil 
Thank you for a delicious dish!!!

Very good regarding the pure unchanged recipe. Light, tasty, filling!

After one alteration (added fan fried cubed chicken breast) it really added a bit more dimension plus some extra protein!

I'd be interested in trying this with some pesto!

It lacked a little punch, and I even used diced tomatoes which were canned with balsamic vinegarette and olive oil.  I did drain the bacon after cooking, so that may have been it.  Next time I may try some fresh herbs.  Otherwise, a very good quick meal! And a break from the old spaghetti and meatballs.

This is such a delicious pasta dish! My bacon was pretty fatty, so I only used 3 pieces and drained the fat off after it was cooked. No olive oil necessary. Then I sauted sliced mushrooms in the pan, followed by 3 chopped roma tomatoes and several handfuls of spinach. I crumbled the bacon separately to sprinkle on top of each plate's worth because I didn't want the bacon to be soggy when we have the leftovers. The mushrooms were fantastic and next time I'd like to use whole cherry tomatoes. With salt and lots of pepper, this was a really good and quick pasta dish that I will surely make again.

This was great! I have it from time to time for lunch, mostly in the winter when the tomatoes are not good, as this calls for canned tomatoes. I would recommend this to anyone asking for a good pasta salad with spinach.

Its rare that I cook, usually I buy prepared bags of frozen meals but this recipe was SOOOOO easy.

I didn't have spinach or olive oil and it still came out EXCELLENT.

I added ground beef and monterrey cheese at the end and it was excellent.

I love EASY recipes.

Like everyone else I made a couple changes...  used whole wheat pasta; put spinach, garlic, tomatoes in saute pan w/olive oil; microwave precooked bacon and chopped it up to put in the mix; then topped the entire thing with a couple tablespoons of mozzarella...  absolutely fantastic!!

I loved how easy and delicious this was! I made it just as the directions say, and I could not believe how yummy it was with so few ingredients. We served it with grated parmesan.

I made this for dinner last night using pre-cooked bacon (found near the salad stuff) and a little bit of onion.  It was a huge hit!  So quick and easy...and lots of flavor from very simple ingredients.

This is delicious.  I used bacon we'd already cooked, so maybe it took a bit away from the flavor since there wasn't any of the bacon's grease in the pan.  But, it's healthier without.  My husband and I added feta cheese to the top and that really added great flavor.  I also tried something very similar to this in a restaurant and it had pine nuts in it.  I think I will try adding some next time.

This was fairly good!  My husband made it for me tonight because i'm starting to try healthier things.  Keeping in mind that this is a pretty healthy dish, I was a little upset that I didn't taste much flavor in it...but it's hard to create a healthy meal exploding with flavor as well.  I followed the recipe to heart and didn't change anything either.  So I give this 4 stars. Not bad at all, and I will be making it again...this time, adding a few of my own ideas to it. 

Thank you for sharing!

This was good but I made some slight changes.  I added the spinach to the rest of the sauce so that it could be infused with the flavors of the bacon garlic and tomatoe. I added a little salt and quite a bit of pepper.  To round out the flavors I added just a small amount of sugar and a squeeze of lemon. I mixed the pasta with the sauce and then added grated parm to the finished product. Delisious!!

This was really good, but I thought it was really rich...almost too rich. And I only used 6 pieces of bacon. If I make it again, I will probably drain some or all of the bacon grease before I add the spinach.

This will become a regular dish in our house! We  added mushrooms and topped it with a little cheese. We also used roasted red peppers instead of tomatoes. 

A great, very quick dinner!

I looked at this recipe and needed something simple to make for dinner. When I saw the picture it looked yummy. I wasn't very excited for the spinach. However when I made this dish today. It turned out fantastic. I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. I also used a mini food processor to mince the garlic it turned out very well. I also used Organic extra-virgin olive oil. This was all super yummy. I didn't think it would be I was wrong.

Fabulous!  Easy & good for you!  I used a bag of spinach and cut the pasta amount in half because I like more veggies.  I also put the spinach into the tomato mixture to wilt it.  Highly recommended!

This dish was delicious.  I wasn't sure how well the spinach would wilt with the method of draining the pasta over it, but it worked well.  I would suggest using a lot of spinach because it wilts down to almost nothing.  I am not sure how much I actually used (it filled up my colander) but when I got done it sure didn't look like a lot.  My husband raved about this dish and ate about 3 big plates full.  It's easy and different.  I used fire-roasted tomatoes because that's what I had on hand, and it worked well.

I whipped this up as a last minute dinner. I didn't have any bacon on hand, so I used shrimp and threw in a little feta cheese.  We all loved it!  Even my very picky preschooler ate his fair share. Excellent way to get him to eat some spinach. Will definitely make this again.

I wilted the spinach into the pasta at the end and topped with parmesan cheese. The finished dish is very bright and colorful but not as flavorful as I had hoped for. Will probably make again and maybe add something like mushrooms or sausage.

Fixed this as a quick side dish for dinner and we all loved it.  Followed the recipe, but I saved a cup of the hot pasta water to add to the finished dish to make a bit more sauce.  Crushed red peppers and parmesan cheese on the side were the perfect add-ons.  Will definitely make this one again.

Great recipe!
Used pre-cooked bacon and bagged baby spinach to make it easier. Turned out super yummy. May use an extra 1/2 can of tomatoes next time just to give it a little extra sauce. 
I like this recipe because there are so many different ways you can change it up. 
I bet Feta Cheese in it would be great, as some other viewers suggested!

I'm giving the recipe 4 stars as is. I loved the easy way it went together and the fresh light taste. I think it also could be a great base for adding things you like that would pump it to a 5 star. Some ideas I plan to try are mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, and perhaps chicken or shrimp instead of the bacon. Oh, I did leave out the olive oil as I felt it wasn't needed.

Yummy and easy!!  I added the spinach to the bacon/garlic/tomato mixture; let spinach wilt, then added cooked pasta and feta cheese (approx 3/4 cup).  My son, who is not a spinach lover, had 2 helpings.

This was really good.  The family really liked it.  I did drain the bacon before adding the other ingrediants.  I also pan grilled  a little bit of chopped onion with the bacon.   I also added crumbled Feta cheese to the mixture.  Serve with some hot french/garlic bread.  YUMMY !!!!

This was a quick and healthy meal.  My whole family loved it.  I didn't get the bacon quite crispy enough but it was still tasty.

Based on reviews, I doubled up on seasonings and added another can of diced tomatoes. It still seems a little bland to me, maybe adding cheese or stewed tomatoes would help.

I served this as a first course for 10 people (smaller portions) and it was perfect!  Everyone raved.  My spinach didn't wilt quite enough and so I might wilt it separately.  But everyone said it was excellent.

this is soooo good and soooo easy.  i did make a few changes...i added onion in with the bacon and used a large can of tomatoes...which made plenty of sauce.  you may also want to drain off the bacon grease.

After reading all the reviews I was so excited to make this for dinner...but was pretty disappointed. My hubby and I found the taste pretty bland. Added some jarred pasta sauce and salsa which helped a bit.

My husband actually cooked this one for us.  It was so good that even my picky 2 yr old ate it.  We added grated parm cheese, and next time will add a splash of white wine or lemon juice while it simmers.  Great way to get kids to eat spinach!

Very quick & great left-overs. I also added asaragus & chicken so it had a bit more variety.
