Very easy and not too sweet - perfect with a scoop of ice cream.  If the cake sank in the middle it was either under cooked - check with a tooth pick in the center or your batter was too wet.  Mine took exactly 35 minutes.

Not quite sure what to rate it. The taste is fantastic but the cake was sunken in the middle and it was very crumbly... Updated: I live at 6000ft and I believe that the ingredient combination here is rather difficult for high altitude. I tried the Favorite Old Fashioned Gingerbread recipe from here also and that worked at over 7000 ft. So, if you live at high altitudes, I might suggest using the proportions in that recipe and the adjust the spices according to your tastes.

Much better than the other, more-reviewed gingerbread cake on this site. This has 1/2 cup molasses, much, much better than a whole cup like the other recipe. When I made the other one, everyone's reaction was: the molasses taste is so strong. 

This recipe is perfect. I had to use my electric mixer for about 30 seconds at the end, when combining the flour with the liquids. First I stirred with a spoon, then smoothed it all out with the electric mixer very briefly. 

I didn't make the glaze, because I am using this as the gingerbread base for the Eggnog Trifle on this site. This is so easy and good, there is no need to buy boxed cake mix again.

35 minutes was exactly right. I was afraid I had overbaked it, but when it was cool an hour later and I cut into it, it was moist and perfect.

I will add another teaspoon of ginger next time, and may sub the Chinese Five Spice for cloves, as that flavor was slightly medicine-y to me. 

So my advice is: use cloves instead of Chinese Five Spice, add another tsp of ginger, and otherwise make and bake exactly as directed.

This is definitely moist and very easy to make.  The texture is wonderful, but the lemon glaze just doesn't work for me (and I like lemon!).  My husband thinks it is "OK" and he is extremely easy to please.  The Chinese Five Spice adds a bit of a black licorice flavor, which really stood out, so next time I will leave that out.  I used 2 1/2 tsp of ginger and it was not enough for us, so I will probably use 4 tsp of ginger.  I will replace the lemon glaze with a ginger/cinnamon glaze (1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup milk, ginger and cinnamon to taste.  To reduce the oil, I used about 3 TBSP of oil and the remainder of the 1/2 cup was milk and some cream. I always do this when oil is called for in quick breads, cakes, etc and it always works (using just milk works, too, though the fat from the cream gives a nice rich texture. Chef John's techniques are great!  I love his videos and am still learning...how fun!!

I really liked the molasses flavor and spiciness of this cake! I think the lemon glaze is also a nice touch - it makes it feel a little fancier, but you can still put whipped cream on it. I made it twice, exactly as directed, and 35 mins was a perfect cooking time.

cake came out really nice.. maybe a little dry when I made it but delicious nonetheless. I used a 9" spring form tin and made two cakes.. then layered it with a lemon cream cheese frosting.. quite useful for a birthday cake and the stronger the lemon taste in the frosting the better. overall a really nice cake

This is my go to gingerbread cake recipe.  I did not change any measurements, but used whole wheat flour with perfect results. I don't have the Chinese five spice, so I left out that. It's so moist and wonderful that I don't make the glaze, just serve it up as is. So easy!  Thanks!

Ilove this simple recipe. I will change this-no boiling water, no molasses, no spice except almond extract- 1/8 tea. 2 tablespoons dry ground ginger, fresh Tumeric in grinder 6 tablespoons. MMM.

For me, there was just too much molasses, if I make this again I will half it. Otherwise good flavor.

I baked this cake this morning. It turned out exactly like the photograph and is deliciously light and fluffy despite the 1/2 cup of treacle. I highly recommend the recipe, although when I next make it I might leave out the Chinese 5 spice powder, and replace it with the equivalent amount of ground ginger. The lemon glaze is necessary to counter the richness of the cake. Do try it. It is so simple to do.

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes. It came out perfectly !  I only 1 1/2 the glaze. This was so simple and delicious!  Definately a new family favorite.

EXCELLENT we enjoyed . Very strong spice flavour though.
For me maybe less molasses next time. 
Added a drop of anise and sprinkle of cloves for the 
5 spice ing.  Very dark cake. I liked lemon glaze.
I usually slice a piece of cake in half  put apple sauce between and whip cream on top. Strong flavour was kind of good.

I baked mine in a bundt pan. Same time in the oven. I added some orange zest and orange juice for half of the water. When I make it again I will reduce the oil by half and add apple sauce instead. Very yummy-my daughter loved it. I did not put on the glaze - wonderful without.

Family reviews were mixed.  Two of us loved the lemon glaze, but felt  the cake itself was too gingery.  The lemon-hater liked the cake but couldn't get past the glaze.  Cake texture was great, and I poked holes in the top to let the glaze seep in, which made it more moist and helped offset the gingery spiciness.  I liked the flavors of ginger and lemon together, just thought the ginger was too much.  I'd be open to making it again, cutting the ginger in half.  Also subbed 1/8 tsp cloves and 1/8 tsp allspice for the 1/4 tsp five-spice, which I didn't have.

I made this twice; once with regular flour and once with Cup 4 Cup gluten free flour.  They were both fabulous but the gluten free was actually better.  The only things I did different was that by accident I put a little more molasses in the gluten free gingerbread (overflowed measuring cup) and I used allspice instead of Chinese 5 spice.  I will be making this on a regular basis.

This was PERFECT. 

The cake was unlike what we were expecting when we had a taste of the batter before cooking, but we were pleasantly surprised. 

I did improvise a little with the spices due to my bag of cinnamon being a bit old, but it was perfectly spiced. 

I loved the glaze, but I'm curious to see what it would be like with a caramel icing. A local retailer sells a cake similar to this and they top it with caramel icing, my boyfriend raves about it.

It was too much molasses for us.  It was just okay.  I would not make it again.  I had the same problem like some of the other reviews, it sank in the middle, not a lot, but did just a bit.  But it was not undercooked in the middle or anything like that.  I kept it 6 minutes longer than the recipe said but likely that is just my oven.

I really liked the cake itself and the unusual flavoring to it. It was moist and perfect. I stuck to the recipe other than substituting applesauce for half of the oil. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x12" pan. I made the lemon glaze according to the recipe. If I made it again, it will be minus the lemon glaze, but that's just a preference. My family members who tried didn't like the lemon on the cake much at all. I added whipped cream to the lemon glaze and it was great!

Very good, and very easy to make.  I didn't use the lemon glaze because I had a lot of lemon curd for topping.  I added a shredded carrot just to sneak in a bit of vegetable, which added a bit of chewiness to it.  Very tasty.

My gingerbread turned out fantastic.  I used coconut oil and under-baked the recipe by about seven minutes (the toothpick was clean).  My mother taught me to under-bake to make sure cake was moist.  It was perfectly done throughout in a Wilson square pan.  It was rich, but the lemon made it taste very "clean".  We indulged by topping it off with homemade whipped cream, but it didn't need that to be a grand dessert.  I highly recommend using coconut oil for cakes for the moisture and for the health benefits.

It was AWESOME! I was a little skeptical about the lemon glaze, and it was certainly interesting. But not in a bad way. This is definitely going into our keeper file. With or without the glaze.

This made the house smell absolutely wonderful when baking.  i didn't have chinese 5 spice and couldn't justify buying a bottle for such a small dab to the recipe so used a bit of allspice in place.  I also added a tad of fresh grated ginger to it as well.  The flavor of this gingerbread is spectacular; perfectly spiced, perfect perfect.  However the problem I had was like others have mentioned.  1. I did have a couple of slightly sunken spots soon after taking out of the oven but nothing too bad.  2.  dryness.  This is the only downfall.  the cake tester came out clean, 35 minutes was perfect but it was just a tad too dry from midportion to the bottom.  the lemon glaze (spectacular and adds brightness and demention) soaks into the top layer like a sponge so that was moist enough.  I WILL make this again but next time, I will add maybe 1/4 cup applesauce to add some moisture to it.  Other than that, it was great.  one bowl preparation!

I actually only made the lemon glaze for a lemon, blueberry cake. The glaze was simple to make and really moistened the cake.

Made recipe exactly as stated, mostly because of the glaze: my Meyer lemon tree has produced lots of lemons. Really liked both the flavor of the cake and the glaze. In my oven it was done in 30 minutes. Next time may try less time.

This is excellent. Very moist . Beautiful flavor. I made one change and used mace instead of Chinese five spice as I'm not a fan.  I also did not do the lemon glaze. It didn't need it. Folks raved. Somebody cried. The hubs ate half in one sitting.  This is in my GoTo recipe file.

I was providing snack for a choir so I took LoriA’s advice and doubled the gingerbread recipe, made 1 1/2 of the glaze and used a 9”x13’” pan. I liked bonn4and’s advice of using cloves instead of Chinese 5 spice. Other than that, I followed the recipe. It was moist, but not sunken or crumbly as some other reviewers wrote, and I didn’t think the molasses overpowered it. I got lots of compliments and will use this recipe forever when I feel the need for gingerbread.

Did not make the lemon glaze, but followed the cake recipe (minus the Chinese spice) and it was marvelous!!  Thank you for an amazing gingerbread cake recipe - family loved it!
Not everyone in the family likes lemon, so I left the glaze off.  But, I love lemon with gingerbread, so I made a lemon sauce for myself and it was so yummy with this cake.  Will definitely make again!

The cake had a good flavor and I loved the lemon glaze, but I was disappointed that the cake fell in the middle.  I will definitely make this again, hopefully with better results.

I didn't have Chinese 5 spice so I added ground Cardamom in its place. A lovely cake, very moist and delicate. I really like how the top of the cake was a bit sticky from the glaze.

I was interrupted while making it and failed to add the baking soda.  Was quite surprised at the time how flat it was. However, taste was good, very brownie like texture and I will make it again with the soda. I thought it was a little too lemony. I did not have Chinese 5 spice so used allspice.

This tastes just like the gingerbread cake my mom used to make -- and I had totally forgotten about it until I read this recipe. It's the perfect holiday treat. The lemon glaze adds a whole other dimension. Mine turned out moist, perfectly spiced and delicious. I liked that I didn't have to drag out the mixer, too. I might go have another piece now -- yum!

You can never go wrong with Chef John, and this recipe is another example.  This cake is delicious; there's something about it that feels very old fashioned.  Yes, BUY the Chinese five-spice powder and don't try to substitute; it makes a big difference.  I use a black, hearty molasses; none of that grocery store stuff.  Yes, be sure to use the glaze.  I found I had to bake an extra 10 minutes.  Enjoy!

Wow! This cake packs a powerful flavour wallop but be warned that if you don't like molasses you might not like this cake. My changes: didn't have the 5 spice so left it out, used brown sugar instead of white but wouldn't do it again (didn't need the additional molasses flavour), made a mistake and added 1 c. boiling water instead of the required 1/2 c. (cake didn't seem to suffer any for that. In fact, it may have alleviated the dryness some other reviewers commented on). Loved the contrast between the ginger and the lemon glaze. I didn't use the zest in the glaze. Just used bottled lemon juice and the icing sugar. I did poke holes in the warm cake with a meat fork so the glaze would soak into the cake. Moist, flavourful and simply delish! A winner in our house!

This recipe came out really nice. The cake is light and not too sweet, and the glaze compliments it. I would make it again. Its on my recipe list now

I didn't use the glaze (just too much sugar for my preference), but served the cake with Chef John's Lighter Lemon Curd, which was an incredible pairing.  The flavour of the cake is great, but it came out a bit too dry and I also had the centre drop on me.  It's likely my fault, since I didn't tweak the flour / baking soda amounts for my elevation (over 4000 feet here), but I wanted to try the recipe exactly as written.  This will be my base recipe from now on, with the elevation corrections, since the flavour is so good.

Superb. The only demerit is the sinking in the middle. So tasty...got many compliments. Very moist and not too sweet.  So glad I found this recipe!

I was a little disappointed because I really love old fashioned ginger bread and this is not what I would call gingerbread.  
It is a delightfully very light moist ginger spice cake. The ginger flavor is somewhat overpowered by the lemon glaze but I would not have liked the cake as much without the glaze.  
I would recommend to top with a a dollop of sweetened whip cream when serving.

Excellent flavors. Moist, delicious and I'll definitely make this again. Maybe not in the fluted silicone baking "pan" I used though, since the top flew away from the bottom while plating. My mishap aside, this was a great find. Thanks Chef John - You're an inspiration :)

Made this and it was great. I loved the flavor combination of the lemon vs ginger. Followed recipe and came out just as described.

Some difficulty for the middle!  It was moist and very flavorful...
