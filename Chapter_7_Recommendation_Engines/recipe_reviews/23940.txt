No one really cared for this dip, even my husband that eats everything. He didn't like the balsamic vinegar. I think fresh chopped tomatoes would have tasted better.

It's a nice twist on your traditional hummus.  But be prepared, it's a little sweeter than you might imagine because of the tomatoes.  Makes a LOT so really good for parties.

I made this for a Mediterranean-themed dinner party and it was well-received.  I halved the recipe, used yogurt instead of sour cream, and cut back the sun-dried tomatoes by half.  The tomatoes gave it a nice flavour.  I'll definitely be making this again.
