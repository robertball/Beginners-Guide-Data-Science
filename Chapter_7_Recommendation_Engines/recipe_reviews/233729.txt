I just happen to have all the ingredients and decided to make this tonight. My husband was shocked on how tasty, good and right on the money it was.  I did not have red wine vinegar so I used red wine instead.  So easy and fast to make. Very tasty. I would and will make it again.

I didn't quite know what to expect from this recipe since it was made with ground turkey and used so much chili powder.  I had never had a sloppy joe with chili powder before.  I was pleasantly surprised and my husband kept telling me he would never know it was turkey.  Very flavorful!   The only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 of a chopped green pepper.

I make this quite often. It is simple and quick on a weeknight and my family loves it. I never add the mustard and sometimes use apple cider vinegar which makes it a little sweeter.

This recipe was OK. I used it because it was the simplest and fastest recipe I could find quickly. The smell when making this turned my wife off bad enough that she wouldn't even try them, but the actual taste was good, just not great.

Awesome! Great with turkey or beef. I like to chop up a bit of bacon and add it. To die for!

I feel bad doing this but I just couldn't eat this. Nor would my other family members. I tried doctoring it up, but to me the death of the recipe was the addition of the chili powder. Without it, it might have been OK.

I didn't have hamburger buns so I made homemade biscuits to go with it and this recipe was awesome. The only change I made was that I added some red,yellow and orange sweet bell peppers cause I know turkey ground meat dosen't have much flavor. This recipe is going in my favorites book. No more canned sloppy joes for my family.

No changes to recipe.  Was spicy enough for husband and mild enough for me.  A different way to use ground turkey.  Will make again.

Had all the ingredients And made exactly how listed. I do not love turkey or sloppy joes, but this recipe was great. Cut back on the chili powder if you don't like it too spicy.

Ground Turkey isn’t my favorite but it was surprisingly good! I posted two photos on this recipe! I like tangy, maybe add one tablespoon yellow mustard and one bell of green pepper.

I will probably never eat premade sloppy joe mixes ever again. This was the best sloppy joe I have had. I highly recommend this recipe for all to try.

I made these tonight and I loved the flavor, color and texture! I wasn’t sure how the turkey would taste but it came out just like beef if not better. Will definitely add this to my recipe box.

This was super easy to make and so good! I didn’t change anything other then adding some spices and garlic. I served it over a bed of brown rice. Delicious!

Delicious! I added garlic when you cook the onions and I also added red pepper flakes. I don’t like the heavy ketchup taste usually so I use 3/4 cup ketchup and add another 1 teaspoon of additional chili powder. ????

Made it exactly as instructed except subbed apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar. Buttered some buns and lightly browned them in a sauté pan prior to constructing the sloppy joe sandwiches. My 6 year old at THREE sandwiches for dinner ... she loved them so much! This will go into regular rotation. So quick and easy!

So easy!!! I have been using turkey for years and most don’t care for the taste VS beef. But I won them all over with this! Add some salt and garlic extra chili powder for some spice!

I absolutely love this recipe!  It's my go to turkey recipe when I'm over chicken and beef.   As far as taste, I actually like it better than sloppy joes with beef and the fact it's made with a healthier alternative makes it all the better.  One note:  I've tried it with ground turkey breast and ground turkey thighs and it only works with the thighs.  The turkey breast just doesn't fit.

1st time made the recipe accordingly and liked the base flavors but needed some personal flare. Changed it a bit for out taste 2nd time around. Added shredded zucchini, one more T. Brown sugar and one more T. Ketchup and oregano. We just like like it a bit sweeter and sloppy. Great base recipe!!!

Made this last night pretty much exactly how the recipe suggested except for the ketchup. Instead of 1 cup of regular ketchup I used 3/4 of a cup and 1/4 banana ketchup. It added a nice sweetness and kick to it. 

Also we stuffed the sloppy joe meat into whole grain pitas with a salad mix instead of the typical bun. Yummy!

I'm always trying to change it up and use more turkey vs. beef.  This is a good weeknight recipe that the kids liked.  I pared it with the sunflower coleslaw and some potato wedges.  For added flavor, I served it with some avocado wedges on top.  That added a nice flavor and texture to the meat mixture.

These were really good! I used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon because that's all I had.  I didn't measure exactly, just kind of tasted my way through guesstimating the amounts of the ingredients listed. My family loved them and my son asked me to to take a sandwich for lunch tomorrow. Thumbs up!!

Loved it! I left out the chili pepper and instead used jalapeño ketchup. It gave the dish a yummy flavor. I also left out the Dijon mustard and used apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar just because that's what we had. Finally I added a chopped green pepper. Very delicious! We ate it for dinner and the leftovers didn't last long!!

Love this recipe. I was supriced on how delicious it was. The only thing I did add was a little garlic salt and half a jalapeño that way the sweetness can balance out. But other than that I used everything said and it was GREAT. I will be using this recipe for a while. :) !!
