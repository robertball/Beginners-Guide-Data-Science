Dried chipotles were an ingredient in another recipe I was making.  I was unable to find them and bought a small can of chipotles in adobo instead.  I found this recipe while looking for ways to polish of the aforementioned can.  Had I found the dried variety in the first place, I probably would never have made this recipe.  I am glad I did find it, because the flavors are complex and tasty!    I diced one of the chipotles in adobo and left it in.  There was a little too much liquid for my preference, so I will add more peas or cut the amount of liquid next time.  I also used chicken broth instead of water (and left out the boullion cube).  While the color of the soup will probably keep it out of any food blogs, it could be dresssed up with a sour cream/yogurt garnish for guests.  I will definitely make this again!

I don't know what the reviewer above stated. The instructions for the peas are right there. Yum!

I had expected more depth of flavor than this delivered.  Perhaps it was too much water in proportion to the other ingredients.

Very good soup.  I doubled the pepper to add a bit more zing, and bumped up to 1/3 c Gruyere for creaminess.  Good texture and flavor.

Very good, but I did not care for the cheese that the recipe called for.  I think that I will use mozzarella cheese next time.
