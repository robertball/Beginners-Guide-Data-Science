I've been eyeing my dad's fig tree waiting to get the perfect fig to make this salad...delicious! I didn't have any fresh oranges, so I used mandarin oranges, and they worked out fine. Topped this w/ raspberry vinaigrette...all of the flavors went wonderfully together. I think next time I'll add a bit of red onion too. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I planned on making this recipe as is, but ended up modifying it a bit.  The grocery store I went to didn't have fresh figs so I used golden raisins instead.  I also accidentally got a blood orange (don't ask me how I didn't notice) but ended up loving it in the salad.  I also substituted arugula for the romaine and added some candied walnuts for a nice crunch.  The combination was delicious!

I altered the type of lettuce and cheese used. My husband told me that he didn't like the fresh figs I brought-so I was looking for a different way to present them because we have a fig tree!
Oranges and figs were a good combo.

Delightful salad.  I made my own vinaigrette dressing.  Since the dressing is mixed in at the beginning, it probably doesn't serve well a second time, and as such, you may consider serving the dressing on the side unless you're sure it will all be consumed at the first setting.

I have to admit I wasn't sure about this salad while reading the recipe.  But for anyone who wonders about the mix, it is wonderful!  We have eaten this salad for the last 3 nights.  We love it!

Thanks for the recipe!
