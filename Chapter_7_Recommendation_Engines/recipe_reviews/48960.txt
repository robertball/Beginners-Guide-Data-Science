i have made this mix for years but never knew to use brown sugar. boy was i surprised, it does add to the taste. i had a party and made a pitcher of my standard and a pitcher of this mix with the brown sugar. i marked them a and b served a very small sample of each without the vodka and had them vote. 31 people sampled each and the vote was 27 to 4 in favor of the mix with brown sugar. what more needs to be said. may i add one piece of advice, because tomato juice is so acidic, never by in a can only in a bottle, if not you will taste the can on the roof of your mouth

This may not be the way a bloody mary is supposed to taste, but is definitely the way it should taste! I use this recipe for Bloody Sundays with the gang. I serve with pickled green beans and almond-stuffed olives. HUGE HIT!

We added 16 ounces of vodka and served this at Christmas brunch with a stalk of celery in each hi-ball glass.  Everyone loved them... my husband even made them a bit spicier than the recipe called for.  This one is definitely a keeper for our family.

This was very different.  It was a decent mixed drink, but tasted nothing like a Bloody Mary should taste.

Made this yesterday for the 4th of July and it was really very good. I used lime instead of lemon and it was great! I left the hot pepper sauce out so people could add more if needed. Very nice.

My husband & I love a good Bloody Mary and this was absolutely wonderful!!  Didn't change a thing.  Mixed everything together on Saturday afternoon and enjoyed on Sunday morning.  I had never heard of letting the mixture sit for any length of time, but that really made it work!  And it was tasty whether you like a small or large amount of vodka!!!  This is truely a "keeper" and we will be making this often!

This was SO good and very easy to make. We added more horseradish and hot sauce (personal preference). Much better than store-bought bloody mary mix. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this omitting the steak sauce (just because I didn't have it on hand) and allowed it to sit for about a day and a half.  The result was very good, although I thought the celery salt was a little overpowering.  Next time I'll halve the amount.  If you like things really spicy, I'd suggest upping the amount of horseradish and hot pepper sauce!

This is a great recipe! The second time I made it, I modified to my tastes (I like a lot of spice) by not using the sugar, and bumping up the amount of horseradish and hot sauce to 1 T instead of 1 t. I used Scorned Woman hot sauce which has a heartier flavor than Tabasco sauce. I also added some garlic salt and black pepper to taste. For me, the perfect garnish is a dill pickle spear, a celery stalk, garlic stuffed green olives and a pickled green bean. A jumbo shrimp or two would also taste great as a garnish to this drink.

Best ever!!! We drank it right away without letting it sit 8-12hrs and it was still perfect. I'm sure it gets even better as it sits but we couldn't wait!!

Followed this recipe with one tiny modofication--after pouring mix over vodka, I put in a splash of Claussen pickle juice, then mixed. My fiance and I were getting frustrated after trying several store bought mixes, and we both love this one since we're both Bloody Mary fanatics. Have a beer chaser on the side and this stuff is fantastic!

This is beyond amazing. I don't think I'll ever try another bloody mary recipe again. I drink this with or without any additional spirits (beer, tequila, or vodka).  It makes THE BEST red beer.  Also, sometimes I add a little bit of garlic powder and black pepper.

So disappointing.  Bloody Mary's are my all-time favorite drink and this was probably the worst one I've ever had.  I didn't care for the lemon or the sugar, and the sparing use of any of the flavor components make this a one star.  Glad I tried it before the guests came.  Will be adding more w sauce, hot sauce and celery salt to hopefully redeem it a bit!

Loved this recipe and it got lots of compliments when I made it for a big group on Thanksgiving. We liked it so much, we made it again a week after for a tailgate party. I like mine a bit "spicier", so the second time I added a bit more horseradish and more hot sauce. I definitely think letting it sit for the 8-12 hours really helps boost it's flavor.

Delicious! The only changes I made were to add a dash of lime juice, add hotshot pepper and double the horseradish. For added flavor - definitely let the mix set for a few hours before drinking.

We really enjoyed this Bloody Mary Mix - really loved the addition of the horseradish.  We thought it needed more spice, so added quite a bit of Scorpion Sting hot sauce, rubbed the rim of the glass with salt and pepper, and garnished with celery and olives.  Yum!

Great taste but I didn't like the prepared horseradish floating around. Mine stayed in little chunks instead of blending in.

I made this for a baby shower (it was just the mix because we couldn't serve alcohol), and it was a HUGE hit! I think I ended up adding more seasoning to taste the day of the party.

Pretty good mix! Needs a little beef broth to make it better. I made mix for years...now I just buy Irish Dog. Saves me time and money, not to mention it's better that the mix I made at home.

This is AWESOME!!!  I made Christmas baskets (I canned it) and added some of my home made pickled brussel sprouts, pickles and asparagus.  With a couple of little snacks, what a great gift!!

I didn't really like this mix very much.  I much prefer Clamato for Bloody Marys. My mother taught me never to waste so... To use it up I used this as a base for chili and it was REALLY TASTEY!

I like my Bloody Mary spicy! IMHO, the key to a great Bloody Mary is freshly ground horseradish and lots of it.  I feel like if I'm going to go through the effort to make my own mix, I'm not going to stop short by using a prepared horseradish.   If you've never worked with fresh horseradish, please be careful of the fumes they are powerful, and don't touch your eyes without a proper hand washing.  In this recipe, I use fresh horseradish to taste.  I also use lots of coarsely ground black pepper and I increased the hot pepper sauce. Oh and I omit the sugar.

An A for effort, but who has time for all that?  Try Hot D.  It came acrossed it in Ohio and haven't had anything else since.

I LOVE this recipe. It's easy to make and uses easy to find ingredients. My mouth waters just thinking about making up a batch! I always add a little extra horseradish and use a bloody mary rim salt.

Delicious! I didnt have steak sauce so I doubled the worcestershire sauce. I used Clamato instead of V-8. I could drink this all the time without the alcohol.

Excellent Recipe!! We like it spicy so we used the spicy tomato-vegetable juice cocktail!! We've tried several store bought Bloody Mary mixes and this is by far better and easy to make.

This is a pretty good recipe. But, it's a recipe in progress. The first time I made it, it was a little too much V-8-ish. Next time, I'll spice it up a bit more. This is a good start for those who haven't made Bloody Mary's from scratch before.

I followed this recipe & made no substitutions.  It was ok; I didn't care for the brown sugar although I thought it sounded good.  I may try this again sans the brown sugar & pump up the spice with black pepper.

Fabulous recipe.  Made it for a neighborhood weekend away in the Napa Valley and it got rave reviews. Nothing better then a Bloody Mary after a night of WONDERFUL Friends and FABULOUS Wine. You do not even need the vodka.  Thanks for the recipe.

Been looking for a Bloody Mary recipe for a while now, and I must say I'm not too surprised I found the perfect one from OH-IO.  Followed recipe exactly making NO changes, and it was incredible.  It gets better the longer it sits so make it ahead of time.  Go Buckeyes.!!!!

Well, this is a solid recipe.  Complex, layered flavors.  No alcohol required; it is a delicious drink on its own.
I'm withholding the last star until it sits overnight - if it lasts that long. Very good base and easy to tweak to your individual tastes by adjusting ingredient levels. Will update after we taste it tomorrow! But, for sure it is a keeper.

I feel like I’ve been on a search for an outstanding Bloody Mary recipe all my life. I’ve decided to stop here. This is the best I’ve have had after many false hopes at top notch restaurants. There is almost an addicting quality to this concoction (a really good thing!) that as I savor the spice sweet heat, I can’t hep but guzzle. I mean guzzle!!! I’ve tried (I’m guessing here, but trying to be accurate) 30+ recipes and many pre-mixes; including Demitri’s Bloody Mary mix (but their pepperoni straws are outstanding!). This is still my favorite. Only problem is the recipe calls for 46 ozs of V8. Now they sell it in 64 ozs. so you have some math to do in order to make it oh so perfect. Thank you for sharing this outstanding recipe with us!!

the brown sugar is a different twist but I need pickle juice in mine. Also, a good swap for spice/flavor is banana pepper juice.

Next time I'll skip the steak sauce and double the Worcestershire sauce.  Very tasty, now I need to add Vodka.
After adding vodka I've changed my mind and the steak sauce is a good addition.

Coating the bottom of each glass with a splash of bottled ‘dill sauce’ adds a great flavor to any Bloody Mary. I served it this way when I was a bartender and customers always loved them.

Made this a couple of times now & this is the best Bloody Mary mix recipe I've come across! It's way better than anything you can buy at the store. It is a great recipe, as written, but I've also made it & added 2 tbsp. of spicy garlic pickle juice...YUM! Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good stuff.  I made two pitchers of mix for a gathering.  I didn't use store bought mix because even if it looks vegan, you never know how Natural Flavoring is made.
The brown sugar adds something that is different.  I served with spicy dills, pickled beet wedges, garlic olives, and marinated button mushies.

I tried this the other day. It wasn't super spicy and I think it will work well for a brunch. Good recipe.
