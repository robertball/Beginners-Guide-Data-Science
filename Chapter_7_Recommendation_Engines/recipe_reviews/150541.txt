this is the best candy treat I have ever tasted. I made it for the holidays and everyone who tasted it was amazed how great it tasted. When you bite into it you get an explosion of juicy, tart, sweetness.
And it was so simple to make.

I really appreciate the other reviews.  I would never have tried this recipe and it is too good to miss.  I made them with dark and milk chocolate.  Both quite tasty.  The description of a "juice party in your mouth" says it all.  Try this one!

Absolutely delicious!

As one party-goer raved, "It's a chocolaty juice party in your mouth!"

Easy too!  Used Ghiradelli bitter-sweet chocolate chips.  Yum!

unbelievable!  Love these!  I just melted Ghiradelli dark chocolate chips.  Easy!  Also, make sure the pom. seeds are room temp or it will cool the chocolate too quickly and won't coat smoothly.

Juicy, easy-to-make chocolates. I added a tablespoon of margarine and a couple of tablespoons of milk to the melted chocolate in order to make it softer. Be sure to form small clusters.

i loved this!  its so so simple and quick!  you need to be a fan of pomegranites and a fan of chocolate mixed with fruit though.  my family didnt really want to try them for that reason but they definitely missed out!

the recipe called for a gourmet chocolate, but i just used hersheys special dark and honestly they still tasted awesome.  they were on sale and i got 4 large hershey bars for the price of 1 gourmet bar so i figured might as well.  now that i know i like this recipe, i may try it with the gourmet dark chocolate just to see if its any better!

OH... MY... GOSH.   these were amazing.  I made them for dessert last night when we had company over and they nearly fainted from delight.   all I did was melt a cup of chocolate in the microwave, I didn't bother with the saucepan.  easy peasy and delicious.

I made this because I was craving something simple and sweet. The fact that I love pomegranates and chocolate was an added bonus.  This was great! Just wanted I needed.  I used 2 heavy POMS and mistakenly bought semi-sweet chips instead of bittersweet. But these were still a juicy, chocolatey enjoyment!!!

So unique, and I mean that in the best possible way. It's kind of like eating a chocolate covered strawberry, only with little individual explosions of juice.  It's definately worth trying.

These are yummy! Every time I make them- everyone eats them all within a matter of minutes! I just put the chocolate in the microwave- and mix it in. I like to drizzle mine in white chocolate though- just to make it look fancy!

This is a great, quick and easy treat to bring to parties. Because it is so unique, it's  nice conversation piece as well.  I just happened to have a couple of Poms and gave it a try as I didn't have alot of time to make something.  I plated them on a pretty holiday dish and dusted them with powdered sugar.  I'm going to make them again today and will try white chocolate and will reserve some of the seeds to garnish the plate.

these are heavenly and so easy to make. I used the bakers chocolate you can buy in the bowl and just microwave. It's a great treat!

Interesting to try, but not worth wasting pomgranate seeds over. Make sure the seeds are dry or the chocolate won't stick to the seeds.
