These were great!!! I did add some garlic powder, green onions and extra crispy bacon bits to the cheese filling, which put these over the top! I also didn't scoop all of the veins out of the jalapenos to retain some spice. Made them three times for three separate parties and they were eaten at a rapid clip. Will certainly remember this recipe!

I did add cooked chorizo to the cream cheese, cheddar mixture. Took to an office lunch which started at 11. All gone by 11:30. Candy eyes were weird to me. Might try cream cheese drop w/ caraway etc seed. Or tiny black olive bits.

A little bland and didnâ€™t have much heat. It was enjoyed by my guests and was a creative appetizer.
