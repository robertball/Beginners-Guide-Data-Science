Just one comment on the recipe. If ground cinnamon is used, the mixture will be very dark while cooking but don't be concerned!  it will cool down to the beautiful rich red color we all love with cranberries! I hope you enjoy it as much as my family does!! Aunt Tilly

I boil it down farther and use it on pancakes, and toast as a jam. Love this recipe.

This was so good!  Will not be buying the canned stuff anymore, didn't really like it very much.  This was so easy couldn't believe it.  Who knew?
