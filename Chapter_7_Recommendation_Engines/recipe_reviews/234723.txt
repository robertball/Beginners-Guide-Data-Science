Theses cookies were amazingly soft, my kids loved them as well as my co-workers.  However the one time I made them I had to add about another cup of flour because the first batch I made came out as flat square cookies, added more flour problem fixed.  The next time I made them I didn't add any extra flour but made them into small cupcakes.  All times I added a lot more of the spices and a teaspoon of salt.  

Over all though the taste was good and they were moist and soft, just needed a bit of tweaking.

The texture of these cookies is absolutely amazing!  Cakey, soft- absolutely delightful!  I really didn't think it was flavorful enough, though, even after doubling the cinnamon and vanilla and using a heaping 1/4 tsp of cloves.  I would definitely at least double all seasonings if making again, and sub half of the sugar with brown sugar.  I also found that 2 Tbsp made way too large a cookie, I was much more pleased with them when made with 1 Tbsp of cookie dough.  And maybe sub cinnamon chips for the white chocolate?  The recipe doesn't say to, but I would also grease the pan, these guys like to stick if you don't.  But again- AWESOME texture!  This one shouldn't take much work to bring it up to 5 stars!

The texture was great for these cookies. The others are right about it being bland and very sticky. I used shortening to grease my cookie pans and it kept them from sticking. I used baked pie pumpkin instead of pumpkin puree (the pumpkin flavor was still there). I also tinkered with the spices. I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg, and added 1/2 a teaspoon of ground ginger. I substituted the vanilla extract for cinnamon extract. I did not use any dried orange peel. It turned out great it was a big hit with my family and co-workers.

Rather bland, with a cloying sweetness from the white chips. The first batch stuck badly to the pan, even though I used a non-stick pan. Very disappointing.
