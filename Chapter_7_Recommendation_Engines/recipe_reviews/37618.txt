Terrific!  As others said, excellent base recipe and the possibilities are endless.  I used chicken broth for water, ground flax seed, oat flour, oat bran, and wheat germ for part of the flour and the rest in white flour. Used Italian seasonings, garlic powder, and shredded cheese and also used walnut oil and olive oil to add more omega 3s. Nice to have a healthy alternative to some of the very unhealthy crackers and junk food out there.  As far as making one cookie sheet???  I guess I rolled mine out pretty thin then cuz I used 4 cookie sheets!  Turned out nice and crispy.  Great with cream cheese.

I agree, this is a great basic and forgiving recipe. In rolling it out, I put parchment paper on the cookie sheet, then piled the dough on (I got four cookie sheets worth), put waxed paper on top of it, and then rolled. The crackers were uniformly thin and I didn't have to deal with the usual rolling-out mess. I am a new and ardent devotee of parchment paper!!

I made it with 1/2 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup flax seed meal, and 2 1/2 cups wheat flour.  Then I added 3/4 tsp garlic salt, a sprinkle of parmeasan cheese, and 1/2 Tbsp of italian seasoning.  It rolled out to 3 cookie sheets.  Very good and yummy!  I'll make them again!

Very good and basic.  The only thing I would add is a spray of oil on top so they are not too dry.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil as well.  I also added some herbs to the dough.

I follow a rule when I find and rate recipes on this website: at least the first go 'round, I follow the recipe to the letter and rate/review the result. So for this Wheat Cracker recipe, I didn't change anything when I made it. I understand that many are using this recipe as a jumping-off point for their own creations--that's great! I may do the same the next time I try this recipe. But for the puroses of review, I believe it is unfair to change a bunch of things and then give a review of my creation rather than what the actual recipe produced. That's just me.   So. I have to say that although the dough couldn't have been easier to make and roll out, the recipe did not guide me to roll them out as thin as I should have. I rolled to an 1/8 of an inch or thinner, as the recipe read, but I should have gone thinner still! Like, way thin! Because I couldn't get the crackers crisp enough and I kept baking and checking and baking and checking, past the 40 minute mark, and finally, I gave up. Also they were quite dry and bland. They may have promise to be transformed into something better, but it will take lots of tweaking and trial and error to figure out how to make them tasty.  So this recipe is actually sort of like half a recipe. It's up to you to figure out how to complete it.

I LOVE these!  I used the new white whole wheat flour from King Arthur and used EVOO instead... then added some dried rosemary that I ground up with my mortar and pestle.  I rolled them out nice and thin (I found them very easy to roll)and put them on parchment paper.  I then brushed LIGHTLY with more oil and sprinkled with coarse kosher salt.  YUMMMMM!!!  I also scored them with my pastry wheel for a more professional look.  This makes a LOT of crackers, but that's GOOD because they will last a little longer!  I keep them in a ziploc bag for freshness... and they taste just as good several days later!  Thanks for the excellent recipe, Ray Anne!

These are great. I tried the regular recipe as is (with the exception of using applesauce instead of oil) and I also tried as some people suggested using some spices and sugar. Personally, I thought the original was much better. I don't see a need to add any spices or put oil on top of the crackers before you bake them. I also found that the thinner you get these the better they are and I found that they needed to cook longer than advertised. But, I am making these again today.

what a great recipe! I used my pasta machine to roll out the dough as thin as possible. I used an empty tuna can to cut out round crackers and I sprinkled them with coarse sea salt before baking them. And now I have a box with 58 wonderful wheat crackers! Super! Does anyone have a tip on how to keep them fresh?

I made them 'as is' first, then thought to put some sweet in em next time--comparing to Wheat Thins for instance, so I added in 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and a couple Tbsp of honey.  Quite good this way!  Next time I will change that to at least 2/3 cup of brown sugar, no white sugar, and then some honey.  A little honey on top might be nice as well, I think. Having a little sweetness makes a huge difference! Thanks for a good cracker base!

Boy, what a great, AMAZING recipe! It has endless possibilities, just throw in favorite spice combos. I made them 100% whole wheat and they're terrific.  Fast, easy & fun to make. Healthy too:-)

WOW!  I added a tiny bit of sugar, some onion powder!  Rolled them out nice and thin!  These are EASY and GREAT!  Not too mention so much healthier and cheaper than the "boxed" kind!

So-so. I tried this because I was hoping to find a good alternative to the expensive, salty crackers available in stores. The dough was very tough so I added some water to make it easier to roll out. The thinner the better for these (1/8 of an inch is way too thick). I rolled mine out right on the baking sheet, which worked especially well when the sheet was still warm  as the warmth helped the dough roll out thinner. I used the edge of a ruler to score my crackers. Anyway, all little tips aside, the result was just ok. Good with cream cheese, but what isn't good with cream cheese? Not sure if I'll make this again.

I love these crackers. I make them for my son, who has multiple food allergies and can't eat most store-bought crackers because of the milk, nut and soy content. These are so simple to make. I substitute 1/4 cup flax seed meal in for some of the white flour and use garlic salt instead of regular salt. I also add italian seasoning. I followed the advice of other reviewers to roll this out on parchment and it made it a lot easier. I also scored my lines with a pizza cutter, and I went all the way through the dough. As they baked, they separated, and all I had to do when they were done was fold the parchment to dump them into a bowl. I also had to baked them (two cookie sheets worth) for about 40 minutes, not 20.

Yum!  These crackers were amazing!!  I did make a few changes though.  After reading the reviews I went out and bought a pasta machine for this recipe.  I used olive oil instead of veg. oil and added a little extra salt and some whole flax seed to the dough.  I rolled the dough out really thin, sprayed with olive oil, and sprinkled with garlic salt.  

One thing I did that I think made a difference was after rolling them in the pasta machine I trimmed the edges with a pizza cutter and just had a stack of crackers that needed to be put in the oven.  Before I put them on the cookie sheet I made the preferations with a knife and didn't prick them.  I think that by not pricking them and letting them sit out already rolled, this dried the dough a little and made for a thin crispy bubbly cracker which was exactly what I wanted!

Delicious and healthy crackers. I have made it a few times. I use about 2 cups whole wheat flour and use a mixture of flax seed meal, oat bran, wheat germ, and spelt flour to make up the last 1 1/4 cups of flour needed. I recommend rolling it as thin as possible and baking until golden. The crunchier they are, the better!

You must add flavors you enjoy for this cracker to have flavor. As suggested I used chicken broth instead of water. I added garlic powder, italian seasoning, minced onion and I topped the crackers by brushing them with garlic oil.

After reading the other reviews-I used this recipie as a "base".  I added 2 packages of dry ranch dressing mix and rolled them very thin.  I entered them in the Calif. State fair and won BEST OF DIVISION!! I will be using this recipe and experimenting with other "add ins".  When my daugher came home from school and saw the crackers on a plate, she thought they were "wheat thins"! This recipe is definatly a keeper!

Excellent base crackers, I made with all freshly ground white whole wheat flour except for 1/2 cup I substituted for oat flour. You can make oat flour by whizzing the oats in your blender. I used 1 tsp salt, 1/2 cup vegetable oil and less than the 1 cup water. I also added flax and sesame. Watch out out for burning and you may have to remove the outer parts of the crackers from the oven first before the middle is done. They taste really good with the whole grain flour.

I thought these were great!  I used a combo of whole wheat flour, wheat germ, and flaxseed meal.  I did not use A/P flour.  I subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  I rolled out between wax paper and parchment paper.  I halved the recipe because I wasn't sure if I would like them.  I got 50 one-inch square crackers from the half recipe.  Mine took closer to 40 minutes to bake - probably because of the applesauce and mine might have been a little thicker than some peoples.  Next time I won't be halving the recipe.  They are almost gone, and I just made them two days ago!

This is definitely a good base recipe, and hope to make often.  However, it can be tweaked to make it,  outstanding.
I didn't have any wheat flour, so used 3 1/2 C plain white to no ill-effect.  Also no oil, so just used marg, and it these still turned out very crispy (would still recommend olive oil though)

I would recommend using more salt, as I did a control batch with 1 tsp and they definitely tasted very bland.

Try using bolder flavors like Parmesan cheese to give it a real kick and take it over the edge.  I am trying a onion marmalade and parmesan cheese combo - delicious! (Just dont' use as much water) 
Next time, I plan to use sun dried tomatoes, olives and fresh basil.

Also, Tony's is really nice too.  However, I reiterate the point, these need to be "over flavored" to be just "tasty" as a finished product - it's like the flavor bakes out of them.

Made these today- added fresh grated parmesan cheese, cracked black pepper and garlic powder. SO DELICIOUS!!! I used mini cookie cutters to make cute shapes for my toddler :)
Update: Made again today. Subbed 1/4 cup of cracked wheat for 1/2 cup of the AP Flour and used Olive oil instead of Veg...even better than the first batch!!!

I really don't know whether to give it 4 or 5 stars since I'm only using this recipe as a guide. I'm gluten intolerant & was looking for a good basic cracker recipe to adapt for my needs. It's hard to find basic cracker recipes & this seems to fit well. I've made crackers years ago & they're basically all similar. It's up to the individual cook to personalize the recipe the way they wish to.

But I wanted to add a couple of suggestions for any die-hard home-made cracker fans. It's important to prick the dough all over to help it rise & crisp nicely. If you're going to be making a lot of crackers, it's time consuming. My trick is to buy an inexpensive hairbrush - a round barrel with thick nylon bristles. You can roll it over your dough & prick it evenly quickly. A handheld nylon shampoo massage brush works well too but you can't roll it. Save this just for baking - you'll probably find other uses for it too. :-D

And I saw a trick that a Japanese master chef used when he made noodles that comes in handy. Get two long pieces of wood, square-diameter, that's the thickness that you wish to roll out your dough. Good to have a couple since diff doughs get rolled out in diff thickness. Lay them on either side of the dough you're going to roll out & when your rolling pin makes contact with the wood, it's the thickness you want. Works best if you have those very long rolling pins with no handles as used by professional chefs. I bought a piece of dowel, 2 inches in diameter (good quali

I subbed 1/3 of the oil for sesame oil and sprinkled black&white sesame seeds and coarse salt on top, then rolled lightly to make them stick... They were pretty good, but would've tasted bland if it weren't for the changes. They underbake/overbake easily though, so be careful. I rolled them so thin they started tearing, and made a big flatbread and tore it into pieces after baking, which made them light and crisp and taste like chips (without the oily aftertaste)!

I liked this cracker recipe as written; I do think it is important to sprinkle a good amount of salt on the top. Also, my palate is still adjusting to the taste of whole wheat flour, so I added a couple teaspoons of sugar...next time I think I'll add a bit more. These were very easy to roll out and got really crispy after 20-23 minutes in the oven.

We love these, they are quick and easy, used Kosher salt to top them and used a generous amount.  Rolled them right in the baking sheet as thin as it will go.  It was dry and crumbly, but they are crackers and it held together as I started rolling them.  I'm glad I didn't add more liquid.  I love eating healthy and using wheat to bake.  I had this one with hummas, it was a perfect side to it.  This one's a keeper!

I used olive oil instead of veg. oil, and chicken stock instead of water.  Sprinkled salt, country herb seasoning from Aldi's, cracked pepper, and seeds on top and rolled them in while on the cookie sheets.  Got three sheets out of the recipe, one sheet gets flax seeds, one sesame seeds, and one celery seeds.

Very good. The thinness of the dough is critical.  I don't have a pasta machine so used the parchment paper idea & it was a life saver. I halved the recipe with no problems. Fearing they would not have much flavor, I added 1 tea. Montreal Steak Seasoning to the dry ingredients. I also used olive oil. I would definately make these again.

Excellent!!!! I used all whole wheat flour and 1/3 cup applesauce instead of the oil with a touch extra water.

I also added, to make them more grainy,:
1 tbsp quinoa
3 tbsp sesame seeds
2 tbsp poppy seeds
1 tbsp caraway seeds
2 tbsp whole flax seeds

Wow. I can finally say I've done something I've always considered impossible -- making my own crackers! Emboldened by the simplicity of this recipe, I decided to take the plunge. I cut the servings down to 1/4 (8), because so many people had said they got 3-4 sheets out of the original, and I just wanted a test run in case it flopped. Prep was ridiculously easy and quick, and very forgiving of my sloppy measuring habits. Followed directions exactly, except at the last minute, I threw in some Italian seasoning, a few chia seeds, and a drizzle of honey, just because I felt bold. Rolled it out right in the pan on parchment with waxed paper on top, VERY thin. Took about 15 minutes to bake, and yippee! I now have a tasty, healthy batch of preservative-free homemade crispy crackers in about 30 minutes, tops! Next time I'll get even braver and make twice as many, then maybe the full recipe for the family at Christmas. Oh, and seeing that several have used a pasta machine to make these nice and thin, I almost decided to wait and get one, but I'm glad I didn't. They turned out just fine rolling by hand.

Quick, easy and fun to make.  I scored them with a pizza cutter before putting in the oven.  Makes a great snack and a lot cheaper crackers you can buy!

I couldn't get the crackers to "crisp" like white flour crackers but they were great in their own respect. We made them in fun kids shape. 3 of my 4 children participated with ease. They had fun making their own crackers. We served them a variety of way, shown in my picture with fresh peanut butter, there were also amazing with honey and pressed red pepper flakes.

This turned out surprisingly well! I'd never tried making crackers, but they're cheap. I'll definitely make these again and add some herbs for more flavor as it seems others have done.

We made these in our kindergarten class today.  They turned out great even with many hands to help.  We brushed them with melted butter and then sprinkled with salt.  Served them with the kids homemade butter.  Yum.  They were gone as soon as the cooled enough to eat!

Don't forget to sprinkle the salt on top! Even with the addition of about 1 tsp of dried herbs and seasonings, these still don't have a lot of flavor. Halfway through I remebered to sprinkle the salt on top and it made a world of difference. I also baked the second half of the batch at 375F and I think that made them slightly crispier.

I agree with another reviewer they taste like toasted pita chips. You need to roll these out very thin if not they stay soft and bendable (not appetizing) I did not have a problem with the dough being dry but they were just very bland. I will need to search for another cracker recipe.

really good!! I wanted cheesey crackers so I followed the recipe and added a large handful of bleu cheese crumbles and 1/2 cup shredded colby/cheddar cheese, a couple of splashes of Worcestershire Sauce, and a little bit of onion.  I did have to add a couple of tablespoons more of water to compensate for the extra "stuff"

I used 1 c all-purpose flour, 1/4 c mixed wheat germ/oat bran/flax meal, and 2 c whole wheat flour and these made a fantastic cracker - similar to Wheat Thins.. I thought if you added a bit of sugar they'd taste exactly the same (but we're trying to avoid sugar.  fun for the kids to help with!  they definitely took about twice as long to bake til they were done.

a terrific recipe...what i did was i substituted a 1/3 of a cup of organic natural butter shortening made from grass fed cow's millk...its a healthy source of fat even though its loaded with saturated fats, it is still healthier than veg oil which is loaded with nasty trans fats...i also used wholewheaht flour for the entire dough instead of both w-wheat and white flours, and i rolled the dough using a pasta machine so that it will become quite thin and crispy, there was no need to prick it with a fork because it was extremly thinly rolled because of the pasta machine, if u have a pasta machine then i highly recommend that you use it. makes it really easy, not that it was difficult to begin with...i also brush them with a little of water just before i sprinkle with SEA salt...this helps the salt stick to the crackers...they are terrific with cream cheese, caviar but extremely dilicious with some  chicken liver pate?  or foig rais (if thats how you spell it)

This recipe is only good as a base.  If you prepare it according to the directions it will be very bland and taste like a dog biscuit.  However, if you add a lot of spices, herbs or powdered dressing mix to the dough they come out pretty good.

We must come up with a better adjective than AWESOME! 
My first batch was made with added savoury seasonings and was a huge success. The second, (just out of the oven) is seasoned with cinnamon and sugar with apple juice in place of water. Can't wait to try many other flavour combos’.
Thanks a whole lot for sharing and thanks also for the advice from those who have been there. One thing I have learned is that 300F is a better temp, (to avoid burning.) If a little extra baking time is required, oh well - it's better than trimming and tossing burned portions. The addition of baking powder/soda is also a great tip. Soda can be a better choice if using acidic liquids or coarse cooking oils.
I tend to become obsessed with new ideas so will be trying Cajun, Southwestern, Asian and many other variations. Honey/mustard sounds like a winner.

At first glance, I'd give this a 3 - the recipe as it is not very tasty at all. But with some modifications (as noted by others) this is a really great starting point.  Changes I made: I roughly do half wheat and half white flout and then toss in about 3 T of Wheat Germ, Sub melted butter for the oil and then add a TON of spices to the mix. I roll mine out to 1/16th of an inch and they end up perfect after 15 minutes in the oven. Any thicker and the crackers become chewy. I don't think that we'll be buying crackers at the store anytime soon!

Pretty good! A little more frustrating and time consuming to make than anticipated. . . Anyways, I added a little brown sugar, honey, pumpkin pie spice, and finely chopped pecans. After placing the dough in the pan, I then brushed them with melted honey-butter and sprinkled on a little salt. I recommend rolling them very thin and cutting the crackers apart completely once they start cooking/solidifying a bit. This helps them get crispy. Also, mine took waaay longer to transition from chewy to crunchy. . . at least 30 min. Overall, very tasty! Thanks! :)

These crackers are so wonderfully versatile! I add 1 cup of shredded cheese, 1 teaspoon garlic powder and 1 teaspoon paprika to the dough. I also sprinkle the crackers with garlic salt before I put them in the oven. They get eaten as fast as I can make them!!!

What a great idea!  I used all whole wheat flour, roasted red pepper olive oil instead of veg oil, added 1/4c brown sugar & only lightly salted the top before baking.  I rolled these out very thin on parchment paper & got 4 cookie sheets worth.  Mine took 25-30 minutes to crisp up.  My kids loved these!  Thanks.

What a great base recipe! A batch just came out of the oven, and I could barely allow them the time to cool before I tried one! They are yummy, but I feel that the oil is a little over-powering... could be because I used EVOO, but will probably cut down a bit on that next time - maybe down to 1/4c. They reminded me a bit of a fried tortilla... which might be why it tasted so yummy, lol! Overall though, it was quick to put together and easy to handle. I threw some pumpkin, sunflower, sesame, and flax seeds into the mix as well, along with 1 T. of sugar, just for good measure! I can imagine that the possibilities for this one could be endless!

This is a great versitile recipe. I made two batches - one with a bit of honey and one without. The honey ones seemed to go a bit soft after sitting out for a while, but right out of the oven they were nice and crispy. Make sure you roll them out nice and thin. Parchment paper will really help.

I used spent grain (my husband brewed beer today) to replace one cup of the all purpose flour (put it in the food processor for a 30 sec pulse). I then liberally added italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, pepper and replaced the veg oil for olive oil. I also only needed half a cup of water because the spent grain was still wet. After rolling them out (2 cookie sheets worth) I rubbed olive oil on the crackers and sprinkled with salt and other various spices and seeds. The outside crackers were delicious but inside were good but I would prefer them crispier. Thank you for the base recipe!

These are very good- and simple to make.  I did have to add more oil to get the dough pliable enough to roll out.  As written, the dough was a bit too dry to roll.  After adding more oil (probably no more than a few TBS), it rolled easily.  I will definitely make these again- my family at them all up!

This is a great recipe.  I made crackers a couple of time using a rolling pin, then bought the pasta attachment for or KitchenAid - #4 on the roller is about right for us.  15 min @350 in convection is plenty - maybe too much.

I give this recipe 3 stars because, while it is easy and a great base recipe, it is a little bland as is. As most other readers suggest, you should add spices, cheeses, salt, etc. Once I brushed the tops with olive oil and added spices, they were a tasty snack!   Oh, and I also added millet and flaxseed to the dough in one batch for extra crunch - yum!

This is a very good basic recipe.  I just made them as stated and my daughter & husband both enjoyed them.  I add 1/4 tsp of baking powder to it to make them lighter.  I have also added dried basil, garlic and onion powder.  Tried it with tomato pesto also.  Multiple cracker tastes.  I have a hand crank pasta machine and the final dial down is set at 5 and this yields a nice thin cracker.

I must have done something wrong based on all the other rave reviews.  Mine came out tasting like toasted pita.  I was not a fan at all.

I had to bring something for my daughter's recital and I wanted to do something different from cookies. These were perfect. I ended up with about 4 baking sheets of crackers. They were simple to prepare and very tasty. Thanks for posting this recipe.

I had never made crackers b4, but really needed some to go along my chicken noodle soup. These were so easy and fast to make, such a breeze! I'm so glad I found this recipe. Perfect with soup or cheese or whatever. Just make sure to roll really thin if you want them to come out nice and crispy. Also, you may need to leave them in the oven a little longer depending on how thick/or thin they are. I love that they are whole wheat! Such a good base recipe for crackers. Thanks so much!

Very good cracker recipe - I used these for my daughter's bunny themed b-day party....used a bunny cookie cutter for the crackers.  I brushed them generously with olive oil and sprinkled with salt and garlic powder before I baked them.  They were a major hit!  I served them with a dip, but people were eating them plain!  :-)  make sure you bake until brown so that they are crispy!

Interesting idea--but you really need to roll them thin! Don't think I'll try this again. I don't like using a rolling pin. The crakers I rolled thin got crispy and were very good.

The first time I made this recipe, they were too thick and never got crispy no matter how long I baked them. Trying to cut squares was nearly impossible for me, so they turned out to be funky shapes. But I learned some things and immediately tried them again. I used a pasta roller to get the crackers REALLY thin. Then I used a skinny glass to cut circles out of the dough. I sprinkled them with garlic salt and baked them about 17 minutes. They came out amazing! I had seasoned the dough with Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic salt, and also used EVOO instead of vegetable oil.

Very good but I did modified it to cut back on calories (which is really nothing like the original). I guess at this point, I'm just using the cooking method. Here's what I used...4 TBS flaxseeds, 1/4 c toasted wheat bran, 1 c whole wheat flour, 2 TBS olive oil, 1 c water. I've made it both with salt and without and I prefer it without salt. I scooped half onto a silicon mat, covered it with wax paper and rolled it out as thin as I could. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the wax paper and flip the silicon mat over onto the parchment paper. Then you can peel away the silicon mat and the dough is left intact. Then I scored it with a pizza cutter.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I baked them WAAAY longer than called for and they were still underdone in the end. I also forgot to prick them with the fork, but that was fine). The flavor is good as-is, but they'll be fun to tweak, too, as others have mentioned. Next time I will try going even thinner (one giant cookie sheet full was clearly not as thin as they should go) and baking at a higher temperature. Rolling onto parchment as others suggested sounds like a very good idea so you can transfer them to the sheets. I'm storing them in a Ziploc. The texture is really good for thick dips or spreads. I also think I'll need to take the outer crackers off the sheet first as they are done and let the inner ones bake longer.

I made mine tomato basil and they were great. My kids loved them. I would definitely follow the advice to roll them as thin as possible. The thicker ones are so hard it is hard to eat them. They will not be crispy right out of the oven, but have to cool first.

As written this recipe is a jumping off point since there is really no flavor.  I will play with it further because There is potential here.  Thanks, Deb!

A really good base for different flavors -- I did some sea salt, some rosemary, some sesame seed, and you could come up with a million other ideas.  I used a pizza wheel and did cut them completely before baking, as this gave nice uniform crisped edges to each cracker.

Definitely more than one cookie sheet worth.  Like others said, GREAT base to add your favorite seasoning - I even tried with buffalo seasoning. I thought they were really plain out of the oven, but topped with cheese...better than any store bought cracker.  I used coconut oil, 2.5 c whole wheat flour, .5 c wheat bran, .25 cup flax meal, like another reviewer.  I added chervil for color/savory, but it was weak. Sweet (honey or brown sugar) would go really well with these too.

These were so, so simple.  The dough was easy to roll (with the tip or rolling on parchment paper).  I also modified as other users and used 1/2 cup oat bran, 1/4 cup ground flax seed, 1 1/2 cup ww flour and 1 cup white flour.  I definitely agree the thinner the better.  But with it being SO easy, I'll make them again tomorrow!  Sweet!

I agree with other reviewers that this could be a good base recipe. I followed the recipe exactly (something I rarely do!) and just thought they were too bland. In the future I may try this again but add some garlic powder or other seasonings to give it some sort of flavor. I'd certainly rather make my own crackers than eat that store-bought garbage all full of additives and preservatives, but I just thought these were far too bland. Still, they turned out nice and crispy and it wasn't too hard. I may make this again, but I won't follow this exact recipe again.

3.5 stars.  I have been on a "home made" kick lately and also trying to eat healthier and cut out additives and chemicals when I can, so I tried these.  Changed the vegetable oil to canola.  They were good.  If you want to cut out all the  from crackers from the store...these work.  I guess I just expected too much from a little cracker.

These are delish with a capital D!  Following the advice of some other reviews, I increased the salt to 1t.  I also added 1t. of a spice mix called "Sandwich Sprinkle" that I buy from Penzey's Spices.  I have a feeling that any of your favorite spices or flavors would be really good.  I also put a little sprinkle of salt on top, mostly for appearance and texture.  I increased the temperature to 400 degrees and they were really good and crispy after 15 minutes.  These are SO EASY and fast!  Oh, and I used my pasta machine to roll them out which made it so simple.  They weren't perfectly uniform but I don't mind.  YUM!

I wasn't impressed with these. I rolled them thinner than called for and At 350 degress most of my crackers burned on the bottom/edges before the centers got crisp, not something I look for in a cracker. Turning the temp down to 325 helped them cook more evenly but most were still a bit chewy in the center. They weren't bad with dip, but on their own they were pretty bland, even after I added a full tsp of salt in the dough, plus extra for sprinkling, and used rosemary, black pepper, and some brown sugar in my dough as well. These were a big dissapointment all around for us.

I see now why so many people said this was a good base recipe.  This needs some additions to make it great.  I made the recipe as is and enjoyed them just fine but I certainly wasn't in love with them.  I am not sure if I will work on this recipe next time or just find a different recipe all together.  I rolled them into varying thicknesses and found the crackers rolled to nearly translucent were too thin for my tastes.  I liked them best at a medium depth.

First time making crackers here.  These were pretty easy.  I made mine with olive oil and put a chicken bullion cube in the 1 cup water and boiled it. I also left out the salt because I thought the bullion cube replaced the salt.  I also added Mrs. Dash.  These turned out pretty bland but had a great chicken flavor. The mrs. dash added alot of flavor but this just needed more salt to taste like the real Chicken Bisquits. Next time Ill add the salt.  I aslo had to roll these super thin to get them to crisp up. If you want them thick I suggest to cook them longer.  I also sprayed mine with butter flavor cooking oil and topped them with a sprinkle of salt.

Holy cow! my first recipe with allrecipes.  Really excellent.  I used winter wheat and added kosher salt for the top, lightly sprinkled.  Nicely crisp and good taste.  I couldn't stop eating them.  Awesome!

These are a good basic, but it is quite difficult to get them thin enough (I don't have a rolling pin so I usually press with my hands, but that wasn't good enough this time).

they were a lot of work...the dough was greasy... and they were kind of chewy unless you got them reeeeaaallly thin. if i had a pasta machine i would've used that to get the dough super thin. i'd make them again but make some adjustments next time.

You have to roll these out really really thin in order to work, like paper thin, kind of. But the dough was really hard to roll out. Taste is OK.

These were very easy to make. I halved the recipe and it fit on one large cookie sheet. I tried to roll out directly on sheet which rolls out easily but handles on roller got in the way. I'll invest in pastry roller w/o handles because I will definitly make this again. With the advice from other reviews I added spices. I sprinkled with sesame seeds but they fell off so next time I'll put in mixture. These were so good and crispy everyone ate them up I should have made the whole batch!

Although I think this is a good base recipe I found I had to add more oil and spead it much thinner then the 1/8" suggested in order to get a crisp cracker but the flavor was good.

AMAZING BASE RECIPE!  I did a few things differently :  1)  I used cold butter instead of oil.  I chopped in the butter into the flour, to make a coarse crumb mixture, as if making a pastry dough.  2) I rolled it out extremely thin.  The rye flour that I used was so amazing at making it NOT sticky at all, so it rolled out paper thin, almost like a tortilla.  The crackers came out amazingly crispy and buttery, without the greasy texture.  In fact it was a rather dry texture, but it tasted buttery and crispy.  I will definitely make this recipe again...and this time I will add fresh chopped rosemary, with a bit of garlic powder and heaps of black pepper for a kick and boost.

Great recipe! I made them fat-free by substituting apple sauce for oil. Turned out fine. I used two variations of it. 1. Added sugar and about 1 tsp cinnamon (did not add salt). 2. Included salt and added 4 tablespoons of zataar (middle eastern herb/spice close in taste to oregano).  This recipe made 4 baking sheets and not 1!... Frist time I baked it some dough stuck on the sheet so to avoid that, flour the side of the dough that you place down on the sheets.   Great recipe!

This was my first time making these, but I tweaked it a little.  First, I made half of the recipe.  I added 2 tbsp of whole flaxseeds, and 2 tbsp of flaxseed meal.  I increased the oil an extra tbsp to make up for the extra dry ingredients.   I used a cookie cutter to cut out shapes rather than cutting score lines.  I saved this recipe for sure, and I will be using this "base" for all kinds of crackers.  Next time, I will probably add rosemary and garlic.... that sounds yummy!!  5 Star recipe!

Super delicious! The best cracker recipe yet! I dissolved 1T honey in the water/oil mixture and it added a nice faint sweetness (could have used another tablespoon). Don't forget to poke with the fork because this is where the salt bakes in. We've added these crackers to the menu... delicious!

Thirty-two years ago I received my first cracker recipe. I found that placing a crock or bowl on the burner that vents from the oven on my stove, and placing the crackers in the bowl after cooking in the oven crisped them. My crackers were drying out as I continued to bake.

the recipe by itself would not work.  I added 1 cup vegetable broth, 1/4 cup sugar, poppy seed, sesame seeds, and some cracked wheat.  Would add 1 teaspoon of salt next time.  Also brushed the tops with oil and plenty of kosher salt.

Wow!  What a great recipie. Like the other reviewers say-it's a great base.  I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on one, garlic and italian seasoning another, ranch dressing seasoning packet on another.  I added 1/2 cup of wheat germ and 1/2 cup of ground flax seed for nutrition.  Roll them out thin, and they make 3 or 4 batches.  The kids loved them.

good & easy, but a little bland. next time i'll add seasonings or brush with olive oil. i think if you want it to tase like the commercial varietes you'll have to add sugar. also, i was pleasantly surprised when this recipe yeilded 3 cookie sheets of crackers.

I found these very easy to make.  My recipe made about twice as many(I think).  They were very good.  Also if you want try adding different spices, such as Italian seasoning or rosemary.

A great recipe, and as other reviewers have said, a good base. I made the crackers as suggested, then spread them with olive oil before baking and sprinkled on toppings like sea salt, cumin and cayenne pepper.  Mine needed a bit more baking to become crisp but I think I could have rolled them thinner.

I just made these crackers for the first time. This recipe makes a nice tender dough. It's easy to add herbs and spices for Italian (I added Basil, black pepper, garlic powder and Cayenne pepper - yum!), Mexican, Chinese, or other variations according to your mood, or a theme you may be working with. Just use your imagination, suit your tastebuds and have fun! THANKS Ray Anne!!  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)

I didn't have whole wheat flour so I substituted almond flour and it worked great! I also added dried basil, garlic powder, onion powder. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. So quick and easy--it was my first time making crackers.

You can't find an easier, healthier and tastier cracker recipe.

I only made one change: instead of 1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour I use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup rye flour. Delicious!

I followed the recipe as stated and I had to add a little bit more water than it called for.  Something I did must've been wrong, because I was hoping these would have a good flavor and be flaky, but they were bland and rock hard.  I could add spices and herbs, but I think I'll just look for another recipe. Sorry

Love these! I made them 100% whole wheat since that's the only kind of flour I keep around, and I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil. I also grated some onion into my dough and kneaded it in - had to get it out of the fridge. They're delicious! They were a little thick because I had to flatten them out by hand, but that's ok. These are great with my homemade garlic hummus. I wish I'd doubled the batch.

This was a fun Sunday morning project for me and my toddler.  I rolled mine super thin so they were more like crisps than Wheat Thins, but good nonetheless.  A word of advice for others: be very generous when sprinkling the salt!  I'll try this recipe again and again with different seasonings on top and maybe a touch more salt in the dough.

Very nice! I added a tablespoon or two of white cornsyrup, and they taste pretty close to wheat thins. The edges were browned and crisp when the center was still soft, though.

good recipe. needed to be seasoned with more salt and fav. herbs. i used chili powder, some italian seasoning and 1 1/2 tsp sugar for balance. bumped up the texture and health level by adding finely chopped spinached leaves, olive oil and replacing some of the all purpose for oatmeal. next time will try garlic powder, parm. cheese and spinach (might even grate some carrots in there). this needs to be really thin to crisp and avoid kneeding as much as possible so that the gluten isn't too developed. if still not crisp, break up and place only those that need 'crisping' in the toaster oven on low until desired. great base recipe!!

Really easy to roll out. Make sure to roll very thin or the crackers won't turn out crispy. I sprayed the tops with PAM before cooking, and also used a pizza cutter to easily roll/cut lines before baking. They were so easy to break apart afterward.

I made mine really thin, maybe a bit too much ... but they were REALLY good! I added a bit more salt, i used olive oil instead of veggie oil, i divided the recipe in two bowls and i made half with rosemary, and half with carraway seeds. Delicious! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

adding various things each time I make these for different results.  This is a nice base to the cracker, I usually exchange some of the flour for rolled oats and/or flax seed

I increased the oven temp to 375 degrees, which yields a crispier cracker. If crackers don't get crisp in 15-20, break apart and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes. Great base recipe.

These crackers are wonderful for their versatility and flavour.  The estimated prep time, however, is much too short as this yield makes more than one cookie sheet of thin crackers, equalling three times the rolling and seasoning etc.  These are a hit at parties and go great with spinach-cheese dip!

Excellent recipe!  I only made 1/2 a batch to try them, but it made lots of crackers.  It totally filled a 13 1/2 X 15 1/2 flat baking sheet.  I rolled them out right on the baking sheet.  Easy to mix, easy to roll and while I think they need a bit more salt, they were excellent!  The salt thing is my fault, I usually think store bought crackers have way too much salt on top, so I opted to leave it off.  Next time I will either add more salt to the dough or actually sprinkle some on top as the recipe indicates.  Will definitely make these again and the field is wide open for lots of different flavors, depending on what you want that day.

So Simple... Such Basic Ingredients.... Tasted a little bland but great with cheese spread... next time I will try different variations... and be sure to bake until very crispy (to do this I roll mine very thin making enough for 4 cookie sheets and bake for 20 minutes)... good tasting though... and for the most part they are healthier and a lot cheaper than the store bought ones.....
UPDATE: I subsituted italian salad dressing in for the oil to add more flavor and make these healthier still... turned out very good... I will continue to experiment...next time I will add a little brown sugar and different spices

I know, everyone says it's "a great base recipe", which is very true, but for those looking for a good as-is cracker recipe, this one gets 4 stars because while it's very easy, it's also pretty bland. You'll have to spice this one to your liking, IMHO.

Thanks for a great base cracker recipe! I made the recipe exactly as is. I rolled the dough to around 1/8" and they took longer than 20min. I got about 2 sheets out of it. Next time I definitely plan to roll them out thinner. Can't wait to try different flavor combinations!

I made some changes to this recipe, but it turned out great!  I was out of A.P. flour, so I used all Whole Wheat.  I also added a handful of chip crumbs and a cup of crushed rice cereal (for texture and just because) I also added sesame seeds, sesame oil (and subbed the veg oil for Olive) parsley,  and oregano.  I also drizzled a little bit of beer in after the water, to get the consistency right (I added extra dry ingredients too).  Also I HATE rolling out dough of any kind, so I just patted it into the cookie sheet.  I had more than I needed for one cookie sheet, so I left my crackers thick.  I sprinkled extra sesame oil and sesame seeds on top as well as come coarse salt.  They came out VERY tasty, but were too thick and dense.  I will keep this recipe as my stand by and I will follow the partial A.P. flour and THIN rolling rules, next time ^_^.

These were ok, but lacking in flavor. Spices would really improve them. If this is just a basic starter recipe, and you're meant to tweak it to your tastes, then it's a good start!

I think these are ok. Not much flavor to them but a floury taste. Even the salt doesn't do much. I think they would be better if I added some herbs or spices to it. I made them for my toddler because she loves crackers and I wanted something that was homemade and not full of preservatives, etc...she didn't notice a difference in taste and ate them anyway. The texture is pretty good and they're very easy to make. Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe excactly, and these were absolutely excellent!  To me, they tasted just almost like wheat thins, but without all the un-needed additives.  I will make this over and over again! Thank you!

Update: Made a second batch and added some brown sugar and cinnamon.  Fabulous!

These aren't bad, but as written, they aren't very tasty, either. I tried to jazz them up with a bit of sugar and chili pepper, and while that DID improve the flavor, it still wasn't spot on. I will probably try these again though, with more sugar and maybe Italian seasoning instead of chili pepper, or someone else's suggestion of dry Ranch mix maybe. Still, this IS a thrifty, simple, and probably better for you cracker than those you can get in the store. Thanks for the recipe!

As others said, this is a great base recipe, but the crackers are much better with added spices. I also add baking powder.

We had a hard time getting the texture correct.  I ran out of flour working at this.  I will try some different things but I was not impressed with how much difficulty we had trying to get it right and I bake,.... a lot......

It's a good simple recipe, but it tastes like it too.  I think I might try some suggestions of others.

Also, I need to buy a real rolling pin, I had to do this with a can of cooking spray...it worked, but I think I would have been less aggravated and my crackers may have been thinner if I had a proper rolling pin.

I used this recipe as a starting point for making gluten-free nut crackers.  They were very easy to make; I simply replaced the whole wheat flour with hazelnut flour, and the all-purpose flour with rice flour.  They weren't as good as Nut Thins, but they were certainly a lot cheaper, and my kids liked them.

These are VERY good! I made a 1/2 recipe because I wanted to try it out first. I did increase the salt, because I like salty crackers. Next time I'm going to make Rye crackers!!! I can't wait to try different combos of "stuff". Thank you!

I made this for sentimental reasons.  My Grandmother used to make the communion bread for church services a few times a year and when she died it was just never the same.  I have her recipe somewhere and I think its something like this.  But didn't feel like digging it out.  Thanks for the quick easy find and it brings back lots of memories of tiny juice cups and broken bread on silver plates passed from pew to pew.  I remember always trying to spy the BIG piece on the plate w/o looking too greedy. :)

loooove this recipe. Perfect base recipe allows for infinite experimentation!

I make it a rule to substitute veggie broth for the water, and I add in a little extra olive oil. It makes the crackers tasty and crisp.

This is an awesome recipe, but you really need to add some spices to the flour and definately the salt. One think I added to give it a little zing is mix some olive oil and tabasco and brush on before baking.  I made a lot more crackers than the 32 servings and used the exact recipe.  Another thing I added was sunflower seeds and flax and replaced the veggie oil with olive oil.

These turned out Great! My Husband loved them! As recommend by other reviewers I added a little sugar (1/4 cup) I used my pasta roller to roll the dough thin and evenly. The dough was a little sticky so I had to add a little extra flour as I rolled it out. Course salt sprinkled on top of these tasty crackers makes them all the more fantastic. I ended up with 3 pans of crackers. These are time consuming to make but after my husband's compliments they are worth the effort.

Absolutely wonderful! I used my own special blend of spices/EVOO and took the advice of others by spraying some oil on top of the cracker and the result was fantastic. I can't wait to make these again- so fun, easy, and tasty!

I tried it replacing the white flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  It was tasty and the dough rolled easily.  I tried it with kosher salt and it was a little too strong - I'll use regular salt next time.  Definitely roll it out very thin - it becomes a much crisper, tastier cracker.

These crackers are adequate but I would not serve them to company. They come out with a quite-dense texture, and are not high in flavor. I cannot see how these are worth the effort unless you're just bored, and even then you might not be very happy with the results. There are better cracker recipes.

Great taste, inexpensive, easy to make AND uses the "good oil" unlike the store bought crackers.  My 10 month old granddaughter likes them too.

I changed the recipe because I have an abundance of buckwheat flour.   I added 1/4 cup c,heese flour, 1/4 oat bran, 1/2 cup ground flax seed, fresh basil, and sibstituted chicken broth instead of water.  They tasted great.

I love how you have so much wiggle room, you can play around a bit with thick ones and thin ones and various shapes. I used a few animal cookie cutters on them to make animal crackers and honestly, I could eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Not sure what went wrong…  They were good right out of the oven, but later they were tough.  I either mixed/kneeded too long, didn't bake long enough, didn't roll thin enough, or something 
I might try them again, but not soon.

My first time making these and quite pleased. I used the exact recipe for the first time and they will be great with a dip. For ‘eat by themselves’ snacks I think I will try an herb or two.

I followed the recipe but found that the dough was much too dry without adding some additional water. I also found like many posters that you had to cook it for much longer than the recipe called for. I would also suggest splitting the dough in half and rolling out each half since a single roll was too large for my largest cookie sheet. I was not especially happy with the result and may try at a higher temperature next time to get a better crispy cracker.

This is a great recipe! However, it was kind of dry. When I went to try to roll them out, the dough wasn't wet enough. I added 1 teaspoon of water then tried to roll it out then added another, and so on and so forth. My sister didn't like them very much but my mom did. I wouldn't add any more spices or anything else (other than water like I said). Hopefully this review was helpful!

I'll make this again; nice little cracker.  Thin is key, the thicker they are the longer they take to cook and the harder they are.  Rolled thin, these are marvelous.

I even made a version for my dogs, using aromatic spices that aren't exactly appealing to my wife but the pups roll their eyes in joy.  I know exactly what is in them so no worries about where it's made or with what ingredients.

1 1/2 tsp salt, sub veg oil for olive oil, add pepper, 1 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp garlic powder, roll out extra thin. On cookie sheet cut rub the top with olive oil, with pizza cutter, sprinkle with salt, Parmesan, and rosemary.

I loved this recipe! I doubled the recipe, and I also added a small amount (about 1 T.) of Toasted Sesame Oil   to the canola oil. This was an easy recipe, and the crackers are delicious.  I may try some Oat Flour along  with the whole wheat flour next time. I used a high quality and very fresh whole wheat flour for this recipe.

I wanted to make a cracker using the acorn mash we had for a 5th grade project. I used the mash and no additional water. I used the AP flour as well. Used my kitchen Aid. Came out great ! I kneaded & rolled thin and with a ravioli zigzag cutter cut into diamonds on the diagonal. Poked with a fork then I spritzed Very lightly with a water sprayer and sprinkled very lightly with coarse Kosher salt. They were wonderful. Hope the kids try them.  Took 30 minutes (rotating) to bake to a crispy finish.

Followed the recipe first then tweaked it to my liking the second time around. I like the recipe but the crackers are a little dry but this recipe is versatile enough to create your own flavor and that's exactly what I did this time. I added chicken seasoning to the dry mix for flavor and sprayed some canola oil on them. Lastly, I used powder cheddar for that final flavor!

I am making these to go in Holiday gift baskets with a variety of homemade delights: 3 Cheeses and 3 crackers; 3 kinds of tamales; root beer float and mocha chocolate mint fudges; peanut butter cups, mounds bars, caramels, peppermint bark; 3 kinds of rice crispy treats; cake pops; 8 kinds of cookies (mostly meringue-type).
What is the best way to store these crackers and for how long do they keep their freshness?

Loved these, even if I did forget to salt lightly.  Great snack option just by themselves.  Some other reviews I read have very creative suggestions and I will try some but I think I will just keep the base just as it is.

These were a lot of work and the end result was disappointing.  The dough was very tough/dry and difficult to roll out.  I wouldn't attempt these unless you have a pasta machine like other reviewers mentioned using.  The dough needs to be like paper-thin in order to get the crackers crispy.  Also, I added 2 teaspoons of dried basil, garlic powder, extra salt, and used chicken broth instead of water and mine still only had a "hint" of flavor.  These are a nice idea, but I won't be making them again.

I really enjoyed these.  Halved recipe (using olive oil and perhaps a half tsp of Italian Seasoning).  The first batch I left as made (although I did mist the top with olive oil) - took about 20-22" to fully cook.  Second batch I misted, then sprinkled with kosher salt, garlic powder, and Pecorino Romano cheese.  Both were great (although I have to admit we preferred the one with the cheese on top).  Will def make again - my thanks so much for recipe!

These are so easy to make and are very good!  I used chicken bullion in the water and added in some shredded cheddar cheese and basil. I will make these again and again with many different variations.  Thank you for the recipe!

Added powdered garlic, parm cheese, and powdered onion!  Biggest tip taken from others- Roll out as thin as possible!

This is a nice and easy recipe for crackers.  I've made these crackers twice now and have found that it's best to roll these pretty thin and for me I had 3 large cookie sheets of crackers.  I also ended up having to bake these for about 30-35 minutes until they became nice and golden brown.  I like this recipe but they aren't super flavorful--however still very good and crispy.  I'm sure by adding herbs/spices as other reviewers have stated you could get a more flavorful cracker.

I followed this recipe to a tee, and it was a 50/50 with the family. My daughter loves them and ate pretty much all of them, but my husband took one bite and said the flavor was too weird for him. I thought it was good, perhaps they need a bit more flavor if I make them again, and I had a problem getting them to crisp up.

Pretty simple recipe. Made mine with straight white flour as I didn't have any wheat flour in house. Also, seemed to have to tweak my cooking time by a good 20 minutes to get them actually crispy, though some of that might be because of my oven. Never really got totally brown colored as I expected. Also, added a bit of dried Dill weed because I was serving this with an herbal tuna salad (also from here on allrecipes.com!!)

these are great as is, although I thought to sub sea salt for table salt as topping.  You do need to roll it pretty thin for it to come out crispy though.  I will definitely keep making these!

Good, I made it as written, baking just a little more, and they were still just moist, not really like crackers.  I need to make a few more batches to tweak them down to how I like them.

I found the temperature and the cooking time to be way off.  At 350 a pan took over 30 minutes.  I raised the cooking temperature to 400 and that shortened the cooking time to just 20-25 minutes.

At first I found the crackers bland.  I increased the amount of salt and that helped but still these were some boring crackers.  I light sprinkling with garlic powder did the trick.  Now they are quite good, quite good indeed.

This was my first attempt at making crackers and I'll never buy them at the store again! This is a great base recipe, and I'll be experimenting with spices next time, but they were great as is. I used all whole wheat flour and olive oil, and rolled them out super thin. Fantastic!

This recipe was pretty good.  This was my first attempt at making crackers and this recipe was simple, easy and quick.  I followed suggestions made by other:  I used 1/2 cup oat flour and 1/4 ground flaxseed in place of 3/4 wheat flour.  I brushed olive oil on the crackers before baking.  Next time, I will try it with chicken broth in place of water as someone else suggested.  My kids loved these, we ate them for lunch with chicken salad.

These turned out okay, but not really as good as I had hoped. Not sure what i was expecting, but it was different than what I ended up with. Still, they provided a healthy base for cheese and other dips.

Great basic recipe, but be sure to personalize it as it is bland without added seasonings.  Mine was really, really good with Brie--something about the bland wheatiness blended in a sophisticated manner with the Brie.  Also, I took the suggestion of rolling it thin with the Atlas pasta machine--don't think I would have had the patience to roll it thin enough with a rolling pin.    I evened the edges with a knife and then baked them in about 12-inch strips, breaking them into individual crackers (or letting my guests do that), as I love rustic presentations (and it makes it obvious they are not ordinary store-bought crackers).

Loved it! I cut the dough in half and kneaded into one of the halves: 2 tbsp. of flax, ground, and probably a teaspoon of Italian herbs. I couldn't taste the herbs, so obviously I need to add more next time. I love flax so I loved them. But the plain half was delicious too! Not much of a pain to make (no more trouble than bread and I do that at least once a week), and I didn't even have parchment paper to help with rolling them out. I just floured the counter well.

Great crackers.  These can be rolled out, cut, frozen, then baked.  I flavored them with herbs, and the taste is wonderful.  I made them unique in that I didn't remember to prick with a fork before baking, so I have hollow puffs!  Great recipe!

Hmm...I'm at a loss to review this...this was my first time trying to make crackers. I did modify the recipe.  I used 1 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup rye flour, and 1 cup all purpose. I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp italian seasoning, under 1/4 cup each grated parmesan and shredded cheddar, 1 1/2 tbsp sugar. Kept the rest of the recipe the same. The taste was fantastic! However, I had a hard time getting the texture right. It makes several batches so I got to experiment with different thicknesses and salt applications. The first batch wasn't rolled thin enough and didn't cook through properly (chewy), the second batch was rolled thinly and then cut in individual circle sized crackers that ended up crisper, more done, and better. I recommend that. I think I may have overworked the dough which made it less fluffy. Rolling it out on the board was fine for me, in fact easier than parchment/wax paper. The dough's pretty pliable and easy to work with. Next time I'm going to stick with the original wheat/flour ratio and see how that goes, and also add some more water. I noticed the crackers I sprayed with water before salting crisped better, and that letting the crackers crisp above the vent made them a good texture. Not impossible, but difficult to get consistent results.

Thanks so much to the person who submitted this recipe; as other reviewers have said, it's a great basic technique that's perfect for tweaking according to the tastes of your family.  I'm always looking for ways to cut down on the processed foods I buy.  Using this recipe I can know exactly what I'm putting in my body.

I found that I had to add a bit more water than the recipe called for, and I did include some additional salt and spices.  Next time I make them (and there WILL be a next time!), I'll try the all-whole-wheat route.  

Thanks again!

I made these the other day, and they tasted very good.  The only problem was that I didn't roll them out thin enough and they became quite chewy.  (My nephew really liked them nonetheless, because they reminded him of biscuits.)  I plan on making more today or tomorrow, and this time I might experiment with some spices.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This is my first attempt at crackers and they turned out great! Crispy and with excellent flavor, though I made the following changes: 2T flax seed, 1/4c rye flakes, and olive oil instead of vegetable.

THEY WERE OK! BUT HAD NO TASTE AND I TRIED EVERYTHING. WELL ALMOST EVERYTHING I DIDN'T TRY BUTTER , ALSO I WILL CUT DOWN ON THE WHEAT FLOUR MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP SOME. BUT I DID THINK IT WAS KIND OF KOOL TO KNOW HOW EASY IT IS TO MAKE CRACKERS. THANKS SO MUCH TERRY

This is a great, simple recipe. Like others said, the possibilities are endless. These yummy little crackers taste great with onion or garlic powder. I tried peanut butter, Nutella, and tahini too, but the flavors didn't really come out. The crackers taste best the day after. In fact, they taste just like the ones I got from the store when I was little.

These turned out pretty good. I did add spices to mine.
