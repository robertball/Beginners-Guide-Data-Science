1.8.17  I should have followed my gut on this, but I hate to change a recipe, particularly when I’m the first to review it.   I see absolutely no reason to parboil the potatoes in this recipe.  If you just slightly overcook the potato slices, you end up with a dish of broken and mashed-up potatoes...yeah, that’s what happened to me.  I felt certain I’d like the taste, and I certainly did, but the potato consistency was not “scalloped potatoes.”   Have made a good number of scalloped and au gratin potato recipes over the years, and I’ve never pre-cooked the potatoes, particularly sliced potatoes, and I never will again.  You won’t be disappointed in the cheese sauce or the taste of this recipe, but I’d recommend you NOT parboil the potatoes, and adjust your cooking time, if necessary (and save yourself a dirty pan to wash).

This will be my go to recipe for scalloped potatoes. I followed the recipe except I didn't have the mustard so I omitted that. I also didn't parboil the potatoes like another reviewer suggested. Instead I sliced my potatoes quite thin and baked them longer.  Love the flavor of the cheese sauce. It's just like how my mom made them!

I did read the reviews on this recipe.  The only two things I did differently from the recipe were not parboiling the potatoes and no mustard (my husband is not a fan of mustard).  I used Yukon Gold potatoes sliced about 1/4 inch and baked for 2 1/2 hours.  Sometimes a good recipe just needs to bake to be done to perfection.

Loved it! I followed advise from other reviewers and did not boil potatos before hand. I sliced the potatoes very thin,  added a pinch of cayenne pepper to sauce,  increased temp to 375 and cooked for 65 minutes. It was delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

I found the sauce way to heavy for this casserole.   Next time I make it I will lessen the flour.

Don't question it, just do it!  These scalloped potatoes were AMAZING.  I didn't add or delete anything.  I followed the recipe to a "t" and it came out delicious.  So delicious, in fact, that everyone wanted leftovers for the next day lunch.  One of the best dishes I've followed/made from Allrecipes....awesome!

I always looked for a recipe that came close to Mom's.  Since she's no longer with me to give me the ingredients, I've not found a recipe quite as close in years.  This is an easy recipe real close to what I grew up on.  If you like scalloped potatoes, this one's for you.

My family loved this. Easy recipe. Simple ingredients. Great flavor. Changed nothing in the recipe. Am going to substitute crispy bacon for ham next time and add some fresh parsley.

This was easy and delicious. I have picky eaters and they even loved it. The only change I made is I didn't have Dijon mustard so not added.

This is a hit in our house. I don't add the mustard, but I do add everything else and it's YUMMY! Never goes to waste. I look forward to having left over ham after Easter just so I can make this dish!

I halved the recipe, didn’t parboil the potatoes and added a dash or two of worcestershire sauce, my wife and I enjoyed it and I’ll make it again, great comfort food on a rainy day.

I love the simplicity and no floury taste. I add extra cheese and crispy fried jalapeños on top. But the measurements are perfect on this recipe. Also use any “porky” meat ya like.

This is an  excellent  recipe for basic scalloped potatoes.  I made it without the ham and reduced everything by 1/4, however, next time I will only half the sauce and use 2 potatoes as the sauce was not enough to cover the potatoes when split that way.  I will definitely make this again!

This great. I cubed the potatoes with skins on and par-boiled. Cut the recipe in half and topped with more cheese, paprika and parsley.

Eating this now and wow! Great recipe. I didn’t precook the potatoes and put the whole thing in the oven for an hour 15 minutes. Absolutely wonderful. That is the only thing I changed. What else would I change! Maybe a panko crust on top for some crunch.

This will be a regular at my house whenever I have left over ham.  I followed the directions and the only thing I changed was I didn't precook the potatoes.  I cooked them for the regular time of 60 minutes, but at the end of 60 minutes I turned the oven up to 375 degrees sprinkled some panic bread crumbs on top.  Was very good.  I think the only thing I would change next time is to use sharp cheddar cheese.

As a family, we all loved this. My cheese mixture ended up a little too thick so I had to add more milk. No need to boil the potatoes first. I tried making it a second time with bacon instead and it did not turn out as well. Will make definitely make it again.

Recently made this dish, I didn’t quite follow the recipe as I cook by feel and taste.  Also added a Panko bread crumb crust on top.

I couldn't find the recipe I used all the time years ago. This one seemed the most like it. One review said they would use more  cheese next time. I always find that true of recipes so I upped it to 3 cups cheese. I just had almond milk and heavy cream. Did 2 cups milk and 1 cup cream. Would use just 1/4 cup butter next time. It turned out most deliciously and as I had hoped. I saved it and will be making it again.

This is extremely like the recipe my mother made and the one I make only instead of melting the cheese in the white sauce she layered schredded  cheese and it melted throughout the casserole.  This  is an excellent and easier way to get the same outcome....... A DELICIOUS SIDE !!
(Crumbled saltine crackers sprinkled on top also add a little crunch for texture.)
Thank You for sharing this wonderful recipe. It is a "Go To" for sure.

This was delicious!!! I did not parboil the potatoes before baking, however if you are pressed for time, I would parboil them. I just would not cook them all the way. I did not have onions on hand, so I sautéed leeks in the butter. I did add a crust of cheese with panko bread crumbs on top. This is going into our dinner rotation!

Recipe was great. I did do as others suggested and didn't pre-cook the potatoes. Just adjust the time to bake. It did take about 2 hours and my potatoes were very thinly sliced. the sauce/ potatoes ratio was right on. The cayenne pepper added was very good.

The Dijon mustard is what makes this recipe different and oh so good! I’ve made scalloped potatoes and ham for years and this is exceptional. No need to parboil the potatoes so long as you slice them thin enough.

Very good and as per some of the other reviews, didn't par boil the potatoes. Took about 1.5 hours in the oven to cook the potatoes, but worth the wait. Perfect for a cool Fall evening dinner.

I left 1/2 of each organic potato with the skins on and increased baking time for another 10-15 minutes. I also added 2 provolone  slices on top and it was so good!

We enjoyed the recipe. I decided to follow others and not precook the potatoes. I wish I had followed the directions. I baked mine for almost 2 hours and it was just under cooked. We ate it and loved the taste but all wanted the potatoes cooked a bit longer. Will make again but will follow the directions next time. Very tasty, loved the flavor. Much better than boxed!
