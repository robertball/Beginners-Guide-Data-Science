Awesome flavor! Very easy to make. I will make this again.  I also think that if you don't follow the recipe you shouldn't review it.

Yummm!  Easy one pot pasta dish.  We like a lot of sauce so rather than messing with the amount of cheese for the first time making the recipe, I simply skimped a bit on the amount of pasta (probably 12 oz).  It was perfect.

After the cheese melted and was evenly distributed, I had my doubts about what would happen when I added the very liquid blue-cheese dressing & milk, but I added it gradually as instructed and it coated the pasta and made a very nice creamy sauce.

Rigatoni is the perfect pasta shape for this dish.

This was great, I only did one thing different. I added 1/2 bottle of red wine into the cook, made the time go faster while this delicious dish was being prepared. Wonderful, thanks for sharing.

This was super yummy with some tweaks. Used Jalapeno Gouda and parm (no cheddar or blue cheese). Mixed a little milk in the pasta when melting the cheese. Used heavy cream and 3 egg yolks (a little more like a carbonara). Also sauted an onion and garlic and added that later. I had some left over ham so I threw that in with some canned peas. Hubby raved about it and I thought that it was pretty good too! Only 4 stars because I didn't "really" use this recipe but what I created from it was awesome! Thanks!

This was really good, but the cheese didn't melt very well. Next time I think I'll try parsley instead of paprika for better color.

This is such an awesome pasta dish! It was the first pasta recipe I ever made, and it turned out great! I made it for a party we had awhile back (I simply doubled the recipe) and everyone loved it! -Jake

I made this the other night for my husband and one of our friends. We couldn't get enough of it! My husband kept turning to me and telling me how amazing it was, and our friend went back for, not seconds, but thirds! This is definitely a keeper!

I highly recommend eating this the same day only as when it reheats the pasta gets a little 'crunchy' and the cheese sauce 'gloopy' & greasy though it still tastes good. I took some liberties with recipe, using ingredients I had on hand- Fusili pasta, garlic butter, all cheddar, Caesar dressing, milk, a little Baconnaise and topped with paprika. Cut this down to 2 servings for my son's dinner while he was with a sitter. I tasted it and thought it was good.

I fried up some chopped bacon, drained... Melted butter and fried garlic just a touch.  Didn't have bleu cheese dressing, so sprinkled some dried Italian dressing and doubled the milk, white pepper and no added salt because of bacon.

This was so good and creamy. I had some leftover gouda from a party and needed to use it up, the other ingredients seem to always be on hand! The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was I made it about 2 hrs. in advance and the pasta soaked up the sauce and it ended up looking like buttered pasta when I reheated it. The taste was still amazingly good. Just need to remember to make it and serve it immediately in the future.

Cooke, I think the frustration comes when someone knocks stars off of a rating but doesn't follow the recipe; therefore, they are really not being fair.  If someone changes ingredients, it's just not the same recipe.  I, too, like to hear suggestions; I just read one comment on another recipe that noticed 1/4 cup of oil was called for to cook sausage in, and it wasn't to be drained.  She was able to use less.  That kind of change makes sense. Changing out two of the cheeses for two others and then rating it as 4 out of 5 stars does not seem fair.  My question is about the picture.  It looks as though there are tomatoes in it, yet reading over the recipe, I couldn't find anything that was red except for the paprika...and there wasn't that much of that.  I have not yet made this recipe, but will add it to my recipe box because of the wonderful reviews.
