As I don't like canned shrimp, I made this with frozen salad shrimp; I also thought the tiny canned type would be lost in the salad. Although Husband really enjoyed it, he said he thought the shrimp could have been larger - he didn't really notice them. Other than that, this isn't bad at all. It looks pretty too. Thanks!

I've made this several times and it is a favorite of my family and coworkers. I use more crab meat and shrimp and either a green or red pepper. It is very savory and excellent after the flavors incorporate overnight.

We had a package of this pasta and a can of crab meat and needed a good recipe for pasta salad.
I made this for my wife, substituting some red onion for the green peppers, and she absolutely loves it.  It's a keeper!  Thanks.

I thought this was only okay.  I would definately use real shrimp next time.  The tiny shrimp just seemed to get lost in the shuffle.  I realize that the dressing was vinegar based, but it was a little too much for my taste.

Excellent salad!  The only change I made was using salad shrimp instead of canned.  Make ahead of time and let the flavors mingle in the frige. I'll make this one again and again.

This was pretty bland and had the strong taste of apple cider vinegar first.  My teenage daughter did not like the apple cider vinegar taste.  If it had more different seasonings in it,  we would have liked it more.

The mayo/oil/vinegar mixture needs to be doubled, in order to coat all of these great ingredients well!  Otherwise a very good recipe!

Very good, I like this better than using Italian dressing. You can really play around with this, I added chopped celery and feta cheese. Will definitely make this again.

Tripled the recipe, and used fresh cooked shrimp instead of canned, added some italian seasoning mix to the dressing.  Needed way more dressing - followed the directions, adding the dressing to the pasta, and it literally disappeared.  Ended up adding 1/2 a bottle of Italian dressing and even that was probably too little.   Also, I think there was too much pasta for the amount of veggies and seafood.  Recommend reducing the pasta from 16 to 12 oz for the recepie.

I kept it to just the crabmeat, and I used jarred red peppers.  It's a very lightly flavored dish.  If it's too dry, make sure the vinegar flavor doesn't disappear.
