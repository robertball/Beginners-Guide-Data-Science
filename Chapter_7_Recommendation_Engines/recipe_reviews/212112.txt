I have made this soup at least 20 times in the past couple of years, and have tweaked it a bit....I like to dice an onion and saute in a TBSP of light butter until soft. I use almond milk in place of a the cream, and chipotle seasoning powder in place of the adobo. I also like mine very spicy, so I add lots of cayenne and fresh ground black pepper. The perfect topping for this is a TBSP sour cream (I use fat-free) or a dollop of goat cheese. I eat this several times a week in the winter; with the above modifications, it's actually a very low-calorie soup.

This is a delicious smoky and unexpected twist on basic pumpkin soup. You can find the chipotle peppers and the sofrito in the Hispanic section of your grocery store. Save the leftover chipotles in a ziploc bag in freezer & toss them in the next time you make salsa. Evaporated milk can be subbed for the cream if you want to lighten it up (and next time may use chicken stock). Yummy recipe! Thank you Chris!

We really enjoyed this soup. If you want to add more smoky pepper flavor but don't want the heat of extra chipotles, smoked paprika is a nice choice rather than regular paprika. I made this as directed, subbing chicken broth, the smoked paprika, and slightly less half-and-half. We garnished it with cilantro and avocado, which was a great contrast to the heat and spice. Thanks for the recipe - I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow! :)

Well this is very good. I feel like it's the perfect base to be truly excellent it's just missing a little something. I ended up only using 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 because the roux and the pumpkin were already creamy and thick. And frankly the extra cream would've made it just a bit more bland. The spice is nice the flavors good just needs a little oomph. Maybe some good maple syrup to round out the flavors? I'm not sure. Also I'm not super familiar with canned chipotles in adobo but mine still had the seeds which I put in the soup which are a bit disconcerting when they end up in your mouth. Should I have seeded them? Would've been a mess. Great start though and still very good as is. Thanks!

Very tasty! I was sort of limited to what our commissary had in stock so I just used the hot peppers we had available (sorry don't know which kind) and adobo seasoning instead of sauce. I also like my food a little more on the spicy side like other reviewers so I put a liberal dose of cayenne in as well.;) I added a drizzle of the extra half-and-half on top for appearance. It turned out wonderfully and my husband was a huge fan. I will definitely make this again!

I used chicken stock instead of vegetable because that is what I had and I subbed no fat evaporated milk for the half and half. We really liked the complement of the smokey heat and the creamy texture. An added bonus was I learned how to make sofrito. Thank you we will have this again.

This is a good start to a great soup! Without the added additions I found it to be a bit bland. I sautéed an onion before adding the flour and after adding all ingredients I also added garlic salt and pepper extra chipotle pepper and extra adobo peppers cayenne some brown sugar cinnamon and a hint of nutmeg and I also added extra With these changes you will have the most delicious Chipotle Pumpkin Soup! (I like the heat so decrease the amount of chipotle adobo peppers and cayenne and it still tastes great!)

Tonight was a perfect night for a hot bowl of soup for dinner. This was SO good. Yes a bit spicy from the chipotles but nothing that would knock your socks off. I didn't know what sofrito was so I made it without. It was still good although I'm sure the sofrito would have added some nice taste. Thanks for sharing your recipe Chris!

Very good! I added garlic and minced sweet onion. Cayenne and annato seed powder for more heat and some Splenda brown sugar for a touch of sweetness. It was amazing! Two ladies at work tried it and they loved it and wanted the recipe!

I followed this recipe closely but made a few changes. I used chicken stock rather than vegetable as this is what I had on hand. I also used fat free evaporated milk rather than half and half just to save on some calories. Finally I made my own sofrito which was easy to do. Overall I would definitely recommend this recipe. It was delcious!

Accidentally grabbed "pumpkin pie mix" instead of pumpkin purée. Didn't realize it until the can was open and going in the pot. We rolled with it added some extra chipotle and sautéed onion and garlic. Turned out great! Next I'll try it the way it's written it's probably even better!

I have just made the soup base for dinner tonight and am very pleased so far... Super fast and a wonderfully rich and smoky flavor. I also subbed chicken stock and used frozen squash puree in place of the canned pumpkin. I have left out the cream for now but plan to strain the soup and stir in about half a cup of heavy cream just before serving. With cool and creamy avocado and cilantro on top -like another reviewer suggested- this will be a delight!

Made this soup for a Thanksgiving appetizer for family that could not make it to the meal itself... wow it had alot of heat to it... used to cans of adobo sauce thinking that is what it called for... do not advice that.. put brown sugar in it to tame it down and will dollop sour cream on top each bowl just before serving... very nice to have recipe for sofrito (homemade).... never heard of it before but will definately be using that for many other meals...

This was even better than I expected it to be. I followed this exactly except used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock. I got the recipe for sofrito here on AR. This soup was too spicy for my little ones so I had to make them something else but my 18 year-old daughter and I thought this was fantastic. I was skeptical about having this as the main course just by looking at it but with the shredded cheese mixed in it was unexpectedly quite filling. My daughter thinks we should add some shredded chicken avocado and crushed tortilla chips to the leftovers tomorrow. Sounds good to me. Excellent recipe.

This was super-fast and easy to make. I used milk instead of cream and added slightly less broth to the roux. It was not spicy enough for me though so I would make more tweaks next time. Thanks for a good base recipe.

Just got done making this for dinner! It has such a smokey flavor that blends well with its velvety texture. It's slightly spicy but no overly so. I de-seeded my chipotles which it doesn't say to do that in the instructions. I subbed evaportated milk for the half and half since I'm trying to watch calories. I also added about 2 tablespoons of light brown sugar to the final product. My husband will love this! Served with monterey jack cheese sour cream sliced avacado and a sprig of fresh cilantro.

Here are my changes based on the reviews: I put an onion two cloves of garlic and the peppers in my food processor and finely chopped them up. I sauteed the mixture in butter and then added the flour and broth. I cut the paprika to 1/4 tsp and used "smoked paprika" instead. I also cut the worchestire sauce to 1/4 teaspoon (we are not too fond of it). I added a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a small grating of nutmeg. It is delicious but next time I would use homemade sofrito; the Goya stuff was kinda funky. One of my kids thought it was too spicy.

Nice combination of flavors! I started my onion and butter with about 3 chopped bacon strips yum! I also used 1 TB of chipotle seasoning instead of the peppers and used about 1 cup of half and half. I made one batch today and I will be making it again tomorrow!

This is waaaaay too spicy. Two cans of chipotle adobo is asking for a hole in your stomach. I made this the way it was suggested and the whole meal was taken over by the Adobo. I tried to beef it up more with extra cream but the chipotle was too strong! Going to make this with one can of adobo next time and maybe two cans of pumpkin.... Too Spice! Too Spice!

This was so delicious!! I always try to keep things as healthy and low fat as possible so I followed another reviewers recommendation and used almond milk I did not use flour and I used a little olive oil instead of butter to saute the veggies. I had to make the soffitro as I couldn't find it anywhere. Delicious recipe thank you so much!!

This was absolutely delicious. I did "make it my own" based on some previous reviews- started with onion and garlic sautéed in the butter then added cumin and garam masala to the paprika. Only added about 3/4 cut half and half. I served it with pipitas avacado and cilantro. I will definitely make again and serve with warm cornbread!

Delicious! Hubby and I both loved it. So easy and quick. Made this just because it is Fall and wanted to do something with pumpkin. Not even familiar with chipotle peppers before. I used gloves to mess with the peppers in the adobo sauce. I did not see that in a review but maybe just missed it. Definitely did not feel like burning my fingers. Used only 1 pepper in the soup and froze the rest in plastic bags. Used chicken stock because it is what I had on hand. Did not add sofrito. My husband usually likes his soups served hot but I served this closer to a little hotter than warm. The spiciness already made it taste hot. Garnished with sour cream chopped avocadoes and chopped tomatoes. Yum. All sorts of extras would be great additions. Did not taste the seeds and suppose the garnishes kept them from being noticeable. Without any garnish the soup would have been too spicy hot for us and maybe boring after the first few bites.

I usually do not rate recipes but since I have time today I will! This was absolutely fabulous...but then again I love spicy! A few changes that I made: I did not have veggie stock so I used chicken stock I did not have half-and half so I used one 12 oz can of evaporated milk I could not find sofrito in the store so I used salsa instead. I definitely think that the fresh cilantro and sour cream on top is a must. I forgot to add the avocado but I bet that makes it even better. 3 bowls later for lunch I almost hit the wall and took a nap...but powered through the cleanup. This soup is very light and I used my own steamed pureed pumpkin that I had in the freezer from last year! This is a fall must:)

Yum-azing! My first go at any kind of pumpkin soup and it turned out delish! I like spice so I used 4 of the chipotle peppers with some of the sauce and a few dashes of chili powder..still not overpowering as I added a bit of brown sugar as well. I also used the evaporated milk instead of the half & half as others have suggested added nutmeg and made sautéed onions and garlic instead of the sofrito. Can't wait to top it off with some avocado cilantro and perhaps a dollop of sour cream tonight for dinner!

Awesome! We found sofrito in a jar at our local Target so I don't know how "authentic" it is but it was good enough to make this soup delicious. This is probably obvious but use less chipotle for less heat. My family loved this soup so much we made it twice in two weeks. Thanks for sharing!

I made this with recommendations from other posters in mind-- I subbed half chicken broth/half vegetable broth because that is what I had and added a small minced onion and 2 cloves minced garlic to the initial step. I also used half cream and half 2% milk. I agreed with reviewers that thought it a bit bland (spicy but still a flat flavor) and I added 1/4 tsp of ground cumin 2 tsp of garlic salt (instead of salt) and 1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses. The last addition was inspired by one reviewer who speculated maple syrup would help and another who added brown sugar to great success. I think the cumin is what assisted the middle flavors but the molasses unified all the elements together.

Based on all the positive reviews I was genuinely surprised to find that my entire family including myself disliked this recipe! I followed the instructions exactly using all the correct spices but this just tasted like too much pumpkin that never blended well with the spices! I couldn't even think of a way to doctor it up to make it something my family could at least eat. This was just not for us.

I love the idea, but have a few questions: What is a good quantity for fresh pureed pumpkin? A conversion chart suggested 3.6 cups is equal to 29 ounces. Also - the temperature changes weren't too clear for me; boiling when adding stock, but what about pumpkin, etc? Take down to low then bring back up to medium heat? Won't dairy curdle if cooked too long? I used half and half, and a 1.5 cups seems too much. Would simmering this soup enrich the flavors?  Because as of right now, it tastes like spicy pumpkin milk. I like the idea, but the recipe's execution seems to be lacking.

I've made this several times and this last tweak was the best yet. Forget all that butter and cream! Like others I used non-fat canned milk. I sauteed a small finely chopped onion to dark golden then used used 2-Tablespoons of olive oil to make my roux with the flour and broth (organic veggie broth). I also used 1.5-teaspoons of both ground chipolte powder and smoky paprika (to taste). I was in a hurry and did not make sofrito but added 1/4-cup chopped cilantro and 1-teaspoon finely minced garlic. If you want a completely creamy version blend it. We like the slight texture.

Perfecto! Never tried pumpkin soup. Not fond of pumpkin but only had in sweet desserts but looking for a starter for my Adovada pork and this was "amazing"; "pumpkin what a surprise"; etc by our guests. Made as is but had condiment trivet for all to customize per preferences based on others comments which made it fun: roasted garlic clives carmelized onions chopped avocado cilantro lime wedges & crushed corn chips. Great as is and maybe tad better if possible with additions.

I sauteed onions before adding the flour, and I let it all simmer for about a half hour, to get things all cohesive. I used fresh pumpkin and it was almost the entire pie pumpkin to equal a 29 ounce can. Is a tangy soup, I may eliminate some Worcestershire or sofritos next time.

Excellent recipe. I've also tried it with curry powder and smoked paprika instead of the suggested spices and liked every version.

This has a really great flavor. For those of you who are watching your fat and calories like I am I have a few suggestions. I made it with evaporated milk like a few reviewers suggested but I did not get that creamy texture that I think a soup like this should have. The next time I made it I used 3/4 cups of the evaporated milk and added about a heaping 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt and it was really good and kept that silky thick taste. I have not tried this yet but I think Lite Coconut Milk and yogurt would be good too but no quite as low on fat as evaporated milk.

I have made this soup and love it. I stuck with the ingredients listed. Please note it calls for 2 chipotle peppers not 2 cans as one reviewer said she used. I can't imagine how hot it must have been. I top each bowl of the soup off with plain non-fat Greek yogurt and I think the tang really adds to the flavor. I have used sour cream but I prefer the yogurt. I also use chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth.

I was really excited to try this soup but was soooo disappointed when I made it. The worcestershire sauce flavor was overwhelming. Recipe calls for 1 tbsp... maybe it's supposed to be 1 tsp?

I've made this twice now and it's delicious filling and easy. I've followed the recipe exactly as written with one exception: I substituted one 12oz can of evaporated milk for the half-and-half. I'm definitely keeping these ingredients on hand so I can make it any time the craving hits!

Firstly the recipe reads 2 chipotle peppers not two cans. It would also be nice for the poster to include a link to sofrito as many people do not know what it is. This makes a big difference in flavor. Bland vs. flavorful. https://www.marthastewart.com/891237/sofrito

I made the recipe as is except I added a tablespoon of tomato bullion and didn't add sofrito. It's great.

I did make a few changes that only made it better. I only used one chipotle pepper because more makes it too spicy for me to enjoy. I used fat free half and half. I often use that in cooking to help with calorie count. I also used smoked paprika. I loved the warmth of flavor that adds. This soup turned out great and is now one of my favorites.

It was good but I kind of got it too hot. Nice simple pumpkin soup recipe just watch the heat!
