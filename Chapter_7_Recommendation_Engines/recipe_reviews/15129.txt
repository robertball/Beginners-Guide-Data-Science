I had to use more peanut butter than on the recipe, because the bars were Way too crumbly. Even after I added more (and a little butter), they would stay together for a little while, but crumble anyways. The chocolate doesn't stick to the bars, and it's best to melt the chocolate chips on the stove, cause I burnt mine in the microwave! =)  This recipe does taste really good though, and exactly like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups! Great to make if you don't mind it being VERY crumbly and powdery. I would dip apple slices in the powder stuff, and it tasted great!

I tried this as an after school snack for my son.  The problem I found was that the crust was too dry and fell apart.  Next time I try this, I am going to add some butter to the crust, like  making a graham cracker crust for a pie.  Other than the crust, this recipe was really good and was a hit with my son!
