This is a good basic recipe with lots of room to make it your own. I use red, green, and yellow peppers and I mix mozzarella throughout the dish, rather than just on the top. A great recipe to build from!

I made this recipe with angel hair pasta .I also used regular hunts Tomato sauce . Vegetables to my own taste similar to what the recipe called for . At the end I added a thin thin layer of Jason seasoned bread crumbs and cheese over it .it gave the top layer a little crunch. Was so delicious and very gourmet tasting. Definitely making it again!

Contadina Garden Vegetable Pasta Bake Haiku: "Wouldn't mind more vegg. So I added zucchini! No mushrooms for me!" Didn't have mushrooms, so I replaced w/ zucchini; hey, they're growing in my garden, so they're relevant to the recipe's title! I halved the recipe for 2 adults and 1 child (very little leftovers) and used a 15 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, rather than pureed. Made it a day ahead, so I let it sit on the counter at room temp a little over an hr. b4 topping w/ cheese and putting it in the oven for closer to 25-30 min., as I wanted to ensure even heating, but not mushy pasta. A very colorful nice dish!

I would not make this again. I suggest adding more cheese mixed with all of the other ingredients. It might be better with crushed or diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. I didn't like the flavor.

We enjoyed this!  I used hot italian sausage (because I already had it) and ground it up.  My husband didn't love the carrots, but overall said it was good.  I loved all the veggies in this!  I also used 2 tsp dried italian seasoning instead of fresh parsley (because I don't care for parsley.)
