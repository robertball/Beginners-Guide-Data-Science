Fantastic recipe.  I made several changes to make recipe healthier. I cut sugar to 1 cup and substituted 2/3 c. Agave Nectar. Cut oil in 1/2 and added 1/2 c. applesauce.  Substituted 4 egg whites for the eggs. Used 2 c. white flour and 1 c wheat.  I will make again and again.  It's an excellent use of all those green tomatoes I've got left in the garden.

Turned out good.  Much like zucchini bread but without the little chewy squash strands in it.  One problem I did have was I diced the tomatoes in a food processor and just measured it out as is.  I propose that if anyone else uses a food processor to strain the liquid out of your tomatoes before adding them to the bowl.  My loaves came out a bit too wet and one stuck to the pan and ripped in half.  Also, the edges come out so much better in a glass pan than a metal pan.  Very good!  Will make again!

Great way to use up my green tomatoes after the freeze outside.  I used a food processor to grate the tomatoes and then strained them before adding as recommended by another comment.  I also used vegetable oil instead of canola and  1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.

This is an easy to prepare and highly delicious bread. My son said to me, 'wow this is really good. You can't taste the tomato.'  He then took another large slice. This is a wonderful way to use your leftover green tomatoes at season's end.

I used 1/2 cup walnuts and 1 cup dark chocolate chips. I also used 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 2 teaspoons of almond extract. My 5 guests gobbled it up and were amazed that green tomatoes can taste so fabulous. I did another batch also where I substituted the oil for canni-butter and added an extra egg. Also, super fabulous yummy.

I have never left a review for a recipe before but I loved this too much to not. I made four batches of this with the green tomatoes I rescued from my garden before a frost and they were all amazing. We ate four, I gave away one and froze three.

What I did was dice the tomatoes first and let them sit in a bowl while I prepped the pans and did the flour mixture. Then I drained the excess liquid from the tomatoes and continued. The loaves came out perfect when I did that.

Also it worked just fine using tomatoes that were starting to turn a bit pink, so if they're not all solid green, don't worry.

My favorite changes were half white/half brown sugar, half white/half wheat flour and the almond extract suggested by other reviewers.  I will make this every year from now on.

I made four loaves of this bread to use up my greenies. I followed the recipe except used half brown sugar half white sugar. I also took the advice of another review and drained the juice of the tomatoes before adding it to my bread. I think I drained it too much though, because it was a little dry. I really liked it, and will make it again. Especially because our dogs liked it too. They stole 3 of the 4 loaves right off the cooling rack! : (

This was so good. I did one loaf, and a bunch of muffins,  I cooked the muffins for 26 minutes and topped them with blueberries before putting them in the oven. Perfect.

Friend gave me green tomatoes and told me to try this recipe. So surprised - everyone loves it. Freezes well. Have loaves in freezer now ready to go. Took review advice and chopped tomatoes by hand. Will make this bread again and again.

I used twice the amount of green cherry tomatoes and I roasted them in the oven with a little olive oil and honey first til a bit carmelized.  I made mini muffins and topped the batter with ground walnut, Brown sugar & cinnamon!

This is a dense sweet bread recipe that I'll definitely keep and make again. I was looking for ways to use up some of the green tomatoes left in my garden, and this is going to be a favorite. I made the recipe as written, with the note that I drained the tomatoes very well after chopping. It turned out great. Because of the high sugar content, I'm glad I used non-stick pans and greased and floured. Turn the loaves out of the pans before they cool too much.

This is an excellent and unexpected recipe.It is great as is, but I made a few changes to make it a bit healthier.

Changed sugar out for 1 1/2 cups agave nectar. Changed to white wheat flour (King Arthur brand). Lowered the oven temp to 325, and it turned out perfect.

Got raves from everyone even someone who does not eat tomatoes.

Excellent! Thank you very much for this recipe. It is very good, extremely simple to make and a wonderful use of the green tomatoes I have. I diced the green tomatoes by hand and had no problem with too much liquid. Also had no problem with it sticking to the pan...I used one of those silicone loaf pans, sprayed it with a little cooking oil spray and lightly dusted the pan with flour. I will definitely make this again - I may try substituting agave nectar for the white sugar the next time I try it to see if I can make it a little healthier.

Great recipe!!  I only made a few small changes... 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for half  of the oil, reduced sugar to 1 cup cane sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added 1 1/2 cups of choc chips because I didn't have any nuts.  I never would have thought to try green tomatoes like this, so happy I gave it a shot.  Thanks!!!

This is great... Much much better than zucchini bread or banana bread. I read all reviews... I food processed my tomatoes on pulse setting, and drained liquid. Used 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. I used a gluten free mixed flour blend I found at Costco. I also sprayed my stoneware loaf pans and lightly floured. After cooling 10 mins or so in pans, I gently inverted on to plate and then back on rack to cool. Ate some warm.... Reminded me of a great carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. I have no frosting on hand, but feel it would be great

Terrific recipe--thanks for sharing!  I tend to cut the sugar by a half cup or so, and I sometimes use a food processor to puree the tomatoes if I have a bunch of smaller ones that I don't want to chop.  I've also used nutmeg when I'm out of cinnamon, which is also delicious.

Great great idea, but it was kind of bland.  I put extra walnuts but that is the only change I made.  Maybe using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar instead of 2 cups white.  It lacked some depth.  Next time I will try the brown sugar and I bet that will make it perfect as it definitely had great texture and good flavor.

Tastes like other quick breads but so much more moist.  I drained the chopped tomatoes for a bit, and I'm glad I did.  I will be making this recipe every year to use up my green tomatoes.

I've used this recipe two years in a row and loved it!  I don't use quite as many nuts as it calls for, just as a personal preference. But other than that, as is it is fantastic!  Always a hit with everyone who tries it.

This recipe is very similar to other quick bread recipes that call for either zucchini, carrots, apples, etc.  If you put enough sugar in any recipe you will most likely end up with something tasty and this is no exception. It is delicious, and unless you tell someone they will probably never guess what the mystery ingredient is.  My loaves fell somewhat in the middle, but I live at a high altitude (5,000) so that happens frequently to my baked goods until I can adjust the leaving, etc.  I will make this again but it may be another year because I don't think I can buy green tomatoes at the market. If I have enough green tomatoes I  might try making muffins as that may solve the falling in the middle issue.

Quick. Easy. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  My husband said "I'm not eating green tomatoes" he was the first to eat some (I made them as mini loaves) and he loved them. They did stick to the pan a little, but I think I waited too long to take them out and I may have baked them a few minutes too long.  Will definitely use this recipe in the future.

Great recipe, Nuts. Perfect texture, mildly sweet. Taking the lead from Julie, I changed:
2 cups sugar --> 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup maple/honey mix. 1 cup canola oil -->  canola/olive oil mix. 2 eggs --> 4 egg whites. 3 cups AP flour --> 1:1 AP:WW--> next time 2:1 WW:AP. Gifted the second loaf to the friend who gifted me the heirloom seedlings. Will definitely remake next year to commemorate the last harvest.

Delicious!  Based on other reviews I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and I used 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also added 1 tsp of allspice.

It was much too sweet. I will try it again but with less sugar. It is a good way to use tomatoes and would have had a five star rating if it was less sweet.

Turned out great!  I couldn't bring myself to using 2C sugar and 1C oil though!  I made the following modifications:

used the grater attachment on my food processor for the tomatoes

1.5 c whole wheat + 1.5 c all purpose
1/2 c coconut oil and ~1 c apple sauce
1.5 c sugar (next time will try 1 C)
one loaf pan
Baked 325 for about 90 minutes....  (next time will split in to two loaf pans)

I did use 1/3 white whole wheat flour, coconut instead of canola oil, and added 1 cup raisins. Delish.

Turned out perfect, I followed the recipe, except I pureed the tomatoes and my eggs were small so I added an extra egg. I added chocolate chips to mine but I plan on making more to freeze so will add walnuts and maybe leave a couple plain. Great way to use up all of my green tomatoes, Delicious!!

This was easy and very tasty.  I didn't have enough walnuts, so I used currants, and I replaced the white sugar with 1/2 organic sugar and 1/2 honey.  I would make it again!

Great recipe, didn't change a thing. Just make sure that you stain some of the water out of the diced tomatoes, it helps to make a moist not soggy bread!

It's a good way to use up green tomatoes, but they also don't really add any flavor/texture to the bread.  It could have just as easily been zucchini, etc.  I would cut back on the oil if I made it again.  Even considering the recipe makes two loaves, the oily residue on my fingers when cutting and eating it is an indicator that there's too much.   It also falls apart very easily; I tried to toast it the next morning which is something I do commonly with quick breads like this and it completely fell apart in my toaster.  Overall, not something I'm going to make again without a lot of modifications.

Had several green tomatoes in the garden when the frost was coming early the next morning.  Fried green tomatoes that evening, now what to do with the rest.  Saw this recipe, I had misgivings, just didn't sound right.  So I made one batch.  Was shocked if someone didn't tell you there was green tomatoes in it you would never know.  Almost a dessert bread with 2 cups of sugar in it.  Am fixing to make more to freeze for later.

this is a great recipe, but I do agree with the other comments. it is very important to squeeze some of the extra fluid out of the green tomatoes after they are processed (I shredded mine with a grater). I also added a little powdered ginger for a little bite. thanks so much for the recipe!

Amazing!  The only changes I made were adding raisins and lowering the amount of crushed walnuts.  And 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup dark brown sugar.  Used EV olive oil as that is what I have.  Oh, and I just finely diced the tomatoes as I don't have a food processor.

I made it and it was great! Could not taste the green tomatoes. Maybe it’s meant to be that way. Will make it again.
Used 1.1/2 cup of veg, oil, 1/2 cup coconut oil, 1.1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Just the right amount of sugar.  Cooked for 55 minutes, and was just enough time.

I was a bit dubious when I first saw this recipe.  We had a bunch of green tomatoes to use and I was looking for something more than just to fry them.  The recipe was easy to make once the tomatoes were shredded which was the most difficult part. It's a very wet dough and I wasn't sure it would bake well. But it came out great.  Both my roommate and I love it. It is similar to zucchini bread but a bit sweeter and with a slight tang.  When we make this again I think I'll put a bit of brown sugar on the top when baking for a nice caramelized top. We have also decided it would be really good served with cream cheese butter. :)

I made it with gluten-free flour. My daughter thought it had too much cinnamon, but I thought it was perfect. Didn't rise very much. Perhaps I'll work on that in the future. I've never used GF flour before.

I found this recipe to be bland,  but very tasty. I think I am going to add 2 ounces of lemon juice next time, and 1/4 teaspoon more salt. That should "perk it up". Great way to use the fallen green tomatoes after a windstorm!
I ground my tomatoes in a food processor, and added 1/2 teaspoon of ginger which was great.

Turned out great with sunflower seeds instead of walnuts, though cooking time should've been 45 minutes for me at 350, as I checked at 50 and the toothpick came out clean, but bottom was slightly overdone.

Happy to have a way to use up my green tomatoes!  I cut the amount of sugar by a 1/4 cup and used some brown sugar in place of 1/2 cup of the white.  I used 1/3 cup applesauce in place of 1/3 of the canola oil (this probably also added a little sweetness lost by cutting the sugar.  I also replaced a cup of the white flour with whole wheat.  With these modifications, this is a nice bread that's not too sweet.

Pretty much fool-proof. I am gluten free so I made this with 2/3 gf flour and 1/3 almond flour and it still came out great. I chopped half the tomatoes by hand then got lazy and pulsed the rest in my blender then drained them. Very sweet so I will listen to others and cut about 1/3 of the sugar out next time.  Also, the recipe makes one loaf and 12 muffins.

I was surprised how well this turned out. Not overly sweet - I cut down on sugar as suggested. Also, I didn't have enough oil, so used part oil, part applesauce. It was not too moist, but not dry, either. I don't have a food processor, so just chopped the tomatoes into very fine mince.

Who would have ever thought green tomato bread could be so delicious.  Made it 2 different ways, 1 just as the recipe shows and 2, using 1 1/2 cups of green tomato with 1/2 cup mashed banana (only because I had a very ripe banana that needed to be used up).  Both were great but I think I prefer the 1/2 banana added to recipe.

Like some other reviewers I was skeptical of using green tomatoes. But,  I did have green tomatoes in the garden which I didn't want to use for the old "fried green tomatoes" thing. which I'm not that fond of anyhow. 
This is excellent! Tastes just like zucchini bread. Last time I made zucchini bread it came out a little dry (of course I could have had it in the oven too long) but this was very moist. So moist that one problem I did have is some of it stuck to the bottom of the pan when I was turning it out. But not a big deal.

I made it just as the recipe directed the bread was surprisingly tasty. I will be making it again but I think it would be more delicious with the inclusion of raisins or dried cranberries.

I don't know if my rating went thru, I hit the wrong button, and bam!  it was gone!!  I did not change the recipe, wanted to try this one first.  This bread is very yummy!  I think it is better than Zucchini bread!!

Well, surprisingly, there's no tomato taste at all, really! This is just like banana bread or zucchini bread, and I really did enjoy it. Mine, sadly, had a really strong taste of baking soda throughout both loaves. Very disappointing -- not sure if I did something wrong, or if the recipe just calls for too much?? Anyway, will definitely make again with more green tomatoes, but will cut baking soda at least in half.

Wow. Awesome. Everyone likes it better than zucchini bread. Have made it twice and only change was decreasing amount of walnuts to 3/4 cup.  Making more with all of the green tomatoes left in garden, and will freeze those loaves...if they last that long.

I followed the recipe, i put the green tomato into a food processor, and I also strained the tomato to remove some of the liquid as mentioned in other comments.
I also replaced the nuts with Chocolate Chips....and it was a HUGE hit!
Thank you so much for the recipe!

Family loved it and will make it many times. Made mini loaves and put in freezer to keep them from eating it all up. Wonderful way to use green tomatoes.

Surprisingly moist and tasty! I only had roughly 1 cup of green tomatoes so I halved the recipe. I used the recipe, but with changes, not because I didn't think it would be fantastic, but for health reasons, and wanted to share my good results encase anyone was in the same boat. I made it diabetic friendly, heart healthy, and egg-less, due to severe allergy. The sugar was replaced with half Truvia baking blend and half their brown sugar blend. I subbed applesauce for the oil.  I used white whole wheat flour. For the egg I went with a 'flax-egg' instead of an egg replacement product for the added healthy fat to keep the bread from being rubbery. I was so happy that the bread came out moist, great texture, and taste. House smelled wonderful too!

I used sunflower oil,instead of canola, used 1 cup white sugar & 1 cup coconut sugar, and added about 3/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut. I LOVE this recipe!

Tasted just like zucchini bread.  The only change I made was using 1/2 cup applesauce in place of 1/2 cup oil. I used a food processor to chop the tomatoes, and it worked fine.  Just make sure to drain them before adding them to the egg mixture.

Very delicious bread! The tomato pieces give it an unusual taste... almost like if pineapple pieces were used... I didn't tell anyone what I put and they really liked it.

Would have never thought of this for using up an abundance of tomatoes.  It is awesome!!  I am going to make some to keep in the freezer.

Love this recipe!! I was leery at first because green tomatoes did not sound appetizing but this recipe was wonderful. Thank you so much. I had followed the healthy recommendations from J. Nelson and it turned out perfect. This is a definite keeper! I only wish I had more green tomatoes!!

Joined a community garden here in Brooklyn this year and we had so many green tomatoes still on the vines last week. I needed an easy recipe to use them up and this is it....no one guess there were green tomatoes inside and everyone loved how moist this bread was.   I used raisins instead of the nuts and this was a great substitution.  THANKS AGAIN for coming to the rescue.

I have not tried this recipe but a loaf was given to me by a friend and I can't believe just how delicious this is.  I will definitely be making it, no alterations to the recipe, if I'm lucky enough to have greenies next year.  Not a very successful garden for me this year and no greenies, but hope springs eternal and there's always next year!

this recipe is wonderful!!  I did not add the nuts as we have children who don't like nuts.  I decreased the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1 egg instead as I needed the moisture as I had chopped the tomatoes.  My hubby wishes we had more green tomatoes!
