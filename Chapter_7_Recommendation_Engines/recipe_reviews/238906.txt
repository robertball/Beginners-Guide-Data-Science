Easy, fun, festive way to feed a crowd.  I bought a salami stick and cut in into chunks rather than using slices.

This is a cute idea for a snack or a different way of having an unusual salad. You really don't need that much olive oil though, in fact it's even good without any oil.

I was asked to make an antipasto to bring to a small Italian Dinner party.   After considering just doing a meat platter, I found this recipe.  How perfect it was!!!!  I found small marinated mozzarella & decided to use that.  I poured some of that marinade in a bowl, & marinated cut in half, varied flavor cocktail/grape tomatoes for about an hour (I did add a little balsamic vinegar to the marinade).  I used 4 inch decorative toothpicks & alternated folded Italian meats, cut in half small mozzarella, a piece of tomato, a black olive & then repeated (except for the black olive).  I tried to use 2 different types of meat & tomatoes on each skewer to make it more decorative.  Not only did it look great, everyone loved them!!!!  I will definitely be making this again & next time I will take a picture!!

Great appetizer! I used chunks of salami rather than slices. My tomatoes were really bland so I marinated them for an hour in the artichoke marinade and I feel that added some additional flavor.  Stored them in a plastic bag and ended up pouring a couple tablespoons of  olive oil mixed with about a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar and they were delicious.  I did triple the recipe and used essentially the amount of olive oil called for in the original. You definitely need the longer bamboo toothpicks to make this work.

I used less oil and folded the salami in half and then in half again to make it triangular on the stick. Made it look more decorative.
Yes, I'll make it again! Took it to a dinner party. Most guests seemed to enjoy it!

Very good as is! You can adjust the oil to your own liking or not have it at all. I added a little balsamic vinegar to my oil and drizzled that over. Very very good!

I used marinated fresh mozzarella, marinated mushrooms, cherry tomatoes. Then I drizzled some of the marinade from the mushrooms and some from the fresh mozzarella over it. Next time I'll add the salami. You can even add a basil leaf.

I made these for a garden party recently. I followed the directions except I added a drizzle of dipping oil over. They were very tasty. I would suggest an artichoke quarter instead of the tortolini. Or use both! Yum.

This was a big hit.  Easy to put together and can be made ahead.  It's a keeper.

Marinated the tortellini and sliced bell pepper pieces in Italian Dressing. Cut long skewers in half and they were perfect size. Fit 5-6 pieces of food on each stick. Salomi, green olive, grape tomato, cheese tortellini, colored bell pepper pieces, .... The jack cheese didn't thread successfully onto skewers so it scattered around edge of platter nicely. Softer cheese would be better. Didn't need extra dressing or oil or anything as I wanted it to be "clean" type of finger food. It was perfect and very popular! It all disappeared.

Everyone loved it. Grandkids really enjoyed making them (and eating them!). Have made it twice now for hors d'oeuvres, and it's a winner.

Taking this with for the Labor Day weekend party. Easy to prepare, looks great on a decorative plate and I know that it will be tasty, why? because I tried one already. Taking this for Mother's Day always a great addition to any party.
