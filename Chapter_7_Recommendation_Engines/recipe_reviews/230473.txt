OMG!  You HAVE to try this recipe!  I did three things differently from the instructions:  I used only half a chicken (used the other half for a different recipe) even though I followed the instructions for brining and cutting----I put foil in a 13x9 pan and used a small grate rather than a broiler pan---and I put a sheet of foil over the top (just laid it on) of the chicken after about 15 minutes so it didn't burn.  We don't eat the skin, so that is used only for moisture and flavor.  The timing on this was just about right on--within several minutes.  I don't even want to know how many calories the potatoes have in them because we plan on eating all of them tonight.  They are so yummy.  Thank you for this technique, Cara!

The flavor is very, very good. I am not crazy about Dijon mustard but I decided to follow the recipe exactly so that I could rate it fairly as written and WOW, this was good! I didn't check the weight of my chicken so that is my fault but it took quite a bit longer than the 40 minutes indicated in the recipe. I think the description is a bit misleading. Between brining and preparing the chicken, the butter mixture and the potatoes, I couldn't make this on a workday even if it did finish baking in 40 minutes. I put green beans in with the potatoes and roasted them and both were delicious! Thank you, carabakescupcakes. I will certainly make this again and again. By the time the chicken was finally finished my little girls and I couldn't wait while I took a picture but we all enjoyed it. I will have to add a picture next time I make it.

Delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. Once with a whole fryer, once with a cut up whole chicken, an once with just thighs. (Basically whatever is on sale that week). It has turned out amazing every time! This has become a regular in our rotation.

This is really good! We served it to company and they loved it! I love the method of "spatchcocking" a chicken to help it cook faster. So moist and flavorful.

Wow! This was a great dinner.
I had an 8lb chicken that had been in my fridge for a few days and needed used up. I made this spur of the moment, so I didn't have time to brine my bird. This was so good even without doing that, so I can't wait to do the brine next time I make this.
I cook whole chickens at least twice a month, but this was the first time I spatchcooked one like this. Since my bird was bigger than what was called for I doubled the ingredients.
I used my NuWave infrared oven instead of the conventional oven. I put the potatoes on the 1" rack and the chicken on the 2" rack. Everything came out so juicy and flavorful. We didn't have any leftovers! This is my daughter's new favorite meal. Thanks for the recipe, carabakescupcakes!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious and moist!! I did, however, have a problem with the temperature. My oven was on broil at 500 degrees, chicken on the lower 3rd and started burning within 10 mins. I ended up switching it to convection bake and that worked well!  I’m not sure how everyone’s bird didn’t burn at that temp.

The pan juices made very flavorful gravy.  The Yukon Gold Potatoes were soft and yummy after cooking in the juice.  I cooked the chicken 50 minutes and it was moist and nicely browned.  Will make it again and maybe add other veggies with the potatoes.

YUM!!!!!! Best roast chicken ever!  I followed the recipe but, my chicken did start to burn so I turned it down to 375 & kept rotating it and it still was done at about 50mins. I added carrots and celery to the potatoes and did not add olive oil because I knew all the chicken fat would coat the veggies well enough. I did have to blot them with a paper towel but the flavor was amazing.  this was fantastic!!! I will absolutely keep Dijon mustard in my fridge just to make this... wonderful!  al so, I purchased brining bags after the holidays for about $1 and keep them just for trying recipes like this. So juicy and flavorful!! winner winner chicken dinner!

AMAZING!!!! I've made this several times now exactly as written and have had everyone ask me for the recipe. Today, I switched it up and used sweet potatoes. It worked! Thanks for this super delicious recipe!

Good technique! I remember watching Julia Child and Jaques Peppen arguing good naturedly whether fast or slow roasting is best for chicken. Funny!
