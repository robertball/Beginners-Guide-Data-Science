I loved it!  The only change I made, I used fresh veggies instead of can.  It takes a little longer to cook but I thought it was worth it. Overall very simple dish to make!

My husband isn't too fond of rice in any form except for rice pudding.  I was lucky to get a bowl of this wonderful soup - before he finished all of it.  I'll be making it again - as we enjoy soup regardless of the weather.

I made a few adjustments to make it healthier and lower in calories for me. I used one whole onion,  threw in a bit of fresh minced garlic, fresh grated carrot instead of canned, poached/shredded chicken I had in my freezer and fat free half-n-half instead of whipping cream. I added fresh ground pepper as well. I also used organic ingredients where I could. After tasting the soup, I did add more cumin/chili powder/cilantro. This is tasty, though for me it needed more spice. Even lightened up, I don't miss any of the flavor by using lower fat ingredients. Next time, I'd leave out the celery as I felt it was out of place in this recipe, but that's a personal choice. NOTE: If you are having a hard time locating ground chipotle chili, I found it in my local grocery store in the "ethnic" food aisle with the mexican foods hanging from a j-hook in a cellophane packet.

This soup was very flavorful.  Mine was kind of thick so I needed to add extra chicken broth.  Also used fresh carrots instead of canned which I sauteed along with the onions and celery -- plus I added fresh garlic at this step.  My only problem with the recipe is that it only yielded about 2-3 main dish servings, not the 6 as stated.  I wish I had at least tripled it.  Will also switch to regular chicken breasts instead of canned.

This recipe needed more spices for me. Also, 10 minutes wasn't a long enough saute for me, and lastly, I don't think the recipe means you to cook 1 cup of wild rice and add it -- I think it means you to added 1 cup of already cooked wild rice. I did it the other way, so mine is more like a chicken & rice stew, which is totally fine, except that I wasn't expecting that! Thanks for the recipe, this was easy and (aside from the wild rice taking an hour to cook) quick to do. (Use any pre-cooked rice, even Rice-a-Roni, for a quicker and tastier addition.)

Good, but I think I would like a little more spice :)  I didn't have chipotle powder, so I used a little canned chipotle in adobo and a pinch of jalapeno powder. I also used fresh carrots in place of canned, fresh shredded chicken and used all chicken broth instead of cream of chicken soup. Because of these changes, I did need to add some salt. Lovely flavor and a nice way to change up a favorite!

Really good flavor!  I used fresh veggies (just add the carrots when cooking the onion and celery) and substituted skim milk for the cream and it was still thick and delicious. I also used the adobo sauce from a can of chipolte's instead of ground chipolte just because that that was what I had on hand.

Yum! This was quite good!!! Both my hubs and I rarely agree when it comes to food and we both thought this was a winner. :) I'll be the first to admit, I wasn't expecting much. Canned ingredients didn't appeal to me at all. Having said this, I did substitute a cup's worth of shredded rotisserie chicken for the canned variety (I HATE canned chicken - yuck!). In addition to this change, I have a couple of suggestions for improvement. First and foremost, this soup needs more liquid! As is, this was too thick for my liking. Start with 1 1/2 cups of broth, adding the entire can if you feel you need it (I did). Finally, why waste half a can of carrots? Go ahead and add all of them (this soup can handle it...). Panera bread bowls, a sprinkling of reserved cheese, chopped cilantro and seasoned tortilla strips made this a special meal. Margaritas were the perfect complement to our Southwestern-themed meal. Thanks for a great idea to add to my meal rotation, Mealtime.org! :-)

This was fantastic. I used fresh veggies and realized after I started it that I'd used up all of my chicken so threw in some bacon and Uncle Ben's chicken and wild rice mix.
