Love it!! I've made this recipe a few times now and have made a few alterations for my own tastes. I use 1/3 C of brown sugar, you don't need a full cup. I've also found no difference in flavours or quality by NOT chilling/freezing the dough and also not letting the sugar mix sit for hours. You can do it all right away. I also only use a cup each of the fruits, and find the extra 1/4 c of flour to be too much. Again, all for my tastes. I always tell people make the recipe as is a few times, get a feel for it, then and have fun experimenting with it afterwards. Change up the nuts, too. I usually use half walnuts and half honey-roasted pecans.

I did add an egg just before adding the dry and I used dried apricots instead of candied fruit this time.  I submitted the first photo so I know they look good.

Loved the taste of these fruitcake flavored cookies.  Fruity molasses type cookie.  Will make again.

It was an okay recipe. Everything turned out great except I think the amount of molasses is a bit high. Mine ended up darker then the ones in the picture. I followed this recipe exactly. Next time less molasses might make this recipe perfect for me.. Would make again.
