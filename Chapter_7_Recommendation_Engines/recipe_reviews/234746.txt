What an excellent tea, I even had some fresh jasmine flowers on my vine to add in.
Update: The first time I tried this tea I was feeling fine, now I am sick with a bad head cold and scratchy throat, this tea has been a lifesaver for me. I also squeezed in some fresh oranges for some more vitamin C.

It works! I made this using jasmine green tea as well as hibiscus herbal tea and the honey/lemon does seem to soothe a very sore throat. Thank you elenlinde for sharing the recipe.

Great with orange pekoe tea, too.  I added extra lemon and a little extra locally-produced honey.  Very comforting.

When I was just a child and would get a bad cold and sore throat, my mom would make this recipe and I had to drink it before bed.
The only thing she did differently was add a half shot of whiskey! 
The next morning I felt great, the cold had lessened in intensity and was on it's way out!
