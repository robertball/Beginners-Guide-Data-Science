A great, basic gnocchi recipe.  I like this served with a simple garlic butter sauce and some oregano, basil, and black pepper.  

I might have an idea about why reviewers have disagreed on how much flour this recipe needs:  It depends on how much water the potatoes absorb during cooking.  If you boil them whole, they'll absorb a fair bit of water; if you boil them in chunks, they'll absorb even more.  If you steam them, they'll absorb less, and if you microwave them, they'll absorb none at all.  My suggestion:  Start with one cup of flour and add more to the potato mixture as you knead it until the dough is dry to the touch (but not so dry that it crumbles).  My experience is that two pounds of potatoes will take about a cup and a half of flour.

Great recipe - a few gnocchi tips: Work with pounds of potatoes since the sizes can vary so much. I boil the potatoes whole in salted water and them peel after cooling slightly to limit water intake.  Press the potatoes thru a ricer for finer texture.  When working with the flour start with 1/2 cup per 2 lbs of potatoes, gradually adding more until you reach the "right" consistency too much flour will they are stiff and chewy, too little soft and mushy.  After cutting roll the individual pieces down a fork to create ridges and a dented center to pick  up sauce. They should curl slightly as they are pressed gently down the fork.  My Grandma added parmesan or romano to the mix for more flavor depending on the sauce used.  They take practice but are worth it!  Reivsed **NOTE..gnocchi is inherently 'bland'.  The idea is to serve with a fabulous sauce (tomato based or garlic tomato basil oil, endless possibilities).  I can't see stuffing a gnocchi..lol...wow no stuffing them.  Vary flavor with salt and/or cheese but dont go crazy cuz then its not gnocchi. Good tip: let the gnocchi sit in the sauce for a bit before serving to infuse the flavors. Tip 2 - the dough will absorb moisture while sitting so you need to work quickly and reesstablish consistency with each 'rope' before rolling and cutting by kneading in a bit more flour til it is resilient to a light touch.  LAST -  Ignore any ratings below 5 :)

I have a tip for anyone who thinks the recipe takes too long - after I knead the dough, I put it in an icing bag, squeeze it straight into the boiling water, cutting it into 1-inch pieces as I squeeze.  Great recipe!

Okay, I've never eaten a gnocchi before in my life, but from what I understand, the potatoes should be really finely mashed (by using a ricer or whatnot), and I have a suggestion to anyone wishing to get finely mashed spuds: Use a mixer! I'm using a stand mixer but I've used hand mixers in the past to make whipped potatoes (I never had mashed potatoes growing up, they were always whipped with a mixer). I cooked 6 medium-large unpeeled potatoes in the microwave in batches of 3 for 7 minutes per batch (turning halfway through), and then I let them cool slightly and peeled them (accomplished more easily with some napkins and towels, the skins just sloughed off). Put them in my mixer bowl, added 3 TBS butter, some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and nutmeg. Let them fully cool, then I added 2 eggs and mixed them in slightly with the beaters. By hand, I mixed and kneaded in the flour. I only used 3/4 cup, and it seemed good, so I cooked a dozen little gnocchi up. They were way too squishy, so I kneaded about another ½ cup or so of flour into the remaining dough. I snaked them out, cut them, and put them on a wax paper-lined baking sheet. I then put the sheet in the freezer. Once frozen, into a freezer bag! I cooked some frozen ones up to make sure they're great, and they were pretty good with a mushroom pasta sauce! Thanks for a fun recipe!

Excellent fresh recipe - it may be noted that it's best not to knead the ingredients like you would bread. If you pull the ingredients together quickly and then roll in a "snake" it will give you a lighter gnocchi . . . this recipe is great!

12 years ago, I turned frozen gnocchi into a pot of gooey mush.  So I was a little skeered to try this recipe.  Turns out that was unnecessary - this was crazy easy!  Based on the reviews, I steamed 3 medium potatos in the microwave, so they absorbed no water.  Once cooled I peeled and mashed them finely with a fork, then added the egg and just 1/2 cup of flour.  Then I added 1/2 more.  Then I dumped it on a floured counter and probably worked in another 1/4 cup total, rolling them.  (I tried rolling them down the tines of a fork for the grooves... but that was not as successful.  I ruined the shape without getting many grooves.  A skill that requires practice, perhaps?)  They were done in under three minutes, were light and just barely chewy.  I made a pan sauce with 2 tbsp butter, 1 tbsp flour, 1/4 very thinly sliced onion, 1 mushroom buillion with 1 cup water, and some rubbed sage & salt to taste.  Honestly, I'm already craving them again.

The recipe says to boil the potatoes until they are tender but still firm and 
I think that may be a little misleading for us first-timers.  I thought my potatoes
were like that, but  they didn't blend very well into the flour mixture.  Because of 
this, I couldn't form the dough "snakes" very well.  But it still tasted good in the end.  
I think that I'll just boil the potatoes much longer next time.

Great Recipe!  Simple and complete!  The trick I found helped me was to work in enough flour so that the dough hardly "moves" when you stop kneading for a second.  Once that was accomplished I rolled it into 1/2 to 3/4 inch ropes, chopped in one inch chunks, rolled it down the tines of a floured fork and boiled them in salted water 'til they floated for a minute or two!  Great with Alfredo Sauce & grilled chicken or your favorite Spaghetti sauce!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was my first attempt at Gnocchi, so I read most of the other reviews before making these. 
 
1st, I would have to agree that you want to add the flour a little at a time because you probably won't need the whole amount. I think I only ended up using about a cup and a quarter? 

2nd using a pastry bag or plastic baggy with the corner snipped really works wonders for cutting these fast.  Just squeeze and cut them right into the boiling water.

3rd when cutting, stick to the thin, 1/2" size suggested; the gnocchi will increase in size once cooked.  I thought the 1/2" seemed way too small and thin, so I make a bigger cut, only to end up with meatball sized gnocchi.

4th DON'T overcook.  I learned to scoop them out as they floated to the top instead of waiting til ALL of them floated.  Some were overdone and watery.  Others were perfect.  Guessing the ones that floated to the top last were the perfect ones. They may float well before the time indicated in the recipe, so don't worry if they are, just scoop 'em out!

Also, not sure why others had issues with too much moisture, but I cooked my potatoes whole for 15 minutes and they turned out fine each time.  I used just enough water to cover them, so maybe that helped.  I want to experiment with adding flavor to the dough portion, but didn't want to mess with the recipe too much until I had a couple attempts.  So, round 3 I will probably try adding some basil and garlic powder or something to the dough to add a little punch to

I grew up going over to my grandmother's house every sunday for sunday dinner with all my relatives and she used to make this. We now make this every sunday for sunday dinner, only i learned to make these a little differently than this recipe says...we boil the potatoes with their skins on and peel them when they come out of the boiling water. we then use a knife and a cloth to keep your hand from burning to peel them, and then 'mash' them with a ricer. 

a tip=mash in your eggs first before you add any flour, then add flour by the spoonfulls, dont just add all 2 cups at once.

This recipe was great!  I have a few tips to share after making this recipe 3 times:  1) Use a food processor after you boil the potatoes to ensure there are no lumps left before you mix in the egg or flour 2) I usually mix in about a teaspoon of salt, and a minced teaspoon or so of whatever fresh Italian herbs I have on hand - rosemary, sage, or oregano work well - to the dough for more flavor 3) I've found that the gnocchi will often stick together, even after they're rolled in flour, and that makes them hard to separate once they're in the boiling pot of water.  To prevent this, lay out the gnocchi (shaped, rolled in flour and pressed with a fork)  onto a plate where they can stay separate, and stick them in the freezer for 10 minutes so they have a bit of firmness. 4) I boil fresh gnocchi in several consecutive small batches using the same water, removing the gnocchi with a slotted spoon when it's done so that it doesn't all mush together.  (This isn't necessary if you've frozen the gnocchi for an hour or more.)  Enjoy!

I thought these were great.  Who knew that gnocchi was so easy to make?  I am glad I gave it a try.  I doubled the recipe so we would hae leftovers and I am not sure how much flour I ended up using.  They were great.  Thank you!

Great recipe! My husband and I though these were really bland, but they were still really good with a tomato sauce over them. However, next time I make these, I will stuff them with sausage or cheese. Great refrigerated and boiled later.

To add some tips from master Italian chef's take on gnocchi: only use one (1) cup of flour and add flour as needed until the dough doesn't stick AND use a ricer or at least don't mash the potatoes too much or the consistency will be too heavy and chewy.    Great recipe!!  Thanks so much.

I feel absolutely brilliant!  Who knew making gnocchi could be so easy and quick?!!  I really appreciate all the reviews by those expert gnocchi makers; I found them most helpful in trying to figure out what the dough was supposed to be like.  I did use the 1 cup potato (red potatoes) but only used a little under 1 cup of flour.  I just worked in the flour 1/4 cup at a time until I got a consistency that could be rolled and hold its shape.  I added a little chopped roasted garlic to the gnocchi dough.  What I love about these is that no matter what the size of the cut, you know when they are done by them rising to the top.  Mine held together beautifully, not one fell apart in the water.  The dough was extremely easy to handle and the process was much quicker than I thought(under 1/2 hour from start to finish)  I put my water on to boil at the beginning and by the time they were cut, the water was ready.  I did the fork rolling thing but next time will just make a dimple with my thumb to help pick up some sauce.  I salted the water really well and found they were not bland at all, not gummy, and they weren't the classic 'sinkers' as my Italian friend used to refer to them as.  They were very light and tasted just like pasta.  Used homemade marinara sauce over top and made a wonderful meal.

This is one of my boyfriend's favorites.  

I make the gnocchi, boil them, and then sautee them with olive oil and pesto.  I serve it in a single communal dish with plenty of crusty bread for soaking up the extra herbed oil.

Yum!

Well, wasn't this simple!  I could not find gnocchi in ANY of our local grocers, I was delighted to find this simple recipe and an especially good way to use my Thanksgiving leftover mashed potatoes!  Use the simple rule I taught my boys when learning to cook.  Follow the recipe, and then use your instincts!  Make the dough like you would want to eat it.  Not too dry, not too moist......make the gnocchi pieces themselves small enough to cook quickly & thoroughly.   If they turn out poorly, try again!   Dough is one of those things that just takes practice.  Says the girl who cannot make a decent pie crust to save her life.......

These were amazing!!! I took the advise of others on this site and boiled the potatoes whole, let cool, and peeled. I used my food mill to rice the potatoes. To a pound of potatoes I needed 1 and 1/2 cups of flour. I got up and ate the leftovers in the middle of the night. Thanks for the simple recipe can't wait to mix and match sauces for these little bites of heaven.

What a great and simple recipe!!  It was my first time making gnocchi and it was definitely a success.  I used about 1 and 1/4 cups of flour and added it as I thought it was necessary (as one reviewer suggested doing).  Next time I might add some seasonings just to experiment.  Thanks for a wonderful and quick recipe.

Great basic recipe!  The texture was really good, and plenty hearty enough to stand up to a strong lamb bolognese.  I would just recommend two things: be flexible with the flour, and add as much as you need to in order to get the right rollable texture.  Also, be sure you roll the rope thinnish, and cut small chunks-- they really puff up when you boil them!

This recipe was delicious, easy to make, I did add Parmeasan cheese 1/2 C and Garlic powder to the recipe, and everything came out great.  I also added it to Cream of Chicken soup I had made instead of noodles, Tasted like Olive Gardens Chicken & Gnocchi soup.....

This is similar to my families recipe - my Nona came from Italy and her recipe was slightly different.  Egg to flour is one to one and one medium potato boiled and mashed.  Also, no one has mentioned this, but whatever you do, DON"T let them dry out completely.  It will take you days to cook these puppies - if they ever cook thru.

add a few tablespoons of parmesan to the dough and a bit of milk for authentic gnocchi.

Good!  These are really easy to make and not as time consuming as others have made them sound.  It might take a few tries to figure out just exactly how much flour you should use, just make sure to add it slowly and keep stirring!  I served these with the Amazing Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce (also on this site) and dinner was so good.  Between the sauce and the gnocchi, dinner was on the table in 40 minutes.

Loved this version of Gnocchi.  I started making this a while ago, and now my 5 year old asks for it by name (which is really saying something, believe me.) 

One tip:  If you want to save yourself a bunch of time, buy the steam and mash potatoes.  While they are in the microwave steaming, throw the rest of the ingredients in a food processor.  Once the potatoes are done.  Throw them in, and mix the ingredients together.  Makes a great dough.  Less than 10 minutes.

It was my first time making gnocchi, and I wish this recipe had included more tips on how to make them fluffy and well cooked.  The gnocchi were doughy after they rose to the top of the boiling water.  They were heavy, plain, and not as delicious as the gnocchi I've had in restaurants before.  I'll try again though- this could just be user error.  Thanks for sharing.

you should not use russet potatoes. You will get a watery consistency. White potatoes work weel.

Well, I'm not really sure what this was actually supposed to taste like, cuz I've never had Gnocchi before.  It wasn't exactly easy, but after reading many of the reviews, I got some great tips.  SUGARJO really seems to know what's goin on with Gnocchi! :D  She's right, it's really bland!  Also the tip to put the mixture in a pastry bag (I used an icing bag with a large tip ;) really saved time and sticky hands!  I think I must've made it too sticky and not used enough flour.  I wish that the recipe had said how many lbs of potatoes, though it did specify 1 cup in the directions.  I will probably try it again though, it's different than noodles. :)

This recipe was my first attempt at making gnocchi from scratch.  I was a tad apprehensive about how well they would turn out.  But, this recipe is fabulous!  My man, who is actually Italian, said they were excellent!  I added more potato (1/2 cup or so), some seasoning for flavor as other reviewers suggested, and cooked them a bit longer.  Paired them with the creamy tomato sauce also from this site.  My man kept asking what I put in it exactly, and where the recipe was from.  Out of the park!  Thanks so much for posting!

I've never been a fan of gnocchi before but since my boyfriend loves it, I decided to give it a shot. This was better than any restaurant gnocchi dish I've ever sampled! I went with a few of the suggestions to add a little flavor to the dough before cooking (I added fresh garlic, oregano, and a little Italian seasoning) It was perfect! Be careful though, it takes much longer to prepare than stated...

My Italian neighbor used to make gnocchi for my family and I once a month.  Since she moved away I've been pining for a recipe similar to hers.  This is it!  My entire family loves it when I make this.  I was surprised at how easy this was to make!

Very good basic gnocchi recipe, I had a little trouble kneading the dough, added some salt and pepper when kneading, the results were AWESOME, served with Cuattro Fromaggi Sauce (Four Cheese sauce) and it was a hit at my dinner party!!!

Perfect! I used this in chicken and dumplings. What I did was throw (ok, gently place lol) some chicken breasts (2 large or 3 small) into a crock pot along with 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 1 can chicken broth, a cup of diced onion, 2 stalks chopped celery, a cup of chopped carrots, and a sprinkle of thyme; cook that on High for 4 hours; take the chicken breast out and shred into bite-sized pieces; place the chicken back in the crock pot with the gnocchi and cook on High for another hour. An easy and healthy meal that is especially nice on a cold winter's day :)

The recipe was fine, but the gnocchi were slightly rubbery, too heavy, and flavorless.  There's an amazing ricotta gnocchi recipe on this sight that gives light, flavorful gnocchi and I will continue to use that recipe because this one isn't nearly as good.

Maybe this is because of the flour I used... I'm not sure, but the didn't turn out so nice.  Very chewy and a bit too dense.

This is definitely a good recipe! Though I recommend bringing along some time to let the potatoes cool completely, since they'll get very sticky if you use hot/warm potatoes, so you'll need more flour.
For working moms: Prepare the potatoes a day in advance ;-)
Also use ~1lb of potatoes with 2 cups of flour.
For a better taste add salt and pepper to the dough.
If you are about to serve gnocchi for the first time and you don't have a clue how to serve them:
prepare a mozarella sauce and a light salad as a side dish, since gnocchi are pretty rich.

Good luck!

When boiling the gnocchi, be careful about them getting stuck on the bottom of the pot - stir them a few times.  Mine were a bit heavy - I may have overkneaded the dough.  Tip to shape:  lay a fork with the end of the prongs of the fork on the table.  Take a piece of the gnocchi and flatten it on the prongs.  Then roll the dough (like a tiny jellyroll!) downward.  That way, you'll have little grooves to catch the sauce.

I really enjoyed this. I took advise and didn´t work the dough too much - the last time I made it, I vowed not to make it again as it was really heavy. Well, tonight it was as light as a feather, I am pleased to say. I made a very simple tomato sauce to and topped it all with cheese, which I grilled and strirred in before serving. Absolutely fantastic, thank you so much!!

This is a great and simple recipe. One suggestion I have is to bake the potatos until fork tender. They obviously wont hold any water and much fluffier. Also, let them cool completely in the fridge before adding flour mixture.

this worked great- i doubled the recipe and froze half. Advice for those planing to freeze- Lay the gnocchi on a cookie sheet in a flat layer. Put the cookie sheet in freezer for about 10 mins. Then you can put them in a bag and they will keep for months!

These were pretty good. I used some left over boiled potatoes from the night before and mixed in about 1.5 cups of flour (until the dough felt right). They boiled really quickly...they started to float in about 3 min. I served these with a simple marinara sauce, but I think they would be amazing with a cream sauce.

If I would have known making gnocchi was this easy, I would have made it a long time ago.  I seasoned the mashed spuds with S&P and some chopped parsley before adding the egg and flour.  Also, I didn't measure the flour -- just added enough until the dough came together and was pliable, but no longer sticky.  I boiled half (and served with Roasted Garlic Peppercorn Sauce) and froze the rest.  Thanks for a super-easy (and delicious) recipe!

To those that ''threw it away because it was too dry''. The recipe is by volume , not weight , and even then flours vary in their level of absorbency. It you find it crumbly add a little more liquid, that's all.  What a world we live in that someone would throw away perfectly good food because they failed to figure out basic cooking logic. And for those that find making a recipe time consuming, well yes, cooking requires time and effort. That's why so many nowadays do not cook, it requires effort. So if you are wanting to make ANY recipe from scratch , you may be well advised to consider that it will be a little more work than buying pre-made, but the taste and nutrition will be so much better. 
Perfect proportions for the basic gnocchi. Add herbs and even dried veggies to spice it up.

Great Simple gnocchi recipe :). If you have the time, cook the potatoes in the oven (wrap in foil so they don't dry out).  For adventurous people, jazz it up with some dried herbs like parsley or oregano.   To make em fluffier, a add a teaspoon of baking powder.

Great recipe!! I have made this twice.  The first time I made it by hand as per the instructions the second time I used my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook and WOW what a difference it made in making the dough.  If you have a Kitchen Aid use it!!

Simple, tasty, and awesome. Cant believe I actually made this from scratch! I dont think I boiled the potatoes long enough, or I didnt add enough flour, because the end result was more potato than anything else. I will keep trying this though, as I am not very good with baking or recipes that call for flour. I served this with some marinara sauce and it was great! In the future I will try to add more ingredients, or experiment with a different sauce.

My whole family raved about this. It's definitely a keeper. However I used 1 and a half cups of flour like others recommended. I also doubled the recipe. One think I might add next time is some seasoning, or maybe cheese to the dough, since it was pretty plain without it. But overall, excellent dish. I served it with meat sauce.

This was very easy. Mine turned out well, and it was the first time I've ever tried making gnocchi. I microwaved the potatoes instead of boiling, and added salt to the mixture. Also, I started adding flour a cup at a time and kneaded until the dough felt firm enough to roll out.  I didn't add the full two cups, probably more like a cup and a half.

This recipe is very imprecise.  I've had to play around with the ratios of the ingredients.  Be sure to cook the potatoes with the skins on!  Very important!

These are nice to make if you are on a tight food budget! If I make them again, I'll definitely put salt and some italian herbs in the dough.

Because of boiling, had to add flour to handle dough, but this made gnocchi rubbery! Researched and found that traditionally potatoes are baked for gnocchi resulting in less watery potatoes.

I doubled the recipe right off. Boiled half for dinner and served with exra virgin olive oil, fresh garlic, and Parmesan cheese.Turned out perfect!! I used an old fashioned dough blender to mash everything together. I put the extra on a cookie sheet in the freezer and then bagged them when frozen. We had those last night with creme sauce. Just as good the second time around and so much easier! Just dummped them frozen into the boiling water and cooked  until they floated to the top. Thanks for an uncomplicated recipe!

This was like making dumplings without the chicken stock.  The gnocchi tasted good, but it took a long time to make.  I pre-peeled the potatoes and cut them into smaller pieces before boiling so they sucked up water like a sponge and took a ton of flour so the "snakes" wouldn't stick.    I'll probably make this again, but won't use so many potatoes (5-6 small russets) as this goes such a long way.  I made serving for six and barely used 15% of the dough.

I used this recipe as my guideline for making spinach gnocchi. I wanted to use up a potato and some spinach that I had lying around and it turned out great! I cooked the spinach down and put it in the food processor (probably 1/4 cup) and I added some of the potato to that to help it blend. Then I mixed in most of one small egg, and probably 3/4 of flour since it was a small potato. I paired it with my homemade roasted garlic cream sauce and it's a winner!

for the sauce I used milk, a bit of butter, flour to thicken, parmesean cheese, chili flakes, sundried tomatoes and a whole roasted garlic.

It doesn't get much easier than this!  I am a beginner and I didn't mess this one up. I didn't measure out two cups of flour; I just added it as I needed it.  Served this with spaghetti sauce, and it turned out perfectly.

This tasted very good.  The problem was it would become a dough that could be shaped.  All we had was a sticky mass, which we pulled globs from and cooked that way.  The taste was great though.  We used over two cups of flour, but still no dough formed.  Oh well.

I thought these turned out great!  Not quite restaurant quality, but I think that is more to do with the cook than the recipe.  I took the advice of others and added flour little by little - and actually used far less than called for.  Also, for the record, I would say this recipe would never feed a family of 4 as a main course.  Thanks for the recipe - I will use this often!

Very good recipe. I would recomend to cook the potatoes with the peel and peel them after cooked (and cooled). That way they don't absorb as much water and come out much better tasting.

This recipe was great!  My 18 month old son loved it and it was so easy to make!  I have to admit, I did cheat a little by cooking the potatoes in the microwave instead of boiling them. But it turned out just great!

Great base recipe. I cut out 1/2 cup of the flour & added 1/2 cup of grated parmesean cheese, also a dash of nutmeg, salt & pepper added some flavor.

Mom says it might be the best gnocchi she ever had. They do turn out exactly like you want gnocchi to be: chewy and dense. Yum.

When I made them, the dough was very stretchy and a little sticky, but I thought a test piece seemed dense enough and I didn't want to add any more flour... rolling out the 'worms' was almost impossible but it was easy enough just to cut a lump of it into strips, and then into little pieces.

Was it just me or did the mix become quite gooey? And then whan i kneaded it, it was just to messy! I felt like a kid playing with play-doe. The recipe said that the gnocchi would float to the top when done, but it still was a little raw in the centre. BUT it did taste good, with Dijon mustard and garlic added to an Alfredo Sauce and Parmesan cheese on top. YUM YUM!!

I made this gluten free! I changed the potato to sweet potato and used Bob’s Red Mill Cup for Cup flour. I used pink Himalayan salt in the water when I boiled the dumplings. The recipe turned out deliscious.

I'm going to give this two stars because it has potential and is a good starting point. I've never made gnocchi before so I just followed this recipe using the reviewer's tip to add flour 1/4c at a time until the dough is the right consistency. It was quick and easy and the blandest thing I have ever put in my mouth. Even my sauce couldn't save it. I made again the next night and added salt, pepper and garlic powder which helped.

Simple ingredients but technique will take some practice. I used a ricer with 2 leftover boiled potatoes. I think they may have had too much moisture resulting in gnocchi that was a bit heavy. I boiled until they floated and then pan fried in butter and parsley and served with parmesan cheese. Some of the portions I let brown longer and I really liked those ones the best. I served the kids the gnocchi with a jar of rose sauce. For my first time making gnocchi, it was pretty successful and I'd be willing to try again.

I followed the recipe and ended-up with dense, hard dough balls.  I could also taste the flour.  I remember the gnocchi of my youth (made by my Italian mom) being light, pillowy, and only slightly chewy.  It looks like others had great success with this recipe, though, so perhaps I did something wrong!

My daughter keeps calling these dumplings. LOL. I think everyone enjoyed it though. My husband and Lindsay ate these with butter and Parmesan cheese. Josceline and I ate it with butter, "Pesto," and Parmesan cheese.

First time I've ever tried or even heard of this. Hubby is out of state working, and on the atkins diet. Potatoes are a treat for me! I halved the recipe and got to thinking? Why not add something to the boiling water? Like hot sauce? Wunnerful! Next batch? Added something that I call a mixed whatever. Garlic, onion, rosemary, thyme.....whatever. Keep it in a "whatever jar". As for the sauce? Lordy! The ideas are endless! Did mine with butter, parm cheese, pepper, thai sweet red chili sauce and ketchup recipe from this site.
Not a clue what it reheats like, but but will find out tomorrow! Also put leftover dough in the freezer. Don't think it will be a problem, and hubby might just have to try just ONE!
Thanks for the fun recipe! Can't wait to play with it more!
Almost forgot. Had real potatoes from a real garden. They did take a bit longer to cook, but didn't have to add all the flour. If you're a gardener? This is something to keep in mind.
K...Gotta go eat more of these!

I love, love, LOVE this easy simple recipe.  I got ready thinking it was going to take forever and it didn't seem to take any time at all!  My hubs was super impressed.  AND I paired it with the tomato vodka cream sauce from this site...My hubs said this was the best thing I ever made him!

Yummy! I still haven't figured out how to get this to be easier to mix, but worth the effort.

I used 1kg of potatoes and 2 eggs. Turned out like gnocchi! :) Just make sure the "sausages" which you roll out are nice and thin. Mine we a bit thick, and the gnocchi too ages to boil

This was a pretty good recipe. I think that when you boil the potatoes you should boil them for longer than just fifteen minutes. They were still really hard and I had to microwave them to get them to soften up. I made this with grilled chicken and alfredo sauce.

Tastes like you want it to. To make a creamier, tastier gnocchi, I suggest a little less flour, ricotta, and salt. Now, you have a mouth watering gnocchi.

So easy, I abided by the other reviewers pound per cup of flour. I had a little less than two pounds of potato and used 1 1/2 cup flour. Great in the Safron Shrimp and Gnocchi recipe!

I did not care for all the work this carried, and if you have never made, the directions are somewhat ambiguous....I would suggest sifting through all the comments.  Also have a plan B if it turns out mushy.  I will not make again - I love cooking and working for a good meal - this was more work and dicey results.

These had zero flavor and were very dense.  I only added 1 cup of flour, I don't think it would even be possible to had 2 cups with only 1 cup of potatoes.  I wanted to love them but it just tasted like balls of dough.

delicious. i made this for my grandmother, whose italian mother made gnocchi frequently while she was growing up. she quite enjoyed it. if you like a more potato-y gnocchi, like she does, add some more, but i like it just as is. i did the mashed potato part in my mixer on a fairly high speed, which made the potatoes light and fluffy - not only does it save work, but i think it helps the consistency of the gnocchi.

Fantastic! Being a university student, having a simple yet delicious recipe like this is wonderful. I used a thick and spicy tomato sauce with mine, and just a squirt of ranch. Definately will do again! :D

I had a lot of trouble getting this to work right... the instructions aren't very clear about what the dough should look and feel like. My dough was soft but mostly dry to the touch. It was still mushy after boiling. I think I'll stick to just ordering it at Italian restaurants... this seems like something you need to watch to learn. Thanks anyway!

What a great recipe for making this my first time!  I made in a food processor and started with one cup flour and added what I needed from there.  I also added fresh oregano, rosemary, and sage from my garden.  I did a brown butter and sage sauce for 1/2 and the other 1/2 in with home-made marinara.  So good!!!!

These turned out great with a few changes. I boiled the potatoes whole, with skins on, then peeled and passed them through a ricer. I used 2 russets, 2 eggs, salt, pepper and dried herbs. I added flour by the half-cup until the dough held its shape.

I microwaved the potatoes took 7 minutes, rinsed them with cold water, then mashed. it took max 25 to assemble and cook. I'd use this again and maybe look at the other reviews for suggestions.

My wife is traveling so I made this all by myself. I added some butter, parmesan, green onions, and garlic.  I used almost 2 full cups of flower. It took me longer than an hour, but I don't know what I am doing in the kitchen.  Served on over the counter pasta sauce. This recipe was easy and fantastic.

I managed to work really fast with this recipe and not use up all the flour required. The end product was really light and fluffy.  I think it was good, but my partner had some doubts. I think next time, I won't worry about working the dough too much and try and get all the flour in, I think that'll make it taste more like the kind they sell in restaurants and a little easier to shape and work with.

If you whip the potatoes with a mixer you will change the the texture of the potatoes, they will become starchy.  Use a ricer if you have one or a fine grater.

Good recipe - the family enjoyed homemade gnocchi. One note of caution though ... I often like to double recipe so that I have extras for freezing.  This is probably not the best recipe to do that - or at least be very consious of how much it makes. lol  I made the mistake of trying to use up my potatoes so I cooked about a dozen. LOL  After making gnocchi for almost 3 hours I gave up and put the rest in the fridge.  But I have about 4 meals worth (to serve a family of five) in the freezer. :) I did add some butter, parmesan cheese and garlic salt to the mix which added some flavour.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good, though I felt bad indulging in all the carbs! I used this recipe X 4. This was pretty easy, took me around 1 1/2 hour to have the full dinner prepared with sauce. Some tips, I peeled and cut the potatoes before boiling them. After they were done boiling, I lightly used potato masher than used a whisk. This made the potatoes smooth and fluffy. I then added 3 pinches of salt and 2 pinches of black pepper to the potatoes. I added in 3 eggs to the eight potatoes, make sure you stir right away when you put the egg in. After stirring in the eggs, I stirred in the a few handfuls of flour, basically when it just started to have the doughy look. After that I sprinkled some flour on the counter and took the remainder of the flour and kneaded it lightly. After making the snakes and cutting the pieces, I added it to boiling salted water and would fish them out with a sieve once 4 or 5 would come to the top. I actually had 4 full large dinner plates of the gnocchi, so I cooked one plate at a time. I ended up making a 13x9 tray of gnocchi with these measurements. After all the gnocchi was cooked I drizzled them with olive oil and again seasoned with salt and pepper. I served this dish with a Spicy Garlic Mushroom Sauce then topped it off with mozzarella and parmesean. The gnocchi's textue was perfect it just melted in your mouth!

Great recipe and very easy to make.  I did use a ricer and they turned out great.  I do think the key is to slowly add the flour so that they don't come out too doughey and are a bit fluffier.  I was able to make them from beginning to end in about an hour and the kids loved helping.

Good recipe, easy to work with but they came out a little tough for my taste. My grandmother used to make them and they were much more tender. We are eastern European and we serve then with bread crumbs browned in butter and sour cream on the side. Will try it again maybe using a little less flour.

This was okay, but it was my fault not the recipe I think. I am a very bad judge of how many potatoes it takes to make this lol. I ended up buying 4 large potatoes, thinking "hey, better too much than not enough". I ended up with a MASSIVE ball of potatoes and it only got bigger when i added the flour. I ended up using about 1/2 of it and made so much gnocchi that we have lots of left overs, the ball of dough is still in the fridge. I may just freeze it and use it later. Mine turned out pretty squishy, it would have been better if it was firmer but I was afraid to add more flour because the ball was already so huge lol. Anyways, this ended up taking me a long time to make b/c i used too many potatoes. It was okay tasting, but I think next time I'll just buy the stuff from the store...

This is a good, standard recipe for gnocchi.  I found it to be very easy, the taste and texture were good- the key is to not overmix the dough, and I used 1.5 cups of flour in the dough, and the remaining 1/2 cup on the board to work into the gnocchi while I was rolling it.  Remember- gnocchi is a pasta, so it doesn't taste like anything until you toss it in sauce!

This was a good basic recipe.  The people that complained about the taste or texture probably just don't like gnocchi.

I have been making gnocchi for quite a few years now and I think this recipe is misleading some people. I would never dream of serving or eating it plain. Just like pasta it does need some sauce. Another tip would be to melt some butter in the drained gnocchi and coat it with that, like you might toss olive oil in cooked pasta to loosen it a little.

I really wanted to give this 5 stars, but I just didn't enjoy this stuff. First time making and first time trying, so I don't know if I went wrong. Tasted bland even after putting some salt to the dough. I may try making it again, but only quarter of the recipe, and only if I have a nice sauce to go with it.

I thought this was a very fast and easy recipe.  Right up my alley.  I used leftover garlic mashed potatoes.  They were already cool, so I just added the egg and enough flour to make a nice dough.  Rolling and cutting took no time, and I dried them and boiled later on.  I will make these again and again.  What a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes, and my 17 daughter loves them!

This recipe is squisito and quick! I have always wanted to make pasta, but my thinking lead me to believe that it would be too complicated - not so with this recipe. I did not change anything, and the pasta came out great! I served the Gnocchi with jalapeño applewood bacon, sautéed asparagus all in a light garlic sauce. 
A few days later, I tried the same recipe for chicken and dumplings. The only thing I did differently was I rolled the pasta in quarter to half-inch thickness. Using a pizza cutter, I cut the pasta in two-inch strips then boiled these strips in homemade chicken broth. We absolutely loved it!

So...I most definitely did not follow this recipe to a T, but it still turned out quite well! I used three potatoes and two eggs, and I just added flour until the dough didn't stick. I dressed it with creamy mushroom sauce an served with asparagus. Quite lovely!

Wow!  I was so surprised at how easy this turned out to be, took me less than 30 minutes to get these done.  I microwaved my potato (used one because it was huge) to cut back on moisture and added the flour in slowly until the dough got to be what I thought was a good consistency.  I'm thinking I used about a cup and a half of flour.  I was easily able to get the ridges on them from a fork.  I think I made mine a tad bit too big, so next time I know :)  So excited this worked out so well!!

I have never had gnocchi and did not know what to expect.  I followed the instructions and ended up with heavy bland chunks of something.  They did float to the top as the recipe said they would so I assumed they were done correctly.  Upon reading the many many reviews, I think I may have kneaded the dough too long and added too much flour.  I'm going to try this again, adding only as much flour as needed to make dough and only kneading enough to bring it together.  I'll let you know.

Amazing! But add 1/2 tsp salt and a single batch doesn't make leftovers. Do a double. Also , I used 2 cups potatoes 3 cups flour. Not 4. I think I will try baking the potatoes next time so the I can use less flour and have more of a potato flavor.

Phenomenal. So tender. They went delightfully with my homemade marinara and chicken cutlets. Tip: once the gnocchi float, wait 12 seconds and then remove them to ensure they are fully cooked yet ultimately tender. Thanks!

This is the exact recipe that I was taught by a cooking school in southern Italy and by my grandparents (immigrants from Italy). It's the traditional recipe! Tip: add flour little by little to achieve right consistency because you won't always need 2 whole cups and sometimes you'll need a little more - it isn't exact. If you want a "light" version of gnocchi, replace the potato with ricotta cheese. The consistency of ricotta is similar to the potatoes so it cooks the same and doesn't change the flavour much, just makes it easier to eat more!

"Cook until tender but still firm" was hard for me to understand. I was able to pierce the potatoes with a fork, so I figured they were done. I ended up having hard potato chunks that made my dough dry, mealy, and difficult to work with. I mixed in the remaining mashed potatoes, but my gnocchi ended up dense and kind of hard. Judging from all the positive reviews, I'm chalking this up to a user error. I'll definitely give this recipe another shot, boiling my potatoes another five minutes next time.

I made this gnocchi as a breakfast scramble. The gnocchi recipe is really good I added some garlic and cheese to the original recipe for a lititle bit more flavor. After it was done I pan fried and set aside for a breakfast scramble. Add bacon, onion, garlic, and scrambled eggs over the top of the pan friend gnocchi and then made a simple Alfredo sauce to go over the top. Picture is included.

I made these exactly as the recipe said and these little fellers were dense! I didn't read the comments until after I had made them. Really, you do need to add the flour slowly and you probably won't need all of it. I am guessing a single cup of flour might be almost enough.

My son wants to be a chef, and after seeing kids on Master chef kids make gnocchi we came looking for a recipe! We came across this one and gave it a try. I was a little nervous as I had never made these before. They turned out great! My son had a great time and was extremely proud. Thanks for sharing! :)

This was the first time I've made gnocchi. This recipe was great. Simple clear instructions and they tasted great. I would say to start with a cup of flour and work up to the 2 cups if you need it. I wasn't thinking about it and added all the flour at once and ended up having to add some water. I made the gnocchi and then put them on a cookie sheet in the fridge until I was ready to cook them. Served with a light fresh tomato sauce. So good!

Just made this with Gorgonzola sauce- yummy! I took a short cut and microwaved the the potatoes in their skin to save time - brilliant tip from another reviewer. Added one cup of flour and kneaded the dough and gradually added another 1/2 c or so before the texture was right. I had small potatoes so I figured I didn't need 2 c per the recipe. Really good stuff. Next time I will bake gnocchi with caramelised onion and cheese. Can't wait!

Made this today for my hubby and his friend and it was my first time.  My hubby stated that they reminded him of how his grandmother's used to taste and thanked me multiple times.  The only amendment I made was I used leftover mashed potatoes instead of just plain potatoes, but it was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe  :-)  definitely a keeper!!!

There is a large variable in this recipe that needs to be realized.  Potatoes vary in size, water content varies and even the flour absorbs moisture differently depending on the weather. I am rating 3 stars because there is not much offered as to the dough texture you should try to achieve.  There should be some indication that you have a dough that is appropriate to continue with. The dough should give under light pressure. It will feel somewhat firm.  If the dough is the correct consistency it will hold together if you roll it into a 1/2 inch rope. It wont stick to the table or your hands.  If it does add more flour.  If too crumbly add a little water and try again.  The flavor is good but needs seasoning - salt, pepper- some Parmesan cheese perhaps.  I also find that baking the potatoes lessens the moisture and the need for excessive flour.

Tried this recipe twice.  The first time I used 1 c. smashed potatoes and 1.5 c flour and one egg.  Had to add more egg (a little at a time)until I got it to the right consistency and the gnocchi were a little heavy probably because of all the working of the dough.  Second time I used 1 c. potatoes, 1 c. flour and one egg and then added enough additional flour for it to bind.  That worked better.  Added salt to both recipes for flavor.  Drop gnocchi into water, a few at at time so they don't stick together.  This was great!!!!!

Easy and tastes great with the Hungarian Sliced Steak recipe I made it with.  
I baked the potatoes(3 medium reds).  Added about 1-1/4 C flour and it kneaded nicely.  Rolled in long snakes easily too.  Did put in fridge on pan covered with wax paper until ready to cook.  
Once boiled, I heated up some butter to brown, added parsley and stirred in the gnocchi.  Yum!

This recipe is just like my Nonna's recipe and the only thing i changed is I added flour gradually so not to overdo it. Also we roll the small pieces over the small part of a cheese grater to get the texture and it seems to go quicker than the fork method. We serve with homemade sugo (italian tomato sauce) and parmesan cheese YUM!!!

Fantastic recipe! Made plenty of gnocchi for our chicken noodle soup with no chicken, didn't have any on hand so substituted with gnocchi, just needed a filler and it did the job! They make great snacks too (though a little bland, with some onion, carrots, and maybe something else mixed in it may be more palatable, but still good on their own too, nice and chewy, had a bit of flavor too due to butter), and stuff them with a filling for great dumplings.

I did not have a problem with mealy flour or dry potatoes because I used instant mashed potatoes (2 cups of it).

Hints: Need floury not waxy potatoes. I suggest only Yukon Gold or blue/purple potatoes. Cut back on flour by about .5 cup. Don't over mix! As with any flour recipe, if you over-knead, you create toughness in the final product. Make certain your potatoes are well mashed. A ricer is perfect for this. And finally, to make th pretty lines and to have a perfect gnocchi, you need to master the trick of rolling them down a fork or gnochi board. You need to put the cut side down on the top of the fork, squish in gently with your thumb to create a hollow (which you will now ignore) and then roll it gently down the fork tines to the tip. There is NOTHING on Youtube to show you how this is done properly! Don't over boil and my final hint, cook your sauce on the stove top and add gnocchi directly to it before serving. DON'T put them in a bowel and ladle sauce over. Try it both ways and see if you can tell the difference. Sounds complicated but with a tiny bit of practice and care, you will be very happy with the final result! From a fussy cook, happy eating!

I was pleasantly surprised -- excellent results, and I'd never eaten gnocchi before or hardly even heard of it.  I added nutmeg and a touch of garlic and that was inspired.  I heartily recommend this with any pasta sauce.

I boiled 2 potatoes whole, skin and all and peeled after cooking.  I didn't need both potatoes.  I used 1 cup of mashed potatoes, 1 cup flour and 1 egg.  I didn't have any problems with the gnocchi falling apart or not rising.  Tastes like a pasta.

Really liked this as a base. Like many other people mentioned, I would recommend cutting down that flour. I used 2 potatoes, and they were big... so I just added more of the potato to my mixture.

Also, make sure to mash those taters up good! I used a potato masher, but should have mashed it more. I ended up with chunks of potato in my dough. 

Will definitely make this again. I think next time I will make sure to mash up the potatoes more and use 1-1.5 cups of flour per cup of mashed potato. I'm also going to add some spices and maybe parmesan into the dough next time. :)

This is the best gnocchi recipe I've tried.  Its super easy and it doesn't make a ton of gnocchi, so I'm not sitting around for an hour making gnocchi.  I did add a little basil and season salt so that it wouldn't be so bland.  Overall it's the best recipe, simple and easy.  I plan on using it with turkey sausage and tomato sauce.

I made this recipe tonight and to be honest, I was a little intimidated by it. In the end, my gnocchi turned out better than the stuff they have at Olive Garden, but still nowhere near my expectations. My gnocchi had a strange texture, and I couldn't finish my portion. I think this recipe takes a little skill to really pull off, and that was just something I didn't expect going into this. The gnocchi had good flavor, but I probably wouldn't make this again.

Delicious and easy! I used two large potatoes and about 2 cups of flour. I didn't really measure; I just kneaded more in as I went. Make sure you mash your potatoes well; my gnocchi had small chunks of potato in it.

These were fantastic. I was in a rush, so I used potato flakes to make my mashed potatoes. I don't recommend doing that unless you make pasta quite frequently so that you know what texture to look for. If you want to get pasta experience, start with "Grandma's Noodles" from this site. It was lucky that I doubled this recipe; I used a sage butter sauce and even my 11 year old brother devoured it!

Absolutely delicious and easy. However, beware that they may not actually float to the top and and you don't want to over cook them. And you may want to add a little salt/pepper to the potatoes to avoid the "potato" taste. Even if you don't the sauce balances it out. But super delicious and easy, it is definitely in my repertoire.

This was so easy to make, but like others have noted make sure you cook the potatoes all the way through or you will not be able to make the dough.

Fantastic gnocchi! I have always loved gnocchi and really wanted to learn how to make them. As a beginner cook these were really easy to make. I microwaved the potatoes to save on time. I also used small red potatoes (they were the only ones I had). I combined the potatoes and egg then added flour slowly until it made a knead-able dough. The entire 2 cups wasn't used. With 5 small red potatoes I got enough gnocchi for 3 people. They came together really easily and tasted restaurant quality. I made them for my dad & brother who are very picky with pasta and they gave them rave reviews. I appreciated that these had no butter or cream so they were a bit lighter. I plan on making a double batch next week for my entire family.

This recipe is simple and works great.  I used mashed potatoes that had butter salt and pepper added and also put in some pesto.  It still needed salt and pepper so don't be scared to add some to this recipe.

I made this recipe tonight, following exactly. Texture was perfect, but BOY was the flavor off! This is one recipe that needs to be seasoned each step! As is, a decent starter recipe, but I would not make it again unless I seasoned the mashed potato first with some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder...at least. Needs some major help in the flavor dept that a sauce couldn't help.

Love this!  I used a mixer, a splash of milk and a cup and a half of flour.  Once they float - they are done.  Served it with an amazing pesto sauce.  Perfect on the first try :)

this was a good place to start from.  thanks to the guiding hands of my mom this is a recipe which requires a sense of touch. She added flour till the consistency was what she remembered when she made these. so don't limit yourself to the amounts  shown. we had 3 generations making them for dinner & what a great dinner it was.

I didn't really measure anything, I just incorporated the flour into the egg/potato mixture til it felt "not sticky but not tough", dropped them in boiling salted water til they floated for a few minutes and served with a spinach pesto from this site - excellent!

I made these using left over mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving, reduced the amount of flour to 1 1/2 c as other users reported dry dough.  Turned out great and they are yummy!!  My 2 yr old scarfed them down, the hubby and I are going to be adding the rest to our turkey soup for dinner tonight. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm a first time gnocchi cook, and I was nervous that I'd make a mistake, but this recipe was super yummy and super easy the first time I tried it.  My husband is very particular about his Italian food, and he also thought it was just the cat's pajamas.

A fancy way to use pantry basics!  I used a little less flour, based on other people's recommendations.  I had never made gnocchi before, and they came out just right.  I served it with pesto sauce.

I used 1 cup potatoes, 1 cup flour and 1 egg. It turned out fine. I think it would have been terrible if I used 2 cups flour. Of course, I guess different potatoes would have had made a difference in dough texture.

My husband does not like pasta, so I gave this a whirl. He loved it. I served it tossed with a tomato vodka sauce and meatballs. These were not as difficult to make as I thought they would be. I'll make them again.

Turned out pretty good, although I will probably add less flour next time (almost added the full 2 cups). Time consuming, but worth it if you like gnocchi.

These made some tasty gnocchi! I did add salt, garlic salt, and italian seasoning to the dough. My potatoes needed more than 15 minutes to cook, so next time I'll cook them longer. Since they get mashed up, you don't want to fight with tough potatoes. Be sure to follow the reviews that say to beat the egg in first, and then add flour as needed. After I rolled the dough out in multiple strips (dusting with flour as I went), I cut them in small pieces (about 1/2 by 1 inch) and rolled over them with the back of the fork. I'm not sure the fork helped, but it was still fun! I served the gnocchi topped with the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce recipe from this site. Yummy! These take a good bit of work, so I gave them a four star, but with modifications and practice, they could be a 5 star!

The best way to do the potatoes is get a "ricer".  It makes the potatoes look like long spaghetti. This is the way my Italian Grandmom did it and they melted in your mouth.

My first time making gnocchi.  It was easier than I thought it would be. I didn't measure the flour, just kneaded it in until it was a nice soft dough. We served ours in a garlic & dill cream sauce. I will definately be making this again!

I tried this recipe last night with leftover mashed potatoes that already had chives in them (used 1 cup) and added the flour a little bit at a time until the dough was easy to work with.  Fried some onions in a bit of olive oil, salt & pepper.  These were grrrreat!  Will definately make again!

I saved time by microwavinging my potatoes for 7 minutes then spooning out the inside of potato.  Instead of 1 cup of flour I use 1/2 cup of parmesian cheese to 1/2 cup of flour.  I then use Souther Fried Cabbage from this site submitted by JNADX3 to place the gnocchi on.  I accompany that dish with Chicken-Fried Chops by Sydny also on this site.  What a delicious meal for a quick to eat evening.

It has practically no flavor at all...  I tried a piece by itself and it didn't taste like anything at all.  I used a modified white sauce to top it and it was a very nice meal for the price.  I can't believe how filling gnocchi's are!  I'll definitely try it again and spice it up a little.  I think a little garlic salt will do a lot to them.

Pretty good. They are a lot of work but they turned out better than the last time i tried gnocchi. (i ended up at taco bell with a bunch of potato in the garbage.) They weren't very pretty or uniform but they tasted as good as the already prepared gnocchi from the grocery store. Good recipe!

So simple and easy.  I boiled 3 potatoes for 40 minutes, mashed them with a fork, drizzled the beaten egg, mixed in about 1.5 cups of flour with my hands until dough was fluffy not sticky, then cut and boiled each batch for 3 minutes a piece.

Thank you SO much!  I wowed my family at Easter dinner :)

This gnocchi was excellent. I took the advice of others and only added a little flour at a time. Also DO cook the potatoes whole as you don't want then to absorb too much moisture. and make sure you mash the potatoe VERY well, so that the texture is right. It cooked quickly and tasted excellent. Thank you so much for a brilliant recipe! Also thanks must go to the genius who thought of the icing-bag thing - made the whole process so quick!

For a first time gnocchi make with some decent cooking experience this recipe was VERY easy!  Just be sure to add flour as you need it and you can't mess it up.  Definitely make extra mashed potatoes so you can make gnocchi the next day.  They are a great neutral flavor that you can spice up however you like.

This was ok. It doesn't take as long to prepare as stated and it would for sure not feed a family of four.  You would need to double it to make 4 servings.

For my first time making gnocchi, this wasn't very impressive. Some pieces were very chewy and others were a bit hard to chew. It was very bland but I added pasta sauce and crushed black pepper to the final product which helped a bit, flavor wise. Not sure if I'll try this again.

Easy, quick, and yummy!  I used 2 fairly large potatoes, boiled with skin on for 20 minutes, and used about 1 cup of flour.  I don't think I mashed the potatoes finely enough, but they were still good.  Served with a cream sauce with chicken and sauteed mushrooms and zucchini.  Will make again, maybe pay more attention to the flour used to go for a little more "fluffy" texture.  DH wants them used for chicken and dumplings next.

Very good, fast & easy.  This took less time to make than the recipe stated, and was great with a creamy basil pesto.  Best part was being able to have my 3 year old help me.  She loved rolling them on the fork!

Very easy and tasty. I didn't add enough flour but that is easily fixed, and even thought it was mushy (due to the flour) it was delicious. I'll tweak it as I go but I appreciate having a start. Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe for basic gnocchi, even though it seems that there is way too much flour (I ended up  using only a bit less than 1,5 cups, and I still think I should have used less) and that it absolutely doesn't feed 4 people as a main dish. I stirred in saffron in the dough and served the gnocchi with a store bought 4 cheeses pasta sauce. Great!

Okay.  A bit chewy.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used less flour (only 2/3rds the amount) to make the gnocchi less dense.  I'm not sure if this worked since I'm not positive how dense they would have been otherwise.  And I have no idea if this or something else like how I kneaded the mixture caused the rubbery texture.  However, when I reheated the leftovers in the microwave the next day, they were much better and no longer chewy!  If they turned out like that the first day I'd have given this four stars. Incidentally, since gnocchi, like any other pasta, ought to have a sauce, I served this fairly well with a tomato-onion salsa-like mixture, and the leftovers with a spaghetti sauce.

Perfect Gnocci! SO incredibly simple, yet so tasty! To respond to a few other reviewers, you of course need to put sauce or oil, or something on it. Otherwise it would be like eating spaghetti plain. I will definitely be making this a lot!

This was a really easy recipe!  After I mashed the potatoes, it only took me about 15 min to form dough and make the gnocchi!  I put a fork mark in mine to make them look prettier.

easy enough recipe.  I used a bit less flour as others suggested.  One note: the prep & cook time are way off for this recipe.  I thin it says it takes 1 hour 45 to prep when really it only takes about 30 min. from start to finish.  Don't let that scare ya - it is really a simple process.

I lived in Italy for 5 months and LOVED gnocchi and was in the depths of despair when I moved back until I found this recipe!  It's definitely a commitment (and I used about half the flour to keep my gnocchi light) but sooooo worth it!  I actually even liked them better reheated in the microwave, so make extras and eat Italian again tomorrow!

Gnocchi's are my husband's favorite italian dinner & he loved this hommade recipe!  His Grandma makes hommade Gnocchi's for him & he claims hers are much lighter.  This was not the case with this recipe.  These gnocchi's will fill you up & he was pleased with that!  I also liked them hommade, so we'll be using this recipe more often!

This is some pretty good stuff! It took a loooong time to roll it out and cut it into pieces. Some advice I'd say is.. the mashed potatoes, let them cook as much as you would for regular mashed potatoes! It said they should still be firm but they are easier to mash and knead with the flour if they are not so firm. I made a butter sauce to go along with them by melting some butter and adding salt to it and then you can pour it over. Also, for lack of anything better, to add flavor you can dip them in spaghetti sauce as well!

Simple recipe to follow. A couple of things here though, 2 potatoes is pretty vague since potatoes greatly vary in sizes. You may have to pay with the amount of flour because of that. Also, if you bake the potatoes, they give you a much drier potato and will result in a lighter end product. I also like to use a potato ricer while the potatoes are still warm to ensure even texture. These are great though! My first batch was really misshapen so I bought a gnocchi paddle for $5 and then next time they were perfect. Definitely a must try if you like gnocchi! Nothing beats homemade.

The perfect recipe!!! Super easy to follow as well.  Main thing to watch for is that your potatoes are cooked all the way If you can stick a knife through them easily they’re done! . After mashing them if they seem a little dry try adding the tiniest bit of water that in turn keeps your dough from being dry and crumbly. Also knead the heck out of the dough until smooth and springy . 

I also cut my gnocchis smaller. The ones shown were too big for my taste and it made it easier to roll them out on a fork .

This is the second time I have made gnocchi. First time was crazy! So I read a lot of reviews this time. I found a lot of the reviews talk about the moisture in potatoes. So I boiled the potatoes in large pieces some whole. I tried to have potatoes about same size and did not over cook. Took them off when they were soft not mushy.Once done I ran potatoes under cold water. I used a ricer.  I added an egg to potatoes and added flour a little at a time and worked it in with my hand.It is such a great feeling when you get to the right constancy. Took a handful of dough rolled so it looked like a snake and cut in pieces. Wasn’t sure some people saying roll on fork. No idea what they are talking about. Next time I will try to be more consistent with the size use a fork and press down on rolls and the pieces the same size. Like recipe boiled dough until it went to top. I had taken olive oil and fried garlic and a bit of onions. Put gnocchi in frying  pan for a few minutes  I used fine herbs.  Delicious!

Easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I made a nice sausage/tomato sauce and added some mozzarella for a very tasty casserole.  Yummy!

Truly awful recipe. Don't waste your time. I threw mine out.  The proportion to potato and flour are all wrong!

I didn’t use the full two cups of flour(it didn’t end up needing it all) and I seasoned the dough to my personal preferences and it came out amazingly. I will definitely end up using this recipe again

It’s the basic recipe but as my Gramma taught me is you add the flour until it has the right “feel” not too moist and not to dry. This was one of my favorites she served and she usually only made them when her friend who was a Priest in the Vatican would visit once a year! We are a large family and I now know how much work that was and it was always an endless bowl of gnocchi. Blessed to add I now have her big pasta bowl. It takes practice so don’t give up if your first few tries aren’t perfect!

I had to add more flour...Ijust added about 2 more cups of flour as I was kneading the dough. That's how my mom used to do it and she was born in Naples, Italy.

You need more potatoes than anything else. Only found that out after researching gnocchi. So a cup less flour will help this tremendously!  Or add another cup to a cup and a half more potatoes

I used a potato ricer to get a nice texture and made sure to not over mix it. You also don't want to over flour it for a more tender texture. So be mindful when putting flour on your surface. As well as when you lightly flour each pillow to avoid sticking in the pan. Very easy recipe. This was my first attempt and it turned out amazing.

Ratio of flour to potato is way off- like by a factor of 10. Should be closer to 32oz (1,000g) of potatoes to 6 oz of flour (200g).  Or 2 large potatoes: 1/4 cup of flour.

Turned out perfect! This was my first time marking them. I always buy them from restaurants. Super easy and fresh. I did cut up my potatoes before boiling. I salted the water and the potatoes were ready in about 8 minutes in the water. I cooled them with cold water and my ratio was 2 cups of flour/ 2 cups of potato/ 1 egg. I started with 1 cup of potato and added more until the consistency felt right, without too much stickiness.  We made a butter,garlic,mushroom,spinach sauce that turned out great.

Turned out really good! I had 2 cups of mashed potatoes mixed with the egg and only had to use 2 cups of flour to get the right consistency. I need to get a little better at cutting them to more consistent sizes and getting the grooves, but for my first time making gnocchi by scratch I am super happy with the result.

Made this a about dozen times now. Very good recipe. I find that using one pound of potatoes to two cups flour is ideal. One pound comes out to normally one large baking potato. If you add maybe an extra ounce of flour you can also achieve a nice fairly fluffy gnocchi. I find unbleached organic flour works really well for these as well.

I’m very happy with my first attempt at gnocchi. The 4 stars is because I believe the proportions are correct if you boil potatoes as directed, but there is judgement involved. As one well liked review states, the way you prepare your potatoes will change the amount of flour needed. I microwaved mine and needed only 1/2 cup of flour. I browned them in 1/4 cup of butter. The same kids who left the purchased gnocchi on their plates last week gobbled these up and divied up little sister’s leftovers.

Ratio of potatoes to flour was off according to the recipe, it appeared that we needed more mashed potato than flour as another reviewer had said. Will try again. I had fun making it with my child.

I added just a touch of olive oil and a dash of salt. Kids helped of course! Very easy, very simple and best of all, very delicious and the kids absolutely love it! 

Will definitely be making this way more often.

Use 2 lbs potatoes. Idahos.  Steam or microwave.  Don't boil.  Use a ricer.  Two large eggs.  Handle and knead dough as little as possible.  2 1/2 tsp course salt.  Gets you a fluffier final product.

I mashed the potatoes before I put them in a baking dish and put them in the freezer to cool faster.  When it was time to blend, I added the egg first, then added the flour little by little until I got the consistency I wanted.  It was delicious!

Made twice now.   Easy Peasy.   First time I ever had success with gnocchi.  Tender, nice could be used in soups and sauces and bakes.    Since the moisture levels vary so much with the potatoes,  I found it helpful to mix the mashed potatoes with the egg and then add flour until I get a soft and workable dough that isn't sticky and not stiff.   Don't worry if you use less flour than written.   Resting it a bit before rolling is helpful too.

Super easy, first time I've successfully made gnocchi.  I used gluten-free flour mix, but otherwise, no changes or substitutions.  I was SO happy when they all started to float.

Terrific, easy recipe.  I added only one cup of flour, worked it in, then added about 1/4 cup more.  Texture was very good at that point.  I rolled, sliced and cooked.  After cooking, i simmered gnocchi for about 20 minutes in a wild mushroom ragout.  The taste was amazing !  Look forward to making again, and trying different sauces.

I found my grandmother gnocchi machine and thought my six year old grandson would to make this.  I used leftover mashed potatoes from thanksgiving.  He measured everything out, mixed it up and made the “snakes” to put through the old fashion gnocchi machine.  They came out awesome.

I like this recipe, being a very easy base you can build on. Add a pinch of salt and some herbs to your potatoes before adding flour and egg to hit the flavor note you're going for. Also, thinner is better, as they plump up when cooking.

As it has been noted already it is best to add flour gradually as you go or you might over or under flower the gnocchi. I did not have time to let the gnocchi sit for 20 minutes but it still turned out wonderful.

The ratio of potato to flour was 1 egg, 2 cups potato and 1 cup flour.  Mixed until dough like consistency.  Lots of flour on table to avoid sticking.  Came out delicious!

This turned out well. Tasted really good. I had to add sn additional egg as the recipe as written did not turn out dough. I could of added water or milk but went with an sdditional egg since i was going for an eggy flavor anyway. We are at 3500 ft. Maybe Thats why one egg didnt work.

These turned out great. I riced the potatoes instead of mashing. Ended up using around 1 1/2 cups flour. The family gobbled up 1 batch and could definitely double for a hearty meal.

It definitely needed to boil for 5 minutes.  My kids had no idea they were eating pasta with potatoes.  So I made the dough in advance and they rolled it and cut it.  
I made 3 lbs of baking potatoes, 3 eggs and about 3 cups of flour, made in small batches.
It was delicious with a homemade bolognese sauce.

Very good!  I am making a gnocchi and chicken soup for the family tonight and didn't want to run to the store to buy over-priced, prepackaged gnocchi and I'm glad I didn't!  I agree with the reviewer that said the amount of flour will depend on how you cook the potatoes and amount of liquid they absorb.  I microwaved mine and they were already "dry", so I used a little more than ONE cup of flour.  I also didn't bother rolling them out, I just tore the dough into small pieces and tossed them in boiling water.  Might not be as attractive - but they taste the same and that works for me!  I hate that I'm on a no/low carb diet right now!!  I had to try one... ok, two... maybe three. :) but it was just to make sure my family would like it so I took one for the team!

Easy to make, although the instructions weren't entirely clear.  Specifying the weight of the the potatoes would be more accurate, as well as how to cook them (cut?  whole? with skin?  without?).  Next time I'll do 2 lbs, cooked whole, peeled after cooking and start with 1/2 cup of flour (along with 1 egg) and add more flour as needed.

Great first try on these, but the texture was dense. I cut the flour in half and ended with a better product the second batch. But for a first timer I'd suggest to try it with 2 cups of flour to get a feel for the fork rolling.

This was really good. I actually just made it from leftover mashed Potatoes. Warm them up and added enough flour to make a dough with an egg.  Just toasted them up in a skillet after boiling with some browned butter and garlic powder with herbs like the recipe recommended. so super yummy. my picky toddler is even eating it!  Going to try it in a chicken gnocci soup recipe and probably with some red sauce another night so many options thank you!!!

These are DELISH!  i made these a part of an Canadian Allrecipes Allstars challenge. #backtomyroots  Having grown up in Downtown Toronto's Little Italy this was the first home made pasta i learned to make. i only used the egg yolk as this is how i remember making it. i baked my potatoes. used the small holes on my box grater to run the potato through as i find this makes a lighter and fluffier pillow. i mixed the flour, potato and egg yolk much like you would a pastry.  i moved it around on my counter with my bench scraper until it started to come together. then i gathered it into a cohesive ball and wrapped in plastic to rest for about 20 min.  These came out light and fluffy.  So simple, so delicious. i served mine with a butter, sage and chive sauce!

I made this with leftover roasted veggies (2 diff colored sweet potatoes, butternut squash and onions) from thanksgiving added 2 eggs and the 2 cups of flour plus more for rolling. I think I had 2 cups of veggies. These were amazing!!! There was minimal difference in using the mixed veggies vs potato. I used a marinara and finished with heavy cream and parm. I thought I had made too much but between the hubs and I we ate everything!

this recipe was easy to make and came out delicious! I added 1/2 of ricotta and 1/4 cup of Parmesan? cheese to the dough mixture, which was a yummy touch.

This is a classic gnocci recipe. A lot of the time you have to add the flour until the dough comes together depending on how wet your potatoes are.  And, after cutting the little pieces off of the "snake", with a semi-light touch, roll the little knob of dough on fork tines or the small/fine side of a grater... for a tutorial, watch a youtube video if my description is not clear. (I'm 47, and I made my first gnocchi when I was about 2.... lol)     You can also use instant mashed potatoes or even left over mashed potatoes for this!   Just make sure the dough comes together and you can't go wrong!   Great recipe as is.

Be sure to salt your pasta water very well!!

A great basic recipe - much easier than you think it will be.  Be sur to have a sauce warm and ready to throw them into when you take them out.  Next time we will add herbs or spices to give the man a bit more flavor!

I followed the recipe as is, and the gnocchi were very heavy and dense.   Too much mess and effort to be worth it for me unless the taste is superb.

This was my first attempt at homemade gnocchi. I eyeballed the measurements based on one egg and one large baked potato. I tossed some light seasoning into the mix before adding the flour. I didn't measure but added flour until it came into a soft ball. Flour when rolling was essential. The ones I used liberal flour when rolling worked better. I rolled them on the back of a fork. 

I boiled some and then tossed them into a cast iron pan with butter and some fresh sage chiffonade until they got a bit of colour. 

I served them with fresh cracked black pepper and some freshly grated parmesean. They were light and fluffy with just the right chew.  

I laid out the remainder on a sheet pan to be frozen for later use.  

I will definitely be making these again. They were just perfect. Next time I'll try them with a gorgonzola sauce or perhaps a simple pomodoro with basil.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and the gnocchi came out heavy and doughy.  This recipe calls for way too much flour, which I discovered as soon as I tried to knead the dough. It was too late to fix it, so I continued.  It was edible, but not good.  I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before making this.  Virtually every review mentions using from 1 to 1 1/2 cups of flour,  not 2.  I will try this again, as I still have enough mashed potatoes leftover to make another batch.  If I have a better result, I will update this review.

The gnocchi itself did taste good, but is was rather chewy. I had to cook it for 15  MINUTES to get done!! In the end my guests only liked it because it had a nice sauce. Edit this  recipe and it could be a better one.

I followed the recipe exactly. The only difference I may have made is I didn't measure the flour. I added a little at a time until I could make a good dough.  Easy to make and great with Parmesan cheese and a good sauce.

The dough would not come together with one egg! I ended up 
having to put in three eggs, and the dough was still very dry. Recipes like this are not a standard one egg deal, it's more about going by the feel of the product. My potatoes were very dry to begin with so its hard to rate this kind of recipe.  I grew up eating the Roman style of gnocchi which is much lighter and far more tasty I feel, and you can serve it the same way you serve the potato style gnocchi. Give it a try and you'll never eat these again! By sew- crazy

Very good basic recipe. I added a salt after mashing the potatoes. After cooking, I sautéed with zucchini, butter, salt, black pepper and nutmeg. Top with Parmesan cheese to perfection.

It was my first time making gnocchi at home, and following this recipe I didn't regretted it! It turn out to be a very hearty dish, I combined them with a spicy tomato sauce. When I started kneading the pastry at first it appeared to be sticky, and I got worried I might have to trow it away, but I just kept sprinkling flour as I went on kneading, and the end result was very satisfying.

Seemed simple for a rookie but turned out challenging for me. Added a second egg, it got really sticky but the gnocchi turned out great! Can't wait to try again. Improved dexterity should mean taking less time.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make! However, I do suggest running your potatoes through a blender or food processor to make them extra smooth before adding the rest of the ingredients, as my gnocchi had tiny bits of plain potato. My parents and brother loved it, but I like my gnocchi to be just gnocchi.

I thought this recipe was perfect. The original said 1 cup of mashed potatoes. They were suggesting that you should boil two but not necessarily use them all. I egg, 2 cups flour, and  1  cup mashed was absolutely PERFECT.

At first it appears mealy and dry but if you keep kneading it all comes together. We will definitely make this again. It's a perfect recipe to make with kids as well.

Flavorful, simplistic basic recipe anyone can do.  With patience this recipe will turn out great.  I used 3 potatoes and made a simple pomodoro sauce with San marzono tomatoes.  Top with Parma cheese.

So simple! 1 cup of boiled  and mashed, 1 egg and enough flour to make a dough that's it?  Seriously, why did I wait so long to make my own?!

I guess I would call this a "3+" since I thought they were good.  I think I made them too large, which made them a little doughey.  The video was a help.

I made this with left over garlic mash with no issues at all. I used 1/2 cup less flower though and it would not form a ball in the bowl so I dumped it out on the counter and it came together perfectly.

I have made this several times. It is so simple I can make it when I come home from work and we can eat it for dinner. It is so simple my daughters (16 years old) make it when they want a snack. I have added garlic and Italian seasonings to different batches. They are so good! We usually put melted butter and salt on them before we eat them. This is the perfect recipe!

This was so easy.  Even though I forgot the egg until I started rolling the dough, I was still able to add it in and re-knead without a problem.  This is a very forgiving recipe.

Great recipe , they cone out perfect. I  quickly drop them into a pan of browned butter to cook for another minute or two after boiling. Gets a wonderful buttery flavor. Then I toss them with parmesan cheese. I don't use sauce as I usually end up eating most of them before I even get them on the table! I love these.

I wanted to make the Chicken Gnocchi Soup recipe from this site but in our very small town couldn't find gnocchi anywhere.  So I tried this recipe to use in the soup.  It was just what I wanted and worked really well.  The soup was great, and the only thing my husband suggested was some salt in the gnocchi.  First time I have ever made gnocchi, but I will make it again.

I made three batches of gnocchi today using this recipe. The third batch was using gluten free flour. If using the gluten free flour, I'd recommend using about 1/2 the amount of flour initially, and adding more until you get your dough to the right consistency. 

Some other notes: 

-Try not to use a starchy potato - the difference between batch 1 using "baking potatoes" and batch 2 using russet potatoes was huge. 

-If using large potatoes, you may want to quarter them lengthwise before boiling.

I have to give 4 stars bc I made adjustments. I typically only use about 1 cup of flour but it depends on the moisture of leftover mashed potatoes. My mashed potatoes always have a lot of roasted garlic mixed in and I add salt and cracked pepper. After boiling I will toss in melted butter with more garlic and sprinkle whatever fresh herbs I have on hand. These are a favorite and so easy, it takes 30 min from start to finish. I will never buy store gnocchi again.

I've made this recipe at least 10 times and it has always worked out fine for me. I peel the potatoes first, chop them up into inch size cubes, and then throw them in the water. Dough always turns out perfect, never mealy.

The gnocchi turned out pretty good. It's a bit tricky to get the dough to the right consistency. After mashing the potatoes, I added the egg and just half a cup of flour. It was super dry and crumbly. I kept adding tablespoons of olive oil until it finally hit the right consistency so I could add more flour. The olive oil worked like a charm!

After reading several different instructions from different sources. I used this recipe but I grated some cold leftover potatoes as I dont own a ricer. worked the dough until just tacky to the touch but smooth and silky, not like pasta dough or bread. turned out amazing. Fluffy and light, yet with a slight pasta feel. It was a hit with my Gnocchi experts so I will make it again.

Beautifully simple,  I used this to make a faux chicken and biscuit stew. Overcooking when boiling the gnocchi can make them sort of soggy, and overcooking the potatoes early can ruin the dough.  Just be careful, pay attention, and you'll do just fine.

I added a dash of salt and fresh ground black pepper. I only used 1 cup of flour  each of the 2 times that I have made them. The second time I also used a potato ricer instead of mashing the potatoes and found that the gnocchi were much smoother and lighter.

This was my first attempt to make Gnocchi.  I followed the recipe to the T and mine was dry like other comments.  I ended up having to add a little more potato and had to splash the dough with water.  That helped but I was still unable to roll into long strips and the dough was cracking.  I ended up kneading the dough a lot to get it wet enough which resulted in really dense Gnocchi.  My hubby really like this as it was different then the "normal" pasta.  There are other recipes on the Food Network site that look just as easy that I will try.

family liked it.  pretty flavorless; luckily I had a really great sauce.  also, the recipe understates the time.  from the time I dropped the potatoes in water to the time the last gnocchi floated to the top it was 1 hour exactly (including rolling out dough, cutting, etc).  Overall we'll make it again, with some tweaks.

I was craving my favorite soup, and it required gnocchi. I normally purchase pre made from the grocery store, but they were out of stock. Looked up a quick recipe and went with it. The dough was super dry, and hard to kneed. Next time I'll go with a different recipe. Cooked it for a little while longer than suggested and it still tasted like flour. Maybe two cups potatos to one cup flour, and a little more salt next time.

Made this tonight. First, I would say this is a great dish to make with kids who like to cook. The gnocchi were light and cooked quickly. One hint, if the gnocchi are made and you're not ready to put them in the boiling water, put them on a cookie sheet with some flour on the sheet. Do not have the gnocchi on top of each other as they will stick together and become globs.

Perfect gnocchi. 

I  used the electric mixer to mash the potatoes since they were too lumpy with a fork. This made them nice and fluffy. I added some extra flour as I kneaded these, since I sliced the potatoes thin to boil them and they soaked up a lot of water. 

I have only made gnocchi a few times, so I am no expert. But these came out perfectly.

I love this gnocchi for its simplicity. However, I do not use russet potatoes, instead I substitute 6 medium size red potatoes. My husband craves these little doughy dumplings & I add them to numerous dishes. Thank you for sharing a great base recipe!

The dough was dry and it was a real challenge to form little gnocchis. Not sure if I use this recipe again.

Followed the directions, didn't go into a ball.  I had to add a little water, still didn't work.  Tried to roll it anyway, put in boiling water, came out tough and dough tasting. Will not use this recipe again

I used this recipe for my first time making Gnocchi. I skipped the step with cooking the potatoes, because i had leftover mashed potatoes to use up. I found the ratios spot on. I mixed 1 3/4 cup of flour to make the gnocchi dough, and reserved 1/4 cup for the rolling. They cooked up in no time, and were softer than pillows!! After boiling i through them on a skillet over high heat to brown slightly and mixed with some of my homemade pesto. DELISH! Such an easy straight forward recipe, and such an amazing way to transform leftover potatoes.

Next time I will add a little salt. Tried to use mashed potatoes that already had sour cream and cream cheese added, and I think it made the dough a little sticky.

I am rating this 5 stars as this is an awesome base foundation for making potato gnocchi.  Personally I DID NOT follow the recipe.  We have 5 kids so I used 6 potatoes, 2 eggs and 2 cups all purpose flour in my sunbeam planetary mixer with the dough hook. Be sure to add the flour in 1/4 cup at a time and test with your fingers, if it's too sticky put in another 1/4 cup of flour until dough doesn't stick to side of bowl.  The potatoes I used were around the medium-to-large size. Herbs and seasoning add to your potatoes once mashed. Freezer to cool potatoes down if in a hurry. They turned out great and I will def be using this as a base recipe, so many awesome ingredients that can be added to the potato mix once mashed, they sky is the limit. So much quicker than making piroshki and vareniki for sure LOL! (I live in calgary, recipe for high altitude = fine!)

The recipe while simple didn't quite work. It was way too much flower. For someone who had never made this before, I was very sad that I couldn't make it work. I've read the other reviews and have written down the suggestions so we will see what happens :) I'm excited to try again :)

This recipe did not turn out well for me.  I wonder if I did something wrong?  The individual gnocchi's were dense and doughy.  I made sure I didn't knead them too much, and I cut them into 1/2 inch pieces.  I let the dough rest for 20 minutes as the video showed.  The potatoes were a little dry and could have been cooked a minute or two longer.  Does anyone have an idea as to why?

I made these for the first time and was shocked how easy they are too make, i have made pasta for years but always was intimidated by the though of making gnocchi. One comment though is 2 potatoes is a little vague would be easier with a firmer measurement either volume or weight, potatoes vary a great deal in size so like others i only added a little flour at a time.

This recipe was easy and cost effective. The texture was more of a dumpling than I would have liked, but that could be easily fixed by boiling the gnocchi a little longer until it meets your standards.  I like then to melt in my mouth.  I definitely be passing this recipe our to my mother-in-law and coupon group.

Oh! My! God! I've been making pasta by hand using the classical method for 40 years! In all that time, I never heard of gnocchi. I found this recipe by accident. I made this recipe last week for the first time. I've been making it ever since. It was fantastic! Once I made the gnocchi, I simply used a marinara sauce with parmesan cheese on top and my unbelievably picky grandsons ate it up! I have a new pasta option that works with my babies! In addition, I love it, too!

I've never had gnocchi so I don't really have anything to compare it too. The recipe was easy and I had so much left over I froze some, when I wanted them I just boiled my water and dumped them in.

I can't believe it was so easy. Now I have another use for potatoes. I did follow one member's advice to add just enough flour until the dough is no longer sticky, but still pliable. I did a test batch (7 pieces), which was a good idea. My toddler even liked it.

Awesome!! I have tried homemade gnocchi twice before, but this is by far the best (and easiest) recipe I've used. Mine came out nice & firm which I LOVED (some recipes can be a little soft for my taste). I think my husband and daughter would have liked them a little softer, but that's probably an easy adjustment if you wish.  Will definitely make again and again.  YUM...

I agree with "What's for dinner, mom?" in her review. There needs to be more help with the dough in what the end product should be texture wise and so on. My dough came out a bit dry. It rolled into ropes with some effort. Granted, this is the first time I've tried this type of a recipe. Followed it to the "T". I don't have a real good handle on what good gnocchi should taste like. Served with a jar of spaghetti sauce that was on-hand and grated mozzarella. I will definitely attempt this recipe again; adding some spices to make it savory.

Easy enough - these came out light and fluffy. I doubled the recipe - big mistake. Two potatoes would have been plenty my husband and 3 kids. I boiled the potatoes and beat them in my kitchenaid until I got the right consistency - and 'right' was a guess since I've never made gnocchi before. I served with a tomato basil sauce the first night, and an alfredo & sausage sauce the second - both were good. I will make this again - but next time I will try to jazz up the flavor of the gnocchi just a bit.

I substituted the flour for whole wheat and it turned out great!

Very good. Easy enough to make. Good directions. Yes, they are very filling but I doubled the recipe and still didn't have enough to feed my hungry family. We did have these as the main dish. Next time I will quadruple the recipe and hope I can satisfy my hungry mouths. Of course that just means that they were very good too.

I used a ricer for the potatoes. Added egg first, then flour based on a 2:1 ratio of potato to flour (based on weight), a little at a time.  (Usually end up not using all the flour.)  I'm still trying to learn the special rolling technique to get the "perfect sauce catching shape." My family loved it.

Instead of boiling the potatoes which adds water, try putting the whole potatoes with jacket on inside your microwave.  Overcook them,cool them ,cut in half and scoop out flesh. No peeling cutting or draining and drying the flesh of the extra water they picked up from being in water.

Better than store-bought gnocchi. I followed what another reviewer suggested: added more flour until the dough is dry to touch but doesn't crumble. I also used whole wheat flour and it was still good!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I'm not quite sure how this got 4.5 stars... It was too rough and the texture was not good. I've had different types of gnocchi before and they're all much more tender than how mine turned out using this recipe. I even used my favorite sauce.

Worked really well for me, thank you!  I did use just under 2 cups of flour for one cup of mashed potato and seasoned the mashed potato as I usually would with butter, salt, pepper.  Size was an issue, (my fault!), as the little dumplings expanded much more than I anticipated when they were boiled and then cooked in sauce.  Need to make the "snakes" much thinner than I did.  Will definitely make these again and get the size perfected.

Great basic recipe. First time making them and they turned out great! I used yukon gold potatos and rolled out 1/2 the dough. Covered in saran wrap and put in air tight tupperware in the fridge... it was good to go the next day too!

These were nice, I followed the advice of other members who recommended blending the potatoes, and this certainly made for a great consistency and texture.  I also used the trick of cutting a hole in a bag, it made it much less fuss and the Gnochi looked great too!  I used the Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce from this site with the Gnochi and all in all it was a great meal.

I was really excited about trying this recipe, but was sadly disappointed.  The first mistake I made was I did not chop the potatoes. I thought I had forgotten to do that, but when I read the recipe it said to add the potatoes. Still I knew better on that one. It was a messy process after that, and the gnocchi tasted bland and heavy. Not anything like I tasted in Argentina. Needs to be lighter

Never having made or had gnocchi, I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was ok, I think I made them too thick.  I doubt I'll make this again, it just wasn't our thing.

The best way to use up those mashed potatoes!  The egg makes all the difference.  Work the flour into the dough just until its not sticky.  Best served with a highly spiced or garlicky sauce. Yum!

You gotta have quite some space to make this...nice taste but I would recommend to buy gnocchi by Cecco.  Considering that I usually cook from scratch, when I decide to buy something done or half cooked it´s for a very good reason and a very good flavor.

I used flavored potatoes and added extra seasoning because I was afraid they would be bland.  It still didn't make a difference.  My husband and I thought it just tasted like dough.  I made some "garlic butter sauce" to help liven it up... it didn't help.  My husband suggested frying them, we may try this at some point. Not too eager at this time.

So easy!  I can't believe that I've paid $30 a plate before to eat this in a fancy restaurant!  This is fast enough for every night and nice enough for company.
