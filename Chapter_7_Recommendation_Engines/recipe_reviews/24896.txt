This is the recipe that my family calls "freezer slaw".  We make it and put it in plastic freezer containers.  Tastes just as good months later.  Just take it out of the freezer, thaw and serve.

We love this recipe!   I make it for my husband and dad who absolutely rave over it!  I'm making it right now again for a family function!  It's one of the best!   By far better than the store bought kind!

I was very worried about the "no oil" in this recipe.  I was very tempted to put some in. I am sooooo glad I didn't.My 4 young children and my somewhat picky husband (though you wouldn't be able to tell by looking at him)loved this dressing. I used my own regular coleslaw ingredients, and just used the dressing though, sorry for those of you that don't like the reviews on a changed recipe. Can't wait to eat the rest for lunch, yummo! Resist the temptation to add the oil.

I substituted red pepper for the pimentos.  Very delicious.  Assemble several hours ahead of serving so the flavors can meld.

Made this for an Ocktoberfest Party. Everyone seemed to like it, it was all gone at any rate. I liked that it wasn't the creamy sort of coleslaw. I added twice the amount of cabbage and peppers and stuff and still there was a ton of dressing. (Large-ish pool in the bottom of the bowl.) FYI

This reminded me of a slaw called 7 day slaw. My whole family loved it. It was the best ever.

REALLY liked this one. Although I'm normally a fan of creamy cole slaw, the flavor of this sauce is a nice change from the norm. It's just the right consistency, so it coats the slaw with a nice sweet and sour flavor, but isn't overpowering. Very quick prep with a 16 oz bag of packaged, shredded cole slaw. Definitely will be eating this regularly.

I prefer to use angel hair slaw (the thinner the better). Chill slaw and dressing separately, and mix together just a little while before serving.

This was OK, but we prefer the creamy slaw.  If you don't like the creamy slaw, try this recipe.  I do think it could use a bit of garlic powder.

We eat a lot of cole slaw and a lot of different kinds, and this was really average.  I was serving a mayo-based pasta salad and didn't want too much fat so tried this.  My husband said "This wasn't my favorite slaw," didn't eat seconds, and didn't eat leftovers, which is rare.  I thought it was okay but not great and ate it for days afterward to get rid of it.  It got hotter the longer it sat (probably the mustard).

This recipe was a big hit at a recent dinner party where I cooked all German food.  I didn't have any pimento, but I don't think that made any difference.  The dressing was light and I liked that it didn't have any oil.  This one's a keeper!

This was a nice alternative to creamy coleslaw, but I recommend letting it marinate for several hours to soften the cabbage.

Wonderful ... served this to company as a side with Chili Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with Apricot Ginger Glaze from this site. Love the no mayo dressing ... you could actually taste the other ingredients. I omitted the celery and bell pepper (didn't have any on hand and didn't want to go back to the store). I added grated carrots instead. This will definitely be my go to slaw from now on!

This was great! My hubby who loves the creamy style still liked this. I don't like the creamy but loved this! Thanks for the recipe now I can make this too.

Light and healthy.  I used half of the sugar and thought it needed more vinegar.  Will make again when in the mood for something different.

I had my Mom and Dad and brother over for a family dinner. Served this along with baked Red Snapper and beans and greens (from this site) It was a major hit they took seconds and thirds and asked for some to take home and wanted the recipie.  Only change I substituted 1/4 head of red cabbage for 1/4 of the green cabbage to add additional color. Be sure to keep very cold to preserve crispness. I did a ice bath by setting glass bowl in large stainless steel mixing bowl half filled with ice and tossed occassionally. Kept it perfect over a prolonged dinner.   I think we have seen the last of the mayo based coleslaw at my house.

This was a nice side with Hungarian brats and german potato salad. I cut this recipe in half but I think it would have still served 6. Great use of my mustard seed. I didn't have the green pepper so I used shredded carrots instead. I used red cabbage, which I recommend. Loved the celery in this.

I loved it.  I followed the directions but left out the pimento pepper.  You maybe able to cut the sugar or use sweetner substitute.  I mixed it up about 4 hrs. b/f serving so it could soak into the slaw.  I did have a little extra dressing pooling at the bottom of the bowl...either add more slaw or drain.  Again, loved it but my hubby only thought it was okay.  However, when it comes to food, we have very different tastes.  i like sweet and he is all about salt.

I loved this slaw!  I have never had slaw that wasn't creamy until now.  I will make this over and over!  I forgot to buy pimiento at the store, but the salad was still fantastic!  Thanks for sharing!

This makes a terrific mayo free slaw with lots of flavour.  The sweet and sour really came through in the taste I found and only gets better with time. The recipe is well written and easy to follow...I doubled it and happy I did.

I skipped the green pepper but added sweet Vidalia onion and substituted dried mustard for mustard seed. I have literally eaten the entire recipe over the course of one day, but I don’t recommend doing that.

Loved it!  Used fresh cabbage from my garden. Made the dressing the day before and put the veggies together shortly before the meal. Tossed together right before dinner.  Delicious - not too sweet   Not too tart. Crunchy, fresh and less than half the calories of creamy coleslaw.

I've made this recipe several times.  It is excellent.  I was looking for a non-fat, low sugar, snack type food and this is it.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and it is still good and tangy.  The sauce is just the right amount for the cabbage too.  I have also added lots of other vegetables in an attempt to get in as many wholesome foods as possible in one dish.  I have added red cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green peppers, onions, walnuts and dried cranberries.  It is excellent.  I think you could add what ever you wanted or make it plain and it would be good.
