These truffles were unbelievably easy to make and very tasty!  They had such a great chocolate & peanut butter taste and the pecans gave them great crunch!

Gosh these are good.  Easy, quick and minimal clean up.  My  kind of recipe.  I had almond butter and almonds, so I subbed those.  Any kind of butter  or nut would be great... next time I want to try this with cookie butter!

Hubs LOVES this One!
They are so easy to make and their very convenient to just grab a few for a snack.   I tend to go with savory things most of  the time, but my husband has a sweet tooth.
I'm a fan of both chocolate and peanut butter,  but not together.   I know... odd, however, it happens to be the Hubs favorite.
I will make these for him again!
I forgot to mention I didn't have the nuts called for so I used chopped, roasted peanuts instead.  I don't think it made a huge diference.

9.1.18  Don’t think of these only for breakfast.  They’re good enough to serve as an after-school snack for the kids, or even dessert with a cup of coffee or tea.  Creamy good, tastes fudge-y, awesome chilled, and very easy to make.  Only problem in this house is trying not to overindulge on them.   Betcha’ can’t eat just one!
