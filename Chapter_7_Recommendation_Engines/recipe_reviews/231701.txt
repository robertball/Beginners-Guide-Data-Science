Made these for company and they went over very well, though I did sub brown sugar for white and use fresh carrots.

Without a cooktop during our kitchen renovation, these were a godsend for Thanksgiving! We subbed in light brown sugar, and 1 serving of the sauce (ie recipe *not* doubled) covered our 2 packages of fresh rainbow baby carrots. Baked them in a Noritake pie dish covered in tin foil for about an hour at 375 alongside our roasted potatoes, and they came out with just enough crunch and fantastic amount of cinnamon goodness.

Careful with adding too much cinnamon. Other than that they were great!

Made them during a cold day recently, used brown sugar and a bit of ginger for more warmth in the after taste. Also used fresh carrots but I am sure frozen would work on a lazy day.

I served this with the easiest brisket recipe. They were delicious and we aren’t even crazy about carrots.

I made these with Splenda brown sugar blend.  They were the best carrots I have ever eaten.  Can sure see why kids love 'em.  It's like eating candy.
