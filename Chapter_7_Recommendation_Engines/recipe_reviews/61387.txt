This is a very good soup recipe.  I did not use the can of mixed vegetables.  Instead I added six small red potatoes cubed (as suggested in another review), with the skin on and 5-6 peeled carrots, cut into chunks.  I tossed in some frozen peas at the end and used orzo, instead of the fusilli.  It's yummy and easy to modify to suit your taste.  Thanks Pharlan!!

This was the best homemade soup I have ever eaten. Even better than my mothers. I added potatoes and carrots instead of mixed vegetables because I don't like canned vegetables, they have to be fresh to make a soup truely outstanding.

I have made this a handful of times since Dec.  The only thing I do different is leave out the pasta and add fresh carrots, celery, potatos in quarters, and beef stew meat if I want meat added,I flour the meat and fry lightly the night before in olive oil.  Then throw it in the next morning I have also used this for just vegetable soup. Vegetable soup goes great with Midnight Cuban Sandwiches on this site.  I do have to find a good homemade beef broth in the future to cut back on the sodium level since my husband now has to watch his sodium intake.  Any suggestions let me know. Thanks for the post.

This is a good starter recipe.  The nice thing about it is you can add veggies and your own spices and herbs.  We like bite-sized potatoes and carrots, and maybe not add pasta.  A can of tomato sauce is good, too, for color.  Grated parmesan cheese is wonderful for sprinkling on the top.  Crusty bread is a must(we like to dip).

Loved the flavor of this soup. The only changes I made was to use a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes as my kids don't like "chunks" of tomatoes in their foods. I also added another can of veggies. Next time I will use a "smaller" pasta as I thought the fusilli "took over" the soup. I will use alphabet pasta next time. This is a great tasting soup and will definately make again!

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so modified the recipe a little.  I used low sodium beef broth, a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes w/ paste, 2 large, thinly sliced carrots, 1 chopped zucchini, 1 chopped summer squash, a bag of frozen green beans, and substituted a handful of bow tie pasta and a handful of orzo for the fusili pasta.  Three-quarters of the way through the cooking I was worried that the soup was way too thin, but once the pasta was added, it thickened up nicely.  Ended up being very tasty, and the squash/zucchini didn't get too mushy.  Great leftover, too.

This is one of the best soup recipes I have ever tried. I make a double batch and freeze it every time. I just introduced it to my neighbour who wants a copy of this recipe as well.
Fantastic!!!

Made this for the second time today!  It's sooo good!  Took other reviewers suggestions and used flavored tomatoes, fresh potatoes and carrots.  I also added about 4 ounces frozen green beans. Also added a bay leaf and a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little kick. Delicous and hearty, perfect dinner for a cold fall day in the Midwest!  Thanks!

I had a problem with the designated temperature in this recipe.  I believe cooking the already cooked and.or canned vegetables on HIGH for seven hours is excessive and, consequently, rendered them colorless, gummy and tasteless.  I will try this again, using the same ingredients, but will use a LOW temperature setting for about the same time.

Very good soup that is so easy to make. I made a couple tweaks to it. I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas, green beans, and carrots) and used 1/2 a bag of frozen okra instead of a bell pepper. I also used 2 cans of diced italian style tomatoes (14.5 oz each) and I didn't drain them. I also used Ditalini pasta instead of fusili. I put this soup together in the crock pot and let it sit overnight. I started it in the morning as I was leaving for work and when I came home added the pasta. This will definitly be made again and again!

This was delicious and simple to make after chopping additional veggies.  I added potatoes and used small noodles as well.  This froze well as it made a lot.  I served this with Pioneer Woman's Good Bread (French Bread lathered in butter baked for 10 and then broiled till toasted well.)  Perfect meal.

Ok, THIS is why I love allrecipes.  So, I have this ground meat/rice/soy/water chestnut concoction in the fridge left over from the other day.  I don't want to just heat it up but I can't think of anything else to do with it.  Who would have imagined that 20 minutes of searching would yeild the perfect recipe to bring new life to this dish??  The original meal had plenty of onion and garlic flavor so I just sauteed some carrot and celery, dumped in a can of beef broth, some bite sized pieces of red potatoes and stirred in my leftovers.  Delicious, satisfying, completely camoflaged.  I love this website.  Now I have leftovers of my leftovers!  Never thought I'd get so much mileage out of a pound of ground meat.

I thought it was delicious. Instead of a can of mixed veggies, I added frozen veggies 3/4 of the way through because I didn't want them to get mushy.

Very good!  Although without a specific salt measurement, it's easy to make it too salty.  It might take a few times to figure out the right amount of salt.

I think this recipe is like the backbone of any good Vegetable Beef Soup, it's just up to each individual to 'tweak' it to their personal taste preferences.  I do not use soy & Worcestershire but a tablespoon of Kitchen Bouquet.  I prefer the Better Than Boullion brand for my beef base/broth, but a good alternative I've used (low sodium) is the Minor's Low Sodium.  Shop around online for best prices.  Sometimes I add garlic, sometimes not.  One thing, no matter what recipe + 'tweaks' I've used to make VBS, I ALWAYS do (I learned this from my Mom) is I use whole peppercorns in the soup.  We personally don't mind the 'bite' of a peppercorn, but if you do put the peppercorns in a large tea ball.  Overall the use of whole peppercorns vastly improves the flavor of any and all VBS recipes (can't explain it, just know it to be true). One last thing:  Cook noodles separately and never add to the soup pot if you plan on storing leftovers - they become a mushy, gross mess after the first night.

Very tasty broth, the soy sauce and the worcestershire give an extra flavor that I have never had in a beef soup before. I also used barley instead of pasta and carrots and potatoes instead of mixed vegetables. Whatever vegetables you like would work in this soup.

This was good.  I took others advice and used a few carrots and potatoes.  I only left it in the crockpot for 5 hours because everything was cooked and I turned the heat down to low because it was boiling even while on low.  My first impression was that the Worcestershire and soy sauce dominated the flavor, my husband seemed to think the same.  On day two that flavor resolved.  I would make it again but might try it without the soy and Worchestershire.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really really good.  I have been searching for a recipe that has hamburger, stewed tomatoes and pasta for the longest time! I was even a little leery about the Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce, but it was yummy. I didn't have time to add the pasta, but everyone loved it.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly - less water, more stewed Italian tomatoes, more veggies. And I didn't have time to saute the garlic and bell peppers - I just threw it all in the crock-pot. It was probably more like a chunky stew, very tasty.

This soup was very good! I read other reviews and added/omitted some ingredients.  Left out the mixed veggies. Added red peppers, carrots, and red potatoes. I also left out the pasta. Love slow cooker recipes, threw everything in and let it cook allday.

This was a darn good soup.  I did make a few changes.  I added some fresh mushrooms and sauted with the meat.  I also added fresh carrots and a small can of mexican style corn. Instead of stew meat, I had a New York steak that I had frozen a week before.  I cut up the steak and used it instead of the stew meat.  The 8 qt. slow cooker was full to the top!  I cooked on high for five hours and it came out EXCELLENT.

Great recipe!  The only change I made was to add a few bay leaves and I didn't add salt while cooking, just let people add it at the table, it only needed a little.  I will make this again.

Served this soup for supper to my husband, my parents and young nieces. Everyone raved about it! I used ground turkey, and I added a pound of turkey sausage, and used flavoured tomatoes (garlic and basil).  I only used 1.5 quarts beef broth, and used 0.5 quarts water (was worried about the sodium content and knew the flavoured tomatoes would help with taste).  I also cooked it at low instead of high.  Served it with biscuits!  Will definitely be on the slow cooker rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tweaked it just a little. I omitted the pasta, yet added a little barley. I used fresh vegetables rather than frozen, and I cooked it roughly ten hours rather than seven to ensure that the potatoes were fully cooked.  Oh,  I also added potatoes.  With a splash of homemade pepper juice after serving,  it was very good.

I was having a holiday luncheon and serving two different kinds of soup.  DH made this one for me.  He used about 1 1/2 pounds of beef stew meat cut into bite sized bits, home canned tomatoes, fresh vegetables instead of the canned or frozen mixture and added potatoes instead of the pasta.  It was very good.  Thanks!

I made this soup for my family.  It turned out really good!  They loved it!  My husband said it was one of the best recipes I've ever made!  I didn't read the recipe right and added the pasta when I added everything else instead of the last 15 mins.  The pasta kinda melted into the soup but it still tasted good.  My daughter thought it tasted like cheese. Lol!

We were not excited by the end results - we needed to season the soup to taste it at all, and pasta got mushy in leftovers.

My husband enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the advice of another post and instead of using a can of vegetables, I used carrots and about six small red potatoes.  It was so easy to make!

I make this for my family and they absolutely love it!  Perfect on a chilly day. The only thing I added extra was about 1/2 cup of pasta (Acini Di Pepe) in the last hour of cooking.  Really is delicious!

This recipe turned out great. My hubby swears its the best soup recipe I've tried. I left out the pasta and soy salt because I didn't have any on hand. I used 2 cubes of beef bouillon instead.

my pasta was mush by the time it was time to eat :(  If I overlooked that, it was ok - nothing special. I did add potatoes I was trying to get rid of but it was just hard to eat around the yucky pasta

This recipe is just okay. I followed it as it was written and it tastes a lot like the canned vegetable beef soup. I tried it though because I thought the ground beef would be easier for my toddler to eat instead of the chunks of beef stew meat that this kind of soup usually calls for. Will probably not use this recipe again.

There are many versions of this recipe available which makes it  perfect to customize to your personal taste.  I started with browned ground beef from my freezer to speed up prep time on a busy day.  .  I used frozen veggies instead of canned and also added a can of tomato sauce to give soup a little more tomato-y flavor.  Serve with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and warm crusty bread and you have a great meal that appeals to oth adults and kids.

Just fair...I added a lot to this recipe to make it more hearty, that part turned out well. I think it was the soy sauce that did it in.  Next time I will cut it down or out.

This was delicious! Whole family loved it! I did sub fresh carrots and potatoes for the frozen veggies as suggested by others and used orzo instead of fusilli. Will definitely be a staple that I will make again and again!

This just didn't have the great taste you would expect from a soup that had cooked all day.  My family ate it, but it was just okay.  I've had better.  I don't think I'll be making this again.  Thanks, anyway.

I added fresh carrots and mushrooms instead of canned vegetables . It was really tasty! I did add noodles half hour before it was done. I cooked on high for 4 hours instead of the recommended time and it turned out great! I would make this again

This was great!! I made it like the directions except I left out the can of mixed vegetables and put in carrots and green beans instead. I couldn't find the pasta that was called for in the recipe so I used Ditalini pasta shells instead. My husband kept going back for more, I said it must be really good or you're starving. lol. He said he loved it. I'll definitely make this again.

Very good recipe.  I made changes based off other reviews &  ingredients on hand.  Doubled everything except the tomatoes -  I added 1 can tomatoes &  1 can tomato paste  instead to add  a little tange & as a thickening agent.  Used plain diced tomatoes &  added 1 tbsp Italian seasoning.  Didn't have garlic cloves -  substituted 1 tsp garlic powder per clove. Didn't have beef broth so I used beef bouillon cubes &  water.  Added 2 cans drained mixed vegetables &  4 peeled,  diced fresh potatoes.  Cooked on high 4 hours adding salt & pepper towards the end to taste.  Everyone loved it!

I made a double batch, and tweaked the recipe. Instead of peppers and can of mixed veggies, I used fresh mushrooms, sliced.  3 out of 4 kids ate it, in my house that's a miracle. I'll make it again!

Very good! Next time I would use fresh veggies instead.

It was kind of bland.  I think I would have liked it better with stew meat.  It did taste better the next day.  But it is worth fixing again.

I will admit I was very hesitant b/c of all the canned veggies and being to salty.  For the most part, I prepared as written.  Exceptions I sliced up baby carrots and real potatoes, used 14 oz can of diced tomatoes (going w/ lower acid and tomato base) per others, peas vs. beans (what I had).  Added suggestions from others - 2 cans of beef broth, 2 T of Worcestershire, 1/2 teaspoon rosemary (will add more next time) and 1/4 teaspoon celery salt.

I cooked in the oven on 250 degrees for 11 hours.  My crockpot had past over the bridge :(   Was not salty at all.  Will make a double batch next time so I have more for the freezer.  Very delish!

This was just okay... I won't make it again, but we did eat it all. The texture of hamburger in it was something none of us liked and everyone agreed it tasted too much like soy.

What a terrific, simple, hearty soup for a dismal day!  I piddled around today, and ended up running out of time to make this in the slow cooker, so I just prepared as written on the stove.  I simmered about an hour, and added some elbows about 20 minutes before serving.  I made as written, but added a teaspoon of dried thyme and a shake of liquid smoke for more depth of flavor in addition to the other ingredients.  Loved this & so did hubby.  Thanks for sharing with AR.

The stock for this soup is outstanding and the recipe is a great base for customizing the soup to anyone's specific taste!  I think you could switch around the veggies & pasta rather easily and still end up with a really yummy soup!

I followed the recipe directions with the exception of three things:  I'm not a huge fan of green peppers, so I cut that amount down to one-half a pepper; I used a 12 oz bag of frozen, mixed veggies instead of the canned; and I substituted barley for the pasta and added it in at the beginning of the cook time.

Next time I make it, I think I'll try using small cubed beef instead of hamburger just to make it a little heartier, but this is a really nice soup recipe just the way it is, too!

Thank you!!

I'd try it with soup beef next time and substituted carrots for the canned mixed veggies.

This is my first successful attempt at making soup! Thanks for the wonderful recipe! I just wish there was a way to reduce the sodium and still have all the flavor this has! It was delish! We made it with ground elk meat and loved every bite! We'll make again for sure!!!

Excellent soup.  Only added oregano and cooked the pasta before adding to soup.  Husband said 4 stars, but changed it to 5 stars when he helped himself to a second bowl!!
