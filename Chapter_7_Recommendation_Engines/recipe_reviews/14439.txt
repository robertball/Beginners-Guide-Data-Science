I've made Frog Eye Salad for 20 years and I always get requests for this recipe.  It's always fun to see someone else's version.  I would not put coconut in anything, but that's me.  Might I make a suggestion.  I always do this in two steps.  Make the pasta and the egg mixture first.  Put it together and refrigerate it overnight.  In the meantime dump all your fruits together in a bowl and put them in the fridge as well.  The next day, just before serving, dump your fruit in and stir, and then add your cool whip.  Keeps everything firm without melting down.  I have also always used the colored minature marshmallows, it just gives the salad a more fruity flavor.

I LOVE this salad.  Though, to make it easier I took out the first 7 ingredients and skipped the first step, and just made vanilla instant pudding.  A lot easier.

This is a wonderful recipe. However it is very addictive. Children like it as long as you use a different name and omit the coconut. The only change I make is, I boil the pasta in pineapple juice, this helps with the blandness of the pasta.

I've always considered Cool Whip disgusting and never used it in anything and always avoid it but since my husband loves it, I made this for him and to my surprise, I actually love it and find myself making it often. I find that it has a much better texture if you make sure that the pasta, fruit and egg mixture are VERY cold before adding the whipped topping. I usually put the bowl of it in the freezer for half an hour to chill it before adding the CW. I also don't thaw the CW. Makes a great difference. I also find that it tastes better with a little less than the full cup of coconut. Don't let a dislike of non dairy topping prevent you from trying this.

I have made this recipe numerous times (minus the coconut). I use a 12oz. carton of "lite" whipped topping, and also use the drained juice from the pineapple to avoid having to buy it.  This recipe does make a lot so I usually cut it in half, although it is so yummy that a whole batch would get eaten in no time!

This recipe has all the pieces of being a great summer fruit salad... I marinated the pasta in the cooked mixture overnight because I made part of a day in advance, so the pasta swelled even more so!  I also added blueberries, grapes and sliced bananas(just before serving).  If you can find them, use the pastel colored marshmallows for added color.  What a success!

Watch out this makes a large amount.  I think it serves about 20 or more.  My husband and I have five children so I usually cook large amounts or double most recipes, but this recipe lasted for days.  Either cut in half for a regular family size or use as directed for picnics or family gatherings.  But it is GREAT.

I love this stuff!  This is almost the same recipe that I've made for years.  The only differences are that mine calls for 1/2 pkg of pasta to the amount of sauce shown here.  So, If following this recipe, I would double the sauce.  Also I never add this much fruit.  I prefer it with less.  I use 2 cans of mandarin oranges and one large can of pineapple tidbits.  I drain the juice from these and use it for the sauce.  Sometimes I skip the marshmallows, It's plenty sweet without.

It seems weird to have pasta with fruit/sugar but it's good.  I've made it before as the recipe states, but this time I left out the coconut and also used instant vanilla pudding (5.1 oz box)mixed with the juice from the pineapple and oranges, instead of the first 7 ingredients. It tastes just as good if not better and is a lot quicker!  I only used one large can of crushed pineapple and 2 (11oz) cans of oranges and it was enough.  My young kids love this salad-hubby too.

I love this salad!!  In an effort to lighten it up i drained the juice from the pineapple and added a splash orange juice and combined it with 1 cup splenda, I completely left the eggs out, I achieved the same excellent results!!  I also did it in 2 steps, the next morning i added fat free cool whip, only a handful of marshmellows, and about 1/2 cup coconut...achieved great taste, the family loves it!!!

Fantastic kid pleasing recipe - we liked it too. A great foil to spicy foods - Mexican, BBQ, etc. I used canned tropical fruit and chopped marachino cherries instead of pineapple and the juice from both instead of the pineapple juice. Vanilla Cool Whip was delicious - and I am not a Cool Whip fan. Left out the coconut and added fruity mini marshmallows as one reviewer suggested. Fantastic!

I have made Frog-Eye many times and 
was looking for a variation to try and 
noted 2 1/2 tsps. salt. Is this right?
All others only call for 1/2 tsp. for 
the same recipes. I also add a tblspn.
of orange zest to give a little zing.

Delicious fruit salad like my mom used to make.  I used lite whipped topping and omitted the coconut. I used canned peaches instead of oranges and sliced fresh peaches on top before serving - I also added some cinnimon, fabulous with the peaches. This makes a huge amount of salad, but everyone (7 adults) loved it and it was gone by the next day. Thanks for the recipe, Judy!

This feed more than 12 servings, so be careful. There was a ton of pasta and it wasnt was I was used to. Usually it has more coolwhip and about a 1/3 of the pasta. The flavor was good but not as good as the ones I've had in the past. I did omit the coconut and it was just as good.

Frog Eye Salad has been at every family dinner that I can remember. I have made it over the years, calling my Mom each time for the recipe. Her memory isn't the same anymore, so a huge thank you to Judy for helping a family tradition live on. (for allergy reasons I don't use the coconut and I add strawberries and grapes.) My husband will eat all 12+ servings by himself!

I have been making this salad for the past 4 years to bring to holiday dinners. Everyone loves it!  Each year I lose this recipe and have to find it again! It used to be printed on the side of the pasta box and I would buy the box with the recipe on it. Thank you for sharing this great recipe with everyone.

I remembered this frog eye salad from my childhood and have always looked for the recipie. I tried this one and it was out of this world!! I added cherries and did it using all the steps (not using pudding). Draining the pineapple gave me exactly enough juice for the recipie, so I wouldnt buy extra.I also chilled the fruit seperately from the pasta/custard mixture overnight.This does make a lot, a good size mixing bowl full. It was great for the size crowd we had. Thanks so much for this recipie and I will continue to make it again and again!!

YUM, YUM, YUM! It definitely makes a ton and I doubled the recipe for a group of 40 people. It hardly made a dent in the salad considering that it made so much! The kids thought the Marascino cherries were the frog eyes! Definitely try it with vanilla cool whip for an extra kick of flavor or mix in some vanilla pudding mix!

Loved this recipe!  Like many cookers have said...this recipe makes a nice huge batch!  Definately cut in half for family of 6.  I took some advice from some other cookers and made sure that the mixture was well cooled before adding cool whip.  I also did not add coconut--will try another time!  Thanks for a wonderful, fun recipe!

This is a great recipe! I have tried to make this before following the recipe on the back of the Acini de Pepe pasta box, but this turned out much better. I took it to a large family gathering and everyone loved it. I did omit the coconut, as  children don't always like it. Highly reccommend!

I served this on Thanksgiving and both the kids and adults loved it!  Everyone went home with a bowl of it! (I omitted the coconut though) 
Note: it does make a large batch

Our favorite!!!  I've made frog eyes for years.  I always double the recipe for big family holidays and it never lasts two days!  I make 1.5 times the sauce it calls for or it just isn't creamy enough.  I also never use marshmallows or coconut.  Just fruit, like Mom taught me.  Best side ever.  Everyone in the family tries to get the last bite, and we use our biggest bowl.

This is a great recipe, but omit the coconut- many people don't like it and this recipe makes a ton! (You can cut it in half.) Absolutely do NOT replace the cooked dressing with vanilla pudding.

I love frog-eye salad, and this recipe made me love it even more!  I made this for a family BBQ, and everyone loved it!  I followed some of the recommendations to reduce the sugar (I only used 1/2 cup).  I also added some maraschino cherries, and added more marshmallows because there a lot of kids at the BBQ.  The only thing I would be aware of is to make use the eggs are beaten very well.

This is a great salad--we've been making it for several years.  My husband requests this for all his birthdays, and any time we're asked to bring a salad, he pipes up with a hopeful, "Frog Eye Salad?"  We have always done the basic pineapple and mandarin orange addition, but marshmallows and coconut are also a fun treat.  I personally prefer it without coconut, even though I like coconut, because it ruins the texture for me.  We like to add colored marshmallows for an even yummier effect, and I really like this salad with fresh seasonal fruit, too, like strawberries, peaches, grapes, oranges, apples, and so on.  Other people I know love kiwi and strawberries in it.  Be creative; it's a fun alternative to a regular fruit salad!

This is awesome and even better the second day (if there is any left).  I did not add the coconut and next time I will use crushed pineapple in place of the tidbits.

Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Each time I make this salad, it's eaten right up! The taste is wonderful. Like a previous reviewer, I do this in two stages. I follow the recipe, but combine the pasta & egg mixture in a separate bowl and refrigerate overnight. In another separate bowl I'll also combine all of the fruit and refrigerate. Maraschino cherries are a must!! And I always add in pear pieces. Before serving, combine the fruit mixture with the egg mixture, and then add the cool whip. I've also learned from trial & error that two (8oz) containers of thawed cool whip is best! You get a more substantial fruit salad, and it's creamier. I also always use the mini colored marshmallows. I leave out the marshmallows if I don't have any on hand, and I've never used the coconut, because not everyone likes it. You can't tell a difference either way. The salad is still wonderful with or without those 2 ingredients. Other than a tweak in the stages of the recipe and the addition of one more container of cool whip, you can follow the recipe and it will turn out. It's always best when made a day ahead, NEVER make it the day you're going to serve because the pasta won't have soaked up the egg mixture enough and won't have substance. And it's always best when chilled thoroughly. This will keep for several days in the fridge, but trust me, it never lasts that long. I always have to make double batches.

I make this pretty often because I LOVE it!! I always do a half batch because a full batch makes a LOTTT. Also, I know I will eat most of it myself so it's better if I don't have 2 huge bowls of it in my fridge. I use the recipe exactly and don't leave anything out (especially the coconut!).

I tried this today and boy was it a nice fruit salad. I did not find the right round pasta, I think they were stars, but Very tiny. I drained the water from the pasta with a paper towel in a colander. I had peaches and used those instead of the oranges and added frozen chopped strawberries  as well. I like the texture,kind of like tapioca. Thank You Judy! I will try this again.

This is always a hit when I take it to family dinners.  I followed the advice of one reviewer and kept the pasta mixture and the fruit mixtures separate until closer to serving time.  I find that the fruit mixture gets runny after setting in the fridge overnight so I drain some of the juice out of it before I add the pasta/egg mixture.  We LOVE this recipe!!

This recipe is great, it does make a huge amount though.  I had one problem last time I made it.  I went to three different stores and they didn't have the right pasta, so I used Ditalini, which worked great.

Excellent dish and deceptively good! I have a lot of people close to me who are worried about the carbs and sugar and fat, but can't turn this dish down.  I substituted a cup of Equal Spoonful for the sugar and Cool Whip Free for the whipped topping.  Guilty pleasure with no guilt...

Very good salad that feeds ALOT of people.  Just recently my husband had a pot luck at his place of employment, we made 2 batches of this salad, costing $23.66 to make.. considering how many people it feeds, I am VERY HAPPY plus the salad is DELICOUS! We have been making this recipe for YEARS, it's a KEEPER! I mix my pasta with the sauce mixture only overnite, then after it's refrigerated for 12 hours + I add my fruit and a 16 oz. container of cool whip.  THANKS!

I have the same recipe, directions are a little different though.  After combining egg mixture adn Acini de Pepe, mix lightly but throughly.  Refrigerate overnight in a tightly sealted airtight container.  Following day, add remaining ingredients. My kids love leftovers for breakfast.  Since it does make a large amount, you may freeze leftovers indefinately, still tastes great, but the texture may change.

The Frog Eye Salad was a big hit with everyone over 40. The under 40s didn't enjoy it very much and generally weren't impressed. I would suggest making this when you have an older crowd.

This is the best frog eye salad recipe I've found.  Adding a 1/2 cup (or more to taste), of dried cranberries gives the salad color and tanginess to offset the sweetness; everyone loves it.  I use Craisins by Ocean Spray which are dried cranberries with a little added sugar, not too sweet and very tangy.  Yum!

I think this is the original recipe that used to appear on the box of Creamettes Acini Di Pepe pasta.  It makes a boatload of salad and takes time to prepare (there are quite a few steps to do it right), but I've never had anyone turn their nose up on it.  You can also freeze it, but the texture is different.  I've even made it with quinoa instead of Acini Di Pepe.  That freezes better.  I've taken it to outdoor potlucks with crushed ice around the bowl.  It also makes a good side dish with Christmas ham.  Pineapple and ham were made for each other.

I love this dessert.  My family has been making it for years in Minnesota.  When I first volunteered to make this for a club cookout, NO ONE was interested.  Now I am told that I HAVE to make it for every cookout we have at the club.  You can really throw people off if you tell them you could make PePe Salad instead. LOL!!!!!!

I love this. Make it every summer, but I cut the sugar in half and substitute at least half grapefruit juice for the pineapple. Usually, no marshmallows or coconut and fat free CW. That way it's even good for breakfast and no guilt!

Only a few people in my family like this dish, BUT....if you separate it into multiple small containers, you can freeze it and only take out the amount you want to eat. It is a GREAT idea and it still takes GREAT after freezing.

I halved the recipe, and it worked great!  I also skipped the marshmellows and the coconut due to taking it to a potluck and not sure about people's tastes.  Very good and easy!

My best friend, the world's pickiest eater went back for 3rd's and said if there was any left over she'd b e glad to take it home!  I didn't have any coconut but used Marshmallow Coconut Toasties which I was going to use as a different way to make S'mores.  Who knew it would be such a great combination.  P.S. There were NO leftovers!!

I have loved this recipe for years but never can find my copy!! LOL  The only thing I do differently is that I only combine the sauce and pasta in an air tight container overnight in the fridge. Then put the fruit, cool whip, coconut and marshmellows in just before serving.  I find the cool whip will sepereate from the rest overnight.

Brings back childhood memories!  I used 3/4 c sugar & left out the coconut & marshmallows; plenty sweet. Also, plenty of sauce for whole box of pasta -- makes enough for a group.  This  does have a unique texture but it's yummy & fun!

Skip the first 8 ingredients and just make vanilla or pistachio pudding from the box...add the pasta, fruits, and whip cream. Yummy and the kids love it!

This is served every Thanks giving at our home!  and is always one of the first to go!  We love it!  Drain your fruit very well- the longer it will last the longer you drain that fruit!   Also you can opt for Fruit cocktail instead of the pinneapple.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  Unless you are making it as an entree for a group of hungry giants, it actually makes closer to 30 servings, not 11 as stated!  I gave it the allotted time to sit but I recommend making this 2 days in advance because it was just OK the day of my event but it's really very good 2 days afterward.  It got mixed reviews at the cookout.  My kids didn't like it.  I think the name turned a lot of people off, and I came up with "Hawaiian Pearl Salad" for the next time I make it.  Additionally, next time I will forego the Cool Whip, which added nothing to the taste, and I will make a double-batch of the dressing, which is very good, and maybe a touch of coconut cream.  I sprinkled toasted pecans on top of the leftovers and they were a great addition -- added some needed extra texture and a color contrast.  All in all this is good as written, but can very easily be brought to excellent with a few easy improvements.

This is my go to recipe for my favorite salad!  I follow the recipe completely, except I do not add coconut.  This does make a lot so I would suggest cutting it in half if you don't plan on serving 20 people.  It does stay in the fridge for a few days, but gets runny after about 3 days.  I would suggest everyone try this recipe at least once in their life!

This is one of my favorite comfort foods! The recipe is perfect and reminds me of what we had at family gatherings. I followed the recipe exactly but for the whipped topping I used TruWhip (no partially hydrogenated oils) instead of CoolWhip.

The other thing I should point out is that you need to make sure to use 3 quarts of water when cooking the pasta and not the amount of water that is listed on the back of the pasta package because the other liquids (e.g. pineapple juice) in the recipe make up for the reduced water content. This wasn't obvious to me at first. Otherwise, the recipe turned out perfect and I ate it every night for a week!

So delicious and refreshing!!  I skipped the Coconut and added half a bag of Craisins.  I would also add more like a half bag of mini marshmallows and use closer to 12 oz of Cool Whip.  Next time I will be using 1/2 cup of halved Marachino Cherries as well.

This is a wonderful salad. Found it when looking for wedding soup pasta. I had to make some changes as we have severe food allergies in our family. Used mango juice for the pineapple, and coconut juice instead of lemon. Instead of sugar used stevia. Since my son can't have citrus fruit, I used fresh necterine, peaches, blueberries, pear,and mango. It came out wonderful. And since I ommited the corn syrup it was truely healthy.

Great recipe!  I did as another reviewer and skipped the first 8 ingredients and used vanilla pudding mix instead.  Worked great!  It fed 30 people easily at a bbq as a side dish.  I couldn't find the acini de pepe pasta at my Wal-mart so I used the kind that looks like rice, it worked good, looked weird, but tasted great.

I got this recipe from a great aunt 40 yrs ago she made it a lot to take to church pot luck dinners. She even put it in the church cookbook.  If you find this makes to much to eat a one time My aunt would always have some in the frezer for unexpected guests. I have really loved this recipe for a very long time

Great recipe! Only thing I did different was no crushed pineapple, and only 2 cans oranges and 1 can tidbits.  I also added 2 containers whipped topping and lots of marshmellows.

This is one of my favorite salad recipes and I am always asked for the recipe when I take it to a potluck. I would recommend that you marinate the pasta in the cooked mixture overnight before mixing w/ the other ingredients. I feel this gives the salad a much better flavor. I also added about 1 cup of pecans to the recipe and mixed in the marshmallows right before serving.

A family favorite I make a couple times a year. As others have said I also leave out the coconut and use colored marshmallows. I did need to make a note on my print out so I wouldn't mindlessly dump all the salt into the custard mix and instead divide it.

First, it's not fair to give a low rating and then say "I didn't follow the recipe".  Second, I've been looking for this recipe for a long time and couldn't find it because I always thought it was tapioca beads in the salad, didn't know it was pasta! Thanks for sharing, can't wait to serve it at the halloween party.

I gave this 3 stars b/c the flavor was great. It was the texture that was disgusting. The pasta ruins the recipe & I wonder if omitting it would leave an awesome fruit salad. I know it's supposed to be "frog eyes", but the pasta was bland & did nothing but take away from the great taste of the salad. I definitely recommend NOT substituting vanilla pudding for the cook portion of this recipe, b/c it is awesome! Maybe next time, I will make it without the nasty pasta (and I'm a pasta lover!) b/c like I said, the flavor was great.

This was an interesting salad.  I gave it three stars because it wasn't horrible but, it wasn't as great as everyone here claimed it to be either.  It was okay but, I don't think I'll make it again.  It made way too much and I had to toss most of it away even though I did make it for a big get together most people looked at it weird and walked past it.

It does make A TON though!  When I remember, I half the recipe.  We always have more than enough!

Made this for a graduation party, the box didn't have the recipe like it used to so came to this trustworthy site and used your recipe minus coconut, only because don't care for it. This was a hit. Actually more liked then the one I usually made from the box. So thanks for the help!

Some people didn't like, but it was always a texture issue not a flavor issue. I do recommend using the colorful marshmallows instead of the white ones to make it more visually appealing.

The salt measurement is in correct. In the recipe it states 2 1/2 teaspoons. The video shows 1/2 teaspoon. Thank God I tasted the cooked mixture before I added it to the other ingredients. 2 and 1/2 teaspoons is way too much salt for this the cooked mixture tasted horrible with that much salt.

Too wet. I followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't add the coconut) and it turned out to be too wet and not creamy enough. I did strain everything very carefully. The pineapple flavor was too much compared to when I've bought this salad at various delis. I was making this specifically because I crave it and buy it at the grocery deli all the time and thought I could make it myself. Using the pineapple juice was too much I think. Another reviewer suggested not making the custard mix at all (first 7 ingredients) and making instant vanilla pudding instead. If I make this again, I'll try that. There's not enough whip cream either. I doubled it (after completing the recipe the way it's written first) it's still not right. Be very careful NOT to over cook the pasta. You'd rather it be slightly under done than over.

This recipe has been in our family for over 40 years.  I have changed it over the years by using a large cook and serve vanilla pudding and making it with the mandarin orange juice. I also use a carton of "lite" whipped topping. This recipe does make a lot, it doesn't freeze well.  It's so yummy that a whole batch gets eaten in no time!

My mom makes this a lot and my daughter requested it for confirmation. One thing that Mom and I do is after the dressing and pasta are cooked, mix the pasta into the dressing. The pasta soaks up all that goodness and tastes even better! Also, I wold skip the coconut...texture issues at my house and nut allergies.

Really loved this salad.  Had never had it until coming to Utah.  I used light cool whip and it came out great.  Serves more like 20+ in my opinion.  Sweet and refreshing salad or dessert.

I made this last weekend for my family. They really liked it but it made soooo much. I have a family of 7 so I figured there wouldn't be much left since it says serves 8-12. This could have easily fed 20 so next time I'll cut the recipe in half.

Very good, minus the coconut and marshmallows which is just makes it too busy for my personal taste. FYI, this is a pretty large batch. By the time the pasta cooks and absorbs all the sauce I would say its 4 to 5 times the size of the box without the fruit and stuff added.  Feeds closer to 25 than 12.

I loved it! I halved the recipe and it still made a huge big bowl for the BBQ. I used vanilla instant pudding instead of making it from scratch. I did make my own whipped cream.. I hate the fake stuff.  I also left out the coconut and marshmallows that's just too sweet for me. Everybody loved it!

This salad is so good- it tastes exactly how my aunt's used to. It is definitely a dessert but if you are concerned about sugar content, etc there are things you can do to make it better. I do not use fruit cocktail, but I will often add lots of extra, fresh fruit: strawberries, grapes, apples, etc. I find that it doesn't really take away from the taste of the original recipe, and I like the variety. Definitely a fun summer treat!

This is super, minus the coconut and marshmallows (my family doesn't like either in it, nor do I).  I've made this for years and prefer this recipe to the one with pudding.  As others state (and the original recipe calls for) making it in 2 steps and refrigerating overnight.  In fact, I made some for last night for Easter.  This is my favorite pasta salad....I just have to watch how much I eat.

This is OK but not rave review material in my book. The fruit salads that use cottage cheese in place of the noodles have much more flavor. Made it, ate it, but won't bother to make it again.

This makes a huge salad. Waited to add Marshmellows, coconut, and whipped cream until a couple hours before serving. DO NOT wait any longer. This salad does not taste its best until it has sat for a couple hours with all ingredients in it. We tasted right after adding the last 3 ingredients and I was worried - it was not good at all. Took it to a party that night anyway and got RAVE reviews over it. I increased the mini-mellows to 2 cups, but should probably have 3 cups. 1 cup is way too sparce for this recipe. If I am only going to serve to family, I will 1/2 the recipe next time. Yum, Yum, Yum!

This makes a lot of salad! We like the marshmallows soft, so I mix them in with the salad--minus the whipped topping--to soften and to sweeten it. Right before serving, I mix in the whipped topping. It's a classic!

I made this for graduation and it was a hit.  I personally thought that there was a bit too much pasta.  When making it I put the glaze/pudding through a sieve to get rid of any lumps or eggs that didn't get smooth.  Also, I added the coconut and marshmallows with the fruit instead of waiting until just before serving.

Frog eye salad is always a favorite for the holidays! But it's not a fresh green healthy salad; it's a dessert. I use organic sugar, fruit canned in their own juice,pear juice and water and light whipped topping. I used to always use whipping cream and whip it myself but I tend to go the easy way sometimes and use cool whip. I don't use the coconut, my DH doesn't like it. But what a great dessert!There are ways to make anything a little better on the calorie intake!

Tasted like canned, overprocessed, too much sugar, 1970s food.  Not a hit at all.  However my husband liked it so I'll give it two stars.

i have been making this for a few years now.  I got the recipe from my mother in law and lost the recipe and this is the same one.  It is always a hit at parties and holidays.

My mother always made this as I was growing up, I keep asking her for the recipe and every time she gives it to me it somehow gets misplaced.  I'm so happy to have found it again so I can quit bugging her.  This was and still is a big hit at parties.

I have made this for years using a cut out recipe from the box.  I thought I would try and see if it was on this website and was thrilled that it is available in larger print!  The recipe off the box says it is for 25 people.  It also only calls for 1/2 tsp. salt, so that might be why one person commented that they hated it?
I am going to use several of the tips I have just read.  Thanks for sharing your ideas!

Too much salt. Also with all the sugar in the 'canned prepossessed fruit, I would not have added any additional sugar at all. For the amount of pineapple to mandarin orange, it overwhelms the orange. I would be inclined to substitute rice for the pasta. Old recipe from way back was just crushed pineapple, rice, and your choice of whipped topping. No additional sugar, and definitely no marshmallows. Beef up the texture a bit by adding some pecans or walnut pieces to the recipe.

I uses couscous original and it turned out well with good texture for the dish.  We took it to the family reunion and those who tasted it liked it.  I will most likely make it again.

Made the recipe as written.  It makes a huge quantity.  I sent the leftovers with my son's family.  My granddaughter liked it so well she asked me two months ago to make it for her birthday next week.

Delish. 
Make sure to drain the pasta and fruit throughly or it gets soupy. I added maraschino  cherries and a little bit of pecans for crunch.

I make one similar but without coconut and most importantly, I wanted to add that, the drained pineapple from the can is what I use. This recipe makes it sound as though extra juice is needed to buy.

I had star pasta, but only 7.5 oz, so I added minute tapioca, probably 1/3 c to 1 c. hot water and let it sit until the ingredients needed to be mixed. I also didn't have whipped topping, so I whipped vanilla instant pudding instead. Holy! This was sooooo good!

Well I think I did somthing wrong. I used 1 tbs cornstarch instead of 2 tbs flour.  I remade it using 1 cup pineapple juice and 1 tbs cornstarch (as well as the other ingredients) and it turned out great.

As many have found out, there are many versions of this recipe floating around.  I managed to track down the original recipe (can't remember where now).  Anyway, it originally called for just the egg YOKES.  It just acts as a thickener (with smaller eggs you may want to use an additional yoke) and it LOOKS better without all the stringy egg whites floating around.  This is how I make it, and I make this ALOT.

I've made this at least 5 or 6 times.  It makes a huge quantity, and unless it's for an event, or you have a lot of people to cook for,  you might want to start with making half the recipe.  It's 'desert' sweet, and kids love it.

This is a long time favorite!  As other reviewers have mentioned I use the drained pineapple juice to make the cooked mixture and let the pasta marinade in the mixture overnight. I let the rest of the fruit continue to drain over night in the refrigerator in a colander over a bowl so it is well drained. I put everything together the next day. This makes a lot and is great if you are having around 20 people.

This is one of our favorite salads to make for large family gatherings or to take to covered dish dinners. It feeds a crowd. Many people have thanked me for making it. They have also asked for the recipe. 

Something important to note: the salt must be divided. Do not add all of the salt to the pudding mixture.

This is an easy but delicious salad to bring to potlucks as it serves many.  I make this with real whip cream and put coconut in a separate bowl so the guests can add their own coconut.    With the whipped cream, if there is to much, I add more fruit to it.  One can never make to much!

I use only about 1/4 cup sugar, if any. My kids also love a lot of maraschino cherries.  One time for Valentine's Day I 'rinsed' the pasta with the maraschino juice to tint it pink.

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I did not follow the recipe to a tee.  For step one I used instant vanilla pudding instead.  It turned out fantastic! Everyone in my family loves Fog Eyed Salad!!

I will make this again but I thought it was "lacking" something.  I will try other things like French vanilla pudding instead of the sauce.  My family loved it and I will try it again only add a few other touches.

Made a TON.  Next time I will make a few changes.  No crushed pineapple or marshmallows (seemed too much).  Try one can pineapple tid-bits & one can fruit cocktail.  I cup each toasted coconut & chopped pecans.

I made this exactly as posted and it was an overwhelming success at the office holiday party! During the preparation (before chilling overnight), the mix seemed too wet. However, it gelled perfectly and once garnished with a little extra coconut and mini marshmallows, it disappeared from the buffet line!

I've made this for at least 10 years and my family still loves it.  I usually add a little more whipped topping to my recipe and then decorate the top with more oranges and some maraschino cherries.  Yum!

My family looks forward to this salad on most holiday celebrations! A must for summer get-together s as it is so refreshing. It is almost addictive but is perfect as it's not TOO sweet. I reduce the pineapple juice a bit and add some of the maraschino cherry juice when cooking the rue. Gives salad a nice orangey pink tint

We went to a neighbors house for Thanksgiving dinner a few years ago and they served this treat. I loved it from the first bite. When my neighbor told me what she put in it, I immediately cringed at the thought of eating Cool Whip. I learned the hard way that this recipe  we went to a neighbors house for Thanksgiving dinner a few years ago and they served this treat. I loved it from the first bite. When my neighbor told me what she put in it, I immediately cringed at the thought of eating cool but needs the texture that Cool Whip's artificial, chemical nature brings. (No really, I don't like ?Cool Whip - it's on par with Cheez Whiz and Pringles LOL)

This is always a hit and I am often asked for the recipe. The first year I made it my 7 year old nephew turned his nose up at it. His mom has taught him that most foods that are white, especially if they are unknown, are "disgusting" because they might contain mayonnaise. I told him to try it, and if he didn't like it I would give him $100. He said he trusted me, tasted it, and immediately asked for more. His brother would have said he hated it, no matter what it tasted like, and asked for the money. 

By the way, I noticed several reviewers say that they leave out the coconut, I couldn't imagine this without it. The coconut flakes add a texture and flavor that really adds to the flavor. Try real coconut. Most of the "coconut" you find in the store is some processed near-coconut, but the real thing is available.

This salad is wonderful. The key to making it great is to let the pasta soak in the lemon sauce overnight. The next day add all of the other ingredients. My sister asks me to make this every year. It's really different. I make it instead of a traditional fruit salad.

I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar. And left out the whip cream and marshmallows. Our family and friends loved it! This has been a holiday traditional meal for years.

I've made frog eye salad for 3 years now and each time I just add variations... this year I could not fine anci de pepe pasta anywhere and so buying the smallest pasta you CAN find will do... I used orzo.. only because I don't care for the taste couscous gives it... I've never added egg to mine because it makes me nervous, I've always assumed egg is only to add color? to which in place of I use non cooked vanilla pudding packet! I took out the first 7 ingredients of this recipe!

I don't know.  Most people passed it over at the picnic and though it as colorful and sweet, the kids felt that it had a weird texture with the pasta element.  Not gluten free, though a friend almost ate it because it looked like a fruit salad.

My husband is VERY picky. He only liked Frog Eyed Salad he got from one deli 35 miles away that cost $4.99 a lb. Thank goodness I found this recipe! He loves it. Only change I made was sub corn starch for flour. Mix 2 T separately with a bit of the pineapple juice and pugs in to juice mixture after it is heated. Then stir constantly til thickened.

Not many dishes all my siblings agree on and most of our kids as well. My grandma has always made this dish but with slight variations...more like 2-3 cups marshmallows, no coconuts...only mix pasta and mixture overnight and mix the rest the next day. It's perfect the way it is and I don't see myself trying some of the other suggestion.  Be careful when following the instructions with the salt. Me and my niece made that mistake :)

This recipe was easy to follow, with reasonably inexpensive ingredients.  I definitely would cut the salt back-at least by half, and not salt the water at all when cooking acini di pepe.  The saltiness takes away from the sweet, and I prefer the sweet flavor.

This recipe is exactly like a "24 Hour Fruit-Salad" recipe that my family has made for at least 3 generations, at all holiday meals !!! The only difference is the addition of pasta, and the sub. of whipped heavy cream for the Cool Whip. 
   This is loved by everyone that tries it, I have never seen a different reaction in 35 yrs. of making the recipe. One 
Easter I didn't make it and the family rebelled, so I never made that mistake again.
   This salad HAS to be in the fridge at least 24 hours for the flavors to develop !  As far as the suggestions by others to substitute vanilla pudding for the cooked egg,this would cause the loss of the best part of the dish ! Also, if you leave out the marshmallows, you lose the lightness and fluffiness of the dish. Coconut also caused the texture to change.

This is an all-time holiday favorite of my family.  Only problem is, when my kids were young they wouldn't touch it because of what it was called!  This recipe is one of those that's easy to make your own by putting as much or as little of the ingredients in it to make people happy.  Don't like oranges?  Leave them out and put in more pineapple. 

The sauce is very important so keep the basic idea and quantity so the salad isn't dry.  I'm going to try it today using OJ concentrate though. We'll see what happens!

This is great and makes a ton, I add drained fruit cocktail with cherries for additional color and texture.

I love this dessert. I always use fruit cocktail in mine. Keeps it interesting, rather than just getting bits of pineapple or orange. I know this recipe makes a LOT but to me, it's just the right amount. :)

I really love this salad.  It is a "fun food".  However I don't put cherries in it or coconut.  However I do add dried cranberries.  That is very good.  Next time I am going to add or change to some different fruits.

Maybe I did something wrong, but mind turned out kinda dry, and not very flavorful, thus my reason for three stars. Maybe less pasta or more Cool Whip will help.  Also, I think more mandarin oranges are in order. Too bad there aren't other versions of this recipe on this website to compare.

Flavor was wonderful, texture, not so much.  I loved the taste but I just couldn't get past the weird texture of the pasta.  I wonder if there is another kind of pasta I could try with it?  Also, using the ingredient measurements as stated makes a HUGE batch, way too much, even for our large camping group!  I ended up only needing half.  Again, loved the taste, disliked the "frog eyed" texture.

I did make this for the Graduation party and said I would rate/review again with what the guests had to say. Outstanding, and luckily I had printed several copies of the recipes for everyone who asked. I gave out around 60 recipes for this delicious salad. thanks. I did use mini marshmellows and I think that is what sold skeptics into trying it.
