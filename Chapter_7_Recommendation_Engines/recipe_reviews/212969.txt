followed the recipe to a tee and it came out great :) reminded me of my mother's cooking growing up. She suggested I add sugar and bay leaves next time and more vegetables like bell peppers and what not... good idea. I did feel it may have needed more variety in veggies. Otherwise, it was delicious overall ^_^
