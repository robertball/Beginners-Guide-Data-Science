I did not like this recipe.  It was cake-like as stated by other reviewers. I wanted a chewy oatmeal cookie and all I got was a sponge-like cookie. I thought it tasted like a muffin so I tried making them in the muffin tin.  It would have been okay as a muffin w/o the chocolate chips. I would not make these cookies again, we only ate a few, and the rest will probably be thrown away.

Great recipe.  Get the sour milk by adding 1 T. lemon juice or vinegar to 1 c. milk.  I doubled the cinnamon (it really needed that), and added 1 c. butterscotch chips and 1 c. chopped walnuts as the additions (nothing else).  My family loved these.  They come out puffy and soft, not chewy like a granola bar.

Best Oatmeal cookies ever! They were soft and chewy with great flavor.  I added some left over toffee chips to the last half of the cookie dough for a little added kick.  I also made it with 1 cup buuter rather than the butter flavored shortening, which I did not have on hand. I will make this one over and over for sure! It knocked my craving for oatmeal ccokies that I have been having for a couple weeks.  I highly recommend this one!

Not bad...but I was expecting a more buttery crispy cookie.  Make sure all know it is a more cake-like texture before making! Next time I will use my choc chip recipe and just add oats!

This recipe wasn't bad at all.  I made it with my 2 year old and he likes them very much.  So does the 8 month old baby.  I don't mind the flavour of them, although they aren't the most flavourful cookie I've ever had.  Good for babies with the soft, cake-like texture.  I found them a little better if instead of dropping them, you spread them out a bit so that they bake flatter.  I only added chocolate chips to mine, but I will make them again.  I liked the suggestion of using flavoured instant oatmeal instead of regular oats - I will probably try that next time to see what it does to the flavour.  Before you condemn this recipe, try it at least once.  Especially if you have very young children.

I should have read the other reviews before I made these so I'd know that they were cake-like!  I had to cook them an extra 3 minutes (about 18 minutes total).  They were okay though, but probably won't make them again.

These weren't the chewy cookies my Grandmother made. They were cakey like so many other people had stated. I thought I would try them anyway. My son had a brilliant idea...Instead of chocolate chips and/or raisins...We added chocolate covered raisins. He's such a smart guy! They were great! A nice cup of freshly brewed coffee and a few of these on a plate...That's satifaction. I'll be making these over and over!

These were good enough to make again - I halved the recipe and used only one egg.  I only got about 3 dozen cookies out of the half batch of dough.  Put chocolate chips, raisins, and nuts in the whole batch and added butterscotch chips to a few cookies, which was pretty good.

I made these for my son's snack day at school.  To my surprise, all the kids loved them.  Made them w/ chocolate chips and dried cranberries.  If the chocolate chips weren't in them they would have not been sweet at all.  I didn't find these to be chewy either - they were much more cake like.  I'm not sure if that is because I used regular milk instead of "sour milk"?  Not sure if sour milk is milk going sour? or if you are supposed to buy "sour milk"?  Anyways - I don't think I'd make these again even though the children liked them - I much prefer a more chewy oatmeal cookie - so I'll be searching for a new recipe.  Overall - I gave this an OK rating 3stars

These were VERY cakey in texture- and even that wasn't so flavorful.  We ended up throwing out the batter.  If you like cakey- then perhaps this is a good recipe for you.  Sorry!

Nice cake-y texture, simple flavour. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and that turned out pretty good.

I found this recipe because we had sour milk to use up. I read all the reviews - good and bad. This is definitely a cake-type batter - but is definitely one of the BEST oatmeal cookies I've made. I upped the oatmeal to 3+ cups and just added chocolate chips - no raisins. My boys have been eating them all afternoon - even the picky eater!!

This isn't a great recipe.  I even tried adding some spices and raisins to flavour it up, and they still were only passable.  And if people feel the need to add all kinds of things to a recipe to make it taste better, it's not a good recipe, and instead of posting a review with a bunch of additions, it would be better to post a new recipe.

Tasty--but next time I would use more rolled oats for more oatmeal texture and flavor. Also they crumble a lot.

Wasn't impressed with this recipe but I like a chewier cookie than this one.  The kids ate them and told me they liked them, but they did hang around for a bit before they were all gone.

These cookies are pretty good. I do like cakey cookies, these were soft but not exactly the dense texture of a true cakey cookie. Made 1/2 with choc chips and raisins, 1/2 with dried cranberries and white choc chips.

These were okay... nothing to write Ma about; I'm probably really picky, though.  I made a half batch, mixing in chunks of Ghirardelli white chocolate, dried cranberries, dried sour cherries, chopped apples, and a few walnuts.  I did use half whole wheat flour; next time (if there IS a next time), I'll use multigrain cereal instead of just oatmeal.  Not a bad recipe, Marylou-- just an exacting reviewer!!  Much love.

They are ok, but they don't taste sweet enough, or they are too fluffy, or something.  Maybe I just did it wrong.  I've made cookies the same way my whole life and this way was different, so I very well could have screwed up! :)

I thought these cookies were the best Oatmeal Rasin cookies I have ever had. They stayed chewy for days and have a great texture.

This cookie recipe was too cake like. It didn't have that chewey oatmeal cookie texture. I think an addition of another cup of oatmeal might help. I won't make it anymore.

Good taste and texture but too soft for me. I prefer my oatmeal cookies to be more on the crunchier side.

great recipe!!! my twist made it sooo good, instead of 2 cups of oatmeal i added 8 packets of instant quacker oatmeal rasins and spice flavor. they turned out moist and had the perfect amount of spices and rasins already in the packets!! highly recommend!! (add any instant flavor like maple and brown sugar or create your own)

I mistakenly used this recipe thinking it was one I tried a couple weeks ago... I omitted the walnuts and chocolate chips, but the cookies were very cake like.  If I were trying to make breakfast cookies they would have been good though ;-)

I thought these were really good.  I don't quite get all the comments of chewy vs cake-like.  If "chewy" means granola-bar-like as one person said, then I'd agree, they weren't that.  But then, I think most oatmeal cookies are too dry and boring, so this is exactly the kind of thing I like.  And I disagree that they are "cake-like."  They are soft and moist.  And they're even better left stored overnight!!  The only addition I used was the chocolate chips -- just enough to add a good flavor but not so many to make them too sweet.  (Actually, a nice compromise between the dryness of oatmeal cookies and too-sweet chocolate chip cookies.)  Rest of my family liked them too.  Thanks, Marylou.  Don't care what anyone says -- I thought they were great. :-)

Baker beware, these are  not chewy as stated in recipe title they are cakey and if you add extra oats they are dry.  If you like a cakey oatmeal cookie you will love them but if you are looking for a more classic chewy cookie pick a different recipe.

This was an easy recipe, however, it was not a chewy cookie as the introductory comments stated.  We like our cookies crunchy not cakey.  Too bad.

I loved that the cinnamon wasn't too overbearing, but I did add a 12 oz. bag of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  My kids had no idea these were oatmeal cookies...they "don't like" oatmeal cookies :)  These kept well too and stayed nice and soft for over a week!

These cookies were so cakey and bland! I hated them and the only reason I gave 2 stars is cuz my boyfriend liked them.  I think he was just being nice to me though.  TRY A DIFFERENT RECIPE!

Very different than the norm which the main reason I rated these as I did.  Almost like a spice cake in a cookie form with oats in it.  I substituted rolled dates from my health food store for the chocolate chips.  The mix of oats, raisins, crushed walnuts in this recipe is smashing.  My 1 yr old would like to add a few grunts and "yummy-yum-yums" to my review as well.  Thank you for this one!

This was the BEST oatmeal cookie I have made!! I loaded them up with walnuts and raisins,even more than the recipe called for. I think they would also be good using dried cherries or cranberries in place of the raisins.They were still as soft and moist at the end of the week as they were fresh out of the oven.

A good cookie, but absolutely not 'chewy'. This is a soft, cakey cookie.   I added extra salt and vanilla after the first batch came out since these first were overy bland.  A great base for additions like chocolate chips, nuts, etc.

I was not impressed by this recipe - the taste was rather bland and I didn't like the consistency of the cookie - it was more cake-like and puffy, while I was looking for something flatter.

Has the taste and consistency of a muffin, rather than a cookie.  Not bad, just not what was expected.  Very much an oatmeal muffin taste.

My Dad wanted a soft oatmeal cookie.  This is it.  I was very pleased with the shape, texture, and taste.  I made a batch on Saturday a.m. and took 4 dozen to work Monday and they were very moist.  Have e-mailed this recipe to several co-workers.  Very good cookie

I only added choc. chips.  I think this recipe would be best with more additions like nuts, dried fruit, coconut, etc.  They seem a little dry the day after cooking even though their in a sealed jar.

Not the recipe for you if you want a chewy oatmeal cookie. Wish I had read the reviews first. Very cake-y. Tastes pretty good, though.

I actually followed this one to a tee, which I don't normally do, and I was very disappointed. These cookies came out super fluffy, not like the usual consistency you think of with oatmeal cookies. I added nuts and raisins, and still, not much flavor. Now I have to do all these dishes, and have no good cookies to show for it:(

These tasted good and were soft but they just didn't keep well.  The cookies had a tendency to clump together during storage because they were so moist.

I tried this recipe at the same time as the hootycreeks and it was a little more involved but tasty nevertheless. I liked that they were lumpy looking and chewy from the oatmeal. Instead of raisins, I used cranberries and threw in white chocolate chips for fun. However, I think they don't need the white chocolate. They're great!

Cookies were easy to make, but didn't turn out the way I'd hoped.  They fell apart and were very hard to store.

If you are looking for a gooey, chewy cookie, this is NOT it. It turned out very cakey but moist. They are hard to keep because they stick to eachother. Not one of my favorite recipes, I already threw it away. Not recommended.

When I made them they were cake-like.  But they are still very good.  Not sure but maybe if you cut back on the eggs they would be more chewy.  I followed the recipe except the part about sour milk, I just used regular milk.

Very plain tasting, and not chewy. I would recommend using 1 less egg and more spice.

Very good - more chewy than others I have used.  I doubled the amount of raisins.  Next time I may leave out the chocolate chips and just make them a rasin/oatmeal cookie.

This recipe did not work well as cookies.  The first sheet of cookies ran into each other in the oven.  After that mistake, I turned the rest of the batter into cookie bars.  They're still too moist and gooey, but with some imagination, they still make a tasty after-school treat.

Terrific. Defnitely cake-like. Probably more pleasing and palatable for those who aren't oatmeal cookie-lovers. I like a higher percentage of oatmeal, myself, but these are for a crowd, so these are perfect. Thanks!

I'm so glad that I didn't read reviews before making these cookies, otherwise I might not have made them. I just had one, still warm, and it was good! Very soft and moist, with a little "chew" to it. I followed this recipe exactly, and the next time I make it the only thing I will change is to halve it. Yes, you can have too much of a good thing! Thank you, Marylou!

Mine turned out soft and bread-like. I had been looking for a more flat and crispy recipe, but once you eat one of these, you can eat several more without even thinking.

Since other reviewers mentioned a ‘cake’ consistency, I tried making bars instead of cookies with this recipe (therefore my rating is based on that, and not what possibly could have been a 5 star cookie recipe review)!  I googled how to make a cookie recipe into a bar recipe, and baked these for the recommended 24 minutes.  I could tell they were no where near done after 24 minutes so I baked them for another 15-20.  They still seemed undone in the middle but the sides were getting overdone so I removed them from the oven.  The first row (yep...I ate a row) was good.  I’ll be curious to see how the middle looks when I get that far (later today ??).  I’ll add a picture of my bars - minus the first row ??.

With my dislike to shortening & sour milk, I substitute with coconut oil & 1 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar+coconut milk mixture. Having run out of walnuts, I substitute with almonds. I also add 2 Tbsp of hemp heart & 4 tsp of chia seeds.  So far so good!

My grandma made these and she got the recipe from her grandma in the Netherlands    They are the best cookies    She would use have shortening and half butter at times and also would use  a cup of brown sugar and a cup of white sugar to change it up.  They are all very delicious

I read most of the reviews. I also made some changes. I used half butter/ half crisco. 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and only 1/2 tsp. salt. My thinking was that maybe they would not be so cake like. They still are. I wanted more of a chewy cookie.
