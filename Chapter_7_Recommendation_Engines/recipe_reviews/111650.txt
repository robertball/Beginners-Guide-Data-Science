If you rate this lower than 5 you have done something wrong.  I read through all the reviews taking note how some indicated the burger was "wet". I don't know why others had that issue, but I followed the recipe exactly as written, and both weighed & measured the ingredients, and my burger was delicious!

These are good, tasty burgers.  My only complaint is the mixture was too juicy to hold together well.  I added oatmeal before forming the patties but they still fell apart on the grill.  Next time I will try breadcrumbs and an egg and we will use our Forman grill.

Not a fan of this, and we're big Tequila fans too!  Agree with other review, needed more ground beef, or too moist. The burger just had too much seasonings, and I followed to a "t". Won't make again.

Recipe as is, is WAY too salty.  I took the remaining burgers and re-mixed with another pound of meat and everyone raved.

I read the reviews and could pretty much tell these were going to be too "wet" but  I went ahead and followed the recipe to the letter anyway except that I used venison instead of beef because that is what we have. After mixing everything together and even sticking them in the fridge for an hour I could see that they were still going to be too wet. Easy fix though because I just added a handful of breadcrumbs and that firmed them up real nice. I topped mine with salsa instead of the typical ketchup and I used A-1 bold and spicy for the steak sauce and we really liked them. Thanks!

The flavor is fantastic! The burgers kept falling apart on the grill though. I added some oatmeal and an egg to help hold the burgers together.

YUM! I took a shot of tequila right before dinner just for fun and these were soooo good! I added some coconut to these and I thought it complimented the lime really well.

I tried it anyway and they were fantastic. I had about 2.25 lbs of meat and maybe that made the difference. Everyone loved them. I used 1T of chipotle/ancho southwest chile spice mix, 1T of Montreal Chicken mix, and a little Lawry's instead of the Montreal steak mix. Quite a nice little kick. I'd do it again!
