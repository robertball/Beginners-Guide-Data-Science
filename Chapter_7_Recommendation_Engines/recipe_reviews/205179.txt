What a great recipe!  I didn't have apple juice concentrate, so I subbed 1 Tbl honey and added 1/2 cup minus 1 Tbl of water (in addition to the 3/4 cup in the recipe).  I increased the vinegar slightly to add a little acidity that I thought might be missing without the apple juice conc (I used 4 tsp of apple cider vinegar in place of 1 Tbl white vinegar.  And I used smoked paprika in place of regular.  This is a keeper!

Very good recipe, quick, easy, and very tasty. However, to those who are avoiding sugar, to be clear, any kind of juice concentrate has A LOT of sugar. Concentrate refers to the way it is made. The fruit is put into a huge maceration chamber where several bags of granulated sugar are added to the fruit and left there for sometimes months at a time. The reason why this is done is so that these companies can offer the product year round. Bacteria and other pathogens will not grow in sugar, so they're able to pile on crop after crop of fruit without a loss. So don't think there is no sugar in this recipe. There is some.

Excellent. The kids don't want the ketchup from the store now. Without the apple juice it would make a great bloody mary mix too!

Great sugar-free alternative.  Super flavor.  I made one batch, tasted it and then made two more batches!  I'm also avoiding salt and it has lots of flavor without the salt.

We ran out of ketchup and decided to try this. First of all this makes only about 3C, not 4C. I had to keep adding vinegar to get to he desired taste, probably about 1/8 -1/4C. Next time I will double the seasonings. Works O.K. for a substitute, but I will keep working on this to get the right flavors. I found one to try: Chef John's Homemade Ketchup here on this site.

It's easy and tastes great. Not Heinz, but you can't really expect that out of a homemade ketchup. I love that it doesn't have corn syrup in it, as I am trying to get away from so much corn syrup in our food (hence the homemade ketchup.) Thank you for this recipe!

Prepared it as per the recipe; tasted before putting it in the frig for 4 hours.  So very good, we can't wait to taste again after it has been sitting for 4 hours.  First thought it tasted like pizza sauce or spagetti sauce but the after flavor was ketchup. I think this is a winner for our house.  Also love the fact that it uses apple juice, just make sure your apple juice has no added sugar.

I highly recommend this recipe as a "base" recipe for your ketchup. Does not really require tweaking as far as taste. I did add a little extra liquid (vinegar and water) to reach my desired consistency. Start off with suggested ingredients then as as desired. I did add a bit more onion.  My family loved this ketchup!! I will be making it again, possibly adding a bit of jalepeno for a kick!

Make it just the way it says... It is delicious! I didn't have allspice, so looked it up to make it myself. Turns out it's equal parts cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove spices. Added it, and man, it made a difference.

You know, pretty darn good as homemade ketchups go.  I have tried several recipes that my kids just don't like.  This one has no raw garlic and no cooking and my kids will tolerate it.  So that is saying a lot!  I used stevia instead of apple juice concentrate (to taste.)  That is just the go-to sugar at our house.

R. Holland, knows what he/she is doing. This looks and taste like my grandmothers old time Ketchup recipe. I am a professional Pitmaster BBQ competition cook. I will use this Ketchup in my next event. 

Thanks!

I halved the recipe but kept the seasonings the same. I didn't have apple juice concentrate, so I started with a tbsp of honey and added more to taste. I was careful not to add too much water (since I could add more later) and I used about a tsp more vinegar than called for (apple cider vinegar instead of white). I'm going to use some of this to make cocktail sauce and I can already tell the taste is right on for it. Thanks for the great recipe!

This tastes great!  I omitted the salt and used dried chopped onion (Kirkland brand), as I didn't have onion powder. The Thyme I used was not ground, and just said "Thyme" on the label. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I won't be buying catsup again. This also could be varied by adding a little dill or dill pickle juice, and other flavors as desired.

Didn't like the apple juice aftertaste at all. Second time I substituted V8 juice and a dash of lime and Worcestershire sauce and the result was really good.

Easy, fast and tastes pretty good with a change in spice Add garlic powder, onion powder, salt, cayenne, celery, allspice, tiniest bit of clove.

Very Good. I needed a large amount of ketchup for a recipe and used this. Worked out perfectly. Thanks

It was definitely quick and easy, however I feel the taste needed adjusting. :)
Instead of using concentrated juice, I used 100% fresh pineapple juice. It made a HUGE difference. I also added a few extra spices. :) I ended up canning two half pints in a hot water bath & still had some ketchup left over. :)
