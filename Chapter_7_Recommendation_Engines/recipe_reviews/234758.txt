Simple and easy to make with ingredients I almost always have on hand. Basting with butter several times made it extremely moist. I used thyme instead of parsley and skipped the lemon.  I also used minced garlic rather than roasted garlic. I thought it had plenty of flavor. This will probably be my go to tilapia recipe now. Thanks!

Great recipe! Very quick and easy. Perfect for a quick healthy meal to whip up after work. I paired the fish with butternut squash risotto and Italian style peas.

Great recipe! I added some dill because I love dill with fish. I will be making this again. In addition, my hubby devoured his dinner tonight. I added this to my favorites.
