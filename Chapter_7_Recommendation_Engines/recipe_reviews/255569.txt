There is a lot going on in this recipe and you will need to plan on a lot more than 30 minutes prep. With that being said, I made exactly as written with the exception of hazelnuts. My local grocery store doesn't carry them and we don't particularly like nuts in our salad so I just left them out. This recipe is really good. The coffee spice rub was amazing! Fennel is one of those things you either love or hate. In my opinion this would be just as good if you substituted baby spinach for the fennel if you do not care for fennel. Plan ahead and give this one a try!

I added baby spinach and substituted pine nuts for hazelnuts ( because my grocery store doesnâ€™t carry hazelnuts ). Salad was delicious as were the condiments and the dressing, however the hanger steak was over-seasoned from the rub. Salt, pepper, brown sugar and paprika would have been sufficient. The coffee flavor did come through but was overwhelmed by the other spices.
