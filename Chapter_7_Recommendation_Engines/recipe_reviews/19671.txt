This sauce was easy and tasty. The only change I made was to use half ketchup and half barbeque sauce for a little more flavor. I have used smokie links along with hot dogs too and they were also a big hit!

I made this sauce for a SuperBowl party and it was gone in 10 minutes. Even the kids enjoyed it. I also put in half the ketchup and used half barbeque sauce. It was easy to make and had a sweet/tangy taste. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing it.

I made this for an oscar party (OSCAR meyer wieners) and it was a big hit. I suggested making a different one this year and my friends objected... this one's a keeper.

So Easy! Can't mess it up. I have been using this recipe since it was registered on all recipes and never had any complaints. My kids & hubby love it I usually cook it up in a sauce pan triple the recipe and leave it in the crock with the cocktail wienies and they can't get enough of it. Thanks! (Sometimes I add more beer depending on my mood;

The sauce was tasty but it didn't stick very well to the hot dogs. My son still felt it necessary to use mustard. I will probably make it again though.

The sauce tasted fine on sliced smoke sausage. It is very sweet. I chose to cook the sausage right in the sauce instead of dipping it. I think it would be good in the crockpot especially if you want the sauce to cook down and be thicker. I might make again adding some extra spices or the half bbq sauce as suggested by some.

This sauce is a nice change from the usual ketchup and grape jelly. This has such a great flavor and works great in the crock pot to keep it warm throughout your party. One hint boil the cocktail wieners for a few minutes to warm them up right before you throw them into the warmer with the sauce.

This is my ideal recipe! Super easy and super tasty;) It is a little thin but that works for me. too thick and it would make the little smokies too sweet. I have the little smokies heating in a crock pot of it and can't resist sampling it frequently. May not have enough left by the time our guests arrive lol!
