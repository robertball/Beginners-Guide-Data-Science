Worked out very well, I was happy with it. Tasted delicious. Quick trick I learned for toasting the coconut flakes - in the microwave! I put 1/2 cup coconut in for 30 seconds at a time at half power, stirring each time until I was happy with it. I had a 7 oz bag of sweetened coconut flakes, so I used the rest in the batter and the frosting. Since I was adding additional coconut, I halved the amount of extract in the frosting, and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

For some reason the cake fell apart. But the taste was good.

I made this and it was oh so yummy! I followed the cake recipe but next time I'm going to add baking soda to fluff it up more or use cake flour. The frosting was tasty as it was but too buttery for me so I added an 8 oz package of cream cheese and it made it fluffier and just tastes better. Highly recommended but I would make some slight changes.

My 10-year old grandson baked the cake.  Directions were easy for him to follow for the cake.   The cake is Delicious.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

The photo of the cake shows three layers, but the recipe only makes 2 layers??
