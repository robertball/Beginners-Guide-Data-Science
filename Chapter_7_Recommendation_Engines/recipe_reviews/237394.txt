Pretty tasty recipe! However I spent two hours making it as directed. Yikes! Flavor was good, loved the eggplant especially! I did not buy 3 as recipe called for, but 1 large, which was the perfect amount.  The eggplant took the longest, cause even in my large fry pan I could only cook 4 slices at a time. Only two issues with recipe. 1) the eggplant absolutely soak up any Olive oil brushed on and therefore didn't cook properly. At first I added Olive oil to pan, but given all the slices it would have used a lot. So I opted to use cooking spray when I flipped them, as well as before adding a new slice to pan- this worked well.  2) in my opinion, and my family's needed more sauce. I suspected such so I made a pan sauce loosely on the ingredients for the sauce for casserole (I added chicken broth, a tad chicken granules and more tomato paste and herbs). Served in bowl at table for people to add if they wished. Glad I made it! Overall delicious! I will likely make again but perhaps streamline steps better. (Oh and I removed foil last 10 min of cooking).

Delicious and the eggplant was really special - although like Lindsay I only used one eggplant and I feel like I could have skipped pre-cooking it - and maybe the chicken as well. I also swapped out the pasta for barley, which made a very tasty and healthy substitution (added extra water at the bottom of the casserole for the barley to soak up). Definitely plan on making this again, but would probably skip some of the pre-prep.
