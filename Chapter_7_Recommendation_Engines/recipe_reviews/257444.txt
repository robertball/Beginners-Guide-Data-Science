I love this application for rich sweet summer watermelon.  The recipe calls for a little more sugar than we liked so we cut it back to about 1 T.  I didn't really understand the inclusion of vodka so I left it out and doubled the orange liqueur.  Sipping on these on the back deck while the grill is heating up may be the epitome of a summer evening.

3.19.17  Had some watermelon to use up, so I mixed up my first watermelon margarita.  It was the perfect sidekick to a Sunday evening barbecue.

tired it but it just didn't taste right. Too much alcohol to watermelon.
