This is the best spice cake I have ever tasted! It was everything a spice cake should be and more. It was moist, tender, sweet, and had the perfect amount of spice. The maple cream cheese frosting is wonderful too and goes nice with the cake.

I did not make the cake but did use the frosting recipe.  It's very good but watch out for the amount of confectioners sugar that you use.  I used a half a cup less than the recipe stated and it was still just a tad too sweet for me.  Start testing it after two cups to get the sweetness level you prefer.

Excellent cake, very moist and dense.  The only thing I would change is to use less confectioner's sugar in the icing; it was quite sweet.  I sprinkled chopped walnuts over the entire cake to finish it off.

I must have done something wrong - my cake turned out very dry.  The icing was outstanding, however!

I cut this recipe out of a magazine ages ago, and finally decided to serve it on Thanksgiving. I made the cakes ahead of time and froze them until Thanksgiving. They were just a tad dry, so watch your baking time! The frosting is amazing!! My husband would eat just a bowl of this frosting if I let him. Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner RAVED about this cake, it really is delicious. Next time I would put the cake together a day ahead of when I was going to serve it, so the icing gets into the cake more. I also covered the top of the cake with pecan pieces.

This cake won 2nd place in my company's pumpkin cooking contest (The judging must have been fixed b/c it definately deserved 1st place!) The maple frosting really adds a lot to what would otherwise be just your average spice cake. Yum!
