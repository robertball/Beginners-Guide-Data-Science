I was actually surprised that these were so good.  Some of the reviews were less than stellar but I liked how easy it was so I tried it.  Followed the recipe pretty closely, except I found that I was out of honey so I used pancake syrup (imagine that!) and it worked out just fine.  I was going to double the gravy but that turned out not to be needed; there was plenty.  I may have added about 5 minutes to the cooking time to make sure the chops were cooked through. Very good and used ingredients I usually have on hand.  Thanks!!...10/15/08 an update:  I have to take back what I said about there being plenty of gravy.  The last two times I made this I doubled the gravy.  It's so good that my son smothers everything on his plate with it! ....Okay, one last update....I promise!: I make this about once a week now (usually with the original honey instead of the syrup I substituted once)) and have been adding just a few drops of Gravy Master to the gravy....looks more appetizing that way.

tried this and loved it---my husband usually only likes his pork chops crispy fried, so I thought this may end up to soft for him -- but after I fried the chops and let them simmer they still had a good "fried" coating.

Well, I don't know what I did wrong but this didn't even make it to the table. The gravy was truly horrible - unpleasant taste, looked awful, and it had a gluey sticky texture. Not recommended. Sorry.

I think that the gravy for this dish,was very unappetizing. I would not recommend this much at all.

This recipe was great.  We used lemon pepper and california style garlic salt instead of seasoned salt and pepper.  We doubled the gravy as well.  This also went great with garlic mashed potatoes with the gravy.  If you prefer wine with your meal, we had Beringer's Chardonney.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe closely with the following exceptions: I used soy milk instead of milk(we do not drink milk) and I used the leftover flour from  dredging the pork which amounted to only about a half tablespoon.  The combo of lemon and honey which sounds "different" was very tasty.  I will definitely make it again.

We really enjoyed this, and will make again for sure.  Quick and painless, but tasty.  I simmered about twice as long on very low heat and it came out a bit better I felt than the first time.

This has become a family favorite. From my brother who likes everything to my son who likes almost nothing. I find that I like to double the sauce to dress up the side dishes.

Wonderful and tasty. I omitted the lemon as I am allergic to citrus, but it was still fantastic with out it. Simmered the chops for 40 minutes on low to make sure they were tender. Turned out fab! Thanks for a great recipe!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the instructions but substitubes Penzey's Steak Seasoning for the salt and pepper and let it simmer for about a half hour while my potatoes finished cooking.

This was a little rich, but really good. I added garlic powder and steak seasoning to my pork chops.

Very yummy, used the left over drippings in the pan to make more gravy though with beef stock/broth. It came out wonderfully.

Very tasty. I just made a few alterations. Instead of honey I used agave syrup. I added freshly minced garlic and fresh cut mushrooms and doubled the sauce. I served with fresh broccoli and pasta. I mixed the extra sauce with the pasta. Delicious :)

I made this just as it was with the exception of cooking it a little longer.  We thought it was very good.  A quick, tasty meal.  Served with mashed potatoes as suggested.  Wouldn't change a thing except the cooking time.  Thanks for the great recipe that didn't involve cans of soup!

You will not regret trying this recipe out.  I always follow a recipe to the tee the first time I make it to give a true evaluation- this requires NO changes.  It is really just perfect as is, I have made it 3 times in the past 4 weeks or so and the last time I used boneless chicken breast which was also really good.  I have served it each time with whipped potatoes and a vegetable, either fresh corn on the cob, fresh green beans or a frozen medley of peas, corn, carrot, green beans.  They were all yummy especially if you double the sauce recipe so you can add some of the gravy to your potatoes.  My only preference when doubling the sauce recipe is to double each ingredient except for the honey.  I am so glad ANFMUSICGGL was gracious enough to share this recipe.  Great as leftovers too, just add a little chicken stock before putting it in the mircrowave for 1 ~ 2 minutes.  This is going into my dinner rotation for sure.  :=)

I thought this was pretty good for a quick and easy dinner. I did modify the recipie by adding about 3 tbs of Dijon mustard, 1/2 tbs of Worchesterchire, and some seasoning and about 1 cup of apple juice to the gravy mixture.

This was incredibly easy and quick. My kids loved it, which was surprising because they generally don't eat meat well at at all. The taste itself was a three, but because of the recipe's simplicity and use of common kitchen ingredients, it was easily a 4.

I was a little iffy when my boyfriend said he wanted pork chops for Valentine's Day, but I went along with it and dug around for days before finding this recipe.  SOOO glad I ignored the negative reviews!!!  I made it almost completely according to direction (added fresh minced garlic to the butter), and even after he missed his train and I had to refrigerate and reheat, the chops were excellent.  I served with mashed potatoes and sweet corn, and we were beyond happy with our Valentine's meal.  In fact, I'm so pleased that I'm making a larger dose for a family dinner tonight!

this was a very easy meal but I doubled the gravy and i only added a dash of lemon juice and honey the second time around, i also added a 1/4 th cup water 1/2 way through cooking to dilute it a little. I seasoned the meat prior to flour and then after also it was pretty good the second time around !!

My husband, the pork chop lover gave this a solid four stars.  I doubled the recipe, but used one tablespoon of sugar total (about a 1/4 of the sweetness called for as sugar is half as sweet as honey).  As I put the sauce in the pan it imediatly became too thick, not giving the chops time to cook through, so I added another 1/4 cup of milk thinned with a 1/4 of water, a half cup of liquid in all.  Sauce turned out great, thick enough by the time the chops were done.

Like another reviewer, I too glazed the pan after the initial browning of the chops. I used Vermouth, white wine would be another good alternative. I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning. The final presentation was garnished with a generous sprinkling of fresh parsley- it was a hit with the entire family! Thanks for this "keeper!"

Family consensus was that it needed a bit of a 'Kick' - something more spicy is needed.  It's a little bland.  Perhaps a shot of hot sauce?

SO GOOD! The gravy is amazing! I do agree with others that you should at least double the gravy if you are wanting to us it for your potatoes. I am not a huge fan of pork chops and I absolutely loved this recipe. I didn't change a thing. I made quite a bit of chops and ran out of butter so I used olive oil instead and it was great. I am going to try someones suggestion and add mushrooms next time, even though it was amazing without.

This was so-so.  My husband didn't like the taste of the lemon juice in the gravy said it was to tangy.  I did double the gravy so if you do the same I would only use the 1tsp of lemon juice and not 2.

So yummy. I've made this 4 times now because it is so good. It is definitely on our regular rotation! One time I was out of lemon juice so I did lime instead and it was sooo good, just for a variation!

I enjoyed this recipe, it has a very mild flavor and I followed it exactly but doubled it as I had 8 chops. Will definitely make it again.

Easy, tasty, ingredients are basic.  What more could you want? Was a hit with me as the cook and those who ate these pork chops for dinner too.  Worth trying.

We love this recipe. I add a little more honey and sour cream than the recipe originally calls for. Also, I use cajun seasoning on the chops before I cook them. The cajun spice is a nice contrast to the sweet honey in the sauce. However, serve immediately or the sauce will set up too much and take on a heavy texture.

I was a little nervous making this dish at first, but boy am I glad I did! It was absolutely delicious! My husband and I ate it all up!!! Next time I will make double the gravy though because it was so yummy!

This was so good!! I was kind of worried about the gravy when I saw what was in it but it looked simple enough to make and old saying is can't judge a book by it's cover! Everyone loved it I definitively agree with doubling the gravy. I doubled it and it was enough to keep it from being dry but not enough for the mashed potatoes....I'm going to triple it the next time! I WILL FOR SURE MAKE THIS AGAIN! A friend of mine that ate with us last night had a really good idea has well she said to add sauteed mushrooms in with gravy. Might just have to try that. I'm taking left overs to work with me! Thank You so much for sharing this recipe with everyone!

This recipe was good! I put 4 stars because it was not incredibly delicious. Although some comments say the gravy was too sweet, I, who do not like sweet taste very much, thought it was ok. I put a little bit more lemon juice though. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I will make this again!

This is a really great recipe for chops. This is a keeper. I am always looking for ways to make boring chops  not so boring. However I had to 4X the recipe to have enough gravy and the people who commented on the gravy being like gel. The problem is there is to much flour. I wanted real gravy so I 4X the recipe and used 1/2 the flour called for.Perfect.  Thanks!

Awesome, I did have to add more milk and butter to the pan, cooked on low for 40 mins covered. I aslo used montreal steak seasoning and lime in place of lemon(what I had on hand).

Excellent and quick for making a really tasty pork gravy. Nothing to change, I didnt' have any honey, so I used some homemade maple syrup. Perfect!

This reicipe is simple and good.  I used Montreal Steak Spice instead of the seasoned salt and pepper.  I let it simmer on low for a good 30 minutes so the meat is tender.  The sauce is really scrumtious and the kids loved it!  The next time I will definitely double the sauce since it is in such big demand!

This was a fast dinner to put together! It was on the table in less than 30 minutes from start to finish. Not caring for pork chops too much I was hesitant about buying them. Glad I did! They were very good. I made this per the recipe but next time I would definitely double, if not triple, the sauce. It didn't make much at all. Will make this again!

This was one of the first recipes I got off of this site and to be honest, looking at the gravy ingredients I was pretty skeptical. It actually sounds gross putting that stuff together but it came out great! Even my picky boyfriend likes it which suprised me. Next time I'm going to double the gravy and also try to make it a little thinner.

I never know what to do with porkchops, so I tried this recipe.  It was fabulous! And all the ingredients were in my kitchen.  I will definitely make this again.  I recommend making more gravy than the recipe calls for, so you can put it over rice on the side.  So yummy!

This is a very good and very easy meal.  It needs a little more flavor but other than that it is wonderful.  I ended up doubling the gravy recipe but I also had very thick pork chops.  I definately recommend this recipe and don't let the low rating discourage you.

I'm giving this 4 stars even though husband decided he didn't like it after a few bites; he did say that he wasn't very hungry and I could try it on him again.  I thought it was quite good.  I was a little concerned about the honey, but the sweetness wasn't overpowering.  I thought I had burned the butter before I added the gravy, but it all came out a lovely rich brown color.  I made the recipe as written, and will make again.

WOW! This is so delicious! My family loved it. My variation for the gravy is as follows:   3 tbs. sour cream  3/4 cup milk 2 tsp. lemon juice 1 tbs. plus 1 tsp honey 2 tbs. all-purpose flour and 1/2 to 3/4 cup hot water   this takes the bitterness of the honey down a small notch and thins the gravy to pourable proportions. I followed the rest of the recipe as is and we will have this alot! A very different alternative to fried pork chops. YUM!!! Thanks sooo much!

Another great recipe!!  So easy and quick to make.  I doubled the sauce and added sauteed mushrooms (thanks to other reviews).  I have been using the 'ingredients search' because my daughter is a vegetarian and my son is allergic to dairy.  I have been taking turns making special meals for everyone!  Hubby says this is a keeper. Tomorrows task... find a receipe we can all eat!

I made this twice and it was a hit. I seasoned the chops with a light mixture salt, pepper, thyme, sage, curry and paprika and it made all the difference.  I just wish I could get a bit more gravy out of it.

These were delicious and I will definitely make again.  I substituted 3 tablespoons of cream cheese for the sour cream because I didn't have sour cream on hand.  In increased the milk over double to make the gravy and it was wonderful.  Hubby and I both finished them up. (I generally do not like meat and only take two or three bites...but with this recipe, I ate it all).  Gobble gobble.  Thanks for a nice new idea.

Made them again and they were again. Wonderful.  Thanks so very, very much this is a definitely keeper.  Simple but so good.

When I try new recipes I usually judge them by my husbands reaction.  He loved this one.  I thought it was good but not fabulous, hence the 4 stars.  Part of the secret is to purchase good chops (I used thick butterflied chops) and not to over cook (which I used to do until I bought a digital meat thermometer...every cook should have one).  Pork only needs to reach 160 degrees.  One other thing; I doubled the gravy recipe and I'm glad I did because otherwise I wouldn't have had enough.

The pork chops came out very tender. I had to cook longer than 15 minutes since they were still really pink.  The sauce is great and very different than the traditional cream of mushroom ones. I will definately make again.

The gravy was too sweet and thick, had to quickly thin it down.  Other than that, this made for a tasty meal.  Next time I will omit the honey and increase the amount of milk.  Will probably double the amount of gravy called for as well.

Well, this was ok. The chops themselves were juicy, but the flavor wasn't very strong - it's probably because the "gravy" basically solidified in the pan. Once I noticed, I added a touch more milk and mixed it in. I ate the gravy (kept it on the side) and the flavor was wonderful! I couldn't believe it. I'm not sure what I did wrong. If I try this again I will probably double the sauce. If you try it,at least taste it and see what you think.

The chops were tender and moist, and the sauce/gravy was a perfect complement to the pork. I don't think it made enough gravy if you wanted to serve w/mashed potatoes, though, so would double or even triple it.  If all you want is to gravy the meat, this makes more than enough. :) I think the best part of this recipe is the gravy, and will be using it only for that in the future as I prefer grilling or frying my chops :)

My family thought this was delicious!! It was very easy and quick to make.  I did not have lemon juice so I left that out...and I added a little more milk once in the skillet just to keep the gravy from getting to thick...but other than this I followed the recipe exactly.  No doubt that I will be making this again!

A new family favorite. I served this with cheesy potatoes and green beans. I added more milk and let it cook down for more gravy. Very quick and super easy! I might try this with low fat sour cream too, and I did use skim milk and it tasted as rich as whole fat. Great!

This is the first 2 star rating I have ever given.  I will not be making this again.  The gravy was too sweet, (should have guessed that with honey being an ingrediant) and the dish looked totally unappetizing.  I was not a fan, sorry.

This was great!  I used the pork cubed steak and it was sooo tender!  I guess it was the cooking in butter part, but it even smelled awesome before the sauce was even put on it!  Husband loved it!

Really liked this!! The only differences I did was used maple syrup (no honey on hand) and started the sauce with 1/4 cup milk but added another 1/4 cup while simmering, as the sauce started to get thick.  It was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!

The pork chops were very tender and juicy. Everybody loved this - even my six year old! I will be recommending this to everyone at work but with a little less flour in the gravy mix because it was a bit too thick.

Very good! Doubled the gravy, omitted the honey (thought it was a little too sweet the first time) and seasoned pork chops with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and seasoned salt. Quick and easy!

Great!  My husband and kids loved it.  I have to cook for 9 people everyday.  I like to find recipes that are simple and fast.  I always have to triple of quadruple the recipes that I use.  I did add a dash of crushed red pepper flakes and some onion.  It was very tasty.  I served it with mashed potatos and used the gravy from the meat.

I found this to be really good. The only changes I made were to the spices to season the pork chops. Although the next time I will double the gravey amount and will try doing it in the slow cooker to hopefully get a more tender pork chop

I have made this dish 3-4 times before this evening.  It has always been good, and my rating is based on the recipe as written.  As others have suggested, I also recommend at least doubling the sauce.  When I made it tonight, I did a couple things differently.  First of all, I generously seasoned both sides of the chop with season salt.  On one side I also seasoned with black pepper, then on the other I seasoned with ground chipotle pepper.  It gave the dish a subtle little kick.  I added a little season salt to the sauce too.  Next, I used chicken stock to deglaze the pan.  I also added some throughout the simmering to keep the sauce from getting too thick.  This was easily the best version of this dish I've made to date.

I just made this (and am eating it now) and it didn't really quite work as planned. I think partially because I used an old pan that got too hot, so the gravy turned out to be more like a sauce. I didn't have lemon so I just added more peppery seasonings (the pre-blended kind) and then a bit of dijon mustard to give it a zing. It kind of turned out to be an odd egg-free hollandaise-like sauce. It does taste good, and I think with some more adjusting and planning it could be rated higher. Goes great with steamed broccoli!

Would make again.  I covered it when it was simmering.  Served with peas and french fries.  Young kids ate it and liked it.

This was so easy and very good - flavorful and moist!  I did have trouble with the sauce.  It got too thick and was sticking to the pan instead of the chops.  I think my pan was too hot.  I added a little water and covered it.  That did the trick!  My family loved it!

VERY EASY TO MAKE!!    i was skeptical of this recipe but when i made it, it was actually very good. slightly sweet and very creamy. however i added a sweet onion the next time i tried it and it gave it a pleasant flavor with the chops.

This was really good! Next time I'm going to make a little more gravy to for the mashed potatoes. I would recomend cutting back on the lemon juice a little if you make the amount of gravy in the recipe. It was a little too lemony for me. When I double the amount of gravy I make next time, I'm not going to double the lemon juice.

Since discovering this recipe a few months ago it's become a staple for our family.  In doing it several ways I have discovered that I could substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream but I prefer sour cream.   I also prefer fresh lemon juice to prepared.  I don't find the honey at all overpowering but I have used less and its' good that way too. I love how simple this meal is to put together for my family on a week night.   I have served it with rice pilaf as well as mashed potatoes.

They honey completly over powered everything. The only thing you could taste in the gravy was the honey. Sweet gravy on a pork chop is not a good combo. I scraped off the gravy and made a plain white gravy and saved dinner. I won't be making this again.

Sorry, the gravy did not work for me at all. I cut down the recipe for 2 and maybe that's why it didn't come out right. But I followed the recipe exactly as it read and it just was awful. The gravy didn't cook through well, the flavor was weird and I almost threw it all out, but I managed to wipe off all the gravy off the pork chop (I hate throwing food out).

Great Gravy!...if you like honey.  The gravy is sweet, which is not your typical taste of gravy.  I doubled the gravy and it was plenty.  My family liked it and we will make it again.

Very yummy!!! We all loved the sauce. All I did differently when preparing this was to add 1 TBS of Olive Oil to the butter in the pan so as to not burn the butter. I also did not add the season salt as I am not a big fan. Just salt and I was good to go. My two year old licked the spoon clean. :)

very easy to make.  pork chops came out perfect.  however, if you are sensitive to texture you probably will not like this. the gravy was a bit thick and on the slimy side.  if you can get past that, it tastes good.

I'm giving this four stars because two of my children weren't impressed, but three of us were. It was pretty easy, but I used pancake syrup like another reviewer instead of honey. I may make again with the honey to see if it makes any difference. I also did let it simmer for 30 minutes instead of the allotted time. Thanks for posting!

This was so good!  I doubled the gravy and had to add milk while it was cooking.  I didn't have any lemon juice, but I had lime pepper.  It was fine.  I'm making this again tonight, but substituting venison round steak.  My picky-picky husband says this one is a keeper!

The pork chops had a lot of flavor, but by the time I was done cooking, the gravy was extremely thick.  Next time I will make adjustments to thin the gravy.  Other than that it was great!

I thought the gravy was too sweet. But overall, kinda liked this recipe. Will try it again, omit the honey, and double the recipe to make more gravy. Did fry it, but next time must bake, as we are trying to eliminate fried foods in our diet.

I don't know what happened but this gravy was far from delicious. It's sour cream, milk, flour, lemon juice and honey. How good can it be? Oh well. Won't be making this again. Thanks anyhow.

Double the gravy and this is the easiest and most delicious meal I can make.  Husband requests a few times a week.

I used Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb Blend and did not add salt.  This came out a little sweet, I think next time I would reduce the honey to half a tablespoon.  Chops came out very tender.  Served with rice and green beans for a nice, easy meal.

Very Good and super easy!  I made this just because I had all the ingredients and my family devoured it!  I doubled the gravy and subst. real maple syrup for the honey.  I also seasoned the chops with lemon pepper and lawrys.  This is a keeper!

I originally tried this just because I had all the ingredients and it sounded fast and easy. It also turned out to be really yummy! After I had the chops started I realized I didn't have any more honey, so I substituted pure maple syrup and it still came out great. Just make sure you season the chops liberally.

Definately give this one a try, I am always looking for new ways to do pork chops and this one is a keeper! The chops come out really tender and the sauce (I think its more saucy then gravy, but maybe I did something wrong) is so yummy.  I served these with green beans, sauteed apples from this site, and red potatos, for a very comforting meal.

I was a little hesitant to make this due to the "not quite a 4 star" rating, but figured I would go for it anyway. It was actually very good! It was easy to make and all I had to buy was the meat and more sour cream. My pork chops came out a little tough (I'm sure this was my fault) and even though I doubled the gravy recipe we still wished there was more! Overall it turned out to be a great dinner with garlic mashed potatoes and sauted asparagus. I will likely make this again.

This was good, but it just wasn't a favorite for our family.  I took others advice to double the sauce which I'm so glad we did.  But we prefer more spicy versus the sweet and sour this gravy offered.  Glad I tried it though.

I just made this, it was so easy and had a great taste  definitely will make again. MASH and Green beans went well. I followed the recipe to a T for the gravy but only used two large pork chops. cooking time needed longer than 10mins about a good 15min. I used garlic salt and pepper to dredge then added the rest of the flour to the sour cream mixture. 
Good recipe.

my family absolutely loved these pork chops. The sour cream and lemon that are part of the gravy really give it a nice tang and make the pork chops tender.

Wow! Really good. I was searching for a quick way to make pork chops with ingredients I already had, and this one fit the bill. The only change I made was to omit the honey and add some onion. I was surprised with the result and I'm definitely going to keep this recipe around.

My husband and I thought this was delicious, and he doesn't even like gravy.  I did have to alter it, with the ingredients I had on hand.  Instead of sour cream I used cream cheese with chives (I softened it in the microwave).  I also rubbed onion and garlic poweder, salt and pepper in the chops before dredging in flour.  I also added parsley to the gravy to give more color and I used pancake syrup instead of honey since I didn't have any on hand.  This was fantastic, great over garlic mashed potatoes and served with green beans.  Will definately be making again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good.  My family loved the gravy.  Some minor tweaks: I doubled the recipe (as I read the recipe initially I knew it wouldn't make enough gravy).  I also added some beef stock and minced garlic.  The pork chops were tender and flavorful.  Served over mashed potatoes and noodles.  YUMMY!!

This is so tasty. Everyone loved it so much when my husband made it, I decided to make it for my parents. For some reason my gravy got too thick and was really pretty blobby. I need to take lessons from my hubby!

I had high hopes but it didn't turn out well at all. The gravy was not appealing or good tasting and I won't make it again.
