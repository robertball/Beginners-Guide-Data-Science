This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  There was nothing left over.  However, I did make a few changes.  Instead of using ham, I boiled 3 chicken breasts in chicken broth and Adolbo Seasoning with cumin.  Then I shredded the chicken instead of chopped.  I also used 2 cans cream of chicken & mushroom soup and added the adolbo seasoning to the soup mixture.  I also used a bundle of asparagus instead of 1 cup.  I found that I needed to double the crepe mixture and instead of using oil for the crepes, I found that spraying the skillet with a non-stick spray before each crepe worked a lot better.  I also found that lifting the pan from the heat before pouring the batter worked better.  Thanks for this recipe.  I'll be making this quite frequently.

THIS WAS GREAT!!!!! My husband likes very plain food.  When I put this on the table he said "Kentucky Fried Chicken would be better".  Then, after trying it, he thought it was excellent.  The last step of putting cream and mayo on top and then broiling sounded different but believe me, it made it wonderful.  The only thing I changed was that after filling the crepes I put the fold on top so nothing would run out the bottom - it turned out perfect.

I made this recipe for the first time the other night.  I was worried about making the crepe since I never did it before.  After the firs two, I got the hang of it by watching the edges.  When they started to lightly brown and lift away from the pan, it was time to flip.  I was using a nonstick skillet and cooking spray.  I thought the crepes would be a little heavy but they weren't.  They made a very nice meal that everyone enjoyed.  I will definitely make this again.

These are fabulous!  I modified the recipe a bit though by omitting the ham, and also the mayo/cream topping (too many calories in that).  I added 1/4 c. low fat sour cream to the soup mix and also added ground black pepper.
Other than that I followed the recipe.  The crepes were fabulous and very easy, and the finished product was wonderful.  Will absolutely be making this again.

This wasn't great - very rich and tasted like the canned soup.  Thanks though.

For the love of all that is holy. The wife and kids devoured the entire pan while i was at work. Glad i made myself a small pan for the next night. It was crazy awsome delicious.

I really liked this one!  This as my first experience making crepes and they turned out perfect.  I don't even have a crepe pan!  I thought the cream/mayo topping sounded weird, but it was wonderful.  I've made these with bacon and ham and I like it both ways.  Thanks!

I was terrified to make crepes, but it turned out to be relatively easy!  (I watched the how-to video on this site first; very helpful!)  This dinner was light, yet filling, and delicious.  I doubled the sauce, as other suggested, but don't know if it was really necessary.  I will make this again for sure!

Fantastic.  Loved everything about this recipe and will be making it often.  I've made it twice so far - once with ham and once with just the chicken and asparagus - both are delicious.  Many thanks for a great crepe recipe.

I thought this was a tasty meal.  The crepes turned out wonderful.  I followed this recipe as written, next time I will saute the asparagus first to soften them slightly (it was more crunchy then I would like) and be sure to used fresh chicken (I had used canned).

These were delicious. I doubled my chicken and soup mixture and left everything else as is and my family loved them. The crepes were very easy to make and held up perfect. This is a new meal we will all enjoy for a long time.

These have been a huge hit every time I've made them I omit the chicken and the mayo and just top with a little of the condensed soup and a sprinkle of Parmesan

Followed directions exactly, but I left out the ham since we didn't have any on hand.  Delicious!!! My husband and I both loved this dish.

Tastes pretty good - but too much fat and not so healthy for my taste.  Will need to use some lower fat substitutes next time.

I think this recipe was very good but I honestly don't think I will be making it again. It seemed very heavy and we tend to eat a lot lighter... good flavors but one crepe per person with a salad on the side will be plenty

These are pretty much... enchiladas. Which if you're into, you will love these. But if you're expecting delicious French food or a European delight, these are not them. The simple crepe recipe was fantastic, though!! Crepes in general are the best. But I probably won't make this again... sorry recipe inventor! My boyfriend enjoyed them. But I'm sure he would've loved several things much more than this.. (made for his b.day, so was esp disappointed, I was just expecting different, not enchiladas.)

I subbed the asparagus with broccoli that I had on hand and was able to make 5 crepes out of this batter.  A lot of prepping involved but I prepped the filling and batter mix ahead of time until it was time to make the crepes and roll everything together.  I made this for my bf's bday and he LOVED it!  The cream topping is good, but quite unhealthy and I only ended up using 3/4 of it...this part I think would be up to you on how much you want to use.

My mom makes a version of these and I thought I would try to make these myself. This recipe looked similar so I thought I would try it.   They weren't nearly as good as the ones my mom makes, I'll be following her recipe next time.   My husband said he enjoyed it but he only ate one crepe.

Hint... top with fresh cut basil. I really enjoyed these just the way they were but my husband topped his with fresh basil and they were unbelievable.  They did take some time to prepare but it wasn't too bad.  The crepe recipe was perfect.

I have made this recipe as written and it was wonderful. The second time I used broccoli instead of asparagus and mushrooms instead of ham because that is what I had in the fridge. My family really enjoyed both.

I loved this recipe, but my husband and son just thought it was okay. The nutmeg gives it such a yummy flavor. I subbed soft wheat for the all-purpose flour to make it a little healthier. They were still delicious. I also blended the crepe ingredients in the blender so there would be no lumps.

Here is a recipe to make if you want to impress those future in-laws or the boss!  It is gourmet quality, but,  easily assembled in your own kitchen.  I made it for Easter to rave reviews.  It is super rich & fattening, so, it will probably only be served for special occasions--but, boy, it will be worth the wait! :)

Really, REALLY good!!!!  I used the "Basic Crepes" recipe which is my go-to for crepes, and added a little extra salt and pepper.  Used fresh grated parmesan (and a tiny bit of gruyere I had left over).  Made the rest of the recipe as written but went light on the whipped cream/mayo combination.  Definitely saving this one!

There were a lot of steps and it shouldn't be considered the easiest meal to make, but the results are worth the effort.  There were some nice layers of flavor going on here.  It is essential to have the ham and I thought that the chicken, asparagus and ham combo was perfect!

Very tasty - omitted the asparagus for the kids.  Used cream of mushroom soup 'cause you can't get cream of chicken here.

This is delicious, even without the ham! We are not pork-eaters, so I just added some extra chicken and asparagus to make up for the lack of ham. I think next time, though, I will try it with some turkey bacon. Additionally, I used the basic crepe recipe from this website because you don't have to refrigerate before making the crepes. (I'm not a very patient person.) Also, adding sugar didn't sound good to me. I had plenty of chicken asparagus mixture and crepes to fill a 9x13 pan. I still used the same amount for the mayo/cream mixture and cheese. It was awesome!

This was great!  My husband said it was better than a favorite crepe dish at a local restaurant (very flattering).  Only changes I made were adding carmalized onions and using cream of mushroom soup (no cream of chicken on hand).  Fabulous!  Will definitely make again!

Yum yum! I made some changes though to accommodate what was in my cupboard. I used condensed cream of mushroom soup and sauteed the chicken with garlic, onions and red bell peppers. My husband was all praises!

Thanks for the recipe.

Tasted great! I accidently used the mayo as part of the filling, but caught myself half way, I used lowfat plain yogurt instead for the topping. Also, I was in a rush and didn't defrost chicken, so I made the crepes without chicken, turned out awesome. Thanks!

These were great and relatively easy. I made the crepes ahead of time and kept them in the fridge until ready to roll with filling. I used a can of condensed soup. Instead of mayo/heavy cream on top I whipped together 1/2 fat olive oil mayo with 10% cream. I only did a light sprinkling of parmesan just before broiling. I think I was able to save some calories and fat without compromising taste. This was my first time making crepes and definitely not the last. There were a couple of extra uncoiled crepes leftover that I will freeze for another meal.

This was delicious and easy (once the crepes were made).  The carnivores in my house ate the ham I had purchased so I just added extra chicken and asparagus. The asparagus was cooked perfectly and my children, as well as my husband, gobbled it up - no leftovers!! Will definitely make again. Probably make a ton of crepes and then freeze. Thanks for a great recipe!

The first time I made this, I made a double batch of the filling, and froze1/2 of it. Now I've cooked my second batch(freezes great!). This recipe is great. I followed it exactly and was very happy with the results. Very good combination of flavors. It is a little time consuming to make the crepes, but well worth the effort. Highly recommend...

Fairly easy to make, though the crêpes themselves take a long time to make one by one. We and our guests absolutely loved them! This recipe is a keeper.

Good, good, good. I used my own crepe recipe which was a little different, had no ham so skipped that but I LOVED this dish. I think I like the idea of shredded chicken in this and I love asparagus to I think I could have handled more than a cup. I will make this again for sure - and maybe add some artichokes.  I think you could play with this idea depending what you have on hand.

This was really good. It was my first time to make crepes and it was very easy. Hint - I used a 1/4 cup dry measuring cup not quite full to pour into the pan which is about 3 Tbsp. The recipe did not tell you how hot your pan should be. I put my stove on med. which is 5 on mine and they turned out perfect, even the first one.  I also Sautéed my asparagus a little before filling the crepes so they would not be too hard and they were not too soft, just perfect. I also doubled the sauce to make it creamer and dipped french bread in it and it was delish!! I can't wait to make crepes with fruit and cream soon. Great recipe!

The recipe for the crepes themselves didn't work for me.  It turned out too thin... it wouldn't stick to the crepe maker.  I thickened the crepe batter and then made the rest as laid forth.  Loved it!

Very well liked at my Mother's Day Brunch.  I think they could use a little more "spice".  Might add some season salt to chicken mixture next time.  I, too, was skeptical of the mayo/cream topping, but it browned up nicely.  Next time might try lite whipping cream instead to lighten up the calories.  Used Campbell's Healthy Request Crm. of Chic. soup and used a little more than asked for.  Good recipe for brunch.

These are fantastic!!  Loved them.  It was the first time I ever made crepes and they turned out fine using a regular old frying pan.  I have to admit I was nervous about making the crepes so I had some store bought crepes on hand just incase but I didn't need them.  Great recipe!

Not only did i substitute 2% milk in error, it wasn't obviously whipped since i failed to see that in the directions.  I usually follow a new recipe exactly but even though I didn't, and thought I was, this was excellent.

I'd give this 10 stars!!! To save time (as this takes a while when making for 16 people) I used rotisery chickens from the deli. Followed the recipe to a T.  I questioned the white sauce (cream and mayo) but this MADE the dish!!!!  I was so upset that there weren't left overs.  Even the kids (ages 5-14) went back for 2nds and 3rds.

These were very good however I found them to be very time consuming also. If you have time for all the chopping and cooking then you'll probably love them. I may make again if I have the hubby to help me :)

I made about 1-1/2 batch because of the quantities of ingredients I had on hand to use, though most of my measurements I fairly eyeballed anyway.  The only other modification I made was, since I didn't have any heavy cream on hand, I substituted 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 white wine.  The dish came out with a VERY strong flavor, not bad but somewhat overpowering, though this may or may not have had something to do with the substitution I made.  My husband and I liked it well enough, though I don't know if I would make it again.
