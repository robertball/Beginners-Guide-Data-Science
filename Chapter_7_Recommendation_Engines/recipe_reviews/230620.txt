I made this tonight and it was a hit. I did make one change, I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise as I abhor mayo (yes, my mother wondered where she went wrong ;). The substitution was delicious. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and needed only 30 minutes to cook (pound the thicker side to make a more evenly thick piece). 

I will definitely make this again.

It was super delicious. I made for my brother and myself and we both loved it, it was juicy and tenderly. I greased the baking dish with butter and then added the chicken. One more thing I only used chicken breast and it was awesome.. Thanks for the recipe.

Enjoyable, but really nothing outstanding.  Under-seasoned, but moist.  The parm on top worked well.  Won't make again, but made for a decent chicken dinner.

This recipe was simple, loved by the kids and is gluten free for my gluten free friends!
I added more garlic and I used this with boneless skinless breasts on a bed of rice.  (Just add uncooked rice and water in your baking pan).  The juices from the garlic, rosemary and mayo were then absorbed in the rice for a delicious side!

This was surprisingly good.  I was just looking for something easy, and it was.  Instead of fresh rosemary, I powdered some dried rosemary in the blender and put the garlic through a press.  I didn't apply the mayonnaise mixture too thickly, so it was not too rich.

This was great for a really quick and easy recipe. The only changes I made were adding a dash of thyme, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and I doubled the rosemary. Very tasty!

Made this for dinner tonite. It was tender, juicy, and flavored. I did put a tbl of horseradish in to add a little zing. It was great.

This may be the only recipe that I have ever put together that not one person in my family could stomach.  It was SO rich but had very little seasoning flavor. My husband ate his salad and didn't realize that I had not put salad dressing on it since there was so much grease on his plate.  I am sorry but this is just not the recipe for us.

I have made this twice now in as many weeks. My family loved it.
The only changes I made were using fat free mayo and cutting the amount of rosemary. Both necessary for dietary reasons.
This is so easy and so yummy.

Moist and yummy. I used parchment paper so the chicken wouldn't stick. It is rich but a nice richness you don't get with a bland chicken recipe like plain ole' baking. I also used cheddar as I didn't have any fresh parmesan and do not use store bought shake kind.

I just made this and had to comment.  I listened to everyone who said it's too bland and decided to really season it up.  4 ckn drumsticks, 2 crushed cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp sage, 1 TBSP crushed rosemary (I ground my own), 1/2 tsp marjoram.  1/2 to 3/4 C mayonnaise, Parmesan to taste.  Mix all but Parm in bowl, slather over chicken, then sprinkle Parm LIBERALLY over all.  Ensure the mayo mixture is thick on the chicken.  Cook in 350 oven for 1 hr 10 min.  If you're making more chicken than 4 drumsticks, adjust the mayo recipe. Awesome!

We made this using 8 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs. We also used 1.5 tsp dried rosemary instead of fresh. It came out absolutely delicious. We loved it so much we ate the leftovers for breakfast. It is so easy to make! Great recipe for LCHF diet.

Delicious. My husband and I really enjoyed it. Took very little time.  I followed directions but substituted Italian seasonings as I didn’t have rosemary.   Served it over leftover pasta.  I was in a hurry so baked at 400 for 15 min then at 375F. I like the way the parm cheese becomes crust like . Thank you

Made this for dinner last night.  Although I did make a few minor modifications.  I added bread crumbs for more of a crunch,  I also added dried oregano instead of what was in the original  recipe. I also baked it a bit longer to make it a bit more crunchy.  My family enjoyed it ?

Oh my goodness soooo delicious. Probably my favorite chicken dish I've made. Even my extremely picky son ate it without complaint. I used chicken breasts and ran out of parmesan so used about 2/3s the amount of parm and the rest subbed mozza. Everything else was as stated by the recipe. Will definitely be a staple in our house now.

I split the mayo with plain Greek yogurt. Liked the texture and it softened the mayo. Added old bay seasoning as well. Delicious and would make it again. Great low carb option to barbecue.

This might be the moistest baked chicken I've made. It is really good. I did not notice that it was too fat, but I make my own mayo using 100% olive oil. Might be different with commercial mayo. My coconut chicken always sees a little dry so  I used the same mayo base and made coconut chicken. It was the moistest coconut chicken ever. It will be my go-to recipe for baked chicken. Thank you for sharing.

I really liked this. I did try it with a low fat mayo, but that didn't work so I will go back to using the full fat mayo. I might even try chopping an onion into it next time.

This recipe has managed to float around my family for about two years now. My foster sister, my foster brother, and my daughter all make this  as a regular dish in their home. It’ Just a simple, and cost effective, dinner that everyone loves.

Great recipe. Five stars just because it’s so easy. I had boneless skinless chicken breasts, they were so moist with mayo topping. I can see this becoming a “company’s coming for dinner” item.

My roommate and I loved this.  Nice change from plain baked chicken.  Used all legs as I didn’t have a whole chicken and we like dark meat anyway.  This one is a keeper for us.  And it was easy.

I use this recipe when I make a large batch to use in other recipes calling for baked chicken since its so easy and delicious.  I used to just buy the rotisserie chickens.  $$$  what was I  thinking?!

So easy to make!  I saw the suggestion of greasing the baking dish with butter, so I tried it.  It’s was delicious, and my husband requested that I make it again. It’s comfort food when paired with the risotto, add a simple salad and you’ve got a hit!

I thought I would love this because I love mayo! But I was wrong. My husband loves it though so we are keeping. I am going to try with less mayo next time and see if it changes my mind.

I have now made this chicken recipe twice, with rave reviews from all who had it.  Please do not hate me, but I very seldom leave any recipe alone.  I read many recipes and then make my version of most things.  This one I tried to leave alone, but still tweaked a few things and added a few things that others had recommended.  First while my chicken was thawing I added Italian dressing to the bag.  I par cooked my rice (another reviewer suggested) before I added it to the pan.  I love my spices so of course I added more to the mayo.  Not the same both times, but things that caught my fancy besides the rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper.  Garlic pepper is a go to for me and several of the hotter spices.  Anyway, this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thank you so much.

I didn't make this exact one, but my mom has an even simpler recipe. We call it Parmesan chicken because mayo makes it sound gross. It's mayo, chicken, garlic powder and parm cheese. Way easy and cheap.

Great! The chicken was perfect. I excluded some of the spices because of picky eaters, but it tasted wonderful.

Made this, this week, and it was absolutely the best chicken I've ever had!  Even my husband who doesn't care for chicken, ate it for three days in a row, and told me I can make this "anytime"!

My children (all 6 of them) loved this! I have one daughter who gags at the sight of mayonnaise. However, I did not let anyone know mayo is in this and she absolutely loved it! To the point, she's asked me to make it this evening, which is what has brought me back to the recipe. :-)   UPDATE: Making this ahead of time and freezing for a meal while we're on vacation. Awesome dish!

I used one-third cup miracle whip and two-thirds mayonnaise. I only used about five pieces of rosemary,  and repaced with sage and cajun spice.   Yummy.  Seems like the leftover broth would be a good soup base.

Did not have rosemary and still turned out amazing. I too look for low carb options and this is a new go to for dinner.

This recipe was awesome! I used chicken leg quarters- skin removed. And I added some Cajun seasoning as well, to spice it up. The sauce is rich enough that I think it would do great with skinless breasts, and not come out dry.

Simple and delicious.  My fussy family loved it, including my gluten free eater.  I baked for only one hour and it was done to perfection.

Great starter recipe. I used my homemade season salt and Italian seasoning instead of the salt and rosemary. Also Parmesan/Romano mix. Gives it more flavor. Yum Yum

Since I'm vegetarian I made a mock version which turned out awesome. I used Beyond Meat for the chicken and Just Mayo for the mayo. Definitely delish and healthier! IG @ veglife875
