I made two small changes and that was cutting way back on the salt and I used fresh parmesan instead of the italian cheese blend, only because that was what I had on hand. We liked the flavor of these but found the breadcrumbs odd which made the dish unappealing. I'd like to make this recipe again, but omit the breadcrumbs, then re-review.

Very good recipe!  I would suggest par boiling
the green beans before adding to the mixture.
Maybe it was my beans but--they were a little
tough!

These were very tasty, but the breadcrumbs were a little strange to us. I may make this again, but will probably skip the breadcrumbs the next time.

This dish was very good.  I did not know what to expect at first  but it turned out very good.  My 7 year old daughter loved it so much, she kept asking for more.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing I cooked it for thanksgiving and for Christmas and my family and friends just loved it everyone was asking for the recipe. I just added a little more water cause I think it needs to cook longer for people that are not huge vegie eaters. My family preferred the green beans a little more softer.

Green beans with a vinegar taste.  My family thought these were ok.  They weren't crazy on the vinegar taste.  The beans had to cook longer than 10 minutes.  The bacon and the cheese were a nice touch.   Thanks Ranchgirl for sharing.

Good green beans.  I think I added a bit too much bacon, but that's okay.  Nice and savory, but a bit heavy so I'd try and serve with something light.  Or, just serve as the main dish.  It has protein in it, right?  These are pretty simple, easy, and quick.  thanks for the recipe!

I dont think the flavor of these beans is enough to warrant all the extra fat added to them. They were pretty good, but I think I'll opt for healthier next time.

This recipe was great, I did add more water and let the green beans cook longer than ten minutes. I like my beans on  the softer side. My family love it. I will make them again

There wasn't enough water to sufficiently cook the beans.  Added extra water, and then MORE water.  Took FAR longer than the 10 minutes the recipe stated in order to get beans sufficiently cooked.  (At 10 minutes, they were still very crunchy).  Vinegar caused an unpleasant taste.

I like the flavors, but its not near enough liquid to cook the beans... I would suggest par-boiling the beans before adding them to the mix or add more liquid so they get cooked... otherwise a good recipe

I thought the vinegar overpowered the dish.  Did not care for the taste.  Green beans took much longer than 10 minutes to cook.  May try again without vinegar?
