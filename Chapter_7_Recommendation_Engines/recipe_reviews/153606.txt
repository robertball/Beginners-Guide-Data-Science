This recipe was EASY and the most delicious pork carnitas I've ever tasted!  I started by browning the pork on the stove, as recommended, but then instead of simmering on the stove we popped it in the crock pot for 4 hours on high.  I didn't have Chipotle chili powder, so I just used a little extra regular chili powder. I also couldn't find pork shoulder so we used pork tenderloin instead (it was on sale!).  I used our small food processor to make the tomatillo sauce and it worked really well. We will definitely make this recipe again soon!

Due to all the reviews I'd seen so far, I halved this recipe. One half was made exactly as written - I'd give it a 3. It was delicious but not enough flavor for our family (referring to both the salsa and the meat.) The other half I tweaked to our liking. I'd rate that a 5 as there were no complaints, however, my rating here will reflect 'as is' :) After browning the meat as written, my changes were: we added more of each seasoning it called for (to taste) and finished the meat in our slow cooker. Instead of covering it in water, I used Herdez Pasilla sauce for extra flavor. We topped it with tomatoes, green onions, tomatillos, shredded cheddar cheese and a small squeeze of ranch dressing for the kids. So tender and great flavor!

My family loved the tender pork. I live at high altitude and the meat did take longer to cook then stated in the directions. I used 2 pounds of pork shoulder and removed the fat. I found some chipolte powder online and use it in a lot of Mexican dishes. My family loves carnitas with flour tortillas, so I prepared my own flour tortillas recipe and it was great. The tomatillo sauce was very mild, so my husband added onion, jalapeno peppers, garlic salt, and lime juice to give it a kick.

Delicious! The pork comes out moist, tender, and full of flavor - plus it was easy to make. I used pork tenderloin (on sale) and combined all the spices in a ziploc bag then tossed in the pork so it was evenly coated. After browning, I cooked it in the crock pot for 4 hours on high with a minimal amount of water. The last hour I tossed in the onion. The tomatillo salsa needed just a little more flavor so like others I added in some garlic, red onion, a pinch of salt and a little fresh lime juice. I served these over white corn tortillas that I warmed in the oven topped with salsa, avacado slices, sour cream and a splash of fresh lime. Great with a side of Spanish rice and a margarita on the rocks! Thanks for a great recipe Mazola!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was amazing!!! The salsa has such a vibrant taste, and the pork came out SO tender!!! Unless you want to wait longer to eat there is absolutely NO need to use a slow cooker!

SCRUMPTIOUS!!! I have to admit I was a little skeptical of this recipe, because this isn't really a traditional "carnitas" recipe where the meat is roasted/braised and then shredded.  Nobody messes with my carnitas! But I thought i'd give this a chance and am I ever glad I did! This is a lot quicker than making traditional carnitas and the meat is packed with flavor. Whatever you do, PLEASE make sure you buy pork shoulder (or boneless Country Style Ribs cut from pork shoulder).  This is a well-marbled cut of meat and the fat renders down and gives the meat such a tender, buttery flavor that can't be matched by leaner cuts like tenderloin or loin.  Very few ingredients are needed in this recipe. I made it exactly as is and can see myself making it over and over. I almost ate the whole thing to myself! You don't need anything else but the meat and the tomatillo salsa (it's not really a sauce!).

Five stars for the taste and ease of the carnitas, done in the slow cooker for 5 hours on low. I did, however, heed the warnings of the earlier reviews regarding the salsa. I roasted the tomitillos, added fresh garlic and kosher salt. The taste was fine, just didn't make enough as written. I suggest doubling the amounts for the salsa. Thank you Mazola, for the opportunity to work with corn oil and your recipe for carnitas.

I made this while my parents, brother and grandmother were visiting so I doubled the recipe and it was a big hit with everyone other than my picky little boys.  I was out of regular chili powder and I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids, so I just used a little more of the chipotle powder than called for in the recipe.  It did take about 45 minutes longer than stated in the recipe for it to thicken up.  The cilantro tomatillo sauce is definitely more like a pico.  It seemed a little bland to me, so I added the juice of one lime and some salt and pepper to taste and it was great.  I also fried the corn tortillas so that they were slightly crispy and added cheese and avocados to our carnitas and served with rice and black beans.  I will definitely be making this again!

We really enjoyed these. The meat was so tender and had just the right amount of heat for us. I didn't have chipotle chile powder and had a can of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce so I subbed that. Worked great. I served with shredded cheese and sour cream. Yum!

This was a little too hot for my tastes. However, it was quite easy to make and the overall flavor was pretty descent. I followed the meat recipe except I used pork tenderloin. That is what my grocery store had. I think cutting up the pork, was the most time consuming part. I thought I had the chipotle powder or something similar. When I realized that was not the case, I used 1 Tblsp. of minced chipotle peppers in adobe sauce. So, that may have contributed to the heat, not sure. I wanted so badly to tweak the topping by adding avocado, and avocado sauce, or some type of white spicy sauce, to give a creamy like topping to the tacos they needed In my opinion. I did like the flavor of the base salsa though. I don't typically make salsas or sauces with tomatillos. I suggest playing with the toppings, though, as almost anything can be added and would go nicely with the pork and tomatillo salsa.

I don't eat pork so I made this recipe using medium tofu and cooked in with oil like the pork, only for about 10 minutes instead of 30-45 minutes the meat requires. I followed the recipe exactly as written otherwise and the spices were spot on and flavored the tofu beautifully. This was very easy to throw together and was even light enough to make for a quick lunch. This is also a very budget friendly recipe! I rarely make Mexican style dishes since I live in the heart of San Diego but this is a recipe I will make over and over again!

My family really enjoyed this new take on taco night!  I chose not to cube the pork and placed it in my slow cooker on top of the sliced onions. I rubbed the pork with the oil and seasonings, and set it on low for 7 hours.  We just shredded our 2.5 pound pork shoulder, topped with the tomatillo sauce, and piled it in a corn tortilla. It was a quick dinner on the table!

This was a great place to start.  The sauce for the carnitas was complex and rich, with a deep chili flavor and a subtle heat.  I liked the cilantro tomatillo salsa, but I added a clove of minced fresh garlic and some sea salt.  I garnished my carnitas with sour cream and yummy avocado slices, but I wanted a bit of heat in the salsa.  I think it would benefit from the addition of some minced fresh jalapeno, to taste.  It has a fresh, tangy taste, but the combination could definitely use some heat in the salsa.

I've made these twice so far in one week-the seasoning is impeccable!  I imagine I will be making these on a weekly basis-thanks, Mazola.  The second time I made them I substituted pickled jalapenos for the tomatillos and shredded iceburg for the cilantro, only because that's what I had on hand.  I tossed the chopped tomatoes with the lettuce and peppers for a cold topping and added sour cream too to "cool" the spiceness of the pork.  Great recipe.

First, I was so skeptical about the cooking method I was sure I'd have to make something else, but it worked very well.  I had ordered chipotle powder specifically for this recipe, but they shipped me Pasilla powder.  I used it any way and it was very flavorful.  I was able to buy boneless loin of pork for a much better price than butt so I used that. My only issue was it took over two hours for the liquid to cook down.  But I will make carnitas this way again. I couldn't find fresh tomatillos here so I used salsa verde I had put up last fall and mixed it with a bit of sour cream to tone down the spiciness.  Thanks, Mazola, this is a nice recipe.

This was pretty good with my changes!
Cubed, seasoned and browned meat, put in SLOW COOKER with beef stock instead of water.
For the "Sauce", which is actually more like a pico, I thought it was a bit bland so I added minced garlic, sweet onion, lime, and a jalapeno pepper.
Wanted an actual sauce, so I made one from sour cream, drippings from the slow cooker, tomatillo, sweet onion, and a touch of taco sauce.
We found out we aren't a HUGE fan of corn tortillas, they HAVE to be warmed up!
All and all, this was pretty good. 4 Stars with my changes. I would add even more seasoning/elements next time. And flour tortillas instead.

Loved these! The guy's weren't big on the fresh tomatillo salsa, but I thought it was great with these. I also served them with chopped red onion, shredded cheddar and sour cream. The meat, which took longer for all of the liquid to cook off than was stated (which was fine), was moist, tender and very flavorful w/ a nice, spicy kick. We all agreed that these are a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

We thought this resulted in a wonderful dinner.  I made it just as directed, though it didn't say how to prepare the tortillas (I just heated them in a touch of oil).  I did add a little sour cream.  I started out with two pounds of pork shoulder butt, and by the time I cut off some of the fat and let it cook down, it was perfect for four servings.  Thanks, Mazola, for a different way of preparing carnitas.

I loved this recipe!  I used boneless country spareribs and cooked them in my pressure cooker.  I also made flour tortillas (family isn't crazy about corn tortillas).  This will be in the weeknight rotation!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The only substitution I made was to use pork steak as that is all that I had on hand and it turned out just as it should.  It was very nice to see a recipe that didn't involve cream of whatever, for once, as those are becoming increasingly rampant on this site

I made this while on vacation for my family and we all LOVED it!! The tomatillo salsa was a HIT. None of us had ever really tried tomatillos,much less made use of them at home. The carnitas were so juicy and flavorful! We added some homemade guacamole but really would not have missed it because the salsa was so delightful! I will be making this again.

I used pork loin chops sliced thin like fajita strips.  This cut down cooking time quite a bit.  I didn't have tomatillos, so we used all tomatoes with a specialty taco sauce I had on hand. We also used whole wheat flour tortillas because that is what we had. We loved the flavor.

We really enjoyed these but I did add more seasoning and used a hotter chili powder. We liked how the flavor a melded together and the salsa have it a bright addition to the flavor.

Made this with a pork tenderloin in the slow cooker and it was delicious!  There was a nice amount of heat, but the cilantro tomatillo sauce offset that a bit.  I made it with the corn tortillas, but we thought it would have been better with flour tortillas instead.  We will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe.  I didn't use pork because we very rarely eat anything pork in our home unless it's bacon.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Since I had the corn oil that Mazola sent, I did use their oil.  However, I used about a teaspoon of Adobo along with the spices and added some cumin.  Squeezed some lime juice in the salsa and ate some sliced avocado - Oh, and I did use flour tortillas (homemade ones!) instead of corn since we are not fans of corn tortillas here (unless they are fried!).  I would definitely make this again.

Fantastic dish! Super easy and delicious to make. Giving it a four because I made this as the recipe dictated and would do a couple things different in the future. First, I would use flour tortillas. Even warmed, the corn tortillas were icky. Second, I think I will shred or smaller cube the pork so it might stretch further. The salsa was really good- first time eating tomatillos raw and not roasted first. Thanks, Mazola!

I am rating the pork only and not the tomatillo salsa.  The pork tastes fantastic.  To me the seasoning was just right.  Be sure to let it simmer long enough for the flavors to meld together.  I could not find decent tomatillos at the store so I just used a pico de gallo salsa.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved, loved , loved this recipe.  I am a huge fan of pork so enjoyed making and eating it.  Took a little longer to cook than stated but that might have been my fault in that I think that I used too much liquid.  End result was still great.

This recipe for the meat itself was totally worth 5 stars but since I did not get to make the salsa I only give it 4. I used a blend of verde, avocado, sour cream, and lime juice as my topping. Tomatillos was just not available here right now. The only other thing I changed was the chipotle powder and could not find any at the local stores. Instead I used smoked paprika and it worked out lovely! This will be made again may times over in this house! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was a hit.
I made a few changes, but nothing major. I couldn't find tomatillos, so I just used a jar of organic salsa verde for the topping.
I prepared the meat in my slow cooker with the Mazola Corn Oil and spices. I also shredded the meat instead of serving it cubed, just due to personal preference.
The spice blend was very good, I ended up adding a tad more chipotle spice to it after serving, just to give it more of a kick.
We really enjoyed this and I will make it again.

***UPDATE... I used the extra for an appetizer today! So good, just take tortilla chips, stack the shredded pork, diced fresh tomatoes or salsa and top with cheese....under the broiler til the cheese melts! Serve with sour cream! March 2014:Tasty! I made this in the slow cooker...so easy! These flavors all blended so nicely. Will make this again! Thank you, Mazola for this delicious recipe!

I made a slight change in the recipe by not adding the chipotle chili powder because I didn’t have any.  The pork was very tender and had fabulous flavor.  For me, it took a little longer to cook than mentioned in the recipe, but it was well worth the extra time.  The cilantro tomatillo sauce surprised me the most.  I never liked cilantro, but I have to say it was very easy to make and a delicious compliment to the pork. The next time I’ll use my homemade flour tortillas which I prefer to the corn tortillas.

I followed the recipe exactly, adding 1 cup water in step 2. The cooking times were perfect. This was my first experience eating pork carnitas and tomatillos, and I am happy to report that it was a positive experience. I added sour cream to mine, and my husband added haberno sauce to his.

As a SoCal native, this recipe was a taste of home for me!  Flavorful, juicy, with plenty of seasonings to make me go back for more.  LOVED the tomatillo salsa way more than I expected to (it paired so beautifully with the meat!), and when placed on top of homemade corn tortillas (from Allrecipes too!), it was seriously one of the best meals I've had in a while.  My husband told me that it "tasted like awesome," so I do believe this recipe's a keeper.  ;)

So easy and DELICIOUS!  I made this recipe exactly as stated, and have a few tips.  Be sure not to pour too much water in the pot during step 2--I may have used 1/3 cup at most.  The timing worked perfectly for me.  The liquid had evaporated enough after the 45 minutes to create well-coated but not soupy at all pork bites.  I liked the salsa (it's not really a true sauce), and served the carnitas with warm corn tortillas and lime.  They tasted very fresh because there aren't a lot of ingredients, and I appreciated that the salsa and pork could be made ahead of time, so all I had to do was warm the meat & tortillas, plate, and serve with a squirt of lime.  I'll make these again!

This was delicious. I had to cook the salsa as I cannot eat raw fruit and vegetables... otherwise followed the recipe. I added too much liquid.. so I took the pork out and  cooked the remainder down. Very tender pork.. mmmm

Both my husband and I thought this was a very good recipe, but, different than most pork carnitas we have had in the past.  The flavor profile reminded me more of what you get with shredded pork for tacos.   I don't know if I added too much water, but, the liquid did not cook down after the time listed in the recipe.  The pork was tender, so, I removed the pork to a bowl and covered with foil.  I then turned the sauce on high and reduced for about 20 minutes.  I then returned the pork back to the pot and simmered for about 10 minutes to heat through.  The texture and flavors were perfect.   The tomatillo sauce was not a big hit in my house.  We were not crazy about the texture of the raw tomatillo.  I made some with the salsa  as stated in the recipe and then made a second salsa with tomato, onion, cilantro, and some fresh lime juice.  I then made a sauce with sour cream and salsa verde.  We much preferred the salsa without the raw tomatillo.  Five stars for the pork, but, two for the salsa as listed in the recipe.

We thought this was ok. I would recommend adding onion, garlic, jalapeno (this dish really could use some spice), salt and pepper, and a little bit of lime. With that being said, I really liked the pork. I didn't have chipotle chili powder and wasn't going to go out just to buy that, so I did what other reviewers suggested and just added a little more regular chili powder. That portion of the recipe turned out great and will use that again! I made the recipe as is.

This recipe is a keeper.  I cut the pork in large cubes, then seasoned it and browned it on the stove.  Once browned, I moved the pork to the slow cooker.  Then I sautéed the onions in the pan, once starting to brown I added the water and brought it to a boil.  Stirring the bottom of the bottom to get all the flavor off and into the water, now broth.  Then pour over the meat in the slow cooker and let it do it's magic.

This was a pretty tasty dinner.  I didn't have chipotle chili powder so I used Ancho chili powder in it's place.  I did have to simmer the pork a little longer than stated but that was my preference as I wanted to be able to shred the pork.  As for the tomatillo salsa, we prefer the tomatillos cooked with a jalapeno and blended for more of a salsa verde.  (BTW - a can or jar of salsa verde is a good substitution if you can't find fresh tomatillos.) I served this with mexican rice and a side of pinto beans.

The pork carnitas I have made in the past were slow roasted, so I was concerned how these were going to turn out.  I really liked this recipe. My husband came home and raved about them.

The only changes I made - I added salt & pepper and a little lime juice.

Because of my family size, I double the recipe. I loved the meat, hands down and it was so tender and amazing I ended up cooking my meat a little longer because it was very soupy still. But the longer I cooked the meat, the tender-er the meat got and the liquid dissipated to where felt it should. I'm rating this on the meat only, because the raw tomatillo, tomato and cilantro was a turn off and no one would eat it. It was so bitter and can not be called a sauce. It was more like a pico de gallo but not a sauce. Because of that right there, it was a waste, chopping 4 whole tomatillos, I was forced to use what I chopped up and remaining tomatillos in a salsa verde sauce and top on the meat with Mexicana Crema. And the family loved that by far better then the raw tomatillos, tomatoes and cilantro. Won't be making that part again but totally will me making the meat. We loved the flavor of it and it only.

I used a pork tenderloin that I had on hand to make this.  I was a little nervous that it may come out tough cooking on the stove top but I was pleasantly surprised at how tender the meat was.  It had the right amount of spice that tasted great.

I followed the spices in recipe exactly however I would cut off some of the fat from the shoulder after I cubed it. A lot of fat rendered from it. When it was done I did stir in some more peppers and onions. We want more veggies in our life. Be sure to heat up the corn tortillas in the microwave. It really makes a difference. I'd make this again.

We enjoyed this, but I thought it could have used a little more zing.  I didn't have Chipotle Chili Powder so I used Paprika and Tabasco as a substitute; maybe that was the problem.  I made it in the crock pot, so it was very easy.  Overall, this was a winner and I'll be happy to make it again.

This was very good. I used one clove of fresh garlic along with some granulated. I also took the advise of several and put it into the crock pot to finish off. I added about a cup of chicken broth instead of water.

Turned out GREAT! Easy and tasty, we didn't add a lot of chili powder or any chipotle powder because my wife can't eat real hot. But we did a dd a 1/4 of a fresh mild Anaheim to the salsa and some ground cumin to the pork.

We're big fans of the carnitas at our little Mexican restaurant, so I wanted to make them here at home when possible.  I've tried a number of recipes to get the seasonings just right.  My family absolutely LOVED this one and said this is the recipe to use from now on.

I received the Corn Oil from Mazola to facilitate my review - by my thoughts and review are my own.

Let me just start off by saying we LOVED this recipe and cannot wait to make it again!  I did make a few changes.  I used boneless pork ribs because I had them on hand.  I used a hot Mexican Chile Powder - so I did NOT feed it to my toddler.   I didn't have chipotle.  It was such an easy recipe.  I'm not much of a cook but I cannot wait to try this again.  My boyfriend has been bugging me for days about how he is "craving" it.  He loved the corn tortillas but I think I'll always favor flour.  Even beginners will succeed with this recipe.  The flavor was amazing and the sauce/salsa reminded me of mexico.  Definitely 5 stars in my book.  I will be posting more on my blog www.myramblingsandreviews.blogspot.com if you want to check it out.

This was very good.  I dinged a star because, although good, the salsa was very plain so I ended up adding minced onion and garlic and a squirt of lime juice as well as a pinch of salt.  The other reason for not giving 5* is I prefer my carnitas to be shredded pork.  The flavor was fine and the cooking method was simple enough though - much faster than my usual crock pot pulled pork.

First of all, I HATE corn tortillas. The pork in my opinion didn't have flavor until you swallowed, then it tasted like eating fire. I have also discovered that I do not like tomatillos. They were very prominent and took over the flavor of the sauce.

We really enjoyed this! I couldn't find chipotle chili powder, so I used cayenne in place of it. I also didn't use cilantro in the salsa because we don't like it. Otherwise, I followed the instructions to the letter. I thought they were very good! The pork was very tender, and I loved the tomatillos in the salsa. I would add a bit of seasoning to taste to the salsa, but otherwise, it's a winner. Thanks, Mazola! :)

The pork in these was very good. The spice was right on. I had never had tomatillos before. I found them a little sour but a nice complement when paired with the red tomato and cilantro. I did add just a dash of lime juice. Even my pickiest eater loved them minus the corn tortilla. She said it would be good with maybe some beans or corn on the side, add a salad and its a meal she would eat again!

Loved the pork. I didn't really measure the spices but just seasoned to taste. I added some minced garlic and salt as well, also I used Mazola chicken bouillon. We really didn't care for the tomatillo salsa. I thought it really could have used some minced red onion and some acid. I did add some lime juice to it but was out of onion unfortunately. I'd make these again in the crockpot and skip the salsa :)

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We did a full roast in the crockpot and shredded it; I had mine as a "bowl," with crumbled queso fresco and fresh chopped cilantro on top, along with Chipotle hot sauce.  I loved the tomatillo salsa so much I used tomatillos in other recipes this week!  We will make this again and again.

My whole family enjoyed these! I used a pork tenderloin because my store didn't have pork shoulder on hand. I added a bit of finely diced fresh jalapeno, minced garlic, sliced green onion and a splash of lime juice to the cilantro tomatillo sauce. What a great flavor combination with the meat and salsa! This recipe is a keeper!

This dish was delicious, though a bit time-consuming if you include the prep work and cooking.  The pork was delicious, and we enjoyed the salsa (which had some heat with the jalapeño).  I served this with Mexican rice, avocado slices, and optional toppings of sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.  The pork can also be made in the slow cooker.  Just throw in the pork, spices, and a few cups of beef stock and cook on high for 6 hours.  I made quesadillas with the leftovers (and topped with the salsa, of course.)  Yum!

I was unable to find the tomatillos or the pork shoulder. I used pork loin and a some chunks of tomatillo that I found in a store bought salsa. Everyone liked these but had their own tweaks they would make it we have this again. One of the things we all agreed on is we would use flour tortillas. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Very, very good carnitas.  No fresh tomatillos in the grocery store, so I subbed salsa verde.  Used flour tortillas and had to omit cilantro because it tastes like soap to us.  The pork was as tender as could be, the liquid reduced in the stated time, and we really enjoyed these.  This will definitely be a do-over, but next time I may add just a little more heat to them.  A truly easy and delicious dinner!

This recipe is awesome! I couldn't find any of the chipotle chili powder, so I did as other reviewers suggested and just added a bit more regular chili powder and added a touch of cumin for the smokey taste. I think I could have just left the extra chili powder out though. It was a bit too much chili flavoring. Loved the salsa! The tomatillos were a nice change to a regular salsa.

We really liked this, I left the heat out because my mom can't eat heat. Easy to put together even easier to eat. It took the better part of an hour after the first 30 minutes to cook the liquid down. Well worth the wait. I gave myself 2 hours to prepare this recipe and it worked out just great.

Added some jalapeño to the salsa and omitted the chipotle powder since that's not a popular flavor in this house, otherwise, followed the recipe.  We enjoyed these carnitas, but honestly, I definitely prefer the shredded meat instead of the pork cut into chunks.  Good, but doubtful I'll make this recipe again.

These were just what 3 stars indicate:  OK.  We found the meat to be surprisingly bland.  I subbed tenderloin when our grocery store didn't have shoulder and the meat was super tender, just not super flavorful.  We're not cilantro fans and I couldn't find tomatillos, so we topped ours (flour/corn blend after reading prior reviews) with light sour cream, shredded cheddar, and a homemade mango salsa.  THANKS for the recipe!

I went with using my slow cooker as I didn't have the time to prepare as the recipe directs.  I also used a 3# loin and left it whole.  I cooked the loin for about 6 hours and I was able to easily shred the meat using two forks.  I knew the loin would soak up most of the liquid and when I first tasted it I did not care for the powdery feel of the little sauce there was. I added about 1/2 cup of Southern Comfort Fiery Pepper and a pinch or two of salt.  I continued to cook the meat for another hour.  The meat was tender and the flavors were deep and rich.  We do not care for tomatillos so I made a fresh, hot and spicy salsa to go with our meal.  We all enjoyed this recipe very much and I will likely be making this again.

I found this surprisingly easy to make.  I followed the directions and made no changes, including using the Mazola Corn Oil that the recipe calls for...I believe it added a great flavor to the pork.  I was a bit skeptical of having cubed pork for carnitas, as we normally use shredded, but it worked well.  The kids didn't care for the salsa, so they added sour cream and cheese and made pork tacos out of it.

We enjoyed this dish very much.  I prefer my carnitas  cooked in my slow cooker and shredded, so that's how I prepared ours.  Because of religious reasons, my husband does not eat pork so I made this using a beef chuck roast. I slow cooked it for around 4 hours on high then took it out, shredded it, added in more onion and crisped it up in a frying pan using Mazola Corn oil.  Once it was crispy, I warmed up the corn tortillas (A MUST) and took the meat and the tomatillo mixture which I pureed in my Magic bullet and served it.  I also had a side of mashed pinto beans and some homemade guacamole on the side. In my opinion, the tomatillo sauce was ok, but nothing that a store bought jar could have provided for me.  I added in some jalapeno and lime to kick it up and it was ok. The biggest surprise for me was using the corn tortillas.  I agree with another reviewer that the corn oil and corn tortilla are a nice compliment to each other! Thanks #AllstarsMazola  I'm saving this one :-)

This was a departure from how I would normally prepare the pork, which would be browned and then placed in the slow cooker.  With that said, the pork was not nearly as tender as it could have been, but the moisture from the dutch oven helped encapsulate the juices and spices.  As written, this recipe is very bland.  It's a good starting point though, so one can adjust the heat to their liking.  The cilantro tomatillo "sauce", which is in actuality a pico de Gallo, was missing key ingredients like a splash of lime juice and jalapeño pepper.  I enjoyed using the Mazola corn oil, as it heats fast and has a nice complimentary flavor to the pork.  The corn tortillas were bland as well, and didn't do anything for the filling.  I would have preferred floured ones heated over the open gas flame.  A garnish of avocado slices and a dollop of sour cream rounded this dish out nicely.

I was skeptical at first because the carnitas I know are always deep fried. This to me sounded more like a guisado (stew), However, the dish did not disappoint! I was out of chipotle powder, so I substituted smoked paprika instead. However, I think the addition of chipotle would make this dish even more delicious. The "salsa" was lacking, so I added red pepper flakes, a little squirt of lime, some green onions, and garlic. However, the dish doesn't need the salsa as it can stand on its own. 

My husband begged me to keep this recipe in my favorites, so it looks like I'll be making this one again real soon.

The pork cooked to perfect tenderness. I made exactly as written and the only changes I would make next time would be to add a jalapeno to the salsa and cut back the chipotle chile powder to 1/8th teaspoon or even eliminate it to reduce the smoky flavor of the carnitas. I use a lot of chipotle chile powder and keep it on hand but I'm just not use to smoky carnitas. Perfect with tortillas warmed on a cast iron comal.

Very nice! The next time I make this, I'll add a bit of chopped pineapple to balance the flavors of the spices and meat. But this is a very good recipe as it is. Used Mazola Corn Oil. A nice choice, as the flavor of the oil complimented the taste of the tortilla.

I made this making a few changes. The biggest was I made this in the crockpot using a just over 3lb pork loin roast cooking for 6 hours on low. I also used chipotle sauce instead of ground chipotle pepper as another reviewer suggested. For the Tomatillo sauce I added the juice of half a lime and couple dashes of garlic salt after trying the sauce as written. I prepared the "sauce" in my hand food processor. I served on warmed corn or flour tortillas and my family enjoyed it.

This get a 5 star mostly because my kids loved it!  My husband and I really liked it too, but it needs more spice for our taste.

Great Weeknight meal.  I added sour cream to the salsa mix and it made it creamy and good!  My family prefers flour tortillas, so that's what I used.  I#AllstarsMazola®

I decided to alter the cooking style and sub a 2# pork sirloin roast instead of the shoulder because it was on sale at my store.  I seasoned  the roast as directed in the recipe, heated up a TBS of Mazola® corn oil, and seared all sides of the roast, then threw it in the crock pot with about a 1/4 cup chicken broth and the onions.  Let it cook for 8 hours, then took the roast out, shredded it with two forks and returned it to the onions and juices in the crockpot.  I also could not find tomatillos anywhere around here this time of year, so I purchased a jar of salsa verde and used some of that in place of them.  I'm only rating 4 stars because I had to alter the recipe due to what was available to me and can't give an honest 5 stars, but I would give it 5 stars with my changes.

We really liked this. Pork Tenderloin was on sale, so I took advantage of that and it was delicious and tender in this recipe! I reduced the chili powder to 1 teaspoon and that was plenty for us. I did not use the chipotle as I'm not a fan. I used a tablespoon of fresh garlic also. The tomatillo salsa is amazing. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of freshly minced garlic to it and served this on flour tortillas instead of the corn. Be sure to get a good sear on the pork it really adds to the flavor! Next time I make this I will double everything. There wasn't enough!! I think this would great over rice too. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

I was not able to find the chipotle chile powder, so I bought a small can of chipotle chile sauce and substituted 3 tsp. of that instead. It worked great and gave the meat a nice, smokey flavor with a bit of a kick. I also warmed the corn tortillas on my flat griddle with a bit of oil, which the directions didn't call for, but this is how I always warm my corn tortillas. The cilantro tomatillo sauce is very refreshing and balance out the flavors in the meat, in my opinion. I did squeeze a bit of lime juice over mine before eating. I served these with a side of homemade black beans and rice. Tasty, thanks Mazola!
