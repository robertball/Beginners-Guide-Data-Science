OMG!.. To die for!.. I made this as the recipe stated but added maybe an extra cup of French bread to use it all up and canned peaches.  It was delicious; I added some whipped cream and dash of nutmeg on top for presentaion... :)

04/02/09  I had been wanting to make this recipe for awhile as bread pudding is my ultimate comfort food dessert.  Unfortunately, on a cold and blizzardy day in Denver I realized I didn't have any peaches so I substituted pineapple chunks.  It turned out great.  I also added 2 more eggs than called for in the recipe and the custard turned out perfect. Not too soupy at all.   Additional note:  I had some very ripe peaches that needed to be used and I was able to make this recipe as written.  Fabulous! I added 3 more eggs than called for and also used half and half.  I think the more eggs are needed in the original recipe.  Wonderful sauce too.

This has yet to be one of the best bread puddings yet...As a diabetic I altered the condense milk to a cup of lactose free milk with 10 pkgs of splenda...and half the amount of sugar for the carmel...It still was a dream in our mouths. Our taste buds were thrilled.

This is a wonderful variation from the plain old bread pudding. I will definitely make it again. The caramel sauce is also great on other desserts.

Amazing!  My hubby and I loved this dessert!  I added an extra cup of bread and left the crust on.  I also used 2 large peaches and diced them up pretty small.  And I can't say enough about the sauce - it's to die for!  I highly recommend this recipe and I can't wait to try this recipe with other fruit like apples or pears!

Yum! I didn't have enough peaches so I just made it without fruit. I also made 1/2 the recipe except I did use 2 eggs because others had said it needed the extra eggs. It turned out perfect! The caramel sauce is the bomb! Thank you jowolf for giving us your recipe!

Very good!  I added a bit of extra bread than called for.  I think it would have been soupy otherwise.  And I added just a drop of rum extract to enhance the rum flavor in the sauce.

Made this last night for our card group and they devoured it. Tripled the rum.
As good as my moms recipe. 
Today I am going to add chocolate chips and omit the peaches. We'll see how it goes.

This was excellent...although I substituted peaches for bananas and bread for 4 croissants...so good!  I also used the vanilla instead of rum in the caramel.  I used a muffin tin to cook them and it filled up 12 cups, greased with veg shortening.  I like to have individual servings. Cooked about 35 minutes on convection.  Great recipe - I was trying to mimic something I had at a restaurant last week and this was fantastic, my husband said as good or better than the original we had.

Excellent recipe and we are a family that loves bread pudding.  The peaches I had were not ripe enough to use so I used canned ( not expecting to like it), boy was I wrong.  I used two cans of diced peaches in heavy syrup (drained, I did not mash them as we like big chunks of peaches.  In place of the hot water I used the heavy syrup I drained from the peaches which equaled a little less than 1 1/4 cup, it was plenty of liquid.  I baked in a dish smaller than called for in the recipe to make it thicker and baked 1 hour and 15 mn.  I left the rum out of the sauce and replaced with vanilla.  This dish is superb and I will be making for a family gathering next week.

This was very good, however, a little note on the caramel sauce:  being in Tennessee and unable to purchase rum on a Sunday, I decided to simply leave it out.  Bad idea.  The caramel sauce hardened quickly and wouldn't come out of my sauce pan without me heating it up.  I put it on the bread pudding, and I thought my teeth were going to come out of my head trying to chew it.  It tasted great, and I'm sure it would have been fantastic with the rum that certainly needs to go in there!  I will try this again on a day when the liquor stores are open and hope for smoother results :)

Excellent!  This was a big hit on Thanksgiving Day.   I incorporated many of the suggestions made on this recipe.  I added an additional cup of peaches (canned); added an additional cup of bread; used challah bread; and substituted some of the peach juice for the water. I also made one and a half recipes and found that doing so filled a 9 x 13 pan. Thanks for posting this recipe....it is delicious, especially with the caramel sauce!

Awesome! It tastes like a mix between peachy bread pudding and peach cobbler. The only thing I changed and would want to change about this recipe was that I used fresh peaches. :) Maybe extra caramel sauce to serve over the ice cream would be good too. :)

This turns out somewhere between bread pudding and peach cobbler.  The peaches are a great replacement for the raisins that are in most bread puddings I've had.  The caramel sauce is AWESOME!  It would make a great ice cream topping just by itself.    I did tweak a couple of things.  Since water doesn't bring any flavor to the party, I replaced the 1 1/4 cups of hot water with some warm milk (about 3/4 cup) and peack schnapps (about 1/2 cup) - WORKED GREAT!

My husband is a big fan of bread pudding.  In need to use up the bushel of peaches he bought, I tried this recipe.  It was a complete success.  Even the kids who dont like bread pudding ate it.  Thankyou for sharing!

Absolutely delicious.  For once, I was actually delighted that I am the only bit bread pudding fan in my family, because I got this dessert to myself.  It took days to finish, and was still delicious at the end. I made no changes except to use a little rum extract instead of the rum in the caramel sauce.  What a fabulous find!

Bread pudding isn't my thing and this was my first attempt at making it myself. I made it for guests and it was devoured. Seriously, the whole pan, by three people, no leftovers. It was a really fun, unique desert and I was honestly proud to serve it. I didn't change a thing and followed the recipe exactly. It was incredibly easy, even the sauce, and I would definitely make this again. Thanks!

My family devoured this quickly.  I made as directed but will add a cup more of peaches next time.  I used Penzey's Ceylon Cinnamon which works well with fruit.  The caramel sauce is delicious!!  I will be making this again.

Wonderful easy recipie.  My husband is not a big fan of peaches, but he loved this recipie.  It's a nice, light, tasty recipie, and the caramel rum sauce is so good over top.  We added a dollop of whipped cream.
I stored leftovers in the fridge, and reheated in the microwave the next day.  Still tastes just as good.

I was tempted to play around with the recipe (adding a touch of pure almond extract, swapping the water with cream--which still has me wondering why...) but I stuck with the original (used frozen peaches though) and was pleased with the flavors. I normally prefer a thicker bread pudding; as others have mentioned, it's only about an inch or so thick, but I thought it worked. It seems you get more peach to each bite. I enjoyed the caramel sauce-though I used vanilla in place of the rum and added a pinch of salt. I think it will be a hit as a special at the restaurant this week!

Oh wow so amazing! First time making bread pudding. I was craving for peaches and had some day old french bread to use up and I'm so glad I found this in the reviews section. The only change I made was to use milk (1 cup) instead of water, added 1 more eggs, and used frozen peaches (diced in processor).

I had a lot higher expectations for this dish.  I was hoping it would be super flavorful and more exotic than just a regular bread pudding.  I love bread pudding, and this one was just ok.  I hardly tasted any of the peaches, so that definitely needs to be increased.  Once the sauce was cooked, it didn't have a bit of rum flavor to it, so if you like rum, that will need to be increased.  The bread pudding cooked nicely and accurately, but I felt like the top sauce overwhelmed it with too much sweetness.  I should have gone sparingly instead of pouring the whole amount on top.  Overall, it tasted like typical, ordinary bread pudding.  To be more accurate to it's title, it will definitely need some modifications.

Very good almost tasted like a peach cobbler and instead of rum I used lemon in the sauce.  I love lemon sauce on my bread pudding so it made it very tasty. I will be making this again

I have never made bread pudding before this. Very simple to make. Added extra peaches after reading the other reviews. My husband grew up on bread pudding, I made this for him, he said it was by far the best he has ever eaten. I made my first batch on thurs, I am now making another batch. (It's Sunday!) I wouldn't change a thing, except add more peaches. We had it with the caramel sauce recipe provided, outstanding. (I don't even like caramel)

This bread pudding recipe is awesome! The bread pudding turns out rich and flavorful, fluffy but substantial.  I added 1 tsp. almond extract to enhance the peace flavor.  I am also going to try it with blueberries instead of peaches.  Thanks for sharing this!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! I have made it twice and want to eat the whole pan! Yummy! I made the saue with onc with the rum and once without. I personally like it without the rum but it does harden up after awhile. I put mine in a microwavable dish and simply reheated for a few seconds then served over my bread pudding. I actually liked the caramel when it was hardened too. Served it over ice cream and added it on top of warm brownies. Very good recipe! Thanks!

This is by far the best bread pudding recipe ever. Every time I cook this my customers go crazy. First off, the smell of it baking is heavenly. Second, most people have never tried bread pudding (with a name like that I can see why) and are pleasantly surprised it tastes so good. Finally, the insanity sets in. Once they realized they have almost licked the plate clean they decide they must have more! Hence the 5 star rating I gave this. Thank you jowolf2!!!

Very good!  I added an extra egg like others suggested and I used milk instead of water.  The caramel sauce really was as good as everyone says.  It was so easy to make too!

I used this recipe for the caramel sauce alone and it was out of this world. Poured it over homemade vanilla ice cream. The caramel sauce recipe is one I will keep near and dear forever.

This turned out great!  I stuck to the recipe except for using canned peaches and it was delicious.  Tastes just like summer and the kids can help you make it by ripping up the bread and stiring the sauce.  Great recipe!

A pretty good basic recipe.  I did make some changes which made it a 5 star recipe.  I used raisin bagels instead of Italian bread.  I also used canned peaches with the natural juices and cut down the hot water to 1 cup.  I also added 1/2 cup fresh blueberries.  I added 5 eggs instead of 3 and 2T vanilla.  I baked it for 1 hour at 350.  Didn't try the caramel sauce, but did top it ice cream.  My family loved it!

What a great peach dessert and the caramel sauce is heavenly.   It's not a thick bread pudding, maybe only 1/2" thick.  I chunked it up into small squares and layered it in a dessert glass.

My husband wanted bread pudding for our anniversary dessert, so I made it and it was PERFECT.  I halved the recipe since it was just for us, but still used three eggs and replaced the water with milk...delicious!!

This was very good. I followed the recipe but baked it in an 8x8 pan because I wanted it to be thick. It came out perfect after about an hour of cooking time. The sauce was great as well. Next time I will add more peaches so that I can taste peaches in every bite!

I made this last night and it was wonderful....my husband who is not a bread eater even enjoyed it! I added a tsp. nutmeg, allspice, and apple pie spice to the peaches. I also substituted 1/4 cup peach juice (I used canned peaches) for 1/4 of the water. i didn't mash the peaches, just them up a little. I didn't have rum for the sauce so I used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 1/4 of milk and I melted 3 tbl. of marshmellow creme (from a jar). I stirred until well mixed and drizzled over bread pudding. OMG! This is a keeper!

Let me first say, I loved this bread pudding.  However, I couldn't give it 5 stars because I really couldn't taste the peaches.  Next time, I'll use more peaches or not chop them so finely.  The caramel sauce was great on top!

Great bread pudding recipe!  1.  Added 1 more cup of bread.  2.  Used frozen peaches, thawed, 16 oz bag.  3.  Used 2 tsps of vanilla.  4.  Did not make caramel sauce as it was sweet enough.  Update (1/1/11): this has now become my favorite bread pudding recipe after making it a few times.  Made this for coworkers Christmas week with rave reviews.  Since I made it with the sauce, decided to use reduced-sugar condensed milk for pudding.  Also added 2 tbsps of peach schnapps for added flavor.  Next time I may double the rum in sauce as I couldn't taste it after baking.

The only thing I changed was used rum extract instead of rum.  We really enjoyed this with the sauce.  Even the next day! was gone in two days, that should sum it up.

Excellent!   It's not peach season, so I used home canned peaches instead.  I first drained them, then cut/lightly smashed as directed in recipe.  When done, the bread was infused with a hint of peach and my dinner guests raved.

Our first time to make and eat bread pudding.  Pretty good on it's own, but the caramel sauce made it SUPER tasty!!  Pretty sure we will be making this recipe again the next time we get fresh peaches.

Very tasty. The rum caramel makes the dish. I was disappointed that there wasn't a stronger peachy flavor though :/ Perhaps next time I will add some blackberrys to create some flavor. However, overall it was fantastic!

I'm sure anyone who likes bread pudding will like this.  My family just doesn't like bread pudding.  I followed the recipe and even added more eggs per the other comments.  It wasn't bad.  It just wasn't great.  I won't make it again.

The caramel sauce is very good and a snap to make.  
I thought the bread pudding itself was only so-so.  However, the concept is pretty good.  The next time I want bread pudding with peaches, I'll just stick to my tried and true basic bread pudding recipe and top it with peaches after baking.  Add some vanilla ice cream and the caramel sauce and it will be excellent.

Awesome! I hate to be one of those people who rates a recipe that they completely changed, however I had no choice but to alter this recipe because my peaches were actually leftover turnover filling that happened to have many of the same ingredients (besides eggs) incorporated.  Anyways, this recipe gets 5 stars for inspiration and a recipe to build off of! I did make the sauce substituting simple syrup for corn syrup and it's so easy and delicious its ridiculous! Thank you for a successful bread pudding!!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I will double the sauce next time though. That was super yummy...just not enough.

the best ever! followed to the letter, except I used 2 16 oz cans o peaches, minus juice.  I used store brand of condensed milk and I thought it was a tad thin, thus making the pudding a little runny.  Next time I will use a national brand of condensed milk and add some pecans.    The sauce was indeed out of this world good.   This tasted every bit as good as the bread pudding at Babins, a popular restaurant in Houston area.

Used this recipe for the sauce, be sure to use real butter as it didn't turn out right with margarine.

I made this with mangoes instead of peaches, b/c I had a couple of really ripe ones begging to be used. OMG! This was sooooo good!

The only thing that I'd do differently is to maybe double the recipe. Here in New Orleans we are used to very thick/deep bread pudding and this one turned out really thin when baked in a 9" x 13" dish. However, our french bread is very different here (much lighter), so I'm gonna experiment with the proportions due to our local bread.

The caramel sauce is awesome!  I did, however, use 2 TBSP rum, since down here we like to taste our alcohol ;)

Tonight I took this dessert to dinner with the neighbors and it was a big hit! Thanks jowolf2!

added 1/2 cup of cranberries, and served with Cool Whip- didn't realize until after it was gobbled up that I had forgotten the sauce! Will definitely try the sauce next time, but it was delicious without!

This was awesome! I did add a lil bit more bread & I didn't have regular rum so I used Malibu rum but I don't think it really changed the flavor much, if at all. I Will definately make this again! My kids even loved it & they're sooo picky! Thx!

This is lovely, had some canned peaches wanted to use up and we love bread and butter pudding. I used regular bread as it is all I had, I also didn't have 14oz of sweet milk so used what I had which was 6 oz and used regular milk, added a tbsp of sugar and PERFECT....using milk also helps cut calories but didn't take away from the end result. The sauce is gorgeous and as others have said could be used for other things, we dont drink so rum was not in the menu, but used  1 tsp of rum flavouring. Made sauce after removing dessert from oven as it does cool fast and hardens.  I did put peaches in a colander and drain off all juices so pudding wouldn't be wet, and then redrained after mashing. We will certainly use this again

Yum! I made this exactly as directed, except I added rum flavoring to caramel sauce I already had. Next time I might use a smaller pan, as my bread pudding turned out a little flat. Delicious with whipped cream, ice cream or alone. Thanks for the recipe!

This was comfort food to the max. I cut would cut down the bread by half a cup. I used delicious day old viena loaf and cut the peaches up small. I didnt need the sauce as it was sweet enough. I served with vanilla icecream- yem. Next tome I might add some walnuts in it too.

I really liked the bread pudding. However, I did not like the caramel sauce with it. I found the sauce overly sweet, and unnecessary. I served it warm with Blue Bell vanilla ice cream. When the ice cream melted a little, it almost made a creme anglaise, which is very traditional for bread pudding. Also, I would note that fresh peaches did not look good at the store so I used 2- 15 ounce cans of peaches, drained, and it worked just fine.

I made this with the following changes: used canned peaches (could not find decent fresh peaches and frozen were outlandishly expensive) then measured out a healthy 2 cups once slightly mashed up and drained). Reduced bake time to 35 minutes - custard was set in this amount of time. All other instructions were followed exactly. Excellent dessert, not overly sweet.  Served with whipped cream drizzled with caramel sauce.  Using a nice crusty bread results in a slightly chewy/crispy texture. In the future I might try adding brandy or dark rum to the dessert and to the caramel sauce.

YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! 
Made it for a small dinner party. They almost licked the bowls clean. The sauce was to die for. I did change it up a bit, milk instead of water,  1 egg more,  1 cup more of bread with crust on. Couldn't find fresh peaches, so I bought a frozen bag of peaches. 
This is now my WOW dessert !!!

Great start to  peach bread pudding.  After reading the reviews and suggestions, I made a few adjustments myself.  

First, I roasted fresh peaches on a very lightly buttered baking sheet with a  sprinkle of salt, freshly grated nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves.

Second, I altered the custard mixture  by adding an egg and some nutmeg, salt and cloves.  I then, as suggested, I cut the butter in half in both the bread pudding recipe and rum sauce.

My bread, believe or not, was almost week old hot dog buns that were VERY stale (oops left them out in a bowl from a bbq last week) Perfect for bread pudding, though, as the marriage of the bread and custard didn't produce a super soggy  or super dense final product.  

I covered my pudding while cooking with the exception of the last 15 minutes to toast the top.  The  roasted peaches added a great peachy depth to a great traditional bread pudding.  Thanks for this great recipe!  It was a pleasure eating it!

I had fresh peaches that I needed to use and I love bread pudding so this recipe seemed to be a perfect fit. I used 6 fresh peaches which I know made almost 3 cups of peaches. The peach flavoring did not seem to be as intense as a piece of peach pie. I also added an extra egg as many suggested. I will make this recipe again, but i am going to punch up the peach flovoring. More peaches? Peach flavoring? Some peachgelatin disolved in hot liquid and added to the mix? It was plenty rich as is, the caramel just put it over the top sweetness wise.

First time, I made this with freshly picked extra juicy peaches, came out awesome. Second time was great. This last time made it with store bought white peaches that weren't as sweet and juicy and it definitely made a difference. It's best with juicy, fresh, sweet peaches. I like to make sure the bread is extra crusty, in fact lightly toasting the bread chunks ensures it doesn't come out too wet and slimey and gets that perfect custardy toothsomeness. Once used egg substitute (flax seed meal and water) bc we were out of eggs. It worked but it wasn't as good. Also used coconut cream instead of condensed milk bc we were out and that was a great sub!

I had never tried bread pudding before, but had a LOT of stale bread that needed to be used (and let's face it, how many bread crumbs can one family possibly use?).  So we tried this and my family loved it.  Especially the caramel sauce.  Immediately wanted to try it with a chocolaty cookie.  Next time we may try it with rhubarb, I think the super tart flavor would set this off nicely.

This was very well received by all at a small family dinner. The only change I made was to use my canned peaches because the peaches on my tree aren't ripe yet. Very enjoyable.

I have made this recipe several times now, and it has always been a huge hit.  We served for Thanksgiving, and every body raved over it, especially the sauce.  One of the more seasoned grandmother cooks there called it "sinful!"  I usually have to use an extra cup of bread pieces to soak up most the liquid (and it helps tremendously to use day old bread since it soaks up better).  I also doubled the amount of rum because I couldn't taste it with the recipe amount, maybe because I was using light rum.  But a big thanks to the author, this recipe will be in our holiday repertoire always!

I LOVE this recipe!  It is so easy, but tastes like you spent all day baking.  I would definitely recommend this recipe to fans of bread pudding.  Not your typical bread pudding, but it is so much better.

Just a heads up: 

I haven't made the bread pudding yet, but I did make the caramel "sauce" to top a cheesecake.  It was absolutely delicious.  However, I used vanilla, according to the cook's suggestion, as I didn't have any rum on hand and I'm hoping this substitution is why the caramel "sauce" hardened.  It ended up more like Mack's toffee than any caramel sauce I've ever had.  I would not recommend using vanilla instead of rum because the "sauce" cools and hardens quickly- and I can't imagine the bread pudding would be hot enough to keep it soft for long.

I don't like typical bread pudding with raisins, so this was a great treat.  Five stars as written.  I don't bake, either, and this was basically fool proof.

I don't like bread pudding but my 5 stars are for the caramel sauce alone!  Amazing!  Seriously, the very best caramel sauce I have ever had, and I LOVE caramel.  I made it to pour over a pan of Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies (from this site) and then I'm going to sprinkle a little sea salt over the top for salted caramel brownies.

Wonderful!  I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk, so I used heavy whipping cream and added some extra sugar.  Worked fine.  I was tempted to leave the rum out of the caramel sauce, but I am so glad I didn't!  I used Captain's Spiced Rum and it was so good!  I kept tasting it over and over.  Yummmy!  I will make this again!

I was looking for a creative way to use up a loaf of stale French bread and stumbled into this recipe. What a great find! We LOVED it. I made no changes other then to add an extra egg to the mix per another reviewers advice. I also added a few tbsp of heavy cream to the caramel sauce. Just a personal preference. It was FANTASTIC. Felt nice and homey, plus I got to use locally grown peaches in season these days. Thanks for sharing...

I just finished the recipe the flavoring is delicious, however I added 1 additional cup of  water because the bread absorbed the egg batter leaving it dry. Otherwise my early thinking made it all worth it.

This recipe was very good with a few tweaks as suggested by other reviews, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  The bread pudding itself was a decent base but definitely needed more peaches (I used 1 quart of home-canned but will use 2 next time) and at least 1 additional egg (I used 4, but will use 5 next time).  I also reserved the juice the peaches were in and used that instead of water.  I used 1 package of hot dog buns which turned out great as it used them up and I didn't want to go out and buy French bread.

I have to agree with the other reviews that the caramel rum sauce is the best part of this recipe - I can't say enough good things about it & if I could give the sauce 5 stars and the pudding 4, then I would.  I think after I make a few adjustments this recipe will be a 5-star for sure and I will definitely be making it again & again.

Inadvertently overcooked it, but still good.  I added an extra egg and  1 cup bread per other suggestions.  Next time may use canned or frozen peaches as I don't enjoy peeling fresh peaches!

Fast and easy to make. The pudding itself was lightly peachy and not terribly sweet (which I liked!) The sauce added the super sweet, I liked it both with and without the sauce.

Update on my review, I've made it twice now and made a few changes that take this from a great recipe to totally amazing. I doubled the peaches to 4 cups (I used canned since they aren't in season), added a cup of fresh blueberries, used a mixture of half milk and half peach syrup instead of water, used 5 eggs instead of 3, and 6 cups of bread. It filled a 9 x 13 pan which took about an hour and 5 minutes to bake. All I can say is wow!!!  Served it at a family gathering and it was huge hit. The rum caramel sauce is SO GOOD!!! We had it with vanilla ice cream, and it is a new family favorite.

I made it, but used 1 cup frozen peaches and 1 cup mango pieces and minced them before putting in the mixture. I also used pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon and mango flavored rum in the caramel sauce. It was scrumptious.

OMgosh.....this is the best! Decadent and delicious....
Since it's fresh peach season, I made it twice in the last few weeks. I doubled the amount of peaches this last time and it was heaven. What's not to like about extra peaches? After I poured the caramel sauce on top, I topped it with chopped pecans. Heaven!

The only change I made was to substitute rum extract for the rum.  It was delicious!  I used fresh peaches and stuck to the amount of bread called for and it was not soupy at all.  Got rave reviews from my husband and daughter!  Will certainly make this one again!!

I followed the recipe as well as a couple of review comments. I increased the eggs from three to 5, Added about 5 cups of bread with the crust, and I added about 3 cups of fresh chopped peaches. I did not smash them. I added about 5 cups of bread with the crusts.I baked it at 335° for 90 minutes and it was absolutely perfect. Crusty on top and well cooked in the middle. Caramel sauce turned out absolutely wonderful and both are good as leftovers. I served it for breakfast with sausage links

I’m just not a fan. It was just OK. I  used really good sweet peaches but the peach flavor just did not come through in the pudding. I wouldn’t be interested in eating it at all if it weren’t for the caramel sauce. And I can make that sauce without any kind of recipe. I have made it many times. I did put bourbon in it instead of rum because I like it better. I will not be making this again.

Loved it - to die for!! Didnt have a 9x13 so used two 9x9s and then flopped one on top the other after the finished baking. I believe youd be just fine doing the whole deal in a single 9x9. I prefer a thicker portion anyway. 

And for all you alkies out there (J/K) hold off adding the Rum until you have removed the sauce from the stove. Maybe use 2 tablespoons or more if you really want to taste the rum.

Wonderful! Use daily soy milk for lactose intolerant friend. Put sauce over bread while baking and served with coconut milk based vanilla ice cream.  Yummy! Will make with regular milk next time.

I loved it.  It was easy and the perfect texture.  Not too mushy and not to stiff.  The rum caramel sauce was a perfect finish.  I think this base recipe could be used to apply it to other fruit like nectarines as long as the water content and texture aren't very different.  Mango, perhaps.  It has much less fattening ingredients than most bread puddings I have made in the past and much easier to make.

As I thought perhaps I had "over mashed" the peaches, I diced up a fifth and added that to the mix.  To ease any timings issue with the dinner I baked it about three hours prior to the meal and simply left it on the counter.  As I thought it might dry out if I reheated it in the oven I made the sauce just before serving and used it to provide warmth to the serving.   Everyone wanted seconds.

My husband loves bread pudding but I am not a fan.  I made the recipe exactly as noted except used milk instead of water and put in a 9 inch round pan. It was delicious.  My husband and son loved it.   Very easy to make.  I will be making this often.
Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was to die for. Brought it to some friends’ house who had invited dinner guests. It was a hit. The only change I made was to make more sauce as the recipe did not call for enough in my opinion for the size of the dish.  Everyone raved about it. Served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled the caramel sauce on it. Yum!

I put more eggs in the bread pudding. It needs more peaches in the bread pudding. I would smash some and put on top of the bread pudding and caramel sauce. I also used Kraft caramel and made the caramel sauce because I am not good at making caramel.

I used 'light butter', didn't have any French bread around so I used sandwich bread, and fat free Sweetened condensed milk.. It worked perfectly and was wonderful. Otherwise I follow the directions exactly. The sauce is a little rich in my view, but tasty. I especially liked having a serving in a bowl with a little half and half. It would probably be great for breakfast, too. It is so good to have a fine recipe for our all to brief peach season here in Colorado.

I made it, and probably because I didn't have sweetened condensed milk it didn't work out the best. It has however taken a LOT longer to cook then said. I had to add sugar and replaced the condensed with regular milk. I used canned peaches. I probably should have added sugar to them too!! Like it was so tasteless and plain. I love sweet bread pudding. As for the sauce, it is okay, I also changed it too though because it did not work with the initial ingredients. I am not sure why, so I had to had more brown sugar. It does taste like butter rum candies though, even when I used vanilla as I have no rum. May have been even better with the real rum, but it just didn't really work out when I made it. But I am not going to give up on it, maybe I had an off day and it can be fixed. I just love sweeter breads.

I used canned (Dole in the little plastic cups) peaches and drained the juice off. And I had to halve the recipe, which was still pretty big, lol. I only had Villaggio Artisan sliced bread, so I used that, and it turned out fantastic. I don’t have rum, but I didn’t miss it. And I can taste lots of peach. I don’t understand why anyone can’t. There’s nothing wrong with this recipe. It’s perfect even with the cheats I had to use, so I’m sure it’d be even better, if that’s possible, if you follow the directions properly.

My husband and his dog said this was delicious.  I've never been a fan of bread pudding, but thought the addition of peaches might improve it.  I was wrong.  The caramel sauce is very good though!  I'm sure my dislike has nothing to do with the recipe, but just with the fact that I don't like bread pudding.

Not a fan of this recipe. Seemed too dry.  However, my husband loved it.  I gave three stars as a medium rating since he loved it.  I probably won't ever make again unless I do some tweaking.

I didn't have any peaches so I just made this plain with a loaf of stale French bread that I had.  It was fantastic - especially with the caramel sauce.  I will definitely make this one again!

This was SO GOOD! I think next time I'll use more peaches, because I can never have enough peaches :)

Maybe it is just me, but this didn't seem very sweet to me.  I expected it to taste really sweet with the sweetened condensed milk, but it tasted like soggy bread and peaches.  The cinnamon flavor was barely noticeable.  I think next time, I will use cinnamon swirled bread to give it more flavor.  Or I will decrease the water and add more cinnamon.  Also the caramel sauce tasted like sweet sugary butter, not caramel.  I will try reducing the butter in it next time that I make it.  Also, grease your 9x13 pan really well; I greased mine with Canola oil but the whole recipe stuck like glue to it.  I hate cleaning stuck on food.

It tasted just like french toast but takes 2 hours longer to make! It was ok, but nothing special. I agree with other reviewers that you can't really taste the peaches and I even added the juice the peaches came in. The only redeeming quality in this recipe is the sauce, which is absolutely AMAZING! It's so simple and delicious and would be great on ice cream and any number of other desserts.

I made this exactly like the recipe stated, which is unusual for me--I usually make changes to recipes.  This one turned out WAY to greasy; there is too much butter in both parts of the recipe (the caramel and the bread pudding).  We only ate small piece each. In addition, there really was not as much flavor as I had hoped for. I love the peaches and I think the sweetened condensed mild is good, but it really needs more spices besides the cinnamon.  I also think that I'd separate the eggs, add the yolks into the batter, and then whip the whites and fold them in.  I also might let the egg/peach mixture sit on the bread a little before cooking to really let it soak in.

I'm thinking I might be able to use the bread pudding for some sort of "French toast"  make over of the bread pudding part--pan frying it might get some of the grease out--although I'm not sure what to do with the caramel yet.  It just might get thrown out.  Sigh...  If I did this again, I'd lower the amount of butter in both recipes and probably add

Was not sure at first about this recipe, but it turned out pretty good. My motherinlaw came over and had the last piece she loved it so much she was even scraping the bottom of the baking dish.

I only used the caramel sauce portion of this recipe and is was delicious. I needed thicker caramel so I cooked it around 8-10 minutes. Also, I only had bourbon on hand, but it did just fine.

I had a bread pudding in New Orleans and fell in love. I serched and tried several recipes and finally tried this one and it was the closest I came to the one I had there. The only thing I did differently was make a puddle of white chocolate on one side and milk chocolate on the other side of each serving. Awesome! thanks for the winderful recipe!

Not that great.  I'll stick to my original recipe using milk, sugar and raisins.  Seems like a waste to use sweetened condensed milk when other ingredients work just as well.  Besides, it seems like the bread makes all the difference anyway.

We enjoyed this, but thought the peach flavor could have been more intense.  It was easy to make.

I omitted the caramel sauce because the recipe was sweet enough as is.  I didn't peel my (organic) peaches), only chop them up coarsely.  I used challo instead of French bread.  I used Lactaid instead of water, hoping my lactose intolerant family will try the pudding.  I figured that the lactase enzyme from the Lactaid would also work on the sweetened condensed milk.  We'll see. The pudding turned out quite tasty!

I really liked the caramel sauce. Followed it to a 't' and it was delicious :) Froze when I used it on ice cream... a light subtle sweetness, but it could have been a little more caramely :)

Actually I just made the caramel sauce to go with another dessert--excellent--drizzled it over apple cake and ice cream--formed a caramel "shell" on the ice cream. Just what I was looking for.
