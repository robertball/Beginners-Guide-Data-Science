This was really good!  I made it as close to the original as I possibly could.  I didn't think the chili powder was too much.  Great flavor!  I used canned diced tomatoes, canned beans, bottled lemon juice and ground cumin instead of seeds, which made it so easy.  I finished it up in the crock-pot and served it to my church family.  They loved it!  To make peeling the squash a little easier: cut it in half, zap it in the microwave for a couple of minutes. After it cools, cut into lengthwise pieces and use the vegetable peeler.  It will be a little softer.

Interesting combination of spices... hearty but i just couldn't eat much of it because it was too hot-  2 tablespoons of chili powder!  I would use less next time.

In my opinion this was excellant! Fast and easy to prepare after long hard day at work. It was sweet and spicy, very filling. Great for a vegetarian who still has to prepare meat for the rest of the family. It will for sure be one I will use over and over again. Also going to suggest local resturant to try it,they need more new vegetarian dishes.

Very good, but next time I think I'd use a little less chili powder.

This was a great recipe. I made a few minor adjustments but the spices were perfect once I decreased the chili powder. Here's what I did: I used buttercup squash instead of acorn and cooked it a bit in order to be able to peel it. I used kidney beans because I had no pinto beans and I used the bean cooking water instead of water. I also used canned tomatoes. I think that the recipe would be really good with a bit of stewing beef cut into small chunks but it really is great the way that it is.

This stew took 3+ hours to make, and was so spicy that it was not palettable.  We just couldn't eat it.  I think you meant teaspoon of pepper not Tablespoon.

Excellent!  This recipe is wonderful, and it makes the house smell terrific.
I made this with canned tomatos and canned beans.  I think it would also be good with lentils.  I did add about 1 tsp of sugar to cut the acid just a little.  Also, I cooked the squash in the oven just long enough to soften before peeling.  It was a lot less work.  I added sweet italian sausage, but wouldn't do that again - it tasted better as a vegetarian dish.

Very good! Just make sure to go light on the chili powder and add more to taste. I roasted the squash at 375 for 20-25 min before adding to the stew.

The flavors of this soup didn't go that well together; it tasted like just a chili powder and water mixture, with an emphasis on the chili powder.  I won't make this again.

This is the most wonderful stew I have ever had! It has such a wonderful flavor! Unfortunately, it was too much flavor for my husband, who isn't a squash fan. And the kids wouldn't touch it. No accounting for taste! If vegetarian isn't your thing, could substitute chicken broth (vegetable broth good too) for the water, and would be great with a lb of hamburger sauted with the onions, or lb of sliced kielbasa added. Butternut squash has thinner skin so easier to peel than acorn. Just use carrot peeler.

I love the cinnamon flavor in this!  I used only half the tomatoes for cooking; I prefer them raw, so I used them as a garnish.  Without the liquid of the tomatoes, this became a thick stew quickly!  Delicious!

changed the following: 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp chili, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 6 cloves garlic, 3/4 jar tomatoes.  Not a soup you can eat a lot of.  Next time try adding nutmeg and only 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Also try adding fresh parsely.  Try using pork as a base for the broth.

Really good. It's MUCH easier to bake and scoop out the soft squash and it's ready to use, rather than peeling and boiling it.  Peeling a squash is not easy.

Excellent, rich flavor in a healthy dish! Yes, canned tomatoes are easiest as is cumin powder. Even better the next day. My husband loved this!

This was really good.  I used a yellow onion, and a mixture of canned and fresh tomatoes.  I also used a potato masher on the squash before serving; this gave it a much thicker texture.  My picky boyfriend who turned his nose up at the mention of squash ate 2 bowls.

Thank you for this easy recipe.  After sauteeing the first 7 ingredients as written, I put everything in a slow cooker for the day.  This preparation made for a really thick texture, not remotely 'soupy'.  Since I did not have the beans on hand I used chickpeas.  I felt the amount of chili powder was nice (our family likes spice).  Also to make it faster, I used our Vita-mix blender for the tomatoes so I did not have to peel or deseed them.  Instead of pita bread I served over some quinoa to add more protein.

Quick, easy and delicious! This saved me when I found myself part way through a different squash recipe without the necessary ingredients.
I've read a few reviews that said this was too spicy... I didn't find it spicy at all. Just a warm and hearty Autumn stew.

Not a big fan of this recipe. I didn't like the cinnamon in the stew and I found i don't really care for acorn squash. It is a pain to peel.

This was easy to prepare and delicious. I added peas, diced yellow potatoes, cabbabe, extra garlic and a splash of Tapatio.  It came out tasting similar to some of the dishes I've tried at African and Ethiopian restaurants.  Cannot wait to make this again.  And I don't even like squash!

I didn't find this "spicy hot" at all. It seemed like a stew not able to make up its mind what it wanted to be: Indian? Southwestern? chili? salsa? The flavors all blended together. Perhaps adding ingredients at more distinct times, or adding the fresh tomato toward the end of cooking, would have made it better. I won't know, though, as I don't plan to make it again.

I'm so glad I've found a new way to cook acorn squash. This was a big hit. The only changes I mead were that I only put in one tablespoon of chili powder, following other reviewers comments. And I added a can of chicken stock. The one cup of water was just not enough liquid to cover everything that was in the pan. And fresh lemon juice is a must! It brought a nice lift to the heartier flavors. Definitely making this again.

I made this tonight for my family, sort of...i added chopped carrots and potatoes and skipped the beans, cut the chili powder to a tsp. or so, used canned whole tomatoes, added nutmeg and allspice, a beef bouillon cube and cooked it for about two hours. Delicious! Tastes a lot like a Moroccan tagine.

This has a wonderful flavor.  I did not find it spicy, in fact, I added extra chili powder, cumin, and cinnamon to give it a little more flavor.  It would have been better if I had gotten all of the skin of.  Some parts weren't peeled all the way and we didn't like the rough feeling.  I baked the acorn squash 20 minutes and let it cool and it made it easier to peel.  We will deiintely use this again, but I might use sweet potatoes so I don't have to deal with the squash!

This is really good and an interesting combination of ingredients.  I have several acorn squash so was trying to find a good use for them.  I used canned beans and tomatoes as well as ground cumin.  I added water but it felt that it needed some more depth so I added a chicken bullion.  It is now simmering away...I did smash some of the squash just to make it even more thick...the way I like it and I may even add some corn as others mentioned.  I plan to serve it over brown rice. Thanks for this unique recipe!

We added zucchini to this for some extra green vegetables and it was delicious!  We sauteed the onions in a pan and then put all the ingredients in our crock pot and a few hours later we had a delicious dinner.  My husband and I will definately make this again!

I added tomato paste instead of tomatoes and I had to keep adding water to thin it down to a stew consistency...I also had to cook quite a bit longer to make the squash tender.

I liked it fine, but my vegetarian son was so so about it.  I did add an extra can of beans cause it was a bit "soupy".  Might put it over rice tonight to see if he will finish it up.

It’s so good. I added a little pumpkin. And made it with butternut squash instead of acorn squash. I topped with sour cream.

My husband really liked it, but the spices were off for me. Maybe no cinnamon? We added extra beans and I would prefer even more. My son did not care for it either.

This tastes a lot like a vegetable chili. After reading the reviews, I halved the chili powder and used vegetable broth instead of water, though I added more chili powder as it cooked. It did take a little longer for the squash to cook, but I wasn't sure how big to cut it up so that might have been why. I added stew meat and mushrooms because I love them both though I'm sure it would still taste great without either.

I made it with only 1 tsp of chili powder and cinnamon. I was afraid of a strong taste. Unfortunately, I didn't like this dish. I guess it was the cinnamon in it.

A flavour needed to stand up and say, "This is what I taste like!". Unfortunately the most prominent flavour was cinnamon. All in all this dish didn't do it for anyone in my family.

Easy to make and good to eat. Not too spicy for us when made as directed and not all of us are fire eaters. The only change was using butternut squash because that was what we had.

This was absolutely delicious. I made recipe as is, but after simmering stew for 1 and a half hours, I recognized that the acidic nature of the stew was quite strong with the tomatoes and lemon juice. I felt it necessary to add 1 tablespoon of organic raw honey (or use brown sugar) to cut the acid and led to a more balanced palate. This was so goooooooood!!!!!!! I served it with Indian Naan bread, and the other adjustment besides the honey, was to use veggie broth instead of water, this leads to perfect salt balance. This is a keeper. Only reason did not five 5 stars, is that acid content is too high with recipe written as is.  needs a sweet component. If vegan, use agave nectar or brown sugar.

I didn't have time to simmer this for an hour. I made it in a pressure pan using pre-cut and peeled squash from Costco and a can of tri-bean blend, because that's what I had on hand. I prepared per the recipe with the exception of adding the beans. I pressure cooked the mixture, minus beans for 5 minutes. After releasing pressure I used a potato masher to reduce the size of the squash pieces. Added the beans and cooked long enough to heat them and reduce the liquid a little. The whole thing was ready in about 25 minutes. Very tasty served with toasted ciabatta rolls.

I really liked this recipe. I added a potato for a little extra hardiness, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Really good with a dollop of sour cream or plain yogurt.  Will definitely be making again.

I loved it.  I cut out the beans, used organic fire roasted tomatoes and 3 different types of squash. Butternut, acorn and delicata.  Seasoning was perfect. Not spicy at all.  Of course, I'm a southerner so we are quite accustomed to spice.  Very good though

I give this recipe a 5 for being really good base recipe! I'm Bahamian so the spices were just fine with me. I did cut back on the chili powder to one tablespoon and added an Indian spice called garam marsala just for fun.I softened the squash, by warming it in the oven for a few minutes. I then scooped out the squash and added it to the stew. I also added my own vegetables in addition to the ones stated in the recipe.I used canned diced tomatoes and bottled lemon juice. I sauteed napa cabbage with onions and a diced zucchini squash that I had on hand.I also added sliced bok choy,(just because I could) and diced potatoes.The cinnamon,ground cumin,garlic and other spices really blended well with the mild sweetness of the squash. I served this with warmed wheat pita bread on the side. Results: A hearty,chunky vegetable stew that my meat and potatoes hubby really loved!! I will be using this recipe again!!

We loved this recipe! I partially cooked my squash in the microwave. I used canned kidney beans, drained. Bottled lemon juice, and ground cumin instead of seeds. The rest of the recipe I followed. Very tasty, easy to double, great freezer meal!

I was really excited to try this recipe, and have to say it was a let down. I used fresh tomatoes, canned pintos, and only 1 tsp of chili powder (based on other reviews). I also baked the squash for 20 minutes prior to adding it to the stew. While I appreciated the smell of the cinnamon and cumin sauteed with the onion and garlic, the final flavors did not come through. It has almost a sour taste, and is a little bland. I served it over rice with grilled tortillas, and added some Sriracha hot sauce (which makes everything better), but it's just not that great. I think I might try it with potatoes next time (the squash was stringy), and maybe add more salt to counteract that sour undertone. I will also use canned tomatoes, as I feel all that work to peel, seed, and dice was not really worth it.

Loved it!  Very versatile and easy to customize based on what you've got in the fridge.  Used 1+ T chili powder and found it pleasantly spicy.  Added handful of chopped fresh cilantro at the end for color contrast.  Didn't seed tomatoes, just threw in frozen (peeled) garden fresh ones.  Omitted water.  Perfecto!

I finally became a member to add my review.  I thought this was really good.  I added about 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar and oregano to round out the spices.  Contrary to many of the other reviews, I think the amount of chili powder is just right.

Whoever thinks this recipe is too spicy, remember, it's chili POWDER, NOT chili PEPPER!!! I used ground ancho chiles and it came out fine. I omitted the cinnamon and tried a few other things to make it my own. This is a good basic recipe that can be tweaked and expanded on as you see fit.

I cut the chili powder amount in half and it cam out great for those not into spicey foods.  This stew goes well with brown rice, so if you ever needed a reason to cook up brown rice now you've got one.

I have to agree it looks kind of unappetizing, and I really didn't like the smell of it.  Everything changed once I took the first bite.  It was surprising flavourful.  A tad spicy, but I tolerated it.  Goes well with a nice glass of milk to tone down the spicyness.  I WILL make this again.

sooo hot and spicy - i even reduced the spices by more than half - i think it needs even less spice - i just can't handle it - but other than that it's sooo yummy -- had i used all 2 tbsp of the chili pepper - i'd be crying right now.

Delicious.  I left some skin on the acorn squash because I got a little impatient peeling it.  While the cooking did soften the skin nicely, some parts are still a little crunchy.  Next time I'll peel the entire thing for the sake of consistency.  I'll also add chick peas for extra protein.  The lemon is such a great touch.  Spritz some to taste before eating or use a lemon wedge as garnish.

This was a great idea...and I have a cure for peeling the squash...don't! It tastes just as good with the peel on and it's that much easier. I made mine in the crock pot and it worked out great. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent. I tossed in some "panch phoron" an Indian five-spice mixture, with the onion while it sauteed, and threw in some celery and sweet potato, and even my toddler loved it.

This stew was pretty good.  It was just simple comfort food.  It was time consuming however to peel off all the skin off the squash so next time I might try to do that a different way.  We followed the recipe except using black soy beans instead of pinto beans.

I used canned beans and tomato's because my dad said peeling and seeding them is a hassle,(though after peeling an acorn squash I don't know if anything would have seemed like a hassle!)and it came out really well. I hope that it is supposed to have a lemony taste because that is what I ended up with. I wasn't expecting that out of all the stuff that's in it but it was a nice surprise. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This soup was so yummy.  I used leftover squash which cut down the cook time, and I added one more cup of water and a boullion cube for salt.  My whole family enjoyed this, and it was a prefect fall soup that we will enjoy again.

Great combo of spices.  I found it a little too hot, but that's just my taste.  I added ground cumin instead of the toasted seeds, a peeled, seeded and chopped cucumber, and a red pepper as well.  Very good, but next time I'll cut the chili by at least half.

This was really good! I was a bit skeptical of the ingredients but it was a fresh, healthy meal with a neat blend of sweet and spicy. I added both green and yellow squash for more vegetables and served over steamed white rice. Yum!

I searched high and low for a "squash, corn, and bean stew" I used to eat in college.  This fits the bill!  I throw in a package of frozen corn during the last 20 minutes or so.  So very yummy with hot white rice, cornbread or a fresh baked loaf.  I kick up the spice with some cayenne but thats just my taste.  Excellent :)

Misread the recipe and after halving the recipe used 1 TEASPOON of chili flakes not 1 tablespoon which was the perfect quantity. This was absolutely lovely, very thick and an unusual combination of spices. I used butternut squash and cannellini beans as this is what I had in - also added 1 teaspoon of tomato puree. Would make the full amount next time and mash the remainder as a pate. Highly recommended.
