The livers have turned to mush.  I would suggest cooking these for maybe 3 hours or so.  I came home to find mush in my crock pot.

Try this with chicken GIZZARDS, and I think you might like it.

The ingrediants sounded delicious. I did not have golden mushroom soup so I subed healthy mushroom soup. No white wine so I added some additional stock. I felt it cooked a bit too long. Came out a little dry but the livers made a great pate. We don't eat chicken livers very often but willing to try agin with some adjustments. IE- less cooking time and add some more liquid.

I'm sure the ex-wife felt she needed to get even for something and recipe's cook time in the slow-cooker... Chicken Livers would never hold up under 4 hours on low or even warm in any slow-cooker...  but 45 min to an hour and DELISH! loved loved, loved this flavor. Served mine over buttered Parmesan Fettuccine and comfort food at it's best! next time I'm going to throw in a hand full of fresh spinich at the end..  home made rolls and butter on a cold snowing night in Illinois... So glad I tried this one! Could just as easily have been made on the stove top in a cast iron skillet...  FORDTRUCK EXCEPT FOR THE COOKING TIME you made Cicken Little and her livers very proud...WINNING!

I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked them on the stove instead of the crockpot.  It was fantastic.  I've only eaten fried chicken livers; these were the next level up.

I made these for my BF.  He loved it the only change I made was I didn't add the wine.  Defiantly a keeper!!

The only reason I made it 4 stars is because I changed it a bit.  I made the whole thing in an electric frying pan.  Didn't use the soup, and used a lot more chicken stock and wine and sherry, because I needed it to keep for dinner about an hour and it was getting too thick.  It was really good and the basics were as written.  Will definitely be making again.  Mu husband and I love chicken livers and they're pretty inexpensive here because so many people don't like them.  Yeaa for us

i recommend frying the liver in a pan while cooking the rest in a pot, and when all is done mix them together
