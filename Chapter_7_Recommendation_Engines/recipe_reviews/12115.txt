I found this to be an easy recipe I switched from Jalapeno juice to hot sauce and added about 1 tsp cumin and 4 chopped green onions in place of cilantro. The kids loved it and w/o Jalapeno juice they didnt have a problem eating it!

I thought this was really good but the kids grumbled about it.  I took others' suggestions about cutting back on the fresh cilantro.  I cut it back to 1/8 cup (2 Tbsp.) and it was noticeable without being overwhelming.  I think next time I will use about 3 Tbsp. worth.  I served the pie with sour cream, salsa, chopped tomatoes and chopped black olives.  Very good!

Unless you happen to really like the flavor of cilantro I advise cutting down on the amount.

Good flavor and will make again, however, I was looking for more of the "Chile Relleno" flavor to shine through. Fell every short. Not in a bad way, it was very good. And please use the recipe for Cheesy Quiche Crust found on here for the crust, the prepared pie crust for a sweet pie totally compromised the savory flavor of this dish. The Cheesy Quiche Crust made all the difference. Have made it twice now, once with each crust. Delicious Savory Chile  Pie.

I made this for a potluck at work and found the recipe to be quick and easy; however, I would definitely cut back on the cilantro!

Made a few alterations based on what I like and how I like my quiche to come out. I sauteed 1/2 a sweet onion and 2 garlic cloves to make 2 quiches.  Used 2 diced tomatillos (one large one small), 1 bell pepper split between both and a bit of cayenne to the egg mixture which I whipped separately and poured over the other ingredients (3 eggs each quiche with milk, 4 would have spilled over the crust).  Added fresh lime juice to onions and let tomatillos sautee for about 1 min. with the onions at the very end of cooking them to reduce the moisture (not big on soggy quiches, which is why I didn't add the diced green chilies to the mix) Pressed cheese into crust, layered the other ingredients and topped with cheese.  Served with fresh avocado and sour cream.  Turned out beautifully.

Chile rellenos is my dad's favorite mexican thing, so I made this for him. He LOVED it. I did everything as is, except replacing the cilantro with flat-leaf parsley. It was delicious--not too spicy [which I liked].

My husband & I loved this!! Used a little dried cilantro (don't have fresh) & lots of fresh garlic. We like it spicy so I used habenoro salsa. Only had roasted red peppers in the jar (but they were delish)! Thanks for my new fav egg bake. This would be good even without the crust.

I made this for football snacks last Sunday.  Very good and very filling.  I transformed it into a quiche by adding 1 additional egg and used crescent roll dough for crust.  I put the Monterey Jack on the bottom of the 'quiche' to make sure the crust didn't get soggy.  I did omit the chicken.  We really enjoyed this recipe.  Thanks!

Tasty! I use fresh, roasted Hatch (New Mexican) peppers instead of canned green chiles. 2 medium to large peppers are the equivalent of a 4-oz can of chiles.

Very good.  I always order chile rellenos when I eat Mexican, but had no clue how to make it.  This was very tasty.  Not exactly what i get when I go out but very good.

Good for an easy and light meal - served it with a salad - made some rice to go with it if we were really starving. A keeper at our house!

This was just ok.  If I made this again I would omit the cilantro and bell pepper for a smoother texture.

I added 1/2 lb. cooked hamburger meat to the mixture prior to baking. Deleted the cilantro, (we don't like it). We really enjoyed the pie.

I used fresh jalapenos and baked my "pie" in five tartlet pans. To my taste, it wasn't spicy and I will adjust that in the future, but I enjoyed it and didn't even notice until I was half-way through my tart that ... I forgot to add the cheese.

Excellent and very easy to make.  I used about 1/8C cilantro and it didn't overpower the taste.  Next time I will use a deep dish pie shell to avoid some spillage.
