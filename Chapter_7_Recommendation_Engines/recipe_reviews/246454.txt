A nice treat to go with your tea, because these are very dry. But they are also very light and not too sweet, just delicate in both flavour and texture. Reading all the possible adaptations in the description and in the notes I used ingredients to adhere to my family's diets. I used white rice flour to keep it gluten free and chose to use crushed almonds instead of hemp or poppy seeds. Two teaspoons are not enough for the final step, so I ended up tripling it. I made some with almonds and some with sesame seeds. Thank you for the recipe.

I really love the flavor of these cookies.  I couldn't get cardamom so I used ground coriander. I also can't find hemp seeds but I added chopped caraway seeds to the batter and might try poppy seeds. Brushed with a little egg white to help hold together and give them a nice glaze. Great with my morning coffee. They also do well in the freezer.

I love these. Very easy and have the right historical flair. Yes, they are a bit dry but I assume this is accurate for something made in ancient times and meant to be used as an offering. Delicious with hot tea or red wine. Oh, and I couldn't get cardamom so I used coriander. Brushed with egg white before baking. 

The photo shows two versions: one baked longer with finely chopped almond on top, the other baked less time with flax seeds inside.

i didn't have cardamom, so i used 1/4 tsp. each of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and this still didn't provide much flavor. i omitted the hemp seeds, as i didn't have any of those either. For everything else i followed the recipe and they came out very very dry.  Maybe i committed some technical error of some kind??

These were pretty good, easy to make, and I will definitely be making them again. I'm on a very limited diet for medical reasons, so I had to make some substitutions. Sub'd 1T Apple Cider Vinegar, 1t oil, and 1t baking soda per egg. Also omitted the cardamom and hemp seeds. Instead, I used cardamom and cinnamon bark essential oils for flavor. Might also try orange zest and orange essential oil next time for a different flavor.

I had to add an additional 1/2 to 3/4 cup rice flour to the recipe.  I also baked for only 7-8 minutes in my convection oven.
