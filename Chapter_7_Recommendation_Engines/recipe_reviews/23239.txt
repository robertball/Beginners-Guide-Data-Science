WOW! We LOVED this! I used a slow cooker to make this and the pork literally fell apart! We had 8 center cut pork chops that I pan seared on both sides in butter and garlic from the jar. Then I placed them in the bottom of a crock pot. I then sprinkled them with salt, pepper and basil. I then poured the 2 (14 oz) cans of Italian style diced tomatoes over top and then placed 1 onion sliced into rings on top of that. I put the slow cooker on low and we had dinner about 5 hours later. I totally skipped that water, cornstarch thing. We omitted green bell pepper as we were out. We served with white rice, green beans and freshly baked french bread. When I make again I will serve with pasta and a salad. This was better than I had imagined. If serving for company I probably would bake so that the chops don't fall apart. DELICIOUS!!!! Thanks for the post :-)

I made this for dinner and wasn't sure about it at first but it was great, even the fuzzy I don't like pork chops person loved them. I didn't have that size of canned tomatoes so I used a small can and a  can of tomato sauce and it was great. Next time I will just use the tomato sauce with equal part water for the sauce. Have to make this now once every 2 weeks to keep them happy.

I hate porkchops, but in an effort to do something nice for my dad, I decided to make some. My mom came home and said "ewwww.. porkchops, what are you making those for???" But I made them anyway and expected them to be like the usual bland piece of chewy meat, except with some vegetables on top, but instead, they were great! They were the least chewy porkchops I've ever had and they had so much flavor! They even looked pretty with the sauce and side of asparagus I made on a plate.. it looked AND tasted like something from a restaurant. Even my mom liked it... she didn't say anything bad! In fact, I saw her sneaking some leftovers in her lunch the next day. We all agreed they were the best porkchops we'd ever had.

This was so good!the whole family loved it!Even as leftovers!I used a couple little cans of tomato paste instead of the cornstarch and added the onions and peppers during the last 20 minutes or so of cooking the pork chops,so they would pick up the flavor.Highly recomended!

This was a great meal to serve to company. I did alter it a bit. I used thick butterf;ly chops,browned them after using a seasoned flour breading.  Then put the chops in a 9x13 pan and made the sauce in the frying pan. I did thicken it but also added a tbsp of brown sugar. I then put the sauce over the chops and baked it in the oven.  Served it with easy alfredo from this site, salad and chess chocolate cream pie from this site as well.  The meal was a huge hit.  All my mother did was complain about how full she was!

Delicious.  This dish looks so beautiful when it's served that it would impress guests.....and it's sooooo easy.  This would be a terrific "date" dinner if you're trying to impress someone!  Serve with a merlot and you can't miss.  Will make again!

We have made this many times, and it is a great favourite at our house served over rice.  We use bone-in pork chops, diced instead of whole tomatoes and less butter.  We also add the onion and bell pepper about halfway though, which makes the flavour even better!

I made these in my slow cooker with frozen chops for 8 1/2 hours.  My husband said they were the best pork chops he had ever had.  I also added a dash of garlic powder.  Making them in the slow cooker really made this easy, and they turned out great!  Really nice flavor.

I end up making this recipe with oregano instead of Basil.  I also place the onions and bell peppers right on top and cook them with everything the entire time.  They then get mixed in with the sauce.  I serve the pork chop on the side and the sauce over white rice.  The raves I get from everyone are amazing.  This is a very flavorful recipe and is rare in all it's rich (yet healthy) undertones.

i loved them, it took awhile to make but it was worth it. i made it with my boyfriend, he said his were kind of dry but i got the only porkchop where we left the bone on.. and it was delicious. i readded butter and garlic for every two pork chops i browned together so that the garlic would be fresh. and i added a lot of basil.. because i love garlic. we also added more green peppers and onions.. you could add other vegetables prob. or not at all... i'm considering fresh basil next time too!

This recipe is probably delicious as is but I had to change things to go with what was in the cupboard. Scaled it to 4 people, but fed 2 since I only had thin bone-in chops.  Didn't have peppers but used a 14 l/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes that had peppers in it. I also cooked the onions with the chops as others suggested.  I had a package of cajun rice which I made so I didn't use the water and cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  The sauce was nice enough to pour over the rice and chops. I also had some leftover corn which I threw in. Since the chops were thin I only cooked them for 45 min.  It's a keeper recipe since it's easy and adaptable to what's on hand and also delicious.

My husband loved this recipe.  Here are my variations:  I only had 3 pork chops, so I used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes, a whole onion, and the full amount of garlic and basil specified.    Didn't have a pepper on hand, so I left it out, but I want to try it next time.  I cooked the onion with the pork the entire time and added 1 tsp of fennel seed.  With the fennel seed, it smelled like Italian sausage.

A great base recipe! I added about 4 cloves of garlic to some fresh oil after removing the chops from browning. I sauteed the veggies (without tomato) first, then added a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and 1/2 cup of red wine. Placed the chops on top of that, turned them 20 minutes. (total cooking time for chops was 40 minutes) Absolutely delish with mashed potatoes and salad!

I have made this recipe twice now.  First time as-is (except with 4 chops since there are 3 of us) and the second time I didn't have green peppers so I substituted an 8-ounce package of mushrooms, sliced.  We enjoyed it both ways; one person isn't a green pepper fan so he liked with mushrooms better.  

I can't say the recipe is 'the best' but it is certainly good and really easy to prepare.  With extra 'sauce' with just the three of us, I always make rice to go with this meal and serve the sauce over that.  Serve with a side salad or green beans and you have a wonderful meal.  I will definitely prepare this again in the future.

Excellent-my new way of preparing pork chops! I made it with 3 1" thick pork chops cut into chunks. I browned them with olive oil instead of butter and added 1 tsp. garlic right before I added the tomatoes. I only used a 14.5 oz. petite diced tomatoes and it was plenty. I added the 1 tsp. basil and the S&P with tomatoes and simmered, covered, for 30 minutes. I then added 1/2 a bag of pepper stir fry and simmered another 30 minutes. I didn't use the cornstarch and water b/c the sauce was thick enough, probably b/c I used less tomatoes. The meat came out real tender and the sauce was great. I definately want to try it with a crock pot to see if the meat is even more tender.

I never like pork chops because they always turn out dry. This is a good way to "cover up" the texture. I used "basil & oregano" diced tomato. Instead of putting the pork chop back in the saucepan because charred garlic and excess pork fat, I fried the pork chops in a pan, used another skillet with some butter plus extra garlic. It's a good recipe to keep.

Very good!  A must try!  We served this with rice and corn and loved it!  My husband actually went back for seconds.  He said if he hadn't had to get ready for work, he would have had more.  Needless to say, he took some with him to work.  : )

A nice change from the traditional "ketchup" or "fruity" pork chop. We enjoyed this meal very much and will be having it again. I followed the recipe exactly.

I thought this was a great recipe was great! I really liked the way all the ingredients blended together. My boyfriend thought there were too many peppers. He doesn't like a whole lot of them. So next time I won't use as many.

This was a very good use of pork chops -- tasty and easy, didn't need to make any changes.

This was SO GOOD!  Cooked this for dinner for my boyfriend and he was very impressed!
I used flour instead of cornstarch.
It was very tasty!  Will make this again for sure!

I made this tonight & really liked it. The only thing I did different was I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes (that's all I had) &  1 can of tomatoe sauce. I served it with rice. Next time I might try it in the slow cooker.  Thanks for posting.

Pretty good. I thought it needed more flavor though. I left out the cornstarch and cooked everything for about an hour. And used 4 thin chops. The sauce tasted good with the rice.

I sauteed the onion & garlic in the butter, removed them (I don't like burnt garlic), browned the chops in the leftover butter, then added the onions & garlic back in with the tomatoes & spices. The rest of the recipe I followed. I loved it. It's a mild, simple, delicious flavour. The pork loin chops I used only took 1/2 hour to cook. It was excellent with rice.

This was excellent! I think it tasted better when I let it sit for 10 min. I used thinner porkchops so I didn't have to cook them as long. I didn't brown them fully, but enough to get the garlic flavoring in. I was generous on the garlic and basil, and it was yummy!

I think next time I will not cook the garlic with chops, nothing worse than burnt garlic.  I omitted the green pepper and added the onions with the tomatoes.  I added a little merlot to the sauce. Very good.

I feel bad giving this only 3 stars after all the great reviews. I followed the recipe exact except I only cooked the chops for 45min as per other reviews which said the meat came out dry. I would have cooked less time but they were just about an inch thick. Maybe I browned them too long? I browned them for about 5min each side then simmered in sauce for 45min and they were pretty dry. The sauce was very good. Served with rice and Garlic Green Beans from this site...went great together.

This was a great recipe to make.  Because this was the first time making this, I made the typical Shake & Bake just in case.  Well, to my amasement, no body touched the Shake & Bake chops.  I love the tomato taste and the spices added to it just complemented the recipe wonderfully.  I have put this into my dinner rotation.

This recipe is delicious.  The only change I would make is to add more basil.  The black pepper was the overwhelming spice taste.

My husband and I thought this to be pretty good.  I love tomatoes so we made a little more sauce and even added a touch of Worcestershire for added flavor.  I think next time I will carmelize the onions when I brown the chops and let the onions simmer the entire time.

Loved this recipe!  I used pork chops on the bone and I left out the green pepper because I didn't have one and it was GREAT.  I served it with garlic linguine.  The chops were so moist that we cut them without a knife.  I can't wait to make this again!!!!

This was a pretty simple recipe. Although, the sauce looked more appetizing before I added the corn starch. I will leave that out next time and add more salt and garlic. The chops turned out tender. I will make this again.

Really good!  Takes a while, but I was pleased with the results.  I added the onion and bell pepper in at the same time as the sauce.  Cooked it all in an electric skillet and just took the whole thing to the table.  I served this with white rice and Garlic Green Beans (from this site).

Not great.  Healthy tasting, though.  Served over brown rice and it was a filling meal.  Chops on the stove top get tough.

This was fantastically yummy.  I halved the recipe and it still worked out wonderfully.  I added extra garlic and put the onions in early as suggested by other comments and loved the result.  A new favorite for us!

These were ok. I didn't care for the sauce it seemed a bit much but lacking. I don't know, maybe it was to many tomatoes or something.

Very very tastey and a different spin from the cream of mushroom recipes.  I used two 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes in balsamic vinegar that even added to the flavors.  Thanks for an addition to my pork chop collection!

The sauce was great, but had cooked away too much by 40 minutes, remedied by adding some water and a bouillon cube.  Still came out wonderful.  I personally put the onions in with the sauce because I like them more tender.  Kids loved it, so it's a keeper.

The meat was moist, but the sauce was not very good.  Ended up serving over mashed potatoes and adding a ton of salt because it just needed it!  This recipe has caused my meat and potatoes husband to declare vegetarianism.  ...oh, dear.  We must not be big on basil or something. (used fresh tomatoes is the only change I made.) Read the reviews, thought I wouldn't go wrong.  Now I have a full pot of it in the frige & no one wants to eat it.  Boo hoo for me.

I used fresh tomato rather than canned, fresh basil rather than dried, cut out the green pepper and this turned out wonderfully. It definitely makes a ton of sauce. We had enough for a second dinner with pasta. The sauce tastes even better the next day, especially with cheese mixed in.

Delicous! This is an easy way to make pork chops in the summer when it's just too hot to put on the oven. I made this without the peppers and it was still very flavorful. We'll have this again. Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe.  I recommend searing the chops first because the garlic burns quite easily.  Otherwise, no need to change a thing - you will make this over and over again!
Enjoy as my family did.

This was ok, I don't think it was all that special.  Probably won't make it again just cause it was not very exciting....it was also a little to saucy and soupy for my familys taste.

These were great.  Very tender.  I cut the recipe in half and reduced cooking time by about 10 minutes.  I also used diced tomatoes with garlic instead of whole tomatoes for extra flavor.

I shorted the cooking time by about 15 minutes because I had a hungry family complaining.  The meat was a little bit tough, but the tomato-basil sauce was awesome!!!  I am watching what I eat, so I didn't add the corn starch, figured it was just unnecessary carbs.  Didn't miss it.  I had served some eggplant on the side, and I kept dipping the eggplant in the tomato sauce from this dish.  I took the chops to work the next day, and it's a good leftover.  I could see how this dish would also be great with chicken breasts or eggplant slices in place of the chops.  Thanks, this will be a regular.

My husband says 4 stars, but I vetoed him (I'm the one writing the reviews after all!).  I halved the recipe and left out the green pepper (didn't have one on hand).  The sauce was tasty over pasta and chops.  The chops were tender too (I used boneless ones).  Easy, good recipe since I had everything in my pantry.

This recipe was very good. Very flavorful and tender chops. I added the garlic after I browned my chops when I added my tomatoes and basil. Simmered for 20 minutes and then added my onions and peppers. Only simmered for another 10 or so since I cut the recipe in half and chops weren't quite 1/2 inch thick. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. I just thought it was really a quick meal to put together and it looked and tasted great.  Thanks.

I read the reviews before I made this and I thought it would taste great.  However, my family and I did not like it at all.  It was very bland and the sauce did not go well with the pork.  I would not recommend this dish.

I absolutly loved this recipe. It was simple, and yet a wonderful flavor and left my whole family full!  I added green, red, and yellow bell pepper, which added color as well a slightly sultry taste. (My husbasnd guessed it as a "SouthWestern Pork Chops?") I served wtih it Canned corn which could have been added during the the sauce. This definetly is a keeper.

If I could I would give this recipe 10 stars.  I have served it to family and friends three times now, and have given the recipe to three who asked for it.  My husband is a Southerner, raised on pork chops, and this is his very favorite!  I used tomatoes, basil,onions and garlic from our garden.

I absolutely loved this recipe!!!  My hubby isn't a tomato person and even he really liked it.  I served it over rotini noodles, but want to try rice next time.

This recipe made the chops very tender.  We all loved it, inclding my 3 and 6 year old.  I will make this again!  Be sure that you leave the meat in for the full amount of time.

Very good and tasty...really easy to make too!! Although the pork chops needed to cook a bit longer than suggested (and I had the thin ones).

Easy to fix.  Since I didn't want to add any thickener to it, I would suggest using a 14-1/2 oz. can diced tomatoes (without added sugar) to keep it no-carb.  I added about 1/2 c. garlic/onion pasta sauce too.  Tasted good.

What a WONDERFUL dish this was!  Served the pork chops over rice and the whole family loved it!  Even my hubby, who tends to be a bit cautious around new recipes!  Thank you!

I made this with rice and didn't get such a good response.  So I don't think I'll make it again. It seemed a like a little too much tomato and needed a little kick.

This was great!  I used red & yellow bell peppers instead of green & used diced tomatoes instead of whole, bit it was wonderful.  Very simple, elegant meal.  I will make it again.

Very good, had to make it w/thout onions (hubby hates them) and I used diced instead of whole tomatos. Meat is nice and tender, we used boneless, and the flavor goes all the way through.
