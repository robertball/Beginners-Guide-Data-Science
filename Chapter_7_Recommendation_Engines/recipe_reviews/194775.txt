this is "all egg" in the cake; leaving you with a weird, tasteless, rubbery cake- & the "mousse" is made w/ cool-whip... just not a good choice. Instead make your favorite chocolate cake & top it w/ polly welby's chocolate mousse recipe.

I felt sorry for this poor lil guy. I made this for Survivor Night(new season!) I am giving this one 4 stars only b/c the kids thought it was only OK. I liked it a lot. The baking chocolate comes in an 8oz.box,this called for 6 oz,but I used the whole box. It gave it a really good chocolate flavor.I did temper the eggs and I think the base tastes just fine.:) Thank you Kraft!
