This recipe took some time to get together, but, it was very good. The only problem I had was with the black bean mixture.  Once I added the enchilada sauce to the black beans it was a very thin soupy mixture.  I had to add another full can of black beans to thicken it and then I had a ton left over. I would just add enough enchilada sauce to the beans to be a good spreadable consistency. Next time I will also make my own enchilada sauce because I would like the flavor better than the canned sauce.  One suggestion is to wrap the bottom of your spring form pan in foil.  That way if you have any leakage it won't get all over your oven.  Also - when you warm tortillas they shrink, so, you may need to do a couple of tortillas per layer in order to fill your pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

I always make dishes according to their recipes before I make modifications.  This recipe is delicious just the way it is.  But to accommodate my personal taste, I changed the flour tortillas to corn tortillas.  This was much better as the tortillas soaked up so of the liquid.  I used the smaller tortillas so I made it in a 9 x 13 baking dish which worked just fine.  We had guacamole and chopped black olives on the side, and this made the dish absolutely perfect.

This is a great recipe.  I made it with homemade refried black beans and homemade enchilada sauce, and cooked it in a Pyrex casserole dish in a Dutch oven.  I added just enough enchilada sauce to the beans to make it a spreadable mixture, and omitted adding the 1/4 cup enchilada sauce at each layer because it seemed far too moist otherwise.  After the top tortilla, I added a layer of cheese, then covered with enchilada sauce, then sprinkled with more cheese.  This gave a beautiful marbled top to the dish.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I understand that recipes should be rated as they are written, but this recipe has a lot of good things about it and a number of things as a long seasoned cook, or even a begginer I would think about.  1) Drain the ground beef before adding all the seasonings, please cook until the taco seasoning and tomatoe juices are absorbed (more flavor).  2) go ahead and add the refried beans and some of the enchilada sauce in with the  other mixture. 3) might go ahead and add the cheese as well.  Now if it doesn't look gloopy enough, add more enchilada sauce.  Taste it before you start layering.  Is it spicy enough, not enough sauce?  Adjust as you want to.  Add more heat or not.  4)  Forget the springform pan.  Don't fry the tortillas.  Just take a casserole dish of your choice, grease it up.  Layer a bit of the meat/bean/cheese mixture on the bottom, put a layer of tortillas on top, a bit more cheese, then repeat layers as you'd like.  Bake until it's all bubbly.  Now that wasn't hard, was it?

This was fantastic... and the left overs I swear were even better. I made some changes only because i didn't have some items. But i would make as is.

Tastes fantastic, but too much ingredients - overflowed the pan and could only use 4 tortillas.

Two cans of enchilada sauce was way too much. The whole thing was extremely runny and didn't hang together at all. It tasted pretty good but looked awful. Next time I'd try not mixing any enchilada sauce with the beans, and just using the one can of sauce when layering.

I made this recipe gluten free so I used gluten free corn flour tortillas not quite the same as flour but turned out really good. I also had to use McCormick dry taco/enchilada mixes. (The canned sauce is not gluten free and I wanted to stay simple first run at making this). For the sauce I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce with a little less water and refried beans (about half a large can) but saved some sauce to put on the top without the beans to keep it a little thicker inside. I also did not have a spring form pan I used a glass 9x11 pan and very lightly greased it just enough to keep it from sticking. I will make this again I hope to make it without the dry mixes and use my own sauce mix. We always use cheddar and jack with our cheesy meals so I also added that. Really a great one dish meal take a little prep but worth it!

My family enjoyed this very much! I did not have a spring form pan so I used a 11x13 glass pan, it turned out a bit messy. Also the tortillas on the bottom stuck to my dish. I would use less enchilada sauce next time and I added refried pinto beans to the layer as well. It tasted really good and spicy, serve it with a green salad. Thanks for the recipe!

So I'm visiting my sis in New Zealand and decide to make something Mexican. Now, they have a few things at the store nowadays for Mexican food, but not a lot. I normally try to follow recipes the first time I make them. but this one proves you can substitute.  No enchilada sauce, so used two cans of Mexican diced tomatoes, one added to the meat and one to the bean mixture. They had random spicy black beans and one of pinto beans. Used one can of each. They were saucy, so didn't dry out mixture.  Crunched up spicy tortilla chips as the tortilla layer.  Used cheddar, they don't have Jack. Voila, it  was a hit!  Crazy. Will make again at home.

This was very good, and I'll make it  again.  If everyone else in my family likes it as much as I do! The only problem is how the recipe is written.  I had to read it a couple times, then decided to do what I always do and thankful I did.  I have been cooking for years, so I know that you should always drain the fat off of browned meat, and if you don't drain the tomatoes and the black beans before adding  you would defiantly have a soupy mess once your enchilada sauce is added.  Younger folks just learning to cook would not know these little things and maybe this wouldn't turn out so good.   I did all the draining and mine was still very runny, but I it was delicious!

Great recipe!  Has been over 25 years since I last made an Enchilada Pie but this is a great recipe which refreshed my memory - not only of the preparation involved but the final meal.  Everyone has loved it.  As some others have already noted, the details of the recipe are "flexible":  I made a completely Gluten Free version since my wife has Celiac disease.   Use corn tortilla's (vs. flour) and know your ingredient list.  To "kick up the flavor a notch" I also used San Marzano chopped tomato's, made my own Enchilada Sauce and used my own seasoning mix (I adjust "heat" of spices to my guests preferences).  Additionally, I used Rosarita Pinto beans w/no added enchilada sauce - Rosarita pinto's are so creamy & flavorful you will not need to add any sauce.  I also baked in a deep, uncovered Pyrex dish (loosely covered in tinfoil).  After 30 minutes, I removed the foil, kicked the oven temp. up to 420f to get the cheese bubbling and - voila' -  a GREAT enchilada pie!

This was a super easy and very authentic tasting enchilada dish. I was short on time so I swapped the canned tomatoes and chili's with a 50/50 mix of hot & mild chunky salsa from a jar...I used 15 ounces as recommended which worked beautifully.  Also, I couldn't find shredded pepper jack cheese so I used 80% 4-blend Mexican shredded cheese and 20% shredded sharp cheddar and it came out amazing!!! Also, I removed the foil in the last 10 minutes of baking. My foil stuck to the cheese so remember to spray your foil with nonstick spray before baking to avoid this

Loved it,  but cut down to 3 cups of cheese, and one can of enchilada sauce, used 1/2 can for the mixture, and the other half was enough for the layering.  Enjoy!!

Would not make again. The tortillas soaked up all the liquid so it lacked sauce, tortillas stuck to pan and due I think to the pre crisping and then baking, the tortillas came out real hard in some spots and chewy in others. Did not look pretty at all coming out of oven

Made this for a crowd recently. I made my own enchilada sauce and added seasonings and diced tomatoes to my beans and ran them quickly thru the food processor and mine werent runny at all. Got rave reviews by those who ate it. I would recommend to serve it with homemade taco sauce and the sour cream on the side
