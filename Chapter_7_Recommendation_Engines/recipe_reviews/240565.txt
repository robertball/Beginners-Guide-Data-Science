Couldn't be easier! I only had vanilla cake mix, which was fine. Made exactly 24 cookies. I left them in a little longer because the edges didn't brown, but it didn't hurt. Moist, cake-like cookies. Great last-minute treat with tons of options for customizing and easy clean up! My eggs were jumbo and my oil was canola.

I made  these this morning using lemon cake mix and white chips I doubled the recipe and added 2 teaspoons of baking powder  ( only because I had read a recipe that added baking powder so thought I would give it a try)and 2 teaspoons of lemon extract I also put the dough in the refrigerator for about an hour, rolled them in powdered sugar and they turned out perfect, chewy in the middle and  moist and did not taste like cake mix. I cannot wait to try different flavors.  Great recipe thanks for sharing!

I’ve been using Allrecipes forever and this is my first review because these cookies are AMAZING! I made them EXACTLY as directed and they came out PERFECT! Devils food cake mix with white chocolate chips. YUM! Will definitely be making these again as they are a huge time saver and they’re delicious!

These were a nice, quick, and easy cookie to throw together.  I've had a box of yellow cake mix needing used and this fit the bill perfectly.  Now, they're never going to compete with a traditional ccc recipe, but they are tasty, nonetheless.  I yield about 30 cookies, scooped with my small (TBSP?) scooper.  THANKS, for the recipe!

added 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  We liked the texture of these and it was quick and easy to make.

Made lemon cookies with butterscotch chips. Came out fantastic! I will make cookies again, and try different flavors. This was a great, easy peasy  idea for cookies!

The flavor and texture are yummy. I made recipe as written. The only thing that I'm confused about is it said to roll them in 12 balls. They ended up being huge! I think it could've made 24 smaller cookies instead. Otherwise, good recipe.

I used chocolate cake mix, 15.25 oz. (all I had on hand) and dark choc. ships and pecans, (again all that was available).
It made 36 small cookies.   All was good, but tasted a little cake like.

Great flavor and texture. I used a chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips instead and they turned out great.

These turned out great! At first I didn’t think they would turn out because I don’t have chocolate chips but I just rolled mine in powdered sugar and they made great little cookies!

Simple & tasty. I used Triple chocolate cake  mix, 1/2 C oil. 2 lg eggs, 2 tsp water & 1 C andes mint chips. Ten mins in 350 degree oven. I did drop by tsp & press down with little greased glass bottom. Exactly 24 cookies my husband loved. He did mention that it was plenty of mints too. I warned him too many would make him sick, lol. He never listens! I will make again but with chocolate chips & walnuts.

I noticed your picture of this recipe shows chocolate cookies with what appears to be white chocolate chips so that's what I used.  Great easy cookies.
