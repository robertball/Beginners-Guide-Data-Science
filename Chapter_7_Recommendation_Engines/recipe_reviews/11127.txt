My kid's and I love to make these. They make great gifts after the kid's have decorated. I did add 2 tbls of "Mod Podge" glue so they don't crumble. I find this brand works better than white glue.

These make great gifts at the holidays. You can paint the finished cutouts and hang them anywhere you want an apple cinnamon scent. They are especially nice in the car. To the person who thought the mix was too wet simply add some more cinnamon. They last for years.

I used this in my classroom of 2 & 3 year olds. GREAT!! The whole preschool smelled fantastic. Easy. Keeps for days if sealed in a ziplock bag. Dried well-some curling. We used a sharpie to write names and dates on the backs of our ornaments. We will definately use this again.

I've made this "playdough" for years. Adding some other spices to it lends for some great smelling ornaments. Cloves and allspices are great. You can even use whole cloves to decorate your creations. This year we are planning on making them again. I might add some essential oil to the mixture as well.

Another great idea is to cut rectangles of dough and roll to resemble a cinnamon stick. I use these in my boxes of decorations to keep them smelling great while in storage. It works like a charm.

The recipe was a little "wet". When I baked off the ornaments they stuck to the cookie sheet and some of them broke. I bet if you used a little cooking spray or a Silpat liner it would work a little better. The ornaments smell delicious though!

This dough is fun and easy to make. The smell of the cinnamon even helps give the room a fragrance. They are wonderful but fragile.

My 4 year old nephew loved doing this! The dough was easy for him to roll out on his own too(the best part to a 4 year old!) The only problem i found was that he wanted to use more intricate cookie cutter and they fell apart so stick with the simple trees stars hearts etc. My house smells fantastic too!

Few changes to the recipe. First I used all spice because it's a good mix of spices. Secondly the mix was a little dry so i used 250ml of apple sauce instead.when I rolled it out all it did was stick to my work top so i used a little flower it does make the mix a little white but when u paint it it won't matter. They are a little fragile and did fall apart but do smell lovely

need to add in different proportions sometimes. hard to use very detailed cutters but good with big/simple ones.

This is such a great recipe I have been looking for it thank you for posting. A couple of things: to get a more solid dough I added equal parts cinnamon and applesauce. They are fragile so simplistic shapes are best. Also if you don't mind losing some of the cinnamon smell as a trade for preservation coat them in a thin glaze of white glue after they have dried. thanks again!

I love this recipe. It is so easy my 9 year old made it with little supervision. It was such an accomplishment for him. We love the smell they produce throughout the season.
