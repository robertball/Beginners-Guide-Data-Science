If you double the ginger to two tablespoons, change the sugar to brown and add a tablespoon of cornstarch, it's a yummier recipe and the salt factor isn't as overwhelming- plus it sticks to the food rather than pooling around the chicken.

Very good.  I don't keep cooking sherry around, so I subbed 2 tbsp chicken broth and 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar (I think you could use any "sweet" vinegar).  Very good as a marinade for chicken.  We make this all the time - it's our "go to" meal (usually put on chicken) when we are craving Chinese type food.

Didnâ€™t have cooking sherry so we substituted rice wine vinegar.  Very good & flavorful base sauce that would pair well w/ any poultry, meat, fish or vegetable.  Easy!

This was so simple to throw together. I marinated chicken in it. I then used some of the reserved sauce in my stir fry along with the chicken. This is much better than the same old boring soy sauce used in most stir fry recipes. Will make again and again!

This had very good flavor, but was way too salty - next time I will probably use at least 1/4 less soy, maybe 1/2 and supplement with veggie stock.

I found this awesome recipe a few months back and finally had to rate it.  I've made it over and over again.  It's so easy to make since I always have all the ingredients on hand and it's delicious as well!  I always have some in the fridge since we use it often.

I substituted vinegar and chicken broth for the sherry as other reviewers suggested and this turned out really well. Very tasty and moist chicken breasts from the grill! Will use this recipe again, but may use reduced salt soy sauce as it was a bit salty.

i will def use this again!!!! my family loved it! i tried making teriyaki from scratch plenty of times with "HONTERI"- never eeven close to as good as this! the only change i made is i used kikkoman teriyaki marinade instead of soy sauce. its basically the same thing with some added ingredients "onion powder, garlic powder, spices"....un-freekin believable. i used thin cuts of tri-tip, and boneless chicken boob..barely marinated it for 30 minutes, and pan cooked it, when it cooked dry i added more marinade...SO GOOD!!! served with egg rolls and white rice- i def use it again...

Great Recipe! What I really like about it is that you can easily alter it to suit your tastes. When I first made it I realized that like some other reviewers mentioned, something seemed not quite right. So, I added an additional 1-2 teaspoons of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar. Perfect! After whisking all ingredients together I used 1/4 cup to marinade about a half pound of precut stir fry steak strips I bought in the store, and I plan to add a little cornstarch to the remaining and use it for the sauce in my stir-fry tonight. Yum!

I used brown sugar and added about a TBS of cornstarch.  I marinated steak tips for a few hours, and they came out lick-the-platter-clean great!  We can't wait to try this one again!

I thought I had teriyaki sauce, but I didn't so I looked for a simple recipe that I had all the ingredients for and I found this one. I have to say it was absolutely delicious as a marinade for chicken and my guys loved it in their burgers.  This is fast, easy and most people have these basic ingredients in their pantry. I will definitely be using this again when something calls for teriyaki.  Thanks Judy for sharing this great sauce!

I keep this marinade in the fridge so we can use it frequently as either a dipping sauce for salmon (I like it with panko crusted salmon) or as a marinade for chicken.  I like it best in the crock with chicken and green beans (I use frozen green beans)-they come out so unbelievably tasty!!!    And don't change a thing...it is great just the way it is written!

This was good.  I used reduced-sodium soy sauce because we're sensitive to salt, added an extra teaspoon of sugar and used freshly grated ginger.  I cut a pork tenderloin into 1-inch slices and marinated overnight in this sauce.  Then I grilled the pork on our GF grill and boiled the sauce on the stovetop and reduced it so we could use it as a sauce over brown rice.  I think the next time I may try using brown sugar instead of white.

I decided to hunt down a recipe for teriyaki sauce when I was in the middle of something that called for it (Anniversary Chicken I from this site).  I usually just sub soy sauce.  It tastes like a very tangy soy sauce, and soy sauce is already tangy.  (Word of advice: just cook with it and don't "taste test" it like I did -- took a while to shake that one off. :-))  I did a bit of reading to see how authentic this was, and looks as though the soy sauce to sherry ratio is way high.  Sherry isn't authentic but a reasonable substitute.  But THEN I looked at the stuff in the store later and most of it was pretty "fake" anyway.  So I figure, even if it isn't exactly what you'd find in a Japanese restaurant, it's still a lot like what you'd find in a typical store.  It came in handy when I needed it, and worked well in the recipe, so it gets a 5.

I made this recipe two ways cutting the portion size back to two.  One using the white sugar and the other using the brown sugar. It flavored the chicken breast nicely and I don't feel I have to purchase teriyaki sauce again.  The blsl chicken breast that I marinated in the brown sugar definitely had a richer flavor than the one I marinated in the white sugar. The sauce made as is, is thin, but if you want it to thicken up, boil on the stovetop and add two tablespoon of water mixed with one tablespoon of cornstarch.  Pour slowing, while stirring in the boiling sauce.  If using to marinate raw meat, cool completely before adding the meat.  Made with the white sugar this is a 4-star recipe, made with brown sugar a 5-star recipe. I used this to marinade the chicken in the recipe 'Grilled Wonton Chicken Salad' from AR.

This was so easy to make! I don't keep cooking sherry on-hand so I used rice vinegar instead and it was perfect! I also only had time to marinate the meat I was using for about 45 min but the meat still had a wonderful flavor! This will definitely be going in my favorite recipe book!

This recipe is a good base, but I agree with some of the others that vinegar makes it even better.  I prepared it as written, but then added 2 Tablespoons of vinegar once I tasted it.  It just needed a tangy element.

Not the best on the planet, but it gets 4 starts for being easy and using ingredients I would actually have on hand on any given day.  Used this as part of another recipe tonight and it turned out quite good.

After reading all the reviews, I did reduce the amount of soy sauce as I historically have found most recipes I've made too salty.  I replaced a little less than half of required soy with low sodium vegetable broth.  I also used rice wine vinegar in place of the sherry.  I also replaced the sugar with honey.  Yeah, I pretty much bastardized this recipe, but it gave me a good foundation for tweaks and it worked for me so I rated it 5 stars.

Great tasting sauce. I thickened it a little with 2 teaspoons cornstarch.  Also used reduced sodium soy sauce. It made a perfect glaze for meatballs. This is a versatile quick recipe that I will use often.

I use this recipe every time a recipe calls for Teriyaki Sauce.  Way more convenient than having to keep a bottle on hand for the odd chance that I need it.  I replace the cooking sherry with water.

Quick, Easy and Tasty.  I used Madeira wine because I didn't have any Sherry.  I made this for Slow Cooker Pork Tenderloin from this site.  Everyone loved the sauce that I made with this teriyaki.

I know some people that simmer their sauce on the stove top  for a bit.  I may try this next time and see how it works out as a dipping sauce.

Great quick sauce I whipped up for some home-made basmati rice & stir-fried veggies. Used white wine instead of sherry, minced ginger root in the place of ground, and doubled the garlic. Yum!

This was really good. Since I did not have the sherry, I used red wine viinegar. Very simple, easy recipe.

Exactly what I was looking for!  We all know how American's love their sugar, so of course I did add 1/2 Tbsp more of sugar.  I didn't have sherry, so I added a little orange juice instead.  I'm sure it's even better with the sherry.

Easy, quick and tasty.  I changed the recipe to 1/3 c. soy sauce and 1/3 c. chicken broth instead of the full 2/3 c. soy sauce and it was still too salty for us.  Next time I would add even less soy sauce, maybe 1/4 c.  I'll be using this recipe on days when I need a quick meal with a bag of frozen stirfry veggies with some bite-sized chicken, and rice.  Thanks for submitting!

Never use "cooking sherry" in recipes. Use real sherry,such as  Fairbanks or Taylor. The cooking sherry is loaded with salt. Besides it's nasty.

Perfect just as it is. Cut up a pork shoulder butt, ("country style spare ribs") into 2-3" squares, marinated for several hours and grilled over charcoal. Meanwhile, thickened the leftover marinade with corn starch, brushed it thickly over the pork when it came off the grill. Raves all around the table.

This was okay.  I tasted it after mixing it and decided it needed about 2 Tbsp Sucanat, 3 Tbsp. rice wine vinegar, and 1/3 cup pineapple juice.  Then it was juuuuuuust about perfect.

Very basic and delicious and easy sauce.  If you are using Kikoman Soy sauec it may be too salty, and you should either use light soy, or use half soy and half water like me!  Tasted great after that and I used it as part of the Teriyaki and Pineapple Chicken recipe found here!

Last night I was in a pinch and needed teriyaki sauce. OMG! This is so good. I heated it in a sauce pan to help the sugar dissolve, while I stir fried some veggies and noodles, and this was great. I even added some red pepper flakes for a kick. You will never buy teriyaki sauce again!

Tried it on my teriyaki chicken and it was overpoweringly salty and just poor flavor. If this is just a marinade, it shouldn't say sauce! Had rinse off our chicken and used BBQ instead.

Holy cow this was so salty. I followed others' advice and used brown sugar instead of white, increased the amount of ginger, and used half soy sauce and half veggie stock. The soy sauce though, still overpowered all the other favors. Next time I will use a teriyaki marinade base, as this was just barely  reaching teriyaki flavor for me.

I felt that this sauce was way too salty. I added A LOT of brown suagar to try to counteract the saltyness. It didn't exactly do the trick so I wouldn't make this sauce again.

This was much too salty.  Cut soy sauce back by about half of what is called for.  I took some of the soy and added 1 Tbsp. cornstarch, heated the rest of the ingredients and added the corn starch/soy mixture in when it came to a boil.  It made the perfect thickness of sauce for my chicken.  I will make this again, but I will cut back on the soy.

At first, the sauce seemed a little off to me (maybe too salty).  But after letting it sit in the fridge for a few days and allowing the garlic add more of its flavor to the sauce, it was perfect!  We will definitely be keeping this in the fridge all the time!

I thought this was a great recipe. I did use chicken broth instead of the cooking sherry. I also used brown sugar rather than white. I put it all in a pan heated and throw in some cut up chicken and mushrooms. Very good! Could not quit eating it.

Wanted to make a steak recipe that called for teriyaki sauce so I found this. I used 2 T apple cider vinegar (because it's what I had) and 2 T chicken bouillon instead of wine.  Very tasty.  New go-to recipe.

What a great and easy recipe. I make it on the healthy side though. Instead of soy sauce I used Bragg Liquid Aminos (a soy sauce alternative) and used splenda instead of sugar. My boyfriend, who is very picky, said the teriyaki sauce had a really great flavor. For him to say that it had to be really good.

Very good! Substituted white wine vinegar for the sherry and it was still ok. Probably would cut back a smidge on the soy sauce.

I do not even buy the bottled teriyaki sauce anymore! This is easy to make and I have substituted the sherry cooking wine with rice vineger in a pinch. I have also used powdered garlic in place of fresh, and it is fine. I also add finely sliced green onion tops. It came out wonderful and earned approval from picky friends. We used it for a dipping sauce for pot stickers.

Great recipe, I used it to make teryaki chicken sanwiches with provalone and pinapple rings.  I could only marinate for an hour, but it still tasted great!

Made this last night for a flank steak stir fry. I added about 2 Tablespoons of orange juice and 1 Tablespoon of corn starch to thicken it. Otherwise, followed as directed and it made an excellent sauce for the stir fry and rice/farro mixture. Thanks for posting!

This is a great base, but would recommend some modifications. It definitely benefits from 1 T. Cornstarch to thicken, otherwise it will be quite watery. I doubled the garlic and used lime juice instead of sherry. You could also substitute honey or brown sugar for the white sugar. Play with it and make it your own!

Love this recipe, after a few times found the perfect combo, low sodium soy sauce, brown sugar instead of white and a good dash of sesame oil, the longer you marinate the better

I doubled this recipe and used brown sugar instead of white. Also added another teaspoon of ginger, then split mixture in half and froze one for future use.  I took the other half and added a cup of orange juice, brought to a boil and thickened with corn starch

This was pretty good. I was making teriyaki burgers and realized that I had forgotten to by teriyaki marinade. I didn't want to go back to the store, so I decided to make my own marinade. This worked well. If I ever make this again I will probably add a little brown sugar, just because I think it would work well and cut down on the saltiness.

Do NOT make this as a side for rice or for a topping to your teriyaki chicken. As a marinade? I'm sure it's great. Giving 3 stars because I hate rating a recipe badly but this is really a marinade, not a sauce. Maybe with low sodium soy sauce it would have worked better?

Made this last night for teriyaki chicken and vegetables and it was really much better than I had expected. I had to make a few changes: I didnâ€™t have sherry so I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and substituted it with rice wine vinegar and exchanged white sugar with brown. Also, I ran out of soy sauce so I used a bland teriyaki sauce as the base. Delicious!

To help reduce the saltiness that many reviewers note, use "less sodium" soy sauce, rather than regular. But do understand that even reduced sodium soy sauce is also a very high sodium ingredient. Two-thirds of a cup of one prominent national brand (over 10 tablespoons), the amount called for by this recipe, adds more than 5750 mg of sodium to this recipe (compared to more than 9200 mg of sodium for the same amount of their regular soy sauce). So use a lot less of either & compensate with water. And, no, there's no such thing as "low sodium" soy sauce, although people refer to it that way all the time in their recipes & comments on this site. (Read that label again!) Also, use real sherry rather than salted cooking sherry. Because its alcohol content is higher than that of regular wines, sherry is already a shelf-stable product that won't spoil after it's opened, so it doesn't need salt added as a preservative. And you can keep it around for future use.

I made it with brown sugar and it was much better. I will put some corn starch in it as another reviewer suggested next time. A very good sauce. Tried it on shrimp and scallops, will try it on more meat.

Wonderful sauce! After the first time making this I did tweet it a bit. My wife and I like a bit sweeter of a teriyaki sauce. I did what user APRILASINAPRIL did and changed to brown sugar instead of white, and added a tablespoon of corn starch, but I also doubled the brown sugar amount to 4 tablespoons. I know that's a lot but it's how my wife and I liked it. I kept the ginger amount the same though. Easy way to make an awesome sauce!

I followed recommendations to use brown sugar in place of white,  increased the ginger and added cornstarch.  It will be my go to recipe for teriyaki sauce.  Thank you for a great, quick and easy sauce, better than store bought.

Excellent! Only substituted brown sugar for white because I feel it tastes better in teriyaki dressings.

I had to sub rice vinegar for the sherry like others, but all I could taste was soy sauce. I added more sugar and honey, and some chile paste and it turned out okay. Won't make again.

This is my favorite Teriyaki sauce recipe. I have made it with light brown sugar besides using white sugar as stated in the recipe. It always gets compliments either when used as a marinade or a dipping sauce.

No sherry so I used some cheap chardonnay instead. Perfectly delicious sauce for simmering Thai rice stick noodles to make Mongolian BBQ.

This was a last minute substitute for the real thing. Although it sufficed for the night, it's not a favorite and I'll only make this again if I'm in a bind once more.

Made 3 servings (used 1/2 amt of Harveys Bristol Cream Sherry (non-cooking style - all I had on hand) and used on 2 BBQ'd salmon steaks (generous amout of marinade - enough to add to rice for 2). Yummy!

Used in another recipe and it worked out perfect. I will use this in other teriyaki recipes.
