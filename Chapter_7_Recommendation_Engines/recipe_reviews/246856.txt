We thought it was great! Messy to make but so what. It's a keeper for us very tasty not bland the way I made it. try using Mexican cheddar cheese too.adds to the taste. use 23 shells too fits better in a 13 9 pan. Also double the sauce recipe for the top of the shells. a tip from me I put tooth picks on top of shells after I put cheese on the top of the shells to keep from sticking worked well too. Hope you enjoy!

These were a little messy to stuff and not too pretty to look at but the taste was excellent. I never would have thought to add refried beans to my ground beef but I really liked it. The leftovers reheat nicely as well. Very tasty recipe and one I will make again!

This was a pretty good casserole, definitely something different. It was very messy to make, about halfway through fighting with the shell stuffing part of this recipe I placed the rest of the mixture into a large storage bag, cut the corner and piped the rest into the shells. That worked much better and was not as messy. I would also triple the sauce recipe for the top.....someone said double but I ended up making a triple batch for a 9x12.  I would not make this a menu staple but would make it for guests, potluck, etc.

In my opinion this was just okay. Too much work for how it turned out. I like my Mexican food spicy and even with the taco mix it was kind of bland. It also reminded me of a layer Mexican casserole I have made with tortillas. (much easier to make). If you do not like hot and spicy you might like this---presentation is great!

It's a good base recipe for Mexican stuffed shells. I would make it again though I would probably add something to give it more kick.
