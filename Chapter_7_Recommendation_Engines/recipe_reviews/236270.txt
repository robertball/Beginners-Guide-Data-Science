This recipe is simple and excellent! Maybe a little sweeter than what I am used to but not too sweet for most people I am certain. What I really loved is how the bacon flavor came though but how it was strained and removed so there wasn't the texture to deal with. It's hard to believe how full bodied this tasted for such a short cook time. Impressive and 5 stars all the way!
