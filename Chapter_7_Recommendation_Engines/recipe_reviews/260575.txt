Made these almond biscotti and they turned out delicious! I followed the recipe accordingly and followed Chef John's instructions per the video and couldn't be happier with the way these turned out. The instructions were easy to follow and the breaking process matched the results of the video. I will definitely be making these throughout the holidays. I am thinking of dipping these in chocolate for added flare but all is said and done, really happy with this recipe and would definetely recommend this recipe to anyone looking for easy recipes for the holidays.

Fabulous!  I have made this 3x now, exactly as written.  I doubled the recipe the last time because the first two batches I made were gone too quick!  Thank you for another great recipe, Chef John!

I also tried it with a couple experiments, with the following results:
- Whole grain wheat flour: works well
- Coconut oil: about the same, but a little less crunch
- Brown sugar: you lose a lot of crunch, more of a cookie texture
- Flax seed "egg:" good vegan mod, but you lose some crunch.

Made these thinking if they turned out i could give them as Christmas gifts. They turned out but they never made it to life as a gift. Now I have to make more. I followed instructions exactly and my biscotti turned out amazing and looked just like the photo. My almonds were raw so I roasted them for 15 minutes at 350' to dry roast them before using in the recipe. really good even without coffee but dipping  them took them to a whole new level of delicious. Exactly as advertised and easy to make I am going to make my second batch this afternoon in hopes of some making it under the tree ... wish me luck.

I used chopped hazelnuts in place of the almonds, and kept everything else as stated in the recipe. I loved the tips in the video about shaping the loaves in plastic wrap. I've made biscotti many times before, but always used a floured board and floured hands to shape the logs. The plastic wrap trick worked great! These are delicious dipped in a nice cappuccino for a mid-afternoon snack! Thanks Chef John!

These biscotti have  just the right amount of sweetness. I was a little bit worried with how much almond extract was going in  because it has a really strong smell, but once it's all mixed it's the perfect amount. It seemed like mine were getting a little too much color in each stage of the baking, so next time I'll try going at a lower temperature.

Delicious and easy to make. I might try using a bit less sugar next time. They’re not overly sweet. I just like my biscotti less sweet than, say, a cookie.

I never made biscottis before but they’re my moms fave so I wanted to try them out for our coffee and tea. I don’t even like biscottis but these are delicious! I did t have almond extract so I just did vanilla in place of it. Mine came out a little darker than I would have hoped but I didn’t have a silicone mat either so I’m sure that was the reason. I definitely want to make these again! Thanks for the helpful video!!

I've made this a couple of times now and these always turn out wonderfully. I've made them with just almonds as well as with white chocolate and macadamia nuts and both variations were great.

First time making biscotti and this recipe was so easy to follow. I didn’t have roasted almonds so I used chocolate covered almonds and crushed those... worked great! I put them in the oven the second time for less then the recipe suggested. One I have a “hot” oven and two I don’t like them so dried out. Thanks for another great and easy recipe to follow Chef John. The videos are always helpful to watch before making the recipe too!

Just made this to give to my neighbors for Christmas. First batch I cooked for 30 minutes, but it was a bit undercooked. 2nd batch I left in for an extra 5 minutes; turned out better. I also left it in longer to golden brown for the toasting period. Great recipe, only thing I would change next time is the amount of sugar. I'll play around a bit as the cup and a tablespoon is too sweet for me.

Dipped in white and dark chocolate for presentation!

These were so easy and soooo good.  I did large chop all my almonds because whole almonds are a little hard to slice through.  Excellent with coffee.  I can't wait to make them for this Christmas.

I added 1 tsp vanilla to wet ingredients. I then split the wet mixture and 1/2 the flour mix to make two doughs. To one I added 1tsp almond extract and 3/4 c whole almonds and a 1/4 c sliced almonds and formed a loaf.
To the second mixture I added 3/4 c each of chocolate chips and roasted hazelnuts and formed that loaf (using floured hands). I will use this recipe again and again.

Only change I made was  adding a splash of Anise extract and I omitted the zest.  2nd  time making these. I love biscotti so I save money making them at home.

Amazing. First time I’ve ever made biscotti. Amazing. I just didn’t put it back in oven after wards so it wasn’t as crunchy. I’ll be making tonnes for Christmas.
