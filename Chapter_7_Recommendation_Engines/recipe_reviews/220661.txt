This is the best vegetarian burger I've ever made! When I cook with quinoa, I usually use 1 part Quinoa to 2 parts water, so I double-checked the website where this recipe originated. It calls for 3/4 cup cooked quinoa, so you might want to adjust your recipe accordingly. Definitely worth a try!

I used 3/4 of a cup of quinoa and got 8 regular sized patties, but I actually think 1/2 cup of quinoa is enough. I put them in the oven at 400 for 30 min. and they came out crunchy and tasty. I did not have yellow bell pepper so I used tomato, and garlic powder since I did not have garlic either. This recipe is very forgiving in terms of ingredients.

I was so excited about making these. This is my first attempt at making a veggie burger and they turned out great. Only made some small changes: I always use chicken stock instead of water to cook my quinoa. Substituted shredded carrot for the bell pepper, used 1 teaspoon of minced garlic, 2 teaspoons of Crystal hot sauce and used 1/2 2 egg portion of Egg Beaters instead of 1 egg. I baked first then browned in skillet w/olive oil. I melted thinly sliced low-fat cheddar cheese on top to get that 'cheeseburger' experience. Served on whole wheat toasted bread with mustard, tomato and spinach. DELICIOUS!

Big Hit! These veggie burgers turned out better then any store bought variety, and even though I'm not a vegetarian (the boyfriend is) these were very satisfying. As others suggested I used oats rather then bread crumbs which made the consistency easy to cook and eat (as well as not adding too much sodium to the mix).  I cooked the quinoa with a quarter cube of vegetarian bullion, and topped the burgers with homemade guacamole,  fresh tomatoes and spring mix and served them on whole wheat kaiser rolls. Overall a very excellent recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe! I read several reviews/suggestions first to help me adapt what I had on hand, and the recipe is, as pointed out by several, totally forgiving.  I doubled the cooked quinoa amount, subbed old-fashioned rolled oats for bread crumbs, had to use reconstituted Penzey minced onion since I was out of fresh, and to make it VEGAN, I simply used 1 TBL ground chia seed mixed with 3 TBL water to replace the egg.  The 1st time I made these, I had to use part green pepper and part red non-hot peppers growing in my deck containers, worked beautifully.  Today, I actually had a yellow pepper, and I doubled the recipe using 1 can black beans and 1 can kidney beans (adds a nice reddish color), still used whole rolled oats and chia-egg sub.....the Frank's Hot Sauce is just the perfect amount, adds a lot of character with the cumin, without being too spicy.  Be sure to mix with hands as suggested. This recipe is a KEEPER.  I doubled it today in hopes of having enough to freeze, if my husband does not eat them all today!

These are delicious and forgiving.  Used green pepper (all I had) and rolled oats in place of bread crumbs (what I had).  Chopped up some parsley and cilantro and added that for some color.  Baked rather than fried.  Served with sliced tomatoes, sliced red onion and sliced avocados with a little lime juice.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I decided to make these burgers because I had most of the ingredients, I love black beans and I'm trying out quinoa recipes.  All I have to say is they are absolutely delicious! I made them for my meat-loving husband and loved them! They are very filling too. I could only eat one and my husband had to work to finish two! This recipe was immediately added to the recipe book :)

These were the best bean burgers ever (way better than any I'd ever purchased or made myself.) You could make this to suit your own tastes, or to  use what you have on hand. I subbed a can of organic navy beans for the black beans, used 1/2 of a green pepper instead of yellow, upped the onion and garlic, and ground some organic stuffing mix in my mini food processor to replace the bread crumbs (I also doubled the bread to make sure they would bind together.) I added about 2 teaspoons of vegetarian worchester sauce, and left out the cumin. I also subbed the egg with ground flax seed (works every time!) Then I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes per side. I got 5 nice sized burgers, and served them on homemade buns.

I've never had vegetarian burgers before, so I was kind of skeptical. But since I (like usual) was looking for a recipe to use extra pantry items (black beans, bread crumbs), I was excited to discover that these were great! They are much healthier than "regular" burgers, plus they are WAY cheaper. We used organic everything for ingredients, and there's no way it would come close to the cost of organic meat! The cumin & hot sauce was a delicious extra!

I make this recipe regularly and I don't know how it couldn't make any kind of eater a fan. Reviews that tell of its flavorlessness might be underutilizing their spice rack! You can really build on this recipe quite a bit, but I think it's perfect and hearty just as written. For the breadcrumbs, you can use similar measurement of flax meal, as well as throw in some chia seeds (I'd say no more than a tablespoon) to add even more fiber and Omega 3s. I also love using Ritz crackers, which are accidentally vegan, so you could make this whole recipe vegan with an egg substitute (flaxmeal works like this as well). I've done several kinds of peppers too. Top with mashed avocado, eat alone with a slice of cheese, put on top of salad greens or burger it up. Definitely, definitely try this very very healthy, hearty recipe. Thanks for this!

This recipe is exceptional!!  I made it exactly according to the recipe, except I doubled it.  Then I baked the patties on a cookie sheet at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.  Finally I turned the broiler on for a few minutes until they browned, then flipped over and browned the other side.  
I can’t tell you how much the whole family loved these burgers.  We topped with spicy mustard, ketchup, sautéed apple/onion mix, avocado and spinach.  This has been added to the keeper recipe box and will become a regular staple meal at our house.

The best black bean burger recipe I've ever had!   Used red peppers (not yellow) because that was what I had.   Otherwise followed the recipe except omitted the vegetable oil and baked the patties as recommended by another reviewer.  (At 400 degrees on a cookie sheet with a touch of spray oil.)  Also used Sriracha hot chili sauce which I had on land.  This is my new go to vegetarian bean burger recipe.   I love it!

I made these exactly as the recipe states and also tried baking them in the oven and they were awesome!  So good I made them again as soon as I ran out!  I wrapped them in lettuce and put tomato slices on them to skip the bun.  I actually like them hot or cold.  SOO GOOD!  I tried them with bread crumbs and oatmeal and felt they tasted about the same either way.  I stopped putting the hot pepper sauce in it because most of them have MSG in them and instead added some cayenne pepper.  Tastes the same and no MSG!

This recipe needs 10 stars, it was so good that it's hard to believe it's a vegetarian dish. I served it in a whole wheat tortilla, with coleslaw made of a little mayonnaise the cabbage lime juice and a smidge of sugar. this dish is definitely one to make again.
Awesome awesome awesome. my husband and son absolutely loved it

This is the first thing I've made with Quinoa. They are fantastic - and that's coming from a pure carnivore. I made them exactly like the recipe except that I subbed green pepper for yellow bell. The second time I subbed jalapeno for the yellow bell. They were both great. They freeze really well and thaw in no time. I will be making these for years to come.

These burgers were amazing! Here are some recommendations: bread crumbs are VERY easy to make, find a good recipe and make your own. Packaged breadcrumbs usually have too many preservatives. I used nine grain bread from Wholefoods and I got a really nice flavor. I also added 1 tablespoon of basil when mixing my crumbs. To my bean quinoa mixture, I left off the hot sauce and used 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. 
Also before mashing your beans, dry them first, this will keep your burgers from falling apart when you cook them.

This is the best bean burger recipe I have ever tried! Believe me I have tried so many with great disappointment every time. I didn't have any quinoa on hand but had cooked brown rice. I used it and it worked just fine. Added in a half of diced jalapeno pepper I had too. Really, really good! This is a keeper recipe :-))

Great taste and consistency. For a slightly fuller flavour, I added 1tsp Worcestershire Sauce to this recipe.

I used bread crumbs as called for in the recipe, but they were from a whole wheat loaf I'd made myself. I put a piece of the bread in a food processor for a few seconds to pulverise it.

I baked/grilled the patties in the oven, eliminating the need for oil.

For the last couple of minutes in the oven, I top each of the patties with with a slice of pineapple and a slice of swiss cheese (my favourite toppings) and served with some curry ketchup.

First, to clear up any confusion, vegetarians DO eat eggs and dairy. Vegans do not. That being said, these patties are amazing! I used 1/2 cup quinoa and replaced the water with vegetable broth. Added some jalapenos and cilantro to the mix. Sliced up some tortillas into strips and speayed them with olive oil cooking spray, a litttle lime juice, cumin, salt and pepper. Baked everything in the oven until crispy. Served over salad greens with sweet lime vinegarette. Yum!

This is a great base recipe for any kind of veggie burger.  Adding 1/2 cup diced mushrooms was delicious, and baking them at 400 for 30 minutes (flipping them halfway through) made these perfect for sandwiches, burgers, or crumbled over salads!

i don't understand. i followed the recipe as written but none of my 'burgers' stuck together. they crumbled almost before i put them in the pan. it ended up being more like a stir fry :( i'm willing to try again though.

These beanie burgers are quick and simple to make, provide high quality protein, have a firm texture, and taste mighty good. Rather than water, used chicken stock for cooking the quinoa. Used panko for the bread crumbs. To brown the patties on the outside, lightly misted a pan w/ olive oil to avoid using 3 tablespoons of oil per the recipe. The patties held firmly together while cooking but I dried the beans with a paper towel after rinsing and draining them, and also placed the patties in the freezer for 15 minutes before cooking them. Like some other reviewers commented, the cooked patties tended to crumble easier than real burgers when placed in a bun with fixings but still more cohesive than other eating experiences w/ veggie burgers. Pita or flat bread would make it easier to eat. Many omnivores will enjoy eating these beanie burgers which helps if cooking for those who are vegetarians and those who are not. While doubtful most omnivores will eliminate eating a grilled juicy hamburger because of these faux burgers, it’s nice to have a wide array of recipes to keep things interesting. Thank you Laura and Leslie for sharing.

Love, love, love this!! I grated 3 garlic cloves, minced 4 baby yellow peppers, grated a carrot, put 1 cup cooked quinoa, oatmeal to replace breadcrumbs as others recommended. I also used 2t cumin and 1t coriander and lots of hot sauce. Unbelievable! I also got lazy and made a loaf. I used one egg and thought for sure this wouldn't hold. It did. I cooked it for 20 minutes at 350 and let it sit for 15 minutes. Sliced perfectly. Easy, delicious and healthy. Has such a nice taste. I don't even need bread, just a little fresh guacamole. I am going to make another one right now and freeze it. Thank you for this recipe, my new weeknight go to.

I'd give it 6 stars if I could. One of the best recipes I've ever found on allrecipes.com. The ONLY modification I made was to bake them instead of fry them (because lets be honest, frying is gross and unhealthy). I baked them at 375 for 15 minutes. I've now made these twice and both times they were GREAT! Highly, highly recommend you try these.

This was one of the best veggie burgers I have eaten.  I also use oats instead of bread crumbs and to save on fat and calories I used egg beaters and olive oil spray in the pan.  Delicious!  The only slight problem I had was them falling apart a little, but that could be my fault.

I used a 12 oz bag of dried beans and probably 1.5 cups of leftover quinoa so I upped all other ingredients except the egg.   Instead of salt I added 1 tube of Swanson Beef Flavor Boost. Probably a T each of W sauce and liquid smoke. I formed to fit size of thin buns (in burger patty press). Ended up with 10 burgers. I liberally sprinkled with Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning and pressed it into  both sides of the patties. Baked from frozen on sprayed foil then broiled to get a bit of crisp.

These are better than the expensive store brands and better and fresher tasting than my favorite organic shop. Thanks for posting. I also went with oats versus bread crumbs. Very forgiving/flexible recipe. 

To save time I always keep a selection of grains (quinia/brown rice/barley/Bulgar wheat); beans (black/chick/kidney); and fresh or frozen veggies. This recipe will help with variety

These were totally scrumptious!  I had to substitute quick oatmeal ground in a food processor for the breadcrumbs.  This exceeded my expectations by a long shot.

I used a flaxseed egg instead of a real egg and skipped the cumin and thought it was a solid veggie burger.  I don't think it would stay together on a grill but in a pan it did ok. I served it with beet hummus from Whole Foods which gave it more flavor.

Scrumdittlyitious!! I cooked quinoa according to recipe. I doubled the recipe because I was feeding teenage boys. I used a red bell pepper instead of yellow, Italian bread crumbs, and tapatio hot sauce. I cooked half on a well oiled gas grill and half on my cast iron skillet. Both turned out fantastic, but my preference is grilled. I served with caramelized onions, chipotle veganaise, sliced tomatoes and avocados on a toasted bun that I had seasoned with the caramelized onion butter. While sitting at the dinner table, I got more raves from my husband, sons and nephew than I have ever received from one meal. I must have starved them long enough:)

Great basic recipe that you can modify to add whatever flavour you're in the mood for. Used 1/2 c quinoa as recommended in some other reviews and the consistency came out nice. Would probably undercook the quinoa a little bit next time because I love the texture a little crunchy. Added some celery and fresh dill for fresh tasting burgers.

Helpful hints: Add everything together except the egg and taste it before forming the patties.  This will give you a chance to adjust the flavor.  After forming burgers, let them rest in the fridge for 30 minutes and they'll stay together.  

I went rogue and added 1/2 c small dice portobello mushroom. I wanted to add more umami flavor.  I also did a quick sauté in the oil with the mushroom, onion, bell pepper, garlic and cumin.  Adding salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.  I let it cool before combining with the rest of the ingredients.  Toasting the cumin brings out the flavor.

The burgers were formed in 1/3 c patties and grilled on the panini press.  No added oil on the non-stick surface.  

Huge hit for my junk food loving family.

Oh my!  These were the best veggie burgers we have ever had!  I was not optimistic since I have tried many recipes before that didn't work, but these were SO GOOD!  This was my first time cooking with quinoa.  The recipe was simple to make.  My husband and picky 7-year old loved them, too!  We made them as directed except we grilled them.  We will be making these all summer long.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Instant favorite for my husband and I.  He asks me to make them at least once a week.  We both really enjoy spicy so I make a chipolte mayo to dress it and serve these on toasted whole wheat buns with caramelized onion and baby spinach leaves.  If I'm not in the mood for too much spice (or want something a little more healthy), I replace the mayo with mashed fresh avocado and fresh tomato. 

I did notice how much better they stay together (much less crumbly out of the pan and on your plate) if you refrigerate the patties an hour or so before cooking them.

Awesome recipe.  Can't thank you enough!

These were very good! The only thing I did differently was add more spices...extra cumin, oregano, paprika,  and hot sauce.  They were delish! Id highly recommend them! I served them with "thin" buns  and sauteed spinach, definitely would have been great without the bun as well!

Excellent!  Another great way to use quinoa, love it :)  These were quick and simple to throw together with ingredients I always have in the house!  Hubby loved them too, which says a lot as he loves a good 'burger'!  Made some chipotle mayo to have with these and served on multi grain thin buns.  Opted to BBQ instead of pan fry, delish!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe to a T and it was really good. But I soon realized there really isn't much you can't do to this. So now, I never measure anything and just put together what I want. If it is doesn't feel sticky enough I add an extra egg (I don't rinse the beans). I use panko and just add that until it holds together. I then use a large ice cream scoop and just drop them on a baking sheet and flatten, perfect size and far less mess. I'm going to try seasoned cornbread stuffing mix to see how that goes next time for a change up. I also plan to make some with Indian spices as well. I always taste it before adding the eggs to make sure it is just where it should be. Easy easy recipe with great results and are a big hit with my meat eating kids.

Thanks so much for the recipe.

After reading the reviews, I was hoping for this great taste and I didnt get it. I ate it plain so I could taste just the "burger" and I looked at my husband as he took a bite and we both said its just not for us.

Wow. I've been trying to cook sans meat at least one night a week and this recipe will definitely be made at least once a month. My husband was horrified when I told him I would be making black bean and quinoa burgers (he HATES quinoa) but he had two! The flavor of these burgers was phenomenal. The texture was slightly mushy, so I think next time I'm going to try baking them.

Excellent!  We are new to vegan cooking and I used the egg substitute (1 T ground flax seed simmered for 5 min in 3 T water. Then cool) and these turned out perfectly.  I also used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. It made 6 nice size burger which I then baked on a lightly oiled alum foil at 400 degrees for 20 min, then flip and bake for another 15 min. Hope this helps others and yes, I plan to freeze any leftover patties for later in the week.

This is a fantastic recipe to make in bulk and eat for lunch throughout the week. I accidentally added the olive oil to the mix as I was rushing to make these the second time...and it really helped the dryness. I add about 3 tbsp of olive oil now. They freeze pretty well, too. I eat them bunless with guacamole and salsa - SO tasty and SO easy.

Most excellent.  I didn't have green pepper, so I used left over corn.  I also added some garbanzo beans from my fridge.  I increased the garlic and spices, and added paprika and chili powder.  Like other users, I baked these in the oven.  (400 degrees 20 minutes on one side, flip, 15 minutes on the other side).  The texture and flavor were great.  I can see making different variations of this recipe.

Best veggie burgers ever!!  I made a few changes - I used about 1/4 cup of grated carrot as I didn't have any yellow pepper, substituted quick oats for the bread crumbs because we don't eat wheat, and I cooked them in the oven at about 400 degrees, flipping them once, until they had an internal temp above 150.  They were so tasty!  I froze the leftovers by wrapping in press and seal wrap and placing in a freezer bag and found they were really easy to re-heat in the microwave, oven, or on the grill.  Thank you for such a great recipe!  I wish I could give this a lot more stars!

Wow! These are addicting. I mashed the beans lightly with a potato masher to give a great consistancy. I carmelized the onions with some mushrooms and then added to the mix. Used quick oats (per others) instead of bread crumbs and added a few dashes of Worceshershire. Baked ahead @ 350 for 15 minutes and when it was dinner time, browned in a skillet just enough to heat them and give a crisp coat.

These were the perfect texture for forming patties and came out awesome (I followed the recipe exactly). My only complaint is that they were a tad bit bland - I think next time I'll add in a little bit more hot sauce and spices.

These burgers are EXCELLENT!!!.  The flavor combinations of onion, garlic, yellow pepper and cumin are a delight to the tastebuds.  Perfect balance with a subtile kick.  Wonderful for vegetarian and meat eaters alike.  Get ready for the ooohs and ahhhs.  This is top of my list for any burger but hey, I'm a vegetarian.  :)

I already had quinoa made so I added 1/2 cup cooked quinoa plus 1/4 cup water to the other ingredients. I exchanged old-fashioned oats for the breadcrumbs. I baked them-first spraying my pan then the tops of the burgers. Very good!

These tasted pretty good but they were very crumbly. Mine couldn't stand up to a burger bun so I ate them in a pita, kind of like a falafel. Over all, though, not bad.

Wow. These veggie burgers are for real good. Definitely the best vegetarian burger I have ever made, and definitely better than most from the box. I added a jalapeño pepper to the mix, just to spice it up a little more. But this will be my go-to veggie burger recipe for now on.

Although these were VERY tasty, they did not hold up well when placed between hamburger buns---kind of messy when they fell apart mid-bite.  Will have to tweak the recipe a bit next time or make as written, just not served in buns.

I have made these six times now and every time, I swear they get better!! I was looking for something to replace hamburger because it has gotten too expensive and I have never cared for the texture of ground turkey. I LOVE black beans and I have made this recipe replacing quinoa with brown rice, I have used different colored peppers, I added Worchestershire sauce and I used Sirachi too.  I had never used quinoa before, now I am also using that as a breakfast dish. I liked the lettuce wrap idea, also using this to make Mexican style dishes. A side benefit: since using this instead of hamburger, I lost six pounds!!

Versatile.  Takes on the flavor of whatever spices you have on hand.  My favorite is asian spices topped with a mango chutney.  Also good with Italian seasonings with tomato sauce, or mushroom/steak flavors.  We make a batch and save for quick dinners.  Great to take camping and reheat on the camp stove. No need to use egg.  Putting the finished patties in the fridge for at least 30 mins before baking or frying allows flavors to absorb and patties are easier to handle without falling apart.

FIRST time using Quinoa.  First time making a veggie patty and I wont try another recipe.  It IS delicious.  
I messed up and used home cooked beans but forgot to drain the juice so it was a lil soft to pick up with the spatchler.  Duhhhhh! But as far as the taste.... you dont even need a bun... you can add some salsa and avocado and just eat it straight.  

I will definately make this one again.

I fully agree with the 5-star rating! These black bean burgers are incredibly delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. (I was afraid they wouldn't "stick" together well, but they did.) I have been a vegetarian for eight months and can't remember the last time I had a hamburger. These definitely satisfied my craving. Oh, one thing I did differently is I made the beans from dried. By soaking them overnight, then boiling them for two minutes, rinsing the beans and the pot as well and repeating, you avoid the gas usually produced by beans! This technique works with all beans.

Really delicious.  I made it exactly as described, but served it with a simple mango salsa.  I simply diced some fresh mango and mixed it with some minced fresh jalepeno and lime juice (that rested in the fridge for an hour before it was served.)  No bun, just pile the mango concoction on top of the burgers... DELICIOUS!

My friend and I tried these and loved them. We did modify the recipe just slightly, doubling all of the ingredients and adding extra garlic and onion.  We also shredded a whole yellow and whole red bell pepper adding that into the mix (instead of the quantity called for in the recipe) and added about another 1/4 cup of dry breadcrumbs.  We also tried cooking them multiple ways, fried first (which we found to be too under cooked on the inside as they got a bit burned.)  We baked the rest of the patties in a 350 oven for 15 minutes and then fried them in the olive oil. Which turned out perfect! YUMMY!

Great Recipe!  I didn't use the green pepper bc I didn't have any and my kids have an aversion to it, but subbed corn instead. I also used powdered garlic and onion (kids hate to see onion too), sriracha for the hot sauce, oatmeal for breadcrumbs (bc its what i had on hand) and 1/2 cup quinoa to stretch the recipe for leftovers for lunch :)  Awesome!  Loved the great crunch on the outside! Served with Trader Joe's Sweet potato fries.  Big Hit!

This was so good! I took some people's advice and added a tad of mushrooms, jarred jalapeno sauce instead of hot sauce, and two eggs with a little extra bread crumbs. I put them in the freezer for a bit because I was afraid they would fall apart. Afterwards I topped them with fried onions, tzatziki, jalapenos, and avocado on a toasted whole wheat bun. I served with baked zucchini chips and it was phenomenal!!

I thought these were really, really, really good. I'm not a fan of peppers (or at least they're not a fan of me), so I took another reviewer's advice and subbed in shredded carrots. I also added in one mushroom, finely diced and used 1/2 cup quinoa to 1 cup of veggie broth. Couldn't find my bread crumbs, so ground up some oats as a few reviewers suggested and I baked them in a 350° oven (sprayed some foil with cooking spray on a baking sheet) for about 20 minutes. Doing the whole WW thing, so cutting down where I can. It made 5 regular sized patties and one thiner patty...can't quite figure out how to divide into equal portions without going to a lot of trouble. Served on a sandwich thin, topped with tomato slice, lettuce and salsa (meant to put on some avocado) and the whole thing was only 6 points - not too shabby and quite tasty.

OMG, it really IS good.  I served it like a burger, but I can see that it will be just as good as an entree.  Wonderful combination of great taste and guilt-free, healthy eating.  The only change I made (and only because I didn't have cumin) was that I replaced the cumin with coriander, in the same amount.  DEE-LISH!!!

Very good. I did not have a bell pepper so I excluded that, and I minced an entire small onion. I made 4 fairly thick patties, so I upped the cook time a few minutes. All the patties stayed together nicely. I topped mine with sliced avocado and salsa and it was quite a delicious lunch. My 14 year old and 11 year old boys devoured theirs also. Served with sweet potato fries.

This was just okay. I followed exact except I added quick oats instead of bread crumbs as that's what I had on hand. Basically I just found it bland, but I did make my own avocado spread and some hot sauce and they were awesome like that. So, with all the good stuff in them, I would make them again but make sure to add some zest whether it's in the paddies or as a topping.

Totally fab!!  Instead of the hot sauce I added about a tablespoon of hot chili paste and I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth. So not a vegetarian but I would eat these over regular burgers any day!  Also added minced onion and used panko crumbs as I had no bread crumbs.  Topped the burgers with caramelized onions and mushrooms, avocado, and tomato slices. Incredible!

Quick, easy and tasty!  Do yourself a favor and double the recipe.  It will take you the same amount of time and you'll have an extra batch of patties to freeze and use whenever you'd like!  (They freeze very well pre-cooked.)

I made these a while ago but forgot to put in my review. I remembered today, since I'm making them for dinner tonight! These were fantastic!! I followed a few suggestions: 3/4 cup of quinoa instead of 1/4 cup and used oatmeal (actually with the bread crumbs, since I felt the mixture was still a bit to wet). I also used a bit of chili pepper sauce (the kind found in the Asian section of the supermarket) since I didn't have any Frank's Red Hot and I used some of that Better Than Bouillon Mushroom Base for a bit more meaty flavor. They came out so well, even my kids (5-13) gobbled these up!

A lot of effort for what basically tasted like refried bean patties. Taste was ok, but you could get the same result with canned refried beans instead of mashing black beans.

Great.  Better than a store bought frozen veggie burger.  I love spicy food, so from reading the reviews, I added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  Will be making again soon!

Love this recipe. I found this recipe several months ago and since then I make them 2-3 times a month.  I use guacamole as a topper and it makes them even better.  I also substituted grapeseed oil for olive oil to keep the oil flavor light. The grapeseed oil seems to get hot faster and does not burn as easily as the olive oil. Also, I use quinoa a lot so I have it usually already made in the fridge.  This cuts down the prep time to less than 25 minutes.

This recipe was very easy to make. I ended up grilling them instead of pan cooking them and it worked great!  My whole family loved them, except for one, and she thought this burger was a bit dry.  Just a warning to everyone, this burger has a very mexican flavor.  I would recommend it with guacamole, salsa, or even some mango salsa would be delicious. Overall, I liked this dish very much.

This was decently fine, but we have other veggie burger recipes which we like better.  Maybe it was the bread crumbs and the quinoa, but I needed more different flavor for these.

NEVER thought I could eat a burger made of anything other than ground beef. It is absolutely wonderful.  I took some to work and my three co-workers loved them.

Finally a homemade veggie burger recipe that is full of protein, tastes delicious and DOESN'T fall apart when I flip them in the pan! This a great recipe: tasty, fast, healthy and easy. I used a flax egg to make it vegan, which worked perfectly to hold it together. I also added some chopped cilantro to the mix and that worked really well with the flavours already in it. Served on a whole wheat bun with lettuce, jalapenos, tomato, vegenaise and a pickle.

It was good, but intensive if you don't have leftover quinoa laying around.

This is the best veggie burger I have found. A great consistency and very tasty. I would adjust the cumin if you are not fond of it as a dominant flavor... but we loved them... and loved the leftovers! Great recipe! Thanks!

This was a good veggie burger. It had a good consistency and taste. The only thing I did differently was leave out the minced onions. It felt a little redundant since I was using onions as a topping.

This was a really flavorful veggie burger and I have eaten a lot of veggie burgers!  The only thing I did differently was use a quinoa/wild rice mix with half of a flavoring packet.  I think using veggie broth is a great idea too.  I tried cooking it fried and baked.  The fried version was delicious but a little difficult to flip in the pan.  I lost a few crumbles. :)  The baked was a lot easier and kept together very well. I baked for 30 min at 350.

Best veggie burger ever!!! I didn't actually have black beans when I first tried the recipe so used pinto beans and the burgers were delicious. My hubby is a meat lover and he was raving about these! I've since tried them with black beans and me and hubby both agree that the pinto bean version was tastier and we both prefer it to the black bean version. I used ground oats instead of bread crumbs as one of the other posts suggested, and left out the 1/2 cup of water. Even without the water, the mix was a little too moist so I added about a table spoon of organic flour. I'd also recommend making the patties quite thin as this allows them to cook through and crisp up on the outside nicely, which adds more flavour. All round, a GREAT reacipe! Thanks so much!

I made it as written and thought it was bland and bitter (and yes, I rinsed my quinoa well). No one in my family enjoyed these, I was sorry to have veered away from my regular black bean burger recipe.

First time cooking with Quinoa...my expectations were not very high but I was very pleasantly surprised at how tasty these were.  I will never again buy frozen veggie burgers, these are way better and fairly easy to make.  Even my husband liked them, although he is usually quite skeptical of anything that doesn't have meat in it.  I followed the directions exactly, and the only thing I may change next time is to add more hot sauce, I like my food a little spicier.  Will definitely make again.

Mine were a little on the wet side so I needed to add a bit more bread crumbs.  I also roasted the yellow pepper on the stove top so I could get the skin off the pepper.  Then I sauted the onion and pepper in the skillet before adding it to the burger mixture.  I don't like my veggies really crunchy so that alleviated the problem.

These burgers were excellent and very easy to make.  The kids even gobbled them up and fought over the last one.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing as far as ingredients go.  Although, I did cook them a bit longer than instructed to get them very nicely browned on the outside.  This recipe is going into our regular menu rotation!  Quinoa is an excellent and very nutritional grain.  :)

We thought these were excellent.  I personally did not have high hopes when our teenaged twin daughters said they wanted to make them ... but they far exceeded my expectations.  This recipe will definitely go into our binder of family favorites.  Thanks to the submitters for a real winner!

These are the absolute best veggie burgers I have ever had. This was my first time using Quinoa and the texture is what makes them similar to a burger.  I also doubled the quinoa and used chicken stock to cook it.  I served them in a josephs wrap with fresh guacamole. They were amazing.

I omitted the oil, added an extra egg, and used a green bell pepper since I had it on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was easy, quick, and delicious. The mixture stayed together very well.

Sorry - tried the baking method suggested and the burgers were too crisp and dry for our "meat" palates.  Maybe frying in oil would improve the taste. Also be prepared for the "bean" effect!

Super good. I lined a baking dish with foil and sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray and baked them. They were wonderful. I actually didn't even use a bun and topped them with avocado and tomatoes and thought it was wonderful. YUM!! (and I'm a meat-loving, steak kinda girl!)

Thank You for this recipe.
It is so difficult to find a recipe the whole family loves. My husband is practically vegan, my teenage son is adventurous when it comes to trying new foods, but definitely leans more towards the carnivorous side. And a toddler who likes something one day and the next day won't touch it.     
This recipe is fast and easy to make, and like others have said, the recipe lends itself to versatility. I did not have bell peppers and hesitated to add hot pepper sauce since it was for everyone.  Instead I added Trader Joe's Organic Tomatillo and Roasted Yellow Chili Salsa. They turned out fabulous!!!!! I was proud to feed my family such a nutritious meal.  This recipe has won a spot on the weekly rotation.

I'm cooking for one (me!) and trying to cut down on meat and this was my first attempt at a veggie burger.  This was FABULOUS!   I stuck to the recipe and tried making a full sized burger at first.   I was not thrilled with the 'mushy' interior of the burger (and hadn't read the reviews suggesting baking) and so my next attempt was a thinner, slider-sized burger.  Cooked slow in a non-stick skillet with just a spray of olive oil.   It was fabulous!   I purchased some guacamole singles to use for dressing the burger and loved it but realized about halfway through eating it that a slice of fresh tomato would really put it over the top.   Over a long weekend I ate nothing but these little sliders and always with that tomato.   I'm ready to make another batch and freeze the burgers this time.   Also love a recipe that doesn't call for anything more than a knife to dice and a fork to smash.   Nothing electronic needed!   Really great recipe!

I made these burgers at the last minute so the vegetarian in our family could enjoy while the rest of us ate grilled burgers. I did fry them on the stove using olive oil in a frying pan.
They turned out great, they were as moist as our burgers, and they were really fast to mix up.
This recipe is definitely a keeper

I loved these! They are going on our regular meal rotation.  Even my kids ate them. The only changes I made were as follows. I sautéd the peppers, onions and garlic before adding them to the beans. I used herb flavored breadcrumbs instead of plain. I also grilled these on a grill mat. Yum! Thanks for the recipe.

Better then any commercial vegeburger. As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the quinoa and cooked it in vegetable broth. I don't eat onion, so added another three cloves of garlic. Substituted celery for pepper and added a half cup of walnuts. Substituted Worcestershire sauce for hot sauce. Added another egg for binding. Baked in 400 degree oven for 30 minutes. Ate it in whole wheat pita bread with ketchup. Delicious!

My boyfriend and I LOVE burgers, and are recently trying to change how we eat, as to become more healthy. We were looking for a good recipe for a low calorie burger. We definitely found it with this recipe. Although we did alter the recipe slightly, we still really enjoyed the "burger". We had to omit the egg, simply because we are currently out of eggs. We also cut the oil back slightly (only using 1 tablespoon). We were very pleased with the outcome. We will definitely be making this again, but we were brainstorming ways to give it a more "meaty" bite rather than the soft, somewhat mushy consistency. I think next time we will be trying to add some finely chopped mushrooms.

I used oats as many others suggested, and also went heavier on the spices and garlic. I also added black pepper and served over a spring mix with avocado, tomato, goat cheese, and a poppy seed dressing. Super yummy!

yummy. I had mine with avocado and arugula , no bun. I did make a couple changes. for the bread crumbs i used ezekiel bread, i added about a 1/2 a cup vegetable broth  and for the egg i used  "chia egg"(1 tsp chia seed soaked in 3 Tbsp water).   after i made the patties i let them sit for about 10 minutes. i am recently vegan and this was my first attempt at veggie burgers. will definitely make this again!

So delish!  My carnivorous husband even loved it!  I used chicken broth to cook quinoa, swapped bread crumbs for oatmeal, didn't have bell pepper so left that out, added some ground black pepper and a touch of extra hot sauce to spice it up.  After cooking topped with pepper jack and guacamole = filling and perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly except for the bread crumbs, I used oats because that's what I had. I don't know why, but the patties were crumbly and kept falling apart when I tried to form them. I thought they would hold better once cooked, but they didn't. Every time I flipped them in the pan, they'd break into pieces. I don't know what would have helped (maybe another egg?) as I'm not familiar with making homemade burgers. Taste was ok. Would not make again though.

The flavor of these was really great! I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out really nice. The only thing I didn't like was the texture was a little weird. It was slightly mushy. Maybe they just need to be fried a little longer.

These were very good, but crumbly.  I followed the recipe and did get 8 patties.  I will make them again, even my 'non-bean' husband liked them.

I ended up using garbanzo beans and instant potatoes since I didn't have black beans or bread crumbs. It was great, made enough for lunch at work after feeding my family.
Look forward to other quinoa recipes.

These turned out great, but I did make minor adjustments.  I used 2 eggs instead of one and substituted Portobello mushroom for the bell pepper since I was using what I had on hand.  I didn't pan fry in effort to keep these healthier and baked at 400 for 20 min and they were great.  My carnivore of a husband didn't even notice the quinoa and loved these!

Even cooking noobs can do this. The burgers completely held together during the forming of the patties and cooking (I use a nonstick pan). The texture was nice: the outside was crisp and inside smooth and tender; there was no oozing/squishing action as you bit into the burger. On its on, the patty tasted of cumin which I wasn't very fond of so next time, I'll play with the spices. But it's a small complaint because topping the burger with cheese and ketchup helped with the flavor anyway. Overall, the burger is delicious, satisfying, and filling. 
I mostly followed the recipe except instead of breadcrumbs, I used 1 cup grounded rolled oats in order to absorb excess moisture which allowed for the veggie burger "dough" to come together in a "dough" ball.

I would make these again, but I would definitely tweak the recipe. I found it sort of dry. Also, I felt like the flavor profile was ruled by the cumin. I would probably play with the spices a bit to achieve a different flavor. And add something...to help the moisture even more. Zucchini maybe? I'll play with it. Still a good base to start with.

This is an amazingly wonderful recipe. I made some of the modifications and loved it. Firstly, 1/2 cup of cooked quinoa; double the cumin; added ground old fashion oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs; added juice from one freshly squeezed lime (add more ground oatmeal so it's not mushy); chopped cilantro; doubled Franks RedHot; added some cayenne pepper and some Ya Ya B Greek seasoning. I also let it chill so it was easier to form patties. I heated olive oil in a pan and added the burger letting it get slightly brown on both sides. I whipped up Chipotle Mayo and put a dollop on top of the burger. Pan seared a tortilla and put the burger (formed it lengthwise) in the middle with sauteed spinach and cherry tomatoes and rolled it up. FANTASTIC....you can add whatever spices, herbs you like. There are endless options. I added 1 egg but next time may use flax seed. Just need adhesive to keep it together. This is the best bean burger recipe I've ever tried.

I recently gave up soy and am also a vegetarian so I was searching for a recipe to make my own burgers and tried this one.  UNBELIEVABLY delicious! Even my little girls are it up.  I did make just a couple changes, I was trying to find a way to use my juicer pulp since I ALWAYS have it on hand from my daily drinks, so instead of yellow pepper I used 1/4 cup of carrot/celery pulp.  You couldn't see it or taste it! I think I'll try adding more next time.  I also minced up some mushrooms and added that too.  After adding ingredients into my fitness pal it was only 117 calories each burger (I made 6). Can't wait to make a triple recipe and freeze some for quick easy meals. THANK YOU for this recipe! Oh yea, I cooked mine in my too-fancy-for-me convection microwave on the roast feature using a high rack for15 min each side.

My hubby is on a brutal diet for his health so I added these to his rotation. I also enjoyed these but I love black beans. The only thing I changed was (like some other posters) adding Oatmeal to hold it all together instead of the bread crumbs. I baked these but I could have grilled or fried, they held together very well after refrigerating them for a couple of hours. These were not dry nor tasteless, they were really tasty and we will make them again for sure. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent! My toddler ate these no problem and both me and my husband loved them. I thought you could change the seasonings to vary them as well should you want to have an Italian taste, etc. the proportions were just right. Only piece of advice, squeeze to compact them, they stay together better while cooking. I baked some cheese on top after frying!

Really enjoyed having a healthy option to frozen vegetarian burgers. I made a couple of changes based on other reviews.  I doubled the recipe, which made 14 small burgers. I substituted whole grain rolled oats for bread crumbs,  shredded carrots for yellow pepper, chia paste (1 TBL chia to 3 TBL water) instead of eggs, and sriracha sauce for hot sauce (I didn't have any hot sauce available). I baked the burgers instead of fry for 30 min. at 400 degrees.  They tasted good but were a tad salty and dry. Next time, I am going to decrease the salt, and the baking time to 20-25 min. I will also serve the burgers with guacamole on top for extra moisture. Overall, a great alternative to high sodium/veggie burgers that you pick up at the store.

I used Garbanzo beans, broccoli, Bragg's amino acid, garlic powder. This recipe is great bc it is adjustable to what you have on hand. Just use the same proportions. The consistency was perfect (I make LOTS of bean patties). 400 F bake for 30 min.

This burger was good and with all the traditional burger toppings, it was very flavorful and filling.  However, the black bean flavor just dominates the dish.  Not something I could cook very often, but a nice alternative to a beef burger.

Huge hit with my 2 year old! I've been looking for a healthy cheeseburger replacement since that's his favorite thing to eat and he's becoming a very picky eater. Fortunately, he loves quinoa so I thought I'd try it. He ate the entire patty! I only made a few tweaks: I cooked 1/2 cup of RED quinoa in 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth and I replaced the pepper sauce with 1/2 teaspoon of lite soy sauce. I left the pepper out because I didn't have one and it didn't make a difference in my opinion. I cooked them in a black skillet for 3-4 minutes each side so they'd be crispy, put a slice of cheese on top and my picky toddler clapped and screamed CHEESEBURGER!! I felt like a super mom. This will definitely be filed into the meal rotation at our house.

I have made the recipe twice now and have learned a few things. Make sure to rinse and drain the beans very well, in order to help avoid soggy burgers. Use a good non-stick skillet so the burgers don't break into pieces as happened to me the first time when I tried to flip them. Sauté the garlic in a little olive oil 30 seconds or so (don't brown) to take the bite off a bit. I omitted the egg on the second attempt due to a vegan in our house and seemed not to negatively affect the burgers. The taste is good as is, but I think I'll experiment with subbing or adding other veggies and/or spices to the burgers. Thanks!

Wow, followed the recipe exact.  Hubby loved it, I loved it, even my 6 year old loved it!   Only one problem.... Mine kept falling apart when I would flip them in the pan or move them.  Any suggestions??

Not bad for a quinoa burger.  It was nice and moist through the burger.  I would like to add more spices for some flavor.  I used tomatoes instead of peppers and next time would consider adding feta, olives, artichokes, and lemon juice.

This is my first attempt at a black bean burger and all I can say is WOW!  I did as another reviewer did and baked at 400 for 25 minutes to cut down on oil.  Next time I'll flip them to get them crisped on both sides.

Amazing!  After reading the reviews, I modified a few things.  I used half tomato and half carrots instead of the yellow peppers.  My daughter doesn't like these and she's the vegetarian in the family.  I only put in 1/4 tsp of cumin and added 1 tsp of Worcester sauce.  Ommitted the hot sauce and added a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. I baked on 400 degrees for 25 minutes and then broiled on each side for 2 minutes each.  They turned out fantastic!  The whole family loved it!

These are so good! I'm not a vegetarian, but I prefer these to beef burgers. I substitute oats for breadcrumbs to make them gluten free and I've fried them and baked them (at 400 for 30 minutes, flipping halfway) and I find baking easier and better for you (less oil). I will make these often!

These were so good.  I followed the recipe to the T, except for the peppers.  I didn't have any so I diced a couple of jalepenos.  I let these sit in the frig overnight and they were sooooo tasty.

Easy to make. Good flavor, although I think next time I make these (I am making them again) I will add more spices. I recommend these. I liked this better than the just-mushrume burgers.

This is delicious. I'm eating it right now. My carnivore husband who also doesn't like homemade burgers OR quinoa "mmm"-ed and "oh my gosh"-ed the whole time. It's super flavorful, and goes good with red wine. I cannot wait to make it again.

FANTASTIC!  Omitted the hot sauce (giving it to my little three-year olds) and substituted rolled oats for bread crumbs as recommended.  Delicious.  I'm going to have the left overs tomorrow morning with a side of fried eggs.  Thank you so much for a delicious and nutritious meal.

WOW!!!  These are amazingly good... I'm a meat a potatoes guy and I'm trying to change my diet.  I tried making these and can't believe how tasty these are.  I made 4 with the recipe added cheese and black olives after cooking.  I will definitely make these again after I eat the other 3.  I'd even go so far as saying that I'd rather eat these than a beef burger any day.

I used a can of refried black beans to skip the smashing step, and left out the bell pepper, but these are delicious! I found it to be easy to make, and would be a great use of leftover/extra quinoa. The patties ended up being bigger than our buns, but that was fine with us. Thanks for the recipe!

these were delicious!  I have been eating them without a bun, and they are great!   I had to double the amount of breadcrumbs, because mine were too moist to turn.  Will make again and again!

These are so insanely good. I had some trouble with the proportions the first time I made them because I got lazy about measuring, so they kind of fell apart in the frying process. The second time went much better when I followed the recipe exactly. I added oats instead of bread crumbs because I can't do gluten and added an extra egg just to be safe. These have now become a weeknight staple, and now we just eat them without any kind of bread and put some veggies on top. They are so easy too!

Really delicious.  I used almond flour instead of the breadcrumbs and it worked brilliantly.  I also cooked in Walnut Oil instead of Olive oil, added another clove of garlic, and used Rainbow Quinoa.  I skipped the bun and ate over a bed of lettuce but I think next time I will try it on a sweet potato bun.

I finished it...and it was okay at best.  I must admit that I have never found a veggie burger that I do like, and only tried this one because on the video and on the recipe it promised to impress carnivores....No carnivore that I know.  The rest of my family would give it one star.

OMG!!!!! I want to thank DownHomeCitySisters.com from the bottom of my heart! These burgers are super easy, super cheaps, and super super delicious!!!!!  This is a great recipe and very easy to customize--change up the seasonings and the kind of beans for whatever kind of burger you want.  I am minorly obsessed with these burgers right now.  They are satisfying, healthy, and hearty at the same time.  The first time I made them, I did a de-constructed burger sort of thing...made a salad using the Honey Mustard Dressing II from this site and served the burger on the side with ketchup.  Delish!  Now, I'm experimenting with all kinds of burger and steak seasonings.  Totally awesome recipe.  THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!!!

Wow!  Oh, so good!  These were incredibly savory little burgers.  I have been a vegetarian for many years, and I am not sure I have had a better veggie burger than this.  I made a few substitutions 1.) egg white only instead of the whole egg 2.) instead of using only yellow bell pepper, I used half yellow and half orange 3.) I used Cholula for the hot pepper sauce.  I will certainly be making these again!

Amazing!

Very hearty and lots of flavor.  Using the advice of another rater, I put the patties in the oven for 15 min at 400 degrees and then lightly browned using the broiler rather then put them in a pan with olive oil.  I will definitely be making these again.

These were so easy to make and taste fantastic! I was able to make a few more patties by increasing the quinoa (making it with 2 parts water to 1 part quinoa). I cooked up a few patties in assembly-line fashion for work lunches and froze the remaining patties between parchment paper for later use. Toped with fresh tomato, spinach, hummus, and avocado for a great summer taste! Altered the recipe a little, simply because I was lacking ingredients, to include green pepper-still great.

Loved it!  i'm devouring this dish as I type and my mouth waters between each bite when I put the fork down to type a little more.  I didn't have the onion or the pepper so I substituted corn for the onion and chopped up a left over bottle of banana peppers I found in the fridge.  It turned out great!

These were delicious! My friend had never tasted a black bean burger, and she said it was just as good as meat. The quinoa is very subtle, but adds texture and nutrition. I eyeballed the amount of breadcrumbs and ended up adding a bit too much, but they still turned out great. I baked the patties in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. Easy, quick, and tasty.

I have tried hundreds of recipes on Allrecipe (mostly all delish) but this is my first review.  These were AWESOME! Even my VERY fussy husband loved them!  I made a few minor changes due to some picky eaters.  I cooked my quinoa in chicken broth instead of plain water, I used shredded carrots instead of peppers and I also added some frozen corn to the quinoa while it was cooking.  This was truly a great recipe.  We normally buy the Dr. Pragers (sp) California burgers but my husband said he liked these MUCH better!  These will definitely become a staple at our house. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Followed the recipe to the "T" and had no issues with the burgers being to "wet". I actually doubled the recipe so I could freeze the extras. That worked nicely. I take them out of the freezer and put them in the toaster oven for 10-15 mins on 200 degrees and then fry them in a pan with some olive oil to give them some crunch.

This was my first shot at veggie burgers and I loved them! I took some advice from the comments and baked them at 400F for 15 minutes on each side instead of pan frying. This is definitely my new go to burger recipe!

Followed the recipe and it turned out delicious.  The only complaint is how crumbly the burger is.  I think I may try the suggestion to bake it a bit and then pan fry at the end, and see if it'll hold the patty form a bit better.  Great flavors and a fairly quick prep/cook time.  Will make again.

This recipe is amazing!  My kids loved it...they said it is "better than a hamburger!"  I also used oats instead of bread crumbs.  I used about a 1/2 cup of quinoa, maybe a little more.  I did not add the salt because of the hot sauce and also because I used southwestern jalepeno black beans with lime juice instead of plain black beans.  Delicious!

I can't give it 5 stars because I did change the original recipe.  I used oats in place of bread crumbs, didn't add the pepper, added a little flax and extra garlic and onion.  The first one I cooked was a little dry but the others were great.  Make sure not to overcook them and these will turn out great.  So much flavor--probably the best black bean burger I've ever had.  Love the addition of the quinoa.  This is a great recipe and can be tweaked to anyone's tastes.  :)

Pretty good.  I'll certainly make this again.  This was my first attempt at black bean burgers and I found it to be pretty easy.  I can't have egg or gluten, so I substituted 1 tbs ground flax seed with 3 tbs warm water for the egg and corn meal for the breadcrumbs.  I thought the seasoning was very, very mild.  We would have liked a little more flavor so maybe we'll increase the garlic, salt, cumin and hot sauce (or use red chili flakes) next time.  And maybe add a bit more onion.

Also, next time I won't bother with patties.  I assumed I'd be able to form them with my hands like hamburger meat, but this mix is very gooey.  Just plop a spoonful on the skillet and pat it down and around the sides with a fork.  Much less messy that way and doesn't require so many hand washings.

I might cook them for a few more minutes too.  I think the last batch stayed on for closer to 4 min per side.  I was able to get 6 big servings out of this recipe.

I have been on a quest to find the the "perfect veggie burger" for about 6 months. I'm happy to report that this is it! I have tested bunches of recipes, both from this site and elsewhere, and none compare to this recipe. With a veggie burger, it is really hard to get the right balance of taste and texture, and this one hits the mark on both. I made it exactly as is and served it on a bun with melted cheddar, tomatoes, and mayo. If I have the time, next time I will make a homemade chipotle mayo and serve it with that, the cheddar and tomatoes, and some avocados. And there WILL DEFINITELY be a next time!

This is a really good base recipe. I cook the quinoa in veggie broth or a third of a piece of veggie boullion. Also, i forego the hot sauce and add paprika and cayenne. Added some garlic powder, green onions corn and jalapeno and mexican 4 cheese. Turned out amazing!

This is definitely the best veggie burger recipe I've tried! I used half lentils and half black beans and it worked out beautifully. I dressed mine with garlic-lemon and siracha aioli and it was a huge hit!

Add extra spices, turned out a little tasteless.  Could use some jalepeno peppers and some red pepper.  I like my food spicy so this may just be my preference.  Very healthy, easy dish to cook.

So delicious! I substituted the bread crumbs with oatmeal. But other than that, i followed the recipe. I topped my burger with sauteed zucchini, mushrooms, and onions. I ate burger already... thinking about having seconds!

These are so delicious!!!!  My vegetarian daughter loved them.  I loved them, my meat eating daughter loved them and has been asking me to make them again.   I had to substitute Thai Chili Sauce for the hot pepper sauce and granulated garlic for the garlic because it's what I had on hand.  Still DELICIOUS!!!

Great flavor.  Took some time and planning.  Had some trouble with the patties keeping shape especially when turning in the skillet.  Second time I made them I baked at 400 for 15 minutes, turned and baked 5 more minutes.  We liked them better.

So good! After reading the reviews I made these changes:
Baked @350 for 20 minutes
Used oats instead of breadcrumbs 
Added fresh cilantro, 1 tsp paprika and a habanero pepper 
Left out the egg..by accident I didn't remember till it had been in the oven ten minutes :( good news if you're vegan they didn't fall apart and still tasted great! I think I just might add more spices next time but other than that they were delicious!

Great recipe, no more store bought garden burgers for my family!  I used oatmeal as well and put it through the Vitamix first.  Great texture and nutritious.  Will add more garlic next time.  I also did the baking method on 4oo for 30 minutes and got crunchy burgers.

I've been a vegetarian for 5+ years and am a huge fan of the Morningstar Farms black bean burgers so you can imagine my glee at finding and LOVING this recipe.  It was amazing and so easy to boot.  I followed the recipe as directed with the exception of green peppers for yellow.  I cooked the burgers and then froze them in individual plastic bags for future use.  When I'm hungry for one I grab it out - throw it in the microwave for about 1-2 min with a napkin over the top and throw it on some crisp iceberg lettuce and BBQ sauce.  So good!

Probably the best veggie burger I've made.  My husband could not stop raving about these and he wants me to make more to freeze so he can have them any time!  Also served them to some meat eaters who really enjoyed them too.  I made them vegan by using chia seeds in water as a substitute for the egg, which worked perfectly.  Other changes:  I used chipotle peppers instead of hot sauce, oats instead of breadcrumbs, plus I added some cilantro and coriander.  These held up great on the grill, even without using oil!  Will be making these again very soon!

I followed the recipe exactly and served the burgers on a lightly toasted bun with Jalapeno jack cheese and sliced tomato.  The flavour is delicious and the texture is firm but not dry.  A really good recipe - I'll make these again (and I am not even a vegetarian!)

SOOOO delicious!  My husband had a hard time with them because there was no meat in them, but he ate 2 of them.  He even said he'd eat them again.  I will definitely be making them again!  Thanks for the great recipe.  We even made them on the grill.  He heavily oiled the grate and put some oil on the burgers, and they grilled very well!

Just made these for the second time last night. LOVE THEM!  I added about 2 T. fresh chopped cilantro, but otherwise i followed the recipe exactly. I made the mixture into 6 patties (to make three meals for our family of two) about two hours before service to meld the flavors and help them keep together while flipping, baked them at 350 for ten minutes per side, and served on sandwich thins with some cilantro-garlic mayo and coleslaw on the side for a delish light and satisfying summer meal. Thanks so much for one of the best vegetarian recipes on this site!

TIP-if you're counting calories like I am, when you buy large rolls for sandwiches, slice them and carefully scrape out some of the inside of the rolls with a fork as you would when making bread bowls. Store the "innards" in a zip-top bag in the freezer, and use as needed for breadcrumbs in recipes like this one (I used crumbs from wheat rolls). You save calories by reducing the amount of bread in the sandwich rolls, and you save money by having fresh/frozen breadcrumbs on hand when you need them.
Update: this recipe has not only become a go-to, it may have converted my husband to vegetarianism. I'd be on the bandwagon with him on that, if not for bacon...

Raves from the vegetarian in this family as well as the non-vegetarians! I added 1/4 cup of minced jalapeno pepper just because I had it. Next time I may add one more egg since the burgers were a bit more crumbly than I'd like but overall a real keeper. I'll definitely be making these again.

These were really, REALLY good!  I made them tonight and they were easy and delicious.  Subbed green pepper for red and ground up cumin seed since I was out of cumin.  We're trying to eat more vegetarian meals and eat fewer packaged, processed foods.  This recipe is a perfect fit--thanks for sharing!

Tried these last night.  Very simple to make and really very tasty.  I prepared the recipe as written. Don't think there is anything I would do differently.  Great stuff!  My guest loved them too.

I've never had veggie burgers before and this is my first recipe.  These form nice burgers.  I will certainly be making these again!  So many possibilities as well.  Who needs beef?!!

This was great. I doubled it and got 12 burgers. I also baked the burgers at 400 for 20 minutes rather than frying. I might kick up the spice a bit next time.

Very easy to put together.  I used a substitute for the flour because I have celiac disease.  You can use a number of things like almond flour, or even oatmeal flour (which I grind myself.) 

Came out great, I also used some of my home made chili sauce which is like a relish as a topping.  Will definitely make them again.

Made this exactly per recipe.  My wife and I thought they were delicious.  We fried them in a cast iron skillet but can’t wait till it gets warmer (2 degrees out today) to try them on the grill.  I do not see how you can get 5 burgers out of this though.  We got 2 jumbo burgers and probably could have divided it up to get 3 but I’d think you’d need a double batch if you wanted 5.

Surprisingly good! We are new to vegetarian eating and didn't have high expectations, but these make us think we may never need to buy ground beef again! We cooked on the grill using aluminum foil and some olive oil to keep from burning. I didn't have bread crumbs and used corn flake crumbs instead, but it subbed well.

I Had been  looking  for a black bean burger recipe - tried several and this is a keeper!  Just the right consistency and the peppers and onion add a nice crunch.

I had quinoa left over that I had cooked with vegetable broth so it was very flavorful. I used panko bread crumbs.  I did not fry these but used an olive oil spray on a cast iron pan so they cooked very quickly.

Served it with hummus and avocado.

Have shared with several friends already.

This recipe is terrible. I made it exactly as listed in the recipe. The onions remain raw after cooking. The cumin flavor is too strong and not good. I have never reviewed a recipe before but this recipe was so bad I felt the need to warn other cooks!

Delish! This burger does take a little bit of  work to create, but it's well worth it. It's not difficult to make at all. It's flavorful, and filling! I will definitely make this recipe over and over again! Hoping to freeze a few and see how they taste afterwards. It would be worth it to make a huge batch, if freezing them is successful.

Made these today and omg they were so good. I didn’t put it on a bun just on a plate with a dollop of sour cream. Loved the taste ,best veggie burger ever.  I will be making these again. I also added a bit of diced mushrooms but the taste was fantastic.

These are so fantastic - and versatile to whatever you have on hand! I made pretty much as per recipe, added some frozen corn, baked for 10 min then pan fried for flavor. Freezing each patty for my "HEALTHY DAUGHTER" she loves them ! warm in microwave and ready to go -  sooo unexpectedly great for a "burger gal" ! Gotta get cold/freeze for a bit so they don't fall apart in cooking . DEFINATELY going to add some mushrooms next time too !

These were surprisingly good!  Based on some other reviews, I used 1/2 cup cooked quinoa, ground oats for the bread crumbs, flaxseed "egg" instead of a regular egg and left out the salt so I could use some streak seasoning.  I baked them in the oven.  My husband was a little skeptical when I told him they were bean burgers but kept an open mind.  He ended up having TWO!  Will definitely make them again.  Might even be good crumbled up, spiced with some cumin/chili powder and used for tacos.

Easy to make using ingredients I already had in my cupboards.
As a Vegan, I didn't use a real egg.  I used an egg substitute.

I really wanted to try this recipe, and I am glad I did. It is absolutely delicious.  I still eat meat but I would rather have this burger than a regular one.  
Love it.

I loved these, but changed a few things to alter to our tastes and texture. I pulsed 1 piece of fresh multigrain bread in food processor for the 1/2 cup bread crumbs. Then I pulsed the can of black beans (rinsed) a few times, instead of mashing. I did not pulse into a paste though. More like chunky ground beef texture.  I think this helps with keeping them together because I had no problem with them falling apart as others stated. I added 1 tbsp of cumin instead of 1 1/2 tsp, and I had no peppers, so added shredded carrot instead. I cooked my quinoa in chicken stock and added extra garlic and onion powder along with clove and fresh onion.  Oh and because others mentioned they fell apart, I added about 1/3 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. These turned out great and I topped with homemade ketchup. Definitely making a bunch and throwing them in my freezer. Healthy and delish! Oh and if you use a 1/3 cup measuring cup per patty and press it out to 3/4 inch, it will use up all the mixture and all the patties are the same size.

I made mine with more quinoa than beans and refrigerated the patties for about 10 minutes before cooking. Don't skimp on the veggies inside the patties!!! This is where the flavor comes from so make sure you use them in the mixture!

Recipe is perfect as is.  I love making a double batch and freezing the patties.  Sometimes I’ll add corn or red and green peppers.  Sliders are fun too!

These are seriously the best. I have made these quite a few times. My husband loves these. They are a meaty texture, and they aren't over processed food. They are a win at my house.

Not anything that I'm going to rave over, but I'm sure if I was a vegetarian I would appreciate it as a meat alternative. It definitely tastes much fresher than a frozen veggie burger, and I liked how it tasted, although it didn't have as strong of a kick as I was expecting or hoping. (Maybe in the future, upping the hot sauce and adding some other strong flavor might help with that.) Extra toppings would also give it a needed boost.

Perfect! Huge hit with the whole family (even the meat lovers). I refrigerated made patties for a few hours before cooking. Consistency is such that these could be grilled without falling apart!

The best recipe for veggie burger! Waaaaay better than any of the store bought kind! Definitely will make again! I used oats instead of bread crumbs,  added Worcestershire sauce, cayenne instead of hot sauce and added unflavored protein powder. Baked them at 400, like others suggested, 20 min on one side ,then flipped them and baked another 15 min. I was a little worried because the mix was really wet, but they came out perfect! Nice crust on the outside and moist on the inside!

The only change I made was I used 2 eggs instead of one. I’ve been skeptical of black bean burgers but I decided to give it a try. It turned out great and a nice base to experiment with. It’ll definitely be in my rotation! :)

I made this thinking it would taste amazing based on the reviews. It was okay. I guess I may be biased because I am comparing it too much to the beyond meat burger, which tastes and smells amazing. This tastes exactly like what it is ....a veggie burger.

The vegan liked it.  I would have liked them thinner so they weren’t so “mushy beans” on the inside.  Used our own ghost pepper/Trinidad scorpion hot sauce.  Try with the pickled red cabbage - the vegan added the clear yellow mustard sauce as we were trying to recreate the Ikea vegan dog!

Made these exactly to the recipe. Easy to make and taste was nothing like hamburger meat but is a very nice alternative. I am a meat lover but due to health issues it doesn't love me. These are surprisingly flavorful and I will make them again!

Let me first say I am a hardcore carnivore, and I've made this recipe repeatedly. It is great as a base recipe. I generally make it with a mix of oats and bread crumbs, instead of quinoa. I adjust the proportions until the mix feels right - something about these proportions tends to feel too wet. But to be fair, I'm not following the recipe exactly when I omit the quinoa. I also usually punch up the flavor with more fresh garlic, and add more spices for a more bold flavor. What makes it so great is it's very easy to adapt to whatever you have on hand. I've made it with green onion instead of regular onions, I've used kidney beans in place of black beans etc, and no matter what it gets rave reviews. I've also made it vegan friendly by using avocado instead of an egg, as a binder. Or used chicken stock instead of water, for more flavor (when cooking for non-vegetarians). People cannot believe how filling and 'beefy' these are. I like to stack these burgers with cheddar cheese, avocado slices, lettuce, tomato, vidalia onion, tomato. Also, this isn't mentioned, but I always finish these in the oven at like 375, for 10 minutes or so.

My family loved these. Easy and simple ingredients to keep on hand. I used oats instead of bread crumbs, and substituted grated carrot for the bell pepper. Instead of making patties, I made 6 balls and then pressed them into patties in the hot pan. Served them open face on levain toast with grainy mustard and melted swiss cheese on top.

Instead of water, I used mostly barbeque sauce. Didn't add salt, due to the salt in the sauce and didn't add the cumin.  I didn't shape patties, but used my oiled muffin tin like another one did, baking at 400 deg for 25 min. I got 6 mini meatloafs which were very delicious. I think I prefer this recipe to my usual with the soy substitute.

I used outmeal instead of breadcrumbs and also green bell pepper instead of yellow. Also added a bit of black pepper and 3/4 cups of quinoa instead of 1/4. 
Also, didn't put water on the mix. 
In my personal opinion these are great. I didn't have any trouble giving them shape or anything. 
I think they got a bit dry but it's just my opinion, maybe next time I'll add some water to the mix.
Really tasty, amazing texture and healthy af

I made this for meatless Monday, wasn’t sure how the hubby would like it. He and I both loved it. Definitely a keeper. I had not watched the video before making it so next time I will definitely add caramelized onions as a topping. I also chopped my onion and yellow pepper much finer than shown. It worked great. We don’t like buns so we had it with just a nice salad which complimented it very well.  Other thing I did have to change I was out of black beans (i know! Usually never happens) so substituted red kidney beans, they worked just as well, and I used red quinoa to help with the coloring seeing I had no black beans. You will love this!

Delicious! I added season salt to the burgers, but other than that followed it true to the recipe & it was delicious! Instead of bread I just topped it with caramelized onions & sour cream mixed with Frank’s Red Hot. We both ate 2 each easily, since they are pretty small, so keep in mind for bigger families.

Was unsure about all the beans but this turned out really good and I will definitely make it again. Followed some of the tips in comments and used some oats instead of breadcrumbs. Also added some cilantro and then baked instead of pan fried.

I forgot to do the quinoa and they came out fine.  I did add some additional herbs and seasoning.  I cooked up  a whole dried bag of beans  so completed  5x the ingredients.  It makes sense to make larger quantity, I will cook them all up and freeze them.  I told my 7 year old son they where "Steak " and he gobbled three down in one day.  Score !!!

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I didn't completely follow this recipe. I combined it with some other black bean burger recipes and loved the results!

I used 1/4 c bread crumbs and 1/4 c finely chopped almonds, 1 small/medium mashed sweet potato, and didn't use hot sauce. Everything else I followed though! I'm not a vegetarian, but thought this was a delicious way to cut some meat out of my daily diet. Will definitely be making this again!

They were good but not exceptional. Tasted like any other black bean burger I've made. The big plus on these is the quinoa in the place of other fillers that wouldn't be as 'healthy'.

I've made many different versions of Black Bean Burgers and this has been my favorite.  It is really simple and quick to make...and we had a few patties leftover for lunch the next day, which were delish yet again!  I made no changes.

Go to veggie main dish or side dish.  Easy to make. I form it into a loaf, chill it in the freezer, cut it into 1 inch slices, 3 minutes 30 seconds a side over a medium stove.  Put some  sriracha mayo on top.

Fabulous.
Used panko rather than standard breadcrumbs.
Used green onions rather than standard onions as that was what was on hand.
topped with sliced avocado then melted sharp cheddar over this.
topped with a nice garden salsa.

crazy good.

I love these burgers!  I add chopped red onions in place of minced onions & tricolor quinoa.  I do not add cumin just because I don't have it on hand.  Instead, I add Trader Joe's Seasoning Salt which gives it that extra kick.  You can add creole seasoning too-it gives it that extra flavor which I like.

I like it and added corn to it. Don’t use egg substitute. It won’t hold together as well

Absolutely awesome tasting.  I added I bit more cumin and used jalapeño salsa instead of regular hot sauce. Added corn too. Only problem I had was it didn’t hold together as well as I would like. But the flavor was amazing. I will definitely make it again.

A bit dry, and I like a bit more spice. Next time I'll use Italian bread crumbs and butter for added moisture and flavor.  I must admit, with horse radish, mustard and cheese (no buns)... I ate them all myself!

The only thing I changed was I swapped out the yellow bell pepper with roasted corn. Besides that it was very delicious.

This was delicious and “meaty”.  As a personal rule of thumb I substitute wheat germ for breadcrumbs.  While following the recipe ingredients otherwise I used a slightly different technique for mixing.  I beat the egg with the salt, cumin, and hot sauce separately.  After tossing all the other ingredients lightly with my hands I then added the wet ingredients and mixed again.

So plain and crumbly! Followed it exactly except for replacing the bread crumbs with oats. There is hardly any flavour and they were a mess to form into patties.

Loved this recipe! Made this and added another teaspoon of hot sauce because I wanted a bit of a kick. I also wanted to make it vegan by using a flax egg instead of an actual egg and it stuck together but was pretty soft. All around thought this recipe was awesome! Will continue to test out different ratios. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is a keeper. I love that it uses a lot of pantry staples, is cheap, heslthy and delicious! I doubled the recipe, used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of chick peas. Used white rice instead of quinoa because it's what I had.  Omitted the hot sauce and cumin, instead I used some chili powder and cayenne pepper. Served with a little mayo although sliced tomatoes and avocado would be great. I froze my extra burgers and am going to try letting them thaw a bit before frying them up.

I'm in the process of making these and decided to use the quinoa I had in my pantry which has black beans and seasoning in it already.  I added cilantro and will chill for a while and then place them on the grill.  Hope they come out as good as the other reviewers.  Will adjust my star rating once I taste them.

Made them on the grill with olive oiled foil and they were crunchy and delicious.  Will make again using much much hot sauce or Sriracha.

easy and delicious!  Kids had seconds!  Most importantly, the burger stayed together and did not fall apart and crumble  like other recipes i have tried.  Recommend as a an easy quick and healthy dinner during the crazy weeks of school/activities!

I have a recipe for quinoa tacos that I love and includes some of the same ingredients, but one of my favorite things about it is that it calls for roasted tomatoes and green chilies. I added this to the recipe instead of the hot sauce and I just added a few more saltine crackers (which I subbed for bread crumbs  since we didn't have any). I generally don't like hot sauce, so the green chilies was a good way to spice it up without the flavor of a sauce I don't like. I also loved the idea of a garlic lemon mayo, but I only had lime, so I searched and found a really simple recipe for cilantro lime mayo (garlic, cilantro, lime juice in a blender with some dijon mustard and a sprinkle of chili powder). I cooked the patties in the oven because I have a small babe and it's easier to set a timer and walk away. I followed the suggestion of a previous poster for 30 minutes on 400° F. I lightly toasted the buns in the oven for a couple minutes when the patties were finished, and the mayo complimented the burgers perfectly. My husband is a carnivore and turns his nose up at words like "black bean burgers" and "QUih-NOah" and he was so pleased, he even took leftovers for lunch! The burgers were very tasty on their own, but we both agreed that the cilantro lime mayo made it.

Sidenote: The recipe calls for 1/4 cup of quinoa but that just didn't look like enough so I used 1/2 cup. Also, I ALWAYS cook my quinoa with vegetable or chicken broth, never just water.

Delicious!  Best veggie burgers I've ever made, and probably the best I've ever tasted anywhere.  I did not change anything, although I did mix everything except the quinoa, breadcrumbs and egg the day before.  I refrigerated that mixture, adding the last 3 ingredients just before I mushing it up and cooking the burgers.  Excellent recipe!

These were fantastic! For those claiming a lack of flavor, I attempted several things. I doubled this recipe and since my beans have come out too dry before, i left a bit of bean juice in my mixture to help moisten the beans during cook time - I think the juice adds nice flavor to this recipe. Also, for my quinoa - I used a box version that came with a garlic/herb seasoning. I figured - since there was garlic already in this recipe, the garlic from the quinoa would fit. I did add about 1/3 of a cup of corn to my mixture for some sweetness since I did't have any bell peppers on hand. I made these into tiny patties - made about 20! These held up very well during the cooking process and taste delicious! A must try!

It is good, however if you are serving to a true vegetarian, you would have to leave out the egg.  I also did a lot of substituting for veggies.  It is a good guideline recipe, can change it up quite a bit.  But ask your vegetarian if they eat eggs before you serve them!

It was good. I would just add more salt, more hot sauce, and/or some black pepper to make this more flavorful. Once it's between the bread, the flavor of the patty will likely be overpowered, so no need to hold back on flavor. Also, yellow peppers are just expensive but not necessary. Can sub with any other veggies.

For all you vegan lovers, these are a staple in our home. Only modification is replacing the egg with a flax egg (1 Tbsp flax seed + 2.5 Tbsp water, let rest for 5 min). Don't forget the lemon garlic mayo (3/4 c vegan mayo, 2 Tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper). We top with pickled onions (they're oh-so simple...google it), thinly sliced cucumber and tomato. Seriously, doesn't matter if you're vegan, veg, whatever...these are just plain awesome!

I doubled the recipe. I sautéed all of my vegetables and then put them in the quinoa black bean mix. I also had a leftover carrot that I wanted to use and I had some chicken thighs that I cooked and Ground up into the mixture. I made 12 different patties and flavored 3 sets of four patties differently.  This allows me to very the flavor as I will leave this all week for lunch two patties each lunch. I purchased some fresh mozzarella and used my favorite hot sauce.

Very happy with this recipe, that is quite quick and easy to do... And totally tasty. It was even a success with my very picky teenage brother (and I can't start to tell you how much he likes his beef burgers)

My husband, a burger guy,  was very skeptical but tried them and loved them,  
They are best black bean burgers I ever had.  
I added some nutritional yeast flakes and  fresh ground flaxseed.

This was really good. I did not have chili sauce on hand but it was still good within it it. My youngest daughter does not usually like store bought bean burgers but she liked these. Even though I baked them, they still fell apart a little. Will be making these regularly.

I like this recipe, but I did make a couple changes. I used a thick flax egg, since real eggs never seem to hold veggie patties together as well as I'd like. I also boiled the quinoa in vegetable broth instead of water to give them a bit more flavor.  They came out delicious and I love the texture. I will definitely make them again.

I have been vegetarian for about 5 years now and this is, by far, the best veggie burger I have ever tasted! I have had one a day for the last four days and could eat them every day. They freeze up nicely and I think they could keep for about a month uncooked. Highly recommended!!

First time at making one, let alone eating one! Absolutely delicious! Can't call it a "veggie" burger since I didn't have any pepper. I made the patty thin so,it didn't hold together too well but I made a patty melt with the burger, caramalized red onion and a thick slice of cheddar cheese. I will definitely make again!

EVERYONE in my house loves these yummy, healthy burgers. From my husband, to my 14-year-old to my 2 1/2-year-old. As most reviewers, I adjusted the quinoa ratio, but other than that, followed the directions to a T.

The taste is amazing, all of the flavours work really well together.  However, the texture was a bit mushy. I'll have to try to find a way to make the patties a bit more firm/crispy.

I made it pretty much according to the recipe, however I hate onions so I excluded those. I buttered the buns and placed them on my flat cast iron skillet to toast them. Was a great touch. Ive tried other black bean burger recipes, but this was my favorite.

I had never had any type of veggie burger before so I wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe. I love black beans so thought this one may be a good one to try. I fixed it exactly as the recipe said and my husband and I loved it! I served on a bun with a tomato slice and a little raw onion and thoroughly enjoyed every bite. Didn't miss the meat at all. I will definitely be making this again soon and looking into other veggie burger recipes!

My only changes were to use garlic powder (no fresh on hand) and ground cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce (no hot sauce on hand). I loved this!  And to my surprise, my very picky husband loved it enough to ask for seconds.  He ate so much I had to make more for my work lunches this week.  I was surprised that this had so much flavor.  In the future I may change this some by adding other favorite ingredients as suggested by others, but right now this is terrific as is.

I make these quite often (and pair them with homemade baked spicy fries). I'm vegan, so I substitute the egg with a flax meal mixture. And because I never have yellow peppers on hand, I make these with red peppers, but otherwise follow the recipe as written (although I do cook them longer).

These burgers are delicious. I made mine using dry beans that I cooked ahead of time. One issue I had was that the mixture was way too sticky and I had to add extra quinoa and bread crumbs. I substituted green pepper for yellow pepper, and I added some chili powder. I also wrapped the extras up in parchment paper and froze them for later. They cook well after being frozen!

I made these for Father's Day lunch at the lake.  Everyone loved them!  We'll be adding these burgers to our regular menu.  I would suggest reading the comments, there are a lot of great ideas for incorporating things that you have on hand.

So delicious, the perfect stay-together black bean burger!!! I added 1/4 cup of roasted corn and served with avocado and "fancy sauce" (ketchup, yellow mustard, brown mustard, mayo). Highly recommend!

I had a luncheon for 8 and served these burgers with patty pan squash.  They loved everything.  Most ate the burgers (which my husband cooked on the grill) without a bun.  Most wanted the recipe as well.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 can of checked peas and 1 can of black beans, which I chopped in the food processor. I also added sautéed mushrooms, vandalia onion and green pepper.  Sooo good.

Lots of compliments received!  The only change I made was substituting quick oats for the bread crumbs. I also cooked the quinoa with chicken broth.

YUMMY!!! In the pan, this cooked up with crispy edges like it was grilled on the barbie.   I used 3/4 cup already cooked quinoa instead of dry quinoa & water then substituted an equal amount of rolled oats for the bread crumbs.  I didn't have any hot sauce but used worcestershire sauce.  Hummus was spread on the hot burger and devoured!  Might be nice with some BBQ sauce on top, too!  This is a solid recipe, no matter what individual changes you make!  Since it makes 5 burgers, I couldn't wait to fry the next one and now I have to make more...

My first attempt at a veggie burger and they were delicious! We subbed shredded carrots for peppers and left out the hot sauce, then served on fresh olive ciabatta buns. Would definitely recommend this!

This recipe turns out to be tasteless. I am sure there are others that can pull out a better vegetarian taste of them. I had to add a salad with a nice dressing to make up for it. It was very disappointing to spend an hour cooking, making a mess of the kitchen so that at the end I had a tasteless dinner that I only ate because it was full of protein. Nevermore

Best recipe that I have tried in ions!!!   Following the lead of other reviewers I used rolled oats instead bread crumbs, added a bit of chopped parsley and cilantro, and sprinkled a bit of Montreal steak seasoning on one side of each burger before I baked them (350 for 20 minutes then flip and cooked another 10 minutes).  I used Boston lettuce for the buns and served with sweet hot mustard & tomato slices.  I melted pepper jack cheese on some but they are wonderful with or without the cheese.  My daughter and I just finished off the leftovers for breakfast.  Fantastic!

I added 1 grated zucchini and about 1 whole red bell pepper.  I also added a little chopped jalapeño and it was great!  I have enjoyed the patties on a bun, in a tortilla and crumbled for taco salad. Excellent!

These were really good. And the best part is you can add and remove whatever you want. I baked them on a pan as suggested by another reviewer. They got a bit crunchy on top but certainly not inedible. I will try pan frying the next time.

I doubled the quinoa and left out the olive oil. I formed them into 12 sliders instead of 5 regular parties. Then I baked them on a greased cookie sheet as opposed to pan frying them. The smaller size helped keep them formed and not crumbly.
I also leave out the hot sauce and let my husband put it on his OWN!

These are delicious. I added a dash of oregano and used green pepper instead of yellow because that is what I had. I will definitely make these again. Even my two year old liked them.

Very tasty! I baked at 400 for 30 min. I used quinoa that was cooked in veggie broth, and substituted oatmeal for the bread crumbs. I also added 3 tbsp of hemp seed. Use plenty of spices like onion and garlic. This was relatively easy. I blended it all in my food processer, which made it slightly gooey, but it firmed up with cooking.

With the exception of replacing the bell pepper with 1/2 cup diced mushrooms,  I did everything exactly as the directions dictated. The texture was fine, and the spices were nice, but I thought the taste of the black beans overwhelmed. My husband enjoyed them just fine for a vegetarian dish.

It's unanimous...these "burgers" are really delicious! Instead of frying them, I baked them for about 20 minutes at 200C. The recipe is really forgiving. You can add whatever you want to it. For example, I went half whole grain crackers and half oats, like one reviewer suggested. Also, I had extra quinoa and beans, so I threw them in with a bit extra of everything else. Do it! Make these! You'll love them.

This was a pretty good recipe! A few changes: definitely use a lot more garlic, and more onions and peppers (and actually cooking the garlic, onions, and peppers beforehand would be fantastic with this). I went ahead and added a chili pepper to this also, and it added a nice kick. If I make this again, I will try adding in some sauteed mushrooms, and maybe some celery and grated carrots. Overall, this recipe is a pretty good foundation for black bean & quinoa burgers!

I made these and the flavor is awesome!  I added lots of spices and herbs along with the original recipe like 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, a splash of Liquid Aminos, 1/2 tsp. Gravy Master, my favorite mix of Greek and Italian herbs, fresh chopped onion along with the dried flakes, finely chopped mushrooms, finely chopped red pepper, Smoked Paprika, and a little Chipotle Chile Pepper seasoning.  I also exchanged egg with golden flax meal, 1 Tsp. To 3 Tsp. water for a more vegetarian take.  I used Ancient Harvest Quinoa Flakes in place of breadcrumbs and oatmeal.  I am gluten sensitive.  I cooked the quinoa in Better Than Bouillon vegetable base, about 1 tsp.  Lots of fresh garlic.  No bread for me.  I served it up on a bed of lettuce with thinly sliced tomatoes, with roasted red pepper hummus and a dollop of my homemade salsa and plated with fresh slices of avocado, zucchini fries and dill chips.  Yum yum!  The biggest problem I ran into was the wetness of the mixture.  Very sticky and hard to mold so I added a little Almond flour to dredge and shape.  I also liked baking in the oven better than frying pan.  I tried both to experiment.  You can always take the oven burgers to heat in a little oil when your ready to eat and just sear both sides.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.  It's just the base for many creations yet to come.

These turned out pretty good.  Next time we will add something with a little kick for some flavor, maybe substitute sriracha for the hot sauce and double the amount and possibly more garlic.  Overall though, a great meal!

After reading other reviews, I decided on rolled oats in place of bread crumbs, and used about twice as much quinoa. I threw in some dill and parsley because we had some extra lying around, and I think that helped add flavor. The burgers came out pretty good. I'd make again, but it wasn't like an explosion of deliciousness, and I usually enjoy home made black-bean burgers.

AMAZING. I didn't think I -wouldn't- like it, but it was WAAAAY better than I imagined. The smell was 10/10. Kinda crumbly, fell appart, but eh. The taste.. omg. Definitely going to make it again!

I used whole wheat seasoned bread crumbs, so that might have enhanced the flavor a bit.

These were very tasty.  I let them rest in the fridge for an hour after I formed them and then I baked them for about 30 minutes.

I used green pepper because that's what I had around, and cayenne pepper instead of cumin. My husband loves it! Great with salsa or ketchup and mustard.

This is so good!!!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Made the patties the night before and refrigerated them so it was really quick after work.   Served this on a pretzel bun with chipotle ranch dressing and sweet potato fries on the side.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Have made this recipe a couple of times. Good, healthy, versatile. First time cooked as burger patties in olive oil in fry pan to get crispy exterior, took a while to crisp. Second time made larger batch, split into baggies and froze some. Allowed me to use smaller amounts, keep on hand in fridge, sprinkle on plain grill (no oil) for more crispy 'ground hamburger' type to add to wraps, noodles, etc. Very handy to use this way.

The recipe amounts were right on, the patties held together perfecty, the flavor was tasty. Would definitely make again. My only changes were: minced carrot instead of yellow pepper because of what I had on hand, a teeny bit of veggie stock in the quinoa while cooking, and a little less cumin because of personal preference. Served with an avocado cream sauce, corn, and cheese.  So good!

Great as a burger or plain (even cold!). Next time I may reduce the cumin a tad but that is just preference. My meat-living husband even commented that we can have these again!

These were pretty good but mine didn't stay together well. Maybe less quinoa next time. Will make again with some tweaking.

I tried this with black eyed peas and the result was excellent. I also added some parsley, dill and fresh mint and I believe they fit quite  well with the mixture. This became my favourite burger.

Even my meat loving husband enjoys these patties and finds them filling enough to not miss beef! I sauté the veggies before adding to the mix and find the best way to cook them is on a silicon mat in the oven, 20-30 minutes at 350 and they turn out great with a nice crispy outer crust which adds great texture.

Very good and much better than the frozen versions we buy. I added a bit more cumin and 2 tsp. of turmeric. We served it with a tomato and onion chutney. I chose a side dish of green beans with lentils and coconut to compliment the burgers. This is a keeper.

Great burgers! As suggested by other reviewers I substituted oats for the bread crumbs. I also added 2 tbsp Tamari and 2 tbsp tomato paste for extra flavor. My daughter (who is not all about vegetarian fare) said " this is the best burger I've ever eaten!" WIN.

I did not use the hot sauce, added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, and used 1/3 the cumin called for.  This was very tasty and moist.  I was trying to replicate a recipe from White Chocolate Grill and this was pretty darn close.  Thanks for the recipe!

My daughters are vegetarian, and my wife and I are not, so I tend to not know much about vegetarian dishes.  Well, I made these for them, and they went bananas!  They have eaten it 3 days in  a row!  hahahaha.  I  highly recommend this dish!  It's quick, easy, and delicious!

Very easy to make once I got going...I was a bit intimidated at first! Followed exactly except I added red, yellow and green peppers along with the onion. I froze them and baked in the toaster oven the next day. That gave them a little crispness and they didn't fall apart that way. Honestly they were a bit bland, but not dry at all. I should have used more garlic and I also didn't have hot sauce so that was missing but you can always add it on top. They are good but definitely go up a notch on all of the spices and maybe play with herbs. I was thinking cilantro may have been good to include. Will definitely play with this again. But I need to eat these 8 burgers first lol. A dollop of guac or low fat sour cream would also be a great topping I think.

A great recipe with lot's of wiggle room for variation.  I make my beans from dry so I used 2 cups cooked beans.  Already had quinoa cooked so I added 3/4 cup.  I added cilantro.  I cut the hot sauce in 1/2 but next time I will use the full amount.  I mixed mine up in the food processor.  Thanks, this is my first time making them myself.  So much better than store bought.

Delicious!!! I added ginger and garlic salt. I substituted mashed tomato for the yellow pepper since that's what I had on hand and I had to add about 3/4 C more breadcrumbs to get to a good consistency. 

These were absolutely wonderful especially since I don't eat meat and this was just filled with protein.

the taste was good, but even adding additional quinoa and subbing in oatmeal for breadcrumbs i find it impossible to get a 'burger' either by frying or baking. even after letting the burgers set up in the fridge. so either there needs to be less wet, and it's hard to split an egg, or maybe the beans need to be mushier. they do freeze well and i find that baking them with a bit of oil on top and bottom makes a nice crispy top, but you have to eat them in a tortilla because they start to break up once you try to scoop them off the baking dish.

This is the first time I've ever made, much less eaten a veggie burger and I have to say it was out of this world!!  I read the reviews and followed the recipe to the letter accept I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper (it did not make these burgers hot in any way).  I also used Planko plain bread crumbs.  Baked in the oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees each side as was suggested by a reviewer and the results were a perfect dinner!  Served on a bun using Ranch dressing instead of mayo or mustard, a small sprinkle of Monterrey Jack cheese,  even my picky husband raved over them!  Thank you so much for the recipe!!

I've been looking for a good base recipe for veggie burgers and this is the keeper. I had to omit the bell pepper because I didn't have any, and used sriracha instead of standard hot sauce. They came out great. I'll be making many versions of this recipe for years to come.

I made this recipie but did not realise I was out of quinoa, so O substituted some cooked (and cooled) pearl barley.  Even with the slight change, these black bean  were the best I have ever had!

My family, even my carnivore fiancee, LOVED THEM and begged for more.

We served them with salsa, sour cream and grilled corn....supurb summer dinner.

TIP: Double the recipie, form the mix into patties, sear them off and then freeze them on a cookie sheet.  Once frozen, they cam easily be placed into frezzer bags or vacuum seal bags for later use.  To use the frozen patties,  pull them from the freeze and allow them to thaw in the refrigerator over night.  When you are ready to eat, juat sear off thr burgers in a skillet with some nonstick spray.or a bit of olive oil.  This makes for quick and easy weeknight meals!

Super delicious....easy to make and freeze the extra and the taste is the same delicious, I followed the the recipe for the most part and they  didn't fall apart. I added walnuts and extra hot sauce to the mix.  Super delicious...now I can never buy per-made or fast food veggie burgers again

I gave up meat for 30 days, and saw this recipe. It was delicious! The only change I made was that I used panko bread crumbs since it was all I had at the time, and also added 1/2  tsp of tumeric, I used Sriracha instead of Franks Hot sauce.  My Hubby said he could eat this anytime and he's not big on vegetarian food. Thank you so much for sharing! This is definitely a keeper!

I make these all of the time and the only changes I make is to use ground up oatmeal (using bullet or ninja type grinder) instead of bread crumbs.  Make sure to chill the patties really good after you form them so they will hold together when frying.  Even my husband, who really hates anything healthy, loves them topped with queso and a side of tortilla chips! I top mine with avocado, tomato, and a dab of mayo.

I wasn't too sure about these when I tasted them after taking them out of the oven, but once I put all the toppings on they really were very good.  I followed other reviewers suggestions that I thought sounded good.  I used oatmeal in place of breadcrumbs, chipolte tobasco for the hot sauce and added a few TB cilantro.  I  could only make 5 patties with the recipe.  I patted the beans dry and refrigerated the patties for 15 minutes prior to cooking as those were recommendations made to help them keep their shape.  I also baked them in the oven and broiled them for a few minutes to brown them.  I would say they were quite delicate to handle and I had one patty break apart, but overall it worked pretty well.  I eat beef burgers as well, but these were a nice change of pace!  Update: I also have added a squirt of mustard, dash of worstershire, lime juice,  1/4 tsp cayenne, 1 TB chia seeds and 1 TB flax seeds.  I gave one to my vegetarian friend and he said it was the best veggie burger he's ever had.  I also froze patties and that worked great!

I've made these several times and found them to be a great, healthier alternative to meat.  I found them to be best when topped with sautéed onions and red peppers, provolone slice and your favorite hot sauce.  Toast your buns for a most enjoyable burger!

Made the vegetarian burger and even though I didn't add all of the ingredients, got a little creative by doing a little substituting, but they still tasted delicious :-)
So glad I found this recipe, 1 of my favorites :-)

So good! I used veggie broth instead of water to make the quinoa (same proportion as in the recipe) and substituted grated carrot for the yellow pepper, because my daughter hates sweet peppers. (When she's not eating with us, watch me make them with lots of yellow and red peppers!) I also didn't have hot sauce, so added a rounded half teaspoon of chili powder and cut the cumin to an equal amount (the original amount sounded like a lot to me). I can see how everyone says the recipe is so adaptable, because it clearly is. My husband loved them and ate two--and he thinks he doesn't like quinoa! I sliced an avocado on top and added a little ranch dressing--my husband used catsup. I thought about caramelizing some onions for a topping, but there's so much onion in the patties I thought it would be overkill. Tip: Whoever said to chill the burgers in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before cooking is a genius--I had no trouble with the burgers crumbling or breaking when I flipped them over. Can't wait to make again.

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the garlic and added black pepper due to a few reviews commenting on these burgers being bland. Refrigerated for an hour before grilling on the BBQ for 6 mins per side (it held up perfectly). Ate it on a bun with salsa and goat cheese... will definitely do again.

I made this recipe with some modifications,  I used the recommended can of beans, egg , and bread crumb proportions but I also added half a can of chick peas that I mashed up, half a cup of corn, and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, fresh parsley and chili powder.  Then I added a sprinkling of  bread crumbs on the patties before frying up to make a crunchy crust.  Awesome!

Great recipe! I was surprised by how yummy the burgers were. I mashed the beans and the onion in the food processor, separately. I also used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs but I put them in the food processor first to make a flour. The burgers baked on a greased pan for 15 min each side at 350. Sounds like a lot of steps but it was quick and easy. My husband liked them!

Great recipe.  Versitile. I didn't have quinoa on hand, but I had millet worked fine.  I'm guessing you could add other veggies within reason and have a good product.

Delicious. What a great idea -very versatile and easy to adjust flavors to suit your own taste. I served it with a lemon mint oregano and  mayo sauce. We liked it a lot. The leftovers reheated well, too.

My husband loved it!  Said it was the best non meat burger he'd ever had.   I didn't have the yellow bell pepper or hot sauce so I left them out.   I used Italian season breadcrumbs.

This was my first time making a veggie burger and I was really impressed!  I'm not a fan of peppers so I subbed in grated carrot and zucchini. However this bulked up the mix enough that I had to add about 1/4 cup of extra beans (I ran out of black so I used Northern White) and some more onion/bread crumbs/egg white. I served mine with lettuce and tomato, cheddar, and a ketchup/sriracha mayo mix on a whole wheat bun and I really enjoyed it. I was able to make 6 patties with my additional ingredients.

It was extremely mushy and tasted only OK. I sincerely believe it's missing a flavor in there. I couldn't taste the hot sauce heat either and I think there was way too much cumin. That's essentially all I tasted. They also looked nothing like the photo. I ate it, but I wouldn't make this recipe again.

These were really flavorful.  I made it exactly as written except for the egg.  I was feeding a vegan so I used a substitute (1 T. ground chia seed mixed with 3 T. water).  They did tend to crumble when I was frying them but the flavor was delicious.  I'd make it again whenever I have vegans/vegetarians in my house.  Served with Sriracha mayo.  Yum!

Followed the directions exactly for the burger patties except I baked them at 400 for about 18 minutes.  Flipping them halfway through.  Served on a wheat bun with garlic aioli, a slice of tomato, baby spinach and caramelized onions.  Absolutely delish

Add cilantro, cooked the quinoa in beef broth, pureed the black beans into a paste, added about 3 tbsp of olive oil to the mix as well...it was perfect. Went very nice with some yam fries which were fried using a thin tempura batter.

I will definitely make this again!!! I did make some alterations to it because I don't like black beans and wanted to go to a gluten free option so I replaced the bread crumbs with gluten free rolled oats, then the black beans with dry pinto beans...I also used seasoning salt rather than the traditional salt...next time I will be adding a few more spices to give it a deeper flavor, but overall it was amazing!!!

Delicious... Everyone that has tried it has liked it.  My mom is a vegetarian and I was looking for a recipe to try for her for awhile but stopped looking because the recipes I found at that time were a lot of work.  I came across this recipe and was immediately obsessed with having to try it! It is as delicious as it looks and reheats as great as it tastes the next couple days.  I added alittle A-1 ( like aT) and Canadian steak seasoning to it since we like this with real burgers and it is fantastic. Have made twice and like suggestions, we like it even more when we turn the oven off and let them sit in there for like an extra 20 minutes. This will be made very often from now on... Love them!!!

So, since this was our first pass, we made these as written, except that I lacked the brand of hot sauce recommended and so used chili oil instead.  They were awesome.  Just became a staple at our house.  We at them on raw spinach, with fresh tomato and avocado and with some garlic/lemon greek yogurt.

I made these for my mom and dad, who are vegetarians, and they were a huge hit!  They held together much better than other veggie burgers I have made and they were delicious!  I did add a bit more water to the quinoa.  Mine boiled out quickly and quite a bit of the quinoa stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I also decreased the cumin by a quarter teaspoon -- just a personal taste preference.  These were the best veggie burgers I have ever made and will definitely make them again.

Had these at my best friend's house. They are so good. Her husband mixed some mayo and siracha for a dressing for the burger for these (instead of just plain mayo). Wow!! The flavour is amazing. Will be making these on some Friday's during Lent!

These are great!   My sister-in-law follows the recipe to the point of adding cumin and hot pepper sauce.  She divides the mixture in fourths.   Then seasons each differently.  She adds the cumin and hot sauce to one,  adds curry seasoning to another,  sriracha to the third and Thai seasoning the the last.  Then she makes two sliders of each type.

Add Liquid Smoke! It gives the burgers a deeper 'umami taste' that pleases meat lovers and vegetarians. I guess you could also try tabasco and worcestershire-sauce if you haven't got it. I've made these several times now with varying ingredients, and they've always come out delicious.

I would definitely make this again and I'm not a vegetarian. I sprinkled the patties with steak seasoning while cooking. And garnished it with a chipotle mayo and pickled jalapenos, really yummy!!! I also used red quinoa and think the color looks great

Love this recipe. I have made this over a dozen times and each time I basically do it exactly like it calls for in the recipe. Sometimes we add some curry to give it even more of a flavor. I also occasionally add goat cheese on top. My two children love it as well and I've had family ask for the recipe after I made it for them.

My favorite vegetarian burger to date! I made the recipe as written, except I cooked the quinoa in chicken stock and used seasoned black beans for a little more flavor. I used gluten-free planko for the bread crumbs. I laid a slice of cheddar on top in the last minute of cooking and topped with caramelized red onions rings and fresh tomato slices to serve. Even my husband, who doesn't typically care for this type of meal, really enjoyed it. I served the burgers with a side of homemade, oven baked kale chips. Excellent meal that I will definitely make many more times!

Reviews were right: this recipe was excellent.  I don't like to make changes the first time I try a new recipe but my daughter is a vegan and I wanted to make them for her so I substituted the egg for ground flax seed (about 1/4 cup) which worked perfectly.  I thought there would be too much cumin, but it gave it so much flavor.   They held together well.  I will definitely make these again - so easy and healthy. (and inexpensive)

My husband and I both loved these and he's a total carnivore!  I used red bell pepper because it's what I had on hand.  I also added some McCormick's Montreal seasoning and a little fiery five spice seasoning.  I baked in the oven for about 20 minutes at 400 degrees, flipping about halfway through so they'd be crusty on the outside.  Then, served on toasted buns with lettuce, tomato and some spicy sriracha ranch.  Will definitely make again!

No.  I followed it exactly even though I thought it called for  too much bread crumbs and too much hot sauce.  They were so delicious.  They were perfect and not at all dry and I live at 9800 feet altitude!  They warmed up nicely.

This is the best burger I have found! We have made this so many times and will make it so many more. I swap the bread crumbs for Ian's panko, use whatever color bell pepper I have on hand, use sunflower the oil instead of olive and leave out the hot pepper sauce. I add a quarter teaspoon of chili pepper flake, an Anaheim chili pepper and a Jalapeno. We fry in a pan and top with pepperjack. I serve on a Dave's million dollar bun with spicy brown mustard, mayo, lettuce and sometime roasted Anaheim peppers (we like it spicy!).

This recipe is similar to another on this site for "Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers".  Both recipes are great, but I think I like this one better because of the addition of the quinoa.  (I'm addicted to quinoa these days!)  I put all of the veggies in the food processor to mince them, then added the black beans and pulsed a few times to get them mashed up.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as written but grilled them on the indoor grill rather than frying them.  Really wonderful, I'll be making these again!

These were too wet! They fell apart and were difficult to cook. I ended up adding cheese, to hold them together, and more oil to the pan, cooking them until they were almost burnt. All said, though, they were pretty tasty and I might try them again.

I used quinoa flakes instead of the quinoa and the bread crumbs.  Gluten free version!  Really enjoyed the crunch of the onion and pepper, something you cannot get with store bought burgers!!

I love these.  I've made them a few times, some times I don't have the right ingredients so I just use something close.  I would suggest making sure your quinoa is nice and squishy (not mushy) or it just seems grainy, and I squish the black beans as much as I can.  I feel like the bigger the pieces you have the easier it is for the burger to fall apart, so small pieces of everything seems better.

I actually give this 4.5 stars but it won't let me do that.  The burgers were really good, not dry, not wet, didn't fall apart.  I made sure the beans were well rinsed and drained, even pressing a paper towel to them.  The same thing with the minced pepper (I used a green pepper).  I made sure to press out all of the liquid from the chopping of the peppers.  I don't care for cumin much so I only used about 2/3 teaspoon.  The burgers were really tasty and moist.  The texture was different - a little soft and pasty, but I'm not used to eating veggie burgers so maybe that is normal.  After mixing everything with my hand I let it sit for a few minutes, them formed a log and cut 5 equal sections, which made 5 good sized patties - not too small like many homemade patties are.  They browned up very nicely in the pan.  Overall these were very good and I will make them again.

LOVE these burgers. I have made them twice so far and the whole family loves them. Have subbed other veggies in like mushrooms for the pepper and even added fresh jalapeño for a little kick. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE a new regular in our dinner rotation.

Not the same texture as beef really, and it's comparable to eating a bean dip (kind of.)  However, the flavor combination is delicious and it just tastes healthy in the best possible way.  Super enjoyed making and eatin it.

I was looking for more vegetarian meals to incorporate into my diet.  These burgers were absolutely delicious!  Easy to make, common ingredients found at any store.  I make these regularly!

Very simple recipe.  My vegetarian teen is hard to please...and she loved it.  I doubled the amount of quinoa.  I may even increase it more next time, just to tone down the beans.  Definately will make them again.

Horrible. Tasteless. Very disappointed. I followed this recipe to the letter. The only thing I can say positive about this recipe is that the patties stay together when pan frying. My husband and I went vegetarian about 8 weeks ago and love it. Usually the recipes I pull from this website are terrific. But these burgers are horrible. No flavor at all. Had to dress it up with cheese and sauce to make it edible. Kind of defeats the purpose of healthy eating when you have to add the extras to make it edible. Never again ??

Wow! These are absolutely delicious. I left out the hot sauce due to the fact I was feeding my two kids and used green pepper instead of yellow. Thanks so much for this recipe.

It looks like a health food and smells like a health food, but tastes much more indulgent than any frozen vegetarian patty I've tried. I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, per another reviewer's suggestion, and it definitely kicked up the flavor. I stuffed mine inside a whole-wheat pita with hummus, feta, and spinach. My boyfriend, the world's most voracious carnivore, topped his with barbecue sauce and said he'd eat it again.

These can easily be made vegan by substituting a flax egg- 1 tablespoon ground flax seed and 3 tablespoons of water.  Let set for 10 minutes before adding.  Also added quinoa flakes instead of bread crumbs. They were delicious and stayed together nicely!

I saw this today and wanted to try it and I wasn't disappointed. It was delicious and I am not a vegetarian and was very satisfied. I sautéed my veggies before putting them in the mix( a personal preference) and added an extra tsp of Frank's red hot sauce. I topped it with a thin slice of cheddar cheese, avocado, lettuce and tomato on a sandwich thin. I will be having the remaining patties for work this week. Yummy

These burgers were excellent. I've made them 2x in the span of 2 weeks. I followed the recipe except for the hot pepper sauce (as I didn't have any on hand but I used Allrecipes' Common Ingredient Substition list and used 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 tsp vinegar). The second time I only had green peppers and used that but it didn't change the taste or texture; I would feel confident using others suggestions to use shredded carrot or other vegetable. I paired these burgers with Burger or Hot Dog Buns by Sally. First time making the recipe I made 5 patties as the recipe called for (they were at least 3.5-4 inches in diameter) and baked in oven for 30 minutes. The second time, my Burger Buns came out slider size so I halved the size of the patties (came out with 10 small ones) and baked for 15 or so minutes. What I like about these burgers is they don't fall apart, they're easy to make and they taste much better than the frozen Morning Star Black Bean Burgers. Thanks for the great recipe.

Even my husband liked these, but they don't stay together at all. I'm glad I abandoned my original idea to cook these on the grill! Next time I may try oatmeal like other reviewers did to help them stay together.

We tried this last night and it was definitely what I was looking for.  I love black bean burgers at restaurants and was hoping to find a homemade version that rivaled what the pros serve.  I made it according to the recipe but set it on the BBQ with the "real" burgers.  Granted they were very delicate and a bit tough to turn but overall a masterpiece!

Loved these burgers!  Made some changes based on what I had on hand, so for those of you that complain about people not sticking exactly to the recipe please stop reading now.  Used a can of mixed beans - black, kidney and pinto, green pepper instead of yellow, 1/2 cup cooked quinoa instead of 1/4 cup, Panko bread crumbs, additional clove of garlic.  I also baked them instead of frying - 350F for 20 minutes, flipped them and baked them an additional 15.  I ended up with 5 nice sized patties.  I will definitely be making these in the future, there is a lot of wiggle room in terms of ingredients and I'm excited to try some different kinds!

I loved this recipe! They were delicious. Definitely might need something to make the patties more firm, but either way they held together and tasted great. I would recommend putting some flour on either side of the burgers before cooking them, so they don´t burn, but have a nice golden brown color. Pair it with spinach, fresh basil, tomato, mayo and honey dijon mustard for a nice finish!

Best bean burger recipe I have found yet! My husband gets excited everytime I make them and he is a meat lover. The only change I make is add the onion and garlic to the quinoa as it cooks in low sodium veggie broth or chicken broth. So good everytime and as someone else said the recipe is very forgiving. Glad I found it!

This recipe rocks!  Both my husband and I thought the burgers were delicious.  Since the recipe got so many positive reviews, I doubled the amounts.  I used carrot instead of bell pepper, and oatmeal, as suggested.  Didn't have hot sauce (what's with that??), so I used Capsicana Zing Gourmet Sauce.  Sauteed the burgers in olive oil.  Served them with avocado, raw spinach, sliced tomato, and more Zing on toasted ciabatta rolls.  Yum!

Really good recipe! It was my first time cooking these. I used oats instead of bread crumbs, green pepper instead of yellow and I replaced cumin with chilli spice. The burgers didn't turn out dry or crumbly! I also added diary free cheese on top to add a small touch and it worked perfectly. Thank you for the submission :)

These were terrific and I didn't even have quinoa! When I discovered I had no quinoa, I decided to substitute cooked rolled oats. I used red pepper because that what I had on hand but otherwise followed the recipe mix exactly. I opted for baking, spraying each side with veg oil, 375 for 15 minutes per side. I served them with mayo-less coleslaw on top. Definitely a keeper.

These were pretty tasty, though just a wee bit dry.  Next go around I'll just add a little less breadcrumbs and it should do the trick quite nicely.

Really good, even for my meat loving son.  I removed the yellow peppers, added finely chopped mushrooms and instead of the hot sauce I used cayenne powder, it doesn't add the vinegar taste and gives a sort of deeper  background flavor.  Barely makes 5 small patties, suggest adding half or maybe doubling.  We added tomato, lettuce, guac and chipotle mayo for condiments.

These are out of this world! I used a garlic and olive oil flavored Quinoa and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. I have also made these with Cous Cous and pecans when I didn't have any Quinoa. Still fabulous!

Very good, made the recipe as written, but served it with tomato & avocado slices with chipotle mayo on a boillo roll.The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I had a little trouble getting them to stay together. I may try substituting Oats for the breadcrumbs next time. I'm also debating using different kinds of beans in the future.

These veggie burgers are so much better than anything at any restaurant i've tried. Flavorful moist, healthy, they stay together and have great texture!! They're great the next day, too. The non-vegetarians and vegetarians in my family LOVE this recipe!!  I've made this recipe twice in the past 3 weeks - they're a huge hit! Definitely one of our favorite recipes.

I have tried making black bean burgers before and they just fell apart.  These stayed together like a true burger and they taste terrific.  Even my skeptical husband was impressed!  Only change was to add jalapeno because we like spicy.

I really wanted to like these as I'm interested in eating more healthy,  but nobody at the table finished their burger except me.  I'm guessing you have to be a vegetarian to fully appreciate these. I did use these on my salad the next day, but I don't plan on making them again.

Great recipe- as some other reviewers mentioned, in order to make this vegan, I had to substitute the egg with chia seed paste (1 tbl spoon chia seed powder + 3 t/l spoons water blended).  Also substituted oats for bread crumbs...husband went back for thirds!!!

These were SO much better than my other veggie burger recipes!!!  I couldn't believe how well they held together, or how flavorful they were!  I made them exactly as written, except that I substituted old-fashioned oats for the bread crumbs and omitted the egg, because the mixture was already pretty sticky.  I also baked them at 400 degrees for 25 minutes on a lightly greased cookie sheet, turning them  halfway through cooking-time, and I finished them off by topping them with almond cheddar and broiling them for 1 minute. I'm tossing out my old veggie burger recipes and replacing them with this one!  Easy, good for you and YUMMY!

Tried this using steel cut oatmeal and egg whites. The burger did not hold together well, so I "cemented" it to the bun with a slice of Monterey Jack cheese. Very tasty. Will use whole egg and bread crumbs next time, just to see if the firmness improves.

These were AMAZING!  My husband, 3 year old and 1.5 year old all. loved them!  These are definitely going to be a staple in this vegetarian household. I did follow a previous persons suggestion and baked them at 400 for 30 minutes instead of frying.  I made the recipe again and added cilantro and shredded carrot and it was even better!

Made this numerous times.  Pretty much follow the recipe as is except I double it so I can freeze some for later.  Change up the hot sauce (Sriracha is the best) and use whatever color pepper I have, although the yellow or orange are the best as they are more subtle than green or red. Started making these when we did a three week vegan challenge (did not use the egg) and have been making them ever since.  I opt for these over a regular burger.  Baking also is easier as they have less chance of falling apart.  400 degrees for 25 minutes and then broiler for a few minutes on each side.

Awesome black bean burger recipe!  Try them with BBQ sauce!  The leftovers freeze and heat up really well in the oven.  I'm going to start making double-batches and freezing them so I always have them on hand for an easy dinner!

Everything about this recipe was PERFECT just the way it is. . .however, I do love a splash of liquid smoke in my meatless recipes for some grilled flavoring, added extra onion, substituded oatflour for breadcrumbs...my picky 4 and 6 year old girls who wont even eat a mc donalds hamburger, LOVED THESE!!

Wow this was great! I don't really like store bought veggie burgers, but I love black beans and quinoa! I used vegetable stock instead of water to cook the quinoa.    I pureed the onion/pepper/garlic. And added extra hot sauce. My burgers fell apart at first, I'm assuming because of that reason- so I added extra bread crumbs. I think next time I will use rolled oats! Yum yum!

Very nice recipe! I swapped scallions for plain onion and added in some mesquite powder, happy additions both. One tip: keep the parties on the thin side for a little crunch and serve with your favorite condiments and toppings!

Delicious, quick, easy. Previous burgers I tried would always crumble apart, the egg and quinoa are wonderful binders! Can't wait to make it again. Even meat eating hubby loved it!

Fabulous recipe!  I made up a batch of mix then froze it in smaller amounts (in balls) then later thawed the mix and shaped into burgers then cooked.
These are fabulous for a healthy  brunch with eggs on top as a substitute for toast.

These were delicious. I used green pepper but no other changes.  Even the kids liked them.  Topped them with pepper jack cheese, lettuce and tomato.

I am eating this as I type this.  It is simple and tastes great.  I will make this again.  What drew me to this one is the quinoa.  Didn't want to make any changes this time but may in the future.

My meat eater husband loved this and said it was the best 'veggie' burger he had ever eaten. I stuck to the recipe as much as possible with the ingredients I had on hand. I used red bell pepper and Siracha sauce because those were what I had, and I used a little extra quinoa and breadcrumbs to bind the burger as the mix was a bit wet (I didn't have canned beans and used some I boiled and don't think I drained them enough).  Will definitely make these again

Such an easy and delicious recipe. I modified it slightly. Subbed garlic powder for the minced garlic. I omitted the cumin and hot sauce and instead used fresh ground pepper. They came out so yummy! I think I cooked mine longer, but that's probably because I used less oil for cooking.

Great recipe! I took out the bun and replaced Frank's Red Hot with Tabasco. I then placed it on red lettuce and topped with salsa to give it a different flavor.

Love these!! Skipped the egg and substituted the breadcrumbs for smashed Taro chips for a dairy and gluten-free version and used Tapatio. A little difficult to hold the form without the egg but still delicious! Serve on lettuce with caramelized unions for a protein style burger!

This is the best bean burger recipe i have made so far. These were easy to prepare, easy to cook, and very tasty. Seasoning and spices can be adjusted to personal tastes. I do skip the hot sauce. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.

This was my first attempt at a vegetarian burger and it was rather impressive!

I used carrot instead of bell pepper and added habanero pepper sauce for a little kick.

My only advice is to make the patties on the thinner side.  I made mine a bit too thick and my teenage son called them "pasty".  

The seasoning was perfect though.  Excellent recipe.  We will be making this again.

I have been trying to sneak some healthier vegetarian recipes in for dinner for my kids so I tried this. I cooked the quinoa in broth instead of water. The flavor was actually really good but the texture was too soft- maybe some adjustments to the recipe to make the batter/dough a little less soft would help. Mel's Kitchen Cafe blog has a recipe for quinoa patties that I make frequently that have a better texture if you are looking for a veggie burger recipe that is a little sturdier.

I highly recommend this recipe for vegetarians and omnivores alike.  There's always compliments.  My only suggestion is to use reduced sodium canned black beans or delete the extra salt, otherwise the burgers are way to salty. Other than that, the recipe is great as written!

My first review of a recipe even though I've used this site for years - FAB - U - LOUS!!  My husband ate TWO of these and left the beef burgers for others.  This is the same man who said the only other time I tried a meat-free dinner, "Please don't do vegetarian night again. I need meat."  Making them again tonight and my carnivore son is visiting tonight to give them a try after we raved about them. (The only modification was the use of carrots and oats instead of peppers and bread crumbs.)

This was super easy and very tasty.  Of course, I was making jelly at the same time, so we were done eating and I was pinning the recipe before I realized I forgot the salt and cumin.  I assume they'll be even better next time.

I loved this recipe. First time I've made something from this website. I sub the quinoa with couscous and use egg white instead of an egg since that's all I had. We ate it as an open face veggie burger with salad. Made my own sauce with avocado, mayo cilantro and garlic. It came out great!

First time making or eating a veggie burger.
The only change I made was having the cumin and exchanging it for cayenne because I'm not a huge fan of cumin and didn't want a really strong flavor.
I will make these again!

Best veggie burger recipe EVER and so incredibly easy to make. These are better than anything you could get in a restaurant or buy at a store. Anytime we have a cookout I always make extra because there’s always 2 or 3 of my non vegetarian friends that decide they want these over a traditional beef burger.

Great recipe! I made some for my two year old without the hot sauce and he devoured them. Good with lettuce wraps and salsa. Yumm!

Delicious and fun to make! I can't find a way to get the quinoa and black beans to form a really solid burger. It ends up looking like tacu tacu in the skillet for me and I drizzle ketchup over it and eat it without a bun.

Tasty and super filling! I found that the burgers stuck together much better when they were baked at 400F for 10 minutes on each side.

Delish! Even my 8 year old son and 12 year old daughter (and picky hubby!) all liked them! No leftovers! I did increase quinoa to 3/4 cup and got 8 patties.

I am not a fan of quinoa but my son loves it so I decided to try these and I loved the flavor. The only thing I did differently was to Cook the quinoa in veg. broth instead of water.  Even though they slightly fell apart while cooking, I'd make these again.

Loved these!  Like others, I made a couple of changes to use what I had on hand:  brown rice, kidney beans, oatmeal, and red bell pepper.  I omitted the water and will increase the oatmeal or brown rice next time to make a more firm burger!

I never made these before and they turned out great! I used red onion, red pepper and ground oats (instead of bread crumbs). I didn't eat it on a bun. But instead had a side of sliced tomato and avocado. I will make this again.

This has really become a staple in our house.  We make a batch up on Sunday nights and then they're available for lunches - or as a quick meal if we get home late.  We add a little extra hot sauce for more flavor.  Love it!

I'm at odds with this recipe. It did lack flavor excluding the hot sauce yet the hot sauce was the ingredient the kidlets didn't like. I served it with Fresh Beet Salad and Chipotle Seasoned Sweet Potatoes which oddly complimented the burgers for the meal in general to be 4 stars.

For vegan substituted chia for the egg.  I also made this with 1 1/2 teaspoons of Thyme and a teaspoon of black pepper instead of the cumin and it made a delicious alternative.  On toast with mustard, a sprinkle of nutritional yeast and a thick slice of tomato is one of my favorite quick meals through the week!

I try to go meatless a couple times a week and have purchased several different varieties of meatless burgers.  This combination of quinoa and black bean is fantastic, much better than anything I've tried in the store.  So when convenience isn't a factor, I tae the tim and make these. I do find that these tend to crumble easier than the store bought brands, likely because they're fresh, but the taste is well woth it.

Not sure what I did wrong, but my burgers were very dry and wouldn't stay together at all. I followed  the recipe exactly, except I used oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs like a lot of others did. Literally looked like piles of bird seed...LOL

These were pretty good! Our can sizes are smaller so I added some kidney beans. I froze them before frying them so they'd keep their shape but I think they woulda fried just as well if I'd thrown em directly into a hot frying pan. I added spices and next time will add quite a few more but these were a great 'base' recipe. Next time we'll try with cilantro and guacamole.

Amazing! I did change the recipe a bit. I added shiitake mushroom, did shallots instead of onion, and lightly sautéed those before adding to mixture.  I combined pinto with black beans and also substituted the hot sauce for siracha. On top of using the 1 egg I also used another egg to coat the burgers with a brush before putting them on the pan. As an aioli I did a simple garlic mayo aioli with lemon and siracha which came out amazing. Overall this recipe is easy and so good!

This is a great place to start for Meatless Monday. I didn't have hotsauce or bell pepper so I added other seasonings, which I should have added more than I did. I increased the quinoa to 2/3 of a cup. Great blackbean flavor, great texture. Web good the next day on a sandwich with some cheddar and sour cream. Hubby and I are die hard carnivores and this went over well.

I love this recipe! Sometimes I make as is and sometimes I add cilantro.  To add protein I add 1.5 pounds of lean ground turkey and double all spices.  Sear in hot skillet then put skillet in 350 degree oven for about 10 more minutes.

Delicious! I used a tad bit less quinoa and gluten-free bread crumbs.  I served on a gf bagel with caramelized onions, crushed avocado & crumbled goat cheese. I also used chipotle hot sauce, I like a bit more spice than what this recipe called for and ended up covering the complete burger with additional sauce. I will definitely be making these again!

Great burger.  Easily made to order (added more onions and bread crumbs since I didn't want to store the leftovers; added a pinch of chili powder because I didn't have cumin).  The patty holds together well during forming and cooking.  (Now, to try to pass it by a meat-eater brother-in-law. . .)

I just made this, its a little fussy with all the mincing, etc. but worth the effort to make a quality vegetarian meal for the family.  I paired mine with a low fat version of potato salad.  I would mention that this burger may need condiments, not because of lack of flavor, but to add some juice/fat/grease (if you are trying to convince a meat lover).  I will be using a cheddar.

For being a meat lover this is a great vegetarian burger. I topped it with spinach, tomatoes, caramelized onions, and mayo. Big hit with the entire family. Doubled the recipe and got 9 large patties.

I liked this recipe, especially the cost versus frozen spicy black bean burgers! I want to tweak the spices, though - cumin is not my favorite. Maybe some steak seasoning?

AMAZZZINGGGG!!!! I was looking for a recipe with quinoa because mine was about to expire, so was my first experience with black bean burgers ever!  I've heard how delicious and healthy black bean burgers are so I gave it a shot!  The only changes I'd make is more quinoa (like others suggested).  Next time I might try baking it because they were a little mushy, but still delicious! I used all the same ingredients except I used Italian breadcrumbs because that's all I had.  The burgers were so flavorful, even my roommate who hates black beans loved it! I used the leftovers to crumble over a salad, yummmmyyyyy!

Hands down best vegan patty I've ever had and this was the first one I've made! I didn't use the egg so they didn't stay together so well, but since I made them into sliders it wasn't really an issue. Can't wait to make them again!

These were pretty good! My carnivore husband ate 4! I doubled the recipe and ended up cooking my own beans. The picky teenagers were a little bit hesitant but once they tried it they thought they were pretty good. If you are expecting these to taste like meat, you will be disappointed. Definitely a filler for a Tex-Mex meal.

These are truly delicious.  I found them very flavorful.  I added 1/4 additional breadcrumbs just so they would stick together more easily and instead of forming a patty, I formed a ball and then pressed it down in the pan.  Thank you!

Me and my meat loving man really enjoyed these. I made quite a few changes but I think thats what is great about this recipe, it is very adaptable, even for a beginner cook like me. I subbed yellow pepper and onion for minced jalapeño and minced carrot because that's what I had. I baked in the oven for 25 minutes instead of cooking in the pan. We also added bacon and avocado to the top because we had it and well, it just sounded like a good idea :)

This was good! I substituted with oatmeal (no bread crumbs), and kidney beans (no black beans). Worked great.

My husband has been working on eating better and he gave this a four star,(he is a recovering fast food cookieholic). We definitely would eat once a week! I needed to use some black beans that were getting old so I cooked them for a day in the crock pot.  I also used gluten free bread crumbs.  I did have to use more water for the quinoa to cook long enough. I am sure after trying this that sticking to the original recipe exactly will get stellar results.  I didn't have any peppers, thinking it was a sweeter pepper that I lacked, I bravely used a 1/4 c. of finely chopped red grapes and it was great.  I will definitely try  a pepper next time.  If you are into eating healthy tasty unprocessed foods then you will definitely like this! (Oh! I also cooked this on tin foil with EVOO on the grill!)

This recipe is amazing! I absolutely loves it, & so did my very critical 11yr old son. I chose red quinoa, & totally omitted the yellow pepper and cumin (didn't have any). The red quinoa & black beans gave it the appearance of a beef burger right off the grill!

I make these almost weekly!  Husband, kids and meat eaters love them.  I've been a vegetarian for 15 years and this is best, and easiest, burger recipe I've found.  I substitute oatmeal for bread crumbs, which I grind if I have time.  I've also found any color bell pepper works. Making the quinoa ahead of time, or using leftover, is a time saver.

I made these yesterday. Perfect! This recipee is so versatile, i used steak spices instead of cumin. It makes 4 perfect patties, easy to make. This is now my basic veggie burger recippe, to try with dried tomatoes, corn, chipotle in adobo sauce, curry, zuccini instead of bell pepper, etc, endless posdibilities. I will try Panko breadcrumbs too next time ( japanese breadcrumbs). Thanks for the simple time saving healthy recipee.

Even my picky husband and 3 year old son gobbled these up. They are amazing with a handful of chopped cilantro added to the mix, and topped with avocado and a squirt of lime juice. Will definitely make again and again.

I am not a vegetarian at all, but I like to eat healthy. I bought some Morning star black bean burgers last week and they were tough when microwaved and kind of weird. I was looking around here and found this recipe. I rinsed and drained my black beans, patted them dry, used brown rice instead of quinoa, added 2 cloves of garlic, half a green pepper, a jalapeno, and half of an onion into a food processor then patted the excess water out. Added a small can of corn, cumin, siracha, 2 eggs, and Italian bread crumbs. formed into patties and let sit in the fridge until baking them at 400 for 15 minutes on each side. DELICIOUS! 100x better than store bought and all from stuff that I have on hand all of the time. Thank you for an excellent base recipe!

Great way to use up leftover quinoa - wouldn't take the time with fresh. Make sure to add much more spices; frying with avocado oil tastes even better.

One of the best Veggie burgers I've ever had, and my wife and I were vegetarian for years.  The black beans and the cumin give it a bit of Southwestern flavor... it was a big hit with the whole family.  Very good recipe.

Pretty good. I melted cheese on top, then added sliced avocados and salsa.

I really enjoyed these burgers. This was our first time making our own patties, as opposed to store bought, and we were very pleasantly surprised!  We made a few small changes to the recipe.. added some jalapenos and upped the garlic. Quick and easy!

These were so delicious! I modified the recipe a tad since the breadcrumbs I had on hand were Italian seasoned. I omitted the hot sauce, used a little less salt, and used just a dash of cumin. These were easy, tasty and even passed the man test!

Very easy to make. I liked them better the next day, when everything could really meld together. They were a little dry, but overall a good eat.

Love this recipe! One of my favorites for sure! I didn't do the peppers last time but am making them again tonight and trying it with peppers! My most carnivarous friend will not go to vegetarian restaurants and always orders meat and lots of it, and she LOVED these and asked for more!

I was craving a burger, but didn't want to consume the meat. Found this recipe and it helped with my craving. Will definitely be making this again. Hint, I diced up a couple mushrooms and added them to the mixture. Very yummy!

I thought this was a pretty decent veggies burger. My only criticism was that it was just a little on the dry side.  Black beans have a tendency to soak up moisture in most recipes, so I'm not faulting the recipe contents.  I sliced some avocado on top of my burger and ate it without the bun.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious! I used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs (and I put in 3/4c). I didn't add the peppers, onions, or spices except garlic, as that was all i had on hand. I also added 2tbsp of chia seeds and 3tbsp whole wheat flour to thicken it up. I cooked them on our pancake grill. I cooked on low for 3-4 minutes per side. Topped with hummus and ketchup!

I changed this up a bit and made it more of a lettuce wrap.  I did more and bigger peppers, onions, garlic.  More quinoa as well.  Oats instead of bread crumbs.  I was generous with all the heralthy yummy ingredients and just baked it in a 9x9 dish without separating into patties.  Wrapped them in lettuce with some tomato slices, onions and ketchup... YUMMY!

Delicious. I made these and my non-vegetarian husband even liked them (he doesn't usually like veggie burgers). No more Morningstar frozen veggie burgers for me. It might be the seasoning I used but it tasted somewhat falafel-like.

This recipe turned out amazing! I'm not generally a huge fan of vegetable burgers but these burgers were full extremely tasty. They were a little bit crumbly but overall a really easy meal. I will definitely be making this again.

They had a great consistency, held together just fine (although, we had to be careful when trying to flip them), and had a great flavor. The only thing we did differently was use/add extra sriracha. Oh, we also topped them with provolone cheese. Grade A dinner~

I made these for lunch for my husband and me on his lunch break. We both enjoyed them. I cut recipe down to two, so I used flaxseed in place of egg, because I didn't want to guess how much egg is 3/8 an egg. And green pepper because that's what I had. Quick and tasty!

I made this last week for my family and it was a huge hit!  The texture was 95% like meat the taste with the cumin was great and all in all a great recipe.  I'm next going to try using the misture to make a meat loaf!  Then Stuffed Peppers.  The options are endless!

Loved them, but mine were a bit crumbly.  Not all that familiar with cooking with beans, quinoa and the like, so maybe there is a learning curve.

Just love, love. love this! The first patty I overcooked, so it was a bit dry. Second one, a few hours later (you see I'm experimenting here!),had sat in fridge for a few hours (flavors developed!) and I shortened cooking time and it was so much better. Didn't have proper hot sauce so I used some smoked paprika and black pepper.So good! Will enjoy this recipe for years to come! And the variations are almost endless. So happy to have quinoa choices!!!

This was amazing! I didn't have quinoa, so I used barley, and I used low sodium Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs. My meat-loving husband loved it. Really one of the top 10 things I have ever made.

I love this recipe--I've been making it for a while now.  I follow the recipe exactly--except I make my beans from dried not canned and I use the onion flakes  instead of fresh for my kids.  Everyone loves them!! I also make an version of the Lemon-garlic Mayo (lemon juice, garlic powder, and mayo to taste) and serve it all on homemade (bread machine for dough) rolls.  Can't be beat!

Made these last night and everyone loved them. The only thing I did differently was to NOT use the oil. I sprayed my nonstick skillet and cooked them in it. Saved a few calories! Thanks for sharing.

This is the best veggie burger that I've ever had.  So delicious. The only major change that I make is just misting the pain with olive oil instead of using 3 tbsp.  I try to prepare these in advance so they can set up in the refrigerator before cooking, but it's not absolutely necessary.  They stay together pretty well even if you cook them right away, as long as your gentle when flipping.

These are absolutely delish!! And super easy.  We like to top them with roasted red peppers and ranch dressing. I usually double the batch and freeze some so I can have them on hand.

These were awesome.  I substituted jalapeños for the bell pepper, and added a dash of cayenne (I love spice!).  Fried them until crispy, and topped them with a blend of shredded Mexican cheeses and cilantro. They were filling on their own without bread or bun.

I have tried a lot of different veggie burgers.  This by far is the best i have ever tried.  It's full of great flavor.  The only thing I would alter a little bit, for me it needed more salt.  And I would up the hot sauce.  Just play with it according to your liking.  The meat eaters in your family will never notice it's gone with this awesome burger.

Delicious--we loved these. Filling and very tasteful. I added about 2/3 cup of fresh minced mushrooms, substituded oatmeal for breadcrumbs, and left the peppers out. I also made a sauce with mayo, yellow mustard, and brown mustard and seved it on toasted French Bread--soooo good. Can't wait to make these again!

These are my favourite, I make em on the regular! I thought I should finally review them. 
They're so flavourful, healthy, filling and just.. :) Even my boyfriend likes them and he's a picky carnivore! 
I like to eat mine with some nayonaise, mustard, sliced tomato, spinach and purple onion on a whole wheat bun. Love love love!

This was so good! Just what I was craving since I've developed an odd aversion to meat this pregnancy.  I didn't change a thing, and took the advice of the submitter and served this with caramelized onions and baby greens on top. I also made a garlic-lemon mayo to go with it. Yummy!!

Used quick oats in place of bread crumbs in first test batch.  Tried pan-fry and baking methods.  Both worked great but prefer baking to reduce fat.  Re-heated leftover burgers tasted great too.  I'm a fan.

These were great! The recipe is very forgiving. I added extra vegetables and thought the mx was too wet, so I decided to add an extra can of black beans, then another egg. I ran out of bread crumbs, so I added some panko and crushed saltine crackers. Then, since I was getting so crazy with it anyway, added some leftover feta from the fridge and nutritional yeast (b-12 vitamins, protein & more fiber). I baked them @ 400 for 30 minutes as another reviewer suggested, than fried them for a few minutes on each side. They came out great - not mushy at all. This version yielded 7 BIG patties. We ate 2 and froze the others for later. Thumbs up!

These were just great, although a bit dry after baking them.  I increased the quinoa to 1/2 cup (you need to then increase the water to 1 cup) but otherwise made as written.  I baked for about 20 minutes at 400 and that was too long.  Think I'll just try frying them next time. I topped mine with tomato and avocado and it was really good!

Great alternative to meat burgers. I like that it can be changed if you dont have some items. I found the need to cook a little longer than the suggested time. These are surprisingly good.

such a great base recipe. I didn't have any bell peppers and just used what I had and chopped it up finely (carrots, potatoes, green onion, onion)....cooked the quinoa using chicken stock. Added cooked bacon to the mix. Made some guacamole on the side and used it as a topper. It was a major hit!!

My husband loved these Quinoa Burgers.  I added things to the ingredients... 2 tsp. masala and a few splashes of sweet chili sauce.  I also used Chick Peas instead of Black Beans because thats all I had on hand (puree'd one can of Chick Peas in the food processor).  I left out water as well, didn't seem to need it.  They browned really nicely in the skillet.  Will definitely be adding this to our regular weekly meals... healthy and delicious!

I've never made or even eaten a black bean burger before, these are really good! I followed the recipe exactly except for the yellow pepper which I didn't have. I had it on a sandwich thin with a little shredded cheddar cheese, lemon-garlic mayo & pickles. Very tasty & quite filling. I am freezing the remaining patties (after cooking) & curious to see how they turn out. I did not have any problem with the patties sticking together but I did dry the black beans well, draining on paper towels on a cookie sheet & blotting with a paper towel. I read somewhere that that will help them stick together & I think it does. I will definitely make these again. Good, nutritious and versatile.

Yummmm. Mine was a bit too sloppy to make burgers out of so it turned out more like sloppy joe but I just scooped a few spoons onto a hamburger bun along with fried capsicum and mushrooms. Add a dollop of avocado and it was the perfect vegie burger.

Delicious. Didn't have bread crumbs so I used Mazto Meal. Worked pretty well, but they didn't stick together very well. Didn't matter because they were so yummy, though! Got lots of compliments at a BBQ.

Very good and very easy.  Like some others I used a little more quinoa (1/2 cup dry) and I didn't use peppers just cause I didn't have them.  I made a quick batch before I had to go to work and they went together super fast and easy and tasted great.  My 8 year old daughter loved them as did the wife.  Will make again for sure.  If you like quinoa you'll love these.

I recently won a shipload of quinoa and was looking for a recipe to try it out. These "burgers" are delicious. My daughter (a teenager) was skeptical about quinoa but after eating second helpings, she asked me to make them again. I also made homemade guacamole to top the burgers. Following other reviewers I substituted oats for breadcrumbs. The burgers were a little fragile. I will try panko breadcrumbs next time.

These were great! I love versatile recipes! I also added fresh parsley to the mix, there were other things I added but honestly don’t remember. I’ve made the recipe as is too – just great. I decided to try out my George Forman grill that my mother had given to me a year ago and grilled some mushrooms, peppers and red onion to add to the burger. The patties I fried in olive oil and butter. The burger was great and the patties are so delicious I always end up eating one fresh out of the pan while cooking the rest. Cheers, thanks for the recipe

This burger has great flavor.  I used just a little more hot sauce but other than that, I stayed with the recipe. I think it needs more body to it in order to contrast with a bun, so we just eat it on a plate as bean patties. This will be a frequently used recipe in my file.

Surprisingly good.  My kids (19 & 27) wanted this for dinner, so I gave it a try.  I added a few things (worcestershire sauce, some onion powder and garlic powder)along with all of the other items already in the recipe.  I used multi-colored quinoa, and put some Worcestershire and beef bullion in the liquid--I think the dark quinoa helped add to the "burger" look.  I used 3/4 of uncooked quinoa.  The recipe with my adjustments made 5 large burgers.
While I prefer a turkey burger, my kids loved them, so they'll go into the rotation.

These were excellent.  The texture of the quinoa is great, and the patties look attractive with the colorful bits of pepper.  I used oats instead of bread crumbs as some reviewers suggested, and maybe that's why my mixture seemed much too wet.  I added a little cornmeal and wheat flour to help dry the mixture.  I started with dry, cooked black beans instead of canned and I omitted the salt, in order to reduce sodium.  I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks!

This is the second time I've made these. I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and used 3/4 cups quinoa insead of 1/4 cup. These are absolutely delicious! I got 6 burgers. Ate one tonight and froze the rest!

These burgers are great! The only substitutions I made were carrot for the bell pepper (because that's what I had) and Sriracha chili sauce (also because that's what I had.) The burgers were delicious baked and then browned in the skillet. My non-veggie husband loved them and actually said he prefers them to regular burgers...and he loves my burgers. These are a hit! Enjoying the leftovers now. Thanks! -Kimberly Cochrane

I made these as is, but added about 2T frozen corn.  My husband and I LOVED them.  I froze half of them to reheat.  No more soy-based veggie burgers for us!

Excellent recipe; so filling and tasty! I did use cayenne pepper and jalapeno rather than hot sauce, and I did increase the cumin, but other than that I followed the recipe. These are just as good when you bake them. I plan to make more and freeze them so I have them on hand for those days when I don't feel like cooking or don't have time. Thanks for sharing!

Love these burgers!! So delicious, and they are pretty easy, although cooking the quinoa does add some time.  I usually skip the onion and garlic, and substitute onion powder and garlic powder, to save time.  Really good with some lemon-mayonnaise, fresh spinach, and sliced avocado, on a toasted whole wheat bun.

The BEST black bean burger I ever tasted.  I also used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.  I don't like raw onions so I sautéed them with some red peppers in a little olive oil.  Delicioso!

We enjoyed these burgers.  I need to fry them for the full 3 minutes on the first side, because they fell apart if I did not fry them for the 3 minutes.

These were so easy to make and so yummy! My boyfriend was skeptical but thoroughly enjoyed them...I will definitely make them again!
However, next time I will definitely be sure to chop things up more finely, maybe even use a food processor, since some small bits did fall out while eating. I'll also take more time to mash up the black beans (I got lazy).
One thing I did that I thought added some great flavor was use Italian flavored bread crumbs since that's what I had on hand.
Overall...yummy, healthy, easy! :)

I was a disappointed.  I've been looking for a good veggie burger recipe for a while, and my search isn't going to end on these.  They were dry and had little flavor besides the black beans.  I didn't care for them at all, but some were impresses, so I'll give it 3 stars.

I've never found a  restaurant or store bought veggie burger I liked but these are really good. I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. I cooked it in the over since I was worried they would fall apart on the skillet. I cooked dried beans instead of using canned.

I haven't eaten meat in a year and from time to time I get a burger craving. This totally helps kill that craving! I always have all the ingredients on hand and it is a very cheap meal to make. Substituting ingredients is really easy as well. I like to use shredded carrots instead of red pepper. I never have buns so I'll just throw the patties in between two slices of whole wheat toast in a pinch. Topped with sliced tomato, caramelized onions and avocado if I have it! yum. I love the bold taste of cumin in it. I always thought the frozen patties from the store were good, but this recipe blows them away. I can't wait to bring it to a BBQ...

Wow!  This was really good (and easy too).  My husband is very skeptical of "healthy" vegetarian food, but after making it even he said that we need to make it more often.  I also agree with others that this is very forgiving...we didn't have any bell peppers, so we left them out, we also used a little more onion, bread crumbs and franks than the recipe called for.  Would definitely recommend trying these!

Fantastic!  Served on a whole wheat bread with a bit of mayo, grilled onions/peppers,some melted parm cheese, and sliced tomato...oh, so yummy!! P.S.  They freeze well (froze them uncooked), too!  Just gently defrost only partially - still slightly frozen or will fall apart - place in pan and fry about 3 min each side.

Aaaaahhhhmazing. My husband said it far surpasses the chickpea burgers I've made in the past. We're going to add a little more seasoning the next time - maybe some pinch of smoked southwest seasoning, too - but we'll definitely making it again (and again, and again).

We had left over quinoa and I ran across this receipt and I decided to make it.  This is hands down the best veggie burger I've ever had let alone made. People who like meat burgers would even enjoy this burger.  AMAZING!

I love these... I followed the recipe mostly the only thing was that I added more onions, garlic and peppers and a bit of seasoning (personal preference). I had to add more bread crumbs for consistency I would say to use a 1 cup instead of 1/2. They came out perfect my husband and kids love them and with the lemon-garlic mayo it was a total hit!!

Wow, is all I can say!  These burgers are awesome!  And it's so easy to make.  I've tried another recipe on this site that was made with black beans being the main ingredient.  It was good, but did not hold together very well and was dry.  These burgers hold very well and the best part is, they are MOIST!  I know this is a recipe I will continue to make.  I am a vegetarian so I left out the egg.  I used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs.  The burgers held together just fine.  Next time I think I may add a tablespoon or two of sweet potatoe to see if it adds some flavour.  Thanks for posting.  All the best!

Oh my goodness!  I prepared these burgers today and they were delicious.  The only changes I made were to add some dried cilantro and oatmeal in place of bread crumbs plus a little more garlic and onion (personal preference).  I did not fry them, but cooked them in a pan sprayed with olive oil.

Super good! I made these camping and they were such a hit- I made them twice in one week! I also added about 1/2 t. of ginger and some chopped us swiss cheese--Will def save this recipe and and make again and again.

Yum!!!  My burger loving boyfriend was happy I proved him wrong. We are big fans of black beans and this was a really nice new way of cooking with them and SO easy!!!
I kept to the recipe and added a slice of cheese on top then I put the burgers into halves of pitas instead of on buns to make it a little healthier and nutritious.  It was delicious and we're looking forward to having leftovers tomorrow for lunch!

Fantastic burger that tastes so much like a Let's Dish meal I used to pay so much more for that my husband thought I had gone back there again. Thanks for sharing this great recipe that will become a weekly menu item in our house.

Way to go, DownHomeCitySisters!!!!  These burgers were DELISH!  My husband said he loved them, too.  I only did one thing differently --- instead of cooking on the stovetop, I baked in a 350 degree oven for approximately 20 minutes and used 1/4 cup of brown rice as I did not have quinoa in the house...

Wow, love these.  Made them for the second time last night.  First time I baked them and liked them but obviously they are better fried!  I added some fresh parsley and carrots to the mix, also a Tbsp. of ground flax seeds.  Will make again for sure.  Hubby and kids were not too keen on them but I froze the extras(uncooked) for myself when we BBQ this summer!  Thanks for the recipe!

fantastic, easy to make, and super healthy! 

used pam instead of olive oil, made sliders and put on a bun with lettuce, tomato and happy cow cheese.

We de-vegeterianized them by putting bacon on them, but they would have been delicious without.    A little crumbly, but very tasty and filling.
