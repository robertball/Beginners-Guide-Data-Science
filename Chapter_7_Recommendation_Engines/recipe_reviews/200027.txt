I just tried these instead of the usual frying method.. Healthier and a lot less mess! Whenever I have bread loaves that are starting to go stale, or smooshed/misshapen pieces of bread that no one wants to use, those get saved up to be made into croutons... Crushing up a few in a plastic bag yields tasty bread crumbs too.

Very good.  I don't have whole grain bread in the house at the moment, so I went with the bread I had, which is a homemade cornmeal molassess bread.  I like crispy croutons, so I baked longer than recipe stated.  I almost over baked--I baked to 15 minutes, stirred, then baked another 15, which was a bit too long.  The croutons are a bit too brown but they are still good.  A total of 25 minutes of baking would have gotten the crispiness I wanted.  At any rate, I like the combo of salt and garlic.  I'm sure it would be even better with whole grain bread.  thanks for the recipe!

These were good.  Needed some extra flavor so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of the Italian Dressing Mix from this site.  This added just the right amount of kick.  Also used good crusty bread and black pepper.

Amazingly simple, but delicious! I used with a rather-ciabatta-like Asiago loaf, and the cheese added a little something exta that I loved. I just estimated the oil, probably adding more than called for, and baked it a few extra minutes.   Doubt I'll be buying croutons again!
