Wow! This recipe is GREAT! I added a minced clove of garlic and used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes, diced the eggplant small and only 1 tsp. olive oil for the saut√©ing. When it was finished I took my immersion blender and gave a few quick pulses to break down some of the veggies a bit more, but still leaving lots of little chunks. All I can say is that it is delicious warm or cold, on toasted bread or off a spoon! Yum!

This has been a big hit every time I've served it.  Don't skimp on the capers, as they are the primary flavor source.  I add a little fresh garlic to boost the flavor.

Everyone loved it.  I made way too much for the 4 people I had to dinner so I heated up some spaghetti, tossed it with the dip and it was delicious.

My wife loved it and that's good enough for me, being the perfect husband that I is.  Went great with toasted baguettes.

My husband and I LOVED this.  I used plain canned diced tomatoes, rather than stewed, because I love them in anything.  It was hard not to eat it before the company arrived

It was good but seemed to be missing something and could have been thicker
