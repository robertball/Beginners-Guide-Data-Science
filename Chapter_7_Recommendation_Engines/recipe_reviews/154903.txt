This recipe really worked well. I read the one review ahead of me who said they turned into cookies, and I have to admit that mine didn't do that.

The only thing that was confusing was the matter of the eggs.

You're going to separate and reserve 1 egg. The egg yolk you will mix with 2 Tablespoons of milk to make the glaze, and the white you're going to beat into the mix.

When you incorporate the eggs, do so one at a time. Ensure that you mix them all very well after each addition.

When I piped them out, I just used a Ziploc bag that I cut a 1/2 inch tip off one corner then piped them out. Don't flatten them, make nice little mounds.

I also added a pinch of baking powder just to ensure they puffed up. It works everytime. I'm too much of a puss not to do that!

Happy Baking!

These came out great!  The recipe -- which is really justcream puffs with cheese added -- is foolproof if you follow it correctly.  Make sure the oven is hot enough, and make sure you beat each egg in completely before you add the next.  You can't rush things, or you get cookies, like another reviewer said. 

I made mine a little smaller than ping-pong balls, poked a hole in each, and piped in fillings: crab salad, bacon-cheese dip, and Borsin cheese spread.  Yum!

I used pepper jack cheese instead of the Gruyere cheese to make them kind of spicy. I thought the recipe was easy to follow and made delicious puffs!

This recipe is good - no doubt.  But I made a 2nd version using already bought flaky biscuit dough and just adding the cheese and herbs/spices and then followed baking directions.  What a time saver!  Sandra Lee - whatch out!

I doubled the recipe, following the recipe exactly, but did not use leftover egg yolk for puff tops. Dropping dough by teaspoons made the "puffs" flat. Next batch I used a ziploc bag, snipped the corner, and piped the dough out in small drops; baked one sheet at a time. This was successful, but it did take a long time. I liked them, but my daughter's class thought they were a bit spicy.

With puffs like this you have to watch the weather.  If it is rainy and cloudy they will not always puff.  I used the pepper cheese and my husband loved them.  Dropped them from a pastry tube, and they puffed fine.  I am going to play with this with some other cheeses and let you all know how they turn out!

This recipe turned out great but I was wondering if you could let these turn cold then reheat them because my daughter has to do a project on french cuisine and I haped that she could bring them to school and then reheat them in the oven there?

Excellent Recipe.  They are a big hit. I followed recipe and they came out fine. I added Salmon filling and they were very very tasty.

These were amazing!!! I used half of the chill and cayenne powders that the original recipe called for and it was just wonderful.

I do highly recommend some kind of non-stick surface to bake on, otherwise they can get pretty stuck on the baking sheet (though they didn't taste any different).

My batch puffed up fine. I thought the taste was a little eggy *like cream puffs* All in all pretty good alternative to making buscuits when wanting a lighter more airy texture but the same taste.

Not impressed, unfortunately.  I did drop by teaspoon and it created cookies, but the flavor just did not impress me.  Maybe the mixture of the spices and the gruyere?  I may try again in the future, but change up the spices (too much thyme in my opinion) and maybe change the cheese as well.  Thanks for the recipe, though!

I was a bit reluctant on this one because it's a lot of work and some reviewers found it disappointing.  I made it as written when I had neighbours coming over, and a huge success.  Puffed up beautifully, very tasty.  I might try sharper cheese and maybe a sprinkle of bacon bits or diced ham, but in the meantime, I recommend the recipe highly.

Great recipe and especially yummy with the diced pepperoni! One thing I did different was use mini muffin pans instead of cookie sheets - this resolved the issue one of the other posters had with them flattening out like cookies.

Tried this recipe for a family gathering this Christmas eve. They went over great, and everyone loved them (even the picky eaters). I used 2 tbsp of a garlic chicken seasoning instead of all the peppers, it worked great and several relatives asked for the recipe. Really easy to make and a great appetizer/finger food for any gathering.

Very hard to mess these up. Substitute cheddar for gruyere and you've got an exceedingly cheap, easy, delicious, elegant appetizer.

I agree with both of the other reviewers...  Mine didn't puff very much but they taste great anyway.  They make great sandwiches with leftover Christmas ham.  I suspect that I didn't cook the mixture long enough or something...  but it came out more of a thick batter than dough.  They do taste good, though.  I may try this again, just to see if I get the same result.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe. I have made it several times with different cheese combinations, and you really need to be sure to cook the moisture out during the flour/water stage. Take your time and don't rush it, and you will wind up with beautiful, light and delicious Gougeres.

The puffs didn't stay too puffy, although I followed the recipe to the letter.  Easy to make, and very interesting flavor, they were a popular appetizer at our wine tasting.  I would definitely make them again and will see if I can keep them puffy!

This turned out really well.  We used our kitchen aid mixer and I think that helped. I added the diced pepperoni and I think that added a little flavor too. We had to cook longer based on a wonky gas oven but by testing them for doneness the batch turned out really nice. Next time I might try making ahead and reheating

They tasted pretty good, puffed up in the oven, but flattened as they cooled. I'll have to try it again.

No puff...my fault. Didn't have gruyere so I used a Mexican blend. Not enough body to make a puff, but, as cheese "cookies", they were tasty. I'll try the recipe again when I have the right ingredients.

I was making it as a meal for the fam and I left out the cayenne pepper to make it more kid friendly. I was a little disappointed that it was more of a side dish than a main course because I planned it as a main course and had a few side dishes. Overall good dish though.
