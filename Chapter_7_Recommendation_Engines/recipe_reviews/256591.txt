I made this recipes last Thanksgiving and again for Easter. It was delicious, probably best ‘greens’ flavor I’ve ever had and not greasy. My problem, and reason for only 4 stars, I didn’t find the ‘greens’ flavor held up on the reheat. (I like to make my “greens” a day or so in advance so I can air the kitchen out before guests arrive.) They were bitter.

I made this recipe using turnip greens, and they were absolutely delicious! The liquid smoke and smoked paprika give them an incredible smoky taste. The only change I made was using chicken stock instead of vegetable stock (I'm not a vegetarian). Also, I added a teaspoon of salt. Other than those two things, I kept everything else the same. I will definitely use this recipe again because greens are healthier cooked without fatty meat. My family loved them (and none of us are vegetarians)!

This was delicious!! Other than using a bit less red pepper, I  followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I both loved it; I will definitely be making this again soon.

My wife thinks she dislikes greens, but she raved and posted it on FB! I used this recipe in turnip greens. I  salted the greens while wilting. I had to substitute pear infused balsamic vinegar. I wanted a little more sweet, so I stirred in two tbsp of pepper jelly. 

It was New Year's, so I threw in some black eyed peas in the last 20 min.

This was the main course for us. I put mine in a bowl and topped with two eggs over medium. For my wife, I beat three eggs and poured into a hot small skillet. Made an egg tortilla, topped it with a little BBQ, and mounded the smokey greens on top.

These turned out really good. The only thing I ended up adding after tasting was more vinegar. The amount of liquid smoke and red pepper flakes were spot on.
