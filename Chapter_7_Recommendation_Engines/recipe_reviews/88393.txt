This seemed like it would make for an awfully dry sandwich so I made the topping for morning toast (I like something moist to counter nut butter on a sandwich like banana or jelly). I had to increase the cinnamon and honey as all you could taste was the almond butter but once I found the right balance it made for some tasty toast with orange juice and yogurt for breakfast.

good sandwich I'll add more cinnamon next time (I love cinnamon and tend to need more than everybody else in my family). thanks for sharing!
