I followed the general idea of this recipe with a few changes. I used creamed corn, because that's what I had and I used a can of Rotel instead of salsa, again, what I had. And I used chicken.  But I thought it was a nice soup. I served it with grilled cheese. I will be sure to keep this in my collection for quick dinners or to use left over chicken. I mad it with beef too, worked great! Thanks for this recipe!!

I feel a little like the odd man out after reading all the other positive reviews, but I wasn't crazy about this soup. I hoped the combination of ingredients would meld into something delicious, but it still just tasted like a bunch of canned stuff mixed together. I'm glad that so many others have enjoyed it, thanks anyway!

We loved this soup!  It tasted great, was a great way to use our leftover turkey and was so easy to make.  I substituted black beans for the chili beans and simmered it in a slow cooker for several hours and it was wonderful.

This was very easy and yummy.  Instead of turkey I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  All my kids loved it.   For those of you with picky kids who don't like 'chunks' blend the salsa in blender before adding. (I always do this to my salsa and there are no tomato or pepper chunks left behind by picky kids.)

Good quick weeknight dinner.  I cooked this in the crockpot.  Added half a green pepper and used frozen corn instead of canned.  Loved the "avocado cream"!  It was good as a dip for tortilla chips also.  Cilantro was a nice touch.

love this recipe!  make it for a dinner party of 12 and it was a huge hit! i tripled the recipe and used black beans instead of chili beans, i also added some fresh squeezed lime and taco seasoning and set out hot sauces on the side for those who wanted extra heat in their soup.  i had bowls of guacamole, tortilla chips, and sour cream and everyone added what they liked.   this recipe is so simple.  it tasted great that day and the next day and since i had some left, i froze some and it reheated beautifully just like on the day i made it.  i am making it again today because my teenage son keeps asking for it! thanks so much!

This is my absolute favorite recipe for left-over turkey.  It's very quick and easy.  I usually use drained & rinsed black beans instead of the chili beans and I skip the sour cream/guacamole on the top since I prefer guacamole on the side with chips.  It freezes well.

I changed this around a lot according to what I had on hand and personal tastes.  Used cooked rice instead of beans.  Added chopped sauteed onion and pepper, cumin, chilli powder and a touch of thyme.  Served with slices of avacado and a dollop of sour cream.  Excellent soup!

This is an easy, quick, and tasty meal.  Most of my family enjoyed it.  Even my picky eaters ate most of theirs (after picking out the tomato chunks).  I did use black beans instead of chili beans.  Also, due to taste preferences I did not mix the avacado and sour cream, but provided both on the table.  The tortilla chips tasted great mixed into the soup, and several family members also added cheese.  I offered lime juice as well.  This recipe would do well with other kinds of cooked meat and I will make it again.

Very good soup but I did make some changes to give it more flavor and to use what I had and it turned out great.  I boiled some chicken breast strips and shredded them.  I then made the soup adding a pack of taco seasoning.  At the end, I added a splash of milk to thicken it.  I served it with shredded cheese and some crumbled tortilla chips.  YUMMY!  Even the picky kids ate seconds and complimented me on it.  Quick and easy!

I made this soup last night, and I looooved it! It was so good! I used medium salsa, to spice it up a little, and it was perfect! Very, very good! I would make this even if I didn't have leftover turkey. My husband liked it, but asked me to make it with chicken next time and make it spicier. I would definitely recommend this soup...and it was so easy and quick to make!!

Very good! I used ground turkey, added black beans and my sour cream mix was just sour cream and mashed avocado. Super easy!

I used an avocado instead of the guacamole.
This is so easy to make and so yummy.  It could be used with any meat.

This was ok for a quick soup. We added a pack of taco seasoning and used shredded chicken. Advocado is the key here.

Really was quick! I didn't use the cilantro ... quadrupled the recipe...everyone in the family loved it...they argued over who would get the leftovers!!  And I'm sure it would be even better if left to simmer longer!  But in 20 minutes it was great!

This is just throwing a bunch of stuff into a pot - So, I just can't give more stars to something that doesn't require real 'cooking'.  Great for a quick easy meal, though!

I just made this tonight with our leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  Very very good.  I made one substitution.  I used black beans rather than chili beans.  My husband is not a big fan of TexMex food   but he also liked it.  Thanks for the easy recipe

I had a 25 lb turkey for Xmas and made this soup AND my stand-by turkey soup out of the carcass, splitting the stock from the carcass into 2 pots after skimming off the fat after it had sat in a cold place.  This soup won out over my old stand-by in spades.  I followed a combination of other reviewers by adding 2 cloves of garlic and cumin but added chili pepper and hot sauce rather than taco seasoning. I also added more beans (a mix of romano and black beans worked great), and two cans of corn, one sweet and one creamed corn. I used Tostito nacho chips with lime, and served it with chopped green onions and cilantro and lime wedges.  Folks seemed to prefer adding their own avocado and sour cream on top. This one was a real crowd pleaser!

AWESOME and EASY...I used a pound of ground turkey breast and sauteed it with olive oil then added the ingredients to it and voila...Tastes better with some grated cheddar cheese and sour cream.  I didn't have avocado anything so it was perfect with the sour cream and cheese.

Unbelievably delicious!  I don’t know how canned food can taste so good, but it definitely does!  Everyone I have ever served this dish to begs for the recipe.  Not only does it taste good, but it’s so easy too.  I love this soup with sour cream and tortillas.  This is one of my favorite recipes here at all recipes.

Thanks.

I used ground turkey and I liked the soup, but next time I make it I will use more tomatoes/salsa and garlic.  Good start...very adaptable.  Thanks.

I have been making this soup every week since Thanksgiving! I love it! I usually leave out any meat and just add whatever veggies I have on hand, frozen or fresh. With the chicken broth and salsa base, you can pretty much do whatever you want to it! Yum!

This is DELICIOUS and sooooo easy!!!! I used S & W brand Southwestern beans, Safeway Select Southwestern Mild salsa, and thinly sliced the avocados and added them instead of guac.I had a cooked mesquite-marinated turkey tenderloin and this could not have been a better recipe in which to use it. Plus it's sooooooo quick!!! 10 minutes!

This recipie was yummy!  I followed the recipie except I left out the cilantro (as no one in my family cares for it.)  I had it in the crock pot om low for about 3 hours then dumped it into a pot on th stove.  I brought it to a full boil and added Bisquick dumplings, and cooked for the 20 minutes it takes for dumplings.  Then I mixed the 1/2 cup sour cream with 7 oz can of green chilies.  Each bowl had yummy soup, dumplings, and a s[lat of sour cream.  Looked and tasted good too!

This recipe passed the kid test.  My son asked for me to make it regularly, so into my recipe box it goes.  So easy and made for a quick dinner when combined with some guacamole and tortilla chips.

I was surprised how good this was, considering that much of it is "from a can." I used two smallish turkey thighs (400 in the oven for 40 minutes), removing the skin for a healthier spin. I seasoned them with Emeril's Essence and garlic salt. With that seasoning on the turkey, I didn't need to add any salt to the soup. I had two bowls and my son ate the rest in one sitting. I used hot salsa and hot chili beans, which "kicked it up a notch." Whew. Good stuff!

We have been making this recipe for years.  It is very flexible if we don't have exactly the right ingredients on hand, and is always so yummy.  It is a favorite in our family!  Thank you for sharing it.  :)

I tinker with this recipe everytime I make it based on what I have in the pantry, but it is a FANTASTIC basic recipe.  Since I first made this the day after Thanksgiving last year, I have made it a half dozen times and it's always a hit.

Perfect way to use up turkey leftovers! I sauted an onion and garlic in olive oil, then added the turkey and a bit of water and 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and allowed to simmer for about 5 minutes for more flavor. Then I just added in the rest of the ingredients (and topped it off with cheese and sour cream) and it was delicious!

My husband travels in his business and has gotten to the point of hating to eat out; however, when he orderd something called taco soup, he asked if we could find that recipe.  He said he never enjoyed a soup like this one!  It sounded wonderful to me, so not a week later we chose this one because it was both QUICK and EASY to make.  Instead of turkey, I purchased canned Turkey and after the soup was served in the bowls, I added tacto strips (taco chips made into strips for dipping).  Everyone and his uncle loved this soup!
the taco strips even helped scoop up the soup as it cooled down and thickened up a bit.  Also, I purchased more sour cream than I needed, so I combined all of the guacomole container with all of the sour cream, and we had a 'dip' for the left over chips.  There was NO left over soup!  My husband, who is NOT a big eater, had about four helpings at dinner and then nibbled all night long until it was gone.  He wants me to make MORE tomorrow! and this is a man who does NOT like leftovers...and a man who does NOT want to eat the same thing more than twice a month.  this is a KEePER!!!

Fantastic! My husband and his friend kept going back for more. This recipe is so easy and the taste was out of this world. I used 1 pound ground turkey meat and used 1 package of taco seasoning mix while browning it. After the turkey was done, I literally just dumped the rest of the ingredients in and waited. I topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and blue corn tortilla chips. I did not have guacamole on hand, but I will definetely try it next time. Thanks!

I made this using our leftover turkey.  It’s a great recipe as is, but I did make a few changes.  I added garlic salt, replaced the chili beans with black beans as others did, and added a little extra bit of roasted turkey paste.  I served it with a little bit of crushed corn tortilla chips, chopped avocado, chopped cilantro, a little bit of sour cream and a sprinkling of crumbed Queso Fresco (Mexican cheese) on top.  Everyone loved it.  The soup actually tasted BETTER the next day – more like a “cooked all day” flavor.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the great recipe for leftover turkey!

FANTASTIC!  I made this soup for my husband (a CPT in the Army) after an 18-hour day outside in the freezing rain.  He said this should be the official soup of the 101st Airborne Division.  It is his new favorite soup and he would eat the whole pot if I let him.  It is great to make after the holidays to use up the leftover turkey.

I thought this was OK but I think it needs some work.  I made it exactly as directed except that instead of cooking on the stove for 10 minutes, I put it in a crockpot for about 6 hrs.  And I used homemade turkey broth instead of canned chicken broth.  My husband liked it a lot however and saved the leftovers for lunches.  If I make it again, I think I'd saute some onions first and then add a bit of cumin.  The guac & sour cream dollop was a nice touch though.

This is a great way to use up those Thanksgiving leftovers!  The salsa makes this a very warming soup. I did not make the avocado cream, as we are watching our calories, and of course it was still an excellent soup.

GREAT SOUP! I have made this soup 3 times now. Twice with turkey and it was wonderful and once with beef. When I used beef I supstituted one can chicken broth to one can beef broth. It is awesome both ways. My husband loves it. I have used Medium and hot salsa. Highly recommend.

This is a fantastic recipe, a nice treat from the typical turkey left overs. I used a medium salsa that gave it some zip. Very easy to make and quick. I did find adding the avocado mixture and serving it with the tortilla chips made it even better. Thanks for sharing an awsome recipe.

I love this recipe, it's really great for when I'm feeling a bit under the weather. I made it once with dried beans bouillon and fresh ingredients, but it's really not the same. If you stick to the recipe as written with the canned ingredients and the chicken broth, it is a whole different recipe. Great in the crock pot. Sometimes I even make it with pulled chicken instead. Thanks for the recipe!

Had a bit of spice to it, but so yummy with the cream!  We added more spices to it but will make again!  And we used chicken instead of turkey.

great soup. I have made this twice.  The second time I didn't mix the avo and sour cream. I just plopped them on top seperately and it was great taste and texture wise.

I originally had this recipe at a neighbors house and thought it was WONDERFUL!! But I have since gone on a diet. i wanted this soup badly but the carbs and sugars were too much for my plan. I made this soup by first sautaying 1/2 cup of chopped green onions, and then 1 cup of chopped celery for texture. I Omitted the corn and used rotel instead of Salsa. Also added cumin. Everything else remained the same, (except no chips)but taking out the corn takes away alot of starchy carbohydrates. I must admit that it was not as EXCELLENT as the "real" recipe, but a great substitute for a low carb type diet.

this was okay. i made it with my leftover "charlies slow cooker mexican meat" (i leave out the bottle of hot sauce from that recipe cause i have little ones but it still comes out FABULOUS). it was awesome the first night but by the next day it was totally flat of all flavor. not sure what i did wrong. if it was my meat then the recipe wouldve been flavorless right when i made it so im not sure why it rocked when it was fresh but tanked the next day.

Super easy and very good on a cold, snowy night.  Used rotisserie chicken, and creamed corn since that's what I had.  Served with corn bread.  Definitely will make again--one of our favorites.

This recipe is tasty.  I will make it again.  We used the blue corn tortillas with it.  This was about a $10 meal + about $3.50 more for the blue corn tortillas.  I used 1 lb of ground turkey.

This soup is WONDERFUL!!!  I used ground turkey and it tastes fantastic.  I hand-made the guacamole too.  It's super easy and quick to make.  This is already one of my new favorites!

I loved this soup, but it turned out a little spicy for my younger kids and that's why I am only giving it 4 stars.

I make this soup at least once a week, and have never had better reviews from my family!  The mix so nicely, and it is so fast and easy!  One of my favorite recipies ever!  My father doesn't like turkey, so instead I use chicken.  I buy the whole, already cooked chicken from the super market, and instead of cubing the chicken, I serve the soup with pulled chicken.

This is a fantastic and easy recipe that everyone always asks for!  A hit at several potlucks I've been to....After a few tries/variations, I think it's even heartier with bite-size, chopped chicken breasts instead of the turkey, and even more corn and beans.  Don't forget the avocado cream!  It really puts the whole soup over the top!!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except threw in a bottle of Corona beer and added some fresh lime slices.  I served it with sour cream, guacamole, cheddar cheese, sliced olives, and sliced green peppers.  Got rave reviews!  I loved the fact that I just threw it together and it tasted like soup you would get at a fancy Mexican restaurant.

This is soooo amazing! I made the broth out of leftover turkey carcass and left out the cilantro.  The flavors really came together and made a most delicious and unusual soup. This is definately to become a family staple!

My husband and I love this recipe -- it's quick, healthy and delicious.  The only change I made was adding ground cumin.  The second time I made it, I used the "Southwestern" packaged grilled chicken found in the supermarket. This recipe will now be in my monthly rotation.

This was great, and it was a busy night when I made it actually my husband made it while I was finishing up some homework, he added some taco seasoning like others had suggested, great use of leftover turkey, totally new flavors and easy prep after a big turkey meal can't be beat, will definitely make again!

Made this the weekend after Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  Great use for leftover turkey that doesn't taste like leftover turkey.  Didn't make the guacamole, (trying to be good after pigging out at Thanksgiving)and the soup was very good with out it.  Will make this all winter with chicken or the rest of the frozen Thanksgiving turkey.  Thanks!!

What a wonderful idea! I thought this soup was fabulous and even better as leftovers. I did not have mexican corn so I used one can of regular corn and 1/2 tblp of taco seasoning. (I also omitted the beans)

This is my first review even though I've enjoyed many recipes on this site. I can't emphasize how good this soup was. It made me look good on Christmas Day and was by far the favorite of the five soups that were offered. As others have said, it's amazing that there is so much flavor with so little preparation time and simmering. My own "tweaks" of the recipe included using those pre-cooked fajita chicken strips that are in the freezer aisle at most stores. Also, I used half hot salsa and half mild, and it was the ideal level of being warm/spicy without leaving you grabbing for the ice water or being unable to taste other food.

This was a great way to use up my leftover turkey.
I didn't have alot of things on hand so I improvised and it still came out good. I didn't have cilantro or chili beans so I used garlic and black beans in a carribean sauce and the family loved it. Thanks !

If you like Tex-Mex style food, you'll love this recipe!  Like others, I modified this recipe slightly -- spicing it up a bit by adding jalapenos and green chilis, along with adding more cilantro than the recipe called for.  

I found it to be easy-to-make and my family found it to be very tasty -- going back for seconds and thirds.

Reading some of the comments, I also added taco seasoning.  I left out the cilantro.  I wasn't sure what "chili beans" were, so I used kidney beans.  This turned out great!  The entire family loved it.  AND it worked for our Weight Watchers diet!

This is a very versatile recipe to get you through a busy night!  I didn't have all the ingredients as listed, but I had some leftover beef tips, beef broth, creamed corn, half a container of fresh salsa, small can of mild green chilies, fresh cilantro & chili beans:)  I can't stop tasting it and my kids have tried it and gave this recipe a big thumbs up!

Really easy and delicious!.. I added a dash of cumin and squirt of fresh lime.  I used leftover carne asada beef and cut the salsa down to 1/3 cup of home made salsa which was plenty for us.  I only had regular corn and a can of Hormel Chili for the chili beans.  I also sliced some avacado to put in as well and made the avacado cream which didn't make a huge difference imo you can just add the avacado and sour cream seperatley.  Hubby loved it!.. :)

My family loves this soup! I use it to use up leftover turkey or chicken and it's wonderful. I haven't made the avacado cream, but serve it over or with (depending on the style of the individual) tortilla chips and topped with sour cream! Sooo yummy!

This is great! I used chicken instead of turkey, and plain sour cream instead of the avocado mixture. It was a very hearty and filling soup. No salt needed- I seasoned with pepper, cumin, and some lime juice.

A good quickie for busy nights!  I substited cubed roast beef (as that was the left-over meat I had on hand) and used frozen corn instead of canned.  It had great flavor! Serve with the usual Mexican toppings (guac, sour cream, tortilla chips, etc.)  The boys loved it!

We used chicken instead of turkey, because that's what we had on hand.  This soup was just a little bland for our taste, probably needs some taco seasoning to spice it up, and I will use that next time.  It was good and simple, and we ate it with cornbread.  Thanks for the recipe!

Dear Janice, I hope you realize that you can package and sell this and be sooo successful!!!!! This soup alone would keep me coming back to whatever restaurant served it- it's THAT DARN GOOD!!  Super easy and so impressive, I can hardly believe it! My husband LOVED every last bite of it, too.  I added all the toppings everyone has mentioned (in addition to the avocado cream): shredded cheese, crushed tortilla chips, cilantro, and green onions.  This was heavenly. WOW.

Best way I've ever found to use up leftover turkey! The only changes I made were to use frozen corn and black beans, and let it simmer for about an hour. Delish!

This soup is wonderful.  I used two packages of the pre-cooked chunk chicken (southwestern flavor) and added some crushed tortilla chips.  EVERYONE loved this, including my Mom who is a very good cook!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great...way better than I expected since it was so easy! I used 1 lb ground turkey & browned it with spicy taco seasoning. Since I wasn't quite sure what "chili beans" were, I used pinto beans, and it's just divine.

This tastes So good and it's really easy.  It's essentially like a tortilla soup, so in addition to the guac/sour cream, add some shredded cheese on top and maybe throw in tortilla chips.  I subbed a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken for the turkey and used Trader Joe's pre-made guac.  Easy and delicious.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is always a hit!  I have brought it to potlucks and served it for family and special guests...and they always ask for the recipe.

Who would know something so easy, tastes so good.

We put dalops of sour cream in the soup with pieces of Nacho chips.  YUM!

This recipe was delicious.  Even my usually picky 12yo ate it and she had it the next day for lunch as well (she has to REALLY like something to do leftovers).  I doubled the recipe and used 1 can kidney beans and 1 can chili beans, left out the cilantro, and used cooked chopped chicken from the frozen food aisle.  Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent and SO easy!! I used black beans and "lime & cilantro" flavored salsa. I cut corn tortillas into strip and lighly toasted them. We topped our soup with the tortilla strips and cheese! GREAT way to use leftover holiday turkey!

This is a good soup recipe to use as a basis for your families likes and dilikes.  I really dislike canned corn and even though this uses Mexicorn I could still taste "canned corn" in the soup. So next time will use frozen.  It is a tasty soup though and really easy to make.  I did not use the sour cream and guacamole or cilantro as we don't care for them.  I doubled the recipe with those exceptions and added one can of Rotel to perk up the flavor.  My husband ate 2 large bowls full and said, "I hope we'll have this again!"...and he will!

My husband and I love this recipe.  Instead of turkey, I used a package of chicken tenders seasoned with fresh lime juice and fajita seasoning.  I also served the soup with cheese quesadillas for a little more substance.  The ingredients blended so well and he flavor was even better the next day!

This was so great and easy.  I did make some natural adjustments.   I sauteed some onion, red bell pepper & garlic in some olive oil.   Then added regular can corn, black beans some leftover rotel tomatoes and the salsa & broth.   To really bring out the flavor I added 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning.  When I made the sour cream/guac mixture I added about 2 teaspoons taco seasoning & squeezed some lime juice in for the kick.  My girls loved it and they just ate the rest of the sour cream/guac mixture as a dip for their chips.

Family loves this.  I use chicken boullion instead of the broth, because I always have that on hand.  I also used dried cilantro.  I serve it with sour cream, shred cheese, and corn chips on the side.  It's really good when you crush a few corn chips and toss it in your individual bowl.

Like JJGRAHAM suggested, I used black beans instead of chili beans and skipped the avacado/sour cream. I used regular canned corn instead of mexican and regular salsa instead of chunky. I did all this because of what I had or didn't have on hand.  Definitely a keeper! Thank you for The Daily Dish!

This soup is very good, very simple and very adaptable.  I used chicken instead of turkey.  My children even liked it.  Anything I can get them to eat is a good thing.

This soup is easy to make and full of flavor. Tasted like it had simmered all day,  just as Janice said. I didn't have cilantro but that didn't stop the clan from licking their bowl clean! GREAT RECIPE!

Good quick meal to make when you are tired and it's cold outside.  I substituted canned garbanzo beans for the corn and left out the avocado cream because of the fat.  It was very good last night and even better today for lunch.

Very delicious and easy!  My husband says we'll have to cook another turkey now so we can make the soup again!

Almost too easy, so I made turkey meatballs the night before and added them to the soup. Also, recommend chipotle salsa for even more flavor. This is a great recipe!

Every year we have a Homemade Soup Party - everyone brings either a homemade soup, dessert or bread/crackers.  I made this soup this year and the it was the hit of the party!  I'll definitely make this again -- fast & easy and tastes like I worked for hours! :)
