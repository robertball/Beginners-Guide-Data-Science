This is really a delicious version of pesto sauce! I made this recipe as is, I didn't sub any ingredients at all.. & it was great!  It took me literally 5 minutes to throw everything in my food processor & top my hot pasta.   I personally loved the strong garlic & lemon zest.  Next time I will use less fresh parsley, the flavor was a 'tiny' bit strong for me, but I prefer a stronger basil taste in pesto.  The cayenne didn't make this too spicy, in my opinion. However it DID bring out another level of flavor that my husband especially LOVED..  I will continue to make this recipe in my dinner rotation.  I served this on top homemade pasta (I used the recipe "basic pasta" & the spaghetti attachment on my kitchen aid mixer) & garlicky saut√©ed shrimp.

Quite delicious! The cayenne pepper gave it a little kick, I think next time I will use red pepper flakes. I am a huge fan of zest and the lemon zest added a nice freshness to the pesto.

amazing!  I made the recipe exactly and it's so delicious.  My husband and I have been eating this for days, with pasta and on bread.  Much better than store bought pesto.

I didn't have the lemon but it came out wonderfully without it and I used crushed red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne.  Froze as suggested and will be bringing it to a party with toasted french bread.

This dish is wonderful for entertaining! Easy to make and the pesto is fantastic with other recipes. Super way to get my meat and potato man to eat something green.
