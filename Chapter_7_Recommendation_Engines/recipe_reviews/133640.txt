My husband loved this recipe. I added a little of A-1 sauce to the meat and omitted the tomatoes-mix. I also used catsup,mustard, and BBQ sauce on the top for the entire cooking time. He said it was the best he has ever had! Cooking time was perfect - moist...the best.

Yum!  This was a really tasty and hearty recipe.  I did add ketchup and shredded cheddar to the top for the last 10 min. of cooking.  Next time I will add one more egg and drain the tomatoes.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

This recipe was extremely easy and a "keeper" according to my husband! I did drain the can of diced tomatoes/chili's as recommended by another review.  We both loved the "kick" the chili's gave the dish. I'll definately make it again!

I have been making meatloaf for over thirty years and decided to try something a little different.  This was the BEST and the easiest I have ever made!.  This is a keeper my family says!!  The Ro-tel is key.  Do not use any substitute.  Ummm good!  Karen - Lake Mary, Florida

This meatloaf was so easy and so delicious. Everyone in my family loved it. A few changes--I used 2 eggs, drained the Rotel and added some ketchup and a big squirt of mustard before mixing. I will be making this a lot in the future.

I know throwing in an extra bit of tomatoes probably didn't help me but we did not enjoy this meatloaf.

This recipe was awesome! I followed some of the other reviews and used an extra egg, drained the rotel, used onion powder (did not have onion flakes), and added a few splashes of steak sauce to all the other ingredients. I also added Goya Sazon on my own since I always have that stocked up. I followed one reviewers suggestion to mix bbq sauce, ketchup, and mustard and put it on top for the entire time in the oven. Perfect touch! Delicious! My husband and I love it and plan on making this our new permanent recipe... thanks so much!

I had to try this meatloaf after reading all the reviews.  On a 1-5 scale, it gets an 8!!!  I used the mild Ro-Tel and followed the recipe "as is".  It is truly the best meatloaf EVAH (as we say in Boston)!  I can't wait to try this recipe for meatballs, too.   Thank you!!!!

I have made this a couple of times so far.  It is a wonderful meatloaf.  I add Venison ground meat to the recipe along with a pound of regular ground meat.  My family loves this meal.

Not too sure about this recipe. It is very moist, but I'm not sure about the Ro-Tel in it. I use the mild version. It tasted fine, but I'm not use to that much tomato. I used 2# hamb, 2-10 oz. cans & about 1 1/2 sleeves of cracker & put it in a 9x13" pan.

Thanks for a great recipe!  I had to use what I had on-hand, but it still turned out great!  Per other suggestions, I used 1 1/4 sleeves of crackers & topped it with BBQ sauce while cooking.  Will definitely be making again!

i have been using this meatloaf recipe ever since my husband and i got married (a year ago this sunday!) and we love it!! the only thing I change is i use onion powder instead of onion flakes and I add half a pack of Lawry's meatloaf seasoning. other than that i follow it exactly and it comes out delicious and juicy every time! our friends always request me to make this when we have people over. i plan to always use this recipe. thanks!

We found the Rotel over powered the meat loaf. I will try this again but with only half a can of Rotel and none of the juice. Maybe more Ritz Cracker also.

I loved this meatloaf recipe!  So flavorful!  I did have some excess juice, but I think it was because I used 70/30% beef.  I also added a little bit of garlic garlic seasoning from Tastfully Simple to give just a little more flavor b/c I love garlic :)  I also put some ketchup on top.  Mine cooked for 1 hr 20 min. too!

This was really good and SO easy.  I used a combo of ground pork, beef and turkey and added about 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika which made the flavor over-the-top.

The flavor was awesome. I made this last night and it was a welcome and moist change from our normal onion soup meatloaf. I used 2 lbs of beef, one can of italian tomatos (that's all I had) and one can of chilis, 2 sleeves of crackers, real onion, the spices and 3 eggs. It was awesome, but a bit wet. Next time, I'll drain the tomatos and it will be perfect. YUMMY!

Way too stinkin easy!!! I was short on time (and ingredients) so I thought that trying this recipe was going to be no where near as good as the top rated recipes from this site. I was definitely wrong. Followed the recipe exactly and it was the best meatloaf I have ever had. (I like to dip mine in ketchup personally).

This was pretty good as far as meatloaf goes!!  I used 1 pkg 93/7 beef and one 93/7 turkey.   Also added woecestershire to the mix abd used bread crumbs instead of the Ritz.  I'll probably use this recipe again!

This was good, even my picky teenager ate it! The only thing I did differently was used mild rotel tomatoes. It was perfect amount of spice.

I have made the same meatloaf recipe for years, passed on to me from my mom.  For some reason, I looked up meatloaf and this one caught my eye due to the "easy" in the title.  I made it and made the following revisions:

3 Tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/3 cup Ketchup
Drained the tomatoes and lightly chopped them a little finer
Mrs. Dash Steak Seasoning instead of seasoned salt

My husband and I thought it was excellent and it may replace my former recipe as the way I make meatloaf from now on.

Amazing!!! Much less work than a "regular" meatloaf but more flavor! I didn't have rotel, so I used Totinos Medium chunky salsa. I will be making it again. My husband, who is slightly anti-meatloaf ate about 3 huge pieces. That says it all! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Very delicious! I had to leave out the garlic/onion due to food allergies, and it was still very good.  Next time would reduce the pepper in half as it was a little too overpowering.

I was excited to try this recipe with all the good reviews, but my family would not eat this at all.  It was too spicy for my kids, but if it didn't have the spice all it would taste like is a chunk of hamburg.

This was my first time making meatloaf for my boyfriend and we both really enjoyed it. I used 1 lb. of ground beef, 1 1/4 sleeve Ritz crackers, almost a whole can of diced tomatos (without the chile peppers), and the seasonings as listed. I added ketchup just before putting it in the oven. I love ketchup so next time I'll be adding more. But this is on our list of favorites!

This was extremely tasty and so easy to put together.  The texture was absolutely perfect. I did drain it towards the end. The combination of spices with Rotel Tomatoes was just to die for! A bit of a bite so if you don't like spicy, skip the rotel and use diced tomatoes or something to the like.  Thank you for sharing!

I, too, left out the onion flakes, and did not drain the tomatoes - I also used plain bread crumbs instead of Ritz cracker crumbs, and used seasoned pepper instead of regular pepper - this is one of the best, EASIEST meatloaf recipes I've ever tried - I can hardly wait until tomorrow when the meatloaf is cold, and I can make sandwiches with Provolone cheese on French bread!

Made this meatloaf for supper tonight and all I can say is that it's DELICIOUS!  I had a 10 ounce can of Rotel ( does Rotel even make a 14 ounce can?) which I put in.  Instead of the Ritz crackers I had to substitute 1/2 cup of matzo meal due to the holiday of Passover and it was still delicious.  I could only imagine what the meatloaf tastes like with the Ritz crackers, and I will try it again with the Ritz after Passover finishes. Thank you for posting this winning recipe!  Made it again using 1/2 cup bread crumbs and placed in 12 muffin cups.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes....FAB!!
Made it Nov.28/16 and realized I had no canned tomatoes so subbed salsa instead and it was equally delish!

Always looking for a good meatloaf recipe that is moist but will stay together. I think I can finally stop looking!  Didn't change the recipe, but I did add a sauce for the top of ketchup and brown sugar. Really good.

I thought this was awesome the best meatloaf I have ever made,  the only changes I made was I had some fresh green, red and banana peppers from the garden so I chopped up one of each and put into the meatloaf and used diced tomatoes with basil and oregeno.  Can't wait to make it again

I was definitely getting tired of the same old recipes and decided I was going to try this meatloaf because it looks so easy. The first time I did it with one egg and it didn't seem like enough. The second go around I made a larger portion (some to freeze) and added a second egg which immediately held better. I also added a mixture of BBQ sauce and ketchup on the top towards the end of the cooking time and it was delicious.
The only thing I haven't added are the chillis; I'm nine months pregnant and heartburn is now part of my nightly routine.

All busy people should pay attention.  Putting this together could not be easier. If you can open a can, you can make this. The prep time is exactly on the mark.  It makes a very tasty meatloaf.  I'm more used to a meatloaf that has a brown sugar and ketchup topping.  But, this was very good.  I'm personally trying to eliminate as much sugar from my diet as I can.  My boyfriend is diabetic and is very careful about what he eats.  So, I'm learning to cook to accommodate his needs.  This was really tasty.  And if you're in a hurry to put dinner on the table, do give this a try.  You won't be sorry.  (I did not have onion flakes, so I used onion powder. I had a real onion in the kitchen but I didn't bother to chop it up.) This was good and easy .  Thanks, Jillian.

I'm from new Mexico and we love our green Chili.  I used fresh green Chile and onions.  I did use ketchup and skipped the canned dice tomato with the green Chile.  My hard critic which is my twelve yr old son liked the recipe.

I was looking for a more flavorful meatloaf that didn't contain any canned or dry soup mix and thought the rotel was an interesting twist.  This was really, really good.  It had a lot more flavor than anything I came up with on my own and the rotel gives it a nice kick.  This is now my recipe and is going into the rotation.  I used 1 1/4 sleeves of crackers because I was unsure of the consistency after I mixed it but other than that made exactly as directed.  Thanks so much for sharing!

My husband kept saying, "this is soooo good".  I always know it's extra good when he adds,.."I'd love to have this packed in my lunch tomorrow—  if there is any to spare....."
The ONLY thing I did different was add an extra egg and extra crackers. I did this because I had 2 1/2 lbs of ground beef I needed to use up. I divided it into 2 loaf pans thinking I could have a lot of left overs. WRONG. Hubby and 2 boys DEVOURED, and  I only had a tiny  bit of leftovers. 
Wish I could give more stars for how ridiculously easy it was to throw together.

Loved this meatloaf and it was so incredibly quick and easy to make.  I did use two eggs instead of one and and a quarter tube more Ritz crackers than called for.  But for the first time in many attempts, my meatloaf did not crumble under the knife.  At the last minute I guesstimated a ketchup, mustard, brown sugar topping and baked it for the last 10 minutes.  This was a really delicious meatloaf and is making great leftover sandwiches.  It is definitely one of my favorites.

Both my picky kid and my hubby love this. I’ve made it both with beef AND ground turkey and it still was delicious. I do replace the crumbled crackers with plain panko breadcrumbs though and also top it with sauce (made of about a 1/3 or more cups of ketchup mixed with a few tablespoons of mustard and about 2 tbsp brown sugar all mixed well and poured on top prior to putting it in the oven). This has become my family’s favorite dinner ??

I absolutely love this recipe. My husband can eat about half of it because he loves it so much. We put the tomatoes in it the first time and were not to impressed but we love it without them. I also put real onion in it and cook it with ketchup over the top.

so, I am a bit of a meatloaf addict but this was the first meatloaf I have ever made. I didn’t change anything at all and it was simply delicious!! the Ro-tel adds the perfect little kick to the taste as well as keeping the meatloaf very moist. i will make this over and over again as the family just loves it. thank you, jillian!

Stumbled onto this recipe and it is almost exactly the same as I have been making for years. I use whole wheat Ritz crackers, add sriracha sauce (tbs), and I also put in some Montreal steak seasoning. I have had people tell me this is the best meatloaf they have ever had!

I have used this recipe for years with only one addition.  I still like a little fresh minced onion.  I know rotel has onion but I still add 1/2 small onion.  

This is the easiest meatloaf recipe ever.

I tried this recipe last night and believe it is the best meatloaf I have ever made! I made the meatloaf by using 1.5 pounds of ground turkey meat.  I made only two minor addition to the recipe by adding a packet of dried Lipton onion soup mix to the meat mixture and added a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  It provided the meatloaf with a lot of flavor.  My husband quickly finished his helping of meatloaf and returned for seconds.  I will definitely keep this recipe in my recipe rotation!  Thanks for sharing.

I always add 1/2 c. tomato sauce to the meat mixture and only 1/4 cup of milk. Adjust amounts for desired consistency.  Also, a crushed clove of garlic. For the sauce poured over the meatloaf, try using apple cider vinegar (1/4 c.), 3 tbs. brown sugar, 1/4 c. tomato sauce and a little milk. It should be slightly sweet and tomato-ery. Simmer till mixed, then pour over meatloaf, saving enough to pour over meatloaf when it is served.

I followed this exactly except I didn't use a loaf pan, just shaped it a bit smaller than my 9x13 pan. This was so good! Can't wait to make sandwiches with the leftovers.I used mild Rotels and didn't drain them.

Very tasty and easy.  I keep odds and ends of stale bread in the freezer to use for breadcrumbs and used that instead of crackers.  I used a little over 2 lb. of ground beef and baked for 75 minutes.

My husband loves my meatloaf but I wanted to try to zing it up a little. I made 4 changes to this recipe. I drained the Rotel. I used 1/2 c. oatmeal instead of Ritz crackers because I had no crackers. I left out the chili powder. And I topped it with a brown sugar and ketchup mixture during the last 10 minutes of cooking. It was a hit.

Really yummy meatloaf! I used a smaller (10 oz.) can of Rotel, and Club crackers. I made a topping of 1/4 Cup Barbecue sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, and yellow mustard to taste. My husband loved it!

Normally I like to try recipes as they are, but I did not have the rottelle tomatos so I used about a cup of crushed tomatos and added some goya salsa verde in place of the chiles in the tomatos.it really turned out delicious and moist,I also brushed some barbecue sauce on top and divided into two loaves that cooked in 45 minutes.thank you for the inspiration!

Boyfriend was craving meatloaf so I prepared this for him last night. I was impressed with the rave reviews and was hoping he would enjoy it. He "OOOOhed!!! & AHHHHHHHed!!!" and devoured it with gusto. Then he went back for another large serving and licked the plate clean..... Needless to say, this recipe is a keeper.

This was my first time cooking meatloaf. What an easy and yummy recipe! I followed it to the letter -- the only modification was to use the milder version of rotel for the kiddos -- and it turned out pretty tasty. My husband was thrilled and my 19 month old ate it with gusto! It did not slice well for me (so moist); however, we'll make this again!

Thank you! Thank you! I have been married almost 4 years and have put off making meatloaf for the fear of it turning out terrible. This recipe was fantastic!! I omitted the tomatoes and peppers combo, and replaced them with a healthy squirt of catchup, bbq sauce, mustard, and some extra spices into the meatloaf mix. Then I decorated the top with catchup for the entire baking time. I would only recommend that you empty the grease out half way through the baking time, or at least the last ten minutes, and then set the oven to broil for those last ten minutes. I loved the added crunch on top!!! I used 80/20 beef and the grease was still excessive, but nothing a little emptying half way wouldn't fix. My husband loved it too; thank you again!! I will not be afraid of meatloaf any longer :)

Giving 2 stars because it wasn't 100% bad...but  Iwill never make this again. Read reviews and used cheez its instead of ritz (that part was good!). Just not something that screams the need to be made again.

Very good. Really liked using Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs. I did not use any tomatoes and only used 1/2 sleeve of the crackers .served with mashed potatoes and brown gravy.

This is, by far, the best meatloaf on planet earth.  I double the ingredients, make two. and put one in the freezer.  Except for crushing the crackers there is nothing you need to chop.

Meatloaf smeatloaf double beatloaf I hate meatloaf!  Can you tell I just finished watching  A Christmas Story? I actually love meatloaf and I am giving this 5 Stars even though I felt it was a little Bland but that is personal preference. I used fresh chopped onion instead of the onion powder and the Ritz crackers that I used were the butter garlic flavor. I'm thinking once the flavors blend overnight this will make beautiful sandwiches tomorrow! Really like the Rotel concept next time I will get the hot instead of the original. And maybe sprinkle in a quarter packet  onion soup mix. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I followed the recipe,very easy.  I used rotel mild but that was still too spicy for me & ruined meatloaf for me.  I will make this again but without rotel, will use regular diced tomatoes

I was so excited to try this as I had some cans of ro-tel tomatoes and Ritz crackers. WE LOVE SPICY FOOD but this was way too spicy and dry even though I used half the crackers recommended. But I did use very lean beef. Next time I will try with mild ro-tel version and cook at 350 for 50 minutes and see if better. It is super easy though.

Used onion power for onion flakes. Otherwise stuck to recipe. Did add a topping at the start which I mixed 1 tablespoon each-ketchup, mustard and Open Pit BBQ sauce. in a cup and layer the top of meatloaf. Added sharp cheddar in the last 10 minutes of baking. This was so simple a 79 year old guy can even make it and it was super!

I've made many elaborate meatloaves that take 30 minutes or more to put together, and this one is equally as tasty and just takes a few minutes to toss all the ingredients together. The tomato/green chili really makes this tasty!

I did drain the tomato/green chili, and subbed 1/2 cup of plain dried breadcrumbs for the crackers. Added 1 Tbsp Worcestshire sauce. It did turn out a bit salty so next time will use half the seasoned salt.

Topped with our favorite glaze the last 10 minutes of cooking - 1/2 cup ketchup, 2 Tbsp light brown sugar, 1 tsp powdered dried mustard (also good with a couple tsp lemon juice).

I am so happy to have found this recipe.  I have been looking for the perfect  meatloaf, one that wouldn't fall apart  when sliced and I have finally found it, the only change I made was to use two eggs and use onion powder instead of flakes. Other than that i followed the recipe precisely and it turned out delicious. BTW this is my first time ever to rate a recipe.

Having 2 boxes of mostly broken Ritz crackers I looked for a recipe to use them.  My honey loves meatloaf and he never gets to have it unless he's out.  This is so simple with no chopping, no pre-cooking - just put  it together and into the oven.  He (88 yro) said it was THE BEST he's ever had.  I did add A-1 sauce trying to make me like it better.  I ate it and that says a lot.  I will make this again to see his delight. Thanks.

This turned out very good, I added an extra egg and drained the Rotel, Plus an extra 1/2 can. And no dried onions.. I did put ketchup on top for the last 10 minutes  of cooking... It was very moist and great flavor.

Fantastic for a meal that you can easily throw together. I prefer to cook it the night before ... Think it's tastier that way. I'm a busy single parent of three growing kids ... It's great just as the recipe is written. It's a staple in our house now .

Love love live this recipe. I omitted the canned tomatoes and added two eggs instead of one. I also added a tspn of A1 and worstershire (spv) in with the meat and crackers. On the top a spread a mix of mustard, ketchup, A1, BBQ sauce and chipotle tobascco. Which I cook on it the whole time. Its great simple and my kida gobble it up.

Made exactly as written, drained Rotel tomatoes.  Absolutely fabulous. Very different but classic.  Tastes like a new improved version of meatloaf.  I really think it's the Rotel tomatoes that make it.  We used the pampered chef brownie pan to make them mini and cooked for one hour as recipe states. Yummm!

Very good. I have made other meatloaf recipes before & none of them I would want to make again. They were all just ok. I have been making this recipe for several years now and it deserves a good review. The only change I make is adding a little ketchup to the meatloaf when mixing and I put some on top. Thanks for sharing!!! :)

Thank You for the easy recipe. But I also added Tonkatsu sauce (Japanese sauce) real onion, cheese and garlic croutons (crushed), fresh garlic, worcestershire sauce. For the topping I used ketchup, worcestershire sauce and light brown sugar. covered it all with sauce and then cooked.

AMAZING! This recipe is not only easy as can be but my picky eaters loved it and so did hubby! I followed the recipe exactly except I used FLAVORED crackers; rosemary and sage (that's all I had on hand) and it was INCREDIBLE! My kids loved crushing the crackers up! I also used egg beaters and I couldn't tell a difference. I couldn't find my large baking tin so I used 2 cupcake tins. The "individual servings" came out PERFECT. Freeze the leftovers!! The kids made meatball subs with ease out of 1 serving! I made cheddar mashed potatoes to go with! All I can say is, DOUBLE THE RECIPE because it will be gone! And be sure to use the RO TEL tomatoes!!

As is it falls apart.   Too mushy.  Add an extra 1/4 tube of crackers and another egg and you might end up with something worth serving.

I am a certified foodie and not actually too crazy about meatloaf, but my son and wife coming to dinner and requested meatloaf.  Decided to take a stroll through meatloaf recipes.  This was fantastic.  Only changes I made were fresh onion finely chopped, chopped canned tomatoes, (out of Rotel) and dash of paprika, oregano and basil. Baked it with halved Idaho potatoes and carrots.  Wow.  Just the very best.  It got rave reviews.  I'm all up for meatloaf now.  Thanks a million.  Foodie Carole Ann

One of the best meatloaves I've made using a recipe!! Will definitely make it this way again. Made 3 loaves and froze 2 raw and they were just as good cooked after being frozen. Loved the addition of Ritz, made a great taste difference.

I didn't have the seasoned salt but didn't miss it at all.

Very easy and good. Added regular diced tomatoes, bell peppers, and little worshire, also.

I cooked this for my family and it was amazing, the only thing that I changed was the type of crackers that I used, because I didn't have any butter crackers, I used Monet Crackers(vegetable crackers). I don't know if it's better than using butter crackers, but if it was better than how I made, I truly missed out.

The moistest tastiest EASIEST meatloaf EVER. I followed the recipe as written except I drained about half the water from the can of Rotel and used garlic salt instead of powder. I also added the ketchup right in the begining. No need to pull it out towards the end to add ketchup. My little family of 3 ate the whole thing and wanted more!

I made this recipe exactly how it was written, except that I did drain the rotel tomatoes and it was great! My family has hated every meatloaf recipe I have ever made and they loved this one. They actually want me to make this one again. They didn't even need to dunk it in anything. Yea!!!

I loved this meatloaf and my boyfriend did too!  I didn't have Ritz crackers, so I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs (between 1.5 and 2 cups). After reading previous reviews, I did decide to drain the Rotel and I'm glad I did because it turned out fantastic. I glazed the loaf about 15 minutes before it was done baking with a mixture of Worchestershire, ketchup, and brown sugar.  My BF doesn't spare me the truth when my cooking turns out less than yummy, so I know for sure that this was a good one!

This was great! I will probably drain the tomatoes like many other reviews suggested but it was a hit and super easy! Thank you!
