Simple yet perfect cheese sauce!  Tip to avoid 'gritty' sauce:  You have to go old school and shred cheese from a block.  Packaged shredded cheese is coated with flour to prevent shreds from sticking together, and this will make the sauce slightly gritty.

This is the cheese sauce I learned to make in Home Ec. class years ago.  Once you learn how to make the white sauce, you can add many things to it for home cooking.  Some things I've learned over the years: 1. you need to cook the flour and butter for a bit so the sauce doesn't have a raw flour taste 2. you have to keep the heat very low, or turn it off, when you add the shredded cheese or it will clump up and separate; once the cheese has been added, do not use high heat  3.you need to shred your cheese from a block of cheese, anything that is pre-shredded has added flour to keep the shredded cheese separate.  It will make your cheese sauce gritty.
I add different things to the basic sauce to give it different flavors - garlic when melting the butter, or Worcestershire sauce for more flavor, sometimes different mustards.  This is good on any vegetable or potato.  By changing the type of cheese, you get many different sauces.
Great recipe!  Thanks Samantha for sharing.

I used the recipe to make a Cheddar Potato Bake.  I tripled the recipe, boiled 5 lbs potato cut into bite size pieces until almost done. Drained the potato and stirred in enough cheese sauce and some left over bacon crumbled then poured into a buttered 9x13 pan. Baked for about 30 minutes, sprinkled some bread crumbs over top return to oven till browned.

Very easy and quick to make and even though I'm one of the lucky moms who's kids WILL eat their broccoli without a cheese sauce, I tend to not like it too much, so it helps me! LOL  I made this once with old cheddar and it was MUCH better than with medium, so if you're going to make it stick to old or extra old cheddar.  Thanks for this recipe!  I'm sure I'll use it often :)

Delicious! Was looking to make broccoli more appealing and came across this. I used corn starch for flour and organic half and half for milk. I also added some minced garlic and onion powder. I used shredded cheddar cheese and it worked out perfectly, no need to use block cheese as others have suggested. Sauce was smooth with no lumps. The key is the temperature through the steps of the recipe - not block cheese versus pre shredded in the bag. Make sure to turn temperature down when cheese is added and stir continuously. Good, basic recipe that everyone should know.

Absolutely delicious cheese sauce instead of shredded cheddar I used velveta cause I couldn't find my hand shredder.  Came out perfect and smooth.  I did change it from 2 cups milk to one cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk was heaven.  My honey and son put it even on their pork chops...lol -wakswpnthr41

Perfect! and delicious. Just what I was looking for to pour over broccoli for something different. I used a mix of Gouda and American (because that's what I had) and I'm sure you can use just about any cheese you like. Thanks webbsk for sharing.

I tried adding hot mustard, turmeric, and cumin, with SHARP cheddar. Yum. Forget the broccoli or cauliflower. Eat it straight out of the pan!  :-)

Very good cheese sauce. Very simple. I had to add about 1/2 c. more milk as it was very thick after adding the cheese. Tip to make cheddar cheese smooth when cooking it in a sauce is to sprinkle it with a little lemon juice and toss to distribute it before cooking the cheese. Make sure to just sprinkle it very lightly unless a lemony sauce is what you are after. Sauce comes out smooth every time!

I was a bit sceptical, but it turned out AWESOME!!! 
I used it for broccoli, I can see using this on other veggies, like asparagus etc... too! Very good!
If the sauce doesn't thicken, just keep stirring and be patient! It will thicken up and turn out great!

Great easy foolproof recipe, I added some English mustard to give it a little bit of a kick and cut down on the salt. This also works if you just put all the ingredients in and just whisk as it heats up before you add the cheese

Wonderful sauce!  I usually follow directions to the letter the first time I make a recipe and I did so with this one and it was wonderful.  Today I made it again to go with my Broccoli Cheese Crepes and added minced garlic to the butter while it was melting.  I also used extra sharp cheddar this time as one reviewer suggested and it is beyond good.  Now it's the only cheese sauce recipe I have in my cookbook as it has so many variations that you can do with it.  Blue cheese, Swiss cheese, so many!

I used bacon grease instead of butter, chunks of cheese because I'm too lazy to shred it. Poured it over baked potatoes that had bacon, carots, and brocoli mixed inside crispy skins.

It made a super creamy cheese sauce and it was easy too.  Unfortunately, I overcooked my broccoli but other than that I pour it over the broccoli and put a touch of breadcrumbs on it and baked it in the oven for 1/2 hour.  Delicious!

Made exactly as stated with skim milk. Next time will use corn starch instead of flour, had just a little flour taste, it is good though. This recipe makes more than is needed for 1 head cauliflower, IMO. Used leftovers on nachos the next night, just added a bit of salsa.

This is definately 'basic' - I'm 73 & learned this from mom!!!  I don't usually have lots of cheddar hanging about to use when I decide to make sauce, so I use a couple or three heaping tablespoons of Cheeze Whiz...... awesome!!! Works great, tastes great and makes it very smooth.  'Light' works too.

This is a perfect recipe for white sauce with cheese added for a delicious result. As I am reducing dairy intake, I use mostly almond or coconut milk with a few shakes of hot sauce or Worcestershire sauce for extra brightness, and a little finely chopped parsley to pour over fish or vegetables. It's all good!

I think the directions are off as butter and flour need to be "cooked" until light brown/tan not just mixed together until smooth also cheese should be freshly shredded otherwise sauce will be grainy.

Look no further! This is the only vegetable cheese sauce you'll ever need. Keep in mind, the quality of the cheese you use (I used Cabot) will effect the taste and texture of this recipe. I too learned this in home-ec, back in the 60's. It's one of those basic recipes you can change up by adding garlic salt, Worcestershire sauce, mustard or even a bit of Velveeta. Your recipe went into my hardcopy cookbook that I'll be handing down to my DIL. Thank you for posting Samantha.

wild rice is nice, too. more important - don't use processed cheese.. ever. 2 tablespoons butter, melted in pan.  add two tablespoons flour, whisk to create rue. slowly add one cup of milk. let thicken, be careful not to scald the milk. add a cup and a half of your choice of shredded cheese, melt and mix until smooth. end story.  :)   I am sure that there are recipes on here that would describe something similar for homemade cheese sauce.

Very easy and good.  We used kraft's shredded mild cheddar cheese.  Added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese as I had skim not whole milk.  My fussy 21 month loved it and ate it for days with her veggies!!  Making it again tonight.

Excellent! I needed a cheese sauce for my baked potatoes with broccoli and I added some chives, garlic powder and celery salt. The sauce turned out perfect. I did learn from a previous failed incident that you need to melt the cheese very slowly over low heat otherwise it will separate and you will have a gunky mess. This time came out just right!

Worked so great! Also didn't get super thick as it cooled like a lot of cornstarch based sauces do! Will use ever-after!

Perfect sauce! Texture and flavor were spot on. I have been looking for a good consistency and flavor recipe. I can't wait to try it with different cheeses. I halved it for the two of us and had just enough left over for the dog to have a little.

Perfect easy peasy recipe that is quite forgiving of harried mums whether you have time to measure, or maybe don't when you have a family that decides they want cheese sauce right when the rest of dinner is ready to be served :)

It was an ok sauce. Nothing all that special!!! A bit thick, so if I try this again I will definitely use more milk.

I used arrowroot flour in place of the flour. I also substituted half the milk for heavy cream. For some heat I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and smoked paprika and a drop of hot sauce. It was beyond delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I have been doing this for years. This is a basic cheese sauce recipe but lends itself to many variations depending on the type of cheese used and other ingredients added. This recipe says for broccoli and cauliflower but it can be used for many other things.

I wanted to cut back on the carbs so I used coconut flour for the flour and cream for the milk. I used a block, white cheddar with a strong flavor and cut it into small cubes. It whisked together perfectly. I will use this again! Thanks.

This has been my go to cheese sauce for years. Works for mac and cheese, poatoes, and anything you want cheese on. For people getting gritty results try mixing the flour and the milk together before adding the to fry pan..

Very good, classic cheese sauce. The ingredient proportions are spot on.  In fact, today I had to use whole wheat flour and it worked just fine, I couldn't even tell.  The key to a smooth sauce is to keep stirring.  Of course, there are all kinds of things you can choose to add; mustard, hot sauce or Worcestershire are good choices.  I served it over noodles, broccoli and a spicy turkey sausage.  Very happy with it.

This is perfect for broccoli, cauliflower, and baked potatoes too. I followed the recipe exactly, but I had to cook a little longer than 3 minutes for it to thicken. More like 5 or 6 minutes, but I waited to add the cheese until it thickened. It was quick and easy and deliciously cheesy! I used sharp cheddar and added pepper. Definitely will use again.

Simple and did the trick. I added a splash of Frank's Red Hot sauce just before it was done to kick the cheddar flavour up a bit.

I added a squirt of dijon mustard and a touch Frank's hot sauce. This doubles well. The kids especially loved it. NO leftovers.

I used this recipe as a starting point to make a simple mac and cheese. Only making a couple servings, so I cut it about in half. Added a dash of salt, pepper, garlic powder and cayenne pepper and used a really good aged white cheddar. Turned out perfect. Will definitely keep in my bag of tricks.

I had just thrown my broccoli in a pot and decided I wanted a cheese sauce.  I googled "cheese sauce," and this was the first thing I clicked.  It was perfect since I had all ingredients on hand.  I'd like to eat vegetables more regularly and there's no doubt this makes me want to do it!

Very nice cheese sauce. If you like extra creamy and don’t mind the extra fat instead of milk use whipping cream.

Gritty even with block cheese. Maybe needed to stir constantly at low heat when cheese is added.

It really was done in only 15 minutes, possibly less! Really hit the spot when I was craving cauliflower cheese for dinner. I used tex mex shredded cheese blend and added a couple shakes of dry mustard and a pinch of cayenne. Also made 2 servings instead of six (but ate it all myself poured over cauliflower). Recipe nails the proportion of butter/flour/cheese/milk. Thank you!

I didn’t think the popular comments about the “grittiness” that happens if you use store bought shredded cheese was that big of a deal. I loved it and made it exactly according to the recipe.

I started making a roux with 3T. butter and 3T. flour, so just adjusted this recipe to follow. Added 1/2 t. salt and just a little less than a 1/2 t. pepper. Fresh grated sharp cheddar without the anticaking agents melts great when sprinkled in and added gradually. Great recipe! Thanks!

Add gently sautéed, Finley minced garlic and a splash of Braggs Sprinkle or your own favourite herb blend. I may try taking my Bamix  hand blender to it just for a smoother finish. Pretty good for a quick and easy recipe.

2.11.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233481/cheese-sauce-for-broccoli-and-cauliflower/ ... Well, I used freshly grated sharp cheddar & wasn't wow'd.  'May just be the lack of seasoning like salt, pepper, cayenne, nutmeg; an easy-enough improvement to make.  'Not really cheesytasting.  'Blame to the cheese & the recipe.  On the other hand, I used it in a better/homemade/improved version of this ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/26286/quick-and-easy-chicken-spaghetti/ ... Manyyy adjustments to that recipe, but this sauce worked fine in it.  I'll up my rating one more star.  Three for flavor; four for a smooth cheese sauce that worked for dinner.

This was a super awesome (basic) cheese sauce.  I used it for a vegetable cheese soup where it called for jarred cheese sauce, so this was used instead. and it was perfect!!

I made this sauce with my 14 years old who hates to cook, but she truly enjoyed doing this she said it was super easy now she wants to make it again for nachos.   I doubled the recipe add her favorite cream cheese & feta for her favorites dish  Mac n cheese with ham.

Great my wife loved it. I usually add a little more cheese and another cup of milk. Once the wife has her I add a little Crystal Garlic hot sauce and it's even better. Will be making this for a long time.

Well... It did work but not really, me and my friend did this but we had to add 5 tablespoons of flour it didn't thicken in the sauce pan and we didn't have too add as much cheese as listed and we also had to put it in the microwave.
If you do do this and it doesn't thicken out it in the microwave for 1 minute or more.

This is a really good, basic cheese sauce. I added a little garlic salt and a little onion powder to give it a little more flavor. The key to this is to use a block of cheese and grate it because store-bought shredded cheese has cellulose powder in it  and does not melt well.  Also, have the heat low and gradually add the cheese in whole continuing to stir, otherwise it will get gritty.

Very basic & simple. Mistake I made was not reading the top review & using pre-shredded cheese. I feel like it would have come out less “grainy” had I shredded cheese from a block. But, it wasn’t as “sticky” as other versions I have tried- so the consistency held up pretty well & was not quick to solidify after sitting. The trick is to keep constantly stirring to avoid clumping! And you’ll definitely need to add some basic seasonings (salt, pepper, etc...) otherwise it will be pretty bland unless you are using a more strongly flavored cheese.

Awesome sauce, not gritty at all. I used this during Thanksgiving as an addition to the steamed veggies and it was a hit.

I substituted 1 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup milk for the milk with 2.5 cups shredded cheddar. Just the most awesome sauce ever!

Super simple to make. Had the ingredients on and and it’s tastes delightfully creamy. I didn’t add salt as cheese already has salt in it. Will be using this on nachos. Yum.

This is a wonderful, basic cheese sauce that is a great starting point for virtually any "creamy" dish. My only suggestions are to add a 1/4 tsp. of dry mustard (or a small squirt of prepared mustard) and at least 1/2 tsp. of white pepper. Both help to brighten the flavour.

The resulting sauce was nice & smooth. Since I like my sauce more cheesy than the final taste I added a half cup more shredded cheese and seasoned with "Slap Ya Mama" Cajun seasoning to give it a little spice, and the sauce complemented my broccoli & red onion dish just right.

Very quick and easy. Ensure that you make the sauce over very low heat. May have to take off the burner at times. You can play with the consistency by adding more cheese or milk. I used garbanzo flour and Gouda. I didn't add salt to the sauce but did season the broccoli.

Great, simple recipe. Followed the directions as is. I use this often for broccoli and the kids (everyone really) eat it right up! Thanks for this recipe! Followed the advice from the comments about grating the cheese by hand.

This is fantastic! I took the advice of some of the others that made it and added one clove of minced garlic and a tiny splash of Worcestershire sauce to the melted butter. Then I used a healthy 3/4 cup of extra sharp white cheddar taken off the block, a healthy 3/4 cup shredded Gouda, and 1 slice of American cheese - this is important. I read there is something in American cheese  that makes melting cheese extra creamy - I agree.  Keep the heat low when melting the butter and flour & cook it awhile to really get it mixed well, add the minced garlic & worcestershire sauce, then turn the burner off and stir in the cheese. I didnt add any black pepper because the sauce was too smooth and pretty to dirty up lol. Add salt if you want, but I didnt think it needed it.

be sure to grate your own cheese, still a little grainy though.  Maybe velveeta?

This is just "okay" sauce. Not particularly bad, but actually fairly bland and conspicuously lacking  cheesy flavor.  Not sure why, as it has quite a bit of cheddar in it. I'm definitely looking for something with more of a cheese flavor and less of a warm milk flavor.

The recipe I learned in home economics! For those who had issues, here are my recommendations:

1. If your sauce 'broke' or didn't come together properly, you probably didn't cook the flour and butter long enough. I cooked it twice as long. 
2. If you found it too thick, add more milk. I added 400ml. ( 1 7/8c) of milk instead of the 1.5 cups. 
3. I used the pre-shredded cheese and found it melted great. Simply ensure you turn the heat to medium-low once you've added it and cook it longer. 
4. For this who found it 'meh', I'd use stronger, better quality cheeses. I added 1tsp of Dijon mustard as that brings out the 'cheesiness,' and nutmeg which perks up white sauces. You can add herbs too: thyme would be lovely with this. 

It was super yummy and easy!

I followed the directions exactly how they were written and it turned out great! It will thicken as it sits so if you're making this with a meal, make this last. You want to serve it right away. I pour mine over broccoli and amazing. Thank you for sharing!

Made it only substituting butter with Earth Balance just because :) This sauce was so perfect I consumed half of it before serving. Definitely making this again! Yum. Thanks.

Perfect, delicious cheese sauce. I have made this many times and it always works out. I have also halved the recipe and that worked out fine.  Sometimes I had a bit of red pepper flakes or a pinch of cayenne for a kick. Thanks for posting a great recipe!

SO EASY and makes a great enhancement for veggies. I used 2% milk and the texture was smooth. I like a little extra black pepper to give it a kick. Highly recommend this recipe!

I've made this twice now, and had several complements.  So thank you. I add white pepper and some paprika for some more flavor, aside from the the black pepper.

This cheese sauce was exactly what I had in mind for the two heads of cauliflower I steamed. I made the recipe exactly as directed and doubled it  (discovered I didn't need to).  The sauce was creamy, flavorful, and bound to my veggies perfectly. I did find the finished product was very, very slightly grainy even though I shredded the portion of block cheddar, but I chalked that up to the store brand I bought. Will use again!

We all thought  this sauce was not cheesy enough. Made a lot but it did not get eaten and it went in the trash.  If I make it again I'll try adding more cheese.

Delicious! I tripled it & made it for church to go over broccoli to have on top of baked potatoes. At the last minute, I served it by itself & people gobbled it up! Many put it directly on the potato. I used half &  half for some of the milk, about half. I used mostly extra sharp cheddar, 1 cup aged Gouda &  1 cup  fresh grated Parmesan. Thank you!

I used Colby/jack, since I didn’t have cheddar.  Tastes good and turned out smooth.  I would use a whisk for the whole process, instead of switching to a wooden spoon.

I used it on Brussels sprouts.  Next time, I’m going to sauté some garlic in the butter before adding flour.

Really good. The hubs loved it on his broccoli.
Made this again and used it for a rice and broccoli casserole. It was great and no canned soup needed :)

This recipe is very similar to one my mom made when I was a girl...except she used processed cheese slices! If I'm feeling like an adult, I'll make this recipe as is. If I'm channeling my childhood, I use cheese slices in place of the cheddar ??

Pretty straight forward and really good. I had this w simple boiled broccoli and I loved it. I'll make this again and maybe experiment with different cheeses, and maybe add garlic too. But as is, in this recipe, it's really good.

This sauce is so simple and simply delicious! I did grate block cheese as another suggested. I also used 1/2C half & half and 1/2C milk.  It was not gritty at all. My kids who are broccoli challenged actually went back for seconds!! I am going to use this for so many things. It would be perfect for mac 'n cheese. And I make a grilled Jalapeno chicken and this would make the perfect Monterey Jack sauce drizzled over the top! Thank You for sharing

Quick and easy cheese sauce I've been making for years.  I love adding a little cayenne to spice it up when I'm making it for myself.  I had forgotten the milk/cheese ratio since it had been a while since making it.  Glad I can find it on AR!  :)

Very easy and good. Used processed smoked cheese and some cheddar. Made fresh dug potatoes covered with cauliflower, carrots and broccoli and poured the cheese sauce over was excellent. Next I will try using butter buds (liquid) instead of the butter and a 2% milk cheese. To slim it down some.

I made this because I wanted to add extra mixed veggies to the broccoli but I skipped the flour because I used the packaged cheese, which already contains flour. Great!

I tried making this sauce twice, and both times it came out with a weird gritty texture. The first time, I gave it the benefit of the doubt, and read the comments to see if there was an implied trick that I, as an inexperienced cook, might not know about. I saw the comments that said not to use pre-shredded cheese, so I tried it again. It came out exactly the same.

It's tolerable when it's first made, enough to avoid making it a total waste, but anything leftover is completely inedible. If I ever try a making my own cheese sauce again, I'll be leaving out the flour (seems pointless to include anyway).

Fast, easy and delicious! Make sure you shred your own cheese though to prevent the grainy texture when using pre-shredded cheese. Takes 1 min for the extra step but so worth the effort!

An excellent and simple recipe, I was glad to find it, although I tweaked it a tad for my recipe and household's tastes: 
I added 2cups of cheese (hand-grated pepper jack), about 1/4 cups of chicken stock (to thicken it) and to "brighten" the pepper in the cheese added about three "knocks" (taps on the spice bottle) of tarragon and beu monde. Creamy and flavorful, it clung to the noodles without it being too watery.

Wow!!!  Best homemade cheese sauce ever!  As other reviewers said, take the time to grate your own cheese.  I used medium cheddar and it was fabulous!  The sauce got a little thick so I loosened it with a splash of white cooking wine.  Served it for our Baked Potato Bar and even my cheese-hater loved it.

This was so easy! I am not a big fan of brocolli, but it is one of the few vegetables my husband eats. By adding this we are both happy and it takes hardly any extra effort to do so. I  will be making this again.

Tastes fine, but when I made it, it was very thick. I did everything to the T, maybe I just am not good at making things. Still tasted great on my broccoli though.

Doubled the recipe because we have a big family and added some Velveeta and 1/4 cup heavy cream to make a little richer sauce. Everybody raved about it. Will definitely make again. It was a big hit!

Followed recipe, but used cheese I had on hand - preshredded mexican blend. The sauce was very smooth, added S&P to taste. Used it for baked potatoes and broccoli. Next time will try a different cheese and maybe add some other spices to jazz it up a bit. Overall good basic cheese sauce recipe.

This is a great sauce that holds together well and is a snap to make.  Its a simple white sauce that you can do anything with.  I've made this one countless times as my husband loves it.  I put cayenne pepper in it one evening to dip fresh home made fries into.

Made it! Turned out wonderful! Delicious! Though I'll admit your preview image is rather unappetizing I read the recipe and it seemed promising.
It was, very good recipe. I suggest using real grated cheddar, especially old cheddar, as mine was almost as tasty and fondue cheese. Goes great over steamed veggies and I'm sure it has many other practical uses as far as sauces go.

Maybe try it again. It was kinda grainy I thought I followed the recipe. The family ate it up and gave it a 3 stars.

Easy and tasty with good texture. I'd suggest cooking the flour mixture for a minute before adding milk. Might add a little nutmeg to the bechamel next time.  Used packaged shredded cheese and no issue with "grittiness"

I followed other reviewers' suggestion, and used half milk and half coffee cream (18% m.f.) and it came out smooth and creamy. The recipe makes about 1-2/3 cup of sauce, which was more than enough for our Xmas Eve meal with six people. In fact, I probably could have halved the recipe. Delicious.

A great easy recipe, mine was a little thick so I thinned it with additional milk and it was perfect! I used a combination of real block cheese I shredded my self and about a cup of pre-shredded.

Great! My Mom prides her self on making killer white sauce. However she had no recipe. Well I have been on the search & I have finally found it!  This is a great recipe! You can add the cheese or not.  Heck, you can make this sauce into all kinds of stuff! I didn't have the recommend cheese so I used what I had,  sharp white cheddar 1/2 block. I just cut it up& melted in.  Well it must  have been good cause the hubby gobbled it up on his broccoli! This now in my favorites!

This sauce was spectacular! My entire family loved it and my sister-in-law apparently ate it plain when so no one was watching… So yeah, a big success!
I used a variety of different cheeses instead of just cheddar and I added milk until I liked the texture (not an exact amount).

My BF made this using all the ingredients but he didn't follow any of the directions.  We had to throw out the gooey clumpy mess. Make sure to follow the given step by step directions or you won't get that perfect creamy cheese sauce. I remade this myself and it tasted OK, a bit bland but the consistency was nice. Next time will add different cheeses to give it better flavor.

Simple and easy!  Like other people stated, don't use pre-shredded cheese...they add stuff to it.  I used extra sharp cheese.  My youngest still woudln't eat the broccoli but my oldest loved it and so did my hubby!  I'd add a little bit of garlic powder next time for some flavor.  Also..you don't need too much salt.  The cheese and butter has plenty.

This was perfect! First I browned some garlic with the butter. We put some over raw broccoli which was ok but it cooled the sauce down too much, I'm sure would be better on steamed. Also toasted up some whole grain French bread and topped it with the cheese sauce- soo yummy! Paired it with a pasta dish. Definitely doing this again!!

Just made this as described. It was ridiculously easy and ridiculously delicious. Do note that if you use unsalted butter, you will need to add extra salt at the end.

Next time I'm planning to add some dry mustard and/or white wine.

I used to make it this exact way all the time. Tonight I tried it a little bit different so it wouldn't be as THICK. I used 2 teaspoons of corn starch then mixed it as usual. Then after putting the milk in I mixed 1 tablespoon of flour with milk (a roux). It came out creamy and smooth. I even used 3 slices of cheap american cheese and it was still delicious. Oh and salt in pepper of coarse.

I made this for baked potatoes last night, and we loved it. Due to my mis-planning, it was ready 1/2 hour early, but it reheated nicely. I think the flavor depends on the quality of the cheese. For those who said it had no flavor, taste the cheese by itself first to see if it has flavor. We had a good quality white cheddar, and it was amazing.

I thought this was okay but really lacked in flavor. It for sure needs salt and maybe some fresh garlic or something... Kids said they did not really like it.

Great thick sauce for vegetables.  Needs a little zip so I'd add hot sauce next time.

I found I had to add a little extra milk at the end to get the consistency I wanted. I made it again with a touch less cheese, and I liked that a little better. Either way, it was yummy! I'd love to try it with gouda.

I substituted ripe avocado for the butter and cut the flour amount in half. I also used Monterey Jack cheese and made a broccoli Mac n chores with the sauce. My 3 year old loves it.

This sauce is delicious on its own, or with a big scoop of philly added with the cheese. I doubled the recipe, flavoured with garlic and pepper, then poured over steamed cauliflower and broccoli. Super yum!!

This was a good sauce, quick and easy to make but I should have used block cheese and grated it myself as it came out with a gritty taste because of the flour on the shredded bagged cheese. I will definitely be making this again. thank you.

I made this recipe tonight, but I only had 3/4 cup of the cheddar cheese that I needed. So I used 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese and a 1/2 cup shredded mozarella cheese. It was delicious!

I needed a quick cheese sauce for my taco salad using the shredded cheese I had on hand, and this recipe did exactly that. I added too much cheese at first making it very stringy, but added extra milk and it made the cheese sauce perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used this for broccoli at Thanksgiving this year and it was a huge hit! Had to substitute Velveeta for cheddar as I didn't have enough cheddar and it worked perfectly.

I used processed cheese and the sauce was the perfect thickness and cheesiness. I was looking for the cheese sauce that mom used to make when I was a kid and this is it! Thank you for posting.
