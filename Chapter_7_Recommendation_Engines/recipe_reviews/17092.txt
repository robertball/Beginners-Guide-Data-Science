FOR JECCA:  The missing ingredient is oyster sauce...took me awhile to figure it out, but after trial and error, I used abt 2 -3 tbs. and it did the trick.  Made great restaurant lo mein, with a thick brown sauce just like you get in Chinese take out.

This is an incredibly customizable recipe with a nice, solid flavor whatever you add. I can't honestly give it four stars because I changed it so much, but the sauce flavor was fantastic, reminiscent of the lo mein at one of my favorite local Asian restaurants (I don't know what the other reviewers are on about. Maybe they're all eating at bad restaurants!). Some lo meins that I've had at restaurants have a bland, onion-y flavor I really don't like, but this one was much more to my tastes. I didn't add mushrooms, because I hate them, and instead chose to add some chopped broccoli, carrots, snow peas and water chestnuts and also used pre-packaged stir fry noodles instead of linguini (that seemed an odd pasta choice to me.) I used half the sugar, no water, and halved the chicken broth and corn starch because I had a feeling it would be too saucy. The amount of ginger in the original recipe was actually good and did not have to be altered. What I ended up with was just about perfect. Some odd ingredients listed (don't use linguini!), but overall an excellent flavor.

Great recipe says my wife, who usually doesn't favor Oriental noodles dishes. A couple comments about balancing flavors.  All quantities in the recipe will be right if you use four 3-ounce packages of ramen noodles (any flavor okay because you will NOT use the flavoring packs, just the basic noodle blocks which only take three minutes to boiland separate).  Chicken quantity should be 1-1/2 pounds.  Suggest adding 1/2 small green pepper and 1/2 small red pepper in 3/4-inch dices along with other veggies to give flavor and slight crunchy texture to an otherwise soft dish.  Use fresh ginger, never dried.  Too bland?  Add a teaspoon (or to taste) of Chinese or Thai hot red chili sauce when cooking veggies.  Put chili sauce on the table for the more adventuruous.  Stick with the liquid quantities listed in the recipe.  Drain the cooked ramen noodles in a colander and then add to the wok; the sauce will be fully absorbed in the noodle mixture as it should be.  Don't worry about making too much, leftovers will microwave great.

Rather poor actually. 1/2 cup of soy sauce??? If you are using some thin supermarket brand I would halve the amount. If you have a real soy sauce purchased in an asian market use only a couple of tablespoons. 
There is also way too much liquid in this recipe. Lose the extra cup of water and decrease the broth by a quarter of a cup. 
This recipe also bears little resemblance to the lo mein you might get in a restaurant.

A 5 star recipe if you follow the recommendations of your fellow homecooks. I used spagetti instead of linguine and added a bag of stir fry veggies. It won't be "soupy" if you  add a bit more cornstarch and give it more time to thicken up (2 minutes is not going to cut it). My husband says is his favorite of all the oriental dishes I have prepared... I made it yesterday and he is still talking about it. I added some shrimp with the veggies and some red crushed pepper to make it spicy!

I enjoyed this recipe but I did change it around a bit.  I didn't use the water at all.  I thought 1 cup of water and 1-1/4 cups of broth would have made this way to soupy.  I stir-fried the chicken until most of the liquid was absorbed..this left it a golden brown color. I'm not a big fan of ginger, so I left that out and chopped up some broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage to use. I made the sauce (minus the water) and instead of using the full amount...I added a spoonful as I stir-fried my vegetables until I was pleased with the results.  Instead of mixing this all together, I left the noodles seperate and also made a pot of rice. We added the amount we wanted to either the rice or noodles.  This is nothing like the lo mein we get at our local chinese place, but this was still enjoyed nonetheless.  Thanks Michelle.

I had a craving for Chinese restaurant-style Lo Mein, and after reading the 12 or so different variations on here, this one is as good as any (the process is mostly the same for all). 
  I followed this recipe, but with these changes: I marinated the chicken overnight, used real Oriental Lo Mein noodles, and since I don't like mushrooms; I substituted other veggies- sliced onion, carrots, green peppers, water chestnuts, spring sprouts, and snow peas. (Hey) add what you like. Sure it was a combo of chicken & veggie Lo Mein , but wow, was it good. Used the base sauce here, and as others suggested- skipped the cup of water, and added a TBL of both Hoisin sauce & Oyster sauce (again- make it to your taste). All those Oriental flavors of sesame, ginger, garlic, Hoisin & Oyster sauce + the flavorful chicken & crisp veggies is like a party in your mouth. 

Don't be afraid to make a variation that suits you or your family's likes or dislikes.

This recipe was good, and I will probably make again, however there is something missing. I dont think it tastes quite like restuarant style. We have a chinese place in town and my husband love their lo mein, but it seems like whenever i try to make it there is a specific taste missing, and I dont know what it is!! If anyone else tries this recipe and knows what is missing please let me know! Is it hoisin sauce? Fish sauce...I have no idea!!

This wasn't anything great.  NOTHING like lo mein in chinese restaurants.  I love ginger, cut it in half according to suggestions and it was STILL too much.  Takes a little too long to make for the outcome.  I tried making it with a few changes (different veggies) and it still wasn't anything special.  Thanks for the recipie though...

I am a huge lo mein fan and researched several before trying your receipe.  This was also the only one that added sugar which unfortunatly for me, did not work well.  I did not add the second time I made it and was much happier without it.  ALSO, I am fortunate in being able to buy authentic lo mein noodles from an asian supermarket.  They make a huge difference in this receipe if you can get them, otherwise I would use angel hair or the thinnest you can find.  I added oyster sauce and in addition to the green onions, some very thin sliced white onions as well.  It was pretty good and you'll just need to tweek it to find your own personal tastes.  Thanks though!

Perfect. Better than restaurant quality. Only had regular mushrooms available. It worked out. Add chinese peas, 2 tble spoons of oyster sauce, can of water chestnut, guyanese chow mein noodles, add a bit teryaki madness, and a few drops of hot pepper sauce. Probably one of the hardest things I ever cooked. Next time try garnishing it with cilantro.

No matter how much you try to adjust it, it won't taste just like what you'd find at a Chinese restaurant.  The best you can do is to come close to the real thing.  Linguine noodles (Italian), ramen noodles (a Japanese noodle suggested by another reviewer) will only get you so far.  If you can find lo mein noodles in the refrigerated section of an Asian market, that is what you need.  The other thing that will get the taste closer to the real thing is adding oyster sauce. I use Lee Kum Kee Premium oyster sauce, as it has the best taste.  With all that said, this is not a bad recipe with some adjusting, and not bad considering it's easy to find these ingredients at your local grocery store.

This is very yummy but it is very salty. I think next time I won't marinate the chicken because there is enough salt in the sauce and enough sauce to give the chicken flavor. I also only used 1 cup chicken broth and no water. The sauce was perfect and thick. I also added snow peas, mushrooms and portabello mushrooms. Instead of regular noodles I used ramen noodles (as someone else suggested) and they were wonderful! I will definantly make this again! It is so yummy and I will definantly make this again!

Loved it. Made a few changes.  Left out the water, used 1/2 cup of chicken broth, used 1 tsp of ginger. I also dumped all the juices left after cooking the chicken.  I probably used 1 tbsp less of sugar...I was eye-balling it. I also added other veggies (red bell pepper, water chestnuts, broccoli, etc).  The taste of the sauce was fabulous though.

This recipe is delicious. Very subtle, but flavorful sauce. I loved the essence of ginger. I changed it a little though. I wanted to use up some leftover tenderloin that we had before it was no good anymore. I changed the broth to beef to compliment the change in meat. I used seasoned rice vinegar and I added bean sprouts and bok choy (cut very thin like matchsticks). I also omitted the water as others have recommended and I am so glad I did. The sauce coated the mixture perfectly and was so delicious. Lastly, I used this spaghetti noodles...just thought they seemed more "lo mein" like. Thanks!! Will definitely make again.

This turned out great. I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, added a little Chinese Five Spice powder, 2 heaping tablespoons of oyster sauce, and a fair amount of veggies (yellow bell pepper, broccoli, snow peas, and water chestnuts). I did not scale down the amount of liquid and it worked out well with all of the extra veggies.

I've never made lo mein chicken before but this recipe was pretty easy to follow and fun to make.  The fresh ingredients are a must and fresh ginger will make all the difference.  Delicious, better than take-out.  The boyfriend said "make this again tomorrow night!"  So it's a winner, thanks Meesh!

Excellent Flavor!! I used spaghetti instead of linguini because I wanted thinner noodles..it worked great for me. :)I used olive oil instead of sesame. (Didn't have any on hand). I also added some chopped zucchini just because I needed to use it up quickly. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly...the sauce was flavored beautifully and thickened up just fine for me. Thanks so much. This is a keeper for us. Delicious!

I was expecting a result more like the lo mein at Chinese Restaurants.  This was very good, but it was not the chinese restaurant lo mein that i was hoping for--mostly because it didn't have the "soy" color (the cornstarch changed the color), and the sauce didn't stick to the noodles.  But i would still probably make it again sometime because it was "different" and very good.

It's good, but it's absolutely nothing like the lo mein from Chinese restaurants. For starters, the noodles and up being much too soft. With a different type of noodle, this would be a better recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, then added a few of my own extras to it (baby corn, shredded carrots, peas, and oyster sauce), yet the end product... well, in a blind taste test, I'd probably say it's closer to Italian food than Chinese. (again, I blame the noodles for that).

The flavour of this was spot on. Exactly what I was looking for!  Did not serve with the noodles but used rice on the side instead. Also added a lot more veges to the sauce. Will use again. Thanks.

This was so good! I can't wait for leftovers for lunch tommorrow! My whole family liked this recipe. I used peanut oil to give a little more flavor and just had button white mushrooms. I decided a full 2 TBSP fresh ginger would be too much for our tastes, so I only added 1 TBSP. I added a LOT of veggies (carrot, celery, snow peas, brocolli, baby corn and water chestnuts) and wish I had added another TBSP of cornstarch:as it could have been a little thicker. It was very flavorful, not too strong for kids, a very pretty all-in-one-dish meal, AND (even though it said 4 servings)it made a lot!(more like 6 servings, for us). This is one I will make OFTEN. Sometimes with, and sometimes without meat. Thank you, for the delicious recipe!

Loved this recipe, but also changed it a lot.  I thought the amount of sauce was just right, but I also added a 1lb. bag of frozen stir fry vegetable mix (thawed and drained) and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Also used peanut oil instead of vegetable.  Would cut back the ginger next time to 1 1/2 tbsp.  Used 2 packages of Ramen noodles instead of linguini (minus seasoning packets) and it was the perfect amount of noodles.  Will definately make again.

I served this with Amber's Sesame Chicken also on this site and just as yummy.  I made a slight change because of this pairing.  Instead of 5 chicken breasts I used one chicken breast and added shrimp.  I also didn't have any shiitake mushrooms so I skipped that part.  Like others, I thought there might be too much liquid in the recipe but I left it as is anyway and am very glad I did.  The noodles and meat soak up some of that liquid and it keeps the noodles from drying out if you have leftovers the next day.  The leftovers, by the way, my husband and I both agree are wonderful the next day.  All the flavors seem to intensify and come together.  This was restaurant quality!

If you enjoy Lo Mein, you will enjoy this. Next time I make it, however, I will use a little less ginger. It was a bit overpowering. The leftovers tasted even better cold the next day.

I really liked the recipe.  I stir fried bok choy, snow peas, water chestnuts, and broccoli in addition to the mushrooms just to add to it.  I decreased the ginger to 1 tbsp, but it really could have used a little more.  I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe to customize. I also added some diced pork with the chicken. I added 2 Tbs oyster sauce, 1 small can water chestnuts, 1 small can bamboo shoots and 1 can bean sprouts. Used Lo Mein noodles. Did not need to add the water. Will make again.

My family loved this dish. It is a lot of work but I thought it was well worth the time and easier on the budget then ordering out. I did make a few changes after reading the reviews. I added 2 tble spoons of oyster sauce, used a bag of stir-fry veggies and no mushrooms(my son hates mushrooms), low carb spaghetti noodles, reduced the soy sauce by half, double the liquid ingredience and corn starch. Over all with the changes it was very tasty. I will make again and try it with the Lo Mein noodles.

Holy soy sauce! Thats all I tasted was the soy sauce. The only reason I gave it as many stars as I did was because if the soy sauce was halved I think it would have potential.

VERY salty.  I think the basic recipe is wonderful and tasted really good.  Just WAY too salty.  I'm thinking half the soy sauce (1/4 cup total) would be just fine.  I also halved the amount of sesame oil (because it is very strong and can be hot) and it tasted really good. Here are the changes I made: -I didn't have fresh garlic (used 1/2 tsp garlic powder) -Spaghetti noodles (about 5 servings dry) instead of linguine -Didn't have fresh ginger (used 1/4 tsp ground ginger) -3 tablespoons corn starch instead of 2 -1/2 tablespoon sesame oil (instead of 1) -Left out the mushrooms because we don't like them and the onions and used 2 carrots chopped thinly instead.  I thought the sauciness was just right (I hate it when things are dry).  I can't wait to try it again with half the soy sauce because I think it will be awesome.  Would be good with some bean sprouts in it and peas too if you like.

We thought this was really good. I made minimal changes because 1. it was what i had on hand. and 2. it was made for my 6 year old who wants nothing to do with mushrooms. I followed the directions except I had to use ginger from my cupboard because I read the ingredients incorrectly and did not purchase fresh, and added fresh broccoli and carrots vs green onions and mushrooms. We also had to use Fettucine noodles because I thought it was linguini lurking in my cupboard, but it wasnt :) My picky 6 year old had 2 bowls and my 2 year old ate her bowl as well and told me "momma, this is good" Thanks for sharing!

We all really enjoyed this.  I used 4 pkgs of Ramen noodles (without the seasoning packet) in place of the linguini.  I also added julienned carrots, finely chopped broccoli, celery and pea pods.  I added about 2 tbls. of oyster sauce to the chicken broth/water mixture (which I believe really helped the flavor of the sauce).  I will definatley be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. I was short on time and was using leftover chicken so I just mixed all the sauce ingredients together and added it all at once with the chicken. I think doing it this way is just fine if you don't have time to marinate the chicken. I also added some extra veggies. I loved the flavor of this dish!

The combination of sauce ingredients in this recipe are perfect.  It really does give it that Chinese Restaurant flavor.  I added more vegetables (water chestnuts, celery and bean sprouts) and used pork instead of chicken.  This sauce would go with any meat.  Excellent!

Although this recipe wasn't bad, it required so much time to make, that I found it a little bland.  If I make it again in the future, I will probably try and spice it up a bit...maybe add some more garlic and ginger and some extra veggies.

Yum!  I used less soy sauce (I don't like things too salty) and only marinated the chicken for about a half hour, but the flavor of the sauce with this recipe is terrific!  I used spaghetti instead of linguine and left out the mushrooms.  I added bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts.  I would add some more colorful veggies next time (it looked kind of bland) but the flavor was great!  Will definately make again

This was a good dish, but not like  restaurant lo mein. I added some carrots, broccoli and cabbage to it. We will be happy to finish the leftovers for lunch, but will keep looking for a recipe that taste more like what we get at the restaurant.

Excellent! Chicken is very moist and tender. The sauce mixture has a wonderful flavor. I did add 4 oz snow peas and 1 red bell pepper (julienned). My wife couldn't stop raving about this meal

The kids really like it, but I thought it was lacking really robust flavor. I didn't add mushroom due to requests... It was good, but nothing outstanding.

Made this with angel hair spaghetti, and button mushrooms, because that's what we had. Everything else was fresh, and we followed the recipe. Cured my husbands craving for Chinese, but he said definitely not restaurant quality. Will make again and try oyster sauce like others recommended, thanks for the recipe.

I used chow mein noodles and substituted bean sprouts and some sliced tofu for the mushrooms.  I did add the oyster sauce and added 2 full cups of chicken broth and no water.  The flavor and texture of the sauce was very good, but wow - it was WAY too salty!!  I could not even eat the chicken that was marinated in the soy sauce!  I will make this again, but I think I will have to half the soy sauce and only use one cup of chicken broth in attempt to cut down the salt.

My boyfriend recently found out he loves chicken lo mein after trying it last weekend. So I tried this recipe and he loves mine better.  I did a few alternates and don't measure much.  I didn't use rice wine vinegar, linguine, mushrooms, cornstarch, or sugar.  Instead i added in their place: hoisin sauce, ramen noodles, broccoli, cauliflower, mixed peppers, flour, and honey.  It was delicioso, muy muy delicioso!

I didn't really care for this dish. It had flavor, just not the one I was looking for. However, the vegetables were delicious! I really wanted it to taste just like lo mein from a Chinese buffet but not even close. :(

My husband said this seemed restaurant quality.  I think the flavors are reminiscent of Chinese take out, but thankfully less bland than most.   Followed some of the other reviews and used chicken thighs, added oyster sauce, bell pepper, and sauteed cabbage, used 1/4 the amount of water, substituted the sugar with honey, and used chow mien noodles instead of linguine.  Left out the garlic (not on purpose!) but I think it was fine without it.

i was pretty impressed with this.  only did a few things different per other suggestions.  added about 3 tbsp oyster sauce, let it simmer about 15 minutes to thicken, used hokkien noodles and added carrots and broccoli to the mushrooms and onions.  very yummy.  next time i might add some cashews and water chestnuts to give it a bit more crunch.

This was quite good!  We halved the ginger, because I thought it would be too strong, and I tossed in a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and extra green onions.  I think it would have been lacking without that.  We served over linguine and topped with crunchy chow mein noodles.  the only 2 things I would do would be to try adding oyster sauce (at the recommendation of other raters) and use low sodium soy sauce, because it was too salty. With these tweaks, I would definitely make this again sometime!

I made this two weekends ago.  Oh my its delicious.  I will get order this from Chinese take out again.  This was 10x's better then any restaraunt I have ever been to.  I did not use the sugar I replaced it with honey and used 3 to 4 teaspoons.  I used low sodium soy sauce.  No water I just used 2 cups chicken broth.  I also used all olive oil and regular white distilled vinegar.  I do not like ginger so I left it out and doubled the garlic.  I also added red & yellow pepper, broc. and carrots.  MMMMM So good thanks so much for sharing.  If you do not try this recipes you will be sorry.

I was disappointed in this.  I followed the suggestions of previous posters, less water, oyster sauce, halved the ginger.  But the ginger was still too powerful and did not much resemble take out.  My husband said it was okay, but not to add it to the rotation.

We liked this recipe ok, but it tasted nothing like the typical carry-out  Lo Mein you'd get from a restaurant, which is what I was hoping for. I will probably make this again though, because it was so quick.  Thanks for sharing!

Great basic recipe.  I used it to make mixed lo mein adding beef, shrimp, broccoli, snow peas, red pepper, and baby corn.  I stir fry the veggies altogether initially in step four and then add 1/2 cup of water, reduce heat to medium low and cover to steam the veggies for 3-4 minutes until broccoli is still bright green and broccoli and carrots are tender crisp. I also used 2 1/4 cup of homemade chicken broth rather than the 1 1/4 cup broth + 1 cup water.  This makes a very tasty mixed lo mein.  My family really enjoyed it.  I considered adding oyster sauce to it to complement the addition of the beef.  Might still try that next time.  I have recommended this recipe to friends and it has become a fast favourite.

One word sums up this recipe: SUPERB!!! One of the best recipes out there and definitely my favorite even though it does not have that restaurant flavor. Everyone that tried this licked their plate clean! The most noticeable aspect in this dish is the strong and pleasing ginger flavor.   I followed the recipe 100% but omitted the shitake since I didn't have any and added 1 tablespoon of fish sauce to give it a tad bit of extra flavor and 1 dry chili with the seeds for that extra kick. The next few times I've made this recipe I've added frozen vegetable mix and the taste remained just as good.   Just as a FYI:  The best and most flavorful Lo Mein I've had was at PF Changs since I've been very disappointed with most of the Lo Mein dishes at most other restaurants due to the bland and greasy taste as well as substandard ingredients. So far, this Lo Mein sauce is superb and only leaves a desire to replace the noodles similar to what PF Changs has in their Lo Mein; and then this recipe would be a run away hit. I only wish someone would post a PF Changs recipe for chicken Lo Mein out there with info on their noodles too.  Cheers and enjoy this great dish!

Hmmmm...maybe it does need oyster sauce, but I couldn't find it at our local grocery store, so even though it is highly recommended by reviewers, I left it out.  This is not my favorite recipe.  It is definitely missing something.  I don't think I'll make it again unless my husband comes home, loves it, and asks for it again.

i added 1 tbs oyster sauce to the marinade, and another to the sauce. i think some veggies would be great in this dish, and give it the nutritional punch that would make it a more complete meal. but other than that, i followed the recipe exactly - my six-year-old liked it, and my husband has labled it a keeper. he's horribly picky, so in book, this recipe is a winner!

This was yummy, but I made a few changes.  The grocery store didn't have shiitakes when I went so I used portobellos instead.  Also, I added some sliced red peppers that I needed to use up.  I used tagliatelle noodles instead of linguine.  I would have given this five stars, but since I made these substituitions, I'm not sure how it would be in its original state.  All the same, looking forward to making it again soon...I couldn't stop eating it!  Thanks!

It was okay, I didn't think it tasted much like Lo Mein from the restaurants.  I did use whole grain spaghetti and cube steak instead of chicken.  It had flavor but wasn't very flavorful at the same time.  Does that even make sense?  Not a bad meal, but now I have a lot of it that we probably won't finish.

I have made this recipe numerous times now, and I am so glad that I did so AFTER reading the other reviews. This is a wonderful recipe of the suggested modifications. Do not use water. This has a wonderful taste and texture without it. I cannot imagine how runny and icky it would be with it. Also, I have always used ground ginger and I only use a small pinch because we are not big on ginger. The oyster sauce is a must. If you don't use it, you will notice something is missing. I also like to add brocolli when and bamboo shoots just for fun. I love this recipe and make it about once a week, but had to rate it a 3 due to all of the modification made.

Good.  I made it without ginger or green onions (I didn't have either) and it definitely tasted like it was missing something. Next time I'll make it with all the ingredients called for.  Definitely give it a try!

This was delicious! I read about two pages of reviews and made alterations accordingly. I omitted the 1 cup water, only put in about 1/4 tsp sesame oil (because I don't care for it much), used spaghetti instead of linguine, and instead of peppers and mushrooms I used broccoli, snap peas, bean sprouts, and carrots. It turned out very well, but next time I will precook the sauce in a separate pan and possibly add more cornstarch(as it still didn't thicken very well), and add some more spices. All-in-all it was very very good and I will definitely make it again.

I used ICF chicken and let it marinate frozen in a ziploc bag for about 4 hours.  It was still partially frozen and super easy to slice.  Wasn't sure if I was to cook the chicken in the marinade, but since the recipe said "all juices" I decided that I would.  Used white mushrooms (cut in quarters) and ramen noodles.  I did add some oyster sauce as that was suggested by many other reviewers, but left everything else as per the recipe.  I can't see anyone not liking this stir-fry!

This was pretty good. I do agree with another reviewer that the addition of oyster sauce would add some more depth to the sauce. I also found that the noodles (I used spaghetti) will soak up that sauce as it sits and cools. The leftovers were less soupy and bore more of a resemblance to restaurant style than the freshly made dish. I did have to make a couple of adjustments. I used ground ginger, switched the noodle type and I used shrimp since I had some I wanted to get rid of. All in all this is a nice recipe, it is adaptable which is always nice and my very picky husband ate it without complaint...after I picked out the mushrooms from his serving.

This is so easy and turns out so well. It's also a good introduction to ingredients commonly found in Chinese cooking. I've added more water before to turn it into more of a soup. Either way you'll probably fall in love with it.  Thank you for sharing it!

STUPENDOUS!!!!  I added 2 tbsp oyster sauce per another review, used WAY more veggies (zucch, bok choy, carrots, onions - with the mushrooms & green onion, it was more than 4 cups uncooked veggies), and made it with Chinese egg noodles.  Lastly, I cooked the veggies longer than 30 seconds (closer to 5 minutes) since there were so many - I threw in the carrots and onions first for a couple minutes, followed by zucch, mush, and bok choy, then green onions, garlic and ginger.  A definite keeper!

This was really good. I also didn't use the cup of water.  Just a can of chicken broth and the other liquids.  I added some broccoli, celery and carrots because I had them on hand and needed to use them.  I'll make this again, absolutely. :)

My family LOVED this recipe! I omitted the mushrooms and onions due to picky eaters, but it was still packed full of flavor! I think next time I will try to make it with a thinner noodle, like maybe spaghetti or angel hair. I will definitely be making this again and it is a great alternative to Chinese take-out!

This recipe was easy and very flexible--I did make a few omissions for convenience. Left out the mushrooms, green onions, and the extra cup of water, and used spaghetti instead of linguine because it was what I had on hand. I subbed in ground ginger because I don't like it fresh. Even with my changes it was a great dish. My picky sister even loved this!

I used chinese stir fry noodles and white mushrooms instead of linguini and shiitake, but other than that, I made the recipe as written. It was quite flavourful... I really enjoyed it. The sauce thickened up nicely. I think I will add more veggies next time, though.

Great base recipe. I had a few problems but only due to changes I made. I added extra veggies - zucchini and red pepper - and I used button mushrooms instead of shiitake. It was very good, but the sauce never thickened up. The extra veggies produce a lot of water so next time I would leave out the cup of water called for in the recipe. I also used grated ginger rather than fresh and it was fine. Good recipe - will definitely make again. The whole family liked it!

What a great recipe!  Turned out perfect!

I adjusted a few things to personal preference (or what was available), such as - 

*Used flank steak instead of chicken (my friend is crazy about flank steak, but I really want to try it with chicken now also!).
*Used peanut oil rather than sesame oil.
*We used a thinner japanese noodle in the asian section (I think next time though I want an even thinner noodle).
*I omitted the mushrooms, didn't sound like my personal taste.
*I added a whole orange (for color) bell pepper and about an equal amount of white onion as well.  Also probably about a cup or so of shredded cabbage (will probably add more next time).
*Oh, I also added way more garlic than suggested (but I'm just a freak for garlic!).

I realized after that some thin carrot strips and some water chestnuts would have been a great addition, also.

I only made these adjustments because of personal tastes, and with the overall recipe intact, it was amazing!

Must try!

Great recipe! I omitted the water since there was plenty of liquid from the rest of the ingredients, and I added snow pea pods, carrots, and broccoli. Instead of linguini I used actual lo mein noodles from the Asian food section of my grocery store. My entire family enjoyed this dish.

I turned this recipe into shrimp lo mein by sub of chicken to shrimp I kept everything else close to the recipe with the exception of mushrooms, I omitted them and I added shredded cabbage, carrots  and  celery, I also used oyster sauce instead of sesame oil, taste more like the resturants when you use oyster sauce, sesame oil is great for fried rice dishes. This was really good. TIP*** I would suggest you up the veggies when making this recipe as written. Good recipe thanks Michelle!!!.

SOOOOO good!  I actually made fried rice to go along with it instead of the noodles, but the recipe was right on the money, and so good.  i wish there had been leftovers for me to eat the next day, but it was all gone!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The only changes I made were to use beef broth instead of chicken broth (it's what I had on hand) as well as adding a bag of the fresh stir fry veggies available in the produce section.  This included broccoli, pea pods, etc.  One last adjustment I made was to sprinkle the chicken with red pepper flake while it was cooking, to add a little bite. WOW!!  Was this delicious.  It made so much for the three of us that I had some to take to lunch the next day, with enough left-over to enjoy some during left-over night.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  I've tried to make lo mein before, but it was not this good.  I'll be using this recipe from now on.

This was good. I simmered it a little longer than the recipe stated to ensure that I got a nice, thick sauce - which was very comparable to restaurant quality and served it along with steamed white rice. I agree, it could use more veggies.

I added some peppers to this along with zucchini because I felt it was lacking on the veggie side. All in all it tasted really good, but the sauce was somewhat soupy so I will use more cornstarch next time.

i had high hopes for this recipe, but it was just barely ok. i used real lo mein noodles, as i was going for an authentic chinese restaurant flavor. sorry to say, this recipe didn't come close. the flavor was just very off, perhaps too much sugar? it was also way too soupy. i doubt i'll try this again, but if i did, i would cut way down on the sugar and the liquids.

This recipe was good - but nothing special.  I have made better stir-fries, so I probably won't use this recipe again.  I added red bell peppers and zucchini, which definitely helped.  I followed the rest of the instructions just about perfectly.  It did make a satisfying dinner.

I would agree it's not like I have had in a restaraunt.  Maybe there should be less sauce. To cut the expense, I used dried shitake mushrooms (16 mushrooms soaked in warm water for 30 min)and 3 packages of ramen noodles. I also used 1 tbl of bottled minced ginger with garlic, it could have used more of this. Tasted really good.

I'm sorry to write a negative review but I was expecting this to be better than it was. I think it would have helped had I used asian style noodles rather than linguine. I thought this would compare to restaurant lo mein and it didn't. (Although my kids really liked it.) I agree with the reviewer who said there was too much ginger.

Very good. Tasty. Definitely will make it again. My boyfriend also enjoyed it and suggested we add carrots next time and maybe peanuts (I guess Thai-style is what he is thinking). I couldn't find actual lo-mein noodles in my store so I used linguine and it was fine. Fairly simple to make. I never know what to do with my boneless, skinless chicken breasts so this was good for a change! Try it!

This was a great recipe! It was the best tasting chinese dish I have ever made.  I used ginger flavored soy sauce instead of real ginger.  I also used lo mein noodles instead of linguine.  Ramen noodles would probably work well too!

This is very good recipe, that you can change up with whatever you have on hand. I made the following changes because it's what I had.  I used leftover shredded pork, so used beef broth. I also added oyster sauce and hoisin sauce, about a tablespoon each, omitted the water and omitted the sugar. The sauce was great.  As for veggies, I used fresh asparagus, fresh green beans, water chestnuts, carrots, celery, thin sliced sweet onion, green onion along with lots of fresh ginger and minced garlic.  I also used ramen noodles, but will also try it with other noodles.  My husband loved it and asked why I hadn't made it before now and requested I make it again soon.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

good but kinda the same old thing. i really see no difference between this recipe and many others with the sauce containing vinegar, sugar, and soy sauce. i added coriander and beef broth to change up the flavor.

Have always been fond of this dish in restaurants and couldn't replicate it on my own- but this recipe solved that problem. Used shrimps instead of chicken, and 2Tb. oyster sauce in the marinade to compliment it. Never knew how essential rice vinegar was to give proper flavor. The marinade combined with the cornstarch mixture made a great sauce and I'm grateful this recipe called for linguine because I recently moved to a region with seriously limitted Asain groceries, and lo mein is nowhere to be found. Of all possible alternative noodles, linguine makes the most sense as an easily available alternative. Altogether, my kids were impressed that I could make "Chinese restaurant food" and we will happily make this again and again.

Very nice.  Like all recipes you can boost it where you like it..I am such a sucker for garlic....anyway.  Just an alternative suggestion for consideration on the pasta.  Mueller's now makes what they call and label "Pot Size"  spaghetti and thin spaghetti for those of you who like to be a bit closer to 'authentic.'  Right now my neighborhood Publix market has an Asian hot bar near the deli section and they use linquine.  I don't know how many times I've told them to take my suggestion but they just giggle and mutter "Corporate."  LOL

I don't use all the salt this recipe calls for, and add extra ginger to suit my family's taste.

I gave myself a big pat on the back after making this. Love the flavor of this dish, the sauce was perfect. I did add a bag of frozen stir fry veggies to the dish and I will make this again.

This was just ok for me. I made it exactly but substituted snow pea pods for the shitake mushrooms. What I really didn't care for was the linguine. Maybe an Asian noodle? It was much better the next day.
Would try again with a different noodle.

Very good. My wife always orders Lo Mein when we get take out and is hard to please when it comes to her Lo Mein. She loved this when I made it for her and requested I make it again and often. I did leave out the additional water and for a dollar I got 6 packages of Ramen Noodles and used them all minus the seasoning packs.

It's pretty good but very time consuming.  The chicken marinade worked wonderfully.  The recipe was easy to follow and the sauce came out well (and it helped to have it prepped from early on.)  I added some broccoli and egg to it because I wanted to clean out my fridge.  I would recommend making the recipe and would make it again myself.

Good basic recipe. HOWEVER, unless you have an industrial grade stove and wok you will never be able to obtain the incredible heat achieved in Chinese restaurants.  The underlying flavor that will always be missing in homemade Chinese food is an essential smokiness. At the risk of being called a heretic, my trick is to give the wok a scant wipe with liquid smoke. And I mean scant! The difference is amazing and usually leaves people envious of the taste of my stir fry dishes including lo mein. And dont chintz on the toasted sesame oil!

Pretty good, has a good flavor. Thought it needed a little extra sugar, and possibly a little salt. Also added a couple extra tbs of soy sauce.

I actually made an account to talk about how salty this recipe is. I though "Oh man this has so many good reviews." And I followed this recipe to a T and cannot tell you how salty this was due to ALL the soy sauce it called for. I gave it two stars because you're able to work around a bit to make it tasty to your liking, but I doubt I'll try this again.

Good base recipe.  Needs a little more "oomph".  Next time, I will add more vegetables and maybe a splash of fish or oyster sauce.

The best fried noodle in the world!! I marinated chicken for 24 hours. 
I don't like vineger so I didn't use it. Still very very delicious!!
I grated ginger and garlic. That's better for me.

Thank you Ms. Meesh.

As it sounds like other reviewers also think, this is a good starting place for chicken lo mein, but it is not quite there yet.... I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, with the exception of reducing the soy sauce, per reviewers suggestions, and I added a tablespoon of hoisin sauce. My gripes with this are that the sauce is far too runny - perhaps cutting the liquid in half but keeping the same proportions of flavor bases would do the trick. Also, I love ginger, but the flavor of the ginger in this was too overpowering - none of the other flavors could get through. I used Chinese egg noodles, but would recommend angel hair over linguine.

This recipe was super easy to make and had a lot of flavor to it. The only differences I made when making it was because I don't like mushrooms, I replaced it with a few cups of broccoli and a cup of baby corn. I will probably use a little more baby corn next time too because it gave it a good crunch and soaked up the juices really well adding flavor. I added the broccoli and corn to the chicken and stir fried all of that together and it was AMAZING.

Instead of of chicken I used left over sirloin, I also opted to use thin whole wheat spahgetti.  I sliced 1 yellow and 1 red bell pepper in a 1 tsp olive oil.  Meanwhile I made the sauce separately by adding 1/2 c low sodium soy sauce, 3 tbls oyster sauce, 1 tbls crushed garlic, 1/2 inch of grated fresh ginger root, 3 tsp sugar, cracked black pepper, 1 squirt of Sirrachi (optional for heat).  Once the pepper are al dente I added in the sliced beef, 1 head of sliced Napa cabbage, 1 hand full of bean sprouts, re-hydrated shitaki mushrooms sliced (can be used instead of meat) , 1 whole grated carrot, 4 green onions.  When all veggies are cooked down I added the whole wheat pasta and tossed with the sauce.  Can be topped with toasted sesame seeds, I didn't have sesame oil so I am not sure how much of an impact it would have. This is a large portion but is ok as we will  be enjoying this tomorrow.

Made this last night and it was great!  It makes a ton.  Next  time I'll only use 3 chicken breasts.  4 is too many.  I also used some of the others suggestions. I cut the total sugar in half, used 2 cups of chicken broth and no water, low sodium soy sauce, plus I used lo-mein noodles instead of linguini.  I used less shitaki mushrooms, but next time I'll use button.  Shitaki are kind of slimy.  I also used baby corn and thinly sliced pea pods which worked out great.  I also used 2 tsp of oyster sauce.

This was pretty easy to do.  I accidentally read 1/2 lb of mushrooms for 1/2 cup, but it still worked.  Fortunately, I bought more than 1/2 cup.  I used the lo mein noodles vs pasta, and I used bs chicken thighs.  One mistake I made was to let this sit for a while after it was done.  It still tasted great.  Eat this right away if you use lo mein noodles.

This was very good and not too time consuming.  The only thing I changed was to use fresh lo mein noodles from the local Asian market.  Once you add the sauce mixture, it may seem watery, but give it a chance...it will thicken. I was impatient and added more corn starch which led to it being really really thick.  The amount of corn starch in the recipe is just right.

To begin with, I left out the green onions and the mushrooms, because I don't like them. I also used Lo Mein noodles I found at Whole Foods instead of the noodles the recipe called for. Finally, I added 2 Tbsp. Oyster Sauce. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was pretty salty, and just didn't have the same flavor I get from take-out. I'm guessing that there's no recipe I could find that would be the same, though, since their woks are seasoned so well. I won't make this again.

Wow...I made this last night and I added in the Oyster Sauce as other reviewers had mentioned.  I also used Oriental Noodles which really take on the flavor of the sauce...don't use spaghetti you'll miss out!! This was BETTER than take out that we've had and my 18 year old son absolutely loved it more than any he's ever had!  Awesome recipe with a bit of tweaking otherwise wonderful flavors the meld together to make one wonderful dish.  I also made the crab ragoon recipe on here.

This is definitely a recipe to tinker with. I used the 2 Tbsp of oyster sauce as recommended. Instead of linguine, I used flour Lo Mein noodles from the Asian market. Once the meat and veggies were prepared, I put the uncooked noodles on top and stirred around, adding bits of water until the noodles were tender. Seemed pretty salty, I would recommend a low sodium soy sauce. Overall not bad, not my favorite Asian dish in general, but may appeal to true Lo Mein lovers!

Overall a good recipe but we felt the sauce was lacking a little something. I added a bunch of veggies and still had a lot of sauce leftover. Will make again but maybe add red pepper flakes.

This doesn't taste like lo mein.  It reminds me of pad thai because of the ginger.  Recommend using less ginger unless a thai flavor is what you want.

Yum, we've made it twice now, once following the recipe time and have had great results!  We even screwed it up by using "rice sticks" noodles instead of linguine which were difficult to get sauteed/fried.  Dumping everything together in an attempt to soften them with a LOT of stirring worked well.  Supper was a success!  Next time we'll try adding carrots and snow peas.  Yum!  Thanks Meesh!

I read through the reviews and cut sugar (by 3 teaspoons), water and added 2 tablespoons of Oyster sauce.  I marinated chicken overnight.   Added asparagus, chopped carrots & broccoli.  Recipe still needed help, it was fine but needed more flavor (salt, pepper and sriracha helped).

This was okay. Almost good, but not great for the amount of effort. I liked the taste of the marinated chicken vs. chicken just thrown in there. I would try again with different noodles and maybe adding the oyster sauce if it's not too spendy!

Wow awesome! My mom used to own a chinese restaurant and it tasted very simular. I didn't have linguini noodles so i used regular spaghetti noodles. It definitely needed oyster sauce (appr 2 tsp-add in w/liquid ingredients) and maybe a little more soy sauce for taste. I used leftover BBQ chicken so that eliminated a step. I added ginger to the liquid part of ingredients and dumped it all in when all the veggies were cooked and noodles were added. This took me about 45 minutes start to finish. Great recipe-thanks! Don't forget the oyster sauce!

Thumbs up from both boys 9 and 19!

This recipe was pretty okay. It was a lot of work, but did not taste authentic enough in the end. It was way too saucy and too sweet. I will try again, but will use less water and less sugar. It was nearly like a thick Asian soup.

Had to make do with what we had: I only used one (giant, ha) chicken breast, used regular spaghetti noodles, and baby bella mushrooms instead of shiitake. Still delicious! My husband, who thought he hated lo mein, ended up eating most of the leftovers. (This is one of those meals that is even better the second day.)

This was OK, but definitely not like our favorite restaurant lo mein. I'm not sure what's missing - not a bad dish, just not what we expected from all the rave reviews.

I have no choice but to rate this recipe five stars - it's really great and really easy. I didnt change whats in it only how i made it.  I used rotesari chicken for easiness but still made the sauce with all the measurments listed cuz I like a lot of sauce =). This is a BIG family favorite and have given this recipe out numerous times upon request.

We made this recipe with beef and beef bouillon.  We added no sugar to the marinade for the meat and only half of the sugar for the sauce.  The only thing we added to the original recipe was a little bit of thai chili sauce...definitely a keeper and regular use recipe!!!

Extra: I added a tablespoon of (Asian) garlic chili sauce (warning it's HOT!!!), I used 2 tablespoons of soy sauce for the meat and 2 for the sauce, I omitted the minced garlic. I omitted the noodles (just ate it with rice) and I used 4 tablespoons of all purpose flour. I used white wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar. I omitted the water because I heard that it was too much liquid. Everything was divine! I loved the taste, I had to substitute so much because I didn't have the other ingredients or what not. But I will definitely be making this again! Thanks so much!

The flavor was great especially if you up the fresh grated ginger.   The whole box of linugine was way too much; I woulds say 1/2 box is sufficient.  Also add additional veggies; I chopped fresh red pepper and one carrot to give additional veggies and color.

I've made this a few times, adding the oyster sauce as other people suggested..and it comes out AMAZING every time.I don't always add mushrooms..usually I pre-cook broccoli, and add that instead.
2/11 -- Still making this occasionally. It's really good. I still add the oyster sauce (3 tbsps) and usually do onion, mushroom and broccoli as the vegetable. Everyone loves it. Thanks!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. We used spaghetti instead of linguine but other than that I thought it was a solid "starter" recipe. Great flavor.

I made this dish without the chicken, but added some snap peas, white onions, red and green peppers and broccoli. Used angel hair pasta too, because that was all I had on hand. Added a little more soy sauce too, but this is a fantastic recipe. And I will be sure to make it again!

My husband and I love this recipe!!  Next time I am going to use true Lo Mein noodles because the linguine was just weird to us both.  The flavor is excellent!  I used the marinade to made fried rice and it was great that way also!!

This was a wonderful and easy recipe to make. I have made this more than once and each time used different veggies. I like to use frozen-whatever I have in the freezer and reduce the amount of liquids. I also like to add chunks of white onion as this is our preference. Thanks!

This was good, but I'd like it spicier so I think next time I'll add some hot pepper flakes.  It would be good with just about any kind of meat or veggies added, too.

We made this for "Chinese night" last night along with Kung Pao chicken and Miracle soup form this site.  This was pretty good, I can't decide which flavor was overpowering but I think it was the ginger.  Next time I will cut way back on that.  I used cornstarch to thicken, canned mushrooms and added bamboo shoots. Next time I will also add a half package of oriental frozen stir fry veggies.  Thanks for a good base recipe, I will continue to tweak to our taste.

great for company!  suggestions are don't use any water, just use a 1 lb box of the linguine or chinese noodles, use less ginger (maybe 1/2 the amt).  you can substitute frozen stir fry vegetables if you want and add chili flakes if you want more spicy!

This recipe was good.  It is a little light on the vegetables, so I would recommend adding either some snowpeas or peppers.  Also, I had to add more cornstarch to thicken the sauce up to how I like it.

This recipe is tasty but not very authentic.  It is too soupy.  I didn't use mushrooms and cut back on the ginger.  I substitute lingunie noodles with Chinese noodles.  I also use Shanghai bok choy and bbq pork.

The taste of this dish was not really what I considered Lo Mein to be, but it was still pretty good.  I did make a few changes.  First, since I was going to use this as a side dish, I halfed the recipe and omitted the chicken.  I also left out the mushrooms simply because I forgot to purchase some.  Since I didn't use the chicken, I should have only made 1/4 of the sauce for the noodles.  I was not thinking properly and went ahead and made up half of the sauce to toss the noodles in which was way to much.  Once I realised my mistake, I ended up just cooking the noodles in the sauce mixture instead of cooking them in water then tossing with the sauce.  I do have to wonder though if even 1/4 of the sauce would still be to much for just noodles.  Overall, this was pretty good and I think I would make it again as a main dish with the chicken but, if we are craving lo mein, this is not the recipe that I will use.

Wow, this is a really great recipe! The seasoning amounts seemed just right; the only change I made was to add 50% more linguine.  My wife and I had dinner, leftovers, and still more for the freezer. Thanks Michelle!! --Rick

This recipe was great! We left out the mushrooms and substituted shrimp for the chicken. My husband's favorite chinese dish is lo mein and he has been looking for a recipe for the longest. We were both very pleased with this one although next time we will add less ginger and a little more cornstarch. Overall, a real winner!!

It's really, really good!  I mean REALLY good.  The sauce is very authentic and the mushrooms are so tender and juicy.  You can eat a BIG bowl of it and not feel too full.  I love this recipe!

It's edible but its not the lo mein you get in a Chinese restaurant.  A more apt title would be Soy Sauce chicken with noodles. The soy is overpowering  to the point you can barely taste the ginger or other seasonings.  I was not surprised however as I wanted to give this a try and didn't expect much.  I wasn't disappointed.  If you want an authentic recipe please go to the standard classic Chinese cookbooks that were published in the eighties and nineties before everything got dumbed down to the point of irrelevance. ANY of those will bear no resemblance to this recipe.

No complaints, I thought it tasted very good!  The only changes was to use low sodium soy sauce and added some grated carrots.

I didn't make any changes for the first time. Should I make it again I might make minor changes so that my gluten, grain, and dairy intolerant sister can eat it as well. Excellent recipe and very delicious

I’ll probably ably make it again. Something was missing though. I think next time I’ll use white pepper instead of black. All of the Chinese recipes I see use white pepper. I always make the recipe as is the first go around.

Good stuff!! I add about a Tbsp of Hot chili sauce. it's most excellent in Chinese food. Also roll my chicken in cornstarch and flour, makes it extra crispy. Thanks for sharing.

I really like this recipe. My kids are really picky when it come to Lo Mein and they love this. I don’t add mushrooms because I’m the only one who likes them so it’s just easier not to add them instead I add broccoli. I also use stir fry rice noodles (kids just like them better).

This was pretty good. A little on the sweet side which I liked. If you have 16oz of pasta I'd say you could use it all and still have enough sauce to coat it all.

This was really good, and even better the next day. The only change I would make is reducing the black pepper from 1/2 tsp to 1/4 because I found it a bit peppery for my taste. I didn’t marinate the chicken for a full hour since I got home late and the family was getting really hungry. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipeep!

Honestly, I didn't love the flavor. I added a ton of different veggies, as you can with just about any stir-fry dish, but the sauce wasn't particularly flavorful. I didn't read through the reviews and tips, but something needs to boost this up in my opinion.

I will make this again.  Good flavor.  If you don't have everything you can substitute like I did: No rice vinegar = diluted white vinegar; no fresh ginger = ground ginger;  no green onion = regular onion' no Shitake mushrooms = regular mushrooms.    The sauce doesn't thicken up, so use less water and maybe more corn starch.  I would actually give it 4-1/2 if I could.

It was very good and the family all enjoyed it. The only thing was the sodium. I will use half as much/or less soy sauce next time. Also, I didn't have green onions so I used some snow peas. All in all it had wonderful flavor. Thank you!

The overal flavour was very good!  I will make this again however I will reduce the liquid amount or double the cornstarch.  Hold off on the green onion (scallions) until the very end.

Really delicious.  I made my own egg noodles from scratch and can't imagine if being the same with linguine.  I also added the oyster sauce as per recommendation.

My 11 yr old is obsessed with Lo Mein chinese food. I tried this recipe and we were pleasantly surprised. This is a lot different than I normally cook and the Sesame oil has a very distict flavor. I would maybe use less next time. Overall really good recipe!

The sauce was a bit on the watery side, so the recipe did not quite match the one I had in mind. Although the recipe was a delicious blend of flavors, it doesn't seem quite right to have to cook the noodles in the sauce.

I made whole wheat linguine noodles from scratch and pan-fried them before starting the recipe, which definitely added something. For some reason they were extra sweet, but no sugar was added to them, just egg-oil-water.

Four stars because I took "liberties" with the recipe.  I chose not to marinate the chicken after reading reviews commenting on too much saltiness  That worked out fine.  The sauce is delicious.  It didn't need the water, and also I added more veggies (carrots, radish greens, red bell pepper).  What a pretty dish.  I'll make this again.

5-18-2016  ~The bones of this recipe are solid.  Prepare it confidently as is, or fine tune it or embellish it to suit your own tastes.  For me, playing around with both the sauce ingredients as well as getting a little more creative with add-ins to the meat/vegetable mix is what made it a personalized, made to order lo mein.  I don’t like ginger – omitted it.  Where the recipe calls for water, I simply used more chicken broth.  Water has no flavor; chicken broth does.  And to lend a little complexity and flavor to the sauce, I added about 2 T. of oyster sauce.  To make this more nutritious as well as more colorful I added sweet red bell pepper, broccoli and red onion.  All I can say is… I really, really enjoyed this - delicately flavored but flavored adequately, interesting sauce, and nicely flavored chicken from the marinade.  A side of some egg rolls from the frozen food section rounded out the meal.  For me, my tweaks made this a 5-star recipe.   As if I needed one, this is just another reason to eat more pasta.

I made this one evening for dinner.  I did include oyster sauce as someone else suggested.  This was to die for and tasted better than restaurant Lo Mein.  Will be making it again.  My husband asked me to put this in rotation.

Amazing dish. I don't know what all these people complaining about it not tasting authentic was this tasted spot on to me. I was a little questionable about using linguine noodles however as it seemed really strange for an asian dish but I used it anyway and all I can say is I would not substitute for any other kind of noodle it was spectacular. The dish did come out liquidy though but after adding about 4 tablespoons of extra cornstarch at the end and adding a few more mins to the cook time it was perfect.

This was so so so so good! I had to stop eating to write my review so I wouldn't forget what I did (pregnancy brain). I didn't have linguini or fresh ginger root, so I used egg noodles and 1tsp of ground ginger. I also added some extra veggies I had laying around: red onion, green and orange bell pepper and about a cup and a half of frozen broccoli florets.

I liked the flavor of the sauce which had a strong ginger flavor. I added a frozen stir fry veggie mix to the chicken instead of mushrooms and it was delicious! I also halved the amount of sugar as suggested by other all recipe members. My sauce was a little thin, but I used flour instead of cornstarch as the thickener so that could be why.

This is a great recipe.  Watching the video really made it easy.  This is the closest thing to Oriental and I made it myself!  I did add a dash of oyster sauce and some extra veggies.  Other than that I followed the recipe as is.  My husband liked it which really made me feel good because he is a professional chef!

I tried to make this exactly as printed, but couldn't bring myself to add the 1 cup of water, so waited until I saw how much brown sauce was in my wok towards the end. I really don't think it's necessary. So I mixed the noodles into the vegetables and chicken and it was perfect. I don't understand why the recipe calls for more water.  I gave it only 3 stars because it wasn't great, just okay. I will try other lo mein dishes on allrecipes and see if I can come up with a great one.

I love this recipe!  I make it with Pork Tenderloin, chicken and sometimes even Shrimp!  I always make the meat ahead of time.  Usually I marinate the Pork overnight in a Teriyaki sauce/marinade and we slow cook them on the grill, basting regularly up above heat on the top rack.  We generally eat one then and save one for this recipe which is why I always cook one slightly pinker (almost medium rare) so when I use it in this recipe and stir-fry, it doesn't over cook!  Anyhow, I double the sauce part of this recipe, we love it and the noodles tend to soak it up!  Which is why I keep sauce separate from the noodles until time to eat!  And I did add ground Ginger to the veggies/sauce for extra pungent flavor!  And like some of the other viewers, I didn't always use the water (if I had enough chicken broth I used that instead). Last, I always use whatever is in the cupboard:  water chestnuts (a must), bamboo shoots, cashews, and snap peas....all work well!  They are staples in my cupboards and freezer!  Hope this helped!!  We are having this tonight...I lost my overly messy, discolored and penned up copy so I had to get on here to print another and thought I'd write this review! Enjoy! And thank you Meesh!! Chow!

Yum! Very good as is -substituted shrimp for the chicken. Next time we'll try adding oyster sauce as suggested by others, plus some shredded carrots to increase veggies.

I love this!  I did change a number of things, less soy sauce, added snow peas and chopped carrots.  Substituted canned mushrooms for shiitake, again, didn't have them on hand. Didn't have any sesame oil, but will get some next time to try it.  I think I love just about anything with rice wine vinegar and ginger.

My teenage son cooked this for us and it is awesome! We only added a couple tablespoons of oyster sauce as per others recommendations, other than that cooked it verbatum. I've never eaten this but it is a keeper for sure, thanks!

The flavor was good. But something was missing? I feel like my sauce thickened too much? I may have cooked it on to high of heat? or added to much flour (we didn’t have cornstarch) I would like to try this again. Any tips?

I was expecting this recipe to taste like the Lo Mein you would get from a Chinese take out, but it's no where near it.  Next time I will add oyster sauce like one of the review recommended and white pepper (key ingredient to the Lo Mein I'm familiar with) to create that restaurant flavor.

This was very tasty but has many ingredients and is time consuming. Instead of regular pasta, I used a few packages of Ramen noodles (without the seasoning packet) and it was very tasty and had that Lo Mein taste similar to take-out .

It was pretty Simple to make and tasted good. I didn't like that it had a lot of extra liquid I tried to cook it down but it was almost like soup. I also switched the mushrooms to Zucchini, I also added Flat Peapods, since my kids don't like mushrooms. But My Boys were happy and they liked it.

I followed this recipe as is. It tasted very good. The only thing I would change is to add less ginger (1 Tbls)  The ginger was a little strong.
This recipe is a keeper!!

The rice wine vinegar and sugar took over the taste of this lo mein dish.  I used 3/4 water instead of 1 cup.  I substituted 2 Tbsp. oyster sauce for 1/4 cup of the soy sauce.  Next time, I would do it without the sugar and rice wine.  This dish has potential, but reminded me more of a chow mein dish.

I would have to agree & with another reviewer & say that it was rather poor. I've never had chicken lo mein that was saucy but decided to give this recipe a try because of the great reviews. Nobody in my family really enjoyed the dish. I would say the marinade for the chicken was great, but that's about it. I made some more lo mein the next day, but a dryer version (my own recipe), & everyone enjoyed it so much more.

This is a good start for lo mein but it doesn't quite raise the bar on the dish.  I made a few adjustments for my family's Meatless Monday meal.  
** I recommend adding steamed broccoli, cauliflower, shredded cabbage, snow peas, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, onions, red/green peppers and onions to give this dish more pizazz.
** Waaaay too much sauce.  Like others suggest cut back on the soy, water and some of the broth. 
**  Add a tbs of oyster sauce to give that true Asian flavor.

Its a good dish but it needs tweeking. By the second go round you will have a masterful lo mein!

I fixed it once according to the recipe and it was very good. I read reviews and decided to fix it again with the addition of 2 tbls oyster sauce. That did the trick!  Tasted just like take out lo mein.

Tweaking is necessary.  I'm going to try the oyster sauce suggested by the "Most Helpful Positive Review" if I ever make it again.  I loathe mushrooms so I made this with cabbage (actually coleslaw mix in a bag since I didn't want to fool around with cutting cabbage), matchstick carrots, snow peas, and bamboo shoots.  Other than the vegetable mix no changes were made though I'm tempted to add a splash more vinegar or something to perk it up a bit.  Oyster sauce or vinegar may do it.  It's an okay sub for when I don't feel like going to my fave Chinese place, but reality, it's cheaper and easier to drive to pick up my fave take out.  Why mess with what the professionals have perfected?

I just tried this tonight, and I really liked it. The ginger was a bit overpowering for me, so I might reduce the amount I use next time. 

My fiance loved it even more. He wolfed down two and a half bowls before I could finish one!

Like most others, I made some changes to simplify the recipe.  I did use ramen noodles and would recommend that others do the same.  In addition, I used boneless, skinless chicken thigh meat and just added a little chicken bouillon to the cooked chicken juice as opposed to adding broth or water.  I mixed a little cornstarch with with just a bit of water and the sauce thickened quickly and nicely.  I threw in a can of rinsed bean sprouts (Polar brand is far superior to LaChoy in my opinion) and I used 1 frozen ginger cube and 1 frozen garlic cube in addition to the Mirin and soy sauce which I just threw in to taste.  Left out the mushrooms--personal preference, but used a lot of green onion--would have added matchstick carrots if I'd had them on hand.  Everyone in my large family loved the flavor--tasted like local Chinese restaurant lo mein to us. Added some sri ra cha on mine and WOW!  We will definitely be making this again.  Thank you!!

We just bought our first wok and decided to try this as our first recipe. We are new to cooking and were a little apprehensive. The recipe is SUPER easy to follow and it turned out awesome!! We did not add mushrooms because we couldn't find the right ones but it still turned out very good! Serving size was a little off. We used three chicken breasts and a pound of linguine (one whole package) which fed two adults and a teenage boy.... and was about one serving left over.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I changed it a little because the flavor was fantastic! It did not taste artificial or over-flavored. I was on the fence with the choice of linguine but it came out delicious. 
**My changes were: I used 1 Tablespoon Ginger, 1/8 tsp granulated garlic (instead of minced), omitted the water (too much liquid), Did not use mushrooms and used sliced bok choy, shredded carrots, snow peas, sliced celery with the green onions instead. 
*** Also the recipe calls for a lot of chicken, so if I used 2 breasts sliced super thin and cut them about an inch long.

I slightly modified the recipe, adding some veggies, about a tablespoon of hoisin sauce, and another table spoon of spicy brown bean sauce. All three of my boys devoured it!!  It's not often we get three out of three in my house!

The key to the great flavor in this dish is to use high quality fresh ingredients.  If you use powdered ginger, cheap soy sauce and pre-minced garlic it just won't have the great taste it should.  The only change I made was to used 1/3 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/2 because I was using a very high quality soy sauce.   I made this for my family and it was greatly enjoyed by everyone including my 8 year old daughter and husband.  I have added this to my recipe box and will be making it again.

Whenever I need a simple recipe for a new dish I want to make, I come to Allrecipes or Food. This time, I used both. 

I wanted to use chicken broth, but I knew it would take me too long to reduce the mixture, so I used Chicken bouillon instead and made the mix quite a bit thicker. I used about 7 lbs of sugar snap peas, 6 cans of stir-fry vegetables (Kroger brand), 40 lbs of pre-cooked/sliced white checken, and about 1/3 of a cup of MSG. I also added Oyster sauce. As I understand it, Oyster sauce adds that special je ne sais quoi to a Chinese dish of this nature. 

It took me 4 hours (a little longer than I expected- but not by much) to make the 120 servings I needed, but when I was finished I was extremely pleased and so was my entire church. 

(By the way, I cooked this alone, with no help whatsoever, by choice. So, it can be done!)

Made this for the first time tonight, and LOVED it!  My kids LOVED it too.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and cabbage/carrots instead of mushrooms/onions, because that's what I had on hand.  But, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the sauce was excellent and, unlike some of the other reviews, I especially liked the ginger flavor. This is a definite keeper.  Thanks so much for the FANTASTIC recipe.

This recipe is good with the exception of ginger root as an ingredient. Not what I expected. The ginger root was over powering, I'd suggest just leaving it out all together.

This was good, not great. Nothing beats good LoMein at your favorite Chinese restaurant. It took too much time, work and effort for the result you get. I did alter the recipe a bit so that could also have affected the turnout.

More veggies needed! Also, add the oyster sauce and leave out the water. It was ok, nothing spectacular. Take out is better, but doesn't it usually go that way?

My family loved this recipe. There's only 3 of us and the recipe made quite a lot of food yet it was all polished off. I did add in oyster sauce and it was delish. As for using ramen noodles...that didn't fly so well and I got requests to simply switch to linguine. Next time I'll just stop by the Chinese take-out and get  an order of plain noodles to use. Try this. You'll definitely like it.

Yummy recipe! I thought this tasted great. I did add oyster sauce like other reviewers stated and it did add some extra flavor. Also I omitted the water as well.

SUPERB!!! My family just loved this and so did my neighbors who came by to visit and ended up helping us consume this until the serving platter was bare!!! I followed this recipe exactly, except I substituted pork for the chicken and it came out wonderfully. Thanks.

What a great recipe!!  I listened to other reviews and omitted the water, turned out great.  Next time I will add more veggies (if I add more stuff, I'll probably add 1/2 of the water that's called for).  I also only used 1/2 of the ginger, which was perfect.  Went to the Asian isle in the grocery store and used Chow Mein Stir Fry noodles instead of linguine.  Linguine sounded a little weird to make with this recipe.  Try it, you can't go wrong!!

This was delicious. I used 2 cups of chicken broth and 1/4 cup water, but next time I will reduce the liquids as I had to add more corn starch to get it to thicken. I also added sugar snap pea pods and left out the mushrooms only because I do not like them. It was a hit with the family and I will definitely make it again!!!

Soooo good, to me it was better then take out!  I added in some sliced water chestnuts and fresh bean sprouts!  I used authentic chinese lo mein noodles too!  Nice way to feel like your eating take out, but get to have the fun making it at home.

Tastes just like the lo mein from the Chinese place down the street.  No more takeout for me!  Based on other reviews, I added 1-2 tbsp of oyster sauce and an assortment of veggies (basically whatever was in the fridge).  Absolutely delicious!

This is definitely not restaurant quality lo mein (at least, not of the qualty served at my favorite chinese restaurant), but it is an okay homemade substitute. The use of linguine was kind of distracting... it seems like maybe a thicker noodle than I'm used to in lo mein? I used a little oyster sauce, as recommended by another reviewer, used a little less ginger, and left out the mushrooms. I don't know how some reviewers could be ending up with too much liquid (unless the addition of vegetables is the explanation.) My liquid thickened up perfectly, just like the instructions said it would. It was not soupy in the least. Maybe some reviewers aren't using the full amount of cornstarch or don't have it fully mixed in/dissolved? Overall, this wasn't bad, but it did take a lot of work (and dirtied a lot of dishes.) If you don't already have these ingredients on hand, it'll probably end up costing more than it would to just get it for takeout at your favorite chinese restaurant.

I made beef lo mein, by subsituting the chicken with boneless steak sirloin, and the chicken broth with beef broth.  though the steak turned out great, my sauce turned out really thin.  i'm not sure why.  it was like eating ramen with delicious pieces of steak in it.

I tried to follow the recipe exactly. It wasn't that favorful. The recipe was ok but not great. It needed something. But it wasn't good enough to keep working on it to make to great. I will instead keep looking for a Lo Mein recipe that is up to snuff.

My entire family loved this dish, especially my 1 year old son. I added white onions, squash, and a snow peas veggie mix. After reading the other reviews I only added 1/2 cup of water and a bit more cornstarch and the sauce thickened just fine within 2 minutes. Instead of linguine, I used whole wheat thin spagetti and a mixed grain spagetti. I also added some shrimp with a little less chicken. The marinade was great, I'm going to try it next time I do a stir-fry.

My husband, 4 kids and I really liked this recipe! The chicken was tender and very flavorful and the noodles had just enough sauce. The leftovers are good. A few alterations... I did not add the ginger (didn't have it), and I used canned mushrooms which I chopped finely so my kids wouldn't know they were in there, I also finely chopped a white onion instead of using the green.  And just before serving I sprinkled the top with garlic salt and black pepper to taste. Very good.  It isnt a quick recipe, but worth the effort.  I served this with Fried Rice I, and some egg rolls to make a complete asian style meal.  Yum!

My family loves this! We like veggies a lot so I add a little celery, a few carrots, extra mushrooms and sometimes some snow peas for crunch to this. Not really Lo Mien but it works for my family!

I didn't marinate the chicken as i had some left over from another meal but I pretty much kept the rest as is with exception of mushroom, I used cremini and button and used some baby corn too. I also had yakasobi noodles from Costco so I only had to heat them in the mixture.  We really enjoyed this for dinner, we don't have this as a main course too often so it's fun for a change of pace.

I felt that the noodles were a little lacking in flavor.  However my guests wanted the recipe and my fiance thought they were great. The only other problem with this recipe is that it is pretty labor intensive.  There are a lot of steps so it is not something that can be made quickly.

Tried this recipe last night and it was fantastic! The sause was great! I used whole wheat spaghetti instead of the linguini, so it would have a little more fiber.

Excellent!  I also used ramen noodles and though quite salty, it turned out really good.  My boyfriend enjoyed it and he's really picky about chinese food.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great flavor, but a little too much sauce for me. I would scale down the amount of sauce for this recipe.

Very good! I made it with red wine vinegar as it turned out I didn't have any rice vinegar, and it came out fine. A little sweeter than I was anticpating but it worked in a pinch. My 2-year old loved it too! This is definitely a keeper!
