Great recipe and super easy, I had everything in my cupboards!  The recipe calls for way too much salt (come on... 5 TABLESPOONS?!  You're kidding right?) so I added about 3 tsp and that was perfect.  Next time, I will use 1 Tablespoon of pepper instead of 2; there was too much pepper flavor.  I used the Crock Pot to cook this.  Cooking on High for about 4 hours should work.  Just make sure to check water level constantly, as it dries up much faster than on the stove.  I think I ended up using 10 cups of water total, and it was deliscious!

UPDATE: Made again with 5 teaspoons salt instead (could still almost use a bit less)- turned out great. Again, just used the food processor and added water until I got the consistency I wanted. Makes quite a lot so I separated into containers and froze some. Was excellent for adding to a quesadilla - lots of versatility and were delicious. With the change to these modifications I now give it 5 stars. This has potential to be a great recipe but TELL me the salt content was a typo? I followed the recipe exactly trusting that 5TBsp salt would somehow mellow out in the beans. It did not. They were WAY too salty and we could not eat them. However, the overall flavor (minus the salt) was great! I did find though that a potato masher was not great for getting them to a creamy consistency, I put them through my food processor and added more water until they were the consistency I was looking for. Next time will try with 5 teaspoons of salt maybe?

These are absolutely declicious - after soaking the beans overnight, which I'd done before finding this recipe, I let mine cook all day in the crockpot and came home to the MOST delicious smell!! They're terrific and I'll bet they'd be good on tortillas, too! Love them thanks so much.

Not only was this super easer, but really good.  I probably only used about 2 tsp of salt for the whole pot.  I didn't even bother mashing them, just served them as is.

I made these the other day - I wanted something simple and tasty without the overnight soaking.  This recipe really delivered!  I halved the recipe to only 8 servings, which is plenty for us.  I made only a couple of changes - I used only 3t of salt (and it was plenty!) yellow onion as that is what I had and I used vegetable broth as the initial broth because I did not want an overwhelming 'chicken' flavor.  As I added needed liquid - I used half water and half chicken stock, which worked out well.  I would give this recipe 5 stars easily, if it did not call for 5T of salt.  That is far too much in my opinion - next time I make it, I will even reduce my 3t to 2t as the broth adds some salt.  Once the beans were ready, I mashed about 2/3 of the beans with a potato masher, added some shredded Colby Jack, a bit of milk and some hot sauce - served as "refried" without all the extra work and they tasted fantastic!

I used the recipe to cook beans to make refried beans. I mainly just followed the measurements. About half way through cooking I had to add about 4 more cups of water because they were getting too dry though they were in my dutch oven. After that I kept cooking them til reduced and they were soft and creamy like restaurant-style refried beans. I used about half the amount of garlic (but next time I'll go ahead and use the full amount) and a whole yellow onion because it was all I had. Instead of adding mozzarella cheese I used 1/3 round "brick" of quesadilla cheese. I sauteed the onion in a tablespoon of bacon grease and 2 teaspoons of cumin, 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika and 1/2 teaspoon of marjoram and 1/2 teaspoon of thyme. I used about 2 teaspoons of salt at the beginning and added another teaspoon at the end and for us, that was plenty salty. 

I'll definitely make this again. I had about 10-12 cups of cooked, refried beans and very little work. You just have to check on it to make sure the beans aren't getting too dry or sticking/scorching. 

(I read in a review that you should only add hot water/broth to beans after they've started and I did that and my beans were very creamy and smooth)

1 TBSP Salt is adequate.  I also add 1/2 lb of bacon.  The best beans ever!!!  Also I have never gotten to the "add cheese and pico part" just fine without as well. @ TBSP Pepper since they removed that from the recipe.

I tasted these beans after mashing and decided they were already so delicious, why add the mozzarella & pico de gallo?  I halved the recipe, added a chicken bouillon cube, just added salt to taste, and mashed coursely with a potato masher.  They still had lots of texutre, but were thick & creamy.  Delicious!

Cooking on the Stove Top, I'd start with more liquid - I found I had to add liquid about three times during cooking.  I also threw in a slice of Salt Pork (everything's better with Pork) to help give that pork fat flavor that you would get from frying the cooked beans in lard, like traditional refrito frijoles.  It added a very nice flavor - cut way back on the salt, as the salt pork brings salt to the dish anyway.  These Beans turned out perfect for homemade nachos - just spoon beans over tortilla chips, with some chopped up grilled fajita meat, spread on the shredded cheese - cheddar or a mexican cheese mix, heat in 400 deg. oven until cheese is melted, serve with plenty of pickled jalapeno slices, sour creme & salsa.

Great recipe! My only change was to throw a few slices of uncooked bacon in to cook with the beans. Don't leave out the red pepper, it really adds to it.

This was so good and so simple- it totally made my day.  I had already started boiling my 2 lb package of pinto beans when I got onto the site to look up recipes.  Looked for chili recipes, but found this one.  I'm so glad I did!
I didn't have red pepper flakes, enough mozzarella cheese or any pico de gallo.  Used yellow onion instead of red; Mrs Dash Extra Spicy instead of red pepper flakes; substituted quality pepper jack cheese for mozzarella and added 1/4 c. medium salsa (which probably added nothing- I just didn't want it to get too thin by adding more).  I had the chicken broth and garlic on hand and after the cooking time, I used my food processor - this made the best refried beans I have ever eaten in my life. I put 5 two cup containers full in the freezer and have about 4 cups in the frig for the family.  I used it for bean burritos last night- really great! This recipe is a keeper!

These are a nice change from my regular pinto bean recipe.  Very good!  I can't figure out why you would want to mash them, though.

This is a very good, easy-to-make bean recipe and leftovers freeze well too. I like that it's not necessary to pre-soak the beans. I made my mother's beans for years but they called for salt pork and these beans are tasty (and healthier) without the pork.  I agree with other reviewers that 5 T salt is WAY TOO MUCH! I generally only use 1-2 t, depending whether I add the cheese and or pico de gallo or salsa, as both those ingredients contain salt.  I never both to mash them as I think they look better served whole and don't resemble those nasty canned refried beans.

Nice recipe, but the nutrition of the beans is lost when you do not sprout them first. Take the time to sprout the beans - soak overnight and then keep moist in a colander for a day or two in a warm place. Once you see the beans start tos [rout, then you can cook. The nutrition is then released and absorbable.  Adding a little baking soda to the cooking liquid speeds the cooking and makes them softer.

Delicious! I used veggie broth and green chiles in place of the chicken broth and pico.  I added a little cheese to each bowl and stirred it in instead of adding it to the whole pot.  These beans remind me of my favorites from a little Mexican restaurant in CA.  I haven't been able to find any recipe that's even close, until I found this one!

I think the recipe has changed since I made it because it called for so much salt; I had to throw the whole pot away! The second time around I only used a pinch, plus pepper and chili flakes and it turned out great! Great recipe and good for a budget and health conscious family! Makes a lot! And fresh!

Ok so I had made a pumpkin soup a few days ago that had lots of leftovers.  So I used that as a base for this.  I poured in probably 1-2c pumpkin puree and 7 c water with only 2 packets of condensed chicken broth.  Kept adding water as needed.  Came out EXCELLENT!  Also carmelized the onions and garlic before adding to the pot.  My kids can't stand to know they're eating them so this helps them blend in.  Very good and very healthy.  I intend on playing with this one a LOT!

I've been making these over and over since my husband loves them and is on a diet. They need much more water added but I make them in the slow cooker. I tried a bowl of them tonight and they were delicious and full of flavor. (Even without the cheese)

Very easy to do. Instead of pico de gallo with with some salsa and a can of rotell. I went with about two pinches of salt would recommend more. Will take much longer then 4 hrs to cook. I set a timer for a hour and stirred, checked water level, and repeat. At 6 hrs I smashed and ate but could of went longer. A dollop of sour cream is a nice finish. Taking left overs and making mexican pizza this evening. Would make again in the future.

These are so yummy and so easy.  I have passed this on to many friends who also love it.  And you can mash the beans like she says or you can leave them whole and store them and use in place of canned beans (less BPA in your life:)). We love them and make a batch every week!

Left them whole (didn't mash) ---- and definitely didn't use THAT much salt.....as a matter of fact, if you use the chicken broth, that is plenty of salt there. I used some beef broth I had saved from cooking a pot roast in the crockpot the day before. Soaked overnight, and left in crockpot to cook all day on LOW.

Tried these today. Best pinto bean recipe so far and the family loved them too! I followed the recipe exactly, used 2 teaspoons of salt and added a 1/2 cup of water toward the end of cooking to keep them from drying out but I think they would have been fine without the added water. Excellent recipe!

I modified this leaving out the cheese and pico and substituting in celery, more garlic, 2 sorento peppers, oregeno, rosemary and mint. The last 3 were fresh from my garden. All simmered for a few hours. Was very tasty and quite spicy.
I suspect they are numerous variations that would be tasty. I froze half for future side dishes.

Woohoo!  I am notorious for messing beans up and these actually worked! Thanks Runnergirl!

PS. I did boil them for a minute and let them soak for an hour and half, drained them, then followed directions...oh ya, and used 1/2 the amount of chili

This is a great recipe but beware - it makes a LOT of beans!  I used about 1 t salt and 1 t Tony Chachere's More Spice seasoning along with the 1 T red pepper flakes, still needed more salt in the end.  I added another 3 C water during cooking process, think it might be good to just start out w/ more water.

since I have made this dish, the recipe has changed (spices and salt have been reduced).  Maybe this is worth trying again??  As it was listed before, it was inedible.

Amazing! We only made a few minor changes: we used vegetable stock (due to a grocery store error), and didn't mash the beans completely. So very good! Just the right amount of spice to add as a taco side dish, or enchilada teaser. Easy to prepare, and the only real cost is time waiting to simmer, but they require minimal watching. We set the time for every hour, added water twice, and they came out great. Wonderful, delicious recipe recommended to anyone who wants fresh beans.

Very good. Of course, I used much less salt: 2 tbs. But that was even too much. Next time I will use just 1 tbs. It was also a little spicy for my kids, so I will use less red pepper next time. We just ate the beans straight from the slow cooker sprinkled with a little cheddar. Made a yummy, cheap dinner, and I will freeze the rest of the beans for another night.

I love this recipe.  I did however cut back on the salt and red pepper flakes.  I use 2 Tablespoons salt and 1 T red pepper flakes.  This works best for my family.  I did also add the mozzarella cheese.  To me this make the recipe.

One should NEVER add salt to beans before/while they are cooking. Otherwise, you get results like '6 hours' to soften them. I'm surprised they ever got soft when salt is added while the beans are cooking.  Also, I used sweet texas onions instead of red ones. Instead of bacon, I also used the hambone from the hickory smoked ham we had this past weekend for our Easter dinner. Also, I used cilandro garnish instead of pico. All that said, it's a nice simple recipe, I like it!

Completely as described.  Creamy, and with the taste of refried beans, but healthily done.  Super simple.  I didn't have condensed chicken broth so just used 8 cups of regular chicken broth instead of the condensed broth and water.  It took just over 2 hours to cook instead of the 3 1/2 suggested, and be sure to stir every 15-20 minutes to make sure that all of the beans are getting cooked through properly.  Easy, healthy, yummy!

Excellent!  I cooked them in the crock pot on high for about 4.5 hours.  Delicious! Was so delicious I didn't use the pico or cheese.  Hubby also loved them and I'll definitely be making these again.

This came out great. A HUUGE hit with the family. Things I've learned.. Weigh the bag before you assume its 2 lbs.. I must have ended up with 10 lbs of cooked beans. Soak the beans overnight, they won't absorb as much water during cooking.. For my family this was perfect for the beef/bean burritos we made but would never eat it as a main or side dish. For us, it's to make with burritos. Or as a dip but a lot of trouble for some bean dip.

Very good!  I followed the cooking directions exactly except I used a yellow onion and did not add the pico or cheese.  I'll make this again and probably adjust the seasoning more to my tastes.  Thanks!

These are really delicious and quite simple to make.  I love serving them with any sort of Mexican dish or using them as a replacement for meat in my tacos.  I sometimes add cooked bacon to change the flavor.

These beans are soooo good!  I put them in the crockpot in the morning and let them cook all day.  I added a couple of handfuls of cheese to them as I mashed them and left out the pico de gallo.  My husband said they tasted like his grandma's (a huge compliment!)  I will never be using canned beans again!  Thank you for a great and easy recipe!

This dish is tasty, and very easy to make.  (Even I was able to make it!)  As bean recipes go, I found it unique in my experience, and it is every bit as good when eaten cold from the fridge the next day!  I will be making this again.  Thank you, Runnergirl.

Halved the recipe (since there are only 2 of us) added all the garlic and onion, just a pinch of salt. Added a small cube of salt pork, and a couple pinches of both cumin and chili powder. I did not mash, but left the beans whole. Made my own pico de gallo. Fast and easy.

I made these beans in a crock pot set on high for about four hours and they came our with great flavor and consistency without mashing or cheese. Think of it as a blank canvas recipe that you can modify easily to your tastes. I added a little soft cooked bacon and a touch of liquid smoke for a smoky flavor as well as a little jalapeno and cayenne for mild spice.  When they sit in the refrigerator for a while, they can get a little dried out, so I'd recommend adding a little water or other liquid before storing and sealing tightly.

This was my first recipe cooking beans in my Instant Pot.  First of all, I did soak these overnight. Before I started cooking I ended up taking out about 40% of the beans because I thought it might overflow. I set my Instant Pot for 25 minutes and they came out great. They probably could have used 20 minutes instead. I think I would have been save if I would have used all the beans, but most of the recipes I saw for Instant Pot only usd 1 pound of beans.  When they were done, I sprinkled on Dis N' Dat since I didn't put in any salt initially.

Nice tasting beans!  I had tons of beans so made one recipe on the stove top and one recipe in the crock pot.  Beans in the crockpot took a solid 14 hours to soften.  Stove top was perfect.

I loved this! I add some cayenne pepeer- just a little to this. I also cut up some red chilli- also, just a little. What can I say, I like heat! Either way, loved this!  Also, used yellow onion since I didn't have any red on hand. I also used none of the optional ingredients. Oh, and I also made a much smaller amount; enough for 1 person since I was only feeding myself.

This were so good!  I followed others suggestions and added a lot less salt.  We used left overs the next day by spreading the beans inside a tortilla and adding cheese and home made pico de gallo (use the recipe from this site "Chef Scott's Pico de Gallo).  I will be making this again!
