Almost exactly the same way I cook Picadillo! Only I used white wine and did not have capers. Delicious. My entire family loves Picadillo.

I learned of this recipe and Cuban food by reading one of the submitter's blogs. I was very excited to try this recipe and I was not let down. Although I've had nothing like it before (not a huge Cuban influence where I live) and nothing to compare it to, I can't imagine this "Picadillo" any other way. What a tasty dish! I thought the red wine would over power, but it really only added to the flavours. The browned potatoes added something too. Next time I may get them a little crispier for some more texture.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of omitting the raisins. I just can't bring myself to eat them. I imagine they would've added a sweetness that we obviously didn't miss. Thanks lutzflcat for sharing a cultural dish that we would have never known about. It's a keeper!

I'm the submitter of this recipe, and one change I've made since submitting this recipe is that I slice the olives instead of chopping.  Makes for nicer presentation and you get more olive flavor from the slices.

I made this tonight with Congri (Cuban black beans and rice), and it was a winner! I'm half Puerto Rican, but never cook the food I grew up eating, it always seemed so time consuming to make. This is actually a pretty easy dish to make, and reminds me of the filling my mother makes for empanadillas, particularly the olives, capers and raisins. Like another reviewer, I took a shortcut, i cubed the potatoes and microwaved them while browning the meat. I thought I had raisins, but couldn't find them, so I resorted to picking them out of a bag of trail mix! I didn't have the amount the recipe called for, but that was ok, because that's the one thing I don't care for in the empanadilla filling. My boyfriend was hesitant initially -  he wasn't sure what to make of the picadillo, but a few bites in, and he was hooked. Instead of plain white rice, I recommend making congri, which is pretty easy and flavorful, and can be made alongside this dish (especially if you use a recipe that calls for canned black beans - I used one that was not from allrecipes).

This is what we (two of us with some taste-testing from my visiting daughter) had for dinner, half the recipe, that is, and we agreed that it is a keeper!  I do think I would do things just a tad different next time.  First, I won't forget to buy the green pepper!  I made no sub for that.  Second, I would add double the cumin (personal preference).  Third, I used regular-sized green olives and cut them in half, but next time I'd either quarter them or slice them in neat little slices (I'd like more of a bite of them more often).  Fourth, I'd cut the potatoes a little smaller---about 3/8" to 1/2" cubes and maybe even add just a little tiny bit of butter to the olive oil to make them brown a little better.  I loved it when I had a raisin in my fork--just that little bit of sweetness was great!  We do have a few leftovers, but we are going to wrap those in flour tortillas with a little cheese and salsa this weekend!  I'll let you know how that turns out!  Thanks for this new taste treat!

I halved the recipe to use 3/4 pound of ground beef. I nuked the potato to save dirtying a pan, used white wine instead of red and doubled up on the olives (we like our olives). Never having eaten picadillo before I wasn't sure what to expect. After it simmered for a bit I ended up doubling the cumin and oregano and will probably double the potato next time as well. (I liked the idea of frying the potatoes before adding so they wouldn't get mushy) A tasty dish, definitely different from our usual. Thanks, lutzflcat, I will make this again.

This "Cuban-Style Picadillo" was excellent! I loved the way the sweetness of the wine permeated even the capers and olives. This meal is a real treat! I can hardly wait to make it again! My only change next time will be to fry the cumin with the ground beef and onion mixture as I usually do (instead of adding the cumin in with the liquids as in this recipe) to take the "raw edge" off my freshly-ground spice. Thank you lutzflcat for sharing your recipe!

Made this tonight, turns out just for myself. I used a meatloaf mix. That is what I had. Didn't have any golden raisins therefore omitted. I really liked it. I imagine the raisins would counter act the richness of the wine and meat. If I do make again, I will have to plan better. Thanks for the post lutzcat

It was easy and delicious! I used 1/2 lb ground pork and 1 lb ground beef. I did not use capers as my family don't like them.

Just like my Cuban mother and sisters in law make!!  Followed the recipe exactly - but doubled it!!  Only thing different is I added a little bit of rice wine vinegar (cuz I like the tang and I made empanadas with some of it), and added slivered almonds, cuz that's how my husbands family makes it!!!  Delicious and the perfect filling for the empanadas!!

Excellent! Even my husband who doesn't like green olives or care for capers highly approved! Made this recipe as written and there's such a perfect balance of flavors coming together. No need for changes!  Served with steamed jasmine (white) rice and Best Black Beans (also on this site). Will make again! Thanks for the recipe!

I took note of the strong suggestion to not skip wine and all I had was Marsala. This turned out so delicious that I almost popped because I couldn't stop eating it. I added a 22oz can of tomato sauce and about 3/4 c of marsala instead of the 2 cups of red wine. I will definitely be making this again!

Left out the potatoes and reduced the raisins to lower the sugar. Reduced the capers and olives as I only had 1 pound of beef. Served with fried plantains and sour cream. Both hubby and I loved it!

Yummy!! The only thing I did different was I used sherry instead of red wine and added some crispy fried potatoes. Served with white rice and toasted Cuban bread.

This was delicious. I'd never made Picadillo before and was so pleased with the results. What makes it wonderful is the perfect combination of savory, sweet, and salty. I served it over basmati rice. Instead of actual beef I used a 12oz pack of Quorn "beef" crumbles and just over 1 cup of red wine to simmer it in. The response from the family was "This is delicious! Definitely keep this recipe!".  Will do :)

This is the first time I ever had Picadillo. I wasn't sure what to expect. It is surprisingly delicious and easy to prepare.  It was a flavor and texture explosion in my mouth. The dish is well balanced- sweet, savory, salty. The meat, raisins,  potatoes, caper and olives lend a variety of textures.  I'll be making this again :)
