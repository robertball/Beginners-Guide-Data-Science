Very good! But I didn't have all of the items at home so I used 8 oz of thin spaghetti, 1 can of diced tomatoes in garlic and onion sauce, i didn't have any mushrooms but I added some chopped onion and bell pepper. When I added the tomato sauce I also added chopped olives.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious! I did do some things different - minced garlic instead of cloves, canned diced tomatoes w/garlic and onion instead of fresh tomatoe. And I added sauted onions and spinach.

I, like some others, modified it just a little bit. I sauteed the sausage first, then added chopped onion, 2 cloves of garlic and basil. I then added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and let it all simmer while the pasta cooked. When the pasta was ready, I combined the pasta and a can of diced tomatoes with chilis then poured the sausage mix on top and tossed. It was a very good meal and very easy to make. My family really enjoyed it.

I changed this recipe too, based on what I had on hand. I browned the smoked sausage and added about 1/4 cup each of chopped onion and green pepper along with 2 cloves garlic, 1 can drained diced tomatoes with mild green chili's, a small can of sliced black olives, an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and some italian seasoning. Also, I used thin spaghetti instead of angel hair. Very quick, easy and delicious.

Great tasting dish. No matter if you use fresh or canned tomatos or what kind of pasta, the flavor combination is what makes it.

Very pleased!  I didn't have all items on hand so I used garlic, onion, dried basil and canned diced tomatoes with Linguine noodles.  Very easy to make and a recipe that can be played with over and over again.  Next time I'm thinking I'll add some spinach and mussels!

Great recipe! I added some more seasonings from my spice rack and also added tomato sauce as someone had suggested. I've made this a few times now and it's a favorite in our house!

Deeelish! I had cheddar smoked sausage to use up and typed that into the search box...I figured I had most of the ingredients for this recipe and turned out to be really good! The house smelled delightful and it was a different twist on an old classic and light, but filling!

Simple and flavorful.  We used an italian style chicken sausage and had to substitute the fresh basil with dried.  When we do this again, we will definite add in some onions and peppers to kick it up a bit.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  The only changes I made were based on what I had on hand.  I used canned tomatoes, with basil and oregano, and added some green peppers and onions.  Everybody here loved it!  Definitely a keeper, as it was quick, easy, and delicious!

Everyone here loved this main dish!  We couldn't find regular Turkey sausage at the store (which was kinda strange) so we used the flavored one that they had (Sweet Italian Turkey Sausage).  So nice!  I'll be repeating this recipe often in the future.

If you like smoked sausage, this "sauce" had great flavor.  Personally, I don't care for smoked sausage but thought that this would be good with some chicken or shrimp.

I followed the recipe except I cooked the sausage first and sauteed it a bit longer since my pasta wasn't ready yet. It was delicious! My husband gave it a thumbs up.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I sauted the sausage with the basil and garlic, then I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of water instead of fresh mushrooms, and simmered it for about 10 minutes then added the pasta.  This made it very creamy!  I know we'll make this one again!

SOOOO Delicious!  Used a big can of whole plum tomatoes (with basil added) and roughly chopped them before adding them.  I used venison smoked sausage because that is what I had, but it would be delicious with any type of smoked sausage. I used 3 cloves chopped garlic.  Added a touch of red wine!! Will definitely make again! Quick and easy! My husband loved it!

My husband is a picky eater but he said I could make this again. To make its Healthier I used Turkey smoked sausage, and whole wheat penne pasta, I used  my own canned diced tomato's. There are just endless possibilities you can  with this receipe.

I used a can of italian diced tomatoes and a can of artichoke hearts. I also used penne pasta instead of angel hair pasta. My entire family loved this and it's quick and easy!

YUMMY!!!!I made this for the first time tonight and my family loved it!! I read all the reviews and added onions, a can of Italian tomatoes along with the few fresh plum totamatoes I had in the fridge. I added black olives and even added some fresh mozzarella cut up into little chunks just because I needed to use it.

I couldn't find smoked sausage, so I used artichoke chicken sausage.  I used only 13 oz of sausage and felt it was plenty.  I suggest doubling the tomatoes.  Feel free to add other vegetables as well.  This is a very quick dish -- the mixture will be ready by the time the pasta is!

This was just "ok". I thought it was little bland. Was very quick and easy to make though- great dinner to make on a night you're working late.

My ingredients were beef polish sausage and spiral pasta. My additions were a can of diced tomatoes, yellow pepper, and spinach.  Nice change from spaghetti and sauce dinner. It could use a bit more spice, this recipe is easily adjustable and quick.

My family loves this dish and if there are leftovers they don't stick around long. We enjoy it as written for it's great taste and simplicity.  If time allows I  sometimes beef it up a bit by adding onion and red & yellow bell peppers plus a couple of cans of diced tomatoes (1 fire roasted & 1 Italian) and a small can of tomato sauce.  It's terrific with sweet Italian sausage too. Season with sea salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and basil.

Excellent! I used bulk sausage and cut the casings and cooked. I also added frozen spinach. My two boys, 2 and 6 loved it!
