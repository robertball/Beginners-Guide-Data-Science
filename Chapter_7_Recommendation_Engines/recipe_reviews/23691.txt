I've made almost this same recipe for over 25 years. Instead of cream of chicken soup I use cream of celery soup. And I do it a little different way, also. First, I peel and slice the potatoes, medium slices, then I heat a fry pan with 1 tablespoon of cooking oil and lightly brown the pork chops. I take the pork chops out of the fry pan and set aside. Save the oil and drippings in the fry pan. 
 Now, in the baking pan cover the bottom with 1 layer of potato slices, cover slices with a little coating of the soup mixture, continue layering the potatoes and soup in a similar manner, until all of the potato slices and soup mixture is used. Next, take the oil and drippings from browning the pork chops and pour over the top of the soup and and potatoes. Place the pork chops on TOP. This way the juices from the chops run down into the soup and potatoes, making them taste less bland. The potatoes cook all the way through this way, too. Cover with foil, then bake. For the last 10 minutes of baking, remove the foil.

This was very good for a quick easy, hassle free, one dish meal.  The chops very tender.  I did pre-cook the potatoes after reading other reviews.  I also added mushrooms, seasoned to my taste.  Great idea!

I have to admit that I agree with some of the other reviewers that it is a little bland.  The meat did turn out very tender.  I will definately try this recipe again and try something to give it some more flavor.  All the same.....thanks for posting.

This recipe is great!  This is the 2nd time to try it.  I made a few modifications (sliced onions, mushrooms, fresh garlic and even some sliced sausage mixed in with the potatoes on top).  Also, I added Essence and Italian Seasoning to the chops.  I scaled it down for 2 chops & only used ONE can of Cream/Room soup and milk/cooking sherry mix for the liquid instead of water.  BTW, my potatoes were cooked fully cooked PERFECT.  I also covered it for the entire hour for fear of not enough liquid and/or drying out.  Hubby LUVED it doesn't have to be served immediately either.  It "sits" VERY well :)  Thank you!  It's a "keeper"  :)

An average but easy pork chop recipe. I personally thought it to be a little bland - it could use some onion, garlic or onion powders, perhaps even some all-season salt or a combination of all three but it was decent. It certainly didn't taste bad ~ just comfort food! Everyone "liked" it - we just didn't go crazy over it. However, my visiting pregnant girlfriend, who has been suffering from "all-day sickness" really enjoyed this! It's easy on the stomach I guess!!

This was bland.  And my pork chops were not as tender as I thought they would be.  The potatoes cooked unevenly, depending on where they were located, some were hard and some were mushy.  Overall, I like the recipe better where you use the rice instead of potatoess.

I made this meal last night and really impressed my husband with it, whose only comment was:  You can make THIS anytime, honey.  The only thing I added were mushrooms.  Very, very good.

Recipe is yummy - total comfort food - but I would recommend pre-cooking the potatoes, at least 1/2 way.  And you might want to consider covering the pan with foil for the first half of the cooking time, then uncover.  I also added canned mushrooms, yum!  I'm going to try it with rice next time - hope it comes out just as good! I also seasoned the chops with Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb -- totally improves the dish!

this is the way i cooked this easy recipe.

browned the bacon then drained on paper towels, in the meantime i caramelized a diced onion about the size of a baseball and 3 minced garlic toes in the bacon drippings, seasoned 6 boneless pork chops with pork seasoning and dropped 2 lbs of large potatoes into boiling water for about 10 minutes. (when you buy the potatoes you can use the scales in the store to get the right amount.

the onions/garlic and the potatoes should be done about the same time..all thats left to do is cube the potatoes drain the onions/garlic add the rest of the ingredients and bake as the recipe says.

My mother made this for us as children and I still make today. We cooked the chops the same but served the gravy over rice and corn instead of the potato. I will try this way next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty! Since I only made this with 4 pork loin chops I chose to only use one can of soup with about 1/4 cup of water. Based on another reviewer I used celery soup vs chicken or mushroom. I did however use fresh mushrooms and half of a small yellow onion. I put the sliced potatoes (not cubed) in the bottom of the roasting pan and put the chops on top after I had seared them in a little EVOO. Then I poured the skillet remains over the top of the entire dish. I added various seasonings like onion and garlic powder, cracked pepper and salt. I also sprinkled on some Italian seasoning just over the meat. I covered it in foil for the first 40 minutes. Baked for another 15 without the foil. The potatoes were perfect and very flavorful. The meat was slightly over cooked, but that was my fault since the slices were thin. I should have kept a better eye on them. I think with the suggestions to add extra seasonings and veggies to the dish, plus using celery soup, made it a success flavor wise. I will make it again.

Chops came out very tender. Had to cook 30 minutes longer but I may have added more potatoes than called for. One change I'd make is to add onion.

Be sure to cook the potatoes first.  We added mushrooms and bought the creamed soups with herbs in it for additional seasoning.

This dinner could have been a lot better with better directions.  The potatoes that were on top or not fully covered barely cooked.  Also the seasoning was lacking, trying a rub or even just salt and pepper on the chops before beginning would have added a lot more flavor.

I wanted to try this because it seemed like an easy one dish casserole, and it was. However, follwing the others suggestions about it being bland, I made a few changes. First of all I added some onion powder, fresh garlic, italian seasoning, and mixed herb spices to the soup and water mix. I added some lightly cooked onions and mushrooms as well. I poured the soup mixture in a pan with the potatoes. I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper, and a seasoned meat tenderizer. i placed the pork chops on top and covered the pan with foil. Not only were the pork chops tender but flavorful as well. This simple dinner was a hit!

This was on the bland side.  Although everyone ate it, it probably won't make a usual in our house.  I think it might be better with only cream of mushroom and no cream of chicken.

I made this the other night and it was delicious. The only change I made was, I bought cream of chicken with herbs soup and cream of mushroom, with garlic. I salted the pork chops before adding potatoes and soup mixture, It was very yummy. My family gobbled it up. No leftovers. Love that. The soup with the added spices, really made the flavor work, without being bland.

The first time I made this it took FOREVER to get the potatoes done and I'm way too lazy to do the pre-cook thing, but I read one of the reviews that said to use a baking bag and that was the answer!  Hey, you do it with a roast and they come out done, right?  It works with this too.  I did add onions and some basic seasonings.  Easy and everybody loved it!

My mother used to make this when I was a kid, so it only feels natural for me to make it for my family! Using a baking bag makes it that much easier to cook and clean up. I love the thicker boneless chops, they work the best!

All I can say is that it is edible and quick.  The potatos were still hard even though I cooked it for 90 minutes instead of 60.  Maybe eliminating the potatoes and serving it with rice would be better.  I don't plan on making it again.

Good and simple.  My changes:   Sliced instead of cubed potatoes, nuked the potatoes for 5 minutes, seared the chops,  put the chops on top of the potatoes, added 1 tbsp soy to the soup.  My wife loved it said it was not bland.

So surprised no one liked this.  I browned three chops & sliced the potatoes on top.  Just one can of cream of mush soup with 1/2c milk.  Covered for an hour or so them removed the lid.  'Don't see how the potatoes would cook without a little steam.  Too cream of mushroom-y, I guess is the problem for us.  It's an obvious cream of something soup desperation dinner.  'Glad the pork chops were on sale.  :/

This was SO GOOD! I modified it based on what I had on hand.  I cut up an onion and potatoes into slices and lined the crock pot bottom with them. I then put about a 2.5 pound pork loin on top and put more potatoes over that. I mixed Cream of Mushroom, Cream of Celery, some salt, pepper, 1 Cup of water, and some italian seasoning and then poured that over the potatoes and loin.  I cooked in crock pot on low for 8 hours...house smelled delicious and EVERYONE, even my one year old, gobbled it up!

Anyone that made a negative comment did not follow the recipe.  I followed it exactly as specified and it turned out perfect.  The next time I make this dish I will add some carrots, green beans, onions, and mushrooms.

It was a simple and yummy meal. On a busy work night this is a fast and easy meal that my husband and I loved.  I added some fresh rosemerry and fresh mushrooms and grilled some esparigus on the side.

I made this last night and it turned out great. I did follow some advice from other reviews though. Used Cream of mushroom/roasted garlic soup, yum. I also added sauteed onions and garlic to the soup. I used red potatoes, boiled them until cooked about half way, then sliced them, lined the bottom of the baking dish with them and poured half the soup over. I seasoned my pork chops and put them on top, pouring the rest of the soup over. I also covered with foil the entire cooking time. My pork chops were thinner and I only used 4 so it only took about 30 min to cook. I would definitely make this again!

I used the thin slice chops and they were perfect.  Also diced the potatoes small and they were good for the most part, a crunchy one here and there.  We really like the flavor of this.  It will become a staple in our house.  So easy to make too, you can't beat it!

It's a dish very easy to prepare. I also added rosemary. Although I would suggest decreasing the amount of water to maybe 1/2 cup. Definitely worth another try.

This recipe was very easy. I precooked the potatoes as noted in previous reviews, added mushrooms, and seasoned the pork chops to taste.

Very good alternative to rice, which can get boring.  This dish was very easy, especially with the common ingredients that I usually have on hand.

I seasoned the chops with seasoned salt, pepper and minced onions and added about a cup of grated cheese and a third cup of sour cream to the soup mixture as well as salt and pepper to the soup and potatoes.  It turned out pretty good but needed still more salt and pepper.  I also took the potatoes out and microwaved then for about 15 min when I realized they were not going to get done then added them back to the meat until it was done.

nice recipe- cooked potatoes 15 min before adding them to the recipe, added spices (chili pepper ) and mushrooms.  Also put apple slices on top of pork chops before adding potatoes.  Will make again.

This was good.  Nothing fancy, but very easy and tasty.  I cut the recipe in half, using only the cream of mushroom, and covered the pan with foil while it baked.  Cook time was a little bit longer than stated to get the potatoes nice and tender.  I ate this over white rice which was great with the sauce.

The meat was very tender... however, the potatoes did cook unevenly. I will make this again, however I will pre-cook the potatoes next time. I added garlic salt & lemon pepper to the meat & will add mushrooms to the sauce next time. Overall, I really liked it. Simple & good....
