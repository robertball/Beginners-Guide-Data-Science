Wow! An elegant, easy and extremely delicious way to prepare butternut squash. I add a bit of chicken stock at a time because I found the whole amount to make it a bit to runny. I also add the maple syrup "to taste". What a fantastic combination of flavours!

This is a delicious recipe, was very well received on Thanksgiving, and so much easier than my previous squash recipe that required the squash to be peeled and cubed.  I used large butternut squash and found that they needed to bake for at least 90 minutes before they were very tender.  I read the reviews about it being a bit too soupy, so I added just enough chicken broth and maple syrup to puree the squash and it came out perfectly.  I will definitely make this again.

This is delicious. My family has always loved winter squash, but this savory version is really a hit. Every guest that has been served it has asked for the recipe!

THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!!! Everyone always wants to know what is in it!!!  One comment, mine was really thin the first time I made it, so I made some adjustments.  This is also wonderful for making mashed sweet potatoes.  Just substitute an equal amount of baked sweet potato....YUM!

Very good side dish for autumn meals. I baked the squash for 90 minutes and didn't add any chicken stock and the consistency was good. The only other thing I will change when I make this again is to use less onion; it competed with the squash for the dominant flavor.

I couldn't get the mixture smooth, perhaps I didn't cook the squash enough?  Someone mentioned that it looked like baby food, which it does.  The taste was good though, so I think if I make it again, I'll cook the squash longer and try to tweak the presentation.

I would lighten up a bit on the onions, but otherwise I love it!  Kinda like yams, another favorite veggie of mine :)

Had a large squash in the frig and have made butternut squash with maple syrup before and loved it. Didn't add the onion, because I didn't like the way it sounded. Added dried ginger (1/2 tsp); about 1/2 tsp of fresh grated ginger; 1/2 tsp of crystallized ginger; dash of cinnamon; grind of black pepper; 1/3 cup sugar free maple syrup and 2 tblspns of melted butter and mashed with potato masher; but left some chunks. Sprinkled Splenda on the top and baked in 350 oven until warm. Great!

The nutmeg and onions give this a wonderfully sweet taste. I don't even use the maple syrup most of the time.

A little too runny, but delicious!  It disappeared at dinner.  I'll use less broth or more squash next time.

Super easy!  This recipe has a wonderful flavor.  I altered the directions; basically I had already peeled and cubed the squash before looking up an idea.   I followed the steps, but preferred to use my potato masher instead of the food processor.  We don't eat much squash down here in the south, but missed it from my childhood.  This recipe looks a lot like mashed sweet potatoes...I think I can trick the kids. :)

I love squash and always need new ways to serve it. This was delicous. I did make some changes. When I scooped it out of the shell I kept the shell intact so I could serve the squash in the shells and I did not puree it because I prefered chunks of onion and squash

I was really surprised by how much I liked this recipe.  I'm always looking for more squash recipes that aren't the typical soup.  I didn't puree it so there were still onion pieces but I thought it added texture.  Very tasty!

This came out a little soupier than I expected. I should have paid more attention when adding the broth. The maple syrup adds a nice flavor, although the butternut squash we grew was pretty sweet to begin with. I will try it next time with acorn squash.

This was great and easy to do. However next time I make this I'll put way less maple syrup (maybe just a dash) as I found it to be quite sweet for a side dish.

I baked a blue pumpkin and had enough for more than 4 batches of this. I put it all in a crockpot for Thanksgiving. I like the delicious mixture of sweet and savory.

I first made this five years ago for my first attempt at hosting the Thanksgiving gathering. It has been requested at every family holiday meal since. absolutely delicious and very easy. Make a double batch...leftovers freeze and reheat beautifully.

The only thing that I changed was that I omitted the chicken broth, so it wouldn't get runny .  I added onion powder since other reviewers said that added actual onions competed with the other flavors and last but not least I added more nutmeg.  It turned out delicious!!!  Will be making again.

Easy and delicious!  I made it as written. The second time, I used pre-cubed squash and cut down the roasting time. My 4 year old ate 3 servings.

This was easy enough to make, and I was excited by the maple syrup.  However, I had to cook the squash about 90 minutes to make it nice and soft, and in the end, the flavor was just off.  Too strong of an onion flavor, and somewhat bland.  I added cinnamon, which made it better, but this recipe was just not a winner in my book.  On to bigger and better squash recipes so I can take advantage of the seasonal veggies!

I added some pecans that were sauted in a little butter and brown sugar and placed them on top (our family likes nuts). It was good but definitely don't use all the chicken stock it calls for or it will be runny. Add a little and then add more as needed.

Yum! This was really tasty and super easy to make! I made a few changes to reflect my cooking style and the ingredients I had on hand. Instead of pureeing I simply  hand blended for about a minute for a more rustic texture. I was out of plain nutmeg so substituted pumpkin pie spice which worked well and also used the chicken stock sparingly. I used a splash to lubricate the blending process and another splash before reheating in the pan. The dish to me was a little sweeter than expected but I think that a cool creamy garnish, such as sour cream or even plain greek yogurt would add a lovely balance to the sweetness of this dish. Overall, tho... de-lish!!
