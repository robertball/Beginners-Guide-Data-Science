really good.. creamy and delicious!  i didn't pre-boil the veggies as the recipe asks.. (figured they're going to cook in there for 40 minutes anyway)... so i think you can eliminate that step.  i did not add carrots, but added 3 cubed, peeled potatoes, and served it over reheated mashed potatoes.  delicious

Really good soup.  My family doesn't like carrots very much so I substituted mushrooms and sauted them with the onions.  We all enjoyed this recipe very much.

I thought this was pretty good for how easy it was.  I did not preboil the veggies either, and it turned out fine.  Also, I added some shredded cheddar on top when it was done.

Delicious and easy to make.  I made it with skim milk and it was still very good.  My husband and I both loved it--next time I will double the recipe to have more leftover!

My husband and I really like this recipe. Ditto the potato and the shredded cheddar. I also added a pinch of red pepper, some dry veggie broth, and a couple of dry bay leaves just to give it more flavor and body.I didn't have any parsley, so that got left out. Really great recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe! I did add some heavy cream to make it a bit richer and also some velveeta for a cheesy taste. Also I chopped up the broccoli pretty good so that there weren't huge chuncks of brocolli in it. All and all it was pretty good!! YUM! Thank you!

Very yummy!  No potatoes are needed, as they would change this great recipe from a cream soup to more of a chowder.  The flour in this soup thickens it nicely and gives it a creamy taste without the fat.

My husband and nine year old liked this soup. I thought it needed something. I didn't add all of the salt b/c we just don't use it. I added some fresh herbs from the garden and that helped a lot. I also used whole wheat flour to make it healthier, as well as skim milk.

It's okay.  Need to play around with it to get more flavor.  If have an opportunity to try another recipe for Broccoli Soup, try it.

Very easy basic recipe that turned out very well.  I do not usually make cream soups, but this was so simple and quite tasty.  As per other reviews I did skip the pre-boil step and I added a couple of potatoes, diced, and I used skim milk to cut the fat.  Even with skim milk the soup was quite rich and filling.  Will definately make again.

This recipe was quite easy to make and had a nice texture. However,I had to add  fresh parmesan,french onion soup mix and more garlic since it lacked flavour.

It was too much carrot for my taste.  Keeping the recipe just going to add half the amount of carrot next time, was just over powering.  Added in a little cheddar cheese to help the carrot taste tone down a bit, and topped with bacon crumbles.

I have had this recipe in my book for a while now and I finally had time to try it. I will agree with many of the reviewers who stated the soup taste bland. I had to add various seasonings, cheddar, and chicken before I liked the results. I'd say listen to the reviewers and don't throw away the water you drain the vegetables in. Outside of that, it's a good recipe for the base of a broccoli soup. Fresh minced garlic is a great idea by the way. I think next time I make it I will add rice.

The taste is very bland, even though I added sauteed garlic and some colorful peppers. It was easy to make, and looks nice but doesn't have enough flavor for me to make this again.

I like this recipe!  Did not boil veggies - cut those directions out.  Added a chopped red pepper for color & 2 T pesto for flavor rather then the parsley.  Topped with grated cheddar & served with garlic cheese bread.  Whole family liked it.

super easy and delicious! omg! no blending necessary. And dont throw out the water where you boil the veggies. I did that and immediately regretted it. Steam the veggies better, dont lose their nutrients.

Very good soup. followed the ingredients just as stated but followed the advice of a few other reviewers. insted of cooking the veggies in the water in the beggining, i sauted the onion, carrots anc celery in the butter until tender. I added the broccoli and some diced uncooked chicken breast and only cooked it until the broccoli and chicken breast were cooked. I don't care for dark mushy broccoli. It turned out very fresh tasting. we all loved it. will be a recipe that goes in my box.

I added 4 tsp chicken bouillon granules at the end because it was sort of bland and I used partially thawed and chopped frozen broccoli florets instead of fresh.

You were right to name this "Best" broccoli soup because it is. I didn't have garlic powder so added a tsp of fresh chopped garlic instead. It was a huge hit with my hubby. He said he wouldn't change a thing. I'm having guests over for dinner and I already bought my broccoli to make it. Thanks for sharing!

This is a good start to a great soup. I added 2 cups of sharp shredded cheese and 1 cup of chopped ham. I used 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of 1% milk. I think that without the addition of the ham and cheese, this would have been a very bland soup. All in all this is a good  soup. You just have to tweak it to your liking.

I loved this soup. My friends call me the soup natzi. I did add 2 cubed potatos,1 and 1/2t. of garlic powder,1/2t. Tony's, and 1c. of vegetable stock (b/c of the potatos). That's it. It came out perfect. Creamy and delicious, just like I like it

Excellent soup! I downloaded the recipe and my husband made it so I wouldn't have to cook when I got home. I just pureed most of it and left some of the veggies chunky for texture. We will definitely have this again.

Delicious - even with frozen broccoli. A friend and I had at least 3 bowls each and my 16 month old twins ate it up. This is such a delicious creamy soup that my friend thought there was cheese in it!

I really enjoyed this soup.  The ony thing I did differently was add more frozen veggies for more color and flavor.  It was definitely very filling and healthy!  I made garlic bread for dipping, too.  I will definitely be making this again!

This soup was delicious. I mixed in some shredded cheddar cheese and also topped it off with some and it was a fabulous hit! Everyone wanted to take home leftovers.

Great recipe - Husband loved it.  I added 1 cup half and half for a creamier sauce.  Also added potatoes and a bit of garlic.  A real keeper.

This is one of the best soups I have ever had. I made it for friends one night, and my friend's husband said it was restaurant-quality, or even better!
