I made this according to recipe. I was the only one who liked the spices, the rest of the family didn't care for it. That is not a reflection of the recipe, just personal preferance. That said, this makes a lovely lemonade concentrate that is excellent in sparkling water.

I cooked the sugar-water-spice mixture for nearly 30 minutes, and it never did reach what I would consider a thick syrup stage.  Cooking as long it did, I expected the spice flavor to be completely infused into the liquid, but the end result is a very subtle spiciness.  I used the 4 lemons called for, but it took 4 Tbsp of the concentrate to really get a lemonade flavor, so I'll get fewer servings.  I do like having a small bottle of the concentrate in the fridge rather than a large pitcher of lemonade taking up valuable space.
