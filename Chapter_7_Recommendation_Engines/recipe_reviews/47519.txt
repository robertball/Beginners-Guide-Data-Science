5 stars with modifications: add a clove of garlic and a bag of baby spinach when sauting mushrooms and up the cream cheese to 8 oz.  Put mushroom mixture in 6 dollops on a plate and refrigerate until cool.  This makes it a lot easier for spreading.  I didn't use the brown sugar or walnuts but put buttered bread crumbs over the mustard.  I baked it at 375 for 25 minutes.  This is very delicious!!!

I'm sorry, but my family didn't care for this recipe at all.  We didn't like the way it tasted, although parts of it were okay.  I thought the cream cheese/mushroom filling was good, but I didn't like the dijon taste or the walnuts.  Also, I found it to be a huge pain to assemble.  Even with the chicken breasts pounded flat, the cream cheese and mushrooms kept oozing out.  This made it extremely difficult to get it into the mustard/brown sugar mixture, which was also a big, gooey mess.  Not at all worth the effort.

I followed many of the previous suggestions. I combined spinach, garlic, and reduced fat cream cheese for the filling and refrigerated it to make it easier to spread. Also substituted honey mustard for dijon, omitted the brown sugar, and used bread crumbs instead of nuts. We just finished eating and I've already gotten multiple requests for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome! I subbed pecans for walnuts and added shredded parmesan to the top of the chicken before baking.  It was FANTASTIC!!

I only used 2 chicken breasts since there's no way that we could have eaten 6 of them!  I also butterflied the breasts to get 4 thin pieces of meat.  I halved all the other ingredients and the proportions came out perfect.  I also omitted the nuts because I didn't have any on hand.  However, the recipe made pretty tastey and unique chicken.  I absolutely love the cream cheese and mushroom combination.  I think I might make hors oeuvres with them the next time we have guests.  My only complaint with this dish is that the brown sugar/mustard sauce did not quite go with the flavors going on with the cream cheese/mushrooms.  The sugar seemed to compete with the cheese, but would probably go great on the chicken alone.  I would have much preferred a white wine sauce, lemon sauce or an alfredo sauce to compliment this dish.

This was AWESOME! Excellent cold for lunch the next day. I put in a little extra filling. Used big breasts and sliced them. Worked well. Very easy.

This is one of those recipes that I didn't know right away if I liked it or not because of the variety of tastes. After about the third bite, I realized I liked it very much. Plus, after I had placed it on my plate and sliced it,it looked like something out of Gourmet Magazine. My husband didn't care for the filling and he suggested I use stuffing instead - we'll see. I rolled some in bread crumbs and liked the taste better.

Great recipe.  Fixed for company and received rave reviews.  Added chopped onion and marinated artichoke hearts to mushroom and cream cheese mixture and it was wonderful - very tasty.  It's a definite keeper.

Excellent!  Even my picky husband loved this recipe.  We didn't have any mushrooms, but the chicken still tasted fine without them.

This chicken is WONDERFUL!  I rolled it in chopped cashews instead of walnuts.  It came out looking very elegant, like something you would order at a restaurant, and it was so quick and EASY!  I loved the mix of flavors.  My boyfriend was totally impressed!!  Will definitely be making this again...Thanks for sharing!

Exquisite flavors! This could be 5 stars, but the cream cheese and mushroom mix was a little bland--would need salt and something else to bring out the flavor. Not sure what. Maybe thyme? We also needed more of it for 6 breasts. I rolled each breast in egg first, then mustard sauce, then nuts. Fantastic recipe! Will make again!

This was fantastic. I added some bell pepper, onions, bacon and seasoned the outside with garlic salt, parsley, rosemary, pepper and topped it off with grated fresh parmesan cheese and shredded colby/jack cheese. WOW! This definitely goes into the recipe box and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to cook something a "little different" from the norm.

I made this recipe, scaled to 2 servings. We loved it, and will make it again. I plan to make it when the kids and grandkids come next month. The only change I will make is to make less of the dijon sauce, I had a lot left over. It was so fast and easy, and could easily be made ahead and refrigerated until ready to pop it into the oven.

Quite tasty and will make again.  I wanted something that I could prepare in the morning and bake when guests arrived.  This was perfect.  I used the tip of adding spinach for color and I did chill the cream cheese mixture before rolling up.  I dipped the meat rolls in the sugar/mustard sauce and rolled in chopped pecans.  The flavor blend was excellent!   I served these with fresh tomatoes in a caprese salad with cibatta bread.

This chicken was GREAT!!! Very very rich!! However, I did have some trouble getting the breasts to roll up, then dipping them in the sauce and walnuts. Finally, I just spread the breasts with cream cheese mixture, then poured the dijon sauce over all and sprinkled walnuts on top and baked. I served it with jasmine rice. My teenage son had seconds and thirds!! We'll DEFINATELY make again and again, THANKS!!

Whoever made this and didn't suffer while rolling the chicken is a great cook. My husband and I had fun preparing this meal. It was a bit messy but fun. We didn't manage to roll it properly though. lol. We think it's a great meal for sugar lovers. We added more muchrooms and cream cheese and it came out fine.

Rating this based on the filling because I made a lot of changes...really great idea using the cream cheese for filling!  I added garlic powder, a little grated parmesan, fresh baby spinach, used light cream cheese, and instead of dijon/nuts i sprayed chicken with canola spray and sprinkled with breadcrumbs.  Delish :)

This was OK. I really did like the variety of flavor it offered, but it really was a hassle to put together and bake. If I make this again I will simply put the sauce on the chicken, roll in the nuts and bake, then add the cream cheese mixture afterwards. I think it would be good to either top the chicken with the mixture or use it as a bed for the chicken.

It was extra work to pound the chicken breasts out but the end result was well worth it.  I recommend backing off on the amount of mustard as it was a bit overpowering.  Good recipe for a nice dinner at home or for guests.  Thanks for sharing it!

I made this dish for my Sister-In-Law's birthday dinner.  Everyone went wild over it!  I served it with fresh green beans suate'd in butter and garlic.  She travels for her work and she told that this dish looked and tasted like meals she ate in five star restraunts.  I will definitely make this dish again-everyone had seconds and it disappeared quickly!!!

I made this for my boyfriend and I and he absolutely loved it! I added garlic into the stuffing and didn't do brown sugar or nuts. I may do brown sugar next time and I'm allergic to certain nuts. I put the bread crumbs on instead and it was a good alteration. The cooking time didn't work well with my oven unfortunately but it was still delicious! Thank you :)
10/19/2011: Made it a second time with cut up spinach which I cooked with the mushrooms and garlic. I also kept the brown sugar out and just had the mustard and Italian bread crumbs this time. We still absolutely love this chicken! boyfriend wont eat the last one till absolutely cant save it any longer ha ha!

I hate to give a bad review! Sorry but I just didn't like the combination of flavors in this one. The sweetish taste combined with the flavour of the nuts tasted quite odd.The texture of the dish didn't help either as it was just too mushy.My hubby who is known to have a "cast-iron stomach" didn't like this one at all and he eats almost everything without complaint. I will have to pass on this one.

Our family really enjoyed this recipe & I will make it again. My 8 year old just loved it & had several helpings! 

I seasoned the chicken & used pecans instead of walnuts. It was pretty easy to do but the chicken was a bit difficult to roll in the nuts. I think next time I will line the bottom with nuts before coating the chicken w/the brown sugar/dijon mixture. Then I will put the chicken in the pan and press the nuts on the tops/sides. I think it will be a bit less messy that way.

Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I really played around with this recipe.  I added onions, garlic, bacon( I  keep extra bacon cooked in the freezer) and a Wisconsin cheddar/ blue cheese to the mix.  I also mixed the walnuts with bread crumbs because I did'nt have enough walnuts. This isn't something that you should eat very often, but worked with unexpected company!

This recipe was okay. I followed some of the other reviews and added garlic and spinach to the cream cheese mixture, which was great. However, the recipe as a whole was a mess to clean up and not all that good. I thought it was a little bland, and I didnt care for the brown sugar and mustard mixture. A meh recipe.

This was really really good. I used chive and onion cream cheese with the mushrooms. I didn't have walnuts so I crumbled and wetted croutons and spread them on top. I also used honey mustard instead of Dijon and pasted extra on top before serving. It was really good with the brown sugar. Makes for a good left over too!

I thought this recipe was absolutely wonderful!  Will definately be a part of our monthly menu.  I only changed three minor things from the original recipe: first salt & pepper the chicken after it was pounded out (next time will use a little garlic salt) and second was I used a small amount of thin sliced almonds instead of walnuts (that is just personal taste) and third, I added a light sprinkle of bread crumbs which coated the areas between the almonds.  Really a great entree!

This recipe was awesome!  At first I wasn’t sure how all the different flavors would mesh, but it was delicious.  It was easy to make and had a great appearance.  I plan to make it for my next dinner party.

In the top 5 best chicken dishes I have ever tried. I made it exactly as described except I used almond slithers instead of walnuts. I could barely taste the mushrooms, you could even omit them if you wanted. The dijon & brown sugar tasted funny out of the bowl until it baked, it made the most delicious sweet sauce with a hint of mustard flavor. The dijon sugar sauce with the cream cheese taste like a beurre blanc sauce in your mouth. This recipe is very gourmet despite its plane cream cheese title. Of course my hands got messy rolling process but I used a thin spread of cream cheese and did not have any trouble with it running out of the chicken. Make sure you don't over hear the cream cheese- mine never came to a runny texture, just a slightly melted spread texture. Just amazing, you must try, and it took no time to make. 5 stars all the way!

For those who might be turned off by mushrooms: My eldest son is very picky about onions and mushrooms and lately has been a pain in the nether regions to feed, so in order to accomodate his palate, I substituted the mushrooms with a chopped apple (I had Macintosh on hand). I prepared it all the same way as listed in the recipe, sautéing the apple chunks in butter before adding the cream cheese to melt and all, and it turned out just lovely. Picky eater turned up his nose at the walnuts (which he liked a few days ago, argh) but he did still eat the chicken and cream cheese stuffing. 

I'd love to try the original version when I have mushroom-friendly guests over, but I'll also make the apple version again. And another thing, I was quite pleased with the presentation. It does make a pretty dish.

This was really good. My BF and his friends really LOVED it. I thought that it was pretty good. Some reviewers have said they have a hard time rolling up the chicken. I think that might be b/c of the mushrooms. Either use less or even though fresh mushrooms come sliced-slice them more if you use fresh- to make them smaller. Also, my BF introduced me to Jalapeno Pepper Jelly with Cream Cheese on Ritz Crackers for a snack. They are great! So it got me thinking that I might add some Jalapeno Pepper Jelly to the mushroom mixture after it cools and then spread it on the chicken. I think the flavor would mesh well with the others. Thanks.

The best chicken ever!! Even husband liked it so much he ate leftovers! (is the world ending!?) Made one minor change in that I used olive oil instead of butter to saute the mushrooms (dietary need). Didn't change anything else and it was perfect!! Thanks for a new favorite!

This is a great recipe.  I made without the mushrooms to avoid the "picky eaters" issues.  Flattened and stuffed the breasts the night before.  Then moved to a new dish topped with mustard/sugar mix and sprinkled walnuts over.  No leftovers.  Everybody loved it. 

I served with all recipes "garlicky green beens", rice pilaf and simple salad with buttermilk salad dressing.

Found this using the ingredient search, I was tired of the same old chicken breast recipes.  This was very good and easy.  I omitted the mustard and sugar and added chopped spinach to the cream cheese/mushroom mixture.  I added shreddded monterey cheese to the top of the chicken for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Thanks!

I was a little hesitant trying this at first.  After making it, it has now become one of my absolute favorite recipes.  I used baby shittake mushrooms and slivered almonds instead of walnuts.  It was excellent!

I normally don't change a recipe much from the way it is written, but after reading the reviews, I took some of their suggestions.  First hint:  Use fresh mushrooms!!!  I used canned and I know fresh would have much tastier.  Next time, I would add garlic, capers and/or spinach to the mushroom/cream cheese mixture for more oomph.  And I bypassed the brown sugar and nuts.  Too many people weren't crazy about that combo.  I just spread dijon mustard on the rolled up chicken and topped with buttered breadcrumbs.  Baked @ 350 degrees for 20 minutes. My beau LOVED this dish.  For company, I would probably serve a sauce with it.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Easy to prepare, beautiful presentation, and excellent taste. Try stuffing with spinach or jalapeno peppers for a slight variation. It can be prepared ahead of time and baked at the last minute.  Makes a great "company" dinner.

Very unique and delicious. My husband, who is hard to wow, really enjoyed this dish. Don't expect the cream cheese to actually melt...it just softens mostly, so don't burn it. The brown sugar-dijon rub is awesome, i will use that for other things too. I used pecans. mmmmm

This is good. But I used Spicey Dijon and I also added garlic. I didnt use any nuts. It was still missing something. But overall the flavors worked well. Use gloves when rolling the mixture...saves a headache.

I made this with mushrooms, spinach & onion/chive cream cheese.  It was a sloppy mess even after putting the cream cheese mixture in the freezer to cool off.  The "stuffing" wasn't that great but the dijoin/brown sugar coating was awesome.  Next time I will use just that (cut in half) and forget the cream cheese part.  You don't need as much mustard/sugar amounts as written...half would easly coat 6 chicken breasts.

Delicious recipe!  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the cheese mixture and refrigerated it as suggested, making it much easier to spread.  I had difficulty spreading the sugar/mustard mixture onto the chicken and making it stick, and it ended up in clumps on top of the chicken instead of all over, but it still tasted delicious.

Prepared as directed but used pecans rather than walnuts.  Found the recipe to be a bit too creamy for our tastes and a little bland.  Next time will prepare with more mustard and brown sugar mixture, perhaps adding a bit of garlic and some shallots to the mushrooms.

It tasted like we were at some fancy restaurant with a great chef. Really good. But it was almost too flavorful, so the first bite was great, and then it kind of got worse and worse.

This was good. Next time I will change a few things... I'd add some garlic, and change the brown sugar to honey so it's not quite so sweet.  But otherwise, it's a keeper. And quite easy and quick, too...

I really enjoyed this dish. The only thing I did differently was half the sugar, and it was still plenty sweet. Oh, I also added artichoke hearts. Delicious!

The cream cheese/mushroom combo was good, but all that brown sugar made it far too sweet.  And perhaps a hot mustard would work better than a Dijon.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it has a complex flavor.  I liked it but my guy LOVED it and even said, "Wow, you must have put a lot of work into this-this is gourmet!"  If you are doing this for company, definitely prepare this ahead of time-reviewers are right-it is quite messy.  I spread out a long sheet of wax paper on my counter before I started working and I'm glad I did-it was a mess and it was nice to just throw away the paper!  We both loved the stuffing-but we differed on the coating.  He loved it-I thought it was OK.  I am going to do this again using another reviewers suggestion and brush some butter on the chicken and then coat it with seasoned breadcrumbs.  The cream cheese and mushroom stuffing is a keeper though!!!

This recipe was delicious, though my "rolls" looked more like wraps.  I have a young infant and managed to "wow" my husband with this recipe for a quick "gourmet" meal.  Tastes great with Orzo Pasta with Walnuts and Mushrooms also available on allrecipes.

this dish is delicious! I made it almost exact to the recipe except for a small change. I didn't have any dijon mustard so I mixed the brown sugar with crushed pecans (didn't have walnuts) and after rolling the chicken I put it in the baking dish and I sprinkled and patted the brown sugar mixture onto the chicken rolls. I baked them for 45 minutes and it was baked perfectly. I served it with Brussels sprouts and home made biscuits. I recommend this dish, and will certainly make it again.

This was very good with the few changes I made.  I added garlic to the mushrooms, a sprinkling of sun dried tomatoes and used chive cream cheese.  I also did a panko crust and sprayed it with coconut oil to brown it.  Paired it with a salad with a lemon/olive oil/Dijon simple dressing.

Simple and delicious! I made this on a Monday night, my least favorite night to cook, and it was simple. I made little changes based on reviews...I added garlic to the mushroom mixture, used pre-sliced thin chicken and sprinkled Parmesan on the top. It was great!

I was wondering what to do for dinner to surprise my family and saw this recipe and tough it will be great to try it. So I went for it. In the process I found out I did not have mushrooms, so I dig in my fridge and decided to use cilantro and onion, instead.
It turn out great . My family loved it.

Very rich, but very, very good.  We added about a 1/4C diced red onion and cooked until it started to soften, then added the mushrooms and cooked until those had softened. Then added a crushed clove of garlic and cooked a minute or so more.  Turned off the heat (cast iron pan) and added the cream cheese.  Instead of pounding the chicken, just butterflied each breast (we had 3), then lightly sprinkled with season salt and ground pepper on the outside. After the mushroom mixture was ready, just folded each breast around that.  Did not mix the brown sugar/mustard; just spread a little mustard on top of each breast, LIGHTLY sprinkled with brown sugar, then coated with the walnuts.  Cast iron pan with all went in the oven for 20 minutes and we had a delicious dinner.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I made the filling with spinach, garlic powder, onion, cream cheese, and mushrooms, then used honey mustard instead of dijon, and topped with panko crumbs. It was amazing! I put it over rice and used the left over filling to top it (warmed, of course). Love!!

This was a great recipe, the chicken was so tender and moist with lots of different flavors going on with the cream and mushrooms inside the chicken, and the brown sugar/dijon mustard mixture with the walnuts. So good! My husband, two year old, and I loved it, and my five year old ate it but wasn't too thrilled with it. Three out of four isn't bad, at least not in my house! I couldn't get these rolled up very well so I ended up just folding the chicken over the filling, and it turned out great. I will be making these again sometime since the chicken turned out very well! Thanks for the recipe, Jenny.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic, it is replacing some of the lesser chicken recipes I have on file.  I flattened the chicken breast, added the cream cheese mixture then rolled them up and pinned them together with toothpicks. I then spread the dijon/brown sugar over the chicken and toppped with the walnuts.  Awesome!

This recipe was great--used a couple of the modifications suggested as well.  Added artichoke hearts and salt into the mushroom saute.  Also sprinkled parmesan cheese over the chicken prior to, and after, baking.  Had to cook the chicken for about 25 minutes.  Taste was unbelievable!

I made a variation of this and it was delicious! I used the cream cheese and the mushrooms, but instead of sugar and mustard (I wasn't looking for that particular flavor with the cream cheese), I used minced garlic, parsley and lemon. I also drizzled some hollondaise sauce over the top. I'm having the leftovers tonight. It was awesome.

This was great!  I added onions with the mushrooms and used a honey mustard dipping sauce instead of the dijon.  My hubby asked me to make it the next night again!  Definitely in our dinner rotation now.

I made this recipe scaled for two chicken breasts. I followed some of the modifications, adding garlic, using reduced fat cream cheese, using bread crumbs and not using brown sugar. It took an HOUR to cook! 15-20 minutes was not right for me. We did not care for this.

This was a hit in our house, though I agree with some reviewers that it was a big, goopy mess to make.  It's not the end of the world as long as my kids will give me 10 uninterrupted minutes to put everything together. I added garlic and onions to the mushrooms and cream cheese. I was a little short on cream cheese so I also threw in a couple Laughing Cow wedges. I also coated the chicken in Dijon mustard and a mixture of Italian and Panko bread crumbs. It was very tasty! Served with roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes. Perfect meal for my "meat-and-potatoes-or-nothing-at-all" family.

This is now one of my favorite chicken recipes. I didn't have any mushrooms so i subbed with broccoli and threw in a little parsley and chopped green pepper. I drizzled the extra Dijon brown sugar mix over the walnuts and sprinkled the chicken with shredded Parmesan cheese. All the different flavors pop out, I LOVE IT!

I followed Jenny's recipe by verbatim, and the results were exquisite. Moist and delicate on the inside, crispy, sweet, and "walnutty" outside! I wouldn't change a thing! ("He said as he spun the toothpick between his teeth").  I served it with Jan Stone's Feta Cheese Mashed Potatoes (Oh my!), and Denyse's Candied Carrots. For dessert, Paula Deen's Dark Rum Pecan Pie and ice cream. Thank goodness for a good metabolism! Happy Allreciping!

The sweet and sour from the sugar and mustard was a great combination. We ground the walnuts instead of chopping them and aded them to the mustard, sugar. It was awesome!!!

This recipe is super yummy and so easy to make!  The rolling part can get pretty messy though, but it is so worth a try!  We never have left overs everytime I cook this.  I added 6 cloves of garlic to the cream cheese mixture and cooked it longer; about 45 mins at 375.  YUM!!!

Very different, but good flavor.  Used less cream cheese but all the mushrooms.  The mustard/brown sugar mixture sounded different, but was quite a good flavor.  I cut that mixture way down, and just put it on top of the chicken rollups in the pan and sprinkle with crushed pecans.  I also sprinkled fresh grated parmesan on top. Rich, but good.

Oh my gosh! This was SOOOO good. The brown sugar and honey dijon mustard make such a great glaze. The cream cheese had a nice taste aslo. I'll definitely make again for sure! Make sure to leave out the nuts though. This adds extra calories and takes away from the flavor.

This recipe was ok.  I think it is a good base recipe though so I wasn't sure how to rate it.  I think the cream cheese mixture needed something besides the mushrooms.  I think that spinach, garlic and onions would be good.  I believe I read that in some of the other reviews too.  I did not use the nuts though, cause that seemed a little weird to me.  It did take a lot of time to prepare though.  I also had to cook twice as long as the recipe called for.  I will make this again, with some modifications, but it would really only be once in a while since it is very time consuming.  It would probably only be on the weekends too.  I also think I would make a double batch next time and freeze it to see how that works.  I love meals that I can freeze in individual containers and pull out in a crunch!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very delicious-an interesting mix of flavors. I sauteed minced garlic with the mushrooms and added fresh chives to the filling. I also used breadcrumbs instead of the chopped walnuts. The coating was sweet, but I thought it worked well with the other flavors. The whole family enjoyed. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was very good! Lacking a little flavor so I recommend adding a little salt and pepper as well as garlic to the mix. I also found it helpful to refridgerate the mixture before spreading it on the chicken breast!

This was pretty easy (I didn't include the nuts) and I thought the brown sugar/dijon combination was great.  I think the filling needs more flavor.  Next time I will try spinach, garlic, cheese, or lemon juice added to it.  Overall...very impressive and delicious!

This recipe was a huge hit at my house!  The only changes I made were to use margarine and neufchatel cheese to take the fat content down a bit, and to use chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  What a great combination of different tastes - Especially when served with a chicken-flavored rice pilaf.  THANKS JENNY!!!

Loved this!  I chose to roll in in almonds instead of walnuts.  My kids love it and guests too.  A fairly easy weeknight dinner.  Great leftovers too.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was fantastic, and my husband loved it as well. I used canned mushrooms, and spicy mustard instead of Dijon, and it was still very yummy. It took a while to make, and I had to just fold the chicken instead of rolling, but if you are willing to put in the time, it is definitely worth it!

This was fantastic. I thought all the portions were fine and the tastes were fine together. It's very messy to make. The hard part was folding the cream chees into the chicken, then having to somehow coat it in the sugar mixture and nuts. I had to dunk it in with both hands and try to hold it all together. The outcome is worth it, but can anyone suggest an easier way?

Oh my goddness! This is wonderful. I had a difficult time "rolling" the chicken breasts up so I just folded them so they looked like a triangle. I will be adding this recipe to my family's hall of favorites! Thanks!

I thought this was very good.  My husband thought it was a little too sweet, but I must admit I added a little bit more brown sugar.  It sure is messy.  I did have a problem rolling them up and keeping the stuffing mixture inside.  All in all I would make this again.

I am sorry to say I was disappointed with the results of this one. I agree with another reviewer that it was a big gooey mess by the time I was done and really impossible to handle. Maybe it was because my chicken breasts were huge. I probably should have cut them in half. If I try this again I will stick to the mushroom mixture (loved that) and leave out the mustard/brown sugar. It was too tangy for my me. I will definately find smaller chicken breasts next time.
