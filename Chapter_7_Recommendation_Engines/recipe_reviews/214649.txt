This cookie really is perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly, although I doubled it, because I tend to get fewer cookies out of a recipe than the yield says.  This recipe is right on, I got 8 dozen out of a double recipe, and I like bigger cookies!  The are very soft cookies, and the few that didn't get eating quickly lasted well.  The dough is very thick, but produces excellent cookies that have a similar taste to a brownie (only better!!)  Next time I plan to replace the reese's pieces with pieces of chopped up Ande's mints!!  I can't wait!!

Shortening in cookies always scares me, but I really liked it in this combination.  I used 1 c of white sugar and a T more of brown to help with the sweetness others said it missed.  I also increased the salt to 3/4 tsp.  I skipped the refigeration step, slightly pressing them down, and just put them straight in the oven for closer to 11-12 min.  These were great!  I found the mini-Reese's pieces at the store and this was the perfect recipe to use them in!  Just be careful not to cook them too long, the pieces will start to crack!

My boyfriend's favorite candy is Reeses Pieces, so this was at the top of my list to make for him.  Great cookies, very brownie-like.  Will make again.

Very good!  They stay soft and pillowy, like a nice chewy brownie.  I made the recipe as stated with no changes, but I did have to bake mine a few minutes longer, until they looked dry on top.  I topped with Christmas peanut butter M&Ms instead of Reeses' Pieces.

TIP: make sure to keep track of the time while these are baking since the dark dough doesn't let you easily figure out if they're done. I found that this recipe was easy to follow, and the cookies look great, but I am not a fan of the dough - despite all the sugar, I didn't find it to be very sweet. However, all the cookies will certainly be eaten, and it's a nice colour for fall/Halloween. I do not plan to make these again, as I wasn't too impressed with the taste, and the chocolate chips and Reese's Pieces cost a fair bit.

A good chocolaty taste. I switched out the candy and replaced with roasted peanuts. Tasty but not overly sweet (because the candy was gone!) Rolled them in sugar and that improved it to perfection. Next time will only add One cup of peanuts and increase white sugar to full cup if I want peanuts instead of candy.

Great cookies!  Rich choc flavor.  As others noted, the pnut butter flavor isn't very strong, so adjust to your preference.  I used self-rising flour instead of all-purp flour...so left out the salt and baking soda.  And came out fine!  You get a workout mixing the batter, which is good since you're going to eat alot of them once they are cooked.  ;-)  Will definitely make these again.  Will try Heath Brickle Bits or Peppermint Patties!  I doubled recipe as stated and worked great.  What I love is that recipe makes lots of DECENT sized cookies...not little quarter-sized ones.

These were quite tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it made about 40 cookies.  Days after being made, they were still soft and delicious.  Will definitely make these again.

Rather than peanut pieces, I used York peppermint pieces to make a mint chocolate cookie.  The chocolate cookie base is absolutely amazing.  Moist and wonderfully chocolatey.  You could use any candy in them and it would be fantastic I'm sure!

These are pretty good cookies. Easy to make, though they are not super sweet, nor do they have a strong peanut butter taste- which can be good or bad depending on what you are going for. Overall, a good cookie though! It would be fun to experiment with other candy bits.

AWSOME!!!! I loved the recipe I did not add any candies because I had none but extra chocolate chips makes it amazing. I only make this recipe when I make double chocolate chip cookies if dry add extra wet ingredients if wet add more flour I'll rate this five star??

I followed the recipe almost exactly (didn't measure the reese's pieces and chocolate chips). They are a little too sweet, but still very good. Will make them again with less sugar and use this as the base recipe for other chocolate cookies.

These were a surprise as I wasn't sure they'd come out. But they were great- not sweet but certainly tasty!
Instead of shortening I substituted butter and it was fantastic!
Will make again and thank you for sharing this recipe :)

Great recipe!  Only change I made was all butter (had no shortening) and less reese's pieces, more choc chips because I ate so many of the dang reese's pieces before hand.  Frack.  I was concerned while mixing the cookie, the dough was weirdly dry but they came out so good.  Soft for at least 40 hours (in tupperware) but all gone.  I got 36 big cookies out of the recipe and they looked beautiful with the colourful reese's pieces on top.    I also ate at least 2 cookies worth of batter, whoever said they didn't like the batter was nutzo - delish.

Delicious! I forgot to put the extra candies on the top after putting the cookies on the baking sheet, but I think it was fine without them. Probably would be great with them too. I will definitely be making these again.

These are really really good, and so easy to make! I don't have shortening, so I subbed all butter in with delicious results. Cook time of 9 minutes is right on in my oven-they come out soft and delicious.  My cookies didn't harden or get crunchy the next day, they stayed soft and moist.  I loved them!

These cookies were a huge hit in my house! I've tried a few different chocolate cookie recipes & this is the best I've found. I'm not a fan of thin flat cookies - these stay nice & poofy and are so tasty without being too sweet! I skipped the chocolate chips in favor of extra Reese's Pieces and they were perfect! I'll be making these on the regular!
