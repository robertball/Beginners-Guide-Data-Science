This was amazing!!! my boyfriend and i loved it i changed a few things, we dont eat onions or cottag cheese so i removed the two but replaced cottage cheese with ricotta cheese. it was to die for. i also put the chees mixture in a large baggie and but a little hole like a pastry bag, i HIGHLY recommend using that idea :)

Yummy! I have made this in the past and the recipe I had did not have egg in the shell mixture - that really helped them stay intact. I was just shy of the 2 cups of mozerella so I added a 1/2 cup of feta.  I also thought that there was going to be way too much sauce but continued to follow the recipe and it was just the right amount.  Our family thought this was "the bomb"! Thanks!

Somewhat dissapointing-too much spinach. Ricotta cheese would be better.

We loved it!  Did make a few changes.  I didn't have ingredients to make the sauce so I used store-bought and jazzed it up.  I also used fresh spinach and cooked it 2-3 min. in EVOO, chopped garlic and pinch of salt and pepper.  Did you know that if you want the nutritional value from spinach that you need to cook it?  In the end, I probably added less spinach than called for per suggestions of others.  I also topped with grated mozzeralla cheese and broiled last 2-3 minutes to brown.  This is now a favorite of ours.

What a fun Sunday afternoon project, but lots of dishes to wash!   Only 4 stars because the sauce was not quite flavorful enough for me. Added more oregano and basil then called for, then added dried thyme, 3 small bay leaves, whole fennel seeds and crushed red pepper. Also added fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce.   As far as the filling I saw the other reviews about too much spinach, so I thought I would reduce the cheese instead (trying to be kind of healthy here). Used only 15 oz container of part skim ricotta (about 1 3/4 cup) instead of the cottage cheese. I thought that worked really well, but I still ended up with about 1 1/2 cup extra. Gonna try baking the left over filling on a Boboli pizza crust, or wrapping in a tortilla and baking.  A tight fit, but I managed to stuff all 28 shells (why this number I wonder?) in my big lasagna pan. The sauce amount seems just right.  I made the sauce too thick on the stove top, forgetting it will still thicken more during baking. My fault not the recipes.  So, both the original and my tweaks get 4 stars because this was delicious but not perfect. It makes a ton so I hope this freezes well!

Great meal, makes PLENTY to freeze. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and only one pkg of spinach since it was all I had.

Loved this recipe. Just a few changes. added 1/2 lb. ground pork to hamb.,browned, drained and returned to large pan. Add to ham. mixture 1 cup onion's, 1/2 cup greenpepper's and 2 cloves garlic minced. when onions and pepper's are softened add 2 and 1/3 jars(24oz.)of premade sphagetti sauce.  saves alot of work and tasted great. otherwise did everything the same.  Hope you'll like it.  I did.

This was excellent. I made it for my in laws for dinner and there was nothing left of it. I did use store bought sauce and added mushrooms, black olives, bell pepper and onions. It was GREAT!

This recipe is awesome even my picky 5 year old likes it!  What a great comfort dish in the cold winter months.  I Only gave 4 stars because I have modified slightly.  I only use 15oz can of tomatoes, half of the spinach and instead of 3 cups of cottage cheese I do 2 cups and 1 of sour cream(makes it creamy).  For the seasoned salt I use Mrs. Dash.  Thanks for the recipes.

I was surprised at how much I liked this.  I added a little bit of sugar to sweeten the sauce a tad.  Also added Italian seasoning. Super easy!

Ooooh Sunny this was the bomb! I used extra meat sauce leftover from spaghetti last night to make this recipe. Here are some things I did differently: cut the recipe in half, used WallyWorld brand traditional sauce for the bottom of the pan because I wanted to save the meat sauce to pour over the top, used 1 egg white instead whole eggs, used Italian Seasoning blend plus basil, and used part-skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese, also important to mention that I always used a mix ground beef & turkey for my meat sauce- all of this just to lighten the guilt LOL. This will be going into my arsenal of go-to recipes- on my way to get just one more shell

I was making dinner for 4 people but I only made 3 servings because it seemed like other reviewers were having too much left over. There was still a ton left over! Other than that, this recipe was great.

I only used one 10 ounce package of spinach and 2 cups of cottage cheese cause that was all I had and it still turned out great. Will make again for sure.
