6.22.18  Very deep, intense strawberry flavor.  I enjoyed mine this morning over vanilla Greek yogurt.   FYI, they really cook down, so if you planning to serve over waffles or pancakes, for example, you may need to increase the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

WOW!  This was wonderful. I did use brown sugar instead of white since I that's what I learned growing up. My grandma's rule was never use white sugar with any strawberry dessert.  We had it over pound cake with a dollop of whipped cream.  It was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time. It does reduce in volume so you may want to double the recipe. I wish I had.  Try this you won't be sorry!
