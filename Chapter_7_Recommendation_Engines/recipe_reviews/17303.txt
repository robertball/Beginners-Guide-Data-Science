I have a recipe similar to this but used flour tortillas.. I baked my cresent rolls about 4 minutes under time. I included ro-tel & onion in my meat then taco seasoning. I layered mine as follows: rolls, white cheese dip,meat,ranch style beans, sour cream, mexican style cheese then nacho doritos. Last 3 minutes covered with foil so the chips would not burn.. Make sure you SPRAY your glass dish, I did mine in a 9x13.. MMMMM family LOVED it! Will make this again.

Despite the review by the self appointed food police, I found this dish to be quick and easy and very tasty. We are all adults here and we dont need to be reminded to check the trans fat and calories. Ratings like that ruin the purpose of the rating system. Great reciped! Thanks!!!!

My extended family loved this. I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9X13 pan. Used low-fat sour cream and Cheddar cheese, but added lowfat refried beans. Garnished with shredded lettuce, olives, diced tomatoes and a tiny bit of salsa and guacamole. Yummy! Made an excellent presentation with the extra color.Thanks for sharing Stephanie.

My husband and I loved this! I browned the beef last night, along with chopped onion, chopped jalapenos and the taco seasoning, which made today's preparation much quicker. After the crescent roll layer baked (I did mine in an 11x7 -had a few crescent rolls left over) I put the meat on, a layer of salsa, then black olives, then the sour cream (not a whole container - just enough to cover) then the cheese, followed by Doritos "Nacho Cheesier" chips (crumbled.)Served w/chopped tomatoes to top it with and the Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this website (along w/an asparagus dish)- EXCELLENT meal!

Very easy to make and quite yummy.  I took the advice of a pp and mixed the sour cream in with the taco meat and then baked it.  Also added some cheese to the baked crescent dough before adding the taco meat.  And I make my taco meat with Garden Style taco sauce instead of water.  Will be making this again!

I know I know I knooooow "You can't rate it when you changed the ingredients". I didn't omit any ingredients though, just added more things. So I'm rating this 5 stars FOR THE GREAT IDEA AND START TO A VERY VERSITILE RECIPE. Okay, now that that's out of the way. First, I doubled this recipe and put it in a greased 9x13 glass dish. I went w/ another reviewer and baked the dough about 4 min. less than what it called for since it will be cooking some more in the oven when it's all put together. DO NOT DO THAT. The crust was doughy and raw and soggy even after cooking the whole thing for 15 minutes at the temperature I used to cook the dough. Next time I will absolutely cook the dough ALL the way the WHOLE time it calls for. Now, I made the beef like I would normally make it for regular taco meat (add seasoning and simmer w/ water to get the consistancy). I also added 1/2 a chopped onion to the meat while it cooked. I layered it in this order: Dough/Crust, taco meat, 1 can refried beans & 1 16oz container sour cream mixed then spread on top of meat, 1/2 jar of salsa, 1 can of black beans, 1/2 bag of taco seasoned cheese & 1/2 bag of sharp cheddar, then the chips finally on top. Everything about thi was amazing minus my faulty error w/ the dough. You could always do this w/o the crust and just use for a taco dip. AMAZING recipe, thank you for the start of a great thing! This is so easy to omit and add items as you choose!

My family really enjoyed this recipe, from my 1 year old to my hubby. It was easy and delicious. A bonus is that I almost always have the ingredients on hand, so it is sure to be a quick dinner solution on a busy night. From start to finish it took less than 30 minutes to have the meal on the table, that is a major plus. The only suggestion that I would make is (and I should have been smart enough to figure it out)...spray the bottom of your pan with a vegetable spray. I used a glass 9 x 13 pan and thought that the crescent rolls would be buttery enough that they wouldn't stick...wrong. I garnished with the traditional taco toppings. This is a nice family recipe that was easy and enjoyed.

This was very quick and easy, which is a plus in my non-air conditioned apartment in the middle of summer.  This does need a little tweeking IMO.  Waaaay too salty for my liking between the taco seasoning and tortilla chips. Next time I will find salt-free ones.  Also, next time I will not completely cook my crecent rolls.  They got a little too browned after putting in the oven the 2nd time to melt the cheese.  I cooked mine without the sour cream as I'm not a huge fan unless it's in a dip.  I just don't enjoy the taste. I served it on the side with salsa.  Fiance said it was really good that way.  I do want to try this again, because I think this recipe really has potential.  thanks for sharing!

I love it! this is a great base recipe. I've had my own variation for years and never thought to use crescent rolls - what a unique idea. I do see where some might not like the though of a sweet roll in a savory dish - but I'm a little disappointed at the negative reviews. if you see a list of ingredients that doesnt appeal to you and dont make the dish - please dont review it. 2. If you see a list of ingredients that doesnt appeal to you and you make the dish knowing you're going to hate it - why bother? 3. If you don't like chips, or think something is too much - use less.  Each recipe is made for a particular taste. I happen to love this dish, I also know that I like my tacos a bit on the spicy side - so I add some spice! no harm in that, I'm making it to my family's taste. I also dont much care for too much salt in certain dishes (I am an admitted saltaholic) so, I used unsalted toasted corn tortilla's. It's really just common sense and its really just curtesy to rate/review. See the idea behind the recipe! then adjust! Having said that.. I love this on baked/toasted pita's too!!!! Thank you for posting the recipe!!!

I too omitted the sour cream because my boyfriend doesn't like it. I also used my own spices instead of prepackaged taco seasoning (cumin, chili powder and garlic powder) and covered the meat with water and simmered it down for a better consistency. I also put salsa over the meat when layering the ingredients.
It turned out great! Definitely a regular dish around our place now!

I mixed 2 Tbsp. of sour cream into 3/4 can of refried beans (instead of just the sour cream) and got thumbs up from each of my 11 & 12 year old children (aka "pickies")!  Hubby is out of town, he doesn't care tacos anyway.  This was a breeze to clean up!  Thanks Stephanie, my children loved it!!

My family has been making this recipe for years and is still one of our favorites.  I wanted to review to add a helpful hint we stumbled open: use the Philsbury Pizza Crust in lieu of the crescent rolls.  Much easier to deal with than the individual crescent rolls and the difference is not noticable.

This is a good one. I have also made it with an Italian flavor - ground beef or sausage,  onions, marinara, parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese.

Awesome recipe! I loved it and so did the kids - even the picky one! Here's what I did: I used a 9 x 13 glass dish. I sprayed it with cooking spray. Lined it with the crescent dough and went up the sides of the pan too. Baked this for 13 minutes. Cooked the meat and added one can of ro-tel mild and the taco seasoning. I could see using venison or ground turkey next time. The flavor with the ro-tel is what really came through. I only used 8oz of lite sour cream and even that was alot. Depending on how much you like s.c. you could cut back on it. I used 8oz of mexi-cheddar cheese - alot but perfect - gotta have the cheese! I used half a bag of nacho Cheese Doritos. I baked it another 10 minutes. I would recommend using at least a 9x13 pan. I'm not sure what size square cake pan was used by the lister of this recipe but I wouldn't be able to fit all of this in a 9inch square. EXCELLENT - 5 STARS - IT'S A KEEPER!! (can't wait for leftovers for lunch!)

Great recipe!! Tip: bake the cresent rolls at 375 for 11 or so minutes according to the package.  Then reduce the oven temp to 350 when you put the layered dish back in.  The rolls will not burn on the bottom this way.  Also, I prepared the meat just as I would have for tacos, water and all.  I added chopped onions and bell peppers, and a can of Rotel.  I also put a layer of refried beans as others suggested, and doubled up on the cheese.  I used crushed nacho flavored chips for the topping.  My kiddos and hubby loved it!

Well for starters I made this as written the first time and it was really pretty good but, I started to think of how it would work best for my family and be lower in fat. With my changes I make it twice a month now. I use reduced fat crescent rolls. Brown ground turkey throw in the taco packet and a can of tomatoes with green chilies. Layer that on top of the already baked crescent rolls. Then I throw in a drained can of both black beans and corn. Top with cheese then bake. Everyone in my house loves it and we don't even miss the sour cream (I'm not really a fan) or chips.

I love mexican food, but this recipe just didn't cut it for me. This is basically a remix of your standard boxed taco dinner kit with the addition of a cresent roll crust. That part was fine. The problem I had with this recipe is that it simply had TOO MUCH SOUR CREAM. Unfortunately the sour cream completely overpowered what would have otherwise been a pleasant twist on a simple taco dinner. My advice: cut the sour cream down to about 4oz and don't use an entire bag of corn chips. Simply crush enough to lightly cover everything. As for the cheese, there's no such thing as too much cheese, so don't change that at all. Simply put, I probably won't be making this again when I can get plenty of satisfaction from a boxed taco dinner kit.

five star-I also mix in a can of "traditional" style refried beans with 1/3 cup of pace mild picante sauce and spread that layer first on pie shell before beef mixture. I add tortilla crumbles after beef mix then follow this recipee but top with cheese finely chopped black olives, mushrooms, sour cream, guacamole and pica de gallo. Just a spoon of each is perfect.

One word.....WINNER!!!  My family loves my version of this recipe!  Great idea!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and added taco seasoning, rotel, and red onion to the meat mixture while I was browning my crescent rolls.  After both were ready, I added low-fat sour cream to the already cooked meat then poured meat mixture onto the dough.  Topped with cheese and crushed tortilla chips and put in the oven for about 10 more minutes.  We topped with shredded lettuce, fresh diced tomatoes and salsa.  Yumm-yumm-yummy!!!
Next time I am considering layering my meat mixture with black beans or perhaps pinto beans and then topping with the cheese & chips.  We'll see how it turns out!  I'll be eating it either way!  This one's a keeper for me!

It was a good alternative to regular tacos.  Next time I wouldn't cook it with the sour cream added, I would top it with it after baking.  I did add a layer of medium salsa.

I followed a few of the suggestions- first layer the cooked cresent rolls, then black refried beans, then the meat mixure (I had added onion, garlic and corn to the meat), followed with sour cream, mexican cheese and crumbled nacho cheese Dorito's on top.  I think the Dorito's offset the "sweetness" of the cresent rolls.  I was concerned about this recipe but.... MY FAMILY LOVED IT!  Definitely want it added to the rotation.  Thanks everyone for the suggestions.

SUPER DELISH!! My boyfriend and I loved this. I cooked crescent rolls almost all the way. Layered refried beans, sour cream, corn, taco meat, and tons of mexican cheese. Baked for another 10 minutes and then topped with Fritos!! It was awesome!! Will be making again very soon!!

My family loves this. Instead of the sour cream, I poured enchilada sauce over top of the meat and crust. I doubled the recipe in an 11x15 pan and it's the perfect size to eat for several meals during our busy week.

I have dinner at my house on Saturdays for a bunch of guys and am always trying to come up with stuff that will fill them up but not take me all day to make.  This recipe fit the bill.   I used packages of crecent rolls in the bottom of a 13x9 pan, and about 1.5lbs of ground beef.  I also added a refried bean, and salsa layer.  The guys LOVED this.  It's also good cold, who knew? :D

My fiancee and I love, love, love this recipe. I make it all the time and it always goes fast. We add a little salsa for some extra flavor and sometimes extra meat. The cresents give it a good flavor. I had something like this a long time ago and could never find it. Its so easy and delicious!

Delicious! I made it in a 9x13 pan because I felt confident that the pan size was wrong. It worked beautifully using the full sheet crescent roll dough.

Very good dish, not clear directions.  I used a 7x7 square glass dish. I didn't know if that was too small or large.  I used the dough on the bottom and cut strips for the sides of the dish so it would be a pie crust with sides. Instructions didn't say any of this.  I added some butter to the rolls before baking, too.  I added chunky tomatos with lime juice and cilantro to the hamburger midway thru cooking with the taco seasoning.  layered the chips twice. From the canned tomatos, there was alot of juice and I omitted it when I put it in the dish.  I should have added some because I would have liked it to be a little more moist, so if you use the tomatoes you can decide.  The tomatos came with the lime juice and cilantro btw.  I think because I used 2 layers of chips, that also made it a little dry. But it wasn't badly dry. Again, very good, but the directions do leave you asking some questions.  I think.

I made this last night, and it was very good. The fact that it feeds "8"?  No. Maybe 8 gnomes, but not 8 people. Double the recipe if you are feeding a family 4 who eats normal portions. Also, I wouldn't let the biscuit dough bake the full amt of time because when it goes back into the oven, it will become hard on the bottom making it diff to get out of the pan. I diced up 2 small tomatoes and sprinkled them in with the meat. I also skipped the taco seasoning and opted for my own spices, which were nice. Adobo, cumin, paprika, chili flakes, garlic powder. It also kicked up the heat a bit, which we like. I skipped the entire container of sour cream and only used maybe 3/4 cup. I think it is necessary though because the meat mix might become dry, but you certainly don't need an entire container of it. Overall, a very good, easy and fast recipe that pleased all who ate it. Next time I will double it though.

I made this yesterday but I used a pillsbury dough sheet. When it was done, i put a dollop of sour cream on top, and sliced some cherry tomatoes. I laid three of them flat into the sour cream like garnishes, and it was wonderful! This is definitely a fast, easy 5 star meal!

My family loved it!  Here's how I layered it starting at the bottom:  crescent rolls in a 9 x 13 for 8 min., ground turkey browned with onions, taco seasoning, and a little bit of water, salsa, light sour cream (less than the 16 oz.), Mexican cheese, tortilla chips.  Excellent and so easy.  Next time- I will use fat free refried beans and less sour cream.  Yum.

My hubby really liked this. I made it with low carb tortillas on the bottom (did not pre cook), 93% lean ground beef, 2% cheese and fat free sour cream. It was a hit at my house for my picky eater! (Not my kids, my husband!)

We thought this was great.. a good alternative to boring tacos. I did add a can of corn, rotel tomatoes, and kidney beans. I also used 1 1/2 lbs of hamburger and almost 2 packets of taco seasoning. This recipe is quick, easy, and tastes great!

Really good.  All of these things are a nice combination.  I recommend topping with lettuce and tomatoe.  Honestly, it even warms up nicely for leftovers.  The chips get a little soft on the secong round but not too bad.  I will for sure make this again.

I made this tonight b/c I was wanting something different from my usual Mexican casserole (which uses tortillas) and I was not disappointed!  I added a can of rotel and black beans to the meat, and mixed the sour cream in, and we really liked it.  Next time I might try a layer of crescent rolls on the top too, instead of chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love how people give negative reviews based on nutritional value. Poor choice. I make very well balanced, healthy meals for my family, but don't avoid something like this based on nutritional value. This is a great fun meal to make, especially when kids are having friends over. Thanks and will make again!

I added a layer of refried beans, a layer of corn, the taco meat mixture, tomatoes with green chilesand then half the amount of sour cream and cheddar cheese. It was good. Not necessarily something I would want every week though.

My husband LOVES this recipe! I did make a couple changes though, the recipe is SUPER adaptable to your tastes. I don't use the chips or the sour cream in the actual pie, the chips make it too salty for my taste and I'm not a fan of warm sour cream - makes a great side dish with some lettuce and extra salsa. I also add some white rice into the beef/taco seasoning. I put a layer of crescent rolls in the bottom of a greased 9X13 pan, a layer of cheese, layer of beef/rice, layer of salsa, a little more cheese and then another layer of crescent rolls. Not the healthiest dinner ever, but it's great comfort food!

This is a quick and easy recipe and each time I prepare this dish I get great reviews. It is important to read the nutitional information and customize the dish to fit each persons specific dietary needs. I use white corn tortilla chips, use 90% fat free ground beef or ground turkey, low fat or fat free cheese and sour cream and I do not use the taco seasoning in the package I make my own with fresh garlic and onion, chile powder I even use Hungarian paprika a little black pepper and very little salt. Top with tomatoes and lettuce. Low fat does not mean no taste.

I have made this many times now, and find that it is very easy and can be modifed to use whatever I have in the cupboard.  I have added a can of Rotel cilantro and lime tomatoes, or a layer of salsa.  I add a can of black beans if I have them.  I also sprinkle a few black olives if on hand.  I have made with turkey instead of ground beef.  I have used a recipe for taco seasoning when I need it from this site..This recipe is very forgiving and my family always loves it, whatever combination of ingredients I use.  The crescent rolls make this the best taco pie recipe.  Thank you! 8/23/15  Update, made with cooked chicken, was great!  Still making this recipe regularly, family loves it. 11/06/17  Still making this, tonight I added warmed refried beans as the first layer.

My husband and I really liked this. You could substitute Italian ingredients like pasta sauce in the meat mix and use ricotta cheese instead of sour cream for an Italian theme. Great possibilities. I also used an 11x7 pan as another reviewer suggested but I would spray lightly w/spray oil as mine seemed to stick a little. Used shredded cheddar and slice ripe olives on top. Also spread a can of fat-free refried beans over crust before adding meat mixture. YUM!

Kids love it!! We always add the extra toppings (lettuce, tomato, black olives etc.) We also like using"Top the Tater" sour cream, a sour cream with chives for extra flavor.

First and foremost, all respect to the poster of the recipe! I see recipes as a 'starting-point' and then add/delete things that I know my family will like. I have little patience for people who give a negative review because they didn't like the original recipe... That being said: My family lives by the mantra of 'the spicier, the better'! So I added to the ground beef mix: 2 oz taco seasoning (swear by 'Tone's) which is sold at Sam's Club), 1 diced onion, 2 tbs. cayenne pepper, 2 tbs. chili pepper, 1 tbs. minced garlic, 1 tbs. garlic powder, 1/2 handful (or so) of pickled jalepeno (minced) & 1/2 c. of Pace hot picante sauce. I followed the directions for the crescent rolls (but in a 9x13 dish), then layered 1/2 meat, 1 can of pinto beans and the rest of the meat... my family doesn't care for sour cream, so I ommited that all together. Then I topped with a heavy sprinkle of additional chili powder, salt and pepper. Topped with cheddar and tortilla chips. Covered with foil for 25 minutes them removed the foil and backed for an additional 10 minutes. Served with refried beans and mexican rice. We were all having to drink milk to combat the heat, but I (you, poster) have been praised to the extreme! I have been told by me two daughters (age 14 & 17) as well as my husband that if I don't make this at least twice a month, they will move out.... but come to think of it... WOULD that be such a bad thing? :) Kudos to you again for the idea!!!

Made this today ... but the next time I will for sure only use about half of the sour cream and I will add a cup or more of salsa on top of the ground beef before adding the sour cream.  This was an easy, tasty recipe and I will make it again with those two changes.  I read where others added salsa and less sour cream but wanted to taste this as it was printed before making changes.  I was not able to use the whole bag of crushed chips because it was way too much so only used about two thirds of the bag.

I've been making this for years, I prefer to use doritos as my tortilla chips and a sprinkling of them at the bottom with the cheese over the crescent rolls.  All my friends love Taco Pie!

Instead of crescent rolls to line the bottom, I use quick cook polenta. Corn meal and water is the same Dunns River brand works well. topped with the other goodies, it's very yummy.

Loved this super easy and quick dinner! I added corn 
(off the cob), diced tomatoes, pinto and black beans, fresh red onion (chopped) and didn't include the sour cream in the layering, preferring to let each person add it as a topping if they so desired. This was a big hit at the dinner table! Add lettuce, salsa, hot sauce, guacamole, or whatever traditional taco toppings you like! DELISH!!

Very good.  I tweaked it just a little and added 8-10 oz of salsa spread over the meat filling.  Layered on top of that 8 oz of Sour Cream, then 2 cups of Mexican cheese and topped with crushed tortilla chips to suit.  :)  Definetly will be a repeat at our house!!  :)

Very good!  I made this exactly according to the recipe but I think next time I would add some salsa just to give it a little more kick.  It was a hit with my family.

Great starter recipe!  I added mexican corn (strained) and black beans (rinsed and strained) to the hamburger after it was browned with the onions.  I also added some white melted mexican cheese and salsa to the meat mixture. Then after putting meat mixture over the crescent rolls I sprinkled with cheese then added chips.  Next time I will put the cheese on TOP of the chips.  Served with sourcream and salsa on the side!  YUMM!! My kids loved it too!

I made this for my husband and I last night for the first time and LOVED IT! It was quick and easy, but my husband was totally impressed. The only change I might make next time is to mix some salsa in with the sour cream for a little more zest!

I will definitely make this again. However, I will add corn and some salsa to the meat before putting it together. It needed a little umph.

The nutritional facts are devastating for this dish...until you realize you can use all reduced calorie ingredients without sacrificing any flavor!!! My family has been making this for years, and it is absolutely one of my favorites! Use reduced fat crescent rolls and cheese, ground turkey, light sour cream, add veggies (my favorites are grape tomatoes, lettuce, onion, and green pepper), and top with any of the variety of reduced-calorie tortilla chips that are available at grocery stores these days! In minutes, you've got a lower-calorie, delicious meal! Love it!!

I had to serve the sour cream on the side because of a picky eater and also had guacamole on the side as well.  I added a layer of refried beans and some salsa to it the dish.  I baked it in a 9x9 dish next time I will try a 9x13 and use 1 ½ lb of beef since I will be using the larger dish.  There was a lot of dough left and I think it will fit a 9x13 well.  Very good, quick dinner.  Will be making again.

This was a good 30 minute meal.  I liked it and so did my two year old daughter.  I think next time I will make with cornbread sticks rather than the crescent rolls.  I also added some black olives and salsa.  I was a little nervous about adding the chips on top and didn't add the whole bag, but it turned out great.

This actually was really good with a few minor adjustments. I added onion with my hamburger while frying.Also put Picante Sauce on top of sour cream before baking.This recipe doesn't need all the chips unless you like that many (used nacho cheese doritos).I chopped extra onion and also chopped some tomatoes,black olives and lettuce and had that on the side. I don't think those condiments should be put on top of the pie but left on the side for warming up leftover purposes. My husband said this was really good!! People should note that you can use your imagination and add anything you want according to your taste but this is a good base to work with!!

We loved this and my husband has already requested it again...I changed mine just a bit.. I was able to stretch out the crescents into a 9 x 13 pan..then I topped that with about 1/2 cup of salsa, then the meat, chopped green onions, olives, sour cream (only used half the amount it asked for), 2 cups crushed chips (didnt use a whole bag), and then the cheese (mix of mozarella and cheddar) on top...It was delicious!!! I like it a little spicier so I topped mine with jalapeno slices and topped my husbands with shreded lettuce and tomatoes...mmmmmmmm... Kiki (Brampton,ON, Canada)

When you are in the mood for something different, try this. I was very surprised... easy and delish! Mixed taco seasoning (my own) and rotel in the meat mixture and as others suggested added the sour cream to the meat mixture as well. I also added a layer of refried beans, next time i will add black beans to the meat mixture. I put freshed sliced jalopenos on top of the pie - looked pretty with the cheese and chips. Thanks for the recipe Stephanie!  This is going in my rotation. 2/23/16 UPDATE: Have made many times we find we like Fritos as a topping... I also add a layer refried beans mixed with salsa over the cresent rolls.. meat mixture with taco seasoning, (save the sour cream for topping)... cheese and fritos... YUM! you can add shredded lettuce, sour cream and tomatoes!

Holy moly this was GOOD!  The whole family liked it!!  I used probly 1 and 1/2 pounds ground beef, and 1 1/2 pkgs taco seasoning and added 3/4 c water (I think the submitter forgot the water?).  Used a slightly bigger baking dish and still had enough crescent dough. I added sliced black olives (probly 1/2c to 3/4 c) to the cooked and taco seasoned meat, colby jack cheese and I used corn chips instead of nacho chips (adding some to the top of the meat before the sour cream layer too. I served shredded lettuce, diced grape tomatoes and extra chopped black olives on the side. Next time I will double the recipe and use a 13x9 pan, cooking a little longer to compensate. My family demands a bigger one... FANTASTIC!!!

We loved this.   I made 2 square pans and split the crescent rolls between the 2 since I didn't see the point in using the whole thing in a small pan.   I used lean ground turkey and put in my food processor since we like our taco meat ground.   Recipe didn't call for water with the taco seasoning. But I added a small amount.   Layered sliced olives, salsa sour cream then the cheese.   Made guacamole and served with lettuce and tomatoes.   Now I have an entire second casserole for another meal this week.

I have made this recipe many times with several different variations and it always comes out delicious. This recipe is very versatile and easy to make. I have made it with beef or chicken depending on what I had available. If you wish to use low fat/no fat ingredients then do  as they work well. I always use low fat sour cream and low fat cheese. I usually add black beans, corn, onions and guacamole to my pie. I only gave it four stars  because I feel the ingredients are a little sparse as written. Add what you like or make as written--either way it is good. A quick, yummy, family pleaser!

My entire family loves this. I've updated this recipe with a few extras. On top of the crescent rolls we add a layer of refried beans. We also mix mexican corn in with the hamburger meat. Top it with lettuce and tomatoes. So delicious!

Great base recipe.  I made a few changes based on reviews I read.  I skipped the crescent rolls and went with a "casserole" instead of a "pie" .  I added a can of diced jalepeno peppers to the ground beef while browning and added a can of rotel to the mixture after adding the taco sauce. I layered the meat mixture,shredded cheese and crushed doritos and baked until cheese was melted.  Then when I served it I put it on a bed of fresh lettuce, topped with sour cream and black olives .  The family LOVED this recipe!  Next time I think I'll add some black beans for extra fiber. Definitly a keeper!!

Lined the bottom & sides of a greased 9x9 baking dish with the crescent rolls. Used about half the sour cream called for (I think 16 oz would have overwhelmed the other flavors), left off the chips entirely (because I didn't have them) and added in a can of chili beans to the meat mixture. Topped it off with extra cheese and a bit of ground chili pepper for color & a little kick. Served with salsa & garnished with lettuce and black olives. Thanks for a versatile recipe!

Thw whole family really enjoyed this recipe. The only reason that this wasnt a five star is I thought the crescent roll dough was a tad sweet for the recipe. Make sure that you use the Nacho Cheese chips for the topping, they were the star of the show. We served this with the traditional taco toppings.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because I didn't much care for the bread bottom. I added black beans and corn. Cooked some garlic and japs. in the meat mixture too. It was still tasty even though it wasn't my cup of tea.

This dish was okay. What I would do different next time: Not use the crescent rolls dough (added sweetness, not cool), not use the recommended amount of sour cream and seasoned my beef a little more than what the taco seasoning offers. The taste of the beef got lost in the gobs of sour cream and sweetness of the bottom crust. Sorry, just being honest.

Instead of putting sour cream in the oven our family tops it with sour cream and salsa when it's out of the oven.  We also love to top it with Doritos instead of plain tortilla chilps. Our family of 16 begs me to make this~ It's a favorite.

Very quick and yummy! Instead of using all the sour cream I add just a 1/2 cup to the meat and topped with extra sour cream on plate. This is definitely going to be one of my go to dishes!

My husband loved it... I guess it just wasn't for me!  The crescent rolls were soggy from the "taco" being on top and the oven made the tortilla chips stale tasting.  I'll give this recipe one more try and see if I can somehow tweek it to my liking!

Good and easy. I added a layer of refried beans and only enough sour cream to cover because we wanted to add some at the table. I  followed others suggestions of not precooking the rolls completely, but the end result was a little gooey. Next time I will cook them completely before adding the other layers.

I followed the recipe except I added a little pepper jack to spice it up. It is definitely not a low fat meal, but anyone with common sense would know that before making it. So there shouldn't be any need to scold the submitter.

We all enjoyed it as written, but it would also be very good with extra ingredients like refried beans, onions, green peppers, black olives, etc.  I baked rolls as written, did not have any issue with doughy.  I added water to the taco seasoning and let that cook down a bit.  I had lettuce and salsa for toppings.  Everyone enjoyed it.  This is an edit. I just came home from spending $165 for one week of groceries so I thought by not adding all the extras to recipes, I could save money.  So the only thing extra I added, was a can of diced tomatoes to my hamburger, that already had green peppers and onions in it. Oh, my hamburger was about 1.5lbs. I only really needed half the cheese and half the chips.  My cost for this dish was $11.14 before tax. I would say we had 6 LARGE servings, so 1.86 per serving.  Not too shabby.

I love this recipe because it's quick and versatile and you can make it a whole lot healthier, very easily. I used reduced fat crescent rolls, and substituted ground turkey for beef. I used light cheddar cheese (p.s. you don't need the entire bag - just enough to spread on top). And instead of adding an entire layer of sour cream, I just put a dollop on top of each piece after serving.  I also added a layer of salsa (after the turkey) which gave it a little kick.  Delicious! next time I'll try adding a layer of low fat refried beans. Oh and one thing the recipe does not mention is to spray your baking pan with cooking spray (duh - simple thing, but I forgot and mine stuck to the pan) :)

I made this for my mom and dad early on Wednesday, refrigerated it overnight before baking, popped it in the oven while they were at work on Thurs for about 30 min at 350, and they both loved it. I was upstairs studying and my mom called down "Jes! Come here for a minute" and she asked me if I'd make it for her next week to take in to her work potluck! They were quite impressed. I did make a few slight alterations. I baked the pillsbury pastry for 10 min at 350. Then, I browned the beef with green, red, & yellow peppers + diced onion, drained it, added taco seasoning and two big scoops of helluva dip, mixed that all together, tossed it into the 9 x 9 pan with the pastry on the bottom, put a very thin layer of helluva dip on top, crushed nacho chips and covered, put on some cheese and voila. They're big helluva dip fans so that could be why they enjoyed it so much! lol

I used light sour cream, 2% cheddar, and added sliced grape tomatoes and black olives on top. This was very good. My husband devoured it and my kids liked it, too. Not sure how I was supposed to layer the sour cream/ cheese. Was it supposed to be mixed, sour cream on top & then cheese, or cheese then sour cream? Not sure if it makes a difference. I put the sour cream on first, then the cheese, then the chips. BTW, 14 oz bag is probably too much. I used about half a 17 oz bag and it was plenty.

This has been a favorite of mine since I was little.  It also is very good with shredded chicken or ground turkey. Lowers the fat!! and is better on your stomach. I mix the sour cream in with the meat. My boyfriend also hates sour cream but I use only a few scoops and he doesn't even know. Also saute some onions with the meat and top with Cheese Doritos!!! Lettuce, avocado and salsa mmmmmmmmmmm

The "square" cake pan seemed to be too small.  I used a 9X9.  Maybe the recipe really means a "rectangular" 9X13 pan.

Great flavor! Good idea to cook the creasant rolls 4 minutes less than actual time. I spread the dough right around the edge of the pan for side crust as well. A nice change...I put some chopped steak  in a crock pot and cooked it with the taco seasoning and a 2/3 cup of water for 4 hours on high or 8 on low. I don't care for ground beef, so the meat is tender and tasty in the pie.  You can use lean meat, f.f sour cream, f.f refried beans, low fat cheese and their are even light crescent rolls out there. It tastes just as good!

I would rate this recipe a 4 for ease of preparation and 3+ for taste, but since my 9 year old fussy eater thought it was amazing I am rating it up to a 4.  I kept it simple and didn't add any extra vegetables but in the future to make it a bit healthier I think I will try making it with pizza dough, and add tomatoes, onions, olives and green peppers and hot peppers.  I will chop them small and put them underneath the cheese so my 9 year old doesn't freak out :)

I made this again using pizza dough instead of the crescent dough.  I also use fat free cream cheese and lean ground beef fried without oil.  It was even better than when using crescent dough and a LOT less fattening.  I use this dish as a portable dinner (I let it cool and take it in the baking dish precut...it holds together surprisingly well) when I have to take my children directly to activities after school.  I pack paper plates, plastic forks and knives, juice packs, raw carrots and dip....and off I go.  The kids can eat in the van or at the activity site....and we AVOID drive through.

i am reviewing after 6 years. i agree with earlier reviews that this recipe contains some not so nutritional ingredients. i think though that people know when seeing the name "taco pie" that it's not something to eat every week. but it's a personal decision. you can use low fat variations but cresent rolls will always have trans fat. we eat this as a once a year treat. the kids love it! so for flavor i give it 4 stars!

I made this recipe last night and everyone in my family loved it.  My daughter's boyfriend had two helpings and they came back later after going out and warmed up leftovers!  I will fix this again!  I didn't add the sour cream, though.  We added it after it finished baking.

This recipe was soooo delicious!!  I double the recipe and plan on having some great left overs.  Next time I think I'll add more cheese (I'm a cheese fan!) and maybe add refried beans and guacomole.  It was so easy to make too!

Love, love, love this! So easy. I followed the instructions with a few tweaks. Definitely grease your pan before the crescent told go in!! I sauteed peppers and onions too add to the beef mixture and added 1 can of El Paso Traditional refried beans as a layer above the beef and then the sour cream(only half the container) then 1 package of shredded taco cheese. I didn't have tortilla chips on hand, so I used Doritos...just as good :-) so easy, my husband is obsessed with it!

I've been making this dish for years.  Always a hit.  The changes I've made over the years is instead of using a cake plate or pie plate I use a cookie sheet.  Basically rolling the crescent rolls out to about 9x13 size (easier now if by using the sheet rolls). Lightly covering the dough with crushed corn chips rather than tortilla chips (more flavor);top with the meat mix; then covering the meat mix with sour cream; top with more crushed corn chips; then adding the grated cheddar cheese.  Bake at 375 for about 20-25 minutes. By making it this way, it's easier to eat and the recipe stretches a little farther. I've also added a small can of sliced black olives.  Enjoy!!

Made this tonight.  Based on previous reviews, we were excited .  However, we found it to be quite dry and bland.  Way too many crushed tortilla chips and the crust, crescent rolls, turned out dry in the end.  The crescent rolls turned out to be strange as a crust.  The only thing good to eat was the beef, which I seasoned myself.  We ended up throwing the large amount left over away, because neither of us wanted it for leftovers.

Amazing! This recipe is easy to make and really delicious! My family devoured their plates and asked for seconds! The only things I did differently was I added a little sauteed onion and garlic to the beef mixture and I also didn't use as much sour cream. I used Doritos for the cruncy topping and it was wonderful! Also, make sure you coat the bottom of the pan with a good layer of baking spray, otherwise the crescent rolls will stick.

This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review on this site and have often said I wouldn't give 5 stars to something that needed tweaking. I read many, many reviews and incorporated the following changes: cooked diced onion with the meat, used Taco Seasoning I from this site instead of store bought taco seasoning, cut the sour cream by 1/2 and mixed it with a can of refried beans, added a layer of taco sauce and used Fritos since I didn't have tortilla chips. Outstanding is the word that describes this dish. My husband, who puts Tabasco on everything, ate it as is and kept making these mm-mm-mm noises. He told me not to change a thing. SUPERB!

I made the pie and really enjoyed it! I picked this option because I knew it was something my son would eat. The ONLY thing I would change is I would leave the crescent rolls out altogether. It's not needed and adds a "bread like" taste to it. I followed the advice of others here and added some lettuce and tomato and it came out great!

Made this for dinner tonight. My 5 year old said she didn't like it...she loved it. It was also a hit with my husband. I did add a can of ranch style beans, a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes, and a (drained) can of corn to the meat mixture. I had to let the meat mixture cook down some because of the liquid from the tomatoes and ranch style beans but the extra time it took was worth it. This is a good quick fix meal for those nights when we don't have a lot of time to cook.

This recipe is great...I did a little doctoring that made it a big hit with my husband.  The thing that I changed is I heat up the sour cream on the stove, add a can of green chilies, and one vegetable boiloun cube, and then just layer it as normal

Fixed this last night. I doubled the recipe, put in a can of black beans and a can of corn. Had a complete meal in one dish. Instead of tortilla cips, I topped the casserole with crushed Doritos. Absolutely delicious!!

I will not be making this recipe again for the following reasons:  1.  sour cream is the overwhelming flavor in this dish - way too much.  2.  The crescent rolls made for a very gummy crust. and 3. very little flavor.  Possible suggestions - no crust, more meat, no sour cream.  Add 1 or 2 cans of green chilis over meat.  Top with cheese.  Cook in oven long enough to melt cheese.  Use salsa on the side.

This was delicious!  I used premade pizza dough instead of crescent rolls so that there was no seperation on the bottom.  Put refried beans on that and topped with cheese.  I used nacho cheese Doritos in place of tortilla chips.  We toppped with lettuce, tomato, salsa and more sour cream on our plates. I will definitely be making this dish again!

This is a regular meal at our house.  All of my kids friends request this when they come over.  Sometimes I leave off the tortilla chips and it is still just as good either way.  Very easy to make and oh so good!

This is a delicious and easy recipe to make. I made some additions that turned out to be very tasty. I put chili sauce in the taco meat which gives it a sweeter flavor. When I layered everything, I put 1 can of refried beans, then the taco meat, then sauteed onions and green bell peppers, then cheese, and then the chips and cheese on the top. When serving it, we had corn on the side which is actually very good mixed into the dish. We also had salsa and sour cream. Overall, I'd call this a successful meal!

Overall this is a good idea, but we found this recipe to be a bit dry and bland. Too many bready type ingredients and not enough moist ingredients. If we try this recipe again I'm going to add a small jar of salsa to the meat and not fully cook the crescents before putting the meat on to keep the bread a bit more doughy and moist.

This was a big hit in my family. Roll out Pillsbury Grands Biscuits for crust.  Add 2 cans Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup and smashed Fritos to the meat mixture after simmering meat and taco seasoning.  Warm refried beans while crust is baking.  Layer beans, then meat mixture, shredded cheese, smashed Fritos.  Garnish with lettuce, tomato and salsa. YUM!

Needs adjustment.  Does not fit in square dish - use 9x13.  Baking should be done at 375.  Add your own ingredients.

Messy, not sure how to eat it. Only adjustment I made is I added canned diced tomatoes. My suggestion is do no crescent roll and make as a dip to dip the chips in.

We love this recipe.  I made a few changes.  I added Rotel tomates with chilis; also added beans to the ground beef mixture.  I mixed bottled taco sauce and Catalina dressing (equal amounts) and served it for each person to spoon over casserole...Delish! Served chopped lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced black olives, sliced jalapenos and extra sour cream on the side. We will have this again and again! Thanks for sharing Stephanie!

This is a great base recipe. You can add just about anything to it that you like on tacos. Instead of using a square cake dish I used a 13 x 9 pan and I was able to get all the ingredients in the pan.

Good, but I use 2 packs of crescent rolls and line a 13x9x2" pan with one pack, top that with the taco meat cooked per pkg. directions, top that with the cheese, and top that with the second pkg of cresent rolls, bake 25 min. I put the sourcream, shredded lettuce and chopped tomato on top of baked crust. This way you get twice as much dinner for the same amount of meat.

I have made this recipe several times, but have changed it alot. I cook it in a pie dish and crunch up the taco chips right on top of the cresent rolls. I don't bake the rolls. I add the meat with the seasoning and I add onions while I am cooking the beef. After I put the meat on top of the crust/chips I layer on more crunched up chips. then I add a whole layer of sour cream and top it off with the cheese. I bake it in the over at 350 for at least 30 minutes. You have to keep checking to make sure the crust is done on the bottom. I let it sit about 10 minutes, then I garnish it with lettuce, tomato and black olives. Serve with a side of salsa. My family LOVES it.

I followed the directions, but I even added salsa to the meat while it cooked. I also added a layer of black beans. I think there was way too much sour cream for this dish. I will try this again and revise some, but I will leave out the sour cream and just garnish with it when serving.

Thanks for sharing this quick and easy recipe.  My family loved it!  I left out the sour cream like other readers and it still tasted great.

I liked this recipe a lot because it was easy to make, quick and tasty.  My whole family liked it very much.  I added salsa before the meat.  I added more sour cream on top of the crushed tortilla chips.  On top of that I added sliced tomato and cheese. I would make this again.

LOVED this recipe! The only thing i did differently was i spread sour cream on the baked crescent rolls before adding the meat. I also added in diced onions, bell peppers, jalapenos, tomatoes and fresh garlic into the ground beef mixture. Then continued on with more sour cream on top of the meat and added cheese. I think next time around i'll add some red enchilada sauce than the cheese to give it more of a zesty flavoring.   Over all this dish was wonderful! No leftovers! Family loved it that much!

The whole family loved this one!  I did make some changes based on previous feedback ... I put this in a 9 x 13 pan, used two rolls of the crescent roll dough (pushed up the sides to form more of a pie) and doubled the meat ingredients.  I added a can of mild rotel to the meat and served the sour cream on the side vs. putting directly in the pie.  Next time I will leave out the chips on top - we didn't care for them.

The crescent rolls at the bottom were very tasteless, soggy and just didn't go together with everything. I wish I would have just put chips on the bottom. Think about it.. would you eat nachos on top of a bisquick? Well that's pretty much what this recipe is.

Very Good!  Made in a 9in square pan.  Added salsa, a can of black beans, chopped tomatoes and olives.  And I used nothing but Monterrey Jack Cheese.  Very Good!  Will definitely make again!

Really good! I would have taken a pic, but we gobbled it down! The only thing I did diferent was pre-bake the cresent dough and add some salsa to the meat mix.
Definately adding this one to the rotation!

This is a great and quick casserole!  I used half the chips (I felt an entire bag was too much) and added Rotel diced tomatoes w/ peppers and Pinto beans.  I also used half a container of sour cream, but after eating it, I thought it could use more.  Will def. make again!

Very tasty.  I used all low fat ingredients.  A square cake pan is way to small for this recipe.  I used a 13x9 pan and it all fit fine.  14.5 oz. of tortilla chips is also way too much.  About 4 oz would be plenty.  This could benefit from some chopped tomatoes on top.  My husband enjoyed this so I'll definitely make this again!

Wow, this was a really tasty and fast meal.  I also was a little apprehensive about the sour cream being heated in the oven, but it turned out WONDERFUL.  Both of my kids ate it up and my husband and I also enjoyed it...so this is definitely a keeper, Thanks Stephanie!!

This is the best.  But I would have to add that you need to follow the directions on the taco package, by adding water.  This is also good with beans and taco sauce.  My kids loved it.

I used the same ingredients except I added a little rice 1/4 cup and reformed beans to the ground beef mixture. It made it a little bit of a heartier meal for my husband and I. Good idea with using tortillas instead of crescent dough because it made it a little sweet which I don't mind but my husband prefer it that way so I'll try it.

Very tasty. Read some reviews, and added a can of rotel and a can of black beans. Might add some olives next time. Would also be good with Spanish rice. Used a bag of crushed Doritos Nacho Cheesier instead of plain tortillas. Served topped with salsa and shredded lettuce.

it was good. wasn't amazing but my hubby who is picky did like it and say it was yummy and filing...but than tacos he said. the reason I didnt like mine is I put the sour cream in its own layer and it cooked weird...I followed the exact recipe just used spur cream on my half instead of all since he doesn't like it. anyways I found it a bit dry and lacking of some flavor. next Time ill be adding salsa or taco sauce in a layer and leaving out the sour cream.

I thought this was delicious! I only used an 8 oz container of sour cream and added refried beans. My favorite part was the somewhat sweet flavor of the dough. I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

I liked it this, I didn't love it. I made slight variations based on the reviews I read. I did add onions while cooking the meat and I added a thin salsa layer. Next time I wouldn't use as many chips as the recipe calls for. I would do a much thinner layer. Overall, the flavor was good and this was very simple and quick to make.

Fun for something different than tortilla based casserole.  Very fast and made it just because I had the ingredients on hand.  So glad to find the recipe--we loved it!  (low carb eaters can leave off the bottom)

Definitely needed a bigger pan. Used an 8x8 and the chips were over flowing. Tasted great, though!

Loved it! Nice twist to tacos. Added ranch style beans.  Next time I plan to add Rotel tomatoes to it.

This was awful.  I made the recipe almost exactly as it is written, with two exceptions--I used double the cheese, and used half the chips on top.  The crescent rolls are inherently sweet and do not at all go with the rest of the dish.  The sour cream is overpowering and lumpy and adds nothing--it actually takes away from the dish and serves, I think, just to be a filler to make the dish larger.  Perhaps stirring it into the meat mixture would help the texture but it still adds nothing to the flavor.  You can't even taste the taco seasoning over all that sour cream and the butter sweet flavor of the crescent rolls.  Also, 14 ounces of crushed chips is way too much.  It seems, again, like a "creative" way that someone was trying to make a large casserole with just a pound of meat.  I only used half the chips and it was still too much.

Followed the recipe as written.  First of all,  if you make this,  make sure the dough is fully cooked.  Don't listen to the other reviewer and cook it half way.  Another problem was that the chips burnt while cooking.  I actually tried one piece,  but it was all i could handle.  The mixture of dough, cheese, and sour cream was a bit overwhelming.  Do yourself a favor and make tacos instead.

KC here! I am 23 year financial broker, living here at home with my loving wife. We don't have any children, but we sure do have a rambunctious puppy. His name if Fido, and he likes going on long walks on the beach, and fetching Frisbees in the sea foam. We have been considering getting him another puppy friend, and have been browsing for a while now, but we haven't settled just yet because we want to make sure that he has the best puppy friend he can have. He is quite the goof, and likes to eat his food very fast. Financial broking is going well now that we are past the '08 dilemma and life is going well for me, and I hope it is for you too. Anyways this taco pie is good. I would recommend it.

My family loved it.  I doubled the recipe, bought two cans of crescent rolls and used an 9x13 pan....skipped the part where you cook the crescent dough and simply put it all in the oven at the same time. It was great.  Simple recipe that can have many variations.  We skipped the corn chips..I figured we'd save a little on sodium. Will definitely make this again.

crescent rolls- used low fat ones. also used fat free sour cream, used fat free refried beans and salsa and layered it in. covered with small amount of shredded cheese  then shredded lettuce and cilantro dressing.
Improved the healthiness, fiber content  and it was a huge hit. Omitted the chips.

This recipe was good, but wouldn't recommend the crescent rolls as a base for the crust, it should be of a less buttery taste, so it was all good though

Loved it!  I used chicken breats tho instead of beef because I don't eat beef, put the breasts in my little crockpot overnight with some garlic powder, a smigeon of taco seasoning (I make my own), salt and pepper, then the next day shred the chicken.  Yum.  BUT, waaaaaayyyy too many crushed chips  wow!  Will use way less next time.  Maybe a cup or two max.  Great recipe tho!

Even though I amended this recipe, I am giving it 5 stars as being a very good base recipe. I sprinkled some garlic  powder over the dough as I unrolled it into the pan. I browned the ground meat with 1 cup of diced onions till the meat was browned. I’ve never liked powdered taco mix thus I stirred 1 cup of chunky salsa and 1/2 cup of sour cream into the meat mixture after any excess fat was drained off. I spread a layer of crushed tortilla chips over the baked crescent dough and then spread the meat mixture over the chips. I omitted spreading sour cream over the meat. I just topped the meat with the olives, cheese and the remaining crushed tortilla chips. I served the following as add-ons: avocado slices, guacamole, lettuce, additional salsa, additional sour cream and diced tomatoes. I also served heated black beans as a side dish. Everyone loved this meal.

Very nice base. To beef it up a bit, I simply sauteed bell peppers and onion to mix in with the filling and topped with lettuce, fresh tomatoes, and avocado once out of the oven. Also way way reduced the sour cream, just because I don't need it. This also works great with chicken! Keeper as a base recipe for something better :)

I changed the recipie a little.  Used gr turkey insted of the hamburger...used low fat crescent rolls...low fat or fat free sour cream...low fat cheese... baked tortilla chips.  It is just as good and about 1/2 the fat and carories. ALso, if you don't like sour cream that much, mix it in with the hamburger.  That way you don't get a mouthful of sour cream.  This is a real quick and good recipie.

I've made this recipe many times and each time find something to add....Every single attempt is amazing. Tonight I plan on add in a half can of diced tomatoes with jalapeno and instead of regular tortillas nacho Doritos. I have a great feeling about the turn out! This is the best alone no doubt but it's always fun to change things up a bit.

Awesome recipe, my twist on this was using ground beef and pork, used burrito seasoning, I added rotel  chili fixins tomatoes to the meat mixture, and instead of tortilla chips I crumbled two medium bags of Doritos chips, one nacho and one cool ranch.   Very easy to fix and turned out great! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I use reduced fat crescent rolls, ground sirloin or turkey, plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and low fat cheeses. I don't put chips on mine and don't really miss it. I also top my with all kinds of veggies (ex: green & red peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, etc.) This dish is a great way to provide your kids with the nutrients they need. (Also important ;))

This was a good, hearty meal.  I added a can of corn and refried beans - I do think it needed a litte more variety than what's in the recipe.  It was great the next day too. My toddler wouldn't really eat it, but that doens't mean anything, he can be picky!

I alsochanges it around a bit, not everyone in my house likes sourcream so I mixed salsa and sourcream together then spread it on. I alos adde refried beans before layering the hamburger.I used a mix of nacho doritos and plain chips as that is what I had on hand. served it with typical taco toppings on the side. I also doubled the recipe for my large family.I used a 11x9 pan.

Big hit!  Changed it up a little, mixed into the hamburger 1/2 can refried beans & 1/2 can rotel. I skipped the sour cream, and use tortilla chips on top.  My husband said he could eat this all week.  Easy, easy, easy!

Made for 2 in a 9x9 pan. Turned out pretty good. Browned hamburger w/ onion, added taco seasoning then mixed w/ sour cream. Added nothing fancy to it, just some medium picante sauce to top it off. Definitely quick and easy!

This was very good and many of the guests enjoyed it, but I thought it was a little dry.  Will probably add a bit more liquid next time.  Otherwise, great flavor!

only added about 1/2 the amount of cheese and 1/2 the sour cream, and and only used about 1 c. chips on top. also added a bit of salsa and refried beans, per another's request. was pretty good. amazing, but a good go-to meal.

I switched it up quite a bit, didnt use crescent rolls first off. Used a 10"x10" glassware, and instead of the crescent rolls I used 2 10" tortillas. Just like others I put refried beans, then some freshly shredded quesadilla cheese, meat with a taco seasoning off of here as well, some more quesadilla cheese, probably a third of what the recipe calls for in sour cream, crushed doritos, quesadilla cheese and some mozzarella cheese. Turned out REALLY good. As a side I made some Rice with a whole onion, bell peppers, green onions and chili powder and salt.

we've been eating Taco Pie for at least 20 years now. I was surprised to find a receipe online! The only difference in my dish is that I used Fritos. They hold up well and add flavor. Also, try adding a layer of Fritos just on top of the crescent roll dough. Receipe is quick and great for an easy weekday dinner or a gathering when you need a casserole. We chop up onions and lettuce for the top and serve with salsa.

This was very easy and went well with the kids and hubby. Other ratings criticize the fat and calorie content. As a general rule, if it's fast and easy, it's usually not good for you. :-) So, once in a while as a speedy dinner, it's not gonna kill you. I thought that the amount of tortilla chips seemed excessive, as I had a lot left over sliding around the pan when we were done diving in.

My family loved this and it filled them up!  I served it with yellow rice and next time will add refried beans to the mix.  Also, not every recipe has to be low fat.  Called portion control if you're watching your weight.

This is a delicious and easy recipe.  It's now one of my family's favorites.  I added a thin layer of salsa after the sour cream to give it a little more flavor.  Also, you only need a thin layer of tortilla chips on top, not the whole bag.

I added a can of tomatoes and a can of green chilis in with the meat mixture and then topped with the sour cream, cheese, just enough crushed chips to cover it, more cheese, and green onions and cilantro.  Thought this was very yummy.  I like that it is a base recipe that you can add things that you would like to it.  I thought about adding corn too.

This was very good.  I liked the crescent rolls on the bottom of the pie.  I took the advice of several other reviewers and mixed the sour cream in with the meat mixture.  Unfortunately, I struggled a little with fitting everything into the pan because the instructions state to use a square cake pan.  I think I'll try an 11x7 in. glass dish next time.  I should have read more of the reviews first, as I may have saved myself some trouble.

The dish is ok as is.  I used turkey meat and low carb tortillas to make this meal a bit more on the healthy side.  I layered with meat, beans, tortilla chips, and tomatoes then put the sour cream and cheese.  I also cut the amount of tortilla chips in half and it still seemed like a lot.  My family liked it much better with the tortilla chips under the sourcream and cheese so as not to have that super hard crunchy top.  I have also tried this with the plain yogurt instead of sour cream and it tasted just as good.  This meal can be made so that your children will love it and you won't mind them eating it.

Instant hit!  My fam of four ate nearly the whole dish in one go.  So easy, and yummy.  Like other reviewers, I added a small can of red enchilada sauce to two lbs. ground beef and put some cheese in the meat mixture (I addded less cheese on top) I also held the sour cream until serving.  This was a real winner!

My family loved this!  YUM!  I did make a few changes.  I used 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef and about 8-10 oz. of sour cream (I think an entire 16 oz. container of sour cream would be over kill - and I love sour cream).  I also used Doritos instead of the tortilla chips and a lot more cheese.  I cut up lettuce, tomatoes, onion which each person put on top of their serving, along with a dollop of sour cream and salsa.  Delish!  :)

I thought this was a very quick and easy recipe. I used turkey meat I stead of burger, and only a little bit of original flavored yogurt in place of the sour cream. I cut the fat way down.

Absolutely LOVED it!  Only thing I did different was I cooked the taco meat according to the directions on the seasoning package.  The way this reads you just add the powder to the meat.  I figured that would be way too salty.  It turned out perfect & went quick.  Will definitely be making this again!!!

Very good! We used pie crust instead and it turned out great.  The filling i used just beef, refried beans and black beans...Only thing I would change about the whole thing is to add some kind of sauce to the pie to keep it from being dried!

We were disappointed in this recipe. It definitely needs modifications. If I were to make it again, I would: 

1. Use biscuits instead of crescent rolls
2. Use 2 pounds of meat to the same amount of sour cream
3. Use fritos instead of tortilla chips.

This was easy, but a bit bland.  Second time I made it...8 oz. cream cheese mixed with 8 oz. sour cream and 1 can mild green chopped green chilies...layered on top of meat layer.  Much more flavor, but not too much for the kiddos.  A winner!

This turned out great! I am always looking for a new mexican dish to try, and this one didn't disappoint. I undercooked the cresant's by a couple of minutes, and added the sour cream and added salsa to the meat & seasoning and mixed that together instead of layers. Will definitely make this again!

I smothered re-fried beans over the crescent roll bottom and added some of my own seasonings to the beef (in addition to the taco seasoning - Mrs. dash's chipotle, cumin, and California garlic blend, and 1/2 a fresh yellow onion). I lowered the amount of sour cream to  about 8 oz and smothered it over the top of the beef. And I topped it with crushed Doritos! It was a little sweet with these additions, but my boyfriend and I loved it!

Quick, easy and tastes great! I put Doritos only on what I thought we would eat that night so the Doritos wouldnt get soggy. Still good re-heated for lunch the next day, just added chips after heated up and added my toppings.

This is ridiculously easy but very tasty, and the plus is you can modify this to fit your dietary needs! Less sodium=then make your own taco spice, lower fat=use low fat cheese or no sour cream, etc. Someone had commented on how much trans fat was in the recipe, but that really depends on you, the cook. There are plenty of chips out there with 0 trans fats. Simple, good and kid friendly.

This was really easy and delicious.  Sadly I had to omit the layer of sour cream because my husband does not like it, but I added it to my plate.  I did add a can of diced tomatoes and green chile and extra cheese.  It was yummy!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I didn't want to use the cake pan on hand, so I used a muffin pan instead. After the dough was almost done, I added the taco meat, refried beans, and Mexican-style cheese and baked this combination for 5-7 minutes.  I'm not a fan of sour cream, so I left that out.  The "taco muffins" had the same great taste and a unique presentation.  I topped the muffins with Ortega salsa, and we ate the tortilla chips on the side.

This could be better with some changes.  16oz of sour cream just seemed too much, so I only used half.  even with half, it was way too much. The creaminess of the sour cream took over the pie. A whole bag of tortilla chips also seemed way too much, so I just crushed enough to cover the top.  If I ever make this again, I would use this as a base and make more changes.  Less sour cream (or none at all), less tortilla chips....and after reading other reviews, maybe add in corn and some tomatoes.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was tasty but we decided it could be better.  The next time I made it, I added a layer of refried beans, diced tomatos, kernal corn, and used the "lightly" salted Fritos, crushed for the topping.  Garnished each helping with lettuce and black olives and the boys (2yr, 5yr, 34yr olds) had multiple helpings.

Quick and easy recipe, which my 8 year old boys love.  I tweaked a little by adding diced tomatoes and lettuce to make it more "taco-ish" :)

This Recipe was great. I did make a few Changes though. I mixed the sour cream with one can of refried beans, and added a can of corn on top it. After I baked it for 10 minutes I topped it with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and salsa. Yum! :)

SUPER easy to make with delicious results! Serve with a simple salad and you're all set. 

I added refried beans, salsa and crushed Doritos. I also plated the pie with chopped lettuce and a generous dollop of sour cream.

You won't receive any complaints from serving this meal... even those pesky picky eaters!

Extremely good!!!!! When I make the crescent roll I spray olive oil in the bottom and when I cut it it comes out like a piece of pie making it less messy. Fantastic recipe!

I am only giving this 3 stars because 1) it's not very healthy, 2) it took alot of prep time and made alot of dishes, 3) it did not make good leftovers, and 4) it wasn't as yummy as I was hoping. I didn't care for the crescent roll "crust" - it just seemed really out of place with the mexican flavors. I don't think I'll be making this again.

I made this and accidentally forgot the tortilla chips!  I topped it with shredded lettuce and salsa.  Even without them, this was pretty good!  Next time I will add the chips and maybe some refried beans.  My family liked it also.  It was VEY easy.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because you have to add some garlic, chopped onion, chopped green pepper and possibly kidney beans to give it some depth.  I also used a fraction of the sour cream because my husband doesn't like it.  But with my additions, it was delicious!  :)

My impression is that this recipe is Taco Dip for dinner... which may be a good thing for some people.  The only change I made was to add refried beans as many reviewers suggested.  The flavors were good, but the meal was very sloppy.  I think I will stick to just making tacos in the future.

Didn't have sour cream on hand so used 1/2 c. of green sauce.  I'm sure this would have been better with sour cream but it was surprisingly good.  Everybody in my family loved it which is very unusual.

This is an awesome dish. Me and my boyfriend find it to be even better than regular tacos. I added a few things to mine such as re-fried beans and our version of mexican rice and also left out the sour cream. I read other reviews before making and have to say that my crust turned out to be perfect cooking it as directed. This is something that I will be making a lot more often.

This was extremely good, my husband ate half the pan in one setting. The only thing I did differently was adding a can of black beans and used about half the cheese. Topped with salsa and it was delish. Even when I reheated it in the oven the next day it tasted like it was freshly cooked.

I thought this was pretty good. I used a 9X13 pan and put a layer of refried beans on top of the crescent rolls after cooking. Also added onion in with the beef when browing. Topped with chips and then added shredded lettuce and salsa when serving. Yum!

Of course this is good if you like tacos! I used only 1 cup of sour cream and that was plenty. It was so rich I can't imagine adding another cup. Also, don't forget to drain the beef before adding the taco seasoning. My family liked this so I will make again.

Gave this recipe to my grandson ( he's taking a cooking class ) to make this past weekend. It was delicious. Didn't change a thing on the recipe, it was perfect as is. Also reheats in microwave really well. Thanks for such an easy and quick recipe.

I had the same problem as many others-too soggy on the bottom and too dry on the top.  I will try some of the reveiwer's modifications if I decide to give this another try in the future.

This was SOOOO good!  I will definitely be making it again and again.  I made this last night for dinner with a group of friends and it was a huge hit, everyone went back for seconds!  I give it four stars because I found I had to make a few changes; the directions omitted the fact that you need to spray the pan with nonstick spray before laying the crescent dough in the bottom.  Not to mention, that when adding the package of taco seasoning to the meat, it needs to be combined with the specified amount of water and cooked for 4-5 minutes to thicken.  Also, I found the full 16 oz of sour cream, the full amount of cheese, and the entire bag of chips to be too much for a square pan (mine is a 9x9"), the full amounts of those would work for a rectangular pan.  I added a diced yellow onion when cooking my meat, and after adding the seasoning I added a can of rotel (drained of the liquid).

If you use your own taco seasoning mix, this really is pretty tasty. I know my boys eat the heck out of this and really enjoy themselves. I serve it with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and homemade salsa. NOTE: To make this with half the meat, I'll usually sub a can of black beans and a couple red peppers. This is also better with a little minced onion and garlic.

I used flour tortillas instead of crescent dough.  I added refried beans and some salsa, and also cut back on the amount of sour cream.  Pretty good!

this recipe was very quick,easy and good. Just what a busy mom of three needs!! I followed another review and used the white cheese dip and ranch style beans. I also just used regular tortilla chips. It came out great and kid friendly for a very picky four yr old!! thank you.

We really love this recipe, with a couple of alterations. We found it a little dry the first time around, so we mix the ground beef with a can of refried beans (whatever flavor you choose, we like the spicy jalapeno) and about a cup of medium salsa (mild salsa also works fine).  This is a hit with both the husband and the kids who are not usually open to trying new things.

We loved this!  I added some salsa and green chilies to the hamburger mixture and reduced the sour cream amount to 8 ounces.  I also mixed some of the taco seasoning into the sour cream mixture rather than using the whole amount in the hamburger.  Lastly I use doritos for the topping.  I was told that I should make this again soon!  Easy and delicious recipe!

My kids absolutely love this. I've made it a few times now, playing with some of the variations mentioned in other reviews. It comes out great no matter what I do to it, which is handy. LOL. Great recipe to have some fun with. And it's kid friendly! :)

I followed this exact.  I thought it was very good, but next time I will add a can of refried beans to the mix.  It is a simple recipe with great results that my whole family enjoyed.

I read a lot of the reviews first.  This was good and very quick and easy. I added taco sauce, hot sauce, and dried jalepenos to the meat mix.(This added a lot of flavor to the dried mix suggested in the recipe.) Also, I used a can of veg. refried beans, chopped olives, green onion and layered the cheese "under and over" the corn chips.  I'm a little (up in the air) about the crescent roll bottom.. I may try something "crunchier" next go around.  But... all in all, my husband LOVED it!  I'll make it again.  This recipe reminds me of a 7-layer "dip" recipe.. but hot.  Way to go recipe submitter!  Thanks!

It was great!  I forgot about the chips until I was just finishing it off, so I just put a bowl of "Tostitos Scoops" on the table, and everyone loved it!  Next time I will DEFINITELY double this recipe, It was barely enough for the three kids, let alone the adults :]

The kids didn't like it, I couldn't believe it.  I thought it was ok, not worthy of 5 stars though.  It is ez to make, but not a ton of flavor.  I would add some more spice to it, some jalapenos, sweated onion and avocado to give it more flavor.

I used a 9x13 pan - to much rolls for my square pan - but it fit perfect in my 9x13. I also hate soggy chips - so I crushed doretos and offered them as a topping choice along with shredded lettuce - think domino's taco pizza - that way the chips stayed crunchy even on the leftovers! I also added one can chopped tomato's with mild chilies to the meat mix to give it more substance to fill up my 9x13 pan. Very good and I will make again.

For a healthier version I used ground turkey, reduced sodium taco seasoning, lowfat sour cream, lowfat shredded Mexican cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls. Sauteed a small diced onion with the meat. Added 1/2 can drained/rinsed black beans and 1/2 can drained/rinsed white corn to the meat along with only 1/2 of the sour cream mixed in. I also only used 1/3 to 1/2 of the chips.  This turned out to be very quick and tasty topped with tomatoes, lettuce, and salsa. I will add some hot salsa to the meat and allow to cook down next time for a bit more spice.

So simple and easy to make.  Went over well in our house.  I did follow some other reviewers suggestions and cooked the pastry 4 minutes under the recommended time.  I also reduced the sour cream to about a third and mixed it with about a 1/2 cup of medium hot salsa before adding atop of the meat mixture.

I made a lot of alterations as the calories and fat were too high for my family.  I used turkey meat instead of beef, fat free crescent rolls, fat free sour cream, low fat mexican blend cheese  and baked tortilla chips.  I also added green chilies, black olives, chopped onion and diced tomatoes for added flavor. I used half of the taco seasoning as it would have been too much salt.  It was a big hit!  My family, including my 3 year old loved it!  Not to mention there was a lot less fat and calories than the original posted recipe.  Thanks!

Like everyone else, I tweaked it a little :) I made 4 servings.  I used reduced fat crecent rolls and cooked them for 6 minutes first (not the full 11-13). For the meat mixture I added some cooked brown rice to bulk it up,onions and reduced salt taco seasoning. When that was cooked I added 1/4 cup low fat sour cream and mixed it all together. It gave the meat a creamy texture. So I layered as follows: crecent rolls, fat free refried beans, meat, 2% milk cheese, tortilla chips. Then popped back into the oven for 5 more minutes. Once it was cooked I added the salsa. This recipe is so "tweakable" you really cant go wrong with it.

Let me start with, my teenage son said "Finally!  A decent dinner!" I added a can of black beans to the meat to make it more substantial and mixed in 1/2 a jar of chunky salsa, only used half of the sour cream than what was called for and a fraction of the chips (fat!fat!fat!) just enough for the crunchy texture. Turned out fab!

This is soooooo good! I made mine in a pie pan, and put the dough on the sides, and bottom just like a pie. I then on the bottom layer put the crunched up tortilla chips. I then put the cooked hamburger meat, and added green chilis, then I put warmed up refried beans on top of that, then I put lots of mexican cheese, and another layer of crushed tortilla chips. I baked in the oven on 350 for 30 min. On the side I had chopped lettus, jalapenos, sour cream, and salsa. Everyone LOVED this recipe!

So quick and easy and tastes great!  I use 4% fat ground beef, fat free sour cream and cheese, as well as whole wheat tortilla chips to cut some of the fat and calories and it is still excellent!  My husband who can eat anything and not gain a pound never knew the difference! We all love it, and my friend insisted we have her and her husband over for dinner on a night that we make it... so we had them over last night and they loved it. She called me tonight to tell me she just made it for her entire family and got rave reviews!

Very good. I skipped the chips and put another tube of dough over the top of the ingredients and my husband loved it.

I can't believe it! I finally found a recipe that my whole family loves! Even my extremely fussy 27 year old son who won't eat anything had 2 helpings and would have had more except that we ran out even though I doubled the recipe!  I did incorporate a couple of the changes that others have suggested. I took the crescent roll crust out just as it was turning brown, before it was totally baked. I left out the sour cream because my son doesn't care for it. I used the big and flaky Pillsbury crescent rolls and put them out in a 9x13 pan. I doubled everything else in the recipe. I served it with sour cream and salsa on the side.  6 adults ate the pan full and could have eaten another full pan full because everyone liked it that much!  I will be making this often and it will be a really quick, easy dinner to make when I get home from work too. Thanks so much for this recipe. It is very versatile and extremely YUMMY!!!

I found this recipe in a cookbook many years ago and have been using it ever since. My family loves it. I use the taco seasoning and add a can of chilies to it and salsa also. I usually make two at a time because it goes so fast.

While this is very quick and easy, and it is a perfect go to meal when you're in a hurry, it was a bit bland for the tastes of my family.  I will be keeping this one to try again, but I'll have to jazz it up quite a bit.

My family LOVES when I make this dish and asks for it at least once every two weeks.  Even our 11 year old daughter who is usually "very picky" craves this dish and has seconds when I make it.  The only modification I make is to skip the sour cream and substitute salsa instead.  VERY good!!

I found it rather unpleasant.  It seemed extremely starchy.  I won't make it again.  I do think the crescent rolls as a pie base is a good idea, though.

This is one of my favorite mexican-themed casseroles.  Who doesn't love crossaints?  It is easily adaptable to fit anyone's preferences.  You can add corn, crushed corn chips, beans, really anything you like.  I've made this several different ways now and haven't been disappointed yet. *Updated* This is how we like it best.  Crescent rolls in a 9x13, topped with a cup of sour cream mixed with a cup of salsa.  Next layer is mexican rice (from this site).  Then is the meat browned with onion, mixed with taco seasoning and a can or two of rotele.  Next are the black olives.  Top with monterey jack/cheddar cheese and whatever leftover tostitos I can find.  Delicious!

There was so much hype that I was expecting a DELICIOUS meal! Instead, it was sort of bland and just OK. I added refried beans, black beand and green chiles, too. I'd just rather make tacos. Seemed like so much work for so little flavor.

Sinfully delicious!  Wanted to try something other than just tacos.  Actually easier than making tacos. Look up the homemade Taco Seasoning I.  I omitted red pepper 'cause don't like spicy.  Recommendation: Use a pizza cutter; crust is perfectly crispy and a spatula doesn't work well.  Thanks

I used this recipe as a base and used suggestions from several PP.  I baked the "crust" in a 9x13 pan for 16 minutes at 350, next time I'll spread it a litle thinner for a crispier crust.  While that was baking, I browned 1 lb ground beef with a chopped onion.  Drain when cooked.  Return meat mixture to frying pan.  Add taco seasoning and water per package instructions.  Also add 1 can of corn and 1 can of black beans, both drained and rinsed.  In a sauce pan, combine 1 can refried beans and one 10 oz can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies.  When the crust is baked, spread refried bean mixture down first.  Top with meat mixture.  Top with cheese.  Bake for 10 minutes at 350.  I had taco toppings available and we all fixed our to our own liking (green pepper, tomato, lettuce, sour cream).  We ate the tortilla chips on the side.  My husband said "it's a keeper" which is two thumbs up in his book!

This was the best taco pie I have ever had.  The only suggestion is that you need to double the whole recipe bc there will not be enough for everyone to have seconds and beleieve me they will want to have seconds.

This was great. Something that I'm sure an entire family would enjoy. I used a 9x13 inch pan for mine. I used a hot taco seasoning mix, added black olives and used nacho cheese Doritos. Drizzle a little taco sauce on top. This makes it delicious! I will definately make this again!!

I made this recipe, but i baked it in a 9 inch pie plate.  I did not pre-bake the crescent dough, and I put a layer of nacho chips on the crust before the meat mixture (add an 8oz can of tomato sauce to meat mixture).  I only used about 3-4 TBLS of sour cream.  I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes and it was perfect.  My husband and 16 yr old son loves nacho doritos and mexican, so it was right up their alley! (Oh yeah..use more cheese) :-)

Great recipe! My husband liked it but my very picky kids wouldn't eat it! I also mixed the sourcream in the ground beef mixture like the previous posters said. I also would not use that many crushed chips I cruched 2 cups(about 1/2 of a 13 ounce bag) worth and even that was way too much. I would use more like one cup of crushed chips. 
Oh and it warmed up for lunch the next day just fine!

we just made the taco pie for dinner, and it definitely was quick and easy.  we used a 9X9 pan and didn't find the crescent rolls to thick...  they were just the right size.  we added jalapenos and a layer of spicy refried black beans which added great texture.  we also used only 8 oz of sour cream and 1/4 bag of tortilla chips which was just the right amount.  also we included a layer of salsa.  we will defintely make this again!

This was good.  I would have given it 5 stars but the crust was too thick for us even though I cooked it in a 11x7 inch pan.  Next time I make it, I will still use the 11x7 inch pan, but only use half of the cresent rolls.  This is very quick and easy which is perfect during soccer season!

I recommend waiting til cheese is slightly melted before adding chips (crush pretty good).  My chips started to brown before the cheese was completely melted.  Great dish for a night when you don't have a lot of time to fuss over dinner.

Pretty Good recipe. Like a few of the other reviewers said-you need to USE A 9x13 PAN for the crescent dough to fit. Also, I BAKED THE DOUGH ON THE TOP RACK OF OVEN to ensure that the bottom didn't get too done, and also only baked until a little browned so that it wouldn't overcook when put back in for the 10 minutes for cheese to melt. The chips do get soggy when reheating so it wouldn't be a bad idea to leave them off and add as you eat. I also topped each serving (not the whole dish-for reheating purposes) with sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce. Tasted just like a taco. Don't think that I would have liked the recipe that much without adding the toppings though. With these few adjustments, my husband and I both thought the recipe turned out pretty good. Thanks!

Great recipe, quick and easy.  I don't like the sour cream warm so I add it after baking.  I also add olives prior to baking and I only crush enough chips to cover the top.  This is one of our favorites!

I tried this tonight wanting something different. My husband and 9 year old had huge doubts but were convinced after one bite. It really is good and so easy to individualize to your own tastes. I too used a 9 x 13 inch pan - used refried beans, then the meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and finally the chips. I cut way back on the sour cream and it turned out fine. Everyone had seconds and my oldest boy proclaimed it a keeper!

We enjoyed this, but would make a few changes the second time I make it.  Although I added salsa to the meat prior to baking, I would add more next time around - probably about 1 cup - for more flavor.  I also cut the chips in half, per other's suggestions, but would leave them off and add to each individual serving. so they stay crisp.  (They were soft when reheated.)

This was very good, but I agree with the review below - I found a square cake pan to be too small, and 14.5 oz of chips way too many.  I would also add tomoatoes and/or lettuce on top next time.  And I might try adding some salsa or taco sauce to the ground beef.  With some modifications, this gets 5*'S!

Although this seems like such a basic recipe, IT IS GREAT!!  It is good the first day and as leftovers.  I followed the recipe as it is, and loved it!  I topped with freshly chopped tomatoes and had a side of refried beans.  I didn't have olives, but I will try having those as a topping next time as well.  For leftovers, you can add more crushed tortilla chips if you need something crunchy.  Otherwise, this is very simple to make, and pleasing to almost anyone.

This was very easy and tasted really good!  I did top it with lettuce, tomatoes, and salsa after serving.  I would do it in a 9 x 13 pan next time.

This was delicious. My husband is very picky and said "it looks funky". No sooner he tried it he ate more than half the pan. I did cut the amount of sour cream in half and only used enough crushed chips to where I couldn't see the cheese. It was soooo great.

This was great, I loved it!  I too added refried beans, and I left off the chips just because I forgot to buy them and the ones I had at home were stale.  I added some onions to the meat mixture, and topped w/tomatos and raw onion.  This recipe is highly customizable to your tastes.

This was so good - not too spicy.  I did add refried beans like a reviewer suggested.  Also chopped up tomatoes and shredded lettuce for on top of afterwards.  Everyone liked it:-)

This was an awesome dish! Everyone liked it! Next time I make it I will add a layer of refried beans above the chips because I like the chips soft and not stabbing me in the mouth. :) I didn't use the amount of sour cream called for. :) I added extra cheese! GREAT DISH! :) Will cook again!

I made this recipe when my in-laws came for dinner.  Very easy and relaxing to serve.  My mother-in-law wouldn't leave without the recipe, and it's just as good microwaved the next day.

This was really good.  I am on a low fat diet so I used reduced fat cresent rolls, low-sodium taco seasoning, reduced fat cheese, fat free sour cream and baked nacho chips and it was STILL good.  It was so fast and easy to prepare too.

When I originally saw that there was Sour Cream in the recipe, and that it would be heated, I was a little skeptical.  But, I tried it, omitted the nacho chips, added some refried beans, and it came out great.  I will definitely make this one again.

Very easy and very good! This is a perfect recipe for working parents or even single folks! We substituted a few things by taking out the chips, but added avocado, lettuce and tomato after the cook time. We also did two layers of cheese, one a melted one and one placed on the lettuce after the cooking time. Very kid friendly and an easy recipe to make changes by adding or subtracting with, just like the author said! Thanks!

This is great recipe, the only thing I would have to add is, when adding the taco seasoning, follow the instructions on the taco seasoning package, which is add water.  I also added beans and taco sauce to mine.  It was great and the kids loved it. Its fun for a Friday night or Saturday night supper.

I added chili powder to spice it up a bit and will add a little on top for appeal the next time. Will add Tajin next time as well.  Complimented it with fresh made pico de gallo.   Even my daughter ate it who wouldn't touch sour cream before.

Good!  I will make it again but may add some green onions, lettuce and tomatoes after it bakes.  I do think 14 oz of Doritos was too much.  After crumbling, I may have used a cup, 1-1/2 cups and it was a very generous amount.

I will be making this but wanted to observe that the picture that looks so yummy and is promoting this recipe appears to have an added layer of cheese on top of the crushed chips.  The pics with crushed chips as the last layer do not look nearly as appetizing.

Super easy and super quick meal. I prepared according to recipe directions but will make sensible changes in the future, such as using a 9 x 13 for the dough (too much dough for an 8 x 8 square pan). The 9 x 13 will require doubling the meat (64 sq. inches vs. 117 sq. inches) and taco seasoning, but I will try to make do with current amount of sour cream and cheese. 14 ounces of crushed tortilla chips is too much for an 8 x 8—anything more simply falls off when serving it. Use only enough crushed chips to thinly cover the top. As other cooks have suggested, this recipe can be modified easily to taste: (1) add salsa to meat layer or (2) add salsa and shredded lettuce to top after baking or (3) or mix sour cream into meat layer or (4) spoon a dollop of sour cream on top when serving or (5) blend in different meat or (6) add refried beans, etc.—the possibilities are endless!

Delicious and so easy.  I always use Greek yogurt instead of  sour cream and also added some hot sauce and salsa to the meat.  Took another reviewer's suggestion and added some of the yogurt to the meat mixture.  The times listed worked perfectly for me.  With a side salad, my family raved about dinner.  Thanks so much for such an easy meal.

Delicious! I sautéed minced jalapeño and onion and added it to the ground beef. Added diced fire roasted tomatoes w juice strained off. Cooked all together and it made for a perfect taco  pie. Used way less crushed tortilla. Too much sodium.

Great! One thing I would change is to use less sour cream. I LOVE sour cream and this was too much for even me. I also added a layer of salsa and chopped onions. Yum!

This recipe was very good. But I tweeked it a bit. I took the advice of another review and only baked the crescent roll half done so that it wouldn't get burnt. I made my regular rotel dip for this. I browned 1lbs of ground beef and added 1 pack of taco seasoning. Then I transferred the beef to my crockpot, added 2 cans of rotel, and half a block of velveeta cheese. Once it was all the cheese was melted I layered the mixture on top of the half baked crescent roll, then shredded Mexican cheese, and then the crushed tortilla chips. I baked it for about 7 minutes until the cheese was melted and it was very delicious!

Easy, cheap, tasty, just have to be careful not to burn it next time and to broil it for the last few mins. 4 stars because its not the healthiest recipe, and it lacked a certain "fullness" factor with each bite. Tasted like a lazy pizza, but pleasantly crispier.

Delicious, made it exactly as listed. Everyone loved it. Will probably use a slightly larger pan next time. It was surprisingly filling, quick & easy to make. A keeper!

I made a single batch first and the family loved it. I then doubled it in a 9x13 and it turned out great both times. Instead of using the full amount of sour cream I used a can of refried beans with half of the sour cream. I used Doritos plain tortilla chips for the topping. I made sure I used my taller sided 9X13 and 9x9 square pan so it all fit good. A real winner for sure!!

A total hit with my picky eaters! My daughter ate more than normal for her! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly just moderation of cheese and chips as in just light layer. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, family is already asking me to make it again next week.

This was extremely tasty and easy! I omitted the sour cream (only because husband doesn't like it). Like other reviewers I added Rotel tomatoes to my meat, along with a can of Campbell's Nacho Cheese soup. I crushed my Doritos up very fine and sprinkled on top of my pie. Later once everything was done, I added a dollop of sour cream to my own personal piece along with jalapenos, and taco sauce! SUPERB

Made this recipe together with my GF. It's always fun to cook together.
We took the advice of others and only cooked the roll dough for 3/4 of the time suggested because it was going back in the oven. We added onions to the ground beef mix and layered a bit differently. We saved some cheese and sprinkled the remainder over the top of the taco chips and cooked for 10 minutes.
We added a medium salsa to the top of the portions when served and enjoyed!

GF said "it's like having tacos without having the mess" ie' no mess on your fingers etc. The Crescent roll base was a pleasant addition to the taco experience and like having a soft taco. Spreading cheese on top of the mix softened up the taco chips.

This would be a good addition to your potluck recipes.

We enjoyed this recipe with our tweaks.

I've used a similiar recipe for years. No need to bake the crescent dough first add crushed corn chips on top . Then meat, cheese, end with sour cream & crushed chips. & bake.  Either way it's really good.

I thought this recipe was just okay. If you didn't have all the extra toppings like lettuce, black olive, taco sauce, etc You would have an incredibly bland dish. I felt like it needed more meat and had too much crescent roll at the bottom and I only used half the chips which turned out to be PLENTY! I doubt I will make this one again.

Loved it.  I put my own taco seasonings in to save on the salt. I served the tortilla chips with quacamole on the side and put the sour cream on when it was done.  Looks nicer.  Was delicious!

I had a few problems with this recipe.  The recipe calls for using a square cake pan.  The pan was not sufficient to house the crescent rolls much less the ingredients.  I ended up using another tube of crescent rolls in an 8.5x11 casserole dish so I wasted a tube of crescent rolls.  Speaking of crescent rolls, I really didn't like the combination of the rolls and the contents.  It just tasted odd. This was also extremely bland, so I served it with salsa and jalapenos....still very bland.  Could we eat it? Yes, but we will not be eating it again.

I have been making this recipe for years, except I add onions, olives, and refried beans and my grandmother adds diced tomatoes to hers. I also leave out the nachos. I like to take out the biscuits a few minutes early so that when you put all the toppings on and throw it back in the oven it won't burn the dough.

I used Laura's Lean 98% lean ground beef, light sour cream, light cheese, and you can also buy low fat crescent rolls which I did not.  Any combination of the above can lighten this up, but I believe in moderation and making it just as the recipe is written is fine as well.  Such a good kid-friendly meal for this grandmother.

My family loves this stuff, I gave it 4 stars only because it doesn't have salsa in it. I put a layer of salsa on top of the sour cream, then cheese and I used fritos for the chips, amazing.

If I would have listened to half of these reviews I wouldn't have had the opportunity to experience the deliciousness that the crescent rolls bring to the dish. The only changes I made were I added green chilies,corn, and beans. It was great my family ate it up and requested it again for dinner tonight.

It was pretty good, the buns stuck to the bottom a little but that was probably my fault. It felt like it was missing something but over all it was delicious :)

Good starter recipe.  I add onions when browning hamburger.  I then add can of tomatoes - Rotel to mixture and cook for 10 minutes.  I add black olives to hamburger mixture.  Put it on cooked base and put cheese and chips on top and throw it back in oven.  Then top with sour cream, green onion and avocado.  So good

We enjoyed this. My husband had a few servings. Next time we'll add onion and some green chilis to the beef, and maybe some olives and salsa on top.

Very yummy.  My teenagers don't like sour cream but they couldn't really taste it.  I didn't add water to my taco meat seasoning, always seems to make it too watery.

Okay, so I can only sorta say I tried this recipe... b/c I altered it. I thought it was a good springboard and I was looking for something easy to convert to Gluten Free for my son, who has celiac disease. I made the taco meat like I would for regular tacos, simmering it for 5 minutes with 1/2 cup water after browning it, than drained it well. Then, I mixed in rice (already cooked, I prefer Jasmine or Basmati); about 1/3 volume of ground beef. I sautéed peppers and onions separately and then added them to the beef mixture. I made a gluten free biscuit crust and cooked it 10 minutes first and then put in the beef mixture, spread sour cream on top, then some crushed tortilla chips, then diced roma tomatoes (well drained),1/2 of cheese, one layer of whole chips and then remaining cheese, baked at 375 for 10 minutes. It was soo good! I put salsa on top. My very pick 5yr old daughter even ate a whole big slice! (and that is saying something :)

I understand about calories and fat. But it is called portion control on anything. This is great. I plan on making it for my family again.

I made a low fat version with ground turkey, reduced fat crescent rolls, light mayo, sour cream and cheese. Baked tortilla chips. My husband really liked it. I added lettuce, tomato and topped with taco sauce.

I enjoyed this very much. The change servings option does not seem to work on this. I tried changing to 4 servings and it wanted a whole 14 oz bag of chips. Seems a bit much. I just crumbled about 4 oz.

Not enough meat or flavor. It would be perfect if you double the meat and add onion and a can of Rotel. Would only use half a bag of chips

I used a 9x13 pan and 1 cresent roll pkg.  I served sour cream, salsa and guacamole on the side. I baked the cresent dough 15 minutes before adding teh ingredients listed.  I did top with crushed nacho chips; however, if you are going to use this as a leftover, make sure you heat it up in the oven, not the microwave so the chip topping will stay crisp.

The recipe is quick and easy and I really enjoyed how I turned out. I always add a little extra sour cream and cook it in a 9x13 pan but leave it otherwise unchanged. I highly recommend.

This was very tasty and very quick & easy to make. These are all good things for a weeknight dinner. I made some changes...adding chopped onion and chopped black olives to the ground beef mixture. I used my own spices that were on hand - chili powder, ground cumin and Mexican oregano. All of these herbs and spices can be used to taste. I used a small tub of low fat sour cream and just enough shredded cheese to cover. This was a hit with my husband. It was supposed to do us for 2 meals, but he ate most of it - a sure sign of success.  It would be good to have nice fresh lettuce, peppers, green onions and tomatoes on the side to make the meal more balanced. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!  I'll be making this again.

I made this for dinner last evening - but it turned out only soso. The flavor combination was great but we didn't care for the Pillsbury crescent roll dough in the bottom - it did not seem to have the right texture or taste for this dish. We also didn't like the sour cream mixed right into the meat mixture as others had suggested. I will definitely try this recipe again, but will be omitting the crescent roll dough and sour cream, and try to modify it with a different type of bottom crust. 
Will also instead serve it with cold sour cream and lettuce.
Great recipe idea tho and I look forward to playing around with it!

yum- only thing I did different was stir in a little salsa after meat was cooked and drained and had seasoning in it.  I wasn't sure what to expect with the crescent rolls but it is good. We will make this again. I served with salsa as well.

So good! After reading reviews, I tweaked it a bit. I only used 8 oz of sour cream and mixed it with the taco meat. And I mixed the water with the taco seasoning and ground beef, but I don't think I'll do that again, as it stayed pretty soupy until it was all baked. My parents loved it, my dad even got seconds as big as his first serving! Next time I'll top it with a bit more sour cream and salsa when it's done.

As written, this recipe is okay. Fast, easy instructions but I can't imagine fitting all of that into a square cake pan. I halved thesour cream and cheese and used very little of the tortilla chips. I did as some PPs suggested and mixed the sour cream with half a can of refried bean and topped the meat mixture with that. I also added some chopped onion and garlic. Perfect with the adjustments, bland and way disproportionate without.

My family loved this. I added refrained beans on top of the crust at bottom, then layered ground turkey instead of beef. Also, mixed in the sour cream and shredded cheese and followed with crushed Doritos on the top to finish it off.

Love this easy recipe! I used ground turkey instead of beef, added a layer of reried beans and corn kernels, and mixed a bunch (so that sour cream was a light pink color) of salsa with the sour cream layer. Tasted amazing!!

Excellent, but I made a few changes to make it a bit lighter and healthier. I used ground turkey in place of the ground beef (something I do with EVERY recipe that calls for ground beef), low fat sour cream, low sodium taco seasoning packet, low fat crescent rolls and 2% cheese. Also, when I browned the ground turkey, I added 1/2 of a finely diced onion and 2 minced cloves of garlic. And for the newer cooks among us here, the directions don't say to do this, but after you brown your ground beef (or turkey), drain well, return to the pan and stir in your taco seasoning. I personally do not layer this dish, I simply stir my cheese, sour cream and seasonings right into the cooked, drained ground meat and pour over the crescent roll crust. I reserve a bit of cheese to sprinkle on top then add the crushed chips and bake as directed. Turns out great every time!

What is not to like about this recipe?  It is easy, quick, and DELICIOUS!  Aside from adding a layer of pinto beans and using a little less sour cream, chips, and cheese, I prepared as instructed.  This was a total HIT!  I wish I would have made double batch.  I topped each serving with a simple taco sauce and black olives.

This was soooo good.  I changed a few minor things.  I baked the crescent roll dough for about half the time.  I used reduced fat crescent rolls, fat free sour cream, and reduced fat cheese.  I served it with shredded lettuce and fresh salsa.  This one's definitely a keeper!

Followed the directions except I added a can of diced tomatoes to the beef as it simmered with the taco seasoning.  It turned out good.  Everyone in the family liked it.  Also if you want to make it lighter use ground turkey instead of beef and fat free sour cream.  Turns out just as good.

This is in the oven so have not tasted it yet but just know it is going to be good based on the ingredients. I added most of a can of chopped black olives. The only thing that I question is all those chips. I had an 11 oz bag, not a 14 oz bag and I thought it was A LOT OF CHIPS but I put them on and am hoping for the best. UPDATE!! It was very good but I wouldn't put that many chips on next time. I made it in a 9x13 pan and 1 1/2 pound of ground beef. My husband who never complains but he complimented this dish 5 or 6 times! Wow, he was impressed, so I will probably make this often. thanks

Very good! Did not give it 5 stars b/c it was very salty, probably b/c I used a beef stock seasoning tub I found in the cupboard, so not the fault of the recipe. I didn't top it with chips b/c I put a lot of other stuff in, like a chopped onion, and leftover bell pepper. Borrowed tips from several  of you good cooks, thanks. I browned ground sirloin with onion, added my own spices as one person advised. added water and let the beef mix cook down. Added a layer of refried beans, then the sour cream, abt 8 oz. The best part was the cheese. Sargento Chef Blends Taco (shredded cheddar, Colby, Montery Jack & Manchego). It looked beautiful when it came out of the oven. I had a bag of Calidad tortilla chips, but only ate 2, no lie. The meal was so filling I didn't need anything else.

this is a lot like a recepie that i have tried before, but instead of using ground beef i used ground turkey to help on the calories.  also, i used reduced fat sour creme and frito corn chips in place of the tortilla chips.  on the top i put more of the corn chips before baking and then topped it with olives, tomatoes, lettuce and a bit of salsa.

My family loved this!! I used fat free refried beans on the bottom, then meat, then I used fat free greek yogurt in place of sour cream (my family couldn't tell the difference!), chips and cheese. Made it a bit more healthy and they devoured it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Our family liked this recipe, and I made it with ground turkey.  We didn't use all the chips, and the crescent rolls were a delicious combo.

You can use fat free cheese and sour cream, and even fat free chips. With lean ground beef. it makes this even healthier. Cuts calories to 400.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the directions. My husband was also disappointed in this recipe. I suggest flour tortillas instead of crescent rolls...add beans, layer like lasagna.....and I would not add sour cream

ok so there are a lot of ways to change this up.  i used an 11x17 pan.  i cooked a pound of ground beef and an onion  with the taco seasoning - i DID add water instead of adding it dry - because I wanted to cook the onion a little longer.  I mixed sour cream with refried beans and put that on top, topped it with cheese & doritos - first impression -- too salty.  I think maybe next time I'll use an unsalted chip or skip the doritos entirely and just serve them on the side.  everything else was good - we had it with sour cream, avocado, salsa, tomatoes and black olives.  this was very quick and easy!

This was liked by the whole family. I also used refried beans as others suggested.  A twist I used was our favorite cornbread recipe instead of the crescent rolls.  The cornbread recipe was for an 8x8 pan and I used the same amount for the 9x13 pan.  The cornbread added a great flavor!

I was excited to try this as I love tacos and LOVE crescent rolls .  I did add a few things. First I added chopped onion to the ground beef as it cooked.  When meat was done and seasoned with taco seasoning I added corn I had just fried in a pan as well as a small jar of salsa .   My first few bites I thought it wasvery tasty .  After a few more bites I realised I don't care for the sweetness of the crescent rolls with my tacos. One daughter felt the same about the crescent roll flavor , another daughter (who doesn't care much for tacos due to a slight dislike of ground beef) liked it BECAUSE of the crescent roll sweetness , and my 3rd daughter just liked it.  Next time I may try it with pizza dough as another reviewer suggested , I also think I might add a layer refried beans as well.  Overall it was tasty.

Just made it for the first time and it's great, I think I might leave out the chips next time though and make it kind of like a navajo taco pie. Definitely don't forget extra toppings and salsa, I forgot the salsa and it was super dry.

Very good! Kids didn't like the crescent roll crust so I'll leave it off if I make it again. You can easily cut the amt of sour cream and chips in half to reduce fat/calories.

My dad used to make something just like this when I was growing up. The only difference is that we didn't bake the crescent rolls first. We would put the crescent rolls in a pie dish and then the cooked meat sour cream cheese and chips. Bake for 30 minutes at 350 and it is delish! However I don't believe it feeds 8. Maybe if the portions were little, but my kids will eat this up! Definite keeper

This recipe was easy to make and the family loved it.  Instead of sour cream, I softened some cream cheese and mixed it with salsa.  It added a different flavor that was really good.  I will be making this again...

Made this exactly as written using taco flavored tortilla chips. My husband, 17 year old, and myself couldn't stop eating it. It tasted llike something that took more effort and more ingredients than it actually does. Great, easy recipe!

Great recipe.  We added corn to the meat mixture, which was layered on the crescent rolls, then we mixed a can of cream of mushroom soup with 3/4 cup salsa and put that on top. Put the cheese and chips like the recipe called for and heated for 15 min instead of 10.  Added a little extra flavor but not a lot of time :)  SO TASTY!

My kids loved this dish. It's very easy to customize to your liking. As others have said: next time I will mix the taco meat with sour cream first and probably use a little less. I can see where refried beans and taco sauce or salsa would really add to the flavor.

Good recipe I would only change 2 things. It should call for more dough and less chips. 12 oz is way too much chips

Pretty good, I felt like it was missing something... or had to much of something. I followed reviewers advice and cooked the crescent rolls less, and I added cheddar cheese on the bottom before the meat. Defiantly needs something to drink with it though!

Very good recipe.  Decreased sour cream by about half and it turned out great.  Note, calorie / fat count is high, but it's very tasty.  My husband and daughter loved it.

Made this for my family last night and it was just okay. I wasn't sure of the actual size of the pan to cook this in so I used a 9X13. A square cake pan just seemed too small, but in hindsight may have been the right size. The ingredient portions seemed odd. An entire container of sour cream seemed like too much. One pound of ground meat and 8 oz of cheese seemed like too little. And an entire 14 oz bag of tortilla chips seemed like way too much. It came out sort of dry so we ate it with salsa. It wasn't bad but I'm going to have to see how others customized and tweak it next time.

Pretty good. I added a can of refried beans....mixed the sour cream in with the beans and taco meat. Next time will try with Cool Ranch Doritoes on the top in place of plain tortilla chips.

"That's pretty tasty!" That is what I heard from my boyfriend when I made this for dinner! Usually, I have to ask how it tastes, but I knew I had a winner with this simple, easy and TASTY recipe! I added green chilies and just a bit of spicy V8 to my ground beef, used a whole small container of sour cream (in my opinion made it extra yummy), and a drained can of black beans. Will DEFINITELY be making this again soon!

This is a really good recipe...but it's super rich/fatty.  I think it might work better as an appetizer for a party.  I think next time I'll cut it into small pieces and serve it before the main meal.

Quick, easy; also took advice of another poster and mixed the beef and the sour cream before adding it to the dough.  I also did NOT use the entire 16oz of sour cream, probably about 3/4 of the container.  Made it a little spicier and the fiance gave it a thumbs up.  I'd pass on the taco sauce and use a chunky salsa on top.  Will definitely be making again.

I don't really like the way the flavor of the crescent dough mixes with the taco flavors when it first comes out of the over but for some reason it tastes better as leftovers. My husband loves it though.

This was just absolutely wonderful.  My mom was a little resistant to trying it at first and she ate the most of it lol.  My daughter (2 years) didn't want to try it because she thought it looked "yucky", she ate a serving and half after I got her to try it.

This was an extremely easy meal to make and was perfect to just throw together for the family.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!!

We enjoyed this, but next time I'll be making some minor changes to suit our tastes.  I'll either make it in a 13x9 pan and leave the ingredients as is, or cut the cheese and sour cream in half (and maybe add some refried beansJ) if I use the square pan again.

Since some of my family is vegetarian I made this pie using Morning Star "Crumbles" instead of beef and it was delicious!  My husband and a few others in the family - who are not veg - loved his pie made with beef and a layer of refried beans.
Everyone just oohhed and aaaahhhed over the pies.
Definitely a keeper!

It was good. I only put about 12oz sour cream, which still seemed a bit much to me (not a big fan) and I mixed it with the meat. Needs a bit of kick so will top with Red Hot!

this is a keeper! Everything came out perfect, the only thing I did differently was add the salsa to the sour cream to make a sort of sauce. Can't wait for dinner tonight!

This was pretty good as is. Husband really liked it, I thought it could use some tweaking. Next time I will crush up the chips and layer them with the meat instead of just tossing them on top. also I'll use some salsa and less sour cream. It's a good starter recipe IMO but nothing to wow over.

This was great! I made the recipe as is with the exception of adding black beans and just a little layer of sour cream instead of the whole container. I also used a 9x13 baking dish. Everyone loved it so it will definitely be going into the rotation.

I used a 11x17 clear baking pan.  I sprayed it with Pam first.  I think the amount of cheese & nachos was too much.  I cut it down to about 6 oz cheese & 10 oz of a 12 oz bag of tortilla chips.  I also added black olives to the mixture that goes in the oven.  After it baked I topped it with lettuce shreds and tomatoes (to add some color & health).  You won't be disappointed.

This is was good! It's nice to have something besides the usual taco for a change. I used the Butter Crescents Recipe on this site and the Taco Seasoning I Recipe as well. Instead of sour cream I used plain yogurt and it still turned out great! Much healthier with these changes too! Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely make again!

My boyfriend raved about this dish.  I switched it up a bit, I browned chopped up onion with the ground beef, added some garlic powder, then I layered strips of Pepper Jack cheese on top of the baked crescent dinner rolls, then added meat mixture, salsa,sour cream, Mexican blend Shredded cheese,an topped with the crushed Cheesy Doritos...sprinkled a little more shredded on top of the Doritos, baked and OMG

My mom has been making basically this same recipe for years.  Even with a family of my own still to this day if she calls me and tells me she is making taco pie I run to her house for dinner.  In her recipe instead of using plain corn chips she uses cheese Doritos.  YUM!!!

Awsome recipe!!! My family loved it. I did use two lbs of burger instead of one. Made it thicker.  We added chopped lettuce, tomatoes and black olives to the top once i took it out of the oven and that really made it complete!!! Thanks for the great recipe! I will definitly make it again.

Very good. I used half of the taco seasoning packet since we don't really like spicy dishes. It seems that it needs a larger baking dish. The crescent rolls were doubled over and there was NO way all the tortilla chips would fit.  Definitely adding it to the menu rotation.

Just okay.  With a few changes, I think it could be even better.  It's not bad by any means, but just missing something.  I think 8 oz. of sour cream would be enough.  I also think putting the cheese on top of the chips would make it better.  Maybe another layer of something.   I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just needs something else.

I made this for my roommate, her boyfriend and her very picky 14 yr old daughter and they loved it!!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was great!  However, the next time I make it, I will leave off the tortilla chips and serve them on the side.  I will also have lettuce, tomato & salsa on the side.  This is a great base recipe...thanks Stephanie!!

Great Base recipe.  It wasn't a 5 star because I feel the fat content was Whoa! (way too high)...like other users I skipped the sour cream and just put a few dollops on top after baking-used low fat crescent rolls and used Morningstar starter "crumbles" instead of ground beef.  This was my first time using this product and my meat eating bf could not tell the difference-he even raved about it all night long. will be making again for sure!

This was a big hit with my family.  My husband asked me to try and tweak it a bit next time I make it, though.  He suggested puttig a layer of salsa con queso dip between the meat and chips.  But this recipe will definitely be added into my rotation!

This was good, but I had to leave out the sour cream layer.  With that out, I think salsa added to the meat would be helpful.

This is very easy and good, I did put a layer of refried beans on the bottom before adding the taco meat. I have also made with canned biscuits, which is also good. This is not a dish to serve to guests, but is okay enough to have as a decent family dish. Topping with sour cream, shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes is a must.

My husband actually complimented me on this dish. I did like it too but thought it was a little dry. Maybe could've added even more sour cream. I loved the crescent roll crust. I did spray the bottom with pam. No problem getting it out of the pan.

My family loved this ( hubby, 5 yr old, 1 yr old, myself). i followed advice of others and reduced baking time for the dough by 5 minutes. I spread refried beans over the dough before the meat and left off the sour cream till after it was cooked. Will definitely make again.

I loved this!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and it was still fantastic (I also used reduced fat crescent rolls, cheese and sour cream and it still tasted great).  Incredibly easy and my kids couldn't get enough.

Sorry, got cut off before I was ready to send the review.  This was a real hit in my house.  I was a little confused as to whether to follow the taco seasoning package directions and add the water that it requires, but I DID NOT add the water and it turned out perfectly.  Wow!  Serve with a salad, guacamole, sour cream dollop, and some refried beans and you have perfection.  Great for Cinco de Mayo!

Well -- wish I could report that we liked this recipe, but cannot state that.  I don't think either one of liked the Mexican flavors with the crescent-roll crust.  I might re-try using tortillas - (?)

Everyone in my family was happy with this (which is unusual).  I might try it with sharp cheddar next time rather than Mexican cheese though.  It needs a bit more flavor.

This was amazing, my husband loved it. I did make some changes. I added green peppers and onions to my ground beef mix, and i made 2 cresent crusts. Then this is how i layered it. Crust, refried beans, ground beef mixure, cheese, the second crust, refried beans, ground beef mixture, sour cream, cheese and then crushed multi-grain toastitos to the top and baked. Covering for the last few minutes. I made it before hand and put it in the fridge until it was time to eat, and so i cooked it for 20 minutes. It turned out great. I will be making this again for sure.

Tasty and simple! I used vegetarian Smart Ground for the meat and added a can of diced tomatoes and chopped bell peppers and a little yellow onion to it. Sliced avacado makes a good garnish.

My family loves this! Very easy to make. I use cheddar cheese instead because I usually have that on hand. But I don't change anything else. I make refried beans and rice with this and it's a perfect meal.

Very good, easy recipe for the family.  Based on some reviews, I made a few changes:  I sprayed the pan with Pam.  I baked the crescent rolls a little under time.  I omitted the sour cream in the recipe and just had it to use on the side.  I only used about 7 oz (half bag) of the tortilla chips.  Satisfied my husband, 5 year old and 4 year old sons.  Thanks for posting!

This was a big hit at our house.  I followed some previous reviewers advice and added onions and rotell to the ground beef.  I also put refried beans (about 1/2 can) on the crescent rolls, then black olives.  Delicious!

Excellent for a week day dinner for a bunch of hungry teenagers and easy as 1 2 3 to whip up. I added corn and jalapenos to the mix then served it with fresh salad. The crust was delicious. I am going to try it as a quiche instead of traditional pie crust. The leftovers heated up beautifully too.

This was a great recipe.  I added 1 can of Rotel tomatoes to the meat and also some green pepper and onion.  I only used about 1/2 of the sour cream and not quite all the chips.  It was so wonderful!  I ate too much and can't wait for some leftovers.

I use a version of this taco pie recipe as a staple dish.  forger the taco seasoning mix, just mix an 8oz can of tomato sauce with the ground beef.  You can also skip the step of pre baking the dough.  bake the whole pie at the same time until the outer crust looks nice and brown and the cheese is melted.  Garnish with lettuce, green onions, tomatoes..everything you'd put on a taco.

Great! and super easy! I cooked a little onion and 2 small hot peppers with the meat and added a can of kidney beans to the meat. I used the crumbs left in the bottom of a bag of tortilla chips (about 1 cup crushed) and thought it was plenty of chips. I put them on top of the cheese like the recipe says and liked it that way because they were crispy. Olives and tomatoes go great as a topping. Thanks for a great recipe.

I did this a little bit differently, but used the same recipe just added refried beans and diced tomatoes with peppers and onions. Also I treated it more as a casserole and layered cheese after everything. And homemade tortilla strips. It was a huge hit with everyone I invited over to try it, and not difficult at all! Great recipe and thanks for the inspiration!

The crust was really good.  Baked it in a 9/13 pan.  Mixed in a can of refried beans and green chilis with the hamburger as well.  The family loved it.

This was pretty good. My son thought it had too much sour cream and I had used only 3/4 of what it called for. So I guess I would cut down on that next time. Depends on how much you like sour cream. Overall it was good, quick & easy.

Definite keeper!  I added a couple extra things though.  I added refried beans, green chilis and salsa to the meat mixture and added another taco seasoning packet to the sour cream.  I too made this low fat.  I used reduced fat crescent rolls, ground turkey, fat free sour cream and fat free shredded cheddar cheese (and it melted!).  Next time I'll even use baked tortilla chips.  Absolutely delicious!

My family really enjoyed this, and was a nice change from "ordinary" tacos, as well as being very easy. The only changes I made were to add a layer of salsa (this step is really needed to add a little moisture and really adds that extra something), used ground turkey instead of beef, and used low-fat sour cream. Yummy!!

On my first attempt I used the crescent dough as the recipe dictates. Needless to say, the fam did not like it at all. Complained that it did not taste like tacos. Today I made it again and used cornbread mix as the crust. Major cudos from the gain. The cornbread gave it a highly superior taco flavor.

We loved this. I made it using ground turkey, reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat cheese. The crescent roll dough was too big for a 9x9 pan, but I didn't want to make a 9x13 pan so I just doubled up the dough and bakes that part a tad longer. I also used crushes tortilla chips, probably half of a family size bag of chips.   My kids even liked this. It was quick and it was easy, we will be making this again.

My teenage boys loved it.  I think it was a bit salty.  I think it may have been the brand of taco seasoning I used combined with the salt from the tortilla chips.  I think I would use taco shells on the top next time.  This recipe is a keeper!  Very fast to put together.

This is excellent!  It was easy to make and very good.  I do not know that it is worth the extra fat and calories that the crescent rolls add to it.  They do not enhance the flavor at all.  If I didnt care about calories this would be my new way to make Taco Pie, but I dont think I will make it this way again.

While I really enjoyed this as my husband did, my three kids said it was just pretty good. I will probably make this again with a layer of beans of some kind...I did add corn to it and it tasted fine!

It was delicious.  The only thing I did different was added Rotel to my meat and only used about 1/4 cup sour cream and added 2 tbsp taco sauce to it.  I also used plain cheddar cheese instead of the mexican kind.

Not bad, but I may as well have made nachos for dinner. I liked it, but didn't love it. Was frustrated with no pan size included (13 x 9). The crescent dough was a bit weird since it was kinda sweet. I wouldn't recommend baking the dough for entire suggested time or it will be too dark after a second time in the oven. Salsa is a must - I used on the side, but maybe it would be better as another layer. You definitely don't need a full bag of chips or much shredded cheese on top. Rice is a good side. Kids didn't go for it at all.

I have to say this was a simple and delicious meal. I added refried beans and typical taco topping and my husband and boys loved it. I was pleasantly surpised with my 8 year old who asked for seconds because he is a very picky eater. THANKS!! def going to make this again!

This recipe really surprised me, it was tastier than I expected. Yes, it's heavy on the calories and fat, but I used reduced fat crescent rolls and fat free sour cream. I could have also used baked tortilla chips and low fat cheese to make it "skinnier" but it turned out great with the changes I made. I would make it again.

I like to hear how people tweaked recipes since it shows me how to be creative:) so I don't mind their ratings on the changed recipes.. So- as others suggested- I made this more lowfat by layering lowfat crescent rolls, chopped london broil sauteed with low salt taco seasoning (DELICIOUS VARIATION! I will use each time), salsa instead of tomatoes, lowfat sour cream/greek yogurt mixture, & lastly lowfat mexican blend cheese on top (omitted tortilla chips).  I served with shredded lettuce & chopped tomatoes for garnish. Outstanding taste/combination and I will make this again! Thanks everyone for sharing all your "tweaks".

This was pretty good.  However, I think next time I will add a layer of salsa.  Just needed something else.  I always have pre cooked hamburger in the freezer, so that cut my time in half.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe.  I added onions and diced tomatos to the ground beef, after draining it.  I still found it to be a little bland.  I should have listened to other reviews about putting sour cream on the side because mine looked like it curdled.  It was easy enough and my husband enjoyed it but not worth all the calories.

Liked it a lot, though I changed things up to suit my tastes.  I used two crescent roll packages instead of one, doubled the cheese, cut the sour cream in half, and added a can of corn and a can of kidney beans.

Just tried this recipe out for something a little different last week and it came out great!  I did go with some of the suggestions from other reviewers and used nacho cheese doritos instead of regular tortilla chips.  I also left the sour cream out (to be added after cooking) and added a layer of white salsa con queso under the ground beef layer.  The last addition I made was to add about a cup of corn (right on top of the meat) which added a great flavor to complement the rest of the dish.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

OMG so easy so quick. My cousins and I cooked this and it was done in no time. Excellent recipe. I do suggest that you add lettuce and tomato and all of the other taco fixings, it will give the dish the right type of balance (in my opinion w/out the fixings it's too heavy. All in all very good dish!!!

This was a really good dish.  The only complaint I have is that after being in the oven the tortilla chips lost their crunch; they seemed stale.

We loved this and is very kid friendly! I made some changes but this is such a good base recipe and the cressant rolls make a real good crust, I added a layer of warmed refried beans and a layer of salsa. Saved the sour cream for on top when served. Makes great leftovers for lunch at work! This is a keeper and will be made again for sure!

Yummy!! This was really good. Hubby, brother in law, daughter and I all loved it! I did improvise as well; i added a can of corn and diced tomatoes (no salsa on hand). I then baked it and added doritos and sour cream after it was finished, as desired by each person. Will definitely make again!!

This recipe is so versatile!  It's great as written, but it can also be adapted to your tastes.  Sometimes we add a layer of refried beans and more spices.  I've also left off the chips and served them over top after the dish comes out of the oven (better for leftovers that way).  Fantastic!

One can definitely make this a healthier dish by using ground turkey or lean ground beef, reduced fat cheese and sour cream and by adding in some extra veggies. Like a previous poster said, add onions, green/red/yellow peppers and olives, only use enough sour cream to cover. 
My husband and I thought this was a great dish- very tasty, will make again.

Never has my boyfriend come home taken one bite of something and said "Can you make another one for the Monday Night Football party?". We did find it a bit bland, we like spicy a lot, so on round 2 I added chili powder to kick it up. I put onions in the meat and also used salsa refried beans on top of the meat. Spicy Nacho Doritos on top...yum! Will be making this again!

My fiance and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I kept the sour cream on the side as he doesn't like it.  I also added some black beans (rinsed) and picante sauce before baking the second time.  I added some chopped green onions after baking.  My fiance wrapped his in a tortilla and swore it was just like a Chalupa.  I added lettuce to mine.  Easily adaptable for everyone's taste, I thought this was an excellent choice for a quick easy meal.

The best thing about this site is that it gives you the base recipe and then you can alter it to your own personal preference!
Instead of ground beef I used ground chicken. I did not use the taco seasoning but instead added a can of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup, chopped mild green chiles, diced tomatoes, onions and garlic salt & pepper to taste. I used about 4 oz. of lowfat sour cream and unsalted tortilla chips. It came out really good and surprisingly the whole family enjoyed it. Thanks for Stephanie!

Loved It!! I made my bean dip to add to the mix(my kids like to add it to their tacos). The dip consists of 1 can refried beans, 4 oz cream chz, dollop sour cream, 1/4 cup salsa, 1/2 c shredded cheddar cheese, 1 T chili powder, 1 T cumin, 1 t garlic powder, 1 t onion powder, 1/2 t paprika, dash of salt--Cook until cheeses are melted and mixture is smooth. I spread enough dip on baked crescents until covered. I topped with ground beef, which I added 1/2 c enchilada sauce when cooking, as well as 1 can black beans. I then topped with enough sour cream to cover beef, topped that with fresh grated cheddar cheese, and finished with crushed tortilla chips. To each individual serving, I added chopped onion, and jalapeno's, as well as sour cream, salsa and bean dip. My family raved, asking me to make it again soon. Thanks for sharing!

This was sooo easy to make and it actually tasted really good.  Tasted like you were eating a taco.  The only changes I made were based off of other reviews.  I cooked my cresent rolls for about 9 mins at 375, then covered tehm in refried beans, then the meat, cour cream, cheese, and did one half covered in Doritos and the other in tortilla chips.  Everyone liked the doritos side better, although personally, I couldn't tell a big difference!  Anyways, very

Delicious! I added my sour cream and a bit of salsa zing after I dished it out for the kids.  They are picky as could be and they even loved it, although their portions did not have sour cream.  It was easy and very good!

I love this recipe! The crecent dough is what makes it so tasty! I leave out the sour cream and grnish it with everything after it is baked. It comes out of the pan so nicely and nothing ever sticks. I'll never make regular tacos again!

Ok, so I was looking for something taco-y and quick. This was it and delicious says my family. Hubby ate thirds and brought the last piece for lunch today. I used a smaller pan and add added 1 can of diced green chilies to the meat. After the crust was baked, I layered on the seasoned meat with chiles, diced tomatoes, some salsa, and the cheese. I added the crushed tortilla chips on top once the dish was baked so they didnt sog out. They stayed nice and crunchy. Served with extra salsa and sour cream on top. A winner!

I loved this and so did my family!  I didn't have taco seasonings, so I seasoned the meat with a couple T. enchilada sauce mix.  Tasted great!.. I also added refried beans as others suggested, with some spicy salsa in the beans.  I added olives too.  We served this with lettuce, tomatoes, avacados, salsa and sour cream on the side.  I didn't use as much cheese or tortilla chips as the recipe asked for, I just did what looked right!  Yummie... I'm so glad to find a recipe everyone loved!

Tried this exactly to the recipe.  Was a little bland.  Next time am going to add more cheese and will add black olives, a little more taco spice as well.  Goes great with your favorite salsa or hot sauce over it.

I used suggestions from other reviewers, made some of my own changes, and the results were wonderful. What I did: 1. Sprayed the 7x11 pan with cooking spray. 2. Used garlic crescent rolls instead of regular, and cooked the rolls only 8 minutes. 3. Drained one can of black beans and then spread these over the cooked rolls. 4. Browned ground beef with one chopped onion. Added the taco mix to the beef, mixed well, before adding one can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. This layer went on top of the beans. 5. Added only a thin layer of sour cream, just enough to cover (I was running out of room in the pan), and shredded Mexican Mix cheese to the top of the pan. 6. I left the chips off, since I'm not a big fan of crunchy toppings on casseroles. Tasted great without it.

YUMMY!!  I did it a little different. I layered this way.  Crescent Rolls, refried beans, black beans, corn, meat, sour cream, cheese, and blue corn chips.  After it came out I added some shredded lettuce and tomatos. It was so good!

This was pretty good.  I added one can black beans, one can mexicorn and one can diced tomatoes chili style. I used taco shredded cheese and served with sour cream and salsa.  Very good looking forward to leftovers!

The kids and young adults enjoyed it immensely.  I thought it was good but a little dry.  The next time I might serve it with guacamole and salsa to give it more depth.  We will use it on a junk food night to replace pizza.

New family favorite.  Not a good one to eat for leftovers though, because, the chips get soggy and the lettuce and tomato are wilted.  Here were my alterations:  added one can of rinsed kidney beans to the meat mixture and then topped it off with lettuce, tomato and black olives.  I let my five year old throw on the lettuce and tomatos. I forgot to layer with sour cream; therefore, I topped each serving with a dollup of sour cream.  My five year old was happy to leave off the sour cream.  He devoured his portion which is not always the case.

This recipe was just ok. It could be better if the crust were somehow different. This crust was dense, dry and lacked flavor. Adding the other ingredients on top of it did nothing to mask this at all. My husband and I ended up ordering a pizza.

For not being a cook, this dish was very easy to make.  Hubby and I both liked it, with salsa on top.  We felt like it was missing something though so next time we're taking others advice and adding some refried beans and black olives.

I have made this recipe quite a few times...figured it was about time I leave a review.  My 16 year old son loves this and at every potluck at our church, I am asked to make this.  The only things I changed were I use a 9 x 13 pan which works out great and I had copped Jalapeño peppers to give it a "kick" - I serve with Taco sauce on the side.  If you like Mexican dishes - this is a sure winner!

I make this with a few variations:  I mix the sour cream in with the seasoned ground beef.  I also add a can of drained diced mexican tomatoes (like Rotel) and some frozen corn.

If you're looking for a quick and easy dinner that even picky eaters will like, this is it. it does NOT need this much sour cream or chips. I made it a little healthier by using extra lean ground beef (or extra lean ground turkey), only an 8 ounce tub of light sour cream, and just 2 handfuls of tortilla chips, crushed. Add a few veggies like diced tomato and shredded lettuce, and it's great!

Excellent recipe.  We added a top to the pie, spreading another package of the crescent rolls across the top before baking the second time.  My kids devoured it.  Oh, and I only had a bag of mixed doritoes, sunchips and cheetos.  We crushed that mix and it tasted just fine.  My kids really enjoyed the crushing of the chips. Thanks!

I added toppings to this to make it a more complete meal and I just couldn't make it good enough for my family to like it.  The basic receipe just wasn't even enough to be good.

good but i changed this a little. i added 2 lbs hamburger, 1 packet taco seasoning, 1 8oz can of tomato sauce, no water and poured that mixture into a round 2 qt casserole dish having the crescent up 2 in on sides. topped with 2 cups mexi cheese and baked in oven at 350 for 40 minutes. it was great. you can make this ahead too and top with cheese right before cooking. i let everyone put on their own toppings

This was a huge hit at our dinner table last night!  I modified it slightly by using a couple of tips from the "Quick Crescent Taco Pie" recipe also on this website.  I used a pie plate instead of a square baking pan, and arranged the crescent triangles so that they fit nicely in the pie plate, and sprinkled some crushed Doritos on top of the baked crust before adding the meat.  I will definitely be making this again - in fact, my kids will probably request it again next week!

My husband I were a little concerned that this would be bland, but it wasn't.  He likes more spice and veggies than I do so on his side we layered peppers, tomatoes, and olives.  My side was made exactly according to the recipe.  We really liked it! It was a nice alternative to taco night and much less mess!  Thanks for a great and easy meal idea!

My husband really enjoyed this recipe.  My teenager said it was okay.  A whole bag of tortilla chips crushed for the top is hard to imagine.  I used about 1 cup, which was plenty.  You could also omit them entirely.  Used only 1 cup of low fat sour cream which was also plenty.  A 11x7 inch glass baking dish worked out fine.  Added salsa and some water to the meat because it looked very dry.  Topped with warm taco sauce, shredded lettuce and more sour cream after baking.  Will make again.

I'm giving this one 5 stars because it tasted good and was so easy.  Prepared it up until step #3 the night before.  After work the next day, took it out of fridge, let it warm to room temp (1/2 hour) and popped it in the oven for 15 or 20 minutes.  Served it with salsa and Spanish rice (Rice-a-Roni).  Thanks for a quick and easy weekday recipe!

This was fantastic.  It's every bit as tasty as a regular taco, but without the extra mess.  The crescent roll gives it a slightly sweet taste, which goes well with the taco sauce topping.  I used about 1/4 the recommended amount of chips because I thought it would be a bit overwhelming -- I think I'll add a tiny bit more next time, but not nearly the whole bag.
We'll definitely be making this one again.  It's inexpensive, easy to make, and easy to clean up!

this was very good....I did add 1/2 a can of refried beans to the meat as others suggested.  Also, only used 8oz sour cream...and a little bit less cheese than called for.  I used a 9 X 13 pan.  Use the spicier nachos as the topping....gives it more zip.  Crush the nachos up very finely...won't need quite the whole bag.  Black olives would have been good too, but I forgot them.

I didn't have much time in the kitchen tonight, so I was looking for something I could throw together as quickly as possible. This definitely fitted the bill, and I was surprised at how tasty it was. I sauteed some chopped onion with the ground beef, and used a 'Smokey Chipotle' flavored taco seasoning. I used mozzerella and extra-sharp cheddar because I didn't have Mexican cheese. The only thing I didn't much care for was the crescent roll base - it was a little too sweet. I would make this again but with a deep dish pie crust or maybe a pizza dough base. Great recipe. Thanks, Stephanie!

This recipe is easy, tasty and there are many options for the creative cook. My suggestions are (1)Use 9x13 pan sprayed with cooking spray (2) add 1 can of refried beans either with the ground beef or as a side sprinkled with cheese (3) Add 1 cup salsa (4) cut sour cream to 8 oz and drop by spoonfuls over beef before the cheese (5) Omit corn chips entirely. Will serve again.

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for a long time, but hesitated to make it because I wasn't sure about it.  When I finally cooked it, it was a success!  There were no leftovers the next day, and I was disappointed about that because I still wanted more.  I used half of the sour cream and mixed it with a can of refried beans before layering it.  I also added lettuce and tomatoes to the top after cooking it. This was delicious!  I will make this again soon. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was good. Next time I would use a larger pan to make sure the cresent rolls are done. With the smaller pan the cresent rolls were a bit chewey.

Great quick and easy dinner. I use a 9x13 baking dish. Only downfall not very good for leftovers the chips get chewy. But still an excellent recipe!

I'll be making this for years to come!!  I made my own taco seasoning mix (from this site, very easy and cost efficient) and added black olives to my half and jalepenos to my fiance's half. Also, I sauteed the ground beef with about a half a can of diced tomatoes w/ jalepeno's and added the rest on top of the beef mixture once it was in the pan.  This would be very good with a layer of Mexi-corn, too.  If you're planning of having leftovers, leave off the chips, as they get soggy.  I love sour cream, but I think next time, I'll just add it once it's on the table.  Thanks for an easy, tasty dinner :o)

This recipe was excellent!  I made it tonight for my boyfriend and his roommate, and it was a hit.  A few changes:  I used a 9x9 glass baking dish, for lack of a square cake pan.  I tore the cresent rolls apart and pressed them on the bottoms and on the sides, then added the ground beef up to the edge so the rolls would rise outside of the filling.  I also added some refried beans, and they tasted great.   I will be making this recipe again for sure!

Terrific! We like things a little spicey, so with the addition of some hot peppers, the kids and I devoured this dish! This was a great thing to serve on a busy dance night with my leftover taco meat. I topped it off with Fritos.  Super Stephanie and thanks!

I did not care for the taco seasoning in the meat but that is just how I am but it was very good everyone loved it. I thought it could use some olives and green onions it would just make it that much better.

I found this to be very simple.  My husband is very picky, so on half, I added the sour cream and even refried beans, and then just put the meat, cheese and chips on his half.  We both love it, and it even makes great leftovers!

This was a delicious meal that did not take long to prepare!!  I used the Kraft shredded four cheeses and Pillsburg cresent rolls.  My daughter turned her nose up when she saw me putting sour cream over the meat, begging me not to put it on.  I told her it was part of the recipe and put it on.  This child had 4 huge helpings of taco pie-she said that it was scrumptious!!  Thank-you for sharing!!

My husband loved this recipe.  I turned my serving into a taco salad and it was really good.  I am going to try and bake the crescent dough over the mixture next time, it was almost too done on the bottom.  With the toppings, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, etc. it is a great meal in one.

This recipe was fabulous.  It was both quick and easy to prepare and tasted great! As stated with previous reviews, I used a 9 x 13 baking dish instead of the square cake pan.  I also used only 1/2 of the sour cream that the recipe called for and then let each person put extra sour cream on it if they desired.

Absolutely delicious! I couldn't believe how something so simple can taste so good! I didn't put the sour cream in with the mixture, because I have picky kids who won't eat it. I served it as a garnish along with salsa, fresh tomatoes and shredded lettuce. I also used low fat crescent rolls, you won't notice a taste difference, but it cuts out a lot of fat! This will be a staple at our house! My husband couldn't stop raving about how good it was, and kept asking what was in it!

My wifes favorite dish! The BEST taco pie I have ever had!  A good variance is mixing in green chiles with the sour cream.  Chicken was a good substitute as well.

I too, planned to leave out the sour cream. But when I browned my beef, drained and rinsed it (try it for MUCH lower fat!) as I usually do, I realized the beef was then too dry to mix easily with the taco seasoning. So I added some ranch dressing to moisten it, and it turned out great. I used a 12x8 pan and the "crust" was almost too thick. I may use a bigger pan next time. But there will definitely be a next time. Served with lettuce, tomatoes, salsa and more ranch dressing. YUM!

By the second bite my husband was proclaming his love for this dish.  I did mix in a can of refried beans with the meat, and I think it helped in "holding" it together a little better.  I will definitly make this again and again.

I really enjoyed the Pie.  I kept the sour cream out until it was finished, and it turned out quite nicely--this way someone who doesn't want as much sour cream can put less on.  Tomatos and onion are also a great post-oven addition.  Great recipe!

This was a good recipe. I think next time I will add some poblano peppers into the meat mixture to add a little more flavor.  I also added some refried beans which added some extra flavor.  I will make this one again.

This was quick, easy, and yummy!  My 8-year-old daughter even ate it leftover, which 
almost never happens in our house!  I used a can of fat-free refried beans on the pre-
baked crust, then layered on the taco meat, cheese & tortilla chips (did NOT use an 
entire bag).  I left off the sour cream since my husband doesn't like it-- it was easy 
enough to add it to the pie after serving.  We served it with diced tomatoes and 
shredded lettuce.  Salsa would have been good, too, but we were out.  I'm making 
this for my parents soon, because my mother is always looking for easy, tasty dishes 
to add to the menu at their house.

I wasn't very pleased with this recipe the night I made it but the next day the leftovers seemed better.  That could just have to do with my taste though because my brother and sister-in-law liked it!

Definitly a 5 star recipe.  It only took  minutes to fix and was on the table in no time!  My husband and kids really liked it. I didn't use much sour cream--maybe 1/2 cup--16 oz would have been WAY to much!  I also added some black olives and kidney beans.  We topped it with tomatoes, lettuce and salsa. It was great.

This was a big hit with my five year old daughter and surprisingly with my 88 year old grandmother! I added refired beans for extra texture and added cumin and chili powder to the meat for added spice.

This recipe was so easy and very delicious. My husband loved it and said I can make it for him anytime I want.  I mixed some salsa in with the hamburger/taco seasoning mix, which spiced it up a little (but not too much).  Wonderful dish

This is very good. I used a larger pan and 1 1/2 pounds of ground round with 1 1/2 packages of seasoning mix. I added a litlle water to mix after draining beef. I will reduce sour cream a bit next time.  I will make again.

This was terrific!  I browned some diced onions with the meat.  I spread a think layer of refried beans on the baked crescent roll then added the meat, sour cream, lettuce, diced tomatoes,  cheese and topped with tortilla chips.  I will make this recipe again!

Super quick & very easy to make.  A great change from regular old "taco night".  I would probably add diced onions as I brown the beef next time though.

Excellent!!  This was very easy to prepare and turned out very yummy.  Everyone,
including my picky 6 year old, loved this one.  I added olives to the topping, but
you could very easily add other stuff like salsa, lettuce and tomtoes.  I will 
definately be making this one again.  This one is a keeper!

This is definitely one of my new favorites!  I made it for a small gathering of friends, added a layer of refried beans before the meat, and cut the sour cream in half, it was a hit!  Very easy to make, and excellent to heat up as left-overs!

Tried this recipe last night.  Absolutely a hit with all. I cut the recipe in half. The crescent rolls by Philsbury come in small cans of 4 and it works perfect for feeding 4 people. After baking I put chopped up lettuce and tomatoes on top.  Added a jello salad and the meal was ready.Got home at 5:20 and we were eating at 6:00pm

This recipe was so yummy and very easy to make. We invited my Mother for dinner and she took a copy of the recipe home with her. The kids thought it was great also.  I added a can of refried beans on top of the baked crescent rolls before adding the seasoned beef mixture and it tasted wonderful.  Tasted  great the next day as well.

Awesome recipe.  I used refried beans and left the olives out.  I didn't use all the sour cream it called for, I just spread it across the meat mixture until it was completely covered.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

This was a quick and easy meal that 3 of out of 4 of us liked (unbelievable with my picky family--the 2 yo wouldn't even taste it, but he's not a fan of cheese).  Next time I'd probably skip the crushed chips and maybe add some tomatoes and avocado to half.  My husband gobbled this up as leftovers with a little salsa and a flour tortilla shell.

I thought it had a little too much cheese, but my son and husband loved it. My husband actually made the dish, so you know it's easy! He also topped his with salsa for a little kick. Quick and easy pleaser for the whole family.

It was okay. I like my version better. I use flour tortilas layerd in it and leave out the chips. My 11 year old daughter did not like so I won't be making again. Thanks anyway.

This dish was extremely easy to prepare and quite good!  I think it could use less sour cream/cheese though.  It was definitely worth a try.

Would definitely make it again!

We loved it!  
Went through the reviews and made changes according to other posters.  The greatest thing about this recipe is that it is completely changeable to each families liking.
I used original flavor rolls, lined an ungreased metal 9-x13 pan.  Next time, will grease the pan first.  Cooked almost all the way until done.  Added chopped onions to meat mixture and added meat and sour cream together instead of doing separate and added refried beans as a layer and topped with lettuce after it came out of the oven.  Changes I will make going forward - grease the pan, add salsa mixed in with beans, and possibly a thin layer of sour cream to help make it moist.  My personal changes aside, this was a great recipe and my family of 5 ate almost the entire 9x13 pan for dinner.

I used my square glass cake dish - I really had to fit in the dough for some much dough, but it made it.  I was really surprised that we could just brown the beef & put into the taco mix with no water, but it was great.  Everything  was great & we used our tomatoes, avocadoes, & chopped black olives - it was great!  When I make it again, I'll get the foil cake pan - hopefully it is larger than the glass dish!

Family loved it.  Easy to put together. Video show that you spray your pan. That was not in The written directions.  If you follow baking directions from the crescent dough carton,  you bake at 375 degrees for 12 mins.  Then you set your oven to 350 degrees to cook your pie. Next time I'll do this with chicken and add onions. Otherwise very tasty. Someone my want to add salt/pepper or salsa. 
We will have it again.

pretty good! hubs thought it was too much sour cream and there's NO WAY a whole 14 oz bag of chips would fit.  but it was quick and easy and you can easily add chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, or whatever you like.

hubby and I loved it - the kids also liked it but didn't eat much, claiming it was too filling. that said, I also made several alterations based on other reviews I read. 
First, I didn't double-layer the dough but instead ran it up the sides of the pan as well (I also sprayed the pan first). Next, I only used 6-8oz of sour cream, and I mixed it in with the cooked meat rather than layering it on top of the meat. (maybe I'd try it the intended way sometime?) I only used ~4oz of tortilla chips, and can't imagine using more than 7oz. Last, after baking it the second time, I did throw on another handful of cheese and popped it back in just enough to start being melty. It cut well with a brownie server. I liked topping it with salsa and green onions, but also had additional sour cream, tomatoes, and diced onions available.

My family really enjoyed this meal!  I sautéed onion and bell peppers with the meat and added a layer of black beans.  I also crumbled Queso Fresco over the finished pie.

My very picky kids LOVED it!!! They loved it so much that they named it Mom's Famous Taco Pie. (Everything they love becomes "Mom's Famous..." ) lol. I swear they think I just make these great meals up!
Anyway, I didn't change anything about it. Thanks for sharing!!

It’s perfect for a quick dinner that makes everyone happy.  Easy to make and delicious.  I added a can of Hanover bean and corn salsa to the beef along with some diced onions.  Chopped up some fresh cilantro for the top after it was finished.

Husband said it was ok. He didn't really think the chips on top were good. He said it was amateur but what's funny is that he had a 2nd helping of that. I thought it was good.

Looked at this one before & passed.  It just seemed like kind of a lot fat.  Oh well, it's good! So maybe use 2% cheese, light sour cream & less of it. Low fat cresent rolls. Next time I might add some rice & beans.  I had  a little bit of chorizo and used that with the ground beef, some cooked chopped onion & a small can of tomato sauce.  Some chopped lettuce & avocado.  My family liked it.

I subbed two items: I used ground venison and Doritos.  I've made a similar recipe before does not have you pre-bake the crust and that has a layer of Doritos over the crust and on the top.  I prefer it that way. This is good though.

This recipe makes a lot you will have leftovers if  your  only feeding only 2 people. I did take the suggestions on adding  a can of  Rotel  lime and cilantro and 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1/2 can of refried Beans in with my turkey meat!  It was very moist. I used Pillsbury pizza crust and it was really filling. I used a Pyrex rectangle  dish remember to spray your Pyrex or crust will stick.  You will have leftovers. I give it a 4 cause it’s not a healthy recipe but it’s ok once in awhile.

When I add my taco seasoning, I like to add water and then add a can of drained/rinsed black beans and a drained can of drained sweet corn. Let that simmer the liquid off, then continue with recipe. I also put cheese on top of my tortilla chips...So many options!

Quick and easy and delicious.  I'd definitely recommend not cooking the dough all the way the first time you put it in,  cut it a few minutes short and then when you bake it the second time it should come out perfect in the end.  Also,  the amount of chips it calls for is way too much in my opinion,  I just put a nice thin layer of the chips on top and it was perfect,  excellent recipe.  Thank you!

This was a family pleaser. My 8 year old grandson said it’s in his top ten favorites. I tweaked the recipe by cutting the sour cream to 8 oz & mixing 1/2 can of refried beans. I also added 3/4 cup of water to the ground beef after adding the taco seasoning.

It was good and hearty.  But it was like taco salad... I would add pico de gallo or salsa... maybe some avocados.  I'm not a cook... and this was so easy!

The kids and I didn't like this dish. The sour cream over powered the taco taste. It was too salty and the chips sprinkled over the top just made a mess while trying to eat it and take it out oft the baking pan. I won't be making this again.

I made this last night. It was fantastic! My son wasn’t sure about the sour cream but ended up loving it. Only change (sorry) was that I added some diced onion and celery to the ground beef and only because I already had them. This was easy to make and loved by all. It’s a keeper. Thank you

Quick and easy. I think it needs a little more meat, and other toppings would have enhanced the flavor. But it was good with just the ingredients  that was used.

I wanted to keep it true to name sake so instead of lining a cake pan or casserole dish I used a 9" OXO pie pan. I kept this recipe health conscious and and used turkey instead of beef  and added taco fixings (cabbage, olives, pico de gallo, etc). 

I would make this again; this is the perfect recipe for a last minute dinner idea. All the ingredients are kept on hand at all times so no unnecessary planning or extra groceries needed.

It tasted amazing but was  very dry and not really saveable to the next day.  If you make it - eat it today!  I would suggest throwing some juicy pintos or refrieds in and add some diced tomatoes on top before serving.  It was fun to make and of course the kids thought it was awesome after they put salsa on it!

My wife loved it.  Like most reviewers, I added retried beans and some diced fresh tomatoes.  You can’t go wrong with this recipe.  The next time I will not be using crescent dough to help out with the calories.  I think making it without the dough and just cutting it and laying it on a bed of lettuce shreds would be a healthy alternative

This was really good. I made it following the original recipe, no changes. Thinking of adding a bean dip layer before the sour cream? It came to me while I was enjoying it. We'll see. I envision many variations on this theme.

This was simple  and quick to make but a bit dry.  When I make it again, and I will, I will add tomatoes.  I think it was probably dry because I did not use beef, I used a vegetarian substitute.

DeeeeLish! We added fresh corn cut off the cob to make it stretch and add some Mexican authenticity . Next time we want to add a fresh jalapeno for a little bite and maybe a light drizzle of lime juice. You can add whatever makes you happy to the meat, we can't wait to try it again!

The beauty of this recipe is that you can make one or two changes to suit your taste without really changing the basic taste of the pie. I followed recipe, using a 9X13 pan, added 1 can of Rotell tomatoes and green chilis, a 1/2 cup chopped onion, and 1 cup of corn to the filling. Baked the crust as stated for 11 minutes, reduced the heat to  350 degrees,added the filling, cheese, and corn chips, about two cups, crushed. After letting cool for 5 minutes, it cut perfectly We topped ours with lettuce, tomatoes, and the sour cream.( I am not a fan of warm sour cream, though it probably is good in this recipe.) You can add whatever ingredients you prefer to your liking, but this is still a great start to an easy meal, therefore, I rated it 5 stars.

Really good but it needs a bigger pan.  I eat alot and 2 slices was more than enough. If you spread the dough out a little and add extra toppings like hot peppers olives mabey salsa it would be awsome.  I will be trying it againg but using a bigger pan.

The crossaint dough was bit much and made the dish a bad American version of what should have been a great south of the border casserole.  It was easy but nothing special.

The crescent rolls stuck to the bottom of the pan so were essentially worthless.  Flavor wasn't very exciting.  Probably won't make again as written.

Made this last night, the outcome was delicious. I followed the recipe with the addition of a small amount of diced sautéed onions. I also added a layer of chili beans on top of the meat layer.not sure my additions made the dish better.

I thought this was going to taste amazing judging by the pictures but it was really bland. I ate it with salsa and it was still lacking in taste. It taste like it’s missing something.

This was wonderful. I used salsa, garlic, cumin, and adobo seasoning to spice the beef since I didn't have a packet of taco seasoning and cut back on the sour cream by half (just a personal preference).  I will be making it again and hopefully I will purchase ALL the ingredients for it next time.

I'd definitely make again, but would leave in the oven longer because although the cheese was melted, the sour cream was still too cold.  Also cut back in the tortilla chips - seemed like way too many.  Also not enough for 3 adults and 2 kids so I would double it next time.

It was delicious and there was enough for the 2 of us to have 3 meals.  The only thing i would do differently is i wouldn't use a whole package of t aco seasoning. I felt it was just too much. I will make it again.

We really loved this. I admit to having added some onion and jalapeno to the beef mixture, and I also used some flavored chips on top instead of plain, but the end result was pure comfort food goodness, so I'm still giving the original recipe 5 stars.

I made one change:  Mixed one can of refried beans with 1 cup sour cream.  Other than that, I made this exactly as directed.  I used an 11 x 7 metal pan and baked the crescent rolls just until the top of the crust started to turn golden.  After the whole casserole was done, the crust wasn't too done and it wasn't soggy.  If your crust is soggy, area you adding salsa or some other liquid to the meat?  that may be why.  For the taco seasoning, I used the recipe on this site called "Taco Seasoning I" by Bill Echols.  That stuff is awesome..  Thanks for this recipe!

This a great quick meal during the week.  The only things I did differently is I used a fold-out pie crust and I do not like taco seasonings, so I seasoned the meat with chili powder, garlic and onion powder.  Was delicious.  Pilsbury and Publix have good pie crusts near the canned biscuits.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this recipe as it's listed, however, I did heed the advice of another cook who removed the crescent roll from the oven 2-3 minutes earlier then the listed instructions on the package.

I used to eat this as a kid but my mom couldn't find her recipe. This recipe is just how I remember it! We used Guacamole instead of sour cream because my husband is anti-sour cream, but I bet it would have been great with it! Everyone in the family enjoyed this recipe and it was super easy to make.

This was very tasty. I used flour tortillas instead and used a round cake pan. It's very messy so be prepared but it is easy enough and fun to make.

Simple, but excellent recipe. I always substitute french onion dip for sour cream in nearly every recipe. It gave this recipe the right kick. I also used Jack'd Doritos as the topping as opposed to regular tortilla chips. I've made this recipe a few times and the kids always love it.

Pretty good.   The only change I made, per other suggestions, was sauteed onion while cooking the meat and adding black refried beans to the sour cream.  My husband said it was even better the second day warmed up.  Thanks for sharing a quick/easy recipe.

Turned out really well!  Added Ro-tel and did not fold the dough into a 9" pan like the video.  I had extra meat so I made in  a 13 x9...  I do like the versatility of this recipe and will make it again in the future.  Reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is because I haven't decided yet if I like the sweet taste of the dough and I feel like the original recipe should have added another ingredient or two.

Followed the recipe almost exactly as written. I used crescent sheet and it fit perfectly in a greased 13x9 glass dish. Baked at 375? for 13 minutes as instructed on the container. Then came the meat mixture, drizzled with taco sauce, sour cream, Mexican cheese, and taco flavored Doritos. Tasted good and definitely see the ability to play with this recipe some. I cannot comment on my family's thoughts, they were eating leftovers.

Seemed more like a snack than a dinner, and I just didn't like it much. I added some salsa but it still seemed too plain. My husband liked it, though, so I may try it again with more toppings.

Kids really liked.  I used 8x8....would use larger next time and make layers thinner.  however i doubled the crescent rolls on each other and cooked for 9 min and kids loved that.  Put 1 lb ground beef, 8 oz sour cream mixed with can of refried beans (too much sour cream), layer of cheese and then crushed tortilla chips.  Love the thick "crust" but needed thinner layers.

**used two cans of crescent rolls in 9x12 pan, put in oven for 10 minutes.  Mixed can of refried beans, with one lb of taco meat and 4-6 oz of sour cream and covered with bag of cheese.  Put in oven for 8-10 min.  Was very good.

The flavors were good for this dish but I think what threw me off is the croissant and crushed chips. I think this recipe would be really nice with cornbread as the bottom layer.

Very good recipe, will make it again. I would suggest getting unsalted tortilla chips, though. Regular store-bought ones make it way too salty.

We really enjoyed this dish.  It was super easy to prepare, quick to put together, & an easy cleanup.  The only additions made were sautéed onions in the meat & a layer of lime salsa.  Very nice!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars for simplicity, tastiness (is that a word?), and customization. I have most of these ingredients on hand so this is an easy weeknight supper if I forgot to plan ahead or it's a busy night.  This can be customized to how your family likes tacos - sour cream, salsa, beans, corn, etc.

Great recipe...I added a layer of refried beans, white onions, fresh cilantro, olives and salsa.  I cooked the crescent roll layer all the way through.  My daughter and her cousin loved it!  They went for seconds! :)  Oh, I mixed the ground beef and the sour cream. I used about half the sour cream.

Very good and easy to make. I added thinly sliced Pepper Jack cheese after substituted  ground pork for the ground beef. After the layer of refried beans I added a layer of white American Cheese. This is a great potluck dinner recipe and also great the next day after it sits and all the flavors meld together.

The recipe was pretty good. Using the whole taco seasoning package overwhelmed the dish. I added onion and mild salsa to the beef but it didn't diminish the intensity of the taco seasoning. It is an easy dish and gets to the table quickly but, I don't think I will make it again.

My 13 year old made this as his first time making dinner for the family. We needed to make the recipe Gluten Free as two of us are Celiac. He used corn bread as the base instead of the Pillsbury rolls. It was fantastic! We were a little short on sour cream so we added in a bit of cream cheese. After adding the tortilla chips, we covered with foil, baked for about 10 mins. then added the cheese and baked for an additional 5 mins. YUMMY!!!

Just made this tonight. My family really liked it. I also added onions in my hamburger, but I always do. Easy and different from the usual. Will definitely make again and will add to my dinner rotation! Btw if my family would let me I'd love to make with rotel and add some jalapeño with the meat..but I'd be the only one who would eat it. Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved this! I added a small onion to the meat along with a small can of green Chile and a can of diced tomatoes .
Will definitely make again! I'm sure it would be great adding additional toppings. My son and I added Avocado with ours.

Tried this because it was easy-looking and simple ingredients.  Ok but not too sure about the crescent roll bottom crust.  Too sweet and didn't really mix well with the other flavors IMO.

It was easy, quick, and fairly cheap to make (less than 20$). Slight changes/tips i would give is next time i'll put less cheese and more sour cream (i only used 8oz). The excess cheese made it slightly salty. I used el paso taco season and it was great tasting. After i cooked the ground beef i drained the meat and then added the taco seasoning. When you cook the crescent rolls dont cook it all the way thru i suspect that it'll burn. I cooked mine for 7 minutes or so. Overall I was pleased with the outcome.

My  kids actually liked this one and ate it! I added a layer of refried beans on top of the crescent rolls and before the beef, then sour cream, then topped with Nacho Cheese Doritos instead of regular tortilla chips. It was good! Definitely not healthy, but nice to have a crowd pleaser with the little ones. :)

I thought the dishwas OK. I baked the crescent in a 9x13 inch pan until golden brown. I used 1 lbs of ground beef which was  not enough. You need at least 1.5 lbs - 2 lbs to cover the dish well.

This recipe is awesome, and easy to put together. You can add more ingredients if you like! My family loves this recipe, I've made it many times! So much flavor! I used tortilla shells in mine! It is very filling! Thanks for posting it.

This is my first review. I've found other's reviews to be helpful and thought I should contribute.  Made this for Cinco De Mayo and it was great. You could obviously add any of your favorite taco toppings to change this up a bit. Only thing I changed was to add some chopped onion to the meat mixture and use slightly less sour cream (3/4 container) and nacho chips (about 8 oz.)  My wife and I both loved it.  As was suggested, this IS very filling. Will definitely be making this again.

Followed the recipe except I drained the fat from the hamburger and added water just to mix  it through the meat.  This is a lot of food  for two people . We will have plenty for another night . This is a keeper! Next time I will half the recipe!

I was in a rush all of a sudden and had to come up with something quick where I could use the ground beef. Surprisingly I had all ingredients at hand and so it was a great quick choice, where I felt I couldn't go too wrong.
First thing that came to my mind was to add corn. I thought about onions later on, but I was too much in a rush. But what I like most is that you don't really need a recipe for it, ingredients are so simple and easy down to earth to remember.  Will share and make it again!

This is a difficult one to rate since my husband really enjoyed it but I did not. Having said that, here are some observations: 
• be aware that the crescent roll crust is very sweet;
• if you prefer a less heavy, oily taste, perhaps try using light sour cream instead of the 14% fat version that I used;
• definitely bake the crescent roll crust for the FULL time period suggested on the package (12 to 15 minutes) before adding the filling;
• consider adding some chopped tomatoes to the meat mixture;
• serve with a spicy Salsa.

As others have said, perfect base to branch off of. Looking forward to trying other ways to layer this dish. I used half the sour cream (light) and half the cheese, added olives and salsa. Exactly the kind of mid-week meal my family needs. Thank you!

Great and  easy recipe!! The calories are a bit high... For anyone that is cutting calories... I removed the chips and sour cream. This brings the recipe down to about 365 calories per serving (8).  Much better.  I figured for those who prefer sour cream can put it on the side.  turned out great!!

so....I tweaked it, to my taste. I dont need the flack on rating and changing, im not giving negative feedback. It was very good! will def make again. I added some dried chopped onion to the beef while cooking. After hamburg was cooked I added the taco seasoning and water as stated, I also added a cup of salsa and a 1/4 cup taco sauce. I simmered for about 10 min while the cressant crust was cooking (I have a gas stove and 11 minutes on 375 worked great) I then turned the oven to 350 while I was putting the hamburg mixture on the crust. I put on a package of mexi blend cheese, then spooned on about 8 onces of sour cream then put on 1/2 bag of crumbled tortilla chips. baked for 10 minutes.....when I cut the piece I ate out I threw on a little salsa and a little more sour cream. Will deff make again

This is great as is - I adjusted the sour creme down. I used corn chips instead as that's what I had on hand. We topped with La Victoria Taco sauce, served with a tossed green salad and corn. Delicious!

This became an instant favorite. I'm not a big fan of taco's, but I made it for my boyfriend. We both absolutely loved it. I added a layer of Refried beans for extra flavor! It's delicious, a must have!

Cooked just as written. It was just too much sour cream and cheese for me. My wife loves it the way it was. If I did cook again I would cut back on the sour cream and about half the cheese. After reading some of the reviews about crescent roll crust being over cooked I used a glass dish which made the crust turn out perfect.

Very good and easy. I doubled the recipe but only added 16 oz sour cream instead of the 32 oz it called for. It was just right. I think 32 oz would have been too much. I will be making this recipe again. The kids and hubby liked it. :)

My husband is a vegetarian so I used vegetarian sausage patties instead of ground beef. I sautéed two onions with the patties, broke them up and then added my homemade Taco seasoning (super easy to make). I also used Immaculate Buttermilk biscuits, rolled them out w a rolling pin to make the crust. They were delish!!! I loaded the onion and crumble mixture on top of the biscuits (after baking them) then I blended plain yogurt and  cream cheese in the vitamix and put that on top.  Finally I crushed some Food Should Taste Good multigrain tortilla chips and put some of my cheddar and Monterrey jack cheese blend then more cheese on top - I added a little Gouda to my blend. Heated it in the oven for 10 minutes and viola! I fed 13 ppl with not one bite left! It was a huge hit. Am so glad I found this recipe!

It was delicious!  I added chopped onions and red peppers and used Tex Mex cheese and Doritos Nacho Chips for extra flavour.  For a quick, tasty meal that's not particularly healthy (although you could tweak the ingredients to improve that), it's wonderful!

Fantastic! The pickiest husband on the planet loved it! I made a slight adjustment ( cut back on the beans & sour cream).  I used the chips lightly, more like a garnish. I served it with chopped lettuce, toms, onions, a big bowl of fresh guac. and corn bread. Thank you Stephanie!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great. A quick and easy meal. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe and topped it with shredded lettuce, salsa, and black olives. The only thing I would recommend is the recipe states use a square cake pan, this doesn't work because the crescent dough is rectangle so I would suggest using a 9x13 baker.

Oh, em, gee. This was DELICIOUS! Like all those other incredibly obnoxious people, I tweaked the recipe a teensy bit - added onion, a LOT more meat, a dash of garlic salt, and eased up on the chips. The result was awwwwwesome. I would've wanted more sour cream to better compliment the extra meat, but my boyfriend and daughter loved it the way it was. Will DEFINITELY make again - regularly! :)

I've been making this for my son since he was little (he's 16 now & still requests!). However, ours is a little different: use fritos for the topping b/c we've tried other chips and  it's just way better! You can easily make your own taco seasoning w/out buying the little packets and it's just as good. Mostly chilli powder (lots of) and some salt, pepper, onion, garlic, cumin, oregano or Italian, etc.  My advice is to keep tasting, or have your kid taste, the seasoned ground beef til it's perfect for y'all.

OMG, comfort food at its finest! I needed to make some changes: used ground chicken as I don't eat beef. Since I had only a 9x9" square pan I got away with not using 16oz of sour cream, just 8oz. Also to make it a tad healthier, I added a layer of black beans, corn and chopped tomato. Next time I'll throw in some chopped jalapeno before spreading the sour cream and shredded cheddar. Having read other reviewer's suggestions, I also used low salt tortilla chips - I wanted a crispier topping so after baking, I browned the casserole under the broiler (low) for a couple of minutes. DELICIOUS!

Definitely a keeper was very good. I would add salsa to it but some family members don't like that. I had it on the side.

I made this several months ago for my mom and 97 year old grandma.  They loved it.  I'm working on filling a freezer for them so they don't have to buy groceries or cook.  I'm definitely going to include this one in their rotation.  I would note that if my family were eating it I would add some more spice.  Seemed kind of bland to me.

This was so stupidly easy and fast, I was quite happy!  One of my kids has a lactose sensitivity, so we left off the sour cream, but my husband just scooped some on top of his dish and that worked fine.  We also added refried beans- I blended the cheese in the beans and melted in the microwave, then added it on top of the meat.  I think the recipe may have intended flavored chips, like a Doritos, but I just used regular old tortilla chips, and not many of them, but that was just because the family broke into them before the day assigned this recipe, haha.  Honestly, though, I liked it better like this, as it tasted like "real" food, not the sort of processed flavorings, if that makes any sense.
Thanks for posting such a family-friendly, fast and easy recipe, it will be a staple for us all school year!

My family loved this. I made it exactly as written and it turned out perfect. Very yummy. I had to put 2 layers of crescent rolls because it came with 4 triangles. Baked it for 10 minutes, added the meat, sour cream, shredded cheese and crushed Doritos on top. Bake for 10 more minutes. Awesome! Thank you!

This turned out great! I think my son will like it too. I added hot salsa over the layer of ground beef and chopped green onions over the sour cream. I may add diced green chilies next time too, I like some heat!

This is so good and easy to tweek using your favorite Mexican ingredients. I use butter flavor crescent rolls and don't notice any sweetness that a few reviewers complained about.

Simple and easy to make. As a suggestion from another review would probably cook without sour cream. Instead a layer of your favorite salsa for zing. Then top off with sour cream, lettuce, tomato, etc.

This recipe is great the way it is! I have made this recipe many times over because the bf always asks if I can make it. I have done a few changes that I would recommend that adds a bit of flavor even though it doesn't necessarily need it. I have fried an onion and garlic with the beef and also I use nacho cheese tortilla chips instead of the plain ones which I prefer. You also don't need all the sour cream that the recipe states, I only use half a container which is plenty. I also mix the sour cream in with the ground beef and taco seasoning which makes it so much easier to layer. I also recommend cutting this and taking out the pieces and then adding the toppings individually, not only does it make it easier to store but also saves the toppings from falling off and losing most of it!! I make this in a 13"x9" pan and use 1.5 lbs. of ground beef because we eat this up because it is sooo delicious! Two hands up!!

This was a quick and easy dinner.  All four of us liked it 2 adults, 2 kids (11).  Finished the pan.  I did not put sour  cream on before baking, but served it in the side along with salsa.  I tossed chopped tomatos over the cheese before baking, omitted the crushed chips, then added shredded lettuce when it came out of the oven.  Next time I will add a layer of retried beans and include done onion when browning the meat.

Very easy recipe. It was a big hit with my family. The baking dish I used was not deep enough to hold all of the ingredients so I backed off a bit on the sour cream (Used about 10 oz). Not much left, just enough for lunch tomorrow.

Had this last night and finishing the leftovers tonight! Everyone loved the dish. I added chopped broccoli for a vegetable. Only suggestion is cooking in bigger pan. I used a glass 8x8 and it was overflowing. Should have used a 13x9 but again I added broccoli so that took up some room. I also used low fat cheese, sour cream, and crescent rolls with no difference in taste.

I made this a few years ago. We used cheese Doritos for the chips. We also added a tsp of taco seasoning to the meat and added taco sauce as one of the layers as well. Super delicious. My daughter (she was 4 at the time) even ate it for breakfast .

Made this as the recipe stated, but reduced the sour cream and added green onion and fresh chopped tomatoes for serving.  Kids had 2 helpings, so I would make this again.  My stonewear baking dish made the crust come out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe and suggestions!

Easy to make. I added black beans and used ground turkey to make it slightly more healthy... but only slightly. Aldo added sliced black olives, tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce to the top.

I did almost the same thing but I added cream cheese to my meat mixture and put a layer of refried beans on top of the crescent rolls before the meat. My group loved it.

I was so looking forward to this casserole. I don't know what I did wrong, I followed the recipe exactly w/the exception of adding a few jalapenos.  I found it to be very dry, and if I hadn't added the jalapenos it wouldn't have had much flavor.  I would have preferred to have regular tacos, or the version of this dish w/flour tortillas instead of the crescent rolls.

This was amazing. Though I would add more meat, and 1/2 cup of tomatoes. It was very delicious though. Everybody went back for thirds.

My husband and his hunting buddies really enjoyed this!  It became a late dinner when they bagged an elk. It was good to me but I knew it was a hit when they had seconds and thirds!!

I changed the recipe. Used an 8" by 11" glass dish sprayed with pam.
Then mixed the browned ground beef with 1 can rotel tomatoes with chilies, and put that on the bottom. Then mixed 1 can refried beans with green chiles with 2 heaping tablespoons sour cream and spread that on top of the meat. It can be warmed a little if necessary to spread easier.  Then drained a can of whole kernel corn, and put that on top. Then added 8 oz. of shredded sharp cheese.  I baked it 10 mins, and then put foil on the top for another 15-20 mins. to heat everything through to the center. I had bowls of sour cream, and chopped black olives for toppings.  I served it with yellow round nacho chips to scoop it up.  Incredible dish!  Very similar to tacos but so much easier to prepare ahead of time, and put in the oven at last minute and have just one dish that stays hot.  I had a can of Pillsbury refrigerated Artisan whole grain pizza dough, which I baked on a sprayed dark cookie sheet ahead of time, and my husband enjoyed putting the mixture on that bread.  I will make this often.

Pretty good a little different from your regular taco.  Kids enjoyed and had seconds when dad got home. Sides: Rice and Beans

I might like it paired with some hot sauce next time for a little wetness.

Excellent! I didn't have regular chips so I cut the taco spice in half and used crushed Takis' on top and it added just the right kick. Thank you.

This was very good but I only gave it 4 stars because IMHO it needed a tweak or two. Used an 8x8 pan, sprayed. Cooked the dough for 11 minutes. I added a layer of canned black beans after the sour cream. It didn't take anywhere near as many crushed tortilla chips as the recipe calls for. And how can you bake it until the cheese melts when you can't see the cheese because it's under all those chips? I cooked it for about 18 minutes and then let it sit for a bit. Then cut it into 6 pieces and ate it. Very good. I think a little salsa on top would be yummy. And I think I'll use the spicy taco seasoning next time. I did not add the water (that the taco season package calls for) just added the seasoning. The recipe doesn't say to add the water and I think it would have made it mushy.

Made a double batch of this for two adults and four kids. One as the recipe states. The second with just the crescent roll dough, meat, and cheese. Both were quite tasty and received well by the whole crew! Tasted good reheated as well. Will be making this one again, it's a good recipe!

So I used leftover taco meat from Taco Tuesday.  The only thing I added was diced fresh tomatoes.  Oh and I totally didn't get the doritos.  I thought I was just supposed to be tortilla chips.  This is so weirdly good that I will be making it again.  Some people complained the crescents were soggy.  I over baked them just a bit and then set it out on the counter to "set up".  Worked great.  No sogginess.  On a leftover night try this!

Really good recipe that you can add any ingredient to.. I took Justjen33`s advice and added a couple extras and mixed the sour cream into the meat mixture and the family loved it. Also Very easy to make. Will make again! Amazing mixed in a salad to make taco salad.

This was a big hit with DH!  Based on other reviews, I added some fire roasted green chilies and onions and reduced sour cream and crushed chips, but this is a very good basic recipe we'll make again.
Thanks so much for sharing, Stephanie!

I hate missing an opportunity to add veggies to something, especially when the family won't even notice.  I doubled the recipe into a 9x13 pan, added a chopped onion when I was browning the beef, and added a can of drained diced tomatoes when adding the taco seasoning.

I make this a lot but I use the tortillas, I really don't like the taste of those canned biscuits. It is much more tasty with the tortillas.And despite "neo" worrying about the "food police", I for one am grateful for the reviews and helpful hints! Thanks to all who take the time to add their own tweaks! I used the taco seasoning packet and added refried beans as one of the layers and lots os cheese and lots of sour cream....YUMMMMM...DELISH!!

my husband and son loved this!! two big helpings each!! I did tweek the recipe some--first, as another reviewer suggested I cooked the crescent dough as directed. I mixed the taco mix and a couple hefty spoonfuls of salsa while cooking the meat,(smelled great). I added a layer of whole  kernel corn on the taco mixture, then sour cream, then the salsa (from the opened jar, all the cheese, and enough crushed Doritos to make a top layer. even though they are not good leftover eaters, they are already discussing whether to have it later tonite or for dinner tomorrow. This was simple to make and sooooo easy to layer together (husband not a fan of black olives, son not a fan of refried beans) but this was an absolute BIG hit. absolutely will make again (likely soon). Positively a keeper for me!

This was a big hit, even with the picky eaters in the family. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it. I did find out that if you double the recipe, you dont need to double the chips. ;) I will definitely make this again.

The directions kind of puzzled me on this one. It said lay rolls flat on the bottom of a SQAURE pan but they didn't fit evenly. I cut it to fit with a little up on all four sides. But didn't spread because it didn't say that. Did blend edges together though. Baked until golden brown and it came out rather puffy. Accidently bought "cheesy" taco seasoning, but figured it would be ok. Mixed half the cream cheese into the beef as well since there was so much! by the time I got to adding the crushed chips there was hardly any room left in pan and did less than the directions called for. Just enough to cover. And crushed pretty well. Baked whole thing for 10 min and it came out smelling great-like toasted chips. Looking at the recipe this is only four servings and it is a TON!
This is basically nachos. With the amount of cheese and cream cheese, this was very rich! I added chopped tomatoes and that seemed to be better. I think it definitely needs some balancing out with tomatoes, lettuce, and avocado. The refried beans would be a good adjustment too. Like a 7 layer salad. 
Next day: I could not stop eating this as leftovers-no additional ingredients! It was much better than yesterday! I will make this again!

This is an easy, delicious, and HEAVY recipe! I was cooking for a total of 4 people including myself and it made just enough. I probably could have doubled the recipe and it would have been finished, but I chose to accompany it with a mix of fresh greens and vegetables to counterbalance to richness of the dish. It tastes fantastic, but definitely not a "diet-friendly" dinner option. I seasoned the beef myself with chopped red onion, green onion, minced garlic, cayenne pepper, chili powder, salt, pepper, and red chili flakes. Came out great! This is a fun recipe because I feel as though you can tweak it and add to it as much as you'd like without the risk of failure. It's a good framework of a dish and can be altered in so many ways.

I added some canned chipotle chiles, black beans and tomatoes to the meat and covered the bottom with refired beans which made it more flavorful and spicy. My family loved this dish, I will make this again for sure! Thanks for sharing

This was a good pie!  Easy to make, and tasted it's best right out of the oven.  We added lettuce, tomato, and sour cream on top.

Not bad, but the recipe calls for too much sour cream in my opinion. Also, I may use tortillas next time, both for the bottom and I might layer them. The rolls are high in fat, and a bit too flaky.

Liked it from the original recipe but have made some changes on subsequent tries.  I use a 9x13 instead of a square pan.  On top of the sour cream I put a layer of salsa.  The original recipe called for way too many chips so I use about 1/3 pkg crushed and it is perfect!

I was not a fan.  The kids liked it though.  I mostly didn't care for the crescent roll base.  If I'm going to make taco salad, next time, I'll just use a crispy taco salad bowl.

Delicous! I too used corn tortillas (no mush) instead of ground beef I used a chuck roast I crock potted overnight, using red Goya and green sauce, along with a few spice mixes I picked up in MX. Shredded it the next day and what a hit. We LOVE traditional Mexican food, and the taste of this comes very close.  Not concerned about trans fats, etc.  Gardening and landscaping should take care of those!

My family loved this as is, but I (of course) had to dink with it. If I'm going to make a casserole, I want it to be all I serve, so it needed some veggies. I mixed the sour cream in with the cooked meat, added a can of corn and a can of either diced tomatoes or rotel, depending on what I have. Layered that on the crescent roll crust, topped with cheese and baked. Served with guacamole and salsa--family asked for it again, so it's a keeper!

Hubby and i severly enjoyed this!! Would recommend undercooking crust before adding the rest of the recipe, and would certainly mix the sour cream/beef mixture before hand next time. I put a small zuccini in the food processer and cooked with the beef to add a practically undetectable hint of veggie to the recipe.  Will certainly make again.

This recipe is very easy with very low maintenance. It took pretty much about 30 minutes to make all together including the prepping time. I put in black beans and corn to add some ingredients of my own. Definitely a must try.

This was so delicious and easy. I appreciate a recipe and other reviews that allow me to tweek it to suit our tastes. My personal modifications were similiar to others except I used yogurt instead of the sour cream mixed with the seasoned hamburger mixture. That gave it a slightly sweet taste, but I balanced it with some  green chilies from a jar and a squeeze of Mexican seasoning in the tube. I topped that with 4 slices of cheddar cheese,taco sauce, and some crumbled taco chips as per recipe,then baked about 18 minutes. Thanks to the submitter for a really good and easy Mexican meal!

it was good. the first time I made it it turned out good. the second time I made it the bread rose up like a loaf of bread from the grocery store so that screwed me up. maybe I should have used a roller the make it flatter.

I made this exactly as posted. It was ok once cooked but even better reheated. I would wait to add the tortilla chips because if you reheat this, the chips are pretty rubbery.

We added black beans in place of shredded cheese, and also used crushed Doritos on the top layer. Kids had seconds, 2 nights in a row!!

I liked it but the kids loved it. I was easily able to use only half the sour cream, a little over half the cheese and a little over half the tortilla chips. Turned out well for a quick family meal.

This was very easy to make, but it was just ok.  I mixed together the ground beef and the sour cream to make it easier to spread.  I also doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 glass pyrex.

I read some other reviews and with the following changes was a 5 star in my book!  Added onions with beef, taco seasoning, half can rotel hot, cilantro rice, black beans, everything else was the same. Cooked the cresent rolls for about 9-10 minutes.

My husband LOVED this recipe! Yes... It's not near the top of the eat healthy food chain but if you watch the serving size, it's fine!  I always make recipes exactly as written the first time. You can always tweak it to your taste the next time you make it. So many possible combinations with this meal! Add lettuce and tomatoes, black olives, refried beans, serve with extra sour cream, salsa... go crazy and enjoy! I believe kids would enjoy this too!

This was a very good recipe.  The only change I would make next time is to put it all in an 11x7" dish, as there wasn't enough room to fit everything in a square pan.  Otherwise, it was very yummy and I will make it again (I also baked the crust for less time than it called for - about 10 minutes)!

I used Frito corn chips and used a layer of refried beans before adding meat mixture.  Didn't care for as far as next day left overs but what a hit for out of the oven dinner!  YUM  good with chopped olives

with a few teaks this turned out really good and the whole family liked it. I did not undercook the crust, I sauteed 2 types of onions, some garlic with a chopped yellow pepper. Added the seasoning to the meat with some black olives.Then added a thin layer of corn and a can of kidney beans. Used low fat sour cream, shredded Mexican blend cheese and crushed corn ships. Huge hit!

Very quick, easy Mexican style recipe. Family friendly, especially kid friendly. I will probably add tomatoes with green chilis or a jar of salsa but not because of taste enhancement...it tastes fabulous as is. I just like my Mexican sloppy! :)

Pretty good although it did seem kinda dry between the crescent dough and the chips.  It could use some more of a sauce/liquid component.

Fabulous recipe - just needed a little tweaking. Used an 9 x 13 pan, 1.5 lbs. of hamburger, mixed salsa into the hamburger before layering, spread a can of refried beans over the crust, sprinkled sliced green and black olives and chopped sliced jalapeños over the sour cream layer, used habanero shredded cheese.  Thought the amounts called for would over-flow an 8 x 8 pan. Easy, easy, easy and delicious!

Had to improvise as no crescent rolls available in NZ. Used corn bread
wraps to line the pie followed by cooked beef mince with taco seasoning. Next layer was refried beans (435g can) then a medium jar of salsa dip. Used low fat philadelphia cream but only a third of original recipe. Topped with broken corn chips & grated edam. Very tasty!

Very easy and tasty. After looking through some of the photos here, I was worried it would be a big sloppy mess, but decided to go for it anyway. While it is a bit messy, it's got a lot of crunch thanks to the crescent roll crust and crushed tortilla chips. The cheese adds awesome ooey-gooey-ness. You have to try it.

I made this recipe this afternoon and it was ok, but not sure about the use of the crescent roll dough as the base.  I would like to see how it goes if tortillas were used as the base.  I worked 1/2 can of retried beans into the ground beef and then used the other 1/2 as a layer after the ground beef.

I thought this was good, but not outstanding.  I made this exactly as stated but thought the crust  was crunchy but not in a good way. We like more spice so after reading some other reviews here's what I'll try. First under bake the crust a few minutes. Then either add Ro-tel to meat or at least an onion.  The recipe is easy and good, just needs a little change for us to be 5 stars.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, just adding extra seasonings and heat to it. I did use lean ground beef, low fat sour cream and reduced fat cheese. I added a layer of salsa on top of the sour cream, under the cheese, before baking. Delicious! Everyone loved it from my husband to my 5 and 6 year olds! I will definitely be making this again, and will add shredded lettuce and tomato to increase veggie content!

Made this with 1 can of refried beans, pureed rotel, black olives.  Was not good!  Could not taste the beans.  May be okay if made according to recipe.

The only thing I changed is that I used turkey instead of beef.  I served it with a side of polenta and green salad.  Everyone in my family, from age 4 to 51, loved it!  I'll make it again!

I replaced some of the ingrediants with some healthier ones to help with our eating lifestyle and it still turned out delicious! I used nonfat cheese & sour cream and ground turkey in place of the ground beef. I could only imagine how much more delicious this recipe would be as stated. Yum!

Following the recipe as given, it was okay (three stars), good enough that I wanted to try it again.  The second time I made it, I totally skipped the tortilla chips, and added layers of salsa (16 oz.) and a small can of green chiles, and a liberal sprinkling of Tabasco Chipotle Sauce.  Also, I used three of the crescents on top.  Liked it way better (four stars) that time.

This recipe is awesome.  I have two very picky eaters at home and they always go back for thirds when I make this dish!!  I tweaked the recipe a bit by mixing in a can of refried beans and a can of corn and use a cresent roll on top instead of chips.  It is amazing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really a great recipe; I learned the hard way that not all queso blanco melts... I am a total beginner, and tried to improvise. I'm sure my pie would have been infinitely better if I'd used the cheese in the recipe! Regardless, my husband and dad still loved it :)

This turned out fantastic! I added diced green chilis, onion, and Rotel to the ground beef and taco seasoning. I pre-baked the crescent roll crust for 10 minutes (prior to adding the meat and cheese). After pre-baking, I added a thin layer of refried beans on top of the hot crust, then layered the meat, sour cream, and cheese. For the top, I crushed up Nacho Cheese Doritos. After baking, I topped with diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, and (just for the hubby)diced black olives. Salsa was served on the side. My husband said this was now his new favorite dish. The only thing I would change up would be to add hot diced green chilis instead of mild.

I read most of the reviews and tweaked the recipe as follows:  I made two 8x8 pies using Pillsbury pizza dough (half in each pan) instead of the crescent rolls baked until light brown then I browned the hamburger meat, drained the fat and added 1 can of drained Mild Rotel, garlic salt and pepper to the meat.  I layered refried beans, meat mixture, black olives, Medium Pace Picante salsa, cheese then crushed chips.  It turned out great - very tasty!

This was delicious! I've made variations of this recipe before, but this is the best one I've come across. After reading others' reviews, I did put a can of refried beans on top and cut back on the sour cream by half, then I just eyeballed the amount of tortilla chips on top-maybe used 1 1/2 cups total. Also, for the taco seasoning, I used the "Bill Echols" recipe featured on this website-it lets me control the salt without compromising flavor.

This is a great recipe.  It reminds me of a taco salad a friend makes except hot. I followed most of the directions.  Cooked Pillsbury Crescent rolls at 350 for 1-13 minutes.  I may do it at 375 as the package instructs next time.  I used ground turkey and McCormick Taco season along with the 3/4 cup water it calls for.  I probably didn't use a whole container of sour cream and may use a little less next time.  I only had regular mild cheddar shredded cheese so I used that instead of the mexi-blend. I topped with a 1/4 bag of crushed Nacho Cheese Doritos. After baking I added some chopped tomatoes so I could feel like I had some veggies with dinner.  I am sure if you like salsa that would be a good alternative.  I do not. My kids loved it.  Even the one who doesn't like sour cream. I will definitely make this again and try it with the mexi-blend cheeses next time.

Easy and yummy dish! I added a salsa and sour cream mixture to the layers before baking it. And as other reviewers have said, I didn't bake the crust all the way through before adding the layers. Other than that I wouldn't change much about this easy recipe!

This was delicious.  I would add a little less sour cream the next time as my husband felt it dominated the dish.  BUT ... we both still enjoyed it and my husband is picky.  I can see where you could easily customize the ingredients to your liking.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

My husband and I really loved this recipe. I made a few changes though. I used pizza crust instead of the crescent rolls. I then added a jar of salsa to the sour cream.  I also added black olives on top of the cheese.  Instead of potato chips I used Hint of Lime chips. Came out great and will be making again.

This is a very easy and tasty dish.  I would suggest using Frito's vs crushed tortilla chips as they fit easier and you can just pile them on top vs having to crush chips.

I made this last night.  I made 2 in 9" round pie pans, and I mixed the cheddar with the meat for binding, and added black olives to that as well, and also some plain sauce to the mixture.  I used crushed "scoops" for the topping.  Loved the taste, will make again, however I am not going to use the crescent bottom, just a large tortilla shell, as my married daughter didn't care for that part, otherwise it was a winner!

This was a quick and easy meal.  I added the can of tomatoes and some sautéed onions.  A good substitute if you didn't have taco shells.  It wouldn't be a go to meal for me but in a pinch, with on hand ingredients an easy dinner or a weekend lunch.

I really liked this recipe. I did have crescent rolls so used regular rolls. I did not cook them long enough. But the recipe was tasty and I can hardly wait to taste it with crescent rolls.

It's chock full of fat but it's pretty good every once in a while :) I add either refried beans or black beans between the ground beef and the sour cream.

Thank you, Stephanie.  Good basic recipe.  Used thin layer of sour cream plus layer of salsa. Added sauteed  small minced jalapeno, chopped dell pepper, 1 t garlic and 1/2 cup onion. Recipe also works with left over chicken.  Here used homemade mango-peach salsa.

This is a GREAT recipe and also one that is easy to adjust/modify for your individual taste. I baked this in a 10" round stoneware pan and it worked perfectly. Used lite sour cream (probably could have used non-fat and noone would have noticed). I added raw onions as a layer on top of the meat. I also only used one ounce of crushed chips on top and it was just right. We topped it off with tomatoes, salsa and lettuce. The family loved it!

My BF loved this!  I served with jalapenos and avocado smashed with lemon juice on the side.  Next time I may try to add some jalapenos on top of the beef layer since we love our spicy :-)

Great recipe. My wife loved it. It's quick and easy to make and you can easily add ingrediants to suit your taste. My wife suggests that next time we add chilli as a layer.

We loved this dish.  I used about 1/2 the sour cream and cheese and way, way less of the tortilla chips on the top, and this came out very well.  

I also added an ear of fresh corn kernels to the beef, and that worked out well too.

We liked how easy the recipe was. We added a small can of green chilis, onion, and mexicorn to the ground turkey. The crescent roll did not get done in the middle. I baked the crescent roll for four minutes less than what was printed on the package. It still was not done when the cheese had melted. I think we may have layered the crescent too thick.

I have made this in the past and I have used meatless crumbles or ground turkey. I mixed black beans and corn into the meat then spread over unbaked crescent rolls and then baked. When it comes out of the oven spread chopped lettuce and salsa over it. Plus I use 2 packages of reduced fat rolls in 9x13 pan.

This recipe was so good!! I think it was the crescent rolls. It was so buttery and just tasted great. My husband doesn't like sour cream, so I added that and salsa afterwards.

This is wonderful and can be healthy with simple modifications. Instead of beef use ground turkey, reduced fat cheese blend, light sour cream, only use crescent roll on the bottom and add veggies like corn, chopped bell peppers and shredded spinach.

I just stuffed a tortilla in a ramekin, filled with ground beef cooked with taco seasoning, sprinkled some cheese on top and some crushed tortilla chips (lauren's were hint of lime, of course) and baked for 10 minutes at 350. Topped with shredded lettuce and fresh pico de gallo.

I made this tonight because I had all the ingredients on hand.  Only thing I did different was use 2 lbs of ground beef(and 2 taco seasoning packets), I used a full tub of sour cream not so many chips and I used regular shredded chedder cheese.  I did only cook the crescents for 8 minutes.  The dish turned out very well, I bought a bag of lettuce so people could top their pieces if they wanted.  Me, my husband and our 2 children cleaned their plates, and my 5 year old went back for more.  I didn't notice a bland taste to it, just tasted like a taco is all.  Was really good and I will be making it again.

This was very tasty!  Even my husband, who doesn't care for tacos said it was good and wouldn't mind having it again!  I did make a few minor changes: I added a few chopped onions in while browning the taco meat and topped the dish with lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and a sprinkle of extra cheese.  As others have mentioned, watch the cooking time on the crescent rolls - take it out and assemble just before they are completely done because they will continue to bake when returned to the oven. My inlaws took all the leftovers home - so it must have been good!

I made this last night, and it turned out pretty well. I wish the recipe had specified what size square pan to use, because the pan I chose ended up being a little too small, and I wasted an entire bag of 9 oz chips - which I'd already crushed. Still, it turned out nice for my first attempt at an unfamiliar recipe. I wasn't able to fit all of the sour cream into the pie, but when serving it we just added a few scoops of it to our plates as a topping.

This is DELICIOUS. Definitely not a healthy choice, but is sure is yummy. I added some sauteed onions and bell peppers and then served with cilantro, lettuce, and chopped tomatoes at the very end. SO good and incredibly easy/quick to make.
Next time I would use low-fat crescent dough, ground turkey, and fat free sour cream. 
Enjoy!

Excellent and so easy! I didn't change a thing and it was a hit with my 14 year old. I offered salsa on the side and served with a salad. Will make this again soon!

This disappeared super fast!!  Certainly going into the weeknight recipe rotation! Modifications: Instead of crescent rolls I lined the bottom of my pie dish with flour tortillas and baked until just crispy but not browned.  After the meat was browned off I added a can of diced tomatoes with peppers to add a little kick.  I assembled my pie with a layer of refried beans on the bottom, then cheese, then the meat mixture, then more cheese :) I covered the pie with more flour tortillas and baked until warm!   We topped each slice with some lime slices and cool sour cream!   Thanks for sharing such a great weekday recipe!

I love this recipe, however I made mine with ground turkey. I also added green peppers and onions.I didn't have a packet of taco seasoning but I used fiesta blend shredded cheese, crushed taco flavored doritos, and topped with lettuce and tomatoes and it turned out great!

I didn't care for the sweet taste of crescent rolls paired with the other ingredients.  Also, this did not reheat well AT ALL the next day.  The chips became very mushy.

Very good, easy recipe. Love the crescent roll crust. I also added a layer of salsa, and once it came out of the oven, I also topped it with shreddd lettuce. Yum!

My whole family loved this recipe, including my 1 year old. I doubled the ground beef because the bits in my family are big meat eaters, and it still fit in the 8x8 pan. I mixed the sour cream and the meat together. Next time I will add a layer of salsa on top of the meat/sour cream. Very tasty and easy to whip together!

This was AWESOME, I thought.  I did some "tweaking" as per other rater's suggestions....added a layer of salsa and a layer of chili style beans.  I also added a little cream cheese, taco seasoning and a generous dash of garlic powder into the sour cream and blended well.  Lastly, I used cool ranch tortilla chips b/c that was what I had on hand.  DELICIOUS!  (PS  I used lowfat everything, except the mex. cheese blend and did half ground turkey/half beef.)

This is one of my go-tos. I mix the browned meat with the taco seasoning, sour cream (I dont use close to 16 oz, maybe 8), a can of black beans (drained and rinsed), a can of corn (drained) and a can of mexican style rotel (juices drained).  I love something this easy that tastes so good!

This recipe was super easy, and it has cheese and meat-what's not to love?  Next time I make this, I will be changing it of course.  My square pan seemed a bit small, so I upgraded to a round deep casserole dish.  Thank goodness I did, or none of this would have fit.  I had to get creative with the crust, bringing it up around the sides, but still, with all the stuff in this, it barely fit in that, making it very deep.  That sounds great, but in hindsight, it made it hard to eat, as one bite was just cheese, one just meat, etc.  Next time I will be making it in a 13x9 to spread it out a bit.  I will be adding the sour cream after as some had pointed out, I didn't mind it, but for the sake of a picky son.  And, the chips, too many!  My kids had a great time smooshing an entire bag of chips, but it made it really dry, especially with it being so thick.  It already has a crust, so the chips were overkill.  Even spreading in a 13x9, I think I will stop with the chips after I have a nice uniform layer.  Lastly, I think the salsa and other taco items at the end are a must.  With so many different tastes in our house, they will be in dishes like tacos, and each member will be able to add their desired toppings.  I do like this recipe, once I modify it!

This was really good.  I was skeptical because my husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy so didnt know if this would fill him up but he loved it.  The only thing I would change next time is to put the sour cream on after it is baked, not a fan of warm sour cream.

Not bad. I used an 8" cake pan and added a layer of black beans on top of the meat. I also used Ground Turkey instead of beef to lighten it up a bit. Served it with lettuce, and garnished it with sliced green onions. Next time I will try adding a layer of salsa and possibly rice. All in all, a good basic recipe that is worth playing with!

I made this over the weekend, but with a few variations. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also used a can of hot rotel (drained) and a can of ranch style beans (drained of excess sauce). It turned out delicious and because of the rotel, pretty spicy, but thats the way we like it. The next time I won't add the sour cream before baking, I'll just wait and add it as a topper. I will probably also use a bit more cheese because we like things cheesy. This is an easy recipe and makes a nice meal that is great on a cold day!

This was super easy to make and it came out so good! I followed some others' suggestions and added Rotel to the meat. I also substituted with ground turkey and it was wonderful. My husband couldn't even tell it wasn't beef. Next time I might try adding beans too. Very yummy!

Excellent - served this at book club and it was a huge hit and Allrecipes.com got a few new clients! Also easy to cut back on the fat with low fat products (bread, sour cream, cheese)

YUMMY!!! This is saying a lot for our family.. my hubby and 2 kids (ages 2 and 3) are all VERY picky, and they all loved it!!! My hubby actually grumbled when I said we were having "taco pie" for dinner, but while we were eating he said "its like tacos, but better"!! Will add some veggies next time but it was great as is :)

Great base for a recipe- I added fresh corn, bell pepper and onion before I browned my meat- DELICIOUS! We will be making this again.

The first time I made this, I used crushed tortilla chips as the recipe calls for and it was extremely dry, even with the sour cream.  It's a little unclear... what it should say is crushed Dorito's-style chips.  I used them the second time I made it, and added a small can of Mexican-style tomato sauce to the ground beef, and it was a thousand times better.

I gave this 4 stars because I found the recipe to be a little unclear on a few details.   I used an 8 inch square pan so I only put 4 crescents on the bottom and made a crust with the other four because all 8 on the bottom would have been very thick.  Also, when it says to add the taco seasoning it doesn't mention adding the water and cooking according to the seasoning package directions. If you don't do this the seasoning will be very strong.   The last thing was that I barely used 6 oz. of tortilla chips and would not have been able to fit any more than that in my pan.   The flavor was delicious and we will definitely make it again. I think it would be fun to do as others suggested and add onions, chopped peppers, etc. to the layering.

Very good!  I added diced onion and jalapenos to the meat, for extra spice/flavor.  Excellent base recipe that is easily adaptable to fit your taste.  I'll probably use nacho tortilla chips next time for extra flavor.

I love taco pie! I grew up with this recipe, and it's great comfort food! I also chop black and green olives and add them to the meat. And I've always used Fritos instead of tortilla chips. But so good either way, I'm sure!!

Just ok...I don't know what all the raving is about.  I'm surprised I didn't think this was great; how can you go wrong with all these tasty ingredients, but I did use all low fat stuff (97% fat free ground turkey breast, etc) and also used baked tortilla chips.

I took some of the reviews into consideration before making this recipe.  However, it was still a bit bland.  If I make this again, I will spice it up a bit, and maybe find a crust thats a bit more crunchy, maybe put the chips on the bottom.  At any rate, this was an ok recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

Good recipe everyone in my family loved it. However I changed several things to make it a little healthier. I skipped the sour cream and used crumbles instead of meat, I also cut back on the amount of crushed chips that go on top. So it wouldn't be so dry I mixed some sour cream and salsa and served it on the side instead.

Absolutely LOVED this! I made it for my boyfriend and his 4 year old son. Both of their plates were clean when they were done! I added refried beans on the bottom of the layers. Served with a side of salsa! I will be making this again!

Thia recipe was great and i get praised every time i make it! However I did make a few changes. I didm't precook the crescents in the pan, I drained the grease from the meat before adding about 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning. I also used crushed tortilla chips on the top and bottom instead of nacho chips. Always a great flavor, never too dry. Will try with refried beans tonight !

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I added refried beans and taco sauce on top of the meat and used only 2/3 of a cup or so of sour cream.  We ate it with lots of salsa and next time I make it I'll probably throw in some onions, green peppers and jalapeños! Also, I had lent out my 9x9 pan so I made the Taco Pie in a pie pan! Thanks for sharing Stephanie!  I enjoyed the recipe!

This was very easy and very tasty.  I served up the portions with shredded lettuce, tomatoes and taco sauce.  There was one discrepancy in the instructions tho.  The recipe said to line your pan with the dough and to follow the instructions on the pkg.  The temperature was different on the pkg than the recipe.  I followed the recipe, which was a lower temp and did end up baking the crust longer.  By the time the cheese melted it got a little scorched on bottom in places, but it still tasted good.

This was a good recipe. I mixed the sour cream with canned tomotoes and chilies, and tomatoe sauce, then mixed it with the meat instead of layering. I think it woud have been really dry without the sauce and tomatoes. I did not add chips on top because I didn't have any but did not miss them. I will make this again.

I made this recipe using flour tortillas, rather than crescent rolls (to save some fat/cals), and added chopped onions/jalapenos to the meat.   Although the filling was tasty and it was REALLY quick/easy to make, I wasn't crazy about the texture (it's all meat and cheese-and the sour cream kind of curdled in the oven.  I didn't even use all the sour cream that the recipe originally called for).  I would have rather made the meat filling and then used it inside of burritos or as a dip with tortilla chips.  I also would have mixed in some refried beans for something extra.

So yummy and so easy to make.  Very easy to create a low fat version if that's what you want.  I used baked nacho chips instead of taco flavored, however both would be good.  This also reheats well.  A definite keeper!

My boys really liked this dish and asked it be added to our recipe rotation.  I drained the beef and added 1/2 cup of water to the taco seasoning and meat.  I didn't have sour cream so I used 8 oz of cream cheese which worked wonderfully.  Thank you for sharing.

This reminds me of a Pampered Chef recipe I make all the time called Taco Ring.  However, this was actually a little easier to make.  My family loved it and want it to become a part of my regular menu rotation!

This is a good basic recipe, but it definitely needs other ingredients added to it (tomatoes, olives, etc.).  Also, there was too much crust and not enough filler.  Thank you for the base recipe, though.  I will definitely make this again, just with my own adjustments.

This is a very simple, delicious recipe! Easy and quick to make and a nice spin on tacos. There were no leftovers! This is definitely something I will make again, only next time I might add a layer of taco sauce and/or refried beans.

This was so delicious!  I substituted ground beef with  ground turkey and added 2 cans of refried beans and half a jar of mild salsa that I mixed with the ground turkey.  Instead of store bought taco seasoning, I used Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning 1 recipe from this website.  It was well worth it.  I also omitted the crushed tortilla chips.  Definitely a recipe I will be making every so often, as it's quite rich and filling!

This was so yummy! Love that it's a change up from your typical tacos. I'm not a sour cream fan so I decided to put a layer of chunky salsa before the cheese. It was a big hit with my husband.

Very quick and easy recipe! The only change I made to this was to add hot sauce between the sour cream and cheese, otherwise it comes out very dry and doesn't have much taste.

this dish has potential, my husbasn is hispanic and he wasn't too disappointed,  I thought that it was missing something even though I did add black olives and a few different cheeses.  as we sat there we decided that ortega chillies might have improved the flavor.  over all it was okay

This was pretty good.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Didn't have sour cream, but made it anyways.  Next time I won't use as many chips, and I'll add tomatos and olives.  I loved the crust on the bottom, that's what makes it taste so good.  Hubby loved it too!!

Kids ate it up with no problem! I did add a jar of salsa with white corn & black beans with it. The only thing about it was it was alittle messy. Not sure if the salsa had something to do with it.

This is really great... but holy saturated fats! I used sirloin ground beef as well as cutting down the sour cream, cheese, and tortilla chips by A LOT. And it was great! I also think you could easily only use half a can of crescent rolls, I'm going to do that next time. I'm sure this recipe is even more amazing with all that delicious fat in there, but I have to keep my girlish figure. : )

My family loved this! The only thing I did different was add 1 can of mild  Rotel (drained), and I didn't have any tortilla chips. I hope to try it with the tortilla chips to give it that extra crunch! Adding a layer of refried beans might be good too.

This dish was a big hit at our house. My 4 year old said it was the "best dinner in the whole world!" It is super easy and a great alternative to taco's. Also a definite kid and husband pleaser. I added onion to the ground meat when cooking and used baked tortilla chips on top. The addition of chopped lettuce would be great after cooking. Overall a great recipe!

Very yummy! Great for picky eaters, you can top with what you like, just like a regular taco. Baked the crescent rolls different (package said 375). Used ground turkey instead of beef (we do that with most our dishes). Delish, will make again.

I used ground turkey and seasoned with my own spices and added picante sauce, rather than using taco seasoning.  I added just enough cheese and chips to cover the top of the dish.  I also didn't add the sour cream and, instead, served it on the side.  It was absolutely delicious!

My family loved this recipe!  I had a few substitutions, as most people do.  1) I only had a pizza crust on hand and won't be doing that again--too dense and chewy for what I was intending. 2) I had a boxed taco dinner and used the seasoning from that with the meat and crushed the hard shell tortillas for the top.  Much less salt than using chips, which we prefer in our house. 3) I doubled the meat and added a can of ro-tel tomatoes also, which did add to the texture and flavor.  My husband & stepson both had seconds and leftovers were gone in two days!

I highly enjoyed this recipe and will probably make it again.  However, like most the other members I made a few changes.  I added onions, kidney beans, and corn while sauteing the TURKEY meat and seasoning.  I used multigrain chips.  Tasted Great!

It wasn't all that great, but it wasn't bad.  I think the cres. rolls are to much and got a bit soggy.  I tried it again today and crushed tortilla chips and pressed them into the dough.  Now that added a bit of a crunch my family liked!  Also, left the sour cream out until afterwards.  I don't like half melted sour cream, so for me blobbing it on afterwards was better.  Also, mixed corn in the meat with a little tex-mex spices and it was very good according to the family!  Will make again with other variations I have seen on here!

The only thing I did different was make a single layer of the crescent roll in a 9x13 casserole dish. It was a HUGE hit!!!! Next tme I may even add corn and some rach style beans.

Rather than using a pre-baked crust for this I lined the pie tine with a large flour tortilla.  Worked perfectly for this dish.  Nice easy dish to make.  Not particularly impressive but everyone liked it as a meal to make when you need something fast and simple.

This was a great meal. My whole family liked it, even my 1 year old and he's a picking eater. I made a healthier version. I used reduced fat sour cream and only used about half, and it was still almost too much. Everything else was reduced fat too. I also, added chopped onion to the ground beef when cooking it. I will definitely cook this again.

This recipe was great. It was quick and easy. I made the recipe as it was. The only thing I did do was mix the sour cream in with the ground beef instead of spreading it on the top. I liked this because every bite had an equal amount of goodness.   We will make this recipe again, for sure.

I have been making this for many years, but I don't put the sour cream, or nacho chips in it.  I put a layer of velveeta cheese on top of the meat before I bake it.  It's soooo good!

Turkatron: Is that a taco pie? Meatwad: Mm-hmm. Turkatron: Taco pie!! Meatwad: I added food coloring 'cause it's a holiday, but it turned black 'cause I added all the food coloring I had. And I ate this butter straight out of the tub, 'cause it tastes good. There's a reason behind everything. Turkatron: Enjoy those tacos now, for in a thousand years they will be illegal! Ha ha ha ha-I think we all know why. Meatwad: We know why. Turkatron: Anti-taco legislation!   Disestablishmentarianism!

An easy weeknight dinner that doesn't skimp on taste!  My hubby loved it!  The only change I made was to add 2 cups of salsa -- just to get leftovers out of my fridge.  Next time, I plan to layer the chips before the cheese to avoid crumbs when dipped.

Great recipe to play around with!  We always make our tacos with ground beef and small cubed fried potatoes so I did the same here.  I baked reduced fat crescent rolls until they were light golden.  Then on top I put browned lean ground beef with sauteed onions and fried potatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, parsley and some crushed red pepper flakes.  I sprinkled generously with shredded cheddar and put back in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  I served with homemade salsa, fat-free sour cream and diced tomatoes.  Next time I'll add homemade refried beans in the dish and serve with guacamole and shredded lettuce as well.

This was fantastic. The whole family enjoyed it and the best part was it was so easy to make. My 7 year old actually requested this for his birthday dinner.

Pretty good basic recipe...didn't change very much except to add a can of black beans in with the ground turkey.  I also only cooked the crescent rolls for half the time as suggested.  Turned out tasty.  My husband thought it was good, my 2 year old ate it and my 3.5 year old picked it apart - ate the beans, not thrilled with the sour cream...will probably make again and add to it - served it with sliced avocado and salsa...

This was super yummy and super easy! I used ground turkey, which turned out great. The great thing about this recipe is that you can add whatever your family prefers with tacos to the layers. Enjoy : )

This is really good!   I did take the advice of some others and added a layer of refried beans just because I really like beans.  I also added garnishes of diced tomatoes, sliced green olives and chopped green onions on top of the finished dish which made it look very appealing.   The leftovers heated up nicely.

This was so good! I used Turkey meat and doritos instead of what the recipe called for. I have to agree with some of the other users about the nutritional value being poor, but it is great for a "cheat" day.

I made this last night !!!  My boyfriend loved it -- it was SO unbelievably easy -- I only strayed from the recipe in adding chopped scallions to the top of the sour cream layer -- think mixing salsa with sour cream would have given it a nice tangy kick -- this will definitely go into the line up.

This recipe was very good and filling I also used lipton's rice sides mexican rice as a side dish. Even my picky husband enjoyed this meal. I cooked ground turkey instead of ground beef with chopped green bell peppers and onions. Other than those additions I followed the recipe.

My family LOVES this recipe...and with 5 kids, that is saying something! I doubled the recipe and adjusted (as I always do) by adding some lower fat cheeses and sour cream, but don't tell the kids! They even love this the next day, reheated in the microwave.

Very GOOD! However, I added refried beans to the bottom layer, and we liked it much better (1/2 the pan had beans, 1/2 didn't).  Will have again!

So, I was looking for a quick recipe for my picky hubby. This was good and did not take very only to make. I did do some of the suggestions and added mexican rice (from this site) and added black beans to the meat mixture. I really liked the cresent, but I used a 8X8 baking dish and only half of the cresent fit on the bottom. Next time, I will do a double layer of the cresent. I think this recipe would be really good with chicken or even turkey as long as you increases the seasoning. Overall, I will make again.

I loved it!  My husband thought too much sour cream.  I put into a square pan as it said & ended up only using half of my crescent package as it said to cover the bottom of the pan & that's all it took.   Maybe I misread something...VERY possible!  Anyways, this ones a keeper & I will be making again whether the hubs liked it or not.

I thought this was a good recipe overall.  My Fiancee really liked the crescent roll bottom.  I used Ground Turkey instead of beef, I used lean sour cream and I also left off the black olives (all for personal prefernce)!  Very tasty and cleanup was very nice!

I liked the "base" recipe but the recipe as written was not all that appealing to me so I made several modifications. I added black beans and corn, as well as mixing in salsa with the sour cream. I used half a bag of chips and added fresh avocado and tomato.

I don't know that this will be in my regular rotation, but will likely make again.

Excellent, easy recipe.  My kids are very picky, and they loved it.  It is so simple to make for those of us who are working moms and don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen.  I did reduce the sour cream and mixed it in with the beef mixture due to the pickiness of my kids.

Added some chopped onions and pepper while cooking the beef, then mixed salsa with the sour cream before baking.  It was okay, nothing special.

I added a layer of refried beans to the base of the pie, then layered the ground beef, onion, and cheese.  Omitted the chips to reduce the sodium, and served salsa and sour cream on the side.

Great! I will say that spraying the bottom of the glass dish worked very, very well. I also added regular taco toppings;after the meat, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, crushed tortilla chips, then a little bit more cheese. My husband & kids want me to make this again, & I will.

I've made this several times now and my family really likes it.  We use ground turkey instead of beef (personal preference) and use about 1/4 of the tortillas on top.   I add black olives to the top. I've tried it both ways and like mixing the sour cream with the meat instead of layering a little better.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was really good.  I did make a couple of changes, and plan on making it again with a couple more changes.  I added a layer of refried beans first before adding the taco meat.  The next time I am going to make cheese dip to pour over instead of shredded cheese because I thought it was a bit dry, but it was still very very good.  My kids even loved it.  I put some salsa verde over it, yummy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Not quite as good as I thought it would be...I mixed 2 TBS. of sour cream with refried beans (as another reviewer recommended) and put it over the meat.  I used a 14 oz. bag of lightly salted chips but thought that was too much.  Also, this dish didn't make good leftovers since the chips lose their crispness.

Add a little salsa, and serve with fresh diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.  Similar to recipe that Heather made.

I'm giving this four stars because my daughter thought it was really good.  I put sour cream on the half that my husband and I ate and left the sour cream off the other half for my daughter.  I thought it was heavy and not very tasty.  My husband thought it tasted OK.  I probably won't make this again, but I thank you for a quick and easy dinner.

This became one of my families favorites in an instant! I ended up using a round glass casserole dish as I didn't have a square pan and it turned out great. It was a bit hard to lay the rolls out but I managed to make it look neat and clean. I made this exactly as the directions state except I didn't use all of the tortilla chips and added a side of yellow rice. It looked suprisingly beautiful (as the dish was clear) and was a hearty, satisfying meal. It was easy to make and cost me about $10 to feed 6 people and have leftovers - a major plus in my book! This IS a basic recipe, but a GREAT basic recipe - as well as one you can add to as you wish. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I did not like the flavor of this the night I made it, it was very bland.  Over the next couple of days we had it several times, very very good after it sits in the fridge.

Everyone loved this recipe!  I doubled it and put it into a 13x9 pan, used 1lb of ground sirloin and 1lb of chirizo.  I also added some cheese dip on the bottom of pie and used shredded monteray jack cheese and torn pieces of chedder cheese (it covered better once melted).  I would definitely make this again.

My girls (age 5 & 7) said this was the best ever and went back for seconds.  My husband and I liked it alot too - this will go into regular rotation for us.  I left off the sour cream, and I only put about a 3rd of a bag of crushed chips on top.  I baked it in a 11x9 casserole dish.  The only thing that keeps from from 5 stars on this is that it is really fattening (but then that's what makes things so good, right?)

Sooooooooooo good! I used shredded cheddar instead of Mexican blend and it was wonderful! I actually got this recipe off the Pillsbury website and did that one before I saw this one but its the same recipe. I crushed up tortilla chips before putting the meat mixture on the crust too. I used soy crumbles instead of meat and it was fabulous!

This taco pie is better than tacos.  I used half the sour cream as others and used the rest of it for garnish along with shredded lettuce, tomatoes and black olives.  My kids couldn't get enough. I love easy and delicious recipes and this one fits the bill.  Thanks!

This was such an easy weeknight dinner.  The kids love it (anything with chips on top is a pleaser) and my husband said it was great.  I used ground turkey to make it healthier, added a 1/2 can of Rotel to the  meat and only used 1/2 container of Reduced-fat Sour cream.  The rest can be used to garnish, along with black olives, tomatoes and lettuce if desired.

Excellent.  It tastes almost like Indian tacos with the fluffy crust.  I used buttermilk biscuits instead of the croissants and it was fabulous.  We added a little salsa to cover the biscuits after we baked them and then added all the toppings.  We also used ground turkey to cut back on a bit of the fat.  Will most definitely make again.

I really liked this meal and it was nice and easy for what I needed it for. I had never used the crecent dough before so I found that a little bit fiddly (although not in the way that dough from scratch is fiddly!). I added some mushrooms to my meat and after baking the base I spread refried beans on the base, then layered the meat, sour cream, cheese and topped with the doritos. I didn't bake it again though, I just broiled it. Very yummy and my very picky son even wanted seconds!

Easy to prepare and pretty good. I did add diced tomatoes with chiles to the meat and added a layer of Ranch Style beans, but it could have used more kick. Next time I'll add more green chilis.

This was fantastic, my entire family liked it (including the 4 little ones).  The kids have already asked when we are having it again, though I did make some alterations to fit my household.  Instead of taco seasoning I used some tomato sauce and taco sauce and my husband added beans to his.  I topped it off with lettuce, tomatoes  and avacodo.  It was excellent and quick!

I screwed this recipe up.  i didn't have the crescent rolls so I used bisquik and it wasn't very good.  The bisquik was dry, other then that the recipe had a great flavor.

This recipe is pretty good.  Based on previous reviewers comments, I added refried beans.  Also, rather than layering the casserole, I combined all ingredients with the exception of the chips prior to placing in the casserole dish.  This was much easier than trying to layer it.  The kids really enjoyed it!

I didn't crush the nachos on top, but next time I will, I'll just sprinkle lightly.  I did set a plate on the side with one side nachos and the other side natural taco chips, the colors looked nice.  As for the Taco seasoning, I got it mild, due to the kids.  I had a plate of lettuce, tomatoe, etc on the side as well, so everyone can add what they liked. Family gives it a 4 star

We really liked this dish. I sauteed a clove of garlic in some olive oil, then added the ground beef, drained the fat and oil after the beef was browned, then added the taco seasoning and about a 1/4 cup of water. I added a can of diced tomatoes and a chopped jalapeno to the meat and let it simmer while the rolls baked. Next time I think I will put the sour cream on top of the rolls, to make spreading it a little easier. Topped it off with nacho Doritos. Yummy!

Love the recipe! I read some of the reviews and add refried beans and corn to the recipe. I didn't put sour cream on it because my husband despises it. I did however top sour cream to my piece and pur salsa over it. The crust gives it the best flavor. This will defiantly be added to my recipes.

Pretty good.  Always nice to try something new.  The crescent roll crust wasn't very "mexican".  might be better with a cornbread crust.

This was a great meal!  I was a little skeptical with the crescent rolls.  Just had a hard time wrapping my mind around taco meat in bread, but I started the meat and discovered I had already used my crescent rolls.  I ended up using bread rolls that I divided in half across the dish and baked them and all turned out great.  For left overs I heated it up with some salsa on top and enjoyed that as well.  Thanks for the great and simple recipe!

Great starter of a recipe. I added layers of diced tomatoes with peppers, black beans, and corn. I did not put the chips on top and topped with sour cream after cooking. I also put fresh avocado on top with lettuce. WAS GREAT! Had a nice kick from the peppers too. Took less than 20 minutes.

I've made this before with refrigerated biscuits in a 9in round cake pan. This time I used the crescent rolls and an 8in square glass pan. I had just the right amount of dough to take up the sides of the pan and just the right amount of meat to fill the "pie". I added a can of undrained kidney beans (no water with the taco seasoning packet) and let that simmer while the crust baked for about 13 minutes. I baked the meat for 10 minutes and then topped it with shredded "Mexican" cheese blend and a zip-loc baggie of crushed Doritos, and baked it for 3 minutes longer. Yumm!

This was really good. Even my 5 year old liked it. It's a nice change from ordinary tacos. I left off the sour cream and put it on the table for those who wanted some on top. I also served tomatoes and lettuce for toppings. You definitely don't need a whole bag of cheese or a whole bag of chips!

This was very good.  I used tortilla chips on the bottom and on the top (we're not big fans of cresent rolls).  Even my picky three year old who never cleans his plate ate every bite.  Tip, use the recipe for taco seasoning on this site (the one with like 400 reviews).  Easy and beats the heck out of taco salad.  Thank you!

Okay, I have just become "step-mom" to a family of fussy eaters!  Taco pie was a huge hit!
I serve it with diced tomatos and shredded lettuce (on the side, of course) and they gobble it up!
Yummmmmm!

The reason I didn't like this so much is that I didn't think the crescent roll dough really complimented the taco seasoning and Mexican flavors of the dish, pretty much overpowered the taste. If I make again, I will use flour tortillas for the dough layer

This taco pie is awesome. My husband and I loved it. After adding the beef,I did add a layer of Pace chunky salsa, and then followed the recipe exactly. Thank you Stephanie for sharing your recipe with us. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Just ok...probably won't make it again.  The cresent roll crust was a little soggy and gave the dish a sweet flavor I didn't get excited over.  Maybe with some adjustments it would be ok.

i thought the instructions were a little unclear and that a square cake pan (9x9) was too small for the recipe. i made it anyway in the small pan but used HALF the chips and HALF the sour cream.i also added water to the beef mixture as the directions on taco seasoning packet instruct. taste is very god but way too much dough in a small pan. the chips on top were a very nice touch!

I added a layer of refried beans on top of the crescent rolls, some black olives, onions, and green peppers, and I used Nacho Cheese Doritos rather than plain tortilla chips, and it turned out even better than the original recipe.  I loved it!

This was pretty good.  I used a lot less chips than stated and added a 1/2 can of pinto beans.  I will make again it was fast and easy.

Very good dish.  The next time I make this however I will probably not put chips on top, but use another user suggestion and try the crescent rolls on top and as the crust.

The toppings were great. The crescent roll crust was too dominant. I prefer a crispy crust, therefore, I will use crushed tortilla chips next time.

I really enjoyed how easy this recipe was to make. I altered it a bit because I'm not a huge meat eater. Instead I used 1/2 pound beef and added a can of refried beans. It tasted great and my family loved it.

Added red, green and jalapeno peppers to add some kick!  I brought it to our church potluck and the priest simply raved about it!!  Will definetely make again.  gave it a three because it seems it would be bland without my additions.

Reasonably good.  A little bland for my liking.  I added a whole chopped onion, some garlic salt and a little season all when the meat was browning - my kids loved it and it was still good a day later.

My entire family loved this.  I mixed the sour cream in with the meat at the last minute prior to layering. (Hubby hates sour cream, didn't even know it was in there).  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Great quick meal.

Quick simple and very very good!  I prepared the beef according to the taco seasoning mix directions (3/4 cup water) and reduced until it was pretty much dry.  It came out just wonderful.

My family liked this recipe.  We added a few things to kick up the flavor of it though.  We put refried beans on top of the baked crescent roll dough.  Over that we put sauted onion and jalapenos.  Then we layered the rest of the ingredients per the recipe.  Good stuff!

Tried this last night - it's good.  Needs a little more zip for my family, perhaps a layer of salsa or taco sauce. I didn't use the entire bag of corn chips, thought that would be too much, used about half. Found that a 11X7 baking pan worked well - just stretch the crescent dough to fit.  Both husand and I have it packed for our lunches today.  Will make again. Edited to add:  This IS better the next day...yum!

My husband really liked this.  I added some refried beans to the beef and served with lettuce and chopped tomato on the side.  I used quite a bit less than the amount of chips specified and it seemed like plenty.  I also used a 9x13 dish as suggested in previous reviews and used half the sour cream.

I thought this was good.  I added refried beans to the hamburger.  I also waited to add the cheese until the last five minutes of cooking.  It was good, but it will probably not make the rotation too often.

While easy to make I found this recipe needed something more, the crescent rolls came out a little flaky for my taste, will try flour tortilla next time.

This recipe was great.  I left out the sour cream because my family doesn't like it and it was still very good.  This is gonna be a new family favorite.

Great recipe, my 8 year old hates everything, and he had 3rds of this.  I will definitely make it again and again.

I love Mexican and my husband doesn't.  All day long he complained and made gagging noises when I told him what I was making.  He wound up eating three helpings!  I'd say that's a good review!

Got this recipe from my sister-in-law several years ago.  However, I have adapted it to my "Pampered Chef" pizza stone.  On a large pizza stone use two cans crescent rolls and shape into crust with a lip on the edge so ingredients will not run over. Same great taste with a different presentation!

This is such a delicious and easy pie to make. I used refrigerated pizza crust instead of croissant rolls and it tasted just as good! I topped it with lots of scallions too! Yummy!

This was a hit at my party.  Only one piece was left at the end of the night.  I only had a 9x13 glass dish and 8 oz of sour cream.  It still came out beautifully and almost everyone made good comments to me about it.  Thanks for the recipe Stephanie!

VERY good and so easy to make!  My four very picky children and husband all loved this dish.  I used a 9 x 13 pan instead of square pan.  I used half of the sour cream and I didn't add the tortilla chips until the last 5 minutes of baking.  I served lettuce, olives, tomatoes and salsa on the side and let them pick what they wanted to put on.  I used reduced fat crescent rolls, light sour cream and lean hamburger to cut down on the calories and fat.  Thanks for the great recipe!

A great recipe that the whole family loves.  I use Doritos on half and plain tortilla chips on the other half.  I also add refried beans to the meat.  My husband thinks it is even better the next day.  This is a regular at our houwe.

Very good!  Easy, too. My husband raved over it.  I really enjoyed it. My six yr. old is a taco fan so this was a hit with him. My 12 yr. old ate it, but without enthusiasm, but she's not into mexican food very much anyway.  I added a few things to round out the "casserole"...About a 1/2 c. chopped onion, 1/2 can chopped tomatoes, 1/2 can chopped jalepeno peppers, and 1/2 can corn niblets.  I sauteed these with the meat mixture.  I used lite sour cream, and lite shredded cheddar.  This seems versatile enough that you can tweek it to your liking.  Great weeknight dinner when the family is on the go.

This was a quick and easy recipe that was very tasty.  I didn't add as many chips and omitted the sour cream and served with salsa instead.  It was very good.  My husband and I both like it.

Excellent recipe, however I made some changes - I used extra lean ground beef and light sour cream to cut down on the fat content.  Also, used 1/2 cup of cheese instead of 1 cup.

Also I put one diced onion and 1 clove of minced garlic in the beef mixture and used corn chips instead of tortilla chip - they stayed very crunchy.

Definitely would make again - my boyfriend loved it!!

I had to rate this a 5-star, because my husband said he'd rate this a "9" out of 10, and that is a true compliment. This was easy and fast to make,and can be adjusted to how you like it. I baked it without the sour cream, and then added it afterwards, along with other taco toppings. I took other users' advice and waited for the cheese to melt a little before adding the chips to the top. Will make again.

My mom used to make this for us when I was a kid.  All kids seem to love it!  This recipe was very similar to what she made, however, she didn't top it with the corn chips.  I tried it with them and didn't care for it.

Good and easy recipe for a quick dinner. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, reduced sodium taco seasoning, light sour cream. Of course, additonal ingredients, such as black olives,sliced tomatoes, avocadoes etc. could be added to taste.

This recipe was really simple and very good.  I only used half of the sour cream and that was plenty.  I also added salsa to the meat mixture  and baked the pie in a 9x13 pan as suggested by others.  I think this is a great kid meal, they seemed to really enjoy it.  Thanks for this great recipe.

This is excellent...easy and tasty and highly recommended. I used the 9 by 13 pan...it worked best. A square pan would be too small. This is a fabulous recipe...great for company, too.

Very very good!!!!!  My family of 6 ate it all up.  I followed the recipe with few changes/additions.  Baked it in a 9/13 pan...the crescents seemed to fit perfectly.  And added tomatoes and lettuce between the cheese and crushed chip topping

My children always have sleepovers with friends on weekends and I was tired of calling out for pizza every Friday...this taco pie was the perfect substitution!!  All the kids loved it as did my husband and I.  I didn't have any plain corn chips, so I used cheesy Doritos instead and it turned out great. Just as easy and quicker than dialing the pizza parlor...a nice change of pace.

Really good.  Could add black olives (if you like them) or peppers (if you like them)to the beef or any other taco-y kinds of things.  Tomatoes and lettuce on top would also be good.

This is a HUGE hit at my house.  We love Mexican food and although it's not spicy it is great!!!  The perfect combination, Thanks!
