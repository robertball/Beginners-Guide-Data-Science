Used dark molasses and did not use caraway.  Had nice light texture, good flavor, and nice crust.
Served it with corned beef and cabbage and was a real hit. Will be making it again.

This was the third loaf I've made. First from scratch. 
used the bread maker:
MODs to INGREDIENTS
  * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (Used Cold Pressed Olive Oil)
   * 2 cups all-purpose flour (used Organic Whole Wheat Flour)
   * 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder (left this out)
   * 3/4 teaspoon caraway seed (left this out)
Result: Success
Nice sized loaf.
Dark Brown.
Heavy and moist.
Crumbly.
Texture is like cake - almost like fruit cake.
Slices fit the lunch meat well.
Flavor is "intergalactic".

I wonder if the "cakieness" is because I used:
a. whole wheat flour
b. a whole packet of yeast 2 1/4 tsp rather than 2.
c. Olive Oil
d. Due to the ratio of Wheat flour to Rye flour

I'm giving this one a 5 Star rating, even though I didn't actually eat any of this bread!  I turned out perfectly in my bread machine & my husband DEVOURED it before anyone else got a chance LOL!  I'll definitely be making this one again for him!  I would like to point out though, that this recipe and one for "Dark Rye Bread" on this site are exactly the same.  I went into the recipe thinking that it would be a "basic" rye bread & turned out darker than I thought it would.  However, my husband thoroughly enjoyed it, so no matter! LOL

This was very good -- but the texture was better with bread flour, rather than all-purpose.

I had a disaster on my hands.  I followed the recipe exactly as it reads and I added ingredients as per the bread machine instructions.  It came out lumpy and doughy with the top 1"-2" cooked.  Out of curiosity, I tried the cooked part and it was VERY tasty, I just don't know if someone can offer help of what to do with the bread machine?  Perhaps I should make it sans the machine?

While the taste was ok, the breadmaker had trouble kneading the dough. My bread fell during the  final baking. I will try it again but with modifications.

Used whole wheat flour and added 2 tsp vital wheat gluten to help rise. Other than that recipe is the same. Good flavor.

I scaled this to fit my bread machine, and made as dough only, and baked in the oven.  The dough was very wet, and very dark.  I think too much molasses in this recipe. Sorry, but I think I will try another.

The flavor of this bread was very good.  I found the texture to be a little dense though...even for rye bread.  Could be the baker.

Delicious! It is a perfect sandwich bread, and is wonderful with hummus or tofu spread. I didn't have any seeds to add but the flavor was fantastic all the same. I definitely will be making this bread again!

I didn't add the cocoa, substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Bread turned out amazing. Moist and dense rye flavor without the high glycemic processed white flour and inflammatory effects of vegetable oil.

This baked beatifully in my bread machine. It is a bit sweet but has a good rye flavor because it contains  a higher than average amount of rye flour. I don't like caraway seeds so I made it without them and it turned our just fine. My kids liked it too.

This recipe made a small but very tasty loaf.   I'll definitely make it again and again.  Next time I'll try scaling it to make a bigger loaf.

I didn't have caraway seeds so I substituted celery seeds.

I always bake my bread in the oven instead of the bread machine. This one always come out a little runny when made as described. It is much easier to handle if I add 1/2 to 1 cup more flour.
Love the flavor of this bread. My 2-yr old son begs for this.

This bread was wonderful and delicious. Usually rye bread is very dense, but this was soft, like white bread. My 7yo ate it plain with margarine and had 2 slices! I stuck with the measurements, used avocado oil, carob powder and blackstrap molasses, and omitted the caraway. It rose beautifully set to 2lb size and whole grain option on my HB machine. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe, If you make it without breadmaking machine you can just watch it rise properly and bake but for the breadmaking machine it differs. 
If you like it dense and bitter you can just go with regular basic setting. 
I prefer rye bread to rise more to not resemble the "hard brick". So I first mix the daugh on dough setting (everey machine have different names for it but the goal is to let it mix well and rest for an hour) and  then I turn on the basic setting.

I've made it twice. Loved it! Needs more salt so I added 1,5 spoons and 2 tbsp of olive oil, no seeds, less sugar and it's my fav recipe now. Bread machine is working now :)

It looked really strange, but it tastes great. The texture is perfect.

Love this bread! I used the dough setting on my bread machine.  I then shaped it and put in a loaf pan and let it set covered 30 minutes and baked in the oven 30 minutes. I will make it again and use more caraway seeds.

This was a good recipe.  I did not use a bread machine, omitted the cocoa and brown sugar.  I left the loaf free-form on a cookie sheet... the bread is moist, dense... lovely.  THX for the recipe!
