Where did I go wrong?!?!?  I followed the recipe to a 'T' and my lemon filling did not thicken as directed.  So I ended up with lemom liquid:-(  I'd like to try this recipe again-any advice from my fellow chefs?

Unlike the chiffon pies that so many enjoy, I find this one not as tart. This is like the one on the side of a major selling cornstarch, but, since I buy generic, I was glad to find it on the web. I did not use the double boiler but cooked it over a low heat. For those that had a runny mixture, you didn't cook it long enough. Stir constantly and when it starts to "boil" like a "lava" bed, it will be thick enough to pour. The meringue also takes a long time to whip, so it is best to use an electric mixer. Also, egg whites whip better into meringue when they are at room temperature.

This is the best lemon pie recipe I've tasted!!! 
I registered here just to leave this review. I didnt have lemon zest but I added a few drops of lemon extract. Also, I dont have a double boiler but it cooks fine in a pan if you stir continually and watch the temperature. YUM!! Thank you for adding it!!

I liked the freshness of the ingredients used in this recipe! I did alter the proportions of sugar to lemon and lemon rind, so as to create a filling which had a more lemon-y flavor to it. I added more lemon juice and less sugar.  Otherwise, it's good recipe! :-)

Patience is the key here. I did modify the recipe after the fist go around, for my family it was too sweet and not lemony enough. Since the first pie, I use the following modifications: 1. Cook directly on the burner and whisk almost constantly, let the mixture boil for two minutes while whisking constantly so as to not burn (it takes a while). 2. Reduce the sugar to ¾ cup. 3. Increase lemon juice to ¾ cup. 4. Use 2 Tablespoons lemon zest.
Cooling the mixture before placing it in the crust is essential.
The four stars is for the recipe as written, before my modifications.

Just made this. Had to look up recipe as the one I usually use on the side of cornstarch box went out when I put cs in glass container. Licking the kettle it seems a bit tart...added 1/4 c more sugar.  Even goofed and put all but butter in sauce pan...cooked very slow.  Turned out GREAT!! Nice tang with swetness.  I'll save and make again!  Happy Thanksgiving to all the other Mad cooks!!!

I was so excited I finally found the directions for making my late Mother's lemon meringue  pie!  I had the list of ingredients of hers, but no directions on how to make it.   It tasted the same, I followed the directions from this recipe to a tee.  Everything went well, the lemon thickened to perfection and the meringue was piled high and browned.  With our tummies full of expectations I cut it after refrigerating it for at least 3 hours and the filling was runny with water.  It tasted fine, but was inedible.  I tossed it!  Can anyone tell me what went wrong?  Thanks in advance for any help.......

Excellent! My husband said this tasted like restaurant pie! Hint: I heated the lemon filling on medium, and let the eggs sit in room temp for a half hour or so before making the meringue. Turned out perfect!

I liked this recipe.  I will make it again, but I'll probably leave out the lemon zest, as I didn't like the texture it added to the pie.  Otherwise, it was very tasty.

I think the person whose filling didn't thicken enough might have taken it off the heat too soon.  It should be quite thick after adding the egg yolks, since the lemon juice will thin it down some.  This is a perfect recipe for lemon meringue pie, but if you stir constantly, you can make it in a heavy sauce pan over med. heat, and it will not take as long.

This pie was tasty, just make sure you have the patience. My filling didnt thicken after following the instructions to a T, even AFTER an hour, but then i went without the double boiler, and wha-la! it thickend instantly. I altered the sugar content the second time around, and added more zest and juice for a more lemoy-taste. It was FAB!

The pie was a little tart for my taste and I didn't even add the rind. It also did not set up very well. The filling was quite watery. The meringue was probably my fault, flat as could be, but it did have a nice sweet flavor. I will be looking for another lemon pie recipe.

I had no problems with the recipe, it was delicious, I have been looking for a lemony pie, I did add just 1 more tablespoon of lemon, only because I am a big fan of lemon. I had some filling left over so I just ate it out of the bowl. I will be making this again and again. Thanks

Mild tasting.  No problem with thickening, but not much of a lemon taste.  More of a cream pie texture.  Was ok, but on to the next recipe.

I tried this recipe, but made a few modifications as I have never used water to make the filling for my pies. I substituted 1 whole can of evaporated milk for the water, no lemon zest and about 7 tbsp of real lemon juice and 1tbsp of butter. Just remember - everyone likes a different amount of tartness. If the pie is not lemony enough for your taste. You can always stir in more at the end before pouring int pie crust.

This was runny, but tasted good. Just be careful when carrying and cutting it (it dripped all over me-LOL)! Flavor was great. I did not use a double boiler, just stir often and cook at a LOW temperature. THanks

Everyone loves my Lemon Meringue Pie.
I cook the pudding in the microwave using a 8-cup glass measure.
Only 3/4 cups of sugar in pudding.
That way you taste more of the lemon flavour.
One Tablespoon in the meringue.
A few grains of raw sugar can be sprinkled on top of the meringue.

This is by far the best lemon filling!
Just the right amount of tartness and flavor, as well as, a wonderful consistancy that doesn't run when cut into. Yummy!

Do not use a double boiler, mom never did, she stirred. and stirred over med heat, it will thicken, I can remember the waiting period, I thought it would never be ready, mom set her pie on the  counter with a trivet under it, for a couple hours, never put it in refrig. till it has cooled to room temp. that will make it runny. Also this is one pie you need to cool before cutting.

I probably should wait til we actually eat some, but we know from taste tests (?!) that the filling is perfect, tart and firm. I was worried it wasn't going to thicken, but I kept at it, stirring occasionally, and it thickened! I think the meringue is a trifle too sweet. I think half the sugar would work, and it isn't as spreadable as I thought it would be. But it looks quite beautiful. Oh! And I used animal crackers, because I had them, ground up in the blender, for the crust, mixed with melted butter and baked for 15 minutes at 350.

1. I made this pie this morning 1/31/16.  5 tbls of corn starch is way too much. 

2. Double Boiler does NOT work to thicken the lemon base curd. I stood at the stove for 45 min trying to get the lemon curd to thicken and it would not.

3. I had to dump the water out of the bottom portion of the double boiler and pour the lemon curd in the bottom part and then it thickened. 

4. Using 5 tbls of corn starch makes the lemon curd base like rubber.  
I have made lemon bases in a regular sauce pan and never had problem this way.  
All in all I am surprised that the Pies tastes good.

I am looking to make a very tart lemon pie for my mom, how can you make this pie extra tart. She has not had one since her sister died, I would like to surprise her.

I substituted lemons for lime and I added 1/2 drop of green food coloring.  I reduced the sugar in the meringue to 4 tbsp.  Delicious.

I followed the directions exactly as noted.  It came out runny.  I was so disappointed because it was my main dessert for Thanksgiving.  I should have read all of the other reviews first.  I will try it again without using a double boiler & will let it cool a bit before putting it in the pie shell.  I will also use eggs at room temperature for meringue.  It took a long time to whip it stiff.

I didn't use a double boiler, just stirred constantly.  Used lemon extract instead of zest.  Was perfect!

This was a big hit at my family dinner.  It was a bit finicky when I was making it.  I had to cook it way longer to get it to get the right consistency. Well worth it though. I would make this again!

I should have read the reviews first.  The pie was horrid, it didn't thicken, and the merang....forget it.  It didn't lift, or thicken nothing.  I suggest you find a different recipe.
