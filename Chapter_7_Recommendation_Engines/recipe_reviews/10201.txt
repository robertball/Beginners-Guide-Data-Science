Made these for Christmas.  I doubled the creamcheese like one other reviewer.  Everyone said they tasted like bakery cookies, and they looked like bakery cookies, too.  I don't even have a quality cookie sheet and the bottoms were perfect.  I used strawberry preserves for half and orange marmalade for the other half.  I did not garnish with powdered sugar.  The jewel tones of the filling were pretty enough.  
Probably the best cookies I have ever made.  This recipe definitely made me look like a good baker.  Thanks.

This is a great recipe.  I read some other reviews that described this cookie recipe as bland, but I would change that to subtle.  The flavors aren't bold, but I think that is a wonderful thing.  If you are making a cookie platter, the last thing you want are all the cookies to be screaming with over-sweetness & repeating flavors.  This is so nice because the cream chees & butter give a really rich dough & the apricot just gives a faint sweetness.  I rolled the dough out, & spread the jam on the top & rolled like a jelly roll & then cut the cookies to make pinwheels which is a nice variation.  I had another butter cookie recipe with the raspberry imprints, & so this was more of a variation then just the traditional print cookies.  Another nice thing is that it makes a LOT of cookies, it strained my Kitchen-Aid a little on the lower speeds but I only because I dumped in all the flour at once.  Add the flour slowly & you will avoid this!  Overall, very, very, yummy!!!

These cookies make a lovely presentation.  I tried them with both apricot & red raspberry preserves.  Both were very good.  After baking a few pans, I saw the suggestion to roll the dough in confectioner's sugar before baking.  This made them easier to work with.  I will make these cookies again.

What a great cookie!!  This is the type of taste that my family loves - not bland but not over sweet.  Since this made so many, I was able to experiment with each tray that went into the oven.  I put different flavored jams on several dozen - including Hot Pepper Jelly (it was a hit).  One batch, I rolled the cookie first into ground walnuts. I did end up sprinkling each batch with powdered sugar except those rolled in nuts.  Next time, I'm going to try rolling in colored granulated sugar.  Here's 3 BIG tips: 1. I prefer to bake on parchment paper.  2. With this cookie, I used the smaller end of my Melon Baller to make the indent instead of using my finger (I have nails).  I held my fingers around the ball shape and then pressed gently with the rounded side of the Melon Baller - almost to the bottom of the cookie. This gave the cookies uniform indents and reasonable size to fill with the jam.  Dip the Melon Baller in powdered sugar first to prevent sticking.  3. Put the lemon in the microwave for 15 seconds before zesting and juicing.  I was able to get 2 Tbls. juice out of one half of the lemon.  I refrigerated the dough before rolling into balls and had no problems.  This recipe would be great for a Cookie Exchange.  Definetly was a hit with everyone and was told to make them again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Next time I'll line my cookie sheet with aluminum foil - baked-on jam is hard to clean off!

I love this recipe!  We had a cookie exchange and my mom made this recipe and it was the best cookie at the party!  I normally don't care for filled cookies, but the cream cheese makes it delicious.  The one thing that my mom did differently to make it easier was to roll the balls in powdered sugar before she pressed them with her thumb.  It made them a little sweeter and much less sticky.

These are excellent! I decided to make the batter, chill overnight, and cook the next day. That didn't happen exactly.. after about 5 minutes in the fridge, I took out the dough and made a quick batch to try out. The dough worked well, even not chilled very long. 
I used 3 jellies - Apricot, Raspberry(as others suggested), and Apple (b/c I had it in the house).
The Winner - Apple! It is hard to beat the other flavors, but apple was just different enough to win.
Also, I made the original recipe size and used 2 sticks regular butter, 1 stick unsalted butter.
When cooling - I did 2 minutes on the pan, 2 minutes on the wire rack, then put the cookies and rack in to the freezer for 2 minutes, then let them continue cooling on rack on the counter. 
I am not sure why, but cooling them slightly in the freezer always helps them stay moist longer.

Excellent reviews! Even from long-time, picky cookie makers!

These cookies are fabulous!  I don't usually make thumbprints, but after reading all the good reviews I thought I'd give these a try.  I filled half with apricot preserves and half with lemon pie filling and everyone loved them.  I will definitely be making these again.

These cookies are beautiful and tasty. I made them for our Christmas party last year and they were a huge hit!  I used different fillings, and they were all good.  I also rolled some in finely chopped nuts for variation.  Make these cookies for your Christmas Cookie Tray--you won't be disappointed.

Delicious cookies.  The cream cheese makes the dough soft and stay soft after baking. The sweetness is subtle and the lemon/jam tartness is lovely with the light taste of the cream cheese.   As many reviewers have said, this is a subtle cookie, not a screemingly sweet bold cookie.  The lemon zest and apricot preserves are the major flavorings of this cookie.  Use good quality flour, zest your lemon properly (avoid the pith), and use good quality jam and you won't be disappointed.  Additions that I've found work are using bit of almond extract with raspberry jam.  A warning about the dough: as you finish the dough and roll them for the baking sheet, the dough will look fluffy and "too soft".  Resist the urge to add more flour.  The dough is perfect.

I made these for a cookie exchange at work, and they were a hit. They were the perfect texture, soft but not crumbly, with just enough sweetness. These are definitely going to be a tradition for me.

These are really bland. I was disappointed.
They look pretty but turn out dry and tasteless.

These are excellent. I did add a tsp. of vanilla extract to the dough. This is A LOT of dough to work with so use a big bowl. With a 1TBS. portion scoop, recipe yield was 112 cookies. I also used the back of the portion scoop dipped in powdered sugar to make the indentation. They freeze well too. I did use both strawberry and apricot filling. Both were excellent.  Not sure about those who state that they're not sweet enough or that they're dry. These cookies were perfect in texture and sweetness.

Totally awesome cookies! The cream cheese makes them special. I made one change. Instead of lemon zest I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract. Definitely roll in powdered sugar prior to adding preserves to thumbprint-gives a little more sweetness. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been using this recipe for about 3 years. They are always a big hit. I end up getting a lot of cookies out of the recipe so I drop them off to very excited family. I love to do these with red raspberry jam and apricot and apricot pineapple I make different flavor batches. I did try with some strawberry one time and did not like it at all.  I do increase the lemon juice and zest about 2.5-3 Tablespoons of each. Also these are pretty labor intensive so I chill the dough overnight and make the cookies the next day. Also do not over work your dough and keep an eye on the first batch sometimes mine are done at about 13 minutes. I dust with powder sugar after they cool a bit. And don't try them straigt out of the oven I always can't wait and burn myself b/c the jam is so hot!! Happy baking!!

Love these.  A huge hit in my house - which is normally all chocolate lovers.  The only change I made was to add 1 tbsp pure vanilla.  I have also used the dough recipe alone for a roll-out cookies dough and it works out really well.

This recipe is a definite keeper! I am an avid baker and often rely on the ratings of others before I will bring it to the table for my family. Since this was rated so highly, I gave it a try and made a few changes. I followed the advice of others and rolled these in powdered sugar to make for easier handling. I also used cherry preserves and when cooled, I made a powdered sugar glaze with milk and added a teaspoon of almond extract to it. The cherry and almond flavoring combo was divine. I also made the other half of the batch using apricot preserves and also drizzled the almond glaze over these, too. What a delicious treat! They are a cross between a sugar cookie with glaze and a classic thumbprint with preserves. You will not be disappointed with these tender cookies. Tip: Use parchment paper when cooking so the preserves don't leak out on the sheet pan. Of course, this will only happen if you push down too much on the cookie for the jam insert. A teaspoon worked perfectly when I dipped it in powdered sugar to form the jam divot. Plus, using parchment deters the cookie from browning too much on the bottom.

These are absolutely wonderful! I used apricot peach jam and I also added 1/2 tsp salt to 1 batch. For those of you who thought it was bland, try adding the salt. Brings out flavor and most cookies do have salt for a reason. I want to use double raspberry jam next time. This one is a keep for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After reading all the complaints I decided to add 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a splash of vanilla. They were sooo good! I used blackberry, apple, and apricot jam, and lemon curd. I found that the amount of fruit flavor was directly proportional to the quality of the jam. I made them bite-size and they only took about 10 minutes to bake. Took them to a football party and the guys ate every single one. I will have to make a batch topped with maraschino cherries, just like Mom used to = )

This is excellent! I made these twice. The first time I used the orginal recipe, the second time I adapted it. I omitted the Lemon and Lemon zest, and substituted Vanilla and added a tsp. of Butter extract. They came out delicious!
I also did some with apricot filling and some with Rasberry filling. A tip to make the centers all uniform.  I used my round metal 1/4 tsp measuring spoon, dipping it in flour after each time. They came out all uniform. This recipe will be a definite favorite.

This is the best cookie recipe, I know, because I have been making this recipe and my mother has been making this recipe for many, many years!!!  The Kookie is called "Kolaki"!!!  It is a Checkoslovakian and Bohemian recipe handed down to Checks and Bohemians for many years!!!  Of course it is the best Christmas cookie, rhat is when we always make it!!!  It is delicious with Solo Apricot filling, or with cheese, rasberry, and even crushed walnuts!!!  You can make them  from scratch or go to Sam's Club, and they have the dough and jellys already made up and ready to bake, then you dust them, don't roll them with powder sugar!!!  Or make them fresh, and they are just so delicious!!!  We rool out the dough, cut them out with a shot glass, and then top them with Apricot (my favorite)!!!  I have never, however tried making them with lemon jiuce or lemon zest!!!  I think maybe this person added this to give it a little more taste or zip!!!  I like it without the lemon, and have for many years!!!  I am 57 years old and have been making them since I was a kid, helping my Mom make them (and sneaking a taste of Apricot, when she wasn't looking.  I will try it with the lemon and see what I think!!!  I just wanted you all to know this was an old, old Checkoslovakian/Bohemian recipe, with a lemon twist!!!  Yers, I am of Check desent!!!  Enjoy, and have a great day!!!!  Paulette35

I found this recipe a little too late to make it for my Christmas cookie exchange, but I can guarantee it will be on the list next year!  I usually make regular thrumbprint cookies with confectioners' icing, which are delicious, but these are a little more special.  They could almost be considered delicate, with the cream cheese taste, and the beautiful apricot filling.  My kids loved them, and I couldn't get enough!  The only bad thing is the New Year's Resolution...

Very nice cookie.  Softer than most thumbprints.  Really enjoyed the addition of the lemon juice and zest.  Did some with raspberry jam, and they, too, were delicious.

These have a great flavor....especially on day 3 the cream cheese really comes out.  I used the back of a melon baller to make the indentation and used a medium pampered chef scoop.  I did not chill the dough as it was easy to work with immediately after mixing.  My husband and kids enjoyed these so much that I'm making more - this time with Blackberry jam and Cherry preserves.  May have to try the almond extract with this combination.

These are absolutely delicious.  I made them 3 times so far and they have been wonderful.  The last time I made them I put apricot preserves and prune filling as in rolled kolache.

First of all, I don't cook much, and this recipe was easy enough for me to handle. Secondly, I made a few small changes, based on ideas of my own and other reviews, and I think they came out great! As someone else mentioned, I used 2 packages of cream cheese. I also used 2 sticks of salted and 1 stick of unsalted butter. Rather than white flour, I used whole wheat, and I also added about a teaspoon of nutmeg to the dough. Rather than any kind of preserves for filling, I used a very simple cranberry jelly recipe (1 bag cranberries + 12 oz. water + 1/3 cup brown sugar -- boil water and sugar until dissolved, add cranberries and stir until all are burst and the skins come off). The end result is subtle and hearty (thanks, mainly, to the whole wheat flour). The mildly-sweet cookies offset the tartness of the cranberry nicely. Thanks for this great recipe!!

These cookies are yummy. I made these last Christmas, and they were a big hit. They look so professional. They are some work to make, but it's worth it. Can't wait to make these again this Christmas.

Another cookie from this site that will be made over and over.
I used raspberry seedless jam. MMMMMMMMmmm!
I want to be helpful to others to suggest that the trick to the filling melting on to the baking sheet for myself was that the fillig is best to put in the cookie very cold, as it sits out to be room temp. it will bake over onto the sheet, when it remained chilled, it remained in the cookie, no spillage!
thanks again for a wonderful cookie!

I've been making these for the past 2 years and I always get such rave reviews! So many people that out of all 7 varieties of Christmas cookies I make, these are their favorite. This year, I might switch things up a little and make half apricot and half raspberry filled.

I made these and drizzled them with a light frosting of milk/almond extract and confectioners sugar. Made them two days in a row by the dozens of dozens and people at work couldn't get enough of them. I was called evil for bringing something so delicious in to work that the girls starting their new years diets couldn't resist them!! Only thing I changed was to add a little vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract instead of the zest. Then I rolled them in confectioners sugar to keep them from sticking. No need to add extra flour they turn out way better and lighter if you don't.

In Law's favorites I made these the first year I hosted my In Laws for Christmas. Everyone loves them and they are the first cookie to go. Has become one of the cookie mainstays in the family. I've made them with different fillings, raspberry, strawberry, and apricot. These are consistently awesome.

These are pretty good.  I do like the flavor of them and I LOVE thumbprint cookies, but they do take a lot of effort and time.  For that reason I don't make them that often, which is probably good for my health.  ;o)  I like the Almond and Raspberry Thumbprints on here a bit better but it's a good way to use up some cream cheese, and the apricot preserves are awesome. Apricot is one of my favorite fruit!  I made the dough a few days ago then made them today.  I rolled the dough into balls first, placing them on a pan so I would have them ready every time I pulled a batch out of the oven.  Although sometimes I use a teaspoon to make the print, I used my thumb today.  Be careful not to overfill your thumbprints or they will overflow and make a big mess.  I put my preserves into a ziploc bag, then cut an opening in the corner so I can pipe it into the print.  It's much less messy that way!  15 minutes were perfect for mine.  thanks for the recipe!

I added this recipe to my 'Recipe Box' in December 2007 and have made them every Christmas since!  They are a must have Christmas cookie in our home.  The flavors are subtle, the cookies stay soft and moist and they are just so pretty.  We do lots of different jams: strawberry, apricot, raspberry, black cherry, blueberry, anything really!  My husband is a vegan so I've been making this vegan all these years with soy cream cheese & Earth Balance margarine and they come out perfect every time.  The only real changes I've made to the recipe over the years is to add extra lemon zest and about a TBSP of vanilla.  The sprinkle of confectioner's sugar after they cool is a must, it really makes them so pretty.  Thanks for such a perfect cookies recipe!

Awesome cookies!  We pretty much followed the recipe, but made two changes.  We left out the lemon zest (personal preference), and we followed other reviewer's advice by rolling the dough in powdered sugar before baking.  We used raspberry, boysenberry and apricot jam, and we also put chocolate chips in the middle - minus the jam, and all were wonderful.  And when they say it makes 7 dozen cookies, they are NOT kidding.  Great recipe...thanks Mellan!

*Wonderful* cookies!  I changed very little in this recipe.  First I rolled my dough balls in powdered sugar to make the cookie part a little sweeter and I used a variety of jams in the middle to give a lot of color!  I used blackberry, apricot, strawberry (my fave) and blueberry!  they all tasted great!

Delicious!  I made these to add to gift tins because I thought they would be pretty.  They were also very good.  I used apricot and also red raspberry preserves for a different color and flavor.  Both were nice.  The cream cheese makes the cookie very moist and creamy and the lemon gives a little extra zip.

Butter + cream cheese + apricot ALWAYS = delicious!   The dough was a little too sticky and the first batch didn't hold their shape, but after adding a little more flour they worked out perfect.

I have to agree with several of the other reviewers on here.  The cookie is oddly fluffy and very bland.  I even took into consideration that other people had said the cookie was bland and went heavy on the lemon zest.  Still it was quite bland.  I'll try to make a larger indent in the rest of the batch so that I can add more apricot jam, maybe that will help.

this was the first time i made this recipe and got 7 1/2  dozen cookies, using a level T. per cookie dough...next time, i won't chill the dough too long, as it made it too hard to form cookies...i like to bake on parchment paper, as you don't have to grease the pan and the cookies come off easily and no clean-up....will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious.  I used apricot, lemon curd, guava, strawberry and mixed berries as the fillings.  All turned out perfectly.  The only problem is you will need to double the batch because these little darlings will go fast.

These made some good lookin' cookies; not to mention very tasty too.  The all around favorite was a good lemon curd filling; I tested these on a bunch of construction workers - Pile Drivers Local 34.  I also made Apricot; Guava Butter; Orange; and Strawberry.  They were so pretty all together.

Another yummy recipe.  I used apricot and blackberry jam.  Make some with a chocolate chunk in the middle and some with walnuts and pecans.  I left the rest plain and ate those myself.  Baked on parchment paper and they were perfect. The paper also keeps the jam off your pans.  Fine recipe.

This recipe is awesome.  I rolled the cookie balls in pecans before making the thumbprint and I think it made the cookie even better.  This cookie has been stealing the show from all the other cookies on my Christmas cookie trays this year.

I used 11/4 cup butter and margarine and I also used Neufchatel cheese to cut the fat a little. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and used strawberry preserves. They do seem like little biscuit cookies, but adding the lemon juice and vanilla make them a cookie. They are nice and soft. I was generous w/ the preserves! They were very good. This was the first time I made thumbprint cookies.

This was awesome. I love Kolacky but don't love the work involved rolling out the dough, this was a great substitute, so easy and so good!

these are the best thumbprints I've ever had. I did increase the lemon juice to 3 tablespoons and the lemon zest to about 2-1/2 teaspoons. I did not change anything else. Perfect!  
For variety, I rolled some in decorative white crystalized sugar and filled with orange marmalade, Solo Apricot filling, or Solo Raspberry filling. Just wonderful.

Love the fluffy texture of this cookie! It is also very tasty and melts in your mouth.  I like that it is not very sweet, however, I do plan on adding a small amount more of sugar on the next batch. Not a lot more... just a little. Agree that cold dough makes for the nicest texture for handling and also for the finished product.

These were okay, but not what I really wanted. They are ALMOST a shortbread cookie, but not quite anything else either! Nice texture, but you need filling for sure! We tried several diff preserves, and the best was orange marmalade - it added a nice tart balance to the cookie. I dusted them with the confectioners sugar - it helps them to not all stick together in the jar! Would I make them again?  I really doubt it - the results are not worth the ingredients it takes.  But they do look nice on a tray! :  )

I panicked this year because I lost my copy of this recipe but luckily found it again on this website. I make this every year, it is a wonderful cookie. It reminds me of the Hungarian Kolachky without all of the work of rolling and cutting the dough. I did find using apricot pastry filling instead of jam worked much better, the filling didn't run all over when baked. Other than that this recipe is perfect.

I was disappointed.  The cookie wasn't sweet enough for us.  To me, they tasted just like biscuits with jam.  Which is fine, but I was expecting a cookie, not a biscuit.

This is THE cookie!!  I don't know why anyone would say it's too bland.  It's the perfect soft cookie that compliments the apricot jam to the "T"!!  I can't wait to visit my father-in-law next week.  I've just finished baking up a huge batch for him and he will LOVE them.  THANKS!!!

I made these for the first time this weekend.  My son love them. I think they are quite tasty and a welcome change to all the chocolate and "dark" cookies.  I used raspberry jelly also and they were just as good.  I will definitely make them again.  I love the cream cheese and butter flavor mixed . . . I didn't have lemon zest so just used the lemon juice.  Thanks for putting these on the cookie countdown . . . I never would have found them.

These were a hit and a beautiful addition to my cookie tray! My Dad said these were the best thumbprints he ever had (must be the cream cheese!). What a nice fun dough to work too with even if it was a little sticky (I wet my hands as others suggested when rolling). I halved the recipe and found even when I rolled very small balls I still got many nice sized cookies since they puffed while baking. My only change was to roll the dough balls in finely chopped pecans before pressing in the circle because the first batch just looked too plain. I will definitely be making these babies again! Thanks!

Very quick and easy to make, and they work out quite well as pressed cookies. The lemon juice and zest makes them way too tart, though. Next time I'm going to leave it out; I'll revise this review at that time.

I just tried this recipe and my family loved it. I had to leave out the lemon juice and zest because my granddaughter is allergic, but I just added almond and vanilla extracts. I also made about half of them with cherry preserves. Luscious!! Merry Christmas to all! (And thanks for sharing, Mellan)

Lovely cookie, it is light and very tasty. It really did make a nice addition to the platter.  I rolled some of them in coconut. I doubled the recipe and used an assortment of fillings. The cookies looked like jewels on my trays. Thanks for sharing Mellan.

These are excellent!  I burned the first batch using a regular cookie sheet.  They came out fine when I switched to clay cookie sheets.  I used peach jam that I preserved this past summer and the cookies were fantastic!

Like many others, I used apricot as well as raspberry preserves and they were great.  The lemon juice and zest really don't make them "lemony"; my husband couldn't even tell!   Definitely a recipe I'll make for parties.  Very easy to make the dough ahead and keep chilled till you're ready.

This is a great recipe. I tried variations, I rolled the 1 inch balls in finely chopped almonds then used apricot preserves(it tasted good), then I rooledthem in finely chopped walnuts with stawberry and that was awesome! The only thing I found was my cookies didn't have any hint of lemon whatsoever; I used the lemon ppel in the jar instead of fresh. Giselle

I made these for work and everyone loved them. They are nice because the are not super sweet but very buttery. I used raspberry and strawberry preserves but will use apricot next. I followed the recipe except I didn't have lemon juice but they were still fantastic.

Instead of using apricot preserves I instead made some lemon curd and used that with fantastic results. So tender, moist, and absolutely delicious! I did cut the baking time down to 13 minutes as I found 15 to be a little too long.

The recipe and several reviews suggest different jams and fillings I tried a mince meat filling. It worked really well. If your looking for variety in your fillings you might want to give mincemeat a try.

This was a great recipe! I mixed it up a bit and used blackcurrant jam in half of the cookies and apricot in the rest. The only flaw was that I had to turn up the heat to 200C for them to cook properly. Otherwise perfect cookies that my family and friends devoured...!

Like some of the reviewers said, these cookies are rather bland and more like shortbread texture.  It made a huge batch of large size cookies.  My daughter said she would like the cookies if they had more filling.  The recipe itself is good.  It is just not pleasing my taste.

Amazing! I made a mistake and doubled the cream cheese and they actually turned out even better! Moist and delicious! Try using tart preserves; it offsets the sweetness of the cookie and gives it a nice kick. My new favourite!

These cookies are very good.  I forgot to add almond & vanilla extracts but they were still tasty.  We did roll in powdered sugar & some in coconut before baking.  We used alot of homemade apricot & strawberry jam in these & we found out if you use too much, there's more on the sheet than in the cookie after baking.  Next time we'll try pie filling for the center(s).

I made these, last year for Christmas, just to add color to my cookie plate.  But they were really good!!  Everyone loved them!  I used raspberry jam, though, instead of apricot.  Delicious!

I was a little disappointed in these cookies, seeing as they had such rave reviews. They were fairly dry and bland, perhaps I did something wrong. Also, I tried a million different ways, but I could not get the thumbprint to stay a thumbprint. And I have been very successful with different recipes in the past. The cookies rose to a ball-like shape every time, looking exactly like a bagel.

Just ok, bland, biscuit like texture. They also get stale very quickly. Argo cornstarch thumbprint cookies have a much nicer texture and flavor.

This was a terrific thumbprint recipe.  It was a tender dough and easy to work with.  I added vanilla powder to it...1 tsp..and a pinch of salt.  I found it worked best to chill for about 2 hrs.  I, also, used cherry preserves with the apricot.  The powdered sugar was a nice touch..like snow.

Best after sitting a few days in an airtight container.  I added about 2x the lemon zest suggested, just for more flavor, and it really perks up the dough, though it still has a subtle taste.  Don't expect these to be "in your face" cookies.  Used cherry preserves as well as apricot, both delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly and chilled dough for two hours - used powdered sugar on my hands to make rolling a bit easier - delicious!!! And so pretty. Made half apricot and half strawberry. Will definitely make again!

I have made these for several years at Christmas and everyone loves them. Sometimes  I add different  zests or extracts. I have filled the thumbprint with every kind of  preserve and have even filled cooled ones with chocolate ganache (yum-tastes like swiss fudge cookies). When I don't feel like getting too sticky from the preserves, I press a candied cherry in the center instead.

These are the best Thumbprint cookies I have ever had.  I followed the advice of one of the reviewers here, and doubled the cream cheese.  I rolled them in crushed walnuts, put strawberry jelly on them, and then after they were baked, drizzled powdered sugar mixed with heavy cream and vanilla extract.  They were fabulous!!!

These were really good! I chilled the dough overnight. I dropped the balls of dough into confectioners sugar after rolling. To make the thumbprint part, I used the end of the handle of my plastic ice cream scoop, dipped in confectioners sugar. Used cherry preserves in place of apricot, and used lemon extract in place of the zest. Everyone loved them!

I have no idea why anyone would say these are bland, they have fantastic flavour. I have substituted the lemon for 1 tbsp vanilla and will change up the toppings. A spicy cherry jelly is fantastic, I also used guava paste which is sturdy enough it doesn't run off the cookie at all. I also like to try rolling the dough in different things before indenting and adding the jelly - so far crushed walnuts are the tastiest, sesame seeds look fantastic and powdered sugar adds delicacy and sweetness, I'm sure there are a lot of other things that would work too. My only issue is I actually find the dough to be too sweet, next time I will experiment with cutting down the amount of sugar and possibly adding more cream cheese if I want to work with a pepper or spicy jelly. 
Note - prep time seems incorrect for this recipe, rolling the dough and adding the jelly takes longer for me. Also I didn't make 7 dozen, I must have made my cookies larger but I ended up with 4 dozen.

I made these exactly as recipe said, and I didn't care for them. The dough was kind of gummy, and bland. I used orange marmalade and strawberry preserves, as there is allot of dough.they were sweet, and that's due to the jelly. Something is missing.Will try another recipe next time.

Loved these!  Nice, light texture and the apricot adds just the right amount of sweetness.  I stuck close to the recipe: I left out the lemon zest and added 2 tsp of almond extract.  Yum!

I had really high hopes for these, but they didn't come out well as I had hoped.  I made them for the holidays and followed the recipe exactly as stated.  They ended up kind of too heavy and doughy, not crisp on the bottoms.  I guess the best way to describe then was that they were just too soft.  I'd also probably make smaller balls...a tablespoon per cookie seemed like too much.  Many guests said they liked them, although there were a lot left over, which tells me something!  The fresh lemon juice and peel was a nice addition, though.

I am giving this a 5 star rating based upon reactions from other people. I wasn't really a fan of these cookies but when I gave them out for Christmas everyone loved them. I had to print the recipe out for a few of them!
I didn't have Apricot Jam so I used Cherry Preserves and substituted vanilla for the lemon juice and zest.

We make these for Christmas.  For some reason mine turned out flat.  The batter does become messy if not cold.  I used the confectioner's sugar while working with dough.  While the taste was good, I probably won't make these again.

Do not skimp on the chilling step, the dough will be very difficult to work with if it isn't cold enough. My finger was sticking every time I made an indentation. I varied the flavor of the dough by skipping the lemon zest and adding vanilla and almond extracts and using cherry filling. Really yummy, buttery but more tender than spritz. Sadly, not as good a texture after storage overnight.

These came out just great for me! I had no real butter so I used margarine in its place but it had no ill effects. I used peach jam as I had some on hand and they        came out perfect. I did check them after 13 minutes and did not let them go to 15 as the bottoms would have burnt. I am going to try using blueberry pie filling in them and see how that works too!

I love this recipe! I find it just sweet enough without being overly sweet. I made it with almond extract and cherry preserves which made for a very lovely holiday cookie. This is definitely going to be part of my holiday cookie rotation!

Wow, these are GREAT!!  I wasn't too sure about the apricot filling, but they are a perfect compliment to the cream cheese and slightly tangy lemon.  I did some with apricot preserves and some with raspberry jam, and both were delicious.  These are light cookies that just melt in your mouth.  It is hard to stop with just one!

I made a small batch of these thinking that they would be similar to a recipe my mom once made, but I was disappointed.  I felt that they were too soft and had no flavor.

These cookies are so easy to make and the recipe makes a TON of cookies. They freeze great and are perfect to pull out a few for company or with a cup of tea. I got rave reviews for them when I brought them to my family members over the holidays!

I used raspberry as well as apricot, these are so good.  And they are pretty looking.  Not very hard to make.  I like the slight lemon flavor.  Left out the lemon zest and added extra juice.  They were still yummy.

Cookies were good and I know it's all my fault not paying enough attentions to it but I was a little disappointed since it wasn't really anything super-duper special about these cookies than just a regular cream cheese cookies with some preserves on it...

These cookies were just "okay" in my opinion. The cookie didn't have much flavor, became hard, and didn't store very well.  The powdered sugar evaporated within 4 hours of dusting the cookie.  I don't think that I would make these again.

I make this recipe and I double the cream cheese as some have suggested. I use guava jelly instead of apricot jam. It’s a big hit with my family and friends.

I have been making theses for Christmas for a few years now. I double the lemon zest and juice to give more lemon flavor. I like a lot of lemon. They taste fresh and not too sweet. I have tried all different fruit preserves but apricot is still my favorite.

I made this recipe twice, once last Christmas and again yesterday, this is what Happened.
At Christmas, I made the recipe as stated minus the lemon zest and the cookies were to put it frank less than appetizing,  not good.

Yesterday I thought I'd try it again so read the reviews and decided to add the extra 8 oz of cream cheese to total 16 oz which made the difference.  I again left out the lemon zest.
My Family ate all the cookies as soon as they cooled on each batch, therefore the recipe with the extra cream cheese and minus zest earned 5 stars.

The dough is too sticky to work with and must be refrigerated.  I did roll in the powdered sugar which also helped.

I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great! They were gobbled up so fast, I barely was able to eat one myself. I admit, the cookie base tastes a bit like a biscuit. Despite this, these were delicious, and the apricot jam was the perfect sweet note. I will definitely make this again.

IF ANYONE WANTS A QUALITY, EASY BISCUIT RECIPE, 
omit the jam and sugar. It tastes exactly like Red Lobster's.
Maybe even add in some cheese and herbs for taste.

Great flavour. More cakey than shortbread.

I did add two full bricks of cream cheese, as others had recommended. Also used cake and pastry grade flour. Used apricot, blueberry, raspberry preserves for variety...blueberry and lemon is pretty awesome.  

The sticky batter texture was a but unruly, but I dusted my hands with a bit of flour.  Drizzled white Belgian chocolate on the top (the wafers are sold at the bulk foods places).

All in all a nice surprise.

This is a nice cookie with just a hint of flavor depending on what jam you use. If you like sweet this is not  the cookie for you. Cookie was very light, flaky and very mild flavored. The burst of flavor comes from the jam you use. I used assorted jams I had on hand. Sprinkled powdered sugar added for more sweetness.

These are fantastic.  Not overly sweet and can be customized by using various preserves.  I’ve tried them using both apricot and raspberry and both were fantastic.  Can’t wait to try even more variations.  Thanks for one of my new favorite cookie recipes!

I halved the recipe as I didn't need that many cookies.  I ended up putting the full recipe amts. for cream cheese, lemon zest, and lemon juice trying to get some flavor in the cookie.  I used a cherry preserve, which was fine...the cookie is very bland though.  I was cooking 1-2 cookies (no jelly) at a time and tasting them before dough set up completely from cooling.  I'm not sure what to add to fix it.  I even added some salt to the dough, and that didn't help either.  My fingers are crossed that after a few days, the cream cheese flavor will get stronger as another review said. It wad easy to put together, but tastes as if the ingredient flavors worked against each other instead of together.  Won't make again.

This recipe is a good base recipe, I add a teaspoon of almond extract to really bump it up a notch.  

Be sure to make your thumb prints pretty deep as your preserves will melt a bit and it gives it more room to sit up as the cookie cools.

I use white chocolate drizzles to keep the cooking from being sticky on top and be able to package it easily.

Really great base recipe tho.  You can tweak it to your preference flavor wise with vanilla etc, if you skip the citrus.

These  turned out excellent!   I had some Italian plums in the freezer so I thawed some and pureed them -and they were the consistency of jam.  I did add some sugar to the plums but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  Yummy - just like shortbread cookies.

I doubled the cream cheese and added 1 Tbsp vanilla extract. I let the dough chill before rolling into confectioners sugar. Great recipe.

This is a good base recipe, but it required a bit of "bumping up" to make it less bland. I pretty much doubled the amount of lemon zest and lemon juice, and I added a splash of vanilla. Everyone loved them.

Worked great- used strawberry preserves. And my tip for perfect "thumbprint" indentation? A baby carrot. made nice fillable holes that turned out (after baking) looking like a thumbprint. Also put preserves in plastic sandwich bag and cut off  corner to fill thumbprints

They turned out just like the picture but had no taste, very bland. I was so looking forward to a cream cheese cookie..I’ll try the Kolacky next time as they have less flour & same amount of cream cheese.

I'm not sure if we cooked them for too long but we tried to cook them until they were "golden brown on the edges". These turned out hard and not that enjoyable at all.

I made these during XMas time. They are delishious!!  And so fluffy!
A few adjustments I made: double (low fat!) cream cheese (Philadelphia), double lemon zest, a bit more sugar, a yellow food coloring and two splashes of orange aroma.
After reading the reviews I used the measuring spoon for the indent and dipped it in water each time which worked a treat. Next time I will use a teaspoon for measuring out the portions as the cookies grew enormously and stuck together.

This cookie REALLY surprised me. I made this for a Christmas work party and everyone loved them! Normally I don’t care for apricot anything so I bought raspberry preserves just in case but I feel the apricot filled ones tasted better than the raspberry ones. They came out incredibly soft and the perfect amount of sweetness. The only difference I did was adding in an additional 1/2 block of cream cheese. Refrigerated the dough the night before and cooked it the next morning. Instead of using your thumb, I took a 1 tsp measuring spoon, dipped the rounded end in powdered sugar and pressed it into each cookie. I wanted a more rounded, professional look then sprinkled powdered sugar on top once cooled. These are now my favorite cookie!

Perfect jam-filled cookies!!! I rolled some of the balls in crushed almond slices before indenting the and filling them. BTW, I used a  homemade apricot jam and triple berry jam...sooooo perfect!  The lemon zest and juice added to the crust made the flavor absolutely delectable. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are delicious! Not overly sweet which is perfect for us! I needed to chill my dough longer in order to get it firm enough to work with. I used apricot and blackberry jams. Both are great!

These cookies turned out very well! They are not a super sweet cookie which I like. Next time I will try doubling the cream cheese like 2 other reviewers did as I like rich cookies. I made these for Christmas using strawberry and peach jelly and they were so pretty. I do have to be careful and not make the cookies too big and do not overbake them, they will be slightly brown on the bottom and do spread out just a little while baking.

These are my favorite holiday cookies now. Just know they take forever to make but are so worth it! I put apricot preserves in most of them and tried strawberry in a few. Very good--next year I will make half apricot and half strawberry or raspberry.

This is my first time making thumbprint cookies, and they turned out pretty well. I did scale the recipe back to about a third just because I wasn't sure how they would turn out. I ended up using 1/2c butter, 4oz cream cheese, 1/2c sugar, 1/2tsp baking powder, 1 egg, and 1 1/2c flour.  I would use this recipe again.

These are pretty good, but maybe next time I will double the cream cheese and make them a little bigger and add more jam. I used apricot preserves in half and red raspberry jam in the other half. I actually preferred the red raspberry jam cookies better. They were slightly sweet.

Made a batch of these a few days ago, refrigerated and baked them today.  They turned out beautifully!  I did half raspberry seedless jam and half apricot.  As another reviewer suggested, I used a round measuring spoon to make the "thumbprints".  I also put the jam in a ziplock bag and cut off the corner to neatly fill them.  Worked like a charm!  Oh--almost forgot!  I used almond extract for flavoring instead of lemon/zest out of personal preference.  These are great with a cup of coffee or tea and will add a pretty touch of color to my cookie trays!

I halved the recipe, added a few drops of vanilla extract and a bit more lemon than called for. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! I used apricot and raspberry preserves - so yummy with tea!

The dough was actually really easy to work with, I used raspberry and strawberry jam instead of apricot, it adds the extra umph that it needs. I followed instructions but I doubled the cream cheese as suggested but maybe next time I will try the original.  Quick to make and you don't have to be a chef to e successful.

I used the cream cheese as one person suggested.  The cookies are very good.  The only thing is they take some time to make.  between chilling the dough. rolling it in balls, putting the indent and then the jelly.  They really take 15 minutes in the oven.  If you are going to make these plan for them to take time.  My daughter and I had an assembly line.  I balled, she indented and filled with Jelly.

I make a variation of this by rolling them in pinwheel fashion. This recipe has been in my family for several generations. It is the favorite cookie at Christmas. It is a very subtle cookie that is a nice addition among all the really sweet stuff.. Even folks who claim they would not like these end up loving them!

I did everything on the recipe. I have a gas stove, so after 15 min in the oven at 350 degrees, it still was not fully cooked so I up the degree to 375 and added 6 more mins. I had my husband taste test it and he said it was pretty good.

This is the 1st review & 1st recipe I tried from this site. If you follow the recipe exactly as it is the cookies taste delicious-melt in your mouth. However, it is very difficult to make balls of the dough with indention and even rolling in sugar as some reviewers suggest doesn't help. The 1st few I baked as per the recipe and made the apricot paste filling at home so they look bland in the photo. The next lot I made, added color to paste and some more flour to the dough. The color was a welcome change and more flour made it easier to roll into balls but it affected the taste which was not melt-in-the-mouth but biscuity. Guess next time will just make them as they are without the thumprints:) 
P.S: I would like to know if they can be stored in an air-tight jar outside or need to be refrigerated so they don't get spoilt.

These were delicious cookies! The cream cheese gave them a wonderful texture and tang. I used homemade blueberry jam instead of apricot, which stained the surrounding top of the cookie a purple color, but that's the fault of the jam. A very versatile recipe that has quickly become a favourite at my house.

Really liked these cookies. Just made them for the husband for Valentines Day. I add a 1/4 tsp salt, and I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract along with the lemon juice. I only made a half batch, didn't really want 7 dozen cookies. I got 4 dozen. I also used apricot filling that I buy near the bakery section of my food store . It's niot as runny as preserves and is totally apricots, no sugar added. I rolled the balls in granulated sugar, that's what I do when I make kolachy..they were great, will make again

I thought these were a little bland.  Thank goodness I read prior reviews and added some vanilla extract.  They were just a cookie to me.  I did roll the cookies in conf. sugar before baking and that I am sure helped with the flavour a bit.

I needed a second cookie for a holiday luncheon and had some cream cheese to use up so this recipe fit the bill.  I halved the recipe.  I skipped the lemon juice and zest and instead added some almond and vanilla extracts.  I unfortunately had only some cheap raspberry jelly to use which ran out of the cookie and all over the cookie sheets but that was the fault of the jelly.  I will be sure to make these again with the lemon flavoring and the apricot jelly.  Thanks!

I actually baked them  today, it works better to keep then dough chilled in between oven batches. I prefer using either strawberry, cherry etc jams (reds) just because apricot was so overused in my family for cookies. The cream cheese keeps them moister than other recipes I've tried.

Though I did not use apricot jam, these were the best cookies I have had in a  long time. I used Strawberry jam instead. I usually make cookies for the family, and do not eat them myself. This time, I ate them all:)

I was disappointed in this recipe after reading all of the good reviews.  I made the cookies as directed-no changes- and found them to be fairly bland.  Not sure what the big deal was on the reviews.  The raw dough was the best part about these.  Won't be making these again.  On another note, using the sandwich bag to fill them worked great, and I will be using that method on a different thumbprint recipe.

I don't like sugar cookies so I decided to try these. They are wonderful. My hubby who doesn't have a sweet tooth ate 15 for breakfast. Made during Christmas these look wonderful on a tray. Make with several different kind of preserves for a festive look and taste. Thanks for the great recipe

Something different for the gourmet- try red pepper jelly in the center. They were served at a high-end restaurant and were so delicious.  Red pepper jelly is a product from Florida.

These were really good for thumbprints. The lemon this recipe calls for is perfect! I still found them a little plain so I drizzled a glaze of confectioners sugar, milk, and rum extract over the tops. I used all different types of preserves for these. Yum!

These are melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Love them!  Used Strawberry Preserves as that's what I had on hand. Definitely going in My Recipe Box and will be added to my Christmas Cookie Collection!

I made these cookies for the first time. They turned out very pretty. I used apricot and raspberry for filling. Next time I will add some almond extract to spice them up a bit, as they are not really a sweet cookie.

Yummy!  I didn't have lemon zest but I really didn't miss it.  I used apricot but I also used raspberry preserves.  The two cookies looked beautiful together!

I make these every year for christmas. They are easy to make. I usually divide the dough and add red and green food coloring to it for a more festive look. However I've always felt the taste of these was just mediocre.

I agree to use apricot preserves becoz if using like strawberry flavor which is too strong that over the cookies.  I have made several times.  Currently I give up any preserve, make it into Cheese Cookies.  I reduce 1/4 cup of sugar.  The sweetness is just fine to go with coffee...thanks for the recipe ^^

These cookies actually came out pretty good. I had to make a few adjustments to the recipe but overall this is a good recipe base to work from. I ended up doubling the cream cheese amount (one of them being the low-fat version), substituted 1/2 of the sugar with Splenda, used egg substitute, and used apricot, dark raspberry, and strawberry jams. I also rolled them in powder sugar prior to making the thumbprint like one reviewer suggested and it did make it easier to roll (less sticky!). I made them in 2.5 to 3 teaspoon-full sizes and had to bake them for about 25 - 28 minutes at 350 degrees and they came out golden and yummy! My hubby inhaled them as soon as he got home from work! I'll have to make more tomorrow!

Bland and floury texture not much taste except for the jelly. I love cream cheese and thought this would make the cookie more shortbread. I quess I like my cookies a bit sweeter and not like cardborad. I will try another thumb print receipeand use as my basic cookie dough. I will not make this again and will remove from my receipe box.

These are very good and a nice addition to a holiday cookie tray.  I filled some of the cookies with seedless raspberry jam and some with apricot jam.  I'm rating this recipe a "4" because I've had other cookies I like better than these, but these are good and I will probably make them again around the holidays.

These cookies are so very tasty.  I like the convenience of being able to prepare the dough one day ahead and then baking when I have more time the next day.  The dough was very easy to work with, and the cookies looked so pretty.  You can sprinkle the powdered sugar very generously, because it will melt into the jam and look very pretty on your plate.

I am giving this recipe a 5, they are the best.  So flavorful and tender.  I used all kinds of jelly and marmalade, oh so pretty.  I dusted each one with 10X sugar and they look wonderful.  My husband asked for a cookie with jelly in the middle like "Mom" used to make and I found it!  He was instantly transported to childhood.  I will make these again and again.

Smooth creamy cookie.  Different from the traditional thumbprint recipes because of the cream cheese.  Try leaving a few empty and filling with colored frosting after baking.

These are really easy and really good - I used strawberry preserves...
It's a little sweet but I'm still obsessed!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I used strawberry jam instead of apricot and it tasted fabulous.  My 2 year old loves it.  She keeps stealing them off of the counter while they are cooling.

This is  one of the best cookie recipes I ahve come across in a long time. The second time I made them I tried Plum jam on part of them and it was good but not as good as the Apricot. I would bet peach would be great too. I  am going to try it the next time I make them.

These cookies were very easy to prepare.  They taste more like little cakes than cookies!  However, mine turned out a bit more floury than I like.

This cookie has great texture and wonderful flavor -it's creamy, cakey and lemony
and the apricot flavor tops it off so well...

These cookies are wonderful!  This recipe has now replaced my older version as the cream cheese gives a delightful taste & texture.  I did use more preserves and less lemon as that is our preference.  Great cookies!!  Everyone who received them from me at Christmas raved....
