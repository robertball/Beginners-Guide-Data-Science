Have made this twice so far, both times to GREAT reviews from guests.  This is incredibly easy to make, especially if you're pinched for time.  The first time I tried this, kids from 5 to 15 loved it.  The second time, I added some chipotle powder, and doubled the amount of spices, but we like foods spicy.  The trick to this is to remove the rind; I find that non-brie enthusiasts like it because the rind's removed.  An excellent choice for the holidays.

I couldn't find the round sourdough and so used the Hawaiian sweet bread which was still great.
The Hawaiian bread came in a foil pan and I wrapped the entire thing in foil to bake and then transported it to a party where I unwrapped it. It was still hot and bread was still nice and soft (did not get mushy or dry out)...it was a big hit! I think roasted garlic on top of the cheese would be good too!

This was a big success at my dinner party last night.  When I went to sprinkle the mixed spices on the top of the cheese I chickened out and didn't put all of it on.  I was worried that there would be too much spice.  I regret that decision now, but the appetizer was still extremely popular.  I'd suggest buying a separate sourdough baguette so you have extra bread to spread the brie on.

This was quite yummy!  Next time I would buy an extra bagueete, since I had to use crackers initially to dip in the cheese.  As we continued eating, we pulled the sides of and the cheese was melted on.  I also think I might use a wheel and 1/2 since I think it could've used just a bit more cheese.

Sooo easy and sooo good.  Doesn't need anything changed.  The amount of brie doesn't look like enough, but it is.  We always cut the hollowed out bread into pieces once the brie is gone - that's the best part!

I love brie, but the spices were too much.  I had to scrape them off!

This has become our new party favorite.  Everyone's always excited and absolutely loves it.  It's easy to prepare ahead of time and then just stick in the oven wherever you are.  Wonderful!

To give this five stars I would have personally cut the cheesewheel longwise so that I had two circles and made two of these.  The spices were PERFECT!  There was just more cheese than bread.  Fantabulous recipe will definitely be a do again.  Perfect for a party appetizer or even for a fast dinner when lazy! :)
