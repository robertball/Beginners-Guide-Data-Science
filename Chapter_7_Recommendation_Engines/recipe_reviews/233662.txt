I refer to this recipe every time. It is absolutely amazing! - I know several ways to prepare red beans as well as pinto beans- this one is by far the best and very worth the tine and ingredients to make it.

Loved this.   I had to make it with what I had on hand.   I soaked the beans over night.  I then started them in the crockpot with chicken broth I had frozen.  I used no water.   I did add 2 bay leaves.  I added a few slices of sausage for flavor.  I had garlic head I had roasted and added that with onion.   I added paprika and cayenne pepper.  The beans cooked most of the day and night because I like using the low setting.  I mashed some when done to add creamy texture.  I then added the rest of the sausage and had some chicken I added too.   It tasted wonderful.

I made with only one change, I added smoked turkey to it. I allowed the turkey to sit in the slow cooker with the chicken broth for about an hour, so that it will get tender and easy to shred off the bone, then I added all of the ingredients. It came out great considering that the turkey has its own seasoning as well. This will be in my regular rotation.

OH good gravy this is amazing!  My husband has been craving this and I decided to try it for the first time.  He was scared at first and questioned...everything...but after two bowls he said it was the best red beans and rice he's ever had!  That's right...I impressed the big guy.  The entire house smelled wonderful! ****I soaked the beans overnight in water so that they'd be good and ready on time! I also substituted chicken broth for the water.  That's it!  Did everything according to the directions.  It's a little bland for our taste but perfect for the kids and all we had to do was add salt and hot sauce to it in our own bowls.  Served over white rice...of course...along with corn bread.  Awwww yeah...

I don't like to downgrade a recipe unless I follow it exactly but  I did make a change or two based on personal preference.  My one star "downgrade" is for what I believe to be a "technique" problem.  I believe that dry beans HAVE to be soaked and the soaking water discarded before using in any recipe.  This makes them more palatable, they cook faster and soaking  helps prevent "digestive issues".  I not only soaked my beans overnight, I then cooked the dish for  for one hour on high, then decreased to low for the remaining 7 or so hours and the texture was great.  This is the first time that I've used a slow cooker to do kidney beans, so I wanted to err on the side of too much time rather than not enough.  I'm afraid that cooking from dry for 8 hours, in addition to the comments above, they may well not have been done.  As for the changes that I made (that don't go to the one star deduction)...I omitted the green pepper because neither of us likes them.  I also used about 1/2 pound of ground sausage that I browned and drained first because that's what I had on hand.  Overall, it came out great and I will be making again.  I appreciate DaleAnn82's  "to taste" when it comes to the celery, garlic, salt and pepper.  I went with more garlic since we can't get enough!  I also started out with about  1 1/2 tsp each of salt and fresh coarsely ground black pepper.  I tasted the "juice" every hour or so and adjusted both salt and pepper up before finishing.  For the folks commenting t

The only changes I made was that I left out the celery and I swapped the bell pepper for a jalapeno pepper, because I don't like celery or bell peppers.

Very tasty and easy to make. The beans were much more tender than any of the times I've tried to cook them on the stove top. I added some salt and pepper after the cooking was done, as instructed, but didn't need to add nearly as much as I thought I would. I guess a lot of the saltiness from the smoked sausage worked its way into the beans.

Delicious!  The first time I followed exactly and it was great, however the leftovers get a little thick from all the bean starch.   Now I make it and sub beef broth for the water and its even better.  After we eat it the first time around, I mix in an extra cup of broth before stowing the leftovers and its the perfect thickness.

The directions were spot on, taste great! The only thing I would change the next time I make it is that I probably would add the sausage a hour before it’s done to prevent the sausage from being too soft. Also I did add franks red hot sauce and used chicken broth instead of water.

Great base recipe! I used 2 lbs of beans and soaked them overnight. I added some Tony C's seasoning (about 2 tbsp), 2 chopped jalapeños, 1 diced ham steak and used chicken stock instead of water. They came out perfect! Served them over white rice but hubby wants cornbread next time. Definitely a keeper though! So easy and delicious!!

This was absolutely amazing! I doubled the recipe for the sole purpose of having leftovers. However I only added 1.5 times the water because it wouldn't fit into the slow-cooker. Still turned out beautifully and I have leftovers. The most important part is the nutrition of this meal. I may choose a ham hock next time to decrease the amount of fat (possibly), but this is still a very healthy meal!! Would be perfect with a touch of Tabasco sauce and side of corn bread. Enjoy.

I used 1/2 chic broth 1/2 water. I sautéd the bell pepper and onion in my crockpot (I have a cuisinart that has a sauté setting) I then added the broth along with bay leaf, garlic powder,onion powder,Cajun seasoning, thyme, red pepper flakes,sage and let that sauté/simmer along with a piece of smoked turkey wing for about 15 minutes(my wings were left over from Thanksgiving) I then added the remaining water and let simmer for 10 minutes. Then added the beans I soaked using the quick soak method ( place beans on stove in a pot with 6 cups of water. Bring to a rapid boil for two minutes. Cover for an hour and rinse throughly) set my crockpot on low for 8 1/2 hours. Checked on them the 7th hour and added my smoked sausage and a touch of salt. Continued cooking for the remaining 1 1/2.Perfect! First time cooking beans in a crockpot. This will be my new go to method! Fantastic!!!!!

Great recipe.  I omitted the celery and used chicken stock.  I sauteed the onion, green pepper, garlic and spices (added complete seasoning and tony's)in olive oil.  I had a ham bone with lots of meat still on it that I used instead of sausage and the kids tore it up.  Whenever I use my crock pot for meals I prepare the pot the night before, refrigerate and then start the cooking in the morning.  I cooked on low all day.  Served with white rice and cornbread.  I bet it will be even better tomorrow. I will def make this again:-)  The kids asked for it again today for lunch and it was even better.

I soaked the beans overnight then started the slow cooker at 4am.  At 11:30 the beans are still firm.  There really isn't much seasoning and the water is clear-ish and not of a red tint.  I used 3.5 cups chicken broth and 2.5 water.  I omitted the celery.  Very bland, but seems healthy.

Definitely need to soak the beans first, and at least overnight - I soaked them @ 6 hours and it wasn't long enough. I used Kielbasa sausage and it was only okay - will experiment with different meats next time. Added canned tomatoes, used cayenne and paprika to spice.

This recipe is always the base recipe I work from, and the easiest way to make great, authentic tasting Red Beans and Rice. Depending who is dining with us, I add or subtract certain ancillary ingredients like the celery, onions or bell pepper. But I do suggest adding Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning to taste as an ingredient every time.

I did it without the sausages, and it makes a great vegetarian protein rich dish

Love this recipe as is, or to is a my base and add other stuff, like veggies. I’ve made it with ground turkey, it was so amazing!

The beans were not tender, and the dish could have been more flavorful. I liked it, to some degree, but the family did not.

I followed this recipe from the beginning to the end all for my beans to be hard, bland and extremely soupy. I suggest soaking these overnight.

I followed this recipe and my wife and I loved it. Only one thing I am going to change. I am going to wait and add the sausage in like the final 2 hours or so. If you add the sausage in the beginning it cooks all the flavor out of the sausage.

Loved this!  I subbed/adjusted the following and it was the perfect blend of flavor- used chicken broth instead of water, used 2 stalks of celery (instead of 1), used 2 packages of polska kielbasa, added 1 can Rotel tomatoes. Served with white rice and cornbread.  Will definitely be making again.  kids and my husband really enjoyed.

I made several additions to this recipe, so I won't comment on the flavor, but the techniques are spot on.  I did soak the beans overnight, but I doubt that made a huge difference.  8 hours in the slow cooker would probably have the same effect by itself.

Unbelievable how easy this is to make...throw everything in the crock pot and wait! We will make again but will use a better smoked sausage. Kid approved!

We loved it. Will totally cook again. I used chicken stock instead of plain water.

I soak the beans overnight.  I use low sodium chicken stock instead of water and I only use 4 cups.  I also add a few healthy splashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce® and Worcestershire sauce. Oh and a ham hock or smoked jowls would also send the flavors up a notch.

This was delicious!  My husband recently went vegetarian (3 months ago) so I did not add the sausage.  It was delicious!!!!!!  I will be making again.  Thanks for the recipe.  I put it on at 10:00 and ran a lot of errands throughout the day.  Came back around 7 and turned it off.

I added a can of rotel tomatoes, but thought it was still a little bland.
