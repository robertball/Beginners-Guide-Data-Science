Very good and easy to make.  I didnt have dried apriocts so i simmered fresh ones in water and suagar until they were like a jam almost, and it turned out great!!  takes a while the make, but definatly worth the time!

Strangely addictive. I used a bunch of fresh apricots and two small peaches for this, obviously not boiling but just chopping them up. Kept everything the same except because I had so much fruit I added more flour and baking powder to the egg/apricot part and they came out great. Don't forget to dip the top, sides, and bottoms of all bars in powdered sugar, adds a nice sweetness.

This was a great recipe, I used fresh apricots instead of dried and it turned out great! My family loved it, and the icing sugar on top is a must so don't skrimp! :)

I absolutely love apricot bars--but these are just nasty.  Gooey, to put it mildly; overly sweet.  Almost too messy to cut.  I will NOT make them again; the recipe belongs in the trash.  If the ingredients weren't so expensive that is where the cookies would go also.

I followed the directions exactly. I was careful to completely drain the apricots after boiling on paper towels.  Because of what the other reviews said about them being too gooey I was kept them in the oven a little too long.  They were still delicious.  I covered them with plastic wrap, and the few I managed to save until the next day were even better.

I give these 5 stars because they were super easy to make and my mom had one and called it "unbelievable".  They were that good!  So ooey and gooey and delicious, and came out of the pan perfectly.  The only thing I don't understand is the yield.  32 bars?!  That's pretty funny.  I cut mine into 16 regular sized squares.  I told my mom I'd be making them again soon.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Too sweet, the brown sugar over powered the taste of the apricots.

I made these squares, and tripled the recipe, and they were all gone in about 15 minutes.  Everyone in my family loved them.  I would cook the apricots just a couple minutes longer than they recommend though as the texture is a nicer contrast to the other textures if you do.  I also subbed other kinds of ground nuts, Pecan is my favorite and edged all sides of each square with a dusting of icing sugar.  Enjoy

These bars are overly sugary.I cooked for over the proper time and they were still too gooey to call bars. The excess sugar kills the apricot taste too.

This is a different bar to take places and sell at bake sales.  Loved the flavor of these.  I did not roll in powdered sugar, I dusted it on the top.  Will make again.

OMG!  I have searched for this recipe since 1970!  The original was in a Good Housekeeping Recipe Box of individual books...1958, in Book of Cookies.  My kids grew up on these and they are the very best.  I just turned the oven on and on my way to paradise!

These were great!  My husband actually made them and did a great job (what a sous chef!!).  He did take them out a bit early so they were a bit gooey in the centre but they were still great.  We did leave out the walnuts since they were being served at nut-free facility and I don't think they were missed.

This has been a family favorite for decades. My mother and grandmother both made these. I make them for the holidays all friends and family love these and every year I have someone new asking for the recipe. I guarantee that any reviewer that says these are gooey, a mess etc... made a mistake somewhere in the recipe. Refridgerate any that are not eaten after serving.

I will make this again.  I had already made apricot purée from fresh apricots and I had some rhubarb.  So I used about 3/4 apricot purée (slightly sweetened) and the same amount of cooked rhubarb (slightly sweetened).  Because of the other reviews about being gooey, and because I was using purée, I added 1/2 cup oatmeal.  The bars turned out great, not too sweet and were loved by all.
