Very quick and very easy - plus it's right off back of the argo package! I always make this when I do a beef roast.  I drain the drippings in a fat separator first.  I use the broth from that (no bouillon) and to make it creamy I dissolve the cornstarch in milk instead of water (that's also on the back of the package).  My grandma always added a bit of "Gravy Master Sesoning and Browning Sauce" (a nifty little glass jar with a brown and orange package that I always remember from childhood) which gives gravy a really nice flavor and color. Definitely stir constantly with a wire whisk as directed in order to avoid those nasty lumps.....

Easy was right. I made chicken breast in the crock pot and used the left over liquid(instead of broth). Put it in the pan heated turned it on medium heat, added the corn starch and H2O. And before I knew it, GRAVY! Will use in the future for all my dinner gravy recipes. Thanks!

Pretty good flavor but I didn't like the way it looked. I just don't like that high gloss look in gravy. Guess I'm just a country girl. I think it looks better and tastes the same or better when using flour instead of corn starch. Sorry!

I cannot believe I made such delicious gravy!  I was really worried about it, but it turned out FANTASTIC!  I boiled a ham hock for a couple hours, adding more water as some evaporated, then used the water as the base for this recipe.  I added rosemary as suggested for pork.  It was served with the Rich Mashed Potatoes and my Christmas ham.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Very quick and easy.  I used bacon fat, beef base along with water and corn starch for my gravy.  The results were better than the powdered gravy any day.

Rich, easy and delicious gravy. I made apple butter pork tenderloins in the slow cooker and drained the broth and separated the fat drippings. I followed the recipe as stated and added rosemary as a finishing touch. Wonderful, must try recipe.

I've used this recipe several times now. Once I didn't even have any drippings and just used the bouillon for the flavor. It is better tasting with drippings but I just wanted to have some gravy to put over some left over rice! Aloha!

I am a gravy master thanks to Argo Corn Starch! I do add about a tablespoon of butter right before I serve this to add a rich velvety texture!

Add salt and pepper to taste. Made beef gravy and also added a bit of thyme. A very good foundation!

Turned out great. I am not a gravy fan at all, but I believe my son would drink this out of the pan if I let him.  Okay, I have caught him drinking it out of the bowl and he is a skinny little thing who barely likes any foods. It is obviously that good.

This was just what I was looking for.  My family's preference is a smoother thin gravy so I went for that consistency.  I used flour instead of corn starch (none in the pantry) and it didn't thicken nearly as fast with the measurements of corn starch but if anything, it just allowed more time to cook down the potential flour flavor and for the other seasonings I added to marinade into the gravy, giving it a possibly more enriched flavor.  Of course you could just add a bit more flour to the mixture if you don't want to give it time to thicken.  I used reserved turkey fat, I added a pinch of thyme (turkey), 2 dashes of poultry seasoning and a small dash of white pepper.  No salt needed.  My non-gravy loving guest enjoyed this gravy.  It added a bit of flavor and moisture without over powering the dish you pour it over.

Pretty typical gravy.  I used almost all the pan drippings as I was only roasting a small turkey breast/leg.  I wish I'd made it a little thicker with more cornstarch but I was in a hurry to get dinner to the table.  Completely versatile to season/thicken however you'd like.  I added a little poultry seasoning as recommended.  Served abundantly over my turkey and mashed potatoes with a side or acorn squash-OH YUM!

This is a great easy base to start with.  I used drippings from cooking a whole chicken that had added broth and garlic.  I also added thyme & sage and adjusted salt & pepper to taste.  Combining the cornstarch with cold water ensures that there are no lumps.

We ended up needing a little more corn starch to thicken it, and some experimentation with additional seasoning, but overall a great recipe for gravy!

This is exactly how I make my gravy every Thanksgiving. It turns out perfect every time! I sometimes use my own quick made stock mixed with a little chicken bouillion and strain it for the broth. For the fat drippings it is best to use a gravy separator to get the more flavorful liquid and not just the grease from the meat.

This was so easy to make and excellent, used beef bouillon and added 1 tablespoon of sour cream (serving size 4) and thyme.

Just made this for thanksgiving and it was great! I added extra poultry seasoning and salt and pepper, but you could add whatever you like. So easy to make and keep warm while you rush around getting everything out on the table. Will definitely be using this as my holiday gravy recipe from now on!

We had a fried turkey, so we didn't have any "drippings."  I used butter for the fat and added pepper and salt.  Even though the gravy was very pale, it tasted pretty good!

This was fantastic!  My first time making gravy!  Will only make this from now on!  Used all the drippings - which was about 1/2 to 3/4 of a  cup and extra corn starch - great flavor!

Very quick and very good. I looked this up one night after reheating some turkey, I needed something quick and easy and this was perfect!  The only change I made, was adding a little bit more cornstarch. My fat drippings weren't too thick! ENJOY!

I made this, exactly as written, and it came out much too thin for my taste.  Don't know what went wrong!  If I try it again I guess I will go easy on adding the liquid; don't know what else to do.

The gravy didn't turn out that great. Do I have to use the Argo Corn Starch or is other kinds of corn starch fine too? Don't know if that made a difference.

Easy is right - it was a good, basic gravy. I did, however, feel the need to add some pepper, garlic and thyme. It just needed something!

Really good recipe. I did change it up a bit by using Wondra flour instead of cornstarch. However....after rethinkinking it, I believe the cornstarch may have been a bit easier to mix and less lumpy.

I had to add about a 1/2 teaspoon more of cornstarch and it still didn't stay as thick as I like it. But I made do with it. The gravy was flavorful without adding additional salt or even pepper. 
Yes, since it was pretty easy, I would make it again.

This was quick, easy, and tasted great! I wasn't originally going to make gravy since only my husband and I will eat it (3 boys don't like it), but since I had a few minutes waiting for some carrots to finish steaming, I figured I would give it a try. The texture was wonderful - no lumps at all! The gravy was really good over our mashed potatoes and some roasted chicken. The flavor could be stronger, but that will be something to play around with next time. Oh, and I was still waiting for the carrots to finish steaming when the gravy was finished, so it is really fast to make!
