Delicious. Made a couple quick changes.  Added a bit more crushed vanilla wafers (1/4 cup at a time) as i found the truffle mixture a bit too soft. And although i used semisweet choc chips in the interior of the truffles I did dip them in milk chocolate!!

These were excellent! I took the advice of other reviewers and upped the vanilla wafers to a cup so they wouldnâ€™t be mushy. I wanted more of the raspberry flavor though, so I made indentations in each truffle and filled them with raspberry jam before dipping them in chocolate. Oh my goodness, yum! But it does takes more chocolate to make sure they all get covered when you do it that way.  I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate melting wafers rather than chocolate chips. It took about 15 ounces to coat all 36 truffles.

Although tasty I found the centers to be a bit too soft. I dipped my frozen balls in the melted chocolate and before I was even done rolling a ball the chocolate around it was all ready hardening. I set a few aside so they wouldn't be complete frozen but then I had trouble rolling them because they were too soft. Maybe  adding more wafers as suggested by another reviewer would help in the rolling process.

Love these, even though they are super rich.
