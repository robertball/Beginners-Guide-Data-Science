Another winning recipe! Thanks to previous reviewers, I cut the oil by half (next time maybe even a little bit more), added 1/4 cup chopped red onions and 1/4 cup sliced almonds.  Sweet but not too sweet and is very appropriate for this summertime weather! Presentation is beautiful and tastes even better. We all enjoyed, including my daughter, who is 5yrs old. Thanks Mona for posting this!

This salad is wonderful.  Everyone (even spinach salad haters) go GAGA over it.  The sweet, tangy dressing is heavenly when combined with the strawberries and spinach.  This salad is always a crowd favorite, and it's always requested at potlucks and dinners.  I always add a few strawberries to the dressing and let it sit in the fridge to cool for an hour or so before serving.  The dressing ends up a beautiful pink color and the strawberries really dress it up!  It's a nice way to bring back summer if you can find strawberries out of season in your grocery store, and goes well with just about any meal you could possibly think of.

I helped cook for a wedding this past summer, and the couple wanted a spinach salad with poppy seed dressing.  This was a HUGE hit, and I had people calling me the next week for the recipe (even established cooks!).  I was asked to make this salad for another wedding a couple months later.

This is absolutely wonderful, I like the strawberries, but it is equally great with canned drained mandarin oranges.

Used mixed field greens with Blue cheese, red onions and toasted sliced almonds in a pan, then added sugar and let them cool for on top. Used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 reg. oil.Balsamic vinegar also. Had to make it 2 nights in a row. My family agreed it is the best salad EVER!!! Thanks!

Great taste but definitely reduce oil by 1/2 and use olive oil instead of vegetable.  Also know that this is not a salad that keeps if you mix it with the dressing as the next day the strawberries taste terrible since they've marinated.

This was nice and simple.  We really enjoyed this salad.  The dressing is very nice and light.  It isn't overpowering.  I added 2 strawberries to the blender when I mixed the dressing.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I used less oil and will use less vinegar the next time but very good. Topped my salad with the Kraft crumbles of feta, provolone, and parmesan cheeses. Also added Dawn's Candied walnuts from this site. Thank you!!

I always take this to get togethers and barbecues, and EVERYONE asks for the recipe!  I usually only use half the oil and sugar, and I add two strawberries to the blender as well.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe. So did my hubby.  My changes: I changed/cut the vegetable oil to 1/2 cup olive oil and cut the the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I added four small strawberries to the dressing and used an immersion blender to blend the dressing.  I added 1/2 cup toasted, sliced almonds and a small red onion, thinly sliced, to the salad. I topped it with cubed feta cheese.  What can I say? It was perfect!  Even hubby liked it, and he usually will not eat fruit that is in something other than a dessert.

Really easy, really delicious. The better the white wine vinegar you choose, the better the dressing. I've made it with champagne white wine vinegar, which was great.

I also added 2 or 3 strawberries to the dressing mix, and I didnt have any poppy seeds so I used a tsp of celery seed. I have also played with toppings, almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds. YUMMY

I love this salad! I added the chopped red onion, slivered almonds and dried cranberries. I also used 1/3 cup vinegar (white wine with real white wine) to 2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil.

This was really good. I made the dressing by the recipe and changed up the salad. I added toasted almonds, red onion slivers, roasted chicken and blue cheese crumbles. I love, love, LOVE this salad. Mango and avacado sounds yummy also.
Thanks for such a versatile recipe.

Easy and delicious! As with many other reviews this amount of dressing is way too much for a serving of 4; but it will keep so make a big batch! I used olive oil and sesame seeds instead of poppy.  Added toasted slivered almonds as well. Don't add dressing untill just before serving.  Family raved, will make many times I'm sure. (The photo shows sliced almonds and something that looks like ?mango)..neither are listed as ingredients.

I was skeptical about a salad with strawberries, but i'm thrilled i gave this a try.  It does make a ton of dressing, i will half the amount next time, and it quickly seperates, so mix and pour fast.  I also added some sliced almonds to the mix.  Will def make again!  Refreshing and lovely summer/spring salad.

The dressing on this is really good, and is perfect with fruit and lettuce.  Made a meal out of it by adding chicken and almonds.

Very good! Fresh, tart, and sweet. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to be healthier. Next time, I'm going to try balsamic instead of white vinegar. We ate it tonight as a side dish with burgers. On a 95 degree night, it was a welcome addition to the meal! Oh, and don't be stupid and decide to use Splenda. It's fairly healthy the way it is, no need to risk your health with close to a pound of aspartame.

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes when I need something light, quick, simple, and inexpensive...it is always a hit! I do substitute Splenda for the sugar. I've also tried using the Toffee Glazed Almond Accents and the Honey Roasted Almond Accents in place of plain almonds, which adds a nice touch as well.

Excellent!  So fresh and tasty, not to mention it's a breeze to make.  The idea to blend a berry into the dressing was great as was the suggestion to top with candied almond slivers.  Just delicious!  Thanks.

This has been a family favorite for YEARS at our house! We make the dressing with Splenda and have in the winter used frozen blueberries!   We also usually put some chopped toasted almonds in it, pecans are good too! Hard to mess this up! :-)

Salad was wonderful.  Like other reviewers, we cut the sugar to l/2 cup  but would cut it to l/8 cup next time.  We used white balsamic vinegar and   took it to an Easter brunch.  It had rave reviews.  Definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe and so do all who've tried it.  I add coarsely chopped roasted almonds, slivers of red onion and freshly ground black pepper to the spinach and strawberries.  The dressing is wonderful.  I use only 1/4 c. vinegar, less than 1/2 c. oil and add a strawberry or two for color and flavor.  I find the dressing is even better if made the day before.  Oh, and if you have an egg slicer, use it for slicing the strawberries; it's fast and easy.  Thank you for such a wonderful, happy recipe :)

Absolutely AMAZING!!  I used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil and it was still a great dressing!  And I added feta cheese and slivered almonds to mine as well and that was a wonderful touch!

This was pretty good.  I left out the seeds and added in some thinly sliced white onion.  Also I used baby spinach.  Next time I'll use red onion and I think I'll add some crumbled cheese, like blue or feta.

I used this for a Father's day BBQ.  Got great reviews, especially on the dressing.  I cut down on the oil, but added some low fat mayonnaise, which gave it a nice creamy texture!

This surpassed my expectations!!  My skeptical husband had seconds, and our dinner guests declared it a winner.  Based on the advice of other reviewers, I only used a half cup of oil, and this was plenty - the dressing was great.  I was pleasantly surprised when the juices from the sliced strawberries blended with the dressing to make a sort of strawberry vinigrette... delightful!

Made this last night, and it was really different and fresh kind of dressing. My 20 month old daughter and husband loved it. Will make it again. Although I had to do with the ingredients I had home. Instead of the sugar, I added 4 very ripe strawberries into the blended mix, and only added 1/2 tsp of sugar (next time will do without it). I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used the juice of one lime. Also I used 1/4 tsp salt. Finally, I used 1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil. for crunch I used cashews, and for more omega 3 added a whole avocado (cut into cubes). This salad tasted fresh, healthy and delish! Thanks Mona for posting!

Great simple elegant recipe. Used ideas from below - and had a perfect salad to serve for New Years Day brunch. Used: 1 bag baby spinach, 12 large strawberries, slice, 1/8 cup white sugar, 1 pinch salt 
1/3 cup white wine vinegar, 1/2 cup olive oil - also added 1 strawberries to dressing - helped sweeten it (with only using 1/8 a cup of sugar) and made very elegant, and 1 tablespoon poppy seeds. Will make again and again. Thanks!

This is just like the salads you buy in restaurants!  Very yummy!  I left out poppy seeds as I did not have them, and added a little onion powder to the dressing--I noticed other recipes had onion and so I threw it in--turned out great.  We will definitely have this again and again!

Delicious and easy. I make this quite often now with a couple of changes though - I use half white wine vinegar and half raspberry vinegar (very yummy!) and I throw a couple of strawberries in the blender with the other dressing ingredients and I add toasted slivered almonds to the salad.

Very good recipe. After getting the salad ready I realized that I did not have white wine vinegar so I used what I did have-red wine vinegar and it was wonderful! I also sub canola oil; next time will use a little less oil. I also added some aliced almonds as some others suggested. Will definitely make again.

This salad is fantastic.  I took the advice of others and reduced the amount of dressing to about 1/3 and there was still leftover dressing.  I added two strawberry's to the dressing as advised and it was so delicious.  I also added toasted sliced almonds, feta cheese, and red onion to the salad.  This salad is so fantastic I will be serving it once a week from now on.

Very good and easy to make -- my only complaint is that I think it call for too much oil -- the oil weighs down the spinach and takes away from the flavor... Enjoy!

The dressing was way too sweet.  I threw the original out and made new dressing with 1/2 as much sugar.  It was delicious.  I also added feta and 
toasted pecans to the salad. Will have again soon as the local strawberries are unbelievably good.

Wonderful.  Used 1/2 cup oil in place of the whole cup and added 1/3 cup diced purple onion and toasted almonds.  Made the dressing (just stirred with a fork), several hours before serving and sprinkled the poppy seeds over the salad greens just before adding the dressing.  So good.  Thanks for sharing.

Really good. The dressing was sweet and a little tangy but too oily and could do with half the oil called for. At least that is how I'm fixing it next time to see if that makes it better. I had to use raspberry white wine vinegar as it's what I had. Wonderful salad. I sprinkled with some sliced toasted almonds.

Fabulous flavor and beautiful color! I did add red onion and some blueberries as per other's suggestions. One afternoon, I made a large serving for my daughter and I to share. She sat at the table, and I went to finish cooking. When I came back, she had eaten the whole salad, right out of the serving bowl! It's THAT good! Thanks for posting this. :-)

My husband and I loved this, even though I forgot to add the salt. He's picky about dressing, and said, "It's great! It's not overwhelming, not underwhelming. It's just the perfect amount of whelm!" I used half olive oil, half vegetable oil, probably 3/4 cup total, and only 1/3 cup sugar. Everything else in the recipe's amounts.

I made this for my husband's Christmas party and it was a huge hit!  I did make a few changes.  I used less than 1/2 c. olive oil instead of the vegetable oil, used a little less sugar than the recipe called for, and added about 1/4 c. toasted, sliced almonds.  I also added a couple of strawberries to the blender to make the dressing a nice pink shade. It was so pretty and the red strawberries and green spinach were a great, festive color!  Yummy!

I like this recipe and have had several successes with it.  I substitute Balsamic for the white vinegar and cute back on the sugar.  I add to the salad thinly sliced red onion and toasted nuts (I've tried pecans and almonds, both were good).  I use olive oil not vegetable.

I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I added was 3 or 4 strawberries into the blender to make the dressing a lovely pink colour.  It needed a few drops extra of white wine vinegar, and probably less poppy seeds.  And I also added lots of crumbled feta cheese, which really completed it. It was a hit!  To make for 15 people, use the measurements for 5 servings, and you'll have leftovers.

Very delicious, though I did add a little more fruits to the recipe.  Since summer is all about fun colors I added grapes, cantaloupe, blueberries and toasted almonds.

This was a very simple recipe to make and it tastes great.  It would be easy to add ingredients to the salad but it is great as is.  I used red wine vinegar since I was out of white wine vinegar and I halved the oil.  It still made plenty of dressing.

The entire family loved this salad--unfortunately I could not find poppy seeds anywhere (I think I'll try the bagel place next time) so we had to do without those, but we managed :)The strawberries, and dressing were a hit together! definetely a keeper!

This is my favorite salad!!!  I used only 1/2 the dressing that the recipe makes and added slivered almonds and feta cheese for more "punch".  It tastes great!

I took the advise of other reviewers and cut the 1/2 cup sugar to about 1/3 cup, and it was plenty sweet.  I also would recommend reducing the poppy seeds to just 2 teaspoons.  The full tablespoon of poppy made the dressing look very dark and unappetizing.  I used canola oil.  Very fresh and tasty salad.  I hate cooked spinach, but fresh spinach is wonderful in a salad like this.  Rave reviews from the ladies at my church.  Good recipe!

This is a great salad, especially since it's strawberry season!  SO EASY and delicious!  Served at babies' birthday party, and everyone loved it!  Toss the salad with the dressing right before serving, otherwise your spinach will wilt badly!

I made this for our Memorial Day picnic.  I chose this recipe because of all the postive feedback and I'm so happy I did. I thought it was a fun and different salad.  Will certainly make again.  OH, I did cut down on the oil too, after reading the feedbacks I decided to use 1/2 a cup - I measured out a whole cup and I thought it looked like too much oil, so a scaled back.

This was superior! My grandkids ate spinach this way. I did however cut the oil in half I felt we did not need a cup. Refreshing! Thanks to Mona for sharing. Definitely will do this one over many times.

Excellent salad.  I add some of the strawberries to the dressing and blend them in.  In addition...add carmalized pecans to the salad makes a great texture contrast.

Cut the oil down to 1/2 Cup!

The dressing is fantastic, although I suggest adding toasted pecans and thin sliced red onion to the salad.

I wanted to give this salad 3 stars, because there is something "off" that I cannot figure out yet, however the fact that it sort of got to me to start liking spinach makes it 4 star worthy.  I did cut the oil by half, and the second time I tried it with toasted almonds and feta (which was really good).  However, I do need to experiment with the dressing a little more.  Definitely a good recipe worth trying, especially for anyone who does not like spinach!!!!

Just finished eating this salad and both my husband and I LOVED it.  I thought the dressing was awesome the way it was.  I added slivered almonds because I had them in my cupboard and also added blue cheese.  It was incredible and I can't wait to make it again.

Oh my gosh---this is one of my favorite spring salad recipes now! I do sub extra light olive oil for the vegetable oil, and add sliced almonds and some shredded parmesan cheese to the salad. I often forget the poppy seeds, but find that it is just as good without---no seeds in the teeth! Finally, I add a strawberry to the blender when making the dressing---adds a hint of berry flavor for when I use the leftover dressing on other salads. The dressing is way more than is needed, but I save it in a cruet in the fridge and enjoy it on other salads. Thanks for such a perfect recipe!

For the amount of spinach and strawberries, the dressing should be cut to 1/4!  The taste and the color combination are delightful!

I usually do not like fruit in my salad, nor would I normally eat spinach as a salad.  THIS IS SO GOOD my husband & I can't get enough of it!  We had this at my sister's over the weekend & I made for dinner last night and had again for lunch today.  It is really really good!  I left out the paprika and added chopped walnuts...This one's a keeper!  So different and so good!

Adjusted the recipe by cutting the sugar in half and adding two strawberries to the dressing before blending. A good recipe that everyone seems to like, and that is easy to put together. Thanks!

This was an amazing salad! For the dressing, I used the given amount of white wine vinegar and then used that amount for the vegetable oil instead of the one in the recipe. I think that was a good balance, so thanks to the reviewers! I added red onions, almond slices, and mandarin oranges instead of strawberries. Delicious. I'm about to remake it with feta cheese. I'm bummed that I don't have any onions in the house cuz they added a great flavor. Definitely try it!

Delicious! Keep the dressing on the side if you plan to have leftovers (unless you like it soggy). This recipe led to my kids liking spinach!

I loved this!The dressing is best when you use it immediately, as it will seperate.Because the dressing is so oily, I didn't use that much at all and saved the rest in a jar.

This is such a refreshing, delicious and simple salad. I leave out the poppy seeds (just because I don't like them), and I'm always asked for the recipe.

This was a huge hit with my family I add 2 strawberries to the dressing and I only used half the sugar and oil.  The strawberries in the dressing really make it look elegant.

This is a great recipe! Very easy and tasty. As other raters have said it does turn out very sweet when you use the full amount of sugar...I happen to like it that way, but others might want to reduce. I added crumbled feta and slivered almonds for a delicious summer salad.

This was good, my mother in law was very excited to see that I was serving a salad with poppy seed dressing.  I especially liked that the dressing was not too vinegary.

I've made a salad similar to this for years. It's always a favorite and it's very easy. I use bagged spinach or salad greens, mandarin oranges, sliced mushrooms, sliced strawberries, and bottled poppy seed dressing. Layer the mushrooms, strawberries, and oranges on top of the greens for a nice presentation, and toss with dressing right before serving.

Very good, very easy.  Does make a lot of dressing.  I only had red wine vinegar and I thought it tasted fine. I also halved my sugar and added two strawberries to the blended dressing.

I made this for a family get-together last weekend and it was a big hit.  I changed a few things - halved the sugar and added 2 strawberries to the dressing.  I also added sugared pecans and brie, but I think I'll use blue cheese.  Nice spring first course!

What a great salad.  Tastes more like a dessert, like strawberry shortcake infact.  Like other reviews suggested, I used 1/4 cup sugar (subsituted 1/4 cup Splenda) and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup Olive Oil instead of 1 cup. Blended two strawberries in the dressing also, made a pretty pink color. Sprinkled the salad with Feta Cheese and toasted almonds.  Very pretty. Served the dressing on the side. Did not have any Poppy seeds but they are on my shopping list.  Thanks Mona!!

With fresh strawberries appearing in the market, I was anxious to try this salad. I left out poppy seeds, cut back on the sugar and blended 2T of strawberry jam into the dressing. I sprinkled toasted slivered almonds and a bit of crumbled bleu cheese on top before serving. Heavenly salad. YUM! Thanks Mona.

Thanks for this delightful summer salad!  I used Balsamic vinegar instead and it complimented all the ingredients.  In addition, I added salted cashews for a little flair.  Wonderful recipe-thank you!!

OH MY GOSH!!!  This salad was delicious!!  I could have eaten all of it and I doubled the recipe!  My 2 1/2 year old daughter even ate some.  Imagine that,  a 2 year old eating spinach!  I will make this salad again and again.  I used 1 cup veggie oil but I doubled the recipe.

This is delicious! Make sure you pour the dressing right before you serve. It gets soggy if you don't. I put the dressing over spring salad and it tasted great! Cut the oil in half.

I made this and it was great.  Very simple to make and goes with just about any type of food.  I also tried it with apricots once, and once with peaches (replacing the strawberries) and it tasted just as (if not more) delicious.

I only gave it four stars because like others I don't care for the home made dressing. I prefer to use Kraft Poppy Seed dressing. I have been eating this salad and dressing for years It is one of my favorite salads especially in the summer time.

Loved how this turned out. Simple, quick, quite versatile. Throw thinly sliced pear in if you have some laying around, or grapefruit, etc. I used raspberry vinegar and olive oil.

I love this recipe... my favorite Spring salad. I made it for a party yesterday and everyone went crazy for it. I use Grapeseed oil, and suger in the raw. I would also recommend reducing oil a bit.

I used 2/3 cups of olive oil and substituted balsamic vinegar in the dressing.  Great!

Good recipe.  I use organic spring mix instead of spinach.  I also use a combination of olive oil and grapeseed oil for the dressing.  I normally make the dressing first and let the strawberries marinate in it in the fridge before I toss it all together.

Oh my...this is simply fabulous!  I've been making several recipes from this site for quite a few years, but this is the first I've reviewed.  As others suggested, I added almonds and red onion.  It even got a "pretty good" from my 11-year-old that really doesn't care for any type of salad.  Good thing I saved a small amount of spinach because I might have to make myself a salad for lunch tomorrow!

Waaaaaaaay too much oil in this dressing.  Otherwise an okay recipe.  Strawberries and spinach always go good together.  Cut the oil back to about 2 or 3 TBLS or at the very most 1/4 cup.  You will find you have plenty of dressing.

This is a very delicious salad--and so pretty on the table! I've served it more than once. I cut the salt in half and use 1/3 less oil. It still tastes great but is a bit healthier.

The dressing is a tad too sweet for me, so this is why it only gets 4 stars. I did not use the poppy seeds because I did not have them on hand...next time, I will probably cut down on the sugar just a bit. My family loved this though -- would also be great with mandarin oranges.

Outstanding recipe!  

I have never been much of a salad person, but I am now! :-)  The dressing is simple and yet unsurpassed.  I love to add some red onions and some cut up chicken on top for a complete meal.  Yum!

I decided to make this, but procrastinated until my ingrediants were close to going bad. I almost threw in the towel but decided to go ahead and whip it up.  I'm so glad I did. Even though it is highly rated on this site, I was really surprised at how good it was.  So simple, yet so yummy!

This is BY FAR THE BEST SALAD I HAVE EVER HAD!!  I made some changes based on others' suggestions:  cut the oil by 1/2, and add 2 strawbs to the blander.  Add 1-2 chopped red onions, 1/4 cup sliced almonds and handful of feta cheese to the salad. Y U M !!!  Thanks, Mona, for a *fantastic* recipe!  :)

This salad is amazing! Very summery. He was impressed. I added sliced mangos as well. I only gave 4 star due to the dressing was waaaay to sweet. I even used less than recipe called for. The salad was sweet enough. Next time, I'll just go balsamic. Will absolutely make again.

I made this last night as one of two salads for a pool party BBQ. It was a HUGE hit. 

One mistake I made - I took some of the spinach out of the bowl as it looked too full.  Once dressed the spinach wilts.  Wish I'd brought the spinach bag with me! Later, after we'd finished eating, I caught the people cleaning up picking the last bits of the salad out of the bowl!  

In terms of the dressing, I added more vinegar - I would recommend following the recipe then taste it and adjust according to your preference.

Yummy, yummy yummy!  I loved this salad.  Given the ingredients, I wasn't quite sure how it would taste but it was great.  I would suggest putting the dressing on the side so it doesn't get mushy when folks want seconds.   A friend made a variation of this and put sliced almond all over the top as well as avocado.  She also used a store bought blush wine viniarette and it was delicious!

This was very easy to make and loved by everyone who tried it. The dressing can be reduced by about 1/3. I added almonds which gave it a nice bit of crunch.

The dressing was excellent!!  I only had red wine vinegar and it substituted beautifully.  For my trial run, I just had baby spinach with radiccio and the strawberries and my husband thought it was stellar!  Next time, I'll add nuts and cheese.

This was wonderful.  As suggested, I used only 1/3 cup of sugar, added a couple of strawberries to the dressing and used red wine vinegar instead of white.  Great summer dish!  Thanks.

Great salad.  Easy to prepare and pleasing to the eye. I also added purple onion rings, adds to the texture and the taste is very harmonious with the other ingredients.  I also took others advise to use half the oil...it was not missed.  Thank you Mona.

This gets the FULL FIVE STARS!!! in every category!!  I did add crumbled blue cheese and red onion rings, and used half olive and half vege oil (instead of just vege oil).  The dressing is light and refreshing.  Took it to a dinner party and many said they could have just eaten the salad and been very happy and satisfied!  Please try it - it's delicious!  Can't wait until the Maine strawberries are out-will have this recipe ready!

Great base and very easy -- giving it 4 stars because it is greatly enhanced by additons.  I added thin slices of red onion, sliced almonds and feta cheese as suggested by other reviewers.  Also cut the oil in half as suggested -- combined olive oil and canola.  The sweetness of the strawberry and dressing is really nice.

This was my first strawberry spinach salad and it was very good. I took advice from another viewer to add purple onions, feta cheese, and strawberries were added to the blender to make the dressing. Definitely, will make it again :)

Very tasty! I gave this a 4 star only because I hadn't read the previous reviews and used 1/2 olive oil & 1/2 vegetable oil. I did agree that it was a bit too much oil so next time, I'll only use 1/2 the oil called for & just use olive. I also used 1/2 sugar & 1/2 Splenda. Not worried about the Aspartame as Splenda doesn't contain any! With 1/2 the oil next time, it'll be a 5 star recipe!

I made this salad last night. It was quite tasty but I did feel it was missing just a little something though.  I think if you added glazed walnuts and/or a light seasoned feta or gorgonzola cheese it would taste phenomenal!!  I will make it again for sure andadd nuts/cheese.

This salad was the best salad I ever had. I kept the dressing seperate so my family could add as much or as little as they wanted and I also added 2 strawberries to it.I put 2 extra ingredients in the salad (Blue cheese and toasted almonds) It turned out fantastic. The dressing was my favorite part.

This Salad is very good.  I did make a few changes as I cannot eat Spinach and am on a low carb diet.  I changed the spinach to Romaine lettuce and added Splenda instead of sugar...not even a 1/4 cup was more than enough,.  I will cut it down again the next time to see.  Everyone loved it!

I LOVED the dressing!!!!  I used the tip from another cook and added a couple of strawberries to the vinagrette...it was so good.  My husband of course thinks he is allergic to anything healthy and wasn't impressed.  Would be good to make for a shower, or an all female get-together.

Very good!  Was a hit at our dinner party - almost everyone had seconds!  Next time I would use a bag of baby spinach to save time.  I also added 3 strawberries to the blender for the dressing and that was definitely the finishing touch.  I would half the dressing next time too, I think - I had lots left over.

Excellent recipe! I used the balsamic instead of the rice wine and blended the dressing. Instead of using a 1/2 cup of sugar, I used 1/8 cup of liquid Sugar Twin. It doesn't have the funky aftertaste that some sweetners have.

A "fancier" (but more expensive!) version: add  pecans toasted with a little butter + salt in sauce pan (blot off well) and chunks of brie cheese - here red wine vinegar + t. dry mustard are standard but opt for own preference and enjoy.

My family isn't wild about spinach, so I used a Romain blend and more strawberries.  My husband was reluctant to try it and after he tried it he wanted more!  Next, time I will use less oil.

What an awesome salad for spring and summer! My very picky husband liked it so much, he hijacked the entire salad bowl and threatened anyone who came close with his fork! Yikes!

This has become a family favorite!  I am always asked for the recipe - and it's so easy! I substitute the spinach with a bag of baby spinach (easier to prepare and eat).  I've also found that rasperry vinegar gives the dressing a sweeter taste.  It's interesting, people usually approach the salad with caution (spinach and strawberries!) and then fall in love with it!  No matter how much I make, there's never any left at the end of the day.

OMG! This was the BEST salad i think I've ever had!  The only downfall was the fat content b/c of the oil..

THIS WAS DISGUSTING! I made it exactly according to the recipe. I thought I'd gag when I tried it. I wasted strawberries and Spinach on it. Gah.

I thought it would be delicious, I was wrong. I had bought enough to make a double batch so I mixed the remaining spinach and strawberries and used a raspberry vinagrette on it... much better. Gah...

Fantastic recipe!! I would use less oil next time (add oil until it's to your taste).  I ran out of strawberries but tossed in mandarin oranges and it was really good!!

This recipe is Fantastic!  Definitely will be making this again!  It's wonderful with a glass of white wine!  It is absolute divine!  The only couple changes i made to this recipe is halved the vegetable oil to 140 mls and added a bit less sugar than stated in the recipe. My husband normally doesn't like strawberries and after trying this dish he was pleasantly surprised and now this is the only way he will eat strawberries!

Thanks much!

Loved the taste, but modified according to other reviewer's comments.  Used only 1/4 cup sugar and would probably cut down more next time.  Used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup olive oil.  I didn't have any poppy seeds, but added some sliced red onion, candied walnuts and feta cheese.  Also added 3-4 strawberries to the dressing since I didn't want any left over!  However, the dressing was enough for 2 salads! Loved this salad.

I  used less than half the oil called for. Still too much.   Followed the rest of the recipe perfectly   The poppyseeds give a nice little  crunch.  This would be an easy recipe to add other things to.   Better than fair, not fantastic

This is a very good & delicious salad, but I used about 3/4 cup olive oil & 1/4 cup vegetable oil, but put dressing on side & let my house put their own on there serving. Maybe, this is too much oil, sugar & poppyseeds (1/2 tbs. used) for me, will probably try these in half amounts next time for a 9oz. bag of spinach. My 13 y.o. child ate the salad with dressing but said dressing wasn't tasty enough or at all and most usually enjoys anything with sugar. Someone suggested blending few strawberries in dressing, maybe I'll try that next time bc was maybe missing something but was tasty & delicious anyways, with me & rest of household. 1 person added croutons & raisins to their's and said was good to vg. I would make this again with probably above exceptions.

I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings. When making the dressing, I used half the oil and sugar and just a sprinkle of salt. Delicious dressing for my husband and me doing that.

made just like instructed in the recipe, might cut down on the oil next time it made a little too much dressing for an 8oz bag of spinach. Big hit at family dinners and easy way to get kids to each spinach. Very easy, very yummy.

I've made this salad for a few years now and it's wonderful.  I prefer to eat it without a dressing but that is my personal choice; however I do feel you need to cut the dressing recipe in half as it is too much for the size of the salad.  I always add a thinly sliced apple and sliced almonds.  Sometimes I'll add pecans instead of almonds.  It's always a hit!

The dressing was too oily and a bit bland for me.  I added lemon zest to give it some more flavor and that helped.  If I do it again, I would cut the oil in half.

This was fantastic.  I will definitely be making again.  I added sliced toasted almonds and gouda which worked great. Make sure you don't put too much dressing on the salad, a little goes a long way.  I also added a strawberry to the dressing as suggested.  I did find the dressing just a tad too sweet (maybe b/c of the strawberry?) and will next time add a bit less sugar.  Overall, a great dish.

Took to a dinner party.  All the wives asked for the recipe.  This is a great recipe.  I only used a small amount of the dressing.  Next time I'll cut it in half.  I had a lot left in the blender.  Great salad, very easy.

Although all the ingredients go very well together, the dressing definently needs to be scaled down. I added in hazelnuts, blue cheese crumbles and tried to scale back the dressing as recommended by other reviews.It was still too "sloppy". The dressing can really make or break a salad.

Alright, this salad rates big time with only 2 ingredients and a wonderfully easy poppy seed dressing.  Served it to guests with Allrecipe's Herbed Pork and Apples to make a nice low-carb meal. A hit!

Love this salad! As strawberries aren't in season right now, I used manadrin orange segments instead. I would definately use less oil next time (I used 3/4 c. but I think I would use 1/2 c.). I think it makes too much dressing actually, so next time I won't just dump it on but put a little in, mix it, repeat. Might add some toasted almond slivers next time as well. Excellent recipe, made it for the in-laws who loved it and am planning to make it for lunch for tomorrow as well as for a potluck in a few weeks!

I used a little over a 1/2 cup of oil and I also added some onions (yum) and I also took the advise of other reviews and added my two biggest strawberries to the dressing...made a pretty color and strawberry flavor...you CANT go wrong with this one!!! A keeper FOR SURE! Thanks!

plus another 5 stars. I dont usually like spinach but this is the only salad I like with spinach. The sweet dressing and strawberries make the salad. I am always making for home or for partys and everyone loves it. I have passed out more of this recipe than any other recipe I have made. This is great for an easter brunch, any brunch, any meal, or just by itself. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This is a great warm weather salad.  I added kiwi along with the strawberries and they were a really nice addition.  I have also made the salad and put a raspberry vinaigrette dressing on it.  It was great!

This salad is a nice change from the everyday green salad.  I used sunflower seeds instead of poppy seeds.  I also had lots of left over dressing.  I may cut the dressing in half next time.

Everyone had the same reaction when I tried to explain the salad I was making for Easter dinner. Then they tried it. WOW!!!! The combination of flavors is GREAT!!! It was so light and refreshing and EASY!!!!! I can see that this will be a staple of summer meals. Thanks for sharing a great recipe with us, Mona.
