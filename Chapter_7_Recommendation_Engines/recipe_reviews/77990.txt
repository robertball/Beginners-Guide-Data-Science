I couldn't be bothered to make them into crescents.  I made them into rounds.  I didn't want too much sugar on it so I just rubbed some on the top rather than rolled them.  But I LOVE this recipe.  I have been trying to find it for quite a while now.  I grew up in Toronto and there was a little Jewish bakery by me that made just these sorts of cookies.  They closed down and I missed tasting these.  Thanks for the recipe!

I think there's too much fat in the recipe, dough is too soft & the cookie spread too much while baking, at 15 mins of baking, cookies still very soft, I removed them from the oven after 20 mins, everything turned into crumbs when you try to lift the cookies onto rack to cool. I dumped everything into the bin, will not try it again but nice smell though !

I thought this was a good recipe, I used pecans instead of walnuts.  The smell is wonderful. I also like it with a little nutmeg mixed with the cinnamon.

We discovered we were out of any and all extracts; Substituted 2 TBSP rum. Yum!
The warm cookies fell apart when I tried to roll them in cin/sug mixture. Sprinkling mixture over cookies on bake sheet then removing when cool worked better

My whole herd LOVES these! So tasty and easy to make. The “chef” who tossed them in the garbage and gave them one star has no clue on what they missed out on. Thank you for sharing!
