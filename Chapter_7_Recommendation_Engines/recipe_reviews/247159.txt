I made this into a cold bowl I could take into work for lunch all week.  I substituted Soba noodles for the spaghetti, imitation crab for the chicken, and cooked the onion soup mix in about 3/4 cup water.  It was delicious.

I didn’t have the onion soup mix so I sautéed an onion cut in half rings in butter then used beef bullion in the four cups of water. It turned out GREAT. Just might be a new staple

I didn't have high hopes for this one, but was very surprised! Hubby and I both enjoyed it!
