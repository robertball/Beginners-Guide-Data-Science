This is a very pretty soup.  Easy to make.  I would start by boiling the beans and wait till the beans are almost cooked untill cooking the sausages.  Also, it does not really say what to do with the saffron once it is soaking.  I assumed just add it to the pot.  As a personal preference I lowered the amount of the garlic.  I used italian sausage and added some black and cayenne peppers to add the spice of the andouille.  I will definitely make again and next time use the adouille.  Really enjoyed it.

I ended up changing the recipe at little due to what I had on hand.  I substituted green bell pepper for the red, turkey sausage for the andouille, and I browned the sausage in cajun seasoning instead of adding sweet paprika.  I'm sure the recipe is just as delicious as originally intended, but this is what was in the kitchen.  My husband and I thought this soup was awesome.  I will definitely cook it again.

Mine turned out more like a stew, but it was really good!  I used navy beans instead of Northern beans, but they worked great.

I just made this soup and it is definaley a keeper. I did make a few changes however. I used navy beans, since I don't care for northern beans. And I've never heard of saffron so I left that out. And I used italian sausage and added red pepper flakes to spice it up and a few chicken bouillion cubes. I tossed everything in the crock pot except the sausage and kale. When everything was almost done, I added my cooked meat and sauted kale and cooked another hour to blend in. This is absolutely yummy!

This was good, but I didn't want to spend 2.5 hours making this so I used fully cooked chicken jalapeno sausage and canned cannelini beans, and changed the prep to make this just under an hour from start to finish.  I sauteed the onions and the chopped sausage until onion was tender. Added the garlic, paprika, bell pepper, and kale and cooked a few minutes.  Added 4 cups homemade chicken broth, saffron, and rinsed beans.  Simmered for 10 minutes.

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times.  Even my kids eat it.  The sausage is very important to this soup -- make sure it is andouille sausage.  It adds much of the flavor.  Also, I used canned beans and started the recipe at step 3.  It makes this soup far less time consuming.

This has good meaning behind it. Very good tasting ingredients here. However there is not NEARLY enough liquid to make this a "soup" It is more like a dense stew. I had to increase the chicken broth by 2 cups and then add another cup of water near the end to stop the sodium from creeping up. I love Kale in this and I added 1 link chorizo along with 2 andouille sausages - came out great!

Spanish Style White Bean & Sausage Soup Haiku: "Fail soup, I am sad. Directions flawed, but good taste. (But on the next day.)" I was mortified to serve this to company, only to find that the beans were still hard as pebbles. I followed the recipe, only simmering my beans for more like 3 hrs., and simmered the entire soup for an additional 2 hrs. I couldn't quite get the 1st step of, what? Boiling the andouille, only to brown it later? Also, it doesn't clarify as to when to return the saffron/broth to the pot, so I just did that while it was simmering. I was overjoyed at the thought of this recipe, as I leap for anything that calls for either saffron (treasured spice that I so rarely use) or andouille (so tasty!), and loved the idea of using kale in a soup. And speaking of calling it "soup" - no way, this definitely needed additional liquid, as others have mentioned in their reviews. Sooo, we boiled and re-simmered the soup last night, and made sandwiches, and I've just now sat down to a "real" bowl of the soup, and yes, it tastes fantastic - very unusual, spicy, and earthy. I hope to make it again, but will just use canned beans, and maybe dump everything, except the kale, in the crockpot to decrease the troublesome steps.

Made this today and it's great.  Another great recipe for those cold winter months.  I cut down the cooking time by sauteeing the onion and bellpepper in the pot first, then adding the garlic.  Then added 3 cans of beans (undrained), 1.5 cans water, 3 chicken bouillon cubes, seasonings, and the sausage.  Brought to a boil, then simmer for about 20 mins.  Added the kale for 10 more minutes.  Very easy.  I don't see the point of steps 1 and 2.  They seem very time-consuming for little result.  Just my opinion.

I made this last winter for a family Spanished themed dinner. It was WONDERFUL! I have made it a couple time since and it is clearly a favorite of mine.  I have modified the cooking a bit. First, I boiled the beans according to the instructions on the pkg. I believe you put the beans in water, bring to boil, remove from heat and let it sit an hour. This reduces cooking time enormously. Second, I don't cook the sausage separately. The only Andouille sausage I have found was precooked so I sliced it up and added it to the soup. Third, since the soup has to simmer it may lose liquid, I add water or broth in order to compensate and then it ends up as soup, as it should. Fourth, I add the sausage to the beans when simmering, it gives it more flavor and the beans need longer than 10.  I used ALL the ingrediants as the recipe calls. I used kale for the first time and it was wonderful. Saffron is expensive but this soup requires it to be done correctly. Mmmm I think I need to make it again!

I cut back on the chicken stock as I wanted this to be more stew-like. The only other changes I made were to use green bell pepper, and I browned the sliced Andouille in olive oil before adding the other ingredients. I've never cooked with kale before but I'm definitely a fan - I loved that it had so much flavor and didn't turn to mush like, say, spinach. Thanks!

Very complex delicious soup and I didn't even use the saffron-thought hubby would not be happy.  After reading reviews I only cooked up about 4 oz. of beans in 2 c chicken broth and 2 cups water.  Added those and cooking liquid to simmering soup when they were tender.  I added celery and carrot for even more veggies, and used baby spinach instead of kale as it was on sale really cheap.  I did add a pinch of red pepper flakes as I wasn't sure how spicy our sausage was.  The consistancy was very brothy which is the way hubs likes his soup.  Another new soup for our winter rotation -Thank you Pippymoe!

We liked this soup a lot!  I cooked the beans first since I don't always have luck cooking beans and just browned the andouille, otherwise followed the recipe.  The saffron adds a nice flavour.

This was delicious. I used Spanish chorizo instead of the sausage, which is much better in my opinion :) Be careful of the fiber content on this one.....

Used hot Italian turkey sausage out of the casing, and also used fat free/low sodium chicken broth. Added a diced zucchini as well...great way to use up 1/2 bag of chopped and washed kale that I had to use. Also added some dried basil and oregano. Thanks!

Spicy and packs a little heat! Made three "slight" changes.  Used canned Great Northern beans, 1/2 tsp paprika and canned spinach instead of kale.  I cook according to what I have on hand and what I got on sale at the grocery store.  Looked up recipe for Andouille sausage, which I got at the grocers for 1.99 lb, and this recipe fit what was essentially in my cupboard and did not disappoint! Try it, you'll love it.

This was my first time cooking with kale.  I couldn't pass it up at our local farmers market it looked so lovely.  I had andouille in the freezer and had no idea what to do with it, or the kale for that matter, until I came across this recipe.  So happy that I did.  I didn't have any saffron so I left that out and I used canned beans because I didn't have any dry on hand nor did I have the time to soak them properly.  I did add a bit more seasoning, mostly poultry seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, and powdered rosemary.  I will make this again next time I buy kale.

Very good winter soup with lots of protein. Beans will NOT cook in the amount suggested. Add a few more hours of simmering. Works well in a crock pot but start early. Delicious.

The ingredients were great, but after reading the other reviews, I changed the directions a great deal:

I cooked the beans by themselves the day before and chilled them down until needed (Boiling water poured on dry beans, 4 hour soak, 1 hour boil).

I sliced and browned the sausage without boiling it first.  This went into the simmering chicken stock with bay leaf and saffron.

Using the remaining olive oil from the sausage, I sauteed the onions and bell pepper.  I then added the garlic and paprika.  This also went into the soup.

At this point, I added the beans and kale.  I brought the soup to a boil and then covered, reduced to a simmer, and let simmer for 10 minutes.

This soup was so hearty and filling. It was good, but had enough of a strange taste that I might not make it often. Maybe it was the saffron, which I never tasted before. Thanks for the recipe!

This is good.  I had to omit the garlic because my husband is allergic to garlic.  I substituted turmeric for the saffron.

The beans were hard as rocks. They need to soak overnight and then cook for 2 hours or simmer for six hours. (without salt which retards the cooking process)

So good!  I even forgot the saffron which I was very intrigued by!!  Darnit!  Used spinach instead  of kale cause it's what I had.  Yummy stuff :)

The has quickly become a favorite in my house!  Goes together quickly, and I love sneaking the extra kale into the family diet without arguing.  I use two cans of black beans, and have done both andouille sausage and regular kielbasa.  Served with salad and some sourdough, it's a sure hit on a cold night!

Fast and easy . Delicious. I substituted tumeric for the saffron, otherwise did not change it and it was perfect.
