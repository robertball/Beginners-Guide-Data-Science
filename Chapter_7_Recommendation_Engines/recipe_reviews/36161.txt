Mmmmm...so good. I actually used ground turkey, since I wanted a turkey burger but had never been able to make one that actually tasted good. These really hit the spot. I left the rasins whole and was generous with the spices--the contrast between sweet and savory is magical. I served them with a yogurt sauce with cucumber and parsley.

Really enjoyed the flavor, different from what I am used to .... very cinnamon-y. 
I don't have a grill so I used a George Forman Grill in my kitchen (I have used it before for burgers) They turned out really well - though I am not sure what the purpose of the skewers was.. could have just made normal burger patties.
Would make it again.

It was alright.  The flavor was nice and I enjoyed the sweetness.  I might make it again someday.  I didn't see the point of the kabob sticks so I cooked them as hamburger patties. I will probably not be making this again.

This was really good.  A nice change from the usual uses of ground beef.  I was a little wary of the raisins but that turned out to be the best part!  I served it with tzatziki sauce and greek salad and it complemented the meal perfectly!

This was lunch today...and, I must say it was great.  I served it in pita bread with a green salad in the bread too.  A "great" from all involved.  Thank you Marlies....we really enjoyed!

This was really tasty.  My sister made the meat into patties, and we ate them as burgers on the grill.  Even the raisin-phobic 3 year old ate them.

Really good.  Great taste and aroma.  I served it inside a warm pitas with Tzatziki Sauce and chopped onion, tomatoes.  Yummy.

I left raisins (was out of them)I too, felt like I was eating lamb instead of ground beef. EASY, just a LITTLE SPICY, SWEET, AND A NICE UNIQUE flavor. You could easily skip the skewers, but it was a fun way to serve, making presentation a little more interesting. I have used ground beef and ground turkey(not together);both are great! I served with a mayo/mustard/horseradish mix sauce. Thank you, for sharing this one, Marlies Monika! It is one to make again and again!

I'm not sure what I did wrong. The flavor of the meat was good, but they fell apart on the grill.  I might try to make this again.

This is very good.  I always use ground turkey.  Also, I highly recommend that you mix this up ahead of time, preferably the day before, so that the flavors of the spices have time to permeate the meat.  It makes a huge difference!  I serve this with pita, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, garlic sauce, and tzaziki sauce.  Favorite sides are tabbouli and hummus.  Yummy!

Man oh man this was sure some TASTY stuff. First off, I changed one ingredient: for the raisins I used Craisins. We're not big on raisins in meat dishes.  I ALMOST left the craisins out but I'm sure glad I didn't.  This wonderful meat mixture has a different flavor all-round, sweet and savory with interesting underlying spices.  My BF said I MUST make these for our next BBQ. I served it with "Green Goddess Dip" (from here) without the anchovies, and "Mushroom Rice Pilaf" from here as well. What a wonderful meal! Only thing I was missing was a nice salad.

That was soooooooooo good. It was a really nice change to ordinary burgers. We had a barbecue on our terrace and I served the Souzoukaklia skewers with fresh tomato salad dressed with olive oil and balsamico vinegar. My kids and friends raved about it.

Just finished dinner(this recipe) and my husband raved!! He was sure it must be lamb or some other meat than ground beef.   We will definately have this again. Maybe for company next time. I, too, left the raisins whole.

This was a light "meat" meal. Subtlely different than a burger. Served with couscous and cucumber salad. Grill as you would a burger; we only cooked 10 minutes at most. A definite make again.

Great mix of spices and sweetness, just don't overcook like I did.  Raisins work well to add flavor and texture.

Burnt it a bit but the husband didn't notice.  Next time I'll grill it at a lower temp.

I made these into burgers the next time and served them in buns...amazing!

My husband and I both enjoyed the different flavor of this meat very much.  My children weren't thrilled.  The only thing my husband and I were trying to figure out was a good way to serve this.  It actually might be good in a pita with some sort of sauce,  but it needs something tangy,  since the meat is very mild. Anyway,  we'll be making this again,  it was fun to find a new use for ground beef.

Very good & easy.  Served with warm pita bread from Harris Teeter, tzatziki sauce,  sliced cukes and sliced onion.  No changes just mixed the meat the night before so the flavors had some time to meld.  Grilled fine on skewers & came out moist.  Yum!

This was the most fantastic recipe I have ever taken a chance on.  I wanted something a little different for dinner, and immediately thought of trying something from a different culture.  When I was making it, the different spices worried me, however, I am glad I followed through.  When I was putting the sausages on the skewers, they seemed extremely large, however after they cooked, they were perfect portions.

Very good! Just a few minor changes. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins b/c I had them on hand. Love them! I shaped these into meatballs & cooked them in a frying pan instead of the grill. Then, I let them sit in a low heat oven for about 30 minutes while I got the rest of the food ready. This allowed for more of the fat to drain out, while the meatballs still remained moist & delicious. I will make these again. Thanks!

I didn't have corriander or parsley but followed everything else in the recipe and it tasted amazing!  I was so surprised how good the raisons tasted in it.  Will definitely be making again, we had no leftovers!

This was incredible! A little time consuming for a worknight but WOW!  When we put it on the grill the kids thought it smelled just like the State Fair :). Wonderful!  I would like to make these into meatballs or a patty to put into a pita.  Plus I think it would be awesome if it were made ahead but that is because I am lazy when I get home from work.  Thank you so much for this recipe, we all loved it!!!

This was really good. I had to omit the raisins as I am diabetic and they are not good for me but it was tasty anyways. I added cumin for a little more flavor and grilled them on the skewers, but they fell off the skewers so they became long burgers. Oh well, it didn't change the flavor. I also roasted some whole sweet potatoes with the meat and added some steamed dijon broccoli to make a complete meal. I will make this again.

What a great way to change up ground beef.  I served it with tzatziki sauce and pita, was a huge hit.  Later I thought some sliced Vidalia onions would have make the sandwich perfect.  Will make again!

I found this to be a little bland, which is unusual for me since I don't like a huge amount of spices. I really liked the sweetness of the raisins, so I will increase the raisins (which I added whole) and maybe some more spice. Maybe the difference was the fact I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dried. It was a nice way to use ground beef without having burgers.

Use a high-quality meat--the ground beef I used was a bit on the tough side.  I would mince up the onion before adding, versus chopping.  I tried making burgers out of these, but I think they would work better as skewers as the recipe calls for.  Good flavor, though.  I would try again with some tzatziki sauce.

what a unique flavour!  The only thing that I would make sure of for next time is to chop the onions fine!  No big chunks.  I formed my meat mixture into patties and did them on the foreman grill, did not add the sugar and also I didn't have raisins so I added chopped dates!  I will definately make these again.

Wonderful mix of flavours. Reminds me on the oriental cuisine where a broad range of spices is used to create a really unique and typical flavour. Fantastic dish! Thanks!

Great for something different than the usual hamburger. will definitely add this to the regular rotation. I served it with the "Orzo and Parmesan with Basil" recipe from this site and they went very well together. While we skipped the bun we did use ketchup but would have preferred a different type of gravy or sauce to better enhance the flavors in the meat. I'm not sure what else to try but to me it definitely needs something or else it would be kind of dry. Would welcome any suggestions! Thanks allrecipes for sending this one out in the daily dish. I would never have found it otherwise!

This is great!! I followed the recipe exactly like it mentioned and did not make any changes to it. This is the first Greek dish that I have prepared and it taste wonderful. I did not have skewers available, so instead I made small patties out of them and ate with rice & peas. I grilled over stovetop because I do not have a outside grill available. Overall, Great dish!!!

my dh and i thought this was ok...the ONLY ingredient i left out was the sugar, just because i forgot it.  so, not sure if that will change the entire dish or not.  just not as flavorful as expected. maybe if i doubled up the spices..not sure; but thanks anyway Marlies, we love to try new things!  :-)

Interesting texture, but it definitely needs some type of sauce--way too dry for my taste!. We added a little Italian dressing (along with lettuce and tomatoes)and served it in whole wheat pitas.

Wow!  This meat was fantastic!  The spices and raisins melded well together with the meat and made for quite an explosion of flavor.  I sprayed Pam on the skewers as well as the grate before grilling to prevent sticking.  I used regular fresh parsley because I didn't have the flat leaf variety.  My husband and children kept thanking me for making the dish.  I was so pleased especially since this is a snap to prepare.

This was really delicious!  The flavour  is so different, out of the ordinary.  We loved it.  Only catch was I couldn't get them to stay on a skewer so just cooked them as a patty.  Served with tzsiki sauce.

5.5.16  Please, even if you're not a raisin fan, don't omit them.  I really think they're an important part of this recipe and will eliminate what several reviewers expressed as "bland."  The raisins don't overpower, but they provide a distinct flavor and a little bit of sweetness.  Prepared the recipe as written, and we thoroughly enjoyed this.  I think a little sauce over the skewers would be nice, maybe even a tzaitziki sauce?  Marlies Monika, thanks for sharing your recipe!

I live in an apartment and can't really grill, so I did these in a pan on my stove and they turned out really good. I just let them sit on one side until they blackened a bit, then rolled them over to do the same on the other side. You have to be gentle to make sure they don't fall apart, but it works! And the flavor was so good!

Husband and son thought these were wonderful and "Please make them again!"   I used 2# of meat and half was ground sirloin and the other half was ground lamb.  This really gave the kebobs a Mediterranean flair!  Also did not use the raisins this first round--might incorporate them next time.  I served with a chopped vegetable Greek salad--a fabulous meal!

I made them as burger patties. I’ve never had a real souzoukaklia but I was expecting something really different. The first few bites were nothing special except biting into those chopped raisins. I was a bit disappointed.  The flavor was fine.  I was worried about adding sugar on top of sweet raisins but they mellowed out nicely. I liked the faint heat from the cayenne pepper too. My husband hates dishes with fruits but I think he’ll be fine with this one (I made this for my lunch as a test before serving it to my family). The only change I will make is to reduce the amount of coriander.

I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the sugar.  I formed them into a hamburger shape and cooked them on the George Foreman grill - they cooked in just 3 minutes!  Served with Greek salad, easy tzatzkiki (from allrecipes) and grape leaves.  The whole family loved them.  Will make these again!

I'm giving it 4 stars because I think it would have been better had the onions been sauteed first. Also, I didn't have enough ground beef, so I used 1 lb ground beef plus 1/2 lb ground pork since that's what I had. The flavors were outstanding. The texture of the onions was gross to me, personally, and I probably would have liked it more if they were softened first.

I just made it into a sausage form, but didn’t put it on a stick and I accidentally left out the onion, plus I cooked it on a grated pan and not the bbq. Still great. We ate it with lettuce and tzazhiki sauce on a pita. Scrumptious! I will make again.

Very good!  I really liked it.  (So did the kids)  I ended up using dried apricots instead of raisins (didn't have any and husband doesn't like them) Plus I threw in a handfull of pinenuts.
I'll make it again!

One of my husbands favorite recipes! I also add oregano, minced garlic, paprika (smokey), olive oil, and lemon zest. I omit the cayenne because I have a little one. I've made it once with it and didn't like it as much. Sometimes I'll add feta to the meat. I've made this with lamb as well and it was really good! I serve this with the Greek potato recipe on this site as well, and romaine, black olive, and tomato salad.

Turned out pretty dry using leaner meat. Kids didn't care for it.

Pretty bland, definitely needs something.  Made for Greek themed party and although a few folks said they liked it, lots of leftovers suggests most did not.
