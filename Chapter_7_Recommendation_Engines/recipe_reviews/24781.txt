Hubby and older daughter were out last night, so I made these for just Ty and myself. I added chopped onion, garlic and onion powders a little cayenne and a package of spinach to the chicken mixture. I topped the inside of the crepe with parm as well as the outside. The two of us really enjoyed these quick and tasty crepes Leah!

Skipped the olives and used mushrooms and boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I also placed steamed asparagus inside each crepe.  Very good.

I think this recipe is very delicious. It's very good and it's not "too bland".  I am not a very good cook and it was easy to make.  I was able to follow the directions and make this delicious treat.  My kids all really liked it.  They call me "The Curry Guy" now.  Also they started getting better grades at school after I made this for them.

This was my first attempt at making crepes, so the whole dish took 2 hours to make. However, with practice I can see total prep time to serving on the table to be about an hour.  I had to add 1 TBSP flour and approx. 1 TBSP cornstarch to get the thickness I desired in the sauce. Plus I cut out the 1/2 cup warm water.  Next time I think I will add 3/4 cup mushrooms to the mix. My husband loved the dinner and so did I!!!!

If you DO NOT like spice-then this ones for you! I think it's very bland and needs some kick! Otherwise, the flavors are pleasant and ingredients are well-suited together.

This is a wonderful, simple dish.  I have a family with 6 kids ranging from 18-5 and it was a hit with all...That is a great dish in my book!

Delicious and great presentation. Used canned chicken, added fresh minced garlic and heavy whipping cream instead of milk. Omitted the salt.

I added 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup to the crepe filling to make it creamier.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.

Awesome! I adapted this recipe a little... I didn't have olives, or an onion, and I added a can of sliced water chestnuts.  Also, I made the Basic Crepes recipe, and added a few dashes of curry powder and some creole seasoning (salt, white, black, and red pepper)   My wife doesn't like celery much, and really doesn't care for it cooked, but between the two of us we cleaned the pan, there were no leftovers... :)  Definitely will be making this again.

I recently took a crepe course, and they did the crepe mixture in the blender and then let it sit for 20 minutes...that's what I did.  I used a 10" flat-sided non-stick skillet, and the crepes cooked up beautifully.  I used about 1/3 cup for each crepe, and ended up with 13.  Word of caution:  don't really pile the filling onto the crepe, or you won't have enough to fill all of them.  Followed the directions to the T, and the only thing that I will do next time is omit the salt.  You have bouillon in there, so I'd suggest that you start with no salt, and then add if you feel it needs it (it was a little too salty for us).  I also did bump up the curry powder to about 1-1/2 tsp.  If you want to try something "outside the box," give this a shot.  It is a special dish and it may not be for everybody, but we  thoroughly enjoyed it.  A nice side dish was AR's almond citrus couscous.  Definitely will be making this again. Thanks Leah for an outstanding entree!

Thought these came out a little dry.  I did use canned chicken so will try again with fresh.  Will try next time with thighs or dark meat chicken as it has more flavor and doesn't tend to dry out as with chicken breast.  Thanks for the post, will try again.

I've made this several times--it's SO good--definitely a favorite!  I follow the recipe exactly, and everyone I've served it to loves the combination of flavors.  I use a shredded rotisserie chicken to save on time, and it is far from bland--it's flavorful but not spicy.  I think the people who complained about blandness were using canned chicken.  It's perfect w/ the rotisserie chicken.  I make a double batch and freeze one...when I need a quick weeknight supper, I take it out of the freezer the night before to let it thaw and then cook at 350 for 30 min.   This is an elegant and delicious dish--I'm making it again tonight!

I used hot curry and organic creme along with the milk.  This recipe is fabulous and I think you could use it over rice too.

I must admit that I did change a few things but the basic recipe is great.  I added porcini mushrooms and peas instead of the olives and also added some wine to the stock. These are simple and taste great thanks

I made this recipe last night for the first time.  I must say that when I viewed the recipe, it looked a little bland so I read the reviews and followed many others advice.  I increased the curry powder to 2 tsp., added some bell pepper, ginger, garlic and half a jalapeno because I didn't have cayenne pepper.  The result was delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I actually followed this one a little more closely than I usually follow recipes, but made a few changes, most based on the other reviews here. First of all, I didn't include the olives, because olives are an abomination. As others have said, I added some cayenne, because I've hardly met a recipe that couldn't be improved by some cayenne (ok, well, maybe not cupcakes). I also added 2 tsp of curry as others have said, but then I tasted the mixture and added even more than that. Lastly, I added just a little cream to my milk. It was pretty outstanding, and worth all the work. I don't recommend making it when it's 95 degrees out though, like I did.

This recipe is VERY salty.  If I decide to make it again, I'll cut out the salt entirely.  The Bouillon is salty enough on its own.    Like someone else, I added garlic and cayenne pepper.  This gave it a bit more of a kick.

Wow!  Just finished this meal with asparagus and a glass of Pinot Noir.  This was really good!  I did use 2 teaspoons of curry, otherwise did not change a thing!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was really good.  I didn't have black olives on hand, so I skipped them.  I added raisins, and they were incredible in there.  I'd omit the salt next time -- the bullion cubes are plenty salty.  I don't do great with dairy so I subbed soy milk for all the milk called for here, and it came out fine.

We love this dish.  I make them up in advance and freeze them.  They are great for a quick dinner.  The only thing I changed was to substitute dried cranberries for the olives.  Sweet and savory.

So great!  Usually when I make it I almost double the curry and cut the salt in half (but I use salted butter).  I also sub canned coconut milk if I have it.  I could just eat the filling with a spoon... but usually I will serve it over greens, rice, or quinoa, or wrap it in a tortilla if I don't feel like doing the crepes part.

It was very good!  I added cream of mushroom soup and did mushrooms instead of olives.  I ended up with a lot of leftover mixture so I poured it over the crepes and then added a lot of cheese.
