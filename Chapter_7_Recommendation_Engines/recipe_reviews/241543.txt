Delicious!! The first time I made it, I did exactly what the recipe called for except I used pinto beans because I did not have the soup. It came out pretty thin but still tasted great! The second time and )the best time that I made this dip....I just drained one can of pinto beans and one can of dark kidney beans. Also, I used only half a cup of sour cream. The second time was so delicious!! I could not find anyone that did not like it. The one I made changes to  I forgot to mention one important thingâ€¦ ***I used bacon bits in the beans for the flavor I was missing since I did not have The soup mentioned in the original recipe. If you prefer a thicker bean dip like I do, use two cans of beans that you strain very well. So incredibly Yummy!!!!
