I actually used leftover shredded "mexican" chicken in this recipe and reduced fat mayonnaise. I wanted a little more kick so I tossed in some chopped pickled jalapenos. I made a wrap out of this, filling it out a bit with shredded lettuce, halved cherry tomatoes and a little shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Simple and delicious.

Sometimes the simplest recipes turn out to be some of the best! I love chicken salad and I had two leftover herb grilled chicken breasts and a lonely red bell pepper that needed to be used up before grocery night.  What a pleasant surprise this little recipe turned out to be! I cooked the bell pepper as instructed and put everything into the food processor along with the salt, pepper, as well as a bit of garlic and onion powders. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used half and half with light mayo (added a little more than called for). I let this chill for an hour before serving. This chicken salad was creamy and delicious. It was perfect on melba toast and next time I might try it in a wrap! Thanks for a really great recipe.

This is *SO* good! I made it for lunch and had it again for dinner! I had to cheat a little because I didn't have heavy cream. I used a teaspoon of skim milk and about a teaspoon of sour cream to thicken it a bit. Turned out very well. The flavor gets even better after it sits for a while. I ate it with baby spinach leaves for lunch and for dinner I had it on toasted wheat bread. Thank you, Katie! This is a keeper!

Yum. This is almost exactly the recipe I use for chicken salad--I usually add diced celery, too. It is good with or without the cream, with or without the celery, but always must have the red pepper. it is amazing, and simple. I've used poached chicken, and I've used canned chicken (kirkland). It's really, really good! Thanks for posting this!

Very interesting recipe, one I didn’t understand correctly until I started to prepare it.  I should know better than to proceed on a recipe before reading it through!  The idea of the red pepper really appealed to me (I took a shortcut and microwaved it) -   but what threw me was when I (finally) noticed that the chicken was to be blended in the food processor along with the red pepper, mayo and cream.  With all respect to the submitter, that did NOT appeal to me, although I understand that foods you grew up with you don’t necessarily think of as odd when others not familiar with it might.  For me it was – I envisioned, basically, homemade baby food.  So instead, I pureed the red pepper, mayonnaise and cream and it made an exquisitely beautiful sauce – but it was pretty blah tasting.  I doctored it up with some garlic salt, a shot of Worcestershire sauce and some chopped green onion and not only was it an instant fix, it was wonderful.  I mixed that sauce up with the chicken and I had the chunkiness and flavor I desired.  I wanted something a little more interesting than just sandwiching it between two slices of white bread so I used it along with strips of bacon, fresh baby spinach and tortillas to make wraps – and they were AWESOME good!  To complete the meal I served them with a hearty bowl of chicken minestrone.

This is really good.  I doubled the recipe and roasted the pepper in the oven (sliced in half, layed skin side up on a cookie sheet and broiled about 15 minutes then put in a bowl and covered with a towel for about 15 min to steam then peeled off the skin).  I really like the consistency of the pureed chicken.  It's a nice change of pace from a lunchmeat sandwich.

This is something I do all the time.  I brine skin-on bone-in chicken breasts in salted water overnight.  Doesn't have to be real salty, but the results are very flavorful and moist chicken.  Drain, pat dry.  Rub with olive oil, sprinkle with Cavendars Greek Seasoning and, here's the kicker, slip 2 or 3 whole basil leaves under the skin.  Line a cookie sheet with foil, place the chicken on a wire rack on the cookie sheet.  Roast in a preheated 425F oven for about 1 hour, depending on the size of the breasts.  Remove, tent with foil, and let rest until cooled.  Remove the skin, debone, chop.  I love adding roasted red bell pepper, golden raisins, and depending on my mood, maybe some curry powder, maybe not.  A touch of honey is nice, garlic powder, black pepper.  Just play with it.  The combinations are endless.

Oh my, this is so good! I love the simplicity of this recipe. I actually boiled my bell peppers together with the chicken, removing them in 10 minutes as the recipe stated. I had this on French Bread Rolls to Die For (recipe also on this site) and it was simply delicious. Thanks for sharing your recipe Katie. Definitely one I'll be making often!

These were quite good, although I found that it was a bit dry, so I will probably add a little extra mayo or sour cream next time. But I enjoyed the flavors and it was certainly simple to throw together- I stuffed into little pita halves and it was the perfect lunch to take for work. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have enough leftover chicken to make the full recipe, so I scaled it to 1 chicken breast.  I love the addition of the red bell pepper. I served it on toasted honey wheat bread.  Yummy!

super easy. I biled the chicken with garlic powder and salt. I also used olive oil mayonnaise and placed them on mini croissants. I agree with other reviewers, it is better to "under process" the mix or it will become too much like a spread.

This was good, but needs some tweaking.  I had grilled chicken in the freezer, so I used that.    I microwaved the bell pepper and let it drain on a paper towel.  Using my emersion blender I blended the mayo and pepper only.  I didn’t add the cream because my mixture was already too thin.  I then folded in the cubed chicken, adding sliced green onions for a little more color/flavor.  This was good, but the mayonnaise/pepper mixture was just too thin.  Next time I will try to blot out more of the moisture in the pepper before blending it with the mayonnaise.  Using roasted red pepper from a jar would make this even easier and quicker.  This has potential and I will try it again.

Yum! This is really good. I did season the water that I boiled the chicken in with garlic powder, onion powder, and celery salt. I completely forgot about the heavy cream when I was making it so I left that out. I served this on croissants with lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes. Very good. Thanks for the recipe I'll be making this again.

Definately a 5 star recipe! I had 3 breasts to use up so I added a little extra mayo & cream(I actually used half & half). I added some red onion & celery because I'm trying to use up a bunch of odds & ends. Fantastic! I ate it along side a cucumber salad & I'm thinking cucumbers would be a good addition on this sammie too. Yum!

If I hadn't read the reviews, I wouldn't have tried this. I'm so glad I did! It hasn't even had a chance to get cold yet, but I already had a sandwich, and it's very good. I do think I will add a little garlic and a bit more mayo or sour cream. My cream was expired, so I used a bit of fat-free half-and-half (didn't think of sour cream till it was too late), and it's good. I'm using light mayo as well, and it's still very tasty. I'm so tempted to have another sandwich.

I love this. I have been craving red bell peppers & I've always loved canned chicken instead of tuna. So I used canned chicken. This was fabulous, add bell peppers & heavy whipping cream to my regular sandwich :))))) awesome. Chili powder is good also, but the red bell peppers tops that. Im going to try it in a tortilla with some cabbage, going a bit along with another review only I dont have lettuce. Yaaay I love it.

I love this recipe, my husband and I have made it a few times now and it is so easy, tasty and refreshing.  We roast our red peppers on our gas oven and saute some onion in garlic to go in it.  And instead of heavy cream we use sour cream like some of the other reviewers suggested.  We put it in the flavored wraps you can get at the grocery store (like spinach or tomato basil) and they are amazing.

So Good! I was looking for a recipe for a simple chicken salad to use up a leftover poached chicken breast.  I used some roasted red pepper slices (from a jar), added a little piece of celery, and wizzed it up in my magic bullet.  Could not have been easier. I would definitely serve this as an appetizer with some crackers or cocktail bread. Maybe with a little sprinkle of toasted almonds on top...Yum!

If the chicken had just been chopped and not processed smooth, I believe this recipe would have been better.  The red pepper adds a nice flavor, but other than that, not much to discuss here as far as flavor.  My husband did comment that it tasted better the next day.

Very good. I added half an avocado (for more nutrients) and scallions. I don't have a food processor so I just finely chopped the chicken and red pepper and eliminated the heavy cream (which deducts calories!). It was yummy!

I loved it!
I didn't boil the vegetables, I prefer them raw... And I used Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream. It was delicious  :)

This was ok. I actually found it quite bland. I ended up adding a bit of minced onion to the mix to perk it up. But I don't think it's a recipe I will try again.

got this recipe in my inbox and tried it the same day. It was very good. Just added a few seasonings, like garlic powder and roasted red peppers. Will take it to my next luncheon at work.

This was very easy to make, and since it is very basic, you can add whatever you like to spice it up a little bit. The perfect recipe to fill those hungry mouths if you don't have many ingredients at home.
