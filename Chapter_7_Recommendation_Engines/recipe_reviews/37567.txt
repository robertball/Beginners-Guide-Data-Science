I tried these and loved them.  I now use ranch dressing on all my burgers.  I didn't care for the salsa all that much and ended up just using a very little amount.  The meat itself is very bland and doesn't compete with the toppings.  I did have trouble with my burgers falling apart on the grill since there was no binder.  I will keep the buns, ranch, bacon and cheese, but use a better burger recipe.
