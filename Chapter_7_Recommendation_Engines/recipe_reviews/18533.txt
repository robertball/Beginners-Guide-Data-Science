I changed the recipe a bit based on previous reviews.

I reduced the crystallized ginger by half (next time, I'll reduce it a little more), I omitted the red pepper flakes, and I added about 1/4 cup of sugar.

I needed to cook a little longer than instructed as I wanted more of the cranberries to pop.

Everyone who likes cranberries liked this recipe and I will use again.

Note:  I found that the ginger intensified on the second day.  Keep this in mind if you are making a day ahead.

This is absolutely wonderful!  Very  light and refreshing.
I did take the advice of other reviewers: used orange juice instead of water, extended the cooking time until the cranberries burst, didn't use the pepper flakes and cut the amount of crystalized ginger in half.  I did, however, add some of the ginger syrup left over from making the crystalized ginger for a bit more kick. At the end of cooking, I also added some pomegranate seeds for a nice crunch. This went over so well on Thanksgiving, I had to make another batch the next day!  Did I mention that it's fantastic over vanilla ice cream?
Many, many thanks, Bea, for a new family favorite!

My 12-year old granddaughter made it with me and we both loved the recipe. A caution, however -- use less ginger because it grows stronger as time goes by.  She liked it better without the peppers.

This is a wonderful combo of piquant/sweet. Didn't have crystalized ginger; used about a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and 2 TBl. of balsamic vinegar. Reminds me of Autumn Chutney from Harry & David. If there is any leftover chutney; I'll be combining it with whipping cream to use as a sauce for pork tenderloin or chicken breasts served over wild rice. This is a gourmet meal in itself.

This is exceptional and easy to prepare. I modified it slightly in two ways: 1) added 1 tsp salt to temper the sweetness and make it more a true chutney and 2)pureed 3/4 of the mixture to make it more suitable for spreading on crusty bread or crackers with herbed brie. It was a hit with my holiday guests and made an excellent gift for the neighbors.

Wonderful, very tart cranberry chutney and much better than the plain canned version! Crystallized ginger was not available, but one teaspoon of ground ginger is a more than adequate substitute. This made enough to also fill a half pint jar and present to a friend who had invited us to dinner. It is great with ham!

LOVE THIS! Only change I made (we all make changes even though we love a recipe!)...I use orange juice instead of water to boil cranberries and dried apricots.  Just adds 1 more layer to the flavor! I've also used dates instead of raisins.

Left out the apricots and added about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Absolutely delicious. Much better than any other cranberry chutney/salad/etc. I've ever had. This will be a permanent addition to my holiday menus.

Everyone loved it!  I added more sugar than called for because we like a sweet sauce.  It was very tangy, but not as spicy as I expected.  Even the kids loved it.  A very different taste.

This recipe was awesome and was a hit at our Thanksgiving Dinner we had on Saturday.  It was the first time I ever used fresh cranberries and won't be the last.  The combination of apple, cranberry & ginger (along with the balance of ingredients) were well suited.  I have already planned making this again to be included in my gift baskets to each of my family members.

I made in my bread machine on the jam setting, and tossed in the ginger/lemon etc in when there was 3 minutes remaining and let it do all the work. Excellent!

Combined this with another chutney recipe I have. I didn't use an apple and I put in chili covered dried mango in place of the apricots. I also added some cider vinegar and chopped jalapenos.

Made this for a pre-Thanksgiving trial run and we really liked it. We love trying new, different things. Cooked it until the cranberries popped as others said in reviews. We'll be bringing it to the relatives' for Turkey Day!

Although this was nice and easy to make, and looked great on the table, I wasn't crazy about the flavor of this one...maybe I'm just not a cranberry chutney kinda girl.

This got lots of compliments at Thanksgiving.  The only thing I did differently was to cut back the red pepper flakes by 1/2 and I added some splenda.

This is a delicious, unique, & fun alternative to the standard Thanksgiving cranberry sauce. I have made it several years in a row, & it is now a yearly tradition.  My only changes: I easily double the amount of brown sugar & also add a 1/2 cup of white sugar; otherwise, it is very sour. I have never added the ginger, but I'm sure it is a nice addition

Just tested this recipe for this coming Thanksgiving and it is fantastic. I'm going to leave out the ginger and red pepper flakes because I want to make sure it's a dish that will make the majority of palettes at my dinner table happy! I'm sure it will.. 

Make sure to add a 1/4 cup of white sugar and cook covered for the first five minutes after adding the cranberries to allow some cranberries to pop.

This was wonderful! Great with our Thanksgiving turkey. I used a little less pepper flakes since I made it in advance. Make sure you let the cranberries "pop" to get the full cranberry flavor mixed with everything.

Did not have crystallized ginger. I used ground ginger. I'm sure it would have made a difference. It still was a very nice recipe. Thanks for sharing.

OMG - is this delicious! I made this twice - once for Thanksgiving dinner and a second time to can and give as gifts. It is fantastic with brie, havarti or monterey jack cheese (I also made panini). My friends loved receiving jars for Christmas and have all said this is the BEST thing they've ever eaten.

This is the best there ever was or could be.  Tasty and colorful.  I gave up on cooked cranberry sauce years ago and this is what I have been searching for since.  Do not change one thing.  Yum. Marnie

Wonderful recipe, but do not expect it to come out as this picture suggests.  This wonderful effect (as you see it in the picture) can be achieved by threading your chunkier and/or heartier ingredients onto a simple series of kabob skewers  held together in the middle of a molded tower of white rice.  This will take nothing away from the taste but will still leave you with the photo-grand image you see in the picture here.

OMG! from someone who does not usually eat cranberry sauce, this was excellent.  I did not use the pepper flakes, so it was not hot/spicy.  The flavors all blended so well and I had no left overs because they were eating it all by itself.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner last year. It was the first time I ever WANTED to eat my turkey with cranberry sauce. This also made an EXCELLENT spread for leftover turkey sandwiches. This will be a new Thanksgiving tradition.

I made this for Thanksgiving 06. There were guests who didn't even know what chutney was - they do now. There wern't any leftovers. This is a great addition to our dinner and will remain on the menu!

It had more kick to it(from the ginger) when it was warm from the stove. It was still good several days later after sitting in the frig, but wasn't so spicy. The other fruits kept it from being so tart.

This dish is really good, it has lots of flavor and is best if you like some spicy heat. The raisins and apricots are tasty and definitely cook the cranberries until they pop. I think I will incorporate it in a cheese ball with crackers or vanilla wafers.

I just can't give this a higher rating.  I did reduce the crystallized ginger to 1/2 of what the recipe called for, but it still overpowered the chutney after one day.  I really wish I hadn't tried it at all.....quite an expensive disappointment.

This is definitely a five star recipe.  I usually do not change a recipe the first time I make it, however I did use orange juice instead of water.  I made a double recipe to give as gifts with a wheel of brie and a sleeve of crackers.  Everyone loves it!  I also found the ginger to add a wonderful flavor as well as the little bit of heat from the pepper.  Don't change this recipe except for the orange juice.  Oh, I did cook it longer to make it thicker.

Like others, I cut the ginger in half and used orange juice instead of water. I did not add sugar. I enjoyed it, but others found it a little overpowering. Would further reduce ginger next time as I made it a day before and had leftovers the day after and by then, the flavour had further intensified.

I omitted the pepper and ginger. ( I'm not a fan of Ginger). I used less sugar. I added pinch of spice mixture consisting of  cinnamon clove and nutmeg. Next time I will add slightly more apricot pieces .

Amazing flavor!  And it looked wonderful while it was cooking.  I cooked it until the cranberries burst.  ¶  I'm allergic to apricots, so substituted dried mango.  The color and texture are near indistinguishable, and the flavor is close enough.  It made a perfect substitute.  ¶  I noticed that some reviewers stated that the ginger flavor was too strong.  I made my own candied ginger -- it was cheaper, but a lot more work -- still, I'd do it again, because the results were worth it: the flavor was perfect!  ¶  I did goof a bit, though.  I put the chopped apple in the lemon juice to keep it from turning brown, before I realized I was supposed to add the lemon juice later.  Actually, the ginger and pepper flakes were also added before simmering.  Still, it worked out well.  ¶  Best cranberry dish I ever made.

We loved this. I did use orange juice instead of water after reading other reviews. It was my only deviation In the ingredients. I diced up the ginger into small pieces & we thought the amount called for was perfect. We didn't think it was stronger the next day either. I also cooked the cranberries a little longer so that more popped. I'm taking this to our family Christmas party.

This recipe is the BEST cranberry sauce recipe ever! The crystallized ginger and red pepper flakes, plus the delicious combination of fruit, makes this super flavorful.  When I remember, I follow one of the suggestions in the reviews and switch out water for orange juice.  Even with the water, though, the flavor is incredible.

Made it a few times.  My husband does not like cranberry jellies whatsoever but this he is quite fond of.  I followed the recipe and had no problem.  I will continue to make it and serve it with turkey and it also works well with pork.

Still have to cool, but the lemon s overwhelming. Would cut the lemon juice to 2Tblsp. Also added 1/2 tsp curry powder and kept the ginger unchanged. Didn't add extra sugar as others suggested.
1wk later- lemon flavor mellowed out but will still decrease amt.

Not bad, but the amount of crystallized ginger made the recipe a little too gingery for us. It makes it a fairly pricey recipe.

I have made this recipe at least a couple dozen times.  I make it during the holidays as gifts, and always well received.  I didn't make any changes except I went a little light on the red pepper flakes.

Dropped the ginger and pepper flakes.  Used half of an orange for the zest and the juice.  I'm making this on a Saturday before Thanksgiving so I didn't want the flavors of the pepper and ginger to overpower the taste by sitting for so many days.  It tastes amazing!  I let the cranberries burst.  I may chop the apple into a finer dice next time.  I covered with plastic and refrigerated it; should be awesome for a make-ahead dish!
