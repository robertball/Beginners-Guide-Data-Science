I know this is a recipe from stevia... but I live in Germany and the recipe they are trying to create is not so sweet. Add a bit of honey or Agave nectar for sweetness as needed. Also, be sure to add 2 Tbsp. pumpkin seeds to make it really authentic!

This is a delicious recipe. I actually used half the Stevia and it was perfect. Great on top of plain yogurt!
