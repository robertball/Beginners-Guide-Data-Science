I made a half a batch of these to see whether or not I like blondies (which I've never eaten before). They are pretty good,but they might be too cakey for brownie lovers.

Delicious! Although I agree with others that it was cakey but I had no leftovers after taking it to my son's 5th grade mixer!

These were very good. I only had country crock yogurt spread on hand and was not sure how that would work but they turned out great anyway. Im not a big fan of brownies so these are a great alternative.

The recipe worked fine, but I prefer chocolate chip cookies. I had been expecting something a little denser, but it was very cake-like - if you like light and fluffy, this recipe may work for you.
