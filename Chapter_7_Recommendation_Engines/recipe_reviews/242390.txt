I made 2 loaves as directed, except I didn't have any whole wheat flour so I sub'd tef flour and wheat germ. It just came out of the oven (45 min) and I just ate about 1/3 loaf! Really tasty - light & not too sweet or oily.

8.18.18  The grated squash was very wet, so I did give it a good spin in my salad spinner (a lot of liquid came out).  Added a few more blueberries and used white whole wheat flour as well as the all purpose flour, otherwise, followed the directions.  I always bake recipes like this in three mini loaf pans primarily for portion control, and they baked for 35 minutes at 350ÂºF.  I agree with the recipe submitter, this is probably not something your kids are going to go wild about, but it is extremely moist, tender, and the blueberries just pop in your mouth (there's your sweetness).  One loaf was eaten today, and the other two went into the freezer. Hannah Rose, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I used Agave liquid sweetener , used self rising flour, added pineapple juice instead of blueberry syrup, put 1 full cup of pecans in, and added 2 cups of fresh blueberries, and used 1 cup of fresh ground apples instead of oil -- very moist -- very good -- i also baked it at a lower temp 325 for an hour and a half -- really a great recipe!! Thank you

So delicious! I made this so my son could have a nice after school snack, he loved it! I enjoy it for breakfast, warmed in the toaster. I used double blueberries and no walnuts. The only blueberry syrup I could find was Smucker's, so perhaps that's why my bread is sweeter than I was expecting. Thanks so much for the recipe, HannahRose!

This bread turned out really good.  I did not have wheat flour so I just used regular flour.  I also had to use regular maple syrup instead of the blueberry syrup.   I look forward to making it again with the blueberry syrup.

I love this concept of using some non-conventional bread ingredients.  My boyfriend came home with a mexican squash and I had no idea what to do with it!  I used this recipe as adapted to the mexican squash and added a 1/4 cup of sugar, a couple more blueberries, a tablespoon of applesause and some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips- it turned out wonderfully.  Thank you!

I  substituted sugar for the blueberry syrup and used only half the honey.  I substituted applesauce for half the margarine to make it low fat. I added a tablespoon of molasses and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I  didn't have blueberries so I  admitted those.  Very good bread.

This bread is a great use for extra squash and blueberries. Nice texture and not too sweet. I substituted bread flour for the whole wheat flour and instead of blueberry syrup, I used homemade blueberry jam. My toddler enjoyed eating it!
