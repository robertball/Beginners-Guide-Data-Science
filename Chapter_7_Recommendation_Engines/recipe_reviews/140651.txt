As a resident of Kentucky I have to say that this tastes nothing like traditional burgoo.It's almost impossible to get the right taste in small batches of burgoo and it's also best to let burgoo slow cook for 1 to 2 days.No one ever said making good food was easy but it tastes a billion times better when done right.

I didn't  follow this to a tee, but as a guide. Man is this good! I have a house full of picky eaters and this went over well with everybody. I find it's like a cross between chili, and pasta fagul, with a little bit of BBQ, and no heartburn. Will I make it again?
Till the day I die!

This got rave reviews in my house!! I used wild hog and chicken thighs. Used Rotel for tomatoes and V-8 for Tomato juice. I added bell pepper and 2 Tbsp red pepper puree and did not use any salsa.

Great recipe.  I am from Western Ky, but live in Eastern Ky now.  This soup is only known in the Western area.  I've never found anywhere else in the country that you can get it.  Almost every large gathering in Western Ky features it and it is traditionally cooked in a cast iron kettle over an open fire.  This recipe is slightly different than what I'm used to but was still very good.

Not Burgoo, more like a Brunswick Stew but still not quite. This stuff is made from all the leftovers on the buffet at the famous Moonlite BBQ, and its believed the name comes from sluring 'Bird Stew'... Wheres the bird?

I used lamb and cut out the okra and corn (my husbnd does not like either), but it came out beautiful. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a spoon!
