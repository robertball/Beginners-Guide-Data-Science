I used a different brand pesto that I had on hand (sorry Buitoni) and I substituted black beans - again what I had on hand.  I can see how white beans may have been a little creamier and the color would have been better.  Still, it was pretty good.

I made this exactly as listed and it was okay. Then I doctored it up by adding 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 3/4 teaspoon dried oregano, a LOT more fresh-ground black pepper and a little salt. It's pretty good. I'm hoping after it sits overnight, it will be even better. One tip, though - drain the white beans really well. Mine turned out kind of runny (I think it should be as thick as hummus.) It is really fast to make, though - 5 minutes start to finish including the doctoring up.

Not bad.  Easy to make if you have pesto already prepared.
