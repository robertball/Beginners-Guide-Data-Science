I substituted regular homemade pie crust at the bottom of my springform pan.  I substituted 1 cup turbinado sugar, and fresh goat milk yogurt & goat milk for the coconut liquids.  Turns out great every time.  An awesomely flavorful dessert solution for our abundant Nubian goat milk flow this spring!

This cheesecake was a hit with my family and friends. Yes even my 9yr old and 5yr old picky eaters couldn't even tell it wasn't a regular cheesecake. I didn't tell anyone it was goat cheese before they ate it and they could tell a slight difference but it was good different.  

My boyfriend is allergic to a lot of foods. Not epi-pen allergic but very sensitive to many: soy, dairy, eggs, peanut butter, gluten, and corn. He likes goat cheese and uses it a lot so I thought I'd try a goat cheese cheesecake because he loves cheesecake. 

I found this recipe and it turned out perfect! I did have to modify it but it still worked out great. I used duck eggs instead of eggs and used a almond meal crust with coconut butter, vanilla, and organic coconut sugar in place of regular sugar. We try to cut back on the sugar. I also used light coconut milk. I made the compote with frozen berries and served with fresh as well. 

I could never make anything like this without a recipe and thank you for making yours availble!

I used a regular graham crust and regular vanilla yoghurt. I added a tbsp of lemon juice and used the inside of two small vanilla beans (bulk barn style),in place of vanilla extract, and a couple drops of lemon flavouring. The lemon juice cuts down the "goat" flavour. Without lemon juice, you can still taste the "goat". Excellent recipe overall and two thumbs up to MATHGOD for trying it in the first place.

Goat cheese is MUCH cheaper (about 50% less) at a warehouse store like Costco.  Thank you for your positive reviews!

This cheesecake was very good and my husband loved it. I would probably only make this for very special occasions because the flavor is very similar to regular New York style cheesecake and the cost is so much more expensive.  Not to mention it was difficult to find cultured coconut milk (only Trader Joe's had it) so it turned into a big project.

Very easy to make but very expensive.  Was excellent. Young grandson didn't even notice it had goat cheese.  Had more of a lemon flavor then I expected. Had to use coconut oil in place of butter due to milk allergy.

This was great. One would never know it wasn't a standard cheesecake. I used light coconut milk and cultured goat milk. I threw some chocolate chips on top. YUM!

This was a delightful recipe! I loved it! I used a nut crust instead of a cookie crust, and followed the rest of the recipe and it was superb! For a family of non-dairy eaters, it was hitting the jackpot! I also have experimented with making it into a pumpkin cheesecake (taking some of the base and adding pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice to it); it worked fine, but the original still is our favorite.

I discovered a severe dairy (casein) allergy a few years ago, and never thought I'd get to enjoy cheesecake again.
I loathe coconut flavor, so I used oat milk, and goats milk Kefir instead of the coconut yogurt.
I also found gluten/dairy free graham crackers that worked great, and used ghee. 
It is imperative to let everything get to room temperature. 
Use the flat beater if you are using your stand mixer, and don't set the speed fast, you are combining, not whipping. I never set mine above 2.
Best of luck. This recipe is fantastic.

I did a regular graham cracker crust and use A2 milk instead of coconut milk. We have a dairy allergy so can't make a cheesecake with cream cheese but you cannot tell the difference with this recipe.

very disappointed. I made this for my mom with a dairy allergy but it was a mess. I've made many dairy cheesecakes in the past and was concerned about the cooking instructions in this recipe.  It was no ways near cooked in the centre, really only the outer edge is edible. Such a waste of time and money.

I'm sure this recipe tastes great but I can't have sugar either.  What type of sweetener would you suggest?  I don't do artificial sweeteners including stevia.

Quite an expensive recipe to make, but it was delicious, and the perfect treat for someone who has lactose and gluten (celiac) issues.  Turned out perfectly, and didn't crack on the top by following these directions.

My family and I liked the goat cheese cheesecake, though I must admit, I still miss the mouthfeel of a cheesecake made with cow dairy.  But, seeing that my grandson cannot have gluten or cow dairy, it was a good alternative.  Alterations:  I made a gluten-free oreo crust and added a bag of lightly crushed, TJ's freeze-dried strawberries to the batter.   It's not too sweet, which we like. My grandson and his family loved it!

I haven’t made this yet, but I desperately want to.  My DH is also sensitive to eggs, so I’d like to know if anyone out there thinks this would work with an egg substitute (like THE NEAT EGG, which is made from chia seeds and garbanzo beans).

Spectacular recipe! 

I have made this as-written and it's grand. 

I've also made it with all coconut sugar, which gives it a richer, more caramel-like flavor that's unique. When I don't have ginger snaps, or don't want the white sugar in them, I make a crust by combining coconut sugar, almond flour, and coconut oil--some people liked this even better. 

In terms of equipment, the stand mixer is the key. I avoid using it but it's worth it in this case!

I make my own chèvre (lucky enough to have a friend with goats) and so I can salt it less than I would for snacking cheese. Instead of using up to 2 tsp per pound, I use 1/2 tsp per pound. But once I made it pretty salty and topped it with chocolate and caramel and it was a hit!

I also add lemon extract as another reviewer suggested, to reduce "goaty" flavors. 

People are licking the plate, seriously! This recipe is a winner.

Oh my goodness!  This was amazing!  I made it for my daughter's birthday.  She had requested something besides a cake. She and I are both Gluten Intolerant so it was a little challenging.  I will definitely make this again.

My family is gluten and dairy intolerant so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  I made a nut crust (although a coconut crust would be awesome).  I did add lemon juice and zest as suggested  by another reviewer.  I used the "cream" portion from canned coconut milk and it added that milk "mouth-feel" to the cheesecake.Everyone loved it.  

Agree with other reviewers,  Costco has the best price for goat cheese.  Next time I'll make goat  milk yogurt and use that instead of coconut milk yogurt.

Full disclosure:  I have not yet made this.  Please be aware that this is going to be one expensive cheesecake.  Chevre goat cheese is about $5 per 4 oz, so 2 pounds is going to cost you in the neighborhood of $40.

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out lovely! The ginger snap crust works wonderful! Making it again for Thanksgiving.
