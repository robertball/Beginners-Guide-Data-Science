So yummy! i went ahead and followed the recipe as is because i read many comments where people had trouble with it and I guess I just wanted to see for myself. I had no problem! They came out really good. You have to be patient letting the first side cook and buble on top so that it doesnt break and splatter before you turn. I had it on medium-low heat and used a margerine stick and passed it thru the pan (use enough) everytime i would put a new one so it wouldnt stick. I also put more bananas as i continued to make (i tasted the first one and wanted more on it)I can't wait to post my pic! The forkwent right thru the spongy pancake. The strawberries just gave it the final touch : )

Absolutely fantastic!  The boyfriend was craving strawberry banana pancakes, and this came through with flying colors.  I love putting the bananas on top and flipping pancake over--the heat releases all the sugars and caramelizes the bananas (although that made it slightly more difficult to get off the griddle).  The tablespoon of sugar seems superfluous--the pancakes were sweetened naturally by the bananas and then the strawberry topping. Might try it without next time.  The 1/2 teaspoon of salt also offset the sweetness--keep it in there!

We found the batter to be really bland, so next time I'm adding cinnamon to the mix. I also found the strawberry topping to be extremely sweet, I added heavy whipping cream and the outcome was awesome. My daughter had a 2nd helping of pancakes (rare) and probably wouldve prefered to drink the syrup straight from the container!

I really like these A LOT. I didn't have buttermilk and pretty much never cook with it. The store only had half gallons so I ended up just using some plain old milk and it tasted great to me and my girlfriend. I pretty much followed the recipe just as it was written otherwise. Some have reported problems with the banana's getting too brown but I didn't find that to be true. I kept the heat around medium and just dropped them in after I put the batter in the pan. For a little extra something I made a little heart with the whip cream and then put the strawberries inside. That was a winner too!

Absolutely delicious!  If you don't have buttermilk on hand, you can mix one tablespoon of lemon juice with the cup of milk and let it sit for 10 minutes before adding it.  I used brown sugar in place of white, and I added some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  I have fond memories of my mother making banana pancakes when I was a child, and I like these even better.  What a brilliant idea to put the banana slices on top of the batter after it is poured--the caramelization is divine.  Will make often for my kids!

The flavor was good with the strawberry 'syrup'. The bananas stuck to the pan pretty bad when cooking.  Next time I will chop them up and add them to the batter.

I thought this recipe is a great base. I added chocolate chips for my kids but followed the recipe for me and my hubby. I used a non-stick griddle but the bananas stuck to it. The next batch, I covered the bananas with batter so they didn't stick and that worked perfectly. I will be making these again.

Great base recipe that I could change up to suit my needs. I had to make a lot of substitutions to cut back on sugar and include whole wheat/flax seed. Thanks for sharing.

This was the best!!! The only thing I DIDN´T do was add whipped cream since I am trying to cut back on calories. The strawberries were great, and so were the pancakes. The only personal change I would make would be to add only a tsp. of vanilla extract in the berry mix, and a sugar substitute. Just trying to watch the cals!!! :) but it is great as is!

100% a keeper, i added cinnomon as i read in 1 of the reviews, used brown flour instead of white for a healthy version, but it was nothing like a crepe it was thick.

We just had breakfast for dinner with these, some bacon and an omelet. We all liked these pancakes, especially my daughter! From trial and error with a couple batches, make sure your banana slices are thick, at least a quarter inch as directed and cook on the 'hard' side so they lift easily from the griddle. The sauce I changed a bit, I thought 3 tsp. of vanilla would be overwhelming so I used just one and it was plenty. I cut back on the sugar a bit too. Fozen mixed berries worked well for this.

It was a  good base recipe, I ended up mashing the banana and mixing it in the batter and adding some more flour to thicken it up.

These were pretty good ... the syrupy berries were a great accompaniment and the pancakes were easy to throw together and on the pan.  Added cinnamon to the batter, but followed the recipe perfectly otherwise.

I thought these were wonderful.  They were light and fluffy and easy to make.  I was about to add mashed bananas to the batter to give it more of the banana flavor but I decided to follow the recipe and found the sliced bananas was all it needed.      Also, as I came across the recipe in the morning, I didn’t have time to do the strawberries.  I just added the chopped strawberries which work out fine for us.  This made a nice little breakfast on a lazy Sunday morning.

I really love this banana pancake recipe.  I actually only use the pancake recipe, I don't use the berry sauce.  I did alter it a bit by adding some extra milk and vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk, turned out great though!  Thanks for the recipe!

These pancakes were excellent! I used 1% milk instead of buttermilk and didn't add the strawberry topping, but I think they might have been the best pancakes I've ever had! I chopped up the bananas and added them to the batter to avoid the sticking problem another review mentioned.

mmm wonderful!  I didn't try it with the berries but I'm sure that would only make it better.  I substituted buttermilk with 1 c milk and 1 T lemon juice.  I cooked over low heat, they cooked really fast!

We absolutely loved these! And my husband actually asked me to make them again! Delicious. We just topped them with syrup, and since I dont have buttermilk just used the substitution from the back of my cookbook.

My husband does not like pancakes, at all!  He and my 4 year old daughter made this for mothers day. He has now decided that if pancakes taste like this, ie: lite, fluffy and mosit he can make this every weekend.  We will be making these again and again.  They are wonderful!!

Great recipe. 
I didn't do the strawberries and they were still great. 
I made a couple changes-used a 2%milk&lemon juice substitute for the buttermilk, whole grain flour, sub apple sauce for the veg oil and added some flax seed meal to make it a lil bit healthier.  Also added a bit of cinnamon. Love the sliced banana on one side!
Will def use this recipe again.

Very YUMMY! 
I was out of milk and didn't have any buttermilk - so I used plain yogurt (and watered it down to a buttermilk consistency)
They were so fluffy and I loved how the bananas are fried on one side.
DELICIOUS!

I substituted skim milk for the buttermilk and they still turned out just fine.  Great flavour and really good with maple syrup as well.

Delish!  My mistake was halving the recipe - it only made 4 pancakes (this mighth of been a good thing cas I would be stuffed and not merely full).  I skipped the strawberry topping but I did add a smattering of frozen mini-organic blueberries along with the bananas (husbands idea).  Awesome!  Just served them with whipped cream.  I liked how the batter made thinner pancakes as I'm not a fan of the thick ones.  I made my own buttermilk by adding 1 T. of apple cider vinegar to the 1 c. milk and letting it stand for 5 minutes.  This is definiting a keeper of a recipe!!!

Wonderful Recipe!!  The pancakes were delicious - I'd use this recipe even if I didn't have any bananas.  I didn't have enough vanilla for both the pancakes and the strawberries, so I used almond on the strawberries.  It was a little strong, I'll use less next time.  Absolutely, a wonderful recipe that I will definately make again!

really super yummy. I did not masticate my strawberries overnight but an hour was sufficient enough to make them absolutely delicious! I don't cook at all and I was able to make this recipe with no problems.

Yuuummy fluffy pancakes!  The 'coating the banana slices in batter to prevent sticking' tip was great.  I also used the vinegar/milk buttermilk substitute, and it worked just fine.  I drizzled honey on my pancakes because we didn't have strawberries or whipped cream on hand.  Will make again!

Great fluffy pancakes, the fluffiest I've ever made. But a little bit bitter. 
I don't know what's wrong (maybe coz it because i use 1and1/2 tsp baking powder instead of baking soda).
Though the banana help, my family didn't really enjoy it nonetheless.

The pancake batter alone is enough for 5 stars, but adding the bananas and berries is wonderful!  I made a double batch and made half with bananas and half without (because my sister is an avid banana hater) But even she-being the food critic that she is- was enthused about how great the pancakes tasted.

Super light and fluffy! I used real maple syrup instead of sugar. Didn't add the vanilla, but did add a little cinnamon for batter and 1/2 cup spelt flour for part of white. I also used olive oil instead of vegie oil(I also doubled the recipe).
Will make again...

These are tender pancakes, and a bit crepe-like.  Wonderful! They were a hit with my family, too, so this will be our usual pancake recipe now I think.  They were plenty nice without the strawberries, just with butter and syrup.

I substituted apple sauce for the oil, and they still tasted great!

Incredible pancakes.  I added a bit of cinnamon to the batter to add a little spice.  I will use eated boxed pancake mix again!
