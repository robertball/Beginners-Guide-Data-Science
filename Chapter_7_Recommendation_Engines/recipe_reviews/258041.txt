This was unique and excellent and the perfect what I call bar food! This will be a big hit to anyone that likes onion rings. The only change I had to make is that I had to add some milk to my Velveeta mixture to get it to thin down enough to pour. This recipe takes a little bit of time but is worth every bit of the effort. I promise you won't be disappointed.

This was great! I used a top round (it was on sale), fresh jalapenos (personal preference), and added sour cream.  I think this could easily be adapted to meatless, if you're vegetarian or just trying to reduce the amount of meat in your diet. The steak was good, but nothing that wouldn't also have been great with seasoned mushroom slices.
