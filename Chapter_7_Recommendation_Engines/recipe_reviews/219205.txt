My grandmother always made this for lunch, and I kept on the tradition. It's best to make it in the morning and refrigerate it for lunch. Add a little bit of mayonnaise to keep it together.

Not bad for a simple, healthy carrot salad if you are wanting to omit the mayo that usually binds everything together.

I used to make this when my now grown daughters were young. I don’t know why I stopped because it is deliciously refreshing. I’m including it on my DH’s birthday menu tonight.
