We call these tortizzas and make them all the time! The key is to cook the tortilla for a bit until it starts to crisp before adding the toppings. I also finish it by placing my cast iron skillet under the broiler to brown the cheese. Delicious!!!

This is my new favorite recipe!!!!  It was outstanding!  Simple, not many ingredients and so yummy.....my kind of recipe.  I did add some leftover deli Tavern Ham (shredded) for my meat loving hubby.  Which, by the way, went at this very cautiously when he first put his fork into it, but once tasting it he declared he could eat the whole thing himself (hint-hint)!  Thanks to 'themoodyfoodie' for submitting this easy, but fun recipe to make.

Great recipe, I cook it a little longer before adding toppings and finish in the oven. One review called this a "tortizza".  That is not correct. Tortiizzas use a tortilla for the crust.

I topped it with sun-dried tomatoes (packed in oil) and pepperoni. No additional fresh mozzarella but I can see how that would add even more oomph. From this girl who needs to be on a keto diet for health reasons, THANK YOU.

This recipe was perfect! Will make this again and again! Thanks for posting such a quick, easy and healthy (low carb, high protein, gluten and grain free) recipe. Can't say enough about it! 

Ate it with a knife and fork, as crust was delicate, but isn't that how it's sometimes done in Italy?

I was skeptical a cheese crust could hold up to the toppings I prefer. IT DID! Super easy and is great with dollops of sauce, mushrooms, sausage and black olives. I like my mozzarella cheese crispy as it is so I let mine cook a little longer. SO GOOD!

Have to admit that I like a thin yeasty crust for a satisfying pizza experience but if you can’t eat wheat this is a great alternative. I made it with Oaxaca cheese, basil, oregano and tomato from my garden and a sprinkle of pecorino. Very yummy. On the next one I used fresh Pico de Gallo and rolled it up and sliced into pinwheels for an excellent appetizer.

My husband is on Keto diet and he loved it!  Now he can have a Keto-friendly substitute for pizza.   I used tomato and turkey pepperoni for the toppings.

Wow! We were skeptical as well, but loved it. We added different toppings depending on taste...turkey pepperoni, green onion, basil, sliced toms, sliced zucchini. What a marvelously quick dinner!

I was a little skeptical of this recipe, just because I had never made anything like this. It was a easy recipe to follow, but using the cheese as the crust I was a little leery; However, it was absolutely yummy!

Loved it!  So easy to make. One thing I will do differently the next time would not let the crust cook as much. I found as it was cooling down it got very crisp. Although my husband loved the crispiness I would have preferred it a bit softer. So, so good and flavorful!

I followed the directions and even let the cheese cook longer than suggested but at the end it looked like the cheese and toppings slid off the (nonexistent) crust.
