My little niece wanted to hold a tea party so I brought this with scones. Very enjoyable! I pressed the raspberries through a sieve first so there would be no seeds.

Sweet & yummy!  Served this with my blueberry scones and it was such a nice combination. It couldn't have been any easier and it added such a festive look to the brunch table. I think it would be delish on bagels,toast,waffles, pancakes..... etc too! I will be making this for special occasions. Thanks so much for sharing tahoegirl!
