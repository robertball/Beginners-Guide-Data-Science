I liked the simplicity of making this dish in one pan, but, the flavor fell through.    It was very bland and definitely needed more seasoning on both the chicken breading and on the vegetables.   The chicken was tender and the vegetables were perfectly cooked, but, if you make I would definitely recommend adding salt and more seasoning to your taste.

Made this last night and we really liked it.  The chicken was nice and moist and we thought it had lots of good flavors. After reading how many felt it lacked flavor I just made a minor change.  I added dry oregano and thyme to the onions and potatoes before adding any stock. And, since my husband is not a fan of lemon I only used half the amount.  I used boneless chicken breasts and followed the directions for that regarding timing etc. however, my vegetables were cut to the size of the original  recipe and that was a mistake.  Next time I will cut them into smaller bite size pieces so they finish the same time as the chicken.  I might also, put some bread crumbs on the chicken for a bit more crust.  Very easy and will definitely make again.

The recipe itself was easy enough to make.  But there was a lot of flavor missing and I had added salt and garlic.

Used bone-in chicken thighs and a large yellow onion. Added extra season salt, paprika, onion powder and garlic powder. The lemon juice is perfect.

Only changes I made were by accident.  I forgot the lemon juice, and thyme, oh, yes, I added salt after reading the other comments.  Yum.  Really, really enjoyed this!

I I added, extra spices. Fresh chopped garlic;  the onions should be sliced, not quartered.  It took at least 10 minutes to brown the onions If cut in thick slices, it would jave taken less tiime.  

It was delicious!  My husband loved it  also;
{ but it took a long time to prepare  )

This was a very nice way to cook the chicken and vegetables in one pot. I took the advice of other reviewers and extra spice. Since i dod not have fresh herbs I added lemon pepper to both the breading of the chicken and to the vegetables amd broth. Gave the recipe a really nice flavor.

This was an ok recipe but to be 5 stars needs some help.  It is lacking in seasoning and is very bland.  I though the lemon overpowered the vegetables and I would cut back on that next time.

Definitely needs more seasoning (salt, pepper, some fresh garlic or onion powder - something!) Still pretty good though, just a little bland. I used skin-on, bone-in thighs, and otherwise followed the recipe to a "T". True comfort food.

This was very good! It does need salt, but otherwise delicious as written. I used boneless skinless breasts and followed the directions in the footnote section.

This was delicious.  Loved the little taste of lemon in this.  Very easy to make, just prep and into the oven it goes.  Used thighs instead of breasts as this is what we prefer.  Added a touch of salt but otherwise no changes.  Sprinkled with a few chives for decoration
