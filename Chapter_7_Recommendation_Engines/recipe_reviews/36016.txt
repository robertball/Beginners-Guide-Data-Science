Absolutely stunning.  I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. I made extra but found that it is better eaten on the day it is made as it doesn't taste as good when re-heated.

Thanks for the great recipe!  Very unique flavors that I will definitely be experimenting with.  My girlfriend loved it and she has HATED lamb every other time she's had it.  Now, here are the changes and additions I made to the recipe, I added about a 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper after I browned the shanks and about 1 tbsp. of sugar to the tomatoe puree to counter some of the acidity. I eliminated 1 cup of the tomatoe puree and 1 cup of chicken stock and substituted 2 cups of red wine instead:)  After the braising, instead of turning up the oven to 400-degrees, I placed the rack high on my oven and turned it on broil.  I brushed on the glaze and broiled with a very watchful eye to prevent burning.  I made a cilantro oil (bunch of cilantro, olive oil, salt & pepper blended in a food processor) which complimented the glaze awesomely!! I brushed on some cilantro oil during the broiling process too and it made the world of difference (Flavor town baby!). I served it on a bed of Creamy Cotija cheese and Chive Polenta, drizzled with some fresh cilantro oil.  Didn't plate the braising liquid becuase I found it unnecessary.

This was absolutely outstanding! I made the dish for a dinner party last night and the guests  enjoyed it so much that one of them - a professional chef -  actually licked his plate! I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding trhe jiuce of an orange as well as zest to the glaze, becuase I wanted something a little sharper. I hadn't intended to make the yoghurt dressing, but I'm glad I did - it added a lovely cool contrast to the  smoky juiciness of the lamb. This is an amaziong recipe - thank you so much for sharing it. if I could give it six stars, I would!

I made this dish for my husband, who is a retired chef, and he LOVED it! I couldn't find the dried anchos so I substituded fresh chili peppers and added ancho powder and it was delicious! This was a very easy dish to make (it took time to cook but no time at all to put together). It was sweet and 'hot' at the same time...but not overwhelmingly so...evne my 83 y.o. mother in law loved it! 
I doubled the honey glaze and used it on chicken wings the next day...equally delicious!

Excellent. We didn't have ancho chilis either, just use whatever you enjoy.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this recipe. Followed the directions exactly as written; the lamb was cooked perfectly, however, it was the combination of flavors that disappointed. The orange did not blend well with the ancho chile's and the crust did not firm up as promised. My husband thought the tomato sauce was unnecessary and did not feel it enhanced the flavor of the lamb. Will use the cooking method again as the lamb was moist and flavorful, but I'll try it with another combination of flavors.

This recipe is absolutely sensational - the combination of the dried ancho chillies - a very subtle smoky flavour, mild not hot - with the honey glaze is just amazing!!! Can I say to people that used red chillies, you have not exp-erienced what this recipe is all about. Here, in Australia, it is not very easy to find ancho chillies, I got some by chance interstate, and have now located a source in Melbourne. I'm sure you will find it a lot easier to get these if you live in the US.
Thank you so much - a terrific recipe!

I made this lamb dish today, and I must say it was very tasty. The yogurt I thought was a bit iffy on but once I ate some with the lamb it was perfect. My boyfriend loved it. He kept raving about how great a cook I am (but I already knew that:D) The only thing I did was add more garlic and ancho chiles don't add heat like a jalapeno would they add a smoky flavor. I served this dish with mash potatoes.

Could not find any Ancho Chillies in this City, so substituted with ordinary sundried chillies. Works terrific. However, I doubled the amount of chillis for that little extra kick.

Excellent dish.  Those saying that orange and ancho don't go together are mad.  Red chilies or any other kind of chilies are no substitute for the smoky taste of ancho.  I had just 2 smallish shanks but kept most of the other proportions anyway except just a couple cups of diced tomatoes and slightly less honey. Wound up with more tomato mixture and more glaze than needed but it was fine.  I added a few dried lemon peel chunks to the tomato baking marinade.  Lacking a dutch oven or a ceramic baking pot, I roasted it all in a normal pan covered tightly with foil.

Bad combination of flavors.  At least the lamb shanks were cooked perfectly and were very tender, but the combination of ancho chile with honey doesn't work for me.  Very strange result.

Made this meal for a dinner party of 6 - and it was fantastic! Very easy to prepare and quite delicious. The aromatic yoghurt mix was in wonderful contrast to the sweet glaze! Served with mashed potato, it was a real treat - thanks!

I loved the end result of this recipe.  I substituted parlsey for the cilantro in the yogurt topping (I'm one of those who taste dish soap so I miss out on cilantro's tasty goodness) and it tasted pretty darn good.  I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor play of the ancho chiles in the base and glaze.

This recipe was a most delightful surprise.  It is worth every minute spent on preparation, which is done before your guests arrive, and one that can be served with confidence.

I felt that there was too much tomato sauce for the number of lamb shanks.  Otherwise the flavors were Excellent!!!!

My boyfriend absolutely loved it! It took some time, but is really worth it. And I used the leftover chile-honey glaze on my veggie burger. I make it on its own.
