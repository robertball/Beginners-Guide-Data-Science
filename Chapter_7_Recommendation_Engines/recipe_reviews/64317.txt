All I could taste was the cream cheese and the sourness of the buttermilk. Will not be making this again. I even tried adding vanilla and more sugar after tasting it. I wouldn't even know where to begin fixing it. I'd definitely find a better cheesecake ice cream base and then add the boysenberries and graham cracker crust.

This recipe is soooo simple! It has less fat and sugar than another recipe I was considering and I am so glad I chose this one. It blends up fast and has just the right amount of cheesecake zing. It was more than my 1.5 qt ice cream maker could handle but it was no problem I put it back in the refregerator to freeze the next day. The ice cream is creamy and rich. Next time I will try it with raspberrry preserves.
