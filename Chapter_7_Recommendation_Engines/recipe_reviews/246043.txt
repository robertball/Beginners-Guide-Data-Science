This turned out great!  When I got home from the store I discovered that I had less barley than I thought, so I supplemented with some wild rice and orzo pasta (pasta added last 8 mins) instead.  I also doubled the bacon as it was our main dish that night.  So it was great.  Next time I would add more water than I had thought I needed the first time I made it.
