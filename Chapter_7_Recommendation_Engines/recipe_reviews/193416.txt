The flavor on this cake was not good AT ALL. And I followed the recipe exactly to directions.  The sour cream makes it too sour.  Maybe sweeter, more ripe bananas would fix this problem.  But I was not impressed.

I love to bake cookies, but have never tried a cake before.  It was super easy to make, especially for me since I'm somewhat challenged in the kitchen.  I brought it to a family function and everyone loved it--even the people who don't usually enjoy sweets!

This is a fabulous recipe that is very versatile.  I have made it exactly as specified and it turned out great.  I've played around with it and found I like it even better.  I usually add some extract of some sort: vanilla, coconut, even amaretto.  Sometimes I use plain yogurt or vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream, also quite scrumptious.  But best of... You MUST DO THIS next time you make this cake.... Stab it all over with a fork and splash about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of hazelnut syrup (the kind you find at dollar tree for coffee) all over the top of the cake before frosting.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......

I skipped the frosting part and actually threw the chopped walnuts into the banana cake mixture. I made this into two loaves, larger in size. These took just over an hour covering halfway with foil to keep the tops from burning. It's moist and darn tasty as is, I can't fathom the deliciousness with the frosting. Next time I'll make it with. As loaves, it's pretty righteous, too.
