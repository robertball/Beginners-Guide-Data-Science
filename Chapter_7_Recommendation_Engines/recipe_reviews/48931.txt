This is a very good recipe. The second time I made it, I made some changes that my entire family thought produced excellent results. I browned the Roast. Remove. Add 3 cloves of minced garlic to the onions at the beginning. Before placing the roast on the onions, I turned up the heat and deglazed the stock pot with Merlot, scraping up any brown bits. I placed the roast on the mixture to cook until done. After transferring the roast to a warm plate and tenting it with foil, I added another 1/2 cup Merlot to the pot and let it reduce by half, adding a Teaspoon of dried thyme. I then added 3/4 cup low sodium beef broth, brought it to a boil then added approximately 2 Tablespoons of roux to thicken. Pour over sliced roast. The leftovers were devoured for breakfast the next morning! Give it a try!

This is a very good recipe as it is.  It was intended for busy moms.  Making a whole bunch of changes just makes it take longer to make, not to mention a totally differant recipe.  Why do people insist on doing that.  Post your own recipies people.  I want to know what it was like as written, not your version of pot roast.

I made this in my crock pot.  Cooked on high for 1st hour then on low for 3 hours.  I took some of the other peoples suggestions and did the following:  using a 3 pound roast - only 2 medium onions, cider vinegar, added 2 garlic cloves and some leftover fresh mushrooms.  I rolled the roast in a misture of rosemary, ground black pepper and a little garlic powder first, then browned on all sides in a little olive oil in a iron skillet first, turned over once while cooking.  When roast was done I took it out and added 2 TBSP flour to about 1 1/2 cups water (put in tupperware container and shook up first)then added to gravy on high, stirring occasionally, also added a beef bouillion cube for flavor (it was a little bland before adding this).  I broke up the meat and added back to crock pot once gravy was ready and served with mashed potatoes.  It was very yummy, not dry at all, and my whole (very picky) family loved it!!!!!
I will make this again.

Excellent recipe.  I used a dutch oven with lid in oven @ 300 degrees for 4 hours left if covered the entire time.  The onions were a beautiful amber color which made an excellent gravy base.

I appreciate Susan for submitting this recipe. She did say that, “This is the easiest roast recipe and requires little work.” I agree with that assessment. The instructions were clear and to the point. 


I had an occasion to try this recipe as a belated birthday dinner. The end result was good. It was tender and the beef had a mild bay leaf onion flavor. 


For this recipe I used a seven pound plus hunk of bottom Round (tied) and eleven onions as recommended by the “Scaling and conversion” feature of this site. Vinegar? I still don’t know what part it plays in this recipe.

All in all I was impressed with the taste of the beef. It wasn’t  dried out or tasted like cardboard.


Because of the end result I decided to omit the all-purpose flour and water. I had more liquid than I expected. I tasted the liquid and I was a little disappointed.  In my opinion, it was a weak onion broth.  It was bland and needed help.  

I made a Roué and incorporated the liquid to make a medium sauce and added bullion and a few others ingredients to give it some taste. I didn’t have a blender handy or I would have taken the onions and processed them to add as a thickening agent and to add flavor.

My over all impression of this recipe is good and my comments are; you may want to add herbs to improve the taste of the broth. The herbs when added at the beginning of the cooking process will infuse the roast nicely with whatever you decide to add.

This was really good, with dark, rich gravy.  I had to make some adjustments, though.  I put a tiny bit of oil under the onions, and after the meat had browned good on all sides to make the "brown bits", I added at least 2 cups of water for the roast to simmer in. Since it's a bottom round, I wanted to be sure it was tender.

Bottom round is so lean it is not easy to have a roast that is not dry and tasteless, but this was delicious.  So was the gravy!  I browned the roast on all sides first.  I also used cider vinegar and added an extra 1/3 cup of water when I added the vinegar and bay leaf. My husband loved it.

Holy Moly I love this recipe!
So does my husband - this was the first roast recipe he told me I must do again.  I modified it a bit, partly on accident.  I put one cup of water, with apple cider vinegar and put the roast on top. I also only used one large sweet onion.  My extra addition that makes the gravy especially good is a couple whole sprigs of fresh rosemary (I remove when done and strain out anything big).  I puree the onions in the water to make gravy, just added a little salt and thickener (flour or cornstarch). Afterwards I have one very happy husband :)

I used 2 onions, 3 tbls balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, salt, pepper for a 2 lb roast in a crockpot on high for 5 hours.  I made the gravy using 2 tbls flour because of extra liquid.  I sliced the beef, layered the onions over it, and spooned the gravy over it all. We ate it with rice but my family would love to try it again over egg noodles.

So here is my take on the people who get upset because others change a posted recipe...I went looking for a recipe for a bottom round roast that I bought on sale and wasn't sure what to do with. This one caught my eye because I like onions. I read it and then immediately went to the reviews to see if anyone had done it in a crock pot because that's how I wanted to cook mine.  As I was reading the original recipe I was already thinking; "add wine because I have some, add herbs de provence because I love them, garlic because I put it in everything....that's what we all do.  I appreciate Susan for the recipe and appreciate others just as much for offering alternate suggestions that I can TAKE or LEAVE. This ia a very good recipe just as is but feel free to make it "yours".

This was fantastic (especially the gravy).  The onions cooked down to give a it a nice, subtle sweetness that was OH so delicious.  I used a  2-lb. roast and cooked it stovetop in a Dutch oven.  First, I browned the meat on all sides in olive oil, then added to the pot: 3 sliced onions, about a 1/2 cup red wine, 1/2 Tbsp. lemon juice, 2 bay leaves, and a generous amount of salt/pepper.  No vinegar (but the red wine and lemon juice made up for it).  I can't do a pot roast without red wine-- it just doesn't seem right (haha).  I simmered the roast on low for about 3.5 hours, then made the gravy.  I used 1 cup of beef broth in place of water, and about 2 Tbsp. flour to get it to the right consistency.  YUM!

Wow! This is how I will always make bottom round from now on. I did modify it some though. I did use a little canola oil and sear (brown on all sides)the roast first. I only had 4 onions, I added a couple cloves of garlic, as suggested by another reviewer I used balsamic vinegar, and I also added some rosemary and thyme. The gravy was fantastic, and the meat was so tender!  Update: I have made this several times now, and everyone always raves over how tender and tasty it turns out. I've used several types of vinegar, but think that either balsamic or red wine vinegar works best. I have used anywhere from 3 to 5 onions - the more onions the more liquid you get.  Sometimes I thicken the gravy, and sometimes I serve it au jus.

Not being an onion family, I made some changes... I put 2 sliced onions, 1 package sliced mushrooms (approx 12 'shrooms) & a garlic clove in the pot. I seasoned the meat by putting 1 tsp each of peppercorns, kosher salt rosemary & coriander seeds & a clove of garlic in my mincer. I put the chopped herbs on a piece of wax paper, rolled the meat around it, and then cooked the meat as directed. FABULOUS!!! (I doubled the gravy mixture too)

Very GOOD! I usually make a pot roast in the pressure cooker with this type of meat but when I stumbled accross this recipe I was ready to try something new. I rubbed salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic to the meat then browned it in the dutch oven- I then removed it, deglazed the pan with a little red wine then put in the onions, bay leaf and some sliced garlic. We love Balsamic vinegar so I add 3 tablespoons. I was so nervous because I didn't think there was enough liquid in the dutch oven- But it came out great!! I had a 3 pound roast and cooked it for 3 hours- kept the lid on the whole time. The meat was so tender- even more so then when I do it in the pressure cooker! I put the onion mixture in the food processor until smooth. It made a nice gravy without adding the flour. I served with some mashed potatoes. This is an excellent recipe, will use it from now on- THANK YOU!!

I am a cancer patient going thru chemo and this was delicious! My taste buds do not like much but they liked this. I am making it again.  So easy so my limited energy was able to manage it. I added garlic and only 4 onions because that is all I had in the house.

More than a 5 star but I did follow other reviewers changes.  I did sear the meat, added merlot wine to deglaze the pan and then added another cup of wine before starting to simmer.  At the end I just mixed 3 teaspoons of corn starch into 3 tablespoons of cold water and then added it to the onions and wine mixture to thicken.  I also added some thyme leaves while it cooked.  Thanks submtiter - best pot roast I've ever had.

I cooked it in a slow cooker.  My mistake was I put the frozen roast in it and turned it to high setting......roast was still tough when we were ready to eat. So I left it ovenight in low settings. It needed more flavor so I added a jar of muchroom gravy and it came out good.  I think I will try it again.

I only needed one HUGE onion. That was enough on it's own. Instead of water, I used 1/4 burgundy wine to deglaze the pan and 3/4 c. beef broth. I also used one beef bouillion cube. I always sear roasts before I cook them, it's something I learned from my father in law that I just do automatically. On the top of the roast, I rubbed in some salt and pepper and minced garlic. I plan on serving this with Montreal Steak Seasoned Mashed Potatoes and steamed broccoli. I can't wait to see how it turns out. EDITED: Making this with the red wine and beef broth was genius. So yum. It was a bit salty, if I were to make this again(and I will), I'd cut back on the salt on the meat. This meat and gravy was so wonderful. EDITED AGAIN: This is even better the next day!

This was a just as advertised for me (I didn't have any problems with it being dry or too tangy). I used my enameled cast iron Dutch oven and started this on the stove top with lid on. Layered with onions then seasoned meat on top, tried rice-wine vinegar. After about 90 minutes on stove top & reading more reviews on here, I decided to add some sprigs of fresh rosemary & a small baggie of peeled baby carrots - also wanted to check to see how much liquid was in there, and there was plenty just from the onions & meat. Then I put it in the oven at 300 for another 2-3 hours until it was browned on top & onions had melted down & meat was tender (I did not brown/sear the meat first as I had no time with little rugrats at my sides). I then pulled the meat out & put in a large serving bowl instead of platter & scooped up all the onions & carrots into the bowl & let it all rest together while I prepared the gravy from the bits on the bottom of the pan. I really think that all the juices from the veggies kept the meat moist so I was glad I used a bowl instead of a platter in this case. I added only a few shakes of garlic powder & a TBSP or 2 of soy sauce to the gravy along with the water & flour. The gravy was awesome, and it all turned out great! Easy & makes lots of left overs. It's a keeper for sure!

I rarely make roasts, so I looked at the cut of meat, and typed bottom round roast and came up with this recipe. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again. The onions and the gravy really make this dish stand out and it's so amazingly easy to make!

This recipe was tasty and very easy.  The vinegar gives the gravy a nice little tangy flavor.  I used a 2 lb. roast, so I used 2 onions instead, and only had to cook it about 2 hours.  My husband liked it so I'll likely make it again sometime.

The recipe deserves 5 stars as written, for flavor, moistness, and ease.  For personal preference, we made a few adjustments.  We browned the meat first.  We used 2 humongous white onions and 4 cloves of garlic and added a cup of beef broth.  We chose to use red wine vinegar.  After we got everything simmering in a Dutch oven, we covered and put it in a preheated 300 degree oven for 4 hours.  We used beef broth in place of water to make the gravy.  It was delicious and even more so the next day.

I read the reviews and was very tempted to try this recipe, based on the simplicity alone.  It was perfect! I can't imagine anything easier and the meat was cooked to perfection.  Just be sure you control your urge to open the door and you will be fine. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the easiest, tastiest meal to make. I work from home and I love being able to put this on to cook and smell it simmering away. My husband loves onions so its one of his favorites. I've never had much luck with making gravy, but this is a breeze. Definitely one of my favorites.

I almost passed this recipe up after reading some of the reviews.  Glad I tried it because it turned out great.  I cooked the roast just as the recipe suggested, and it is true... lifting the lid to check the progress during cooking only lengthened my cooking time...darnit.  Reading others' suggestions, I added extra herbs/spices (Season Salt in place of salt, Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, Cavender's Greek, a pinch or two of Thyme, and two whole peeled cloves of garlic).  I decreased the onions to 3 instead of 6, and substituted Beef Broth for the water... great results.  The roast was tender and juicy, and the onion gravy was to die for.  Husband and kids ate it ALL up.

An absolute must make and cant wait to make again!!! We love onions and this just made the most awesome gravy in the world!!! The only thing I did different is my roast was 2 pounds, I used only 3 onions, added a beef boillon cube and a little water the other ingrediants I kept as is. Also I didnt have a dutch oven so in a deep sauce pan I let cook for about an hr then it just sat for several hours then finished cooking about another hour before dinner. so moist and melt in mouth.  Just WOW! Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!!!!

I had my doubts about this recipe - I'm so used to flouring and browning a roast first, and adding at least some water in with the roast - so this just looked too easy!  However, it turned out great!   It made LOTS of gravy, very very oniony, which is the reason that I gave it only 4 stars, but that is a matter of personal preference.   I had a 3.35 pound bottom round roast and it took all of 4 hours to get tender, I did open the lid once to turn it over.    Thanks for sharing this!

Nice recipe! This was my first roast to make and it was very easy and flavorful (though needed more salt). I had a smaller roast too (2.7 lbs) and I cooked it for less than 2 hours and it was too done, so next time I will cut down the cooking time to an hour or just over.

I followed the recipe exactly and my roast turned out perfect. The onion gravy was spot on and the roast tender and juicy.Everybody loved it. I had to hide the leftovers in the back of the fridge so I can make a hot roast beef sandwich with the little bit that was leftover from dinner last night. My family wants to know when we can have it again. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.-Andrea

Came out great.   Per some other reviews: Seared the meat before putting in pot.  Only had 1 large onion on hand which worked fine.   Added a couple cloves of garlic and sprinkled a tad of garlic powder in addition to salt & pepper.  Also added about 1/2 cup beef broth to pot with the vinegar.  My 5.44 lb roast was done to perfection in 3 hours.   I admit to peeking 2 times.   For gravy I blended the onions until smooth and used 2tbsp flour (for thicker) and 1/2 broth 1/2 water for liquid (more flavor).   It was very tasty....next time I may try with red wine like others have suggested.    Served with new potatoes and it was a great meal.  My kids ate up the meat no complaints.

Thie recipe was great. I read most of the other reviews first and did make some changes. I browned the roast first, deglazed with Merlot, added garlic and also added more Merlot & some Beef Broth at the end. Try not to lift the lid during cooking.

I made a 2 lb roast using one large onion,  1 sm bay leaf, l tbl vinegar, and 1/2 cup water with beef bullion added. 

Based on the recipe guidelines, I thought I'd cook it 1.5 hours, but on the "2" setting on my stove, it was a bit overdone when I checked it at 1 hour and five minutes.

The onions did not carmelize; next time I think I'll try 1/4 c water.

Despite these issues, the roast was flavorful and my husband really liked it. With further adjustments, this will be great.

My husband found this recipe and first made it in a Corning Ware casserole in the oven at 350 for 2 hours.  It was tender and delicious but we felt that we should try it on the stove top as written, so we tried it at a family gathering on an electric stove.  As recommended we didn't open the pot until after about 1.5 hours when we could smell the onions burning.  They were a total loss and the roast was edible but tasted a bit burnt.  Today I tried it at home using my electric skillet which can be set to "simmer".  I didn't peek until after 2.5 hours and found the onions totally blackened once again.  With only 1 T of liquid I can't imagine how it can be otherwise.  We know it has potential because the first time was a great success.  I'm looking forward to trying it in the oven again but in the old cast iron dutch oven, but first I will try it in the slow cooker, as other posters suggested, and see how it comes out.  If we don't make any other changes I think it will still count as the same recipe.

Like many "pot" roast recipes, this one works very well in a crockpot. I threw in some red wine and garlic at the start and later added some quartered fresh baby bella mushrooms. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and the roast was falling apart when done, but remained moist, tender and delicious.

Excellent - my husband loved it and it tasted like the pot roasts my mom used to make.  I also browned roast first and used Mrs. Dash herb seasoning and a little Worcester sauce.  Also added chopped garlic with the onions.   I can't believe you don't need to add any additional liquid during the 4 hr cooking but it turned out perfect - juicy and tasty. I steamed carrots and threw them in with the broth for about 15 minutes.  Gravy was wonderful.

This is excellent!  I was a little worried about the onions carmalizing.  After I got it simmering and put the lid on, they were still raw looking and it really smelled of vinegar.  But my lid wasn't on tight, the liquid went out and voila! carmalized onions.  I added a little water and it became the nice dark color it should be.  Next time I'll leave it on high till the onions are carmalized, probably what I should have done the first time!!

Making this recipe right now for what will be my third time. The first time I read the recipe wrong and put the 1 cup water in at the beginning of cooking time, but the roast turned out perfectly tender anyway (and I had put it in while it was still a bit frozen, too!) and onions were perfectly caramelized and flavourful. My husband raved and said it was almost as good as his mother's roast! Still had to add another cup of water to make gravy as liquid was almost all gone after cooking, and I added a bit of Bisto for more flavour. The second time I followed the recipe properly and all the onions and the bottom of the roast burned as there was hardly any liquid in it from the start. Nothing could be salvaged to make a gravy with and it took over an hour of soaking and scrubbing to get my pot back to normal. Luckily I had a packet of gravy mix on hand to use instead, and the meat still tasted fine. This third time I am putting the water in at the beginning again to avoid another burning catastrophe. Other than the liquid issue, which is why I haven't given it a full 5 stars, it's a fantastic recipe and the only one I have used since discovering it. Also, while cooking, it gives off the best smell ever to come out of my kitchen (then again, I've always loved the smell of onions). Especially comforting on cold, snowy days.

Very yummy recipe! I've added garlic powder to the meat, and seared it in cast iron chicken fryer.
After searing and sealing all the juices inside, I followed the recipe, by placing onions on the bottom of pan, roast on top, vinegar and bay leaf, and I covered it for a couple of hours, and made the gravy, and it was delicious, thank you

Thanks so much for this exceptional and easy recipe!! The only thing I did differently was to brown the roast on all sides in a little oil before removing it and sweating the onions and some minced garlic. I then put the roast back into my enamelled cast iron dutch oven, covered it, and stuck it in a 400-degree oven till it was done (about three hours). Moist, flavorful, and tender and delicious served with roasted potato and sweet potato wedges and steamed veggies.....everyone loved it!

Just made this recipe and it is wonderful with my adaptations.  I trimmed the fat from the meat. I added salt and course cracked pepper and browned the meat on all sides in 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil.  I used 3 onions, 3 cloves of garlic, sliced.  I added 1/2 cup water with 2 tsp. bouillon to the meat while cooking.  I only had to cook the meat for 1 hour 5 minutes, checked the temp with a thermometer and it was already 150 degrees.  To make gravy I only used 1/4 cup water with the tablespoon of flour.  I had lots of beef broth and onions.  I took a potato masher and pressed the onions and garlic to thicken the gravy too.  My husband loved it.  I don't recommend any additional herbs, you taste the meat and onions, you don't need any other flavors.  Instead of 3-4 hours, my roast was ready to serve in 1 hour and 20 minutes.  The browning of the meat really cut down on the cooking time.  It was done and tender.

Delicious and tender!! I browned the 3.49lb bottom round roast.  After browning I added not only the onions and bay leaf but 1 celery stalk, 1 extra large garlic clove and balsamic marinade oppose to just white vinegar.  I cooked it for 3 hours since it was less than 4lbs.  Thanks!

This was pretty good!  I only used 5 onions, and used red wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar.  I used a traditional cast iron dutch oven which made all the difference. The gravy turned out dark brown, not light like in the picture, but it was very flavorful.  My husband thought it tasted like a great homemade German dish.  Served it over egg noddles and a side of asparagus.

This is so easy and tasty! The only thing we change each time we make it is we use less onion. I use one or two red onions. We love it every time.

This may easily become mine and my husbands favorite way to cook a roast from now on. We were surprised and then very happy with the strong flavors and the richness of the onion gravy. It was an excellant meal along with mashed garlic potatoes and fried spinach.

I love this!  Whenever we want something low-carb and easy, we just put this on.  I was actually amazed that it was so good.  I omit the final step with the flour.  I find that the caramelized onions and juice make a decent gravy substitute, and since I'm avoiding bread, potatoes, etc., I have no use for a thicker gravy anyway.

My family and I loved this roast. It was moist, falling apart just enought to soak up the juices. I did take a few suggestions from others:  I only had a 2 1/2 # Bottom Roast and I cooked it in a crock pot on high for 5 hours.
I followed the directions using only 3 onions (due to the smaller roast) and added some italian seasonings, some minced garlic  and one cup of beef broth for gravy.  I will def make this again and again. I served it with roasted potatoes and a salad. My teenager put the leftovers on a roll for lunch the next day!

Delicious. I bRowned the meat first, placed it to the side. Placed onions, mushrooms, garlic and red wine vinegar into the pan with salt and pepper. After 10 minutes added the bay leaf and beef broth (1 cup) brought to simmer. Added to a crock pot and placed the beef on top. Let it cook on high for hour, then low for 3more hours. Turned out delicious, not dry at all

After 4 hours at low, the onions were still hard and the roast wasn't done.  I now have the sucker in the microwave cooking. I should have just cooked it in the crock pot like I always do:  Throw the roast in, put a quartered onion and some garlic on top, sprinkle with powdered onion and beef broths, add a bay leaf, and cook it on low 6 to 8 hours.  We would be eating it right now! :(

this is a great recipe. We tried the variation with the slow cooker. It was the first time we cooked roast in a slow cooker. We cooked a smaller buffalo round roast (about 1 lb) and followed all the same instructions, but reduced the final cooking time to low - 1 hour. It turned out nice and pink (med rare).   The gravy, however, needs a little work. We may search for other gravy recipes. We added flour and water to the onion residues, and then some spices to taste...but...just not very gravy like.   Overall, we still give it 5 stars for being the best way to cook roast - bed of onions using variation of slow cooker.

I never made a roast on top of the stove. And, at my surprise, it was great. I did braise my roast in olive oil first, then added onion and fresh garlic. I used balsamic vinegar witch i love with beef. I added the roast on top of onions then added fresh rosemary & tyme. I also made gravy out of the onion stock. Very very good. I would of had leftovers, but my husband loved it so much he over eat.

So easy and tasty.  I have little previous experience with roasts, so I prepared exactly as directed except for adding a couple boullion cubes to the gravy at the end.  All three of my kids asked for seconds (very unusual)!

The meat was way over cooked and the gravy had no flavor.

 
The reviews I read said the onions caramalized. No.  What happened is the onions turned to onion soup on the bottom of the pan.

I added flour to try to make gravy, but it was awful. No flavor at all except for onion. 

I managed to salvage the meal by adding some boullion (sp?) and some spices and a little more flour to the "gravy".

I sliced up the roast, poured the "gravy" over it and served it with mashed potatos.

My husband hated it and I wasn't very impressed either.

I won't make this again.

I was looking for a recipe for a small 1 1/2 lb. bottom round roast and decided to try this one. After reading the reviews, I took some of their suggestions to give it a lot of flavor. I did brown the roast before putting on top of a large, sweet onion, a swig of rosemary, bay leaves,  some fresh parsley from the garden and a few portobello mushrooms I had on hand. We like balsamic vinegar so I used 3 tablespoons. Cooked on high for an hour, then on low for almost 4 hours. Took the roast out, and used cornstarch & water to thicken up the juices.  It turned out great. Very tender and the gravy  had a wonderful flavor.  Will be making again.

This was super easy. I used a 2-1/2 pound roast and 4 onions. I added salt, pepper, 3 minced garlic cloves, and some dried thyme while sautéing the onions before I put the roast in. While they were getting ready, I cut little sits all over the roast and stuffed thin slices of garlic inside. Big garlic eaters... I was reading some of the reviews that said it was a little bland, so I added a some auju concentrate and some water about an hour in. I also found some mushrooms in the fridge that were just about to say goodbye,  so I threw them in too. Cooked in a Dutch oven, lid on at 350 degrees for 3 hours. When it was done, I whisked in the flour and water, and the onions broke into little pieces and it turned into an absolutely delicious onion gravy. Wasn't dry at all and everyone was loved it!

This was very good, I did add some carrots and garlic to the onions. I cooked it on low for an hour on the stove last night and then put in the oven this morning on 300 degrees and cooked for 4 hours. I  don't do flour so after removing the meat and carrots, I made onion soup. Very tasty.

Sorry but I did not care for this recipe. I picked this recipe because the onion gravy looked appealing. The roast turned out extremely bland, the cooking time is not long enough and the gravy turned out nothing like the picture even after adding quite bit more flour to thicken it. I read the reviews before making this so I seared the roast and even added Garlic as well as additional seasonings but it didn't help at all.

Very easy and very good. Did add a small amount of beer broth along with the vinegar just in case there was too little liquid to keep onions/meat from singeing. Definite keeper. Meat moist and tender. Gravy meaty and savory.

I clearly did something wrong.  The roast smelled incredible cooking for the 1st 3 hours, at 3 1/2 hours I checked on it and found the onions were completely burnt and stuck to the bottom of the pan.  The roast was also partially burnt on the bottom.  Hopefully I will be able to salvage the roast, but as far as the onions and gravy thats not going to happen.  Thankfully I have some brown gravy on hand, but from what all the other reviews say my brown gravy won't compare to the one from this recipe.

Always a hungry family waiting when I make this for dinner. The smell is wonderful as it cooks all day on the stove and it turns out perfect everytime. I use balsamic vinegar when I don't have white and they both taste good.

This was a tasty roast.  I didn't use all the onions but did add fresh mushrooms and used apple cidar vinegar mixed with water.  Cooked it in the crockpot on high 4 hours after browning the meat with some salt, pepper, and rosemary for added flavor.

GREAT recipe! I followed it to a tee, except I only used 1/2 cup of water and 3 tablespoons of flour to make a thick, delicious gravy.  My family LOVED it!

Very good!!  Roast is usually dry and tough but this was very tender and flavorful.  I only had a 3lb roast, so I cooked it for only 2 hours.  It was medium.  Next time, I will only cook it for 1-1/2 hours and it will perfect.  This recipe is so SIMPLE and QUICK to prepare.  The onion gravy is amazing!!  Follow this recipe just as written, and you'll have a quick, delicious roast!!  Thank you for submitting!!!!

It was hard to imagine that the roast would produce enough liquid to not burn while cooking for 3 hours but it didn't. I kept it covered for as long as needed and my husband and son really liked the pot roast. I made mashed potatoes and string beans on the side and next time I will make carrots. I recommend making this dish.

I could not cook it on the stove so I prepared it in the crock pot.  I layered the onion, added some sliced mushrooms and followed all of the rest of the directions with the exception of adding 1/4 of wine.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours and it was fabulous.  I will be making this again soon.  Thank you!

I am in process of making this recipe... it caught my eye because of its simplicity and the number of 5-star reviews. I'm
about an hour and a half into cooking a 4-lb beef bottom round roast and the kitchen is wonderfully fragrant with the smells of simmering onions and beef. I wish it was already done!

I had to make some adjustments — I only had four large white onions — so I added a cup of beef stock broth. I also added 1 tablespoon (TBS) white vinegar and 1 TBS cider vinegar. Since I didn't have any wine on hand, I added 3 TBS of Kentucky bourbon whiskey. I did have a sprig of fresh rosemary which I laid on top of the meat with 2 bay leaves.

I chose to cook this recipe in a CrockPot® and did not try to brown the meat first. I may try browning next time just as a comparison. 

I also worried that I didn't have enough onions to elevate the roast out of the liquid, so I used my folding steel steamer basket to raise the roast up with onions underneath, on the sides and in every available space... my grandmother used to cooked roasts in a similar fashion on a rack over broth and herbs in a roasting pan with onions, carrots and potatoes covered with foil in a 275° F. oven all day long. We'll see if 6 hours in a CrockPot® is long enough to cook it.

So far, this has been an easy recipe and I truly appreciate easy recipes. I will update my review after dinner!

My roast was only two pounds so I cut the onions back to three. I rolled the roast in flour that had basil, thyme, marjoram, salt and pepper and then seared.  I believe that the vinegar is used as a tenderizer but wine is also a tenderizer and tastes much better so I used wine to deglaze the pot. I also added beef broth instead of water. When the roast was done I used an emersion blender to make the gravy smooth. The gravy was amazing, thanks for sharing.

Great, simple recipe. I only used 1 & 1/2 onions (all I had) and was worried about them burning under the meat, but it turned out so good. My lid wasn't tight so I did have to add some water. I didn't like the initial smell of the vinegar, but it wasn't a problem in the end. In fact, I really loved the tangy flavor of the gravy. I also ran the liquid in the blender before adding flour/water. Awesome! Thanks for the recipe.

I like to look at reviews and see how people modified recipes.  I browned the roast and added a cup of red wine and minced garlic, then put the roast in the oven for 4hours at 300. It was fantastic!
Honestly, you could cook as is, and it would still be excellent!

The roast was flavorless and tough as leather. I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I gave two stars because I was able to add flavor and save the roast from being non edible to edible. Disappointing to say the very least.

This recipe was so bomb! I pretty much followed the instructions,  but I also seared the roast and then the onions. I used Chinese cooking wine and balsamic vinegar to deglaze. I cooked a 2.8 lb bottom round roast for about 3.5 hrs. Don't worry about not having liquid at the beginning of the cooking process because the meat exudes all this juice, after one hour you wouldn't believe how much liquid is exuded! At the end I took this broth, drained out the onions, and took a cup of the broth and mixed that with 2 heaping tablespoons of flour to thicken the sauce. I then took half of the reserved onions and put them in the sauce. Taste it. What do you have?? Practically the same flavors as french onion soup. So delicious and food for days! Served with mashed potatoes.

This makes the best gravy I have ever had with a roast! I seared the meat on all sides first.  I used balsamic vinegar.  I only had 1 large onion so I added some water to make up for the lost liquid.  I added minced garlic because everything is better with garlic in my world. :) Unfortunately I paid no attention to the amounts I used.  I cooked it on high for 1 hour and then low for about 6.  The meat was tender and the gravy was divine.  I will definitely be making this again!

Good way to cook a lean roast...it was tender but mine was a tad dry. Probably more because of the cut of meat than the recipe. Definitely needs the gravy.

My slow cooker broke a couple years ago and I haven't been able to get another one.  I like this recipe because I was able to slow cook it on top the stove in a stock pot.  Thanks for sharing.  This made the house smell terrific.

I seared my roast which was only 2.5 pounds.  Then I put 3 sliced onions in the bottom of the crock pot,then the roast, 2 bay leaves, some rosemary and 3 TBSP of Balsamic vinegar.  5 hours in the crock pot and it was falling apart delicious.  We used the juice as is rather than thickening it but I'm sure it would have been delicious thickened.

I used a 2 lb bottom round. Seasoned it with season all, garlic powder and pepper. Seared all sides in a little oil, removed from pot. Sliced 1 large yellow onion and also seared a bit in a little oil scraping the little bits from the bottom of pot. Placed roast on top of onions, added 2 cups of water, 2 beef bullion cubes, 1 bay leaf. Once broth started boiling, turned heat on low covered and simmered for 2 1/2 hours, turning over halfway through. I didn't want to use the oven so I kept it on the stove. The meat came out so tender and the gravy was oh so YUMMY! I added a little cornstarch to a little cold water and added to the broth, brought to a boil and simmered 1 min.

I made this recipe pretty much as it was written, but scaled down a bit because my roast was only 2 pounds. I dinged the review by one star because I did add some extra flavoring. I added 3 large minced garlic cloves to the onions, and browned the roast before cooking the onions and garlic. The other changes I made were basically the same as the recipe, but used for health value. I used Braggs Apple Cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, and garbanzo bean flour for thickening the gravy. I also added 3 crushed bouillon cubes to the water for extra flavor, and some rosemary and thyme. Because my roast was smaller, I used 1 very large onion that I had on hand. I added more water because I am a fan of one-pot meals, and added quartered potatoes and fresh carrots in the last hour. After adding the veggies, I increased the heat to bring it to a boil, and then reduced to low heat to simmer for the remaining time. 

My family loved this roast. It was moist and very tender. The gravy was flavorful, and the veggies turned out perfect. I will definitely be making this again.

I took MBrooker's advise and also browned the meat first, didn't have any red wine so I used white, also added garlic a bit more than MBrooker did. Loved the outcome and for tomorrow's dinner I'm going to shred the rest of the meat and add that to the gravy and put over egg noodles. Good recipe!

This recipe was quite easy and simply delicious.  The gravy was amazing and the meat, cut thinly across the grain, was moist and tasty.  Next time I think I will substitute red wine vinegar for the white vinegar but that is simply a matter of curiosity and not a complaint against the white vinegar.  Really enjoyed serving this roast.

This recipe is OK, its not super delicious. It's edible but I would try a different recipe next time. There isn't a whole lot of flavor to it. I kind of suspected that when reading the ingredient list. Not bad, but not great for 3-4 hours of wait.

Did it just like the recipe says the first time.  It was great.  Added garlic the second time, still great.  My wife did it once and left the heat on too low, so the meat had to cook longer and was tougher.  We simmered it in the sauce and it still was good to eat.  It really seems like a recipe that you can't get wrong.  Top notch.  Thanks!

This is the best recipe ever!  My husband is a chef with 15 years experience, so as you can imagine, it is hard to "wow" him!  But, he raved about this meal for days and was sad when the leftovers were gone! I only used 3 onions, but I think I will go with the full 6 next time, because they were so delicious!

Excellent! Was skeptical about the vinegar but it must evaporate in the process. The gravy was great lso. I did add a few tablespoons of water. It is a keeper. The whole family enjoyed!

This recipe was incredible!  The meat was yummy and the onion gravy was awesome!  I used a can of Campbell's beef consume (heated) instead of the water for a stronger beefy flavor for the gravy.  The next night, I shredded the leftover meat and mixed it with the leftover gravy and served it, heated, on hoagie rolls.  Even better the second time around!!

My family loved it! I used red wine vinegar (what I had on hand) and sprinkled the roast with thyme and rosemary. It was very fragrant.  I did brown the roast also. The gravy is delish!

OK, now ya'll hush about the vinegar.  Susan knows what she's talking about.  I had two roasts to cook, and ran out of vinegar with the first roast.  Thought it would be good to compare.  The roast with that little bit of vinegar was more flavorful and tender - the whole family agreed!!!

I made this about 2 weeks ago and it was delicious.  I only used 2 large onions and sliced about a pound of assorted fresh mushrooms.  Added a few sprigs of fresh thyme as well.  The only problem was that my roast was too small.  The onion/mushroom gravy was delicious with the meat and I made some garlic mashed potatoes to go with this. I will be making this again!

A very good recipe.  I was shy on the onions so I only used 2, but the next time I'll use more as it produces more sauce.  Searing before baking (at 300) is recommended.  I coated the beef with Montreal Steak seasoning and it was very good.  One notice, I have a cast iron dutch oven with heavy lid so 3 hours at 300F was overcooking in my case.  Next time I'll reduce it to 2.5 hours.

MBrooker, your recipe sounds almost identical to mine, except where you are using Merlot (yum) I am using balsamic vinegar and a lot more chunked up fresh vegetables.  The secret to a successful potroast is to sear on a high flame on all sides right at the beginning in order  to keep the juices inside the meat.  Next time I'll be trying the merlot!

This was pretty good. I liked the fact that it makes its own gravy, since I don't make gravy well. Next time I will skip the vinegar, it gives a little twang that wasn't that great. Needs more seasoning as others have noted, but otherwise it was really pretty good, I will make this again.

This was okay, definitely not the best, but I don't think I would make it again.  We didn't really find it as flavorful as we had expected it to be from the reviews.  We ended up "doctoring it up" in the end to give it enough flavor to satisfy our palates, so that it wasn't a total waste for us.

I made this for a dinner party and it turned out excellent. I made two roasts using this recipe for that party. For the first roast I followed the recipe to the letter, but for the second roast, instead of vinegar, I added red wine. The roast and gravy had an amazing flavor.

I twisted the recipe also. I made a rub from garlic powder, salt and crushed rosemary. Rubbed the meat down and browned it in a little olive oil. Degalzed the pan with wine. I added four large onions to the bottom of my stock pot and placed the roast on top. I then added balsamic vinegar. I added alot more liquid than suggested. I also went with enough to come up half way on the meat. Cooked for three hours, pured the onions, made a rouxe to thicken the liquid. Perfect!

This recipe turned out great. Used condensed beef broth instead of water and accidentily put it in the pot during the cooking time but it made a great gravy. Didn't thicken it, just poured it over the meat and mashed potatoes. Added a package of sliced mushrooms with the onions as was suggested by a reviewer and it was a delicious addition. Will use this recipe again for sure. Thanks

Great recipe, and so simple!  Took me five minutes to put together and it smelled so good cooking!  Next time I'll cook for three hours instead of four; consider what you're cooking in etc. when you decide how long.  And don't peek!

What a surprise this recipe was.  I didn't have enough onions so I added 1 can of condensed french onion soup.  I cut off the fat on the bottom of the roast and let it simmer for 3.5 hours, until it shredded easy.  After removing the roast I added some flour, which made for a thin gravy that was delicious.  This is a wonderful way to cook this tough cut of meat.

my Family loved this! It was so simple and delicious. The only changes I made was I added olive oil to the bottom of the pot. I also added five garlic cloves whole. And instead of using the flower at the end I used cornstarch because of someone with a gluten allergy. It was delicious I will definitely make it again.

Made it. It basically my grandmas recipe i just didn't want to bungle it. Like other people said, its meant to be simple. If you want to change half the prep or ingredients then just post your own recipe!!! 
So anyway, you want to know if it was good? Yes its good. Makes a very straight forward roast with onion gravy and if thats not wha t you want then dnt make it lol. What did i change? I used 3  yellow onions, a little extra liquid to keep it wet and a packet of gravy powder mix at the end when i pulled out the meat. I also used an emersion blender in the pot to blend up the soft onions. .  It was exactly what i wanted.

Wish I'd made a much bigger roast, excellent!  Used Balsamic Vinegar with a splash of white vinegar.  Browned 1st with salt, pepper and garlic powder, ground thyme.  Deglazed dutch oven then roasted in oven with fresh mushrooms.  Once done, deglazed with more water, amino acids.  LOVED this and WILL make again!

This had amazing flavor with so few ingredients! I made it in the crock pot, using a can of beef broth in addition to the cup of water. The six onions were going to take a lot of space, so I steamed them in the microwave for several minutes, just enough to relax them some. I added fresh carrots and would have loved to put in some potatoes, but there was no more room. The roast was moist and tender. The sliced onions held their shape pretty well, so I took out at least half of them, blended them with some broth and returned them to the pot. Once thickened, it was an EXCELLENT gravy for mashed potatoes!

OMG!! This was absolutely fantastic! I followed the originally posted recipe, cooked it on top of the stove for about 2 1/2 hours. Best pot roast I've ever had and so easy.

"Add this, add that, do this, do that" completely takes away from her original post saying that this is an easy, quick meal for busy moms. I'm sure there are recipes that do the fancy stuff everyone is commenting about. Find those instead of making this a lot of work.

This was delicious! Now that I’ve made it and realize how easy it is I will def make it again. I seared it on all sides and popped it in the oven with the lid on my Dutch oven for 4 hours at 300. Easy peasy.

The flavor was delicious. The meat was tough. I used a bottom round roast of 3.5 pounds, browned the meat on all sides, then put the onions in and took the meat out. Sauteed the onions and then used the red wine to de glaze the pan. Set the meat on top of the onion/wine mix and cooked per recipe. . After 3 hours it was 180 deg but really tough anyway. But it tasted good and the gravy was delicious. Maybe it was the cut of meat. Or maybe I am a bonehead. I don't have my round roast technique down.

I and my family really enjoyed it.  I used a smaller roast , 
 browned it,  added about three smallish chopped cloves of garlic after the onions where mostly caramelized, sprinkling of dry thyme and forgot the vinegar.  Made a delicious tender roast  and I would certainly make again.

I made this last night for my family and wowza was it delicious! No left overs whatsoever. I followed recipe but I did make a small change. Instead of water I used beef broth and I added a teaspoon of dried thyme. This is going to be my new go to roast recipe. Thank you!

Followed recipe exactly. One of the best roast beefs I have ever had. Very tender & flavorful. My husband is my Guinea Pig. When he says, "I could eat this every day",then I know it's good. Only thing different was that I seared it in the Dutch oven on all sides,deglazed it with a little Merlot,added onions and went from there. 2 1/2 lb. roast cooked for 3 hrs. YUMM!!!!!

Delicious but like most, I tweeked to my liking. I had a 2lb roast so I only used 2 large onion's. Added some fresh rosemary and wet minced garlic. After the first simmer, as someone else suggested, put in the oven at 300 degrees as I'm not fond of stovetop method. After 2 1/2 hours, removed from oven, placed in a covered container to keep warm. I'm not the best gravy maker so I used a package of brown gravy mix with a pinch of water and whisked then added to broth. Then a Tbs of cornstarch w/a pinch of water, stirred to thicken. Also about a Tbs of Marsala cooking wine. Sliced the meat and laid it back in the  gravy, turned the meat a few times as I kept warm till supper time. No, it's not a fast method but I had time on my hands. Thank you, Poster for sharing a great way to prepare a usually dry cut of meat!

So flavorful and delicious! I doubled the sauce so there would be enough for the mashed potatoes I made with it. Roasted some carrots with course salt and olive oil and this meal turned out to be a big hit with my family. They already requested that I make this one again. Thanks for posting this yummy recipe!

Used rice vinegar(by mistake) that added a slightly sweet tang.  Pleasantly surprised.  Would have given 5 stars except color & presentation isn’t favorable.  If you’re feeding hungry kids that aren’t finicky about how dinner looks- this is definitely a winner then! Super easy & tasty.

Made as directed and sorry to say, not much flavor.  After tasting it I had to put it back in the crock pot and add seasonings and let it cook longer.  Yes, I would say try another one. Also, I only had a 2lb roast and it took longer than said.

Used 3 lb Bottom Round roast, made a rub of 1/2 tsp onion powder, garlic powder, rosemary, basil, and thyme, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper. After applying rub, seared roast on all sides in oil in cast iron Dutch oven. Removed roast and deglazed pot with 1 c red wine, boiling for 5 min. Added 1 Tbsp red wine vinegar and 2 tsp of beef bouillon then added 4 thinly sliced sweet onions and 5 minced garlic cloves. Placed roast on top of onions with fat layer facing up. Covered and put in 300° oven for 3 hr. 
Update: 3 hrs way too long. Will check it after an hour next time. Used immersion blender to puree onions then added some cornstarch in cold water and brought to boil to thicken.

I usually add diced tomatoes, but I didn't since the vinegar seemed to serve that purpose.  I had about 4 pounds of beef, so I cut it into 8 large pieces to lay on top of the onions and garlic.  I made it mostly according to recipe, but I had some fresh rosemary sprigs so I added them.  I also added some unsalted beef stock(Kitchen Essentials brand).
It was very easy, but I wish I had kept the temperature down, because I did have to scrape the bottom of a heavy aluminum stock pot afterwards.  I think I need to try a slow cooker next time.  KDMurphy

I made this and the only changes were that I browned the meat and roasted in the oven at 325 for 3 hours. The gravy was delicious and the meat tender.

Cooked in the oven at 300 for 4 hours and could have dropped that to 3 hours. Used Merlot for liquid and for the gravy.  Great flavor and the meat was very tender.

This was an extremely easy recipe to make. Unfortunately, my bottom round was smaller and I left it cooking a little too long, drying out the meat. But the onions were terrific!

The meat was extremely tender which is not always easy with this cut. The family loved it and I see this as a great base recipe that can be altered to change flavor  profiles as often as we'd like.

This was really good, don't let the vinegar put you off.  I made it in the Instant Pot.  Here is my IP version: Saute mode, heat 1T oil, sear meat on all sides.  Remove roast, add in onions, then meat, bay leaf, and vinegar.  Close IP, seal, switch to meat/stew setting.  Set for 70 minutes.  NR or QR.  remove roast to plate, cover. Switch to saute mode to heat drippings/onion.  Mix flour and water and add to simmering mix.  About 10 min or so till you get the consistency you want.  remove the bay leaf.  Slice roast and serve.  Really really good and fast in the Instant Pot!

This is the first time I've cooked a roast, and this was an easy recipe for a first-timer. Unfortunately, it was a little too done. I should have used a meat thermometer instead of just relying on time. However, it was still tender! My husband was amazed at that. Maybe it was the vinegar that kept it tender. Whatever it was, I'm hanging on to this recipe. It somehow worked some magic and kept me from ruining dinner!

This recipe is OK. I  tasted the gravy after three hours and took the temp of the meat. The gravy was OK but bland, and the meat was over cooked by my standards. I added some garlic powder and additional salt and pepper. After some more cooking time, I put most if the onion in a blender then added it back to the pot. I was satisfied with the result enough to enjoy my meal, but I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

I made this roast today for Easter dinner, and it was AWESOME!
Don't know what part the vinegar played in the recipe, but I will say that this is the most tender roast I have EVER cooked.  I only made 2 modifications, and those were browning the roast beforehand, and apple cider vinegar instead of white.

I've made this a few times now.  First with following some of the other reviewer's suggestions, and the last time following the instructions to the letter.  The results were just OK.  Too much onion, not enough flavor, the meat was tender enough to eat, but I wouldn't say it was anything spectacular.

Used a bit of red wine after browning the roast to deglaze.
Only had 3 onions. Added garlic cloves. Cooked in the oven,  used a bit of bisto for gravy.

I made the recipe exactly as is except I did not need to add water for the gravy because it was so juicy. I thought this was just ok. There are so many better recipes for pot roast. Even though there was a lot of juice, the meat was a bit dry. I won't be making it again.

I am a novice pot roast maker.   I saw a nice looking piece of meat at the store, and bought it.  Then, I found this recipe on line.  Very easy to make, and I had all the ingredients in my cupboard.   The meat was tender and flavorful.  Everyone in my family liked it.   I also used left overs for tacos, and it was great.  Just added some taco seasoning and toppings.   Now, I am wondering if I can make a brisket the same way.   It worked great for me.

Tasted good, but definitely needs some tweaks and adjustments. 

You want to cut your onion pretty big so it won't burn. I added some flour to both sides of the beef to help thicken the gravy later, then browned each side. Then I also added two cups of chicken broth so that the beef wouldn't dry out.

I had purchased a top round roast at the store and wasn't sure how to cook it.  I followed the recipe as written, only I didn't brown ithe roast first.  My family really enjoyed it!  I thought the gravy was delicious.  I would definitely recommend this recipe for either a top round or bottom round roast.

Made this tonight.  Family loved it.  Added a sprig of Rosemary and removed when done cooking strained out the leaves as was not quite appetizing for the kids. But they liked the flavor. It also made a delicious gravy.

Trying it today. Dubious about the only initial liquid being 1Tbs of vinegar. What is there to simmer? 

Vinegar softens connective tissue, which is great, but more fluid is needed. Especially at altitude.

Also, browning roast and adding thyme.

I just made this for dinner and thought the flavor was super yummy...I didn't add the water or flour to thicken the juice.  I just blended the onions with the juice and put that over the meat (and mashed taters).  I also only used one onion with just under a 2 lb roast.  I did find the roast to be a little bit tough and dry but with the juice poured over it we didn't notice too much. I might have cooked it too long too.  Still I loved the flavor, I didn't find it to be bland at all!

I've made a tof of recipes from here but I've never left a review before- this is worthy of my first. I had to prepare this when my boyfriend was out of the house because I just know that if he saw the onions he'd quarantine the kitchen. I told him that it was like rice and if he lifts the lid it ruins it, ha! He LOVED IT and said he can't wait for leftovers!
This was delicious, I didnt ad salt or pepper until the end and to be honest it didn't really need it. I also browned the meat first and cooked in the oven (just so he wouldn't peek and see the onions) but other than that I kept it true to the recipe. I will be making this again and again, thank you!

Great.  I followed another reviewer's recommendation and used an immersion blender to blend the gravy.  Also cooked in the oven for 4 hours at 300.

I cooked this in my crock pot and followed the revisions to the recipe that Gina made on Jan 10th, 2007 (look in comments section).  It was SO easy and soooo very tasty!

YUM YUM!  I followed the recipe for the most part, I changed the following.  I browned my roast first and added minced garlic.  This roast was very tender and delicious.

My husband and I loved this recipe. But, as advised by other reviewers, I seared the meat, added about 3 cloves of minced garlic with the onions, used 2 Tablespoons flour to thicken, and then added a packet of no-sodium beef boullion and salt and pepper to taste to the gravy.

my family loved this recipe, but the gravy just didn't have enough body so at the last minute I added 1 beef boullion cube and an extra bit of flour and water to thicken.  Beef very tender, but next time I will try it without the vinegar.

This recipe was great.  I only added one onion and 3 cloves of garlic along with the bay leaf. I did sear it on all sides with oil and then let it simmer for 3 hours on the stove in my dutch oven.  Even though the meat was well done ( i like my a little rare) it was very tender.  The gravy that you can make from this was very tasty as well.  Great winter meal.

The meat was very good. The only reason for my medium rating was that I don't understand the need for 6 onions. I sliced all of them, put them in there, and am not sure what their purpose was. I am not a good gravy maker, but I followed the directions for the gravy. I just think 2 or 3 would suffice?

I love roast and decided to try this new version.  The vinegar overpowered everything else.  Also, I'm not sure why it's cooked with so many onions.  I might try it again to see if I did something wrong.

I took other reviewers suggestions about browning the roast first.  Then followed the recipe exactly.  The flavors were good, but I found it to be very dry.  I cooked a 4.5 lb roast for 4.5 hours.  Maybe I cooked it too long?  Not sure if I will try again.  Maybe I should have used another cut of meat or cooked it in a crock pot?  Based on the great reviews, I was anticipating it not to be so dry.  I just could have done something wrong.  Also, the one cup of water with one tablespoon of flour was not enough to thicken the remaining juices to make a gravy.

This is the first roast that I cooked on top of the stove in a pot and it came out great.  The gravy was excellent.  I did use wine, rosemary, and thyme with it. I will cut the cooking time down a little next time.  Hubby really liked the whole meal.  Served with fresh steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. This is a keeper!

I made a few changes and it turned out awesome!  I added some baby bella mushrooms to the onions and I cooked it, as another user suggested, in the oven at 300 degrees for 4 hours. When making the gravy, I added more pepper and some garlic powder. They gravy was perfect!  I will be making this one again for sure :-)

Very good and juicy (and I peeked inside the pan a few times). The outside was yummy--I browned this first using Tastefully Simple's Balsmic and Basil Dipping Oil and Worchester Sauce.  I may marinate it overnight next time prior to browning.  I added minced garlic to the onions (1.5 large spanish onions) on the bottom of the pan. Mushrooms would be a good addition, I think.  Served it with Quick Cheese Biscuits (recipe on this site), steamed carrots and baked potatoes.  I'm stuffed.  I used a 2.5 pound roast for the two of us and we have lunch for tomorrow and enough to make soup.  Gravy didn't thicken enough--needed more flour.

My roast turned out dry so I think next time I will do this in the crockpot.  My gravy wouldn't thicken until I added some cornstarch.  I served with roasted brussel sprouts, and two recipes from this site: Mashed Potatoes with Horseradish and Candied Carrots.  Cabernet made the meal.  Thanks!

I cooked this in the crock pot - high for 1.5 hrs, then the rest of the time on low.  Was pretty good.

I used most of the suggestions of MBROOKER and added additional salt & pepper to everything before cooking. Used a Spanish red wine which the onions picked up very well. The roast itself was terribly dry so thank goodness for the sauce. Perhaps in a crockpot it holds some moisture but not in a regular pot. A decent basis recipe but definitely needs some tweaking.
