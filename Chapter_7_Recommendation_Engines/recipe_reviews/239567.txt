I would rate this higher if I could!  I made them as mini muffins.  I cooked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect.  The recipe made 24 minis.  I served them with whipped cream cheese and everyone raved about them.  I will definitely make these again!

Our family considers ourselves pumpkin muffin connoisseurs, so rating these 5 stars comes with lots of experience. The density, the texture, the flavor - perfect! This is our new favorite recipe! Well done!

This recipe hits the spot when it comes to pumpkin spice cravings. I added a touch of extra milk for more moisture and sprinkled some raw brown sugar for a crunchy top. Will definitely continue making; these muffins are just too good to limit to one season--they deserve year-round enjoyment!

This was a very thick batter, and a very dense muffin...but I liked it a lot.  My husband and I both felt that it tasted identical to the pumpkin scone at Starbucks, very hearty and tasty.

I tripled the recipe. For "pumpkin spice" I used half cinnamon + 1/2 allspice and then added in a touch of ground cloves. Additionally instead of using lemon extract I substituted in oil essence of Orange. I added in an extra three quarter cup sugar or if you were following the recipe 1/4 cup. Tripling the recipe made a total of 44 muffins. Lastly, I used a 12 oz package of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips. Reviews from everybody were stellar and our family loved them too. Brought them to the office as well as sold at a bake sale- again everybody loved.

I doubled the recipe and made mini muffins (about 12-15 minutes in oven), but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  They are AMAZING!  Will definitely be making again.
