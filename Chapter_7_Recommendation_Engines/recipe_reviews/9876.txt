This recipe was alright. I didn't have any problems with it except that it took awhile to cover the chocolate with the dough. However the cookies didn't taste very chocolatey (and they were more of a cookie than anything). The upside is that they stayed soft for a few days.

I was so happy to find this recipie! I had had these cookies before but couldn't find the recipie. These cookies are great--you'll want to make a double batch! You can also decorate them with icing after they have cooled.

Wow! Definitely worth the effort. These are now my favorite Christmas cookies!!! The almond extract makes these taste gourmet!

I have been making these for more years than I want to admit originally found the recipe in a magazine. I quit using shortening many many years ago and use butter instead. I always frost them using jiffy white frosting mix from a box the only thing I have ever used and I can no longer find it in store but it can be ordered online for.50 a box plus shipping (minimum 12 boxes). Just ordered more today lasts me a couple of years for these cookies and sugar cookies at christmas. I also add lemon to the cookie dough instead of almond extract and to the frosting and it makes them superb. I cook at 325 for 10 minutes. a little flour on your hands as you shape the cookies around the kiss helps plus refrigerating it beforehand and only removing a bit of dough from the frig at a time also helps and I mush the tip of the kiss too to make enclosing it easier and I have made using hershey chocolate nuggets too in place of kisses and no unwrapping lol. it just makes bigger cookies. these are also great to make put in the freezer on a cookie sheet or plate for a few minutes and then freeze in a freezer safe container to bake at a later date they can be baked frozen you might have to add a minute or so to the bake time just watch them closely. and whenever you bake them do not over bake.

Once again these cookies were good but not sweet enough in my estimation. They were enjoyable but not fabulous.

I love this recipe. I have been using it for years. Yes it is a little tricky to wrap the dough around the kiss. I find it easier to break off the top point of the kiss. The cookie looks plain but people are very surprised when they bite into the little cookie and find the chocolate surprise inside.
