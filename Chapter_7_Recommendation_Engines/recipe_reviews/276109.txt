Love this!
We ate these right out of the oven with dinner.  There were no left-overs.

These are tasty! Used fresh cauliflower, took it through the cheese grater in my food processor  and microwaved it for 7 minutes then started with the cheesecloth step. I have them stored in an airtight dish but they get soggy. So next time I have to figure that part out.  When I want them I toss a few on a pan in my toaster oven and crisp them up. These are super good with guacamole.

Excellent.  I increased the ranch seasoning and added paprika and Tabasco rather than cayenne.  I also reduced the temp by 25 degrees to bake a little longer on my convection setting.
