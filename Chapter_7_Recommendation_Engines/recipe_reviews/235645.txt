Delicious!!!  My husband and I loved it!  I used 2 regular chicken breasts and 1 huge chicken breast cut in half length-wise.  Instead of mixing the chili powder and cumin in a bowl, I threw it in a gallon sized plastic bag, dumped the chicken in, and smooshed it all around.  I used about 2-3 tablespoons of oil instead of one, as I didn't feel it was enough to keep the chicken from sticking.  I paired this with Mexican Corn and Spanish Rice.  With the leftovers, I am planning on chopping up the chicken, and serving it in tortilla's, taco style.

Really tasty chicken recipe. Be careful with how hot the picante sauce is. It can really make or break the recipe. I also season's the chicken with a touch of pepper.

This recipe is very easy to make, and it looks very appealing!  However I would like to tweak it somewhat.  I think the tomato soup makes it rather sweet, so I may try tomato sauce instead.  This recipe makes a lot and the sauce is generous, so you can stretch it by adding even more chicken to feed a bunch of people.

Very good flavor, but a LOT of sauce. I think the water could be cut down or even eliminated.

This is a tasty dish!  Next time however, I'll probably reduce or omit the water altogether, as we felt it would have been more flavorful without it.

This is one of the best recipes i have made from all recipes... awesome iob.  It pairs really well with the lemon thyme rice if you make the rice without the lemon juice.

I took another persons tip & also spiced it up in ziploc ahead of time & let it sit a few hours. then followed rest of recipe. I used thin cut chicken breasts also. I thought it had a little too much liquid at end but it tasted fabulous! Would have gone perfect over rice & prob absorbed the extra liquid but I'm on no carbs rt now! super yummy!

Yum! I was looking for something simple and easy to do with chicken and beans that wasn't taco soup and this is it! I cut up the chicken and guesstimated on the amounts but otherwise left everything as written in the recipe. I served it over white rice (all we had) and my husband and I loved it. Our 4 year old wasn't as big of a fan, but at it anyways. We will definitely make this again.
