I know many if you have found this recipe to produce a soupy mess if the water isn't cooked down. Please try my variation on the recipe: 

Omit:
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce 
1/2 cup water 
1 (12 ounce) jar taco sauce
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 pint sour cream   

Replace the ingredients above with the following:

1 can (10 oz) La Preferida Enchilada Sauce (Hot or Mild)
1 jar (16 oz) Frontera Grill Salsa (I like the Chipotle Salsa)

This is one of the favorite things I've made from this site.  It was very time and labor intensive the first time I made it, but each subsequent time I get faster.  I make a double or triple batch, and freeze the extras after rolling.  When I'm ready to prepare I take out the amount needed and put in a baking dish, throw on the sauce and cheese and into the oven.  The second and third times I serve it from frozen are even better than the first batch that doesn't see the freezer!  Using the other reviewers suggestions, I omit the water, substitute salsa for the tomato sauce, chopped chiles for the green pepper, red enchilada sauce for the taco sauce, and use reduced fat cheddar. I poach my chicken in some chicken broth and herbs, then shred it with 2 forks.  I've also tried it with a supermarket roasted chicken, but my family likes it best when I've poached it.  Sooooo delicious!

This is a fabulous recipe!! Since I'm not one to follow recipes to a "T", I too made some modifications.  Instead of the green pepper I use green chiles, more chili powder, and a few dashes of ground cayenne pepper to spice it up.  I also use very little water and about half of the recommended tomato sauce.  For a rich and creamy flavor, try adding a few tablespoons of cream cheese and some Monterey Jack--it's wonderful!  I've also added refried beans to these enchiladas and they turned out great. Overall, this recipe needed some modifying to suit my tastes (I also used red enchilada sauce rather than salsa), but it's a good base for the best chicken enchiladas I've made yet!

These are wonderful! I do make some modifications so they are more like the Mexican food I am used to eating which does not have red sauce on the inside. I prepare the chicken in chicken broth and shred instead of cube.  Next I add the cheese and other ingredients but I do not use tomato sauce or water for the filling. I also add green chiles to this mixture. I then roll and place in the pan. I use enchilada instead of taco sauce as the topping. I find the flavor is better. I do not buy the commercial brands of the sauce (like El Paso) which can taste strange and instead look for a Mexican variety. These are a big crowd pleaser and it is easy to multiply the recipe for large groups. I highly recommend them!

Very yummy enchiladas!  Probably will become a staple in our household.  Minor varitations based on other reviews.  YOU MUST:  Poach your chicken with a mixture of poultry seasonings, cumin, minced garlic, tomato sauce, and chicken broth.  This will make your chicken FABULOUS and trust me, this makes all the difference in the taste of the enchilada!!!  Substitued a 1/2 jar of Ariba Roasted Mexican Red Salsa (medium) and a 12 ounce bottle of La Victoria red taco sauce (mild) for the water and tomato sauce (much needed change).  Also cuts down on the sogginess other reviewers have complained about!    Used the Red Enchilada Sauce from this site to finish it off.  Absolutely superb!!!  HELPFUL HINT: this recipe freezes extremely well.  Thanks Debbie for a great recipe to build on for personal preference!!!

These were incredible!  For the filling I skipped the tomato sauce and water and used an 8 oz. jar of taco sauce instead.  I also used a 4 oz. can of green chilis instead of green pepper.  Also 1/2 pint of sour cream equals 1 cup.  I used about 3/4 cup and Mexican blend cheese instead of Cheddar.  I topped the whole thing with a 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce mixed with about 1/4 cup of half and half to make it nice and creamy!

What the heck? I am just not getting the high rating on this recipe. I agree with MSAGGIEAMY (9/11/05) review. She mentioned growing up in Texas and exposed to much better enchiladas. Same here for Cali, where I am from and live. I figure that must be why we are so picky, this is nothing more than a smothered burrito. And not a very good one at that. With the spices used, you'd think it would have some flavor. But not! How the heck did this recipe get in a cookbook? First of all, I've yet to find a flour tortilla enchilada recipe that was actually worth making a second time. But you know what? That darn number, 533 ratings, 415 reviews, 5 star average, and published in a cookbook, really suckered me in. I'm dumbfounded still by it, and wish more people would be more honest. I'd like to know if the people who said it was the best had ever made real enchiladas before. I'd like to know where they are from and their cooking experience. I am sending the rest of the enchiladas to my husbands work tomorrow and asking him to put a sign on the breakroom fridge offering them to people for free. I am not trying to be rude or mean or slam the author of the recipe. I'm just frustrated at wasting my time & money on something only to be be extrememly dissatisfied.

I've gone through every single rating now, bewildered still. There are other's that agree, I urge anyone that is trying this recipe to read them all first.

I was very surprised at how good this recipe turned out! I had company over, and one of my guests was Mexican/American...all she said was WOW!!!!!!! When did YOU learn to cook real Mexican food????  It turned out great....I followed the advice given here, and eliminated the water, sauted some garlic, onion and green pepper together, and used only 1/2 of the tomato sauce.  I eliminated the taco sauce, and used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe found on this site.  Totally awesome, and not too much effort.  Served Mexican Rice, also found on this site.  Excellent meal, and as husband stated...it's a keeper!

The overall taste of this recipe is great. However, I made the recipe without reading the reviews first and was sorry. Omit the water or you will have a soupy mess. I made do by using a slotted spoon to put the chicken, peppers and onions into the tortilla shells and then pouring the rest of the mixture over the top along with the taco sauce. I used 8" wheat tortillas and that seemed to work well in the casserole dish. next time I will use precooked chicken to cut down on the time. This is not exactly a quick supper. Also, a whole tablespoon of chili powder was a bit much for me and I wasn't able to offer it to my toddler.

We loved these enchiladas--my husband said these were the best he ever tasted.  However, I used  meat from a rotisserie chicken that I shredded with two forks.  I think this meat is tastier, juicier, and a better consistency than plain cubed chicken breast.  I also used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Those are the only adjustments I made.

I, too used only 8 oz. tomato sauce and omitted the water.  Only used 7 tortillas---more filling in each one.  Made this in the morning, leaving off the taco sauce and cheese topping, refrigerated it, and when dinner time rolled around, whipped the pan out, put on the taco sauce and cheese (used sharp cheddar and mozzarella) put it in the oven for about 40 minutes and it turned out super.  When boiling the chicken breasts I add some powdered chicken broth to the water, let it come to a low boil, add the chicken, and let simmer for 15 minutes.  I also shredded the chicken...makes a great texture.  A wonderful, filling, restaurant quality meal.  Will make this again and again...

I would have given this 5 stars, but since I made a few changes, I am giving it 4. I love All Recipes because I can read the reviews of other people and it is extremely helpful!  I used a can of diced Mexican-style tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce and enchilada sauce intstead of taco sauce and omitted the green pepper.  I also used a Mexican blend cheese and my family loved it!  My husband took leftovers to work with him the next day and said they tasted even better when re-heated!  This one is definately a keeper!

This was a hit! I did "tweak" the recipe, though. Before work I put 4 large chicken breasts, the chopped onion, parsley, oregano, black pepper, tomato sauce, chili powder, 1 full chopped bell pepper, and garlic in the crock pot (no water). I cooked it on low while I was at work all day, and shredded the chicken when I got home. I then added the sour cream and shredded cheese to the shredded chicken mixture, and stuffed the tortillas. Covered tortillas with taco sauce and cheese and baked (a little longer than recommended). It was great! Thank You!

It was good.  I recommend this recipe in conjunction with CRISCO(R) Chicken Enchiladas.  Use the sauce from the other recipe and follow everything else in this recipe.

Que enchiladas tan ricas!  Okay...this recipe made me speak Spanish it was soooo authentic and delicious!  What scrumptious enchiladas!  I followed the advice of others and poached / shred the chicken, and also used canned diced tomatoes in place of sauce/water.  The 'Red Enchilada Sauce' from this site absolutely MADE this recipe, and I'll never used canned again!  I used 14 corn tortillas (warmed in micro so they don't break!) and added 1 tbsp. shredded co-jack cheese to each before rolling.  Use the green chiles instead of green pepper for great flavor, too.  Everyone in my family said these were the best chx enchiladas they had ever eaten, and we've eaten a few thousand in our lifetimes!  My advice -- if you want rave reviews from everyone...make this recipe!

Great enchiladas, with a little adjustment. I've made these twice and both times the chicken filling came out a wee tad bland. In order to fix that, I added the optional 1/2 tsp salt. Defenately include the optional salt. I also added an additional 1/2 TBSP chili powder to the 1 TBSP the recipe already calls for to make it 1-1/2 TBSP chili powder. In addition, I added 1/2 tsp of cumin. That helped give it more flavor. Due to recommendations, I skipped out on the 1/2 cup of water and used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of 15 oz. so it wouldn't be too mushy. Finally, I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and dipped the the tortillas in the enchilada sauce before rolling, in addition to just topping the enchiladas with the sauce before going in the oven. The enchiladas won't be "dry" that way and will be more flavorful having sauce smothered all over the tortilla. Also, I used corn tortillas instead of flour to make them more authentic and so there would be more smaller enchiladas instead of fewer of the bigger flour ones. Overall, good enchiladas with those few minor adjustments.

i gave this 4 stars because i changed it to suit our tastes, but the changes made it 5 stars for us!! first, i boiled the whole chicken breasts in water until easily shredded. i sauteed the onion and green peppers in olive oil until soft, and then added the spices. i also threw in a can of green chili peppers. i sauteed 1 min longer, then added the tomato sauce and chili powder. i left out the water. i cooked that for 5 min at a simmer to meld the flavors, and then i added the sour cream and cheese.

delicious!

This recipe was horrible. It was so soupy that it was impossible to roll up in the tortilla. I tried to rescue the mixture by using it as a dip with tortilla chips and it would not even stay on the chips. If you attempt this recipe, definately leave out the water and at least half the tomato sauce. What a waste!

I would definitely make again, with the modifications suggested. I used a mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar, a can of mexican style salsa instead of tomato sauce, no water, a can of green chilis instead of green pepper and enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. I served it with chopped avocado, chopped tomatoes, sour cream, mexican rice and shredded lettuce. Tasted better than a mexican restaurant's meal.

For the sauce I used chopped green chilies instead of green pepper, added some cayenne pepper, used tex mex shredded cheese,and omitted the water. I let it simmer for a few minutes and did not find it too "soupy", rather, it was creamy as the recipe states. That being said, we filled the tortillas using a slotted spoon and drizzled the excess sauce on top, along with the taco sauce and shredded cheese. And let me tell you these were near perfect in taste, presentation,texture, and consistency! We live in the Canadian prairies but my husband has family in SW Texas, and said these rival the enchilads you find around there. Thank you!

Delicious recipe! My first time making enchiladas, and this recipe was perfect! A few alterations I made: used whole wheat tortillas, enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, did not add water, included refried beans with chicken mixture, added olives as garnish. A big hit with the family!

Can't believe how incredibly bad this was.  It was like a blah mexican soup that was so liquidy I couldn't get it into the tortillas with it all spilling out.  Diagusting. Will never make it again.

What a great dish! I used green tomato sauce and added chopped chilis and rooster sauce on top! Amazing!

Are you serious? This has got to be the most messed up recipe on this site. The whole "featured in cookbook" and all the 5 star ratings and reviews made me buy into this. I was really in a hurry to put all the ingredients in, and the chicken was messed up at first too. I definitely will NOT be making this again, unless my parents really like it. After I took them out of the oven, they wouldn't come out 'cause they were sticky, and it was basically a soupy jumble of mess. My mom came to the rescue and we threw away the tortillas and put the filling in more tortillas. What a waste of my time and money. Even now they are STILL a bit soupy, but at least fairly edible.

These didn't turn out well for me.  They were soggy and didn't taste at all like enchiladas.  I think it would have been better if the chicken were shredded instead of cubed, otherwise you end up with some bites with no meat and they don't roll well.  You can shred chicken easily by boiling it instead of pan frying it and puling it apart with a fork.  It's much quicker too, especially if you use frozen chicken.

These are realllly good.  I used a little less tomato sauce but it still seemed like it was going to be really liquidy.  I was worried...but fear not...it turned out great and these enchiladas needed all that sauce!  Let the sauce simmer for several minutes to thicken.  These were even better the next day!

I made these using suggestions from other posts:  used (approx. 12 oz.) salsa instead of tomato sauce and water, used a poblano pepper instead of a green bell pepper, enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, 2 cloves of garlic and only used about 1/4 pint of sour cream.  I poached the chicken with salt, pepper, and oregano and then shredded it with two forks.  I prepared these for another family and rolled, baked, and froze them.  The family said they were best they had ever eaten and asked for the recipe!  Thanks, now I need to cook them for myself!

Overall, this was very good and the family loved it. However, I made a big mistake by not reading the "most helpful" reviews of this dish. If I had read them I would have known to omit the water and add only 1/2 of the tomato sauce. The recipe as given is so soupy that it was very difficult to make the enchiladas. I ended up adding a can of refried beans to thicken the mixture up. Also, this isn't a quick dish to make so allow yourself plenty of time. Next time I'll use the pre-cooked chicken strips from the store.

Good enchiladas!  The flour tortillas are a nice change from corn.  Instead of taco sauce, I used the 'Red Enchilada Sauce' recipe from this site.  Excellent!

Bet the recipe is meant to say use tomato paste with water and not tomato sauce with water!!  You would never add water with tomato sauce but do with paste.  Made modifications of other users and they were great.

I followed the advice of several previous reviews and replaced the green pepper with chili's, cut the tomato sauce in half and completely left out the water and used a really good enchilada sauce from our local Trader Joes.  I also decided to poach the chicken in broth and herbs as on other reviewer suggested. I think though that I used more chicken than was needed. I only used 2 breast halves but they were really big and I had a LOT of filling.  Knowing a weight on the breasts would be helpful (my 2 probably totaled about 1 1/2 lbs).  Now here's where I had the biggest problem with this recipe (and several others I looked at on this website) -  Enchiladas are made with CORN tortillas.  I heated 12 corn tortillas in the microwave for about 1 minute then dipped them in the enchilada sauce which I had spread some of in the bottom of the pan, filled them and rolled them up. Topped with more enchilada sauce and a mix of cheddar and pepper jack cheese and baked as directed.  These were restaurant quality enchiladas.  I served them Spanish Rice recipe from this write and my hubby loved them.  I will definitely be making these again.  They would be great to take top the office potluck.

This a great American version on enchiladas. True Mexican enchiladas are made with corn tortillas, if made with flour tortillas it is classified as a burrito. Besides that, this is a safe recipe that I'm sure will be a crowd pleaser. The only thing that I changed, to make it a little more authentic was, the chicken. I boiled a whole chicken and shredded it, mixing the light meat and dark meat. Not only is it a money saver, but the chicken comes out super moist too.

While undoubtedly very tasty once I finished, this recipe needed a LOT of adjustment.  First, I used two more chicken breast halves.  Second, I added about two more cups worth of cheese (Monterey Jack as well as Cheddar, just for variety.)  Third, a half pint of sour cream was far too much.  Two heaping tablespoons was more than enough.  Fourth, I omitted the water and still had to simmer the mixture and drain it to keep it from being runny.

Despite all this, the end result was gobbled up by everyone.  But I'm not giving it five stars because of all the adjustments necessary.

I made these the other night after having eyes the recipe for a month deciding whether or not to try them. Well they were a BIG hit with a very picky husband who just usually eats and says nothing. He coudn't stop going on and on about them, and he even told his friends. I also made my own red sauce instead of the taco sauce and omitted the tomato sauce from the filling recipe. Try them, you won't be sorry

Either the instructions are written wrong, or the liquid in it is totally wrong.  You can't roll soup into flour tortillas.  Either the 2nd group of ingredients (salt, tomato sauce, water, chili, green pepper and garlic) is mixed separately and poured on top with the taco sauce, OR you strain the mixture (as I did) after mixing all together and roll the solid stuff into the tortillas, putting the remaining liquid on the casserole bottom and put the tortillas on top of it.  There was obviously a huge mistake in this recipe as given.  I too wish I had read the reviews before I made it.  I am sure it will taste good.

These are great.  Used corn tortillas & a can of enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce.  Much better than my old recipe.

This recipe is fantastic (but don't add water)!  However, if I am going to make a meal from scratch, I always figure I should go all out!  I love this recipe with Texas Enchilada Sauce, also from this site, and with jack cheese rather than chedder.  Also, I pan fry corn tortillas for about 20 seconds rather than using flour tortillas--I think flour tortillas get a bit soggy under the sauce.

I trashed my previous enchilada recipe after making this one.
-boiled chicken breasts and shredded them (it makes a difference)
-Didn't put in any of the water
-Used a 4oz can of green chilis instead of green peppers
-Used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce
I think it's the sour cream and cheddar mixed in before the other sauce ingredients that makes this recipe great! Thanks!

I made this for friends for New Year's Eve dinner.  Everyone really liked it.  Like some of the other commenters, I used a red enchilada sauce (Sara's from this website) instead of the taco sauce.  I omitted the tomato sauce from the enchilada filling (when I forgot to buy it from the store) but in the end this was a good move because it didn't become too tomato-heavy.

I have not had much luck, trusting the reviews on this site.  People modify the recipe to the point where it is unrecognizable, and then they rate the original recipe... which in this case, is, um, awful.

My family gobbled these up. Made a few changes, based on other reviewers' comments--and it was delicious. First, I poached chicken breasts in chicken broth, tomato sauce, chicken seasoning, minced garlic, and cumin, shredded it, and put it back in the liquid. Then, I took a few spoonfuls of the liquid out (to reduce watery texture) and added the onion, sour cream and cheese. I followed the rest of the recipe as indicated, rolling and topping the enchiladas and baking them. Really yummy. Next time, I would roll half for the kids, then add a pinch of cayenne and roll the other half for the adults.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was sooo yummy!!! Besides shredding the chicken, it was fairly easy to make too!  I replaced the tomato sauce & water with green chili enchilada sauce (bought green by mistake) & salsa. Also used just a couple spoonfuls of sour cream instead of the full 1/2 pint. Then I topped the enchiladas with an 8oz jar of red enchilada sauce mixed with 1/4 cup half & half too make it creamier! Delicious!!!

Yummy! I used picante sauce instead of taco sauce & crushed tomatoes instead of sauce - to add some chunkiness. Used boiled shredded chicken instead of breasted, sauteed the onion and garlic in butter along with chicken. This was the best enchilada recipe I've tried. Definately a make again dish!

My Daughter-In-Law, Kresta made this from your site and they were DEE-LICIOUS!! It was like we couldn't get enough of them, LOL LOL!! Definitly a very good recipe for someone that's just starting out cooking without a lot of experience or someone who's had a lot...these Chicken Enchiladas are Excellent and you can still tweak anyway you might like them, but their very good the way the recipe reads!! Good Job!!

I did not care for this recipe! I left out the water, because it was clearly not needed after adding the tomato sauce. Enchiladas need enchilada sauce. These were more like tortillas filled with chicken and spicy spaghetti sauce.

These are no where near true enchiladas! I will never make these again! If you want soft baked tacos, then this is the recipe for you. Dont make them thinking they will taste like Mexican food, because they won't!

So good my hubby and I have made it twice this month! The only difference in my version was to add cilantro (mexican just isn't mexican without a little cilantro!) and I didn't add the water to the mixture. I found the can of tomato sauce was just the right amount of liquid. I believe we also used 3 chicken breasts, rather than 4, but they were huge so I don't think that made too much of a difference! Very good recipe, will make again, and will try other variations as well.

This was amazing!!  I did make a few changes - omitted parsley and oregano, replaced both the tomato sauce and taco sauce with enchilada sauce (these are enchiladas, after all!) and used corn tortillas instead of flour for a more authentic taste.  I also shredded the chicken after cooking, instead of cubing.  The filling plus the corn tortillas really give a good Mexican flavor, even for us snobby Mexican cuisine folks!  I even used fat-free sour cream and my full-fat-loving boyfriend couldn't tell the difference!  Perfect with margaritas.  It was even delicious the next few days as leftovers.  So very pleasantly surprised at how yummy these were!  A perfect addition to our Cinco de Mayo!

First: WOW! this recipe is the absolute best enchilada I have ever tasted.  
Second: If you change the recipe in any way don't rate it!  I cannot belive anyone is stupid enough to blame the changes they made on the origional recipe.  Instead of rating the recipe bad review your cooking skills first.

I really enjoyed this recipe!! I read the comments from others and did not add the water and used enchilada sauce rather than taco sauce. I actually didnt have enough chicken so I basically had to 1/2 the whole thing.  Still turned out great. I didnt use standard cheddar cheese--I used the taco cheese (3 blend with seasonings) as well as monterrey cheese.  I also used the corn tortillas..make sure if you use these that you warm up the tortillas in a pan..i tried w/out warming and they all cracked open..when warm you can wrap and no cracks.  Even with the 1/2 recipe that I had to make I still came out with about 12 enchiladas...keep in mind the corn tortillas are smaller then the burrito ones you get in the store.  I will definately make these again!!!!

This was a great recipe!!  Taking suggestions from others I too omitted the water and half of the tomato sauce.  I was out of parsley but added jalepenos for a spicier taste.  The only thing I will do different next time will be to coat the bottom with a cooking spray (they stuck)! All the way around it was a great meal!!

If it's a "flour" tortilla...how can they be called Enchiladas?   Looks more like a burrito to me. No one I know would use flour  tortillas...corn tortillas is what we use for Enchiladas.  And they are better for you as well.

Great recipe.  I used previously grilled chicken breasts.  I also sweat the onion and green pepper briefly because I didn't want crunchy vegetables. Omitted the water because it was already soupy.  Excellent!  I will make again and again.

This was really good.  Like others I omitted the water and used green chilies instead of the green pepper.  I also added some jalapeño pepper.  The kids had fun helping me cook and assemble this. We will make it again.

This was just okay, I don't think I would make it again. The filling was good, but I didn't like the taco sauce poured over them and they were overall a bit bland.

I made this tonight, and wow, absolutely phenomenal! I've had my fair share of mexican food in my life (though in reality, most is more tex-mex) and this is the best enchilada I've ever had. A few changes; first is I listened to the reviews and omitted the water. Second, I couldn't find any taco sauce, so I just used a 14 oz can of enchilada sauce. Third, I used way more cheese on top (but that's cuz I'm a cheese addict). My friends who were over tonight couldn't stop raving about it, and I will most definitely be making again. 5 stars!!

I had never made enchiladas before but these were delicious! I used left over chicken, halved the tomato sauce, omitted the water and used red enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce. I also used taco seasoned cheese. SO yummy!

Good!  Destroyed my kitchen, but was well worth it!  Of course I made changes according to the suggestions of others and my own preferences: 1) Slow cooked 2 large split breasts with olive oil & taco seasoning 2) Sauteed onion, green pepper, and garlic until the onion was carmelized 3) Shred chicken and add to onion mixture 4) Add sour cream, cheese, and a load more spice than indicated: cumin, italian and taco seasoning, chili powder 5) Omitted the water and mixed in one heaping cup of salsa instead of tomato sauce 6) Put a thin layer of salsa on baking dish to lay enchiladas on 7) Heated tortillas in microwave for about 30 seconds each to soften and therefore make it easier to roll 8) Covered enchiladas with more salsa instead of taco sauce, added the cheese and then baked as instructed.  Definitely a recipe to hold onto!

I grew up on TexMex and authentic Mexican food and this just did not cut it . I decided to prepare this dish because of the high ratings. I was very disappointed in it. I only managed to eat one bite and decided to opt out and go with a sandwich for dinner.

These were delicious ... espeically when coupled with the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe found on this site as well.  I did exchane the green peppers for 2 small cans of green chiles and omitted the suggested water.  I also boiled the chicken breast in water seasoned with bouillon and then shredded the chicken instead of cube.  When you combine these two recipes with the Mexican Rice II and Canned Corn Casserole recipes found on this site, you will find yourself with a very pleasing, very complimentary Mexican meal ... with barely little left over!  :O)

This is another family favorite of ours.  The only thing I change is NOT adding the water, otherwise they are perfect!  All guests, friends, and family members who have tried it all say these are better than most restaurants' enchiladas.  It's hard to find them better than this.

First of all, 
Don't use the water...no need.  I did follow the recommendations of the others and substituted (southwestern style) salsa for the can of tomato sauce, used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, and used green chilis (4 oz) instead of green pepper, boiled and shredded the chicken, and used reduced fat  cheddar,....Other than that, kept all spice amounts the same..I made sure to tuck in the ends of the enchiladas while rolling them...so I had no mushy mess....Absolutely delicious...nice little kick..Started meal off with homemade guacamole and nachos....Will definitely make again....

This was exactly what I wanted.  I grilled and shredded the chicken; sauteed the onion and garlic before adding everything else.  Used most of a 28-oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and water and 1 can of green chilies in place of the green peppers and added a little bit of cumin for extra flavor.  Instead of 6 oz cheese, used about 10 oz.  Filled 10 large tortillas instead of 8.  I guess it depends upon the size of your chicken breasts.  Definitely to be made again.

these were very good.  my first time making enchiladas and surprising not hard at all.  the only thing was, they stuck to the pan.  next time I will pour some of the taco sauce into the pan first and lay them on top.

I really liked the filling in this recipe, but the taco sauce just didn't work well.  If I make again I will use enchilada sauce.  I didn't really make any other changes to the recipe though and like I said, the filling is great.

I have no idea what went wrong, I even omitted the water, but this came out like soup!  Ended up making a layered casserole using the sauce, tortillas, and cheese.  It definitely did not have a good "enchilada" flavor.  Will stick to the original way next time.  Sorry - since so many of you rave over this one, but definitely not a keeper for me.

I made this last night for dinner and everyone loved it!  It was so yummy.  I made a few modifications:  I, like others, did not add the water.  This was a good idea it would've been too watery if added.  I also added red pepper to the recipe and it was delicious, we're not big green pepper fans.  I also shredded the chicken instead of dicing it and it came out really good, but I only used three chicken breasts instead of the four.  Lastly to make the recipe less fattening I used fat free sour cream and lite white cheddar.  It came out awesome.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Delicious Meal!  Highly Recommended! I wouldn't add the water though.. I had to use corn starch to thicken it up a bit. Also next time i make it I would cut up the chicken before cooking it.  Otherwise, Great recipe!!

made this for the first time.  I made the changes as suggested by Patrick.  These were amazing and I've been asked to make them again.  As for the chicken, I poached it, then shredded it with a couple of forks instead.

I used a whole rotis chicken. Do not use the water it calls for, and only use half the tomatoe sauce. I also only used half the taco sauce on top and added extra cheese on top.
Everyone loved it except my toddler.

Great when I changed it up.  Way too much fluid in the original.  I went with only Hatch green chili sauce 15 oz. instead of water, tomato sauce and taco sauce, and the enchiladas were great.  Still a bit wet but great.  Also cooked 5-10 minutes more as 20 minutes didn't heat em up enough.

So delish!  I've made these several times now and agree with the other reviews, modifications must be made or it is a sloppy mess.  Easy fix:  be sure to drain the chicken well, scratch the water off the list (not even sure why it's there), and when filling the tortillas, use a slotted spoon to drain the chicken from the mixture; reserve sauce.  Next, take the reserve sauce and mix it with the taco sauce to pour over top.  YUM!  Note:  it's very mild, so if you like it spicy don't be afraid to spice it up with extra chillies, jalapenos or hot sauce.  This dish also freezes well for future lunches.

These were really tasty. I threw a couple chicken breasts in the crock pot with some seasoning on low before I left for work and when I came home it shredded beautifully with hardly and work. Just use two forks and there you go! Enjoy everyone

Delicious...I always skip the half cup of water, and I cook the onions and pepper in a little bit of oil before adding anything else.

These were awesome! I too made a couple of changes. I substituted 1 cup of mild enchilada sauce and a can of diced green chilies for the tomato soup, water, chili powder and green pepper. Also, I poured more enchilada sauce over the top instead of taco sauce. I also put a layer of warmed refried BLACK BEANS (did you know they make those? yum! look in the Hispanic grocery section, not the taco section.) on the tortilla, then added the chicken mixture before rolling them up. The whole family loved them!

wouldn't call this "quick & easy" but good. 
I made some sig mods so it's hard for me to "rate" the true recipe but I share them because I think they're helpful.  I didn't change the ingredients much just the prep. Overall a good add to my recipes.
I used a crock-pot & put the chicken & seasonings in it to cook for about 6 hours.  This allowed me to "shred" the chicken easily & the flavor was well infused.
I used corn tortillas (trying to create a gluten free & more authentic vs) but corn tortillas don't wrap as well so that is frustrating. Taste was deeper with corn tortillas but some may not like it.
Filled the tortillas with meat mix but let the juices drip off so they enchiladas weren't too soupy.
I used the 5 min enchilada sauce from this website, which was impressive & easy instead of taco sauce. It had a nice smokey flavor.
I used more cheese (naturally). Love cheese.
The recipe stays & travels (took casserole to friends house). 
It is a hit.

This is a 5+ star recipe after a few modifications, for my family at least. What I did was:
#1. Substituted salsa for tomato sauce and enchilada sauce for taco sauce. I would have subbed green chiles for the bell pepper but couldn't find them, next time hopefully I'll be able to use them.
#2. Added refried beans, also used a dab to seal closed the enchiladas. (Was premaking and freezing in freezer bags)
#3. I cooked the chicken in my crockpot overnight in chicken stock and taco seasoning, before shredding.
#4. Added mozzarella while rolling (last minute decision, for fun, lol).

I don't know if it helped the flavors blend, but I needed to put the meat mixture into tupperware and into the fridge for 12 hours before I got a chance to roll and freeze them. Anyways, awesome recipe, not dry or wet, bland or over-spiced, not overly cheesy either--perfect, IMHO.

This recipe got rid of my 9 months pregnant craving for Taco Bells chili-cheese bean burritos!

A great base with ingredients that I usually have on hand (which I love) but I found I had to make a few changes while I was cooking. I left the water out entirely and didn't use all of the tomato sauce.  I was trying to avoid the mixture from being to runny.  I added slightly more spice to suit my family and added fresh cilantro from my garden to the sauce.  Very good flavor.  Next time I will try with corn tortillas.

After making this recipe I will never use another for chicken enchiladas! Even my husband, who doesn't care of Mexican food much, loved these! I did use more taco sauce in lieu of the water and tomato sauce and it wasn't too wet as the other reviewers commented. This will definitely become a staple in our household. Thanks Debbie!

My husband who doesn't really like mexican food actually ate this up. I did the substitutions suggested (leaving out the water, sauteing the onion garlic and pepper first, and switching to enchilada sauce for the topping). I liked them, but actually found them a bit more bland than anticipated. Will be looking through other reviews to see if anyone has any suggestions for spicing it up a bit. Will make again :)

I have made enchiladas for years and there is countless ways to make them.  I like fine chopped onions, green chiles, sharp cheddar and some times I add chicken.  But, one thing I always had a problem with the finished meal. After you pour the enchilada sauce on top and sprinkle some cheese and maybe onions on top place in the oven (I use a convection oven) and bake until the cheese and onions inside are fully melted the enchilada sauce on top is often dried out because of evaporation.  So what I do now is keep the remaining ench. sauce in the pan throw in the onions if you like and wait until the cheese and onions are well heated and the enchiladas are done.  Then I pour the hot sauce over the top and serve.  Bob

These are easy and so good. Mine also turned out "beautiful". I served them with a side of sour cream, more sauce, hot peppers, and spicy rice that I cooked with a package of taco seasoning. I'll be making these again for sure! Thank you for this great recipe!!

I followed the suggests of most other comments -- I omitted the water, sour cream, taco sauce, etc.  Subbed enchilada sauce and salsa.  These enchiladas tasted great, but they were reeeeally spicy!  I love kick, but not that much.  I used mild salsa, and it's a good thing I didn't use the chili powder!  I also omitted the green pepper because I discovered the ones I had were no good.  So what could have made it so spicy?  I'd like to make them again, because it was pretty easy and tasted great otherwise, so if anyone has any ideas, that would be great.  Thanks!

Yum!  These are super good.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli so all I had to do wash shred the already cooked meat.  Sauted the onions a bit and then mixed everything else into the skillet.  I left out the water and replaced the green pepper with a can of green chiles.

Thanks for making my Cinco De Mayo a success. These were so good. The only change was that I made my own Red Enchilada Sauce from AR instead of using taco sauce. It was perfect. Will make again for sure!

I did not follow the recipe to a "T" but with my changes it was amazing! I first cooked up a small onion and a bell pepper in some olive oil, then added a packet of taco seasoning. I then added a little water to make a sauce and then sprinkled in about 1/2 cup of uncooked instant rice and covered the pan with a lid until the rice was almost cooked. I stirred in some sour cream and cheese then rolled the filling into 5 tortillas, put them into a 13x9 and covered it with a can of enchilada sauce and lots of cheese. I then cooked it at 350 for 35 minutes and it was to die for! I will definitely be making it again and maybe next time I'll add some corn.

This is the best chicken enchilada recipe I've found. It always gives amazing, delicious results. I made a few changes that were minor. I usually use store bought rotesserie chicken and shred it. Then I add El Pato Mexican tomato sauce instead of regular. Finally, I use canned green chile enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. Delicious!!!

I made this exactly as directed the first time, omitting the water and it was still a little too soupy for me.  The 2nd time, I used 6 chicken breasts, omitted the water and added a little extra cheese.  It made 10 large enchiladas and was a perfect consistency.  I topped with enchilada sauce the 2nd time and it added so much more flavor and the extra spices in enchilada sauce are definitely needed.  Definitely restaurant quality with these changes.  I've made with flour tortillas and with corn and it is delicious either way. Thank you for sharing this, I can't wait to make them again!

This one's a definite keeper! Fantastic flavor... as good, if not better, than our local Mexican restaurant! I took the suggestions of some others and used a can of diced green chiles instead of green peppers. Also, I omitted the water and used a splash of red wine and a splash of beef broth in its place. (I'm sure you could substitute beer just as well.) I added a can of drained and rinsed black beans to the filling and used a slotted spoon to fill the tortillas... it would have been way too soupy otherwise. Then I mixed the taco sauce with the sauce that remained in the skillet and topped the enchiladas with that. Then sprinkle on your cheese and you're good to go!

I used 2lbs of ground chicken instead and it was TERRIFIC!!!!!!!!! Also next time I will skip the water because I had to let it simmer a looong time before it was thick enough to put on the tortilla and roll. Otherwise it was one of the best things I have ever made and will do it agian! Huge hit with the family and there were no left overs!

WONDERFUL!  I followed other reviewers recommendations to omit the water and tomato sauce and substitute enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Substituted the bell pepper with a 4 oz can of diced green chiles (semi drained). I also only used about 1/4 cup of sour cream because that's all I had.  I substituted dried cilantro for the parsley (didn't have the parsley) and cooked and shredded the chicken. The recipe made 8 enchiladas - I baked four of them, and froze the other four - reserving the extra enchilada sauce in the fridge for later use.  My husband and I both loved it! This recipe is a keeper!

Wow!  These were awesome!  Changes:  1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 mild rotelle instead of all tomato sauce; green chiles instead of green pepper; poached and shredded chicken; mexican cheese blend instead of all cheddar; no water added; and enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Everyone LOVED these and I heated up leftovers for breakfast this morning and topped with an over-easy egg on each.  Yum!

I followed this recipe exactly and it is a good base, but wow, it needed some changes.  To all the reviewers who used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, that was a great idea.  Taco sauce is a condiment and made the dish way too vinegar-y.  Also, some people omitted the water and I would definitely do that also b/c while filling the tortillas, it was dripping out.  I will make this again with these changes and then I truly believe it could be a 5-star, easy recipe!

These enchiladas were good, but not 5 stars.  The 10" flour tortillas were too big to fit 8 into my casserole dish.  Enchiladas are supposed to be made with corn tortillas anyways.  I tried the white sauce that AUTUMNJOY suggested, but I was not pleased with it--too flour-y.  Finally, I used a 4 oz can of tomato paste and a can of Rotel tomatoes in the place of the tomato sauce, water, and bell pepper, and the consistency and spice were fine.  I will make this again, but I will use a Mexican queso sauce on top instead.

This has become a request at my house.  The flavor goes well for just about any guest and the leftovers are eaten pretty quickly.  I like it with a lot of sauce so I left the liquid amounts as the recipe called.  I do add corn and sometime I black beans.  I also take the time to shred the chicken.  The only downfall of this dish is,it leaves for quite the clean up.

The recipe is excellent!  I made it for my fiance on his birthday and he has been raving about them ever since.  I did make a few minor adjustments to the recipe that I found helpful though.  I decided to eliminate the 1/2 cup of water from the filling altogether, it was still nice and moist, but not too mushy. And I also boiled the chicken and shredded it with a fork, I found it made the tortillas a little easier to roll.  Instead of the taco sauce that it calls for, I decided to try the recipe for Red Encilada Sauce that was submitted by Sara.  Very good.

Mmmm!  My sister made this for me and I was in love!  A great blend of flavors, none too overwhelming and so easy to make!  It definitely makes a lot and they are filling, so plan on leftovers or enough for 4-6 people.  She made the red enchilada sauce with them and it was absolutely delicious!  I brought some leftovers home for my roomie and she agrees...two thumbs up!

After I started making the recipe I found out that I had no chili powder so I substituted taco seasoning.
I believe the ending results were the same as it would have been with chili powder as the taste was very pleasing! The only thing I would change next time is to increase the amount of chicken to give the sauce a little more body.

My husband could not stop raving about this recipe!  I omitted the water 
completely and used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  For a little kick, 
I added diced chiles to the filling.  Delicious!  This does take a while to prepare, 
however.

I made some changes to this recipe.  I didn't add the water or the green pepper.  I did however add black beans (3/4 can), corn (1 cup) and a can of green chilies.  Rather than folding them into enchiladas, I put the tortillas in the pan, then added the mixture, a layer of tortillas etc, ended with the taco sauce and cheese.  It was delish!  Served with a side of guacamole

I read some of the reviews about it being 'soupy' so I changed the recipe slightly to counteract it and the family LOVED it. Even my picky 8 year old. Instead of water, taco sauce, and tomato sauce; I used enchilada sauce, a can of green chilies, and refried beans (which was a HUGE help keeping them together when wrapping them.) I poured half the enchilada sauce into the mixture along with the can of green chilies. I took a small scoop of refried beans and smoothed it across a tortilla added a scoop or two of the mixture and wrapped it up and wala it stayed and no soupy mess. I also sprinkled some green onions and dried parsley across the top after cooking.

I used 3 cloves of the garlic and added a 1/2 t of comino and used only an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and substituted lo sodium chicken stock for water, used only enough to bind the chicken mixture, and mixed the remainer w the taco sauce and poured it over. This kept the inside filling moist, but not runny. It was pretty good, again, using corn tortillas in place of flour.

AMAZING! I used salsa, and cream cheese to mix with the chicken instead of tomtato sauce. I also added refried beans, which really added flavor and thickness. Also used enchilada sauce on top instead of taco sauce. These were very good. I felt almost like I was eating at a mexican restaurant! :)

Tasty and easy to make. You can add a little more heat if you like or keep it mild for company. Doesn't reheat very well so eat it all.

What a wonderful recipe! I had never made chicken enchiladas before and wanted something simple that required little ingredients, this was perfect! I tweaked it a tad bit by forgoing the oregano, parsley, tomato sauce, water, and green pepper. The way I did it was poach thin skinless boneless chicken breasts, shredded them, I seasoned the chicken with chili powder, salt, cumin, and blackened seasoning, then sprayed a large skillet with nonstick spray, added the chicken and half a red onion. Cooked that for about 2 minutes than added the sour cream, 1tsp. minced garlic, salt, and Mexican blend cheese, Cooked that for about 5 minutes than filled 8 flour tortillas with an even amount of the filling and placed them on a baking dish sprayed with pam. Finally I added a can of enchilada sauce, sprinkled the rest of the Mexican blend cheese and since I didn't have much left, I shredded Colby jack cheese cooked for about 15 min and now I'm about to pull them out the oven. AWESOME RECIPE! :)

Usually highly-rated recipes are good on this site, but not in this case. I found myself sorely disappointed with this recipe. The vegetables inside the "enchiladas" were still uncooked by the time I ate it, and it turned out to be mushy. The burritos were bland. I'll never make enchiladas with flour tortillas again. Californians beware!

So Good! Had everyone asking for the recipe and it became one of my favorites instantly. Plan on bringing in a tray of them to my co-workers. 
Didn't add all the water, included more chili pepper and added some cayenne. Had some more heat but not too much :)

Great recipe. Tasty and simple, the best kind!

Couple of tweaks for my personal taste...omitted the sour cream and water (sauce was liquid enough), halved the chili powder and added in half a tablespoon of hot smoky paprika.

This recipe made 10 enchiladas, but only enough cheese and taco sauce for 6. I boxed the rest and put them in the freezer.

I made these last night with a few of another reviewers revisons and I must say they weren't quite what I expected. They were definitely a good dish. I had used the taco cheese blend with a can of the green chilies and taco and enchilada sauce. I think the onion was a little overwhelming and I like a kick to my mexican food too! I just felt as if the recipe was lacking something that I couldn't quite put my finger on! I'll keep trying for another good enchilada recipe though!

Really amazing flavor, love what the sour cream does for the sauce. I only made a few changes. I added 8oz sliced mushrooms, as I add mushrooms to pretty much anything. I substituted red enchilada sauce for the taco sauce. I also drained off most of the sauce (after mixing everything and simmering) and used it to drizzle over the enchiladas after they were in the pan--I prefer a drier "inside" and saucier "outside".
Hubby doesn't generally go for Mexican, but this was a hit and has even made his request list!

This dish is totally the BOMB! I changed the recipe a bit: added 1 fresh chili to the pan (was making 4 servings) with everything on it and skipped the water, otherwise all the same and it was totally amazing!

Like other reviewers, I found the mixture to be really soupy. I changed two things. (1)I didn't add the water. Using a straining spoon, I was able to get all the ingredients into the tortillas without too much liquid. What was left was this incredibly tasting sauce. (2) Instead of topping with taco sauce, I dumped the remaining sauce that was left in the pan on top of the enchiladas and topped with a ton of cheese. Amazing!

I prefer my enchiladas with more cheese and sauce and found these to be a little dry and bland.  Just so-so for me.

I'll admit I cheated a bit and never even really looked at the instructions. I chopped everything first and put the ingredients into 2 bowls- one for the onions, sour cream, cheese mixture, and one for the green peppers, chile powder and tomato sauce mixture. I had made enchiladas before and was familiar with how things should look so I never added the water. I just guessed on the spices because I was too lazy to get out the measuring spoons. I also used a can of enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce- which is a bit thinner. I also used small flour tortillas to make little mini-enchiladas so I wouldn't be so tempted to overeat. Overall they came out amazing! I will definitely make this again.

This was my first attempt at enchiladas and overall I was pretty pleased. I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it. I think next time I will try adding some refried beans into the tortilla!

Absolutely amazing. I make it without the peppers due to personal preference, but everyone loves these. My first attempt was a bit of a soupy mess, but I've learned to let the sauce cook down a bit after the tomato sauce is added.

The only change I made was replaced the water/tomato sauce with 1/2 cup thick salsa as suggested by a couple of other reviewers.

This was a simple recipe and was absolutely delicious (even though I inadvertently put the taco sauce in with the other ingredients ... oops).  

Will be saving this one as a favorite and making many more times.  :)

My family enjoyed these enchiladas.  I omitted the salt, chili powder and bell pepper to accommodate my daughter's taste.  I also replaced the taco sauce with enchilada sauce.  Served this with mexican rice, refried beans and a green salad.  Thank you Debbie.

I think I found a new family favorite!  I made a couple of changes based on what I had and another review.  I sauteed the pepper along with the onion and I only had 8 oz of tomato sauce so I omitted the water.  It still resulted in a lot of liquid as other reviewers have indicated.  So instead of using taco sauce, I poured the remaining sauce over top and baked.  These were very good.  Will prob add to the rotation to use with leftover roast chicken.  Thanks for sharing!

I've been making this recipe for over ten years.  The only changes I use is not adding water, and I don't use the Taco Sauce since I don't care for the taste.  And if I find it's too runny I use a slotted spoon and take out the good stuff into my tortilla shells and then I use the remaining sauce and poor that over the enhiladas instead.  runny or not you can't lose.  The recipes is awesome!  Tonight I'm trying it with a  whole roasted chicken instead of the breasts.  Don't be detoured from the "runny" comments...like I said the sauce that comes out of it is delcious and tastes way better then taco sauce on top.

Very good.  I will spice it up a bit next time and saute the onion first.  Used half tomato sauce/half diced tomatoes - undrained, and enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.

Great start for a recipe, I did make the changes most others suggest. No water, subbed salsa for tomato sauce, green chiles for green bell peppers, added a little cayenne pepper, and used the red enchilada sauce recipe (from this website) instead of taco sauce. Everyone who's had them loves them! This time I am going to try adding a little cream cheese to the inside.

I made these last night, my first attempt ever at homemade enchiladas. I only made a couple changes, used half cheddar and half monterey jack cheese, I like it better. I also added chilis instead of green pepper like many others because I can't have green peppers. And I added a can of black beans, because they're great in everything!
My fiance and I both loved them. Very Good!

Fantastic!  Creamy, flavorful, authentic!  Two things I changed; I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, dipping the tortillas in the sauce before filling them, and I used corn tortillas instead of flour because using flour tortillas for enchiladas just seems wrong to me.  Big hit!  My new go to enchilada recipe!  Thank you!

Pretty good, considering my 5 year old liked it and he has turned his nose up to at least 2 other chicken enchilada recipes that I've made.  I used a couple of short cuts - shredded left-over rotisserie chicken and about half a jar of salsa poured over the top AFTER baking. I think the added water is a TYPO - no extra water is needed if you use sauce (add water only if you use tomato paste).   I used about a tablespoon of green chilies instead of the green pepper and added a few sliced black olives on top.  I sprinkled mexican style shredded cheese (one of the blends they sell) on top and omitted the taco sauce.  The tops were kind of crunchy  so I added a bit of salsa - perfect way to moisten and add a bit of color.  Next time I might add some cilantro to the mixture and maybe hint of red pepper flakes for a bit more kick.  I served them with sliced avocado, extra sour cream, and a corn-black bean side dish.  Tasty!

This recipe was SO easy and not time consuming at all in comparison to how great they came out! I agree that you can probably omit the water, and will definitely shred the chicken instead of cube it...I cannot wait to make this again!

This is very good, but not quick and easy.  I will probably make again if I have the time.  I used whole wheat tortilla's and it tasted great.  Also I made my own taco sauce using Hunts whole tomatoes, ketchup, cumin, cayenne pepper, chili powder, turmeric, parsley, cilantro, garlic and onion powder.  Tasted good.  But reminder to people this is very time consuming.  But very tasty.

Do NOT make! I am a newer cook...however my husband is an expert cook so Ive been spoiled the last 10 years and finally thought I should have 10-20 meals that are excellent instead of depending on him =) So I thought...why not start with enchiladas =) It got high ratings, all looked good. I followed other advised revisions and did not have the soupy mess that others had. After I made the filling (btw I made 4x the recipe so I could freeze have left overs) so the inside tasted awesome it was like home made stove top without the crutons and 'thought' maybe this was going to lead up to something good! I WAS W-R-O-N-G......so I have to say...they were not completely unedible...by the time we added chopped green onion, sour cream, avocado, olives, etc...it all meshed together 'ok'...along with the other sides we had with the dish.....the next day when I went to get some left overs, I was thinking how FUN it would have been if it would have tasted like restaurant quality, being home made *by me*...but unfortunately...just another day of stove top chicken enchiladas =) Now im stuck with the filling.....im sure my hubs will find something to do with it, the good side? I didnt over-eat (lol)

I usually leave out the water and as I am rolling the tortillas I roll them in green taco sauce.  This is an amazing recipe and loved by all who have tried it.

I made this exact to recipe the first time to rave reviews.  I sometime deviate a little based on what I have in the house but always yummy.  I do shred my chicken by boiling it first and pulling apart with two forks.

Made just a few changes.  No water and topped with enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  I didn't use the oregano or parsley and used a 1/2 can of green chiles.  Would probably use less onions next time.  Everyone in the family loved it and said it was a definite keeper!

These were tasty, though I don't think I agree with the submitter when she says "quick" :=) I used salsa (not nearly 15 oz of it, more like 4 oz), omitted the salt and water, and used an Anaheim in place of the bell pepper. These were good substitutions for us & I'd do them again. I also used less taco sauce as a personal preference. Thanks for the recipe! EDIT: My husband ate one of the leftovers for breakfast today (don't judge!) and said he reallllly wished I'd quit using flour tortillas for enchiladas because the leftovers are squishy and weird. That's really my fault as I should've just used corn tortillas from the start but I wanted to experiment and this recipe had 5 stars and a lot of reviews, but wet flour tortillas are just not our thing I guess!

These were very good.  I substituted the sour cream with cream cheese and the tomato sauce with fresh salsa.  I made the D's Famous Salsa from this site which is good.  Instead of taco sauce I made the Red Enchilada Sauce from this site also and doubled it!  I poached my chicken in chicken broth, poultry seasoning, garlic, cumin to add flavor.  I omitted the water as others suggested.  The meat mixture was to die for!  I added refried beans to the tortillas and Mexican Rice which I also made from this site.

I've made this recipe as is, and it's really good.  However, I have problems with the mixture being too soupy and I'm not wild about the green peppers.  To fix this, I leave out the water and replace the peppers with green chiles.  And it is soooo good.  One of my favorites, definitely:)

My entire family LOVED THIS!  I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used a can of RoTel that I pureed in my mini Food Chopper. I also added Black Beans for some added fiber. Delicious! Add a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cilantro when serving. This would be a great dinner to serve company. Definitely a keeper! :o) Happy Eating!

This was a great meal.  I made some modifications.  I shredded a store roasted chicken into a bowl.  I added some chopped onion, sour cream, canned chilies and cheese.  Then I realized that I only had a few tortillas.  Ugh!  I poured a couple tablespoons of a canned Mexican Enchilada red sauce into the bottom of my casserole.  I spread half of the chicken mixture.  I topped this with some shredded cheese and additional sauce and then repeated the layers.  The top layer was just tortillas with sauce and a little cheese.  I may have saved a few calories using fewer tortillas.  End result was delicious.

Awesome. Sauteed onion, green pepper, and garlic first.  Used a pre-roasted herbed chicken from the store and shredded it.  Left out the water, halved the tomato sauce and added 8 oz. tomato paste. Instead of taco sauce use a good enchilada sauce recipe.

This recipe is very good, my son and his girlfriend love them. I usually add olives on top (personal preference) and more cheese, as we love lots of cheese. I personally prefer shredded beef in my enchiladas, but I like this too.

I LOVE this recipe--It's one of the only ones I crave!  It's easier if you use CANNED chicken! First I saute the onions and garlic (and green pepper if I'm using it, but I usually leave it out) in olive oil until tender, and instead of cooking the chicken, I make it easy on myself and drain 1.5 - 2 cans of cooked chicken and take a fork to it, shredding it, then adding to the onions.  I cook it a little with the onions to get the chicken a little flavor, then add the sour cream and cheese and let the cheese melt.  Next I add the other ingredients (minus the water--it makes it too runny) and simmer as long as possible.  TIP:  You can use 8oz oz of salsa instead of tomato sauce/green peppers.  When I do this, I cut the chili powder down to 2 teaspoons because the spice becomes overpowering with the added spice from the salsa.  Seriously LOVE this recipe!  I also use Ortega Mild taco sauce and Mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar.

Very tasty! I did not read the comments before I started cooking, so I made the dish according to the recipe. The mixture was way too running, so I reduced the heat and cooked it until it became a thick sauce. It worked perfect & everyone loved it. I'm going to try it in the future with the enchilada sauce to compare the difference in taste.

Glad I found this recipe and the great reviews with tips. Super advice! I gave this 3 stars since I modified it quite a bit. The modifications I made really did make for a great dish. First, I boiled the chicken (5 breast halves) in water w/some chicken bouillon for 20 mins. To my surprise, this made the chicken very tender and easily shredable. I shreded it with 2 forks. Then continued with the recipe. Per another reviewer's suggestion I omitted the sour cream, tomato sauce, water, chili powder and taco sauce and replaced all of that with 1 jar (just buy the medium size) salsa and 1 can (buy the bigger 19-24 oz can) enchilada sauce. For the filling, I followed directions with the shredded chicken and added about 1/3 jar of the salsa mixed with 1/3 can of enchilada sauce. Next time I may just omit that step and won't add cheese since real enchiladas don't have that in them. Rolled the ingredients in tortillas and topped pan with the remaining enchilada sauce. (You can use leftover salsa as a condiment.) I originally forgot to add the bellpepper and garlic to the filling before rolling them - so I saute'd (sp?) the mixture and sprinkled over the enchiladas before adding the cheese and enchilada sauce. Try to get fresh tortillas (Costco sells raw tortillas.) It was muy delicioso!

Mmmmmmmm, delicious!  I left out the whole tomato sauce, water, green pepper, etc. part and just stirred in a small jar of salsa instead.  The filling is so fabulous! And instead of taco sauce, I dipped my tortillas in warmed enchilada sauce, filled and rolled them, and topped them with what was left of the sauce and cheese. They were soooo good!

OMG! This was so delicious! My husband absolutely loved it and I made it for my sister's family and they said it was better than any restaurant enchilada they have ever had! I did make the following changes though: I put the chicken in the crockpot with chicken broth and cooked on low the night before and then shredded the chicken the next day (it was sooo tender), I omitted the water and the green peppers, I added an 1/8 tsp cayenne and a 1/2 can of cream of chicken soup to the chicken mixture, I mixed the other 1/2 can of cream of chicken with the taco sauce for a more creamy sauce. You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

This was good, but kind of weird. The sauce inside the enchilada tasted Italian, while the outside tasted mexican. I would suggest omiting the basil and parsley and maybe putting in some chili powder and cilantro, or something like that.

Excellent!  The only thing that was not great, was I had so much extra sauce and it wasn't very thick.  So I ended up adding a can of tomato paste to thicken it up.  So with having so much sauce, I scrapped the taco sauce, and just poured the remaining sauce over top of the tortillas, topped with some more sour cream and cheese and it was awesome.  I also added a bit of cumin and coriander, about 1/2 tsp. each and it was the perfect amount.  Even my kids gobbled it up.

This is a very good recipe, although I did make some changes.  I used nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I also cooked everything using a little chicken broth rather then oil.  I softened the veggies and garlic before adding the chicken and other ingrediants.  I didn't use any water because it seemed watery enough.  When I made the actual enchiladas, I used a straining spoon to get the chicken and veggies into the tortillas.  I reserved the sauce and added 12 oz of enchilada sauce.  I put this on top of the enchiladas.  Very tasty!

Fantastic recipe.  I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  The only thing that I would change if I made it again is that I would put some sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before arranging the enchiladas because they stuck to the dish.  If you aren't a huge onion fan, I might recommend sauteing them before adding them to the mix.  The dish doesn't bake long enough to mellow them very much.

These are WONDERFUL!!! I made these last night and everyone loved them, they also wanted the recipe. I ended up using Enchiladas sauce (10oz) because my husband went shopping, but it worked out great. I've never made enchiladas before and I was worried how they'd turn out but it was really easy. Great for leftovers too! Will be making many more times.

This recipe is absolutly delicious! My husband loves it so much he had me make some to take to work and share with his coworkers! I have made this recipe several times, and my only suggestion is DO NOT ADD THE WATER! It makes it way to runny! I also use Medium or Spicy taco sauce to add more flavor to the dish!

These were AWESOME - I did make lots of changes however. I used pork instead of chicken (we get tired of chicken easily), 4 oz can of green chilis instead of the green pepper (many other reviewers suggested this and it was a GREAT idea,) sauteed the onions in olive oil before adding, did NOT add the water (in fact, the mix seemed a little runny even without it,) and I ran out of cheddar to put on top so I used shredded parmesan and mozzarella instead. This made the enchiladas much more colorful and it tasted great. I also added some cayenne and red pepper to the filling because we like spicy food. These honestly tasted like restaurant-quality. Many reviewers said to use corn tortillas - I didn't, and I'm glad because I like the texture of a softer enchilada. These were so much work (set aside a good hour and a half) and lots of cleanup, but well worth it. I will definitely make again, my boyfriend was going crazy over them! PS: I made them with spanish rice. Good meal!

Very easy to make.  I used green chilis instead too, and boiled and shredded the chicken.  We loved it and so did the neighbors.  Thanks for the recipe!!
*****Update*****I made these about three months ago, and when I did I had enough to fill a 9X13(which is more than enough for my family), and I had quite a bit of the filling left so I filled three more shells and put them into a 8X8 dish, but I DID NOT put these into the oven.  I knew we weren't going to eat them to I took them out of the fridge wrapped it up in clear plastic wrap really good and put it into my freezer...well three months later I cooked them for lunch at 350 degrees until the cheese was done on top...and they taste GREAT...just as good as they did the first day...I think this may be one of those recipes that I know double and freeze the extra for a great meal done quickly!!!

I thought these were wonderful! I added fresh chopped cilantro and made the enchilada sauce by sara on this website instead of the taco sauce to cover with. I also used low fat sour cream and just a couple spoonfuls.  I also boiled the chicken to shred rather than cube. The family liked it, however hubby still likes chicken enchiladas ii by steph better.

Delicious!  I added some chopped cilantro along with the pepper and garlic.  I didn't need the jar of taco sauce, instead I used the leftover filling sauce and poured it on top.

I made this recipe again for my hubby and he loved it, even more than Don Pablo's enchiladas.  We're on a diet, so to make it a little healthier, I used whole wheat tortillas, 2% milk cheese, and light sour cream.  Plus I used red peppers instead of green because I like them better, and put the onions in the skillet with the chicken because I like them well-cooked.  Oh, and about the water - I didn't need it, but the onions I used were juicy and I had thrown in a few tablespoons of lime juice for flavor.

My boyfriend could not believe that I made these from scratch. 
I ran out of room in the pan before I ran out of filling so I mixed what was left with the taco sauce to cover the enchiladas with.  Sometimes the tortillas burn on the edges if they aren't covered enough so this was perfect.  Don't lose this recipe!!

I thought these were EXCELLENT.  I couldn't belive how easy they were.  I didn't add the water and I was very happy with the results. Quite simply they are easy to make and very tasty.  I made with Spanish rice and it was a wonderful meal.

I can't say these were my favorite. I have never met a bottled taco sauce that I liked, so I will just stick to making my own enchilada sauce. I  also don't like sauteed chicken in this because the filling flavorings can't stick to the slick edges of the chicken. I prefer it roasted and shredded, providing lots of surface area. This recipe also convinced me that I don't like warm sour cream so I won't put that in next time, but rather reserve it for on table.  All that said, these were decent and my family liked them, though they liked my usual ones better.

I'm from New Mexico.  In my world, enchiladas are NEVER made from *flour* tortillas!  We use corn tortillas that have first been softened in either oil (preferred) or by steaming.  Try these with corn tortillas for something more authentic.  Also, spice it up with some Rotel.   This is too bland.

Amazing!  I've never made enchiladas that taste like are from an authentic Mexican restaurant until I made these.  I made the red enchilada sauce from this site to use instead of the taco sauce.  My other modifications, based on other reviewers suggestions, were to poach and shred the chicken, omit the onion, substitute diced tomatoes with their juices for the tomato sauce and water, and to use a jar of chopped green chiles instead of the bell pepper.  By poaching and shredding the chicken and making the enchilada sauce a day in advance, it made this a meal easy enough even for a week night.  I served this with a side dish of corn sauteed with green, red and jalepeno peppers seasoned with cilantro for our Cinco de Mayo meal.  Strawberry margaritas were the finishing touch!

My hubby and I LOVED this recipe!  The only thing I changed was that I substituted (pickled ) jalapeno pepper for the green bell pepper.  It definitely "kicks it up a notch"!  Thanks for the great recipe; I will make it again.

This recipe is okay if you're NOT looking to make authentic chicken enchiladas.  I used corn tortillas not flour tortillas because they tend to get soggy and gooey.  I also made my own enchilada sauce for the topping instead of out of a jar and sprinkled some comino into the chicken mixture.

GREAT recipe!!  However, DO NOT add the water... it is already a very soupy; I used green enchilada sauce mixed with Frank's Hot Sauce instead of taco sauce.  I didn't have tomato sauce so substituted a can of Rotel & tomato paste.  I also added jalapeño & serrano peppers, fresh corn, ground cumin, & extra cheese on top.  SO good!

This recipe was great.  I made some slight changes at the others request.  I boiled the chicken and shredded it.  I sauteed the garlic, onion and pepper first and I added enchiladas sauce instead of taco sauce.  Oh and I eliminated the water.  It was not soupy at all, it was perfect, I loved it!

OMG!  These are AWESOME!  I've tried many enchilada recipes and this tops them all hands down.  Everyone kept on raving about them, agreeing that they are the BEST.  I knew I should've read the past reviews before making this because you don't need to add the water and only 1/2 of the tomato sauce is needed, but all in all, excellent!  I don't see how many people haven't given them recipe a try yet, it's "da bomb!" This will now replace our chicken enchilada (II) recipe from this site.  God Bless you Debbie =D

I made these for a company potluck and everyone loved them and several people asked for the recipe.  I took a couple home (I made a double batch) for my 19 year old son and he said they were the best he'd ever had and he wants them for dinner this weekend!  I did leave out the water and cut down on tomato sauce (for a double batch I only used one can) as it would have been too soupy. There was plenty for 10 10" tortillas. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect!

Not spicey enough for my families taste.  I also
should have opted out of the salt.  The 1/2 cup of water was too much for the filling as it was hard to roll into the tortillas.  Will probably make again and substitute Cayenne for the black pepper.

This was amazing!!  I eliminated teh watter and added montery and co-jack cheeses as well.  I also sprinkled 1 tbsp melted butter over teh enchiladas before cooking, and added some salsa to the taco sauce.  Next time I will sautee the onions and gp first in some olive oil - they were a bit overpowering for my taste.  But otherwise a super super recipe - try it!

This recipe is awesome! Best enchiladas I have ever had.  We had lots left over and couldn't wait to eat them the next day! They were a lot of work I thought but totally worth it. My finacee loved them as well. I didn't add the water, like previous reviewers and they were still a little soupy but tasted delicous. I also used red enchilada sauce. I will be making these again.

I have made these several times and each time I do, they are a hit.  The only thing I do not add is the water, and even then, they're still a little soupy, BUT, I use the rest of the sauce that is left over, mix it with the taco sauce and pour over the enchiladas before topping with cheese.  Very tasty.  My family likes these much better than the chicken enchiladas with a white sauce.

These were absolutely fantastic!  The filling was a little runny--I think I'll omit the 1/2 c. of water next time.  But other than that, these were a hit at our house!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was so easy! I came out perfect on the first try.  I can usually do taco/fajitas ok, but I had never tried anything like this! I had to fight my husband for the last enchilada (he won though)!  It was great to have him be so excited about my cooking!

Make sure you let this one sit for 10 minutes as the recipe says. I forgot, and they were pretty good. I tried one later on and it was AWESOME. I omitted the water as the other reviews suggested, and used the recipe for Red Enchilada Sauce.

This is absolutely delicious! I omitted the water and used 1/3 of the tomato sauce and lots of extra cheese and 16 oz taco sauce. I mixed some of the extra tomato sauce with jalapeno peppers and mixed with minute rice for a good side dish.
Very Good.
Thank You

This recipe was a hit!  I marinated the chicken in a tequila-lime marinade for a few hours before cooking it and cut the chicken up into much smaller pieces than "cubes".  I also omitted the water...delicious!  Can't wait to make it again!

Delicious! I made it for my husband and for dinner guests, all of whom raved about this dish. It freezes well, also. The only downside is how messy it is to make.

This recipe was wonderful!  I am a college student so I divided it by 4 to cook just for myself and it turned out great.  I also added chile peppers for a little extra kick.  Very easy!

I'm close to leaving this site, nobody rates the recipes, they modify it to their liking and rate it a 5.   This is the worst attemp at chicken enchiladas I have ever tried.  Allrecipe reviews should reflect the original recipes instead of wasting people's time, ingredients , and taste buds.

Confession: I am tired of people reviewing variations on recipes as opposed to the actual, written recipe. AS WRITTEN, this recipe creates a soupy mess, not enchiladas. The flavor is good, and having made it once I'm sure I could come up with my own tweaks to reduce the liquid content. But when a recipe has this many 4 and 5-star ratings, you should be able to trust that the recipe is excellent. It's not.

I think enchiladas should be corn tortillas and burritos are flour. I found this to be edible but, not very interesting.

Really good as a your own starting point. Used (1) jar of 8 oz. taco sauce (no tomato sauce or water) to mix into the the chicken (1 breast & 1 thigh/leg quarter) while cooking as well as a pkg. of taco mix. Still used the sour cream & cheese. I had the ingredients needed but the taco mix made more sense and was cheaper. Used a can of Green Enchilada sauce over the top so I left the green peppers out. Made (9) for a family of (3) (yes having two boys) and I was sold out!

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I make it all the time but I make a lot of changes to improve the texture and flavor. It is an excellent base recipe. My modifications are similar to many of the other reviews: I use salsa instead of the tomato sauce, I omit the water, instead of the green bell pepper I use either a can of green chilies or chop up a few serrano peppers or jalapenos if I have the time and want it hotter, I usually use enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce (the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe from this site usually), and I tend to up the sour cream by a bit and the cheese by a lot. Also, make sure you saute the onions first so that they are soft, not crunchy, and I recommend poaching the chicken and then shredding it. I find it easier and the shredded chicken makes for a nice texture. As for the negative reviews, if you are finding the recipe to be soupy, definitely omit the water. I've never found it necessary to use the water and I've never had this recipe turn out soupy. I can't speak to this recipe's authenticity, which is another common critique. Personally, I love Tex Mex, and this is probably more like Americanized Mexican food than authentic Mexican...it is tasty all the same.

I made this recipe exactly according to the original recipe, except I used fresh parsley instead of dry.  It did seem too watery when the time came to fill the tortillas, so I added some more cheese to try to thicken it up - that did help a little.  I would definitely omit the water if/when I make it again.  The taste is great and you can pretty easily modify it to your tastes.  I think next time I would add some corn and maybe try a different taco sauce (I used Chi Chi's).  I liked the taste but it was a mess to manage.

We made this dish last night. We kept to the recipe except used only 1/3 cup of water. It was still a tiny bit soupy. This was a very tasty dish. Our kids ate every last drop and asked that we make it again. We will. Thanks for posting.

I have been trying to find a Chicken Enchilada recipe that my whole family will eat and have failed until this one.  I did use enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce and water because I had it on hand.  Great recipe!

Excellent and, IF you cook down the water as others have mentioned, just like you'd expect in a Mexican restaurant... but just a little lacking in heat.  I added some cilantro over the filling as I assembled the enchiladas before the oven, and sliced jalapeno (literally as an afterthought) with the cheese in the final topping..works for me!

This recipe it self is alright. I used it as a base to make a much healthier and spicier version for my family. I replaced the sour cream with greek yogurt and made stone ground wheat tortillas and added some habanero pepper in place of the chili pepper along with a generous portion of cumin and paprika in the filling.

These were just alright.  I had high hopes for the sauce as I'm looking for my own enchilada sauce recipe.  The LaVictoria canned sauce is much more flavourful than this was.  The search continues...

Oh My God, YES!!!! These were amazing!!! My brother (a very picky eater) and my 2 year old even loved them.  

Changes:  The only thing I omitted was the 1/2 cup of water because the mixture was already runny enough, and I cooked the peppers and onions along with the chicken so that they would be soft and not crunchy.

great as is, but delete the water. It's better if you add taco seasoning to the chicken and use salsa and taco sauce instead of the tomato sauce. I did  7 oz of taco sauce and 8 oz of salsa. I still used the seasonings suggested in the recipe even though I added the taco seasoning. If you feel it's too overpowering, add more sour cream and cheese. 1/4 cup for both. Also used mexican cheese instead of cheddar and covered it in enchilada sauce (red) not taco sauce. Delish!

This  recipe was good, but for me, not great. I didn't need the water in the sauce mix.  It was thin enough. I like more of a white cheese sauce with my chicken enchiladas, so this was too much red sauce for my liking. But, overall, it was a good recipe. Thank you!

Very good recipe!  However, I used Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles in lieu of the tomato sauce & water.  It was perfect!  Not too runny.  I also did not top the enchiladas with the sauce because otherwise the tortilla shells get too soggy.  I just sprinkled some cheese on top before baking.

I LOVED this recipe, nothing junky in it!! Note to other users, I eliminated the 1/2 c of water on comments that it was too soupy, but when filling the shells, I used a slotted spoon and used the leftover sauce to top the enchiladas when in the pan cutting back on the taco sauce. SO YUMMY! These were a huge hit!

So good!! As others have said, it did come out soupy, but I just used a slotted spoon to fill the tortillas, then poured the liquid over top the filled enchiladas. Like others, I used salsa instead of tomato sauce and a can of green chillies instead of the bell pepper. 

I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was SO GOOD!! I rated this recipe four stars because before making this recipe I took the advice of the other reviewers and omitted the water, substituted salsa for the tomato sauce, canned chopped chiles for green peppers, (we didn't have red enchilada sauce)for the sauce I used spaghetti sauce with chilli powder, and shredded the chicken. I also (advice of the other reviewers)poached the chicken in poultry seasonings, chicken broth, cumin, and minced garlic.

I made this with changes suggested by others. I used one de-boned rotissere chicken in place of chicken breasts. I used 3/4 jar of authentic roasted mexican salsa & 1/2 jar of Taco Bell taco sauce in place of tomato sauce & water. I used a small can of chopped green chilis in place of green pepper.  After assembling the tortillas & filling, I poured homemade enchilada sauce (recipe on this site) over the enchiladas and topped with cheese. It was very authentic tasting and worthy of 5 stars. I will make this recipe again.

Disappointed with myself (for not reading reader reviews first) and the recipe. The tomato sauce and water definitely makes the filling too soggy. Taste is good, however, texture is horrible. Soggy chicken is not appetizing ;o) Also, it would be nice if reviewers rated the recipe as is -- and then added their wonderful recommendations :o) Will definitely try this recipe again with the various recommendations!

Delicious! I poached my chicken in chicken broth for about 25 minutes and shredded it. I decreased the water as per other reviews, but it got so thick that I added it in (with chicken boullion) when it was almost done and let it keep simmering. I used the red enchillada sauce from this site instead of the taco sauce. I added more chili powder and cumin, maybe too much because it was a little spicy for us, but still delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

These were REALLY good--and pretty quick to make.  I forgot the clove of garlic which isn't normal for me, I put garlic in EVERYTHING so I would def do that next time.  I have 2 toddlers so making it spicy wasn't an option, though I did add a can of mild green chiles and some taco seasoning.  I skipped the taco sauce and used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce and from other reviews, didn't see a need for the water.  I will def use this recipe again and I like that it doesn't call for a can of soup.

These were delicious.  My 13 yo son wanted to make this and after reading the revviews we decided to make the recipe as is.  Several reviews were stating it was too runny... we went ahead as written.  YES, the sauce is quite runny.  We used a slotted spoon and added the filling to the tortillas, draining much of the sauce off.  We did make 8 as the recipe calls for - perfect proportion there.  Where we changed it up a bit was to put the remaining sauce in the bottom of the baking dish.  We place the filled tortillas on top and proceed with the recipe - taco sauce and cheese on top of that.  It was REALLY good!  We enjoyed the extra sauce and will make again the same way.  Will be adding jalapenos next time for some heat.

Enchiladas were good but it turned out runny. I think next time I make these I will try some of the suggestions so they don't turn out as runny.

These are the best enchiladas! I didn't put as much onion in it and added a corn and red/green pepper mix. I also simmered the soup mixture for a while to thicken and poured the extra on top of the enchiladas, then added cheese and olives. Added sourcream and brown rice on the side. Delicious!

This was great. I made a few changes just to make it more simple on myself. I poached the chicken and shredded it. For the mixture I mixed sour cream, lots of cheese (mexican mix), onions and some salsa. Then I just used enchilada sauce from a can, Las Palmas I think. That was it. They turned out wonderful. I am used to corn tortilla enchiladas but my boyfriend is white and he demanded flour ha ha ha. But a great recipe.

Delicious!!!  And it CAN be super easy...I bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded it.  I used salsa I already had in the fridge to replace the tomato sauce and water, and I used fresh tortillas from a local Mexican restaurant.  It took me a few minutes to shred the chicken, but everything else was basically a one-pot meal and fast.  LOVE IT!

Great recipe!  I did modify slightly for my family's tastes and based on several reviews.  Used salsa instead of tomato sauce/water and used enc. sauce instead of taco.  Also added lots of fresh cilantro.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

As suggested by others I omitted the water.  I used salsa.  Instead of taco sauce I used enchilada sauce.  Extra cheese was added too.  These were really great.  Not too spicy as I am not a fan of spice.  My husband loved them.

i followed patricks advice, except i still added the sour cream, and chili powder.  it came out real nice, but next time i will leave out the chili powder.  it was just a tad too spicy.  i also think the filling needs some more cheese, but i love cheese, so add to your own taste.  simple to make, and the filling is delicious, and good enough to stand on its own !

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. Using Allison's suggestions (the fourth review listed on the first page with the recipe), the end result was an outstanding crowd pleaser. This will be one recipe I keep forever!

I decided to try this because I didn't have any of the canned sauce,  I'm SOOO glad I did.  This was 10 times better then the canned stuff.  I read through the reviews first and decided to follow the recipe except omitting the water.  I didn't want it too runny.  THis turned out amazing and I will definately make it again.

I used enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce and water (also for the taco sauce).  Everything tasted really good, but very, very salty.  I will try the recipe as written next time for less salt.  Sometimes easier is not always better!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent!  Like others I boiled the chicken and shredded it.  I sauteed the onions and peppers then added the shredded chicken along with the cheese, sour cream and salsa (which I drained to avoid the water-y issue).  I also had a little cream cheese that I threw in- altogether the filling was nice and creamy.  I also used salsa on top and it made for a fabulous, not too runny, quick meal.  This will totally be made again.

I've made this dish a few times and I continue to tweak it but it's a total winner!  I insist on using corn tortillas but next time I'll just layer them and call it an enchilada casserole.  (They crack so easily.)  I used poached chicken breast, shredded; no water; blended red salsa for the tomato sauce; no green pepper, only a small can of mild chopped jalapenos; and a large can of green enchilada sauce.

My family loves this dish. I cheat and buy a rot. chicken from the deli but otherwise I follow the recipe. Both the picky eaters in my house love this w spanish rice. I have even snuck in veggies by blending them and adding to sauce.

Wow, was this ever good. I did tweak the recipe as per other reviewers suggestions. I shredded the chicken, substituted 2 cups of Pace Picante Sauce for the tomato sauce and water, used a small can of diced jalapenos instead of green pepper, and added about 4 tbsp. cream cheese, and 1 can refried beens w/ jalapenos to the filling in addition to the other ingredients (we like it really hot). Used 2 jars of enchilada sauce rather than taco sauce to pour over the rolled enchiladas.  Our grocery store has HUGE chicken breasts so the filling made 11 generously stuffed enchiladas rather than just 8.  I think the filling is good enough to use for a dip for tortilla chips as well...or even eat plain! My husband said these were better than the enchiladas from the Mexican restaurant by us and that is a huge compliment because that is a good restaurant.

Did not add tomato sauce or water.  I put about 3/4 cup salsa into the chicken mixture and topped the whole thing with a can and a half of red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Be warned that this is pretty spicy with all that chili powder but still very good.  My boyfriend thought it was one of the best things I have made but he likes things really spicy.

This was the first meal that I have served in a very long time that everyone loved! It was worth the time it took, and I will definitely make it again. Can't wait! It really was fine without the water- the tomato sauce was enough. I know many of you used pulled chicken instead of diced. I don't know how to pull chicken, or any meat for that matter, but very finely diced worked out well.

These Enchiladas are delicious!  I had a few cooked breaded chicken tenderloins to use for tonight's dinner, so I searched for a yummy, quick & easy recipe.  After reading other reviews I left out the salt, tomato sauce & water.  The chicken was cut into small pieces.  My family now has a new dinner to enjoy and it's made from leftover pieces of chicken.  Yum!

Very easy to make and very delicious!  I didn't add the water in the end because I felt like it was soupy enough.  Also, I was simply lazy and didn't want to roll out the enchiladas so I just layered the tortillas with the mixture and made it into a casserole.  I would definitely make this again.

This were fairly good but not great.  As usual, I didn't do the onion since I don't like the pieces and added a bit of onion powder instead.  I did, however, do all the other stuff including the water, because I tend not to read reviews first.  (I prefer just making the recipe for myself.)  I ended up just letting it cook down some so it wasn't a huge concern.  WAY too much taco sauce, and not because it made it too hot, but just cause it would've smothered them and made them taste like nothing but taco sauce.  All that said, they weren't really spicy, and they weren't really creamy either (another good flavor option for enchiladas) - it's like something was just missing and I don't know what.  But still pretty good.

This was amazing!  I LOVE Mexican food and have struggled to find a chicken enchilada recipe I really like. I boiled the chicken in chicken broth and put it through the food processor to shred it. I omitted the chili powder because I was cooking for my young children. I omitted the water as suggested.   I added 1/2 teasp cumin and 1/2 teasp cilantro. I also used mild enchilada sauce 20 ounces instead of tomato sauce. I probably added more salsa and enchilada sauce on top to keep them moist. It made 12 enchiladas and I put 1/2 in 2 smaller containers to freeze for another meal. I would make it again and again. Love it!!!

this was a good recipe but like others I altered it to my liking and simplicity. I boiled my chicken in chicken stock so it would be juicy. while that was cooking I choped the bell pepper, garlic, onion and spices (to blend equally) in the chopper for faster results. I set that aside and put the cooked chicken in the chopper as well to shred it. I placed the chopped veggies in the skillet and let them cook unitl tender and added the chicken then tomato sauce mixed and then sour cream. I did not add the cheese until i put the mixture into the tortillas, then i added the cheese on top of each individual one i rolled. I also added cumin, salt and more chilli powder while everything was in the skillet to add flavor. turned out good but I think i will try corn tortillas next!! yumm

I made this with similar alterations as suggested by other users.  I used corn tortillas instead of wheat ones, half the sour cream, omitted the water, used salsa instead of tomato sauce, and topped off with enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. My husband and I loved it; since it's just the two of us, I froze the leftovers to use as an instant meal in the next week or two. Definitely a keeper!

I used leftover mexican-spiced fork tender pork in place of the chicken. I also used reduced fat sour cream  and 2% cheddar. I didn't have enough cheddar on hand to use both in the filling and on top, so I used monterey jack in the filling. I also used red pepper instead of green (we don't like green pepper) and I added cumin and coriander to the sauce. Pretty good. I liked that there was just enough sauce and the different kinds of sauces was nice. Next time, I'll use corn tortillas. The flour got a little too mushy.

Delicious!!!! I modified the recipe by (as others have) omitting the water and using only 1/2 can of tomato sauce. I also used a Red Enchilada sauce recipe I found on this website instead of the taco sauce. I didn't have a green pepper, but I had a yellow one, and that worked just fine. I, too, sauteed the pepper, onion, and garlic together before adding it to the mixture. I didn't put chili powder into the enchiladas since I have small children and my husband doesn't like things spicy. (Plus there was chili powder in the enchilada sauce). I also only put about 3/4 cup of cheese in the mixture and 1/2 cup on top (trying to cut out a little fat).  The only thing I'm going to do differently next time is to cook the chicken ahead of time and shred it, it seemed a little chewy cubed. But this recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper.

Okay, made this again following the recipe to a "T" - well except for using enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce - and it came out wonderfully just the way it is! (I actually forgot I had made those other changes....I've got a newborn...so chalk it up to mommy brain. ;-) )

This is super yummy!!!  I dream about these enchiladas.  I have made them several times now and the family loves them.  I have also used leftover beef roast in place of the chicken and that was to die for good as well!!  The only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is the changes that need to be made in regard to the liquids.  I would have gone wrong had I not followed the other reviewers suggestions.  For the filling, I omit the water and use one 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  After the cheese is melted and everything is ready to go, I taste the filling for flavor then add more chili powder, salt or garlic as needed.  I use Rosarita red enchilada sauce on the top instead of the taco sauce and cover with shredded cheese.  Be careful not to overcook - one time I did and they got too dry.  The time in the recipe is perfect.  I have never made enchiladas at home before and I am thrilled to have such a great recipe.  Oh, if you are a sour cream lover, it is a must with this one.  Give it a shot and you will find yourself dreaming about these too.

Great recipe!  Used red enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce and salsa instead of the taco sauce. Very good!

These were great!!! Some of the best enchiladas I have ever made! I also omitted the water, substituted a can of rotel with green chiles for the tomato sauce, enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce, and added some cream cheese to the sauce mix! So creamy and delicious with just the right amount of kick!!

This recipe was wonderful. It was incredibly easy to prepare and the sauce mixture is so tasty. I changed it up a bit because boyfriend forgot to get taco sauce (when he went grocery shopping) so I drizzled a little Sriracha sauce over the enchiladas instead (and under the cheese) before I put them in the oven...to add a bit of spiciness and it was a great idea! Served with Mexican-style corn on the cob. We loved this recipe. Think these are the best enchiladas we've had.  Had left overs and even the left overs tasted much better, I think it was because the sauce must have sunk in to the tortillas a bit more over night, perhaps? Anyway, you should try it!

Very good and tasty! I used leftover chicken, instead of uncooked chicken breasts. It made the meal faster to make, and it tastes great, despite the chicken being leftovers! I love any recipe that makes great use of leftovers!

Everyone enjoyed this dish.  I did find it was a little soupy but that wasn't too big a deal.  I made it as is but used fresh parsley instead of dried as I didn't have it in my cupboard.  My daughter and her friend had never had enchiladas before so I was a little nervous but they both gobbled their servings down.  That's saying something!  This will be a staple in our house.

"Good job, Mom"  -enough said, right?  These were great and they were my first enchiladas (outside of the slow cooker)! Following the general idea of others, I: cooked the cubed chicken in the slow cooker then shredded it, omitted water, added a can of enchilada sauce, a lot of spicy salsa, cumin, taco seasoning, chili powder, and sour cream to the chicken mix. I also used Monterey Jack cheese instead. Next time I will make double and freeze one!

Very good. I would give it more stars but I use Patrick's review (1st under most helpful) for substitutions every time so that really alters the recipe. I always add queso fresco and typically I use a montery jack versus cheddar.

This recipe was wonderful.  I had never made enchiladas before, so I was nervous about how they would come out.  Everyone in my family really loved them, as well as myself.  After reading other reviews, I did not put water.  The consistency for the mixture was perfect without the water.

I changed this a bit. The enchilada sauce they suggest putting on the inside, I poured on the top of the completed tortilla wraps. For the inside, I combined the cooked cubed chicken with the onion and sautéed both until pleasantly aromatic. Then I added 1/4 C cheddar, 1/4 C parmesan, 1/3 C cream of chicken soup, and 1/4 C sour cream, plus salt and pepper to taste. This was THE best filling!!!

These are delicious! I do use a can of tomato paste and a little water in place of the tomato sauce, because I like a thicker mixture inside the enchiladas.

I have tried this two ways: (1) exactly as the recipe is shown, (2) adding cream cheese to the inside mixure to thicken the sauce.  I have to say by adding cream cheese you get an instant thickener with addition of a nice sharp cream cheese flavor.  Otherwise there is a great combination of flavors in this dish.

These enchiladas are AWESOME! Of course, you can make your own changes/additions, but it's a great base. I love the sour cream used as well...however I do use light sour cream.  I followed the recommendation to omit the water, tomato sauce, and the taco sauce. I sauteed onions, jalapenos, garlic adn green peppers...I then added the cooked chicken, a small jar of enchilada sauce, chili powder, oregano, parsley, salt and pepper and heated it up.  I layered white corn tortillas in a baking dish after I had dipped them in water and I made more of a casserole type dish.   IT WAS AMAZING! Next time I'll add even more spice to it, but it was sooo good. Can't wait to have it for lunch today.

I took the advice of other users and substituted the tomatoe sauce/spices with the red enchilada sauce on this recipe site. The enchiladas are rich and creamy.

These are pretty good, not the best but certainly quite good for the skill level needed.  I made it as close to the original recipe as possible and the mix was very runny, had to boil the excess liquid out for quite some time.  Froze a bunch for a healthy frozen enchilada alternative.

Due to varied ingredients that I had, I made some modifications.  I halved everything since I only cook for one.  Boiled the chicken and shredded it.  Combined chicken with the cheese, onion, and sour cream in a large skillet until melted.   Then added a packet of taco seasoning and about half a cup of water. Mixed everything up well.   Added garlic, green pepper, and some green onion. Let heat up for a few minutes.  Added 1 can of enchilada sauce, and cooked all together on low for about 10 minutes.   Then spooned into tortillas, folded, and rolled.   Used a glass baking dish with another half can of enchilada sauce spread over the bottom. Placed in rolled enchiladas. Then covered with remainder of the enchilada sauce and more cheese.   All in all, pretty  good. Easy to make too.

These were the best enchiladas that I have ever had. I have a picky family and everyone liked these...They were even good the next day. The filling was so flavorful, I will diffently be making these again. They will be a favorite in our house now. The only difference that I did was add Las palmas sauce to the mixture, and instead of adding salsa on top and baking them I dipped the tortilla in the sauce mixture to give them flavor and then I stuffed them with the mixture. I added cheese on top and baked them for 20 minutes and they were just perfect...thank you so much for your recipe.

I made this for my husband's birthday party and it was a hit!  I used some suggestions from other reviews, such as: poach the chicken and then shred it instead of chopping it, omit water, replace tomato sauce with salsa, replace green peppers with chopped green chillies, and replace taco sauce with red enchilada sauce.  My husband had requested that I make extra (even before trying it) and they definitely tasted better the next day. Making this dish was very time consuming, but it was sooo worth it!  Also, I feel like it will get easier to make after a couple more times.

I have used the alterations that people suggested.  I don't use any water or tomato sauce, I just use the salsa. I use 1/2 the amount of chili powder as the first time I made them, it was a bit overpowering. Kids and husband love these, as do I. For Weight Watchers, these are 8 points for one, which is awesome as they are pretty filling.

OMGoodness these were the best.  I boiled my chicken for 10 minutes in a bullion cube (instead of salt) & the seasonings and added a little of the chicken water to the mixture instead of 1/2 cup that was called for.  Shredded chicken in food processor to make it easy. Cooked two separate pans.  One spicy and one mild for my families different tastes.  These were awesome.  Thanks for the recipe.

GREAT recipe! Loved all the seasonings, gave it all an awesome variety of flavors!!! I had a lot of mixture so I used a bigger casserole dish and used corn tortillas for that one. Had more leftover so I tried the flour tortillas even though I don't like using flour tortillas with my enchiladas. I used homemade enchilada sauce it was great! I also put some enchilada sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish then set them in. Did a couple improvisions but turned out better than I thought. Served with homemade spanish rice and horchata for dessert. It was lovely!!!!!

Great dish!  We all loved it, including my 3 year old son.  I didn't intend to make any changes but I didn't have taco sauce so I used a mild green chili sauce and it was great!  Thanks for adding a winner to our collection of favorites.

My husband calls this recipe my secret weapon...whenever he is mad at me this is what I make him.  Works miracles.  I too omit the water and use about 8oz of tomato sauce.  I top it with medium picante sauce.  It takes me about 1hr 20 min start to finish.

I didn't use tomato sauce, and just used bottled salsa, and enchilada sauce.  I found the filling way too soupy, and it was a pain to assemble the enchiladas.  It made a mess.  However, it was really tasty, so it was hard to know how to feel.  The next time I made them, I let the filling sit for awhile to thicken, and it was a lot easier to make the enchiladas.

I served this at my husband's football draft party.  I usually make chili and I thought this would be a nice change.  After sampling, I can say that these are OUTSTANDING.  I rolled them in fajita size flour tortillas.  I omitted the water, no surprise there.  I used Margaritaville medium salsa in place of tomato sauce.  I used enchilada sauce in place of taco sauce. Boiled chicken in a bullion cube and shredded.   I made it the morning of the party and put the sauce and cheese on right before putting it in the oven.  I doubled the recipe and there is nothing left.  What a truly wonderful recipe.

I thought these were very good and simple to make. But i omitted the water and let the sauce cook for about 10 minutes in the pan. When they are done make sure you let them sit for 10 minutes because this helps thicken the sauce :)

I love this recipe.  My family loves this recipe.  It is too spicy for my 6 year old so I make him plain chicken wraps.  I also bake the chicken in the oven before dicing it and adding in the skillet.  I have been making it the night before and baking it for dinner.  Like some of the other reviews I use hot and spicy taco seasoning as well as chilli powder.

After planning and purchasing the ingredients I read the reviews.  It seemed to me, however, that the recipe was changed SO much by others that it wasn't even the same recipe any longer.  All the changes made took out the ingredients that I was interested in trying.  To get rid of the watery problem I just cut the water and used 1/2 the tomato sauce.  My family, including my husband who isn't fond of Mexican quisine, loved it.

I loved this recipe. I uses homemade tortillas, and instead of BLSL chicken breasts, I shredded a whole roasted chicken. I kept all of the spices in the filling the same. Instead of jarred taco sauce I made my own using a 15oz. can of tomato sauce, 1 tbsp of chili powder, 2 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder, and a 1/2 tsp of onion powder, all brought to a simmer for about 5 minutes, then poured over the rolled enchiladas. I topped it with a full 8 oz of Monterrrey jack cheese.

Soooo delicious and easy! They tasted just like the enchiladas at our local Mexican Resteraunt. Made them ahead, put in fridge and simply added the cheese and put in the overn before company came over. So simple and worth it!

I didn't use water and reduced the tomato sauce by half.  I did everything else exact.  It was still soupy, but I used a slotted spoon.  My picky husband who hates vegetables said this was the best meal I have made in a long time.  He said the sauce was so delicious and the chicken was nice and tender.  He kept eating it as I did until it was all gone.  I will definitely make this again and again, it was so creamy and delicious!!.   Its easy to prepare, the only thing that really takes any time is frying the chicken and preparing the vegetables!  UPDATE: I made this again using boiled chicken parts from a chicken stock recipe I found on this site. I replaced the tomato sauce with salsa and I also added 1 can of drained diced green chile's for a little pop! Still soupy, but I used a slotted spoon again!  Everything else was exact. It made 8 reg size enchiladas and ten 8 inch ones, a double batch!.  Its so awesome, easier then ever and even more delicious!  Thank you for posting this delicious enchilada recipe!

These were good, but I did make a few minor changes. I substituted salsa for tomato sauce. And also, enchilada sauce for taco sauce. I've always eaten enchiladas wrapped in corn tortillas rather than flour. I think next time I'll try the corn instead. The flour tortillas got mushy.

These come out great - one of my bf's favorites.  We usually go heavy on the onion, and add some chopped hot peppers of whatever kind we have around - green chiles, red, whatever your taste.  And we usually end up using more cheese - sprinkled within and on top.  So tasty!

These were really good Enchiladas.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I too had to make some changes.  I followed others advice and halved the tomato sauce and eliminated the water.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and they were great!  These will be my go-to red sauce enchiladas.

These enchiladas were awesome! I made double because I had some friends come over to dinner and there was barely any left. I used 2 jars of taco sauce. 1 on each pan and found I should have gotten more. Also I did not use the water and I am glad I didn't It ended up turning out great though. Oh, and a tip for people that use corn tortillas. They tend to break when you try to put stuff into them. I tried the suggestion of putting them in oil for couple seconds, but that just turned sloppy. So I used my Filipino friend's trick. Get paper towel wet, ring it out. Place some tortillas in them and wrap them, then put them into microwave for a little bit. Makes them much easier to bend and they wont break.

These were great. I did not add the water either but next time I will. I would have liked to pour the sauce it made over the Enchiladas rather then the taco sauce. Will make again!

This was delicious especially as leftovers!! I used some of the suggestions other members had written in their reviews.  I used roasted chicken from the grocery store and shredded it myself as well as replacing the chopped green pepper with chopped green chiles for extra flavor.  In addition, I used the suggestions Patrick offered with all of the omissions and replacements.  I am only giving this a 4 star because I was not the biggest fan of the chipotle salsa and I think a verde salsa would be better for the inside.  I also think it would be better to use less salsa (possibly 12 oz) and more cheese.

These chicken enchilades taste great! The flavors were absolutely delicious and I had a great time making this with my friend. We experimented by adding some red peppers, using a whole can of chopped tomatoes (instead of the tomato sauce), extra sour cream and cheese (her request, I swear!), green enchilada sauce (replaced the taco sauce) and fresh cilantro (instead of oregano). I have my own ideas in mind, so I can't wait to try this recipe again! We paired it with some yellow rice and were quite full- VERY YUMMY!

These were pretty good although like the other reviewers have commented, they are pretty runny when rolling them up in tortillas...not good when the sauce is hot!  I won't use the tomato sauce next time and I will reduce the water to 1/4 cup.

I sauteed the garlic, onion, and pepper. I used chicken taco seasoning on the chicken. I cooked it on the stove top and finished it by boiling then shredding it. I also used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.

Great recipe!  Took other's advice and did not include water, the filling was perfect.  I used two cans of tomato sauce for filling and one was a Picante which gave it a nice kick.  I also used canned enchilada sauce, two cans.  Perfect!  Word of warning, this is not the typical "cheesy" enchilada, the filling is more creamy, tomatoey.  Good, but not what I was expecting.

Excellent recipe.  Came out delicious.
I did cut back on the amount of tomato sauce & also eliminated the water.  It still had the perfect amount of liquid to keep everything moist.  I used the shredded 4 chs. mexican blend which was yummy.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank U.

AMAZING!!!!  I did cheat a little bit and used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store to cut down on cooking time.  I also had to reduce the chili powder and pepper (my Mom is a spice wimp) but the recipe is still delicious!!!!

I doubled the green pepper and omitted onion (forgot to buy it).  The chicken/cheese/tomato sauce mix simmered for almost an hour since my Mom was late leaving work--the extra cook time allowed all the flavors to mix and meld together wonderfully.  We did add a can of black beans and will probably add some corn or spinach next time.

The recipe makes plenty of the center filling--enough that I froze 1/3 to make another batch later and another 1/3 as the base for chicken tortilla soup in the fall!

Great recipe, can be played with to suit everyone's taste!!!  A definite one to repeat!!!!!

YUM!  EASY!  I omited one can of tomato sauce and the water.  I accidently added the taco sauce to the filling rather than the end, so I used the extra sauce in my pan to cover the enchiladas at the end.  My fiance and I downed them and had plenty left for the next lunch (or few)!  I served this with a mixture of whole kernel corn and creamed corn, and a side of Mexican Rice II.  Since I bought a 10 pack of tortillas instead of an 8 pack, I made the Cinnamon Sugar Tortilla Delight for dessert with the extras.  CHEAP and EASY!

I really liked this recipe. I used frozen grilled chicken strips to save some time. I also used the taco seasoning in place of the jar  taco sauce. It was rather soupy, by really good overall. Great job!

I liked this recipe and will use this recipe again but play with the spices. It was a little spicy for me, and I would probably cut out the chili pwdr all together (the enchilada sauce I used was plently spicy). I used corn tortillas instead of flour and traded the green peppers for mushrooms. I was happy to find a chicken enchilada recipe that didn't call for cream of chicken soup.

This recipe was out of this world. The only thing I did different was not use the water as it seemed to have plenty of liquid without it, and I cubed the chicken before cooking it instead of after. Made with Mexican Rice II from this site, and some refried beans. Yum! *UPDATE* I just had to come back and comment on this recipe one more time. I now make this at least once every 2 weeks. My family demands it. It is THAT good! I have a picky stepson (grown man) who hates sour cream and gets mad if anyone gets it near him. I tricked him one day while he was visiting and had him try a bite, not telling him it had sour cream in it. After he tried the bite, I told him it did have sour cream in it and he still ate 2 enchiladas. That is truely saying something as he despises sour cream. Long story, but yea, this recipe is amazing. Also, I have now started using mild salsa to top it with instead of the taco sauce.

This recipe is FABULOUS!! My husband said these were the BEST chicken enchiladas he has ever had....and he's had quite a few (and he's VERY picky)!  I did modify the recipe a bit. I used the Crisco chicken enchilada sauce recipe (instead of the sauce in this recipe)-I added about 3/4 of a cup of the Crisco sauce to the chicken mixture and used the rest under and on top of the enchiladas prior to cooking. I did not use ANY taco sauce either. I also BOILED 5 chicken breasts in canned chicken broth. Instead of green pepper, I used one can of green chiles. And I only had about half a cup of cheddar cheese on hand, so I used monteray jack to make up the difference. I also used half sour cream/half whipped cream cheese, which makes it nice and creamy! I did not use any parsley or oregano. Next time I might add some fresh cilantro if I have some. Also, I served these with sour cream and black olives on top. YUMMY!!

This recipe was not easy to make, and it had WAY too much onion in it. I didn't even put in a whole onion because I knew my husband wasn't the biggest fan of them. I'm definitely not making this again, sorry. :(

We loved this!  I made some of the previously recommended revisions to the recipe: omitted water, used enchillada sauce instead of taco sauce, and green chiles instead of bell pepper.  I also substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and it was great!

These turned out really well. I omitted the green pepper and the water, reduced the cheese on top, and sprinkled the finished enchiladas with cilantro. Everyone enjoyed them and thought they looked beautiful with the red, yellow, and green colors. They weren't very spicy, so we added jalapeno slices and hot sauce at the end. I like using taco sauce on top because it tasted good, it's easier than making your own, and I don't enjoy the taste of canned enchilada sauce. It only took about 40 minutes from start to finish. It shouldn't take as a long as the recipe suggests.

My husband ate them for dinner, lunch the next day, and dinner...basically he ate and ate until they were gone!  Amazing recipe.  Skipped the water and used 1/2 the tomato sauce.  Used the 10 minute enchilda sauce from this site.  Perfect.  Kids loved them too!

absolutely delicious. came out perfect. i made it for my brother and boyfriend, they couldn't stop talking about it all week. next time i'm going to use less water and less sour cream, and add corn to the mix. i'd use a whole bell pepper...1/3 cup just isn't enough in the ratio. overall, i'm adding this one to my personal collection.

I don't eat meat, but I made this for my boyfriend and he liked it quite a bit. The changes I made were as followed: I added 1/2 a packet of spicy taco seasoning along with the sour cream and tomato sauce. I omitted the spices and the water. I also used enchilada sauce rather than the taco sauce. It was a big hit!

Amazing dish!  I did take the recommendation of another reviewer and I used chopped up stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and also threw in some green chiles and this was incredible!  I'm not a huge mexican food fan but I wanted to try something different and this is truly a keeper and even something to share when entertaining.  It was a lot quicker to make than it seemed, too.  I will be putting this into our dinner rotation.  Thanks so much!

THIS WAS GREAT!!! The only modifications I made were the following: Instead of the green pepper I use green chilies, Monterey jack, 2 Tbsp chili powder, refried beans, 1/2 jar tomato sauce, enchilada sauce in place of the salsa, 5 Tbsp of cream cheese.  I served with red beans and rice, cornbread and served them on a bed of shredded lettuce and topped them with salsa and sour cream.  Thank You so much for a great, great meal.

I can't give this recipe 5 stars because I didn't do the recipe as written. First I boiled the chicken breasts in seasoned water and shredded the meat. Cubed meat in an enchilada just didn't appeal to me. Then I took the advice of others and omitted the water, used half of the tomato sauce, and used ench sauce. I made these on a weekend and froze them, then Wednesday I thawed them and put them in the oven for an easy dinner.They were really yummy!

Really great recipe. I did as some of the other reviewers suggested, omitted the water and cut the tomato sauce in half. I had some of the chicken mixture left over and poured it on top of the tortillas and added a little less of the taco sauce. I used American cheese, since that is what I had in my fridge, and the recipe was really good.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Great recipe. I also thoughtthe sauce was a bit runny, so I reduced it a bit. I had lots of leftover sauce, so I used it on top instead of taco sauce. Yummy!

amazing!!!  The filling is what is killer in this recipe.  For a filling with more depth...shred the chicken instead of cubing it!  I want some now!
PS...didn't use a full can of tomatoe sauce though

The taste of the final product was good, but assembly was difficult as the filling was really, really runny.  I actually skipped the taco sauce on top and instead used the leftover sauce from the filling on top instead.  Next time I would skip adding the water.

Great Recipe, my husband loved it and even ate up all the left overs and still wanted more. I didn't add the water, and next time will try adding some hot peppers for a little more kick.

Very good enchiladas! I left out the sour cream and it was great but very spicy. Next time I would decrease the chili powder just a bit.

I almost made the recipe as is, except I used reduced fat cheese, low fat sour cream and red peppers instead of green, and omitted the water. These came out great, the whole family loved it and requested it again!

This was a nice recipe.  I had to make a substitution.  For the topping I mixed 1 can cream of chicken, 1/2 pint sour cream, and a cup of shredded cheese.  The filling was great! Everyone really liked this one!

Delicious!!  I just began cooking myself, so I also make modifications to recipes as I go to suit our tastes.  I used Packerbacker's suggestion and went with green chiles instead of green pepper, added more cayenne and completely omitted the taco sauce.  I also added extra cheese but I almost needed two pans!  It's a great thing my husband is a big eater and when I make something this good, there aren't any left-overs!  The results were fabulous, and this recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

Seeing as that I was born and raised in Texas I grew up with having the best Mexican food.  Now that I live in NC I crave it constantly and the closest I can find is Taco Bell.  Now, if you're looking for that authentic taste this is not the recipe for you.  However, it is VERY good.  After reading a ton of the reviews I did change some things.  I think the biggest thing that I changed was I poached/boiled the chicken in a bunch of spices (which included Old Bay Seasoning, dried parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, and a packet of chicken bouillon).  After the chicken was cooked through I shredded it and then went on with the recipe.
CHICKEN: I used crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and also added a small can of enchilada sauce.  I omitted the water, bell peppers, and taco sauce.  I also added about two tbls. sugar (divided between chicken and sauce) because the enchilada sauce I bought was medium instead of mild.  I also added a tsp. paprika.
SAUCE: I used another small can of enchilada sauce with more sour cream and crushed tomatoes.
I served it with refried beans which I think I will include inside the enchiladas next time.

Fabulous! I to omitted the water and substituted the taco sauce for Enchilada sauce and garlic salt for reg, salt. I used a combination of salsa and diced tomato for the tom. sauce. I used half sour cream and half cream chicken soup. I seasoned it up a bit with fesh cilantro, white pepper, crushed red pepper, cumin and onion powder. 
I to put a bit of sauce in the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking as well as freazing the left over Enchiladas! This is now a weekly specila request in my house!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!!  Very easy to make and tasted great!  I will definitely be making this one again.  The only thing I will do differently next time is perhaps add a little more chicken.  The recipe called for 4 chicken breasts--I had 3 chicken breasts that weighed over a pound total, so I thought it would be fine but there was just a bit of extra sauce.  I also did not add the water that the recipe called for, which would have made it really soupy.  I made this with the Spanish Rice II recipe from this site and they were an awesome pair!

This was very good. My family really enjoyed it. I read the reviews before making and left out the water as suggested. I agree it would have been to soupy with the water, it was still a little messy putting together. I left it bake longer also until it was bubbling in the center about 35 minutes. I diffently will make again.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I made it exactly as described except left out the green bell pepper.  I had extra sauce left over after making the enchiladas, so I made noodles and used the extra sauce over the noodles.  My entire family loved it!

This was SO good!  I made it with my boyfriend last night - not only was it fun to make together but just as fun to eat!  I followed the advice of others and made a few changes.

1.  I left out the water.  It was a good consistancy
2.  I used 1/2 can tomato sauce and 1/2 can salsa
3.  I used all the Chili Poweder and I also added 1 chopped green jalapeno - SPICY but great!  Just the perfect spicey level...

It makes 8 really large enchillads so make sure you're hungry.  I couldn't get down more than 1/2!!  Just follow the instructions, leave out the water, and change things to your taste and you'll be SURE to have a nice hot delicious meal!

Tomato sauce?  Water?  Don't use them.  Sub enchilada sauce for the Tomato sauce.  You'll need three cans at least. I used four and it turned out great.  It's up to you on the thickness of the sauce. (You can also kick it up a little with some spicy sauce).  We also cooked the chicken with some extra peppers. Yes, we like it a bit on the hot side.  However, the sour cream gave it a very nice touch and softens the hot peppers.

We love this recipe.  I followed other recomdations by omitting the water, replacing the tomato sauce with salsa, replacing bell pepper with green chilies, and using enchilada sauce on top.  I also only used half of an onion(I am not a big onion fan), and added some cumin.  I was worried about the mixture being too soupy, but it became perfect in the oven.

This recipe was very easy.  I cheated and used a Rotisserie chicken that I cut up!  I did use the water and it came out fine.  A little soupy but once baked it wasn't an issue - just made prep a bit sloppy.  I added some black beans and olives and it was tasty.  I also used Salsa rather than taco sauce.  I would make this again.  Husband loved it.

great! suggestions are to omit the water, cut the chili powder in half (unless you like really spicy!).  it was great and stores well for leftovers.

I actually just joined All Recipes just so I could comment on this recipe. It was excellent! I tweaked it a little bit so I could reduce calories and fat. I used lean ground turkey & I had to add 1/2 a taco seasoning packet to liven up the turkey a bit more. I forgot to put in the tomato sauce- oops. (didn't notice that until now) Of course I lightened up on the sour cream and used whole wheat tortillas as well. I also put in some fresh sweet corn and topped it with cilantro. I then paired it with Mexican/Spanish Rice (yellow rice, olive oil, green & red pepper, cilantro, corn). My husband thought it was wonderful- and coming from him - it was a really great compliment. This recipe will remain in our house for years. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was delicious. The only things I changed was no tomato sauce and no water. I used enchilada sauce instead, and I topped it with a medium salsa instead of taco sauce. Otherwise a keeper!

This was good with modifications. Don't add water, use enchilada sauce instead of taco, and use corn tortillas, not flour. I also sauteed the onions first and used canned green chilis instead of bell peppers. I like things spicy so I also added a little cayane pepper and a splash of Tobasco. I served them for ocmpany and got lots of compliments

I am notorious for screwing up recipes, so when I told my boyfriend and my dad to come over for Chicken Enchiladas they were a bit hesitant. They could not stop raving about how great it was. The look on their face upon taking the first bite was priceless. I followed the recipe except I used diced tomatoes and green chiles instead of tomato sauce, I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, and corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas (as others have suggested). Whoever said the flavor was "bland at best" needs to consult with a doctor. These enchiladas definently had great spicy taste to them. I will be making these for years to come.

We absolutely love this recipe.  I was only able to buy 12" flour tortillas so I put filling in each and rolled them with sides tucked in as you would for a sandwich wrap.  They fit perfectly into two 8"x8" pans.  I cooked them both then we ate one and the other went into the freezer. MMMM good.  Thanks Debbie

These were good.  I halved the recipe, used enchilada sauce (canned) instead of taco sauce, and used an orange bell pepper instead of green.  If I make them again, I will not used canned tomato sauce.  It gave the enchiladas a weird taste--kind of like canned ravioli.  This is not the fault of the recipe, of course, just a personal preference.  Overall tasty, easy, and good.

What a hit!  Yum!  I've already made it twice and I'm serving it at a dinner party.  I used low-fat sour cream and the Mexican blend of shredded cheeses.

These are the best! Definitely going to make again..I didn't add the water and only used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I don't usually eat a lot of onions, but it was soooo good in this!

I threw the whole bell pepper in, and that tasted fine.  These were great.  They were not too hot for my 20 month old son, which surprise me.  To me, a good enchilada is a good enchilada.  So we'll make them again.

I am a huge enchilada fan but I have to say that this was something that I had a hard time serving to my husband.  I used ground beef but I doubt that was the issue.  I didn't use the water but added dice tomato and twice the amount of chili powder.  Overall, I don't like the consistency and the flavor is bland.  I played with it a little adding cream cheese and green onion..It's honestly just one of the few recipes I've tried that I couldn't do a thing with.  It might make a nice base for tortilla soup though :)

This was an awesome dinner! It was quick and easy and super yummy! I substituted a can of Rotel and a can of enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce and taco sauce. I also used left over turkey instead of chicken.

Ohhh, this was good!  My family is a pain in the butt, cause they are so picky.  Everyone gave this one a thumbs up and rated it a "keeper" and not a "loser."  Just used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, shredded the chicken instead of cubing it.  Otherwise kept the recipe about the same.  Served it with sliced avocado and more sour cream.  Thank you for a KEEPER Debbie!!!

This recipe is AWESOME!! The first time I made it was for a group of single soldiers that served in Iraq with my husband. It was their first meal once they returned. They all LOVED it. I was asked to make it several times after that. It is still one of my husbands FAVORITES!! I have recommended it to all our family and friends.

Great receipe to follow.  I used the chicken left over from the Simple Whole Roasted Chicken receipe on this site, and put in the onion and green pepper and let it warm up in the skillet with the seasonings.  Then added the cheese and sour cream, put the top on and let it melt.  I did not use the 15oz can of tomato sauce or water.  I used about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the Red Enchillada Sauce on this website since I wanted my filling more thick than tomato saucy.  Placed the filling in the shells and baked them as directed with the rest of the Red Enchillada Sauce and 3/4 cup of cheese and was DELICIOUS.  I will make this again and again and again.  My husband was still talking about it the next day.  Thanks for a great receipe.

I made this recipe last night and was very impressed. They looked and tasted just like restaurant enchiladas. My husband loved them as well. Definitely a keeper!
UPDATE!!!!!!
I made these again last night, but marinated the chicken in mojo first. It was really good. But, that added enough spice that I could have decreased some of the other spices as well. But, turned out perfect as always!!

Read a lot of reviews for this one and took a lot of advice.  I also poached and shredded the chicken.  I substituted mild chunky salsa for the tomato sauce and omitted the green pepper, garlic & onion but added the rest of the ingredients.  I also diced a couple of green chile peppers and added to the mixture.  I used the recipe from this site called Red Enchilada Sauce (very easy to make and the taste is so good)  Made with 7 - Layer Dip from this site and had a nice Mexican meal.  Thanks Debbie

I really did not care for this recipe.  The chicken mixture looked very unappetizing before you even filled the enchiladas.  

I guess I'm practically by myself on this, but I would not make again!  Sorry.

This is an excellent recipe that I make every couple of weeks.  I like to add black olives, which I scatter over the top after baking.
You can't go wrong with this recipe.
UPDATE:  I've found that Pace Enchilada Sauce is much better on this than taco sauce is.  I also omit the water called for and often substitute diced, chili-spiced tomatoes for the tomato sauce.  I still love this recipe.

Good recipe and very easy. I did make some changes as suggested in other reviews, omitted the water, used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, and used green chiles instead of green peppers.

I made this recipe a 5 * by using the enchilada sauce from this website under Crisco Chicken Enchiladas and adding the green chilis.  Excellent.

I loved how easy it was to reduce the calories in this recipe (I used fat free cheese, fat free sour cream, and low carb wheat tortillas).  I took others' tips and left out the water, as well as reducing the tomato paste.  It came out great!  Easy to roll up and flavorful (I used red pepper flakes and it had plenty of zing).  I also used enchilada sauce to make it more authentic.  Overall, nice taste and appearance, even for a Texan.  The only thing I truly didn't like were the onions.

SUPER YUMMY!  It's a big recipe, but don't count on left-overs!  TRUST the suggested spices... oregano really is a mexican herb.  It's in a lot of authentic dishes and definately gives this dish a great flavor.  I also agree with using taco sauce.  Enchilada sauce is too sour for my family.  For quick SHREDDED CHICKEN(holds sauce better), poach chicken breasts, cut into large chunks, and wizz in the food processor for a couple of pulses.  Also, for a SHORT CUT, use a cup or so of salsa to replace the onion, salt, water, and green bell pepper.

instead of green peppers i added half a small can of jalapeno peppers, and cut back on the tomato sauce.  i do not care for red enchilada sauce (homemade nor store bought) so i topped the enchiladas with a white cheese sauce from another recipe.  2 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 cup flour, 1 1/4 cups milk, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, ground black pepper.  melt butter and stir in flour, cook for 1 minute.  gradually stir in the milk and stir until the sauce boils and thickens.  then add the cheddar cheese and stir until it melts into the sauce. YUMMY!

This is definately a top-notch recipe!  I have made it more than once, and my family loves them!  Yes, there are some modifications that I do make, however.  DO NOT ADD THE WATER!!!  And I have also found that if you add tomato paste (one of the smallest can's you can find of it, I believe 4 oz? because it is much more concentrated than the sauce) your filling will be much thicker, and you won't have to boil it down as much.

We didn't really like the taste much; we have quite a bit left over.  We followed some of the reviewers' suggestions, 8 oz tomato sauce and little water.  I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  I agree with another reviewer that there was too much sour cream.

EXCELLENT!!  I too changed this recipe--only used 8oz of tomatoe sauce, no water.  When cooking the meat I used garlic salt and garlic pepper--used Old Elpaso taco sauce--it was excellent--no leftovers.

This was really good. I made few changes: I added a can of green chilies and I omitted the water. It would have been runny with it added. I boiled the chicken and then shredded it. Also, used more cheese. Will definitely make again!!

Excellent.. I followed other reviews and omitted the water and used a can of enchilada sauce to coat the pan and top the enchiladas and they were perfect. I may make them a little spicer next time but overall these are great and easy.

This recipe is excellent.  I have never made enchiladas before and they turned out GREAT.  My husband absolutely loved them.  I read the other reveiws before I made them so I took the advice of others and did not any water and cut the tomato sauce by half.  I also used marble cheese and probably doubled what the recipe called for.  I also boiled the chicken first and shredded it with a fork.  This recipe in my opinion is a true five star recipe and a definite keeper.  Thanks Debbie for a delicious recipe.

This was easy and delicious. I varied the recipe by cooking the onion, green pepper, and some fresh garlic in a little oil. Then I added canned enchilada sauce (hot) and used broth for the water. I agree that too soupy a mixture makes for difficult rolling of the tortillas. I poured the rest of the enchilada sauce over the enchiladas before baking. I'll make this again!

My sister and I made this dish together to bring to a potluck. We even substituted regular sour cream with low-fat sour cream and regular cheeses with lower-fat cheeses and it still tasted delicious! I swear, no one could tell the difference! The harshest of food critics just loved it! It was a total success!

Best Chicken enchiladas I ever made....no need for the water, and lighten up on the sour cream so the mixture is not so runny.  Use the remaining sauce to pour over them before baking.  I would do a double batch......they are so good you will wish you had more leftover.

I read other reviews and omitted the water and didn't use all of the tomato sauce. I still had to drain the filling to put it in the tortillas. I used red sauce instead of taco sauce to pour over the enchiladas. They turned out perfect. I served them at a new year's eve party. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. I would only point out that this isn't really so much an enchilada, as a chicken burrito covered in cheese and sauce. While it may not technically be enchiladas, it was still delicious. Will definitely make it again.

This turned out realy well.  We used corn tortillas rather than flour and we just layered it more like a lasagne than an enchilada, but the flavor was the same and it was a lot faster!  We were all impressed with how well the cheese and sour cream brought the flavors of the dish together.

This was my first time making enchiladas and they turned out great!  My husband raved and asked for leftovers for lunch for two days.  I omitted the water and halfed the tomato sauce as was suggested by other reviews.  I think next time I will try adding veggies such as brocolli and corn.

Yummy.  I used leftover cubed chicken to speed things up.  I garnished it with cilantro.

I used 8oz of tomato sauce instead of 15. Also I poured enchilada sauce on it instead of taco sauce.

You impressed my husband with this one. And he is very hard to please. He told me I have to make this again. I will use less chili powder next time.  It was a little to spicy for me. Other than that I thought it was good. When I served them they looked what you get in a reasturant.

I loved the enchiladas. They were very tasty. The one problem is they are a bit time consuming and make a bit of a mess, but it is well worth it. They are a regular in my house now.

Perhaps we don’t all like our chicken enchiladas made the same way.  I’ve had them in Texas and California and several places in Mexico.  These are wonderful.  Different than some others I’ve had, but delicious nonetheless. Let’s just try to leave constructive reviews, and really not be mean and rude.

Excellent dish. Just follow the suggestions that others posted to tweak this recipe. Eliminate the water. I took another tip and submitted the tomato sauce for taco sauce and salsa instead  (about 25 oz to 27 oz of liquid. 30 oz as suggested is to much). My husband raved about these enchiladas. Will definitely make again. So yummy!

I should have read the reviews first because I, too, ended up with a soupy mess and had to cook the liquid down.  There was a bit too much chili powder in it for our tastes.  Overall, it just didn't seem to taste right, but I put it together and put it in the oven.  About three minutes later, I decided I should have added cream of chicken soup.  I took it back out of the oven, diluted the soup with about a half can of water and poured it over the top.  It helped some not enough to tempt me into making it again.  Oh, and the tortillas all stuck to the bottom of my pan so I needed to chisel them free.  If I'd added the soup before I put the tortillas in the pan, that wouldn't have happened.

This recipe is a keeper!
I will say that I made a few major changes: 1st, I poached the chicken breasts in half chicken broth and half water with a bay leaf and crushed garlic and 1 tsp of salt. I also more shredded it than cubed it.  2nd, I subbed in enchilada sauce in place of the taco sauce and 3rd, I subbed in mild chunky salsa in place of the tomato sauce (roughly same amounts).  Lastly- 4th, I omitted the water, as I found it unnecessary. 
Everything else in the recipe I kept the same.  I served it with refried beans and yellow rice on the side, and it was a hit! Will definitely be making his again!

This is also a great "make ahead" recipe so you can just pop it in the oven when you get home from work.    I add chopped black olives and jalapenos.   I've also switched out the sour cream for plain yogurt.  Cannot tell the difference at all.

Thank you Jillian for the  recipe modifications! It turned out delicious. Here are the changes: 
These were incredible! For the filling I skipped the tomato sauce and water and used an 8 oz. jar of taco sauce instead. I also used a 4 oz. can of green chilis instead of green pepper. Also 1/2 pint of sour cream equals 1 cup. I used about 3/4 cup and Mexican blend cheese instead of Cheddar. I topped the whole thing with a 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce mixed with about 1/4 cup of half and half to make it nice and creamy!

In the middle of making this and 'soupy mess' is correct!  I am standing here thinking just how am I supposed to put this into a tortilla and roll it up.....haha ...NOT!  Next time, if I do try it again will cut down on the liquid.  Should be called Enchilada Soup

I think this is a fantastic recipe!  The only thing I do different is omit the sauce in the mixture that gets rolled in the tortilla.  I leave the rest of the filling the same and simply pour the sauce over the top before baking.  Sometimes for convenience I will use canned enchilada sauce too.  Overall this is a great recipe and I have made this over and over again!

I had about 6-7 left over cooked chicken thighs and legs that I had baked in the oven a couple days before. I didn't have the heart to throw them out and knew they wouldn't taste good if I just heated them up, so, I decided to make chicken enchiladas with them. I took the skin off  and then I pulled the chicken off off all the bones and shredded it apart with my hands so there weren't any big chunks. I didn't use water and tomato sauce and instead put taco sauce into the skillet. Also added some garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika to the skillet mix. For the topping enchilada sauce, I poured a packet of enchilada sauce I prefer that I buy from my local grocery store. This came out... AUHHHH-MAA-ZING!  Ten stars if I could. Just looking at the picture I posted makes my mouth water. My husband and I devoured them.

Absolutely delicious! Instead of using chicken breast as the recipe originally called for, I bought a rotisserie chicken and cubed it. It added incredible flavor to the dish!

Don't feel bad LadyBugMama, The first time I made this, it turned out to be a flop!  and I am a professional cook! that's my job.  My husband made this and it turned out spectacular!! What gives? We both followed the recipe.  He told me that it "needed a 'man's' touch."  WOW - - OK - - Yah.

These enchiladas were incredible! I used homemade tortillas and taco sauce. Followed the recipe almost exactly. No modifications needed for me, just used less than 1/2 cup water. It`s definitely a keeper!

Omg hello from Orlando. I just made this for dinner tonight and my husband and loved it. It is so super good. I didn't add the water to the recipe to avoid the soupy mess that Patrick spoke about. This is a must try.

I made this for the first time 2 months ago. Since then my family has requested it 2 additional times. The downside is instead of using the taco sauce we used salsa because of the recall on the taco sauce. We do not add the water and my hubby thickens it with cornstarch so it isn't so soupy.  This is a great recipe in my opinion.

This is in the oven now, so I don't know about taste yet, but the filling was super runny.  If I make this again, I will leave out the 1/2 cup water and probably half of the tomato sauce.  I couldn't roll the tortillas because my (hot) filling was running out all over my hands.

ok so i always read reviews BEFORE trying a new recipe. So the 5 stars is NOT for the exact recipe posted but because my husband LOVED what I made! ;) So heres what I did:
i poached my chicken using red wine vinegar, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, minced garlic, salt, pepper and onion powder. I shredded the chicken and then I put some olive oil in a skillet and put the chicken, chili powder, pepper, salt, sour cream, parsley and oregano. I SKIPPED the water and tomato sauce. instead I added 1/4 cup of salsa and 1 can UNDRAINED rotel tomatoes and added a little more cheese :)
Then rolled them in the tortillas used ENCHILADA sauce instead of taco sauce. cooked as according to the original recipe. served with sourcream on top and a little extra cheese and a side of yellow rice and jalapeno poppers. YUMMY!!!

Delicious!  Substituted tomato sauce and water with jar of enchilada sauce. Omitted chili powder as it was spicy without it.  Will definitely make again.

READ REVIEWS FIRST! I wish I had. As is, this recipe is nothing to get excited about, but with the modifications recommended by reviewers I think it would be what the overall number of stars would have you believe.  I'll try this once more using the advice given in other reviews.

So good!! I made some changes as I cannot handle spicy food and my husband dislikes bell pepper.. I replaced the tomato sauce, water, chili powder and green bell pepper with pace mild picante sauce. If you make 8 servings I would use one jar (I think about 16  oz) of the picante sauce. Also did not use the taco sauce to top the enchiladas. Very good and super easy to make. I had everything in the fridge to make this. Also extra cheese ;)

I have made this recipe several times for my family, and it has been a huge hit with the whole crew each time.  For me, that is really saying something because it is a rare recipe indeed that satisfies the ultra-picky palates of my guys.  This is one of the few things I can make that everyone will eat and enjoy.

I never knew I could make enchiladas!  I used salsa instead of tomato sauce, skipped the water, and used red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  I also used a can of diced green chilis instead of green peppers. Super easy.  I cooked the chicken on the Foreman grill.  This made enough for about 10 enchiladas that night, and I think the leftovers in my freezer will make another 10!

I just cooked this for over 50 people and it was amazing! The only thing i did differently was that I had to use salsa instead of tomato sauce but it was amazing anyway.  Thanks from me and the rest of the staff here at summer camp for such a delicious and easy recipe

This was delicious. I left out the bell peppers and made it with ground turkey rather than chicken. I also left out the taco sauce and just topped it with cheese. They were wonderful!

Great recipe! I added some yummy tortilla chips on the side to counter the spicyness and scoop up the rest of the filling that oozes out. Thanks for sharing!

Just ignore the water and tomato products. Serve salsa on the side instead. I'm only giving it a 3 because you have to read through the comments to get the "real" 5 star recipe

I liked this recipe. Then I made a second batch with a couple of tweaks of the recipe. 1st: I boiled the chicken in salt water and when it was done I shredded it. 2nd: I used green enchilada sauce and Jack cheese to top. My family and I thought this version was a lot better. Give it a shot you might think so to.

I make this for church potlucks and always get asked for the recipe. To make even it easier, put frozen chicken breast and a couple cups of water in a slow cooker in the morning and that evening the breast will shred easily. I too omit water and add a jar of Pace picanti sauce instead of the tomatos. I add shredded cheddar and pepperjack cheese also.

This recipe was a great hit. My family loved dinner. I did leave out the water and to make it healthier used light sour cream, whole wheat flour tortilla and reduced fat cheddar cheese they couldn't tell the difference. Thanks for the great recipe.

The flavor is good (especially for the kids), the recipe is easy and quick to make (if you get things laid out and form an assembly line), and lets face it...how can you go wrong with all that cheese.

This is my goto recipe when I can't think of anything else to make. Just awesome! I leave out the water though, cause it does make a soupy mess if you add it.

Delicious recipe. I used the liquid that my chicken breasts cooked in instead of water and added some cilantro and more garlic to the mixture before baking it.  To serve of course i chopped more cilantro n sprinkle over the top!

If you have given this recipe a 4 or 5 then you have not had good enchiladas before. Maybe this is how they cook enchiladas in Canada. This is one of those recipe's you chalk up as sub par. They weren't the worst but I won't be using this recipe again.

Mushy, tasteless. I recommend that the water and tomato sauce be left out, and add more cheese... I used a cheddar/ pepper jack mixture that gave it SOME flavor. Next time will use more!

With these additional ingredients (Scaled to this serving size), this recipe was AMAZING. I added:

- add 1/2 cup corn
- 3 whole green chiles, chopped
- 2 canned chipotle chiles, minced
- 1/2 tspn mexican spice blend (Cook the chicken for 5 minutes with this spice, and then shred it into the mixture later on)
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 1 tsp garlic powder

Takes some time, but totally worth it.

It was great and easy to make. I did substitute the tomato sauce with salsa and topped the rolled enchiladas with mild enchilada sauce. I also poached my chicken in chicken broth and herbs and shredded it when cooled. I served it with shredded lettuce on the side and sour cream. Soo delicious and so fulfilling!!

Very good recipe.  I followed a few of the other reviewer comments.  I covered the chicken with a taco seasoning packet and baked.  After shredding the chicken I followed the directions, but omitted the taco sauce and water and added diced tomatoes (drained).  I then topped the dish with Enchiladas sauce.

This meal was a huge hit! While I was cooking in the pan it was a soupy as other reviews say. However I let it boil for a good 15 to 20 mins and it got thicker as it cooked longer. I then put in the oven.

The flavor of these was great. I did find them too wet to roll, so next time I will follow others reviews. I will cut back on the water and tomato sauce, but other than that they were really good.

Loved it!  Based on some of the other reviewers, I omitted the water and tomato sauce and added chunky salsa.  I also omitted the green peppers and added a small can of green chiles.  I used mexican cheese instead of cheddar, just seems more authentic.  This dish was so tasty.  It has been added to my top five dishes!!!

These turned out great and were very easy.  I made a few variations that others suggested (used salsa vs. tomato sauce, used chilles instead of bell pepper, used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce).  I actually cooked the filling in the crockpot so that the chicken would fall apart vs. cubing.  This also helped infuse flavor.  Next time I make this the one change that I will make is corn tortillas vs. flour.  I agree that I've never had an enchilada in a restaurant that uses a flour tortilla.  I know that flour tortillas are easier to work with than corn, but these were fairly easy and slightly more effort on the rolling would be worth it for me.

This recipe was very delicious! I made a few modifications: added cheese inside the enchiladas, used garlic powder, onion powder and Cajun seasoning. I also substituted the taco sauce for enchilada sauce and it still turned out good :-)!!! Will make these again.

Great recipe. You cant go wrong with enchiladas, there are so many different varieties. However, loved the taste for this one...putting the sour cream in was ideal. Def will make again.

I modified this recipe based on some of the reviews and my family and I loved it. 
I poached chicken tenders and shredded. Sauteed onion in olive oil and added chicken to skillet. I omitted the oregano, since it is an italian spice and didn't seem to fit. Reduced amount of pepper, used 3/4 jar of our favorite salsa ( On the Border) in place of the tomato sauce and omitted the green pepper. I omitted the water and cooked down the chicken mixture to prevent any "soup-like" consistency as mentioned in other reviews. Filling was perfect! I spread some of the taco sauce in the bottom of the dish, then added the enchilada's, topped etc. We gobbled these up...so good! Definitely adding to our dinner rotation. TY, OP.

Easy pea-zy and delicious.  I used Trader Joe's "diced and fire roasted tomatoes w/green chiles."  Put them in a blender.... to sauce them down.  Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome recipe!  Makes great, authentic enchiladas!  I made my own enchilada / taco sauce instead of buying a jarred one.  Also, for those trying to be health conscious, plain nonfat greek yogurt is a great substitution for sour cream.

I substituted the tomatoe sauce with Pace picante sauce mild, left out the water, and added a little cream cheese to the filling and cooked it down.  I tripled the recipe and made one enchilada to test before I rolled them all up and was dismayed, it tasted to much like lasagna with that oregano.  Then I read the reviews and used regular refrained beans and regular canned enchilada sauce to make up forty enchiladas for a family function.  Universally loved by the adults, teens, and two year olds.  Will be making these again!  Lots of flavor but mild enough to be great for all age groups.

We all loved this!  Followed the recipe exactly except I did saute the onions and garlic before adding.  Other reviewers said this didn't need all that water -- they were right; I had to let mixture simmer to cook the water out, but it is a PRETTY dish and very good.  Good enough for company!

Made a 1/2 recipe of this today, made exactly as written omitting the green pepper, I don't like green pepper.  Love it and I'm not much of a fan of Mexican food, but my hubby is, he's gonna love me making Mexican.

I made the recipe as instructed, except for the water which I left out completely. The enchiladas were spicy and delicious, and maybe even a bit too spiced. I will make this again, next time with slightly less chili powder. Very good and easy to make.

I followed this recipe exactly as laid out here on the page.  I didn't relize how many people had rated this recipe so high and then change nearly every aspect of the recipe.  (Almost  different recipe at some point when you look at all the changes people have made.) BUt I made it exactly as stated.  Here's the thing.  Once you are done mixing the ingredients together, it is a soupy mess.  I had to let it simmer for a while to let a lot of the water boil off.  But once it was thick enough to spread on the tortillas and it was cooked, this tastes great.  Not too spicy and tastes wonderful.  I recommend you try following the recipe at lest once and see if you like it.

This is excellent using chicken or ground beef, which is great for varied tastes.  Adding salsa instead of tomato sauce, chilis instead of green pepper and red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce really added to the flavor.  My guests loved it and asked when I was going to make it again!

I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of shredding the chicken instead of cubing it.  Takes more time, but WAY worth the effort.  Then when I tasted the chicken mixture, it tasted like chicken chilli to me.  The Chilli powder was overpowering.  I added some cumin and instantly, it tasted amazing!  Next time I make this, I am going to omit the water completely.  Made the mixture a little soupy.

1st attempt, followed the recipe to the letter.  It was very good, but not great.  Next time, I'll make a few changes, add a little of this and little of that, and maybe I'll enjoy it even more.

My sister assembled this dish the night before and baked it the next day.  It was made gluten-free with rice tortillas in place of the flour ones.  Was absolutely perfect and delicious.  Was not watery at all.  5 stars!!!

This recipe isn't bad, but it's barely reminiscent of real enchiladas.  My wife called it "Mexican lasagne" and I would tend to agree.

Very good!  It was soupy.  I used a slotted spoon to scoop the mixture into the tortillas and then poured the extra sauce over the pan of tortillas. I used 1/4 of the taco sauce in addition and topped with cheese.

just a few adjustments: first, boil the chicken and shred it- it's more authentic. second add cilantro. and instead of tomato sauce use a cup of chunky salsa (i didnt have tomato sauce) and use corn tortillas, flour tortillas are more for tacos in my book.

Really good recipe! Definitely do not add the water or it will be WAY too liquidy. Also, I added spanish rice to mine and it gave it a little more thickness and it turned out really good and a little more solid than traditional enchiladas.

This is a tasty recipe, especially if you tweak it and make your own Enchilada sauce. I recommend the TEN MINUTE ENCHILADA SAUCE found on allrecipes. However, this recipe is far from easy or quick, so be prepared for the long haul!!

Great recipe! I made it without the 1/2 cup of water and it turned out delicious. Next time I will add some olives and jalapeños.

all you have to do is omit the water and add the tomato sauce until you have a good texture. if you find that you added too much sauce, try adding some more cheese or sour cream. once you have a thick creamy texture this recipe is amazing. another thing we have done is added a couple jalapeno peppers to give it a little more spice. :)

We absolutely LOVE these!!  The only thing I did different was cook the chicken with 1/2 packet of taco seasoning.  Oh, and I used salsa instead of taco  for the top.  Scrumptious!

We absolutely loved this recipe! I only made 2 changes. I used black olives instead of peppers because the husband hates peppers. Also, following previous reviews, I put the taco sauce in the filling and used one can enchilada sauce as the topping, omitting the tomato sauce. I would recommend not adding any salt. The ingredients have plenty of salt already. I found it a bit salty but my husband and our friend had no issue with it, so it's up to your personal taste. This was absolutely delicious with a green salad and a serving of mexican rice. Thank you so much for the recipe. I will use it again in the future.

The only is I recommend to have shredded chicken. It was weird having cubed. But great flavor. My husband prefers flour over corn, so it was perfect!

I followed the recipe as is, except that I omitted the water.  It was easy to make and very tasty.  Great for weeknight cooking.  In the future, I will experiment with adding veggies into the filling or trying the salsa, as others have suggested.

Very good, My husband has said it's the best thing I made thus far! I pretty much followed the recipe, but omitted the water, tomato sauce, parsley (cause I didn't have any), and the salt (cause I forgot to add it). I just made 4 servings which is enough for the both of us as well as another days worth of left-overs. I also added more green pepper than asked for, because I really enjoy it, and it gave good flavor that was needed! A sure Thumbs UP!

This recipe was a hit. We did modify a little by adding some canned niblet corn, extra red and yellow peppers, "mexican rice II"  and went the previous suggestion of substituting the tomato sauce with salsa and the taco sauce with "ten minute enchilada sauce". We also didn't have chili powder in the spice cabinet so we made do with a little cayenne instead, it was lil'hot but GOOD =) Thanx

Delicious!!

Followed recipe very closely, but made minor changes do to reading some recommendations.

1) omit water
2) use only half of the tomato sauce
3) shred chicken instead of cube it

Also, I could not fit this in one 9x13 pan.

These were amazing....Next time I would only use have of the tomato sauce...I have a large family and it's very difficult to find a recipe all 7 of us like.......but this recipe did the trick.  I was able to double it ... made 20 large enchiladas they were gone in a flash leaving only 2 for the next day, which my 2 youngest children shared!

I love this recipe...I just altered it a little bit to make it much more easier. Instead of chopping up the veggies (ie onion, pepper ect) I just buy some fresh salsa and dran it. I add half of the container. Then instead of putting all the spices in, I use just a packet of taco seasoning. Also, I do not add the water I feel that it makes it WAY to soup-y. Then after I assemble the enchiladas, I do not use taco sauce over top. Instead, I buy a second can of tomato sauce and pour that over it. Then add some cheese. It turns out less soup-y and better tasting! Plus there is no chopping veggies so it is quicker to make!

This was awesome! I think this is probably the 4th enchilada recipe I've tried and this one tastes most authentic. The only thing I did differently was omit the water and I sauteed the onion, garlic and green pepper first, but this is just to a personal taste. I read some reviewers used jared salsa!?!?! Blah! I find salsa in recipes to be watery and gross. Stick with the tomato sauce. I used leftover filling to make quesadillas--YUM. I think next time I will make extra filling and freeze it.

I don't know if it's me or the rest of the world but I have never had enchiladas made with flour tortillas that didn't taste like goo. I was raised in Southern California and in all restaurants and Mexican cooks homes, enchiladas are made with CORN tortillas. Burritos are made with flour tortillas. Please try any enchilada recipe with slightly warmed corn tortillas in place of the flour. You will be amazed. Fillings can be seasoned meat, chicken, cheese or combo one with cheese.Top with your favorite enchilada sauce and bake until heated. This was a lot of work as is for goop.

These were very tasty! I am giving the 4 stars as they would have been too watery if I had made them as written. I followed the advice of reducing the tomato sauce (less than 1/2 of the can) and I substituted salsa for the water. For those that wanted more "kick", I topped theirs with pepper jack cheese. Some of us chose to eat these on top of a bed of chopped romaine. I used the Red Enchilada Sauce (by Sal) from this site per another reviewer's recommendation. We will make these again!

This was a big hit with my family.  As suggested, I omitted the water.  I used shredded chicken and the tomato sauce.  Added one diced tomato and 1/2 a diced red pepper.  I also let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 20 minutes before assembling.

My house loved this!  Next time I would not put in the water as my mixture was kinda soupy!  My boyfriend said it was one of his favorite meals I have ever cooked and another room mate of mine said they were better then the popular local Mexican restaurant!  I will definitely be making these again!

VERY good recipe. I heeded the advice of omitting water, and I am glad that I did! There is simply no need for it. I spruced up my tomato sauce with finely chopped jalapenos in addition to recommended ingredients. I still had half of a can left, so instead of tossing it I added taco seasoning to it with a few dashes of cayenne, cumin and sugar to make my taco sauce - it was perfect! The jalapenos give it a kick, which my husband and I like. I made this three days ago and reheated leftovers for lunch today...still good!

My husband and I were really pleased with how these turned out. I used a can of Rotel instead of the tomato sauce and topped the whole thing with a can of enchilada sauce instead of taco. Really easy to make and tasted just as good on day two!

I finally found a good enchilada recipe!  I wouldn't change anything!  The taco sauce tasted great.  Next time, I may try enchilada sauce instead.

The crew on my boat loves this!! I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, but did the rest just like it says. This is also easy to convert to vegetarian (substitute TVP for the chicken) or Kosher (leave out the dairy and add some veggies. =)

This was a BIG hit with my family! Even my picky 6 year old LOVED it! I did omit the water and green peppers and then added a half can of Rotel Mild Green Chilies and Tomatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made these tonight and they are very good.  However, to be perfectly honest.  I think the Old Elpaso Enchilada Dinner Kit ones where all you have to do is add the meat is just as good and probably cheaper.  Thank you for a very good recipe, but I think I will stick with the quicker, cheaper and easier method.

Followed the recipe for the most part, had to make a few subs b/c I didn't feel like running to the store.  Used green chilies instead of green pepper. Instead of using water and tomato sauce I used salsa, just added till it looked right. Put 8 of them in my big pan, used 16 oz of taco sauce instead of 12. We LOVED these - tasted and smelled great.  Put refried beans in some of them b/c I was running low on meat mixture and we really liked them like that plus it is healthier, will do that for all of them next time.

This is a great recipe, i make it once a week.  I recommend using only about 6 oz of tomato sauce, eliminating the water, shredding the chicken, and using enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Also, i use chuhaha cheese instead of cheddar to make it more authentic- but otherwise, a great find!

I made the changes everyone suggested - no water or tomato sauce, salsa and enchilada sauce instead - and it came out wonderfully.  Very pleased with my first try.

Wonderful, but I modified according to other reviewers.  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth for 10 minutes, turned the heat off and let the chicken cook in the broth for another 10 minutes covered.  I used 4 chicken breasts but only ended up using 2.  The chicken breasts at our store are huge, so I would recommend using 2 breasts (that calculated out to be 1 - 1.25 lbs of chicken.)  I omitted the salt, tomato sauce, water, chili powder and green pepper and replaced it with 12 oz of salsa and a 4 oz can of chopped green chilies.  I also omitted the taco sauce and used the Red Enchilada Sauce from Allrecipes.  I only used 1/2 of the enchilada sauce to cover my enchiladas.  I used more cheese on the top (didn't measure).  Everyone loved this recipe!

REALLY GOOD!  I did heed the warning to omit the water and cut back to an 8oz size of tomato sauce to avoid the "soupy-ness" ....and I used a rotisserie chicken (mainly because I am lazy and thought "hey! A shortcut!"....)   and it turned out AWESOME!!!  Super simple too! Was able to whip this together with a 1 year old hanging on my pant leg! :-)

The recipe was good. I did try something else the second time though. Since it was for myself and my boyfriend I cut the chicken down to 1/2 lb cubed and cooked it with 1/2 chopped onion, and 3 cloves of garlic. Only used 1 tbsp parsley and bought a mix of black pepper and red pepper and used about half a teaspoon. 1 8oz can of diced tomatoes with habanero peppers and half a can of tomato sauce. No water, no bell pepper, and no taco sauce. After adding everything to the pan tomatoes and all, I added half a cup of sour cream and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. Spooned the filling into the tortillas and took what sauce I had leftover and poured them on top with about 1/2 cup of cheese sprinkled on top. And one 19 oz. can of Red, mild, enchilada sauce. It came out very good. I live in New Mexico so the spice for you can be tweaked with but, it's a nice "deviation" from the recipe. Mmmm mmmm haha!

These were SO GOOD!!!  I don't normally  make Mexican food, but these were so delicious.  I did follow some other reviewers suggestions.  I left out the water, but kept the other ingredients the same.  Only other differences from the original recipe were that I poached my chicken and shredded it.  I used light sour cream and reduced fat cheddar cheese to save some extra calories.  I will use this as my go to enchilada recipe from now on.  I love that you don't have to fry the tortillas before rolling them, it really cuts out a lot of fat in that is normally in the traditional enchilada recipes.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!!

I love this!  I made it EXACTLY like the recipe and they turned out great.  Next time I'll probably make some modifications, but the hardest thing for me on allrecipes is to try and find people who made the recipe 'by the book' and then reviewed it and still loved it.  This was fabulous!  Can't wait for my leftovers :)

AWESOME! And I didn't make too many changes. All I did was omit the parsley and oregeno because I am not a fan. I also didn't add the water and only used half the can of tomato sauce. The onther half I used to coat the bottom of the dish. Then instead of using Taco Sauce I used Old El Paso Enchilada Sauce. Definitely a keeper. Thanks.

Whenever any of our friends has a new baby, we bring this dish over as soon as they're ready for visitors. It's hearty, satisfying, fattening, packed with protein, and easy to make. And it freezes well, which makes it perfect for easy reheating during those first crazy weeks with a newborn.  The recipe makes a lot, so there's almost always enough for a small casserole to keep for ourselves. Love it!

READ REVIEWS to tailor to your taste.  This is an excellent recipe without too many changes.  The only thing I changed was omitted the 1/2 cup water (not needed and takes away from the flavour) and added cut black olives to the top.  I used "La Victoria" brand taco sauce which tastes authentic and is a bit thicker than other brands and corn tortillas which were absolutely key to the taste.  (If they crack and break as you are assembling just go with it, it comes out as a lovely lasagna type dish)  Thank you for the recipe

I found this recipe as a great base but did some modifications such as Green Chilis and green onion, as well as instead of the taco sauce I use a can of Enchilada sauce to coat the bottom of the dish and cover the enchiladas themselves. Turned out great. I didn't add water. And I only added 1/2 taco sauce. The rest is in the picture and the tummies of my family which went for 2nd's which is rare. A WINNER for a base be creative.

These are the best chicken enchiladas - everytime I make them people LOVE them.  The only things I do different is I make the chicken ahead of time by cooking a huge package of chicken in the crockpot with 1 jar of salsa (I usually 2x or 3x this recipe to make enough to freeze.. it freezes beautifully).  Shred the chicken and then make the recipe.  I also do NOT add the water.

This is a excellent recipe.I made this for my daughter in college and I get requests to make it again.It may be time consuming but well worth it.One piece of advice is to omit the water as it will be to runny.

Yummy!  I did make quite a few changes, but this recipe can be absolutely fabulous, so it gets five stars.  My changes: cooked chicken in slow cooker with chicken broth and herbs then shredded rather than cubed it.  Sautéed garlic, onion, and pepper together. Added cayenne pepper and cumin to the sauce mixture. Omitted the water. Substituted salsa for the tomato sauce (but only used half the amount called for), substituted chopped chilies for the green pepper, substituted red enchilada sauce for the taco sauce, and used a Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar.  Next time I’ll save a little bit of enchilada sauce to pour over the enchiladas after they’re done cooking.  Great recipe, thanks!

I give this four stars b/c I did alter it a lot...First I omitted parsley, taco sauce,tomato sauce, green pepper, and water. In place of the tomato, water and taco sauce I used a recipe for enchilada sauce(about a cup added to chicken). Also I used a chili pepper in place of the green pepper.The last change was I topped them with more enchilada sauce and mont. jack cheese.I baked them for twenty mins, then put under the broiler (I like my cheese brown)for about 2-3 mins.

Great ENCHILADAS! I made a couple of changes, I did not add the water and instead using bell peppers, I used one small can of chili peppers. I will make these enchiladas again soon, very soon.  ddg

I thought this was a great recipe.  I made two pans, one for a potluck at work and one for us at home.  These were MUCH better the next day.  I did everything but bake them, put them in the fridge and baked them the next morning.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I loved them.

I followed the recipe as written and did not reduce the water or tomato sauce as many suggested.  I let it simmer for a while to reduce some of the liquid and let it sit for about 10 minutes to thicken up somewhat.  Once filling the tortillas, I only had a little bit of the liquid left over, which I mixed with the taco sauce to cover the top.  I thought this dish was excellent!

This is one great recipe. I use it as a layered enchilada and my family goes crazy for it!!! I often don't use as much water and tomato sauce so I don't have as much left over. Thanks Debbie, your a star!

Excellent, easy dish! This is definitely going in the archives. I used ground turkey instead of chicken because it's what I had on hand. They melt in your mouth. I thought that the tortillas may be mushy, but not at all! I also used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. It was amazing! I'm trying to think of other things I can put the meat mixture over!

I love this recipe! All the seasonings make it so delicious. However, I found the actual chicken filling to be somewhat runny which made it challenging to fill the tortillas. So, I drained the mixture into a bowl, filled the tortillas, and then used the liquid on top of the rolled tortillas and sprinkled with cheese. No need for the taco sauce. It was great!

These were okay, needs more spice though, maybe some jalapenos in it.  Also I would rather have a better sauce for the topping rather than store bought taco sauce.  The filling was good though.

LOVED IT! Served it when my parents were here and they too liked it, I used a can of diced tomatoes with g. peppers and onions in place of the tomato sauce and fresh pepper, and added a can of g. chiles....super yummy, flavorful and easy to cook - mine just got a little too liquidy which affected some of the tortillas when rolling - but didn't affect that taste.  a definite keeper!

These were addicting. First off, I used leftover grilled chicken and shredded it with a fork. I left out the tomato sauce + water but kept everything else in the mix. I did add canned green chiles and a little bit of enchilada sauce to the mix. I also threw in some red pepper and tabasco, as I found it kind of bland. After rolling the enchiladas, I skipped the salsa and used the rest of the enchilada sauce and cheese on top. As you can notice I didn't really measure any of the my changes. I just sort of winged it.

I have made this recipe countless times and it's always been a crowd favorite. My boyfriend wants me to make it all the time-his new favorite food.  I omit the water entirely so it is not as soupy, us one or two more chicken breast halves usually and use less cheese for a healthier enchilada and I would recommend either making your own taco sauce or buying a high quality one because the taco sauce on top can make it taste unoriginal.

Everyone wanted the recipe to this dish when I brought it to a recent dinner potluck.  The minor "heat" factor was the hit.  I dipped each shell in the enchilada sauce before rolling....

My family loves this recipe!  This is probably one of our favorite recipes.  I have used it over and over again the last couple of years.  I did make a few changes to it.  I added a little of red cayeene pepper to the meat/sauce mix for an extra kick and some extra cheese. One other thing that I have done if your not too concerned about the added calories is you can fry the flour tortillas in crisco just before stuffing them. The trick is not to fry them for too long, just long enough for the tortilla to begin bubbling. You whisk them out of the pan when you see the air pockets beginning to brown and expand with a pair of metal thongs and pretty much start stuffing and rolling them when they are hot.  You can let them cool a little if needed. Very tasty with a nice crispy texture and they also hold their shape better. Follow the remaining directions of the recipe as it states and then serve. Yummy!!  Usually we have extra meat/sauce mixture left I just pour it over the tortiallas like a sauce and cover with cheese.  This variation isn't of course for light weights who are worried about calories and fat, but it's well worth the extra effort. Try using hamburger too for another flavor adventure.

This is a great recipe for ideas.  I used the base idea and just changed a few things based on the reviews.  I sauteed the onion and garlic, then I added the chicken with enough Enchilada sauce to moisten everything.  Added the spices and simmered for 20 minutes.  Then I added the cheese and cooled for a bit added the sour cream and then rolled in tortillas.  Added that to a dish with a bit of enchilada sauce on the bottom.  Also, after all were rolled I put the rest of the enchilada sauce on the top with cheese on top of that and that was it.  Did not use taco sauce or water.  Great dish.  Have made it twice and it is a big hit.  Served with Spanish rice and refried beans.  Enchiladas were topped with lettuce, sour cream and salsa.  Yummy!!!

I tried making these for the first time today, and my wife, who does not like overly spicy foods, wouldn't stop eating the chicken mixture straight from the pan before I could fill the tortillas!  I read quite a few of the reviews first, and following most of the suggestions, decided to omit the water, and substituted tomato paste for the tomato sauce.  I also added chopped red pepper along with the green.  I must say that they turned out fabulous, and I will definitely make them again.  Thanks!

The best time to eat this is after it comes out of the oven, though it makes great leftovers too. I found that one wasn't enough, two made me sick, so one-and-a-half was just the right amount with a side salad. I will make this again!

With modifications, this was a great recipe!  I omitted the water and tomato sauce and made my own enchilada sauce from scratch.  I did add a few tbs. of the sauce to the chicken mixture before rolling it.  Next time, I want to replace half the sour cream with cream cheese to see what that would taste like.  I took this to a potluck and it was the first to go!

these are REALLY good!  i have made them just as the recipe says to and i've also made them using enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  i must say that i enjoyed them better as written with one exception.  the taste in this recipe is a little sweeter than enchilada sauce, but i have found that substituting salsa for tomato sauce gives a nice balance.  (when i use the tomato sauce AND the taco sauce together i feel that it's really a good flavor but i get sick of it kinda quick)next time i am going to put in some green chiles.  have fun with it and i would honestly say you don't need the water.  i like mine thick!

I made these last night, except with beef instead of chicken. They didn't taste very authentic, but were still good. I took the advice of some reviewers and left out the water and also cut back on the tomato sauce. It was pretty messy with cutting back on the sauce and water, so I could only imagine what it would have been like if I would have followed the recipe to a T. All in all, my family enjoyed them a great deal and I will be keeping this recipe, at least until I find an even better one. :)

Really delicious enchilada recipe.  Have made several times and we always love it.  Eliminate the water and use enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.

These were definitely 5-star enchiladas, though I admit I have no real experience with authentic Mexican food, only what you find in restaurants on the East Coast. Anyway, I forgot to buy tomato sauce, so I put a can of tomatoes in the blender. I also put in a jar of salsa, and the type of salsa you use is really going to change it. Mine was corn and black bean salsa, so it went well - the corn especially. The tortillas I used were too big, so I made them size XL from also adding more chopped pepper. I used homemade enchilada sauce and they were so fantastic. Awesome as leftovers too!

I have made several different versions of enchiladas and I must say, I REALLY loved this filling. The tomato sauce seemed a little odd at first, but it really made for a delicious mixture.   I followed this pretty closely, but a few small changes: I sauteed the onions and garlic, used shredded chicken and left out the green peppers (FYI: next time I would add green chiles or jalapenos instead of the green peppers). I also poured 1 small can of mild enchilada sauce AND a small jar of hot taco sauce over the top.  Yum! Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This was okay. Edible but not a favorite. I didn't like the enchilda sauce... should have made some or bought something other than Old ElPaso. Thank you for the recipe.

This was an AMAZING dish! We didn't add the water, sauted the onion, green pepper, and garlic clove and added a little extra cheese: perfect. Can't recommend it enough. Boyfriend says its a keeper and that we need to have them again ASAP. Very filling, very good!

My whole family is sitting here stuffed to the max after eating this recipe with a few modifications - I did as other said and cut the tomato sauce and water in half. Also, they had a sale on chicken thighs at my local super market so I needed a way to use em' up so I boiled them in some water (added 1 chopped onion, S&P, 1/8 of crushed red pepper and 1T hot sauce to the water). Gently boiled it till the meat came easily off the bone about 20min or so. Drained,then shredded it. I followed the recipe pretty much the rest of the way with the exception of the green chilies substitution(instead of green peppers) and a dash of cayenne pepper. Topped with enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese YUM!

I have tried other enchilada recipes on this site, and this is the best. My boyfriend absolutely loved it. The only things I changed was I added 1/2 the amount of tomato sauce, no water, and added some red bell pepper. DELICIOUS!!!

Absolute PERFECTION... if you omit the water.  I made these for my best friend's birthday potluck, and she called two days later asking for the recipe because she and her family were craving them again!

Yes, I made this and while I was making it , I also thought with the water and sauce, it would be watery. Wish I read everyone out there. Also I didn't have chili powder , I ran out and I put in a packet of taco seasoning So next time , I will minus the water and maybe some sauce. But the taco seasoning packet was great.

Fabulous. I switched a few things  - used already cooked shredded chicken, about 2 cups worth - used a 28 ounce can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and water - mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar - omitted the parsley and onion; I'm out!  - used corn tortillas  They were great with the changes. Next time I'll probably add a few extras I've seen in other reviews, black beans, etc. My 2 1/2 and 14 month old loved them (as did my husband and I). This will appear on our table many times.

This was much better than I thought it would be; thanks to the positive reviews that I even tried this, and thanks to the suggestions for making it even better, while still using what I had on hand. I (a) poached the chicken in broth for about 12 minutes, and shredded it with 2 forks; (b) sauteed onions & garlic on low, then added 1 jar of salsa and cooked down a bit. (I didn't have any green peppers or canned diced chiles.)   Added some cumin, but that's it. Took about half the sauce and put it in a separate bowl & pureed it. (Didn't have any other enchilada sauce or taco sauce.) To the remaining sauce in the pan, I added the shredded chicken, sour cream, and cheddar cheese. Spread some of the pureed sauce in the bottom of the baking dish, wrapped the chicken mixture in whole-wheat flour tortillas, put them in the dish, topped with remaining sauce and cheese. Result was good, not very saucy, which worked well for my kids.  My picky ones ate it and that makes me happy. This was my first time making enchiladas, though I cook quite a bit, and I was pleasantly surprised. Thank you!

Excellent. Substituted canned green chilis for the pepper and enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce. Only thing I would suggest is making sure the onion is cooked thoroughly before adding to the mix-it tasted a little raw. Otherwise, great!

Great recipe!  I read the reviews before making this dish and am glad I did.  I left out the water and only used half the can of tomato sauce with the chicken.  I mixed the otehr half with the salsa for the top.  Turned out really good and vary filling!

My husband and I loved this recipe!! I took the advice from other members and made a few changes. I cooked the chicken in chicken broth to add some extra flavor and shredded it instead of cutting into cubes. I didn't have oregano but didn't miss it. I only used half a can of tomato sauce and left the water out completly. I used two 4 ounce cans of green chilies instead of the pepper and topped it off with red enchilada sauce. I love this dinner and will make it many more times! It tastes amazing!

The filling was fantastic.  I put them together the night before and threw them in the oven when I got home from work that night after pouring taco sauce and cheese on them.  Pretty quick and tasty.  I imagine they would be even better if they hadn't sat all night in my fridge!  Next time I'll assemble them right before I stick them in the oven.  I made some changes (doesn't everyone?).  I poached the chicken in chicken broth and threw in the peppers and onions towards the end.  I drained out the liquid (except for 1 cup of the broth) and shredded the chicken.  I cooked the rest according to the recipe, only instead of adding water I added the chicken broth from poaching the chicken a little at a time until I got a consistency I liked.  My only complaint: not spicy enough!  My family and I love spicy food so while the flavor was good, it was lacking that extra oomph to be mexican!  Next time I'll add some red pepper flakes.

My picky husband loved this and couldn't stop saying "Fantastic!"  My toddler kept asking for more.  It has a lot of flavor.  I read the reviews saying it may be too watery so I waited to add the sour cream and cheese until after I had cooked down the tomato sauce and water.  Next time I think I will try it as written because it was almost too dry.  This is a keeper.

This dish has got great flavor but I made a few changes of my own.  I omitted the water and tomato sauce but added a can of diced tomatos with green chilies.  I also added black olives and used fresh cilantro.  The mix was still a little soup like so I alowed it to cook down for about 35 to 40 min before filling.  I love cheese so topped it off with a very generous amount of cheese and enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  This was great served with rice beans.

This was a great recipe! One thing that I will definitely change is the garlic--I just did not like garlic in my enchiladas. Otherwise, it tasted fantastic. I chopped/shredded my chicken into smaller pieces that cubed, added black beans (which were delicious!) and used enchilada sauce instead of taco. I really recommend not adding the enchilada sauce and cheese on top at the beginning of baking. Instead, take it out like 5-10 minutes before hand and then put the toppings on. They got too baked for me. Otherwise, superb!

I really liked this, I thought it had a lot of flavor to it. I used salsa instead of the tomato sauce and water. I just used this for the inside of the enchiladas.Also I used enchilada sauce for the topping. Heats up well. The only thing I might change is maybe less chili powder, and I think it might be easier to cut the chicken into cubes before cooking. I think you would save time here. If nothing else I will cut up the breast into slices, then into cubes after cooking.

I've tried 3 or 4 different chicken enchilada recipes looking for a good one, and this is the best so far.  I omitted the water, and used one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  Also I sauteed the onion, garlic, and green pepper before re-adding the cooked chicken to the pan.  Delicioso!

WOW this was delicious!  For my own personal taste I only used about half the chili powder. I also followed others advice and omitted the water, used about a third of the tomato sauce, and used enchilada sauce rather than taco sauce. SO GOOD! I used the leftover tomato sauce in rice, served with refried beans and it was like I was at a real Mexican restaurant! Thanks for the great recipe :)

This recipe went over well with my husband and four kids.  One picked out all the green pepper, but overall, they liked it.  I did omit the water, as I was afraid it would turn out soupy, but it ended up being ok.  My husband suggested making it in the future by tearing up the tortillas and layering it, like a casserole, but other than that, it was great.

My first attempt at Enchiladas and I am so glad I used this recipe!  I followed to the letter except I used three chicken breasts and shredded the chicken as opposed to cubing it after cooked.  I got one 9x13 and a 9x9 out of this recipe.  Will be putting this one down as a favorite.  Thank you!

Excellent!  As good as many of the enchiladas I've had in restaurants. The next time I make it I will cook the sauce down a bit.  It was kind of runny.  Also, I would use non-stick spray so they don't stick to the pan.

Very good! I boiled my chicken before coming to print off the recipe, but it was still yummy. I left out the water as suggested, I can't imagine adding that much liquid to this. I also used fajita seasoning instead of the individual spices listed. I had a request for the recipe after sending a plate to my brother's house. Oh, and I couldn't decide if I wanted to use enchilada sauce or taco sauce so I used a little of both.

This is a good recipe for enchilada filling with some modifications.  I reduced the tomato sauce to 8 oz. and omitted the water like many others suggested.  I also added some taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning I from this site) in addition to the other seasonings.  I followed as directed otherwise although I topped with enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  Used a combo of cheddar and pepper jack on top.  Thanks!

This recipe was good, although it took me longer than my traditional recipe.  The spices are what really makes this one good.  My husband kept going on and on about how this tasted like a restaurant enchelada and how much he loved it.  Will make again.

Very good! Two things though. #1 cube the chicken before you cook it, much faster. #2 to cut down on the watery problem but still have a tomato flavor, tomato paste. Other than that I did everything else the same. Quick and yummy!

"I know many if you have found this recipe to produce a soupy mess if the water isn't cooked down. Please try my variation on the recipe: Omit: 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce 1/2 cup water 1 (12 ounce) jar taco sauce 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/2 pint sour cream Replace the ingredients above with the following: 1 can (10 oz) La Preferida Enchilada Sauce (Hot or Mild) 1 jar (16 oz) Frontera Grill Salsa (I like the Chipotle Salsa)"

I love your changes to this recipe, it cuts down on prep time, all you have to do is pour and stir! I kept the sour cream in the mixture b/c I love sour cream :). You should submit it as a separate recipe, I always come back to this page but only to refresh my memory on your variation!
Thanks!!

My family absolutely LOVED this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception; I added a can of green chilis just to spice it a bit more. oh and to make it easier I bought a whole deli chicken already prepared and deboned it. The enchilada sauce I bought was of Medium temperature and added some nice spice to the enchiladas. If you like super spicy foods, go for the Hot enchilada sauce. Superb recipe! I will make this again.

I made this tonight and thought it was both delicious and very simple!  Instead of taco sauce, I used enchilada sauce. Substituted onion powder for fresh onion and diced green chiles for green peppers (per other reviewers' suggestions.)  Also, used rotisserie chicken and less cheese and light sour cream to lighten it up.

I thought this would be better based on the ratings.  I did not add water as suggested and used less tomato sauce but I just felt like this was lacking in flavor.  It was fine but not great.

Hubby and I thought these were really good. I made them using homemade tortillas (Tortillas I) so these were nice and hearty. I didn't read many of the reviews before beginning (I know, I know...) so I missed out on the part about the sauce being too runny. Next time I will just omit the 1/2 cup of water and add an extra chicken breast. It was still delicious, I mean you have to eat enchiladas with a fork anyway, right? I unexpectedly ran out of onions so I added 2 tsp. of oinion powder to the sour cream part of the sauce, and I added 1 tsp. of hot chili sauce and an extra clove of garlic to the tomato sauce, nothing major. This will be our enchilada recipe from now on!

Needs a bit more flavor, but it was overall good.  I omitted the water, used a can of green chilies instead of green pepper and topped with enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  I also shredded my chicken and used corn tortillas.

I followed the recommendations of omitting tomato sauce, water and spices...I used 1/2 c. salsa and 1/4 c. sour cream plus 2 tbsp cream cheese, mixed with chicken, pepper and onion, add some of the cheddar, rolled that into the tortillas.  Then as a sauce I used 1 can enchilada sauce, 1/4 c. sour cream and 1/4 c. cheddar, mixed and poured over it, baked for 20 min!  Was great!

These were awesome! I used a rotiserie chicken to make the recipe even faster and easier. I also sustituted Monterey jack for the Cheddar cheese and omitted the green pepper(personal preference). Thank you for sharing this recipe I'll definetly use this for years to come!!

My picky husband loves this. He hates onions and peppers and still loved the recipe. The simplest way to avoid the "soupiness" of the recipe--I have made it twice and never added water. Period. Very tasty. :)

My family loves this recipe. However, I did change a few things. I ran my chicken through the food processor, only used about 1/4 of a bell pepper and took the water down to 1/4 cup (then it isn't soupy). Other than that, it's great.

I feel it would be unfair to give this recipe only 4 stars, as it gave me the basics to create my own super dish (with help from reviews). I replaced the salsa with pico de gallo. I actually boiled the chicken with some lime, salt and pepper until it was almost fully cooked - thought it would be more tender that way. I then cubed the chicken. I used a Mexican four cheese combo. Also, I used a homemade green salsa that a friend had given me for the holidays. Also, I just layered tortillas on the bottom of the dish, put the filling on top, put tortillas on top, then the "enchilada" sauce and cheese. Enchilada pie! Easy and yummy! (oh, I replaced the green bell pepper with jalopenos - from a jar, and I only used 2 large chicken breasts and put it in a 9x11 dish.)

I took the advice of many other reviewers and used enchilada sauce rather than tomato (well, I mixed about 2 oz of the tomato into 5 oz of enchilada sauce) and did not use the oregano or parsley. I also added the olives to the top. I only had a Cheddar/mozzarella mix for the cheese but that was fine. Next time I will use a Mexican blend though.  Everything turned out great. Easy to roll and not soupy at all. Will make these again. Thanks!

I first cut the chicken into strips and sauteed with 3 cloves of garlic, salt and pepper and then cut into cubes. I then sauteed the onions with a bit of olive oil before mixing everything else in. I took the advice of other reviewers and took out the tomato sauce, water and sour cream and substituted the Old El Paso chunky salsa in medium. I only mixed about 2/3 cup of salsa into the chicken mixture and just poured the rest overtop of the rolled enchiladas before putting in the oven to avoid the sogginess problem. I also added chopped red peppers and mushrooms into the mix and used a little bit more cheese to bring it all together.  Instead of taco sauce, I used enchilada sauce which I poured overtop the salsa. Overall, quite good.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for awhile. A few changes I made: I double this recipe, I didn't add any water or taco sauce and cut the chili powder in half because my family doesn't like things very spicy. This is defiantly a family favorite.

It's very nice, once the amount of fluids are adjusted way down (half or less than recommended & no water).

My sister and I cooked this for my family and it was excellent!!  Some of my family members don't like it real spicy so we cut out the onions and peppers.  We also used a little bit of Monterey Jack cheese with white cheddar.  I highly recommend shredding the chicken with a fork and then your fingers once you can handle it; it makes for a phenomenal texture change!  My whole family absolutely loved them!  And once it cooks, as long as you let it sit for 10 minutes before serving, they're not nearly as messy.

This recipe was really delicious and super easy to fix!  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and omitted the water...GOOD CALL!  If the water had been in there, it would have definitely been too soupy.  I also substituted enchilada sauce for taco sauce as well as used about half the tomato sauce called for in the recipe.  The only other change I made was that I cubed the chicken first and then sauteed it with the onions until it was no longer pink and then followed the rest of the recipe from there.

WE definitely will be making this again!!

I am a HUGE Mexican fan and I thought had way to much tomato/italian flavor. I have tried A LOT of high rated recipes and have liked all of them but if you like authentic Mexican food this is not the enchilada recipe to make.

Delicious recipe. Made it for a Labor Day Picnic and it got lots of raves. Added just a little water, next time probably won't add any. Reduced the amount of spice, since serving it to a crowd.

If you haven't already tried this recipe, you really should.  Better than most restaurants.  It has become one of my family favorites.  The only change I made to the recipe was to substitute a 
4-oz. can of diced chiles for the green pepper, and I seasoned the chicken with chile powder before browning.  I prepare these the night before baking them to give the flavors time to meld.  Yum!

Umm...okay well I omitted the water, used only 8 oz sour cream, used lemon pepper because I was out of black pepper,  used one 4 oz can of diced green chili instead of bell pepper, subbed mexican 4 cheese, and the real problem came in when I tried to substitute enchilada sauce for taco sauce.  Oh My God.  Enchilada sauce is so strong!  It was too strong for my taste buds so I used one 16 ounce can of mild salsa mixed with 1 8 ounce can tomato sauce...which turned out far too sweet, so I poured in about 1/2 cup enchilada sauce and it turned out just right.  Gah.  Next time I will try to stick to the original recipe!

Fabulous recipe.  The kids gave it 7 stars.  I added only 1 tsp of chili powder and used mild taco sauce as my family does not like it too spicy.  Also the left over chicken sauce was poured over the top of the taco sauce before sprinkling the cheese.

I've been making this recipe for about 7 years now and its always a hit.  Like some of the other reviews, it tends to be soupy.  Just omit the water!  I also like to add a can of green chiles to the sauce and instead of regular tomato sauce, I use a can of Mexican stewed tomatoes (I think they're DelMonte brand).  This recipe is a keeper!  If you like Mexican food, it definitely satisfies!  Try making Sweet Corn Cake as a side dish.

This was really good, although my kids are still a little wary of Mexican.  I made it exactly as stated.  Aside from having to cook the chicken, it was incredibly fast.  I browned and cut up the chicken in the afternoon while I was making lunch and when it came time to make dinner, I threw it all together in about 15 minutes.  I served it with refried beans.  Definately a keeper!

Very good flavor.  I varied the recipe a little.  I sauted the onions before adding the chicken.  Also, I used fresh chopped parlsey and added fresh chopped cilantro - both added after melting cheese and just before filling the tortillas.
Will cook again.

My family and I love Mexican food and I have to say this was the best enchilada dish we have ever eaten. The only changes I made were leaving out the water and oregano. I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and I also added some cilantro and cumin. I boiled the chicken with 2 cloves of garlic, onion powder, parsley and chili powder. I sauteed the onion and green pepper first, before adding the rest of the ingredients. What a fantastic dish!!!! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with us Debbie. It was a big hit.

The only change I made was a can of red enchilada sauce on top (plus diced tomatoes) instead of the taco sauce.  That actually made it taste like an enchilada.  I wasn't thrilled with the filling mixture taste.  Not sure if it was too much chili or if it was just lacking some other ingredient.  They were good, but I don't think I'd make these again.  I'll continue my hunt for the perfect enchilada recipe on here.

My husband and two toddlers loved this!  I would've personally given it 4 stars, but given that it is something the whole family enjoyed, it deserves 5.  I thought the flavor of taco sauce was too prominent, so next time, I think I'll try enchilada sauce.  Thanks!

I have to admit I was a little sceptical seeing all the sour cream in this recipe.

I tried it and I didn't modify a thing.  The recipe was fantastic! - the family loved these.  I did traditional beef enchiladas on the same night, as back-up, and these chicken ones were gobbled up way faster!  I did use lots of marble cheddar cheese on top.  I had filling left over which I kept in the fridge.  My wife stuffed a couple of tortillas with it each day and put the 'burritos' in a container to heat up in the microwave for lunch at work.

The taste was incredible!  I do not necessarily agree with the "quick" part, however if prepared the night before and baked the next evening, they make an incredibly delicious dinner!  My husband loved these!!!

My family loved this recipe!! We never have to order out for enchiladas again. I don't like taco sauce but I was really shocked how well it tasted on this dish. I made a few changes I didn't have onion or garlic so I used onion powder and garlic powder. I used corn tortillas instead of flour ones.I don't think I put enough sour cream in and my filling was a bit watery. I just filled the torillas and poured the sauce left in the pan on top before putting the enchiladas in the oven. Everything turned out great!!!!!!

Delicious, delicious, delicious..just make sure you come hungry, it makes a great deal. I didn't follow the recipe exactly..added a can of rotel tomatoes, only a 8oz can of tomato sauce, and no water..still was a little watery..added more spice than listed, kept adding until it tasted right :)

My husband, 12 year old and myself all enjoyed this dish but my five year old thought it was "too spicy" even though I hung back a little on the chili powder. I used whole wheat tortillas to add fiber and skipped the bell pepper because I knew my son wouldn't eat it. I forgot to add the 1/2 cup water and it turned out fine. I used salsa instead of taco sauce because that is what I had. Saving to my recipe box - will be making again!!

I really liked this one.  I added more cheese to mine than is in the recipe.  I also added corn, green onions, and chipole peppers (for more of a kick) to mine.  I also used salsa instead of tomato sauce and enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  My husband and his friends a worked loved them

Fabulous recipe thoroughly enjoyed by all the family. Couldn't get the taco sauce for the topping so replaced it with salsa then the grated cheese. Worked well and tasted absolutely delicious

This was really easy to make and my very busy family enjoyed it so much I have sent copies to all of my friends.  If you have a busy afterschool schedule like I do...make the enchiladas ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator.  When everyone comes home, it takes less than 30 minutes to heat up the meal and enjoy.  I served it with Spanish rice and cornbread!

Very yummy!  I too used salsa instead of tomato sauce and homemade Enchilada Sauce (from this site) to top it with.  I think next time I won't bake it at all but just roll it up, add a little sauce and serve.  It was all mushy and just fell apart when baked with the sauce.

Don't bother adding the water, it was too soupy...I had to end up adding cornstarch to thicken it up.  It tasted good, but I will make it next time with green chiles and enchilada sauce.  Not too bad in the calorie and fat dept. compared to other recipes, but I still lightened it up by using reduced fat sour cream and shredded cheese.

Made this just like the recipe called except only used 1/4 cup of water upon others suggestions.  It was okay, but I wouldn't make it again.  All of the flavors are somewhat overwhelming and I'm still not sure it tasted like Mexican or Italian.  My DH did go back for seconds.

I really liked this recipe and so did my fiancee!!  I used green chili's instead of green pepper and enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  I also didn't include the tomato sauce--not sure if it would've made a difference or not.  I think the longest part was cooking the chicken.

Highly recommend!

I will deffantly make this again, but I will skip the water and use corn flours instead of the flour tortillas. I used a small can of green chilies instead of the green pepper and a can of enchilada sause instead of the taco sause. Quick and easy dinner.

Was very tasty.  Only made a few modifications (based on personal preferences) - I grilled the chicked and then shredded it and I also sauteed the onions, green pepper and garlic before I put the chicken back in the skillet.  Hubby liked it.  I suspect this dish will be even better tomorrow.
Also - I did omit the water as others suggested.  Not sure why the water is necessary - it came out great without it.

This recipe is amazing...and one of my husbands favorites.  There is only one thing I change which is instead of the jar of taco sauce I buy enchilada sauce or put an extra small can of tomato sauce in the recipe and spoon the leftover sauce over the top.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. My husband said it's definitely a keeper. It has just the right amount of spice, really tasty. I used enchilada sauce from this site instead of taco sauce(didn't have any) and it turned out perfect. I will definitely be making this one again. Thanks for posting!

Best chicken enchiladas ever!  I was looking for a recipe like this for years. Since I am allergic to taco sauce and enchilada sauce I used regular tomato sauce instead of taco sauce, I also added more Cheddar cheese and sour cream to the mix and added more cheese on top of the enchiladas, and of course, is not necessary to add water to the recipe.  It was delicious...

I made this dish last night for my boyfriend, and he LOVED it! I did not add any water, and when cooking the chicken, I added chili flakes just to give it a little extra kick. I would definitely make this again - thanks for sharing!!!

I thought this recipe would be a good way to use up some pulled pork from a roast that had been in the freezer a little too long. It turned out really well, in spite of some unforseen substitutions. I planned to substitute the pulled pork for the chicken. Then I realized the can on the pantry shelf said tomato PASTE, not sauce, so I added a little water to the paste and used it. Then I discovered the container of sour cream had grown hair prettier than my own so I substituted plain yogurt. (Sour cream would have been better, but this worked in a pinch.)I also used the blended Mexican cheeses ...just because.
In spite of it all, this recipe definitely goes in the "yum" file!

I'm going to give this five stars even though I didn't like it -- because the part I didn't like was the enchilada/ taco sauce! I loved the chicken filling on these and I might do it again with a different sauce on top. The only thing I did differently was season my chicken breasts before I sauteed them.

Very, very good.  An easy dinner using some leftover chicken we had on hand.  I was curious about how the parsley & oregano would taste in a mexican dish, but it was really good.  We omitted the water...the filling seemed thin enough.  Thanks...this is a keeper!

Made for the first time tonight - Loved it!  Big hit with the picky hubbie.  Small changes: seasoned 3 chix breast with Goya Adobo and pepper before cooking; Left out parsley and water; Substituted green pepper with green chilis; Used 8 oz of tomato sauce; Mixed in sour cream at the end so that the taste was a little more apparent.  Will make again!

I loved this...it's not too spicy, which I loved. I made it 3 times and decided no green peppers for me and like others I pourded the remaining sauce over the tortillas with some taco sauce as well. Also I like to saute the onions before adding them to the sauce so they're not crunchy.

Okay...I'm joining the band of others who thought this recipe was awful.  It was bland at best.  I will not make this again.  Corn torillas are so much better for enchiladas hands down!!

Terrific recipe and it freezes great!  I made up two batches and assembled both.  I cooked one (delicious) and then froze the other.  Honestly, I think the frozen tasted even better - it may have been because I made the homemade enchilada sauce on here...

Awesome!  I boiled and shredded the chicken the night before.  I also added a bit of cumin and garlic powder to the inner mix.  First topped with rolled enchiladas with cheese (so it wouldn't "float") and then smothered them with Trader Joe's Enchilada sauce instead of "taco sauce."   After it came out of the oven we topped with avocado.  Fabulous!  Next time I'll add some frozen roasted corn in the with the "stuffing" just to sneak in some more veggies.

This was great!  I used 14 oz diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of tomato sauce...I put it in the blender first to make it liquidy.  I did not add any cheese to the chicken mixture, only on top.  I served it with quionea and blacks beans and with a dollop of sour cream (light ofcourse!).  Everyone really liked it.

My husband and I didn't care for this dish. The taco sauce topping just didn't taste right to us. I will try it one more time with corn tortillas, enchilada sauce & Mexican cheese because we did like the filling (maybe with just 1t. of chili powder).

this recipe was good but not as good as i expected, i begged to make enchiladas for over a year, finally got my wish and i chose the 5 star recipe and was kind of disapointed. we halfed the onion, and cooked them before putting it in the enchilada, we also did not add water and insted of using taco sauce we used enchilada sauce which was good. it also took alot of time to make, it took (me and my mom) one hour to make and half an hour to bake so we had dinner at 7:30.

Didn't have any chicken so I made cheese enchiladas instead.  I cooked the onions, garlic, and green pepper in a little olive oil and then mixed in the sour cream, shredded cheese and only a small amount of the tomato sauce.  I had to make the whole dish like a casserole because the mixture was little too runny, with no chicken,  to roll up into tortillas.  I layered the tortillas and cheese mixure and topped it all off with the taco sauce and more cheese.  It was so yummy, but I can't wait to try it again with some chicken.
Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe, probably because it wasn't a traditional enchilada recipe, which I'm not at all fond of. This looked like enchilada's but didn't have the flavor of enchilada's. Next time, though, I will saute the onions first so that they are not crunchy (my kids wouldn't eat this because of the onions). I also took other's suggestions and stirred in 1/2 of the tomato sauce mixture and then used the rest for the cover instead of taco sauce (I didn't have any). I used Boiled Chicken (submitted by George)instead of the chicken breasts. If you're a traditional enchilada lover, you most likely will not enjoy this recipe. Read other's reviews.

This recipe was very good--my 1 year old twins even enjoyed it.  The only change I made was to add a package of drained, chopped spinach (and omitted the water) so that my girls would get some vegetables in their dinner.

These were DELICIOUS. They were delicious straight from the oven and delicious the next day too. I doubled the onions because I love onions and it didn't overwhelm the dish. I would probably use some more taco sauce and cheese, but it's not necessary, just my preference.  If you make these according to the recipe instead of fiddling around with it like many others have they will turn out wonderful. I added the full amount of water and they came out perfect, not runny at all. :)

very good, something the whole family loved! next time I will not add the salt (too salty) and I will use less of the sour cream (not a fan & it overpowered the chicken)

This was the first time I have made enchiladas and they were good, however I would make a couple simple changes due to personal preference. I might change the chicken to ground beef. I will use this recipe again, but I will try other enchilada recipes until I find one that really wows me.

This was really good. I cut back on the amount of tomato sauce as suggested by other reviewers.Also, I cooked the chicken breast whole and then shredded it.  Would make again!

WONDERFUL- don't be relectant because of all of the ingredients..you can cheat and alter most of them and it still turns out! We prefer to substitute enchilada sauce for the taco sauce. Always a crowd pleaser for casual dinners. We garish the top with diced tomatoes and lettuce to make it look really yummy!

Fantastic!!!  I made these twice in one week at the request of my husband.  My toddler loved them, too!  Super easy to make, and wow - filling!  I also brought a tray of them to a friend who just had a baby, and her family also raved.  Her toddler was reduced to crying when there weren't any leftovers for his lunch the next day.

YUMMY STUFF!

Quick, easy and delicious, my 16 year old daughter loved this dish - strangely enough so did my co-workers (always bring some fare in the next day), so much so, I have been requested to make this one again, by both parties.

I only used two small chicken pieces but still used the whole sauce recipe.  Instead of pouring taco sauce over and baking, I used the tomato sauce and poured over the tortillas and sprinkled a few pieces of jalapeno peppers on top.  Mmmm...good!

UN-BE-LIEVABLE!!! Not as quick and easy as I thought, but it was well worth the wait! I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper first. Used the red enchilada sauce submitted by Sara in place of the tomato sauce (as the other reviewers suggested). I also used 8 inch tortillas and made 10 enchiladas. I have NEVER tasted better chicken enchiladas in my life!!!

Wonderful!  I don't like things all that spicy, so I used 1/4 tsp. pepper and 1 tsp. chili powder (perfect!).  I also used only 1 - 8 oz. can tomato sauce, and was so glad I didn't use more.  I also sauteed the onions and bell pepper before adding them, and would definitely do that again (the baking time wouldn't have been enough to make them very tender).  I had enough mixture for 10 tortillas.  Instead of taco sauce, I used "Red Enchilada Sauce," also from this site (awesome!!).  I think next time I'll double the enchilada sauce though.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made these last night and they were great. I followed the other reviewers advice and used enchillada sauce instead of taco sauce and diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce, leaving out the water because, as they said previously, the sauce was liquidy enough without it. I also added green chilis instead of the green pepper. Because of these changes, I only gave it a four out of five.

I used corn tortillas rather than the flour and substituted half the sour cream with cream cheese to give it a thicker sauce.  For an added kick I used chipotle chili powder and blended mexican cheeses.

I used the "Red Enchilada Sauce" recipe from this site in place of both the tomato and taco sauce and would highly recommend it, great flavour, zingy but not too hot.  I would have given this recipe a 5 because both my husband and son loved the dish, but my daughter and I didn't like how the tortilla wraps got really soggy/doughy kind of tasted mushy in the mouth.  Nobody else has mentioned this in their reviews so I think it is supposed to turn out like this.  The filling is fantastic and the sauce to cover was great maybe next time I will use it over rice or spoon it into crisp taco shells.

This was terrific!  How can anyone say it lacked flavor??  It had the perfect balance of spices, but not TOO spicy.  Maybe it was b/c I used used the Red Enchilada Sauce on this site (as suggested by another reviewer) instead of the plain old jarred taco sauce it calls for.  Yes, the filling mixture looked a little strange (I thought it odd to put the sour cream in while you are still heating the filling and it did look like it separated a little) but trust me once they are baked and you have your first bite you will LOVE them!!  Will definitely make this again!

Mmmm... this was absolutely awesome.  Great both with chicken and with beef in its place.  I put the water in as the recipe says, which makes the sauce very runny at first, but this turns into a really creamy sauce after baking, and the flavour really seeps into the tortillas.  I also use chopped tomatoes instead of sauce, and I use the "Red Enchilada Sauce" recipe to pour overtop instead of taco sauce.  Fantastic.

Great recipe.  The recommendations from others was very helpful.  I omitted the water, used 8 oz. of tomato sauce and used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  I also used ground turkey instead of chicken breast.  My husband really liked them.  Thanks for sharing.

This is is an excellent recipe!  Tastes even better the second day as leftovers.  I made a few changes though that I would like to share. With these changes the prep time is a bit longer:

I added 1/2 bunch green onions chopped; used 1 and 1/2 tbsp chili powder (I'm from Texas and we like it hot!); 1 and 1/2 clove garlic chopped; 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar and 1 cup shredded taco cheeses in the mixture.  Then I used 1 cup shredded cheeses at the end as topping.  Once it came out of the oven, I added 1/2 cup chopped  onion to the top.  Instead of 1/2 cup water, I used 1/2 can RO-TEL green peppers and chilis (including all of the juices).  Also, instead of 1/2 pint (8 oz) sour cream, I used 4 oz sour cream and 4 oz cream cheese.  I think this really added to the richness and flavor of  the recipe.  ENJOY!!

Let me first say, I'm a big fan of enchiladas.  And when I normally cook something that I'm a big fan of for the first time, I normally end up disappointed.  But not this time!  This was great!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but skipped adding water (upon suggestion of some other reviewers), skipped the bell peppers (because I didn't have any around), and used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce (again upon other reviewers' suggestions).

This turned out great. I changed a couple things...didn't add the water or as much chile powder as it called for. I also added green chiles instead of the bell pepper, and used mild enchiladeas sauce on the top, even my 2 year old ate it.

This was pretty good, I did make just a couple changes.  I shredded the chicken instead of cubing which I think is much better!  I also added a small can of green chilis to the chicken mixture.  Next time I will add some of the taco sauce to the bottom of the pan before placing the enchiladas in there - they were a little hard to get out.  Aside from these few things - this was great!

The taste of this dish is fantastic but I had a bit of trouble making it. The recipe says to roll the mixture in the tortillas but it was so soupy and runny that I ended up having to just layer it in the pan like lasagna. the end result was very good.

This was really, really awesome!!

I did modify it a bit:

-  I used corn tortillas.  Flour tortillas are a sin.  Make sure to follow the instructions on the back of the bag - if you dont, they crumble...

-  I used shredded chicken instead (boil for 15 minues then pick apart /w fork)

-  Didn't use either spice, but put a ton of fresh cilantro in instead.

-  Got the "Monterey Jack/Cheddar" cheese mix instead of plain cheddar

-  When it was cooked, I topped with diced tomatoes & cilantro.  Next time I'll add some lime juice to make more of a salsa topping.

Make sure to serve this with a good mexican beer like Dos Equis.

This recipe is fantastic!  I cook and shred the chicken, omit the water and salt, and add 1/2 tsp cumin.  I also use plain yogurt instead of sour cream and top off with fresh salsa rather than taco sauce.  Equally good with shredded pork!

This recipe is pure heaven!  I make it for company all the time b/c it feeds several people...and they always come out raving and demanding the recipe.  Do watch the level of the spice for the taco sauce.  Walmart brand only comes in medium, and it is very very spicy.  I usually add extra cheese in the sauce and on the topping.  I always skip the bell pepper.  It doesn't fit the texture of the dish in my opinion...

I give this 5 stars because the unenjoyable part of the recipe was on my end--- my taco sauce choice (Pace's Classic Taco Sauce) didn't mesh well with the rest of it, so the filling was definitely the best part. I agree that the water can probably be left out. I used fat-free sour cream. I didn't have cheddar or green pepper, so I used mozzerella and orange pepper, and it was tasty. I didn't use as much cheese as the recipe called for to make it less dairy-intensive. I had trouble rolling the tortillas, as I only had small ones on hand, so I ended making a layered dish that my husband termed "Echilsana."

I've made this recipe probably half a dozen times, my fiance loves it so much!  I add extra cheese, and I cut the chicken really thin.  Also, I use a variety of peppers (red/yellow/green) for more taste and more fun cooking!  I agree not to add the water, it isn't needed.  It's often hard to get the enchiladas out of the pan, though...I've fooled around with different ways to grease and nothing has worked too well :(

This came out awesome, though I made a few minor (or not so minor?) changes...
I used a rotisserie chicken and just pulled it apart, used a can of mild green chiles instead of the green pepper, used corn tortillas instead of flour, and used salsa instead of the taco sauce on top of the whole thing.  Here's the biggie... my corn tortillas weren't rolling even after I softened them, so I ended up making it into a casserole-- layered tortillas, chicken mixture, tortillas, chicken mix, tortillas, salsa, then cheese... served with sour cream on the side.  It came out unbelieveable, and was so much easier than rolling the darn enchiladas individually!!!

The filling for these is pretty tasty.  I think I will experiment with the spices though because to me parsley and oregano are kind of strange in mexican food.  I also used enchilada sauce rather than taco sauce to top these.  Overall...these were pretty good.  I am sure I will make them again with a few modifications.

Very yummy!  It was easy to make too!  I used enchilada saunce instead of taco sauce and it was excellent!  I don't really like onions and I think this recipe called for too much onion, but over all, these enchiladas were great!

I've never made enchiladas before because I thought they required a lot of work. This recipe was very easy and tasted great! I did use canned store bought enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. I'm going to make this a regular recipe in my house.

These are some DARN good enchiladas!  I especially liked it when I topped it with the green taco sauce instead of the red.  And this recipe can be made with beef as well, and it still makes a great meal.

This was incredibly tasty--I left out the water and the green pepper (I forgot to buy one) and we were really impressed--particularly since  I've made some terrible enchiladas in the past.

Fantastic recipe. I do make a few changes. I use  a can of chopped green chilis instead of bellpepper and red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and no water. I also shred my chicken instead of cubing it. I use 8oz of tomato sauce and no onion. The reason for no using onion is the fact that i serve fresh salsa with the enchilada, I use the Fresh California Salsa off this site. I also use homemade flour tortillas, there is a recipe on this for that as well. It does add about 45 minutes to the cooking time but it tastes even better using homemade tortillas. And i usually add 2 or 3 more chicken breasts and really overstuff the tortillas.  This is my boyfriends favorite dish. It is definitely near the top of the list on my favorites too.

Of all the chicken enchilada recipes I've made from this site, this one is my husband's favorite. I modified it a little after reading reviews and turned it into the perfect recipe for my family's tastes. I shred my chicken rather than cubing it. To avoid a watery mess, I only use an 8oz can of tomato sauce and omit the water completely. I use half a tablespoon of hot chili powder and substitute the green pepper with a can of chopped green chiles. Then I substitute the taco sauce with a can of red enchilada sauce. Yummy!! Be sure to grease the pan first and/or sperad some of the enchilada sauce over the bottom and sprinkle more cheese over the top before baking.

Awesome recipe. I've never made mexican food before and this got rave reviews from friends and family. My girlfriends 2 & 3 yr old lOVED IT. I did make the red Enchilada sauce to go with it and it was very delicious. I would highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe can be improved by using corn tortillas instead of flour (the flour tortillas get soggy) and a different sauce. The inside of the enchiladas were yummy; I'm just going to have to find a different sauce to go over them.

These were extremely good.  I did as others suggested by eliminating the water.  Still turned out alittle soupy, but I think that was my fault for not having enough chicken.  I also made it with the easy mexican recipe...also on this wonderful site.  Note that on that recipe eliminate the tomato sause.  Will definately make this again.

Follow the advice of the reviews on this one, and this is a great dish:  Omit the water.  Use 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  I also recommend that you spray the pan with PAM before you put the enchiladas in it.  I made these changes, and we loved this recipe.

WOW! These were awesome! I loved everything about them. Anyone living in europe who makes these, remember that european sour cream is thinner then american sour cream. I also dropped the water. You dont want an over runny mixture. These were GREAT!

I have entered this in a work cook off this was such a hit that I won first prize as well as had my vice president asking for the recipe.  I highly recommend removing the water and adding less tomato sauce.  Other than that this is absolutely perfect and very verstatile.

This really knocked my socks off!  Especially being the first mexican meal I ever attempted to cook myself!! I also found it to be a bit soupy, so next time I will probably follow suit with others and omit the water.  Overall....a most excellent and relatively easy recipe.

I had to adjust the chicken mixture sauce to meet my preferred consistency. I thought it was a little saucy.  Also, I would put cheese on top of the enchiladas when cooking.  It's a visual appearence thing more than a taste thing.  Cut it out of the cheese mixture if your cheese-conscious.

Very good--my 9 year old daughter made these for the family for dinner.  My suggestion is to add more cheese than is called for.  Other than that these were simple to prepare, heated up nicely for leftovers, and made a quick and easy dinner.

I don't know how this got 5 stars.  It was a very mediocre recipe.  I used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe from this site, which was delicious.  However, it did not help these average enchiladas.  Also, I felt a 10 inch flour tortilla was way too big for the filling.  The standard flour tortillas could have helped.  I would have rather spent the grocery money on authentic enchiladas at my local Mexican restaurant.  Sorry!

These enchiladas are awesome!!  I followed the recipe for the most part although I only used half of the tomato sauce and I left out the water.  I used mexian shredded cheese instead of cheddar.  I topped them with enchilada sauce AND taco sauce. I also added a can of sliced olives.  Actually now that I think about it, I altered quite a bit of the recipe but the jist is still there.  After cutting up the chicken, I left it out of the pan and I lightly sauteed the onions, green peppers, garlic, olives, and added about 2 tablespoons of canned green chilies.  I let these cool while I combined the cheese, sour cream, parsley, oregano, pepper, salt, tomato sauce (1/2 the can), chili powder (used mexican style)in a large mixing bowl and then mixed it all together.  This prevented the cheese from melting to begin with and gave the mixture a better consistency to work with. Try it my way!

This is delicious!  I agree with the others that the extra water is not needed. I cubed the chicken but it turned to shredded chicken by adding the water and stirring. I used the already roasted chickens that you can buy at the grocers - they are already flavored from the brining technique they use.  Instead of the taco sauce to cover I also went the recipe for red enchilada sauce to cover these great tasting enchiladas!

This turned out sooooo good.  I used the recipe for red enchilada sauce (You can find on this site)in place of the taco sauce.

Great recipe! I omitted the water and lightly fried the onion and pepper since I don't care for the raw taste.  I also used less of the tomato sauce and sour cream, and it was execellent. I know that I will make this again and again. I may try it with grilled beef next time.

I loved this recipe.  I added a little extra chili powder because we like it spicy and used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  I got rave reviews from my boyfriend and his roommate.  Thanks for the great recipe.

THESE WERE THE BEST ENCHILADAS I HAVE EVER MADE! I usually use corn tortillas but I wanted to try something different. They were creamy and mouth watering...I outed the jar of taco sauce and just used enchilada sauce...I recommend everyone try this recipe...HAPPY EATING!

This was fanstatic!  And I have to disagree with the reviewers who said to reduce the amount of sour cream and water.  I LIKE my enchiladas to have a lot of sauce and these did.

DELISH!  Thanks for the permanent addition to my recipe rotation!  :-)

This recipe is wonderful, my husband loves it.  As per the previous reviews I used no water and less tomato sauce, I also used the Red Enchilada Sauce.  These Enchiladas are best we have ever tried.

These were very tasty...and good the next day.  I boiled the chicken and then shredded it before making the filling instead of sauteeing.  I also omitted the water as previous reviewers suggested and topped with enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  When I brought the leftovers for lunch, everyone wanted to know what smelled so delicious!

These were so good.  I was a little hesitant about making them because I remember enchiladas to be rubbery and soupy.  These were neither.  I did use an extra chicken breast which gave me 2 extra enchiladas and it also made them more filling.  I ate 1 and I was soooo full although I wanted to eat more because they were so delicious.  I will definetly be making these again.

This is a great recipe.  It's simple to make, but you would never guess that from the taste.  I love Mexican dishes, but my husband could do without them.  However, with this recipe, he was the first one asking for seconds.

Great recipe!  Very tasty and easy to make.  I didn't omit the water like the previous reviewers reccomended.  It came out a bit soupy, but great!  A definate keeper in our house.  I will omit the water next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We made this for a special dinner and it turned out great. The sauce was quite watery and needed some corn starch to thicken it up. We did alter it somewhat to suit our need for spice-- we added a lot more chili powder and served it with hot salsa. I encourage people to try this one!

a very tasty recipe. i made half a recipe and had 5 enchiladas. i used fat free sour cream (and left the water out) and less cheese to cut back on fat. if not concerned with fat i would add lots more cheese. a little time consuming, but worth it.

My mum loved it and I'm going to make it again this weekend for my dad, who's away at the moment.  I love cheese and thought the amount the recipe suggested wasn't enough.
I didn't measure anything except the sour cream and it all turned out fine.  Very tasty, I would definetly recommend it to anyone who likes non spicy Mexican food, chicken or cheese.

My family and I liked the flavor of the salsa on top, instead of enchilada sauce, for a change.  But the filling was not one we would make again.  I left out almost all the water and half the tomato sauce and still ended up pouring excess liquid down the drain before I could put these together.  The sad thing about having to do that is the fact that the flavor of the cheese and sour cream was diluted by too much liquid, then wasted!

Very tasty, easy to make recipe. I did not use water and I only used an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce. I think it would be like soup if you used the ingredients as called for. I also used diced green chilies instead of green pepper, and enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. My family loves this recipe. We make it about twice a month.

This recipe is not complicated but it is time consuming.  It is tasty and coupled with the Mexican Rice and the Caramel Flan, both recipes are available through this site, the dinner was a festive change.

My very picky husband and I both loved this recipe.  We have an extremely spicy chili powder, so the one tablespoon was a bit too much.  I would put about 1/2 tablespoon next time.  But, overall it was very tasty!

I made this recipe after reading the other reviews.  I omitted the water all together.  I used two fresh plum tomatoes instead of canned and used mexican cheese instead of cheddar for the filling.  I also added green chillies, sliced olives and 1/2 tsp. cumin to the final mix.  For the topping I used a third of salsa, a third of enchilada sauce and a third of medium chipolte sauce for a kick.  I also used more the a 3/4 cup of cheese on top.  It was excellent.  I thought it was easy to make though I cook alot.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend, and he went crazy.  He gave all of the leftovers to his co-workers and came home with an empty casserole dish.  One co-worker actually called to say how much he enjoyed it!  I subsituted scallions for the regular white onion and it came out great.  This is a fabulous meal! Make it and everyone will love it!!!

This was a great enchilada recipe!  I added some Cumin and a touch of Cinnamon to the filling.  I also reduced the water to about 1/4 cup based on the reviews I read before making this dish.  The boyfriend loved it and I took the left overs to work and received the same reviews.  They all want the recipe.  I did saute' the bell peppers, onions, and garlic first before adding the chicken and sauce and found that to work quite well.  Enjoy!

Mixed review with my family.  My husband loved it the kids & I didn't.  I thought it was too runny even though I omitted the water and added extra cheese.  I assembled it about 1 hour before baking and the tortillas got very soggy.  Don't think I'll be making it again.

Real easy to make.  Very flavorful.  Tasted devine.  Enchilada sauces are too much work for me and most canned sauces taste terrible.  This turned out great.  May want to skip adding water, though.  Sauce was a little watery.  I ended up adding the excess to the taco sauce on top. I did add cumin to the mix (it brings out the garlic flavor) and put more cheese inside.  Will make it again soon.

Teen tested!!  An absolute winner!  

We used leftover chicken thigh meat from a "failed recipe" and simply shredded it into the mixture.  Served with Goya Spanish Rice and Southwestern Style Refried Beans.  It was a nice reprieve from the usual ho-hum meals.

Loved it. I layered corn tortillas with the filling, and my brother-in-law called it enchilada lasagna. I used a little less taco sauce to make it less spicy for the kids and just added more individually. This was a great recipe, and I'm sure it will be a regular menu item for us.

This was a surprise hit in my family.  Between a picky toddler and a husband who hates onions and peppers, people were fighting for the leftovers!  Like I've seen people post, I used a less tomato sauce in the mix and put enchlada sauce on top.  A definate keeper cause everybody wants it again soon.

First time I made such a yummy enchilada and the method was most unusual.  However I think next time I'd put a little less water because it got too watery.  I added more cheese to correct the consistency. But flavor was great and even though the sauce was very creamy it didn't make the tortillas soft and mushy, they kept a nice consistency.

The meat sauce had to simmer a little longer than anticipated.  I kept searching the instructions on what to do with the oregano.  I just threw it in with the rest of the spices.  This was a very good recipe.  I don't cook very often but this will be what we call a "keeper"  Our kids loved this stuff.  We used ground beef instead of chicken.

Good recipe. A little messy, but everyone enjoyed, even my picky eaters. I did leave out the peppers and used some onion powder in place of the whole onion for the picky eaters. Also just used 8oz of tomato sauce. Family liked, and wants to have again..that means winner in my book!

The first Enchiladas I have ever made, and way easier then I had expected. I made the mistake of topping with salsa, I think they would be much better to use the taco sauce, or even bottled Enchilada sauce.  To reduce the messiness factor, next time I will only add half the sour cream and tomato sauce. Hint, add some cayenne pepper for a nice kick. This will stay in my recipe box!

Too much onion for me. I think it would have been better with less onion and if I had cooked the onion alone before adding. Other than the strong onion taste was bland.

I did not like this one at all... Maybe next time if I try it I will not add the chicken with the pan of sauce... make those to separately then fill shells with chicken, wrap, and then cover with prepared sauce and cheese. The taco sauce makes it gross. Nothing like enchiladas.

Not at all a good recipe at all. Even if you spend time to cook down the liquid it still does not taste right. Please give more accurate ratings. This one deserves the archive file.

My go to recipe for a Mex-American dish. I leave out the water, prefer the less runny mixture. Spice fan so I'll mince some habanero with the garlic and throw some hab/ghost sauce on top. Never met anyone that didnt love it, great recipe

Another easy and delicious way is cut up the chicken sauté add mushrooms can of black beans salsa taco powder  sour cream and cream cheese as the filling. Then continue same as the recipe by stuffing the tortillas and rolling them too then with more salsa and cheddar cheese bake for few min. Kids love this recipe

This is the first time I’ve ever witnessed someone get angry about an enchilada (previous review), but I think this recipe is very good. It is not traditional, but still very tasty. I cut the water and will use chilis and corn tortillas next time but it was still awesome.

My kids loved these and my neighbor stopped in and ate one and took two home. I made subtle changes based on other’s reviews.
I used half a block of Philly cream cheese instead of sour cream.
I used enchilada sauce and tostitos jar of salsa instead of water, tomato sauce , and red chili powder.
I used red onions finely chopped.
I used green bell pepper and a small 4 oz can of mild green Chile’s. All the products I used were mild.
I used a few shakes of cumin powder. I used the other ingredients listed except where I told you I substituted.
My kids said the mix of sweet and spicy was just right.
There was a huge pan to save and freeze some for another day or use in a different way. I put some of the enchilada mix on small street taco corn tortillas and it was a perfect little portion for me!

Pre-cooked chicken in oven & then added onion, gr pepper to skillet to finish cooking.  Doubled up on pepper & added hot pepper flakes. Only used 1/2 19oz can of tomatoes and no water.

Recipe definitely needs adjustments for time spent reducing the chicken/sauce filling, otherwise it’s very soupy. Once I got the filling to thicken, it tasted great!

This dish is great for spicy food lovers! 2 out of 3 of my kids loved it even though our mouths were on fire lol. We even substituted the Monterey jack cheese for mozza instead to reduce the spicy in it. It was very tasty and goes great with rice!

Far too much taco sauce for my liking, and my family agrees. Came out soupy, not at all the way I like my enchiladas.

I kept the taco sauce on the side.  Instead, I put these: salt, tomato sauce, water, chili powder, green pepper and garlic in a separate pan along with a little sour cream and heated. I reserved some of the red sauce I made and put that on top then added the cheese and baked. I also cut my raw chicken in the the bites and cooked it in the skillet with a little on the seasonings it calls for and added the amount listed once it is no longer pink.My family LOVES it.

4 Stars since I tweaked the recipe a bit following other suggestions. I don't add water or sour cream. Occasionally I'll add a can of green chiles. It's a good and flexible recipe.

I will definitely make this again. I left out the green peppers and used sour milk instead of Sour Cream but also left out the water. So probably slightly more runny then supposed to be but still liked it!

I have made this twice. It's the only enchilada I have ever made. The taste is great, but both times the onions needed to be cooked more. I would suggest cooking the onions for 3-4 minutes by itself before you mix in the cheese and what not. It still technically works...I don't mind the onions have cooked, but my husband wasn't a fan because of the onions not being done. He ate it anyway though...
Save time by replacing the chicken with Rotisserie chicken already done. :) 

Best of Luck,

Ingrid

Yes I used salsa instead of tomato sauce
Also I didnt add the water didnt see a point and I was right
I sauteed my onions and peppers for a bit before adding sour cream and the rest The chili pepper is a nice add in bang of taste yet not too hot! Spicy but not HOT 
The texture is very yummy I can taste all flavors I added the green peppers are a nice mix (might add just a few more next time) I need to learn how to make up the enchilada wrap itself but I did ok for my first try at this Definitely will be making this again

Super good!  I think next time I will spray the bottom of my glass pan though as some of my enchiladas stuck on the bottom.  I will make this again for sure!

Honestly to save my sanity I made it into a casserole. Topped the mixture with cilantro and lime crushed tortillas then topped that with the wraps and then added cheeses over the top which formed a nice crust
Family loved it.

This recipe was really disappointing. It was a soupy mess for me too. i even tried to cook it down some and it was no help. I would also suggest omitting the tomato sauce and water. But I will not be trying this recipe again.

Like others....downsize liquids to  12 oz Salsa & 15 oz taco sauce or what ever you like totalling about 25 -27 oz of liquid (not 31 oz) Cook Onion& pepper add garlic, chicken & spices. Add sliced black olives, & chives. I used Mission Carb balance tortillas. I usually buy "whole wheat, high fiber, low carb tortillas" which we prefer.

Delicious.  Next time I'll eliminate the added water since the tomato sauce added enough moisture.  The extra water just made it too soupy.

I needed to doctor these up a little bit, otherwise I would have given 5 stars. 
I think this is a great base recipe to start if you're not sure what flavors your family will like. 
My family LOVES these with my slight alterations. Even when I make a bigger batch I hardly have any leftovers. The leftovers never make it longer than a day! 

Here's what I changed about this recipe. 
1) I  boil the chicken in chicken broth instead of frying it. 
2) I shred the chicken instead of cubing it then return Chicken to pan
3) Omit Sour cream. Keep the cheese, onion, oregano, parsley, and pepper. 
4) Swap out tomato sauce for red enchilada sauce. 
5) Omit the water. I guess you could add a little in if the mixture is too dry, but instead I would add more red enchilada sauce. Keep Chili Powder, salt, Green pepper, and garlic. 
6) Swap out "taco sauce" for red enchilada sauce. Top with more cheese than what is probably recommended in a single serving.

I made a few changes I used enchilada sauce instead of tomato coming from AZ I like it a bit spicier. I also used queso fresco cheese in addition to the other cheeses.

Very tasty but needs some punch like green chilli's and the taco sauce just went bland after cooking.  Maybe use real enchilada sauce?  I also have a complaint...might want to tell people to grease their pan before cooking.  All the enchiladas stuck and felt apart when trying to get them out.

It's a pretty good recipe.   I omitted the water.  This time I will reduce the chili powder.  It was too spicy for our tastes.  I make this keto by using deli chicken meat as tortillas.  It's really good that way!

I Changed two things the chicken to be the strips of chicken I found that they ended up being the perfect amount and already in thin slices so it was easier to cut up. I also changed the cheese and switched it to Mexican cheese I left out the peppers Becuase I made rice with the left over taco sauce and added the peppers in there. Overall great recipe only thing I would change again is how much liquids go into making it when I was done there was enough sauce left to make a bowl of soup

Turned out amazing! I’ve made it 2 times now. My boyfriend loves it. I shredded the chicken so that it was a little easier to eat and I make my own tortillas which made it even better! It’s definitely a favorite

This one is bizarre. As the top favorable reviewer says, the recipe produces a sloppy mess, so what all the enthusiasts do is rewrite the recipe to suit themselves, and praise the result to the sky.  Meanwhile, I'm left with a sloppy mess. Is it any good? I don't know .  Maybe, maybe not, but the only thing I can think of to do with what I've got is cook up some rice, and serve the mess over it.  My advice to newbies like me: read the reviews, and choose your variation.

This came out amazing. The family tore this to shreds and they are very picky eaters.

Little bit of work. Very much worth it. This is a repeat dish.

Suggestion: spread the baking dish with canola oil before loading it up.

I enjoyed making this recipe accept i didn't find it to be spicy enough, even though it was flavorful with the spices & chili  I felt it was missing some zing to it. I got approval from my husband and daughter but i will tweek the recipe  to add a tad more flare to it

This was amazing! I did use some substitutions. I used shredded chicken, onion powder instead of an onion and a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I topped it off with the red enchilada sauce from this site. My family said this needs to go in the regular rotation. Take the time and use the seasonings-it's well worth it!

My husband and I loved this recipe!! I did do some modifying.  First, I used some red and yellow “mini peppers” I had on hand.  I used white onions. While I was sautéing the chicken that I lightly salted with adobo seasoning, I cut it up while it was sautéing, to bypass the next step and ensure the chicken no longer had “pink” in it.  Then I sautéed the chicken with the onions, peppers and garlic before adding the tomato sauce and other spices, forgoing any salt since I used the adobo seasoning, and ingredients.  I don’t think any water was necessary and I used La Preferida hot red chili enchilada sauce to top off my casserole.  WAY tasty!!  A little dollop of sour cream and a sprig of cilantro on top,  made this not only a tasty dinner, but visually attractive as well!! Enjoy!!

It was very good for someone who has never had enchiladas before. However, I was expecting something spicier and easier to roll in the tortillas. Next time I may change it up a little to make it less soupy. That is if I do decide to make it again.

I lined my pan with foil for easier cleanup.  I also  made it with three large chicken breasts so I have enough to make more.  Put the left over filling in a food saver bag and sealed and froze it so it's ready for the next batch.

I definitely won't be making this one again. Not sure the reason for the water, but all it does it make a soupy mess that you have to waste time cooking down. The flour tortillas are also something I did not care for. Should have been corn which gives a much better flavor. Normally I will tweak recipes if they aren't quite to my liking, but this one requires so much tweaking that I'd rather start with a different recipe. The flavor is bland, especially with the flour tortillas.

Easy weeknight recipe That the family enjoyed.  I did use the meat from a whole roasted chicken I had cooked the day before and followed the substitution from the first review to avoid it being too soupy.

I made this for my grandchildren and it was truly a huge hit. I did only give this 4 stars because I had to adjust the recipe.
I read all the reviews and their biggest complaints were too watery and not enough flavor! 
So I omitted the water and used a can of creme of chicken soup and a can of black beans (rinsed and drained). I also doubled the chili powder. I made a double batch(16) enchiladas ,my 2 grandchildren and their father ate all and the next day was asking me to please make some more. This time I made 21 (thinking I would have some for the freezer)  nope they finished those off in 2 days. Now my son in law wants me to make 150 so he can take them to work..  He said he bragged on them at work and everybody wants to try them too.

I wouldn't change any of the ingredients. It is full of flavor. Unlike any other enchilada recipe that I have made. Raves from the family. The only thing I did differently was shredding the chicken instead of chunking. Works much better in a tortilla when you shred. Hold the ingredients much better too. Great, great recipe.

So I read a lot of reviews before making this recipe. I took their advice and substituted the tomato sauce for tomato paste. I also left out the water. Instead I took the empty tomato paste can and filled half of it with water and stirred with the contents left over in the can and used that. The chicken was boiled in chicken stock instead of regular water. and I browned up the onion and garlic before adding the cooked chicken and seasoning. I also took some taco sauce and put it on the bottom of the pan before placing the enchiladas in it to bake. I made a vegetarian version of this at the same time but cut the recipe in half since I'm the only vegetarian at home. Both versions came out amazing! I will definitely make this again!

with changes from other reviewers this was excellent. First,  I used rotisserie chicken shredded from grocery instead of cooking breasts myself. Instead  of tomato sauce I used a can of petite diced tomatoes drained with a whole pint of sour cream. I also used extra sharp cheddar cheese, but any cheese works. Instead of taco sauce, I used a can of mild enchilada sauce. An extra shake of chili powder and it was just the right spiciness. My spouse thought they were better then a restaurant!

This needs help, do not let the rating suck you in. I don't understand why you would cook the chicken and then cube. Here are the changes I made: seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning, cubed and then browned in a skillet. Once browned, add diced onion and garlic. Add green chiles and some chipotle chiles in Adobo sauce for flavor (only if you like some spice). Add 16 oz of sour cream (who says 1 pint?!?), add 1 cup of sharp chedder cheese, add 1 jar of salsa or enchilada sauce. Season with salt, pepper and garlic salt. I am not big into measuring spices, I go by flavor so season to your taste buds. Before assembling the enchiladas using CORN TORTILLAS, cover the bottom of a 9x13 with enchilada sauce or taco sauce. Fill your tortillas, be sure that the rolled tortillas are covered with enchilada sauce or you will have dried up and crusty tortillas. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese and bake to warm through and melt the cheese (remember, the chicken is cooked through already).

I cooked the chicken thighs in an Instant pot with taco seasoning and chicken broth. They were so tender and tasty. I sautéed jalapeños and onions to add to enchiladas. I fryed the corn tortillas and dipped them in red enchilada sauce before wrapping them. This is a great recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Really yummy. I read some of the reviews and took no short cuts. The broiled chicken with garlic and spices is the way to go. 
I omitted the water and used just a 1/2 cup of tomato sauce in the mixture. I would use the smaller tortillas next time. 
I added a little chipotle chili and it was amazing. Easy and yummy. Not a snap to make but worth  the effort.

This recipe is a hit with our family. We have had it a few times now and love it. I would agree with other posters that it takes some time to cook it down to the proper thickness but that allows time for maybe a glass of wine while waiting. Overall 5 stars!!

This was a very good recipe! I did exactly as it said except I didn't add that much water. More like a half of a half a cup. Other than that, everything is the same. To keep from being 'mushy' as other reviewers mention, just use a slotted spoon.  I don't really eat enchiladas, but with this recipe, that will change!

This was okay. I had a few extra enchiladas that I cooked separately and without much sauce; I preferred them to the main pan of enchiladas. The tortillas were too soggy and stretchy, would have been better with corn tortillas.

Great recipe!  I followed suggestions of others and did the following: Cube chicken first, then cook and drain. Set chicken aside. Add onion, green peppers to pan. Sauté 2 mins. Add 2 cloves garlic for 1 min. Add rest of ingredients but substitute salsa for tomato sauce and enchilada sauce for taco sauce and add 1 small can of green chiles and 2 teaspoons of ground cumin and 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro.  Return chicken to pan. After rolling tortillas, add additional fresh cilantro when coating with enchilada sauce and cheddar. After baking for 20 minutes, put under broiler until cheese just slightly chars. Don't let it burn!

This is definitely NOT a “quick dinner”; it took approx 50-60 minutes total. The filling came out a bit “soupy”, but I was still able to roll the tortillas as needed (I may try adding less water next time). This dinner was very good & I will make it again. I added parsley, scallions, & sour cream for toppings.

I made it according to the recipe. The breasts were dried out. The flavor of the chicken was outstanding. I would cook a whole chicken in broth, shred the meat, double the liquid proportions and pour over the chicken. I would roll the chicken and cheese  into burritos and fry in oil to crisp the tortilla shell. Overall though, my husband and I loved the flavor.

Was wonderful (tasted it) until I added taco sauce.  I hate the red enchilada sauce but I wanted to stay exact to the recipe since this is my first time making real enchiladas.  Flour tortillas were not a great taste.  If I did it again I would use corn tortillas instead and use green enchilada sauce.. I’ll just save my time and try another recipe next time.

My family loved it.  I will probably add just a little less chili powder next time because my little ones thought it was a bit hot, but it was definitely a hit.

I'm not the greatest chef, but this came out outstanding! The last time I made enchiladas had to have been 30 years ago - my wife didn't care for them back then.  I thought this recipe was a little labor intensive, but maybe that's my fault, since I shredded my chicken instead of cubing it. I also had a fairly large amount of liquid that I hoped would evaporate, but didn't.
It's a keeper, that's for sure.

instead of rolling the tortillas, we layered them in the pan like a lasagna of sorts. Then topped it with taco sauce and cheese. This might be one of the best things I have ever had!!

I made this for the first time, and made 36 enchiladas.  I read the other reviews and added green chilles, instead of bell pepper. I'm currently in Germany, so finding good enchilada sauce is rather hard. I used a combination of taco sauce and salsa sauce, though it can't be that authentic. 

I boiled the chicken for about 15 minutes in chicken broth, with tomato sauce, pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic cloves, and salt. Then I shredded it with forks. 

I lightly fried the onions and green chilies together. 

Added cream cheese to the mix to make it more creamy. 

In the end, I didn't have enough sauce to pour over top and that was kind of sad. 

But everyone loved them and thought they were good, not authentic mexican food, but better than the "mexican" food in Germany!

These turned out great following the recipe exactly.  It does appear that it will be too soupy at first, but once they are rolled and baked, they aren’t soupy at all.  I also froze some for later.  I was very pleased with the results of this recipe!

Made this tonight and we loved it!  I made it as is with two changes (one was unintentional :).  I replaced the tomato sauce with a 7oz can of chopped green chilies.  The 'unintentional' change was that I forgot to add the water. It really doesn't need it as the amount of liquid was perfect even without the tomato sauce.  We ate ours topped with sour cream - yummy!!  Will make this again and will try a ground beef version too.  Thanks for sharing Debbie!

We liked it very much I did not use garlic  I used garlic powder and not too much I am not a garlic person.  I did not have tomato sauce so I used tomato paste added some water.  Next time I think I will use some either hot sauce or peppers to give it a little more of a bit.  But it was still very good and easy to do.

Will def make again!! But listened to other reviewers and left out the water and cut the amount of tomato sauce in half. I also used some pepper jack cheese and threw in a few chopped up pickled Jalepeños for some kick! Delish

These are the best chicken enchiladas that I've made.  I followed the recipe except I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and I left out the water.  I cooked the chicken sauce for about 10 minutes to cook the peppers and let some of the water evaporate until I filled the tortillas.  In each tortilla I put additional cheese with the chicken filling.  Then I topped the tortillas with homemade salsa.  I served it with lettuce.  It was great.  This will be my chicken enchilada recipe from now on.

Pretty good base recipe, but not super flavorful. I increased all the seasonings as well as added some jalapeno and it still it needed more! Add some more zest and you'll love it.

I made this exactly as directed however I did leave out the bell peppers and added a bit less onion for the kids' sakes.  This was delicious and my girls and their company couldn't eat it fast enough; and they're picky eaters.  I thought it was by far the best I'd ever made too.  I added chives on top once cooled and mistakenly added a dollop of cream cheese to each too but forgot that there was already cream cheese inside and it was too much in my opinion.  Other than my mistake it was outstanding!!

This is very, very tasty!  However, next time, I will not add the water and play the tomato sauce amount by ear as I go. The filling was delicious but unfortunately much to liquidy. I ended up using a slotted spoon when filling the tortillas. However, again, very very delicious. Baked perfectly at the temp and time shown.

Enchiladas are made with corn tortillas, the major flaw of this recipe, which leaves an entire flavor profile out. I'm not thrilled either with the other ingredients or how they're prepped.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. It tastes just as good as if you went to a Mexican restaurant. It's a little time consuming but it's worth every minute. The awesome thing is the leftovers heat up great and taste just as good. I highly recommend this recipe!

Only because of time, and my desire to spend as little effort as possible, and because I couldn't find the excellent recipe that I used before, here is what I did… I combined about three different recipes for the taste desired, and it turned out perfectly. Oh, and I also used the Mission Carb Balance tortillas, cutting over 20 g of carbs. Doesn't taste any different.For 2 pounds of chicken, either cube them or cut them into small strips. Sauté in olive oil till no longer pink, add one small diced or sliced onion, 1 teaspoon cumin, two clothes of garlic, one and a half teaspoons oregano, 8 ounces sour cream, salt and pepper to taste, and shredded sharp cheese as desired. I also added some diced fresh tomatoes. You could add black beans or olives or anything you would like to make the tortilla more full. The cheese is not necessary if you add the sour cream.For about a third of the green chili enchiladas sauce in the bottom of a baking pan, 11 x 14 is recommended if you are using the large tortilla shells. This will make eight enchiladas or tortillas. Place them seam-down in the pan, for the rest of the green chili sauce on top, and sprinkle cheese from and to and on top of each one, just enough to cover.Bake uncovered at 350° for about 20 minutes.,

Im a 36 year old bachelor thats learning to cook.  I made this the other day and it came out perfect.  Really easy to make for the beginner and really tasty!  My only caveat is the way that my body processed it.  May need to think about adding Fleet Enema's to the ingredients list because you may need one.  Other than that It was Great.......Highly Recommend!!!!

my family loves this recipe!  delicious!  made it 2x in the last month-- I followed the recs of others and used 1 jar enchilada sauce/ and 1 jar salsa instead of tomato sauce and H2O, not watery at all !   I also used diced red bell pepper instead of green and added chilli powder and cayenne pepper to the mild sauces (to control the spice level).  layered the chicken/ diced scallions/ bell peppers and cheese in the tortillas, rolled them up/ poured sauce overall and topped w/ lots more cheese.  Perfect!  use shredded rotissiere chicken if short on time-- also can make ahead, refrigerate, and bake an extra 5-10 mins or so.  could also top cheese w/ chopped cilantro before baking but we didn't have any on hand.

I took the suggestions from a couple of reviews. I used a whole precooked chicken and shredded the meat, changed the tomato sauce to a 16 oz jar of salsa, omitted the water, added 2 tlbs. of green chili's in addition to the green bell peppers, used a can of red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and used Mexican blend cheese for the cheese on top.The flavor was very good but it didn't brown up and the tortillas were a little soggy. What can I do different next time? Thank You

Didn't have the chili powder, but the taco sauce was spicy enough that we didn't miss it. Also, I used shredded cheddar inside but topped it with Food Lion's Mexican Blend (shredded cheddar, Monterey jack, asadero, and "quesadilla" cheeses. I also used chicken broth instead of water. Served it to my daughter's family; they all asked her to make it again.

This recipe was decent. I added a little more chicken then  the recipe called for so when I added the 1/2 cup of water the recipe did not turn into a soup like other reviews indicated. That being said, the enchiladas did not have a lot of flavor due to the sauces. I suggest using salsa instead of the taco sauce to get more flavor.

Easy recipe to make. I am not sure what taco sauce is but I substituted with enchilada sauce which seemed to make sense.  Kids loved it and there were no leftovers.

This was very good.  It is very unusual for me to change a recipe when I make it the first time, unless the reviews have changes that seem to make sense.  Many of the changes seemed to make sense, so I did add and delete some of the ingredients.  I did not use any water or tomato sauce at all.  I added chili peppers and left out the green pepper.  With the chili peppers and the sour cream, the mixture was soupy enough (I can't imagine how soupy it would be with the tomato sauce and water-wow!).  I also left out the chili powder and used taco seasoning instead.  I used the rest of the ingredients called for in the recipe and used that heated mixture as the filling of the tortillas (although corn tortillas are more authentic, I don't like corn tortillas).  And then I topped the tortillas with a can of enchilada sauce with Cheddar cheese on top of that.  Delish!!! My kids had seconds!! :)

I would reduce the tomato sauce to 12 oz (3/4) can because the final chicken/sauce mixture was too wet.   When assembling the tortillas, sauce leaked out heavily as I was placing them in the pan. I simmered the mixture about 15 minutes before preparing the tortillas to thicken it up.  Alternately you could start with 3/4 can of tomato sauce and add a little at a time

This was delicious!  I used a little over a pound of chicken breast tenders, which I cut up prior to cooking.  I used a 10 oz. can of Rotel tomatoes instead of tomato sauce & water.  I had enough filling for five 8" soft taco shells (they were amply full).

After reading the reviews I had to review myself because this was so good as is, the absolutely only thing I did not do was add water other than that followed to a T and it was perfect. Will definitely be making again

Instead of the tomato sauce I used taco sauce, but I've also made it with the tomato sauce and it is very good. I also baked the chicken for 20 minutes then cut it up instead of cooking it on the stove because I feel like cleanup is easier that way. Additionally, instead of the spices I used taco seasoning (buy it in bulk, not packets!). I also added more veggies because I can't help it. Definitely a fantastic recipe that will be added to the rotation!

This was really good! Time consuming, but the end result was worth it.  I only used two chicken breasts for this recipe and we ended up W/ six enchiladas! Like other reviewers I omitted the tomato sauce and water, and also cut down on the chili powder (our tastes)and the cayenne pepper for the (taco bell recipe)  -  For the jar of taco sauce, I made my own from a recipe I found on food.com (Taco Bell Taco Sauce). That's the only sauce I used and the meal came out perfect. I did run out out of cheddar cheese and added Kraft's Mexican taco cheese to finish it off. My husband loved it, so did I! We will be making this again, Thanks for posting!

Was not a fan at all. I have spent my entire life in the city where Frozen Margaritas were invented, so we know Tex-Mex. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and was not very happy with it. 1) enchiladas should always be on corn IMO. 2) You should never put tomato sauce in the enchiladas. 3) The texture was more like a smothered burrito and less like an enchilada. With that being said the flavor wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I want from enchiladas.

This is a keeper.  Best sauce I have ever made.  Everyone I have given this recipe has LOVED it.  The second time I made it I added corn and black bean to the chicken mix.   
This a must try recipe.

This recipe was so "wet" there was no need to pour "sauce" (as in 'taco sauce') on top.  I do not understand why anyone would add water to this mixture???  Taste was ok, but the filling fell out of the tortillas as soon as it was spooned in.  After baking (without the extra sauce on top) it firmed up a bit. . .but this recipe would need tweaking before I'd do it again.

my family loves this, recipe!! I do make changes  but they are mostly because I know what my family likes.  I have done this with poached chicken and also with fajita seasoned frozen chicken breast from Foster Farms ( I get this at Marianos),  I dont add green pepper or chilies, I do add roasted corn .  I don't measure the sour cream I just add it by table sppons to get the creamy texture I like and I use Fontera Grill salsa.  I also don't measure out the cheese just add it as I go.  I saute the chicken and chopped onion with garlic then add the sour cream, salt and pepper to taste, salsa and cheese.  I also have added smoked chipotle chili powder  and keep tasting then I might add garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and more salt and pepper if needed.  I also use enchilada sauce and cheese on top.  Thank you so much for the recipe, I love recipes that inspire me to be creative!

I left out the water, halved the tomato sauce and sour cream. I cooked the onions with the chicken in a little olive oil. I also substituted Trader Jose taco seasoning (2 heaping Tbsp) for the taco sauce, just mixed it in with tomato sauce. Perfecto!

Grilled the chicken and subbed plain greek yogurt for sour cream.  Also used 1/2 the cheese trying to make it a bit more healthy.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Turned out great!

Excellent, easy recipe and everyone loved it! I didn't add water to the recipe and also added 1/2 cup corn. To save time, I purchase a cooked chicken and just removed chicken from the bones.

super easy recipe. I love this recipe!  My stand by for an easy, nutritious meal.   I tossed 4 breast into my slow cooker with a can of Rotel. Then rolled the shredded chicken with some cheese into the tortilla. Half went into the freezer, we had half that night. I added another can of rotel on top with cheese and baked for 40 minutes. It came out perfect. The frozen enchiladas I cooked 20 minutes before adding the Rotel tomatoes and cheese.  Great meal!

Cooked the chicken in one cup of water , 1 teas powdered chicken bouillon, table chili powder and 1 teas cumin.  Cubed chicken and continued cooking down the liquid. When the liquid cooked down, I Removed the chicken and added onion to the pan to soften, 4 oz can of mild chilis ( instead of green pepper) & added garlic. Also added a can of drained black beans. Cooked all together then added the chicken, spices as listed in the recipe, a cup of sour cream, a cup of Mexican cheese and 8 oz jar of taco sauce. Wrap in flour tortillas and place in baking dish. Top with a mixture of 10 oz can of enchilada sauce mixed with 1/4 cup of half-and-half. Top with Mexican and cheddar cheese and bake.   Really nice served with rice, lettuce and chopped tomato, chopped scallions and sour cream or guacamole.

Excellent & delicious dinner. Easy to make and made great leftovers. I used fresh picco de gallo salsa instead of  taco sauce. Definitely will make again. Family loved it.

Not a fan at all of this recipe. The flavor and flour tortilla texture just were not what I wanted or expected from an enchilada recipe.

That was an amazing recipe. Everyone at the dinner loved it and I will make that again for sure. I used all the ingredients except for Parsley because it wasn't available in my kitchen so I put Basil instead and all the ingredients I added according to taste... I also used shredded marble cheese instead of only cheddar cheese... good stuff.. thanks for sharing this recipe with us :)

Do not add the water and tomato sauce! Reviewers who have given this high marks have substituted for these items. As written this recipe is soupy and Italian-flavored as many have stated. To make it a 5-star recipe, you need to substitute items, which means THIS recipe is NOT a 5-star. Follow other suggestions and use Mexican salsa and enchilada sauce in place of the water, tomato sauce and taco sauce. Add green chilis to chicken mixture and use corn tortillas. NOW you have a 5-star recipe!

This turned out really bad. I don't know why it got so many good ratings. The tomato sauce drowns out all flavor and no seasoning can save it. Literally tasted like chicken in tomato soup. I'm sad I wasted ingredients on it.

My fiance loved this Enchilada recipe, thanks for putting this up. Anyway, instead of tomato sauce, I added diced tomatoes in can. I like how it had real bits of tomato. As most said it turned out a bit soupy nevertheless, still good. I saved the "soup" and added it the next day to my fried rice (steamed rice, Italian seasoning, bell pepper, Italian sausage, salt and pepper, just mix em all up), the result was fab!

The flavor is delicious but it is way to soupy!  I will make this again but I will omit the water and probably the tomato sauce.  I will use green chilies instead of green pepper and not melt the cheese into the mixture but sprinkle it on top the sauce before wrapping.  Also I will use enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  Perhaps I will try adding some re-fried beans.  Thanks for the basic recipe.

Delicious!  Made a slight variation... didn't add any water, used canned chicken, added salsa instead of tomato paste,  topped with 1 can green enchilada sauce.. the rest was the same. Family LOVED it. Quick and easy dinner!

I wanted to rate this 3.5 stars. The flavor was phenomenal, but I really wish I had read the reviews first. The sauce was extremely watery and I ended up straining some out and dipped the two extra tortillas I had in it as a snack. Next time I plan on omitting the water and using an 8oz can of tomato sauce instead. I'd also like to try it with Mexican 4 cheese with green chiles instead of green pepper, topped with enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. I also used chicken thighs, because my husband is picky and hates white meat. I am hoping for a 5 star rating after I make the above changes, because this recipe definitely has potential! Also, it definitely was not what I would call a quick meal, but not so bad considering it easily feeds 4-5 people!

Omitted the water, oregano, parsley. Added 1/2 tsp cumin to to taste. Green chilies is an added bonus, but I like green peppers which I sauteed with green pepper, garlic and onion after the chicken was sauteing for  4 min.  You don'r have to do it separately.  Also, I used chicken tenderloins and cut them up BEFORE  I sauteed them.

The sauce is way to thin to just put in the tortillas.  I put refried beans on the shell then used a slotted spoon to drain off the liquid and spooned a healthy serving of the chicken mix on top of he bean... topped that with some of the shredded cheddar.. a few tablespoons of the sauce from the pan and folded them closed.  Poured some of the sauce over each enchilada and topped them with more cheddar and baked and cooled like the recipe calls for.   They were delicious.. ended up with extra sauce.. I normally freeze it but it wasn't enough to make more than one or two and wasn't sure with the sour cream how it would thaw so I discarded it.  Gave it 4 stars because it had to be modified due to the sauce being too thin but the flavor was very good.

Didn't add water. Used salsa instead of taco sauce (but will try taco sauce next time). Only used 1 tsp of chilli powder and also added 1/2 tsp of cumin. Only used about 3/4 of the can of tomato sauce. Used ground beef instead of chicken and cooked the ground beef with the onions. It was great. The family loved it. Served it with Spanish rice and a garden salad.

I made this a few nights ago, and it was amazing. Everyone that tried it loved it, they said it was better then ones they had in restaurants. I did make some changes after reading some of the comments. First, I didn't add any water. Second, I replaced tomato sauce with 10 Ounce jar of salsa, and replaced taco sauce with a 16 Ounce jar of enchilada sauce. I cooked the chicken in the crockpot for about 4 hours on high with chicken broth, salt, and pepper. Then shredded the chicken with two forks. I also added Cayenne pepper.

I made this, but scaled it back to serve 4. I started with chicken, about 1/2 cup, and adjusted the rest of the ingredients proportionally. I was too lazy to roll tortillas and I had smaller ones as well, so I cut them to fit my 9 x 9 dish and layered the dish lasagna-style. The Hubster chowed it down with gusto. He likes his food on the mild side, so I doctored my serving with hot sauce and salsa. It was a good quick dish!

It tasted good, needed a little more heat, but it was runny.  Don't know if I did something wrong but I don't think I'll try this recipe again.

Epic. Don't add tomato sauce or water, they are unnecessary. 
If you do, you will need a straining spoon.
Replace normal tortillas with low-carb, high-fiber tortillas for a good low carb diet dinner.

I used chicken fajita strips, after reading reviews omitted the water, used Frontera enchilada sauce, added cumin. I also made a vegetarian option for myself with refried beans plus the sauce. My boyfriend said his chicken enchiladas were as good as a restaurant. I served with  avocado slices.

Good foundation, needed some "flare".  Followed the advice of other reviewers: 
I poached the chicken in chicken broth with some oregano; sea salt and a packet if Sazon seasoning, then shredded with a fork and set aside. 
I sauted the onions in a bit of olive oil before adding fresh parsley and the remaining ingredients in the recipe. I also used  mild salsa instead of the tomato sauce and water. I used diced fire roasted green chilies instead of green peppers and let it simmer and cook down since it was more runny than I wanted. This alone was delicious, then I topped it with enchilada sauce in place of taco sauce. I didn't use chili powder at all since I have littles, so it wasn't real spicy but had a good flavor and just enough kick for the adults to enjoy while being able to "hide" it from a the kids with sour cream and extra cheese.

We love Mexican food but we tend to get bored of the same ol things we do. I omitted the water. This is a great addition/  change up to our "book"! Thanks!! My husband doesn't like enchilada sauce - he liked the taco sauce. I didn't love the taco sauce, I like enchilada sauce. This filling is delightful though!

Very tasty! I was concerned about the tomato sauce.. By the time it's added to the skillet, there's a beautiful marrying of flavors. Highly recommend.. i made 6 very large enchiladas and we ate 3 meals of them.

This is the second time I made this and they are just the best. 

I didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted a can of tomato paste mixed with a small can of chopped chili peppers, I also used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar and finally I used a pablano pepper rather than the green pepper, just the right amount of heat. Excellant

This was good and not spicy for my 6 yr old. We used 8oz of tomato sauce and no water, based on other reviews. Good decision, it was just right.

I have no idea who the people making this recipe are that gave this a 4 star rating but this is a  recipe.  The instructions are horribly written and are actually confusing. The flavor isn't awful but it isn't anything remotely special. It'a just a "Midwest Mom at the last minute/penny pinch" recipe at best. (my sincere apologies to all the wonderful Midwest chefs who actually know how to cook).

This produced an absurd soupy mess and the flavor was about as far from an actual enchilada as one can get. I absolutely highly recommend you just stay away from this mess and find another recipe if you actually have taste buds that are developed and don't like having to fix a poorly constructed recipe on the fly.

I make enchiladas often, and when I made this recipe, I was concerned that the filling would be runny. However, I simply used a slatted spoon and used the remaining sauce to pour over the top of the rolled enchiladas. Then I used enough taco sauce to cover. Perfect! Great flavor and easy.

I am making this now and will update once we eat it. I did substitute a few things. I used frozen chicken breasts, frozen  chopped onions (1 cup), a whole cup of frozen chopped green bell peppers, I doubled all the spices besides salt, used chicken stock instead of water, and used 4 oz of  canned green chilies in my tomato sauce.

This was yummy, the recipe doesn't tell you to simmer for a while after you add the water but that's what needs to be done in order to thicken the mixture.  Alterations (or should I say improvisions) I made: I poached the chicken, left out the bell peppers because I didn't have any on hand and I just used Mexican blend cheese.

I've made it a number of times and have made a couple of modifications. instead of the the 1/2 of water I usually do somewhere between 1/4-1/3 cup, we do about 1 1/2 cups of cheese for the entire recipe, and I actually cook the green peppers at the same time as the onions. Other than that I don't think I make any other alterations to the recipe.

Ok as a base recipe. If  I make this again,  I will add more chicken and shred it as opposed to cubing it. I will also make it spicier and add something else (not sure what yet).

Probably a good idea whe using a 9×13  pan to grease the bottom somehow so that the bottom of the tortillas don't stick to the bottom of the pan.

I skipped the tomato sauce, and used canned enchilada sauce on top. Other than that I followed the recipe pretty closely, give or take a few inconsequential substitutions to accommodate what I had on hand. These enchiladas turned out great - i'd make them again and i'd definitely skip to tomato sauce again next time.  (Who ever heard of putting tomato sauce in enchiladas? Even Italians don't do that!)

Excellent meal that rivaled the local restaurants. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used a 16oz jar of salsa instead of tomato sauce (Newman's Own "Farmer's Garden), omitted the water, used a 7oz can of chopped green chilies instead of green pepper, and subbed a can of Herdez green chili enchilada sauce for the taco sauce. Combined this with the suggestion of boiling the chicken in broth and shredding it when it was "fall apart" done that I read in another review. Definitely worth the extra time and effort. A hearty meal that doesn't break the bank, give it a try.

Very disappointed.  Don't always read the reviews but probably will after this my first  recipe that was so highly rated but did not work out without reading your readers take on the recipe.  It likely would have been fine after going through all the reviews.

just made these and I have to agree with a previous comment.  These did make a sloppy mess!  I literally had to place the mixture in a strainer to drain some of it out!  not sure if I will make these again, too much tomato sauce!  these definitely have to be modified!

I made it pretty much according to the recipe, except I added cream cheese in with the filling mix and, like another reader suggested, Enchilada sauce across the top. Came out great!

I read some of the reviews and decreased the amount of tomato sauce, and I didn't use all of the taco sauce. Once the enchiladas were in the pan, I added about 1/2 of the taco sauce and added about 1/4 cup of green chile sauce on top. We all loved it!

I did not add the water as it was already really soupy.  I also cooked it down a little, so that it thickened a little.  I also added some rice to a few and my family loved it!

This is an excellent recipe. I've made it twice now. Everyone in my family loves it. I only recommend one change. The first time I made it, I used one 8 oz, can of tomato sauce. I didn't notice the recipe calls for a 15 oz can. The second time, I used 15 oz. of tomato sauce.  Both versions are great, but we actually prefer it with the 8 oz. can only.

This recipe was easy to follow, and it came out really well! The only change I made was to not add the water. I think that would make it too watery, and the enchiladas turned out great without it! I also substituted the sour cream with plain greek yoghurt to make it a little healthier. It turned out great!

I omitted the water, substituted the taco sauce with home-made enchilada sauce (many good sauce recipies on this site) and these were a hit.  I served them at a group dinner for our friends and their children,  and there was not one complaint.

The key is shredding the chicken and cooking down the mixture on medium heat, it should take about 10-20 minutes simmering on medium heat (stir every 2 or 3 min) and it will become a thick mixture if you cook it d
own right and it was absolutely delicious. Made 20 medium sized enchiladas with this recipe. The best chicken enchiladas I ever had and I definitely recommend it.

Great! I added some seasoning to my chicken before cooking for flavor......but everything else was great as is....loved it!!!

TIP......adding water is just so mixture won't stick...less is more...I would add small amounts at a time until I felt consistency was what I wanted.  Don't over do the amount of water....

I liked it. I used a whole tsp of oregano instead of half, doubled the garlic, and used 2 full cups of cheese. It was pretty easy and yummy (though definitely time consuming). I'll probably make it again.

I added the water before reading the reviews, but it was too soupy before anyway. To save the dish - add pasta that doesn't take long to cook (orzo, macaroni, etc), to soak up the liquid. I added macaroni I had in the pantry (about 1.5 cups), put on a lid and turned it down to med-low and it turned out great!

I cut the recipe in half and had enough filling for 5 tortillas. My result turned out too salty, so I'll watch the salt next time. Perhaps because of the saltiness, I felt the seasoning was lacking. I might add cumin next time. I used a fresh jalapeño instead of green pepper.

I followed some other suggestions for substitutions. I omitted the water and used chunky salsa instead of tomato juice. Considering the consistency of the end result with the substitution, I'm sure it would not have turned out too well with the water but who knows. I also didn't have parsley or oregano but it still turned out pretty good. Plus, I forgot the chilli powder. I think the salsa probably compensated for all of those missed ingredients.

I made these chicken enchiladas witb some  homemade enchilada sauce. I added some fresh peppers and herbs, cilantro from our garden but otherwise made them just as the recipe states. They were made for a community group and everyone loved them and had seconds.  I would definitely make them again!

Yea, I did everything as instructed two times and both times it turned out a soupy mess. The third time i used a half jar tomato sauce and no water. And it turned out delicious.

This was awesome !! I read reviews but always make everything my own. I loved this base recipe so much but I did change some things 

*I omitted half the water , because....I used a can of tomato soup + 1/4 cup water instead of tomato sauce (10.5oz can)
*I bought the 19oz red enchilada sauce, so I added 4 oz of it (1/2 cup) to the tomato soup to get the 15oz total that it called for 
* I deboned a rotisserie chicken and chopped that up instead of 4 breast 
* I added 1/2 tsp cumin, and a few chopped jalopanios to the chicken mixture, because they're not as mild as green chilies 
* 2% Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar 
* red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce 

These were such easy changes. I half wrote these down to share, half because I wanted to remember extactly what I did so I could make it again for my family !! What a huge hit !!

This was delicious! I added quite a bit more cheese, and instead of green bell pepper I used a can of green chilies and added a can of drained corn. Will be adding this to our favorite dishes!

Looks terrible when it comes out. I was mad until I tasted it. Yum! Great flavor. Used only 1 tsp of chili powder (we are lightweights). Placed them over Spanish rice. Veggies were crisp, not soggy.

Changes: No water, add a can of black beans, sub green chiles for the green pepper. Add some cayenne pepper. Pour 1 can of enchilada sauce on top. 1 package of shredded Mexican blend cheese split between the filling and the topping is perfect. 

I have also subbed cream cheese (half a block) for the sour cream and it's so good.

These are wonderful.  I didn't change anything this time, but next time I will leave out the additional salt, and let the individual diner ad it at the table.  There is enough salt in the cheeses.  It didn't "taste" too salty, but we were very thirsty later in the evening (for water, not margaritas  :)  ).

Turned out great! Changes included using PC Enchiladas dry mix in place of the chilli powder.  I cut my raw chicken into strips, sprinkle/rubbed with tsp. of cumin and poached for 15 minutes in a cup of chicken broth.  Removed chicken, set aside and shredded with two forks.  I cooked 1/3 of the onion, garlic,  1/2 cup chopped yellow/red bell pepper in 1-1/2 tbsp. of olive oil then added 14 oz. tomato sauce.   I made a reduction of the chicken broth adding a tsp. of butter, tsp. of all purpose flour and then stirred in the tomato sauce mixture, chicken and folded in sour cream, onion, cheddar cheese mix.  I topped each roll with a mild corn and black bean salsa, shredded old cheddar and dotted with broken pieces of provolone cheese.

This was way better than my Better Homes & Gardens enchilada recipe! I meal prep on weekends, so with this recipe, I made the filling ahead of time and stored it in Pyrex in the fridge. Filled the tortillas tonight, popped in the oven, super easy and tasted great. I will use less onion next time.

Based on reviews, I made a few changes. Boiled the chicken with spices to give it some flavor. (Btw I used 4 cups of shredded ckn) Mixed chunky taco sauce in with the chicken. Used enchilada sauce on top. Both sauces were the more traditional brands not the mass produced brands. I also added half a can of black beans. I'm not a huge enchilada fan but this was FABULOUS!! And other than the the tortillas, it's low carb!!!! Will make with low carb tortillas next time.

It smelled great, but after the first bite I was done! It was very soupy and tasted a bit sour. Only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because my boyfriend finished his and said it was okay, but does not want to touch the left overs.

VERY GOOD , TIME CONSUMING, We enjoyed these. I forget what real Mexican enchiladas taste like so I knew we would be fine with this for a change. Time is put into chicken prep. 
The chopping into chunks.  I used tec mex cheese  and a can of green chilies. Watch the chili it was good but don't over do  it. I did not use water, but did use full can of tomato sauce.
I think step 2 1/2 should be added. Prepare meat mixture in  morning . Let the meat and sauce mixture simmer for an hour to let the meat break up a bit more and obsorb the sauce . if you have time  even let it cool . Absolutely no problem or
messy soupyness to put together in afternoon. ILoveIt.

I tried it as written the first time and it was okay. Now I use rotisserie chicken for the meat, green chiles instead of bell pepper, and enchilada sauce instead of the salsa. I add water at the end, just what is needed to reach the consistency I want. It's delicious every time.

This was a soupy mess.  I couldn't even roll the filling in the tortillas--ended up making it like a layer lasagna.  I followed the recipe exactly too.  It tasted ok--had to add salt and hot sauce.  Not going to be making this again though.

I figured out the most awesome shortcut- Almost homemade! Our local supermarket sells fresh roasted chickens. Let chicken cool down, pull off all meat and you're good to go.

I agree with ditching the water and tomato sauce and replace with two or three cans of red enchilada sauce.

Easy breezy and no mess.
Thanks for the tip on freezing the left over chicken rolls.

These should be illegal so good. Did what others suggested~ no water, taco sauce instead of pasta sauce, mmmm sour cream on side for dipping, made chicken ahead of time cooked in water with chicken broth. Hubby wants to try brisket next time. Thank you!!!

I followed the directions to a T. All I ended up with was enchilada soup. Flavor was okay but, I was super disappointed. I won't make this again.

My family loves it! Next time I may omit the water as it seemed to make the filling a little too watery. Other than that, perfect! Thanks so much for sharing!

I grew up on enchiladas with corn tortillas.  I find that the flour tortillas just get soggy.  Bit more work to do corn but so worth it.  Flavor was good though

Used grilled chicken from grocery store deli section. Used corn and flour tortillas . Sub verde sauce for taco sauce. No green pepper. Chopped onion very small, and sauted in butter.

I always read the reviews of others before making something. I used variations from Patrick and a few others and it turned out great. Everyone loved them. Thank you to everyone who wrote a review to make this the best chicken enchiladas ever.

This is my first time making chicken enchiladas. I read a few reviews before I made it to get a feel of what to add/omit. I did simmer the chicken breasts in chicken broth to add flavor to the chicken. I omitted the water and used enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce. Overall my family deemed this recipe a success!  

TIP: The one way I shredded the chicken is to halve the breasts and put in my Kitchen-Aid mixer using the beater  attachment because I was having a heck of a time shredding it with two forks. The chicken came out nicely shredded!

I baked the chicken first with chili powder, s&p, cumin and garlic powder then shredded and also substituted enchilada sauce for the taco sauce but otherwise followed the recipe and it was very good!

I did not use tomato sauce because I ran out of it and instead used tomato paste.  I also did not add water because it was the consistency that I liked without it.

This recipe is REALLY good. Its pretty simple and straightforward and you dont need to do anything different to really have an excellent meal. I've made it probably 5-6 times now and used it after friends have had kids etc. everyone loves it. 

The mixture can be a little watery when you go to fill the tortillas. I like to just use just a little on the bottom of the pan and even dump the extra on the top once they're all filled and in the pan. Use a slotted spoon to fill to make it easier.

I also changed the recipe just a little, I omitted the water as others had said it was to wet, and added green chilies instead of green peppers and used an enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce.  It was really good

I would omit the water and tomato sauce. Mine wasn't as "soupy" because I actually had more chicken than it called for. I added a can of tomatoes and green chilies and some enchilada sauce on top instead of tomato sauce. Other than that, it was good.

It taste great. Half chili powder, half garlic, half the onion, when on the end of the second step reduce for 10 mins on high, add more cheese to thicken if you may of added too much water. When serving top with diced tomatoes, sour cream and chopped green onions then serve. Honestly it was absolutely delicious. Ps : during the first few steps season season and season salt and pepper!!!

The flavor was great -- although I added a tsp of cumin and tripled the garlic. The texture left something to be desired. I found the filling mushy and the tortillas a bit slimy. I think smaller tortillas might go a long way in resolving the sliminess, and maybe reducing the sour cream by a third to reduce the mushiness. The flavor was enjoyable enough that I will probably try this recipe again with those modifications.

Unlike so many others who obviously know their way around the kitchen, I don't. I made no substitutions and I thought this turned out great.  I did omit the water to prevent extra soupiness based on the other reviews.  I recently discovered this website and I'm learning to cook with all the wonderful recipes and tips from other reviewers. I would like to offer a tip for rookies like myself: put A little sauce in the bottom of the pan before adding the enchiladas. This will prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the dish.  If this was in the recipe I missed it.  Thanks for a great dish!

Did make this but added all the ingredients together into an electric pressure cooker, set it to ten mins. Chicken came out perfect, then scooped the chicken onto the tortillas, added the reamaning ingredients over them In the pan. Topped off with cheese and baked uncovered for  18 mins. Came out Sabrosa, served with Spanish rice. Can't go wrong!!!

A great recipe! I made this exactly as directed; however, since my husband does not like green peppers I put in a can of green chilies instead. I will omit the water next time. Although this was a little soupy, it baked up great and the enchiladas were moist instead of dried out like some recipes. Thanks for sharing. This will categorized in with my favorite recipes!

Didn't have taco sauce or tomato sauce. I used a can of enchiladas sauce instead for both filling and topping. No green peppers either.  Was delicious. Next time I'll throw in some corn, diced tomatoes, and black beans.

I make this all the time. I add more garlic and omit the taco sauce, opting instead for the chicken mixture to put on top. I also add about 8oz more cheese!!

I have made this dish several times. Like most others have posted, I omit the water and I also leave out the green peppers.  I use green chilies or black olives as  different variations.  One time I tried shredding the chicken but decided the cubed chicken works better. Always a favorite with my family and great as leftovers the following day.

I added refried beans on the tortilla shells before puttin the chicken mix on and i also added quinoa to the chicken mix. Super easy recipe. It seemed odd to add the cheese into the saute pan because i thought itd stick to my spoon and pan but if u dont ur cheese doesnt completely melt like it should.

Bland. Not as amazing as I would have hoped. Cutting down on the liquid would have helped the texture a bit. As for the flavor, there wasn't really anything to write home about.

loved this,  I did not use the sour cream, spices, chili pepper or green pepper.  We don't like spicy food.  kids loved It also.
Also, I adjusted the liquid.  I could tell it was too much liquid

I have made this a ton of times and it's definitely one of my favourites. I know it may not taste like traditional enchiladas but I  don't care, it's delicious. Really the only change I make  it I don't add the water and since I don't measure anymore I probably add way more cheese. 
Enjoy! :)

My husband loved this.  I thought it was a little soggy but it was very tasty.  I boiled the chicken and shredded it.  I wanted to use half the amount of sour cream and replace it with cream cheese but I didn't have any.  Maybe next time.  I used Mexican cheese instead of cheddar.  I used half the amount of tomato sauce and cut out the water all together.  I upped the chili powder to 1 1/2 tablespoons and added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.  Instead of green pepper I used a can of green chilis, but I think poblano would be great in this.  I used a 10 ounce can of enchilada sauce mixed with 1/4 cup of half and half instead of the taco sauce and I covered the dish with pepper jack cheese and baked for 30 minutes.

These turned out REALLY well. I cooked the chicken in the crock pot on high for 4hrs until it shredded nicely. I added 1/3 cup jalapenos, salt, pepper, and taco seasoning. I did not add any liquid because the chicken breasts were slightly frozen.  I omitted the water entirely, cut the tomato sauce in half and only add 3/4 cup of sour cream. The consistency was perfect and not at all runny.

Delicious!  My daughter, whose standard answer is "Good" when asked how something is, responded with her usual answer then immediately changed it to "Great!"  I made it even easier by using precooked chicken breasts so they shredded up beautifully and it cut the time even more.  I paired it with Mexican rice for a great easy weeknight meal.

It was good. I did use a lot of alterations suggested by other users. Poached the chicken, used a bit of the broth from poaching instead of the water, made an enchilada sauce and used it instead of the tomato sauce. (ps. i made a very mild sauce) and i added red and green pepper to the mix. I served it with a big mexican corn and bean salad as I thought the recipe did not serve 8 people.

I followed the recipe, but I did make a few adjustments. Instead of 4 chicken breasts, I cooked an entire bag of chicken (the frozen bags of around 6-8 chicken breasts). I placed the chicken in my pressure cooker with 1/4 cup onion, 1 cup water and 2 tablespoons of salt. Cooked for 20 minutes, then placed the chicken in my stand mixer's bowl. Shredded the chicken then cooked according to directions. Omitted the water. It was not watery at all and was enough to fill about 14 tortillas. I tasted the shredded chicken before adding any ingredients and it was very flavorful. Maybe doing this step beforehand will increase the flavors for those of you saying it didn't have enough.

I took the advise of many others and used chipotle salsa instead of tomato sauce.  it was good but a little too spicy for our taste.  will try regular salsa next time.  other than that it was very good!

This turned out so good. So easy to make and very delicious. Next time, I will make sure to double it and save a batch in the freezer for later.

Cube the raw chicken and sautee the peppers and onion with it. Add black beans, and serve with a flavored rice on the side. Also makes a VERY full 13x9 casserole dish. Would be worth halving the recipe in the future. Delicious!

My family LOVES this recipe. I probably make it at least once a month. I do a few things different for preference sake. I use a 4.5 oz can of chopped green chilies instead of bell pepper and red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. I also use 20 fajita sized tortillas as the smaller size better suits my children.

Just made this recipe, and its great!!!! Instead of water I used extra sour cream (accidentally), instead of taco sauce on top of them I used enchilada sauce (old el paso brand, I added a small tomato to the mix, and instead of Cheddar cheese I used Colby Jack in the mix and a Mexican blend of cheeses on top of them. It is really great thank you so much for sharing it!

This was delicious.  I listened to other reviewers and omitted the tomatoe sauce and water. I actually cook my seasoned chicken in the crock pot with green chiles and salsa. Then I  mix the sour cream and cheese before stuffing tortilla shells and baking. I cover with enchilada sauce and Monterey jack cheese!  I realize that I have created a completely different recipe so I probably should submit it. Lol!

I am a college student and cooking beginner, and this was a great meal for me to do because it's easy, cheap, stores well (important!) and tastes great. I took the advice on the review as and omitted the water, used half a can of salsa, and enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. It was watery when I added everything, but it was an easy fix as I just boiled out the liquid for 5-7 mins. I also poached and shredded he chicken, which I think pretty much makes this meal. I also used corn tortillas. So this was delicious but the reason I am giving it 4 starts is because of all these changes that have to be made to make it better.

I quadruple the recipe (we have a large family) and have left overs and have found the flavor even better the next day. I also use red taco sauce and green taco sauce, and puree all the veggies so the kids can't pick them out lol

Made a few modifications because of what I read in reviews and what I had in my pantry.
I doubled the recipe because I was making a meal for a friend and one for my family. 
I only had 5 large chicken  breasts, I cut them up into 2" pieces and cooked. I used tomato sauce but didn't add the water. The mix was really soupy as is. After all ingredients were combined (except I didn't have peppers so omitted them) it was still soupy so I added a can of cream of chicken and it was okay (still a little soupy but not as bad). I also added a can of chicken. I put green enchilada sauce on top instead of taco sauce. Turned out great and my friend said her and her family loved it!

Good, but season the chicken for sure. I season mine with cumin, garlic powder, onion powder and chili powder. Leave out the water unless you want a soupy mess. Using half tomato sauce and paste might be a good idea also. Didn't use a green pepper at all.

New staple for busy nights with "shift eating" and can be used for quesidillas too!  The liquid allowed me to simmer on low/melt for over an hour.  Quesidillas were ready within 10 min of each kid arriving (oven preheated).  Then when husband arrived, I made 2 wraps as described. I let them cook for 5-10 minutes (v 30 min) and they were great.  FYI... I halfed the recipe and served 2 enchiladas and 3 quesidillas with meat leftover. (Also, I am also thrilled to finally have a use for the taco sauce that comes in the taco kits).

I thougt this was a wonderful tasting dish only I found it to be so runny without adding the water I decided to just put it over rice and put a little shredded cheese on top with tortillas on the side. It was absolutely wonderful. This is how I will be making this dish iin the future.

We loved this but the one thing that we did do that was different was that because the sauce that it made was more runny, we used that to cover the enchiladas with. Everyone loved it, even the picky kids.

I tend to stay true to original recipes.  My changes were to save time and give the chicken more flavor at the same time.  Working 2 jobs, little time, small budget, and 3 teenagers makes you creative.  I buy 2 whole chickens and make the recipe off here Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style on weekend (when there's more time) then use left over chicken for the enchiladas next day.  Easily shaves 30 min. off cook time and is even tastier! I make it along with Mexican Rice II off here and viola!  Once you make both you can get the timing down to 35-40 min supper.  I did go by other suggestions too and used enchilada sauce instead of taco. And I always add extra cheese on top. Hope this helps!

This recipe calls for a whole onion; I used half an onion and it was still too much - and it wasn't even a very strong onion. I'll try this recipe again with less onion and then maybe give it 4 stars.

I've made this many times and we all love it. I cut down the chill powder to just a teaspoon. Skip the water and cut down the tomato sauce by half. We don't like onions or green peppers so we just omit and still love the taste.

This recipe was concerning at times as it seems a little soupy. I adjusted for 4 servings assuming it would be a good amount for between me&my boyfriend but it was SO MUCH once we began eating it. I put these in an 8x8 dish and managed to fit most of the stuffing in 6 tortillas with the extra stuffing on the sides. It turned out very well and we had leftovers for a couple of nights. This went great with a bean&corn salsa recipe I found as well as a tortilla soup recipe where we replaced the tortilla with quinoa.

Although I cannot rate this recipe entirely accurately, it was delicious. Because I was out of chicken I used leftover turkey, which worked great. Also, I used plain Greek yogurt in replacement of sour cream. Further I omitted the taco sauce and used tomato chunks rather than tomato sauce. However, because this was a very versatile recipe, it turned out great.

everyone loved it! I used garlic powder and onion powder because that's all I had, I omitted the water,  and then didn't put as much chili pepper because I had a toddler eating. Everything else was the same and it was awesome! I'm eating some leftovers right now!

These were so easy to make! I didn't mix in the sour cream since I'm the only one in the house who likes sour cream. I added it at the table. I also cubed the chicken before I grilled it as well great recipe!

Delicious! I shredded the chicken and spiced it up before rolling the tortillas, as per many recommendations. I also used the recipe for 10-minute-enchilada-sauce on this site. I will definitely make it again!

GREAT recipe! My fiance, sister and i reallllllly enjoyed these! This was my first attempted at ever making homemade enchiladas and i nailed it right outta the park! I did make a few changes, but nothing too major. First, I made a dry rub for the chicken of garlic powder, onion powder, oregano & pepper before cooking them. Some people complained of bland flavors so I thought this would help. Also, I'm not a fan of raw onion so after cooking the chicken, i sauteed the onion, green pepper & garlic. Finally, my local store was out of taco sauce so i used mild enchilada sauce. Since this was my first enchilada recipe, i may check out a different one next time to compare, but honestly these were so good i will most likely come back! PS, i did not shred the chicken like others recommended. It turned out just fine :)

This is my absolute favorite recipe to make! It's pretty labor intensive, I've made it about 10 times and it still takes me about 90min to prepare it. I omit the water, only use half the suggested chicken (it's more than enough) and doubled the green peppers. I also cook the onions before I put them in, so that they don't taste so raw. This recipe is a lot of work, but so freakin delicious. It's worth it!

It tasted good after I switched to enchilada sauce and replaced the peppers with chiles, however, even then - just okay.  This recipe requires too many alterations to have a texmex flavor.  I think recipes on Allrecipes should be able to stand on their own.

this turned out wonderful after following all the other reviews and did substitutions regarding the tomato sauce and used salsa, green chilies instead of green peppers... Will use again :)

Very good. I followed the previous reviewers suggestions and they turned out great. I Did not add water,  I used a can of medium enchilada sauce, boiled 4 chicken breasts and cut them up, salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little chili powder, only used 2 -3 tablespoons of sour cream not a whole container and a lot more cheese. I will definitely make again.

Loved the seasoning but leave out the tomato sauce & water and sub in enchilada sauce.  Now it won't be so soupy and it will taste more like real Mexican enchiladas

I just made the enchiladas just as the directions say except I shredded the chicken instead of cubes it but oh my goodness they were amazingly delicious. My dad couldn't believe that was my very first time ever making enchiladas. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone and every one. Thank you

This was delicious! It is very rich and we could only eat two a piece, FYI. I only used about 8 ounces of tomato sauce. I carmalized the onions in the same pan as I cooked the chicken. I used thinned sliced chicken breast and just chunked it as it cooked, as the recipe states I did strain to get rid of the cooked off fat. I will be making this again and again! Picky husband loved it!

This is the second time I've made this recipe and I follow it exactly how it's written. If you cook off some of the liquid, it's easy to fill the shells and you won't have a "hot, soupy, mess".  I do season the chicken and add extra garlic.  I am going to try other variations with this recipe, but my family and guests were happy with it the way it was.  I do want to try some of the variations that other reviewers have tried.  It's an easy recipe to play around with.  Makes a great, hearty meal for a family of four, with plenty of leftovers!  I'm going to make extra next time and freeze it for later.

This is a favorite of ours. I used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce and is was not soupy at all. Instead of taco sauce I used "The best red enchilada sauce" from this site...very good!

Pretty Good! Not authentic but as good as any homemade enchiladas I've ever had. I did as one person said, and used ground turkey, and instead of bell peppers, I used canned green chilies. Then I also deleted the water, and simmered this until the mixture was slightly dry. Then I used a canned enchilada sauce that I already liked.  I think this would be a great taco filling, too. Thanks.

This recipe is fantastic. I didn't add the water that was suggested and it came out wonderful. My family has asked me to make it again next week and to freeze for our upcoming vacation. It's definitely a winner in this house. Thanks!

Made tonight for the first time and it was delicious!! Followed most of the recipe but I did a couple subtle changes.  Boiled the chicken in water and chicken bouillon.  Also added cayenne pepper to the saucy mixture to give it more of a kick! Yum yum ;)

I really loved the flavor the my husband and his friends loved it as well. Seeing as how this was my first time making it, things went a little slow but I liked this recipe because it was pretty simple even though it took some time. My husband's only request was that I put jalapenos init next ttime (he says that about everything though!). This wasn't messy to make and easy to clean up! I will definitely make this again and again.

We used marscapone instead of sour cream and reduce the amt of chili (8ml) as ours tends to be hotter.

I added adobo and sazon to the seasoning as well as half a jalapeño for flavor. Cut the water out so it's not too runny. Turned out delicious!!

I got a soupy mess. I wish I read the other comments before making this for my family. Oh well, lesson learned.

These were fantastic, with modifications, of course. I omitted the tomato sauce, water, chili powder & taco sauce, per others' suggestions. I replaced them with 4 oz cream cheese & 1 can enchilada sauce. I use green enchilada sauce with chicken & red with beef. I also poached the chicken in chicken bouillon water and shredded it first. Then I mixed in the rest of the ingredients. It turned out so tasty and it was very easy to make. Thanks!

Wow! I used a whole two pound rotisserie chicken thinking I would save time, but I don't think it really did. I used salsa verde and a Mexican cheese blend with the chicken for the filling, and red enchilada sauce and the blend of cheeses for the top. Even my four year old thought it was awesome :) served with yellow rice and refried beans.

Kids really liked it. Easy to put together just takes a little time. Great recipe to prep the night before and throw in the oven when you get home.

Despite some of the negative criticism I still decided to try this recipe.  All in all, I think it was pretty good although I did tweak it slightly based on my own preferences.  I seasoned the chicken in the pan with garlic powder. cayenne, cumin, and chili powder and poached it in chicken stock after searing. It was very moist!! I did not add the water as per the recipe. Once adding the tomato sauce etc... I cooked down the liquid until it was my desired thickness.  I made my own taco sauce as I didn't have any on hand.  For my family it still could have been spicier despite it all! Thanks for sharing! :)

These are great! Like others, I omitted the water and poached the chicken. What a flavorful, fantastic base! I've made this 4 times now with shredded pork and shredded chicken. Fabulous!

This was very good, but using all those liquids would really have made it too soupy. Instead of the water, tomato sauce, and taco sauce, I just used a 19 oz. can of red enchilada sauce, using about 1/3 of the can in with the filling mixture, and the other 2/3 on top of the enchiladas in the baking dish. Husband and son approved; this is definitely being put into the regular dinner rotation at my house.

To me it was just OK. BF hated it. I asked him if he wanted me to pack this in his lunch for tomorrow and he said, "no, I'll pass"! First time he's ever said that. Still looking for another recipe maybe with corn tortillas and enchilada sauce.

This recipe was awesome.  I added a can of green chilies in with the green bell peppers as well as made my own enchilada sauce to top everything with.  The mixture was a little soupy but it was truly delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.

Omit the tomato sauce, taco sauce and water. Use 1 can medium enchilada sauce.  Also sub green chiles for green pepper. You can also use a verde sauce if that's more your taste with chicken.  I followed the recipe to a T and these are my recommendations.

I have made this recipe twice, and it's delicious!  The 1st time I was just web surfing for a chicken enchilada recipe.  The second time I had to hunt for this one and joined this web site and saved it to my recipe box!  I highly recommend this one if you want to make chicken enchiladas!

Based upon other reviewers, I made a few modifications.  Cubed the chicken before sautéing in the pan - sprinkled chili powder and pepper on chicken to add flavor. Used 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup Greek yogurt along with the cheese and added sliced black olives. Topped with mild chunky salsa (Trader Joe's) and cheese, as others stated the water and tomato sauce made it soupy. It's a little dry - next time I'll try adding enchilada sauce.

Interesting I would say...it DID start out SUPER SOUPY. But, since I have made enchiladas before I know what kind of sauce thickness I like, and when I saw how this was VERY runny before I added the taco/enchilada sauce I skipped it and just added what was in the pan already to the top of the rolled (best I could with it so runny) enchiladas like I usually do otherwise. And then added the cheese. I am guessing that the cooking must have cooked off a good deal of water as it came out a lot closer to what I would expect for "soupiness".

It tasted wonderful. However, I would definitely not add the water. I added the water and only 8 oz of tomato sauce and it was still extremely soupy. I managed to thicken it up enough to make it work, with a whole lot of corn starch.

Yummy!! Everyone in my family loved it. The only reason I took a star away is because it was a little runny. Some people like that, I don't. I let the water boil out and used about 3/4 the can of tomato sauce. Still really, really good!

I've been using this recipe to a T since 2008, i love it and anyone who has tried it has also! It always makes more than one 9x13 dish of the enchiladas though which is no complaint on my end but buy extra tortillas! :-) Yesterday I made a portion of them half vegitarian. I didn't add the chicken back tot he skillet, instead I held it aside chopped and added eerything else. I seperate a portion fo it into a bowl and added rinsed black beans to it- enough that made for a good thickness of filling. I then added the chicken tot he skillet. I made a 9x13 dish of the chicken ones and a caserole dish half that size for the vegitarian ones. Both came out fantastic! I highly recommend this recipe and will certainly make the black bean version again too! What a cheap meal that is!

This was a great recipe but I don't understand why you had to add water esp since the recipe includes tomato sauce. Don't add water to this!

Absolutely amazing! I would maybe use a little less onion next time, but otherwise this recipe is perfect.

This recipe has potential. I cut the black pepper and only used 1/2TBL chili powder and it still came out too spicy to eat (and I'm from Texas and eat jalapenos with everything!). I would cut out the chili powder completely and if you want a kick use medium taco sauce instead of mild.

My family loves this recipe and I make it at least once a month.  It is even easier using precooked chicken. I cook a family pack of chicken breasts in the crockpot and then package them into separate meal sized bags to freeze. I just take them out when I need them.  I don't add any water when adding it to the chicken mixture in the skillet and just eyeball the rest of the ingredients.  Also, I use corn tortillas to make these more authentic "enchiladas".  Love this recipe :)

I followed the recipie as far as ingredients were.concerned but I put all ingredients except sour cream, cheese and items from topping in crock pot. I cooked it on high for 8 hours due to the fact that the chicken was frozen. The chicken basically fell apart which saved me all the hassle of shredding the chicken. It was just the right amount of liquid so no sloppy mess! I then added cheese and sour cream and blended it together then followed the directions for stuffing and topping enchiladas! They turned out great and it was a time saver!!!!

So delicious!  Do not make this if you're looking to eat light though...it's very flavorful so you can't stop at just one.  Great weeknight family meal...everyone was satisfied and wants me to make it again.

Made this for my family, it was amazing and they loved it. I did poach the breasts in chicken stock and used a hot salsa instead of the tomato sauce and water along with a bit of chilli sauce,  also used hot taco sauce on top with the cheese, they were quite hot and spicy very nice.

Good recipe, stuck to the recipe for the most part except I didn't use as much sour cream, and I used fresh parsley instead of dried due to the fact I didn't have it. I screwed up on the water and added around 1/3 cup to what ended up being 5 enchiladas using an adjusted 3 chicken breast 4 servings recipe. The chicken after I added the sour cream and other ingredients in step 2 yielded a very soupy combination, I drained some of fluids and it seemed to fix some of the issues. That's probably more on me if anything.  Overall it was a tasty recipe.

Great recipe!!  Had no taco sauce or chili powder, but salsa and cumin worked well. I had to add flour since the mixture was too liquidity. Tastes  great but may not be the best for the waistline.

We love this recipe!  Only change I made was to not include the sour cream as we put dome on once ots cooked and I also added extra garlic and omitted the water. One of the easiest and tastiest recipe I found!

This was a FANTASTIC recipe! My hubby and I made it, and we were both very fun after 1.5 enchilladas. Next time I make it I will invite people over! :-)  Also, it's much easier to cook if you whip up everything in a wok frying pan, just so it's deeper and easier to stir. You house will smell heavenly!

I have never made enchiladas before but those were just great! Great recipe! I changed some little things, like using low fat sour cream, low fat cheese and whole wheat tortillas to make it a bit healthier and it worked just fine.

1) I don't use flour tortillas. The texture is too soft as soon as they're out of the oven and the leftovers are so mushy they're almost inedible.  Use yellow corn tortillas. 
2) I think there's no need for the water.  It weakens the flavor and there is plenty of liquid in this recipe without it. Just leave it out.
3) Your hands should be messy by the time you're done making this.  Dip the corn tortilla in the slightly soupy mixture, lay it in the baking dish, spoon in some filling, roll and repeat.  This helps to moisten the corn tortilla a bit and makes the flavor seep into every bite.
The flavor was pretty good.  I'm sure this was nothing like "authentic" enchiladas, but it was tasty enough that my picky husband requested I make it again with corn tortillas.

My family & I loved this dish! I've never made enchiladas before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I guess I didn't cook it down long enough (a bit soupy), so I just filled the tortillas with a slotted spoon, mixed the left-over "gravy" with the taco sauce, then poured over all, topped with cheese, and baked as directed. Thank you for sharing!

Ok My family all liked it, I followed the recipe except for simmering the chicken breast in broth and omitting the water, but my only complaint was the onion does not cook through, it should be cooked a bit first so it is not crunchy.There is a video on this recipe and it shows them sautéing the onion a bit first,and by the way it does show them adding in the water which I didn't but theirs looked ok?I don't think it needed the water, my filling was perfect except for the onion.

I tweeked the recipe a little after I made it the first time. I addded black beans, corn, green chilies. I also used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, a red bell instead of green bell pepper, and used half the amount of tomato sauce and no water.

OMG seriously sooooo good.
I didn't add as much chicken, but that's a personal preference, i followed the recipe almost exactly. Fantastic! Thank you

Yummly.  I changed things, like everyone, end result was good.  Used chicken that I'd already seasoned, cooked, diced, and frozen for just such an occasion as this recipe.  Replaced the green bell peppers with green chiles, omitted oregano but added cumin and a dash of chili powder.  Used my homemade enchilada sauce and whole wheat tortillas.  I did not expect to follow the recipe exactly, and was really just using it as a base for proportions more than anything.  I think the reviewer that suggested cream cheese might be on to something, I'll try that next time.  At any rate, I hit the potluck with a full pan and came home with an empty one so no complaints!

very tasty. Good recipe, but patrick is right; it seems to turn into a soupy mess which results in soggy enchiladas. I will try the altered recipe next time. They taste great though!

I made it twice, the first time as suggested. it was very good.  The second time i used a can of chipote peppers in adobo sauce, the extra spice was much more to my liking.
This is also one of son's favorites. So not only is it great but its kid appoved
thanks

I make these often but I don't really follow the recipe. I make a healthier version. I use whole wheat tortillas, and I don't use sour cream. I cook the chicken as described and add seasoned canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I cover the tortillas in enchilada sauce (I typically buy one can of green, and one can of red), then bake as directed. They come out delicious, and eveyone loves them!

My husband loved it.  Since he's not a lover of Mexican food that says a lot.  I didn't use the full amount of chili pepper which was probably the reason for his liking.  Additionally it was easy to make.

I couldn't figure out why this recipe would not call for a regular can of enchilada sauce (I usually make my own verde with canned tomatillos) but went against my better judgement and used the jar of Ortega taco sauce. Nothing against the sauce itself, but in the end these enchiladas tasted like strong taco sauce and not much else. I tasted the filling and liked it, so I would recommend using an actual enchilada sauce instead of an entire jar of taco sauce.

SKIP adding the water, you don't need it.  If you cook with a TBSP of oil you don't need the water, it would just make a total mess.

I added black beans and Srircha and it was YUMMY.  I also used Janes Mixed Up Pepper in place of salt and black pepper and I don't measure.  I eyeball it by covering the top with a light layer.  If you are familiar with Janes seasoning, you'll know how much to use :O)  Great recipe for those that LOVE mexican food.

I make this all the time. If you want to make it gluten free just use corn tortillas.  I make it both ways depending on my guests needs.  I also add a bit more garlic.

This is one of my favourite dishes to make, well loved by kids too!  I did make 2 changes, first off I used a roasted chicken instead, it had great flavour!  I also omitted the water, by the time I got to that step I found that it was "watery" enough and really I didn't even need it.  It does take some time to put it all together but it was worth it, I love this for dinner parties and often just double the recipe to accommodate.....leftovers taste even better!!

This was my first time making an enchiladas.  They were a big hit with everyone.  My daughter requested seconds and asked that leftovers be packed in her lunch the next day.  I used low fat sour cream and 2% cheddar just to save on fat and calories a bit; and I forgot to add the water. It was still delicious. 
I don't normally do the cooking in my house, but seeing my family's reaction to this wonderful dish just makes me want to cook more.  Thanks for an easy, delicious recipe!

This is the BEST! This is my 2nd time trying to make Enchiladas (first time with this recipe) and they came out absolutely delicious. My boyfriend was thoroughly impressed! :) I poached the chicken first and shredded it and instead of taco sauce, I made my own Enchilada sauce. YUMMM

This tastes fabulous, substituted Salsa for tomato sauce and chopped green chilies for the green peppers.  Smells wonderful while cooking.  Used fresh garlic and added the chopped the green part of a scallion on the finished product for color.

I always read reviews but for some reason this time I didn't which is why it only gets 2 stars.  It was way too soupy if you follow the recipe.  Too many modifications are needed to make this recipe greater than 2 stars.  There are a lot better enchilada recipes than this.

LOVED IT - my kids even gave me a high five for this one.. Husband said you can make this one again!! I didn't use the green peppers - I used a 4 oz can of green chiles instead.

This was fantastic. Although as everyone said cut the water and maybe some of the tomato sauce. I also didn't use oregano I ran out. But I did everything the same. I also used a mexican cheese blend. And added cayenne pepper.

This had excellent flavor and texture. I read the other reviews that said this was soupy, so I left out the water and added a teaspoon of flour to thicken the sauce. It was FABULOUS! My husband loved it too.

Not my favorite enchilada recipe.  I think it would be better with the sour creme on top--and as always, with the tortillas fried!

I eliminated the water and used a garlic tomato sauce to increase the consistency. I also added red pepper with the green pepper and used red onion to make it more flavourful. I served it with mexican rice and refried beans and my boyfriend had it gone in one night! Delicious and easy!

my family thought this was amazing! i am new to eating things like onions and bell pepper and i fed this to my 1yr old and 3 yr old and we all loved it! i really liked that it wasnt too spicy to feed to my kids. the one thing i did differently was i boiled the chicken and shredded it, and added some more cheese :)

I put all the ingredients in a crock pot on low for 7 hours.  Put the chicken in frozen! It tasted great just to runny for my taste.  I will try some of the other varations next time, but quick and easy and good!

Had to cook down for almost an hour to get it thick enough - Don't use that much liquid.  However, did save some for sauce on a Taco Salad.

Very good

Delicious, decided to do this one at a moment's notice and it was quick and easy.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is shred the chicken instead of chunk it up.

These are DELICIOUS! My husbands exact words with a full mouth were 'If you ever leave me can we still be friends so I can come over to eat?'....my 4 year old who usually wants nothing but mac & cheese ate two! I didn't put the water and added black olives and jalapenos to the top. Kinda time consuming but so easy!

I tried this recipe and must say it was one of the better ones I have used.  I like the spice combination, didn't have the bell pepper, but that was fine.  I shredded the chicken and got nothing but good reviews when I served it.  Thank you, its a keeper.

I liked these but my husband did not, he doesn't like Mexican unless it's from a restaurant. I omitted the tomato soup & water, I used salsa instead. Also, I didn't have a green pepper. I used wheat tortillas. Over the top I used enchilada sauce. I am freezing the ones that weren't eaten for another night. Must soften the onions next time, I don't like the crunch of the onions...

Overall, a very tasty dish.  I used fat free sour cream and soy cheese to make it lower in fat.  I also used a can of Rotel in place of the tomato sauce and water.  I'll be keeping this one in the recipe box!

Delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  Didn't have bell peppers.  I baked the chicken in the oven.  I used 1 9oz can of tomato sauce and then a can of fire roasted tomatoes with green chilies.  YUMMY!  I didn't add water and didn't top with salsa.

Used fat free sour cream, no water, salsa instead of taco sauce and just "Italian Seasoning" in place of other seasonings and it turned out great.  A little prep work was needed.  I cooked the chicken in the oven earlier in the day so all I had to do later was put on the stovetop and fill the tortillas.  Thanks for the recipe!  :-)

The recipe is good.  I had to change it a bit based on what I had in the house.  I used salsa in place of the tomato sauce and water.   I didn't have taco sauce either so I just spooned some of the sauce over the top and covered with cheese.  I eyeballed all of the ingredients, didn't measure anything.  It came out really good. I changed how I put this together a little too.    I put the onion, garlic and spices in with the chicken while it was browning.   Then I added the salsa and the rest of the ingredients.  I let that simmer for a bit and then stuck it in the oven.  I didn't want the chicken to have no flavour. I served with some taco chips for dipping in the sauce and a salad.  Good idea!

Me and the whole family enjoyed these. I didn't have taco sauce, so I used the extra filling and poured it over the top. Will be making it again. Edit: So much better this time! I added some corn into the mix this time, which added some nice sweetness. Left out the water to keep the sauce thick and cooked the onions with the chicken- actually it was turkey. Just put some tomato sauce and the cheese on top. Everyone loved them!

I made this recently for my daughters sleepover and 4 out of 4 girls gave this two thumbs up!!!  One little lady would have given more thumbs up if she had more thumbs.  I sauteed the chicken in taco seasoning and, like other reviewers, left out the water and I was still worried about how moist it was.  It was a bit time consuming to make because I had the shred the cheese myself, would not do this if it was a weeknight!!!     It was yummy and plan to make it this weekend...maybe a double batch just in case I have a lazy night!!!!

I made this for my husband and he L-O-V-E-D it! I added a bag of thawed spinach to the chicken and sauce mixture, and a little more salt to the spinach. It allowed me to make 10 heavily stuffed tortillas.

these are delicious! I did not add the water. so the filling would be thicker. The second time I made these, i substituted the green pepper, onion, and tomato sauce with salsa, just because I didnt have any. It was very delicious. both times I have made these everyone loved them and needless to say there werent any leftovers.

I very much enjoyed this recipe, although I did following some suggestions to modify it.  I boiled my chicken breasts in stock and then shredded.  Added the herbs/spices, a couple spoons of salsa, diced green chiles and cheese and stirred.  Scooped that mix into the tortillas and got 7 (snacked on the 8th torilla!).  I used a Mexican cheese blend and red enchilada sauce on top.  After baking for 20 min I turned the broiler on to brown the top a bit.  Next time I will add the sour cream and maybe some corn or beans to the filling.  Thanks for the recipe!!

A year ago I could barely fry bacon, but today I made a delicious enchilada! This is such a great recipe. It took a little bit of patience, but with a glass of wine and a hungry appetite I was able to make a flavorful meal. My only suggestion would be to eye-ball the ingredients...use your judgement to figure how much each is needed for your chicken.

I followed the recipe to a T except I left out the tomatoes because I was making the Best Enchilada Red Sauce from this site and it has tomatoes in it.  I'm over dosed on tomatoes right now.  I made refried beans and Spanish rice because I was afraid the enchiladas would bomb. My first such effort.  No one touched the refried beans or the rice because these were so awsome.  Mine were soupy but my family is now convinced that Mexican food has to be soupy to be really good.  Thank you Debbie.  Great verstile and forgiving recipe.

I thought that 15 oz of tomato sauce was a little much, as it made it kind of soupy for putting into my enchiladas, and I would wait to sprinkle the cheese about half way into the cooking, but beyond that, this is a great recipe.

Forget the tortilla. Crush up some tortilla chips and you got a nice enchilada soup:)

These enchiladas are so easy.  The flavor is really good.  My family loves this dish and I make it several times a month.  If you have any left over chicken mixtures, it freezes well too.

My boyfriend loved these!! I did change a couple of things on the recipe, instead of using tomatoes I just used 15 oz. of Picante sauce and did not add anymore onion, I also used a Rotisserie chicken and just shredded it to save time! They were awesome!!!

Excellent meal! It was "kid approved" by my girls! I followed everything as directed, except I did not have taco sauce so I used enchilada sauce. I used whole wheat tortillas, and mixed in diced canned tomatoes and mushrooms in the enchilada sauce before I poured it over the enchiladas. It had a wonderful authentic Mexican entree taste.It will be a family favorite! YUMMY!!

These enchiladas are very good and tasty...just took a bit longer for me to make w/ all the additions etc. I did not use the taco and tomato sauces, I used a red enchilada sauce--though I didn't choose a very good one--  It will make a difference, so find one you like if using an enchilada sauce.  Overall, a great recipe that is easy to tweak and adjust to your tastes...will make again for sure!

A yummy recipe that is basically fool proof.  Like the other readers, I omitted the chili powder, tomato sauce, water and taco sauce in favor of enchilada sauce & salsa.  I broached my chicken to give it some extra flavor as well.

Wow!  I was pleased to find this recipe that does NOT use a can of condensed soup!  I, too, left out the water and tomato sauce and instead used one can of Ro-tel, slightly drained.  Next time I plan to use 1 1/2 cans. Big hit with my family-served with refried beans, sliced avocado and fresh fruit salad.

I followed the recipe exactly - YUM!  Really tasty enchiladas, and I would make them ALL the time if they didn't take me so long! (haha... I am a slow chef!) But they are worth the extra effort, and taste wonderful heated up the next day, too.

We loved this!!!!  The only thing I changed was using cans of white chicken instead of the frozen chicken breast.  This had alot of flavor.  It makes  A LOT....we froze half of it for another busy night.  This a great recipe that can be made with changes.  Thanks Debbie, its a keeper!!!

These were actually pretty good! I did make a few changes to this recipe including boiling the chicken instead of cooking it in a skillet. I added 2 cans of chicken broth plus another can of water to a pot and boiled the chicken for 5 or so minutes. Then I covered it, let it sit and simmer for about 10 additional minutes. I shredded the chicken instead of dicing them and used that water/both mixture to replace the 1/2 cup of water. I'm also a cheese lover, so I doubled the amount of cheddar cheese. And instead of adding chili powder, I just bought a jar of HOT taco sauce. It was perfect.

Big hit with my husband who loves Mexican. Our favourite Mexican restaurant closed and this recipe satisfied our craving. They turned out just like the enchiladas we would order. I served Mexican Rice II, guacamole and sour cream in order to complete the meal. They were so tasty that I couldn’t resist and had seconds. I froze the extra enchiladas as another reviewer suggested. Will definitely make them again.

This makes a TON of enchiladas so I would cut in half if you don't have a big crowd! They are tasty but I like my mexican food spicy. Used enchiladas sauce in place of the tomato sauce. If you use the sauce you don't have to add chili powder, water and taco sauce. If you make the full amount, you'll be able to fill at least 12-16 flour tortillas, unless you over stuff them. One is more than enough per person especially if you serve with spanish rice as a side.

Very tasty . This was my first time using this recipe and it's a keeper. I reduced the ingredients by a half  because I was cooking for two. I used Trader Joe's Salsa Authentica instead of a jar of taco sauce and reduced fat sour cream. This would be good dish to make for a larger group. Also I followed the tip from reviewers to reduce the amount of liquid to avoid soupiness.

MMmmm, I used homemade flour tortillas and homemade taco sauce in mine, diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and it is kind of bland, maybe I need more spices. Very Nice!

KILLER!  We strayed a bit - didn't use any tomato sauce or taco sauce...we intended to add enchilada sauce, but forgot to - didn't matter!  This filling is awesome:  creamy and flavorful!  We totally added more cheese and slathered additional cheese and enchilada sauce over the tops...we used 6 chicken breasts, and made 11 or 12 enchiladas...though we couldn't get our two year old to touch it, our adult guests RAVED.  Hoping to make this monthly if not bi-weekly - these things ROCK!  (And just like lasagna, are even better next day!!)

Made it with beef instead of chicken (mainly because I had beef that needed to be used).  made the enchiladas ahead of time & chilled in the fridge until we were ready to start dinner.  Worked out great!  I'd probably go with enchilada sauce next time, and a bit more cheese for the top.

For me this was good but nothing more.  I guess depending on how spicy your enchilada sauce will determine the spice from the overall dish, because I used Las Palmas Mild and it was quite a bit spicy! Definitly not a resturant quality dish but is fairly inexpensive and easy to prepare.  I would not use this recipe again, however.

I made a few adjustments.  Added salsa instead of the tomatoes and water, and green chiles in place of the green pepper.  Also added black olives.  Will definitely make this again.

Not too sure if i will make these again. The mix was very soupy and came oozing out of the wrapper. Also, i would say to not add salt. Even my husband who salts everything said these were too strong. I like mine the way I have always made them..chicken, chilis, cheese, and enchilada sauce..nice and simple.

This was wonderful! My whole family enjoyed these enchiladas, even my picky 5-yr-old. I have to admit I was running late so didn't measure any of the ingredients. I just flung or shook them into the pan. I also used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. And thin-sliced chicken breasts instead of thick ones. And in spite of all this, the enchiladas were absolutely delicious.

A really yummy recipe...don't let the number of ingredients deter you!  I made this with a few revisions.  I bought a medium sized rotisserie chicken (they're alreday seasoned!) and deboned it.  I only used an 8oz can of tomato sauce, no water, no oregano, added a can of great northern beans, and used enchilada sauce to coat the bottom of the pan and then poured it over the enchiladas, along with the taco sauce.  My hubby is not a fan of chicken in his Mexican dishes, but he loved this.  They reheat really well and are filling.  Give them a try!!!

At my dinner table there is a toddler who doesn't like her food mixed, a pre-teen who "hates" chicken every other day, and a gourmet food-loving husband.  I rarely find a meal that makes everyone happy but they all loved this dish!  I took the suggestions of the other reviewers right off the bat so it wouldn't be too soupy and it was spectacular.

This sauce is so good, it takes a lot of willpower not to eat it before the enchiladas are assembled! Once they're done, I take extra tortillas and tear them up and sop up the leftover sauce in the skillet! :) AWESOME recipe - my kids beg for it! Thanks!

We tried this out as another way to use up stewed chicken (that we mostly do to make stock!).  It is great for that, and was a pretty simple recipe to follow.  Personally, we just enjoy another recipe on the site that calls for cream of chicken soup, but we might use this one again just to change it up a bit.  Thanks!

Almost a home run on the first try. A really great dish! My only modifications are add a can of black beans and use a little less tomato sauce. The tomato sauce plus the taco sauce makes it a little more tomato flavored than I prefer. I used whole grain tortillas which don't fold as well as plain white flour tortillas but they're healthier!

This was really good. altogether. However, without the taco sauce it would have been very bland. Next time I will play around with the ingredients a bit. It must taste yummy without the sauce or it just isnt a good enough recipe in my book.

My parents are very picky when it comes to what they eat, and they LOVED this. They were telling everyone how it tasted very authentic, and people have started asking me for the recipe! The only changes I made was I didn't use the 1/2 cup of water, I boiled and then chredded the chicken, and I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. Great recipe!

Flavor of the filing is good if you take the advice of others and substitute some of the ingredients with salsa and enchilada sauce.  However, the flour tortillas turned to mush which is not very appetizing in my opinion.  It may be a lot better with corn tortillas.

These were really salty and seemed more like a casserole dish than traditional enchiladas. Not for me, but worth a try-you may like 'em!

Great recipe with some modifications. I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I heated them in a skillet with a small amount of oil to prevent breakage first (standard enchilada procedure). I also used shredded chicken which I poached in water, and added a half a chicken buillon cube---will save the leftover broth for something else. I used fresh parsley (because I had it), added a pinch of cayenne pepper and an extra garlic clove-and instead of the water and tomato sauce I used a can of Rotel (which I would drain next time) and a small amount of salsa. Also used monterrey jack cheese and a packet of enchilada sauce. Yum yum.

THESE WERE AWESOME! I took out the water, made it too supey if I did not. I added 8 oz cream cheeze and 4 oz montery jack cheese. If you add the water by accident, just mix in a 8 oz can of tomato paste and it will fix the problem. I added a half can of tomato paste to my recipe anyways, and IT WAS AWESOME! This is one of my favorite recipes to make! Oh, and after I am done rolling the enchiladas, I add the left over sauce, NOT CHICKEN, to the top of these enchiladas and then brush taco sauce on top of that, of course fallowed with cheese. YUMMY!

Do not add the water!  This recipe is perfect and super delicious the way it is, just do not add the water.  Yes, it is a little sloppier than you'd expect, but ALL of the flavors work great together, and the extra liquid bakes out.

An overall good recipe, but I made a few changes. I used a fork to pull apart the chicken instead of cubing it. Instead of the water I used another can of tomato sauce (but still boiled it down). I used a little extra chili powder and added some cumin. Also, I used a jar of taco sauce on top... not so good. Next time I will definitely make my own sauce.

With my edits, I give it 5 stars!  I halved the recipe, instead of tomato sauce I used enchilada sauce, I didn't use water, I added some cottage cheese (I had some to use up), and instead of taco sauce I used enchilada sauce for on top.

This recipe gets 5 stars for the taste but the excessive liquid bumped it down to a 4.  Liquid was running out of the enchilada as I was putting it in the dish.  It made the tortilla too soggy for my taste.  Some reviewers added salsa which would be a good idea or just cut the tomato sauce in half and leave out the water.  I used about 2 cups shredded chicken.  I cooked a whole chicken instead of using boneless skinless.  I will make this recipe again since it did have a good flavor.

I followed some reviewers suggestions:  I poached my chicken and shredded it.  Then in a bowl I mixed the chicken with the cheese, onions, spices (added some cayenne pepper), 4 oz can green chili's, 12 oz medium pace salsa, and used reduced fat sour cream.  On top of the tortilla's I used one can of enchilada sauce and cheese.  An offset frosting spatula works great for getting the enchiladas out of the pan!

Fantastic recipe! I made it for lunch and everybody loved it! I did not add any water but half a can of tomato soup and it turned out great. I would recommend medium enchilada sauce (some spiciness to it). Overall a it was great!!

THe best Enchiladas I've had! Didn't use the sour cream, and used hot Enchiladas sauce instead of taco sauce and it added a kick. Might add jalapenos as a topper as well for an extra spicy expirience.

Very easy to prepare.  These are good, but the sauce was thin.  Next time I will not add the water.  I scooped the meat mixture out of the pan and used the remaining sauce to pour over the enchiladas.  Did not need to pour the salsa on. Personally I like a lot more heat, so next time I will add some jalapeno juice from jarred jalapenos.  I also substituted 3 fresh, seeded, de-vained, jalapenos for the green pepper.  I topped with some sliced olives, and next time I will also add some scallions to the top.  I think once I 'tweek' this recipe it will suit our taste perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe, Debbie. :-)

Very good recipe, I too omitted the water and added salsa (which is a little watery itself), as well as using enchilada sauce. Also, following others' reviews I boiled the chicken breasts in broth and shredded it, which I think make this recipe more authentic. My entire family loved them! Thanks!!

These are fantastic and really addictive  I modified the recipe as follows:  Added a jalapeno pepper to chicken recipe as well as some fresh cilantro omitted the water (makes it way to runny) Low fat sour cream I boiled, then shredded the chicken  i sauteed the onion, garlic and peppers, then added the tomato sauce, spices sour cream and cheese.  then added the chicken  I used enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce and cooked it for about 30 minutes until most of the sauce was absorbed.  Enjoy!!!!!

I hated enchiladas until I made this. These are awesome! I may try using enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce next time...It seemed too thin. I also added some black beans, corn and fresh cilantro to the chicken mixture.

As many others mentioned, I tried making this recipe with the adjustments of first sauteing the green pepper in olive oil with the garlic and onion (I used dried bc I didn't have a fresh one), then adding only 8 oz. tomato sauce and no water.  I also used the enchilada sauce on top instead of the taco sauce.  I thought it turned out GREAT!  Very very yummy!

Fantastic taste! Seriously, my husband dances around the house when I tell him I'm making this for dinner. It's his favorite by far. The only thing I did differently was reduce the salsa in the chicken mixture to only two tablespoons of black bean salsa. I added some fresh cilantro to the mix too. So, so delicious and easy.  It's great for any week night meal and for new cooks. No side dish required.

I thought it was good, but not great.  I did not add the water per another reviewer and I am so glad I did not; it would have been a soupy mess.  I cooked the onion and green pepper before adding them.

I have made this recipe several times, and I was never a fan of chicken enchiladas before (only beef). I recommend following the recipe as is. I do not think it is necessary to change the taco sauce to enchilada sauce. It will give the meal a completely different flavor than what it is supposed to taste like in this recipe. Definitely one of the few recipes on allrecipes that deserves the 5 stars with NO changes made by reviewers!

This is in our meal rotation because it's so yummy and reasonably easy to make. I substitute 2c salsa for the tomato sauce, and instead of covering them with taco sauce before baking, I use the leftover sauce in the pan. Delicious!

Love this recipe! I followed the reviewers who do enchilada sauce for taco sauce and salsa (my fave: Trader Joes Authentica--smooth salsa is hard to find!) instead of tomato sauce, no green pep. Scoop a little onto a tortilla chip if you're hungry while cooking. Yummy.

Good basic recipe. BUT if your looking for fast and easy,try buying frozen Burritos or Tiquitos, they are mild in flavor, but it cuts down on the cooking time. Also use red enchilada sauce (small can)and large can of tomato sauce. Mix together and pour 1/3 into bottom of pan,prevents burning. Add burritos and cook uncovered 10 min. add the rest of sauce and 2 cups favorite cheese,Tex-Mex , Cheddar or Colby mix. Be sure the sauce covers everything and cook 10-15 min. more, or cheese is melted. If you like the beans add before sauce or heat and serve as a side.

Very good recipe and took about the time suggested. Although the chicken base does end up being a little watery. I drained the mixture pretty well before scooping in the tortilla. The remaining sauce I used as a DELICIOUS soup afterwards. It was really really good!!!!Also I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.

I love this recipe very much and have used it in many different ways :) I would suggest instead of using chicken all the time to change it up, use about 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef or ground turkey, it is really great and my younger sister actually prefers it that way!

This is a delicious recipe.  I usually try to review a recipe "as is," but I did do 2 things different.  I prefer my chicken shredded, so I either boil it or cook it in the Crock Pot overnight, then shred it.  The other difference is that instead of the jarred taco sauce, I made red enchilada sauce from another recipe on this site.  They are delicious.  I may make it with jarred taco sauce in the future if I have less time.  I usually make a double batch and freeze half to have another ready-made meal for a busy night.  Great recipe!

In the interest of saving time and because I had it on hand I used two cans of Kirkland premium chunk chicken breast.  I also substituted red enchilada sauce in place of taco sauce. And although the flavor was good it was too watery so next time I will omit the water. The tortillas stuck to the pan so I will also coat the bottom with sauce or use cooking spray.  It was an easy (I guess because I used canned chicken!) and tasty meal.

These were really tasty, pretty much restaurant style! I could only fit 5 tortillas in my glass pan, so I saved the filling and made the other three the next day.

My Husband loved this recipe. I was not a fan of just because I'm not crazy about Mexican Food like he is. I'll agree with the reviewer that said the recipe itself is very time consuming. It took forever. I always skim the reviews before I make the dish. I noticed the soupy complaint but didn't have the same problem. I think it was because I let me chicken mixture simmer a little. I was also lucky enough to find a left over package of taco sauce in the cabinet. I was able to make the dish just like they do at the restaurants. It's definitely a special occasion/ once in a blue moon recipe though.

This one is definately a keeper.  I used the salsa and enchilada sauce version suggested by another viewer. Everyone at my house really enjoyed them.  Next time I will make an extra batch to freeze.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy! I changed a few things and it was so good, will make again.  I only made half the recipe and made these changes: used 3T tomato sauce, 2T sour cream, 2 chicken breasts, 1 jalepeno (seeds and all), 1/3 of a green pepper chopped, small onion chopped, 1/4 tsp oregano, 1 tsp parsley, 3/4 cup cheddar cheese, 1 garlic clove, 1 dash of chili powder, salt and pepper.  I used canned enchilada sauce over the rolled up tortillas (just enough to cover the tortillas) and then I topped it with more cheese.  The jalepeno was just the right amount of spice, I wish half the recipe made more than 4 enchiladas.  If you like it spicy, this is the way to do it!  Will definitely make this again!!!!

Great recipe as is. Even better the next day heated up. I also used pork culets instead of chicken and they loved it.  I added a can of chopped chilies but that was a bit too hot for the hubby and kids.

This was a very good recipe.  I'm a busy person, so I substituted a big jar of salsa for the onion, green pepper, chili powder, taco sauce, garlic, tomato sauce and water.  It really simplified the recipe and I thought it was still really tasty.  You can control the spiciness by buying mild or hot salsa.

Oh my gosh!  These were great!  Instead of cubing the chicken I boiled the chicken breasts in chicken broth for 15-20 minutes and then shredded it.  I also noticed as others did that this makes about 11-12 enchiladas, which by the way, were completely gone after my husband and one of his buddies tasted the first one on their plate!  Excellent recipe!

I Made these for a group of 10 people. Everyone loved them. I would call them chicken baked burritos though because of the flour tortillias. Of course i used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce because it makes more sense. Very good.

This was very good. I did follow some of the suggestions and used enchilada sauce. I used the 10 min enchilada sauce I found on this site. They turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! Only thing was that I had to use tomato paste vs. tomato sauce. That worked out in my favor I think. I still added the same amount of water and my filling did NOT come out runny at all. It was perfect. My kids loved it, picky son gave it 4.5 stars despite it being loaded with onions. Depending on the onions you use, it adds texture more than taste (which is a.o.k.)!

My room mates loved this but I had to add some hot sauce and extra cheese so they would enjoy it more. They also said that I should have shredded the chicken but I though it was good as chunks.

After reading many reviews, I omitted the water. I used mild salsa instead of taco sauce, but ended up adding an extra 8 oz. can of tomato sauce to help cover it. Delicious!!

First time making & eating I found them a bit runny so next time like other readers I'll use less water,and use enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and because some of my family members don't like green peppers I'll try the green chiles, with these few changes I'm sure this would be at least a 4 star.

I use a simplier recipe.  boil 2 chicken breasts, and shread once cooked.  Using one corn tortilla per enchilada, pan fry the tortilla (just very little) then dip into store bought enchilada sauce to cover.  Place on plate and add shredded chicken, shredded cheese (your preference, I use Colby Jack) and olives.  I then fold like a burrito and add more sauce on top with a little shredded cheese and a dab of sour cream.  Easy and fast.

This recipe was ok. I definitely will not use as much onion next time. My husband really liked it though. I think it needed more spice or something.

The enchiladas were very tasty but the recipe was more time consuming than it said. Maybe it was just me, though. We didn't really like all the onion in it either even though I cut it down to half of what was called for. I will probably try to make this again without so much onion, and maybe let it simmer longer.

I sauted the red onion with some four seranno and one large jalapeno pepper that I had completely deseeded and deveined.  This kept the heat from the peppers way down.  Right before adding rotissery chicken, I added a small can of chopped green chiles which REALLY boosted the flavor!  From there I followed the recipe as written.  Being from Texas I am really picky with my Mexican food and these were fabulous!  Oh, in the end, I used Enchilada Sauce rather than taco.

Made exactly like instructions and they turned out great. I made 4 serving and a little sauce was left over. I place the sauce on top and they were great.

I very much enjoyed these...they tasted great and were pretty easy to make! I will definitely make them again. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I found that they didn't re-heat very well, so I ended up throwing some away when I had intended to be able to have leftovers for meals during the rest of the week. Still, delicious when eaten right away!

This was a great base recipe.  After reading tons of reviews, I left out the tomato sauce and water altogether and substituted green chiles for the green pepper.  This made for a creamy filling, rather than tomato-y.  
Like another reviewer, I made these ahead, minus the enchilada sauce & cheese on top.  Pulled it out of the fridge later, threw the necessities on top, baked for 30 minutes.  It was delicious.  Will be my standard.

Great recipe.  I boiled the chicken breasts in the seasonings and used the water for the recipe.  Instead of cubing the chicken, I shredded it.  I omitted the peppers,taco sauce and used enchilada sauce instead. Served with Spanish Rice, my family loved it.

Did not like this recipe very much.  Too goopy/runny, and little flavor apart from peppers and onions.  The tortillas became soggy when I reheated the leftovers the next day.

This was my first experience with Mexican food, and it turned out great!  I took into account that others said not to use water, then substituted a can of diced tomatoes w/ chiles for the tomato sauce (next time I will use a little more tomato/tomato sauce here), and used a can of red enchilada sauce over the top.  My husband loves hot food, so he was really pleased.  I had to have a dollop of sour cream to eat w/ the chiles, but it was still enjoyable!

Very good, but next time I won't put in the water.  It made it too soupy and harder to roll up shells.

I made this for 2 people and had leftovers for lunch.  I did not use water and halved the tomato sauce.  With this there was no soupy mess and I was able to remove each enchilada without it falling apart.  Instead of taco sauce I used salsa and I also used Monterey Jack cheese and Sharp Cheddar.  I added some refried beans but I thought it took away from the flavor.  This recipe took some time to prepare and with all the ingredients needed it wasn't exactly inexpensive to make.  But it was very tasty and especailly good the next day.

Great recipe.  I, too, used the red enchilada sauce recipe.  I made a few mistakes because was cooking several different main course dishes at once and realized I had no tomato paste or sauce.  Just used a jar of salsa in it's place.  Turned out terrific!

Great recipe!!! I used just a little less chili powder, onion, green pepper and taco sauce, in order to cool it down a bit for my 2 year old and 5 year old, and they loved it! It was wonderful!! I also let the entire mixture simmer for a while to cook off some of the liquid before I filled the tortillas. Perfect!

I gave this recipe three stars because I had to make changes as other suggested.  Once made, though, these enchiladas are fantastic.  I don't add the tomato sauce or the water or the salt.  Instead when the chicken is cooked, I add about 10 oz of salsa.  I use whatever salsa is left over to top the tortillas with the enchilada sauce at the end.  These freeze really well, once rolled.  The whole family loves them!

Recipe as it is, I give four stars-I modified it according to other reviewers and omitted the water, but even with the change the bottom of the enchiladas were soggy. Next time I'll cut down on the tomato. I also added a little more chili powder than the recipe called for, but I'm glad I did; it was just the right level of spicy for me! Overall this is an excellent recipe that just needed a little tweaking. :)

The family loved this.  I boiled the chicken and shred it, and my husband thought it didn't need so much taco sauce.  Otherwise, I would follow the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make this again!

This is the best enchilada recipe I have found! Thank you!! I suggest shredding the chicken rather then using it cubed or sliced. It really makes all the differance.. makes it taste authentic! =) Sometimes I add some corn and black beans to the mix..

This turned out to be pretty soupy.  However, we did try to make it without the chicken...probably not the best recipe for vegetarians.  We used a can of pinto and a can of black beans (both drained) instead.  If you're not using chicken, don't add the water that the recipe calls for!

Great and easy!  I let the chicken filling cool some before filling the tortillas. Also, I used thigh meat instead of breast so it had a much stronger chicken flavor.  Instead of sauce and water in the filling, using canned enchilada sauce works fine and adds a little more flavor, too. Finally, I didn't smother the top with sauce but covered lightly which made it a lot easier to remove from the pan once baked.  This is a very good base recipe which is quick to make.  I make the filling while the kids are at school then put it together 30 minutes before dinner time.

I made these last night.  Turned out good even though I was missing the tomatoe sauce.  The only thing I did different was adding mozzerella cheese into the mixture that went into the tortilla shell.  I will make this again

This has become a family favorite. I recently made 32 servings, divided into several 8x8" pans, and froze them. It makes a great meal on busy nights, and we have already made it through our first 32 servings. I make 2 changes. I don't add the extra water (as advised in other reviews.) Instead of filling and rolling tortillas, I layer pieces of tortilla, filling, and sauce (like lasagna). Taste is the same, but much easier.

Very flavorful and relatively healthy.  I used plain yogurt because I didn't have sour cream.  I like the recipe because it doesn't use canned soup.

This recipe was ok. I wish I would've read the reviews in their entirety before making this dish. Many people gave the recipe 5 stars, but made significant alterations to the recipe. Definitely would recommend cutting the liquid - they were hard to roll because the ingredients were fairly runny. It also didn't have a mexican taste to it. It was pretty good, but I probably won't make it again.

I just don't see what all the rage is about these.  I don't find this recipe to be worthy of 5 stars at all.  Made these as the main dish for a Cinco de Mayo dinner that I prepared for my friend and I. After hearing from another friend who tried/recommended these, and, because of her 5 star rating, I thought we'd be in for a real treat. I read EVERY review here and incorporated some of the suggestions given. Even then, I wasn't impressed. Here's what I did: a) purchased a rotisserie chicken, deboned it and shredded the white meat for the enchiladas, b) omitted the green pepper alltogether (didn't seem right to add it to an enchilada), c) subbed a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies (drained) for the bell pepper, and d) used a can of authentic enchilada sauce in place of the taco sauce called for. Despite the addition of hot green chilies, medium-heat enchilada sauce and all of the chili powder, my enchiladas seemed bland and tasted more like sour cream than anything else.  It could have been that my chili powder lost it's potency (I've had it for a while), but I doubt it.....  It just seems as if there should be more heat given the ingredient list (and the chili powder measurement). These were OK warm out of the oven, but not good re-heated.  Not bad, but definitely not great either.  My friend seemed to like these (hence a 3 star rating), but I think she would agree that I've made better. Sorry, this recipe didn't work for me at all.

I used picante sauce instead of taco sauce but followed the rest of the recipe. Loved it. This recipe will now replace my old recipe for enchiladas.

This was a very good recipe.  I used some flour and some corn tortillas because I couldnt make up my mind about which would taste better.  The flour enchiladas were outstanding but all in all, reminded me of a burrito covered in sauce.  The corn enchiladas were excellent as well and will be my preferred tortilla of choice from here on out, when making these enchiladas!

My mixture was very soupy and I had to spoon out about a cup of it as well as cook some of the water down for about 10 minutes. I also added only half of the onion and used green peppers instead of bell peppers and everyone loved it.

Very good! I too made a few changes: 

Substituted enchilada sauce for taco sauce, and mexican/taco cheese mix instead of just cheddar. I left out the tomato sauce and water. 

Also, I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before browning it. I also sauteed the onion, pepper and garlic with some tomato paste before putting the chicken back in the pan, just to cook them through a bit.

Great recipe. I had to substitute Taco seasoning for chili powder. A little spicy with the use of taco sauce. I thought is was good and would make again. Tasted great as leftovers!

Great Recipe! The best enchiladas my boyfriend and I have ever had (and the first ones I've ever made). I made his with chicken and substituted refried beans and mushrooms in mine (vegetarian). I left out the water, as others had advised.

Just used this recipe and the whole family liked it very much. I also omitted the water and instead of using tomato sauce I used 16 oz of salsa. (8 oz of salsa for the filling; 8 oz of salsa to top) Using the salsa I didn't need the green peppers, but I did chop a quarter of an onion.

4 stars as written.  I used a small (7 oz) can of tomato sauce and no water and the filling turned out fine.  It was a big hit with some homemade enchilada sauce over the top.

Ok my main problem with this is that i didn’t know if "1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce” was for tined tomatoes or what?? i ended up using a spicy tomato sauce for pastas which I think made it a bit sickly....

I also couldn’t find a jar of “taco sauce” so I mixed salsa & taco powder but wasn’t totally enjoying that!!

I also initially thought that 1 was not enough so did 2 per person… big mistake! 1 is definitely enough with some coleslaw & salad etc.

Only thing I do differently is use the sauce from the filling instead of buying taco sauce. Also, a little bit less water but not by much, or let it simmer for a little bit longer to condense it slightly.

Otherwise, a brilliant recipe that is fantastic for having a few people around!

These were delicious and very filling! I eliminated the tomato sauce and water and used an 8oz bottle of taco sauce in the filling. I used mild enchilada sauce for the topping and doubled the cheese. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent Recipe! I took the advice of others and used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, but didn't see that the can said 'hot' the first time I tried it. The second time I made sure to get 'mild' and it was so good.

This is now a family favorite! I never add the water, however, and it's pretty soupy even without it...We also leave out the bell peppers, but that's just a personal preference. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wife and every guest to ever try this recipe LOVE it.  I add a few diced chipotle peppers for some heat as well as replace the oregano and parsley with fresh chopped cilantro for that authentic taste.

This wasn't bad.  I followed other comments and left out the water and used less tomato sauce.  It was very very filling, I could barely finish one.  I may try it out again.

This recipe is so good.  I did change it a little bit at the request of my husband and to suit our tastes...
Boil the chicken in broth & then shred (I do this ahead of time in bulk to save time)...
Diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.
No Chili Powder
Use red and/or orange bell peppers instead of green.
Use canned MILD enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.
AND...  we add frozen corn to the mix, which adds so much to the flavor & makes it healthier...

I'm glad I read the review by Patrick. He stated that many people were having a problem with the recipe making a mixture that was too soupy. I omitted the water and used Enchilada sauce instead of the Taco sauce it calls for. It seemed a good consistency without the water. These were the best Enchiladas I have ever eaten. I couldn't believe I made them. Great Recipe. I highly recommend trying it.

This recipe turned out very well.  I did use corn tortillas because I just couldn't bring myself to use flour tortillas in an enchilada, also I shredded the chicken which is not necessary but makes it easier to eat and to keep together in the baking pan.

This was ok, if you dont categorize it as an enchilada. By no means was this an authentic Mexican dish. My husband who is Mexican, said they were good, but they shouldnt be called enchiladas. They should be called Enchilada burritos! And next time I wont be adding the basil. It threw the taste off a bit.

These were so good. The spiceness was perfect for me and I like pretty spicy food. It was a little too spicy for my kids though. I used left over chicken from a whole chicken so it was very easy to make. I will make this again for sure.

Excellent! The only change i made (and strongly recommend) was to reduce the amount of chicken in half. I really believe that people (particularly Americans)  consume too much meat these days.

I made this for my family about a week ago and everyone loved it! I didn't use any water but the chicken still seemed a little soupy. Next time I will use about 3/4 of the sauce. Other than that, it was perfect. I used homemade enchilada sauce and 4 Mexican Cheese Blend for the topping. This one is definitely a keeper!

This is quite possibly one of my favorite dishes to make; I never get tired of these! You can't go wrong with this recipe. However, I do definitely use more cheese than what's called for, particularly on top. It's also fun to play around with different types of cheese.

I used ground turkey because that is what I had, and this was a fabulous and quick recipe! My husband has been begging me to make enchiladas...and boy was he a happy man tonight. Thanks! Plus, the kids loved it too!

Love this recipe, and so does my husband. I cut the water in half and it gave the perfect consistency in my opinion. Also, I'm not a big fan of onion, so I used half an onion and a whole green pepper. The green pepper is a nice flavor in this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These were great enchiladas. My husband RAVED about them for 2 days! The only changes I made were omitting the bell pepper (family's not a big fan) and used homemade enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce. I think I may have used a little more sour cream than what was called for. These were tasty, and easy!

This was SUPER!! made it for youngest son's highschool graduation party June 2007- served with other All Recipe selections Oaxaca Tacos, Lime Chicken Soft Tacos, and Spanish Rice Bake by Melodie Keaunui-- All I need to say were 5 star -- it was the PERFECT Menu!!! These Enchiladas were wonderful!! Nothing needs to be changed or omitted-- exactly as recipe states and you will have a crowd pleaser!!! Every seasoning and ingredient compliments one another- finally found an enchilada recipe worth keeping!!

YUM YUM YUM! These are great! My first attempt at Enchiladas, and they were great. I made the mixture in two different skillets, as my hubby hates onions and peppers and I can't live without them, and fudged a little on the taco sauce (didn't have any). Wow - soo good. Just a little bit spicy - perfect!

My family enjoyed these. I didn't include the pepper as my one son wouldn't eat them that way. This is hearty burrito. There are plenty for left overs. They freeze and reheat nicely.

This recipe is fantastic. I added canned green chilles and cumin, and was generous with the chili powder. I made these for Cinqo de Mayo, and there were no leftovers!

I tried this with the modified information given by one of the other reviewers. It turned out great! Used both mild enchilada sauce and salsa. Also ...I recommend that if you happened to get a big onion ..cut it in half and just use one half, or you'll bite into more onion than chicken! A great recipe!

I REALLY enjoyed this recipe and I am as authentic as they get. Being of latin background I was a bit weary about mixing in the sour cream but at the end it came out well! Not very hard to throw together and ready in a matter of minutes. I used both corn and flour tortillas... and both tasted good... although I do favor the corn because it gives it more of the authentic taste. Thanks for a good recipe!

I made this the day after Thanksgiving, using turkey to get rid of the leftovers.  There was more than enough to make at least 10 enchiladas, and they were absolutely perfect!  I look forward to making these again.

This is a wonderful recipe. Everyone in my house loves these. I cut the chicken up first and then cooked it, and sauté the vegetables as suggested by other reviewers. I also omit the water. Other than that, I make the recipe as is. I make enough for leftovers and that doesn't stay around at all.  *Update* - instead of cooking the chicken in the frying pan, I've been boiling it in chicken broth. Let it cool a bit, then cut it up into chunks. The chicken tends to shred this way, making for a nice texture to the enchiladas. I sauté the onions, garlic and peppers in butter, add the cooked chicken, then follow the recipe with the remaining ingredients, omitting the water.  Sometimes I add wine to the pan if the sauce needs a little more moisture, which depends on the size of the chicken breasts/parts I'm using.

Awesome enchiladas. I made a few changes to the original recipe though. I used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce and added some diced green chilies. My husband loved it.

I had to change up the recipe some, but it turned out pretty good. I didn't use as much tomato sauce or sour cream. I also didn't cube the chicken I shredded and fried the chicken coated in a little bit of garlic salt and pepper for more flavor. I also added some cayenne pepper for a little kick. I topped it with mozzarella and cheddar cheese. It was a huge rave at work, they keep asking me to bring some in again. Overall a good recipe, even better when you change it up.

The first time I made these they were great and were perfect, the second time I made them they were not as good as the first time. The problem: I bought generic sour cream and it separated when I added it in. So my advice is that by the name brand kinds. The flavor wasn't that different and I actually served it to my guests and everybody said it was good, but I felt kinda OCD about it! I also garnished the layer of cheese on top with fresh parsley. I served it with guacamole and Spanish rice the first time, and guacamole and a salad with balsamic vinegar (you don't need anything to creamy).Also once it is done, you can garnish the enchilada with some red onions, black beans and corn..it looks super pretty! This is a dish that really pleases most palettes, highly recommended!

The sour cream in the mixture really makes the recipe stand out! It is delicious! I made it with corn tortillas and it turned out really well. I also made it with the Red Enchilada Sauce I from this site, but I think I'll either use the taco sauce or canned enchilada sauce next time.

I only made half of the recipe and due to an abundance of jalapano peppers I substituted two jalapanos for the bell pepper and since other reviewers said it was too runny I used the tomato sauce and no water. This turned out great and I will definatly make it again

This recipe is great!!  I sauteed the onions/peppers after the chicken then added the other ingredients.  I will definitely try it next time with the enchilada sauce recipe from this website instead of taco sauce.

I've made this recipe a couple of times before and it has always been excellent.  This time, I made the recipe a couple of weeks ago and froze it (assembled, not baked).  I took it out of the freezer for dinner tonight and baked it at 375 F for about an hour - It was awesome!  Based on several other reviews, I omited the water and used only half of the tomato sauce.  I also used Sara's Enchilada Sauce (found on this site) instead of the taco sauce.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks, Debbie!

This was pretty good.  However, I'm not too sure about the taco sauce on top. While it was good,  we both agreed that salsa would be better.  Even maybe a salsa-taco sauce mix.  Also, I made a half recipe and it only filled 3 tortillas and not very full.  Will make again but with a different topping.  Thanks for the recipe.

The family raved over these but I'll be cutting back on the chili powder next time, and adding some cayenne for a little more zip.  As it was the seasoning was kind of bland.
I omitted the water altogether, and the consistency was great.

It's good, and relatively easy.  Thought it would be a little mild for my taste, so I spiced it up.

By far the best recipe I've ever had for chicken enchiladas.  I cut the tomato sauce in half, as suggested and used the other half in the red enchilada sauce (also from the site) that I then poured on top.  Mine made enough for 2 dishes (one 7x11 pan and 8x8 pan).  A true winner!

Hands down the best chicken enchilada I’ve ever had.  I did listen to other reviews and used the excess filling on top and omitted the taco sauce (seemed like to much liquid for my taste).  The profile picture up isn't very attractive, but these are defiantly worth a shot.  Absolutely wonderful.

These enchiladas had a lot of flavor. I added a little more kick to the filling by adding 1/2 teaspoon of pepper flakes. The filling was a bit runny so I had to fold in the corners of the tortilla to keep the filling in. 

Also, I boiled the chicken to scoop out the fat easier and then I cubed the chicken and tossed them in the skillet. Additionally, I added the garlic, onion, and bell peppers in the skillet before adding the chicken. From there, I followed the rest of the recipe.

This was the most fabulous recipe ever!! the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the taco sauce I bought was way too hot, but thats not this recipes fault. Next time I will try the red sauce on this site others have said its delish. I also cooked the chicken in the crock pot on high for about 3 hours in some chicken broth then shred it. The chicken was so moist. Too make sure the filling is not too runny just leave out the water. Plus I added mushrooms because I had them on hand and they added a little something extra.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't have sour cream so I used about a can cream of chicken soup.  I omitted the water and just mixed the chicken, spices, cream of chix soup, cheese and some of the homemade enchilada sauce from this website.  It was very yummy!

I love this.  My husband actually found this recipe and made it for dinner when I was at work.  He used to red sauce recipe from this site like someone else mentioned and they turned out great.  They freeze very well also.  We usually make a lot of them and are able to freeze about half.  Then all we have to do is thaw and reheat for a great meal.

Fantastic recipe! I made a few changes- I didn't use any sour cream, used corn tortillas instead of flour, tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, and used salsa on top instead of taco sauce. Some other reviewers mentioned the sauce was too soupy, but with the tomato paste, I thought it was just right. I would probably use flour tortillas next time, just because the corn tortillas broke when I tried to roll them.  Will definitely be making this one again!

A+! This is so good that I always overeat. haha For a more authentic flavor, instead of topping this with one jar of taco sauce, I whip up a batch of the recipe on this site titled "Mexican Mole Sauce." I highly recommend it that way. The flavor is incredible!

We made these for a dinner party and they were a hit!  The mixture seemed a bit runny when we were spooning it into the tortillas, but it didn't seem to make a difference once they were done in the oven.

Loved this! Easy to make, used red enchilada sauce per other suggestions.  Little sloppy/soupy rolling into the tortillas but once they got laid out in the casserole dish they held together fine.  Used roast rotisserie chicken from the supermarket to cut down on cooking time...it was awesome. Real tender meat and stuffed well.  Will def. make again!

This was mediocre at best.  I followed the advise of other reviewers and substituted salsa for the tomato sauce and enchilada sauce & rotel for the taco sauce and I was still underwhelmed.  My husband liked it, but he will eat anything. I have much better enchilada recipes to bother making this again.

This recipe is EXCELLANT! I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used flour tortillas, and put some sliced black olives on the top.

Excellent!! My boyfriend's new favourite meal! I followed the suggestions made by other people:
1. Used salsa instead of tomato sauce
2. Omitted water.
3. Didn't have green chilies, but I'll use them mext time!
4. Used more cheese.
5. Made taco sauce recipe from "googling" Taco Bell sauce.
6. Added refried beans to the tortillas before I added the chicken mixture.

This was such a great meal.  I am a novice tortilla - roller, and even the big square packages that were my enchiladas turned out great.

Wow wow wow! How amazing was this?! Honestly, I think it was better than going to a mexican restaurant. I used cheddar along with italian cheese and minimized the amount of chili powder. I used half and it was still a little spicy for my taste. We did have three left over (out of 8) but it was just my husband and I eating them! Needless to say, they were gone the next day.  Will definately make again!

If you don't particularly like onions, only use a few.  I love cheese so I used a lot!  Over all it is GREAT!

These were SOO YUMMY. It was the first time my husband and I have ever had enchiladas, and we'll definately have them again. I made a few changes. I made enchilada sauce from a recipe I found on here, and used that instead of the tomatoe sauce. I topped them with hot salsa instead of the sauce. I like my food a little spicier, so I think next time I'll add some hot peppers or something while I'm cooking the chicken. But still, they were very yummy!

It was pretty good. I would make it again, but change a few things. Add some chilli peppers and spice it up a little bit and bake it a little bit longer maybe 5-10 min. Loved it with a good salat and nachos :)

I too had a problem of it being too watery, even though I didn't add water. Instead, I cooked some rice and used the rice inside. Turned out great!

My husband loves this recipe!  I like to substitute beer for the water and cut the chili powder in half.  I also use uncooked flour tortillas (cook before rolling)and I use green enchilada sauce-sparingly.  They always turn out delicious!

Made adjustments as per previous reviewers and also made it healthier.  Substituted yogurt for sour cream, and omitted cheese on the filling and the water. Added red chili flakes to the filling and used jalapeno monteray jack to top.  Instead of taco sauce used a combination of hot salsa and tomato sauce.  Turned out very nice.  We enjoyed this with a rice and beans recipe from this site.

Easy to make, and it serves so many people! We added about a cup of frozen corn, an extra bell pepper, and a 15-oz. can of black beans. It was delicious AND healthy.

1) Purchased baked chicken breasts (4 pieces) from the deli counter at my grocery store and shredded them.  2) Used salsa INSTEAD of tomato sauce. 3) OMITTED water. 4) Used a 4 oz can of green chilies INSTEAD of green bell pepper. 5) Used 'Red Enchilada Sauce' (a recipe submitted by Sara and found on this site) INSTEAD of jarred taco sauce.  The entire meat mixture can be made up ahead of time, refrigerated overnight and reheated before assembling into the tortillas and baking.  I used parchment to line the pan and they came up without sticking, and cleanup was a snap.

I made the recipe almost exactly as written. Only thing is that I used Kraft Mexican cheese for the inside and to top the enchiladas. Also, I could not find taco sauce at store, so I used extra water/tomato sauce liquid and topped the enchiladas with that. The recipe turned out amazing for a beginner chef and the whole family loved it!!!

These are great!  I only had three small, thin chicken breast, so I halved the recipe, except I used the full amount of cheese.  I subbed pepper jack for half the cheese and used 1/2 taco sauce, 1/2 pureed Rotell for top sauce.  I didnt have enchalada sauce as others have suggested.  The half taco, half rotel was a nice combo.  I served with Mexican Rice II, great meal.

Whew!  My eyes are still watering from this!  They were excellent with quite a kick to them!  I made only a few changes like most others.  Omitted water, used salsa for the tomato sauce, and used enchilada sauce for the taco sauce.  Very good.  Thanks.

Okay, give me Enchiladas and i will be happy! Had to give it a 4 because my husband didn't think it was worthy of our 5 star family box of recipes. Well, and I thought it was pretty soupy when I spooned it into the tortillas. But the end result was oh so good. Paired it with tangy avacado and cucumber salad!Yummy.

Since other reviews stated it was soupy I didn't add any water.  I also only put in 1/4 cup onions.  My husband doesn't like "Mexican" dishes but he surprisingly liked this one.  I like "Mexican" dishes I but didn't like this dish at all.  The kids didn't like it either.  My husband would like it again but it is too much work for just one person to eat.  Especially since I'd have to make another meal for the rest of the family to eat.

These were great! I used corn tortillas and salsa instead of tomato sauce. Also, I had about two cups of filling leftover that I added one cup of chicken broth and one cup of fat free milk to make a wonderful tortilla soup.

This was great.  Based on previous reviews, I added green chilies.  I also added a handful of chopped green pepper.  I used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce and I didn't add water.  I sautéed the onions and chicken first and then shredded the chicken before rolling everything into the tortillas.  It turned out great.  Yummy:)

I modified this recipe  a bit to make it even faster and tastier...  I heated a package of frozen, southwest-seasoned chicken breast strips in the microwave per package instructions.  Then coarsely chop and place in microwave-safe mixing bowl with 1 C  shredded mexican cheese blend and 8 oz sour cream.  Heat for 3 minutes, then stir in 1 (4 oz) can  mild green chiles, 1 (10 oz) can Rotel, 1 (8 oz) can tomato sauce, a dash of chili powder and a dash of garlic powder.  I spooned this mixture into small flour tortillas, rolled them up, placed them in a 9x13 baking dish, and poured a can of enchilada sauce over the top.  Baked at 350 F for 20 minutes and served with spanish rice and refried beans.  Yummy and quick!

These were ok, but not WOW enchiladas.  I love enchiladas, and have tried many recipes, and I would never make these again.  I left out the water, but the filling was still quite runny.  It needs some more kick - didn't really taste like Mexican food.

I found the chicken mixture difficult to work with, as it was quite wet. Might reduce the tomato sauce and water amounts next time. 

The flavours really developed overnight, and the leftovers were even better than the original meal.

I used the advice from others and added green chilis and a taco seasoning packet. I don't know what I did, but WOW it was spicy!!! We could not eat it.

I'm sorry to have to jump on the negative bandwagon but this was not at all a recipe I'll try again.  Even after omitting the water and ½ the sauce, it was still runny.  The flavor was pretty bland as well.  The best part was using the Crisco enchilada sauce on this site!  Even after reading the negative reviews, I couldn't help but think it must be a good recipe as so many people liked it...I'm just not one of them.

These were ok, I made them without reading some of the reviews first. I should have used green chiles instead of green pepper. The sauce was very runny, so the water wasn't needed. These were ok, but I probably would not make them again. My boyfriend liked them better than me. I think if you used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce they would be better.

This recipe is excellent!!  I did not add the water and used a can of green chilis instead of green pepper.  I also substituted enchilada sauce for the taco sauce.  It made 12 enchiladas.  I have even taken it to a party and everyone loved it.

This is one of our favorites. Hubby and daughters (ages 9 and 11) all love it. The only changes I make are to leave out the 1/2 C water and I use red peppers instead of green. It is different from your typical enchiladas you might get in a restaurant due to the spices used, but don't let that keep you from trying it.  Yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Snaps for Debbie! These were the best enchiladas ever. I too boiled and shredded the chicken, omitted the water, and used enchilada sauce. I didn't have a green pepper or dried oregano and they were still amazing. Served it with Mexican rice III (this site also) for a dinner my family has already requested again!!!

These were really good!  The only changes I made was to boil and shred the chicken, and I sauteed the onion and pepper first.  Next time I would probably cut way down on the onion and use green chilis instead of the pepper.  Also, I left out the water, I think the consistency would have been way too runny with it.  Overall, a tasty and easy recipe.  Thanks!

Definatey so good!! I barwly altered it by shredding chicken and using green chiles in place of peppers. But one question, did anyone feel there were alot of onions in this? I truly thought I'd chosen a small onion, but there were as much as the chicken it seemed like! Nonetheless.. YUMMY!

This was my first time making enchiladas and they were so good. Everyone loved them and wanted more. The only problem I had was that the mixture seemed kind of runny so it was hard to roll it in the tortillas. Maybe I did something wrong, but they still turned out REALLY good!!

This was a GREAT recipe!  I cut the time down a great deal by using Schwan's chicken breast meat for fajitas.  It's pre-cooked, pre-spiced, and pre-cut.  Everyone I made this for LOVED this.  I'll use it again and again!

This recipe was delicious!  I added diced tomatoes with chiles instead of water.  I topped the enchiladas with sour cream and lettuce.  My family loved them!  I was worried that there wouldn't be enough for my family, but I could only eat 1/2 of an enchilada.

The flavor was ok and even though I omittted the water, the chicken mixture was way too runny. That might have been my fault though and not the recipes. I used fat free sour cream, which I think added to the runniness. If I make this again I'll either use less sour cream or I'll try using regular. Also I think shredded chicken would make these enchiladas taste even better.

Definitely a five star recipe! I made this for dish for my boyfriend and he was very impressed. He loves his food very spicy though, so I trippled the amount of chili powder. I also added a couple more cloves of minced garlic. 

For side dishes I made long grain white rice and mixed a can of mexican tomatoes and chili peppers. I also served mexican beans. 

I would definitely make this again! 

Thanks for the reciped Debbie!

I have made this 2 times and my family loves it. Take my advise and just follow the recipe as is for a wonderful dinner.  The only change I made was to cut the chili powder in half.  Also, to hold the enchiladas together and look prettier I used toothpicks.  This is a keeper in my recipe box, thanks.

These are the most delicious enchiladas. They even won over my husband and he is a very picky eater.  He could stop talking about them!  These were really really great and sooo easy to make!  My only recommendation would be to cut back on the water some.  I also added some green chilis to give it a little kick.  These were so good!  Thank you for this recipe! Five plus stars for sure!!

I live in California, and I think I am totally spoiled by our huge selection of Mexican foods! These enchiladas were pretty good, but I used corn tortillas, and tweaked certain parts of the recipe  to taste.

I made this over the weekend, the preparation was quick and easy.  The ingredients were ones that I usually use in other recipes.  My family loved it and can't wait for me to make it again.  This leftovers were the most fought over in a long while.

VERY delicious!!  My husband loved them.  I thought I had tomato sauce but we were all out - right in the middle of cooking this recipe - so I had to improvise.  I used a can of tomato soup and half a can of tomato sauce instead.  It still turned out delicious.  We will make again, and this time I'm going to try is the real way.

This was pretty good. I had a jar of Taco sauce on hand so I made this. I halved the recipe and put it in an 8x8 pan. It was really simple to make. Next time I'll use enchilada sauce instead.

I made this for my family and had the recipe yeiling for 12 people so I could save some for later.  There was only one problem, there was not any left.  My husband made the comment, "Wow, I can't remember a dinner going that fast, they loved it".  My family really enjoyed it and I will for sure make it again!

My husband has not stopped raving about this dish.  The changes I made were:
used Diced tomatoes w/ chilis instead
of tomato sauce. I poached the chicken
in chicken broth and I sauted the
onion, garlic & green pepper before
adding other ingrediants.
YUMMY ! Thanks Debbie

I had to change this a bit. I felt the chicken mixture didn't have enough flavour so I added some ground cumin, corriander and chili powder. Also reduced the sour cream to 3 tablespoons which was more than adequate. After these changes it was a very tasty and easy meal.

Glad I tried this.  I did not include the water, and I subbed enchilada sauce for the taco sauce. I also suated the onions first because I didn't want crunchy onions. I also topped with olives and green onions.  Yummy!

This recipe is very tasty. My wife and I really liked it. The sour cream gives it a great flavor. I'd take it easy on the green pepper next time though. Used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.

Wonderful recipe! I found it to have great flavor and it was quick and easy which is always a bonus! I always add a little extra spice by way of hotsauce to give it a bit more kick, but it's wonderful on it's own with out adding anything! Enjoy!

Just a fab recipe...up here in Canada we are not big Mexican food eaters - needed some great recipes for my daughter's birthday party....the only variance that I made in this recipe was to use 1/2 can diced tomatoes and no water instead of the tomato sauce - definitely a keeper !!!

I was really looking forward to serving this to my family, as it sounded very good and had so many good ratings and comments. I was disappointed at the outcome, though. I scaled the recipe to 10 servings, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe it was just the brand of taco sauce that I used, I don't know. Out of a family of 6, no one took seconds, which is rare since I have 4 sons who are either teenagers or in their early 20's! I had a lot of leftovers, so I guess there was no need to scale it to 10 this time!

This was an OK dish, I would have given it 4 stars, but my kids did not really enjoy the chicken mix at all. My solution to the runny filling was to make it the night before, and let it sit in the refrigerator over night, that took care of that problem.  We ended up making just plain cheese enchiladas.

I was not really impressed.  In New Mexico we use Homemade Red Chili sauce that we make when we serve this dish. Nothing but the best for this Native New Mexican. Where did the parsley come from? It's not common in this dish and takes from the true chili flavor.  Leave it for decoration.

I really liked this and so did my husband.. However I made mine a little different and lower fat. I omited sour cream and used only half of the cheese.

I made this recipe last week and was very impressed. They looked and tasted better than restaurant enchiladas. My husband, children & grandkids loved them as well. Definitely a keeper!
Thank You

Quick and easy, just like it said.  This is something you could alter and customize very easily.  Next time I make it, I think I would add green chilies and some salsa.

These were great!!  I didn't add the water as others had said since the mixture already looked "wet" enough.  I also used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

This is by far the best enchilada recipe that I have tried! The only thing I did different was I only used 8 oz's of the tomato sauce, about 1/3 C. of water (could have used less), grated about 1/4 C. of onion (otherwise my kids wouldn't eat it if they saw it), & I had to omit the green pepper (for the same reason). Every one loved it in my family-- even my picky 10 year old gave it a thumbs-up. A very tasty recipe!!! Thanks for sharing.

I omitted the water, and still had a soupy filling, so I added some frozen, cooked turkey to the sauce.  I poached and shredded my chicken then sauted the onions and added the chicken to it.  I also added some frozen chopped anahiem peppers in place of the bell pepper.  Because I am not very fond of taco sauce, I took reviewers suggestions and made Red Enchilada Sauce (which is fantastic). Although these enchiladas were not particularly bad, they were not very good.  I thought they were a rather bland.  My husband loved them, as did the kids; and I will make them again but only for thier sake.

This was my first time making Enchiladas, and it was so good I almost couldn't believe I made it!!  I used already cooked turkey meat instead of chicken (wanted to use some thanksgiving leftovers that were in the freezer) and it was wonderful.  I omited the salt because I also made the Red Enchilada Sauce from this site, and I accidently made it a little  too saltly. This really was a great dinner. I plan to make it many more times in the future.  **Only changes I made was of course the turkey and instead of a whole onion(we aren't big onion people) I used a few shakes of some dried minced onion. I also thought the spices were perfect!  Not bland at all as others have said.

This recipe is great!!! I made a few changes, I use a can of hot  salsa and only half the tomato sauce for the filling, and enchilada sauce on top, not taco sauce. Also eliminated the water.

My boyfriend LOVES mexican food, and this is one of his new favorites!!

Growing up in Texas, I'm picky about my Mexican food.  This recipe seemed easy, so I tried it.  It was easy, but the flavor was overwhelming of tomato.  The only substitutions I made were using an already roasted chicken from the grocery store and adding more garlic.  If you're looking for quick, this one is okay.  Otherwise, try another recipe.

Takes some time to prepare, but making the enchilada sauce from scratch puts packaged sauces to shame.  Served it at a birthday party and people loved it.

This was the first time I have ate or made an enchilada. I think it turned out pretty good. When I was getting ready to add the sourcream, I saw that it had expired. So, instead I used mayo with a little bit of hidden valley ranch dry salad mix. Instead of using tomato sauce I used canned, diced tomatos. I didn't use green pepper because I don't like it. On the top I just added cheese, no taco sauce. I didn't take the time to cook it for the full 20 minutes, but I would suggest it so your filling is hotter.

I used a whole roasted chicken instead of breasts. I cut the tomato sauce down to 10oz. I think 15oz would have been too much. I omitted the green pepper as we don't like it and used 7" flour tortillas. It made 8 enchiladas. I used Trader Joes Hot & Smokey Salsa (our favorite) for the taco sauce. I also cooked the onions in a tablespoon of oil before adding the chicken. I garnished with fresh chopped cilantro.

Great recipe. I used Trader Joe's Hot and Spicy Chipotle picante sauce instead of taco sauce. It gave the recipe a wonderful smokey, rich flavor. Instead of pouring on top, I poured the sauce in the chicken mixture, let it cook down a little and then stuffed the tortillas. I didn't bake until the next day. Also, upped the amount of cheddar cheese. Served with sour cream to cut the heat a bit. It was a great way to use up some leftover Sam's Club roasted chicken. If I didn't use the chipotle salsa, I don't think the recipe would have been as good.

Great recipe.  Instead of the tomato sauce/water/chili powder combination I used 15 oz. of salsa.  I took other reviewers advice for the topping and added the red enchilada sauce from this site.  Instead of chicken breasts I used leftover chicken from a roast that I had cooked a few nights before.  Excellent!

After reading some reviews, I tweaked the recipe to these specs., it turned out sooooo delicious. Here's what I did: Add an extra ounce or two of sour cream. Sub 16 0z. mild Best Choice picante sauce for tomato sauce.
Add one can green chiles. Add one can Rotel, drained. Omitted green bell pepper. Cook onions with initial chicken cooking. Add extra garlic.
Use 1 1/2 cup cheese in "sauce". Use 16 oz. medium Best Choice taco sauce.
Dip flour tortillas in sauce before filling/rolling. Use 1 1/2 cup cheese on top. Omit water. (In my local grocery store [in Northwest Arkansas], the variety of salsas/picantes is slim. I've found that the best tasting out of the major name brands are the "Best Choice" products. -- Who'd a thought??) Delicious!!!!! Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

Well, I don't like flour tortilla enchiladas, they are always to "thick" and heavy.  But this fit the ingredients I had on hand, and the reviews were good.  Hard to tell, with the damping effect the flour tortillas have on the overall flavor.  So there wasn't much flavor, even though I added more red peppers, etc.  Not bad, not great.

These are good but always come out too watery. The second time I made them I did not add the water and it was still thin. The combination of ingredients is good but the recipe needs to be adjusted somehow.

This is a great recipe! I saute the onion and green pepper before adding it to the sauce. This helps so they are not to hard. I also omit the water. Thanks for the recipe Debbie.

These were good, but very very rich.  I didn't like them a lot the first day, but they got better the second - mind you I didn't add the green pepper because I didn't have any.  That might have made a difference in the richness.

Very good, but a little too spicy for DH and me.  After seeing the reviews saying there wasn't enough flavor, I used half tomato sauce and half medium picante sauce (and no water), plus shredded Mexican cheese instead of cheddar... think this combo added a bit too much kick.  Would have loved to use the Red Enchilada Sauce, but didn't have enough time... will definitely try next time I make it.

Excellent recipe, but needed a bit more flavor.  I will add 1 tsp salt next time, and a little more cheese on top.  Also, I will not add the water.  It made the filling too watery.  With these changes it will be a wonderful dish!!!

This is pretty good and quick - it doesn't need the extra water though, it made the filling really watery.  I like Gerry's Enchiladas better, but this takes half the time to do it.

Followed others advice & used diced tomatoes, green chiles and made the sauce from this website instead of "store bought" taco sauce (click on my name for the recipe). I prepared the chix & sauce in advance to cut down on cooking time. I've realized that I prefer corn instead of flour tortillas so I'll use corn next time. This will be used in heavy rotation at my house.  GREAT MEAL!

This recipe was real good on prep and cook time, but it lacks in flavor to me. I had to add my own extra spices and seasonings the second time I made this. I added a can of rotel tomatoes and less tomato sauce and minus the water.

These were really good and easy to make - didn't take long at all, especially if you cook the chicken ahead of time.  The next time I make them I'll probably use a jar of salsa instead of the tomato sauce.  Also, I like things spicy, so I added some crushed red pepper.

These were good, but too much sauce.  I had to dump a lot.  I thought some of the sauce would thicken, but it didn't.

Delicious. We made a few changes: used ground turkey instead of chicken to save time, added one small can of diced green chilis, and used the grated Mexican cheese blend instead of plain cheddar. Next time, I will cook the onion and green pepper with the turkey instead of adding later.

Excellent recipe, even better left over.  Here are a few suggestions ~ Shred your chicken instead of dicing.  My veggies were too crunchy so next time I will add the onion/bell pepper at same time & cook for a minute or two before adding the cheese.  I omitted only the taco sauce and instead made the "Red Enchilada Sauce" on this site (as some previous reviewers suggested)- AWESOME touch to the enchiladas!!!  This enchilada recipe is a mild one, so for some added spice in your filling you may want to add some cayenne or crushed red pepper and maybe top the enchiladas with a jalepeno slices.

Yummy!!! This was fabulous. I too omitted the water and onion(i didn't have one) and used red enchilada sauce, I'm going to try it next time with green sauce too. The chicken mixture I think would be good by itself as a warm dip with crackers

I was told this was the "best thing" I ever made!  I used orange bell pepper instead of green, added some chopped chili peppers, used extra oregano... and used a small can of tomato paste and same amount of water.  Covered with green enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  Fannnnnntastic!  The chili powder is really important, don't skimp.

Good! I recommend shredding the chicken instead of cubing it--that's how it's usually served in enchiladas that I've had, (and being born and raised in Texas, that's alot of enchiladas!=P). If you can make your own sauce instead of the jarred stuff, even better! I used green bell peppers this time, but I think a nice spicier alternative would be chopped jalapenos. Will make again.

Excellent recipe. After reading the other reviews I did the following: season my chicken prior to cooking it, omitted the water and the tomatoe sauce and used enchilada sauce in it's place (10 oz), I also used enchilada sauce to pour on top instead of the taco sauce.  I reduced the amount of chili powder for my 18 month daughter, it had a little kick but was not too spicey. Next time I would leave out the green peppers and possibly add refried or black beans. I used whole wheat tortillas and didnt taste a differnce between whole wheat and flour and the wheat is much healthier. Thanks Debbie!

Wow!! I made this last night and I was really pleased how good it was! I wasn't sure about the tomato version since I have had the non-tomato version before, but I must say that I think that this one is the best! I omitted the green peppers (don't like) and the salt. It was perfect and I will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great!  I left out the onion, green pepper, & tomato sauce, and instead used 1 can rotel and 1 can green chiles.  Used hot enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and put jalapenos on top of the cheese because we like it hot.

Simply excellent!
Didn't add the water either, just the right thickness without it. I also shredded the chicken with a fork after cooking instead of cubing it-makes it easier to roll the tortillas as well.

This was a Very Good Recipe.  My husband loved it.  Although I only put the taco sauce on half, and we liked it much better without the taco sauce.  Just our preference, but next time I will make without that.  Thanks for the great recipe, will for sure make again!

Great recipe. I could never believe I could cook this dish restaurant quality. My boyfriend was amazed. 
The small alterations I made were for the sour cream and the water. Where I live sour cream is not easy to find so I replaced it with a can of plain yogurt. Worked well. 
The water I ommited because I used a can of chopped tomatoes which was watery enough. 
Other than that I stayed true to the recipe and came out a winner!

Very good!  The only thing I omitted was the salt.  Next time I'm going to leave out the water and use canned chicken breast (Hormel makes a wonderful one)- I found cooking and cubing the chicken to be a pain in the neck.  Can't wait to make again!

**Update:  I make these ALL the time now, with my own little touches:  use 1 10 oz can Hormel chicken breast (drained) and mix with the onions, sour cream, etc.  Omit the water- this makes the filling too runny. I use wheat tortillas instead of the regular white ones- better for you and a little thicker so they hold the filling better.  I also use Ortega (mild) taco sauce- the best, in my opinion.  This recipe makes 2 great dinners- I use half the filling and freeze the other half for another meal.  We are HOOKED on these-  thanks so much!!!

Great recipe!  I have made it three times for guests and it was always a hit.  Instead of chopping up boneless chicken breast halves, I boiled chicken on the bone and then deboned it.  That way, I had shredded chicken in the enchildadas instead, which is always better than diced chicken in my opinion.  Plus, then you have broth for soup later.

Yum! I made these for my boyfriend's Mexican themed party, and got rave reviews. I didn't add the water or the tomato sauce, just used extra enchilada sauce, and they still turned out great. Thanks!

Very good recipe, and, like most dishes of this
type, excellent the next day.  My wife loved it,
but I found it just a touch on the tomato-ey 
side.  I may try to cut the tomato sauce a little
bit next time.

I do not normally like Mexican food, but my husband does so when I saw this recipe I figured I would try it.  We both loved it.  I have already passed it on to some friends.  Great Recipe.  I followed the recipe exact except I left out the water.  The sauce already had the perfect consistancy.

This was yummy!  I added 1 small can of tomato sauce and it was just perfect and didn't use any water.  As previously suggested I sauteed the onions and bell peppers and also used 1/2 tsp cumin as well as enchiladas sauce instead of taco sauce.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe.  It was quick and easy to make.  I made it for my son's birthday party and people really loved it. My nephew told me that he needed to take the couple that were left home. I really enjoyed the flavor as well.

I made these enchiladas last week, and my husband who doesn't care for mexican food loved them! I did use a 4oz can of green chiles in place of the bell pepper, and a 8oz can of tomato sauce. I did use a 1/4 cup of water and used the red enchilada sauce. Great recipe and will use it again tomorrow when we have company.

Fab recipe, especially when you take into account the suggestions from other reviews. (no need for the water, and too use enchiladas sauce rather than taco sauce)

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. I made it for 16 people. Going by others reviews, I used less oregano, but added some ground cumin. I left out the water and found that all the tomato sauce made the mixture too runny, so I cut back. I also substituted enchilda sauce. Fantastic. Yum, Yum.

These were great!  Not a true "Mexican" dish, but excellent.  My boyfriend absolutely loved them.  I didnt change a thing in the recipe, though I have to admit, the 15oz. of tomato sauce scared me :P.  The only thing I would consider changing is perhaps to saute the onions and bell peppers before adding them to the mix, as I dont like my veggies cruchy.  This will definately be a permanent recipe in my household.

My family loves this meal.  I cut back on the chili powder because I don't like spicy foods.  My husband can spice his up just by adding hot sauce to his.

I thought these were OK, but I don't think I will make them again. They seemed a little too "herby" for my taste. The oregeno overpowered the taste of the creamy chicken mixture.

This recipe was outstanding.  Not only did my family absolutely love it, I had plenty left over to take to work for lunch and suddenly had three other lunch mates chowing down my enchiladas.  Very tasty recipe and not too spicy for those of us that can't take it.

I make these a lot, they are the best enchiladas I have ever had! However, there are two changes that you have to make for these: omit the 1/2 cup water, it is not needed and will make them too soupy. Also, use enchilada sauce NOT taco sauce. You will love them if you love spicy food!

This was so delicious!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I don't cook much and was amazed how good it was.  The only thing I may have messed up is that the sauce was really liquidy and I thought it would be less runny but I could be wrong.......I don't think I have ever eaten enchiladas before.

This was a big hit, even for my ever-picky stepdaughters!  Some changes I made:  They aren't chicken lovers, so I used 1 1/2 lb. ground beef instead. I also omitted the green peppers (for my husband's sake), and I had to simmer for quite a while to reduce it.  I wasn't crazy about the taco sauce on it - too tangy and not the best complement to the flavor of the filling.  I'm going to experiment with some of the other suggestions here and see if I can't perfect it.  But aside from that, this was simply outstanding!!!

The enchiladas were great! However I made a couple changes. I left out the water as mentioned before, plus i boiled off a lot of the water from the tomato sauce too until the sauce was a lot thicker. Also, I doubled the chili powder to make it a bit spicier and used enchilada sauce. Other than that, they were great! Definitely will make again.

AWESOME Recipe!!!  I used leftover chicken and made my own tortillas in the "Tortillas I" recipe on here.  I left out the bell pepper and parsley- I added in a touch of cumin... I used canned chopped tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and left out the water because I didn't think it needed any.  Instead of using taco sauce on top, I mixed a little salsa with some more of the chopped tomatoes... I used a Mexican blend of shredded cheeses instead of just cheddar-- everything was wonderful!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  YUMMMM!

Wonderful. Made it for a Sunday with football and it was more anticipated than the game and we were rewarded well. This is a great tasting recipe and very easy to assemble. The only thing I did different was to cook my chicken in salsa and then shredded it to put into the tortilla shells. Highly recommended!!

My parents came to dinner and I thought I would try something a little different. My husband LOVED this recipe and my mother who is not a big fan of mexican food said it was WONDERFUL. If you find a recipe that can please everyone at dinner then is a definite keeper.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe!  Thanks Debbie! I did however leave the water out the next time I made it b/c it was too "soupy".  It turned out great!

This recipe was really good next time I will omit the water. I used corn tortillas and had chicken mixture leftover My husband liked it better as a dip

The filling was awesome but next time will use enchilade sauce (homemade) as I felt the taco sauce didn't do the filling justice.  I did the recipe for 4 servings.  I used 8" corn tortillas (perfect size).  I microwaved them for 30 secs and they rolled easily, no problem.  I boiled and shredded the chicken (3 breasts - made enough to fill 10 tortillas!).  Used FF cheddar cheese and LF sour cream which was good.  Also used a 10 oz can of Rotel instead of the tomato sauce and eliminated the water.  Next time will try adding a little tomato paste as well as it was a tiny bit dry.  Spice level was perfect (I like spicy food, but it was not too hot).

I made my own enchilada sauce (2 cups) and substituted it for the water, tomato sauce, chili powder, garlic, and taco sauce. I halved the recipe and it still fed 4 very well - I was very impressed.

Was a great, fast & easy recipe to make in a short amount of time.  I did tweak it like most others and there were a few things I will change next time.  Instead of bell peppers I used black olives and I added just 1/4 cup of water (although next time I will just omit it all together).  I will also go a little easy on the chili powder next time.  A little less tomato sauce would help to make it a little less runny as well.  It was great and my husband said he doesn't want me to change a thing!

I've made this twice now and both times I had to tweak it.  Both times deserved more like two stars but, I gave it three due to the fact I did tweak it.  I used corn tortillas and used less sour cream.  I didn't use oregano because it seems odd in mexican food.  I used fresh cilantro instead of Parsley.  I used my own Enchilada Sauce.  But over all the taste was just ok.  Nothing special.  I will go back to using my usual Enchilada

I made this for my husband and he said it was filling, moderately spicy, and overall, very, very good. I used no water for the sauce. I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and he said that the meal could have used another half jar of sauce. I would also recommend boiling or baking the chicken instead of frying it.

My guests liked this dish; however, the filling was rather runny and for the amount of fat in it, it should be ten times better.

Yummy!  I did change a bit.  I doubled the garlic and added another ck breast.  I did not have sour cream, instead I use half a tub of onion and chive cream cheese and substituted tomato sauce with paste and added water to thin out.  I don't like bell pepper, so I added a raw jalapeno (removed seeds) and added cumin.  Instead of flour tortillas, I used corn tortillas softened in a little hot oil so that they would not crumble.  Tastes even better the next day.  Used pace enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.

This was delish! I didn't put in green peppers and used just a little dried onion instead of real. To "shred" my chicken I used my Pampered Chef food chopper and that worked slick! I also probably added extra tomato & taco sauce and a little more cheese (we live in Wisconsin, it's all about the cheese). I used a Mexican cheese mix from Sargento. It all turned out delicious and pretty easy to make, I'm sure it will become one of our staple meals! Next time I think I'll add one more chicken breast to "beef" up the meat. I can't wait for my leftovers at lunch today!

Wonderful recipe!  Cooked it for my family and it was a BIG hit!  I followed other's suggestions though and only used an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce, put in enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and completely left out the water.  I will definetely cook this again!

These are so good!  Everyone loves them, and guests are always impressed that I know how to make enchiladas from scratch.  Mexican dinner night used to be tacos or fajitas from a box, but these are infinitely better!  The filling freezes well too....just pop leftovers into the freezer, and the next time you need a quick dinner, defrost, throw it in a tortilla, cover with sauce and cheese, bake, and people will think it took you all day!

I cooked the onions, peppers and garlic after cooking the chicken in tbsp. butter and tbsp. oil. Added the chili powder, herbs, no water, substituted salsa instead of tomato sauce mixed the rest.  Used only 3 chicken breasts as well.  My family loved this. I will not put taco sauce on top, we don't care for that, salsa will be replaced next time.  This will make this a five star no doubt.

The taste was wonderful.  I usually take time to read reviews before making a recipe, but was in a hurry this evening and didn't - that was a mistake.  Next time I will definitely leave the water out.  Rather than chicken breasts, I used leftover meat from the roast chicken we had the other day and it tasted just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I'm an exchange student in Belgium, and I wanted to have my family taste some mexican cuisine. I made these enchiladas and they were an absolute hit! I found all of the ingredients needed easily except for the taco sauce, so I just made my own enchilada sauce from another allrecipes recipe. I recommened this recipe highly!

This recipe took a little more work than I expected, but it was worth it.  I used Sara's enchilada sauce (from this site) as recommended by other reviewers.  I also reduced the tomato sauce, omitted the water and used a cheddar jack mix.  I also omitted the green pepper and used canned green chili peppers instead.  It was a bit hot for me and I will probably tone it down next time, but my husband loved it and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

They had a really great taste, but I had entirely too much liquid. Will make again, but will definitely cut back on the liquid additions. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made a few alterations.  I seasoned and baked the chicken breasts for 1 hour at 325 F, then shredded them the next day.  I sauted the onion, green pepper and the garlic, added the spices, then added the shredded chicken to heat it through.  I put all that in a bowl, added the other ingredients and wrapped them in CREPES!  I borrowed my friends crepe maker and have been playing around with it, so I thought why not?  They were delicious!

I agree with the ratings - these are great.  Not completely stand-out but really good standard fare.  I omitted the water and added a can of chopped green chilis as well.  I think it's missing something to make it really pop - but these are fabulous and I will make again.  Makes a ton of food - be prepared to scale down if necessary.

Wonderful flavor.  I did follow other reviews and omitted the water and decreased the tomato sauce to 8oz (was still a little too saucy... as my BF commented... but still good).  I also used Sara's Enchilada Sauce and I added some Mexican green salsa to this one... One more change was to use a jack/cheddar mix as opposed to cheddar alone. This is definitely a keeper!

This was great!  I omitted the water and used canned red enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce, however next time I'll try the the Red Enchilada Sause by Sara.

Fabulous!!!  My husband doesn't particularly care for mexican food, but he loved this recipe.  Even my 2 year old ate it all up.  I also omitted the water and reduced the tomato sauce to 8 oz.  I also substituted enchilada sauce for the taco sauce.  This recipe will become a regular in our house from now on.

We Love these!!  I use hot chili powder and add green chilis to the mix to spice it up a bit. We have also found that using tortillas a size smaller allows us to have more control over our serving sizes (especially since we eat them for days!)  Drained black beans are a great addition too.

Hubby gave this 5 stars - he ate it like he had never seen food before with this funny grateful look on his face :-)

My variation was to omit the water and tomato sauce and substitute 3 small tomatoes chopped. We also like spicy, so I added a packet of taco seasoning. YUM!!

Delicious!  I made a few modifications out of necessity (fat-free sourcream and low fat cheddar, can of Campbell's tomato soup instead of tomato sauce, salsa instead of taco or enchilada sauce) and also added yellow and red peppers because I had them on hand.  I didn't add the water.  I found the filling a little runny while hot, so I let it cool a bit before rolling into the tortillas.  My husband and I loved it and will definitely add this to the regular supper rotation.  Thank you Debbie for the delicious recipe!

Good recipe.  A little too saucy - should have followed the advice of some other reviewers and omitted the water.  Will definitely make again.

Yummmm!!  These get better and better everytime I make them!!   The only thing I do differently is make the Red Enchilada Sauce that is somewhere on the site to pour over them instead of the jar of taco sauce.  It makes it a little more time consuming, but it is SO worth it!!!

Very good recipe!  I had enough sauce to pour over the top of the enchiladas instead of using the taco sauce.  I think I might try this recipe with beef too!

Absolutely delicious! I didn't make any modifications to this recipe at all, although next time I may omit the water as other users have suggested. I haven't had enchiladas in years, and these were just wonderful. The taco sauce gave them a unique, almost sweet taste. I love trying new Mexican recipes, and this one is a definite keeper! Thanks.

PRETTY GOOD!  I THINK NEXT TIME I WILL USE CORN TORTILLAS.....COOK THEM IN OIL FOR A LITTLE BIT BEFORE FILLING THEM.  THE FLOUR TORTILLAS TURNED OUT A LITTLE DOUGHY, I FELT LIKE I WAS EATING A BURRITO NOT AN ENCHILADA, ALTHOUGH VERY TASTY.

mmmmmmmmmmmm.....soo good!!! I didn't find these runny at all...maybe because I too omitted the water and only used an 8 oz jar of tomato sauce. I added green chiles and they came out wonderful. My mother said they were too spicy with the chiles added, but that was just the way that I liked them! Definitely a keeper.

This was great.  I did half w/ corn tortillas and half w/ flour tortillas.  The corn tortillas was definitely better.  The flour tortillas did seem to be more soggy.  I omitted the water and used two 4 oz cans of tomato sauce.

Excellent dish!  Didn't use the salt, and not as much water, perhaps could have done fine without it.  Also didn't have parsley, so I used 1/2tbsp of sage.  Tasted great!

oh so good. They are even fantastic leftover for lunch (if there are any leftover)! I shredded my chicken and also did not add water as recommended by others. I used a can of enchilada sauce instead
of taco sauce. A new favorite!

I decided to reduce the reccommend the water and I didn't use all of the onions this called for.  I was extremely happy with the way it turned out - mainly because the leftovers were excellent.

This recipe is awesome!  I followed the advice of others- dropped the water, used fat free sour cream, low fat cheese.  Delicious!!

Wow! These were great.  I used D's Famous Salsa recipe from this site instead of taco sauce and it they were wonderful.  I made half the recipe for my family of 3 and we had extra for lunch the next day.  I also had some extra filling, which was so yummy that I decided to serve it with chips.  This is definately a recipe that I will make for company, very nice presentation.

Yummy!!  I left out the onion and green pepper because I don't like them and instead added some diced jalepenos.  Spicy and tasty!!  I only had tomatoe paste so I just watered it down and it worked out just fine.  I got rave reviews from my family!!  Would make this one again!

It was okay. There was just too much sauce in the chicken mixture that it obliterated the flavors and textures of the cheese and vegetables. It probably would be better over noodles as a stroganoff instead of in enchiladas. I won't be making it again.

Thanks for sharing this recipe Debbie.  I made a slight change when I added some fresh cilantro and jalapeno to the chicken mixture.  Very good overall.  I served it with canned refried beans and mexican rice, also from this website. Terrific meal!

Terrific recipe!!  I tweaked it a little by dicing the chicken breast before sauteeing them. I also sauteed the onion and pepper with the chicken.  The flavors blended well together.  I also omitted the water and used half the tomato paste.

This was very easy to make, although I shredded the chicken and used corn tortillas lightly cooked in oil making it easier to roll them.  It wasn't spicy enough for my husband, so next time I'll add a little fire to it.

This recipe is really quick and easy, and so good that I like to snack on little pieces of tortilla dipped in the mixture as I'm rolling the enchiladas. This is a favorite with my family.

My sister is so picky about food, but when I made this dish. She loved it! She asks me to make it all the time. The only warning I have about his recipe is to watch how much enchilada sauce you use, I prefer to to completely drown my enchiladas in enchilada sauce... but that's just me!

These were very easy to make. I omitted the water as others suggested, and I shredded the chicken with a fork...also I added mushrooms.  Also, I added the chicken after cooking the rest for a while...turned out perfect, the family loved them

Very, very good. I didn't mix the sour cream in - I just added that as a side. Also, instead of green peppers I added chopped jalapenos. Oh, and I used a jar of enchilada sauce in place of the taco sauce!

This was awesome!  Like everyone else, I omitted the water, used a whole 3lb chicken boiled and pulled, and cheated using Pace Enchilada Sauce instead of taco sauce.  Also added sliced olives to the meat mixture and used a mexican blend cheese.  Ended up with 11 enchiladas, enough to freeze for future enjoyment.  5 Stars!!!!

This recipe is good and easy.  Next time I will boil the chicken breasts instead of sautéing to reduce the fat and calories.  I will also finely dice the bell peppers.  i do not like green peppers much, but they are needed.  I used bottled taco sauce as suggested but found wal-mart brand was very spicy. Next time I will use the enchilada sauce recipe.

I love enchiladas and this was a great recipe. Just enough sauce and I used hot salsa for that extra kick. The first time I used corn tortillas, big mistake! They cooked up rubbery in the oven. But the flour ones worked great the second time. No leftovers here! :)

Very tasty. A little soupy. I'd leave out the water next time. A little spicy for kids. I'd also leave out the green pepper if you're not a big fan of it, the taste of it is very overwhelming.

We used precooked chicken strips which cut the time on making these along with no water, yet we weren't real impressed.  I think I'll stick to the other chicken enchilada reciped I found on this site, as they are much tastier.

I really enjoyed these.  I had never prepared enchiladas from scratch before.  I didn't realize how easy it was.  I will make these over and over again.  So easy, a great lunch item too.  The only thing is...I like my enchiladas saucy.  I would make more sauce next time.

Made these but unfortunately did not read the reviews first.  Do not add the 1/2 cup water.  That makes the whole thing too runny and made it hard to roll the enchiladas without everything pouring out.    I suggest using smaller than 10" tortillas.  I couldn't fit 8 in a 9"x13" pan because they wouldn't fit sideways.  I think an 8" tortilla would be perfect.  I made the Enchilada Sauce also found on this website instead of taco sauce and that turned out good but made the entire thing too much for me.  I probably won't make these again, but only because it was too much effort.

I used some leftover turkey instead of chicken and added a few jalapenos.  The results were terrific!  It was a fantastic way to use up the turkey. Everyone in the family enjoyed the leftovers for once.

This recipe has great flavor! awesome!  We didn't use any water and cooked the peppers with the filling for awhile, as others suggested. Also we used a food chopper (Pampered Chef) to chop the chicken into small pieces. And we used Enchilada Sauce on the top. 

Next time I'm going to use some thicker tortillas, and try cooking them in 2 separate pans, so they aren't all smooshed in there.  Also possibly using some real tomatoes and monteray jack in the sauce or on top.  

But super yummy! Highly Recommended!

I cooked this tonight and it was great. I looked at the reviews before making and I ommitted the water and used an Enchilada sauce  for the topping in stead of the taco sauce,it turned out fantastic. I have three very picky eaters in my house and this was a hit. Very kid friendly. I give it 5 stars all the way around

I added a chopped jalapeno pepper & used roasted red pepper tortillas.  I ended up with delicious, restaurant-quality enchiladas!  These are relatively easy-- the only hard part is getting all the enchiladas to fit in the pan-- and reheat well.

I made this for my Super Bowl dinner party.  Everyone loved them.  Even good leftover the next day.  I did add one large fresh tomatoe, along with 1/2 jar of Mexican style tomatoes, used extra garlic, a small can of green chilis, and did not use any water.  I also boiled my chicken with onions and celery flakes instead of in the frying pan as the receipe suggests.  I used 1/2 enchilada sauce and 1/2 taco sauce for top and I used extra cheese inside and on the top.  They turned out great!! I suggest making them with the fat free refried beans because they are also great!!

I really wasn't too impressed with this the first time I made it (it seemed to watery) but once it cooked it set up beautifully.  It has become one of my family favorites.  I omitted the taco sauce and used enchillada sauce, one time canned and one time home made, and added just a touch of cayenne.  Very tasty!

This was great, but I had to cook it a little longer. If you like them really crispy then don't add so much enchilada sauce, but otherwise I found this to be really good. I would definitely make it again, AND it was easy.

This was our first try at enchiladas, and even though it was kind of difficult (we don't cook much), they came out wonderfully.  Definitely reduce the amount of water, and we doubled the amount of cheese and used that mexican blend cheese you can buy already packaged.  Wonderful!

I didn't have any chicken so I used ground beef. I omitted the water and in the future I would try it with enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. The filling was awesome. Overall, it was a great recipe.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  As suggested by other reviewers, I excluded the water and added some cumin.  The cumin really gives it the 'mexican' flavor.  Also, if you decide to add hot sauce for a 'kick', be carefull which kind you use.  I used some sauce we picked up in Jamaica and it totally changed the flavor:(.

I really don't get the other reviewers who did not like this recipe.  I used ground turkey, sauteed the veggies as suggested by others, left out the water, and cooked on medium high for a good 15 minutes.  Nice and thick.  Flavored the turkey nicely.  Thanks a bunch!!

Took a little long to make but ended up being quite good.  Since this was my first try at Enchiladas..I think it went smoothly.  I should have actually read some of the reviews first..

I tried this after reading the reviews and can't believe some people didn't LOVE it! My boyfriend said I can definitely make these again! I did, however, not use water and it was great!

My whole family loves it when I make this for them. My wife asks me to make it at least once a month.   -  Wayne

Very good.  Like someone else that reviewed this recipe, I cut the amount of water in half.  I think next time I'll leave it out all together.  I sauteed the onions, peppers, etc before adding them to the chicken.  I also had a some fresh parsley and cilantro left over from another recipe that I added.  It was really good!

To make these even faster, while you're making the sauce, bbq/grill the chicken and then mix the chopped hot chicken with the sauce and cheese, fill warmed tortillas and spoon a little sauce over each serving and top with cheese. I omited the baking, it just takes too long when everyone is hungry. To make the recipe lower in fat I omitted the butter and used 1/2 fat soup and lowfat sourcream.

I adapted this recipe by adding fresh cilantro and cumin.  It needed to be boiled down longer than indicated, but was worth it.  The leftover sauce can be used for Jalapeno Rellenos, by adding jalapenos, slightly cooked, served with tortillas.  Great recipe!

My family enjoys mexican food a lot.  We get tired of just making tacos.  This was a great change.  I thought the mixture was going to be too runny but after it cooked it was perfect.  I had a hard time rolling the mixture in the big tortillas and fitting them in the 9x13.  I think next time I'll use smaller ones. This was a winner in my household.

Everyone loved this recipe! A definite "keeper"! When I first made the chicken mixture, I thought I did something wrong and it was too thin... but it turned out DELICIOUS!

Doesnt take too much time to make, and even my very picky family loved them.  We ate them all week long, not bad when re-heated in micro the next day!

They were tasty but in the future I would cook the veggies with the chicken to soften them up. They were still crunchy after baking them.
