this recipe is tasty, but the person who reviewed it and changed not only the ingredients but cooking method shouldn't comment on this recipe, it's not going to turn out correctly if you don't follow the recipe!!!

Yummy!  My kids beg me to make these.  The only thing I do different is I use a small scoop to make donut holes only.  It's quick and easy with less mess.  I have used flavored applesauce too.  Raspberry and cinnamon are great.  We've also dipped them in glaze.  Thank your mom for the great recipe.  I can guarantee this will be passed down in our family.

Very tasty. I used allspice instead of clove, since that's what I had on hand. By the way, I agree with the poster who said it's unfair to dramatically change the recipe and then give a poor/mediocre rating. The raw apple that poster added would completely change the texture of this recipe and would also change cooking time.

Good... but not too apple-y. Anything fried and sugary is good, right? 4 cups isn't enough flour to take this from a batter to a dough. I made with 4.5 -5 and they were still tender and light. Tasted great, but could go for more apple flavor... as well as more cinnamon and nutmeg. I think next time I'll try replacing half the buttermilk with applesauce instead... or maybe a little apple juice concentrate instead of some of the sugar.

These were great.  I added frozen orange juice concentrate as I had no orange.  They were terrific!

Yummy! Fast and easy. I didnt have buttermilk. So I subd with plain yogurt. Was still great! Cant wait to try again with original ingredients. Make sure oil isnt too hot!  Burnt first few. I made donut rings, with a glass and the center with a small shot glass! Cute!

Don't know if I did something wrong but I didn't like this.  Interior was moist but outside was tough. Did add 1/2 grated apple and drop by spoonfuls into the oil.  Sorry this recipe didn't do it.

Great, tasty, easy to make doughnuts! I made them into munchkins, because the batter was a little wet (Im sure I screwed something up along the way, while chatting on the phone). It reminded me of a cruller doughnut with a light appley taste. I would make this again .

Very tasty and irresistible!! These were a bit time consuming but well worth it. The dough needed more than 4 cups of flour to achieve the correct texture. Personally, I liked how the doughnut holes tasted better than the doughnuts.  The outside has a crispy sweet crust while the middle was soft. We coated the doughnuts in a cinnamon and sugar mixture.  Regardless both are delicious! A must make again! Will be freezing a bunch and I hope they taste just as good afterwards.

My husband and children enjoyed these doughnuts! Much better than the cheater doughnuts we usually do (using refrigerated, premade biscuits)! They are addictive, but I was looking for more of an apple flavor, given the name. I followed the recipe, but should have added more flour or let the dough refrigerate before trying to roll out and cut them. Definitely a keeper, with a few minor adjustments! Thank you!
