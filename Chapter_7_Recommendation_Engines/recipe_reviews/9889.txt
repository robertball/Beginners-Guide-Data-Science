These are great bars!  I've tried several recipes for these bars and here's what I've learned (some after many failed attempts):

1.  Don't buy graham cracker crumbs.  Use regular graham crackers and crush them yourself.

2.  If you have trouble with the butter not soaking through the cracker crumbs, combine them in a small bowl first and then pat them into the pan evenly.  

3.  The order of ingredients makes a difference in taste.  This recipe puts the coconut on last which makes a great toasted coconut top.

This is a delicious combination of ingredients! However, if you follow the directions provided with the Seven Layer Magic Cookie Bars recipe submitted by Eagle Brands, they come out much prettier and easier to cut and eat. It's the same exact ingredients -- just a different method.

I thought this recipe was good and tastes just as sweet as any other recipe. I had some technical difficulties  following step one (melt butter, coat pan, sprinkle in crumbs). This method didn't make the crust solidify so when I cut the bars, most of the crumbs were left in the pan. The second time, I combined the butter and crumbs in a seperate bowl, then pressed it into the pan. Much better. Also, I find that it is really hard to cut these out of the pan because the condensed milk sticks to the pan after baking. You have to chisel them out! The second time, I layered the pan in foil but now, the foil is stuck to the bars. Just keep this in mind. Alterations: I used chocolate/caramel swirled chips and substituted pecans for walnuts. Good!!

These are one of my favorite cookies. I made my own crumbs as suggested and mixed them in a separate bowl, pressed into a pan sprayed with Pam. As far as putting the Sweetened condensed milk  on the top or the bottom, I decided to warm the can slightly in hot water to make it  more liquid, then I poured half on the crumb crust and the other half over the top, this seemed to do the trick to adhere the crust together and coat the coconut as well. I let them cool for about 30 minutes, then cut them with a pizza cutter, but did not remove them from the pan until the next day this gave them enough time to set up properly and they were easy to remove and maintained their shape.

I read many of the reviews and used parchment paper - perfect solution to the reports of stickiness. The entire thing lifts out of the pan and comes right off the paper when fully cooled. An exceptional variation follows:
Substitute chocolate boxed cake instead of graham crumbs, increasing butter to 1 1/2 sticks of butter. Mix thoroughly and press on bottom of pan. I used 1 cup peanut butter chips, 1 cup milk chocolate chips, 1/2 cup semi-sweet chips and sprinkled over the crust. I omitted nuts altogether; mixed the milk with the coconut, poured it over the layers of chips; THEN topped with a handful of semi-sweet chips on top for a really nice presentation.
Very impressive and absolutely delicious - finger licken' good!

I made this for a holiday party at work recently, and it was a huge hit!  It is definitely for the sweets lover, but the combination of the butterscotch with the coconut and semi-sweet chocolate really gives them a great flavor.  Be careful if you put the bars in the fridge to cool, they can become very hard a difficult to cut.  I would advise cooking them the night before and sitting them out to cool instead.  Also, don't go wild with the semi-sweet chips, they can overpower the good taste of the other ingredients.  Finally, I used regular butter instead of unsalted, and they still tasted great.

I make these all the time - many variations - but I always add the milk last like other reviewers.  I found a new variation to try recently - use a box of devil's food cake mix blended with 1 1/2 cups softened butter to make a crumbly dough & use that in place of the graham crackers....YUM!  And I think it holds together better that cracker crumbs.

Rich and gooey -a real treat!  I lined the inside of my glass baking dish with aluminum foil and sprayed it - that way I could remove the entire thing after baking and cooling for easier cutting.

Good, but the sweetened condensed milk is better if it's poured over the melted butter-graham cracker layers.  I suggest cutting it into very small squares, as it is quite sweet. But this is always a hit.

A favorite that everyone loves.  Be sure to experiment with different kinds of chips and nuts.  Make sure you pour the milk over the coconut  so it will not burn, not the other way around as stated in the recipe.

LOVE these bars. I prefer my graham cracker crust to be crisp, so I mix the crumbs with the butter in a bowl, then press into the 9x13 (foil lined) I then pre-bake the crust at 375 degrees for 8 minutes. Then I put all the toppings on and then return to oven at 350 degrees for the 25 minutes. I know that other versions of this recipe say to put the condensed milk directly on the crust. If you want a crisp crust, then dont do that, or it will turn out soggy. Definitely pour it on over the layers (before the coconut). I also used 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs to the 1/2 c. butter, I like a thicker crust and it turned out awesome. I lined the 9x13 with greased foil that draped over the edges of the pan, that way I could easily pull the bars out to cut and serve. This recipe is A+. SOOOO good.

Tip: one cellophane package of graham crackers equals 1 1/2 Cups.  I mixed the butter and crackers and pressed in the bottom of the pan, don't recommend melting your butter in the pan because then the pan gets to hot to press down the crust.  I then put down half the milk then the chips and nuts, pressed that down a bit, added the rest of the milk then topped with the coconut and pressed that down a bit too.  I didn't have any problem with burning and my bars held together wonderfully.  I think I prefer just the semi-sweet chips though and no butterscotch (even though I LOVE that combo in other things!)

This is a very easy recipe.  Based on other reviews I read, I modified it slightly.  I used 3/4 c. unsalted butter and 2 c. graham cracker crumbs, mixed them in a bowl then pressed them into my baking dish I had sprayed with Pam.  Then I added the coconut (so it doesn't dry out or burn), walnuts, chips and then poured the condensed milk over everything.  They came out great!  Made 2 batches, one with chocolate and butterscotch chips and one with chocolate and peanut butter chips.  Yum!!

Very good, but almost too rich! One could easily eat the whole batch because they're so good. Still, the crust can be crumbly. I prefer baking it alone for a short time like I would for a cheesecake to help it set then add the rest of the ingredients and bake the whole thing.

These are wonderful and a huge hit at the SuperBowl Party I took them too.  This is what I did based on previous reviews: I lined a 13x9 pan with parchment paper.  I then sprayed the parchment paper with the flour/butter baking spray.  I melted the butter and mixed it with crushed up graham crackers and spread that into the bottom.  Then I layered all of the remaining ingrediants per the recipe.  After the bars finished baking, I let it come to room temperature, and then covered it with plastic wrap so they could sit overnight.  The next day they lifted easily out of the pan and didn't stick at all to the parchment paper.  I used a big pizza cutter to cut them.  They came out absolutely perfect.

These are quite possibly the best bars ever!  They never last long at my house-as a matter of fact my 6 year old son just asked the other day if I would make the bars with the sweetened condensed milk!  My suggestion for the crust-just add more crumbs.  I never measure mine, I just melt the butter and add crumbs until the butter is soaked up.  You'll get a much firmer crust this way.  I never measure the other ingredients either-just sprinkle on however much we like of each thing.

This is the first time that I have made this type of seven layer bars with the butterscotch chips. Interesting flavor, but a bit on the sweet side for me.

I warmed the sweetened condensed milk and put half on the crumb crust and half over the top of the bars.  Perfect!  The crust didn't crumbled away nearly as much as when I've done it without.  Also, don't bother without parchment paper!!!  It's your best friend.  They turn out beautifully and so much easier to cut when you just lift them out of the pan and cut them.  These taste delicious.

Incredibly rich. Be ready if you do not have an insane sweet tooth!  What I liked about this recipe is that the coconut is on top of everything.  It made a great toasted coconut topping instead of mush.  I suggest combining the butter and graham cracker crumbs in another bowl before pressing into the 13x9.  I used normal crumbs however graham crackers may work as well (cinnamon graham crackers might be delicious in this recipe!)  It was an overall crowd-pleaser.  Try to substitute other nuts like pecans in, or try peanut butter chips.  Butterscotch chips are a MUST.  Note** I highly suggest lining the pan with parchment paper. The bars slide right out!

excellent! this dessert is so simple! want to make it even more easier? i used the pre-made graham cracker pie crusts! i just split the recipe between 2 pie crusts (eliminating the graham cracker crumbs and butter of course). i also went with most of the other members and poured the milk over the top. Turned out great!

Glorious! This is my first time making Coconut Seven Layer Bars after being inspired by the amazing Ben and Jerry's flavor. The ingredients were almost right, but I ended up having to use almost 3 times as much coconut. I read the reviews and suggestions and came to the conclusion there was a better way to make this. I mixed the melted butter in with the graham crackers and buttered the pan generously before packing the mixture into the bottom of the pan. I also just eyeballed how many chips and nuts I needed. I really think the mixing the coconut with the sweeten condensed milk was the key, though it made it difficult to spead over the loose chips and nuts. I ended up using two cans of sweetened condensed milk as well as far more coconut. Next time I think I will just use one and just mix more coconut in it. The 1 1/2 cups of coconut didn't cut it. They are coming out of the pan perfectly due to the butter and also, I seperate the edges from the pan as soon as it came out of the oven. Marvelous though! Everyone adores them and I will definately be making this again!

Ohhhhh man these were good! My family and co-workers absolutely loved them! I used pecans instead of walnuts. The only thing that I would do differently is probably add a little more butter to the crust mixture so that it's not so crumbly. Other then that AMAZING!

Great cookie bars, Patty! I sub'd cappucino chips for the butterscotch. Try adding a bit of cinnamon to the milk. It enhances the chocolate/coffee flavored chips.

I have just one alteration. My grandma makes these bars for just about every special occasion. They are gone within seconds. I have had other peoples & hers are SO much better. When I asked what her secret is she told me to put the sweetened condensed milk in between every layer. It makes a HUGE difference. One of my favorite desserts.

These came out awesome! Everyone liked them, from little kids to adults. Cut them into small bars, they're very sweet. I followed advice from a previous review by mixing the melted butter with the crumbs and then patted them into the pan- it worked out nicely. HIGHLY recommend this recipe, I passed it along to my friends.

This recipe is a little sweet for me but everyone I serve it to absolutely loves it.  My favorite way to serve it is warm out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  So delicious and easy too!

Very good...I've been making these for years.  Has anyone tried mini marshmallows in these?  And a chocolate drizzle on the top?

Very, very important to use a name brand Coconut the less expensive brands are too dried out.
I prefer to use twice as many semi sweet chocolate chips then butterscotch. It gives it a better chocolate taste.
 The butterscotch should compliment this recipe not over power it. It is a great summertime go to recipe.

I would have given this 5 stars but for the directions.  Put the butter in your pan and put the pan in the oven while it's heating to melt.  Pour the graham cracker crumbs into the pan, but mix the butter and crumbs together and pat down, or use a small roller.  I use one 12 oz bag of chips, then the coconut, then the nuts.  I pour the condensed milk over it all.  My husbands favorite combination is butterscotch chips and slivered almonds.  It's always a hit when I take them to work.

Yummm!  I used low fat margarine, low fat graham crackers, chocolate chips, white chips, fat-free sweetened condensed milk and the walnuts and coconut.  Absolutely perfect ratio of the chocolate to the graham to the coconut.  I'm in love again with this old recipe that I used to make back in the 70's!!

I thought these were delightfully rich, with a nice crunch from the walnuts and the coconut. I made a batch long side my daughter and showed her step by step how to make this recipe. I had a blast when she finally was able to look at the recipe and know what each measurement was and was able to get it right all on her own. This was totally easy and a great recipe to help with kids who are beginning to get into helping in the kitchen. Simple steps with simple ingredients and a quick recipe that doesn't lose the focus on the child that is working with you. I recommend this recipe totally. And don't forget to grab a tall glass of milk to go with one of these gooey treats.

these are awesome!  I have made them on a few occasions and everyone loves them.  I used a lot of feedback from other people like melting the butter & combining the crumbs together first...and when using a 13X9 pan I usually double that portion to completely cover the pan well.  And then drizzling the condensed milk on almost every layer. To get a more crispy top I add a little more coconut after the condensed milk.

I was nervous when they came out, b/c it was super mushy, and the condensed milk was still liquidy and bubbling a little bit  on the edges - even after I left it in the oven for another 5 mins.  BUT, after it sat out and cooled for a couple of hours in the pan, it solidified really well.  The next day, it was even better.  Delicious!!!!!

One of my family's favorite desserts. These are easy to make and fun to share. I lower the oven temp to 325 and bake alittle slower to make certain the coconut doesn't burn. This also helps the chips to melt more thoroughly.

Wonderful flavor, very rich that's the only good thing. Followed exactly and mine did not set up. The edges were dry and crumbly and the middle was gooey. Maybe it needed some flour or egg or something to bind it together? Had to be eaten with a spoon. The graham crumbs/butter never formed a crust, the bars were only a spoonable texture and the coconut didn't adhere and fell off the "bars" when cut. The coconut needs to be beneath the condensed milk layer. Couldn't get these out of the pan and they were just spoonable goop and crumbs.
UPDATE: Day two: these are now set up and firm and finally I was able to cut into bars. Now you can pick them up by hand! Very dry crust though, and they were tastier yesterday when they were really gooey and not set. I can't imagine what was wrong b/c I let them cool for 4 hours first.

This recipe is not new to my family, but I had forgotten all about it until now.  It has been about 10 years since I have had these.  Being a health conscious mom now, I cut the butter in half and only used half of the sweetened condensed milk.  The only other alterations we make is the order in which things are layered.  It works best if you add the graham cracker layer, the chips, the nuts, the coconut THEN the milk.  It seeps through the layers and acts as a cohesive medium, allowing you to half the butter.. which is a good thing. :)

Even if it is very rich, this is one of our favorite bar recipes, and so easy to make.  I did make one change, more for my benefit than anything. I just use one cup of crumbs, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and coconut.  This makes a nice balance of flavors, plus I can remember the recipe better.  Also, I found that if I put the condensed milk over the coconut the bars come out with a more chewy texture.  For easier cutting, let the pan come to almost room temp and then spray your knife with cooking spray before cutting. Also, this is so rich to begin with that you can't tell if it is butter or not so I use margarine.

Delicious.  Tasted seven layer bar for the first time this past holiday season at my in-laws and thought I'd try making them myself.  
This turned out different than the one I had tasted -- chewier and less gooey.  I like this one better because of it.
I needed and therefore added more coconut to cover the 9x13 dish.
P.S. My husband said to rate this 4 stars because he prefers his sisters!

This recipe was SO easy.  I threw it together in 15 minutes before a Mom's Club luncheon.  I got RAVE reviews on it.  I made it again for our family Christmas celebration.  My mom couldn't stop eating them (I couldn't either!).  They were so good, I made them 3 times in 2 weeks for various functions.  I have been asked by SEVERAL people for the recipe.  KUDOS to the creator!

Our family didn't enjoy. I always bake several new recipes to take a variety of baked goods to functions and had 2 different events I had to take these to. At both places, it was the item that stayed on the plate while others vanished.

This was a tasty treat. The only problem I had was the coconut. A lot of it flaked off when I did as directed and put it on the top. I heard from fellow bakers that the best way to do these is to put the milk over the coconut.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the butter on the bottom. I definitely recommend using parchment paper to line the baking dish!

very good.  very sweet.  of course you would already expect that with seven layer bars.  i took the advise and mixed my cracker crumbs with the butter and pressed into a well greased glass pan, and put half the condensed milk on the crumb base, and the other half on the top before topping with coconut.

Whats not to like!  I coated parchment paper with baker's spray, and used 2 cups of crumbs instead of 1 1/2 c. and an extra tbsp of butter (for a little thicker crust).  I added 2 tbsp of milk to the sweetened canned milk and warmed it in the micro briefly to make easier to pour.  I find that you need to press down firmly on the top to avoid crumbling.  Cool before cutting, great!

These were great and I don't even like coconut! The only thing I changed was adding more butter to the crust so that it wouldn't fall apart. I think softened butter might work better than melted butter for this step. They also seemed to cook faster than the directions say. But the bars are amazing tasting and are now my favorite sweet treat!

Yummy!  Even my mother who doesn't like sweets loved it!  The only thing I would change next time is less coconut (1 cup) and more walnuts (2 cups)

These turned our really good.  The only change I made was to add the butter to the graham cracker crumbs and press into the bottom of the pan to form a crust instead of drizzling the butter over the dry crumbs.

Very sweet but good.  You should really set in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before trying to cut.

I made these last night and substituted milk chocolate chips for semisweet chips. I also used half sliced almonds and half walnuts for one cup of nuts total. And I added one cup of milk chocolate toffee bits. YUM! They are super rich and sweet.

Big hit in my homemade Christmas basket. After letting it set for a while, my crust was nice & firm.  I baked ahead of time & put in the freezer.

Many reviewers mentioned that it was too rich or sweet. I solved that by using dark chocolate in place of semisweet. It perfected this fabulous recipe.
I love this recipe. I used margarine as directed. Added graham cracker crumbs and mixed them with the margarine then patted it down. This was difficult because the pan was piping hot. Next time I will melt the butter in the microwave and then mix with crumbs and push evenly in bottom of 9x13.

LOVE this recipe! My mother used to make these cookies every single holiday season. I agree that it's best to use regular graham crackers and crush them yourself. I also agree it's best to mix the graham crackers with the melted butter first, then add it to the bottom of the pan. I used a 13x9 pan and it was almost too little. Maybe next time I'll use 2 packages of graham crackers instead of 1 and 1/2. I love the condensed milk but a whole can is way too much. I think you can get away with 3/4 a can or even 1/2 a can, depending on sweet you like it. But no matter what you do, these cookies are RICH! You can't eat too many at once but they are addicting. They also go nicely over some vanilla ice cream if you crush them up. Will definitely make again!!

These bars are what I would call evil! Made them over the holidays and we all fought over who would get to eat the last one. Very easy to make and well worth the little amount of time it took to assemble. Will make these again.

These are addicting.  I've made them several times with the only change being that I use pecans instead of walnuts.  They are great! I haven't really had a problem with them sticking but I always use my stoneware bar pan and it is well seasoned so that might make the difference. If I was using a metal/glass pan I would probably use parchment paper on the bottom.  Give them a try, they're simple, fast and super tasty (just be sure to let them cool well).  Thanks for sharing Patty.

Holy indulgence! So rich, be sure to cut these yummy treats nice and small and pair with a glass of milk. I used a pre-made graham cracker pie crust to save time and fuss and it turned out extraordinarily well. I was even able to use a pizza cutter to slice my pieces.

Always a holiday favorite.  I use a 9x13 glass dish, reduce heat to 325 and refridgerate BEFORE cutting.  No need to butter the dish first, just adding the melted butter is enough.  I also add the condensed milk last and it turns out wonderful every time.  Yum, Yum.

I love these!! My favorite bar cookies ever. My mom taught me how to make these and i use the storebought graham crumbs and mix it in a bowl with the butter, melted. i then press it into the pan. i then put the chips on then coconut and then nuts then condensed milk but the cocnut doesnt toast but the nuts do wich makes them very nutty and good. So good!

My family and friends all love this recipe.  My husband calls these bars "Coconut Heaven." These are just the ticket when you want a quick and easy decadent treat. I followed the recipe just like it's listed.  I like how the coconut gets all toasty and tan on top.

I've made this recipe about 10 times and it is definitely a favorite. Always a hit! Sometimes I drizzle a bit of the sweetened condensed milk over the coconut to make it caramelize.

Only found one can of condensed milk in the house so I added three beaten eggs into the milk before pouring onto the mix.  It came out fine.  The texture is, of course, different.  However, this is what happens when you don't check to make sure that all ingredients are on hand.

These are great!  We have made them twice already and will make them again very soon.  I can't believe how easy they are to make.  The only changes I made were using fat free condensed milk and adding more coconut.  I have made them with regular and fat free and cannot taste a difference so I will now only make them with fat free.

These are good but I've found that they're a little less messy when the condensed milk is poured over the graham cracker crust instead of over the nuts.

I remember my mom making these when I was young, and I have been looking for the recipie for these very sweet, kid friendly cookies.  I used toffee chips rather than the butterscotch, which gave them a richer flavor, and I also used only half a can of the condensed sweetened milk.  This gave the cookies enough richness without being overly sweet.  Thanks for the recipie!

Loved this recipe, but I used pecans instead of the walnuts, they were very, very good and they freeze well too.

I found this recipe to be way too rich and lacking in overall composition - too much coconut and way too chunky.  I will be switching recipes.

I have made this exact recipe many times and given the recipe out as well. I am giving only 3 stars because the first step is crucial.. Crush your own graham crackers, mix with melted butter and press into pan pushing up on the sides a little. I use parchment paper for the pan.  It makes everything so much easier. Try it! For my own personal taste, I put the condensed on last because I don't care for overly toasted coconut. But they still toast a little, however everything just stays together so much better.

These are amazingly good. Only down side is that they are just a little too sweet.

This is one of my family's all time favorites, with the exception of two small changes:  I use 1 cup of pecan pieces rather than walnuts, and like many others, I pour the sweetened condensed milk over the first six layers.  This is one recipe which is really difficult to ruin, and the bars are usually the first dessert to go at any gathering.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's always a hit. I did tweak it slightly by cutting the butterscotch chips to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips. I guess that makes mine 8 layers but I don't count the butter. It really makes it even better which is hard to believe! Tips: make sure you spread the graham crackers evenly or the bars will fall apart when removing them. I use my fingers to spread them. I also use slightly more graham crackers to create an even layer. After removing from the oven, run a small knife around the sides of the pan before the pan completely cools. It will make it a little easier to get the bars out. Enjoy!

These are delicious and always a crowd pleaser!  I no longer buy sweetened condensed milk, but rather, make my own, so that was the only ingredient change I made.  Oh, and I used cinnamon grahams!  However, I followed the directions off the Eagle Sweetened Condensed Milk website for this recipe which have you mix the butter & crumbs, then pour the sweetened condensed milk over, and sprinkle with your nuts, chips, & coconut.  I had no issues with this layering technique and would do it again this way.

I've been eating/making these bars all of my life, they are a standard food in the upper midwest (I'm from Wisconsin).  This is the standard recipe that my family has been making for probably 40 years.  If it's easier you can also melt the butter in the microwave and mix the crumbs in and then spread them in the pan. It's faster but it creates extra dishes.  They are also really great if you substitute the toppings.  For example substitute peanut butter chips for the butterscotch to make chocolate peanut butter bars, or andes mint chips in the winter to make mint chocolate coconut bars.  It's a very customizable recipe.

These were great! They were a little crumbly though.  I did make them on parchment paper as suggested and they came out of the pan just fine.

I followed the recipe. The coconut was browned & crispy. To much for me, but my wife loved it. Great flavor. I used Pam to coat the cake pan & it came out of the pan fine. Cut it with a pizza cutter. I will use this recipe again with some modifications. I would mix some of the condensed milk with the coconut so it wouldn't be so dry. I cooked it at 325 for 25 minutes and that was a good time.

I love making these but I used regular condensed milk - the sweetened makes them too sweet! - definitely a flavor sensation but wow, they're ugly!!!! I made them for a football party and didn't want to bring them out because they weren't very prresentable so I kept them at home and made snickerdoodles instead (at least that was the excuse I told myself, lol)

YUM! What a decadent little bar! Although similar to Denise's easy layer bars, these have one key advantage over hers. I find Denise's bars a tad sweet for my liking. Her recipe calls for more chips and coconut, all of which contribute to the bar's overall sweetness. The ratio of ingredients is spot on here. NOTE: As Tricia Jaeger did, I also spread half of my condensed milk over my graham layer, topped that with chips / nuts and gently pressed everything down. I then topped this layer with the remaining milk and coconut and gently pressed that down too. Finally, I mixed my cracker crumbs and butter together (in a separate bowl) and pressed this mixture into my baking pan. Perfect! Despite these being nearly perfect as is, I do have a couple of observations to share. Be warned - these bars are SUPER rich and VERY, VERY sweet. A little goes a long way!!! I cut a tiny corner piece (smaller than a square) to sample and it left my teeth tingling. :) Additionally, I strongly suggest that you allow your bars to cool (preferably in the fridge) for at LEAST a half hour. My "test" piece was a bit gooey so I heeded to my own advice and the rest of my bars cut perfectly and held their shape nicely. You can store these at room temperature, but just be sure these firm up before you do. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Patty! These are mighty tasty and almost too easy (shhh!!!) to prepare! :-)

These are so rich and decadent. I just melted the butter in the microwave in a bowl and mixed in the graham cracker crumbs (which I crushed in a ziplock bag using a can of beans) then pressed it down on the bottom of the baking dish. Next time, I would try baking just the crust for about 5 minutes before adding the rest of the toppings, because the crust came out a little soggy and not as solid as I would like. I didn't have butterscotch chips so I used 1 1/2 cups choc chips. I also didn't have walnuts (although I'm sure it would have been wonderful with them) I had to use sliced almonds, and used about 3/4 cup. Mine were done in about 22 minutes.

Oh lord, these are to DIE for. DO NOT MAKE if you are on any kind of diet. I have some nut haters in my family, so we eliminated that layer, but this is still probably my favorite dessert ever. Easy, tasty, and awesome. 
Also, we line the pan with tin foil and spray it for easy removal and cutting of the bars.

I altered it a bit, based on the ingredients I had.  I used Toppers Crackers (from Town House) and mixed the crackers and butter together then spread them on the pan.  Then I took the chips and walnuts and combined them, then spread them on the cracker butter crust.  Then I poured half the can of sweet condensed milk, then sprinkled the coconut and then poured the remaining sweet condensed milk.  BRILLANT!

No clue what went wrong but these did NOT turn out for me! followed the directions for the crust exactly and there was WAY too much butter and not enough crumbs. I added 3 more Graham crackers and that seemed to help. They turned out really soggy too... Cooked them for the 25 minutes at the right temp and everything. Had to put them back in the oven once I realized they were inedible but that didn't help either, they are ruined.

I agree with the statements that the order of layers helps with the flavor of these bars.  I also agreed with the comment that the condensed milk should go on the graham layer...  I did and they're amazing!!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are very easy to make and taste good.  I think next time I make these (and I will because they were so easy) I will figure out some way to cut back on the sweetness.   If only there were some semi-sweet butterscotch chips.  I may try cutting back on the butterscotch chips and increasing the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  That might just work!

I've made this recipe many times before, althought I use chocolate graham crackers for the crust...some delicious additions for the sweet-toothed are Chopped pretzels, crushed toffee (heath bars) and obviously peanut butter chips.

These bars were great! My husband is allergic to nuts, so i substituted caramel bits instead. The caramel went great with the coconut.

Delicious!
  Here is a nice variation for the crumb base.  Be sure to spray the bottom of the pan and use parchment paper for easy removal.
  Use 50 crush saltine crackers, mix 1/2 c lt brown sugar with your hands, and add 3/4 cup melted butter.  Bake this first in the oven for 8 minutes, then add in the rest of the ingredients.  It's soooo good.

These are very good with some small changes. I mixed the graham cracker crumbs and the butter together, instead of melting the butter in the pan and adding the graham crackers on top...much easier. I used a muffin pan and lined each cup with parchment paper (I cut circular shapes out of the parchment - big enough to completely line each cup - and used a small bottomed juice glass to press the paper into each muffin cup). The paper does not sit in there perfectly until you get all the ingredients into them, but it worked well in the end. I layered the graham cracker/butter mixture then the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, walnuts, coconut and put about a tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk on top. I baked them for about 18-20 minutes, until the tops were nicely browned. After baking, I lifted each "parchment package"out of the muffin pan and allowed them to cool completely on a cooling rack. Once cooled, I slowly and carefully pulled the parchment off of each. It was a lot easier because the bars were individual and I did not have to bother with cutting and worrying about them sticking to the pan. I have heard of these bars for years now, but this was my first attempt at making them myself. Great recipe!

I did something different.  I crushed choc graham crackers to 1 3/4 cups.  Then I used 1 cup milk choc chips, 1 1/2 mixed choc and mint chips.  I did not use butterscotch chips.

I agree with the review about the problem with the crust technique.  The butter definitely needs to be mixed into the graham crumbs.  We've also substituted different cookies like nilla wafers as well as cereal crumbs.  I also like to use almonds.  The Eagle Brand recipe is no fail, they have tons of recipes on their website if you're interested in more bar recipes.

This was really good! I followed some of the reviews and had no problems.  I put the cracker crumbs in the butter first, sprayed the pan with Pam and then pressed into the pan.  I also sprinkled some of the milk on top of the crust before starting the layers and then poured the remaining milk on top of the coconut. The bars came out perfectly, without mess, and were a big hit!

I grew up with this recipe but always put the condensed milk on top of everything.  I lost mine so I used this one.  I agree with other reviews that the condensed milk needs to be added to the graham cracker mix and again on top.  I also added chopped almonds.  Next time, I'll pre mix the crackers with butter, also add more butter, and put more milk in the middle of the layers as well as on top.  I like the toasted coconut, but I think the milk needs to go on top.  I might add a little coconut after the milk just to give it the toasted look and taste.  My sister and I used to freeze this bars to take on trips.  They're so good....yum.

I would make this exact recipe when I worked at the Bakery department at University of Buffalo. I prefer toasted coconut, I don't like the chewiness of coconut, but the crisp melt in your mouth after it is toasted. YUM

What's not to love?  Here are the changes that I made though:  I use regular butter (not unsalted) and actually mix the crumbs together with the butter in the bottom of the pan.  And then I use pecans instead of walnuts and, of course, put the milk on last over everything.  They are so rich and yummy!!  You really can use any kind of chips or nuts or whatever you have on hand... almost all combinations turn out great!

Try this over the grill to use up the residual heat after you're done barbecuing!  If you want to try it, the most important tip is to use a cast-iron pan or enameled cast iron pan; anything with thinner metal would probably burn too quickly.  I used an enameled cast-iron 8x8 pan and halved the recipe.  I mixed butter and graham cracker crumbs first, then layered everything else.  I placed it uncovered on the grill for 20 minutes over winding-down coals.  The pan was off to the side and not directly over the coals, so it didn't burn.  But I did turn the pan around halfway through because I noticed the edge closest to the center was getting toasty.  Delicious!

How great is it that this recipe only requires a pan and measuring cups?  I didn't have any problems with the crust falling apart.  I did use leftover crust mix from a cheesecake kit I had, which might have special powers or chemicals (I don't want to know!) :)  Actually, I halved the recipe and it fit into an 8x8 dish fine.  I was worried about the coconut burning so I added it after the rest baked for 10 minutes and it came out  picture-perfect toasty.  Only do that part if you don't mind it falling off a bit, though...

It was good. Make sure you don't use a smaller pan though or it ends up being to thick and doesn't set properly. I also used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch since I didn't have any.

SO SIMPLE & DELICIOUS!  I have made this recipe many times and never have any complaints (even when I sometimes mess up the bottom layer and have crumbly bars!)  I pour the condensed milk over the coconut and it turns out perfect every time!  Very simple to change type of chips, nuts, etc.  Wonderful recipe!

These bars are divine!  The best part about them is that they are so quick and easy to make.  The first time I made them, I got numerous recipe requests.  I followed the advice of others and poured the condensed milk over the coconut.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly.  I will definitely make these bars again, and again!  They are so delicious!

I love this recipe!  It is rich, but oh-so worth it.  My family puts the milk on after the coconut, and I did it that way.  That way, the coconut doesn't burn.  Don't cut the butter - it's what holds it all together.  I'd also not use unsalted - I think the extra seasoning only adds to the recipe.  The last time I made these, I used half butterscotch and half peanut butter chips, and it was great.  These go fast, so beware!

I used dark chocolate chips, butterscotch chips and white chocolate.  The white chocolate chips melted (didn't retain their form).  I also didn't have graham crackers where i live, so i crushed up similar crackers combined with pretzels as well.  Very good!

I've always loved these and disagree with cutting the butter. If you want to be healthy, it's better to avoid these altogether.  They are far too delicious and rich for an everyday treat.

These are really good and really easy to make. I just found them a bit too sweet and rich, but if that's what you like, then they're perfect!

I don't have a mortar and pestle, so I put the graham cracker crumbs in the bottom of a stainless steel bowl and used the bottom of the condensed milk can to crush the graham crackers.  Using a little circular motion got finely chopped crumbs.  Worked great!

Awesome!!! My boyfriend is allergic to cow's milk, so I made the sweetened condensed milk from 1 can evaporated goat's milk + 2 cups sugar, cooking it for about 15 minutes to condense. Made the bars even richer.

Awesome. My boyfriend doesn't like coconut (do any men like coconut?) or nuts so I omitted those, and they still tasted awesome. He took them into a meeting at work and they were a hit. Thanks a lot!

This recipe is very easy to make but I made a few changes.  I melted the butter in the microwave and then mixed the graham crumbs into it.  Then I lightly pressed the mixture into the bottom of the pan.  I followed the recipe and put the coconut on top of the  condensed milk and I ended up with a flakey mess of coconut when it was baked and cooled so next time I will put the condensed milk  on the very top so that everything is melted toghether and it is not as messy to eat.

Other than using 2c graham cracker crumbs and using only 1c shredded coconut - I didn't change a thing.  These are too sickeningly sweet for me but I took them to a recent family function and EVERYONE else loved them! I guess I'm just the oddball. But - even though I don't like them  - they were very easy to make!

These bars are delicious.  A couple things: (1)double the graham cracker crust. It could use a lot more. (2) even though there is butter, add Pam. (3) it ended up very crumbly. Other than that, everything was awesome and yummy about it.

I have made this recipe for many years. My sons love it. In the early years I always had most of the crumbs left in the pan when cutting. I then discovered non-stick aluminum foil. This is the most necessary ingredient. Line your pan and bake. When cool using the foil lift out and you can cut into squares with no damage to the pan and the crumbs stick together perfectly. These bars are so delicious and are so pretty on a cookie plate.

You really can't screw these up.  Oddly enough, my favorite batch has been the one where I used all low-fat ingredients.

Update: Looks like you can screw them up.  I made these lining the pan with tinfoil.  DO NOT DO THIS. It sticks to the bars and makes taking them out of the pan difficult and messy.  Use cooking spray and nothing more.  Still delicious.

We make these at Christmas time . . .love it.  I use pecans instead of walnuts.  Sometimes I leave out the butterscotch (for those that don't like it).  We have always called it "Hello Dolly Bars" - love it really rich dessert!

I used one 14.4 oz box of Graham crackers with 2 cubes of melted butter and baked it on a parchment lined large cookie sheet. This makes the crust a bit thicker and produces more bars. I've often thought there was too much condensed milk if the standard sized 9x13 pan is used, and found there was plenty to cover a larger surface (also reduces the sugar intake).  End result tastes the same or perhaps better as it's not too sickly sweet! I live in England and the Brits love this recipe!

Crazy sounding review maybe -- I don't like these bars -- but I make them for others who really love them.  If you do not like sweet cookies then stay away from these.  Like other reviewers I melt butter and mix with crumbs before pressing in to pan.  

Oldie but goodie recipe.

Good heavens!  I can NOT believe how good these are.  I mean, they are really, really, REALLY good!  These are a must try!  I halved this recipe only because I had half a can of sweetened condensed milk I needed to use up (which is what prompted the search that lead me to this heavenly recipe in the first place).  I ended up adding pecans instead of walnuts because I accidentally grabbed them out of the freezer and was halfway through chopping them before I realized my mistake.  Finally, I had some homemade marshmallows, and I figured one more layer wouldn't hurt, so I put them on top of the coconut.  This baked in about 15 minutes, since I had halved it and baked in a smaller pan.  I noticed that some reviewers had problems with these setting up.  I have not given them a chance to set up yet, as I have eaten two bars since it came out of the oven 5 minutes ago.  I will try sticking them in the fridge to see if they firm up, but honestly, I could care less if they do.  So insanely yummy, warm and gooey from straight from the oven (and actually, they held up pretty well, so I am sure letting them cool will make them into perfect bars.)  Thanks for sharing the recipe Mrs. Tindall.  These are going in my goody baskets this holiday season, if they don't all go in my face first!!!  ***UPDATE***  I did put these in the fridge, and they did set up into lovely bars, AND they are even better cold!  Amazing!!!

This is the standard recipe. I'm not a fan of butterscotch, walnuts OR coconut, so I used peanuts/slivered almonds, peanut butter chips, pretzels, mini-marshmallows and a combination of milk chocolate chips and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Delish!

There was a time one could find a kit in the baking aisle to make Seven Layer Bars. With such a simple recipe, no kit is needed!  A very forgiving recipe when it comes to the chips. Use any 2 cup combination of chocolate chips, vanilla chips, butterscotch chips, even toffee bits.   Parchment paper goes a long way, as does the suggestion to pour the condensed milk on top of it all. I layered all of the ingredients except 1/3 cup of the coconut, which I sprinkled on top of it all, giving the top a beautiful toasted look.   Another vote for allowing it to cool before cutting.   Sweet and rich, albeit a consistent hit. Very quick and easy.

This is my favorite version of these bars.Since the coconut goes on last, it browns nicely. I have had other versions that were too gooey.

Oh my Lord, DELICIOUS!!!  And the recipe couldn't be any easier.  I followed it to the letter and couldn't have been more please with the results.  Buttery, gooey, chewy, and wonderful.  I toyed with the idea of leaving out the nuts, as I'm not a huge fan, but I really think they were necessary to cut the sweetness of the bars.  Fantastic!

I crushed my own graham crackers and premixed with the melted butter as other reviews suggested.  For the layers, I changed it up a bit and everyone at work LOVED them.  My layers were semisweet chocolate chips, mini marshmallows, toffee bits, pretzels peices, shredded coconut, and the condensed milk.  I had nut allergic eaters, so left out the nuts.  The toffee and pretzel pieces really did the trick for me I think.  Definitely serve these chilled.

A long time family favorite!!!  This is a very rich, very sweet, yummy, gooey dessert.  I use white chocolate chips instead of butterscotch.  I find that the butterscotch is overkill, since these bars are so sweet already.  The white chocolate mellows it out a little.  A classic!!

Needed something for a last minute bake sale. Made these exactly as directed. They were a hit. Didn't have a problem with them sticking in the pan. Made a second batch as we didn't get to sample the first batch. Was a great way to use up all of the 1/2 bags of different chips & nuts I had in the cupboard. Great recipe. Thank you.

This was an extremely easy and quick recipe.  It is very rich, so have milk standing by!    As another reviewer stated, it is best to combine the graham and melted butter in a bowl separately, rather than mix it in the pan directly.  This one is definitely making it into my recipe box!

I loved how simple this recipe is, with a little one at home I don't always have all of the time in the world to bake.  These were great, I took them to work and everyone raved about them!  This recipe will for sure be included in my holiday baking!

Without non-stick spray or parchment, these may form a rock-hard layer in your pan as mine did.  It's odd that something with this much butter would stick, but that is exactly what they did, thus they were useless to take to the event I had planned.  Very frustrating, although the upside is that we got to eat them all ourselves, and as posted below they are quite good!  So:  either use non-stick spray or line the pan with parchment before baking.

This recipe was great! My mom makes these around the holidays but uses a store bought package that has all the ingredients. I was unable to find it so I tried this and it was great! On the first try I mixed the graham cracker and butter and the crust came out fine. I did, however, not use the recommended amount of chips (I maybe left out a 1/4 cup for each) as it looked like too much before I cooked it. Good thing b/c it is very sweet and it would've been too sweet. Great recipe, just adjust to taste!

Absolutely fantastic recipe! I used left over pulverized Teddy Grahams that I had leftover ,because they had gone stale, as the crust and used crushed pecans for the nuts because that was what I had on hand.

I substituted peanut butter chips for the butterscotch chips and used 2c of graham cracker crust like other reviewers suggested. They turned out well and everyone seemed to enjoy them. A little too sweet for my tastes!

Delicious!!!! I made them for a get together, and was worried that I wouldn't get any. Everyone loved them, and there sure weren't very many left!!! Putting foil in the pan makes them easy to cut and get out of the pan without them breaking.

A crowd pleaser, for sure. I used 2/3 cup each of semi-sweet chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and butterscotch chips. I put the coconut on and then poured on the sweetened condensed milk on top. The sweetened condensed milk was made from scratch using 1/2 cup boiling water, 1 cup nonfat dry milk, 3 tablespoons melted butter, 2/3 cup sugar, and a few drops of vanilla.

I have changed the recipe slightly with great success.  I find the condensed milk very difficult to spread so I pour it into a bowl, whip it and then mix in 1 cup of miniature marshmallows which I then poor over the graham cracker crumbs.  I also added in 1/2 cup of Skör bits and replaced the walnuts with chopped pecans.  VERY popular in my house!

This was my first attempt at baking bar cookies, but I was very pleasantly surprised with the results (much easier than making chocolate chip cookies!)  The results were comparable to the decadent bar cookies I've bought from bakeries/restaurants.  The only modifications I made were substituting peanut butter chips for the butterscotch and reducing the amount of coconut flakes to a light sprinkling on top (I'm not a huge coconut fan and it's less messy!)

If you love rich, sweet bar cookies, this one is a no-brainer!

Love this recipe! I take these to all of my casual get-togethers. I do use milk choc chips instead of semi sweet - just preference. If I want something sweet I go for it! Bravo to this classic bar.

These were a little too sweet for me but my boyfriend really liked them!  I made them with peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch.

I see that some of you have a problem with the graham cracker crumbs being left behind. I put the condensed milk as my 2nd layer over the crumbs. It tastes great and holds them together!

I'm not very good at baking, so I made these for a cookie swap at Christmas - where they became known as my "Death By Diabetes bars", and were a huge hit! 

As per the suggestions, I added the condensed milk after the coconut (which helped the coconut become an integrated part of the bars' crunchiness), and then topped with more sprinkled coconut for aextra flavor. I also cut them into rather small squares ("bite-size"), so people weren't overwhelmed by the sweetness.

I'm torn on these.  I'll admit when they first came out of the oven, I was really unimpressed with them but I tried them again the next day and they were pretty good.  I used white chocolate chips instead of butterscotch (I'm really not a fan) and fat free condensed milk.  If I make these again (I'm really NOT a big sweets fan, I only tried this for some Christmas baking), I may try decreasing the graham cracker and butter...I couldn't taste them anyway, and this would cut some fat.  I will also make sure to use finer chopped nuts...either that or add more of them.  I really liked the flavor they added but unfortunately, there weren't enough.  I think if I chop the nuts smaller, it will even out the taste a bit more.

This was quick, easy, and very tasty.  I did like most suggested and poured the condensed milk on last.  I also might suggest making it in a smaller pan so the bars are thicker.

Yummy.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I took this to work one Friday at about 2 in the afternoon after people had already brought cinnamon rolls AND donuts and they still polished off the whole pan!  I should add that I think only 10 people were there that afternoon!

This one is a huge hit with my family and friends. It's too sweet for me, but everyone else proclaimed it 5 stars, thus the rating. I used slivered almonds for the nuts, since I had some I needed to use. I think it would be better with chopped pecans however. I used whole 6 oz bags of chocolate and butterscotch chips and an entire small bag of coconut, incorporating another recipe that is very similar. I layered all the ingredients, then poured the sweetened condensed milk over all. I think I would have liked this better with something other than butterscotch chips, they are too sickening sweet for my tastes. I was outvoted, since everyone else loved them as is. This is sweeter and more calorie laden than any candy bar you could buy. PS: I used regular salted butter and 2 cups graham cracker crumbs for the crust, worked fine.

Really good, a bit too sweet for my taste. The calorie count freaked me out a little, though! You can knock off more than 100 cal. per serving if you use caramel/butterscotch dessert topping instead of sweetened condensed milk, cut down the chips, coconut and nuts by about 1/3, and use the low-fat margarine spreads instead of butter. When you think about how good these are and about how many you could eat, the cut calories make a huge difference!

My sister made this all the time when we were children. To this day they are as delicious as ever. Made these for my husband and always asks for more. And not to forget, these are very easy to make.

I changed out the butterscotch chips for  peanut butter chips. I also added 1/4 cup of hot water to the condensed milk. My daughter said she had to freeze her part of the cookie bars so she wouldn’t eat the whole batch. They are wonderful! We will make them again soon. Thank you for the recipe.

The taste was good, but it didn't firm up until I put in the reefer overnight. Like the concept, but will try a different recipe.

Doesn’t taste as good as my mom used to make?  I think it needs more chips and coconut?  Also, the crust is crumbly.  I will maybe try again?

The comment to put the butter with the graham crackers is a better instruction. Melt the butter and combine with the graham cracker crumbs then press into the pan. I used pecans, I think I would prefer walnuts. I also layered my pan with parchment paper based on comments. Tip my mom gave me, always make small bites, people generally don’t want to commit to a big sweet, but small is more approachable.

Great recipe but one thing they don't tell you is to mix the melted butter really good with the Graham cracker crumbs. Otherwise they come out tasting like your eating the crumbs.

I love this cookie bar!! I always double the crust and butter to make a thicker crust. I crush the graham crackers instead of buying already crushed ones (makes a difference) I always melt the butter in a separate bowl and mix the Graham cracker crumbs thoroughly in the same bowl before pressing Into the 13x9 pan. I use dark chocolate instead of semi to help cut the sweetness. Make sure to pour the condensed milk BEFORE the coconut that way the coconut will toast in the oven. Soooo good. I always get so many compliments with these.

I made these with the following changes: I doubled the recipe, mixed melted butter with store bought crumbs then pressed onto foiled and greased (very important step) 17×11×1 sheet pan, I poured one can sweetened condensed milk over the crust, 1 layer of choc chips, 1 layer of butterscotch chips, 1 layer of pecans and 1 layer of coconut. Finishing with the 2nd can of sweetened condensed milk over the top. The baking time was 6 to 7 min longer so that the center of the pan could get toasted. I was able to lift the bars out of pan easily after cooling on wire rack. The pan was still warm when I lifted them out and I think that's helpful because once the bars are completely cooled the melted ingredients turn into cement almost. Very difficult to get off pan. I cut into bars and stored in an air tight container putting a piece of wax paper in between layers of bars and stored on countertop.  Came out delicious as always!

Very tasty but very sweet. I didn’t read the reviews before I made it but definitely mix your graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter before layering the other ingredients. Will definitely make again.

I made it and it's delicious! I followed some suggestions and mixed the grahams crackers with the melted butter and pressed into pan first. Followed recipe but reserved a bit of milk to add on top of coconut, but may not repeat that step next time. I also popped finished product into frig overnight to cool and that made the cutting easy.

This is the closest recipe to how I make them (except I omit the butterscotch chips, and sometimes add other nuts, and occasionally crushed pretzels to the base, with a bit of extra butter). I like how it's all in one pan ... melt the butter in that one pan, don't need to grease the pan, all super easy. And they're a hit with everybody!

Extremly easy to make. Variety in nuts or type of chips is a personal choice. I found this to be very good tasting and overall a keeper to make many times over.

My fault it didn't turn out well it wasn't clear you need to press the butter into the crumbs. I used more then it required. I added more chips I should have just followed instructions.

I followed the recipe exactly, using the tip to melt the butter in the pan first, and then add the graham crackers and pack them down. They were just as I remembered them from years ago-so scrumptious! They cut and came out of the pan easily.

So easy! Will make this often as these are one of my favorite treats! There is a shop in town that sells them for like $6 for a large square, but now I can make a whole pan for that! I've had some others that I have bought that were not worth eating, but these.... YUM!!!

SUPer easy and delicious. I made a couple of adjustments- I used cashews(instead of...pecans? walnuts?), sweetened condensed coconut milk(instead of regular sweetened condensed milk), and white chocolate chips(instead of butterscotch). Would definitely make again and i highly recommend you try it with these few adjustments, if you love coconut (like me!)

These have always been my favorite holiday treat.  However, I've developed a depressing sensitivity to nuts. I made the bars last year and they were too sweet. This year I crushed up pretzels, for that salty crunch. Perfect!!

I changed Oreo cookie crumbs for gram crackers. I just love chocolate. My Grandmother used to make these for me, she called them Hello Dolly's. Don't ask me why. I find them made by bakery's every once in a while, but this is my first time trying it out for myself.

These are so good! I added half a cup more graham cracker crumbs and more butter because I like the crust. They are very messy, though. But delicious and so easy to make.

We love these decadent cookies, but in the years I’ve been making them, I’ve never layered them.  I just mix all together and bake.  You can feel your blood sugar shoot up as you eat them........over and over until they are GONE!  
Make a double batch if you want one for yourself....

Definitely experiment with these bars.  I don't care for butterscotch chips (too sweet) so I also used peanut butter chips.  I also did half slivered almonds and half pecans.  For interest and some tang I also added dried cherries - I will do that going forward - they were great! Oh and use salted butter - it gives it a better contrast between all the sweet toppings.

had many requests for the recipe.  I didn't have graham crumbs so substituted with chocolate ones.  Either one would work just as well I am sure.

There is no way that 1 1/2 inch piece would ever be considered a serving by anyone I know.  Trying to minimize the calories by pinching the size doesnt work for me.

Super easy to make and taste delicious! I will definitely make these again!
My notes: I made it without the walnuts for my friends who are "nut sensitive."  The edges stuck like crazy to the pan so I will try using parchment paper next time...or I will slide a spatula along the edge when they're still warm.

Whenever I make 7 layer bars, this is the recipe I use. They taste amazing and everyone I make them for, loves them. 
Instead of walnuts, I put oatmeal. And it still tastes great!

I used a topping of graham crackers in lieu of coconut because my wife doesn't care for coconut.   The dish is easy to make and I advise, as have others, to mix the melted butter and graham crackers and shape the mixture to the baking dish.  I found the dish to be very rich (sweet) so next time, I plan to use something other than butterscotch.

Tasty and easy but highly recommend spraying pan with nonstick spray before putting in butter.  Difficult getting out of pan with crust staying together.

I've been making these for about 40 years or so. I was given the recipe as written above, and always had the same problems everyone mentioned. One thing I changed this year, was to add 1/2 cup brown sugar to the graham crumbs. It helped the crumbs and butter to stick together instead of being left in the pan as someone mentioned.
My daughter asks for them each year and I didn't like making them because it's like chopping concrete out of the pan!  I never tried the parchment paper, but I will next time. Thanks for the tip

They need to be pressed flat before baking so they hold together better. It also works better to put the condensed milk on top of the graham cracker crumbs.

So upset. I have a cookie baking contest tomorrow at work, I've made these before but with another recipe. Thought I'd try this one, followed the recipe to a T. Just cut into it what a mess. It's like too much butter so the crust did not bake. I just now put it back in the oven, covered with foil so the coconut would not burn. What a bummer :( Fingers crossed.....

I paid attention to all the review suggestions and adapted the crust, reduced the chocolate, and warmed the milk. Big mistake all the way around. Follow the recipe if you have ever made them that way. My consumers were disappointed, "They just don't taste quite the same." And they didn't. They were very good, but not the same.

These are delicious!! These are great to try and these are so easy to makeup!! Btw here's a tip: don't buy crushed up graham crackers- crush them up in a ziploc bag first. Plus I've tried tons of recipes!! THESE ARE THE BEST!

tasty, but too sugary sweet for my liking, also it bothered me that the condensed milk doesn't completely melt into the bars, I got a mouthful of some straight condensed milk.

It turned out pretty good. Very very sweet. The next time I think I will use more graham crackers. The graham cracker layer was a little thinner than I like but that's just my personal preference. Might try using a store bought graham cracker pie crust the next time and see how it turns out. When I cut it into it the first time, it fell apart. So I let it sit out overnight and the bars were set  pretty well when I cut them the next morning. Overall a good recipe.

Outstanding!   Made with gluten free "graham cracker" pie crust (gorgeous pie), large flaked organic coconut and homemade  butterscotch.   Will definitely make it again, but next time, will try traditional method, in a square dish and cut into small pieces .

I'm not a baker and until this I had two desserts that I make only during the holidays. These were so easy and delicious, and a huge hit at the Christmas Eve dinner I took them too. Definitely miss the graham crackers with butter in a separate bowl  before spreading them in the greased pan. I crushed my own. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, except for using slightly toasted pecans instead of walnuts (it's what I had). A friend suggested serving these in martini glasses, which would be fun for a small dinner party. The toasted coconut on top was delicious and pretty.

I made as described, used the parchment paper trick.  One thing I do, drizzle raspberry or strawberry jam on plate to serve.  Helps cut some of the richness.

When I first saw this recipe,  I was excited.  I have made 7 layer bars dozens of times. Melting the butter on the bottom seemed to be a brilliant,  time saving trick.  Nope. The butter did not penetrante the grahm crackers. So the bar falls apart in the middle.

Super sweet.  tastes like a candy bar. the crust doesn't harden for me until i freeze them.  i've made this twice so far.  the first time i doubled the crust to try and get a thicker crust but it was just a mushy mess. the 2nd time i followed the recipe exactly and the crust worked better, not solid but not as mushy as the first.

Made it as printed and crust fell apart as well as the coconut on top flaked off. What a mess! Made it again using the exact same ingredients but went by the recipe/instructions that are listed on the Eagle Brand Condensed Milk can and they turned out perfect. Make sure you combine the graham cracker crumbs and the butter before you press in the pan and add the condensed milk over that mixture. Then add the chips, coconut and nuts. Hint: Use parchment paper to line the pan. After the changes these were delicious!

Tasty. To make these a little less sweet I used saltines in the crust instead of graham crackers. Also used white chips instead of butterscotch. I put the coconut on top and the milk over it; made the coconut kind of caramel-y. Easy, yum!

These bars are sooo delish!  I used all the listed ingredients with the exception of walnuts, replacing them with pecans because that was all I had on hand.  I used part of the butter to coat the pan, then melted the rest of the amount called for and a little extra.  I also added extra graham cracker crumbs and mixed the melted butter in with them.  I pressed the mixture into the bottom of the pan with the back of a spoon to create more of a crust.  I followed all of the other directions as listed and the result was amazing!  I think the graham cracker crust really added something extra because it had a great buttery taste and it seemed to help hold everything together nicely.  I will definitely be making these again very soon!  Next time I will try it with walnuts, but the pecans were very scrumptious!  My kids and I thank you very much for sharing this sweet treat :)

These are great!  I have made this recipe several times and get requests for these bars often.  My friends say they even taste better than the local bakery's version.  I do use salted butter instead of unsalted and that works fine.  This is a definite go to recipe.

Really great bars -- fast and easy. I would suggest popping these in the fridge for ~20 minutes after they cool to set the graham cracker bottom. Next time I make these I'll definitely add more nuts, too. Otherwise, yum!

I've made these on so many occassions I thought it was time to change it up and I'm glad I did.  I've never been wild about the butterscotch chips so I used Health chocolate covered toffee chips instead.  Never going back to my old recipe.

These were tooth-achingly sweet and pretty gooey.  I had recently had some other bars that seemed similar, so it's really my  own fault for not paying enough attention to the kinds and quantities of ingredients.  I'm sure there are lots of people who like this kind of bar, just not me!

These are good, but they never come out the same way each time I make them.  Either the crumbs don't stay together or the condensed milk is too thick after cooking.  I'll keep trying to master this and find out what to adjust.

Another variation with the 'Nilla wafers, is to use sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  With the sweetened condensed milk last.

I have a question for everybody who has made it.  Is this something I can make ahead of time and freeze or does it need to be served no more than a day after I baked it?  I am going to give it 5 stars even though I have not made it yet because I know it's giong to be delicious!

Love these!  They're always a huge hit when I make them, and I myself have trouble not eating them all up.      I've always known them as 7 Layer Bars, but whichever name you prefer, they're GOOD!  I use real butter, but in a recipe like this it doesn't matter, and because of allergies and just a personal preference I use pecans, not walnuts.

These are fantastic!!! Very sweet but just the way I like it! Good for a potluck because you can cut them up pretty small since they are so sweet and SOOOOOO EASY! I don't always measure out the chips and coconut it doesn't hurt to use more if you love the sugar rush!!!

so easy and a real crowd pleaser.  7 layer bars are one of those desserts that is 'take-me-back' comfort food.  i used white chips and butterscotch chips for a twist on this bar cookie, which turned out to be a real success. half the time you will have a majority of the ingredients already in your pantry.  if you are looking to make this recipe a bit less rich, i recommend using less condensed milk and using white chips vs. semi sweet  ALSO if you want another unconventional spin on this recipe, instead of crushing graham crackers, try crushed teddy graham cookies in honey or chocolate! yum!

I thought these were really yummy. I followed other reviewers suggestions and mixed butter with graham cracker crumbs and pressed into the bottom of the pan. It just seems like it would stay together better that way. I used a mixture of semi-sweet, white and peanut butter chips, but I used exactly the total amount of chips called for in the  recipe. I also added the milk to the top instead of before the coconut. I found them to be sweet, but definitely not too sweet. Will be making again soon.

Use parchment paper to line the 9X13 pan and spray the paper with a bit of non stick spray.  After they've cooled a bit I lift the entire batch out of the pan to cut.  It's easier to get a more uniform size and absolutely no sticking!

I was kind of craving these the past couple of weeks, so they really hit the spot. I had eaten some that others had made years ago, but I think this was my first time making them myself. I had to take some to a friend because my will-power is not that strong and I didn't want to eat all the leftovers myself.

This is so good, I make this when I have to prepare something for work and I never have anything to take home.  It is so easy to substitute - add other nuts, heath bar pieces, even warmed raspberry jam! YUMMY!

OK these are good.  Very sweet, my guys love them actually.  I prefer to mix the graham crumbs and butter before pressing into pan.  Used some white chipits in the mix with chopped pecans too.  Will make again but would like to see if I can get the chipits mixture to melt a little more.  Thanks for sharing!!

The crust didn't stay together very well.  Afterwards, I read some of the other reviews about mixing and pressing the crust into the pan and will try this next time.  Even though the crust fell apart, they tasted wonderful!

They were very good and easy to make, but kind of messy looking when cut.  Left out the butterscoth chips and doubled up on choc.

Definitely very rich and very good. I hate coconut and the idea was to make something for the people at work that wouldn't tempt me.. no such luck because I devoured these along with everyone. They are even better if you add an extra half cup or more of chocolate chips, I used milk chocolate ones.

I didn't have butterscotch chips, so I used 2 cups of chocolate chips instead. They turned out great. My family loved them! They were very rich and sweet, but that's a plus for someone with a sweet-tooth like me!

These are the best bars that i have ever made! Very sweet and rich but the butterscotch chips make an almost salty taste. Every time i make them they are gone before you can blink an eye! I made them for a bake-sale and they were the first to go! I would recomend them to anyone!

I was looking for a recipes for Hello Dollies, and this is it! Taste-wise, they were wonderful. However, my crust ended up so buttery that it could barely hold together, so you may want to increase the graham cracker crumbs. Also, 1 1/3 C of coconut dominates the bars a little bit if you don't love coconut. I, too, poured the sweetened condensed milk over everything at the end.

Excellent recipe, delicious just as I remember from when I was a kid.  I also followed other's advice and put the sweetened condensed milk on top of the coconut.  Also, very easy to make, aside from melting the butter and measuring out some ingrdients, it's a one pan recipe with minimal clean-up.  Thanks!

These tasted great, and you can get super creative with ingredients.  Be sure to make sure the inside is fully cooked and everything is melted.  I kept them in over 30 min. and the top was done so i took them out.  I had the following "problems"
-graham cracker crust was left on the bottom of the pan in some parts - it didn't stick to the bars in all places!
-the ingedients weren't all solidified and the bar was still really gooey (i did let it cool for over 3 hours).

I did follow the recommendation of others by adding the milk after the coconut.  Maybe I needed to add more milk (i added what the recipe called for) to fully reach the other layers??

But will try again!!   Thanks!

Loved this.  So easy and everyone ate it all up around the holidays.  Mom used to make something similar but with all chocolate.  I used peanut butter/chocolate combination.

I do not usually do any baking or cooking, but these looked easy enough for me to tackle. Husband loved them! A little too rich for my taste, but everyone else raved about them and the fact that I was the one who made them ;)

This is the best recipe for an easy-to-make gift at Christmas time.  I lost my recipe and was in a panic.  Thanks for coming to my rescue.  I was first introduced to this recipe in the 70s when I was in high school.  It's always a winner!

These were easy enough to make, but in spite of my very sweet tooth, I thought they were only okay.  There are other cookies and treats that I find much more satisfying.

These are my absolute favorite bars.  They are really easy to play around with too, all kinds of combinations work well.  They are really rich, but in a good good way.

Yummy! This is a great, traditional 7-layer bar recipe. I omitted the nuts, since I despise them and added some white chocolate chips since I  had some on hand and figured, what the heck! So addictive!

These were very sweet.  I think maybe next time I will use salted butter for a slight contrast in taste.  I like a salty sweet mixture.

Yum!  They make these at a summer camp that I go to and they're sooooo good.  I've been searching for a good recipe for quite a while and I finally found it.  These are nice and rich and melty just like I like 'em.  Thanks very much for the recipe.

I brought these bars to a party and they were a hit.  The only problem is that the graham cracker crumbs didn't really form a crust - they were like dust in the bottom of the pan after baking.

This is a great kid friendly recipe. My daughters and I just got finished baking up a pan and they turned out great! We used white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips and Macadamia nuts along with the other ingredients. Yummy!!! Not too overbearing, just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth. Thank You Patty, we will be making this recipe again and again.

These were a hit with my co-workers (I work overseas and the bars were an entirely new thing to them!). Might be better with a touch more milk as the gooey layer was a bit small.

This is good but you better have a sweet tooth if you eat it!  The only thing I changed was that I used finely diced walnuts instead of chopped because my kids do not like nuts.  They did not even know they were in there.  My husband really liked the coconut on top.  This is a dessert that you need a tall glass of milk with!

These are awesome!  I made one batch and they were gone the first day.  I didn't put walnuts, but instead put 1/2 cup white chocolate chips.  They are very sweet, but delicious and easy to make!  Thanks for sharing :)
