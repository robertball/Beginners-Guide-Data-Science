The sauce also made a good marinade.  I let the chops marinade overnight - added to the flavor I think

Yum! We loved this, but I did modify it slightly. I seasoned the chops first with an herb blend and let them sit for an hour. I didn't have applesauce so I used one fresh, chopped apple and a bit of apple juice instead in the salsa. The smoked flavor of the chops was to die for!! Don't overlook that part of the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  Be careful with the jalepenos..only use one. Great flavor & easy to make. Kids loved the chops & we loved the salsa.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I would have given the chops themselves 5 stars and the salsa 1 star. My husband and I really didn't care for the salsa; I found the white pepper incredibly overwhelming (1 tbs.??) and even though I can appreciate the taste of onions, this was just a little too much for me. Next time I'll just make the pork chops and skip the salsa.

I am looking for the perfect way to Barbeque pork chops - Way #1 - not my favourite so the search continues - to be fair - husband loved the "hotness of the onion and coolness of the apple sauce" - we differ on this one.

I really liked these chops. They were simple to prepare and looked beautiful after grilling. I liked the salsa too but my husband didn't. He thought the onions were "too hot." I used a Maui Sweet Onion and reduced the amount by half. I did dice it because I wanted the salsa to look like salsa. It wasn't the jalapeno because we really like hot and spicy food. Maybe I should try a different type of onion next time. Anyway, he did like the chops. I can see making them this way again.

Easy recipe for a quick, delicious meal! I let a few drops of tabasco sauce marinate the chops before I grilled them (no mesquite on hand, but I'm sure the flavor would've been excellent. The salsa turned out great and really added a litle kick to the pork chops. Picky boyfriend didn't care for the salsa but ate 2 pork chops! I served with Dave's Spanish Rice found on this site and it was all very tasty! Will make this again.

I gave this three stars which was an average between the two dishes 1 star for salsa 5 stars for the pork.  Salsa way too much pepper/spice against the cool applesauce.  Just didn't work.  I'd stick to just plain applesauce or some apple chutney for a side with this dish.  The pork was awesome with some small modifications.  I added rubbed in some Tobasco Chipolte along with some garlic salt, salt/pepper and let set two hours before grilling.  We also soaked the mesquite chips in some IPA!  We served with a side of beer braised carrots and gnocchi tater tots - a recipe from Top Chef Winner Michael Vittaggio -

We love pork and apple recipes so we made this Sunday since it was perfect grilling weather here.  Instead of applesauce, I peeled and diced 2 apples.  I used one medium onion, diced, but would go with less the next time I made this.  Our salsa was not runny but more of an finely chopped apple salad that we put on top of the pork.  It was pretty good, with just enough "heat" from the jalapeno.  Hubby ate the leftover apple/onion salad as a side dish.....guess he really liked it!

The applesauce made this goopy, just not the flavors I was hoping for.

I was hoping we would like this, but that didn't happen. The pork chops themselves were fine. It's the Apple "Salsa" that is the problem with this recipe. First the texture is just odd, it's definitely not like a regular salsa texture, and it's not smooth like applesauce, and it's not even like the chunky applesauce either. I think it's just an unpleasant texture for most folks both to feel in their mouth and to see with their eyes. When I made it I looked at it oddly, when my teenage son and his friend looked at it they made that same sort of odd face, and then so did my husband. Now for taste, I think that the flavors just don't really blend well together in this manner. The apples are of course cooked (when they were made into applesauce) but the rest is all raw. Even letting it meld together for quite some time just doesn't work for this salsa. The amount of white pepper this recipe calls for is far too much I believe - I only used about 1/4 tsp of fresh white pepper and it was fairly powerful. I think if you played around with the salsa recipe and tried some fresh apples diced finely and adjusted seasonings a bit you might be able to come up with something, but as the recipe stands it just doesn't work. If you are going to try it, I would suggest making a much smaller batch of the salsa also (it makes a LOT) because a - you probably won't like it and b - even if you do like it you wouldn't use that much.

These chops were very tasty!  The family and I thought the applesauce n chilies was kinda odd. We're  Mexican and used to tomatoe based salsa. Glad I had the chance to try these! Thankx Ranger1.
