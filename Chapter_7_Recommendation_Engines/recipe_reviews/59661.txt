I enjoyed this recipe, only changed a few things to make it a little healthier/lower fat.  I used red onion in place of the green ones and sauteed them in olive oil instead of butter.  I also used 1% milkfat cottage cheese in place of the ricotta.  This turned out very creamy and tasted very good.  I skipped covering the top of the enchiladas with cheese, so I only used 1 cup in the filling.  Didn't miss it!  I also used fresh spinach cooked down instead of frozen simply b/c I had it on hand and needed to cook it.  I will absolutely make this again.

I am reviewing my revised recipe, because I had a feeling this would be bland if made as is. Here were my changes- sautéed one diced poblano, half of a jalapeno, half of a red bell pepper, three cloves of garlic, one yellow onion, and one 4oz can of green chilies to add to spinach mixture- I also doubled the spinach. Added cumin, chili powder, parsley, and cayenne to the filling. Made “10 minute enchilada sauce” from this site to put on top. It was really, really good. The pepper combo made it much heartier. My meat loving husband even liked it!

This is a wonderful spinach enchilada recipe.  I followed the filling part exactly - only changing the store-bought red enchilada sauce to a homemade creamy white garlic sauce, as I prefer a white sauce with spinach.  I simply sauted minced garlic in  a small amount of butter - and added my thickener, flour in this case, to make a typical Roux, before adding half and half to the mixture until I reached the correct consitency.  Used only salt and white pepper for flavor.

The filling is brought together with the Ricotta - don't leave that out.  It lends a smooth and rich taste to the finished product.  

This filling could be made in advance and assembled before  cooking.  

Very good recipe.

I really liked these, but, like another reviewer, I added seasonings to the spinach / cheese filling, like onion powder, garlic salt, cumin, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and pepper.  This was a huge hit!

Ohhhhhh MY GOOODNESS!!! i got this in my email, and made it as soon as i got it! perfect, should be a 10 - for perfection! MMM. Note - i have been making green chili enchiladas for 20 years -- same fail safe recipe, always GREAT - but this recipe was intriguing - using the spinach and italian cheese --- wow! It also came our very smooth and silky, the whole house smells like i'm in mexico!  I made a few modifications based on my enchilada recipes - first i always use flour tortillas. I mixed green chili enchilada sauce with sour cream, some fresh cilantro and 1/2 a cup of salsa to make the outside sauce, put it on the bottom of pan and over the enchiladas.  I like mine wet and soft - also, cooked at 350 for closer to 40 minutes, just cook till it is bubbling and you've got it. What a great thing to be able to visit all recipes and expand your cooking peramaters! THANK YOU!!! this will be in my permanent rotation.

Everyone I have made these for loves them except for two of my sons who don't like even the thought of eating spinach and I have served them to a lot of people. I have never made them with ricotta cheese--I use cottage cheese instead because we like it better and it is cheaper. I also use cheddar or mozzarella cheese because that is what I have on hand, and fresh spinach cooked, drained and well chopped. I have used both corn and flour tortillas(we prefer flour) and both work great --the corn you do have to soften or they will crack when you roll them. Finally, green enchilada sauce is wonderful on them, but so is the red enchilada sauce from this site.

I printed this recipe knowing it would be good. I decided to add a little more of a mexican touch to it. Try this and you'll love them too. I took the sour cream and blended it with a roasted california chile, 1 roasted jalapeño, 1 roasted green tomato, 1 cube of chicken boullion, a 1/2 cup of half and half and a dash of salt and pepper. Continue with the recipe instructions and you'll be loved by your guests!

I love the enchiladas de espinaca at the local mexican restaurant and tried to copy them at home. To add color and flavor use tomatoes, add them part way through cooking the garlic and onions.  I use cottage cheese instead of ricotta (I like the texture and flavor better) as well as fresh spinach that I steam.  I use cheddar to top it off and sour cream when serving.

I thought these were just terrific.  I did sub a medium sweet onion for the green and added some seasonings to the spinach/cheese mix like cumin, salt, chili powder and hot pepper flakes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I gave this a 5 stars because the flavor was good actually, BUT too much spinach in each one. I would actually next time add 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese and 3/4 cup sour cream. They were a little too much spinach for me.  And I do like spinach. Or reduce the amount of the spinach you use from 10 ounces to 7.  I plan on trying the increase in the ricotta cheese and the sour cream myself.  And I used the enchilada sauce recipe on the site "RED ENCHILADA SAUCE" by Sara it is really good.  Good Luck, and I will make this again with the revisions.

I wish I could give this four and a half stars. It is a very good recipe, especially since it is a change from the usual. However, I agree with the other reviewers that it needed a good deal of extra seasoning. However, I will certainly be making it again with some extra ingredients (more onions, spices, etc.). Thanks!

Except for the enchilada sauce and the tortillas, there wasn't anything remotely "Mexican" about this recipe, and nothing comparable to the stuffing of a mexican enchilada. This has an Italian calaloni filling; why not just call it a "Mexicanish Canaloni"?? ;=}

I made this recipe 2 different ways, 1st as written with red enchilada sauce, was very good, but my presentation for them was lacking. They were flat and squishy, but all to delicious, Highly recommend this recipe. But in both batches I made I used fresh spinach 2 bunches in the 1st batch and removed the stems. But I also bought Mild Green Chili Enchilada Sauce, so I doubled the 2nd batch and added about 1 1/2 lb chicken, cut into chucks and cooked, then added the butter, garlic and onions, cooked the rest following the recipe threw with the Green chili enchilada sauce and HOLY COW, was soo delicious and yummy, I'm keeping this recipe close. It was amazing both verisons. But will say adding the chicken is a total plus.

Yum!  I added a little cumin, cayenne and onion powder to the spinach mixture.  The enchiladas were great and next time I'll add chicken.

This was definitely a winner!  I must admit I was a little skeptical at first, but I'm so glad I tried it.  I subbed nonfat cottage cheese for the ricotta and sour cream, and tossed some red peppers in with the onion (white, not green) and garlic.  I also mixed 2 cups of black beans in with the cheeses for added protein.  And I was stubborn and used flour tortillas and my own enchilada sauce because that's what I always do.  But I never in a thousand years would have been brave enough to put spinach and cottage cheese in my enchiladas if it weren't for this recipe and all the positive ratings.  And I'm so glad I did - they were so delicious, and super healthy to boot!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted to like it. Wasn't bad but not awesome either. I followed the recipe. People, please don't rate a recipe awesome or horrible if you change almost everything about it. Going through the reviews to see if I wanted to make it or not was frustrating. I often tweak a recipe to suit my familys tastes, but if you change everything about the recipe except you baked it - then reviewing it is kind of silly...If that is the case - just save the recipe with your changes. But don't review it

These were good, a different way to use leftover ricotta...I suppose alot of what determines the success of this dish is the enchilada sauce so I'd make sure you use a sauce that you already know you like, whether it be red or green. I made it exactly as written & next time I will definitely sub or at least add regular onion, definitely a pinch or 2 of salt & 1 or 2 roasted anaheim or jalapeno chiles. If I need to use leftover ricotta fine, but if not I'd use cottage cheese instead. I liked it enough to try it again (hubs did not) but really needs a bit more flavor.

I have made these a few times before, we love them that much!   
I added regular onion, jalapenos, minced cilantro and red bell pepper, oh, and I doubled the amount of spinach in addition to what the recipe called for. I also used FF cottage cheese blended in a food processor to make it smooth instead of ricotta. Instead of a red enchilada sauce, I used green and instead of mixing the sour cream inside the enchiladas, I mixed it with the enchilada sauce and poured over. Super delish, the whole family loved it!   

Note: In my opinion corn tortillas need to be lightly toasted to bring out their full flavor potential, however doing so makes them crispy and next to impossible to roll... Solution? Dip them in the enchilada sauce= instant rollability. :)

I am trying to start eating more "vegetarian" and so I was really excited to try this recipe!  My recommendations: flour instead of corn tortillas, add extra garlic, 1 (4 oz) can of diced jalapenos, instead of ricota I used low fat cottage cheese, light sour cream instead of regular and LOTS of seasoning...cumin, chili powder, garlic salt, onion powder and pepper. Sooo good! Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used a bag of fresh spinach and a few pieces of frozen spinach. I made too much so I used a larger casserole dish and used 12 corn tortillas. I used the Texas Enchilada Sauce recipe.

I have had Spinach Enchiladas before, but these were the best I have ever had. The most important things to follow to make this amazing is to add a can of green chiles as one reviewer suggested, and also make sure you're only using regular Monterrey Jack cheese by itself and not one mixed with colby. I never knew how AMAZING Monterrey Jack cheese tastes when its not mixed with something else....it really makes this recipe. My husband raved about these for days after I made them- he even told everyone at his work about them (and he usually isn't a spinach fan). This recipe is definitely a keeper!

May be the best spinach enchiladas that I have ever had - I use fresh spinach - low fat sour cream & low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta - use a slightly bigger casserole pan to not crowd the enchiladas as the finished in the oven - very good recipe!

This was very good once I added a lot more seasoning (chili powder, a lot more garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper, cayenne).  I also used sweet onion in addition to the green onion (sauteed in evoo instead of butter) and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta b/c it's healthier. I only used 1 cup of jack cheese, on the top, and added salsa to the enchilada sauce for more veggies.  I filled 4 whole wheat tortillas (big ones).  It was spicy and good!

Great base recipe.  If you'll notice, The recipe doesn't include any spices -- in other words, a blank canvas.  
I swapped fat free cottage cheese for the ricotta, green enchilada sauce for the red, used about half of a large clamshell of fresh spinach instead of frozen, and used flour tortillas because I can never seem to roll corn tortillas without having them split.  
For the filling I added a 6oz can of diced green chiles, some leftover salsa verde, and a couple shakes of red pepper flakes, cumin, and chipotle seasoning.  
Without the seasonings, I think the recipe would be a little bland but it's really easy to jazz it up.  Have fun with this one -- you can make it delicious!

I made this over the weekend, and I made it just like the recipe stated. It turned out bland and I didn't like the green onions in it. I think a regular onion would have tasted better.

LOVE this recipe...the only change i made was to use green enchilada sauce instead of red but i imagine its great either way...next time i will spice up the filling a bit with some chopped and sauteed jalapenos, some cumin, etc. because the filling tasted like basic spinach filling...great recipe tho...just needs a lil more mexican flair... :)

On the whole, we really enjoyed these enchiladas! The filling does need more seasoning though.

Easy and delicious. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and used the whole 28-oz can of enchilada sauce.

This recipe was a little disappointing. It sounded great, but my family hated it! Ricotta cheese and enchilada sauce was a weird combo.

I found this recipe while looking for a low carb, high protein option for a diabetic, vegetarian, new mom.  High calcium and high iron are also important for new moms.  It sounded so yummy to my meat-eating self and husband that I made a double batch to have one for us and it was yummy.  (His picky kids, however, did not care for it very much.)  Similar to previous reviewers, I added (for each batch) one 15oz can of black beans and one 7oz can green chiles.

These were amazing!  I pretty much kept the recipe as is, other than added a little seasoning salt to the spinach mixture, subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta, and used the 10 minute enchilada sauce recipe.  So amazing.  Oh, and I also used fresh spinach instead of the frozen, and sweet onion rather than green.  Just minor changes.

Loved this! I had some fresh spinach that I needed to use up and decided to try these. I sauteed sweet onion with fresh garlic in a splash of olive oil. Added the fresh spinach and sauteed until spinach wilted. I only had a small amount of 2% cottage cheese, added that and added feta cheese with sundried tomato and basil. Added some shredded Mexican cheese and some red pepper flakes for a bit of spice, then rolled in 9 inch tortilla's. The last tortilla I only had a little of the filling left so I added some cooked shredded chicken and salsa to complete the last tortilla. Not sure which one I liked better. Both versions were delicious!

I made this tonite and we just loved the spinach instead of a meat filling. I omitted the enchilada sauce and topped the enchiladas with chopped, canned tomatoes, 1C. Picante sauce and then the cheese.

We are not a vegetarian family. But, this recipe makes us rethink our decision. To spice up the recipe I added a small can of green chiles. This dish is easy, healthy, and savory.

We LOVED THESE! I got these ready last night for dinner tonight and they really exceeded my expectations, but I did make a few slight changes. First, I was being lazy, so I didn't saute anything, just mixed it all up in a bowl, omitting the butter, to which I added a little salt and pepper to taste. The other change was to use 1-10oz. can red enchilada sauce and 1-8oz. can of salsa verde, which gave awesome flavor and spice. Even my meat-eater of a husband raved over these! I served these with a spicy salsa on the side and spanish rice. I will definately be making these again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought this was good, but the filling is a little bland. Like some of the other posters, I added a healthy amount of salt, pepper, onion power, chili powder, and cumin. I also added two raw ears of corn, cut off the cob, which I thought gave it a nice crunch. I would definitely make this again, but would probably try something more to give it a little extra flavor.

I'm a big fan. I haven't been able to find a "normal" beef or cheese enchilada recipe to make at home that I love.  Rather would get them out at a mexican restaurant. This is a great combo  of mexican flavor, but with a twist! I also did as other users recommended and added extra flavor to the spinach/cheese filling. Added garlic and taco seasoning. I also used a hot sauce versus a mild sauce. . Easy and yummy. Will make again!

I liked the idea of this recipe, but I didn't care for the ricotta with the enchilada.  The outside tasted mexican and the inside tasted like lasagna.

We really enjoyed these. I used what I had on hand, resulting in these changes: flour tortillas instead of corn, canned green chilis and white onion in lieu of green onions, and fresh spinach. Turned out great.

this recipe was not a big hit w/ my family.  I thought there was too much ricotta, and I would use white onions instead of green.  Maybe add some pinto beans or something.  it was just missing something.  I don't think i would make this again.

These are fantastic!  I used fresh spinach and just cooked it with the garlic and green onions until it was wilted.  Then just stirred the cheeses and sour cream into it.  Oh so very good!

My family enjoyed these, but didn't think they were anything special. I made them as written except I didn't have any Monterrey Jack cheese, so used sharp cheddar, and used flour tortillas instead of corn.  Also, rather than canned, I made my own enchilada sauce from a recipe on this site.  I will definitely make this again on one of our vegetarian nights and will be sure to use the jack cheese to see if we like it better.

I loved this recipe! I gave 5 stars but keep in mind I made several changes to this recipe because of what I had on hand. I ended up using this recipe as a sort of "jumping off" point.
I used flour tortillas instead of corn. Also, I added cream cheese to the inside and left out the ricotta. Instead of using the sour cream on the inside of the enchilada, I mixed only a couple tablespoons in with the enchilada sauce before I poured it over the top, and only used half of the jar of sauce. I used diced yellow onion and fresh spinach instead of frozen. After the onion and garlic had softened a little, I added the spinach and let it cook down a little bit. 
We loved it!

This turned out really good. Next time we would add more protein - like chicken or black beans to this dish to give it more volume. Extra sautéed veggies (like zucchini or maybe peppers) might be good too.

Very easy to make, but everyone complained that they didn't have much flavor. The enchilada sauce was the only thing giving it lots of heat.

Not bad. Next time I will add onions [in addition to the green onions], more garlic, cayenne, cumin, mushrooms, olives, and maybe pepper jack instead of monterey jack cheese. This would also be good with hot Italian sausage.

This was a surprising recipe for us. We love enchiladas and we love spinach, so we though we'd try it out. We really loved it, even though it was different from what we expected. My husband kept telling me after dinner, "Oh, that was so good!"  Just a note: I didn't have any ricotta cheese so I substituted cottage cheese, and it was still really good! I also used fresh baby spinach rather than the frozen (yuck!). We loved it!

This passed my ultimate taste test: my husband devoured the whole pan! I don't like cottage cheese, but I thought these were pretty good, and I had enough to freeze some for another time.

Amazingly delicious.  I added cumin, chili powder, jalapeno peppers, garlic powder, 1/2 red bell pepper chopped, 1/2 onion chopped to the spinach mix.    It was a hit and sooooo easy to make.

These enchiladas are DISGUSTING. I don't know how they managed to get five stars! "If you like spinach and mexican food, you'll love these easy spinach enchiladas"... I love spinach and I love mexican food, but I do not like enchiladas stuffed so full of pure spinach that I'm gagging.
If you decide to make these, add some black beans and some sauteed mushrooms and halve the spinach. Better yet, find a different recipie!

I really wanted to make enchiladas for my vegetarian mother but I would not recommend using italian cheese in a mexican dish. Tasted like a strange form of manicotti. Second time I used quseo fresco (fresh mexican cheese) which is sold in almost every supermarket and jack cheese. I also added mushrooms and chopped green chiles. They were excellent.

This was good, but not what I was expecting. The ricotta and spinach made it taste very manicotti-like. Next time I will probably use more sour cream, less ricotta, and add more spices (I added a little this time.) Overall, quick, simple, and delicious.

These were very tasty. I used a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen, which added a bit of time for chopping, but I definitely think it was worth it. I will spice up the filling a bit more next time, but all in all, it was really good and easy.

I think this is probably the worst recipe I have ever gotten off this site.  I followed the recipe and I love all the ingredients, but together they just didn't taste good.  It was a waste of time and money and food.
UPDATE: I remade these and this time layered them in a baking pan, rather than stuffed each individual tortilla, which works better for a soggy dish like this.  I added extra spinach and used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  It turned out much, much better.

Very good dish.  I used low ricotta cheese and nonfat sour cream.  I didn't have any Monterrey Jack Cheese, so I used Parmesean cheese in the filling and Mozzerella Cheese on top of the sauce.  I will try the Jack one of these days.

My family loved this recipe. The only additional ingredient I used was shrimp. I followed the first two steps with minced garlic and scallions, then added shrimp. I seasoned the shrimp with garlic salt and Old Bay. Then I followed the rest of the steps. Glad I come across this recipe!

This was delicious. I was looking to make a comfort type of food without using red sauce for the 3rd time this week so I used Trader Joe's Verde sauce. I also added mushrooms and used fresh spinach. Was very delicious with jalapeno Monterrey jack.

We live in southern New Mexico, where it's hot, so used microwave.  Warmed tortillas in pouch in micr o, turned up the heat with local seasoning.  Nuked it for 5 minutes, and WOW!  This with ice cold servers and it did the trick!  Will definitely make again.  PS.  Warm chili powder and seasonings with a bit of lard to bring out bloom and DON'T forget salt and pepper.  Green or red enchilada sauce, either is good ??

So good. I added a little bit of white onions to the spinach, in addition to the chives, and I made my own enchilada sauce. I did, though, cut down the sour creme and took out the Monterey Jack entirely, sprinkling just a pinch of Parmesan on top. So so so good.

These really were great. I typically don't order enchiladas at Mexican restaurants, especially because I don't always like the enchilada sauce that goes on top, but these were pretty good! And a healthier option to making a deep-fried heavy-meat dish. My boyfriend and I both loved the cheesy spinach filling-- delicious!

The filling was excellent but the choice to pour canned enchilada sauce over this dish ruined it.  Will try again with a different sauce topping.

These were quite good and we'll definitely be making again.  I did substitute cottage cheese, used fresh spinach (about 2 1/2 to 3oz) added cumin, garlic, and a little salsa Verde.  Topped with red sauce, salsa Verde, and a little white garlic sauce.  I was a little concerned about the texture, so I didn't overload shells while filling (and I'm glad).

The recipe is bland without adding spices and salt! I used 16 oz thawed spinach, 1 red onion and several cloves of garlic. I added a ton of cumin, paprika, salt, pepper and garlic powder. I suggest tasting the mixture before putting it in the tortillas bc adding the sour cream, etc made it taste a little bland again. I ended up adding a few dashes of hot sauce. I used a 1/4 cup of cheese on top to save on calories. I highly recommend using TJ's enchilada sauce!

Top notch!  Even my picky eaters ate them and asked for more.  I only added salt and pepper when I sautéed the vegetables and to the filling.

Easy recipe. A couple of suggestions - add more spinach (another 1/2 box at least) and saute the onions and garlic until cooked. Good recipe.

Yum!! This was really tasty. I used olive oil instead of the butter, and I didn't have sour cream so I just added a bit more ricotta cheese. I used less of the shredded cheese to decrease the fat in the recipe. I used flour tortillas and instead of enchilada sauce I made a roux with oil, whole wheat flour, some garlic, milk and shredded cheese. Poured that on top before baking. 
Delish!!!

a-m-a-z-i-n-g! I followed other reviewers and added green chiles and seasoning to the spinach and it was delicious! I used flour tortillas instead of corn because the stores didn't have them in stock. Instead of the canned sauce, I made the "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce" on this website and when it came together, EVERYONE'S TASTEBUDS WERE HAVING A FIESTA!!

Love these! I just made two simple changes to the recipe. I didn't add the green onions (my own issue- I hate them), and I chopped fresh spinach. They were awesome!

This recipe was very good, based upon reviews, I used a yellow onion instead of a green onion to saute with the spinach, and also added about 1/2 pack of taco seasoning to final filling mixture.  Instead of red enchilada sauce I used Green.......this was KEY!!!!  I sprinkled green onions on the top right before  baking.   Very good, even made a double batch to freeze!

I loved this, and I even lightened it a bit.  I subbed Brummel and Brown for the butter and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and I used part skim ricotta cheese.  Still delicious!

Yum...these are way better than any other spinach enchiladas I’ve made before. I used 1/2 a white onion instead of green and cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Next time I’ll use a tiny bit if cream cheese instead of ricotta and I’ll use queso instead of enchilada sauce. They won’t need as much cheese inside with the queso on top (too sloppy). They are going to be awesome!!!

This was very tasty & so easy to make.  The only "tweaking" I did to this recipe is that I used fresh spinach and added a can of green chilies to the mixture.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the enchilada sauce.  And that's only because I've made this twice and used a different sauce each time but I can't seem to find one that tastes "authentic".  So next time I try this recipe, I'll also make my own sauce and see how that comes out.  But the filling portion of this recipe is 5 stars in my book.

I decided to make this recipe because I do a vegetarian or fish dish one to two times a week.  I wasn't sure of putting spinach with corn tortillas... it was good!!  I didn't have green onions so I used an equal amount of chopped yellow onions.  Thank you!

This recipe was pretty good, although I did not like the enchilada sauce that I used.  I am not sure if a different brand would have made it better.  The filling was yummy and creamy though, although it maybe could have used just a little more spices to flavor it.  All in all it was good and worth the time.  I filled a whole casserol dish and we had dinner for the week!

You have to try these!  I made a few changes. I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and light ricotta.  I like other reviewers seasoned the spinach mixture. I used a premix taco seasoning....but you could make it up with what you have. I goofed and added all the cheese to the filling, but we kinda liked it that way. We put extra yogurt on top.  Next time I think I will add a can of green chilies.  I thought we would get two nights out of them but they got eaten up!  I served with refried beans.  It was so fast and easy....it will be on my go to list for sure:)

This was excellent and and easy recipe for a first time enchilada maker.  I used some refried black beans to line the tortilla.  It adds some more nutrition and holds the seams together.  Made it once for dinner and had tons of leftovers and once for a large dinner party.

It's great when the family asks for spinach!  Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou!  Very, very easy to mix up.  Made with Asadera cheese the first time because we had it on hand, and Monterey Jack after that.  Love it both ways. - Have used tomatilla sauce (homemade) and red salsa instead of enchilada sauce.  Love it both ways that way too.  BIRTHDAY REQUEST RECIPE - WOW, MY SON ASKED FOR THESE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY! Thanks, Sadonia2!

I had to make one slight change to these, I thought I had green onions but I was wrong. I did have some shallots that needed using up so went with those instead. Great enchiladas enjoyed by the meat eater as well. Thanks for the recipe SADONIA2.

I gave this recipe 4 starts because I thought it tasted a little bland. The texture was really good but the enchiladas didn't have much flavor. Next time I will add sauteed white onion instead of the green onion and maybe some crushed red pepper to kick up the seasoning a little bit. Although, my two dinner guests and my boyfriend (all of which eat meat) LOVED the dish, everyone of them went for seconds. I was surprised that my meat-eating friends loved it so much! 

Thanks for a great base recipe, everyone really enjoyed it and hopefully when I spice it up a bit, i will, too. :)

These were just ok, but certainly don't deserve the negative press some of the reviews give. Anyway, the key to frozen spinach is to dry it super duper well, in a colander, then pick it up and squeeze the lump over and over with both hands until nothing else comes out, then wrap it in towels (paper ones, clean dish towels, whatever) and squeeze it some more. The green onions were kind of weird to me here, and I wish I'd used pepper jack or else fried up some Anaheims with my onions because the overall effect was of pizza, not Mexican food. It's still a great idea & not hard to modify to your personal tastes. I used fat free ricotta (as I do in all savory fillings) and the texture is not noticeably different from regular ricotta in this recipe. P.S. - If you're worried about this dish being bland, use a jar of taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce. I wish I had, the stronger flavor of taco seasoning would have taken out the pizza similarities! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sadonia2!

These were so good! Great for our vegetarian tastes! I, like everyone of course, changed the recipe a bit, added avocado chunks, mushrooms and artichokes to the filling. I also used marble cheese instead of monteray jack. Such a good recipe that you for sharing!

Pretty good. Not "knock your socks off good," but tasty nonetheless. I hosted my parents for dinner last night (my hubby is out of town). B/c my hubby HATES ricotta cheese, sour cream & "saucy" enchiladas, I took the opportunity to make something calling for these very ingredients while he is away. :) I also try to make healthy dishes when my parents visit. My dad is on a heart-restrictive diet. I know he struggles to eat "good for you" foods (it's difficult to change a lifetime of unhealthy eating habits). If I can convince him that healthy food isn't bland, I'm making progress. :) While I like these, my parents & I both agree that my "modified" version was slightly better.... Since this recipe yielded 10 enchiladas, I made 1/2 as directed & the other 1/2 w/ 1 c. shreded rotisserie chicken / salsa verde. For both batches, I slightly altered the filling. I added 1/4 c. fat-free half-n-half (for creaminess - I do the same to my florentine shells) & 1/2 t ea. of chili powder, cumin, basil & Mexican oregano. This gave my filling just enough spice, but kept the heat factor in check for my mom's sensitive palate. I also poured ~ 1/2 c. of "sauce" in each pan b4 adding my enchiladas, the remaining sauce & cheese. My only other change was subbing flour tortillas for corn ones (just seemed more appropriate). All in all, these were good (and unique!), but didn't deliver the "wow" factor I was looking for. Thanks for a creative twist on an old favorite, SADONIA! :-)

These are a weeknight staple in our house. I add a red or green pepper, yellow onion (instead of green) and a diced zucchini to the filling for a heartier mix. My family loves it!

I have been using allrecipes for quite some time and this is my first review!  This is the second time I made these and it turned out VERY well!  The reason is because I messed up and bought pepper jack cheese instead of monterey.  I mixed it with Mozzarella cheese to balance out the flavor and it was perfect!  Many of the comments say that this was bland....use pepper jack instead and it won't be.  I also baked one chicken breast and then shredded it and added it to the mixture.  We cooked some brown rice and had it with the enchiladas and it was fabulous!

I followed this recipe as written and it was just OK.  I think the filling itself was pretty good but using canned enchilada sauce is not very tasty.

We really enjoyed these enchiladas. However, something is missing that I can't quite put my finger on. I think that if it had had some pieces of chicken or pork, it would have been better. It was similar to eating creamed spinach in a tortilla with enchilada sauce on top. Thanks for the idea!

I loved, loved, loved it!  The only thing I did differently is I didn't use canned enchilada sauce I used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe (on this site) submitted by "sal".  Delicious and easy...has to be better than canned.  (I've made these twice in the last month!)===yum...this one for me and the Angela's awesome enchiladas for the family.

This sounded great, but we made it exactly as written and nobody would eat it. It was a weird flavor combination and I don't think we'll be making it again.

I made a few changes to suit my own taste and to make the dish a little healthier. I couldn't be more pleased with how it turned out!   I made the spinach mixture with: sauteed red onions, garlic, chopped mushrooms, and spinach. I added some extra spices such as red pepper flake, salt, black pepper and garlic powder. I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese to cut down on the fat.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

These were good but needed some sort of kick. I think next time I will add a little cumin to the mixture and perhaps some other spices. Still yummy though.

This recipe lent well to small substitutions, like using one small yellow onion, salsa verde, low-fat ricotta and fat free sour cream, and flour tortillas. I was really after a recipe that I had at a local mexican restaurant I visited a couple months back.  I did cut the ricotta down to a half cup and that was more than sufficient and I added a little cumin and oregano to the filling. I decided to add one very large shredded chicken breast as my husband made it very clear that he would not eat "vegetarian" enchiladas. This was an easy and tasty enough recipe for an enchilada novice, according to my husband who swears his mother is the Queen of all Enchiladas and the substitutions were great. I noted my changes and will submit my own recipe. NOTE: Next time, I don't think I'll use ricotta. I'll sub in something else.

These were a HUGE hit tonight for supper! My daughter isn't a vegetarian, but she doesn't eat much meat and I had a feeling she'd enjoy these. I had some leftover roasted chicken, so I chopped that finely and added that to the spinach mixture on the last few enchiladas, just to use up the chicken. They were creamy and tasty...not at all spicy, but that's ok in this case. I also don't like canned enchilada sauce, so I madE my own from a recipe here at AR. Definitely a keeper and one I'll make frequently.

Another veggie winner!  I tried out this recipe because I’ve always suffered from anemia and needed to find yummy ways to include more iron rich foods in my diet ‘and’ this recipe appealed to my inner Latina (cha cha cha).  Uhm enchiladas!  The first time I made this the BF and I wiped out the entire pan and he raved about how good these were.  Gonna make a vegetarian out of him yet, shhhh, lol.  Anyhow, now I love spinach, a must try for moms with reluctant spinach eaters in the family.

YUMSville! This was a last minute dinner which was easy to do and fun. I switched out the frozen spinach with fresh spinach and I would put less then a half cup of sour cream next time. Also, it's great reheated as leftovers. Mmmmmm.

Very easy and delicious! I added some spices (as recommended) but just a tsp of cumin and a tsp of red pepper, to the filling mix. I also made them again adding black beans to give it a little more umph and they turned out great.

I'd rather have this filling in lasagna.  I just didn't think it went well with the enchilada sauce.  I like the process though, I would use it again with a different filling

Five stars with some changes - I added extra white onions, used 3/4 c sour cream, and added black beans, red pepper, cumin, chili powder, and some extra enchilada sauce. With these tweaks, the enchiladas were amazing! I absolutely loved them and could keep eating them! Next time I might add some shredded chicken.

Yummy.  I added some cooked chicken.  The spinach tasted great but gave the enchiladas a strange texture. I added garlic salt, cumin, chili powder to the chicken for added flavor.

I thought this recipe was a little bland to begin with so I added 1 red bell pepper (diced) and 2 button mushrooms (sliced) (sauteed with the spinach), chili powder, cumin, red pepper and fresh cilantro to taste. I also used whole wheat tortillas, olive oil instead of butter, and 1/2 cup Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make this a little healthier.  After the additions the enchiladas were a hit! I would definitely make them again but with my additions.

I wish i had made a cheesy white sauce or garlic white sauce to go over it rather than the enchilada sauce. I also used low carb wraps which tasted and worked great. other than the sauce, would make again.

Yummy!  I used a yellow onion and fresh spinach because that's what I had.  I microwaved the veggies to save some fat.  Used green chile enchilada saucea and homemade flour tortillas (that's all I had).  Topped them with mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack because I ran out.  Super quick and easy.

I had to change it up a little by using 1% cottage cheese, fresh spinach and olive oil, I also used half the cheese and added cumin, garlic powder, salt and lots of hot sauce. This was  HUGE hit in the house, I will be making this recipe alot more!

Pretty good, but I found the filling on the bland side and will add a little more seasoning as some of the other reviewers have done.  I made half with red enchilada sauce and half with green and much preferred the green enchilada sauce - the flavors just agreed more with the spinach.  I also added a little finely diced chicken which I had poached earlier for some other recipes.  It didn't add a lot to it, but was an easy protein addition if you need it.

These were really good after a few changes.  I added black beans, corn, adobo, dried jalepeno, paprika and chipolte peppers. Not a fan of corn tortilla so I used flour.  Also a my special enchilada sauce.  YUMMY!  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

My husband loves this!  He loves Mexican food and this helps keep us home (saving calories) instead of visiting our favorite Mexican restaurant all the time.  I do add a can of black beans to the mixture.

DELICIOSO! The only changes I made were rubbing each tortilla with butter while heating to soften even more and adding about a 1/4c heavy heavy cream to the enchilada sauce. The second batch I made was with cheddar and it was just as good.

The only thing I did differently was to shred some cooked chicken breast to add to the recipe.  It was flavorful, healthy and simple to make.  My family loved it and we will certainly make this again!

I thought the filling was a little bland and too creamy.  To get more substance I later halved the current contents and added refried black beans and boca ground "beef" (since I am a vegetarian). To spice it up I added cumin and chili powder like some of the other reviewers suggested. I also found that some brands of enchilada sauce are kind of gross so now I will always go with Old El Paso brand. To top it off I used cheddar cheese. My boyfriend gave it 5 stars with my changes.

These enchiladas were just okay for us.  I didnt get any type of review from my fiance, which meant he didnt like them.  First off, the recipe needs more seasonings added.  I added more to make the filling taste better.  Second, instead of corn tortillas, it needs flour.  The corn tortillas just didnt hold up well with this or taste right.  I really think the flour tortillas would go better with this dish and be a better pairing with the spinach.  If you change those two things, I think this could hold up to a 5 star rating.  But as written I give it only 3 stars.

My boyfriend's reaction was an immediate "WOW this is great"! I really liked this recipe however I did add two chopped roma tomatoes, 1/2 a chopped yellow onion, and cumin to the mixture. Also, for more authentic flavor never use flour tortillas for enchiladas. The corn tortillas are also much healthier.  And now for a little trivia: Enchiladas were actually created by the French in the 1860's, during the Franco-Mexican war. They modeled them after crepes using locally available ingredients in Mexico.

SO good!  As others suggested, I used olive oil to saute the garlic and onion.  I also added onion powder, garlic salt, cumin and red pepper flakes to the spinach mixture.  I used flour tortillas because I'm not much of a fan of corn tortillas.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty & easy!  Check out my Green Chile Enchiladas variation:  -Add handful of thinly sliced mushrooms to spinach saute -Substitute Ricotta w/ sour cream -Add 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to sauce mix -Substitute canned enchilada sauce w/ 16oz jar of green chile salsa  Add mushrooms to spinach saute.  Make sauce with sour cream, cream of mushroom and salsa. Make filling with 1.5 cups sauce, sauteed spinach and 1 cup jack cheese.  Top enchiladas with remaining sauce and cheese. If you run out of spinach filling, make cheese enchiladas.  Yum!

We thought this was a bit bland.  I used a whole small onion instead of green onions.  Surprisingly quick to make but we probably won't have it again.

These were a big hit.  I just added cubed chicken that I cooked with the onion & garlic.  I also didn't have sour cream, but added more ricotta; nor did I have corn tortillas, but used whole wheat.  So good!

This recipe is great because it gave me the wonderful idea of adding ricotta cheese to an enchilada mixture. That said, I would up the proportion of ingredients to make a more hearty meal. I used 3/4 of the container of sour cream (saving the rest for topping) and I used the whole 15 ounce container of light ricotta cheese. To make this meal a bit more satisfying, I cooked up a box mix of wild rice while I was preparing the rest of the meal, and then I added a scoop of the rice to each enchilada.

The recipe lacks spice, so I would add about a tablespoon of cumin, 3 teaspoons of chili powder, and a bit of garlic salt (about a teaspoon) to the mixture. Also, I used about a full cup of green onions (this added a ton of flavor) and I chopped up 2 small green peppers and threw them in with the green onions and garlic. I found that it was a bit easier to skip heating the shells on the stove-top and just bake the enchiladas for about 12 minutes at 350 degrees (F, or until the cheese has melted on top. 

Instead of using the enchilada sauce, I decided to top the enchiladas with a bit of sour cream, jalapenos, and salsa verde. It was delicious! My boyfriend and my friend loved it (and my friend can be picky).

Three kids with varying tastes and a ricotta cheese-hating husband LOVED this.  (It's unheard of for all five of us to be enthusiastic about the same dish.)  Even better, it's gluten-free for me! So easy, my eight year old son helped make it.  Quick, inexpensive, healthy--it doesn't get much better than this!

I made a lower fat version using low fat cheeses and 1/2 the Jack called for and added salsa and green chilis rather than enchilada sauce and it was still boring.

These were yummy. The only thing I did different was add a bit of seasonings to the filling (cumin, garlic salt, pepper) because it seemed a little plain when I tasted it. Was a nice change from the usual chicken enchilada. I used the 'Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce' recipe from this site with these instead of ready made sauce. Was delicious :) Will make these again, thanks!

They are alright, however I don't think the taste of Ricotta goes well with the Mexican tastes.  Maybe if there were something a little more solid in them such as steak or chicken I may feel different, however the spinach just soaked up the ricotta and made the enchiladas very mushy.

OK, I went through the many reviews & here's what I did! Still didn't get it just right, but the 1st time usually isn't perfect :-). For one enchilada (me!) I used 1/2 cup fresh spinach, red onions, lots of seasonings-cumin, chili powder, oregano, cayenne, a little garlic salt (next time will add more of those, and some paprika-it needed more "kick"). I also added 1/4 cup shredded chicken, used 2 tbsp fat free cottage cheese & 1 tbsp fat free sour cream. I used reduced fat mexican cheese (about 3 tbsp) & a whole wheat flour tortilla. Used my own enchilada sauce & layered the bottom with a little fat free refried beans. It tasted great but like I said, it just needed more of the seasonings I'd already used, and a few more I didn't use! Will try this again for sure because it was original, different & healthy. Thank u for sharing!

We really enjoyed these!  We used regular onion for more flavor as other reviewers said that the filling was a little bland.  Also, an extra clove of garlic.  To make it a little lighter we used fat-free riccota which we had never tried before but it worked just fine.  We also made it with the "Red Enchilada Sauce" from this site which was very good!  Will be making again!  Thanks for the recipe!  One more thing... We used all extra sharp cheedar and it tasted great!

This dish was just OK. It seemed too bland, like it was missing something. Maybe some cooked, shredded chicken meat mixed in with the filling mixture would have helped. Some fresh cilantro could help too. I made it with fresh spinach wilted in the pan with the onions, and used flour tortillas instead of corn. Instead of canned enchilada sauce, I used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe on this website. My family ate all of this, but it wasn't a *Wow!* dish for us.

As others have written, the filling is reminiscent of that used in manicotti.  However, this recipe--though it could use a little spicing up--is more flavorful than that used in manicotti recipes I've tasted.  As usual with recipes of this type, the enchiladas merged together for an almost casserole appearance.  Never mind, it tastes wonderful anyway.  Frying corn tortillas reduced the odds that they will crack, which has been a frustration of mine in working with them.  My adult son, a somewhat discriminate (picky!) eater, not only tried these but said he loved them.  Victory!  This is a very cool twist on a standard recipe.  Nice idea.

Great recipe. I thought it even tasted better than the one you get in mexican restaurants. I just added one yellow Pepper to the Spinach cheese Mix because I like a lot of veggies. I also added some cumin, chilipowder and salt.

These are very good! I made them for lunch with leftover spinach. Also, I added some roasted red pepper strips (the kind that come in a jar and are meant as sandwich toppers). Yummy! The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that I found the filling to be a tad bit dry in the end -- it would have been nicer if it were a little bit creamier.

WOW, these were great!  If I can get my kids to eat spinach...its a five star.  They loved these.  I used fresh spinach...didn't cook it, but chopped it in my food processor and then mixed it with the other ingredients as per the recipe.  I also used cottage cheese in this and it was fantastic.  Awesome recipe Sadonia, and thanks!

I've been making these enchiladas for over a year and I love them, as does everybody I've served them to. I do agree with earlier comments about adding extra spices. I add nutmeg and red pepper flakes for an interesting flavor with a little kick. Making the red enchilada sauce found on this site tastes better than using the canned stuff.

I thought these turned out pretty good. I used enchilada sauce with medium spice to add more flavor. I would probably also add more fresh spinach next time, but the amount of ricotta cheese seemed about right.

Overall, everyone liked them. However, next time I think I will cut the ricotta down to 1/2 cup in order to be able to taste the spinach.

i found this recipe too be okay. I tasted a bit like manicotti filling with enchilada sauce on it. I think next time i will add a little more jack some red pepper and some rice to the filling to give it more bulk and keep it from being so runny. But overall a good recipe.

Both my niece and I are meatless so I made these for us at a potluck. EVERYONE loved them. I tried with fresh spinach but the frozen cooks much better. I found no need to warm the tortillas to wrap, just did straight out of the bag. I prefer green sauce over red but either way, they are fantastic!

We really like these, but they lacked one thing, fresh green chile.  I added green chile to the cheese and spinach mixture.  And if you don't want the corn tortillas to crack you really need to heat them with oil.  When I make casserole enchiladas you can use the corn tortillas right out of the bag, but with rolled you really need to fry them in oil first.

We absolutely love spinach enchiladas. I doubled the spinach and kept everything else the same for a higher spinach to cheese ratio. It was perfect.

I love Mexican food and lots of spice, so I added a can of black beans and a can of green chilies. This added more flavor and increased the dietary fiber. An entire can of chilies is likely too much for most people, but as I said, I love spice. Instead of warming the tortillas separately, I layered them as if this were a lasagna. Much easier. I will likely make this again.

These were a mild and delicious enchilada per recipe.  To spice them up would be easy enough by adding a chopped jalapeno.

I used 16 oz of fresh spinach instead. I wilted the spinach first with some olive oil and let it sit on a strainer for a few minutes.  I made this for my wife and mother and they both cleared their plates.

I've made this twice. The first time was with canned red enchilada sauce and the other night I made my own sauce (Thanks to Cookie & Kate) . Both were easy and delicious but the canned sauce had a little bit of an under cooked tomato taste. Kate's recipe was awesome. This dish is out of this world and reminds this Italian of manicotti.

I’ve been wanting to try this for a while and glad I did. These are delicious. Made exactly as directed and this recipe made 6 enchiladas for us in a 7x11 pan. I made a homemade enchilada sauce and we really enjoyed. Will definitely make again.

These were so easy to make and tasted great, I did add 1 tsp. of cumin, 1 tsp. of paprika and a tsp. of onion powder to the spinach mixture as suggested by others, I really think it gave the spinach a little pick-up. Definitely will make again.

So delish  ! My husband actually stopped eating  ( I was a bit worried ) he looked at me and said " this is so... good "!!! ..  It really was very good , I did add minced jalapeño and green chilies like others suggested, so it was a bit spicy , but that's how we like them . Definitely will make again !

Several changes. Doubled recipe. Made w/ almost all organic, including two 8oz bags of frozen spinach, two cans of Hatch organic enchilada sauce. Nice contrast of acid to spinach. Added sautéed crimini mushrooms, two cans of diced green chili’s, red onions;  the rec’d onion powder, chili/cumin powder and two tablesooons of roasted garlic paste. Mixed Mont. Jack and super sharp white cheddar. 
Yielded one pan of 10 enchiladas, then vacuum froze another eight. 
Delicious for two meals to start. Of course, lotsa sour cream on! Black Goya beans baked mixed with fresh organic salsa on side. Winner fer sure! This Cal-Tex couple is very happy!

I did what another recipe had done and combined a cup of sour cream with 7 oz. of green salsa, then spread it out on the bottom of the baking pan. I forgot the green onions, used 4 garlic cubes (instead of fresh since the cubes mix better) and added garlic powder and sea salt to taste. I used fresh and frozen spinach, a 16 oz. bag of frozen spinach plus about 1/2 to 3/4 of a bag of fresh spinach that I rough chopped. We like white flour tortillas instead of corn so that's what I went with. We will definitely be making this again, everyone agreed that they were the best enchiladas I've ever made. Yummy yum yummy

I loved this recipe!  My husband thought there was too much cheese.  I anticipated the cheese overload so added a can of salmon which changed up the flavour a lot.  Sounds strange but we eat a lot of salmon and we both enjoyed it.  The next time I make this recipe, I will cut back on some of the cheese I sprinkle on the top.  The Green Enchilada Sauce was perfect for us.  Not to much heat.  Will make this recipe again.

These were very tasty and easy to prepare. I added some orange bell pepper strips to keep them from going to waste.  I think that these are quite versatile, you could add many types of veggies to this dish.

I added Pepper Jack cheese to make it hot and substitute Monterey Jack with Colby Jack. I also added feta cheese and tomatoes into the mix. I would cook the enchiladas for more than 20 minutes because the filling wasn't as hot. I will make this again because it was so good : ).

I have made these twice. The first I followed the recipe exactly. I felt it needed more spinach in proportion to the cheese. The next time I made them, I added an additional 1/2 package of spinach and like it better.  The rest of the family like them both ways. I will keep this recipe and make it again.

Excellent!  The portions are perfect as the filling generously fills 10 tortillas! I used half the Jack cheese and La Victoria enchilada sauce.  A suggestions--after sauteing the onion and garlic in a 10 inch skillet, put it into a microwave bowl with the defrosted and squeezed dry spinach and microwave on high for three minutes.  Wipe out the skillet, add a little oil and warm the tortillas. This makes the clean up easier.

I will make it again.  I will definitely look for a substitute for the enchilada sauce, maybe just a chunky medium salsa.  Also, instead of using shredded jack, which I find bland, we just crumbled up sharp cheddar slices to use inside the enchiladas, and placed sliced Havarti over the top.  It is very quick and easy to make.  We ate it two days in a row.

Excellent!
A few modifications; Mountain High Original whole milk yogurt in place of sour cream, my personal home-made Hatch green enchilada sauce freshly roasted chile, a combination of spinach, kale,  and spring greens, as well as five different kinds of cheese in lieu of one. Delicious, didn't last long.

Vegan daughter didn’t like so much. Spinach hating husband loved it. I don’t think I found a good enchilada sauce. There was only one choice in the grocery store. In hind sight, I would make the sauce from scratch. Willing to try it again.

easy recipe but i though it was extremely bland. i'll try it again but with some twist. I didn't add anything  to it this time. I like to follow the recipe exactly when i first try something. most reviews with 5 stars are people who changed the recipe. more people should try it with out altering it first.

A very tasty, quick and easy recipe.  I made a few tweaks:  I used fresh spinach rather than the frozen spinach.  I added a little diced red onion to the saute and some chili powder to the spinach and ricotta mixture.

Reminded me of the manicotti spinach recipe on this site, just looks like it is modified to a Mexican flavour. End meal does not match the picture with this recipe-I have a problem when people don't post what the actual food looks like when made as per recipe- on this photo clearly it was baked seamed up in this dish- the recipe clearly says seam down to bake...I also see more cheese then any enchilada sauce on it.... the corn tortilla simply don't hold properly for this recipe -NOTHING like the photo on this recipe! They fall apart when heated as they soak in the sauce and the ricotta filing-so basically you eat a mash of stuff .... will not make this recipe again-if I crave for spinach/ricotta filing-will make the manicotti recipe from this site instead.

I made the recipe but changed a few things as others did - used flour tortillas, used the green enchilada sauce and mixed salsa with the enchilada sauce.  It was delicious and even better the next few days!!!

I'm going to have to call this a major disappointment. I like all of the ingredients, but the finished product sure does nothing for me. 

I'm left with a lot of "maybes". Maybe if I had made a lot more mixture. Maybe if I had done something to add flavor to the mixture. Maybe if I'd used a lot more sauce. Maybe if I had used flour tortillas.

Unfortunately, I made it according to the directions.

While the dish was edible, it did not have a lot of flavor.   My description of the dish was that it just couldn't make up its mind whether it was Mexican or Italian.   I agree with other reviewer the only thing Mexican about it was the tortilla shells and the enchilada sauce.   I would not make this recipe again.

Delicious.  Whole family loved this.  Did use flour tortillas (personal preference) and added some spice, but again, personal preference.  This is creamy and delicious.  For all the people screaming about this not being authentic, its a recipe - not a national dish.  Take it for what it is.   A recipe.  If you made it and didn't like it, fine.  But don't judge it based on what you think it should be.

I made this b/c vegetarians were coming to dinner and I'm  better off gluten free - satisfied both!  I thought they were delicious!  I made exactly according to recipe except fried in coconut/olive oil mix.  I don't care if they qualify as Mexican, they were something I will definitely make again!

Had problems with this one.  Not that it did not taste good, it did, it is just that the tortillas fell apart.  Did not look as nice as the photo.  Likely I did something wrong, but it still taste great.

This was bland as is and I do not like the flavor of store bought enchilada sauce at all. But it has promise. I am going to work on adding spice and texture to the filling and make my own enchilada sauce next time.

This recipe exceeded my expectations. I followed the recipe, as written, except I substituted white onion for the green onion and flour tortilla for corn. This recipe is very versatile- the enchilada sauce really overpowers most of the flavors- so you can put almost anything inside with the cheese and it would taste good. This recipe was super quick to make, no mess, easy...and it tasted good! Will bring the leftovers to work for lunch tomorrow. The only problem is that with the exception of the spinach, this meal isn't very healthy; despite that, I will definitely make it again (maybe add mushrooms and other veggies on hand). Thank you. Edit: I made this a second time- I used scallions, but didn't notice a difference in taste from regular onion. This time came out a less moist than the first time. I think it was because I used a different enchilada sauce. I think the sauce really makes this recipe. Don't use it sparingly.

This recipe is easy to follow and works well.  I used about three large handfuls of fresh spinach.  I made my own enchilada sauce.  While I liked this, it was not my favorite and I think I would try it with cottage cheese in place of ricotta next time and cheddar in place of Monterey Jack.  I adore ricotta but don't think it belongs in Mexican food.

I changed it to suit my taste.  Used 1% cottage cheese and 0% fat plain Greek yogurt as substitutes.  Onion powder subbed due to laziness.  Added chopped green chilies.  Yummy. It was a great inspiration.  Thanks.

My family loved it. I've made few changes to the recipe. I added chopped jalapeños, taco seasoning, black beans, hot sauce and shredded pepper jack cheese instead of monterry jack cheese. It came out awesome!

This was really easy and tasty! There isn't enough spinach, though, so I added artichokes and tomatoes to my mixture. I also really like spicy, so I threw some green chilies in, too. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy, rich and creamy. I used extra cheese on the inside as original recipe came out a little runny. I also added about a quarter cup of jalapenos, and a little extra garlic. Other than those small changes, it is most definitely a keeper! Versatile recipe that was a crowd pleaser. More decadent than your average enchilada.

These were delicious and very simple. I added some jalapeno for some spice, but they still could have used a little more flavor.

I felt the filling would've been better suited for manicotti, instead of enchiladas. There was too much spinach, in my opinion, pretty overpowering.

This recipe was a hit. I did a few changes. I added sm. can of green chili's added about 1/2 teaspoon of each garlic powder, cumin, chili powder and just a dash of cayenne. For my cheeses I used cottage cheese, greek yogurt, and Colby jack.

This recipe  is very good, I made a few changes  by using 10 oz bag of fresh spinach, sauté in 2 tbs coconut oil, plenty of garlic and green onions 1/2 can of Ro Tel dice tomatoes w green chiles,  Sargentos shredded 4 cheese Mexican, flour shells instead of corn. With these changes it was very flavorful very delicious  even before adding the sour cream and ricotta cheese. The overall recipe  is amazing! Will definitely make it again soon

I made this recipe for my Spanish class. I needed a Mexican Vegetarian dish. This was perfect! The only change I'd make is to have a cream based sauce on top to match the creaminess of the inside. I'm looking forward to making this again!

Added a small can of green diced chilies, 2 tablespoons of Chimichurri, diced orange pepper, onion and 2 tablespoons of home made taco seasoning to the filling. Covered with enchilada sauce and cheddar after it started to bubble. SO GOOD!!!

Yummy!  I made some changes with the sauce.  Instead of using the enchilada sauce can, I made my own sauce.  I bought can crushed tomatoes, sauteed onions with olive oil, added the crushed tomatoes, let it cooked for a while.  Add fresh cilantro leaves and enjoy!  But other than that we loved them ;

My family and I decided we would go vegetarian for 30 days.  To my surprise my 10 year old and 8 year old boys want to do it all the time and only have meat on holidays (flexitarian).  I decided to try this recipe because it looked great and it was! Like many I seasoned the spinach with cumin and onion powder but, I also added adobo seasoning and turmeric...WONDERFUL.  Instead of using just spinach I decided to use fresh power greens (spinach, kale, bok choy).  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I love all of the ingredients included in this recipe, but I did not think it was very good. The flavor was just odd all-together. I think I didn't like the sauce I used - will try again with different sauce.

These were good but I can only give the recipe 4 stars as is.  Like other reviewers stated, the whole thing seemed pretty bland without some sort of seasoning.  I subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta and used light sour cream.  Non-fat, plain Greek yogurt would also work in place of the sour cream.  I sauteed the spinach with yellow onion and garlic and added in the last of my Penzey's bold taco seasoning.  Then I had a can of Ro-Tel that had been sitting in my pantry for a while so I drained off the juices in a colander and threw that into the filling as well.  Overall, the extra kick from the Ro-Tel and the taco seasoning really helped and the tomatoes in the filling were a nice addition.  This is a good base recipe but don't be afraid to play around with it!

I have been making this recipe for many years now. I like to do several things differently, however. First-use cream cheese, monterey jack, and less sour cream inside the enchiladas. Second, I think they are better with flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas. Lastly, I feel that they taste considerably better with about 30 minutes in the oven instead. In fact, sometimes it seems that these also taste better after they sit in the fridge overnight and are reheated-I feel as though the flavors are better dispersed at that point. It is accompanied well by Spanish rice and tortilla chips. But that's just my opinion! Keep trying it till you get what you like best.

These were excellent!  The only thing I did different was substituted the ricotta with cottage cheese and whipped in sour cream and some picante sauce (since I didn't have salsa) to the sauce before pouring over the enchiladas.  This is new favorite!

Delish!  Even my kids liked this!  I added thinly sliced zucchini and used fresh spinach; added plenty of spices as well.  I used corn tortillas...just throw one in the microwave for 10 seconds to soften, and it won't split as you roll.  Corn tortillas are usually about half the calories of flour, too.

Really delicious and filling! I made it a little healthier, as others have suggested, by using olive oil instead of butter and substituting low-fat cottage cheese for the ricotta. My bag of corn tortillas only had 8 of them, but the 1/4 per tortilla worked out perfectly. My tortillas were flexible enough that I didn't need to heat them, but use your best judgement. Will definitely repeat!

This is a good recipe but does need more seasoning than what is called for. Also, next time I make this I will finely chop the spinach. The stringy texture was a bit unappetizing.

Good, but needed some Mexican seasoning and a bit of a health make-over:
I omitted the butter and sour cream, used 1 c. mont-jack cheese rather than 2, added 1/2 t. cumin, 1/4 t. cayenne, and salt. Magnificent!

I have made this recipe several time for guests and it is a hit every time! The last time that I made it though, I substituted crumbled med-firm tofu for the ricotta cheese. It was fantastic! Also, I make the 10-minute enchilada sauce recipe from this website.

excellent with a few changes:
- used fresh spinach, not frozen
- added chopped tomatoes & chopped cilantro to top (under cheese)

I loved this. I made a few substitutions and added an ingredient. I used olive oil instead of butter and pepper jack cheese instead of monterey jack cheese. I also added a small can of diced jalapanoes. It didn't add that much heat to the dish, I'd recommend adding some hot sauce to the enchilada sauce.

The whole family loved this veggie variation to the meaty enchilada. I added some spices though (salt, pepper, garlic powder, red pepper flakes) and it was delicious! Thanks for sharing - will be making this again :-)

Very, very good! I followed the recipe exactly except when it came to the enchilada sauce. I didn't have a 19 oz. size can, only a 28 ouncer. After measuring out 16 oz. and pouring it on I decided that it looked like enough and judging by the finished product it was just right. Thanks for the post.

Altered this a bit, thus the 4 stars; end result was probably 4.5 stars.  My number one goal was to cut the fat + calories, while maintaining the flavor.  Added fresh spinach to saute of 4oz green chilies, 1/2 chopped mild jalapeno, 1 yellow onion (only 1/2 is needed) + 1/2 red bell. Seasoned w/sea salt + chili powder to taste.  Used light sour cream and substituted low fat cottage cheese for the ricotta.  End result was a little soupy, but I didn't measure the spinach so maybe I had extra sauce.  Not sure, but I ended up w/extra mixture when I finished stuffing the tortillas.  A slotted spoon removed enough of the add'l liquid for me.  It probably made the tortillas a little more mushy than is traditional, but nothing problematic, the flavors were fab and it was a hit.  One of the better enchilada recipes I've tried + one I will repeat.

The cheese filling was good, but a bit bland for my taste so I added some hatch green chilies before baking and that fixed the problem. My boys (2 & 4) loved these.

Super easy and fast. I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't like the canned sauce I used. I think I'll look up a homemade enchilada sauce recipe next time.

Everyone really liked this one, and although a little work intensive, it's not that hard to make. I was even able to make it here in Germany, despite often being unable to find the right ingredient for Mexican food. I made my own enchilada sauce to go with it, and it was easy and really good!

Easy to make! As suggested by other reviewers, the 10 Minute Enchilada Sauce recipe makes this dish very Tex-Mex tasty. I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream & I was short on ricotta so I added a little cottage cheese too. This is a superb vegetarian entree for non-vegetarian adults who like plenty of vegetables in their diet.

I had hope that these would be really tasty, but they were very bland.  I doubt I will try them again, but to those who plan on making this, think about adding some spices and such.

I looked for this recipe because I had it in a restaurant and wanted to make it for guests.  I added about 6 white mushrooms and sauted them with the butter and onions.  I also used a green verde sauce in place the the enchilada sauce.

Next time I will use a better quality tortilla or a larger size.  This was much better than the restaurant version and easy to make.

Very tasty! Good base to go from.  I used flour tortillas my own personal preference, and added a bell pepper into the spinach mixture like others had mentioned.  Then used a rotisserie chicken and shredded it for those I did not keep vegetarian.  Oh and mixed 2 diffferent kinds of cheeses not just monterey jack but a taco mix with seasoning that Kraft has...and added some spices to the mixture before rolling chili powder and cumin, and the same spices to the top of the enchiladas after putting on the cheese... I ended up baking it covered for 20 then uncovered for 15 to make sure bc of the chicken it was warmed through.  And I put down a layer of enchilada sauce mixed with salsa verde before putting down the rolled enchiladas.  Just thought I'd share those details in case but it is a good base recipe :)

I made this two days ago and loved it. The only things I did differently were used fresh spinach, whole wheat tortillas, spread refried beans on the tortillas before adding the spinach mixture, and added a can of crushed pineapple for the spinach mixture. They were delicious, and even better the next day!

Good recipe with some adjustments.  I subbed fresh spinach for frozen and added a bell pepper to the skillet with the garlic (twice the garlic) and green onion.  Even with adding the Cumin, Parsley, Cayenne Pepper and Chili Powder that another reviewer recommended, it was missing something.  A lot of flavor but I think next time I'll be more liberal with the spices and use the Hot Enchilada Sauce instead of Mild.  Great start though :)

These were pretty good. However, there was a lot of spinach. I had to add a few spices to the spinach mixture to make it more flavorful, but other than that, it was a good dish.

Very tasty! I made mostly as is except I added a bit more zip by chopping up a chipotle pepper and mixing it in with the spinach with a little adobo sauce. I also baked like a casserole with layers of tortillas in order to save time. Next time I might put in a little more spinach just to thicken things up a bit, especially if I make it in casserole form again.

I am also rating this recipe with my changes included.  I pretty much copied another member since I agreed the base recipe looks like it will be pretty bland and we are like kicked up food. So i followed this recipe from another reviewer - sautéed one diced poblano, half of a jalapeno, half of a red bell pepper, three cloves of garlic, one yellow onion, and one 4oz can of green chilies to add to spinach mixture- I also doubled the spinach.  It was very good!

Fantastic! Such a nice change. Jeff loves this! I used low carb tortillas and the texture is super.

Oh yum, these were fantastic and so easy to put together! I used Watties arribiata chunky spicy pepper sauce instead of enchilada sauce and this provided a nice spicy kick to counteract the smoothness of the spinach mixture.

This was real good! My only complaint was my hubby thought it could use some chicken in it. I thought it was good as is...but the filling could have used a little more substance. I made exactly as the recipe stated except I used tomato & basil tortilla's & I made the creamy garlic sauce to top it. I did 2 tbsp butter 4 cloves garlic, 2 tbsp flour until it was thick then added milk as needed to thin it out. It was delicious!!! Next time I will add some chicken as well.

This is favorite that my household cooks time and time again. The ricotta cheese really is a great and low fat option here. Over time we have catered the recipe to suit are needs and have made a couple of modifications. I had olive oil w/less better. I add a jalepeno. I add bok choy- it mixes with the spinache and you can't really taste it- it is so good for you. Other than that- the recipe is so delicious.

Tasty for sure.  But next time I think I'll try adding some more vegetables in the enchilada.  Felt like it was missing something more to sink my teeth into.  Maybe some zucchini?  Baked tofu?  Also, the canned enchilada sauce left much to be desired.  I'll make this again but tweaked a bit.

AS is the recipe is a 2-3 star but if I tweak it then it is a 4-5 star. I add saute onion, 2 packages of spinach LOTS of spices, 4 cloves garlic and 2 chopped Jalapeno peppers. I also use tofutti sour cream to reduce the fat content. Oh I also add a can of organic spicy black beans. Serve with homemade Margaritas! SO very filling you don't need any side. Update** made my own enchilada sauce from this site and it was amazing!!!! Way better than the can and so easy!

Yummy! The ricotta made the filling so creamy and wonderful. I added some chopped jalapenos and some cayenne pepper to spice it up. I, also, added a Laughing Cow Garlic and Herb wedge to the mix for more depth of flavor. Definitely will make again!

These are very decent-tasting enchiladas.  And for a vegetarian option, they are great.  I doubt that I will make them on a consistant basis, but they were good to try.

These were SO good!!!!  I followed the suggestions about adding seasonings to the filling so I decieded to add cajun seasoning to the filling.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of the montery because that's what I had. And I uped the cheddar to 2 cups in the filling. I also used jalopeno cheddar wraps, and personally I think they made these. These are a definitely a keeper!

this is a really delicious recipe, and even easier than it looks!  I gave 4 stars because I did add to the filling to increase the flavor as some other reviewers suggested. I added about 1/2 a medium yellow onion to the saute, and approx. doubled the garlic. I also used whole wheat flour tortillas because I prefer them over corn tortillas.  The result was fantastic and even my husband who typically shows no interest in vegetarian dishes also loved it and ate up the leftovers the next day.   I used a bottled enchilada sauce from trader joes which was really good - i would recommend a "nicer" commercial sauce like this or to make your own. The grocery store can stuff would definitely affect the taste! My other changes for next time will be to add some chopped peppers to the saute b/c we love peppers; and to double the recipe so we can freeze some to have on hand!

I think next time I will be adding some spices, salt and pepper, that sort of thing. I will also only use 1 clove garlic, 2 was definitely too much for me. I substituted sharp chedder for monterey jack, but other than that it was a good recipe.

This was pretty good. Followed directions pretty much to the letter. Probably would use a spicier enchilada sauce next time.  Something more flavorful. Just seemed to be missing something.

These were super yummy! I made the original recipe for me(the vegetarian), and added chicken to the rest. A few differences...I put green sauce on top of mine. I also added a tub of Philly Chive&Onion cream cheese to the mix...Some other things I added...cayenne, italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder...the original seemed a little dry. I also used both corn tortillas and Central Market's Southwestern flour tortillas(they are orange) Everyone seemed to like the flour enchiladas better...All in all though, awesome, easy recipe! Thanks:) oh, one more thing..i used one sweet onion, instead of green onions

This was really good, and very simple to make.  I made it exactly to the recipe only I added about a teaspoon of Ancho Chile Pepper and I had to use Flour tortillas because the commissary here was all out of corn.  The filling was amazing and I think it would also taste great in a pasta shell with marinara sause.  My husband loved it, gave it 4 1/2 stars b/c they were flour tortillas and not the corn (tough man to please)

My boyfriend devoured these!  I used fresh spinach, more garlic than called for, and topped it with the Tomatillo Salsa Verde recipe from this site rather than the canned enchilada sauce.  Because I had trouble with the corn tortillas, I used the casserole method and it came out perfect!  Will be making again (and again...)

LOVE this recipe.  I have made it a number of times.  I sub cottage cheese, blended in a food processor, for the ricotta.  I have even used tofu instead of the ricotta - can't tell the difference. I also skip the butter and cut the cheese - use about 3/4 cup inside and 1/2 cup on top.  Still AMAZINGly good and lower cal.

Great! I added corn and black beans to give it a little but more dimension; it otherwise may have been a little bland. I also added chili pepper flakes.

This was a nice change from the normal enchilada. I took a hint from a few other reviewers and added a can of drained green chilies to the filling mixture, I think it helped break the creamy richness of the ricotta a little. This really reminded me of spinach dip more than anything but with enchilada sauce all over it.

These were fantastic and the recipe is so versatile - for example, I have emptied my fridge and added red bell peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, etc - healthy and delicious! In addition to adding more vegetables, I also added cumin, chili powder, and paprika to the vegetable cheese mixture - it really kicks up the flavor! These were so popular at a recent dinner party that two of my guest went home and made them the next evening!

The filling of the enchilada was very good. You could definitely add to it without the filling being too overwhelming. I would suggest sticking with the corn tortilla suggestions (flour wasn't that great) and DEFINITELY make your own enchilada sauce (or, if you know a good canned brand use that). The enchilada sauce I used was gross and almost ruined the meal for me.

this was a good recipe. i used less spinach and added some shredded chicken to the recipe, but it was still a bit too much spinach for me and my hubby. for the chicken, i just used a boneless, skinless breast and used a recipe from this site (blackened chicken). i also used hot enchilada sauce and shredded pepper jack instead of montery jack because we like it spicy. will definately make again, but will use less spinach.

I really enjoyed this. I added the seasonings like others recommended and I am glad I did. I feel like it need something more or something added but can't put my finger on it. I used a Green Chili Enchilada sauce, maybe that was the missing thing. I just like whiter sauces with spinach. Maybe I will try red next time. I did use lower cal ingredients on the dairy and used low carb tortillas. I don't usually like Mexican style food but this was very good and easy to make. OH, my husband says to add crab to it next time. :)

These were great!! Like others, I used low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta, just to be healthier. Very easy!! Had them with low fat refried beans and a salad.

Really easy recipe and tasted pretty good, but something was missing. I couldn't put my finger on it. Maybe it needed a little more salt, meat or something that had some texture.

I made the recipe as stated, but it just wasn't interesting, authentic, or even very tasty. Just a cheese vehicle. Seems like a recipe from the back of a box.

Good but needed more flavor in the filling and cheese on top.  Next time I'll try another reviewers suggestion of a creamy garlic white sauce.

Very tasty, easy and different.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with the garlic and onion.  Used whole wheat tortilla and salsa instead of enchilida sause since.  Will make again.

Not bad, added spices as others suggested. I think next time I will add shredded chicken. If felt like it was missing something. I don't like canned enchilada sauce. We made our own dryed red Chilis we brought back from NM. Mmmm...so good

VERY easy, very satisfing.  Only used 1/2 the ricotta, and it was fine.  Spiced it up with some roasted red peppers, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and cumin.  Spicy cheese on top.  Delicious.  Will make again.  I'm a mexican food lover, and sometimes it's hard to create at home.  Thanks.

Very yummy.  I processed the sweet onion and garlic with a can of chopped green chiles to add some spice and keep the texture smooth.  Also used two large cans of the red enchilada sauce.  I split the recipe into two casseroles and cooked one and froze the other for another night.  Will definitely make again!!

I have made this twice.  For the "as written" recipe, I give it a 4. However, when I made it a second time I spiced it up with more garlic, lots of chipotle cayenne, oregano and a dash of chili powder.  I added all of those to onion when it was sauting.  Very, very good and I will make this revised recipe again.

This tasted really good, but I found the combination of the Mexican dish strange with the spinach filling.  The filling is more suited to a stuffed pasta type dish in my opinion.  That is not to say I won't eat all the leftovers.  It was good!

Very good.  I agree with many of the comments below.  Add spices to the mix!    Also, maybe it was just me, but there didn't seem to be much filling.  I would probably double the part of the recipe for the filling.

A good dish, perhaps a little bland.  Next time I think I'll throw in some roasted chili peppers and maybe some pepper-jack cheese.  Pretty good though.

I don't understand the use of ricotta in this recipe. That's not a mexican cheese (not even Tex-Mex!). I suppose it might have been good but I didn't want to take the chance. I had a good jalepeno cheese and made creamed spinach with this. Added jalepenos and cilantro and lots of broiled mushrooms and mashed black and pinto beans. Topped with a homemade enchilada sauce from my sister-in-law. Yummy!

This is a great recipe.  Everyone in my family loves these enchiladas.  The only thing I changed was that I used flour tortillas instead of corn.  Delicious!

We usually have these enchiladas at a local restaurant.  Because of the economy, we wanted to try them at home.  Well, this recipe is really GOOD.  I served them with some of the left over sour cream and chopped up some tomatoes, onions, garlic and one jalepeno and a squeeze of lime juice.  As well as the mexican rice that I got the recipe for.  We loved ALL of it!

These just weren't really my taste, they were good but a little too creamy for me, I think I would have liked them better with more vegetables...maybe some red pepper and zucchini to add a little more texture.  I did use non fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta and fat free sour cream to lighten them up a bit and that worked just fine.  The flavor was good it was the texture I didn’t care for.

I thought this was pretty tasty.  I added shrimp, used 1/2 c of the ricotta cheese and used green chile enchilda sauce.  Next time I make it I will make a sour cream sauce and use that as the topping.

WonderfuL! My husband made 'yummy noises' and that hardly ever happens! Definitely add spices to spinach mixture (cumin, chili/garlic/onion powder) I didn't use cottageC as i was going to, turned out expired but I will try that next time. I used a small amount of thinly sliced yellow onion instead of green was totally fine.

This was a hit with my family. I used a chopped vidella onion in lieu of green, more spinach than called for. Also used part skim ricotta and the whole 15 oz. container, only enough sour cream to give a moist consistancy. I also added extra spices as everyone else. I think next time I'll add some mushrooms and maybe even some red bell peppers. You could doctor this up with just about anything you desire. The canned red sauce was fine for us. Will make again for sure, thanks for the recipe.

These were pretty good, but we used a green chile sauce instead of a traditional enchilada sauce.  There is some magic when green chile meets certain cheeses. Nice recipe, way to go.

I made the following changes to this recipe:

Used 1 large bag fresh spinach, chopped.  After the spinach was almost wilted, I added 1/2 block of browned, crumbled tofu (to prepare the tofu: squeeze excess water out, crumble it, & dry fry it in a skillet until browned.

I make my own enchilada red sauce, which I think MUST be better than canned enchilada sauce, but yet I have never tried a canned sauce; maybe there are good ones out there.

Instead of rolling individual enchiladas, I layer (in a 9 X 13 pan), 1. red sauce, 2. 4 or 5 corn tortillas, 3. spinach/tofu/ricotta/sour cream mixture, 4. jack cheese, repeat one more time, finishing with the red sauce and sprinkling the top with jack cheese.

That seems less time consuming, but then I guess I add time by dealing with fresh spinach rather than frozen, and making my own enchilada sauce.  Oh well...it's worth it!

These tasted good, but I think I agree with the others who said to make the enchilada sauce instead of using the ready-made stuff. I used the RM, and I wouldn't do that next time. I took others suggestions, and seasoned the ricotta/sour cream. Because of this, I mixed the ricotta, sour cream and Jack (I used pepper jack) cheeses together. After cooking the onions/garlic/spinach, I added them to the bowl of cheeses/sour cream (instead of everything in the pan). Then, I used the veggie pan to warm the corn tort. before filling and rolling (I wouldn't try to do the corn tort. without warming). One pan, one bowl - have to love that! I will try this again for sure.

This was a great Recipe. I added mushrooms, cilantro white and red pepper to the filling, and used a green sauce instead of red (I prefer green and white sauces with vegetables and chicken, red sauces for pork and beef)for the topping. I made this for friends of mine who are vegetarian, and they loved it.

Amazing. The best enchiladas I have ever had. Anywhere. I made some changes to spice it up a bit. I added chopped jalapeño, green chilies (both from a can), and shrimp. I didn't have ricotta or sour cream so I used cream cheese.

Vegan Alternative:  Instead of the butter, sour cream, ricotta and monterey jack cheese, substitute 1 box refrigerated silken tofu.  Make sure the tortillas you buy (or make) are vegan.  Then just follow the directions.

I've made this both according to the directions and the above and I can't personally tell the difference...both taste great  This vegan alternative is definitely healthier.  You can use red and green enchilada sauce to make it more colorful.

Btw, if you are use to spicy mexican food it would be a good idea to spice this up quite a bit compared to the directions...otherwise it will taste bland.

If it's Saturday night, it must be a vegetarian meal!  This recipe was fabulous.  I used whole wheat tortillas, light sour cream, and part-skim ricotta to keep it more healthy.  But the devil in me put a handful of shredded mozarella cheese on top in addition to the shredded monterary jack.  Tsk Tsk.  Hubby LOVED it and can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.  I think this one would freeze real well too.

We loved this recipe.  I did add some chopped up chicken that I "nuked" in the microwave.  I love the flavor of the filling.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 flour tortillas for this recipe.  I used the Texas Enchilada Sauce from this site and I poured it all on the pan because my boyfriend wanted it covered.  Next time though I may just pour some of the sauce on and just serve the rest on the side.  I absolutely loved the taste of the filling of these.

Very, very good! My boyfriend and his 10 yr old son loved it and had seconds. I used regular minced onion instead, doubled the minced garlic, and added a little bit of minced canned jalapenos. (I like my food spicy!) I dipped the corn tortilla in a little bit of enchilada sauce before I added the filling. I also used low fat ricotta, sour cream, and mexican blend cheese. Helps cut the fat a little. I served them with the no-fry refried bean recipe found here, chips and salsa, and of course, Pacificos! It was a good (relatively healthy!) Mexican feast.

This was fabulous! I used low carb whole wheat flour tortillas (because that's what I had on hand) and a bag of fresh spinach. Hubby  and the kids gobbled it up! A definite keeper.

A great base for veggie enchiladas. I added mushrooms & artichoke hearts to the filling, as well as some salt & pepper. Then I topped with green enchilada sauce mixed with a little sour cream (in lieu of the regular enchilada sauce).

The corn tortillas cracked after I rolled them, but once the sauce and cheese were on and baked, no one noticed. A nice, original,easy recipe my family enjoyed.

I liked this. Easy to make! I do agree with the other reviewers who say it could use some spices though. I'll try adding some of those extra ingredients next time. Perhaps some onions in the spinach mixture, too?

This was a quick, easy delicious meal! I used 1 cup of monteray jack and 1 cup of sharp cheddar to add some extra flavor. I also used the 10 minute enchilada sauce recipe instead of canned sauce. We also used flour tortillas instead of corn (personal preference). Tasted great! Even good reheated!

Very good and simple to make.  I had a vegetarian coming to my party and these were perfect for her - she even took the leftovers home.  I did make the enchiladas with small curd cottage cheese instead of ricotta and they turned out great.  I also made them the night before my party and then baked them the next afternoon - came out really good!  The only reason that I did not rate them 5 stars is that even though they were good and simple, they weren't outrageous and a must have recipe.

This was a delightful dish.  I've made it twice...the first time I followed the recipe exactly - it was good, but kind of bland.  So, the second time I added a little red pepper to the mixture and used a hotter enchilada sauce...it was very good.  I will make these again.  They were a big hit with the family and the recipe is flexible.

Very tasty and easy. I'm sure it's me but I can never roll up corn tortillas gracefully - they tend to break, regardless of how much I hear them first. I'll make this again, using more flavorful cheese and seasonings, but definitely delicious as-is.

I added 1 medium onion first and sauteed that before adding the garlic and green onions which just added a little bulk to the filling.  I also used low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta and low fat sour cream to lower the caloric impact a bit.  Final adjustment was we used red enchilada sauce because we couldn't find green.  Overall very yummy!

I made my own enchilada sauce. I added a teaspoon of cornstarch stirred and dissolved in a quarter cup of water to a half jar of salsa. I heated it up to thicken it and then poured it over the enchiladas before I baked them. It was delicious. This turned out to be comfort food.

I have added red or yellow onion and 2 fresh charred pablano peppers skins removed and I did not put cheese inside of the enchiladas but only about 1/2 the amount called for on top.  I used green La Victoria enchilada sauce about 25 ounces per recipe.   yum!

I made it without onions, but they may have add some good flavor. In the future, I think I may opt for some more seasoning to give it more flavor.

Easy and tasty as is. Next time, I might use fewer tortillas and fill each one more or make more filling, as they seemed a little empty.

I made this recipe exactly as written. It was terrible. I usually like anything with spinach and ricotta cheese, but this was awful. Very bland with no flavour and the texture of the corn tortillas was nauseating. I thought  I've never been more disappointed in a recipe.

An odd combination in my opinion, and it turned it quite bland - despite all the cheese.

This recipe was pretty bland. It's good fresh out of the oven but not so great as leftovers as the lack of flavor is accentuated. I should have added some of the spices suggested by other reviewers.

Pretty good; simple and easy to make recipe! If you're a slow cook like me though, it may take you closer to about an hour than a half hour to make. Serving size is accurate; makes 8. I used salsa verde because I don't like enchilada sauce and it tastes just as good.

I added salt and pepper to make it have a taste, other than spinach. I would definitely make it again.


P.S. It's amazing, after a day or two or a week in the refrigerator. And get spicy enchilada sauce. And soak in the sauce so it's not dry.

Its good on its own, but feels like its missing something.  Salt is one thing, maybe a Mexican Blanco queso. Cumin added and releno pepper stays on the lips nicely.

We're sitting down withe these beautiful piping-hot enchiladas, and the verdict is... 

Yum! Very creamy. If we make it again, we might go lighter on the ricotta. Goes great with black beans.

These are really good and simple to make. I prefer reasonably spicy foods, so as suggested by some other reviewers I did add some green chiles and a few other spices (such as garlic salt and onion flakes). Recommended.

My husband loved it. The sauce was a "medium" in heat and a little spicy for my taste but otherwise it was great! I will make it again with a different sauce and taco meat and beans for a change.

Mine turned out too runny and basically very bland following the recipe so the second batch I added pinto beans with jalapenos and black beans. I also added more spices ie cumin, Mexican oregano, cayenne pepper and chili powder and used my own enchilada sauce recipe added more cheese than called for and used corn tortillas. These were a lot better and not so runny but still just missing something

I made it exactly as stated. Very good. Fussy wife really liked it too. I might use half amount of sour cream next time. Filling was a tad runny, but delicious nonetheless! Definitely going to make it again.

I made this with just few changes.  I did not use enchilada sauce but instead used a white sauce I made earlier in week.  After making the base, adding the spinach and cheeses, I tasted it and it was very bland.  I added chili power, garlic salt, taco seasoning, salt, pepper and still very bland.  Luckily, my husband will eat anything I make :)

I found it to be kind of tasteless. I didn't change  the recipe at all and the filling didn't have any flavor. I also wasn't crazy about the enchilada sauce I used -- it was the only brand I could find. My husband liked it more than I did, so he'll  finish it up. Very disappointing, because it was simple enough to make. I doubt I'll make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was tasty, but nothing like the photo.  Too dry, needed more flavor.  Needed more cheese inside, and more sauce.  I won't make it again because I bet I can find a better recipe elsewhere.

I doubled the recipe, and there was more than enough to feed my children’s choir after rehearsal. The children loved it and wants me to make it “all the time.”  I did add chicken! My babies love ??!

My family LOVED this dish. I must admit that I made the mistake of putting all of the Monterrey Jack in the mixture. Thank goodness, I happened to have some extra to sprinkle on top. It is also good as a leftover.

I too made a few changes based on reviews.   I don't measure but will try and approximate here.  I sauteed in olive oil 1 large red onion, roughly 4 tablespoons chopped garlic, 1 large red pepper diced and about 1 cup small chopped cauliflower.  Once started browning I added 1 package drained defrosted spinach, cumin, red pepper flakes and chili powder to taste and loads of chopped tomato from the garden.  I added 1 cup light sour cream, 2 cups light ricotta and 2 cups shredded queso cheese.  This made enough filling for 14 corn tortillas. I used one 9x13 baking pyrex and one by 9x9. topped all w/enchilada sauce,  24 oz and 2 more cups shredded queso cheese over both and then baked as directed.

I decided to make my dish into an enchilada casserole instead of individual rolled enchiladas. I also used fresh steamed spinach instead of frozen . This dish is very good and so easy to put together. I will definitely be making it again!!

I made this recipe with just one change.  I added chicken and found the taste was very bland.  It either needs more spices or a different cheese (maybe feta). The enchilada sauce, I felt, did not go together well.  It needs another type of sauce.  If anyone has any suggestions, please share.

amazingly easy and quick.  Added  fresh tomatoes to the mix as our garden is overflowing.  I added extra spices as others suggested, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I made a double batch and will freeze one.

I added the recommended spices and wanted to use Mexican cheese blend but I only had cheddar so that's what I used.  These turned out wonderful and I'll definitely be making these again (with Mexican cheese blend)!

Could've used a touch of salt, but these turned out pretty good: added chicken, and some chopped tomatoes on top with the sauce.

I think they meant use a can of green chili enchilada sauce because the photo clearly shows no signs of red sauce. We went ahead and made it with red sauce because that's what we had, and it was delicious. Next time will try green  chili enchilada sauce though.

Very flavorful. I used peperjack instead of plain jack cheese and added shredded chicken. I also used flour tortillas since that is what I had on hand, and it turned out fine.

The enchilada sauce was not specified as red or green, so I used the green one for this dish.

Made changes , but these were so good. Added a bit of chopped chicken & lightened up on the cheeses some. What put these over the top though was homemade enchilada sauce, didn’t have any on hand. Never had to make enchilada sauce but these were the dinner plan & skipping sauce wasn’t going to work.  Used recipe from Skinnytaste Gina homolka book.  Wow, yeah worth the extra pan & trouble.

This was better than expected!  I did make minor changes. I used 12oz. Pkg of frozen spinach PLUS 4 to 5 oz of fresh spinach I wanted to use up. I wilted it in the microwave before tearing it up and squeezing it with other. (I’m thinking this recipe could be made with all fresh spinach if desired).  I added spices mentioned in the video. I did not warm tortillas before filling. Mine were very fresh and flexible. I used two 10 oz cans of Old El Paso mild green enchilada sauce (the little extra was perfect). I used shredded Mexican Style Cheese since that’s what I had.  Delicious!

I added cilantro, green chili peppers, and cumin. Used fresh spinach and a couple of fresh jalepenos. This was fantastic! Next time, I think I will try green sauce, though it was delicious as it was with red.

Simple and tasty.  Everybody's got a frozen "block " of spinach.  Everybody's got cheese. Add a couple of ingredients ,some rice and a side salad and everybody's got  a quick, simple meal.  Following suggestions, I made the 10 minute Enchilada sauce recipe to use. It was great spooned over the rice, too. Also as advised, I added cumin, garlic, chilli powder  and cayenne to spice up the filling.

I was looking for some vegetarian recipes and I am glad I found this one! I made the recipe as written, plus 2 extra ounces of spinach (I couldn't find a 10oz package). I used red enchilada sauce because that is what I usually have on veggie enchiladas. They turned out perfect and will be making them again.

Added thinly sliced yellow squash and sliced portobello mushrooms to the saute. Also, used fresh spinach, rather than frozen. This recipe is bomb. Next time, I'll add corn and black beans, too, and cut the cheeses a tiny bit. It's relish, but I can make it more veggie and less fatty. Try it!

I LOVE this recipe so much we made it again a couple days later. I’ve made it a few times now. This last time, I didn’t think we had enough sauce, so I added a small drained can of diced green chilies to the filling. We did end up having enough sauce, but my husband loved the added chilies. We usually add some shredded chicken to the filing as well. Whatever we do to it though, as long as we use this recipe as the foundation, it turns out WONDERFUL! These are the best enchiladas I’ve ever had (but don’t tell my mother) :D

I did do some minor adjustments on this recipe, so bear that in mind with the rating. I lightly fried the corn tortillas in canola oil, because I have found if you don't, they just come out mushy  in casseroles or as enchiladas. I also used green enchilada sauce, since the recipe did not specify which kind to use, and I thought the green would enhance the vegetables in the enchiladas. For depth, I added some cumin and Mexican oregano, and found I had to double the ricotta (obviously, I don't care about calories), to make enough mixture to fill ten tortillas (one package). I liked them, but my family didn't. They did say they'd like them better with cooked, shredded chicken inside, and as others have mentioned, I think this would be a great variation. Will try it again with chicken, but would eat it myself with the minor adjustments I made. Tasty starter recipe, with lots of room for customizing.  Thank you!

This so delicious! I was very suspect as I was making it though. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and I added some chopped red bell pepper and one jalapeño because they needed to be consumed. I used part skim ricotta and light sour cream. Once the filling was all mixed up it was just so runny and it seemed like there was so much spinach. It over powered all the other ingredients. As I rolled up each tortilla the filling  Squeezed out all over the place. I poured half the enchilada sauce in the bottom of the baking dish and placed the enchiladas on top of that. As I was pouring the remaining sauce it seemed like too much sauce so I used half of the remaining sauce. Everything looked soupy. I was already disappointed but I figured instead of enchiladas it would be spinach and cheese enchilada casserole. I put the cheese on top with a bit extra because we love cheese. I cooked it with tin foil on top at the required temp for the required time. It turned out so good! I actually realized I could use all of the enchilada sauce and the cooking solidified all the innards and I don’t know how but the spinach was far from overwhelming. There are so many possibilities with ingredients being added to the filling. Hubby suggested mushrooms and green chilis next time. Don’t be intimidated while making this because it doesn’t look right. The end result is so much better than it looks!

I liked this recipe, but I agree that you should expand on this dish because as is, it's not a strong flavored dish.   It tasted more along the lines of manicotti with enchilada sauce and tortillas.

This was the first time I've made enchiladas, and they were absolutely delicious.  Fantastic and easy recipe.  The only changes I made:  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and I omitted the onion (I can't stand onions).  I'll definitely be coming back to this recipe in the future.

This is the best enchilada recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added about 1/4 tsp of cumin and chili powder to the mixture along with a shredded chicken breast and I used fresh spinach.  A bit less green enchilada sauce was a good idea.  This recipe is delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

This was SOOO good!  I used raw spinach and cooked it down with the garlic and onion. Next time, I would cook the spinach separately and drain it, then add to the garlic and onion.  Cooking them together made it a little too watery (my bad).  I didn't have Monterrey Jack cheese, so i used pepper jack instead.  It was a great substitution.  Added so much flavor!  I followed the rest of the recipe as is.  Yum!!!

Substitued light products where I could. Still awesome! Used light Alfredo sauce instead of enchilada sauce. Still awesome. One note though use all the green onion that the recipe calls for they add a lot to the taste.

Delicious!  Very filling and easy to make. Added cayenne pepper to mix because I like spicy.

The enchilada sauce I used was a can of condensed soup and jar of salsa.  
I think some artichoke hearts may be good added to the recipe. Maybe mushroom too

Like all are reviews, I added my favorite combo of spices to the spinach for flavor.  I used 2% cottage cheese and sharp cheddar which is what I had on hand.  Used red enchilada sauce and flour tortillas; accompanied with an avocado salad and it was a perfect meal.

I first was interested to try this recipe because I wanted to cook something on the healthy side so the spinach caught my eye.   I was disappointed when the filling was mostly cheese and sour cream.  I felt nearly sick after eating them due to all the cheese.  Next time I will make my own spinach enchilada recipe.

I swapped out corn tortillas for flour, and tossed in a pack of bacon. Overall, great recipe, but I just love enchiladas.

There has been some critique of this recipe who want Mexican instead of Italian. It’s a friggin’ recipe! Do what you want from it! Also, when folks publish their ‘additions’, it no longer becomes the original recipe. How about writing a new or original recipe? Take ownership instead of criticizing.

I took the advice of another reviewer and added red peppers, a jalapeño, a green pepper, cumin, hot chili powder, salt and pepper, and green chilies to the cheese and spinach mixture. I didn't have motery jack so I used mozzarella and an Italian blend cheese. These turned out awesome!! I think they would be bland made as is though.

I made this but made a sauce with roux and chicken broth.  And added a new product I found called "guacamole salsa".  Always use the corn tortillas too. Thanks.

I like this recipe because it's so simple. Instead of frozen spinach, I sautéed 2 bags of baby spinach. I would heat up the tortillas a little longer to give it a crunch, or maybe broil a couple of minutes after they bake. I would also add more spices to give it flavor, maybe a little hot sauce.

The first time I made these they were not very good. I don't know what I did wrong. But tonight they were bangin'! I followed the recipe closely with the following changes:
1. Used flour tortillas
2. Used a 12 oz. package of frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed to remove most water.
3. Used 1cup cottage cheese, smoothed in a blender to replace ricotta.
4. Added a few shakes of chili powder to the spinach mix.

Completed filling and baking as instructed, omiting extra cheese
on top.
These were great and I will definitely make again

I made this and they were the best. The only thing I did different was I added refried beans to the corn tortilla before adding mixture. Gave off a better Mexican taste.

I loved the recipe!!! I made half of the recipe for 5 tortilla shells (small size) and added about 100g of shredded cooked chicken breast to the spinach and ricotta mix. Love it!!! Next time will try to have more filling and less shells (i.e. will make 4 tortillas). Oh, and I did add sauce, I like it without!

My spinach-hating husband LOVED this! Changes I made were I added 1/4 tsp cumin, garlic salt and onion powder along with 1/8 tsp black pepper to the spinach and onion frying in the pan. Made the dish up one day expecting to eat it and something came up so it sat in the refrigerator 3 days before we had this! I took out of refrigerator and let it come to room temp, baked it and turned out great! Will definitely make again.

Good vegetarian enchiladas recipe. I did not add cheese to the filling, I used fresh spinach and fresh pepper from my farmers market, the flavor was awesome. I will double the amount of Spinach and use less ricotta for the next time. It was too rich for me.

Very good, easy recipe.  Only minor changes - I used fresh spinach because I had it and needed to use it, and I used flour tortillas instead of corn.  The recipe didn't specify red or green enchilada sauce, but spinach enchiladas and green chili sauce go together like peas and carrots.  

I WILL make this again, and try a few other variations.  I can see this being added to our menu rotation list as a regular - everyone loved it!

Definitely a keeper. We prefer cream sauces with spinach, so I replaced the enchilada sauce with a couple cans of Campbell's Cream of Celery Soup. I used 2 cans of soup and one can of milk, and the consistency and taste were great.

When I first saw this recipe, I debated as to whether I should try it as the ingredients seemed a little bland, but the suggestion of adding cumin and onion powder was a great idea.  Also, adding sour cream to the ricotta made the filling nice and creamy instead of dry and lumpy as ricotta cheese can become when cooked.  Our family does not like spicy food, and I accidently bought "hot" enchilada sauce, but they loved them any way and even had seconds!  I'm definitely going to make these again (only I'll use mild enchilada sauce the next time).

Really easy to make! I substituted ricotta for cream cheese though. I also put in carrots, tex mex cheese, and corn, and served it over basmati rice. I didn't do the enchilada sauce either. It turned out great.

This is a very good recipe to have on file. I did change a couple of things. I added some cumin and chili powder to the filling and I did use fresh spinach instead of frozen. I used green enchilada sauce instead of red the first time I made it.  The next time I used the red and I and my family prefer the green.  I also tried adding chopped up chicken I had poached and it was really good.

This recipe was simple and delicious. Will make it again. I did add more seasoning to the filling. Cumin, garlic salt and chili powder. For my one vegetarian in the family I did not add other protein but for the rest of us I used a rotisserie chicken from the store. Made plenty and liked by all.

I will definitely make this again! I did make some changes. I roasted some chicken and sliced very thin to place on the spinach mixture before rolling. I also used cottage cheese in place of ricotta. I made a double batch and I'm so glad I did. The whole family is looking forward to leftovers.

LOVED IT!!! I made it for friends who helped me out and they loved it also. I personally will spice it up next time only because I'm a hot-n-spicy kind of chick but the recipe was very good.

Everyone in the family really liked it so I'm giving it 4 stars, but I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone who is looking for authentic Mexican food.  It is cheesy yummy goodness and works for me as I'm gluten free so, all in all I will definitely make it again.

Our family doesn't like canned enchilada sauce so we made a white sauce with Mexican seasonings. Also added some leftover grilled chicken on top of the spinach mixture before rolling up.  Turned out great!  This is a definite do over.

I thought I had all the ingredients the found my ricotta was outdated. So I used a 4 cheese mixture (2 cups) instead with a mexican flair and used green chili enchilada sauce to top it off. I think it turned out pretty well.

I made several changes only because I didn't have all the ingredients called for.  I had only half bag of spinach so I added mushrooms,  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and no sour cream.  I used green enchilada sauce.  I used a large can, and I think it needed every bit of the sauce.  It was delicious.

Was delicious. I used Kale instead of spinach plus added a little cumin and coriander to give this a more Mexican flavor. I dredged the corn tortillas in enchilada sauce before stuffing.  The only draw back was they  fell a part when served. A good idea for vegetarian dinner.

This dish was fantastic! I have never made spinach enchiladas, much less a vegetarian one! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the tortillas, I got the corn/flour mix tortillas.  These tortillas didn't need to be warmed, they were easy to put the spinach mix in it and fold. I also used medium heat enchilada sauce, the hubby said it was better than restaurant dish! I will make this, a lot!!

I added 8 ounces of chopped mushrooms, 1/2 a chopped red pepper and a small can of chopped chilies. I skipped the enchiladas sauce. This recipe came very close to the spinach enchiladas dish that my wife and I ordered for years at a local Mexican restaurant. in Northwest Indiana.

I forgot the ricotta cheese while shopping but tried mashed potatoes like some restaurants serve. The dish came out very good. The potatoes may be a nice way to cut back on dairy.

I added corn and red peppers with the spinach. I also added grilled chicken when filling the enchiladas. We also used green enchilada sauce instead of red. My family LOVED it and rated it 9 stars.

It was very good, but needed more spice for my taste.  I also used a very mild red enchilada sauce.  It was easy and quick to put together so I will make it again, but will add more spice and use a different enchilada sauce.

This is one of the healthier Mexican dishes that I've had. Very tasty, too.  Be sure to have at least a few extra corn tortillas on hand, since I had some extra spinach filling.

This is a delicious alternative to meat version of enchiladas!  However, I like to add black beans and a small amount of rice with chili powder, if NOT serving with a side/salad to make it more filling.

it was very tasty, but I found it hard to keep the enchiladas in nice rolls, when it came out of the oven, it was just mush....I think I'll need some more practice!

Excellent texture.  The enchilada sauce carries the flavor - as suggested from another member, I used the 10 minute enchilada sauce from this site.

I used red enchilada sauce and used regular yellow onion 1/2 cup. Always went other members ideas and added cumin and chili powder. Wife loved it and she isn't much for anything healthy.

Made as directed and we loved it. Even my daughter who says she doesn't like ricotta cheese (I didn't tell her it was made with ricotta cheese before she tried it) tried it and said just how good it was. Will definitely make again.

My husband and I both loved it. I didn't have enchilada sauce so I concocted my own with a container of fresh salsa (around 1-1/2 cups), 1/4 cup sour cream, plus a packet a taco seasoning.  Used a shredded Mexican cheese mixture instead of Monterrey Jack. Delicious!

This was really good. I had a poblano to use up so I broiled/ peeled/ chopped it & topped the filling with it prior to rolling. I used a homemade enchilada sauce recipe from Pinterest (link posted below). I might add black beans or even diced chicken in the future to beef it up but both my husband & I really enjoyed this. Thanks for posting!!!! Enchilada sauce recipe: http://pin.it/duZyZtC

Enchiladas filled with creamed spinach. I like enchiladas, and I like creamed spinach, but I think the combination was a little too odd for me. It tasted okay, not great, not bad, just...odd. 

I would not make it again unless I happened to have the right combination of ingredients left over from making other recipes. And I would probably try modifying the recipe per other reviewers' suggestions.

This recipe doesn't deserve a 5 star...it deserves 10!! I made it as a lunch for my kids and grand-kids. Even the 2 year old ate it with gusto and the 2 adults wanted the recipe for themselves. The only change I made was to add some red pepper and used flour tortillas. So quick and easy to make too! Thank you so much for this recipe...it is a real keeper :-)

It'a good recipe. I used Monterey Jack cheese and some queso fresco in place of the ricotta. I did find the recipe to be lacking in some seasoning and spice so I added in some Sazon and also used an onion and a few cloves of garlic along with the green onion called for.  Honestly, I used DOUBLE the seasonings and even chopped up a semi hot pepper and added it to the mix.
As a base recipe, this is great.  As a stand alone recipe. 
We LOVED ours tonight, with the tweaks I made.  Other than that, I think that you have a great base recipe here.
I learned a lot making this dish and I WILL be using it as a guideline when I make these again

This is a good base recipe that can be tweaked to individual taste.  I added more spice and geared it toward more Mexican but for some guest I will probably keep it as is.  My husband says it will probably get a five when it sit a day for the flavors to meld through it.

I substituted 1/2 onion for green onions, sauteed in olive oil with about 2 tsp garlic from a jar until onions were soft. Fresh spinach (about 5-6 cups total raw leaves) instead of frozen. Added 1/2 tsp each of cumin and chili powder, and a dash each of cayenne pepper and black pepper. Only used 1/4 cup of ricotta and 1/2 cup of sour cream (just until I found the mixture to be creamy but not runny). Oh, how very delicious!!!

Delicious and really easy!! To make add spice consider adding chopped jalapeños or serrano peppers. Also, to make healthier think of low fat cheese/sour cream/ricotta.

A huge hit with everyone who ate them! The only change I made was that I added lots of fresh jalapeno to the enchiladas. I made two batches - one with jalapeno before it went into the oven to cook, and one with raw jalapeno added to the top after it cooked. The raw jalapeno was better than the cooked.

These enchiladas were excellent. Perfect for a home cooked meal!!! Definitely would make these again. The only thing is that each person will probably eat 3 of them and the recipe says a person will only eat 2.

This was amazing! I added 8oz cooked shredded chicken breasts to the spinach mixture and this was seriously the best chicken spinach enchiladas I've ever had. I'll be making it for guests and family in the future.

My 6 year old and 3 year old enjoyed this and wanted me to make it again. My six year old looooved it!  It was very tasty and surprisingly filling. I used Frontera green enchilada sauce which comes in a pouch and Tillamook Monterey Jack. Yum!

Very, very good.

 I did however add a can of Rotella Mexican tomatoes with Lime & Cilantro while doubling all the other ingredients except the spinach as I needed a double batch and only had one package of spinach.

I read the reviews and the only change I made was to use more ricotta than called for.  I used 1.25 lbs of fresh ricotta from the deli (not the ricotta that comes in cottage cheese type containers) 

Many reviewers commented that this recipe was bland.  When you read the ingredients it is obvious this will not be a spicy recipe.  For the group I was feeding, bland is exactly what I needed. If you serve the enchilada sauce on the side and use a spicier enchilada sauce, the bland issue is quickly resolved. 

These ended up being a big hit with the group we fed. Even the meat eaters loved these. These will be made many, many times.

Excellent recipe for my vegetarian gluten free family.  I used fresh spinach rather than frozen and added kale.  I also added canned green chilies and sliced black olives.  Rather than rolling each enchilada I used layers of corn tortillas rather like a lasagna as I find the corn tortillas crack even if heated before rolling.  I used green chili enchilada sauce.  My son in law added hot sauce which the rest of us did not as we do not like the heat.

I gave this recipe a 5 star rating, because I used it as a base and modified the recipe; taking the advice of another Reviewer, I doubled the amount of spinach, diced 1 yellow onion, added 1 bunch of green onions, 1 each diced red and green bell peppers and 2 diced anaheim chilies. I used McCormick's ancho chili powder and roasted cumin, but kept the cayenne pepper and ricotta cheese as directed. I topped this dish with just a handful of additional shredded Monterey and jack cheese. After this cooked, I drizzled Mexican crema over the top Per Daughter's request for a vegetarian, Mexican themed noche buena dinner, I paired this with slow cooker pinto beans and Goya's boxed Mexican rice, adding the remains of my diced red and green peppers, and additional frozen corn. I fried up store bought frozen vegetable lumpia and made a garlic/vinegar/soy sauce dip. For dessert, we had a native fruit salad, panettone bread and a mini gingerbread bundt cake. The end result? Daughter and picky husband heartily approved this pseudo cruelty free dinner! Thank you for sharing.

I made with cream cheese for ricotta and plain yogurt for sour cream (didn't have ricotta or sc); also fresh spinach. Turned out great. Thanks! Highly recommend Enchilada Sauce by Anna Marie on this site in case you don't have canned.

Made for Christmas party and read reviews and used a lot of others ideas. Used yellow onions in place of green onions, used 10 ounce bag fresh spinach, just right amount. Also, added 4 ounces cream cheese mixed with l/2 can of  drained black beans.  Used flour tortillas, too. Everyone loved it.

Super easy recipe and delicious. We like spicy food so I added some hot sauce to the filling. I'll probably add some diced peppers next time.

These were delicious .  I did follow the suggestion added  sauteed red bell pepper, poblano, jalapeno and a can of green chilies.  I also added cumin and chili powder for flavor.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and it worked out just fine. We used the left over in scrambled eggs the next morning.  We are definitely making this again.

It was good and easy to make, but it was a little too heavy with the cheesiness.  I would add something to give it some substance.

My family loved this recipe! The cheese mixture was perfectly balanced, but I felt it would be lacking without more veggies. I switched out the butter for olive oil, and sauteed 1 zucchini and half a bell pepper along with the garlic prior to adding the green onion. I didn't change the amount of cheese at all, and it worked perfectly. I'm going to use green enchilada sauce next time (and there will definitely be a next time!).

Amazing for people who enjoy ricotta. Served two people for three nights. We used 6, 10inch tortillas and they fit nicely in the 9x13 tray, and each enchilada was about good for one person. I would not serve with anything else super cheesy because there is a good amount in these. 
We also used less enchilada sauce, closer to 15 oz, it was enough.

I loved the look and presentation of these in your picture!  So I used a toothpick to close and place seam up in the dish.  I also replaced the ricotta cheese with roasted chicken, mixed with the spinach, a bit of the enchilada sauce, 3 Italian cheese blend, and spices to taste.  I always coat the baking dish w/some enchilada sauce, assemble enchiladas, pour sauce over, cheese, cover and bake.  These were the best spinach enchiladas I ever made!! Thank you!

I missed the ingredient ricotta cheese when I went shopping.  So I subbed less than a cup of cottage cheese and a little more jack, topped with fresh green onions.  Served with grilled chicken and herbs on the side.  My sons said enchiladas were definitely a 5.

We aren't vegetarian but this recipe intrigued me. It seemed it may be a little bland so I added shredded chicken that I cooked in taco seasoning. My family agreed it would have been a little dull without the chicken. It was easy to prepare and was delicious!

Delicious! Added corn, red pepper, cumin and paprika. Used fresh spinach and this was devoured by all.

I didn't know how my family would like these since they are used to the chicken enchiladas I've made for years, but they liked this recipe more! I stuck to the recipe, but used 1/2 of a medium red onion, a bag of fresh spinach, and flour tortillas, only because that's what I had on hand.  I also added some salt, pepper, and cumin for flavor. Will make again, and will possibly try with chicken as well!

The spinach part was a little bland, so it needs something to zazz it up...maybe some herbs.  Otherwise it was good!

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was to add a can of diced tomatoes with mild chiles (drained) and 1 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp chipotle chile powder (the recipe just seemed like it needed a little more flavor). I used green enchilada sauce. Baked for 35 minutes. Next time I may add some black beans for additional protein. Flavor and texture are very good. Thanks for sharing!

I added a bit of leftover chicken breast to this and added a little more sour cream and ricotta.  It was a HUGE hit with the family.  Cut up avocado and served it alongside the dish.

No changes really but I did add shredded chicken and went lighter on the sauce as we prefer it that way.  It was a big hit.  Everyone loved it!

This was ok,  rather bland. It reminded me more of manicotti than enchilladas. With that said my kids devoured it probably because they love manicotti. Very quick easy recipe. I followed the recipe exactly topping the enchilladas with fresh pico de gallo & cilantro.

I made the changes of another reviewer - "sautéed one diced poblano, half of a jalapeno, half of a red bell pepper, three cloves of garlic, one yellow onion, and one 4oz can of green chilies to add to spinach mixture- I also doubled the spinach. Added cumin, chili powder, parsley, and cayenne to the filling."  I didn't double the spinach, more like 1 1/2 times.   The recipe was delicious!  Great for a mexican meal where there is one or more vegetarians in the crowd.

I found this recipe pretty bland. I was surprised also that there was so much fat per serving. I don't think I'll make it again. Vegetarian enchiladas can taste much better than this.

The whole family loved this. The guys said they didn't miss the meat! I doubled the recipe and on one pan added red enchilada sauce and the other I used Verde sauce. I also used green onions and red. I will make this again.

The second time I made this recipe, I realized that I had forgotten to buy ricotta cheese at the grocery! I substituted creamy goat cheese out of desperation and ...... wow! It was absolutely delicious! Best mistake ever!

This recipe rates a High 5 !!!  I like a white sauce with my spinach enchiladas but thought ' what the heck I'll follow the recipe '  It turned out delicious.  Only ingredient's I added was cumin and salt & pepper to the filling. Will make again.

I might make it again. I added chicken. Used canned spinach instead of fresh and less of it. And used less of the sauce than directed. And used mozerella cheese instead of the ricotta. Tastes good. Probably only need 1 10 oz can of sauce though. Sour cream amount is perfect.

Really good recipe imo. I did make a few changes... I added mushrooms and used fresh spinach and I added a dash of salt. And I used flour tortillas (because my goal isn't necessarily to be healthy lol) Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and oh my gosh it turned out SO GOOD! Also, for people out there saying that this recipe isn't Mexican... I wanted to make this because I had something like this when I traveled to Mexico city last winter. These are almost identical to the ones I ate down there. Also, our local Mexican restraunt serves something almost identical to this too. I don't know if they use ricotta and all that but I can tell you, it does taste the same. Anyway it's delish and I totally recommend it !! Only giving it 4 stars though because I think it's a good base recipe that has limitless possibilities to add on to... so imo it's not totally complete. Still it's a good start!

Delicious! Made them for my family and everyone loved 'em. I accidentally added all of the cheese in the enchiladas and just rolled with that. Also used mozzarella instead and added bell peppers and onions!

Fantastic.... So good. Doubled the recipe.  Didn't change it too much... But did follow other reviews and added some cumin, onion powder and chili powder. Used green onion as well as some white onion. Others mentioned using cottage cheese.... So I used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta. Since I doubled the batch... I decided to do some with shredded chicken as well.  Both were awesome and we can't decide if we like it better with or without the chicken. Either way I will definitely be making these again..... Made it into my recipe book!!! And that saying a lot ! Oh also used green enchilada sauce.... Not sure if it would have been as good with red?

We really liked this meal. We served it with rice. I sauteed the green onions and garlic in olive oil instead of butter. It was a great dish and I will make it again.

Wonderful, easy, and quick recipe! My boyfriend and I could not stop eating these. The only change I made was to substitute a chopped sweet onion for the green onion. Next time I will add lots more garlic and maybe some more veggies to the filling. I think this is a great recipe to try as written initially, and then change to suit your taste.  Thanks for the recipe, and the 10 lbs I gained last night!

This was pretty good but had the potential to be better. Like other reviewers, I felt the need to make it more "Mexican" through spices and heat. I served it with yellow rice and refried beans. Two other adults loved it; kids wouldn't touch it. Next time I will use fresh spinach. Two thumbs up, though.

I added about half a diced yellow onion to the garlic in the beginning.  I also added a couple handfuls of mushrooms and used fresh spinach.  It cooks down in no time at all and tastes better than frozen spinach.  I baked it with a cream sauce and then I used the chopped green onions (and added some fresh chopped roma tomatoes) for a garnish after baking. Delicious!

Quick and easy dinner but didn't get the best reviews from my family.  One didn't like at all, one liked but not enthusiastically and I liked it but the spinach, ricotta mix left me feeling there was something missing.

I didn't have sour cream, so I subbed plain Greek yogurt.
Easy, quick and delicious!
Also, DO use a 9X13 pan. The 2 quart casserole dish means you have to stack the enchiladas instead of laying them out in one layer.

Holy cow this was good!  I did makes some significant changes, though.  I added sauted chicken thighs, used yellow onion, and substituted queso fresco for the ricotta.  This will be a regular at our house.

I didn't follow recipe so shouldn't rate it but they took away the notes functionality. Made with corn tortillas, chicken, cheese, spinach, trader joes green salsa. Needed more cheese or moisture inside. Spinach worked though.

Took the recommendation of another and added 1/2 c lite sour cream, 1/2 salsa and cilantro to sauce.  Used fresh spinach and sautéed in olive oil instead of butter. I used 2 cups of cheddar cheese instead of one. Used 2% cottage cheese instead of ricotta and flour tortillas.  Found Las Palmas green enchilada sauce, in 28 0z can and used it all,  which doesn't have corn syrup in it. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes.

This dish came together quickly and simply.  The cheesy filling was less substantial than a meat filling, but added a mellow offset to the spicy enchilada sauce.  I, and those I served enjoyed it to be sure, but it wasn't something I felt like I wanted to start cooking regularly.

This recipe worked as a starting point for me.  Added 2 jalapenos, doubled garlic, and changed to mexican cheese instead of Monteray Jack/Ricotta combo.  Sour cream was left for on the side since family isn't too fond of it to begin with.  I think next time I'll add in some oregano for the stuffing too.

This recipe is great for a crowd or potluck situation where you are trying to keep your offering mild and generally appealing to varied tastes.  It feels more like a mid-west casserole than a Mexican enchilada.

This is super fast and super yummy. You could jazz it up if you wanted, but it was good as is. It made 5 large enchiladas. It's heavy on the cheese, so I'm going to try some nonfat and low-fat substitutions next time (like tofu).

I couldn't find pre-made enchilada sauce anywhere so I ended up making Emeril Lagasse's version.  This is kind of a Mexican/italian combination but oddly enough, it works.  We really enjoyed this for our Meatless Monday and I will do them again.  Thanks for posting.

Even better than I expected! I never imagined enchiladas to be so easy to make, but these were! They would be even better with a bit of spice...either some chiles or a hotter sauce. Would also be good with chicken!

This was a winner. My eleven year old daughters and their picky eater friend loved it and kept asking for seconds even though they snacked all the way up to dinner. I used fresh dry spinach chopped and didn't need to drain it before adding the ricotta and sour cream. I used Emeril's quick enchilada sauce recipe (not on this site.) I prefer flour tortillas for enchiladas. They don't break apart as easily and they lend themselves to the creaminess of these spinach enchilada. Delicious.

I'm not really sure if I can claim I made this. I almost changed everything. Used vidalia instead of green onions. Used cream cheese and vegetarian refried beans instead of ricotta and sour cream. Used green sauce instead of red. Added red and orange bell pepper and fajita seasoning. Did use Monterey Jack and spinach lol. Best enchiladas I've ever had and I'm not a vegetarian lol.

I had never had enchiladas before. We don't have any Mexican restaurants where I live, only a Taco Bell in the mall food court. I think I might like a different kind of enchilada, but these just didn't do it for me. I thought the flavour combinations were kind of weird. The filling was a little like the spinach manicotti that I make, but the ricotta cheese and spinach combined with the sauce was unappetizing to me. Not sure if I'll be able to eat the leftovers.

This was good. Quick and easy meal. The whole family liked it. I used flour tortillas because that is what I had on hand and also had to use cottage cheese, but these were still really good with the substitutions I had to make. Will def make again.

This was very tasty. The garlic/ spinach/ cheese combination was perfect. The only downfall was that they didn't go over well with my children. I will try another veggie or beans for them next time.

This is a very basic recipe....I made changes and it is now one of my favs-I use 4 or 5 garlic cloves, white onion, poblano pepper and green onions. I add cumin, hot paprika, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper all to taste. I also use fresh spinach and no sour cream.  Excellent!

This was good.  Used flour tortillas (we like the consistency better) and fresh spinach was a must, but my husband's comment was, "I never thought I'd like something without meat so much." :-)
thank you for sharing.

These are very good. I only used 1 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce, probably should have used a little more. I also put a little chili powder in with the spinach mix. Great recipe!

Great recipe!!! I did make a few changes, however. I used fresh spinach that I sauteed first instead of the frozen. I also added about 1.5# of shredded chicken for a meat version. Upon other reviewers recommendations, I also added a dash of cumin, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and parsley. For the enchilada sauce, I mixed the canned sauce with sour cream, cilantro, lime juice and a small piece of jalapeño pepper in a blender until smooth. It tasted amazing! Husband thoroughly enjoyed it!

I made these using the " best enchilada sauce" recipe from this site.  Delicious.  I used fresh spinach and threw it in with the onions for a quick saute before adding to the cheese.

These were fine. The filling tasted more like something I should be stuffing into manicotti shells than into tortillas, even after adding some much-needed seasonings. I also added some chopped red bell pepper, and I'm glad I did because without them, there would have been no texture to them besides mush. Good flavor, but not my favorite thing ever.

The ricotta and spinach reminds me of lasagna. Next time I will add more seasoning, garlic/onion powder...something to give it an added kick. Or maybe taco seasoning to make it more of a Mexican dish. But very tasty either way.

This recipe is great. I used fresh spinach and didn't quite use 10 full oz. I also only used 10 oz. of enchilada sauce and used seven flour tortillas instead of 10 corn tortillas. Next time I will probably go a little easier on the garlic and do 1.5 cloves and try it with green enchilada sauce. This recipe is awesome and could be varied in so many ways.

This is my go-to enchilada recipe. I usually double the recipe and freeze half. Also, I make the Ten Minute enchilada sauce, quick and easy. Sometimes when I double the recipe, I add shredded chicken. When I visit my daughter in Georgia she always asks me to make a "double" for the freezer!

I love spinach and I love enchiladas - so I was very excited to give this a try. Following the recipe exactly I found it to be seriously lacking in flavor. If I were to make this again I would definitely supplement with additional seasoning and possibly some mild green chilies.

Made this for dinner tonight as a part of our meatless Monday meal .. The family enjoyed it, even my oldest who isn't a fan of spinach, told me he could barely taste it. I made 2 changes to the recipe, using flour tortillas instead of corn and made my won enchilada sauce from a recipe I found on here .. This recipe is a keeper, will definitely make again

I'm glad I read several reviews before making this -  with several tweaks these enchiladas were AMAZING! Changes: I used EVOO instead of butter, 1 small onion in place of the green onion, 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2, a can of Rotel with green chiles, part skim ricotta, flour tortillas, green enchilada sauce, and I added 1tsp cumin, 1 tsp chile powder, and salt to taste. I sauteed the onion, then added the frozen spinach, cumin, salt, chile powder, garlic, and Rotel/chiles. I also mixed together the sour cream and enchilada sauce - spread a bit on the bottom of the baking dish and poured the rest on top of the enchiladas. Next time, I may spray the dish with a bit of Pam - some of my tortillas stuck a little. Overall, this was a very good dish with room for lots of modifications. My husband really enjoyed these too!

Really yummy! I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen and all low-fat dairy options and it was still fantastic. Paired very well with Mexican rice.

Made this yesterday.  Thought it would be good but it really wasn't.  The mix of enchilada sauce, spinach, and corn tortilla's really isn't a good combination.  Better to save all ingredients except the corn tortilla's and make spinach lasagna.

Very easy recipe and good tasting. I substituted olive oil for the butter. I also cooled the filling mixture before folding in cheeses. After baking, I quickly put enchiladas under a broiler to melt the cheese to a gooey consistency.

Yum!  Per other reviewers suggestions, I added ground red pepper, onion powder, cumin, and chili powder to the filling mixture, used 1 bag fresh spinach, and flour tortillas.  Would make again.

Yummy!!!!  I only modified the recipe in one way...I used a recipe to make soy ricotta instead of using regular ricotta to help reduce the amount of dairy.  It was so so so yummy!  Even my husband who hates veggies gobbled them down!

Soy Ricotta-
Buy a block of the soy, firm
Mash up half of the block real well or put it in the food processor.  Add 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, tsp of salt and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.  Take the other half of the soy block and mash in to get the consistency that you want.  It came out to be more than a cup, but I mixed all of it in with the spinach!  So so good.  I baked according to recipe directions.

LOVED these.  Very easy to make, very tasty.  Baked them in two pyrex dishes (5 enchiladas in each).  Made with the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce and the Black Bean Salad.

These were the yummiest enchiladas I have EVER had! Even my husband and toddler loved them with no complaints about there not being any meat. The only thing I did differently was add a can of rinsed black beans and used a whole regular onion instead of the green onions. Oh, and I used flour tortillas because that's what I prefer. So delicious and filling!

Love this recipe. I change to fresh spinach and I add shredded rotisserie chicken (for my husband). Instead of the sour cream I use plain fat free Greek yogurt. You won't miss the sour cream and this adds more protein.

My husband gave it a 10/10! 
I changed a few things: I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, threw some cooked chicken chunks into the filling and poured a medium salsa over the top instead of enchilada sauce. This increased the veggies (chunky salsa) and made it spicy! Delicious!

I subbed cottage cheese for ricotta and unstrained greek yogurt for sour cream and you wouldn't miss the extra calories - same great taste with less guilt! Also, you can leave the cheese on top of enchiladas off because there is already enough goo and flavor without it! I added mushrooms and garlic (just because I had them on hand)  and sautéd them with the spinach and onions - delicious extra touch! A good option when you are craving mexican food but don't want a heavy belly! I served with spanish rice and jalapeno and black beans. YUM!

My husband is Hispanic from South Texas and he raved about this recipe!!! I did make a few changes. I added 1.5 lbs of poached shredded chicken breast to the mixture and diced a jalapeño and serrano pepper. That made it incredibly spicy and the enchiladas were very full, which we like. This is definitely a repeat in our kitchen.

This was absolutely delicious, but I expected it to make more.  Next time I will double the recipe.

Used yellow onions instead of green and sauteed in canola oil.  Only needed one 10oz can of enchilada sauce.

Good.  Used red enchilada sauce.  Will try green next time.  I added salt and pepper to the cheese/spinach mixture.  Consider adding a little more seasoning to mixture next time. Son not too crazy about it though.  Too much spinach :)

I made these because I had leftover ricotta in the fridge but didn't want another pasta dish.  Unfortunately for me, the ricotta gave these a rich, italian taste.  In the end we definitely ate these up and I was happy not to waste my cheese, but I'm going to stick to simpler, spicier enchiladas.

No major complaints, however I personally prefer flour tortillas to corn so I might try this again with those.  I do happen to like the black bean lasagne recipe with corn tortillas so I guess it depends on the combination.  I used fresh spinach because I started the recipe without defrosting the frozen, and luckily had fresh on hand.

I really liked this dish. I did change a couple of things, I used a small yellow onion, along with the green onion... I also added some cilantro. All and all.. I will do this again. Was a big hit with the boyfriend that is trying to eat vegan a couple of times a week.

I will be honest I was a little worried this wouldn't be good despite good reviews but man was I surprised. The flavor is great (I did add onion powder, garlic powder and cumin to the cheese mixture) and even my picky 5 year old who won't normally eat anything green loved these. We will be making them again in my house.

Excellent except I am having an issue w/ the sauce.  maybe I haven't found the right one. Kids find the preferida red mild one I have always used too spicy & refuse to eat it. I have topped theirs w/ just a little ketchup & bake separately. I have to admit that I am not a fan of this canned sauce either. Will start experimenting with other brands.  So other than our canned enchilada sauce issue, the recipe is great, I always make as written.

I used a jar of Frontera enchilada sauce and spiked it with some add'l chile paste I keep in the freezer. Generally speaking, I'm a "from scratch" person so I didn't think I'd go for this, but it's really good and SO easy

Great budget recipe! This was a huge hit with my housemates.  I live with two 20 year old German boys who can eat a LOT.  Two enchiladas filled them up so full they were complaining their stomachs were going to burst.

I followed reviewer's suggestions and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  I also served it with corn which was delish.

Totally delicious and easy to prepare! I couldn't find enchilada sauce at my supermarket, and being a Canadian I had no idea what it was supposed to taste like but I made my own by mixing some green tomatillo salsa with tomato sauce and it was delicious! No idea if it tasted like real enchilada sauce, but it was nice. :) I also added some corn to up the veggie content. Next time I am going to add some jalapeños for some extra heat! This recipe gives you lots of room to play!

I really liked these enchiladas. I made it almost exactly as the recipe said except i used 1 1/2 cans of enchilada sauce. i think it would have been better if the sauce was a little thicker, the canned stuff is always runny. will be making again.

Yummy recipe!  I took another users suggestion and substituted the ricotta / sour cream with fat free cottage cheese.  Still very rich, filling with great flavor!

I needed a recipe to entertain a vegetarian couple for dinner...and luckily, this dish was a hit with everyone.  Easy to assemble.  As suggested by others, I did add some extra spices to the mix (cumin, red pepper flakes and diced jalapenos).  Also, I used red and yellow corn tortillas to give the dish a little color/variety.

OMG..these are so yummy!  I didn't find that I needed to add any spices to the mixture.  I made my own red enchilada sauce and the spices from it made the perfect combination!

I made this exactly per the recipe and it was so delicious!  My daughter and I both love spinach as well as ricotta cheese.  It was also so easy. what could be better: delicious and easy.  Only thing I will do is check out other brands of enchilada sauce to find a favorite.

This was really delicious. I used cottage cheese (which I don't normally like) and you couldn't tell the difference. This recipe is a keeper!

This is easy and very tasty.  Next time I will add more seasoning and maybe a can of green chilies.  I like vegetarian cooking -- too bad my husband is a confirmed meat eater.

I loved it. My family did not - most probably because there was no meat in the 'casserole' (as my husband called it).

This recipe is so quick and easy.  I took the suggestion of others and added more spices, peppers, and spinach filling and my husband loves it.  This is my go to meal when company is in town because it is so easy and they will be guaranteed to love it.

I mixed a little EVOO with the butter because the amount given didn't seem like it was enough and I hate using a lot of butter.  I used the Kraft Mexican Cheddar Pepper Jack shredded mixture, fresh spinach and whole wheat flour tortillas (I despise corn ones).  They were easy to make and came out tasty.  I cut the recipe down to 6 enchiladas but only had enough filling for four, which worked out fine for me.

Taste was very good.  We used fresh spinach and wilted it with some onions and peppers.  However, we did not care for the texture once it was baked.  Very soggy soft texture.  May try again and use less enchilada sauce and just pour in the bottom of the pan.

Took another reviewers advice and added, cumin, chili powder and cayenne pepper. I also used red instead of green onions because it was what I had on hand. AND I made this all in my microwave! We're remodeling and I'm without a stove. Fortunately, I have a convection microwave so, I was able to bake it accordingly. My husband loved it!

This was delicious! I had to do a bit of substituting due to not having all the right ingredients. I used half a regular onion instead of the green onions, and then I substitute spinach with some arugula and dandelion leaves from the garden. But it tasted soooo good!

I thought these were very good!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and the ONLY thing I did different was used 6 oz fresh spinach, pepper jack cheese and I added chicken!  I used the blue corn tortillas and the trader joes enchilada sauce and these were SUPER YUMMY!!!!!!!  I can't wait to get home tonight and have me some leftovers. :)

Really good but i did not really follow the recipe all the way...I had to improvise a lot with what I had in my kitchen. 
I sauted an onion and garlic in olive oil instead of butter, then added the spinach, some muchrooms, and green onions. 
Instead of ricotta and sour cream I used cottage cheese, half a can cream of mushroom soup, and shredded cheddar cheese.
I rolled the spinach cheese mixture in flour tortillas, and only used about half the can of enchilada sauce, and shredded more cheddar on top...
An odd mixture I know, but it turned out delicious ;)

We loved these!  I typically don't use corn tortillas, but decided to this time (white corn) and we LOVED the texture of them.  I did find that heating them up was not enough to make them roll without ripping, so I dip them all in some hot oil, one by one, just until absorbed and then filled and rolled them all.  Worked perfect.  I also did add some seasoning to the cheese mixture.  I used: 1tsp. onion juice (in place of onion, which I don't like), 4 small cloves garlic and added a can of green chiles, as well as some cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper.  I feel like without these, it would have been a bit bland.  I also accidentally got one 10oz can of enchilada sauce, so for the top I ended up mixing 10oz. enchilada sauce with 1/2c. sour cream and I actually really liked the way it turned out.  Nice and creamy!  It ended up a bit spicy with these changes (which we love) but even my 2 year old asked for more!  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Used low-fat dairy products, and didn't miss a thing. My meat-loving parents enjoyed the change. Also freezes well before baking.

***Update - Instead of red sauce, I tried a canned verde sauce and added a little sour  cream to it. Delicious!

Great recipe. My husband insisted that we double the spinach so we did. I added some cottage cheese and a little extra ricotta. We had white onions so we used those instead. We used a mixture of 70 percent pepper jack and 30 percent cheddar. Also, I added a fair amount of spicy Mrs. Dash to the spinach/cheese filling. We used a lot more onion than the recipe calls for, but that is personal preference. Turned out fabulous. Thanks for sharing! :)

These were AMAZING! The only thing I changed about the recipe was used cottage chesse instead of the ricotta, but I'm sure they are just as good if not better with the ricotta- I just wanted to lighten it up a bit. I used generic canned enchilada sauce but I do want to try the ten minute enchilada sauce recipe on this site.

My boyfriend and I loved this! I know it is supposed to be a vegitarian dish, but I added ground turkey and a few diced jalapenos! It was delish...the only thing is adding the turkey takes a little longer for the prep time. I will def do this again!

This is absolutely divine. If you love cheese this is for you. I made this with my boyfriend for a Mexican dinner night. It was fun to cook together and came out amazing. We paired it with some mexican styled rice and mexican soda. Will definitely use this recipe again - thanks!

as usual i changed it quite a bit but it was a hit at our house.  added a can of black beans and one of chopped tomatoes as well as about a t of chilli powder and cumin from the advise of previous reviews.  my bag of spinach was 16 oz and i used the whole thing so i also added about another cup of ricotta because of all the extras.  because of all the extra stuff it made 14 instead of 10 and i wish i had had a second can of sauce but there were no complaints.  next time i think i may add some thawed frozen corn just to up the veggies but this will definitely be made again.

Made this last night and it was soooo good!  I used fresh spinach, cooked it down a bit w/the onion and garlic.  I didn't measure anything, not really important with this recipe.  Next time I think I'll just use ff greek yogurt mixed w/some cheese for the mixture.  I think you could make this with zucchini as well.  I used Frontera enchilada sauce, medium - it was really good.  Great weeknight meal, very quick.  Will go into the rotation for sure.

I enjoyed making this recipe. The end result looked and smelled wonderful. The only change I made was the type of onion I used. I gave it 4 stars because I felt the flavors could be enhanced a little more. My boys suggested adding chicken next time. Great recipe that I can tweek to our tastes.

I'm not much of a "chef" although I do cook when I go on a health kick, which I'm on right now. I just made the spinach enchiladas for the first time and they were outstanding. I did substitute no salt added low fat cottage cheese for the ricotta cheese, I also used low fat sour cream and land of lakes light butter with canola oil. Instead of red enchilada sauce, I used Hatch green enchilada sauce. I also added Hatch Tomatillos, mexican chili powder and red pepper flakes.

Delicious and super easy to make! For those of us who are gluten free as well, be sure to examine which enchilada sauce you purchase.  Many have wheat all up in them, otherwise this is a fantastic gluten free friendly meal!! fiesta!

This was perfect. Very good when served with Salsa Verde. Read about 5 of most recent reviews and looked like a decent recipe, so I tried it to exactly as it said. Served over rice that I made with butter, green peppers, garlic (yes just a little) then rotel and it was sooooo good. Even better for lunch two days later.

Followed recipe exactly. Very Good. Recipe only made enough filling for 9 tortillas. Tortillas come in pkg of 12 so next time I will make a little more filling so I don't have to find a use for the extra tortillas.

Great recipe with some tweaks. Used home made low fat milk cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Olive oil in place of butter. No sour cream - did not miss it at all. Fresh spinach. I used white onions (readily available) and the crunchiness tasted great. I did not have the enchilada sauce ingredients handy. I therefore made a tomato sauce at home with plenty of red chilies and was a great hit. I also made some green sauce with green bell pepper - a recipe I had picked up from elsewhere. With these two sauces, we did not miss the lack of cheese or sour cream at all!

This was a big winner at our house.  We eat very little meat, so it was a perfect recipe for us.  I found though that we ate more than the serving size suggests, or maybe we are just piggy!

great, spicy. I made it like a casserole with three layers of tortillas and two layers of filling. Mark loved it.

Not what we expected, the red enchilda sauce didn't blend well with the spinach. If you're a big spinach lover you make like it but it was a little much for me and my family.

I made this as is, and I liked it but I think it needs something. I know it's supposed to be a vegetarian dish, but next time I would like to try it with chicken and I think it would be great with a side of Mexican rice. It was still good though, and it smells like it's from a restaurant!

I didn't have enchilada sauce, so I followed the recipe, omitting the sauce and the green onion. Topped with what I had - spaghetti sauce. Very good!  Looking forward to trying it with the enchilada sauce.

This dish is one I will make regularly.  I took the advice of TC and added the seasonings and sauteed vegetables.  I did not do the jalepeno tho.  I used fresh spinach on purpose and green chili sauce because I had it on hand.  They are delicious!

This was a great, easy recipe. Here are the changes I made- used 8 oz of non-fat sour cream and 15 oz of ricotta cheese. I also used a 10 oz package of fresh spinach instead of frozen. I added about 1 T of chili powder, 1 t cumin, and a sprinkle of garlic powder to the cheese mixture. I also used 10" tortillas instead of 6", with a little squeeze they fit nicely in the 9" baking pan. And I used salsa on top instead of enchilada sauce because that's what we had. They turned out great!

I thought this recipe was great. I made it for my girlfriend and I last night. However I did ad extra spices to the spinach filling, Cumin and white pepper. I also added two small cans of crushed green chillies thinking it may add to the mexican flavor and I was right.

Good as is. I would add more cumin, chili powder, etc, as others have said, but I like things with a lot of spicy flavor.   I made several modifications in mine -- used a regular onion, since I didn't have green on hand. Used olive oil rather than butter, modified the sour cream by using creme fraiche with lime juice and a little milk whisked in (don't have sour cream where I'm living), and then made some enchilada sauce myself. Turned out okay.

These were very good! I think I prefer my spinach enchiladas with a bit more true spinach though, so I'll probably look for something less creamy. But it was certainly quite tasty and I will likely make again. Thanks!

Excellent! I added red bell peps, yellow onion (finely diced), corn and a touch of chipotle to liven it up a bit. The original gives a nice basic recipe to experiment with.

Delicious! I used a bag of fresh spinach and flour tortillas, as I don't like corn tortillas and made my enchilada sauce from scratch, as it's cheap and easy to do. I may spice it up a bit next time. I served it with a salad. The family loved it!

These turned out a fantastic dish and I was amazed by how quick and easy the preparation was.  I made a few alterations, which I think contributed to the excellent result.  Rather than using frozen spinach, I chopped a bag of fresh spinach and sautéed it with 1/2 tbsp butter and a splash of water then drained when cooked, wilted and ready. I substituted Mexican blend cheese for Monterrey Jack.  After I mixed in the cheeses and creams according to directions I added my own seasonings- sprinkles of Adobo, garlic powder and paprika and I also added a small can of green chiles.  I poured some enchilada sauce into the baking dish before adding the enchiladas and I sprinkled the top layer with additional chopped green onion.

These were great.  I loved the combination of flavors.  I don't like ricotta so I subbed cottage cheese.  I only used about 1 1/4 cups cheese.  I think this would be even better if I add more seasoning to the spinach.  I also topped with my own red sauce so that it wasn't too salty for me.  Definitely a keeper. I served with Garlic Parmesan Orzo on this site.

This was FABULOUS!!!  I used green enchilada sauce instead of red (my DH's preference) and added cumin and white pepper (about 1/2 tsp. of each).  I am totally adding this to my regular rotation.

Loved these. I used a bag of frozen spinach AND a bag of fresh since I had it. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and added cumin, chili powder and some red pepper flakes to taste. I always add more garlic. I also had left over turkey breast so I cubed that up and added it to the spinach mixture. YUMMY easy, and healthy. I added only a cup of cheese total on top, no need for it inside. :)

Like others, I replaced the ricotta w/ cottage cheese. They were very good. Next time, I will make it the "right" way with ricotta! Thanks for the recipe

I loved these. The spinach filling is so delicious and I love having left over ricotta to make pancakes with in the morning. I will definately try this recipe with a white enchilada sauce as well. This is going into my favorites!

Very good as is.  Loved the corn flavor of the tortillas. It's a keeper.

I thought this was really good, just the way the recipe called it.  They were perfect portion size with the smaller tortilla shells.  Definitely will make this again!

Definitely a great recipe that I will make again for my family.  I like many others used lowfat versions of the dairy products.  I really did not change anything else in the recipe, and thought it tasted great.

Loved it! My meat-loving husband loved it too, even though is he pretty skeptical of my red meat-less ways. VERY easy. I added some garlic powder & 1 1/2 cups sauteed green bell pepper for color. Will make again!

My family has requested this over and over again.  I generally add additional garlic, a mix of cheeses (including MJ), and extra enchilada sauce.  Just reviewing this recipe makes me hungry--thanks for sharing it!

We really enjoyed these. I added cumin, chili powder, salt and red pepper flakes like others suggested. We are always looking for meat-less meals to enjoy. This will be added to the rotation for sure.

This was just ok. I thought it was going to be better.  I did follow the recipe but I added more cheese and spices. I guess I didn't spice it enough because it was a little bland. I might give it another try though, definitely with more spices.

I made these last night and to be honest we all thought they were very bland.  Next time need to add ALOT more spice and also use bigger tortilla shells.

Good. I made some changes - I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil instead of butter. I left out the sour cream and used marinara sauce. It was good - almost like a spinach lasagna.

These are wonderful! I used low fat sour cram and low fat ricotta, as well as fresh spinach, chopped. If you use fresh spinach you have to drain the excess water. I also doubled up the ingredients and used two baking pans for a potluck - just as delicious, it was a big hit!

I made these the other night and they turned out awesome. I skipped the onion since I am not a fan and substituted low fat cottage cheese for the ricotta and they still turned out great and were very easy to make.

I'll admit to changing some things. I used flour tortillas, cottage cheese, and sweet onions. Based on those changes this is excellent. I was so worried the texture would be slimy, but it wasn't! It was seasoned just fine, I wouldn't add anything more. Yummy and healthy with no need to buy expensive meat. A winner in my book.

Really good.  I didn't use any butter and added in some diced hot peppers, which added more of a mexican spiciness to it.

My family and I liked this recipe. I used what I had on hand. One yellow onion, some left over portobella mushrooms, and Fresh spinach. I sauteed them adding one ingredient at time according to how fast it cooks. Spinach last. I also used cottage cheese and mozzarella cheese. I'm sure its better with the ricotta and jack cheese but I hate going to the grocery store. I'll try it again. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly, it was great! They were even better the next day. I did use flour tortillas instead of corn even though I like corn tortillas better if I'm at a restaurant, just not in my own recipes. Thanks!

Were definitely good, and was surprised at how easy they were.  The only trouble I had was I didn't heat the tortillas up enough to really roll.  otherwise they were very good.

The filling mixture was very fragrant but in the end very bland. I even added cumin to the onions and garlic as they cooked which I thought would help spice it up -- but it was still bland. I would make these again but I’d  adjust the recipe some. I gave it 3 stars though because it was a nice change from the usual chicken or beef enchiladas.

I did some additions/deductions from the recipe to go with what I had on hand in my pantry and it worked really well. I added a can of Navy beans right after adding the spinach to the saucepan (make sure to simmer longer to give beans enough time to soften) and I left out the ricotta cheese. They were very yummy and satisfying.

These were pretty good, however, the corn tortillas do not hold together after baking so it was more of a MASHilada. Not sure how to change that though - will probably make my own red sauce next time too as the store bought mild was still too spicy for us.

S.O. thought this was one of the best meals I made.  I used the same dairy mixture with some cooked Chorizo, so we had a plate of spinach and chorizo enchiladas.  I'm not fond of the corn tortillas though, but they were good!

I just finished serving this recipe to my family and it was a big hit, even with the picky eaters.  I made it with low fat ricotta, 2% shredded cheese and fat free sour cream and it was fabulous! Im sure the full fat version is even more delicious.  I will definitely make this one again.

In addition to using a white garlic sauce instead of a red enchilada sauce, I also suggest topping the finished servings with Hollandaise Sauce: the lemon-butter flavor brings everything to a fine balance, with a hint of tang via the Hollandaise.

This was a big hit for dinner last night and the leftovers were awesome!  I replaced the butter w/ olive oil and used 6 cups of fresh spinach that I cooked until well wilted.  The only downside to the fresh was having to rinse it (came in my CSA box covered in dirt!) and so filling ended up much wetter than if I had used frozen.  I will definitely make this again though!

Best spinach dish recipe I've tried so far. Even my kids ate it which is quite a feat. I did cut back on the spinach a bit, but the overall flavor of the dish was excellent.

I thought this was an excellent and easy recipe.  I served with refried beans and fresh green and red peppers to cut down on portion size of enchiladas and fat.  I thought it was excellent and wouldn't change much.  I used cheddar and munster because I had them at home and this worked well in substitution for monterey jack.  Well done!

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but it seemed as if something was missing from the filling.  In saying that I gave it 4 stars because I think it has potential, it just needs to be spiced up a little-oh, and I do NOT recommend using store bought enchilada sauce-I did and it tasted awful! The next time I make this I am going to use cottage cheese instead of ricotta and make one of the enchilada sauce recipes from this site.

While we enjoyed this, it was a bit too much like manicotti for me.  It just wasn't as "mexican" I think for me as I wanted it to me.  It was good, just not what I expected.

I doubled the recipe, used low fat cottage cheese, added shredded chicken breast, chili powder, salt, cumin, and fresh chopped jalapeno and tomatoes from my garden. I served it with refried beans and spanish rice. I will definitely make this again. My husband and 3 children loved it! I am giving 4 stars because when I tasted the mixture before the additions it was very very bland. After adding seasoning, veges and etc it was very flavorful.

Implemented several of the reader recommendations and they were delicious.  Used homemade red enchilada sauce - I hate the canned stuff, used fresh spinach, added garlic salt, used yellow onion instead of green onion, and used flour tortillas.  The mixture was bit runny, but they turned out fine.  I am already sharing the recipe and will definitely make these again.

Like others I added my own seasonings to the spinach mixture.  I added cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt.  I served it with rice and black beans.  It was awesome!!!!  I think maybe next time I may add salsa to the mixture.

Excellent. I added 2 cups of Monterey Jack cheese to the spinach mixture, along with some chili powder and cumin. Also added chicken. It tastes good reheated and so makes great left overs. A new favorite.

I tried this tonight.  I liked the recipe, but my boyfriend and I really like spinach, so I was looking for more of a spinach consistancy.  The consistancy of the mix looks like what I use for baked manicotti. Next time I'll cut the Ricotta to 1/2 a cup and see how it goes.  Thanks, it was yummy!

Like other reviewers, I added a few spices to the spinach while cooking (white & black pepper, cumin, and cayenne) which made a wonderful difference! Next time, I would definately use a white sauce instead of red- they didnt seem to mesh well by my pallet.

This recipe was really good.  I seasoned the spinach mixture with red pepper flakes & garlic salt like the other reviewers suggested - it was yummy.  Also, once the dish was put together, I sprinkled sliced green onions over the top to give it some color.

We both really enjoyed this dish.  The only changes I made were the using a homemade enchilada sauce, substituting a Mexican cheese in place of the shredded, and using flour vs. corn tortilla.  I am just not a fan of the corn tortillas that they sell in the store.  I would definitely make this again, although I would add more spinach and cut down on the cheese.  I could barely taste it in there.

This recipe was pretty tasty.  I added some additional spices as well (cumin, salt, pepper, nutmeg) to help flavor the filling and I cut down the cheese and sour cream to make it less caloric.  I would definitely make ahead and freeze for a quick meal.

I gave these 5 stars but I did make some changes. First I sauteed the onions, garlic and fresh spinach in oil rather than butter. To the ricotta mixture I added chili powder, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika & crushed red pepper. I topped enchiladas with mozz cheese. These were terrific! I will definitely make again.

These were soooo good.  I added baby bella mushrooms to mine and used the ten minute enchilada sauce on this site.  I used flour and corn tortillas also.  I prefer flour tortillas in anything but the corn tasted good also.  My dad who will eat NOTHING without meet ate more of these than the beef ones I made especially for him!

Oh..my..god these were delicious!! My boyfriend and I wolfed them down in no time. Based on other reviews I subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta. I also used cheddar cheese. For the enchilada sauce I used the "Texas Enchilada Sauce" recipe.

I made this for a bunch of friends and it got pretty good reviews. It was really easy to prepare and makes good use of SPINACH, which I love. :) I would probably make it again, but not necessarily right away.

I made a few adjustments to our taste, but the overall base recipe was excellent! Sauteed diced yellow onion with garlic and butter before adding the spinach and cheese. Also cut chicken breasts into pieces, cooked in a skillet with a little taco seasonings, and added to spinach mixture. This filling was great for the enchiladas, but even w/out the chicken we could tell it would be a tasty recipe.

great vegetarian recipe!  I added some mushrooms in with the spinach mix, and used non-fat sour cream & ricotta - also added some fajita seasoning and cilantro.  tasted great.

a good base recipe-i took some other reviewer's advice and added a ton of garlic, some diced portabella and petite white mushrooms (add after onion softens a bit but before the spinach), and I mixed the colby jack cheese on top with a small amount of pepperjack.  Awesome!

This was really good.  So much better than I thought it might be. I hoped the kids would like it, but they refused to, because they knew what was in it.

I thought that these were okay.  My family didn't care for them enough to make again, though.  I think the filling was tasty but didn't mesh wonderfully with the enchillada sauce.  I would possibly consider using the filling to stuff shells or in lasagna.  I did sub fresh spinach for the frozen and flour tortillas for the corn.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Only thing I added was fresh mushrooms.  I made 4 pans total of 48 inchildads for a retirement party.  I got lots of compliments and my enchiladas were the first eaten and gone.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe.

Hubby loved--I wasn't as big a fan.  Too much cheese in the filling.  Would consider decreasing the various cheeses and possibly adding mushrooms to the mixture next time. Also, corn tortillas were very hard to work with, although the taste of them is much better than flour.

I loved this too.  I added green chilis, and spices as the others, and canned green chili enchilada sauce and a bit of bottled mole sauce for spice.  Wonderful!

Quite good!  I followed the directions exactly but went a little light on the spinach (about 3/4 of a package).  I agree with other reviewers who said it could probably use a few spices, but it was just fine even without.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

These were ok, but not great. I thought the filling was kind of bland, and I even added a 4oz. can of green chiles.
