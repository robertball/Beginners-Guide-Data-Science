When the stars make you drool just like pasta fazul, that's amore!.  What a great recipe, and easy! The cannellini beans are like mashed potato on the inside.  We were quite liberal with the parmesan. Extra tomatoes (and spice) when adding them and mashing some of the beans midway through help make it more of a sauce.

I love this recipe, it reminds me of my mom's weekly pasta fazul from my childhood. I did make some changes, I used 1 big can of whole peeled tomatoes with all of the juice. I also used dried herbs instead of fresh. I did 1 tablespoon of parsley & basil and 1 teaspoon of oregano. This was full of flavor and perfect.

Delicious! I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and I didn't have cannelini beans so I used a can of baby butter beans; also no macaroni so I used thin spaghetti but really none of these changes really changed the taste of the recipe. I have to say this is a great recipe. I think the absolute key to this recipe is mixing together the butter parmasan cheese and noodles. It gives the noodles a nice texture and a nice taste. I will definitely be making this recipe again. Several times.

This recipe was great after we made some corrections to the recipe. There was no liquid until the very end where we ended up blending the whole tomatoes with water and tomato sauce. We also had to constantly add water and tomato jucice (more liquid from another jar of whole pealed tomatoes). After all of these corrections the soup was GREAT!!

Delicious!!!but I did tweek it a little. I added 1 cup spagetti sauce 1 can chicken broth and the juice of 1/2 of a lemon. The lemon juice will punch up the flavor. I left out the cheese and let that be an add on at the table.

This excellent dish is a keeper! I followed the recipe exactly - no additions or modifications. It was easy to prepare and does not require fancy ingredients not usually found in your cupboard. I have three meat eaters and a vegetarian in the house and we all enjoyed this dinner.

This turned out good... it's really not a main dish but more of a side dish... I served it with quiches to company and the two were good together. I doubled the recipe using one large (25 oz?) can of diced tomatoes and one smaller can of just tomatoe sauce because of the other reviewer's complaints of it being dry. With my changes it was really good and i'll make it again.

This meal was excellent in terms of ease of preparation and taste. This recipe is sure to become a keeper in our house where beans seem to be a 'terrain d'entente' for a vegetarian and a self-proclamed carnivore. I tweaked it slightly as per the way we like our red pasta sauces but overall it is wonderful as is.

Fantastic! My family and I loved it! It was simple for me to cook which I liked it was a nice quick Italian break from my regular cooking! I tweeked it just a bit I took out the carrot I used Tutorosso smooth tomato sauce instead of peeled tomatoes also I took out the macaroni and replaced it wih tubatini and took out the butter. I didn't have time to run to the store to get the parmesan cheese but otherwise it was spot on!

I make this a lot almost identically good stuff. But if you have a hard piece of cheese rind left over don't toss it save it; add it to soup while cooking to give more flavor. In fact add it to most any Italian style soup if you have it. It's one of the secrets of the universe.

This dish was super delish!! I am not Italian but I love me some Italian food. I will definitely keep this one for future use. I did make a few changes. I used diced tomatoes and a 14.5 can of tomato sauce in place of the whole tomatoes. I believe it is supposed to be soup like and a lot of the other reviews said it was dry if u follow the recipe exactly so I also used about one can of water and chicken broth mixed and added it with the diced tomatoes and sauce. I used the tomato sauce can for the water/broth mixture. Plus I used all the diced tomato juices instead of just 1/4 of the juices like the recipe calls for. And I didn't use fresh parsley I used dry parsley. I was generous with the parsley oregano and basil. I used the tablespoon and teaspoon to measure them out but I didn't fill the spoons completely. I also added about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste. I think that's it. Just keep adding water and broth a lil at a time to keep it the consistency u like. It still is a very simple recipe... And yummy!!

This was a really good pasta fagioli! (Fazul is how fagioli is pronounced!). Went together nicely...although I omitted the oregano as it makes everything taste like pizza sauce to me!!

I'm not sure what I was expecting but I thought this was just ok. I can't say I espcially cared for the cannellini beans. Husband wasn't wildly enthusiastic either. Oh well thanks anyway.

The flavor is very good however I agree with an earlier reviewer... I added all the juice that was in with the tomatoes and there was no juice left by the time I was to add in the beans. Therefore I added a whole can of tomato juice and some water. In the end I thought it was missing something so I added in some Italian spiced turkey sausage and that sent it over the top fantastic!!

This is a great recipe- my entire (Italian) family loves this and you can vary it according to what you have on hand and it still tastes as good. The Italian spelling of this recipe is Pasta Fagioli it was interesting to see it spelled phonetically

This was delicious! Perfect for a winter's night meal. My husband loved this very much. The only thing I did to change it up is as I cooked it I added water to it so it's not so thick and had more of a broth to it. Of course I seasoned to my liking. I could not find cannellini beans so I substituted white beans from a can and worked well. I also added a can of white potatoes. Made it very hearty and satisfying. Baked up some garlic bread to go along with it and was a perfect meal!

So I am vegetarian... my fiance isn't however... This soup is a great find for me - I just made some grounded turkey on the pan (with spices) and added soup mixture to that! Great dinner/ lunch for a guy! Also I didn't use any butter for a healthier recipe.

This was extremely dry and when I added more tomatoes and juice it tasted very bland. I ended up adding chicken broth and more garlic which helped a little.

Wonder soup. The only tip I give is I cook the pasta/rice and serve it on the side. If you plan on eating it the next day add the pasta in at warming time. I've had so many soups and the leftovers have swollen pasta and a dryer soup. Thanks for a great recipe

Just a comment. It is "pasta fagioli". It is pronounced "fazul or fazool". Fagioli means beans.

Chuckling at that phonetic spelling of "fagiole." It does sound like fazul but bean in Italian is "fagiole." Pasta and beans. I make this all the time and it's great--but we Italians also made pasta and peas my son's fave since he was a little boy. You use tubettini (little tubes) pasta for it!

This was very good. I wanted more of a soup so I added another can of tomatoes and the juice. I also used some chicken stock to thin it out. I added some crushed red pepper. I also cooked the macaroni separately. Lots of Parmesan. Served with cornbread this was a most satisfying meal.

My wife had to have a dental extraction; so I used this recipe but blended the vegetables and used tomato sauce rather than tomatoes I also didn't have any cannellini beans so couldn't have those. It was supereasy to make and really tasty would have been even better with some bruschetta and a nice red wine!;)

I liked the beans in it as it made it feel a little heavier for a meal. But really it was just glorified spaghetti with elbow noodles and took a lot more time than my own homemade spaghetti sauce.

I followed the recipe and had zero sauce and too many beans. If I make this again I will use two cans of diced tomatoes and one can of beans. The flavors were all there for this to be great just needs a little help.

This is delicious. One of our favorite soups. I did puree the tomatoes before adding them to the soup because I don't like big chunks of tomatoes. And I was out of carrot so I didn't add that. Sent a photo to my daughter while she was at work and it got her home for lunch.

based on the ingredients i had i went with PamHav's version of adding spagetti sauce chicken broth and lemon juice.. since i was adding premade pasta sauce i cut the herbs in half.. didn't have parsley so used cilantro instead.. after tasting once all the ingredients had been added it was more mexican than italian to me.. so i sprinkled on a bit of cumin.. SUPER yummy.. going to serve this straight up on the pasta w/o the butter or cheese.. im sure the original version was lovely but PamHav's really hit it home for us.. ty for the recipe and ty PamHav
