I was fiercely CRAVING chocolate that fit the keto and was satisfying...I tried other things and was disappointed. I tried this and it was EVERYTHING! It was quick and easy. The hardest part was waiting for the cream cheese to soften. I used xylitol as the sweetener and it was great. I took the first bite and felt a rush of satisfaction as relief. It was soooooo good! It was so good in fact, that even though the serving size indicates 1/2 recipe, 1/4 was fulfilling. Therefore, 4 servings instead of 2...YAY! now I can enjoy it 4 times instead of two...or share with 3 other people and be confident that it’s fulfilling. Thank you so much for this recipe...I can now move on with my day and not be a monster.

This was fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly except added a bit more cocoa powder and some melted dark bitter chocolate for a more chocolate flavor. I doubled the recipe and divided into 6 servings (our family size) and also made an easy bottom “cookie” crust  (combine & press on bottom of dishes:  3Tbs melted butter, 1c almond flour, 2tsp cocoa powder & 2tsp granulated sweetener—all Keto). My whole family loved it! So easy and delicious.

Choose a sweetener without etherol, it crystalizes and has a gritty texture when it hits the air, over night. I use Splenda or stevia; liquid sweetener is best or just add a little water at a time to liquify.
4 stars for this oversite

This was SO GOOD. Followed the directions and it was easy! 

Change: I wanted a double batch (for two days worth for two people) and I used 8 ox of cream cheese (a typical package) and one quart of heavy cream (two portions of what it called for, so that was easy too!)

This is absolutely delicious.  I have made two double batches in the past two weeks.  I divide the servings into glass desert dishes, sprinkle a few sugar free chocolate chips on top and cover it with press & seal. This stores just fine for 4 days without a change in consistency.  I omitted the vanilla extract and added a tablespoon of espresso instant crystals while mixing to make a mocha flavor...yum.  You could experiment with any extract to change it up a bit.  Delicious addition to my low carb lifestyle. Thank you for sharing!

Wow. This is so easy and crazy good! Made it exactly as written.  This is going to be a go-to for sure. I can see many little adjustments you can make to change the flavor a bit. (Not that it needs it)  I might just survive this Keto diet after all. lol

I was a little skeptical of this, because I really haven't had many keto desserts that I like! This recipe was easier than other keto mousse recipes I've found. It is SO good! It tastes like a mix between chocolate buttercream frosting and chocolate creme pie. This is going to be an easy dessert for me to whip up and take with me when I'll be tempted by holiday desserts at parties!

I used confectioners Swerve.  It wasn’t sweet enough for me so I added more.  It’s not as tasty as the real sugar mousse but I  can live with it!

This was delicious and kit that craving for something sweet! I used Swerve (NOT Splenda) and there was no aftertaste. I could swim in a bowl of this for days on end!!

I can’t say anything more positive than 5 stars. I added half coconut extract and half vanilla extract, then garnished with a pinch of coconut.

Horrible aftertaste, bitter and tastes of fake sweetener.  I made it exactly as written.  Too bad Splenda has been found to kill off gut bacteria because it would probably help this recipe a lot.  Husband didn't mind it too much.

Y’all. I made it for Valentine’s Day. My twin and I ate it all. I made it again the next day. Added spices. Less chocolate. The original recipe has such a STRONG flavor and I didn’t want that until I didn’t haven’t like that. Stick with the original. It’s PERFECT. Quick and easy!!! When I get sugar cravings I’m ready to tear the house apart. Thanks so much for this!!!!!

The chocolate mousse was delicious, exactly as written. I used another reviewer’s recommendation and layered this wonderful mousse on a “cookie crust” of butter, swerve, cocoa and dash of cinnamon. Thank you for sharing your mousse recipe with us! Perfect!

This was very good!  Good texture.  EASY!!  Next time I think I will try using lemon extract instead of cocoa (since I'm not a fan of chocolate) or maybe some extra vanilla.  There will definitely be a next time:-)

Hubby and I just started the keto diet, today is first full day.  I am playing with recipes  to find what we like and don’t like.  This recipe fits the bill, I will make again.  We used straight monk fruit powder about 1/8 tsp and 4 drops of liquid monk fruit.  Topped with fresh strawberries, hubby enjoyed thoroughly!  Thank you!

I have made this every week since I made it the first time a month ago.  On a keto diet and this completely satisfies my sweet tooth and chocolate craving!  Great and EASY recipe.

Wow!! This recipe was delicious and easy!!
It tastes like chocolate cheesecake. 
I doubled the amounts of all ingredients and cut the sweetener in half. 
I did what another reader said and used Monk Fruit Sweetener. Must pulverize the sweetener in a coffee grinder. 
I was just amazed how good this dessert was!!
Can’t believe it’s only 6g carbs!

I love the versatility of this tecipe!! I always have a sweet tooth and this was awesome! I made exactly as recipe called for, double batch, and I loved it! I was concerned because I didnt have a mixer, but a whisk worked fine for me,  thank you for sharing :)

I made this tonight for the first time and it was very easy to prep ! I used xylitol, combined it with  cream and stirred it with a fork to dissolve it a little before adding to cream cheese and worked out well.  I will add a little more sugar next time but this will be my go to recipe for chocolate cravings. I had enough to fill 6 ramekins.

I skipped the salt, but kept everything else the same. It's delicious, and takes less than five minutes to make!

It was perfect! I was wanting a quick, low carb treat and I had all the ingredients. The only issue I had was that I only have a big stand mixer. (Maybe if I had doubled the recipe, the big mixer would work ok?) I need to get a hand mixer for some of these smaller recipes.
I will definitely be making this again, trying the mocha variation some others have mentioned.

really good, really easy, added #reddiwip with raspberries.  I looked at nutrition after I ate it.  Yes, low carb but a little too high in fat.  will make again though!
