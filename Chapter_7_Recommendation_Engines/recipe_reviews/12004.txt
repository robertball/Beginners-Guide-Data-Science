THIS WAS GREAT, THO I DID CHANGE IT UP A TINY BIT..I ADDED THE TOMATO PASTE TO THE SAUCE WHILE IT SIMMERED INSTEAD OF TOSSING IT WITH THE SPAGHETTI NOODLES. I LIKE MY SAUCE ON TOP OF MY NOODLES..NOT ALL MIXED TOGETHER..JUST A PERSONAL PREFERENCE

Very good. Instead of mixing I pour the sauce over the spaghetti and top with parmesan. Sometimes I add black olives to the sauce. Again, very good recipe.

Great!  Followed to the letter except for type of pasta and was delicious.  Used red sundried tomato and herb pasta (so it was really red bowl!), which I'm sure added flavour, but spaghetti would be great too.  Tossing with tomato paste is a great idea.  Simple, chunky, tasty tomato sauce - whole family wouldn't have me change a thing (not even add olives!)  Into the recipe book it goes.

Great!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and added a jar of sliced mushrooms - delicious!  Next time I will add sliced black olives to salt it up a bit.  Tasted great the next day for lunch also.

The flavor is great. I didn't really read the recipe very well when I decided to make this so I missed that you were supposed to add water to the sauce. This isn't something I like to do because I can't stand watery sauce. I went ahead with the water this time. Ended up adding 3 T tomato paste to the sauce hoping it would thicken it up. I would make this again but sub tomato sauce for the water. Sprinkled with some grated parm and served with Garlic bread.

No changes here on this one, and perfect for the kids to heat up with left overs.  Great alternative to sauce from a jar, easy and you have control over the sugar content!

I had leftover portabella mushrooms so used those instead of green peppers. Worked great and was an easy recipe to make. Do not think I will be buying store bought spaghetti sauce again!

I was expecting to like this. It seemed like such an easy meal. It didn't have much flavor. Only change I made was adding the tomato paste directly to the sauce. I felt it needed it to thicken it up anyway. Never heard of adding it to the pasta. I ended up having to add some more seasonings, including some spaghetti seasoning. It surprised me with all of the good flavors in this. With the added seasonings and some parmesan cheese it will work fine for dinners or lunches. Just not a repeat spaghetti dish made exactly as is.
