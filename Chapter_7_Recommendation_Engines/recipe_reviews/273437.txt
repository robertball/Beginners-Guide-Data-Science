6.14.20  Admittedly, this was a Sunday lunch indulgence.  I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting Gruyere (would use again) for the mozzarella (none on hand).  The only negative I have is that I think there’s waaaay too much butter in this recipe.  After I filled the tartlets, butter was pooling on the top of the onions.  When I took them out of the muffin tin, my fingers were coated with butter, and the bottoms of the muffin cups had a layer of butter sitting in them.  Next time, I definitely will start with half the amount in the recipe, and if needed, add a bit more.  On the positive, they taste absolutely divine, seriously, they’re that good.  Also, very, very rich.  I’ve had this recipe on my radar for quite some time, and I’m glad I finally made it.  Jaime, thanks for sharing your recipe.
