I made this recipe, and it was really good.  I found these to be a tiny bit bitter, so next time I intend to use 1 Tbsp of instant coffee rather than 2.  I also used sugar free shortbread cookies instead of the ginger snaps, which reduced the sugar and carbs even more.  I replaced the fruit with a squirt of Redi-whip, and again, reduced the carbs.  I will definately make these again.
