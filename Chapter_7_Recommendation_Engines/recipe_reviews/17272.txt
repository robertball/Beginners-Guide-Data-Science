Many are complaining this dish is too salty. Don't use cooking sherry. It's loaded with salt. Use a good sherry, not necessarily an expensive one. Use a no salt added chicken broth or make your own chicken broth (it's easy to do so). That will cut the salt content, and there will still be lots of flavor.
Use other seasonings instead of salt to spice it up a bit. (Sage, rosemary, thyme, garlic, onion powder (not onion salt). It's easy to turn a salty recipe into something less salty. Good recipe, just needs tweaking to individual tastes. Don't be afraid to experiment with this one.

I reserve 5 stars for recipes that cause family and guests to NOT SHUT UP for days.  
     This is a foolproof 4+++ star recipe.  My family and guests commented numerous times throughout the meal how wonderful it tasted, and one guest just called again when she got home to say how good dinner was!
     As many other reviewers said, make 3+ times the sauce, add MULTIPLE TIMES FRESH PRESSED GARLIC (you can NEVER have too much fresh garlic), add some crushed rosemary and sage to your chicken flour (you need more of that than the recipe calls for too), DON't overcook your juliened vegetables or chicken (do veggies in the last 7 minutes of simmering the chicken), and skip the salt in the flour part of recipe because cooking sherry has enough salt.  Try oven baked potatoes w/ Lipton onion soup, crushed garlic, pepper, and parsley as a side dish.
     Serve chardonnay for dinner. Many compliments will ensue, I promise.

This was extremely good.  I added fresh mushrooms and used 3 garlic cloves.  Plus, I took everyone's advice and doubled the sauce. I might actually triple it next time because I let the chicken simmer for longer than the recipe stated (probably 30-40 min) and it soaked up the sauce.  The chicken was fantastic, but next time I'll use more sherry and chicken broth.  I served this over rice and it was fabulous. :)  thank you.

Very good.  I find if you slice the breasts thin and pound to a 1/4 inch you can quickly saute them in butter and olive oil, remove them to a warm platter, make the sauce and return the chicken to the pan for a brief simmer to merge the flavors.  I did not use flour to coat the chicken, but preferred to use a mixture of butter and olive oil to brown.  The butter gives an added bit of richness to the sauce.  I also sauteed the zuchinni and carrots in butter and olive oil and added a splash of lemon juice and sherry at the end to enhance the flaors.  I served on a platter with the vegetables surrounding the chicken and sauce spooned over the dish. Served with rice.  Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Very good!  After I dipped chicken in flour, I dipped the chicken in Egg to give it a thicker coating.  Then I cooked as directed.  My hubby loved it!

This was one of the best and easiest recipes I've ever tried.  Even after 28 years of marriage, my husband said this was one of my best!!  I added fresh rosemary and fresh oregano to the sauce after I added the chicken back to the sauce.  I bought the thick slices of carrots and added those directly to the sauce about 5 minutes before the chicken was ready.  I also doubled the sauce even though I only used two chicken breasts that I cut in half.  Awesome recipe!

Great recipe!! Excuded the flour, and used butter/olive oil instead; added more sherry, garlic & olive oil and used snow peas and fresh basil in last few minutes. Topped with fresh parmesan reggiano.

Regarding the sodium content in this recipe, it most likely comes from the chicken broth. I use organic low-sodium chicken broth which has only 70mg of sodium per 1 cup serving.

I simmered with the lid off most of the time.  Isn't a saucy recipe, so serve with a flavored rice of pasta side.

Husband and I both really enjoyed.  Very similiar to my chicken marsala recipe ~ just used Sherry instead for this one.  I also added mushrooms.

I was surprised how delicious this was.  I doubled the sauce which was great for the rice I served it over and I used 2 cloves of garlic, but the sherry was the dominating flavor.  Wonderful flavor, my husband made it on his own :)  I'm definitely keeping this one.

I LOVE this recipe. I used to do a variation of it which adds egg to the breading step and cutting up the chicken at the end and tossing with bowtie pasta. I have switched to this one because it is healthier and just as tasty. I add a little more garlic because I like it so much. I also like to add some chopped fresh basil leaves during the last minute or so of simmer time, it's a really complimentary flavor to the recipe and adds some flare to presentation if you are serving to guests. I like to sprinkle some black pepper over the chicken at the end and, if serving with pasta, a little parmesan cheese. Beautiful!

excellant- add pea pods if desired when zucchini if not available, use onion, garlic and 1-1/2 to 2 cups broth and thicken some. Good with pasta or rice

Definitely one to try. I added freshly sauteed mushrooms and asparagus (cooked but CRISP) instead of the veges suggested. It only took my chicken breasts about 6 minutes to cook, because they were so thin.  I removed them, made the sauce, let it simmer a little, and a few minutes before we ate, I added the chicken and veges back to the pan with the sauce just to warm through. Definitely use 3/4 cup sherry and 3/4 cup broth, or you will not have enough sauce. Served it all over very thin spaghetti. Also, added 1 Tbl Italian seasoning to the flour mixture and used white pepper instead of black (personal preference).  Came out delicious!

We've made this twice, and it's been very tasty both times.  The second time we substituted broccoli for the zucchini, as that's what was on hand, and it worked well.   Personally I think it needs a bit more sherry, but that's my preference.  Goes well with grilled garlic-rosemary bread.

A colorful and tasty dish.  I made the recipe with additional sauce to which I had added additional garlic.  I served the dish over vermicelli.  I'm looking forward to making it again.

This was pretty good, and I will agree that the chicken was very tender. I used tenders instead of breasts, and I cut the salt and used half broth and half water. I doubled the sauce amounts, and I substituted asparagus for the zucchini. I served it over couscous, and my family seemed to like it.

Wonderful recipe!! Fast enough to prepare after a long day at work, yet impressive enough to serve to guests. Don't make any changes, make it exactly how the recipe reads and you will have a great meal. I served it with couscous and a salad, it was perfect.

It was delicious the day of and two days later it was just as good! I added the veggies to the chicken and broth before they were completely tender and allowed them to simmer in the broth with the chicken. My guest loved it!

This is a fantastic recipe.  A great way to get the kids to eat the zucchini.
The sherry gives it a nice flavour.
Will be making this again often in the summer when I can get the fresh zucchini

I wasn't too impressed with this dish, and found it pretty bland. There's not much I would do to improve it...probably just find something new to cook.

I too added mushrooms. It is a fast simple recipe. I had lots of Sherry I needed to put to good use and this recipe fits the bill. Thanks to whomever submitted it.

Excellent...the whole family loved it. Not only delicious, but quick, easy, colorful and healthy! Will add this to my favorites.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of taking the advice of others to double the sauce. I sauted the veggies in a little chicken broth, that worked well.  I can see that this dish would work with any number of veggie combinations but, love it just as it is.  Thanks for sharing!

Just made this last night--what a simple, deliciously elegant recipe!  I used mushrooms instead of carrots, and cut up the chicken breast into strips, but other than that, I didn't change a thing.  While the chicken simmered, I sauteed the vegetables and cooked some long grain and wild rice--everything was done at exactly the same time.  The sauce reduced nicely and was just the right consistency.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.

Great, easy recipe. I used Sherry vinegar - not sure if it is the same thing as cooking sherry - but it tasted good!

Very good. I tweaked it a bit...I used 3 cloves of garlic to sautee the veggies with, and instead of zucchini and carrots, I used zucchini, broccolini, and portabello mushrooms. Turned about to be great. Boyfriend loved it.

This was extremely salty. Majority of the flavor came from the salt and pepper, which DH did not like at all. However, the chicken came out so tender. My picky 2 yo really liked it. I won't be making this recipe again.

This was a very fast and lowfat recipe. My family all enjoyed it. It had a bit of a kick to it but I think that was because I added 3 more garlic cloves, it was a bit too much. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.

This recipe tastes wonderful!  I added some sliced mushrooms in with the veggies and sauteed everything in the wine and broth.  The only drawback is chopping the veggies.

I substituted salt for adobo goya so it has some salt and other seasonings. I read some reviews of salty sherry wine. Pompeon sherry wine was not salty at all. Slow cooked for extra 15min for tasty results. Marinate chicken for 20 min in sauce before covering with dry ingredients. I was pleased with this recipe served over rice and vegtables on the side was deliciously cooked with same juices lightly. Mushroom added a plus with onion.

This chicken is fabulous! I made the recipe as stated except I only used two breasts because mine where huge. It came out so tender and delicious. I was mad that I didn't make 4 breasts as stated. I can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe. I will be putting it in my regular rotation. I never would have dreamed I could make something so delicious with basic ingredients I always have on hand!

Tried this last night and we thought it was very flavorful. Here is why it was not a 5 star for me:

The chicken was too peppery for my taste.
The sauce was not thick enough - so I added about 1 tbs of cornstarch.
I also just added the veggies few minutes before it was done so I don't have to dirty another pot, plus, the veggies also soak up the flavor. 
Lastly, I added mushrooms, just as the other reviewer suggested. Great idea!

I didn't care for this recipe. When you brown the chicken and then remove it from the skillet...then you add sherry, broth etc boil and then return the chicken to the skillet, the liquid make the crust on the chicken a big slimey mess. The flavor was good. What a waste of good food. :( Im so disappointed.

Made this chicken for my VERY picky family and it was so good. I read the reviews and did not add additional salt and added a lot more garlic. Before serving, I added some freshly grated parmesan cheese and served with couscous. They LOVED it!!

This was a good recipe.  I followed a lot of others changes.  1. I left out all veggies, but only b/c Hubby isn't a fan(a fine example for the children).  2. Tripled the sherry(real) & chicken broth, added lemon juice to taste.  3.  Added some chicken bouillion granules(maybe 1/2 tsp), salt & peper to taste.  4. 5 garlic cloves, large mince/small chop  Let simmer for a good 30-45 minutes for flavors to really come together & add a little of the left over flour to thicken it up a little. Served over angel hair.  Hubby was raving the rest of the night.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe-especially after all the time it took to prepare the vegetables! I added mushrooms and doubled the sherry and broth, served with quinoa and scalloped potatoes...the chicken was okay and so were the vegetables-but neither had much taste! after emptying my sherry bottle into this dish, I expected something more flavorful.

This was EXCELLENT. The chicken was juicy. I added onions to the veggies and I didn't cook them as long, keeping the veggies somewhat crunchy. The seasonings were perfect for the chicken. I did add extra salt and pepper to the veggies when I sauteed them in the butter. But even without my additions, it would have been an excellent combination of flavors. I will definitely make it again, next time with additional wine and broth as Michigan Mom suggested in her review.

Nikki...great recipe, thanks for sharing. It's delicious. This recipe is not salty if you use low sodium chicken broth. I substituted the veggies in the recipe for mushrooms and asparagus.

Mushrooms instead, 4x the chix broth but same lemon and sherry (real and DRY, not sweet, and def not cooking), gotta have lots of sauce over the noodles.  I would skip the flour on the chicken next time and just use a bit at the end to thicken, it simmers off the chicken anyway. I used the little bit of leftover flour to help thicken the sauce and added some minced parsley, one sliced shallot, and a pinch or two of cayenne. I used to make a pkt of Lawry's Sherried Chicken but they no longer sell it.  This satisfied my craving.  Doesn't hurt to stir in some sour cream at the end.

This dish was very good with excellent flavor.  But next time instead of putting the flour mixture on the chicken, I will brown the chicken in the oil and add 2 TBS of the flour and 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper to the sauce.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and added red pepper strips and sliced onion to the zucchini and carrots. I used regular sherry instead of cooking sherry. I will definitely make this again and it will make an impressive dish to serve to company, along with brown rice and a green salad.

This was a very good recipe; one that we will definitely have many times over.  We had it for Sunday Dinner.  The only inprovements that I made are that I thickened the broth at the end & also added more lemon & a bit of thyme.  I think the next time we will also add onion slices to the mix.  I used some dry sherry instead of cooking sherry as I only use table wines in my cooking.

Hubby liked this one. We were looking for low cholesterol with veggies but packing some flavor, and this delivered!

Tasty, and healthy to boot!  I followed the recipe exactly, but used cream sherry instead of cooking sherry.  Quite tasty!

This was fabulous!!  My whole family loved it!!  Chicken is so tender and flavorful!!  I cut chicken breasts into small, thinner pieces.
I made 2 1/2 lbs and used 3/4 C sherry, 3/4 Chick. broth, 2 garlic cloves, 1 whole lemon.
Also, for the flour and S & P in the bag, don't use a whole Tsp. of pepper...use about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon.  I did not add more flour and salt and pepper for the increased amount of chicken.  Used the original amount for the 4 servings.
Where it tells you to remove chicken, I did not do that.  I poured all of the sauce ingredients in there, mixed it up good until it came to a boil, then simmered on low, covered, for about 40 minutes.
Instead of zucchini and carrots, I used Broccoli cole slaw sold in the bagged salad section.  I made 1 1/2 bags for my family, left it on the side, instead of mixing it in.  Sauteed in 1 1/2 Tbsp. olive oil, S & P, garlic powder.  My kids don't like zucchini, but love broccoli, so that is why I chose this.  It was so great!  I served it on the side so they could choose how much they wanted to add to the dish.  Served it with Rice also.  Will definitely make again!

Awesome!  I served it over white rice & it was excellent!  I doubled the amount of sherry and broth because it reduced down so nicely & was yummy on the rice.  Next time I might even quadruple it!

Yum!  We loved this.  I do think that maybe 4 zucchini is a little too many for this dish though.  We did it with 2 and that was plenty!  But, we loved it.  It was super yummy!

I make this recipe often with my usual modifications of lots more garlic and instead of the suggested veggies I make sautéed zucchini and squash as a side. I usually serve this over rice. I do dip my chicken (I usually slice into thirds) in egg before coating in flour (unbleached) and add garlic powder, rosemary, sage, and thyme to the flour. Sometimes I add mushrooms to the sauce. I love the flavor of this recipe.

Oh boy. The chicken turned out very tasty, but I'm not sure how. I didn't have cooking sherry, so I subbed in red wine, plus I doubled it as per the "double the sauce" recommendation from other reviewers. Everything turned out completely purple--the chicken, the veggies, yep. Again, it was tasty, but I ended up with about two cups of extra purple liquid in my pan at the end of the story!

The family enjoyed this and my husband especially liked the flavour of the sauce. I used Lustau sweet sherry instead of cooking sherry and he liked the taste of the sweetness with black pepper I put it.  I felt something was missing, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Maybe I should have used some dry sherry too. I followed suggestions to increase the amount of liquid, and then instead of sauteeing the veggies, I julienned them and cooked them right in the pan towards the end. I also added mushrooms as suggested, and some leftover green beans. Good way to cook veggies. Also added fresh basil as suggested, and some dry Italian herbs.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end, since there was too much to really reduce down. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe.

I skipped the salt, used regular sherry rather than cooking sherry, tripled the garlic and doubled the sauce! I served it with brown rice. This is delicious, easy and tasty! I've made it several times since I came across the recipe, and it always gets compliments! My husband loves it. When he makes it, he uses the same tweaks as I do, but uses different veggies and serves it with rosemary new potatoes and garlic bread. It's great that way, too! A definite keeper.

This was very flavorful, quick, easy and healthy!  I took the advice of making more sauce but maybe I used the wrong kind of pan because I couldn't get it to reduce enough to used over the chicken.  The only complaint my boys had was there was zuchini on the chicken, I made them eat it anyway. :-)

Rating this a 3 because it was just okay, I forgot to add notes to the recipe after I printed it out to double the sauce, next time I will double the sauce and see what happens. It tasted good but with more sauce I bet it would taste better

Very Good. I used bone in chicken since that was all I had. I removed the skin and followed the recipe. I cooked longer to be sure it was done. Came out excellent and will make again.

My husband and I agree this is a "keeper."  I'm glad I read the reviews and used a good quality sherry rather than the cooking sherry.  I added julienned sweet red pepper to the veggies for color and texture.

It is way too salty, but by using Mrs. Dash's seasoning with the lemon is enough seasoning.  I also added Garlic Pepper (grinder) and left out the salt, and it was much better!

This dish was SO simple to cook, and is the best recipe for a juicy, tender, and savory chicken!  I added some wild rice on the side and poured the left over juices onto the rice.  YUM!!!

This recipe is a keeper! Easy and quick. The sauce is very tasty. I cut the recipe to feed 2, and it still made enough sauce. Sometimes when you cut a recipe there isn't enough sauce. I didn't cook the chicken in oil, I used Crisco Shortening instead. Will be making this again.

This was very flavorful. I didn't make any changes to the chicken and it came out great. I don't know why others said it was mushy, it was perfect. I didn't have time to go to the store to get the veggies and it was fine w/o it. Very good.

This was a delicious yet simple recipe. Like someone else mentioned the flour breading did get mushy. I may eliminate that next time. The only change I made was to season the chicken with a little garlic powder and Adobo (spanish seasoning) and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. Oh, of course I love garlic so I added 2 extra cloves to the broth.

I absolutely loved this chicken!! My 6 year old son wanted the leftovers the next day instead of pizza!! The carrots definitely need longer simmer time than the squash. My carrots were still a liitle hard and the squash was beyond mushy. But it was still delicious!! It will be one of my regulars...thanks!!

Chicken very moist. Wonderful taste and texture for a low-fat entree. I used lime instead of lemon. I reduced the sauce a bit more than I wanted to. Next time I'll make more sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I served the chicken, broth and veggies over vermicelli and sprinkled some fresh parmesan cheese on top. Other than that I didn not change the recipe at all. Very simple and very satisfying!

Very good way to use up leftover sherry.  I added twice as much as the recipe called for and it still turned out great.  Thanks for the idea.

1 10 18 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/17272/california-sherry-chicken/ ... Good, but I thought it would be better.  Surprisingly, not too much s & p in the coating.  I doubted, but continued. 
 Thickening the sherry sauce would be a good idea - or something to "share" it with - on a fork.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes and part of the reason I got hooked on Allrecipes.com!  I do not use cooking sherry, but the sherry I do use is not expensive either.  Sometimes I add the vegetable into the pan with the chicken, but be careful as I have overcooked my zucchini many times!

Tasty! After checking reviews I doubled the sauce and added it back slowly, halfway  during the 20 min cooking time . It is a little salty but it is tasty. I used low sodium chicken broth but only had cooking sherry.  I used chicken thigh meat instead of breast to increase juiciness. I will use this recipe as a basis for other chicken dishes.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of using dry sherry instead of cooking sherry.  My wife and I both enjoyed this and will definitely make it again.

Didn't care for this dish and probably won't make again.  Used good sherry and low-sodium everything so it wasn't too salty as others had posted.  Chicken was tender but sauce was too sweet for our taste.  Added mushrooms and shredded spinach during the last minute instead of carrots and zucchini.  We liked that part.

we loved it but I did add ingredients.  I went ahead and doubled the sauce part of the recipe because I like a lot of sauce.  And it lacked seasoning so I added like 1 T of italian seasoning.  I also added mushrooms to the other veggies.  I served with potatoes and next time I will probably do with rice or pasta and with bread.

Pretty good, and easy. It wasn't stellar, not something I'd crave, but I might make it again if I needed a quick supper and had the ingredients handy. Made it with two chicken breasts and about a cup of the sauce. Served with some steamed (microwaved) potatoes, which complemented it well.

The flavors were great and the chicken was really moist.  I used a yellow summer sqaush in place of the zucchini, but followed the recipe otherwise.  My only complaint is that after browning the chicken, cooking it in the sherry makes the bottom of the chicken really mushy.

My husband LOVED this dish. I followed some of the recommendations from this site and added sage and rosemary to the flour as well as to the sauce (which I doubled). I also left everything in the pan instead of removing it as I went along. I only used 2 zucchini, as they were pretty good-sized. Next time, I will probably add a little flour to the sauce at the end to thicken it up a bit. I thought it was too runny. I will also add mushrooms.

This recipe is VERY GOOD but I also made a few changes based on the previous reviews:  I made 3 times the sauce, and added some dried rosemary & oregano and a lil flour to the sauce before adding chicken back.  I steamed the veggies in a little bit of chicken broth before adding them to the sauce a few minutes before the chicken was done.  Served over rice.  FANTASTIC!!

Very tasty!  If you do just the sauce as listed it reduces nicely and makes more of a nice thick sherry flavored coating rather than sauce that you can drizzle......I will try to make more sauce next time and see how it does.  Made it with green beans (the kids don't like zucchini) also and a side of alfredo sauce and whole wheat pasta. Yum

This recipe is a keeper!  Simple and easy.  I steamed the julienned carrots and zuccini for just 2 minutes to save on calories.  Absolutely delicious.  My hubby agrees. We will definately make this again, and even for  company.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was a simple, healthy, and delicious recipe!  The sauce turned out a little thicker than I expected (from the flour), but all in all, the dish was still wonderful.  Thanx for sharing!

I didn't particularly care for this.   Perhaps I did something wrong, but the 'breading' on the chicken came out very mushy.   I didn't really like the flavor all that much, either.

Excellent chicken!!!  I made dinner for my in-laws for the first time and decided to use this recipe.  It turned out wonderfully!!! I substituted carrots for yellow squash and it was great.

I have made this dish two nights in a row, that's how good it is! It's simple and full of flavor. To thicken the sauce, I made roux. It is absolutely delicioous!

Wow!!  It was an excellent dish.  I added Shallot and used real Sherry.  I served it with rice and steamed veggies.

With a dietary fiber of 5.5 and only 284 calories you would think it would been NOT so good; BOY was I wrong. Big hit with wife she loves any food high in fiber and kids like it too.

So Good! Very flavorful.  I will have this again and again and again.  Also I used Roasted Garlic Chicken Broth and it worked great!

this was so so good!!! even my picky husband loved it!!! it was his first time to zucchini too and now he loves it! the reduced sauce tastes delicious....next time i'm going to double the sauce because i think it reduced too fast (too much heat during simmer)...the only difference i did was cut the recipe in half for just the 2 of us and used broccoli instead of carrots because husband does not like cooked carrots...

can't wait to make again! thanks!!!
