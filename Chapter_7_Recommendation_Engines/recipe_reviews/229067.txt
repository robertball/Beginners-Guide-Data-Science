This was a nice dish..I liked it. I didn't buy 3 1/2 pound of tomatillos.. at 1.99 a pound was pretty $. I bought half a pound, probably used a bit more sour cream and it was enough for 3 nice servings

This wasn't inedible, but it wasn't good. Kind of bland, for tomatillos, and the muenster was a weird choice. My family ate it, but suggested I never make it again.

I made this  Primarily for the green sauce so I did not use the teriyaki marinated. I did cook a jalapeno with my tomatillos and it turned out great. will definitely make again

I tried this recipe to use the tomatillos from our garden and thought it was delicious! The recipe made a ton of sauce, I think you could easily half the ingredients for the tomatillo sauce and still have plenty for all the chicken breasts. I also tasted the sauce prior to adding the sour cream and thought it was quite tasty without, but the sour cream definitely added a nice richness to the dish. I would definitely recommend this recipe!
