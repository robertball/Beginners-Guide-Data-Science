I used Fivebrigs recipes in the past and none have ever failed me.  Again this one's a keeper.  I used this during Christmas for our 18 lb turkey, it was marvelous! I brined the turkey 2 days before cooking it, then made the marinade and added sazon to it, rubbed it all over the turkey (under all of it's skin and body cavity) fridged overnite until ready to roast. I put it in a turkey bag slowly cooked it at 300F for 3 hrs, during which time I rotated and basted it every HR. Once it was ready I opened the bag to let the turkey crisp a bit and it came out so perfect. No need to carve it with a knife. It literally fell off of the bone. It was so moist and tender, everyone loved it. MMMMMMMM!

Buen Provecho! Gracias Fivebrigs, this is excelente. I added sazon to this and prepped a whole chicken as if I were cooking a turkey and baked at 275-300 for 2+ hours until cooked and the chicken was moist(it fell off the bone)and had a wonderful flavor.  I will surely use this again and again. Thanks

This marinade is delicious.  I used it to marinade a 2lb flank steak.  I though about doubling it, but left it as is...it marinated for6 hrs, and then I used the steak to make "flank steak pinwheels" from this site.  This was so good!  Thank you so much for sharing.

Fantastic and so simple!  We used this last night for our chicken for the grill (about 4 hours soaking) and loved it!  It keeps the chicken very juicy and the flavor was excellent (and surprising for the very few ingredients).  We will definitely use this one again and again!

FANTASTIC!!!! The only change I made was I reduced the salt from 1 Tablespoon to 1 TEASPOON. This was excellent!!! I marinated thin steaks for 8 hours and cooked them on the grill. The hubby RAVED how good they were. I never knew something so simple could be so delicious! Definitely a keeper!

I've never made steak before and I wanted something that was going to be tasty and good, so I decided to go with this recipe...Let me tell you that I cooked for 6 people and every single one of them loved it! I will definately be using this recipe again. I made a few changes: 1 teaspoon of salt, squeezed fresh lime juice and a little bit of onion powder. The longer you let it marinate the better it is. :)

CUT BACK ON THE SALT!!!!! WAY TOO MUCH!!!! Otherwise the recipe is very good :) I made this to put on leftover pork I had and had to rinse it off and start over. A half teaspoon of salt should be good (as you can always add more if needed) and a half bunch of cilantro blended in nicely when I put all the ingredients in my kitchen chopper :)

Delicious! The seasoning was just right for the 2.75 lbs of pork chops we had. Let them marinate for about an hour and a half and then baked (the weather was uncooperative). They were wonderful! Will definitely be using again. Thanks!

I tried this recipe the first time as described with beef and it was good, but the second time, I improvised a bit. I added some fresh chopped green onions (chives), a little white vinegar, a little Realemon juice,  substituted the salt with soy sauce and added a dash of worcestershire before blending in the food processor. I used a mutli-pronged spring loaded meat puncture tool to give the marinade a way to permeate the beef. I then threw everything together in a ziploc bag in the fridge  for 6 hours before cooking on the grill. My wife was amazed! Stuff was great! good luck....

I made this with two large steaks, I used one teaspoon of salt rather a tablespoon. It was so wonderful and falvorful as well. I was skeptical up untill I had mixed every thing and was adding it to the steak, then the aroma emitted. Needless to say the hubby came home happy! Thanks for this recipe! Just great.

This was good.  My dh was loving it!  I did make some changes to suit what I had.  I cut the oil in half as I only had three small steaks to marinade.  I also used McCormick's hot shot pepper instead of just black pepper.  I did think it was a little salty, so next time I will reduce it a little.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Made as written and it was bursting with flavor. Marinated 2 strip steaks. It was too salty. Would 1/2 it next time.

Way too much salt and too much pepper for my family.  If I were to make this again, I'll leave out the salt completely and cut the pepper down to 1 tsp.

This marinade is surprisingly good. I didn't have a chance to marinade it very long, but the taste was pretty flavorful. Great for a quick recipe.

Very easy - Very good! My family (including the uber picky 18 year old!) thought this was the best marinade we've ever tried. NOTE: I'm wondering if the 1T of salt is a misprint. 1t is plenty. And next time we make it we'll double the recipe, boil the leftover (after marinading) for 5 minutes, and use it as a sauce.

Who would have thought 4 ingredients would turn out so good!  I was thinking this would be too much garlic, but it wasn't...must make a difference how long you blend everything together.

This marinade was absolutely wonderful and delicious! My picky sister ate every bit of it.  I halved the black pepper and added just a little bit of cilantro and onion into the blender.  It came out great. Next time I will reduce the salt a little. Thanks again!

I was really surprised that such a simple marinade could have so much flavor.  I added the full amount of salt, but may cut it back next time.  I used the marinade for steaks that we grilled.  We only let the steaks marinade about an hour so I was even more surprised by the flavor.

Made this for chicken. Marinaded for about a day, and it was possible one of the best meals ever. Reminds me of Speedie Sauce marinade (Upstate NY thing, if you're familiar), but was amazing! Would give this recipe a thousand stars if I could. THANK YOU!!!

This was a great recipe for having only 4 ingredients.  I doubled the garlic, only because we are a family that loves garlic, and I processed it until it was of a soupy consistency.  I poured it over a London Broil and let it marinade overnight in the fridge.  My daughters usually want to use A-1 on their steak, but chose to pass on it this time.  I'm almost positive the marinade was the culprit.  Nice Job!

Wonderful recipe.  I used this for grilling chicken breasts for a large crowd.  I wanted something a little different than just regular grilled chicken.  I was very pleased with the taste and how it stayed moist.

It is sooo delicious.  I used it to marinate chicken and ribs, both overnight, and it added so much flavor to the meat.  Great by itself and as a base for barbecue sauce.

Absolutely wonderful!!!! I make this with chicken breasts that I marinated for only 3 1/2 hours. I am making chicken pesto foccacia sandwiches, but this is so wonderful on it's own. Next time, I'll use this for chicken breasts all by themselves. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe!

Wow!!  Thanks a bunch for this "keeper"!!!!  I used a pound of pre-cut beef ("for stirfry") and marinated for about 4 hours.  I poured all in a hot pan, cooked for a bit, drained off most of the liquid, then finished cooking.  Served on plain mashed potatoes (because the meat is a little salty!) and with steamed broccoli.  Got 5 stars from the Hubby!!!!!!!!  :-)   I also could have used the meat for fajitas too!

Followed this recipe exactly as written the first times. My meats & chicken turned out amazing!! Yes, the salt can be reduced to your liking, but I think that will definitely alter the overall flavor & results. I did reduce the salt by 1/2 and substituted a packet of Goya Sazon, instead. This was equally as good and gave the marinade a bit of a different flavor and some color. I gave this recipe 5 stars and have it saved it as my go to for just about everything.

I found this to be a good base.  I halved the salt to 1/2 TBSP. I doubled the rest and added  2 packets of Sazon by Goya.  I blended in food processor to combine well.  Enough for 14 porkchops.  I marinated for 1 hour in fridge, then wrapped in tin foil and grilled to keep flavor intact and chops juicy.  Just.awesome.  new family favorite.   Served with arroz con gandules and tostones.  Thanks!

I didn't use as much salt as was suggested.  I was hesitant about so much pepper, but went ahead and used it based on others suggestions.  It turned out great!  Only had about 45 minutes to marinade a chuck steak before I cut it into pieces and made it into kabobs.  Still turned out great!

This was pretty good, but somehow needs just a little "tweaking". I was afraid it might be too much pepper but that seemed to be fine. I've got hope for this recipe and I'm going to give it another try.

Great, simple recipe. We used this to make chicken breasts on the grill.  I usually avoid grilling chicken because it always seems so dry and bland (and I usually don't have marinade on hand), but this will definitely make for great picnic lunches.  Thanks! I love a recipe that uses ingredients that I always have on hand.

Simple tasty and inexpensive, my three favorite words. I thought it was excellent so did my hubby though he doesn't remember this particular mix of flavors while he lived in Puerto Rico. Still worthy of permanent place in my rotation.

This is the best as far as fast, simple, flavorful, no-fuss marinades go.  My family loves this for everything.  We've used it on grilled chicken, grilled pork chops and tenderloin, ribeyes, flat iron steak, flank steak, etc.  It is simple ingredients that I always have on hand and it packs a LOT of flavor!

This is a wonderfully simple but outstanding recipe.  I use it on chicken breasts and the thing that I love most is that I can make it last minute, marinade it for an hour then grill it up.  Most marinades take anywhere from 6 hours to a day.  So this is perfect for us!!

Delicious.  Very flavorful.  I marinaded 4 chicken thighs for 8 hours and cut the recipe to 3 servings.  I cut down the pepper to about 3/4 a teaspoon (for 3 servings) and only had about 1 teaspoon of minced garlic (cuz I was out).  It was a bit oily, but overall, exceptional taste and very easy.  I baked it in the oven for 45 minutes at 350.  Might add boiled baby carrots and potatoes next time around to soak up some of the flavor.

Oh we wanted to be WOWed by this recipe sooo much, but it turned out bland.  I tasted the marinade before adding the meat (a 1lb round steak that I marinated for 24hrs), and I thought it tasted great.  But all the flavors got lost once the meat was grilled.  IF I used this again, I'd doctor it with some dried herbs.
