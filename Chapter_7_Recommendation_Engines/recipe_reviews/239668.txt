After trying a new dish my grandfather never says he would like to eat it again, after adding rice cooked in chicken Bellini for five minutes it zipped the dish right up.

This recipe needs more views, it's amazing… the sauce you get from everything cooking together has so many layers to it… I've made this 3 times now

I used coconut oil in place and  instead of plain chicken I used frozen Italian flavored chicken and Italian flavored diced tomatoes bc it's what I had, and it turned out amazing! I loved it! my kids not so much but still a great recipe.

I used a couple fresh tomatoes instead of the can and I really enjoyed the dish. The left over Peach chutney is great warmed up on toast.

I wasn't sure I would like the peach-tomato combination, but I did.  This was a snap to make.  One person out of five served didn't like the tomatos and said he would make the recipe without, but I think it needs them.  Will definitely made this again.

I only had two, small, overly ripe peaches to work with but added some fresh mango.  It was good, but I would have liked a little more kick.
