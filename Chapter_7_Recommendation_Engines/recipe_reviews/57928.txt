I love this recipe and can't ger enough even though my family can live without it.  I did have to reduce the light soy sauce to 1/8 cup.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. All the measurements are perfect, and we add a little sesame oil as another reviewer suggested. We like to steam the cabbage slightly before tossing.

I thought that this was a very tasty recipe for cabbage.  In future I might use rice wine vinegar instead of balsamic, but I think the recipe works very well as is.

I loved this as is and then added a couple of dashes of habanero hot sauce to kick it up - I will keep making this with the hot sauce.

Very good. I replaced a little bit of the olive oil with sesame oil.  Next time I will try sauteing this as another reviewer suggested and then refrigerate.

I did not particularly like this recipe. I had halved the liquid because I had only half a cabbage and it wasn't that great...still a bit too much liquid. I felt there was too much soy sauce.  I think it might be good with the Balsamic Vinegar and olive oil and just a drizzle of soy but that's probably a personal taste preference. I love raw cabbage and I thought it tasted better raw then this recipe/combination.   I might try it again but use less soy and see if that makes a difference for us.  Thanks!

We really enjoyed this as written but you have to like cabbage to like it. This will pair up with a lot of different things nicely and I will definitely make again!

I sauteed the cabbage in the marinade for 5-7 min. (until just warm and tender-crisp) instead of serving it cold and it was delicious and simple.

7-8-11: Had to cut down on the proportion of soy sauce - Kikkomann.  Might be better to use a real light soy.  It was very good.
7-15-13:  Upgraded to a '5'.

I don't like cabbage, but I found this recipe to be tasty. I used only half the required amount of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar, as I'm not a big fan of either. I added freshly ground sea salt, and YUM! I shocked myself at how much better cabbage tastes in this mixture! Thanks for the recipe!

This isn't the flavor I was looking for.  Trying to get close to the flavor from a local Restaurant, Clearman's North Woods Inn.  But it was good.  Definitely worth a try.  Play with the oil and soy sauce before pouring onto the cabbage as your personal taste may not want as much as it calls for.

I steamed the cabbage for 1-2 minutes to soften it up, which I liked.  I also added a bit of sesame oil as someone else suggested but didn't like that flavor; I'll skip it next time.  This was a nice way to use red cabbage, and it tasted even better after sitting in the fridge for two days!

tasty. we steamed the cabbage as one reviewer suggested and also added the sesame oil and seeds, which i would definitely do again. 
next time i might make either raw, as the original recipe suggests or run under cold after steaming or blanching. it got a little too "slawy" but the flavor was great. 
agree that rice vinegar might be more consistent with the other flavors

3.5 - Easy and good.  It tastes like the cabbage salads w/ Ramen noodles w/ out noodles/other ingred.  I scaled it for 1 and followed the recipe exactly so for that a 5. I did add some dry ingred. - shred. carrots/onion, sesame seeds and peanuts. Thank you!
