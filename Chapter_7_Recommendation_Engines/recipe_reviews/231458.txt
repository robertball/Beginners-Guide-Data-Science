This was absolutely delicious, I couldn't stop eating it! I like to add cut up sausage to it as well, it makes an easy one dish meal.

I added the spinach with the tomatoes to wilt it a bit.  Everything came out wonderful.  I'm enjoying it tonight with a freshly roasted chicken.  Yummy!

Great side dish, happy with results overall. Next time I'll make a few changes though: cut potatoes smaller or pre-cook; add more mushrooms and a small onion; reduce the spinach a bit.

Great recipe and so pretty! I stayed pretty close to the original recipe except I used coconut oil instead of olive oil and I ran out of thyme... So I used a little more pepper. I also mixed both the spinach and tomatoes in at the end without returning them to the oven. Thank you very much for the recipe

I made this as a side dish - I swapped out the pine nuts for unsalted cashews. I forgot to buy the pine nuts when shopping. I cooked everything for longer than suggested - and I added the cashews at the same time as the cherry tomatoes - and I threw the spinach in about 5 min before removing from the oven. 

Amazing dish. Kudos to the recipe owner. I'll definitely crack this out again.

Healthy, flavorful, filling and beautiful to boot! The potatoes need longer to roast; remember they don't need to be completely soft as they have more time as you add in the other ingredients. I added a red onion to them because I had it. I sliced the shrooms into strips and pressed the garlic. I added the spinach with the tomatoes and threw in fresh basil because I had it. I'm looking forward to serving this again!

Great and fairly simple recipe! My family loved it! I'd cook the potatoes a little longer though and use more mushrooms and tomatoes next time.

Liked it a lot. I found that the leftovers (without spinach) reheat well in the oven on the same shallow roasting pan. I put the leftovers in the oven during the preheat and took it out about the time the oven reached 400.

When we did a month of plant-based foods, I tried this recipe, and it was a home-run.  

I made a couple of tweaks.  I cook the mushrooms separately, drain the water that comes off, then add S&P and a balsamic glaze.

The other tweak is to the spinach ~ when I add oil and S&P, I also squeeze a lemon onto it.

Our month is over, and this is still a big hit.

Yum!

This was an excellent all-in-one veggie dish. The only thing I did differently was put the dish back in the oven after putting the spinach on top to wilt it. Drizzled a little more olive oil on top, salt and pepper. Will be making this again!

I love this dish. Very tasty and visually pleasing. I added goat cheese to it and wilted the spinach a bit. I used roasted garlic avocado oil to roast the potatoes; I would also add the garlic cloves in with the roasting of the potatoes so they are nicely cooked and not too raw. A perfect side dish. Everyone enjoyed it

This is so good and so easy!  It makes such a beautiful dish, too!  I did add onions (onions make everything better) and used dried thyme.  This will definitely become a staple around here!

Quite good made as directed with the exception of pine nuts and added the tomatoes and spinach at the end to wilt a bit and maybe a bit more garlic.We added a piece of talipia and I would rate this very healthy.

Followed the recipe and reviewer suggestions very closely.  I roasted the potatoes for 25 minutes, flipping after 12.5.  I added Field Roast Sage and Apple sausage for extra protein 5 minutes before adding the mushrooms and garlic.  I did not have pine nuts so I substituted salted sunflower seeds.  I did not have fresh spinach so I omitted this step.  I'll probably add it to the leftovers.  This came out very well and I will definitely make it again.  Served with a green salad and a big red wine.

It was a very good side dish, but a little too garlicky. Next time I will use a little less of the garlic.

This was a healthy, easy vegetable side to add to any dinner! It wasn't strongly flavored so I may add garlic powder and rosemary next time.

This was so delicious and scrumptious. I've made some tweaks to it--I've used 2 portobello caps instead of the regular mushrooms. I also used petite gold potatoes and one red potato halved and then split in thirds.  I did forget to add the spinach in the end--but I do have leftovers to add frozen spinach for it. I would make it again.

So good and easy. You do not need this much oil. I used about 2 teaspoons total. More heart healthy and less calories. I subbed sliced almonds for the pine nuts cuz that’s all I had.

Added baby carrots and used 1 big tomato instead of cherry tomatoes.
Pretty basic roasted veggie recipe but good. Mushrooms are really good.

First night it was what that recipe called for. Not everyone like it. So I had to dress it up a bit. But it was a good base

This recipe was helpful, I also added onion and green pepper and served it with raw spinach and organic mushroom spinach quinoa which really brought out the flavors. Also I just minced the garlic and sprinkled it over everything. I loved the roasted tomatoes. Really great easy vegetarian dinner.

I fudged the recipe as I had a yellow squash I threw in and used fresh  basil with ground thyme. I did let it bake a bit longer but it came out great.

This was really, really good.  I served it as a side, but it could have been a whole meal by itself.  Love those portabellos!! I did throw in some zucchini and summer squash.
