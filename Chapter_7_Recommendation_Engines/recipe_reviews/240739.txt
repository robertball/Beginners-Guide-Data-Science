I'll be the first to say, this base recipe was EXACTLY what I needed! Thank you! I had some overcooked kidney beans and garbanzo beans and did a search for what I could use them for...this recipe is genius. I have a favorite garbanzo hummus recipe, so I altered just a couple items (fresh smoked chili powder, cayenne, turmeric, etc.) to taste. Love the addition of hemp...I use it to sprinkle on oatmeal and never thought to add it to hummus.
