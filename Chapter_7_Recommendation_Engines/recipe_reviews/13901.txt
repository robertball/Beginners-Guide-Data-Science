The hardest part about this recipe is waiting for all the flavors to meld.  I let it sit 24 hrs, and when I took a bite--it was worth the wait.  A truly great recipe and one that will go in my permenant file!  I will also add that I chose to freeze my tofu and then squeeze out the excess moisture--giving the tofu a firmer texture...and then making the recipe.

I used firm tofu and didn't drain it, and this was still a great recipe! It reminds me more of Toby's Tofu Pate than eggless salad, but it is at a fraction of the cost- which I love! I added some paprika to it to get some more zing out of it too. ***update: adding one diced jalapeno and some extra paprika and chili powder makes a fabulous version of the spicy tofu pate that I now refuse to buy for $4 a pint.

This was my first time delving into a tofu recipe.  Maybe it was just me, but I thought this was awful!  I threw it out.

This should really be 4.5.  For the record, I LOVE *REAL* egg salad, and I never used tofu in my own cooking before making this recipe.  I'll hand it to Jill - this is pretty darn close to the real thing.  It is absolutely critical that this recipe sit overnight (24 hours optimal) to let the flavors combine.  I can't stress that enough.  I ended up substituting curry for tumeric, white pepper for black pepper, and eliminating the sweet pickle.   (I never put it in my regular egg salad anyway.)  Also per my traditional recipe, I topped with paprika, and added two full stalks of celery and a half an onion.  *AWESOME.*  Thanks, Jill!

I used to spend $2.00 to $3.00 dollars a pint for tofu egg salad at speciality markets. I can't believe how easy and delicious this recipe is. 
I add 1/2 tsp dry mustard and use soy mayo. I also use fresh parsley. I've been eating this everyday since I found the recipe. Especially good with spicy onion sprouts!

I actually like the taste of this one better than the real stuff. I used silken tofu, capers, fresh dill, and 1/4 cup of vegan mayo. This stuff rocks!!! If you use vegan mayo, my nutritional calculator says that each serving has only 69 Cal and 2.8g of fat!!! Two BIG thumbs up for eggless salad!

Couple notes: if your salad was thin, you didn't drain the tofu enough. I slice mine in half, wrap it in cheesecloth, and set a plate with a 30 ounce can of [something] on it for at least 20 min, often longer.  That way it's dry and crumbly and able to absorb the flavors better.  We upped the mustard a lot, just out of preference, as many others have done with spice/heat.  But the recipe as is is as simple as a basic egg salad, and just as good.  My kidlet tried it right after I made it and loved it as-is, even before letting it meld for a few hours.  This is a great protein-rich sandwich filling, perfect for school lunches.  Oh, and we use Vegenaise, so it was completely vegan.  This recipe is going in the permanent rotation.

Delicious!   I was skeptical while mixing up this recipe, But, much to my surprise it was fantastic!  I stuffed it into a whole wheat pita & topped it off with broccoli-sprouts.  Great!

i am NOT a tofu eater but, in the spirit of getting healthy, i tried it....and LOVE it.  You should definitely wait a day before eating as the flavors do need time.

Wonderful and really simple to throw together! I had some as soon as I made it and it tasted just as good as when I had some the next day when the flavors had the chance to set in. I left out the relish and used lemon juice instead of the vinegar. Thanks for this!

I don't eat tofu but decided to try as was eating a vegetarian diet for a week and wanted something new to try.  I thought this was awesome!!  It has a great flavor and I followed recipe but left out relish as I did not have any on hand.

I gave this a 4 because I thought it was a bit bland following the recipe exact.  I added more relish and another tbsp of mayonnaise and it was perfect.  It is definitely better if you chop up the tofu really fine.  I had cubed tofu and I didn't like it until I minced it up really good.   After that it was awesome!!!!!!!!!  It tasted remarkably like egg salad.  My husband who scoffs at tofu even liked it.

Loved this recipe.  I like lots of crunchies in mine: chopped cucumbers, jicama, water chestnuts, or bell peppers, in addition to the celery.  Also, anyone who hasn't added a little chopped jalapenos plus some juice (from a can) after subtracting any sweet ingredients, is really missing something. -- Incidentally, I can't eat a regular "cooking onion" raw, but the Texas Sweet 1015 onion (Oct. 15th - planting day)is missing the chemical which tells some of us we can't eat raw onions.  It is delicious in lots of salads - without that nasty aftertaste.  Probably a cousin of the Vidalia.  Try one.

Very good spread, fast & simple to prepare, wonderful flavor. I added chopped pepperoncini (instead of pickles) & plenty of cayenne to 'zip' it up. Definitely a keeper.

I didn't like it.  I've been looking for ways to make tofu dishes and thought this would be a nice lunch.  I have yet to find a recipe that I can stand the tofu.  It would be unfair for me to give a lower rating though because I LOVED the dressing.  I will be using it for regular egg salad.  I will probably leave the tumeric out next time, wasn't crazy about it's flavor.

My tastebuds were fooled! I had some leftover tofu in my fridge and was obsessing over what to do with it, saw this and was like "nooooo...", but it really is fantastic.

Great flavor!  I made it just as written, and when I ate it, I put mayo and Dijon mustard on my bread, sprinkled a little garlic salt on the egg salad and put some sprouts on my sandwich as well... both my husband and I enjoyed it!

Wow!  REALLY good!  My husband still does not know this is not real egg salad.  I did try to sub the mayo with Greek yogurt as I have been very successful with that in the past, but it was an utter fail.  Way too sour.  So I did use real mayo, and I strongly recommend doubling the sauce, as the tofu soaked it all up and it was rather dry.  I also only used 1/2 tsp of turmeric as I didn't know if that was adding to the bitterness.  Skipped the dill & relish since we're not fans.  Served on toasted English muffins.  I will definitely make this again!

I'm not a vegetarian, but I have vegan family members, which is why I made this. The vegans loved it, and some of the non-vegans, too. They didn't know it wasn't "real" egg salad until I told them. I thought it was "ok," but I was little apprehensive making it (I don't often like what I make). Good alternative to the real thing, though.

FOR EGGLESS SALAD use Veganaise! You won't know the difference. I don't use this particular recipe but my own because I like a bit of curry in mine. The concept is great and the taste is best when you let sit overnight so the tofu can absorb all the flavor.

I added some Hungarian paprika and increased the amount of mayo since a lot of folks said this was too dry.  I like mine a bit on the sour/sweet side, so I added extra relish too.  The texture is soooo much like egg salad, and although it doesn't taste exactly like egg salad, it tastes pretty good.  Definitely eat this with toasted bread and sandwich fixings like lettuce, tomato, etc to get more of a sandwich feel.  Eating this by itself, you have a greater sense of how it does NOT taste like egg salad.

I really had to have an open mind to eat this after making it because Ive only had tofu one other time at a thai restaurant, but it tasted pretty much like egg salad and I did finish the whole container I made in about 5 days. I am not a vegetarian, just trying to eat healthier. I might make this again.

I am addicted to this stuff! For a completely eggless version, use Veganaise instead of mayonnaise. Also, I love to add cayenne pepper and minced jalapenos for an extra kick. I haven't had egg salad for over two decades, but even egg-lovers that tried my "egg" salad said it was  close! Thanks for the recipe.

I tried to eat this, but it wasn't the same. The texture was almost there, but the flavor of the eggs was not.

I am not a vegan or vegetarian; however this recipe was great.  I was looking to use of some leftover tofu I had and am so happy I came across this recipe.  I personally don't think you can tell that there are no eggs in it.  The flavors were wonderful and I even had everyone at work trying it.  Give it a try!

This was AWESOME! One of the few AR recipes that are above a 5! Let it sit for hours and hours, and I say be generous with the crunchy stuff, more onion and celery. I thought it needed more creaminess, so I added 2 TB of plain yogurt...perfect. I'll try making it with all yogurt, no mayo next time.

Not enough flavour for my taste; I did not try adding additional elements to the recipe, which may have helped.

This tastes just like regular egg salad, has the same texture, and has the same color (from the turmeric).  And you get all that without the harmful cholesterol!

Very Good! I used a little extra relish, rice wine vinegar(in place of vinegar and sugar)& dijon mustard.  It is best to refrigerate it overnight to get the ideal flavor.

I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS REALLY GOOD. I ADDED A LITTLE MORE ONION,SPICY MUSTARD,AND PICKLE RELISH. USED THE PICKLE RELISH JUICE INSTEAD OF THE SUGAR AND VINEGAR. YOU CAN ADD WHATEVER YOU WOULD TO YOUR REGULAR EGG SALAD.JUST MAKE SURE YOU LET THE FLAVORS BLEND TOGETHER. I PROMISED TO BRING IT TO WORK TODAY. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEIR REACTIONS. THEY'RE GOING TO BE SUPRISED!

This is really very tasty.  Be sure and use organic non GMO tofu.  Also be sure and add the turmeric.  I didn't the first time I made it and then I got some and added it the second time and it made a big difference.

I was shocked at how great this recipe was! I have enjoyed eggless/almost eggless egg salads before, but this one really knocked my socks off!
Highly recommended - a great vegetarian option for a cookout!

I used to buy eggless salad at Trader Joes' until they discontinued it. This is as good and a whole lot cheaper. I don't like sweet salads, so I left out the sugar and the pickle relish.I also added 1/2 tsp.of dried chives to make it taste like I remember.Don't forget to thoroughly drain the tofu or you end up with a soggy salad.

I would have preferred that the salad stay together more, but the important part is that this was the best tofu salad I have ever had and was very cheap to make.  This is a real keeper!  Thank you, Jill!

This turned out amazing. My husband was heard telling my 18 month old that he should eat his egg salad(he didn't know that this is tofu:) )......and that confirmed for me ..........that the title of the recipe is perfect. Thanks a ton for a wonderful recipe. I was out of onion this time but I will add it when I make it next:)

This is really good. I did the basic recipe which is tofu, Dijon mustard, and soy-mayonnaise. Just a dash of salt and pepper. I put it on a toasted buttered bun - YUM!

Now coming from a lacto-vegetarian, this was yummy. To me eggless egg salad, doesn't taste like real egg salad. The texture is similar, but the taste is different. So if you are looking for something that tastes just like egg salad, this really doesn't. But it does taste very good!!

Very nice alternative to real eggs.  I omitted the relish and onion (personal taste preference) and added some chopped celery leaves.  I did use the soy-based mayo product, and it was actually quite good.  I also took advice from some previous reviewers and added some dried mustard and a little dijon mustard.  Tasted even better the next day!  I had it on toasted whole grain english muffins with a side of fruit for a very healthy and satisfying breakfast.  My husband would not try it because he doesn't like anything added to his egg salad (celery, herbs, mustard...) so I don't think tofu and mayo would stand up on it's own, but with the flavorings it's very good.

I am new to the 'tofu world' and I thought that this recipe was pretty good. I added cumin as someone else had suggested and this made it much more tasty. If you think it is too dry than just add some more (low-fat) mayo. I will make this again.

What a great sandwich recipe. I didn't have time to wait the four hours for flavors to meld, and I thought it was great. Then when I ate the rest the next day, I thought it was REALLY great.

My husband (who doesn't like tofu) went foraging in the refrigerator, and complimented me on the great "egg" salad. His jaw dropped when I told him it was eggless. He did ask me to make it again, though.

This one is going to become a regular lunch for me. (And perhaps others as well!!)

Thanks for a great vegan recipe!

I'm not a big fan of tofu, but when I had a pound of tofu at my disposal, I found this recipe. It turned out great -- especially because it has nowhere near the amount of cholesterol that "real" egg salad has.  The only alteration to the recipe that improved it for my taste was using diced fresh onion and celery instead of the freeze dried or ready-minced varieties.  Great recipe!

I wasn't too impressed.  I kinda had to wonder...those who said it tastes "just like egg salad"...have they ever actually HAD egg salad before??  It definitley wasn't the worst thing I've ever had...but it certainly was not egg salad.  I guess I shouldn't be TOO surprised...it's made out of tofu  :P

Interesting! Easy to  make.  I think I'll try marinating the tofu in apple cider vinegar or some vinegrette before hand. I also added onion powder, garlic powder and I used a spicy dijon mustard. Let sit overnight to blend spices.

Wonderful!  I squeezed out the tofu using cheese-cloth, and omitted the relish.  I also halfed the parsley, and had to use mirin in place of the vinegar and sugar.  Will definately make this again.

By far the best tofu recipe I have had so far,  I thought it was light tasting and no one could tell it wasn't egg. I loved it myself and I'm a picky eater.

Like the others here, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this dish was!  I substituted Nayonnaise for Mayonnaise, and everything was quite good.  I think I will take the suggestion of a previous reviewer and use extra firm tofu (and perhaps dijon mustard) for the extra flavor and texture.

This recipe is a great base recipe, great for variations. I added a bit more onion and celery, and a lot more vinegar and mustard - to suit my tastes. I shared it with a few coworkers, and they all liked it, even the ones who were skeptical of eating tofu.

This is a great recipe.  I make a similar version but freeze the tofu and then 'quick-thaw' it in a colander by pouring hot water over it.  Squeeze out moisture with hands, crumble and proceed with the recipe.  The tofu has a textural difference that is like chicken or tuna flakes.  Kids love this sandwich!!

Perfect without modification; simple, healthy, and oohhhh so good!  Very deserving of 5 stars.  Great with crackers or on a sandwich.  Recipe doubles very well.

So delicious! I'm going to make this regularly. I skipped the celery and dried parsley because I didn't have any. Used honey instead of sugar. Added a dash of paprika. It was very crumbly which made it difficult to eat as a sandwich. It would do much better in a wrap.

I thought this was a very tasty way to eat tofu.  I have a very flexible palate which means I am willing eat just about everything!  I couldn't interest any family member to try it.  My daughter's vegetarian boyfriend tried it but didn't care to go any further.  For the vegan crowd I think this would be a hit and I would consider doing a smaller batch for myself in the future.  The flavors blended nicely.

alright.  this recipe is actually very good ... and is incredibly similar to eggssalad when it hits toast  hating mayo i substituted light greek yogurt... out of tumeric i substituted mustard powder, a pinch of saffron and a pinch of curry powder.  i skipped the sugar and used lemon instead of vinegar.

and.

it was great.

Excellant! Although I enjoy tofu, I was dubious of this tasting remotely like egg salad. Glad I tried it anyway because it's GOOD! My family has no idea and I'm not about to tell them they are eating a healthier version. I've made this a few times now and I've concluded the next round won't include nearly as much tumeric as it's a bit too yellow. Wonder if my family will notice ...?! Thanks for the wonderful recipe Jill!

I don't know how my experience with this recipe was so different from most people's, but I was very disappointed.  I checked and rechecked the recipe to see what I had done wrong, but I had followed it exactly.  This is the first recipe I have rated so low.  No one in my family is a picky eater, but none of us could eat this tofu salad.  Not only was it very dry, but the taste was bitter and very unpleasant as well.

This was extremely realistic to real egg salad. It was nice not to have to boil eggs and deal with that.  I do think it needed more mayo or something, it was a little dry.  Good time saver!

This recipe really deserves a 5 star.  I first made it several years ago, when I first turned vegetarian.  I was amazed by the taste!  I usually don't have celery at home, so I just increased the amount of the pickle relish.  It's perfect every time I make it.  Absolutely love it!  And my family did too.

This is an excellent recipe! Tastes great, and the texture and appearance is almost exactly like ordinary egg salad. 

I substituted a yogurt and cayenne pepper combination for the mayo, and added some chopped green onion in with the usual white onion. Refrigerating it overnight seems to  be best. 

It's good on a rye bread sandwich, with some sprouts and sliced onion. If you like spicy food as much as I do, sprinkle on a little cayenne pepper, too. I think I'll be making this often, it's great for lunch at work!

I've made this so many times and love it! Sometimes I use fresh onion and celery. Other times I get lazy and use celery flakes and dried minced onion. Each time it's fantastic. I did add hot sauce this last time for a little zing and it was great.

This was pretty good. Great choice for vegan but I'll save my tofu for something else and use eggs. I did add some cottage cheese from Deviled Eggless Salad this site.

I agree with SpecialK (Feb. 28, 2011); this truly is pretty darn close to the real thing.  Although I liked it immediately after preparation, I found that the waiting time does improve the flavor.  I have a "go-to" tofu egg salad recipe that I THOUGHT was pretty good until I made this.  The ingredients' proportions are right on.  I THINK what put it over the top was the real (Hellman's) mayo. Only two T. for the entire recipe..not a deal killer IMHO. My other recipe uses "fake" mayo.  Fake is OK for some applications, but not particularly for a recipe that already reduces the cholesterol tally by a landslide. As usual, moderation is the key to a healthy diet.  Jeninga75...try it with less or no turmeric if that ingredient is off putting, as it can be at times.  I will be making this again:)  Oh!  and I like the idea of using it on toast (brioche?) Perhaps add a crispy leaf of lettuce?  Hint:  Use a pastry blender/knife to mash the tofu.  Works like a charm:)

Very good! Press the tofu for as long as you can - I think I let mine sit for several hours. I ate it on flatbread, drizzled with either mustard or sriracha (the sriracha was amazing)! Thanks!

I really liked this, but needed more veggies in it to give it some texture.  Added about 1/2 cup chopped red pepper, 3/4 cup chopped celery, a little hot sauce, 1/4 cup grated carrot and 1 Tablespoon cooked garlic.

This recipe is wonderful! It is very close to tasting liek egg salad - I make it all the time. Does take atleast an hour for flavors to blend, even better over night. If you intimidated to try tofu try this - you will love it

Since discovering this recipe over the summer, I've made it at least 2x a month.  It makes a great light lunch - love the kick of turmeric in this recipe.  Can't recommend this stuff enough!

WOW! I have always liked egg salad but realize it is bad for you and i eat very little animal products. I can literally sit down and eat the whole thing. I only let it sit an hour before having some on toast. I used light mayo and added an extra TBSP. I also doubled the celery and onion because i love the extra crunch. Cant wait to try it again after it actually sits awhile. I WILL BE MAKING THIS ALLEAST MONTHLY. EXCELLENT! THANK YOU!

Very good, but definitely let it soak up the flavors for a good long time. Great with the suggested sandwich dressings. The only thing I'd change is I'd add a bit more mayo.

This recipe is amazing! I didn't have tumeric, parsley, dill weed, or celery so I used garlic powder and basil instead and it still turned out great. It almost tastes like 'real' egg salad. This is one recipe I will be making quite often.

I LOVE egg salad, and believe it or not, I love tofu. Raw! Several months ago, I removed meat, cow's milk, and eggs from my family's diet (and by the way, I lost forty pounds after doing it!) so to find this recipe on this site just made my day! It tastes GREAT! I think it tastes exactly like the real thing! I can't believe I didn't try this sooner! Two thumbs way up, from me!!

Ok, this tasted so much like egg salad that my mostly-vegan children didn't want to eat it because they thought it was real!  They said it tasted like the eggs grandma made them eat.  Ha, ha.  Really, that is a compliment as that is the aim of this recipe.  We're not big on tofu so I'm glad to have another way to use it.

My recommendations are to be sure you marinated for the required amount of time - the longer the better, and serve with lettuce and tomato if you're putting it on a sandwich or in a pita, or, as others have noted, serve it on a bed of greens.  I think the texture needs that bit of freshness to brighten it up.

Ok, this does NOT taste like egg salad.  That being said, it does taste GOOD. I make mine with chopped jalapeno instead of the pickle relish and I add a little extra mayo and some garlic powder too.  Yum... good on a toasted english muffin.

Doesn't taste exactly like egg salad, but has a good flavor on its own. I added a touch of cayenne for a little "zip." Tasted great on toast with sprouts and a slice of heirloom tomato.

I loved it!
I didn't have all the ingredients (celery & onion), but it tasted great just the same. I am not a huge egg salad fan, because I don't like the taste of the yolk and tofu as a substitute gives me the testure of egg but without the yolk taste. Thank you!

Reading other reviews that said people were fooled by this, I thought I'd give it a try.  I have fooled my husband before with tofu "meatballs", and thought it'd be great to try again.  He came home, saw that I had made egg salad & was so excited he grabbed a spoon & took a bite... only to immediately spit it out and express his profound distaste for it!  I tasted it, and while if you know it's tofu, it's not so bad... you really should still be aware that it tastes nothing like egg salad, at least not the kinds of egg salad we eat in this house (which is just about any type!)  Sorry to give such a low rating, but for us it just didn't work.

This is great.  You definitely have to like dill to enjoy it, but I really love having it on a piece of toast.  It's a great way to get some non-meat protein without sacrificing taste.

I really liked this. I am just beginning to use tofu, so I might love it if you ask me six months from now. I changed the sweet relish to dill relish because I prefer it over the sweet.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I have made it 3 times this month! I could not give in 5 stars because I thought it was too dry. I added alot more mayo(light). Also I have cut down alittle on the parsley. It is great with the veggies, but when I didn't have any it was still good without them.

This is great stuff! I've made several versions of this in the past, but this was a very good one.  I don't like celery, so I just substituted more chopped (red) onion.  The dill gave it a unique, refreshing flavor.  Fantastic!

I made this saturday and let it sit overnight. I had it on a sandwich yesterday and it was good but to dry and it needed more flavor. So i mixed up more of the dressing and added that to it and let it sit overnight again. It is absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Thank you for the recipe!!! I will be making this a lot!

This was good, but I used veganaise to make it truly eggless.  Next time I'll double the amount of veganaise and increase the sweet relish and spices.  It was a little bland.

You need to try this recipe!  It is delicious.  The flavors are spot on and - unless you are a fanatic about avoiding anything to do with tofu because you just have to have animal products - you will enjoy this immensely!
