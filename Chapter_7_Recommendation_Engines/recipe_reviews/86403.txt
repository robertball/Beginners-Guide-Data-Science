I've made this for years...I got the recipe from a Kikkoman cook book.  My family, including 2 picky kids, loves it to pieces.  The kids even take the leftovers for lunch the next day!  BUT you need to use about 1/2# spaghetti and double the sauce!

Bland and tasteless. Not worth doctoring, not when I have so many other good Asian noodle recipes.
