I don't know what happened, but it turned out like a large rock. I know that the yeast was good, but it obviously didn't rise. I added all the ingredients that were written in the recipe, but was very disappointed at the results.

Makes a very small loaf.  Would probably be better if the recipe was doubled and set at 2-pound light setting on machine.

I really like this recipe but am perplexed about why it rises beautifully until it is kneaded the final time.  It looks rounded and perfect until then. I am using bread machine yeast that is new.  The end result is a small, lumpy loaf.  Not pretty.  It tastes okay but it looks bad.

Nice bread.  Has a hearty taste to it.  I doubled this bc based on the few reviews, it appeared it would be a tiny loaf.  Hard to tell if this is the doubling or just how it is, but the dough was a sticky mess (I just used the dough setting on my breadmaker and baked in the oven) and it rose easily.  It almost overflowed my pullman pan, but I punched it down, then put it in the oven without rising again.  Looked beautiful and both hubs and I liked as is with a bit of butter.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have just taken the loaf out of the breadmaker. I've eaten 3 slices and could keep going! It is wonderful. After reading the previous reviews I added a touch more flour before starting the machine (about one eighth C). I used Canadian all purpose instead of bread flour. I checked the dough when the machine alarmed for adding items and it was a bit dry so I added a few drizzles of water. The final result is a lovely little "artisan" looking loaf that has a very very slight hint of molasses flavour that you might not even notice if you didn't know it was in the mix. It is not heavy at all, light with a crispy crust. Not sure if this had any effect - I always add about a tablespoon of raw sunflower seeds and half a tablespoon of ground flax to my breads. Try it, you'll like it.

I doubled this recipe to make the dough in my large bread machine. I had to add at least a half a cup more flour to get the dough ball to form correctly. It rose nicely. When I took it out to form into a loaf, it was a very wet batter, and I had to add about a cup more flour to get it out of the pan, off my counter and to form into a loaf. I then let it rise for 40 minutes and baked at 350. The end result looks like a nice, dense bread. However, there is no molasses flavor. Probably adding so much more flour resulted in needing more sweetner. It is okay once you spread on some jam or Nutella.
