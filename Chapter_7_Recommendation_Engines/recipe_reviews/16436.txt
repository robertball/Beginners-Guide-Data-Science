Any good cook will tell you it takes more than just one recipe to make a dish fabulous and this recipe is a good example.  I'm not crazy about cooking my prime rib with a mustard rub so I will stick with my basic salt encrusted variation, but the sauce recipe of this one is what makes this recipe stand out. Wow!!

I am not a prime rib eater, however my husband and inlaws are. This was my first attempt and THEY said it was wonderful.  HOWEVER, the Walnut Horseradish Cream was the BEST. I almost cut the recipe for that in half, however I didn't and my husband used it as a dip for crackers!
