Made it but it too salty so made some modification. Added 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 extra tablespoons of mirins to balance out the saltiness in the miso. Beside that sauce is very good.

This would be a great stir fry sauce for pork and veggies! I had to add a little bit more water so it wasn't terribly thick and I also added a bit of dashinomoto for a flavor boost.
