I can't believe I've lived so many years without knowing you could fry those soft tortillas...this recipe is fabulous, not just for the pork filling, but for all the possibilities. The pork was great, but I've since gone on and used ground beef, shredded beef, chopped chicken, shredded chicken, ground turkey. And then, just when I thought I'd exhausted the possibilities, came up with the notion to use chopped nuts and syrup, apple pie filling, cream cheese with strawberries, the list I think can go on and on. So glad I found this recipe, and yes, the pork version is terrific!

Very flavorful.  I roasted a 13 pound bone-in pork shoulder roast scored and rubbed down with salt, chopped garlic, about 2 tablespoons of liquid hickory smoke, taco seasoning and one 14.5 oz can of chicken broth and onions in the oven at 325, covered with foil, for 4 hours. When cooled enough to shred, I weighed out 3 pounds for this recipe and made shredded pork barbecue with the remaining (largest) part for a church supper. I served this recipe with soft flour tortillas (not fried, though I'm sure that would be excellent), fresh diced tomato, onion and finely shredded sharp cheddar.  I will absolutely be making this again.  Will roast in oven again, because it doesn't require checking on. Thanks, Carolyn Craft Kirkman!

I've been making these for years ... one tip -- instead of frying I bake them on a cookie sheet (sprayed with pam) in the oven (seam side down) for about 15-20 minutes on 375.  Just lightly brush the tops with olive oil.

It's so yummy! I made it in the crock pot and put in the refrigerator overnight  to allow the fat to solidify so I could skim it off. I reheated it the next day on the stovetop. I heated the burritos in my panini press. My entire family loved it! Served with homemade salsa and guacamole.

Made this recipe and it was very good.  We did not add the can of beans because we had one guest that does not like beans - rather we served the beans on the side. I believe this could be done easily in the crock pot also.  It did seem like a shame to discard the onions after cooking.  If done in the crock pot I would add less water and keep the onions in the final product.  I will certainly make this again.

My boys loved these burritos. I will make them again. I did not fry them though. I placed them in a very hot pan with no oil. Burritos went down in the pan with the seam down for 30 -40 SECONDS then turn over for another 30-40 seconds until crispy.

I made this recipe exactly as directed. Towards the end, I omitted the refried beans and green chilies for my kids (because they can be picky), then added the beans and chilies for myself and my spouse. The kids didn't like the burritos the way I had made them for them so I tried giving them the "real" ones and they loved them!!! I could not believe it! This is definitely a recipe I will add to my recipe box and make again!

Was very good & be sure to fry the tortillas, makes it yummy!  I used homemade Mexican seasoning from a local herb shop since the packaged ones are so salty.  I used light shredded Mexican cheese, and fire roasted canned tomatoes.  Tried a couple whole wheat wraps but they fell apart when trying to get the into frying pan :/.  I served it with diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, light sour cream and tomatilla medium salsa.

Excellent dish. Used fresh jalapeños as well as Cilantro. Added pepper jack cheese as well as the cheddar and a little sour cream. This will be made again.

I’ve made so many recipes off this site I don’t usually take the time to rate them. However, this one is a definite keeper! The only changes I made were to accommodate the ingredients I had on hand and time. I cooked the roast from frozen in an instant pot on manual pressure for 1 1/2 hours. I didn’t have refried beans so I used rinsed and drained black beans instead. Excellent flavor that the whole family loved!

We had half of a large pork roast leftover from Sunday dinner and I wanted to get away from the standard pulled pork sandwiches to use up the leftovers.  Glad I tried this recipe - way easy, way tasty and my leftover pork roast is history!  The only change I made (because I was using leftover pork roast, already cooked without the taco seasoning)  was increasing the 1 packet of taco seasoning to 1.5 packets directly into the pork filling.  Great with a green salad and sliced tomatoes!

The first time I made these I followed the recipe except I cooked the meat in the crock-pot (bad idea for pork btw) the second time I had left over pot roast and used that instead. I didn't have any green chilis so I added red pepper flakes for some heat and left out the cheese (we didn't have any on hand) but it was STILL delicious! This is a great way to use left over meat and make a completely different but yummy meal!

I really liked this. I did it a little different by cooking the roast in the crock pot and then following the directions as they were written. The filling was good and not spicy. I might use more peppers next time for the filling to add some zip to it. Frying the burritos was an excellent idea but I need to work on my burrito wrapping, since some didn't look very pretty.

I gave this 4 stars as I needed to make a few changes. Definitely a keeper. I made my own taco seasoning from this site, rubbed it into the roast, and cooked it in a slow cooker for 5 hours. I discarded all but 1 cup of the cooking liquid and the sliced onions,  shredded the meat and put it back in the pot. Used Rotel with chilies and the refried beans. Just kept the mixture on warm/low until we were ready to eat.  Great flavor, hubby loved the flavor. I also baked the filled burritos in the oven as other reviewers had done.

This was excellent!  I love to be able to just throws roasts in the crock pot.  I used a pork shoulder roast and put all of the ingredients in the crock pot except the refried beans.  I cooked on low for 8 hours and then shredded the pork.  We ate the meat in tacos tonight and plan to make burritos tomorrow night.  Can't wait to try it that way too!  I will definitely make again.

I buy the pre-cooked pork instead. If you use pre-cooked pork, then you will need to cook the onions or eat them raw. This is a major hit in my house!

Made this this evening.  It was delicious.  Change I made to recipe:  roasted in oven at 350 with seasoning mix, onion, garlic and chicken stock instead of water for 3 hours. Once wrapped in tortillas, I brushed them with some oil and baked about 20 minutes till golden brown. Will definitely make again.

This was a great start.... but I made significant modifications which made it fantastic! 
I didn't use a whole pork butt roast but rather a little over 3 lb. pork here in Kansas City, MO called "country-style ribs" made from thick-sliced (about 1") butt roast, the SAME cut, but cooks faster and can be cut into chunks later rather than shredding with a fork as with the whole roast..
I seared  the meat first, which gave a nice subtle brown to the meat and I was able to drain off fat as I cooked the pieces in batches.   I HIGHLY recommend this step as it significantly reduces unnecessary fat!   Additionally, using the thick cut pieces significantly reduced the time when boiling the meat versus the time it takes to boil a whole butt cut.
I added a couple tablespoons frozen  orange juice concentrate to the cooking water, I also added chicken  Better-Than-Bullion, along with a little extra chili powder, cumin and a very  generous amount of chopped fresh cilantro.  This addition was huge.
Again, cooking time will be reduced since the pieces are smaller. than the whole roast.
When the meat is done, remove, place off to the side and cut into chunks, not shred.  The first time I made this, I made the pieces smaller than I should have and had meat in cooking pot when the later steps were done.  This was a mistake as the meat cooked up into the rest of the ingredients. So leave meat separate and add meat to the pot at the end of the final step.

Pulling the pork apart is tough when you boil a pork shoulder, but the burritos themselves were quite yummy.

I like the great flavor and juiciness that pork provides these burritos. I used a 4.5 lb. pork  shoulder roast and cooked it a little longer. I was confused about adding water every 45 minutes. I thought I was supposed to keep it submerged the whole time and ended up with a big pot of water. I will probably make these again because they are easy to make. I served these with guacamole and a southwestern chopped salad.

I made it using pork tenderloin and roasted it in the oven for 4 hours at 250 degrees. It was delicious and my guests loved it.

I made this exactly as called for in the recipe,  except I cooked the roast in my new pressure cooker. The burritos turned out  excellent; moist and flavorful. Being a novice,  (recently widowed), I am looking for recipes that are economic, easily prepared and taste delicious. This recipe fit the bill perfectly!

I bought a pkg. of assorted pork chops, but they looked so odd, that I put them in the crock pot   and used this recipe ( about 8 hrs. on low) and the meat shreaded and was very tasty. I only had small flour tortillas so I made 3 per person and lined them up on a plate to fry. As everybody came home they  plated  3 tortillas added sour cream, salsa and fresh cilantro and ate them. Next time maybe they will let me fry them FIRST. I might even try using the pork  shoulder roast.  Every one loved them. Thanks for the recipe!

not a fan of this recipe but it was okay wont be making it again though, used boneless pork and didnt add more taco seasoning than 1 package, used the crock pot to cook it on high maybe made differently it would have came out better but I just dont like the concept of this, not a fan of mexican.
