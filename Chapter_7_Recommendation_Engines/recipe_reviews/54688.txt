Wow!  Let me start off by saying that I didn't have all the ingredients called for so I had to do some substitutions.  Instead of Cider Vinegar I used 1/2 Red Wine Vinegar & 1/2 Balsamic Vinegar.  I also didn't have Jalapenos, plus I had to feed this to my kids so I used Yellow Peppers instead, which are much more mild.  I also didn't add all of the mayo cause I ran out, but it was only like 3 tablespoons short, which turned out perfect.  Once I was done putting it together, I decided to add a little handful of cilantro since it seemed like a good match.  [Great choice by the way!]  This Mac Salad was OUTSTANDING.  I really, really liked it & I am NOT typically a Mac Salad fan.  I will definately make this again.  Infact, I can't wait to make it for my family who loves spicy stuff.  Thanks for the recipe!!

We loved it - this can be spicy.  If you are having company I would suggest making another macaroni salad along side this one for those who don't like spicy and kids.  I ended up trying Mom's Macaroni Salad (on this site) and it was a perfect compliment to this one.  No mayo and on the sweet side.  Both are keepers!!!

I really liked this recipe because it doesn't have alot of mayo, which I don't like. I doubled the recipe using 1 16oz bag of shell pasta. I added chopped red bell pepper and chopped olives for color. I thought using 4 jalepeno's would be too much, but I chopped them finely and it was perfect, I love the faint spicyness. I will definetly make it again. Thanks Hawaiian Momma!

It has been years since I have made macaroni salad and I usually make the recipe off the Hellman's jar.  This was good.  I was a little concerned with the amount of vinegar in the sauce because it had an overpowering smell, but it gelled in the end and was fine.  I only used 1/2 of a jalopeno because mine were HUGE, but I wish I had used the whole thing because for some reason when they are chopped up fine they are not that spicey.  I think you have to make this several hours ahead so the flavors have time to mix  and the sauce firms up.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

So very tasty. I added a tablespoon of sweet pickle relish.    Either way it's a wonderful dish.

We loved this!!  Even made it with potatoes.  And the surprise of the jalapenos, you never know just how hot it's going to be. And definitely double the recipe.  The leftovers are just as good.

i absolutely loved this recipe, and so does everyone who tries it! the spiciness is a surprising change that sets this recipe apart and makes it memorable. i changed a few things: i used regular onions instead of green, chopped up a red bell pepper for color, added fresh cilantro, and used fresh ground black pepper instead of white pepper. also, if you want to make this even spicier, DON'T take out the membranes and seeds- that's where all the heat is!
anyway, thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Oh gosh, I hate to be the party-pooper here...
This salad came out better than most...however, I had to make a few adjustments.  I started right away by cutting the vinegar in half.  Also, it was a bit too salty for the men in my house, so next time I'll only add salt to taste. To this recipe I also added a tsp. of pimentos, a tad more sugar and a finely diced carrot. With my changes, I'll probably make this salad again!

EXCELLENT mac salad.  The spiciness of the jalapeno really gives it a fresh twist.  Used about 1/3 jar of sliced peppers (minced them) and it came out with just the right heat.  We could eat this all the time.

Great basic recipe.  To make it healthier, I used fat free mayo, cut back to 1/2 cup, and 1/4 cup of fat free plain yogurt.

Have made this recipe 3 times now and everytime with rave reviews.  The only thing I do is one jalapeno not two because hubby can't handle it.  I would never add any other veggies to this recipe its not that kind of recipe. Its a hawaiian mac salad.  Not a veggie salad, not a mac salad with mustard like my mother use to make (yuck)   5 stars for the hawaiian mac salad that reminds me of the islands and the plate lunch/loco mocos  :)

Good idea! 
I used a little less mayo.
I used 1 small fresh chili peppers instead of jalapenos (thats what was in my fridge)
I also added: Celery, Yellow pepper, cherry tomatoes, and cilantro.
This made for a very fresh tasting macaroni salad! Thanks for original recipe

Ok, just so no one messes up on this; use CIDER vinegar!! DO NOT SUBSITUTE ANY other type of vinegar, or you will regret it. I used balsamic, and it RUINED it!

Great recipe -- has just enough "bite" with the cider vinegar to remind me of the macaroni salad I grew up with in Chicago.    I only used one small jalapeno, tossed in a very generous tablespoon of pimento and one rib of celery.    I will make this again.

Also added 1/4c of celery.  Used apple cider vinegar instead.  Husband was amazed how good it turned out.  For those of you who don't like the heat, keep out the jalapeno seeds!

I loved it!  I like spicy food.  I had a jar of sliced jalepenos'.  I tried to figure 2 of them and figured how hot can it be...so I added 1 more....It was spicy but AWESOME!  Nice kick to it!  Will definitely make again but this time I will follow the recipe.  LOL

I tried this because it sounded different from traditional macaroni salad. I was afraid it would be the jalapeno that was the turn off but the vinegar was so horrid in this that we all had only 1 bite. Sorry for the bad review, but we wouldn't have even given 1 star. The mayo ratio to the pasta was right on and the times and cooking directions were too.

My family loves this macaroni salad. The peppers give it a nice kick. Sometimes I'll add tuna or shrimp to it, just for a little different taste, but it's good on it's own. I do, however, use less salt than the recipe calls for. Plan on making it tonight. Yum. Yum.

This is a great way to establish your own macaroni salad by following the basics of this very easy recipe. I would have liked to try the jalapenos, but didn't have any. I did however, have the traditional jarred pimentos. Nice picnic side dish.

I make this salad only using the listed ingredients.  It is perfect just the way it is.  Adding a little of this and a little of that changes the recipe.  Keep it simple.

this was good. I thought the jalapeno would be dominant heat so I added only one jalapeno and an anaheim chili. I also added some eggs. (I had leftover deviled eggs in the fridge so i chopped and threw it in) It was real good. The jalapeno is barely noticable. I wish I had of followed the directions. Even my son commented about the great taste of the new additon (jalapenos) to my mac salad recipe.
I cant wait to try it tomorrow once all the flavors marry together.

I love this recipe! I've used this as a 'base' to my macaroni salad, sometimes subtracting the peppers, adding pepperoni, cheese, and/or celery.. whatever's in my fridge at the time.  But it always turns out great!

We alter this recipe a bit, but still enjoy it very much. We don't use the jalepenos or white pepper and cut the apple cider vinegar by half. What I add to this recipe is reg pepper fresh garlic, olives, and dill relish. I also vary the mayo based on how it tastes and consistensy.

We love this recipe and use it all of the time.  We prefer it without the jalapenos and add a grated carrot instead, which is more like the plate lunch mac salad we get in Hawaii.

Simple and delicious!  My husband and I are playing with a few variations now, i.e. adding celery, bow tie pasta instead of macaroni.  Just a great simple recipe, thanks!

Nice flavor with just the right bite-- which you can control by making the sauce first. Was a tad dry as a leftover so if you're making a day in advance you'll want to keep this in mind. We really enjoy this with sloppy Joe's. Thanks, Kim!

I made this for a bbq we had at the health centre I work at and it was a huge hit.  It was easy to make!  I made a triple recipe and I am glad I did.  I did add sliced black olives and an additional three red hot peppers for color.  I will definitely make this again!!

Thanks Kim for sharing this recipe! This was great, tasted wonderful and easy to prepare! I'm living overseas and couldn't find jalapeno peppers so I used mild red pepper instead and it came out perfect!

Fantastic macaroni salad. I made this for a potluck but wasn't sure how spicy this would be and I was making it for people I didn't know so I decided to skip on the jalapenos. As some suggested, I substituted with a 1/2 cup of finely shredded carrots and a small jar of diced pimentos. I also threw in about 1/2 cup of diced ham. It was a big success and had to promise the family I would make it again.

I have used this recipe a lot. I use my food processor to finely chop the jalepenos and red onion (instead of green onions). I use rice vinegar and add a couple boiled eggs chopped up. I use a couple more jalapenos and 2 Serranos.  My family loves it

It was alright, but it had too much of a mayo-like flavor.  We tried it a day later and it tasted better but then the macaroni soaked all the sauce.  I would not make this again.

This was fantastic! I was purposly looking for a pasta salad recipe that was out of the ordinary and this did the trick. This is slightly spicy, which I love, and so simple to make. I did use pickled jalapenos and threw in some pickled hot cauliflower and added red pepper for color. But the sauce portion, I didn't change a thing and it was wonderful! Will make a staple at my house from now on.

Doubled the recipe and added 3 chopped hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 a minced onion (in place of green onions), a splash of spicy mustard, and 1 green bell pepper.   Delish!

Made as directed except for the addition of a little shredded cheddar.  Could probably use a little garlic.  We enjoyed it.

This was really good and gets 5 stars because it was also very simple.  It was pretty good (maybe 4 stars) on the first day, but even better on day 2.  My family loves spicy food, even my young kids, so this was pretty tame.  I made this recipe as is, it wasn't too wet or too dry.  It had plenty of flavor.  So easy that this will be a "go to" recipe in our house.  I also love that these are ingredients I usually have on hand.

Delicious!!! Only thing I did differently is I never drained my pasta and added it when it was hot, that way it absorbs the flavor better.

I made this cut in half to start... but GREAT! only thing I don't agree with is adding sugar. I am not a fan of a SWEET macaroni salad (adding sweet relish would be good enough in place of sugar). so I skipped the sugar. everything else came out wonderful!
only other changes I made- I added the sauce ingredients to taste (the mayo seemed off, like it was not measured right...). I also added a pinch more pepper, and a pinch of paprika. 
what I LOVE in a good macaroni salad is diced cheddar cheese... so I diced up about 1/2 - 3/4 cup cheddar and threw that in- YUM! 
also, no jalapenos for this one. just doesn't fit. I diced up 1/2 a green bell and that worked well, along with some shredded carrot. also used black pepper instead of white. but the pepper is still needed. 
great recipe, but just needs a little TLC to fit personal preferences/tastes.

This is my family's favorite macaroni salad - we love our food with a kick and this recipe is great! I use the jarred Old El Paso jalapeño peppers instead of fresh. Sometimes I add a little celery too. Thanks for sharing!

I don't rate recipes that I change the ingredients to because that would be rating my own spin on the recipe, so I made this recipe as stated and it turned out delicious! I was afraid that it wouild be too salty because I tasted the dressing right after I made it, but the key is to let it sit for at least 30 minutes. This recipe looks beautiful and tastes great, just like we have here on the Hawaiian islands with a little kick. I am so looking forward to making this again. Yes, you can add/substitute your own ingredients, but this recipe is great as is also!!

I have to say I like the spice of the macaroni salad, but I find the cider vinegar taste to be too strong when prepared as specified.  I don't believe I will make it again as written, but may combine some of it with another recipe

This is fantastic!  I did not have elbow macaroni so I used fusilli.  Nor did I have peppers so I used a half-cup of pickled hot banana peppers.  I did not add the vinegar as the peppers had a bit of their own juice.  It was a hit!

This was great.  However, I added regular onions, red and green bell peppers for color.  Also, it came out super spicy but I forgot that our home grown jalepenos are on the hot-hot side.  But I'll be sure to use this recipe again.

Truly delicious!  The white pepper and the cider vinegar (as opposed to regular pepper and vinegar) really MAKE it.  I didn't have any green onions, so those were omitted.  Next time I'll chop up some red pepper and zucchini to throw in it!

This was a fantastic recipe!  I used one jalepeno and a yellow pepper just to add a little something 'extra'.  It was delicious, although the next time I make it I'm planning to add some cubed marble cheese just to add another flavor!!!

I did not have cider vinegar and my husband doesn't like it anyway...  I used balsamic vinegar and it was great!  Had a different flavor than the normal mac salad.  I used red onions instead of green and used 1 T. of sweet pickle relish.  Also used Tony's instead of reg salt.  Good!

This is a great simple macaroni salad.  If your looking for a lot of flavor probably not what your looking for.  However, if your looking for something that everyone will enjoy.

I liked this twist on a traditional macaroni salad.  I didn't have the fresh ingredients on hand so I removed the seeds from some jarred jalepenos and used 1 tsp of onion powder (McCormick has one that is white and green onion powder with parsley).  I will use less jalepeno next time though!

I don't eat macaroni salad but made it for a picnic with family who like spicy dishes. Everybody loved it. I had the foresight to put the recipe in my pocket and can't remember how many copies were made that day.
Thank you

Love the heat in this salad! I did make a few additions that I thought would enhance but I give it a 4 star rating because the base alone was delicious! I added bacon, red pepper, and a cajun hot sauce(Dat sauce-2 tbspn)  It was a hot with all family members. Keeper for sure!

Yum, yum, yum! I stuck mostly to the recipe, but used 2/3 mayo, 1/3 Greek yogurt, and included a finely diced red bell pepper as well as a bit of finely diced celery. Also, I don't keep white pepper around, so just used black. I meant to include chopped olives, but didn't have any. Next time!

I followed the recipe except for a healthier twist. I replace half of the Mayo with Greek yogurt. Also this great non-spicy as well. Some chipped cornichons add a similar texture without heat. This is go to in my kitchen. My teens and hubby really enjoy it, and I skip paying so much at the deli counter.

Excellent! I made it exactly as suggested in the recipe. I would have given it 5 stars but it is a bit sweet for my taste, so next time I will omit or cut down the 1 tsp sugar. Also, next time I will reduce mayo a bit as well.

Absolutely love this! I’m a picky macaroni salad eater, and this stuff is so delicious and so easy to make! It’s not very spicy, and the jalapeños add a nice fresh crunch! I made this with Barilla brand gluten free macaroni and cheese for a yummy gluten free macaroni salad! Goes great with Hawaiian food!

One of the best recipes on this website!! Can make macaroni salad for 1/8 th, the cost of buying it it at the store. It taste's WAY better than store bought. No chemical aftertaste like some store bought products have. I just add some julianne cut carrots and cheese to the recipe. Awesome!

Big family favorite....super easy and inexpensive to make for parties, etc.  Usually add more of the sauce as a bit dry for me as is.  Add a little bacon or fresh tomato in season.

I love this simple yet so tasty recipe. However, because I only had large macaroni elbow, it was somewhat dry and bland at first. So I whipped up a second batch of the mix (one jalapeño only, based on other reviews), added minced red bell pepper for a little crunch and color, and it made all the difference. It was a hit. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I've made this recipe a few times now.  The first time I cut the vinegar in half because I'm not a big fan. I had to add extra seasoning because it seemed bland. The next time I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Sometimes I'll add a little garlic power because we love garlic and if you want a complete meal just add some tuna or chicken.

Amazing!! This is my first review! I cut half vinegar like everybody said.. and I added some hard boiled eggs!! Ridiculously good.  I made it for a BBQ and everybody loved it, I kept going back for more, I think I gained weight from eating 8 servings.

I made this following the recipe but with additions. Had some serrano honey vinegar that I mixed in with the cider vinegar, also added 1/4 cup Red Duck Sweet Mustard Peppercorn BBQ sauce. Shredded carrot, finely chopped : yellow bell, celery, black forest ham, cheddar cheese and cilantro. Celery seed to taste.  Double batched and gotta say this was one of the best mac salads ever.  I cut back Jalapeno slightly....if you cant find Red Duck it's very similar to a Carolina style bbq sauce.  Enjoy!

My husband loves this macaroni salad.  The only change I make to it is to add finely chopped yellow onion instead of the green onions as this is his preference.  I refrigerate the cooked pasta for a couple of hours before adding the dressing. Also, I do not add all of the dressing to the pasta.  I reserve some until I am ready to serve it and then add the rest.  Otherwise, I find that the pasta absorbs the dressing after it is prepped but before it is served and then the consistency is not as wet as I would like.

Nice and simple. Taste clean and bright green.
Later I added fine chopped celery and fresh ground pepper.

I didn't actually like it, at all :(.  It wasn't the taste I was going for, but my hubby didn't mind it.  I think using cider vinegar was the biggest mistake for my taste buds.

I'm so glad I came across this recipe.  I've made it many times and it's by far my favorite.  It has so much flavor ;  the jalapeno and onion really set it off.  Will be making this for years to come.

1/10/16 - I made this tonight for dinner to go with smoked chicken.  Boy am I glad I did!  We like spicy food so I probably added more jalapeno (pickled by SIL, had no fresh on hand) than called for AND IT WAS GREAT!!!   Husband loves Mac salad but said this was the best he has ever had.  Really raved about it.  I did substitute Splenda for sugar, but no other changes.  Buying fresh jalapenos and more green onions ASAP!! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!
1/13/16. Had to make a double batch today,  with fresh jalapenos as what I made yesterday is already gone.  Will be sharing with BFF and her family!
3/4/16 - Have made this several times.  Use a mini food chopper for the jalapenos and you get more heat and flavor.  Made it in Hawaii for sister & BIL,  and they don't like a lot of spice, but both got into this!!  Making it again today.

I was making the recipe and realized it called for jalapeños and I have some, but they are too spicy for me, but everyone else can eat them. So instead of jalapeños I put in about 1 tablespoon chili powder and a 1/4 cup celery and used twisted egg noddles instead. Tastes amazing. My boyfriends mom is VERY picky and she is in love. I WILL be making this again.

Made exactly as described, with gluten-free corn elbow macaroni, this was a little too vinegary...  so I just added another tsp of sugar and that fixed it.  It sure was easy!

Very good, and very easy. This is a great recipe on it's own, or it can also serve as a wonderful base recipe, easily customizable. I made this dish for a tailgate party and it was the most popular side dish by far.

I used half apple cider and half balsamic, doubled the recipe and added red bell pepper and cubed up some sharp cheddar.  I only used one large jalapeño though. Love flavor, not burn. Will definitely use this again! Thanks for sharing!!

My family loves this!  I use shell pasta, omit the jalapenos and add bacon bits, but those are the only changes I make to this recipe.  My family refers to it as "pasta salad" not macaroni salad.  I think that's one reason they enjoy it so much.  It's a great simple recipe.

Love it! My first time making mac salad and was delicious. The only thing I did differently was adding about 8 cherry tomatoes cut in half because I thought it Otherwise the recipe was exact. So so so good. Can't wait to make it again

Loved this.  A nice and quick macaroni salad that's very flavorful.  A nice change from potato salad.  I've made it just as the recipe read.  I've also made it with more veggies like celery, carrots and radish's chopped.  No matter what you do with it, it will come out delish!!

I love this recipe!  It is the only macaroni salad that I make now.  I usually double the recipe to use a box of pasta and it gets eaten so fast!  I cut the amount of sugar in half.  I agree with other reviews to make it a day ahead.  Yum !

Very good recipe, but I did not have green onion on hand so used sweet onion and yellow peppers instead of jalapenos. I also used a whole box of wheat rotini noodles so I tripled the sauce ingredients. I also used less vinegar and still found it had a strong vinegar taste so will use even less next time.

omg. Kim will you marry me? I had to put the spoon down slowly and walk away before I ate it all. admittedly I do really like my mac salad to be a bit "vinegary" so to me this was perfect! I used a full cup of mayo though, because well, i'm also a mayo girl. I had to leave the jalapeno out because of my kids, but I used extra green onion and celery and its still amazing. If I was going to bring this to a party or bbq I might add red and yellow peppers just to give it some color. but this was great thank you kim!

I gave this 5 stars because I think it's a great basic recipe that cooks can easily modify with whatever they have on hand.  I used rotini pasta because that's what I had on hand and wanted to use it up. I used only 1/2 teaspoon of salt, added two finely shredded carrots, and minced half of a red pepper. My version looks very pretty.  The taste is mild as I did not add any jalapeño peppers.

I would also like to add canned tuna to this or canned salmon.  

I think it's a very good, basic recipe.  Thanks, Kim.

yum I usually don't comment but this time I have to.  My mom usually makes out salad but she is in another state. I added a little more vinegar no peppers.

It was awesome!! I may use less vinegar next time because I don't like the smell or taste, but that won't stop me from making this again. I plan to take it to work if I can get my husband out of it!

I just had to add two hard boiled eggs and little more sugar. Seemed salty. Then it was good.

I tried this right after I made it (before chilling), and I really didn't care for it!! I was so disappointed, but I just had some now - 4 hours later - and I love it! 5 stars. I changed some things based on what I have on hand - red wine vinegar and chilies instead of jalapenos, and brown sugar instead of white.  I might eat the rest of the macaroni before everyone else gets to it...

I love macaroni salad and have eaten so many different varieties but this is hands down my favorite.  I use fat free miracle whip in place of the mayo and only use 1/2 cup, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly.  It is AMAZING!  I have it at least once a week.

This is a very good salad and will become my standard macaroni salad recipe.  I took it to a family picnic and it was great. Because of the mixed group I only put one chopped jalapeno in it, and I also, for fun, used extra large macaroni--easier to get onto a fork at a picnic.  I had made a big batch and had leftovers, which kept well in the fridge. It was still good when we finished the last of it ten days later.

The white pepper was TOO much!  Maybe I'm just not a fan of that flavor, but I think it would have been much better without it.

I needed a simple tasty noodle salad and this definitely fit the bill!  I had jarred jalapenos to use up, so omitted the salt.  Added some relish, omitting the sugar.  To add crunch, mixed in chopped celery and white onion.

I love this recipe because it is foolproof and adaptable.  I deleted the sugar and salt and added green bell pepper, green chopped olives, 2 oz. jar of chopped pimentos drained and patted dry, mustard, and chopped celery.  My husband and I can't get enough of it!

This salad was good in my opinion but not great. I am a macaroni salad lover (I'm the only person in my household that does), but this to me seemed like in spite of the jalapenos it was missing an element. But, it was good overall, and I would make it again in a "I already have the ingredients on hand" situation.

Delicious, but very sweet. I think the sauce would be ideal for cole slaw. But made with the right dishes, it is perfect.

Used white wine vinegar the first time I made it and cider vinegar the second time and didn't notice much difference.  Also, used 3 jalapenos (trying to use them up from the garden) and didn't find too hot - the vinegar must cut down the spice.  Added green onion and celery.  This is my "go to" macaroni salad from now on!!!!!

Thanks for the great recipe.  My son does not like side salads but this worked for him.  He loves spicy jalapenos so I was very happy to find this salad recipe.  The whole family loves it and it will be a salad I add to all of our family get togethers.  Thanks again

This recipe is a great base to be modified to personal tastes.  Can use other noodles such as Rotini, add sweet pickle relish (will give more tang) both of which I do.  I used Vidala onion (what I had on hand), used 1/2 c. mayonaise and 1/2 c. Miracle Whip and added 3 hard boiled eggs, chopped.  I will add celery when I have it handy.  Left jalapeno peppers out (we love jalapeno peppers) but not sure I want it in my macaroni salad.

I stumbled across this recipe on accident really because I just so happened to have all the ingredients and was looking for a macaroni salad to make for dinner. It tastes (and looks) like your traditional macaroni salad, but what makes it interesting is the spicy aftertaste. If you're not a fan of heat, this probably isn't the salad for you or you may need to cut down on the amount of jalapeno. I like spicy food, and I thought it was spicy.

I didn't have the ingredients on hand to make a traditional macaroni salad (like eggs and celery), so I decided to try this. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it and added a handful of fresh chopped cilantro as recommended by another reviewer. (Oh, and my jalapenos weren't fresh. They were the jarred jalapeno slices which I diced up.)  I LOVE it. It came out fantastic. My husband and I love spicy food and this was just the right level of spiciness. It wasn't too hot so that it wasn't enjoyable but it had a nice kick.  Bonus points for the fact that my MIL does not enjoy spicy food and thus hated it.

I was looking for a macaroni salad recipe that I had all of the ingredients for and I found this one. I had everything except green onions. It's very good, and simple to make. My husband loved that there were jalapenos in it for a little extra kick. Will definately make this again. I actually thought it had really good flavor.

I loved the spicy kick provided by the jalapeno peppers. It's a novel idea for a pasta salad and works well. My wife and dinner guest also thought it was very good. I added half a small jar of pimentos added for color. I did substitute no-fat Miracle Whip for mayo. I doubt that regular mayo would move the recipe to five star, but I will leave open that possibility for when I try it with the full fat stuff.

I chose this recipe for a group from my church to make and serve for another church group. I have never received so many complements and requests for 2nd servings, ever.  Don't be scared off by the jalepenos, I just cut them down a little for the proportion listed for 60 servings, we could have made 100 servings and still run out!!!  It was great.

This turned out great! I changed it up a little because i didn't have all the proper stuff. So i used 1/4 cup mayo 1/4 cup salsa and 1/2 cup ranch dressing. It turned out awesome!

Spicey!  I think I used a serrano pepper by mistake and the store didn't have white pepper anywhere so I used a fresh ground black pepper mix.  I would reccomend reducing the mayo slightly, I thought it was a little heavy.

I really liked this macaroni salad.  Was simple but tastey.  Instead of cider vinegar I used plain white vinegar.  I would suggest adding this last if you don't use vinegar often so you can adjust to you own taste (start small and work your way up).  I also used Light Miracle Whip instead of Mayo.  Cut's drastically down on calories and adds a bit of zing.  I added a bit of green pepper, extra onions, and just a smidgen more or salad dressing.  Turned out great.

This recipe was really simple and pretty good! I cook by taste so I added things here and there. But the simplicity is what sold me on the recipe.

I thought this recipe was great.  But, rather than use a fresh jalapeno...I just used jar jalapenos.  I also added a celery so a bit of the crunch wasn't always biting into a jap.

Really good! I tend to not like the over the top mayonaise though so I used a little extra macaroni but it turned out great. The spice from the jalapenos was just right. I'd say next time though I'd consider adding a little more pepper or chile peppers or maybe even cumin because it felt like it was missing something.

If you like something with kick, this is it.  Be warned this is not for the indigestion sufferers.  I ended up making 12 servings which called for 4 jalapeno's but scaled it back to about 2 & 1/2 which was MORE than enough. I also added celery and pimento for color and texture. Very good but unfortunately 3 bites and I was reaching for the pepcid.

Great recipe, I only had to make it a cup of mayo instead of 3/4c.  Macaroni is a little dry if you don't add the extra mayo. the flavor is wonderful.

Personally, we like our mac. salad with more vegetables than two. Try celery, peas, maybe some grated carrots. Give it some body, so that people know they are eating salad.

It turned out great.  I was just looking for a basic recipe to go with a cheeseburger plate.  It's a Rochester, NY thing.  Basically at the end I would be pouring a Texas style meat hot sauce over the macaroni salad so I left out the jalapenos and added celery.  I also substituted with white vinegar.  It really turned out excellent.

This recipe got good reviews by friends but seemed to need more flavor.  I would make it again with a few small changes.
