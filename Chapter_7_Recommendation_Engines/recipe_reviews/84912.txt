This is a fantastic twist on the average party dip. Good with stiff crackers (like Wheat Thins), as well as veges.

Here are the variations I use. (This may solve the saltiness another reviewer mentioned.)
* Half the recipe.
* Add sour cream (about 1/4 to 1/3 C if you're halfing the recipe).
* Substitute 1/4 C of chopped green ONION for the green olive.

I blended the cream cheese, sour cream and shredded cheese in a food processor first. Then stirred in the other ingredients by hand. Spread in a shallow dish. Garnished with a sprinkle of paprika and a tiny mound of chopped black olives in the middle.

This was good.  Definately different than any other appetizer I've ever made.  The only downside - just a little too salty for me. Maybe next time I would dd garlic powder versus garlic salt. Thanks

This is a very good dip however this is a large batch and would recommend cutting it in half if you have other appetizers with it.  I also added in onion since I can't seem to live without them.  This is the second time making this.  I made last summer and it was a hit.  I think I added onion automatically.  I also added a little sour cream to soften the texture.  This is a great recipe it is a keeper.

This was a great dip!! Everyone that tried it has asked for the recipe. I did cut the recipe in half because I only made it to satisfy a craving. It was so good I took some to work to share! The only thing I would do differently, like another person suggested, is to add some sour cream to the recipe to soften it up.

Was looking forward to trying this recipe. However, flavor was not my favorite. Would recommend as others to cut amount in half.

First of all this recipe makes a ton of dip.I would say it makes about 5 cups. Second of all it’s not good. All you can taste is olive and cayenne pepper.  I had already made it and didn’t want to waste so many ingredients so I doctored it up with more salt and more mustard and I just hope that serving it on a wait then will add some extra flavor, but it’s not wicked good but any means. Trust me, don’t waste your time!
