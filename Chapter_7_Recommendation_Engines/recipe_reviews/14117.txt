I boiled 5 huge potatoes, Whipped them up with the cream cheese and sour cream. Then I mixed in the garlic powder and a bunch of green onions,and the cheddar cheese. Then baked - I don't know how long - I wanted the top crisp so the last 5 minutes I turned the oven up to 375. They were SO DELICIOUS !!!  If you try these don't forget to add the green onions (or Chives) because it made a BIG difference.(Also 1 Pkg of cream cheese is plenty) These are Super Yummy !!!

I loved the fancy potato recipe.  I did change it up a bit.  Used 1 8 oz. cream cheese instead of 2.  Used 8 oz. Hidden Valley Ranch dressing instead of the sour cream.  Used 2 cups of Kraft Montery Jack and Cheddar Cheese.  It was already shredded which made it nice.  I also used a little more than a pinch of garlic.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe Janet

This is nothing out of the ordinary but is a good, basic, cheap mashed potato recipe to follow that I will make again.  The only change I would make is to mix the cheddar cheese in before putting it in the oven instead of layering it on top.  The cheese sticks together when you layer it on top and you end up eating big globs of cheese instead of having the cheese mix in with the casserole.

I thought these were fabulous and my 4 kids ALL raved about them. I only used one 8 oz. package of (light) cream cheese and I omitted the garlic salt. I used fat free sour cream also. Take it from someone who can spot fat free and reduced calorie a mile away.....You will never know the difference! Terrific recipe. Thanks!

Upon reading other reviews for this recipe, I also used only 1 package of cream cheese, which seems to work out so well.  I also added a little milk to help with creaminess.  I also used a different type of cheese blend on the top, and this worked great as well!  All in all I say this recipe was fun, easy, and delicious to make.  It turned out wonderful!  The taste is exceptional for mashed potato lovers!  A great recipe, thank you!

This was a great change from mashed potatoes.  I did make some minor changes though.  Instead of cheese I use a bread crumb mixture for the topping. Also, I used half the amount of cream cheese.

Wonderful potato dish.  I did not whip the potatoes, but cut them into small cubes, just personal preference.  Added some garlic powder, minced onion, parsley and some cajun seasoning to spice it up.  Was like a twice-baked potato casserole.

These are simply wonderful.  They are easy to do and taste like you did a great deal of work. I added bacon pieces on the top for texture and color and reduced the cream cheese by half. I will definitely make these again.

4.5 stars from me! Made for easter...used a small bag of small yukons (maybe 15 or so- all the store had). Used only one bar of cream cream (light) and about 2/3 cup of light sour cream. Then mixed through a large handful of finely shredded cheese. Came out great especially when warm - got thick after setting on the plate for a while and getting cold. I just used a masher not a mixer, and I cut them up before boiling. Thanks!

Pretty good but FAR too rich.  I would cut the cream cheese at least in half.

An interesting take on mashed potatoes!  I liked the fact that there was absolutely no butter in the recipe, which always made me think twice about reaching for a second helping.  I used light cream cheese and light sour cream and it still tasted just as rich (I still thought about that second helping!) My husband doubled the recipe but only used 2 1/2 pkgs of the cream cheese, instead of 4.  He really enjoyed this!  I only gave it 4 stars because I think it's best enjoyed "day of" rather than leftovers.  We'd make this again.

I had about 9 potatoes left in my bag, so just went ahead & used them all in the recipe. I also sauteed one small onion in butter & added that, along with substituting garlic powder (1/2 tsp) & also added about 1/2 tsp salt & 1/4 tsp black pepper. I did only use one pkg of cream cheese, & mixed my shredded cheese into the mixture, instead of putting on top. Very good.

I had a small tub of cream cheese with onions and chives that I wanted to use up so i used that along with some regular cream cheese.  I added garlic and onions.  I used some Tilamook sharp cheddar that is white - it made them taste great!  (I had never bought that before - it was all Costco had for cheddar cheese and it was highly superior to my regular cheddar cheese.)  Good recipe that you can tailor to your own tastes.  Not low cal though - even though it has no butter - cream cheese is equal with butter in fat and calories.

I took the advice of other readers and cut the cream cheese in half as well as mix the cheddar in the mixture instead of entirely on top. I also used garlic powder, salt, and fresh black pepper to add more flavor. Everyone liked it and it was still nice and creamy the next day. I will make this again in lieu of traditional mash.

I served these potatoes with a meatloaf and my husband said, "Don't lose this recipe."  Although, you must allow time for the potatoes to cool, it was well worth it. Five Stars *****

Delicious! Since I had fairly small potatoes left I ended up using seven instead of five, but I left everything else the same. Tasted great, easy to prepare, and leftovers are wonderful too. I will have to make these again sometime because my whole family loved these! Thank you for sharing this recipe, LnJJ.

Great recipe. . . I used it as a base and added pancetta, fresh parsley and many more spices. If you have potatoes and don't want the usual this is a great recipe. I suggest adding your favorite things to it in addition to the exact recipe.

So So good I read the reviews and the only things I changed were I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and I mixed half the chedder cheese into the potatos then put the rest on top. I also added 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese mixed in and about 1/3 cup green onions. And sprinkled the top with black pepper before baking. So great will make again and again. Oh yeah one cream cheese is plenty.

This was DELISH! I love how its sooo easy and quick to do. Next time I'll add a bit of milk to make it creamier. Plus this recipe will turn out great with any cheese you have in your fridge. I even used sliced american cheese and everyone lived it.

My husband couldn't stop talking about these.  I cut back on some of the cream cheese just to fit what I had but it didn't affect the taste.  They were easy to make and delicious.  You can't go wrong with these potatoes.

These potatoes are so sinfully scrumptious I almost feel guilty making them.  Especially since I end up eating at least three helpings of them!  EXCELLENT!

Love it!  It was easy to make.  I changed the recipe a little: I used one package of cream cheese instead of two; I added butter, salt, and pepper because I was afraid it would turn out bland.  In the end, it turned out great!

I cheated due to time contraints and used the frozen steam & mash, 1 plain & 1 garlic flavored. I also used 1 8 oz package cream cheese & milk to desired consistency & topped with cheese.  Made mid morning & kept them cool by placing in cooler with a few frozen ice chillers.  This dish was a BIG hit, my 13 yr old granddaughter said "these are the best potatoes you have EVER made". she was even making sandwiches with rolls and the potatoes. I had leftovers for next day dinner party, added a little water to dish and reheated in 200 degree oven, they never knew they were leftovers!!

These were so yummy and creamy, i had to use what i had on hand and that was the neufchatel cheese and light sour cream and it still came out rich. Will add garlic next time.This is a keeper for sure!

I do something similar- add cream cheese and sour creme to taste as i go. I  then freeze in 9 x 13 pan- i do this days ahead of a holiday - take out of freezer in the am. then pop in oven for about 30mins. - taste great and one less dish to fix on a big cooking day

This was ok but it was nothing special.  Make sure that the potato is fully cooked before you stop boiling it.

I thought these were good, but definitely not something I would make all of the time.  They are so rich and way too fattening for my blood!!  I did add bacon bits, used real minced garlic as opposed to the garlic salt and then threw in some salt and pepper to taste.  I also used HALF of the cream cheese called for, and fat free cream cheese AND sour cream - just to take away some of the guilt!  I chose to mash these instead of whip and if making again, I would stir the cheese into the potato mixture instead of sprinkling it on top, and just bake it for less time.  I found the cheese "crust" distracting as it pulled away from the spuds with every bite.

These went well with the Restaurant Style Buffalo Chicken Wings from this site. So Creamy and rich tasting although I used 3 TBSP lite cream cheese and 1/2 of a small tub of lite sour cream because the calories and fat in this recipe were alot. I used about 4 medium sized potatoes.
Added lite cheddar cheese and chopped spring onions on top...baked up delicious!!! A keeper...thanks!

When Janet Jones described these as rich, she was right!  They were delicious, but you can't eat very much at a time, which I guess is good.  Next time I may use less cream cheese.

Everyone liked these, but it was too much cream cheese and sour cream although I did cut the cream cheese in half, I'll probably cut more next time and cut some of the sour cream.

Excellent potato recipe, though not something I'd serve very often because of the richness. I think 1 package of cream cheese is plenty. Next time I think I might try to do a "twice baked" potato and use this for the filling.

Everyone LOVED these!  Except picky husband who doesn't like mashed potatoes anyway... I cut the cream cheese in half because 2 packages seemed like it would be way too rich- 1 package was PERFECT for us!  I used the sour cream and garlic salt but skipped the cheddar cheese on top- I think I could have skipped the baking part since I didn't put the cheese on top and it would have still been just as yummy and creamy.  Will definitely make these again!

I halved entire recipe, used as much cream cheese as recipe stated and love it just the way it's written.  It is rich, but I just ate less and had the bonus of having some of these leftover to have with leftover roast beef the next day!  These are now a staple for me.

Family and I loved this!!! Kids asked for seconds and it was even a big hit with my toddler. Only put in 3/4 of a 250gr tub of cream cheese and it was plenty. Can’t wait to make again. Strongly recommend

This is the best mashed potato recipe I've ever had. It is really creamy. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and used one package of cream cheese instead of 2. I also mixed in the cheddar and sprinkled just a bit on top. I will definitely make this again...many many times.

I only had 1 block of cream cheese so hoped it would taste just as good and it was!! A hit by two picky teen boys.  Will definitely make this again!!  Oh I did add 1 tablespoon of milk to help it blend in blender.

I really enjoyed these potatoes. I used 3 garlic cloves instead of 1. Next time I wouldn't use as much cheese. Yes, I will make these again, soon

Very good potatoe side dish recipe!  
I followed the directions with these minor additions...

I used red skins, keeping skin on and boiled them in garlic infused water. (add minced garlic to water)
I too followed others advise and cut  cream cheese in half and I used shredded cheese mixed with panko bread crumbs for topping to give some crunch.

Thank You for this recipe!

This is a nice way to change up potatoes, I changed it up a bit, I added some Gorgonzola cheese to it and I added some onion powder and green onions and some fresh garlic..then baked it. 
My hubbie loved it. I have made it twice...

Good recipe.  1 package of cream cheese is plenty.  1 cup of sour cream is too much.  I used half a cup the second time around and it turned out a lot better.  I mixed in the cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of chives.

Tastes great, I followed advise of some of the other reviewers and put only 1/2 the cream cheese.  I don't think I would want it any richer than it is like that.  Quick, easy and tastes good. :)

This dish was easy to prepare and is a nice alternative to regular mashed potatoes. However, 8 oz of cream cheese is plenty. 16 oz is overkill.

These are good if you correct the amounts.  I used 5lbs of potatoes not 5 potatoes and then only 1 container of cream cheese.  I also tried it the first time with the garlic powder and didn't care for it and I like garlic.  The second time no garlic and they were great.

This dish was bizarre. It tasted pretty good, but it seemed like it was missing something. If I make it again, I'll try adding more garlic salt or something to make it a little less bland.  I suggest broiling it for a minute or so at the end to make the top a little crispy.

I made this for a party, and everyone loved them! I used the potatoes as a base for making a kind of vegetarian Shepard's pie. I sauteed a variety of vegetables, and mixed them in with the potatoes. I also put one cup of the shredded cheddar in the potatoes and another cup on top. This turned out excellent; EVERYONE was asking me for the recipe! Next time, though, I will make it with a crust and it should be really incredible.

3/11  very good.  i used half cup s.c and 4 oz of c.c. and mixed in 1 cup cheddar.  spray the dish and bake 45o to get crusty top.  we all liked it but allison, but she doesn't like mash. pot anyway.
next time maybe use less s.c. and more c.c. and cheddar.
9/13 4 russets, 4 oz cream cheese, 1/4 container sour cream and mex cheese blend mixed in. s&p awesome!!! good for 4.
can leave in oven a long time in round casserole dish, creamy inside.

Wow!  So good.  I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8.  I ended up baking it for about a half hour until the cheese was starting to brown.

I felt 2 pkgs of cream cheese was too much for the quantity of potatoes.. maybe mine were smaller spuds.  I mixed in the cheddar, used fat free sour cream, and reduced fat cream cheese, and lots more garlic.. also dalloped butter on top w/the rest of the cheddar - YUM!

Deeelicious!  So simple yet so good.  I loved that you used real whole potatoes, instead of frozen like all of the other potato casseroles.  A bag of potatoes is far less expensive than frozen and healthier.  The only alterations I did was instead or garlic salt, I added a packet of dry onion soup mix.  I also did not totally mash it because I knew my husband would like it chunky with the skins still on.  My husband was in heaven.

What's not to like in this recipe?  Very yummy.........  I made a variation tonight to make this a main dish.  I cut the recipe in half and added three chopped green onions that I 'sauteed' with just about a 1/2 teaspoon of butter in the microwave.  I chopped up 1/3 lb. of kielbasa and nuked that so I could drain the excess fat.  Instead of mashing the potatoes I cubed them after boiling them. Cubing before boiling makes them absorb too much water. I've learned from the cooking shows to put the potatoes in the pan whole or cut in half, cover with water, and then put them on the heat. Bring to a boil and boil until done........ . . I threw it all together and baked for twenty minutes. Served this with green beans.  Thanks for helping me make an easy, tasty dinner tonight.

Easy to prepare. Used sharp cheddar cheese for the top. Thought about adding roasted garlic to mashed potato mixture for more flavor. Hubby also suggested sauteed mushrooms. 
Made for my family's traditional meatless Monday meal. 
Served with steamed broccoli, green salad and crescent rolls

As suggested I only used 1 pkg. of cream cheese and this was still quite rich.  We really prefer the twice-baked potatoes to this.

Great as-is recipe!  Holy calories though - so watch out!  I made this with pierogies for some friends and they loved it.  It's been requested a few times, but I limit how often I make it because of the fat content.

Cut the cream cheese in half and added some spices and garlic.  That kicked it up a bit.  Nice twist on potatoes!!

My children and I really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband however didnt care for it.  I followed others advice and added one 8 oz package of cream cheese.  I think that 2 would have made it to rich.  Thanks for the post will definetly cook again.

The only reason these are a two star is because our house mate gave them 5 stars.  My husband and I HATED them.  They were so rich and just tasted disgusting.  My 1 year old son seemed to like them.  Won't be making these again any time soon.

This was ok, but really it's just cheesy potatoes.  My husband liked it, but thought it wasn't anything special.  I baked it without the cheese on top and then put half in a crock pot and put 1/2 the cheese in, then the rest of the potatoes and the rest of the cheese.  I was taking it to a pot luck and it kept good in the crock pot like that.  I think everyone has at one time threw this type of thing together, kind of basic.

Wonderful  easy! I didn't have garlic salt so I added about 2 tsp of dry buttermilk ranch dressing mix. FANTASTIC! I made these up early for company  then just popped them in the oven in time for the rest of the meal. I would DEFINITELY fix these again!

I only had half as much cream cheese as the recipe calls for but it was still delicious. This is a great change of pace from plain potatoes.

I made this last night, only with a few changes, instead of sour cream, I used ranch dressing, and I only used one package of cream cheese.  I also used onion salt and garlic salt, it was fabulous, even my 2 year old ate it.  Thanks!
