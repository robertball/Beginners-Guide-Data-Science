Simple to throw together, however I found it to be quite bland. There is no seasoning present, other than a minuscule amount of salt and pepper which you can't taste. I would highly suggest making this with chicken (or veggie) broth instead of water.  Garlic, thyme, bay leaves would all add something to the flavor.  Also, 1/2 tsp of butter is not enough to saute that many vegetables...you will likely need to add more. I would make it again with the above changes.
