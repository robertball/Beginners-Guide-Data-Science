I was a little worried that my kids (6yo & 2 1/2yo) would turn up their noses at the blue cheese but I was so pleasantly surprised how mild the blue cheese flavor was. The marriage of flavors here were delicious and my husband proclaimed it his favorite meatloaf ever. I used 2lbs of ground beef and there was enough meat to fill all 6 large muffin tins and 6 regular sized muffin tins - which were perfect sized for the kids. Both muffin trays cooked  together in the oven for the 30 minutes specified in the recipe. We will be making this one again very soon!!

Wow!  We loved these at the LTH house and it is rare for us both to rave about a meal, ESPECIALLY dreaded "meatloaf"!  I followed the recipe to a "T", though I did sub gorgonzola for blue because I was too lazy to backtrack in the grocery store.  I ended up with a fairly rough chop on the onions and I'm glad I was too lazy to get a finer dice because I enjoyed the onion in larger chunks.  When I make these again (and I will!), I will add more spinach and maybe some shredded carrots, too, just to pack in some more nutrients.  Thanks for making me not hate meatloaf!

I made these for supper last night. I'm not much of a cook, and have never made meat loaf before, but I figured these sounded straight-forward enough.  I used fresh spinach and onion (both locally, organically grown!), Progresso Italian-style bread crumbs, and Athenos Blue Cheese Crumbles. I followed the recipe exactly. I was able to fill 12 regular muffin cups about 80%-90% full, and cooked it for about 20 minutes instead of the 30 in the recipe. I broke the center one in half, and it was cooked through.

Normally, my husband will eat what I cook, and say, yeah, it's ok. But he ate 2 muffins for supper, took 2 to work (graveyard shift), and ate them this morning, and ate another 2 for supper tonight. And, yes, there were other things he could have had for supper.  So I'm gonna say, they're winners! Not only did my picky husband like them, but my 5-year old ate 2 of them (with his hands, 'cause "it's funner that way"), dipping them in ketchup instead of putting the ketchup on top. WAY less mess than normal meatloaf that way! I think this is going to become a regular meal at our house!

trying to find something different to do with ground turkey tonight when i happened upon this little gem :)  really really good idea and base recipe.  in my opinion, both the spinach and cheese need to be doubled, and the breadcrumbs need to be cut back by half, hence the 4 star rating.  i was afraid the kids wouldn't touch them with the spinach in it, but i think they were so enthralled that their dinner came out of a cupcake pan that they said nothing - seriously, they said NOTHING about it!  amazing.  i think next time i will actually use cupcake papers to bake these, because the kids were so enthusiastic about the whole "mini" idea.  thanks!

I loved this! I made it shaped as a regular meatloaf instead of the individual servings and added a ton of extra blue cheese since we love the flavor--and I can not wait to make it again!

Very tasty. Gave it a 4/5 because I added more cheese, and coated the top with 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. ketchup, and 2T worcestershire sauce.

These are wonderful!  I have a new meatloaf favorite recipe.  I halved the recipe but did not halve the blue cheese or spinach.  I used dried minced onion (just dumped in about 1/4 c).  I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the meat mixture.  I used seasoned Panko bread crumbs.  As per another reviewer I topped with mixture of 2 T of brown sugar, 2 T ketchup and 1 T of worcestershire.  I ended up with about 7 tennis ball sized meatloaf balls.  They cooked about 30 minutes.  Delish!

This was excellent.  Blue cheese is the way to go. I LOVE meatloaf and I liked the idea of making individual portions and having it bake more quickly.  I used frozen spinach instead of fresh and just thawed it and squeezed out the water.  Also added some ketchup.  To me meatloaf isn't meatloaf without it.  Next time I think I'll add some shredded carrots and chopped mushrooms.

Absolutely WONDERFUL!!  I am not a meatloaf fan at all.  I made this recipe because my family LOVES meatloaf!  This meatloaf smelled so wonderful and tasted so good that I went back for seconds!  I followed the recipe exactly and will make it over and over.  DELICIOUS!

Made this recipe last night for my husband and I! We loved it!! I was nervous about the blue cheese crumbles because I only like some blue cheeses, but I ended up enjoying the crumbles, I think I'll put extra next time! My husband had ketchup with his, but I liked it just fine without. Will definitely make again.

I used Feta cheese and omitted the onion - everyone loved these even my 2 picky kids. I doubled the recipe which filled 12 regular size muffins plus a little extra. (Don't overfill the muffin pans or you'll get a very greasy pan to remove from the hot oven!)

This is a great recipe and very versatile - you can adjust the quantities for how much meat you have, as always on this cooking site.  You can also use any ground meat you like, and my preference is a mix of pork and beef.  No reason in the world why you shouldn't use turkey or chicken, or veal or lamb if you can get it or afford it.  You can also use any cheese.  Gorgonzola is wonderful, as suggested by another reviewer, but if your kids don't go for blue cheese you can use cheddar or anything else, even cream cheese, and make up for the mild flavor with some more spicing - like plenty of garlic.  If the kids or guests don't go for Worcestershire sauce, no worries!  I just use soy sauce instead, and they don't even know that it's there.  You can match flavors to the meat, too.  Did you know that pork is greatly enhanced by anchovy paste?  (I think it has natural flavor enhancers like soy sauce.)  You can also use Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce. Spinach is a great addition, but the recipe will work without it. I'm thinking mashed chestnuts would go well with turkey or chopped mushrooms with chicken. Shrimp would go well with pork done with cream cheese. I love being able to shove these meatballs in the oven and not having to stand over the stove and fry them!  I make big batches to have plenty for several meals, as they keep for a week in the fridge, and muich longer in the freezer, and everyone is pleased every time..

Easy to make and a BIG hit with the family: it is now the Family Favorite Meal :)  So good it's bee requested for a repeat next Sunday :)  Three changes: I substituted goat cheese for blue cheese (due to a dairy allergy), put some ketchup on the top before baking, and I used a regular 12x cup cake pan which worked great for the portions as we all had two meatloaf cakes, and two each were left over the girls for school lunch tomorrow.  Latest time I upped the Worcester sauce to give it even more tang.  Yummy!!!

Following the suggestions of other members, I doubled the blue cheese and the spinach.  I also baked it in a 8x8 pan for about 40 minutes.

This is one of the best recipes I've had for meatloaf.  In fact we love it so much I have made it twice in three weeks.  AND my friend loved it even after professing to abhor blue cheese!

This is a really interesting take on meat-loaf. It definitely has a very different flavor that traditional meat loaf. The blue cheese really makes it -- although I think any soft cheese (feta, gorgonzola, goat) would work too, but blue happens to be my favorite. I also like that you automatically have single serving portion sizes-- I'd like to try this with ground turkey next time.

Very nice recipe. I like the muffin thing too, as it makes it real easy to save leftovers. While, good, as is, next time I'll jazz it up a little with more blue cheese, more spinach and maybe some chopped green pepper. I'd also consider topping with a Catsup or BBQ type glaze during the last 5 minutes of cooking.

When I told my family the name of this recipe, they all turned their noses up and didn't want me to make it. But, they gobbled these up and these were great the next day too. I didn't make any changes to this recipe and will make again. The individual serving sizes also makes this great for folks trying to control their portion sizes.

This was very good. It was an excellent way to hide veggies from picky eaters. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese but it really works in this recipe. I also tried with gorgonzola and it works also. Barbecue sauce was a great condiment.

Very yummy!!  The whole family liked this meatloaf!  When I make it again, I will add a bit more blue cheese...I did use about a cup of spinach and it didn't seem like too much.  Great mix of flavors!  This recipe is a keeper!

I used a full cup of spinach instead of half. I don't know what is up with this but I put mine in a loaf pan instead of a muffin pan & baked for 50 mins... it was covered in nasty beef fat... like the balls you get on the sides of hamburgers that are cooked in the fry pan. I picked it all off & the meat loaf was good but still the initial image was gross. Not sure why that happened, I have NEVER had that happen with meat loaf before. Regardless it was tasty.

These weren't breathtaking, but were pretty good.  My two-year-old liked them.

BEST EVER meatloaf....with just a few modifications. Upped spinach to 1 1/2 cups, added 1 glove of minced garlic, and a generous cup of diced fresh mushrooms. As suggested by another reviewer, I glazed the loaves with ketchup, brown sugar mix. This meatloaf was very moist and bursting with flavor! I loved the healthy addition of the spinach.

made this for the family...and everyone loved it!!!  I did not have fresh spinach, but frozen worked well...also used gouda instead of bleu   because rest of my family does not care for it.

easy, made for GREAT leftovers.

OMG!! This meatloaf is so moist and creamy! My boyfriend (who won't get near bleu cheese) said it was "better than your regular meatloaf." Ha! Fooled him! Of course it is! The regular meatloaf is a 50 year old recipe that includes ketchup! Yuck! This one is sooooooo much better AND has the added health benefits of spinach. Love it!!

I consider myself a meatloaf lover but this was just okay in my book.  The flavors were just not very pronounced.  I had leftovers, hoping it would improve the next day, which a good meatloaf usually does but it didn't.  Good concept but from a flavor perspective it just didn't work for me.

This was so freaking easy to do! My husband and I loved it!!!! The kids felt that it had to much blue cheese, but I disagree with them. I personally love the stuff and would put more in it.

I only had about 1/3 to ¬Ω cup of blue cheese, and I used ¬º cup of ww bread crumbs, so added ¬º c. of crushed saltines.  Used double the fresh spinach, and topped with sweet chili sauce.  I made these in my mini loaf pans and the amount comes out just right to fill them.  Cooked at 350 for 35-40 minutes , upping to 375 the last 15 minutes while roasting some butternut squash.  They were great!

Very interesting twist on Meat Loaf.  Enjoyed the flavor since it added a different flavor than traditional Meat Loafs, yet retained some of the traditional qualities.  Good recipe for Meat Loaf lovers.

This was very good. I used ground turkey & substituted half of the bread crumbs with quick oatmeal & added fresh basil
Update: I made this with fat free feta today & it was even better than original recipe. I'll be making this with feta from now on.

I made these tonight.  Fast and easy to make.  I cooked them for 25 minutes, then turned off oven, let them sit in oven, this way they were not over cooked.   I microwaved 2 sweet potatoes, which only took few minutes.  I did substitute blue cheese for cheddar cheese.

Let me start out by saying I am not a huge fan of meatloaf and my hunny isn't a big fan of blue cheese. Between the two of us we ate all but 2 of the 12 it made. No one flavor is over powering so it blends together really well. I made exactly as state above just adding a little black pepper.  I will totally make these again, only thing I will do is add more spinach as 1/2 cup just didn't seem to be that much and I think it could stand up to a bit more spinach. We made the with roasted potatoes and greens off this site and it was an amazing dinner

Good and easy recipe - but I'd use a leaner hamburg than 70/30.  The water and greese bubbled up from each one. The taste was very good.

Let me just start by saying that I really and truly dislike meatloaf.  My hubby, on the other hand, loves it. But sadly for him, he has been living the last 20 years in a meatloaf drought, for obvious reasons. So when I saw this recipe, I thought I'd give it a whirl and I'm so glad I did! It's moist and delicious, with the bleu cheese adding a wonderful kick. Plus there's something about having them in muffin form that isn't quite the turnoff for me that meatLOAF is. I enjoyed this so much that we're having it again tonight. The second time in three weeks. The hubby's in heaven!

Very nice change to regular meatloaf. I used less blue cheese also thinking it would be strong, but you need to use the entire amount. I will listen next time to others who said it didn't over power the taste of the meatloaf. I'm going to make one change though & that is spray the muffin tins instead of using the grease as suggested. I'll also use more fresh spinach. Would be nice for company also because you can make attractive on the plates easier than slices.

Added some chopped yellow and orange bell pepper, and a litlle more spinach and blue cheese (used gorgonzola) than what the recipe called for;  filled 18 regular size muffin tins (1/4 cup each muffin), and for variety - put a typical ketchup glaze topping on 6, Tabasco brand Caribbean style steak sauce on another 6, and left remaining 6 plain.  Baked for 20 minutes.  WOW!  All were delicious!  The flavors were perfect together.  Husband said this was the best meatloaf he's ever eaten.  Don't know how you could go wrong - think if recipe followed to the T it would still be 5 stars.

I just knew I would love this recipe.  In fact, I sent my mother a copy before I even made it.  Who wouldn't love spinach & blue cheese in a meatloaf? Sadly, this recipe was a big disappointment.

I made exactly as specified (although I added a little extra blue cheese and spinach as some other reviewers suggested and baked it in a loaf pan). I did not care for this at all. 

I did learn one valuable lesson:  adding a cup of spinach is un-noticeable after it bakes down, so I will be adding spinach to my traditional meatloaf recipe.

Not your mom's meatloaf! I love that these are bite sized and so easy to make. I swapped out the blue cheese for feta, because I'm not a blue cheese fan, but these were still great. I adjusted the cooking time a little because my family likes their beef a little less pink, but otherwise made it as directed.

This is without a doubt the best meatloaf recipe I've ever made. I make mine with ground turkey or ground beef.I like to make a double or triple batch and freeze them up in tinfoil muffin tins. I pull them out and thaw them or bake from frozen. My family loves this recipe and it is so delicious. This recipe is so adaptable...you can throw in grated carrot,finely chopped mushroom, whatever you want. I top some of them with a ketchup, brown sugar, mustard topping before baking. Love,love,love!

Not your Mother's Meatloaf!Since I've been married I've been making my mother in laws meatloaf.While trying to jazz up my low salt diet I found this.I used no salt ketchup instead of Worcestershire and less cheese.This made a gourmet meatloaf for a change of pace.

This was a perfect little meatloaf but I couldn't taste the bleu cheese at all.  I think I'm going to use this for my meatloaf recipe but change some of the veggies.  I used a mini loaf pan.  It was great!  This needs a topping/sauce

it was very good the first time, but I use turkey not beef.  the second time, I cooked two strips of bacon and chopped it up and add to mixture,  also add 2 tablespoons of ketchup also.  didn't use muffin tin, but  pan for making small loafs of bread. makes 8 small loafs.

We really enjoyed this.  I added diced sourdough bread instead of the bread crumbs a squeeze of ketchup, a little milk, salt and pepper. I forgot the worcestershire but probably would have liked it.  I didn't add as much blue cheese because mine was pretty pungent.  This was very good, very moist.  Will definitely be making this again.

This is definitely a keeper for me!  Absolutely delicious!!!!  The only thing I did differently is bake it in a loaf pan because I couldn't find my muffin tin.  I increased the cooking time to 45 minutes.  Soooooo good!

This is now my favorite meatloaf.  I didn't change a thing though I don't have a large muffin pan so I used a regular sized one and heaped the meat in each.  I only ended up with 7 muffins but they are perfect serving sizes.  I cooked them the same amount of time called for in the recipe.  The blue cheese (ok I probably used closer to a cup of that) and the worcestershire sauce make it amazing!

I loved the flavor...my issue is they stick to the muffin tin...really bad, I used butter first time to grease the tin, next time crisco...yes crisco, I bought it only for that purpose. HELP!!!! I want to make them again for a large group of friends!! 
Thanks

A wonderful change up from ordinary meatloaf. The blue cheese is such a nice surprise  but  not overpowering . The individual mini loaves is an added plus. I did increase the amount of blue cheese and rough chopped the onion. A personal preference. And like someone else, I used  frozen spinach squeezed out very dry.
Thank you for sharing. My entire family loves this. I have also found subbing Feta Cheese for the Bleu cheese is a nice twist,but either way, you need to increase the amount of cheese.

I used 85/15, didn't grease the 8 mini loaves on my pan. I added an extra Tbsp of Worscheshire sauce, and doubled the spinach.  This was FABULOUS!!!

I was extremely happy with this recipe! I cut the batch in half before adding the cheese since I wasn't sure my 19 month old would like the blue cheese. I made half with cheddar and the other half with blue cheese since I expected the blue cheese to be much stronger tasting.  I didn't find the blue cheese overpowering at all.  My whole family enjoyed it. One muffin was the perfect serving size for my daughter, while her dad and I had two or three. I am looking forward to making this again. The prep took no time at all!

These were amazing - couple changes include using crumbled feta and a 10 oz pkg of frozen spinach thawed and squeezed dry. Cook time took 35-40 minutes. WOW

I followed the recipe and they came out bland. Next time I'm adding more seasonings and spinach. I might even add bell peppers, more onions,and a tomato paste graze on top. It needs more taste.

Only four stars because I don't like blue/bleu cheese (I prefer mozzarella or cheddar).  But I love the muffin pan idea.  I've been doing mini meatloafs for a while now, but the muffin pans make it much tidier and more uniform.

Very Tasty! My husband and I are doing Atkins, so I left out the breadcrumbs. Then,  I made them into patties and cooked them on the grill. KIds liked them too.  Even had my teenage daughter ask for seconds!

Really really good!  Only thing I changed was leaving out the bread crumbs. Didn't miss them at all! And I cooked it in an 8x8 pan because my muffin tin doesn't fit in my table top oven. Thanks for an awesome and easy recipe.

My blue cheese hating husband didn't believe there was blue cheese in these! these were super easy to make and everyone in the family loved them. I used dehydrated onions since typical onions give me tummy issues and I added salt and pepper. Those were the only modifications I made and they turned out great!

I made these muffins with ground venison. They were very good. I noticed the recipe doesn‚Äôt call for salt, and I figured it might have enough from the boxed Italian bread crumbs. But I thought it will benefit next time from addition of a teaspoon of salt. I also added some garlic powder. Not the best meatloaf I‚Äôve ever had, but I‚Äôll probably make this again.

I make it as is in a hand-made loaf and have many times. It's always a winner. I try to make it double so to have cold meatloaf sandwiches later.

This is the first time (in almost 49 yrs) my husband has EVER asked me to make meat loaf again!  He loved this recipe and the portion size is perfect.  Next time I make it, I might try to spice it up a bit but frankly adding some bbq sauce to my serving was excellent.

Quick and easy dinner option. Could definitely up the bleu cheese and spinach to a half cup each (meat to veg/cheese ratio a little off). Definitely will make again.

I followed the recipe. I ended up making 18 in large muffin tins. The 30 minutes cooking time was good. Since I bought so much spinach, I wanted to add more to the recipe but did not, but next time I will, but won't change anything else. Thanks.

This turned out great the first time. I used a blend of turkey and beef and substituted feta to satisfy a family member who didn‚Äôt want blue cheese.

I ran out of spinach so had to forgo that, and I used 100 grams of cheese which may have been more than the recipe I'm not sure. I really liked it. I will make them again

I've made this a few times, and they're always a hit. Sometimes i use feta instead of blue cheese, which is good, but the blue cheese makes it a little  zestier. I also shred a carrot for more veggies.  Great recipe, putting them in a muffin tin really makes them convenient leftovers.

Picky husband approved! I didn't have Italian breadcrumbs, so I used Panko and Italian seasoning. I also used more onions than called for, and added garlic powder. I would make the following changes next time:
Add salt
Add garlic powder
More blue cheese
More spinach.
Really moist, super easy! Next time maybe I'll try a pork/beef mix.

Super delish! Made it in a regular pan and added about twice the spinach or so. I have my usual meatloaf recipe, but this was a welcome change and a good way to use spinach. I fixed it up with some mashed potatoes with a few drops of truffle oil and it was a very classy meal for not a lot of effort.

This was AMAZING!  I was looking for some "easy protein" and stumbled across this gem.  They taste great hot or cold. I also prepped some steamed vegetables along with some quinoa and rice.  All week I had these amazing lunches that were ready in about 1:20 in the microwave.  Yum!  I did make some changes , but only because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand.  I substituted Kale for Spinach and "Coaches Oats" oatmeal for the bread crumbs.  I also threw in some fresh basil simply because I had it and wanted to use it before it went bad.  My wife loved them; however, the bleu cheese didn't appeal to the kids (which is fine by me). Oh, I also used grass-fed beef.  I ended up making 24 of these "muffins" and I did a rough calculation and I think it works out to about 140 calories each, and each one packed a tasty 11.4 grams of protein.  I'll be making these every week from now on!  Awesome recipe!

My brother-in-law doesn't like blue cheese, so I substituted for goat cheese and it was still delicious. Personally, I like the blue cheese version.

I loved this recipe, using muffin pan made it a quick dinner which I always need. I used a pork/beef mix which made it VERY moist, I recommend 1/4 to 1/3 of the meat to be ground pork if you choose this variation. Also used Gorgonzola, because its a little smoother. My family was stuffed after this meal, everyone overate because it was too good!

So yummy.  I made some adjustments based on the reviews - double the spinach, added 1 c of Blue Cheese and also added and additional 1 T of Worcestershire sauce.  This was very juicy and flavorful!

This recipe is fantastic. I followed the instructions to the letter and could taste the blue cheese in every bite. I didn't do it as muffins, but it turned out just as beautifully in a loaf. I'm keeping this one.

Awesome!!  I was worried when I made this because my boyfriend isn't a fan of blue cheese or spinach, but once it's all cooked together with the ground beef, it has the best flavor! You really can't tell that it's blue cheese and spinach in there but it gives it a really juicy and delicious taste! My boyfriend has actually requested that I make this again.

I made this today and it was so easy! I love the addition of Bleu cheese and I added arugula into the spinach mix. It might be that I'm used to my mom's recipe but I was left wanting some sort of sauce. A traditional tomato soup like Mom's probably wouldn't fit. I'm wondering about some sort of reduced sauce, made with Worcester, maybe?

These are the best meatloaves ever!!! I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of bleu cheese and threw in a few shakes of season salt and some oregano. I have made these three times and they get better every time! They freeze well and are simple and quick to make. The spinach makes them colorful and healthy. I would add a few more stars if I could!!! AWESOME!!!

I thought I followed the recipe, well I did follow it. Just realized when I got home the crumbled blue cheese had cranberries. I loved it! I ended up baking for 40 minutes. I served it with sweet potato fries with garlic and olive oil.

Convenient to prepare and to serve. I thought it was a bit too "blue cheesy" for me. In fact, that's pretty much all I tasted. Next time I will use a slightly milder cheese like gorgonzola.

Delicious twist on meatloaf. Didn't have a muffin pan so used a meatloaf pan and it worked perfectly - only addition was a little bit of garlic.¬† Will definitely make again!

What a fantastic, sophisticated play on meat loaf!  The blue cheese creates a heavenly bite while the spinach lends an earthy tone...a sophisticated flare yet an old home satisfaction.  The only thing I did differently was increase the blue cheese, onion and spinach to one cup each... also used 85% lean beef... very little run off, if at all.  absolutely delicious.  Pared with a petit Syrah.

Loved the addition of blue cheese to make a unique meatloaf recipe. I did also added ketchup, worchestire and brown sugar glaze as suggested by another reviewer which turned out well. This recipe was a hit!

My kids love this dish. Although, I have to use feta in place of blue cheese. The blue cheese doesn't go over well with these kids. I always use organic ground turkey or chicken - it tastes less 'gamey' (is that a word?) than 'regular' ground turkey/chicken.

Made these for a blue-cheese hating person in my life...an attempt to ease them into the blue cheese world. They were a smash hit! Paired them with risotto and fried brussel sprouts.

An absolute favorite!! I was looking for a meatloaf recipe with blue cheese when I found this. So I use this recipe as a guideline.  I've made with chopped mushrooms, and without spinach. I've made it with a Mushroom Sauce to top. I think my husband is just as happy with nothing over it. We had a freezer melt down, so I made my meatloaf with ground elk & beef, included the spinach, added my mushrooms. Haven't tasted it yet, but we expect it to be good.  I didn't get any objection from my husband for using (wasting), his precious elk in this recipe.

Great!  Sauted onion with a clove of garlic before adding to meat mixture.  Added pepper and used extra spinach.  Used onion hamburger buns for bread crumbs.  So moist and delish.  Even though I used lean ground beef there was a lot of oil sitting in pan when pulled from oven.  Key is to remove meat from tin (using tongs) immediately to drain on paper towel.

This was PERFECT for my kiddos and my husband loved them! I did shredded cheddar instead of blue cheese and it turned out so yummy! They didn't say a thing about the spinach either- such a great way to get some good nutrients in little ones. Will make this one again for sure!

Great recipe! I used frozen spinach, drained, and the whole container of blue cheese since I needed to get rid of it, but they still came out really well! I used my regular topping, but added a splash of worcestershire to it to complement it. I will definitely make this again! So quick and easy!

I make this a lot, and love it every time. I have done it with all turkey, half and half or all beef, and it is always yummy. I have also done it in both the muffin tins or as a loaf (usually about 45 min). Substituting cheeses has been fun (feta, Gorgonzola) and adding peas or other veggies has also worked. To make it glutton free for my husband, I used crushed chex mix instead of bread crumbs and it tasted wonderful. Highly recommend and super easy.

I had blue cheese (St.Agur) to use up, and in my search for what to do with this wonderful cheese I found this recipe. Having read previous comments from the others stating that adults and children both liked the blue cheese meatloaf, I thought I would try and slip this recipe by my blue cheese detesting husband. Wow did this work! The faint taste of the blue cheese was there, but undetected by his lordship. The meatloaf muffins were so flavourful and moist that I will definitely make them again. My changes included panko versus Italian bread crumbs, double the cheese and spinach, and the addition of a diced roasted red pepper then topped in the last 10 minutes of baking with an apple jelly barbecue sauce. Delish!!!

We improvised and added ground pork which was delicious. Also added chopped carrots and celery. My husband makes a special glaze for the tops while baking and as a variation you can serve with the sauce or the gravy on the side. We have served at a dinner party and friends love it!!

A sophisticated twist on classic meatloaf.  Great flavors, great presentation on the plate, and although it doesn't taste like traditional meatloaf; it still has that great, soft and smooth consistency.  All of my guests always love it!

My husband and I loved these meat muffins! I substituted goat cheese for blue cheese and they were delicious.  I also added fresh garlic and increased the amount of spinach. This will become a regular in our diner repertoire for sure!

Made it again using ground turkey instead of ground beef as well as double the amount of spinach.  Dare I say that it was even better this time around?  I do dare!  It was fantastic.  Mulling the idea of spending an afternoon making multiple batches so that I can store them for easy reheating for quick and delicious breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Love this recipe.  Have made it 3 times in the past two weeks (the last time was the first time trying with turkey).

These little guys were fantastic.  My 9 year old loves my regular meatloaf but I had a ton of spinach in my garden that I had to use before the frost consumed it and I happened to have blue cheese in the fridge so this recipe was a delight to find.  My mother always made meatloaf with rice instead of with bread crumbs and I have since substituted the rice with quinoa as I like the way it combines with the meat better.  In addition, it makes the recipe gluten free and it ups the protein content which I like since meatloaf is usually served with starches and carbohydrates.  I used about a 1/3 cup of quinoa, cooked according to the package directions.  I ran out of Worcestershire sauce after the 1st tbsp so I added 1 tsp of black bean sauce as a replacement for the 2nd tbsp of Worcestershire that I didn't have.  My grandma's meatloaf secret is to add a topping of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar.  I was excited to see that another reviewer uses the same trick.  I use about 2 parts ketchup to 1 part mustard and then add brown sugar to taste.  If you happen to have Heinz chili sauce in your fridge, try that instead of the ketchup.  It's even tastier.  I devoured 4 of these little guys with a glass of red wine within minutes of them coming out of the oven.  I will now be freezing some of my spinach to use in this recipe in the winter.  Thank you so much for sharing this gem of a meatloaf recipe!

I'm giving a 4 but my daughter gives it a 5.  I really enjoyed it but I felt it was missing something.  I used 85/15 gr beef and it was perfect, not dry and not too much grease(like some said they had).  I stuck to the recipe till the end when during the last 5 mins I added a tsp of ketchup on top of each one(for my daughter's sake). I still couldn't figure out what I was missing and then I remember we added no salt or pepper.  The salt I see as ok, since there is Worcestershire sauce and blue cheese, but what about the pepper?  So after eating the first one I added a sprinkle of blk pepper and there it was.  I will add a bit of pepper the next time I make.  I also saw that many added more blue cheese and spinach, but I think more cheese would have over powered it so I'll keep the same.  Maybe a little extra spinach next time(maybe).

I love this meatloaf!  It's easy, and I love the addition of blue cheese. I'm not usually a big spinach fan, but in this recipe I really like it-which is an extra bonus since that adds something healthy to the recipe.

This was so good, the whole family loved it! Only downside is the meatloaves in the muffin tin have nowhere for the grease to drain out. Next time I plan to use more spinach, and possibly find a glaze or sauce to complement it!

This was great! As some others had done I used a loaf pan instead of muffin size. Cooked a bit longer, came out great! Every one loved it. One to add to my favorites!

This is delicious! Although, I doubled the amount of Worcestershire sauce, and used a full cup of the Italian Bread Crumbs. It's INCREDIBLY yummy and has become a staple at our house :)

I thought it was an interesting flavor, but I think it needed some acidity.  I topped mine with barbeque sauce to rectify that, and it was tasty.

These were very good! My husband enjoyed them very much! I hardly ever buy blue cheese, but had some from another recipe and decided to try these. I'm glad I did, it was a nice change from the same tasting meatloaf we usually have.

These were great, I used a 1/2 lb of ground pork just because I didn't have enough ground beef.  We will definitely have again! Would love to try with ground sirloin and some chopped mushrooms with the spinach!

The blue cheese is very present, and there isn't much character to the meat itself.  Great for meatloaf fans who like blue cheese.  For people who like a bit more excitement, this might be a good base to add your favorite spices and particular tastes to.

Very VERY GOOD!  While I liked the individual portions from the muffin tin, I think next time I will make it in a regular loaf pan so it will be easier to slice up the leftovers for sandwiches.

I made this and both me and my husband loved it. I did use more blue cheese. It was a 5oz package. I didn't see the point in saving just a tiny bit. I used the extra to top it at the end of the cooking time. I use a meat thermometer because my oven is a bit touchy.

I made this recipe two nights ago.  I, personally, do not like meatloaf.  I am not a fan of hamburger dishes in general.  I used one pound lean ground sirloin and half a pound of hot Italian sausage.  This gave the meatloaf a better texture and a lot more flavor.  This was a great meal and I will be making it again.

Pretty good.  I used a little over 1lb of ground beef  instead of the 1.5 recommended.  Thought it lacked something, not sure what.

Make sure you use an EXTREMELY lean ground beef or turkey.  Do not make the mistake of using anything less than 90% lean meat.  Other than that, I would half the cheese and double the spinach.  It was delicious as written, but the cheese taste was a little overwhelming.  I would prefer it a little bit more mild.  I also added fresh rosemary to the meat mixture after grinding it in a food processor.  Very quick and easy to make.

I wanted to love this recipe.  I love meatloaf, love blue cheese, thought it would be an interesting combination and a change from my usual meatloaf.  
I followed the directions exactly, except I made it into one loaf rather than the mini loaves, baking it longer because of the size. 
It looked beautiful... but had a gummy unpleasant taste, and left a bad "mouth feel".  The next day wasn't much better, served either hot or cold.
I feel like I wasted expensive blue cheese on this. I won't make it again.

I upped the recipe to 8 servings;so 2 pounds of xlean ground sirloin.
I cooked for 40 minutes and it was the best meat loaf ever. I placed a half slice of peppercorn bacon on each loaf. Yummy, everything is better with bacon!
   Iserved it with oven baked baby potatoes marinated in xvirgin olive oil and Costco Kirkland brand organic no salt seasoning. They cook at the samer time a temp as the meat loaf.
  A good sized dolup of sour cream on the side is a perfect comliment for the meat loaf. Thanks to drbiffswife for a great recipe. Regards 
George

This was such a hit! I loved the idea of using a muffin pan as well. The texture was fab and the blue cheese really made it creamy. The only substitution I made was added 1/2 lb of sage sausage for the last 1/2 lb of ground beef. So easy and so delish.

My family really enjoyed this dish!!  It was fun and easy to make (I let my 5 year old help prepare it).  I will definitely keep this recipe handy in the future. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies; the kids ate everything on their plates after we convinced them just to TRY it.

I've made meat loaf in jumbo muffin pans for 40+ years and love to try new recipes so I made this for dinner last night. The fresh spinach was a nice addition but we did not like the blue cheese although we like blue cheese salad dressing and sprinkle blue cheese crumbles over our salads.

Very tasty! My hubby and I made this with ground turkey and doubled the spinach. We used ground up french fried onions instead of the bread crumbs and onions. Unfortunately, our cat also liked them too. He knocked over the pan while we were eating dinner. Hopefully we will have leftovers the next time we make them!

I made this with the exact ingredients specified; I did not make them into mini loaves, but opted for a loaf pan since there are just two of us. I baked uncovered middle rack at 350 for 45 minutes, removed from oven and then covered for ten minutes before serving. Very flavorful and will make this again!

I used ground turkey and added extra spices.  It was so yummy.  You can serve it in so many different ways... on a bun for burgers as meatballs on pasta etc...

My children didn't like it!! I thought it was bland and needed more seasoning I followed the recipe, the only thing I did different was add fresh mushrooms. I will stick with my old recipe.
