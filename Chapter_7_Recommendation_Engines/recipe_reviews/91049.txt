Delicious!  The recipe needed no adjustments at all, it came out perfectly.  I only leave off a star because of the labor intensive nature of the recipe.

O.K.  Pretty labor intensive.  I thought the artichokes were a little overwhelming but surprisingly my six year old loved it.  Not sure if I'll make very often.
