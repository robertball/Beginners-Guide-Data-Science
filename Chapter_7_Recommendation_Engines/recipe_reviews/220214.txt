If you’re simply going to top the tenderloin with the crumb mixture you can easily get by with just half of what’s called for.  Once I mixed it up and realized I had way more than I needed, a side of me said to simply bag the rest and use it another time (it would have been great on shrimp!).  But what I ended up doing was to coat the entire tenderloin with the mustard/garlic mixture, then completely cover it in the bread crumb mixture and drizzled a little olive oil over the top. To prevent it from getting soggy on the bottom, I roasted it on a rack I placed on a cookie sheet. My tenderloin was almost exactly a pound, and it cooked to perfect tender and juicy perfection at 425 degrees for 25 minutes. This is one of the better pork tenderloin recipes I’ve tried, uniquely flavorful with elegant, company-worthy presentation.  I used fresh thyme, using the rule of thumb three times as much as dried.  I served this with Oven-Roasted Potatoes and Savory Summer Squash, both recipes also from this site.

this was really good, probably didn't need as much bread crumb mixture as stated. I'll use half the bread mixture next time, but very moist and tender. i cooked the terderloins 30 mins. instead of the 20 mins that was suggested they were perfect.

I made a change that I feel was somewhat major.  I don't normally do that, but I dislike mustard and so I replaced it with mayo in this recipe.  I think it turned out well, the pork was tender and the breadcrumb cheese spice mixture stuck to it just fine.  Next time I may try olive oil instead of the mayo.  I worry the crust will not stick, but the flavor may be more complementary.  

Update: I saw on a cooking show recently where sour cream was used to make a crust stick to a roast.  Maybe that could work here also?

I made this for my husband and I, and it was very good. Cooking time was a little off, but I must have had a thicker cut of meat.  I baked it for 45 minutes and it was moist, tender and delicious.

I really enjoyed this! It was so tender and moist. I usually have all of the ingredients on hand so plan to make it more often. I had two tenderloins which were a pretty nice size, so cooked it longer~probably about 40 minutes. Served with roasted brussel sprouts and corn on the cob.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company. It also makes fabulous sandwiches the next day!

Fantastic. Best recipe for pork tenderloin I've found and the easiest as well. Took the suggestions from the reviewer who gave the tip about baking it on a rack on a cookie sheet so the entire loin could be coated. Yes if you don't like Dijon this wouldn't be for you.  Great recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

This turned out fantastic and my family and I all enjoyed it. The only thing that needs changes is the cook time - I took a 2.25lb tenderloin and baked it for 1h 10m at 375 degrees and it turned out perfect. Moist, tender, and so amazingly flavorful. We'll be making this many more times in the future. You also might want to take a fork and poke some holes in the pork so the mustard dressing seeps into the meat a little and the flavor goes throughout the cut.

Our whole family (including a 10 year old boy) loved this!  I made a few substitutions - cilantro instead of parsley & fresh thyme instead of dried and used a food processor to make the bread crumbs and get the Parmesan and herbs down to a small size.  We followed the new guidelines of 145 degrees and there were no leftovers!

It was soooo good but I'm sure the time was wrong, I added 20 extra minutes not counting the 5 minutes standing time (of course used my thermometer).  We also added a touch of cayenne just to jazz it up a bit...everything else was perfect!  I could see slicing it open and adding spinach and garlic....

This was really good! The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the mustard.  I'm not a big fan of dijon mustard so I think I'll use olive oil next time.  The cooking time was also off for me...took 40 mins.  Will definitely make again!

Like everyone else, I needed to cook it longer.  35 minutes for me.  It was tasty and easy!  
I did replace the breadcrumbs with crushed up parmesan crisps to make it more keto friendly.. I also used all the breadcrumb mixture and cooked it on a cookie sheet, as someone suggested.
I think the crust mix would work well with other meats as well.

Great Flavor on this pork. I actually baked it in the grill directly on the top rack. Kept the temperature around 425 for 25-30mins until meat thermometer read 160.
-My changes: Honey Mustard and Minced Garlic--worked great; family loved it.

Think you need to adjust the timing based on your tenderloin size, which was a complaint by a lot of reviewers.  This really is a minor issue as long as you have a thermometer or you have experience cooking pork.  It took about 45 minutes for me.  I used spicy brown mustard and dijon just simply because I ran out of dijon.  I would definitely make this again! Even my toddler loved it.

It was good. Used almond flour rather than panko to keep it wheat free. Also cooked for 30 min to 145 degrees, then let it rest and it was beautifully pink and juicy inside. We really quite enjoyed it!

I have made this several times and each time my guests rave about it.  I made it the last time and served this cold.  It is great either hot or cold.  I use all the ingredients and cover the filet all around with mustard I brush on and place it into the bread crumb mixture and roll it till covered.  Then I place it on a rack to go into the oven.  There is enough bread crumbs mixture to cover three filets fully.  I do not use Panko as it is too big I feel.  Regular bread crumbs are perfect.  I cook in the oven on 425F for 20 minutes then reduce the temperature to 325F to finish for another 15 minutes.  I like the pork tenderloin to be a slightly pink color which you can get if you take it out of the oven at 160F .

This was very good. I used to pork cutlets instead of a whole tenderloin. I mixed a bit of mayo into the mustard since my son doesn’t like it. It was not an overpowering taste. I’ve written this on a recipe card & will make again.

Very juicy and tender. I just combined all the topping ingredients together and pressed it onto the tenderloin. It was much easier that way and just really really good.

I will not make this again.  It was good the first night but the left overs were soggy and did not add much flavor.  If you have a large family and can eat the whole tenderloin in one meal it is OK but not worth all the effort and ingredients used.  Not one of my favorites.

My husband, who is not a fan of Dijon mustard, kept telling me how great this was. I followed the recipe, coating on all sides of the tenderloin. It did require about 37 minutes in the oven. Moist inside with crunchy, delicious crust on the outside. Just perfect!

Wouldn’t make it again. We have pork loin a couple time a month. We use our bbq grill and and a good marinade which gives the loin so much more flavor.

This recipe is as easy as described, and the crispy yummy coating keeps the meat juicy and tender.  The ingredients are usually already on-hand. This  recipe is now a family favorite!

My family loved it! It was very easy and delicious. I did need to increase the cooking time by 20 minutes. Next time I would cut the bread crumb topping in half.

Easy yet tasty. An excellent "go to" choice for guests. 
My tenderloin may have been larger and I increased the cooking time but it was still moist.

This was a huge hit and I would definitely make it again ... moist and tasty!  I might back off on the amount of breadcrumbs next time as I like to keep my dinners low in carbs.

This is one of the best recipes I've found for Pork Tenderloin. Tender and moist. I followed recipe with only a few adjustments after reading other reviews.
Covered the entire tenderloin in the mustard/breadcrumb mixture.  Placed on raised baking rack so the bottom would not be soggy.
Baked 2.24 lb. tenderloin, in 375 degree convection oven, for 40 minutes.
Served with Lemon-spinach orzo, and english peas.  
This is an easy weeknight meal or elegant enough to serve guests

Knocked my socks off and I’m not wearing any. I’d cook a little lower on temp because it will rise as it rest. A definite repeat.

i did make some changes in that i used only one piece of tenderloin   no big deal there   but my thinking was that if breaded the entire piece of meat hat the bottom crumbs might act as a "rack"   not so   and i cooked it longer    yes i will try it agian

Definitely needs about 45 mins to cook. Definitely use a meat thermometer.  I increased oven temp to 425 after 40 mins and let brown for 5-6 mins. Rested about 15 mins. 
I thought  it was fabulous and insanely easy. The meat was buttery tender and very tasty. Guests seemed as pleased as I was.  I will make  it often. Chopping the parsley was the only work! Recipe says this is for 4 servings. It feeds  6 or more. PS. I had leftover coating( parsley, part and crumbs). I threw  this in with hot , cooked noodles and some butter. First course was a a large salad  with asparagus, pears and pecans.

We loved it!  It was moist and tender.  I didn't have regular bread crumbs and I used panko crumbs. I would do it with the regular crumbs because it would stick to the mustard coating  much better.  I also would make less of the coating.  The next day it was even better.

I used a 24 oz pork loin and increased the cook time to 40 minutes.  Covered with foil at 25 minutes to keep the topping from browning too much.  Comments from friends was best tasting pork loin they’ve ever had.  This one is a definite keeper.

I make this all the time. Delicious. The one thing I do different is to pour a little oil over the breadcrumb/parm cheese and top with balsamic glaze and cook at 400 degrees  for 15 minutes then turn oven off for another 15 minutes.   Slice and add a little more glaze. Soooo yummy. I use Rachel Rays balsamic glaze

The recipe calls for 2 12 oz tenderloins. 20 min would be fine for those. Many who had to add more cooking time had larger loins or only 1 piece of meat. I also subscribe to 145 degrees.

Excellent.   I cut the parsley in half and added equal rosemary.  Also cut mustard n half. And added equal mayo to soften mustard taste.

Delish! Very Moist and tasty!  Easy to prepare, it did take more time to cook,  definitely use a thermometer and it is perfect @160.  I did as others suggested and used half of the bread crumbs and still had plenty.  Put mixture all over the pork and cooked on rack.  This is a keeper.

Delicious AND simple!  Kept tenderloin moist.  Cooked a little longer, but maybe my roast was bigger.  My husband loved it, as did I.  Thanks

Very good recipe! Took much longer to cook than noted.  Definitely making it again, would also make it for company.

I made this recipe and it was very tasty. I was also easy to make! I had to let mine cook a little longer than 20 minutes and I did not use all of the bread crumb mixer, it just seemed to be too much so I froze what I didn't use. I would recommend this recipe to anyone and look forward to cooking it for a dinner party.
