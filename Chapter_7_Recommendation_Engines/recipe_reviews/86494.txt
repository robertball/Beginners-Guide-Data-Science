I've been making beer can chicken for years. I cook it in the oven more often than the grill. I also don't use beer. I use an empty beer can and fill it with water. I used beer the first time and although it smelled really good while cooking, I did not notice any benefit as far as taste was concerned. I season the chicken inside, outside, and between the flesh and the skin. For oven cooking, I first prepare a skillet by spraying it with a nonstick spray. I then place the beer can in the middle of the skillet and spray it too. This makes removal of the chicken much easier. After easing the chicken over the can, I place about a quarter inch or so of water in the skillet. This eliminates flare-ups during baking.
I also surround the chicken with cut or small potatoes. The potatoes taste great because of the chicken flavored water. I bake in the oven at 400 degrees, 15 minutes per pound.
Let it rest for 10-15 minutes and it comes out juicy, juicy, juicy every time without fail. This is by far my favorite way to roast a chicken.

I made this in the oven instead. I cooked it at 350 degrees (bottom rack) for 90 minutes. I also added some spices inside the beer can as well. Great recipe!!!

I have wanted to make this ever since Matthew McCaughnehey was talking about it on The Rosie O'Donnell show about 8 years ago.  She loved the way he said "Beer Butt Chicken" and so did I!!  I sprayed my chicken with garlic infused oil, sprinkled with McCormick's seasoning, and a bit of Hy's Seasoned Salt, and stuffed an onion in the neck cavity.  I also added about 10 small cloves of garlic (broken) to the can of Bud.  I used a 3lb. chicken, and because of the wind, my barbeque temp flucuated quite a bit, so I don't have a time - I cooked to 180 degrees.  My kids LOVED IT (loved saying "beer butt chicken" more than anything), and my husband said "Give it 10 stars out of 10!"  So, it is a definite keeper, and look forward to doing it again!  ;)

I think it is pretty much impossible to screw up beer can chicken.  This was great though.  The spice added a great extra flavor to the chicken.  My brother taught me to stuff a potato, onion or lemon in the neck of the chicken.  This steams the chicken better and really keeps the breast meat moist.  I actually over cooked mine (to 190) and the meat was still moist and juicy.

As usual, McCormick's Grill Mates has provided a product that is simply great. I find that the Grill Mates line is a staple for outdoor grills. I love their products and always look forward to their new additions.

This was right on.  We have the beer can skewer and used it with this as well. Costs like a buck so well worth it! Used Bud Light :>. Unfortunately did not have the McCormicks on hand so used another brand. It was good but not as good as the McCormicks would have been.  I used a 3.5 pound chicken and it was done in an hour. One thing...I had 2 of the three burners on for my gas grill, all the way on low, and the temperature inside would still not go below 400 degrees. I say this as a caution to those of you that do not have a thermometer on your grill.  Medium would have been too high for my grill.

I make this using the McCormicks rottiserie chicken spice in a jar located in the spice isle. I also put half a lemon in the neck cavity to trap the vapors.

This chicken turned out so nice and moist! My boyfriend got a beer can chicken stand for Christmas that stabilizes the bird. We baked it in the oven at 350 since it's 20 degrees outside, but can't wait to try it on our grill. Delicious!

This was great!  I did mine in the oven at 400 degrees for about an hour or so - 3-1/2 lb.  I added some garlic to the beer can and an onion in the neck. It was delicious!

I made this in the oven.  The bird was so beautiful when it was done cooking.  As for juicy...NOT.  I prefer my usually method of cooking using the baking bags.  I will say that the seasoning was delicious.  I wil definatley use that again.  I won't be making this again.

Oh my goodness this was so good.  :-D  I didn't have any beer in a can (we don't drink it that way) so I emptied a root beer can and then filled that up w/ Guinness.  I even added a bit of the chicken seasoning to the beer itself.  I then rubbed the seasoning EVERYWHERE, including under the skin.  I cooked it at 400 degrees for 15 min. per lb.  It turned out PERFECT!!!!  I have never had chicken this moist in my life.  I will definitely make this again and again.  I steamed some broccoli and made mashed potatoes to go w/ it.  It was a Perfect meal.  My husband was in heaven.  :-D

Wow! We love this way to do chicken, especially good for free range chickens.
I did not oil the chicken, they really did not need it.I did two chickens and I split a can of beer between the two of them great.
