I marinated the steak for several hours in rice vinegar, soy, and chili garlic sauce. I made the dressing as directed. Next time I'll definitely add some heat to the dressing. I skipped the mango. I "grilled" the steak on my cast iron grill pan. This was DELICIOUS!

Loved it!  I marinated the steak 6 hours in 3 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp water, few splashes Texas Pete hot  sauce, 1 tbsp red curry paste, 1 tsp sesame oil & 1 tbsp vegetable oil.  To the dressing I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and doubled the rice wine vinegar.

I gave it a try just now and did  nto care for it. Beef would have been better if marinated in pineapple juice fresh from the fruit.

Have made this since 2015 and it will always be my absolute favorite.  No changes are necessary .  It's really quite authentic Thai.  In the winter, I buy Boars Head Beef in the deli and this works well too.  Enjoy as much as we do!

Delicious! I used high heat in skillet and browned meat 3 minutes each side and it was cooked. I seasoned meat with Thai seasoning (dry mix), salt and pepper. I added sliced cucumber. The dressing is delicious. I substituted apple cider vinegar and avocado oil because I didnâ€™t have rice wine vinegar or sesame oil.

I put salt, pepper, and garlic powder on my steak, then grilled it to med rare. I also added salt and pepper to the dressing. I chose to cut my peppers and mango differently. Ultimately, this was a great recipe and I will be making it again.

Very tasty salad.  Only changes I made: I sprinkled some (homemade) Thai seasoning on the steak with salt (before grilling) and I had only spicy sesame oil so I used that.  It worked fine and gave the dressing that nice hint of heat.

I am used to eating Thai Beef Salad and decided to fix it for dinner.  No mangoes or avocadoes  in the house, (but I have also never had mangoes or avocadoes in it at Thai homes or restaurants).  So, I used cucumbers and tomatoes, chopped up, and followed the directions for the dressing.  We had a bowl of rice with the salad, which was quite filling.  I used thin slices of top sirloin for the meet and marinated it for a couple of hours in  a little oil, lemon juice, and dried basil.  Fixed the meat on the grill..3 minutes to a side..brought it in, let it sit a few minutes, then sliced it into strips.  The dressing is perfect and the flavor was what I was used to eating.  One day when I have a mango I will try it with a mango.    It is easy and the cooking time is quite short, as you need to watch the meat so it doesn't get tough and overcooked.  I have it a 4 because of the mango and avocado...s.  Still not sure about avocado, and I am an avocado fanatic..used to have an avocado tree in our yard in the Valley of Texas.

My husband really liked this salad so the recipe stays in my collection.  I would prefer less meat and more salad, and would try it next time with grilled chicken in place of the beef.  As a meal, I think it needs quite a bit more salad and/or less meat and fewer servings.  It was probably closer to two servings as written; however, that would make there way too much meat and mango.  We don't enjoy  bell peppers, so those were left out.  It was fine without the peppers.

Wowser! and what an amazing dressing - it's best eaten when made - loses something if eaten the next day (as a left over lunch) ;-)

Absolutely perfect. I marinated the steak first with a bit of soya, sesame oil, line, chill flakes and pineapple juice. Delicious dressing.

I made this recipe last saturday and loved it. It does not bother me in the least wether it is authentic thai or not. It tasted great and the ideal dish to eat and create in a heat wave. 

the happy one
