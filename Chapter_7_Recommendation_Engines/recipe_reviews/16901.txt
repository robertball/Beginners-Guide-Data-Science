I made this in the crockpot and it turned out fabulous! I doubled the chile peppers and seasonings, wrapped the whole works in foil and cooked it in the crockpot for 8 hours on low. After the 8 hours was up I removed the foil package, dumped all the liquid into a bowl and skimmed the fat off the top and then shredded the meat and put it back into the crockpot with a small amount of the defatted liquid and cooked it for an additional 30 minutes or so. I served the shredded meat on warm flour tortillas with shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese, sour cream and salsa. I made some Zatarain's Spanish Rice to serve on the side - it goes really good with this, especially if you add a can of diced tomatoes w/ peppers to the rice while it is cooking - and you could also put a little bit of the rice in the tortilla along with the meat if you wanted to - that's how my hubbie ate his! This was REALLY GOOD and I'll definitely be making it again!

Very Good. I made this in the Crock-pot, twice. The first time I just added 1/2 cup of water and doubled the spices. It was good. The second time, I added a can of beef broth, tripled the spices and added 3 chopped jalapenos. It was great. Served it with fresh tortillas with all the fixings, cheese, guacamole, onions, cilantro and beans. With my Oval crock-pot I turned the meat several times. I used frozen roast so the last couple of hours I turned it on high. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be using it many times!(Crock pot time approx 10 hours with frozen roast.)

Best mexican meat recipe I have tried - and we love Mex food!!!  I've tried it a few ways, my favorite is to rub it down and throw it in the crock pot before I go to bed.  (no foil, no added liquid necessary)  I cook it on low 15 -20 hours.  Stick a big fork in there and stir it all around, it falls to pieces.  Then let it simmer in its own juices for a bit and - wahlah, dinner is served.  THANK YOU for this staple to our dinner rotation!!!

I have modified this to my own liking after several tries in the oven.  I found this is best cooked in the crock pot.  I double the recipe and prepare it the same way, but put it in the crock pot with some water (to keep it from drying out).  Also, I have found that a tri-tip roast turns out the best.  Leftovers are great the next morning with scrambled eggs, salsa and flour tortillas (that is if you have any leftovers)!!!

I tried these in a slow-cooker instead of the oven and they were FABULOUS!!!  My husband always orders carnitas at our favorite Mexican restaurant, and he said that these blow everything else he's had out of the water!  THANKS, Miss Annie!

Fantastic, versatile recipe. I use this as a filling for enchiladas and burritos. I also make this recipe using chicken in place of the beef when I make pollo fundido. Pork also works equally well.

This turned out great. Although I used chopped jalapenos, as a substitute for the green chilis, becasue I had none at the moment. I added a few more shakes of all the spices, and probably cooked it about 30 - 45 minutes longer. After the initial cooking was complete, I shredded the meat effortlessly, removed the foil, put the meat into the juices, and cooked it for about 45 more minutes in the oven, occasionally stirring the meat around so it would all get 'juiced'. After that, I ate them on some homeade, fresh flour tortillas. It needed nothing extra. The flavor was wondeful. 

Since my wife is not a big fan of beef, I had about a weeks worth of leftovers, and they tasted better the older they were. Thanks Ronaldo! Great stuff! You should post more recipes. I'd try them.

I made this recipe in the crockpot.  You should anticipate longer than 4.5 hours cooking time as mine took around 6-7 hours.  YUMMY!!

This was good, but a little bland for our taste, so I lightly oiled one side of flour tortillas, filled with the beef mixture added some grated pepper jack cheese, folded Chimichangas style, and grilled on my griddle, pressing them 'flat', topped with salsa and sour cream.  Thanks for posting!

Too much spice, too little spice (bland), just right. This is SO a matter of personal taste.  I decided to disregard all the reviews and just follow the recipe with no modifications - and I was happy.  Smells good, tastes good too. This had just the right amount of spice, brightening the flavor without masking the rich, beefy taste.  A little cilantro and avocado was all this needed. (Red onion would have been nice too but I didn't want to taste it all night)

I used the crock pot, 3lbs of beef chuck, and followed the recipe omitting the foil.  Set on high for 3 hours, broke down the meat in the pot to smaller chunks, cooked 1 more hour, shreadded using fork in the pot then turned to low and served to guests 30 min later with tortillas and taco shells ("taco bar" w/rice, beans, etc).  Not too dry or too wet for shells. I was so busy talking to friends that by the time I went to eat...it was gone!  Guess it was good as people said they were stuffed and asked for the recipe. :)  I had a great PB &J! (4 stars for ease) UPDATE 2/2/09:  used pork shoulder, crock pot, and enough water to fill 1/2 way, and increased spices by 1/2.  7.5 lbs fed 16.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used a two pound top sirloin roast, trimmed the visible fat, and seasoned with the same amount of seasoning as called for if using a 4 pound roast.  I cooked it in a slow cooker on high for two hours, then turned it to low for about 7 more hours.  I did add about 3/4 cup of beef broth and half a chopped onion for extra flavor and to keep the roast from drying out.  It shredded easily, and was very tender.  I served on warmed flour tortillas with shredded Monterey Jack cheese, salsa and sour cream...loved it!

Absolutely delicious!  
I didn't have a chuck roast so used 2 2lb. Chuck steaks and placed them side by side in a large lasagna dish.  Worked great!  Within an hour the yummy smell filled the house and the kids were coming out of their rooms asking what was cooking.  When it came out of the oven and I ripped open the foil the kids were all over me for bites.  Meat fell apart beautifully - really easy to shred.  I love Ortega chiles so I added 2 cans with 2tbs of new mex chile powder, 1tbs Oregano, 1tbs Cumin, 2tbs chopped garlic.

If there is only one thing I might change is to add a tiny bit of salt and maybe add a little dry wine to boost the flavors .

This turned out really well! I used a 2.5 lb roast and kept all the seasoning measurements the same as written except increased the green chiles to a 7 oz. can. Cooked in the crockpot for about 7-8 hours on low and added about 1/4 cup water to keep it moist. It was pretty mild in flavor.

I wanted tacos, but didn't feel like the ground beef, so decided to try using another cut of beef. I tried this recipe and it tasted great. I did make some modifications. I added 3 cloves of garlic, sauted white onions, a pack of taco seasoning, a 1/2 pack of chili seasoning instead of chili powder, cayenne pepper, a couple of diced adobe peppers instead of green chili peppers. I omitted the oregano since I didn't have any, but added cilantro instead. I topped the tacos with sour cream, refried beans, green onions, shredded cheese, and salsa verde. These were awesome and I will be making this again!

Pretty good! I was looking for the Mexican restaurant style carnitas and this wasn't it, but it was still pretty good. I used a pork loin roast and cooked it in the crock pot for about 6 hours. The seasonings taste very similar to a pack of taco seasoning, which I was a little disappointed about. Still a very good dish for what it is.

My family loved this recipe.  I used a 2 1/2 lb. chuck roast( I couldn't find a 4lb.) and put it in a crock pot with 1 1/2   cups of beef broth.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours- left it before church.  The roast was so tender it was falling apart trying to get it on a platter to shred. It shredded easily with little effort.  I think the key to that is having a good roast- I saw some others that said it didn't shred as easily.  Also, by cooking it in the crock pot my house wasn't heated up by the oven.  If you use a crockpot add some broth or a little water.  This was fabulous!  I think I may even try more spice next time .  You won't be disappointed with this one!!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I added sauteed chopped onions and bell pepper to the rub.  Worked well.  My husband really enjoyed it.  I thought the flavor could have penetrated the roast a little more, will poke holes in it first next time!  :-)

Fantastic.  Any type of roast (beef or pork) will do so just use whatever looks good that week at the store.  I even used pieces of tri tip once and it was excellent.  Don't drain the green chilis and I use the larger can.  Cook longer - I suggest cooking for 5 hours. The meat was so tender and such a great flavor.  Served on warmed flour tortillas with cheese, onion, tomato, avacado and sour cream.  The meat reheated really well the following day for leftovers.

EXCELLENT! Just finished making this. I used 4 oz. can of Ortega diced jalepenos in place of green chili peppers, baked for 4 hours for 4 lbs., and it came out excellent. I can see where you could double the other spices if you like a more intense flavor, but as is, it is authentic. Usually, a chili based salsa is offered to add more flavor/spice/heat at the table. I developed my own recipe after eating tacos in Mexico and here in mexican homes, using a different cooking technique. This beef is easier to cook, requires no attention once you put it into the oven, and is very flavorful. Highly recommend this recipe!! Serve with finely chopped onion, cilantro, avocado and sour cream. Some even add matchstick-sliced radishes to add. Offer soft hot corn tortillas and chili salsa to garnish as desired. Thank you Ronaldo!!

This was ok. Seemed like all I tasted was the chile powder. It was pretty good the next day to put in tortillas. Probably won't make again or if I did, would have to play with the seasonings.

WOW! I used this meat tonight to make chimichangas (with Chihuahua cheese) and they were the best I've ever had!  The only change I made to the recipe was to add one package of dry onion soup mix and omitted the salt called for. Hey Ronaldo, let start a restaurant!
ADDED NOTES: I tried this with a 4 lb pork shoulder in the slow cooker and was really pleased with the results. However, I had it in on low for about 18 hours! This cut of pork is really fatty and it took a while to pick all the morsels of meat out, but worth every second!  After removing all the meat, I strained the liquid into my gravey separator, pressing the solids in the strainer to get the max flavor out of the "mash", let it sit a few minutes to settle and poured it back over the meat. I then added a few squirts of Goya's Sazon Liuido (sold at most Mexican grocery stores in the States) to boost the flavor back up.  I'm going to ber serving it over Gulf Coast style white rice with simple black beans on the side, a advocado salad and guava ices for dessert!

This is so good!!  I marinated for 2 days in the fridge and cooked in a slow cooker all day with 1/2c. of beef broth.  Next time I'll make 2 roasts so there is more to freeze (I froze a couple ounces just to see how it would keep.  It unthawed and reheated perfectly)!! Great with avocado or guacamole!

I made this for a party with a pork roast and it was great!  I did use a crock pot, and added approx. 6 oz. Dos XX beer to add the moisture.  It turned out great.  Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipie!!  And so easy!  Several of the other reviews said that they weren't able to get the meat to shred so to combat that I used a top round roast and put it in the crock pot with a little water & a bay leaf for 4 hours.  Then i cut the roast into small cubes (a lot of it was shredding at that point), and then back in the crock pot for another 6 hours.  It was extremely tender, and just fell apart.  Next time I'll use a little less water as the broth was a bit too much, but I'll definitely be making this again!

WOW!  This was incredible! I was scared to use all the green chilis but next time I will.  My husband normally doesn't eat leftovers but in this case he made an exception.  Even my children ate it. Thank you so much!

YUMMY!  I sprinkled the spices all over and studded the meat with about 5 cloves of garlic sliced.  I didn't measure anything because we like things spicy.  I also left out the chilies and it was still great!  I will definitely make this again!

I've made this many times as a soft taco filling for a party.  I double the meat (usually get the meat guy to cut two thick chuck roasts 4 lbs each), quadruple the spices, substitute canned jalapeños for half the canned chilies, and bake 5 hours in a covered roasting pan, turning the meat over twice during cooking.  I cool the whole thing and refrigerate the meat and sauce separately overnight,  and then shred the meat, defat the sauce and heat and boil The sauce to reduce it a bit, then pour some or all of the sauce over the shredded meat and reheat, covered, in the oven.

I made this but I used a boneless pork butt. I couldn't find a chuck roast at the store.  It was sooooo good.  We made burritos.  My husband like it so much that he ate the rest of the food on my plate when I left the room. He then wanted to know if we could eat it for the rest of the week rather than freeze the rest.  Yeah, it was a hit.

Very nice and so easy to make!!  I put the meat and seasonings into a slow cooker (not wrapped in tinfoil) and let the slow cooker do all the work.  I halved the recipe and we still had plenty of meat, enough for lunch and snacks.

this is a solid recipe. I used a shoulder roast, I didn't have a can of chilies so I used a can of rotel. I also added some taco seasoning and 1 onion. Put everything in the crock pot on low for about 8 hrs. This is a solid recipe.  Thanks!

I modified this recipe to make a "standard" roast, rather than mexican.  Instead of the can of green chiles, I grated 2 onions in the cheese grater.  I added 1 tbsp marsala cooking wine, 4 cloves of crushed garlic, and 1 tsp each of rosemary and thyme.  I rubbed the mixture on the meat and wrapped in foil as the recipe calls for.  My husband said this was the BEST roast he has ever eaten in his life.  Thank you for the guidance!  I'll be wrapping my roasts in foil from now on!

I tripled all the spices and added 2 minced jalapeños and let it all cook in the crock-pot for 8 hours.  We ate it in corn tortillas with taco fixings. It was wonderful and the extra froze beautifully for a quick and easy meal on another day when I'm short on time.

This was really good and so easy!  Like others, I also doubled the spices and put it in the crockpot on low for about 7-8 hours and the meat just shredded apart.  Make sure to take the time to pull the fat out though, if you don't trim it ahead of time.

The only changes I think I will make next time will be to add some vegetables (an onion and green pepper) in the tinfoil, as well as a packet of taco seasoning.  We like it spicy and full of flavor!

I doubled the seasonings & cooked in the crockpot for 8 hours on low. Came out perfect - moist & flavorful but not overly spicy. My husband raved about it after the first bite & said "you've got to make this again soon!" So this is definately being added to our rotation. Great filling for tacos, burritos, enchiladas or chimichangas. Next time I might try it with a pork roast since that is the more traditional meat for carnitas. Also I will use a bigger roast & freeze extras for quick dinners in the future. Thanks!

I'm sorry but this was bland :( i wish i didn't waste my 4 pound roast on this recipe...I did cook it in my crockpot and it was very tender and fell apart nicely, I doubled the spices because I love Mexican food,  but there was no flavor in this considering all the spices I put on it....I ended up pouring barbecue sauce over it today so I could have a sandwich....

EXCELLENT recipe!! It works great in a crock pot with a few additions...I used all of the listed ingredients plus one 14oz can beef broth, 1 TBLSP red pepper flakes, & about 12 cloves of garlic (love garrrlic!). I mixed all of the dry ingredients in the beef broth then poured it over the pork in the crock pot & left it on the High setting for 6 hours. Once the pork was done, I shredded it then let it soak in the liquid for another 15 minutes.

Delicious! My family raved over this. I cooked a 4lb. roast seasoned as the recipe stated in the crock pot with a cup of beef broth for 6 hours on high. I think next time I will decrease the broth to 1/2 cup. So tender it was falling apart as I was lifting it out. Served in flour tortillas with shredded cheese, lettuce, sour cream and hot sauce.

the best carnitas I've ever had!  The key to keeping it moist and shredable is to TIGHTLY seal the foil around the roast.  We do this for our ribs too and the meat practically falls off the bone!

We love this recipe (even my 5yr old son).  I have used this recipe as is and with pork, which also works well. My serving suggestion would be this - after the meat is done and has been shredded, add a can of diced tomato (or fresh) additional chilie peppers (or what ever temp of peppers you like), a little of the juice from cooking and cook on the stove till heated through.  I then use this as a filling for burros or chimis.  It is wonderful! Thanks Ronaldo!

Miss Annie,
          This is too yummy!!! I was
 taught by my mother in-law to make
 beef carnitas but they were more
 American tasting and the tin foil
 went over the pan which made them 
very dry. Thanks to you I learned a
 new trick! Try my recipe:onions, 
garlic and ground pepper same baking
 instructions as yours. I highly 
recommend Miss Annies recipe to 
all mexican food lovers....it's 
also extremely easy to prepare!!!
         Smooch

I used a venison roast, doubled the spices and added a couple tablespoons of curry paste for some kick.  I rubbed it well, left it in the fridge overnight, wrapped it in foil and put it seam side down in a couple cups of beef broth on low for 10 hours.
It was incredible, I'm hard to please, but it fell apart way better than anything I ever expected...even with venison.
I used it for burritos, wow... thanks.
I wasn't sure about the foil in the crock pot, but glad I did it.

Love love! Changes: I double the amount of seasonings & garlic. I also used half of a large onion which I chopped & put in the crockpot. The cut of meat I used was beef bottom round roast. After I rubbed the seasonings on the meat I put about 1/4 cup water in the crockpot and added the meat,cooked on low for about 7 1/2 hours. Served with rice,limes, & cilantro.

I had to improvise with this one.  I halved the recipe using a 2 lb. chuck roast that I cut into large chunks.  I didn’t use the green chile peppers, but instead used a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I browned the meat on the stovetop first and then added it to my crockpot.  I skipped the foil altogether.  Then I deglazed the pan with the tomatoes, scraping up all the yummy browned bits and added that to the crockpot.  I cooked this on low for 7 hours, at which point it was moist and shredded perfectly.  I served this in warmed tortillas with, green onions, chopped tomatoes, salsa and sour cream, along with Mexican Rice III, also from this site.  We really enjoyed this dinner.  I put my leftovers in the freezer for a quick and easy meal another night!

Wow! We absolutely love this recipe and usually eat it on a salad (like a taco salad, but so much better!). I make this at least once a month and love having leftovers. It is great for potluck meals, as well. Per other reviewers suggestions, I make it in the crock pot, double the seasonings and add a can of beef broth. I have made it with and without a cup of salsa and both are excellent. Thank you, Miss Annie!

DELICIOUS!!!!  I followed all directions exactly except I used a 2.5 lb roast (but still used the same amount of spices as the recipe calls for).  I also used 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of cloves. I put it in the oven for 4 hours wrapped in foil, then at the end I shredded the meat, skimmed any fat off the juice from meat and mixed shredded meat with juice from meat cooking.  We ate it as soft tacos but would be delicious in burritos or even plain!  This turned out amazing and my husband loved it also plus it was SO EASY! If I were to make a 5 lb roast I would double the spices.  This recipe will be a regular in our house.

This was a fantastic recipe.. here are my adjustments.. I baked mine in the oven for 4 1/2 hours. I put 4 Tbsp. chili powder, 3 tsp. Cumin and 3 tsp. Oregano, but followed the rest to a T. I also chopped up an onion and put it in with the roast. Tips; make sure you are using a roast with some fat on it so it will stay moist, if not, be sure and add water. No peaking while it's cooking or you will loose moisture. After about 4-5 hours, remove it from the oven and shred it up, add a can of Rotel (I actually just drain a can into the meat and use the tomatoes for mexican-style skillet corn) put the foil back on and cook for another 20-30 minutes. And that's it! Fantastic, and if you make enough you can use it in other recipes throughout the week, this beef leaves a lot of room for creativity :)

Yum. Used with sirloin steak and in the crock pot.  I cooked too long :( I'm sure something less lean, like the chuck called for, would be even better.

This recipe is incredibly easy and delicious! It's sort of like mexican pot roast that just melts in your mouth. the only changes I made is that I used only 2.5 lbs of chuck roast and kept everything exactly as is. I put salt on each individual taco that sets off all the flavors. Yummo!

Way too greasy.  Should use a leaner cut of meat.  Hard to judge the flavors past the grease.

So good, and so easy cooked in the crock pot! A little bland, but that is easily remedied with some spicy salsa and guacamole on top of the tacos.

This was pretty good.  I had higher expectations for the flavor of the meat.  The meat was extremely tender and I loved the cooking method (I used the crock pot).  Very simple, but something was lacking in the flavor.  Not sure what...maybe more cumin?  I would probably make this again, but intensify the seasonings.

Made this with only a few changes used a 2 pound flat chuck roast but same amount of spices and cooked in my slow cooker for 8 hours on low. Awesome the spices were just right and my husband raved about it. The meat would make wonderful beef enchiladas that is my plan for the next time we make it.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo and my fiance and I absolutely loved it.  I initially wrapped the beef roast and seasoning in foil and put in crock pot on low for about 2 hours.  I then unwrapped it and added some beef broth, onion and green pepper, as recommended by some others.  I had a small roast, so it was done in about 6 1/2 hours.  I pulled it apart, removed as much fat as possible and put the meat back in the juice for about another 30 minutes.  I served it with sour cream, sliced avocado, and salsa.  We will definitely make this again.  I'm sure our young adult children would love this as well.

This was wonderful!  I did make some changes: I used a 2# beef chuck cross rib roast but didn't change the quantity of spices.  I added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper, 2 diced jalapenos and an extra 1/2 clove of garlic.  I put it in the slow cooker on med-high for 6 hours with a cup of beef broth.  After I shredded the beef I put it back in the slow cooker with the juices for ~1/2 hour (on simmer).  My apartment smelled so good all afternoon while this cooked, we could hardly wait for dinner!

We thought this was pretty good. Not outstanding, but something I'll def make again.  I made in the crockpot 8 hours on low and yes the meat did just fall apart.  I added a chopped fresh jalepeno while cooking and tasting thinking it needed something more.  Served with Mexican rice and tortillas.  Hubby said he'll eat the leftovers so that's always a plus.

This was so amazing and made my kitchen smell yummy too! Next time I may add some jalapenos to give it a little more spice. Although it was a little greasy, it still tasted good.

We made taquitos with this recipe, and it was very good but not spicy enough. Next time I will perhaps add some chopped jalapenos to the pot.

Didn't like it.  I live in San Diego, and this is not what I think of when I eat carnitas.

Very good.  I don't recommend eating more than one or two because they fill you up and make you feel like you ate the Eiffel Tower.  The second time I made them I used beef brisket that I'd already cooked and marinated in Claud's brisket marinade.  I added all but the chili powder and wrapped them in tortillas.  That was really good, too.

Fantastic!

Since it is too hot to be using the oven this time of year I put my roast into the crockpot for about 8 hours. It turned out perfect!

Delicious and so easy! Based on the reviews (my thanks to everyone!), I added finely chopped onion to the marinade, poked the meat with a fork and covered in the marinade overnight.  After it was done cooking, I scooped some of the spices out of the foil and mixed in with the meat. It was a big hit.

I have been searching for a great and easy recipe to use to make a good filling for a shredded beef burrito.  This was it!  This was incredibly easy and everyone in my house just loved it!  I made no changes to the recipe, although I'm sure it would work fine using a crock pot instead of the foil, too!

Loved it!

I normally make pork carnitas, however this was great! It smelled so good cooking.
I recommend serving it in warm flour tortillas with fresh, chopped cilantro, sliced
green onions (length wize) and sliced radishes...
the traditional way to serve carnitas...muy bien!

This is REALLY good and I haven't even put it in my enchiladas yet!!! I can't say I followed the recipe exactly because I never measure anything just kind of eyeball the amounts. I did double the chile peppers and I used the hot ortega's not the mild ones. for the chili powder I did not use the basic store bottled chili powder, I used a combo of Ancho, pasailla, and California chili powders to equal about the same amount. I tend to be heavy handed with spices so I have no idea how much I used. We do like thing spicy. I did use my crock pot to cook it, I rubbed it with the rub mix, wrapped it in foil tossed it in my crock pot on high for 4 1/2 hours. Perfect! Maybe the people that say it was bland probably cooked it in the crock pot adding liquid to dilute the spices.

Very good!  I skipped the foil and threw it in the crock pot. I used a 2 lb pork roast, kept everything else the same and added 1/2 cup of water, onions, garlic,and red bell pepper.  After 8 or so hours on low, shred the meat, mix it with the liquid in the pot to redistribute flavors, then broil until dry to your liking.  Flavorful and yummy carnitas!  Thank you!

So sorry for rating without actually making the recipe, but since I believe the spices are the true key for the flavor of the recipe, I'm going to go ahead and rate.  Had some steak to use up, so I sliced and seared same then halved the spices and used along with the steak.  Outstanding when used as a base for fajitas!

I wasn't sure what kind of chillies you guys used and the only jar of chillies I could get here was a jar of birds eye chillies, but the jar said suitable for mexican dishes so I guessed it would be ok. They came whole and I chopped them up worrying that it would make the beef too spicy for my liking, but I wanted to stick to the recipe as much as possible for a fair review. Luckily I did because the meat came out tender and just the right kind of spicy for me! I will definitely make this again.

We cooked this down in the slow cooker with a can of tomatoes with green chilis. I drained the liquid towards the end into a pan, skimmed some of the fat and added flour to thicken the sauce. Served over rice.

Kept spices as directed for a 2.5 lb roast. Very easy in the crock pot (no foil) for 6 hrs low, 1 hr high. Next time I will try to cook it for a little longer. Flavor was very good. Substituted one can Rotel for can of plain green chiles.

Another great carnitas recipe here in AR...hard to choose! I was afraid to use the chile peppers because my daughter hates spicy food but i went for it anyways and it wasn't spicy at all. The taste overall is too safe for me, so definetly double the ingredients.

So easy! I didn't have the time to bake, so I put the meat in a stockpot with the seasonings and water about 3/4 up the meat. Covered, boiled for about 15 minutes then simmered on medium/low for 1.5 hours or so. Spectacular!

This recipe is awesome.  I will save money on ethnic mexican steak tacos.  I only feeding 2 people so I used a 2.25 size chuck roast and 2.5 large fresh jalapeños and put in my slow cooker on low for 6.5 hours perfect.  So delicious.  Served on flour tortillas with reduced fat cheddar cheese and low fat sour cream OMG! Will be making this over and over. Thank you for a fabulous recipe.

This was AWESOME!!!  We ate it so many different ways.  First, we ate it in tortillas with some sauteed green peppers (I used some of the grease from the beef to cook the peppers in).  Then we ate it with scrambled eggs in tortillas.  And finally, I used what was left to put on some nachos with some more green peppers and cheese.  I was sad when it was gone and I can't wait to make it again!!!!

Fantastic.  I wrapped mine in foil, marinated in fridge over night and popped it in the slow cooker in the morning before going to work (still wrapped in foil).  Shredded the meat and put back in the slow cooker with some of the juices.  It was delicious!

I did not follow the recipe when I made this (well, to an extent I did).  I used pot roast (about 3lbs), one onion, 3 fresh jalapenos (chopped/seeded), lime juice, the seasonings called for and a few extra, fresh garlic, a little water.  Put it in the crockpot at 9PM on a Friday nite, turned it off about 3PM Saturday afternoon.  IT WAS AMAZiNG.  I will be making this again this weekend, I cannot stop thinking about it this week hah.  I just need a really hot and spicy salsa recipe now :-/  OMG cannot wait to make this again.

Fantastic!!  I wrapped the ingredients in foil and placed in the crockpot on low until the meat pulled apart easily.  Made hard shell tacos with it and they were the bomb!!  I can't wait to make this again and try burritos or tamales.  thanks for sharing!

Tender and delicious shredded beef tacos.  These were absolutely wonderful.  Modified the recipe a little, mostly as recommended by other reviewers:  Used tri-tip roast (2lb size was plenty for two people) but kept spices same volume as indicated in this recipe (since others recommended doubling spices for original recipe at 4lbs).  Cooked in crock pot on high for 7 hours.  Prepared by seasoning roast with spices as a rub, then placed in crock pot in a broth of:  green chiles (used half hot and half mild), 2 diced garlic cloves, 4oz jalapeno tomato sauce, one can of beef broth, and 2 chopped jalapeno peppers.  Did not wrap in foil but the meat eventually cooked tender in broth.  Finally shredded the beef and placed in soft taco shells with guac, sour cream, and fine shredded cheese.  SO TENDER and came out just slightly spicy...the best beef tacos we've ever made at home.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Amazing! Moist, tender, and delicious without changing a thing.   I will definitely make this again.  Be sure to wrap the meat as tight as you can in the foil to keep the moisture in so it will just fall apart.

Absolutely delicious!! I used mild green chile peppers (which I was concerned that it would be spicy and it turned out perfect, not the least bit spicy).

based on the reviews, I over seasoned this and am, frankly, a little tired of Mexican at the moment.  That said, I wrapped this in foil, put it in my cast iron dutch oven and cooked it as directed.  This is THE way to braise tougher, less expensive cuts of meat.  I, unfortunately, hate crockpot meat.  It always seems to come out drained of flavor and mushy rather than tender. I have cooked at least a hundred pot roasts in my dutch oven but wrapping it in foil seems to be the trick to turning out a juicy, extremely tender piece of meat.  You could do your onion and mushroom soup pot roast this way and I am sure it would come out great. I can't wait to try a variety of seasonings, etc cooked in this manner.

This was awesome! I'd give it more stars if I could. So easy to make and so delicious. I did a Cinco De Mayo/Mothers Day fiesta with the in-laws, and got rave reviews on this one! So much better than regular old hamburger tacos!

Delicious! I made this recipe over the weekend  exactly as the recipe stated. It was very easy and perfectly scrumptious! Just enough seasoning. It definitely did not have a spicy bite to it for all of you spicy eaters out there - it was mild but tasty. I am so happy with this recipe! I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

Very good! While it was cooking it smelled like it was going to be very spicy however it was kind of mild. Would add a touch more spice for my tastes. Used a inexpensive roast and cooked in the crockpot for 8 hours. Could have been done in 6 but it wasn't time for dinner. Added 1/2 cup of water to make sure the meat didn't dry out. Very tender and moist. Think next time in addition to adding more spice I might add 1/2 cup red wine.

This was great! Both my husband and I loved them and now this recipe is going into our favorites. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Like the others, I made this up in the crockpot.  I added 1/2 cup water, mixed together the spices and peppers in a separate bowl and just dumped it over the thawed out roast. Slow cooked it on low and in about 8 hours it was done. It wasn't way too spicy and was so moist and juicy! There were also enough leftovers that I think I won't have to make dinner for a week!

Oh wow!  I just made this, and it is delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly, wrapped it in tin foil, and put it in my dutch oven with the lid on. After I shredded it, I poured the juices back on top of the meat and added a little more salt....mmmm!!

These made great tacos.  I used pork tenderloins and put them in a crock pot till the meat fell apart.  The only other thing I did differently was add a small can of tomato sauce toward the end to thicken it up a little.  Excellent.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Delicious!  I did the slow cooker method...I added about a cup or 2 of beef broth to my slow cooker, rubbed the meat per the recipe and then cooked on high for 6 hours.  The meat was so easy to pull apart and so tasty.  We will be making this again!

Wow 5 star recipe. After the meat is cooked and shredded, I put it in a skillet with a little oil and crisp it up. Have made this twice already and have used pork both times. Delicious!

Used pork instead of beef, and stuck it all in a crockpot.  When cooking in a crockpot, just skip wrapping everything in foil.  Much easier.

Used only two lbs. meat but kept spices the same.  Substituted a fresh jalapeno for the diced variety.  Mixed spices and garlic in 1 T olive oil and rubbed into meat.  Cooked in 2 cups of beef broth to prevent meat from being dry.  Eliminated the salt because broth has salt.  Cooked in crock pot for 4 hours on low.  Very tasty when served on corn tortillas with homemade salsa, avocado, and sour cream.  Rated it a 4 because I had to make all the variations.  With the changes its a 5 star recipe.  Enjoy !

I doubled the chili peppers and added onions and peppers while cooking.  I don't really understand the purpose of the tin foil, but I used it anyway.  I'd try it again with more seasoning because even with my attempt to spice it up more, it could have used more flavor.

Smelled great while cooking, but the meat was very difficult to shred and had no flavor.  None.  We followed the recipe exactly.  What to do with the leftovers?  I'll probably mix the meat with BBQ sauce for sandwiches.

Really good recipe.  I made this for a friend who just had a baby.  I didn't exactly measure everything so next time I will...mine was not as flavorful as I thought it would be but I'm pretty sure I skimped on the chili powder and the cumin.  After I shredded the meat, I put it back in the oven in the juice to stay warm while I made the rice and beans.  Really good!

Very good!  This is a nice change of pace from the pork carnitas I usually make.  I served it with flour tortillas and taco fixin's, and everyone loved it.  I can't give it five stars "as is" because I definitely think the seasoning needs to be increased.  Also, this cut of meat is super-duper fatty, and I had to pick out lots of gelatinous gooey fat pieces from the finished product before I could serve it.  Other than that... extremely tasty!

Delicious!!!  The meat shredded so easily and was tender and juicy.  We ate it on tortillas with cheese and sour cream.  Next time I will double the amount of chiles for more spice and maybe saute up some peppers and onions to serve with it.  My husband made sure there were no leftovers.

I added half a can of tomato broth soup, a sprinkle of cinnamon, doubled the cumin, and a sprinkle of paprika. I cooked it in the pressure cooker for one hour. It falls apart because it is so moist. Delicious!

I tried this recipe because I love carnitas. It didn't work for my taste buds. I made it for a crowd and everyone else liked it though. My husband and I thought that the meat tasted like fajita meat without the onions and peppers. Not at all like a juicy chunk of pork carnita meat.

Okay I didn't use beef. I used a pork shoulder and this recipe. It came out juicy and so tender. The rub was so easy to make and gave it great flavor. I did use a 7oz can of green chilies instead of the 4oz like others suggested. Will make again and will try with the chuck roast.

Loved this recipe! Removed all visible fat and doubled the garlic, cumin, oregano, and chili powder--  I threw it all into the slow cooker, added a chopped onion, 2 fresh serrano peppers, and 1 cup of beef broth.  It took about 6 hours on high.  I shredded the meat and kept the juices separate and added back to the meat as needed.  Served with guacamole, cilantro, and salsa on corn tortillas--  I'll be making this often!

Maybe I should have doubled the ingredients as others have suggested, but I had a 3 pound chuck roast instead of a 4 pound so I used the ingredients as listed and found it somewhat bland.  I made it in the crockpot, wrapped in foil (no need to add extra liquid - it's plenty juicy enough).

I followed what others had said, and put the meat in foil & in the crock pot (and also 2 cans of chiles).  Yum.. it has flavor & heat.  I'm a little mystified by the comments about the flavors being bland...  perhaps the chili powder was too old.

A few changes made this a 5 star. Slow cooker on low for 8 hrs, doubled the seasoning and used 2 cans of beef broth, used 3-fresh roasted poblano peppers (chopped), used 1 large onion-sliced and 2 green peppers-chopped, thrown altogether in slow cooker. Was VERY YUMMY! Used w/corn tortillas

I am sorry I wasted a 13.00 on this.  Like some of the other reviews this had no flavor and I doubled the spices like the others said.  Now I am stuck with a bunch of leftovers.  I will try to put barbeque sauce on the rest and make sandwiches I guess.

The long roast time is worth every minute as it produces the most tender and flavorful meat. My only change is that I dont use canned chopped green chilies. Instead I use the flesh of one or two jalapeno sans seed or pith. I also grind my own cumin seeds which I grow as corriander in my herb garden.

This recipe had no flavor.  I was really disappointed. It also took a lot longer in the oven to come out tender.  I think the recipe has potential and I'll try it again in the crock pot with extra spices.

I don't get the great reviews for this one. I made it exactly as it's written.  The meat was dry and tasted bland.  Needed lots of Salsa to even be edible!  Needless to say, this won't be served at my house again.

This recipe was great!  I made it with pork shoulder roast instead of beef, but it was still spectacular!  It was easy to prepare and even my toddler loved it.  Friends are asking for the recipe!

Like others, I used only a 2 lb. roast but the full amount of spices.  I put the rub on the meat and let it marinade in the fridge overnight.  I then cooked it on low in the slow cooker for 11 hours, adding a cup of tomatillo salsa for extra liquid.  When it was done I still felt like it lacked spice, even though I'd used double what was called for, so I added some cayenne and extra cumin.  Overall it was really tasty.  I did actually feel like mine was too tender (which I didn't even know was possible), but that's just my fault for leaving it in the cooker too long.  I'd like to try roasting it as written because I think it might have a nicer chewy bite.

Came out great.  I used a near-3pound chuck roast, but kept all other ingredients as written with the exception of using a large can of green chiles.  Served on hard-shell tacos along with Garden Tomato Salsa from this website.  Thanks, Miss Annie!

i marinated the meat overnight and doubled the spices (by accident) but it worked well in the end.

This is a good recipe. I used a sirloin tip roast (on sale) and cooked mine in the crockpot all day.  I saw other reviews that said to add liquid (such as beef broth) in order to cook it in the crockpot. Instead of using beef broth/stock, I used about a half cup of salsa.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!!  I put the shredded Beef into a casserole dish and poured the juices on top (after removing the fat from the juice.) The meat absorbed most of the juices while it cooled slightly and came out tender and juicy.  Thanks Ronaldo!!

I just replaced my pork carnitas recipe with this one. I used jalepenos instead of the chile peppers, added 1 Tbsp of paprika, and used a crock pot on low.  It turned out pretty spicy but that's how my family likes it. Great recipe - I'll be using this recipe from now on!

I only had a 2 pound roast but I kept the amount of seasonings the same as suggested by others. It definitely needed all that flavor. It took too long in the oven, I do not own a slow cooker but I see why that would be perfect. I cooked the beef three hours in the oven and 1 hour in a saucepan. It came out very tender and flavorful but basically because of the increased cooking time and the fact that I used more seasoning than suggested (per pound).

This was delicious and so easy! Baked it as recommended and the meat came out moist and tender and shredded beautifully. Have also done the crockpot method & it was equally as good. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Brings back memories at Grandma's House!! Love this recipe. I only used 2lbs of meat but still used the same amount of seasonings, only thing I will do different next time is add a little more salt.

This is one of my favorites. My husband and kids love it. I've made it about 4 times now, and it's delish every time! We make soft tacos on corn tortillas with chopped onion, chopped cilantro and salsa. Yummy!

I thought this actually came out bland.  I cooked in the crockpot like some others and served in tortillas, but needed to add a lot of salsa and other flavorings to make it good.  Definitely better the next day, but still missing something!

This was very yummy! I think it could have used a little more seasoning, but it was still really good. I'll definitely be making this again, but next time I'm going to try it with pork.

The flavor of this was excellent, however maybe it was the chuck roast I chose, but mine never got to the point of "falling apart". I did cook the roast in the crockpot (in which I usually can get a good roast out of). I ended up taking the roast out and cutting it up into bite size pieces, then putting it back in the "juices" and letting it cook on low. It was still very good, even my picky daughter said it was good. I will definately try this again, and look forward to trying it with chicken. 5 stars for a great seasoning mix I will use again!

This is better than any restaurnt shredded beef I have ever had!  My husband and I loved it.  We have made tacos & tostadas with it & I know it will be great with enchiladas & burritos.  The key is to use a chuck roast that IS NOT lean.  You need the fat to make it tender & juicy.  I will make this over & over.

OMG!  This was fantastic!  I prepared it in my slow cooker with about an inch of water under the roast in foil.  It cooked all day.  I doubled the seasoning and then shredded the meat and returned it to the slow cooker for the last 1/2 hour.  Yum!

YUMMM!! Great recipe Ronaldo!!  I substituted contry style pork spare ribs instead of the beef, and it was wonderful!  I also forgot the garlic on accident.  And I served with fresh guacamole on a corn tortilla.  This was a great, EASY, recipe, that I'll make again.  My husband and I loved it!  Thank you!

What a great tasting chuck roast! I didn't have green chiles so I used sliced
onion instead.  Next time I'll use the chiles.  The meat was very tender.

Mouthwatering flavor and so easy! I made this for a dinner party and should have doubled the recipe-it went FAST!  

I would make this every night if I could but I must wait at least a week... only 2 days to go!  I'm drooling just thinking about it.

I was really bummed when I meade this recipe.  It smelled so good while it was cooking and when we took it out of the oven it was soooo tough.  I think maybe it was the meat though-b/c lots of people have said it was tender.  I will try this again-the smell was unbelievable.

We really liked this meat.  It cooked while I was doing other things, very flavorful and so tender it fell apart.  We put this in burritos, I would use it for enchiladas, tacos or any other meat-based mexican dish.

This recipe is awesome!  I recommend after shredding the beef, putting it back into the juices & back into the oven for a few minutes for added moisture & flavor.  (Make sure to add enough salt).  Tastes even better the next day!

Excellent flavor! Excellent texture. This makes the absolutely BEST meat for tacos. We used tortillas and offered cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, cream cheese, etc. and they were a huge hit! I will make this again. Couldn't be easier to mix up the coating; you just have to remember that it takes 3 - 4 hours to cook although it's unattended!

I've made this several times.  Cook slow and low so it doesn't dry out. You can cook this in the smoker and crockpot.  When I use the crockpot I add beer or broth with lime juice.

Since I used 2 separate chuck roasts, I doubled the rub recipe and added 4 tsp salt. I wrapped it in a foil packet and put it in my Instapot with a bit of water in the bottom (2-3 cups), with the peat titling on a rack that came with the Instapot. I put it on the meat/stew setting for 3 hours, and it was fall apart tender.

I used a 3 lb chuck  roast,  doubled the spices. Rushed out really good.  Cooked for 4 hours... didn't shed too easily,  so I chopped/ shredded it. Tasted great!

This recipe was delicious! I used a rump roast  and cooked it in the crockpot with a little beef broth. Turned out perfect! Ate as tacos one night, used the leftovers to make enchiladas for another meal.  Our family of four had enough meat for three  dinners.  Will make again!

I made this only thing I did was a little differently I added a extra tablespoon of all the seasonings and then I had a Hatch pepper and I put all the seasonings in a plastic bag cut up the roast and small pieces left it overnight with the seasonings as a rub dumped everything into the slow cooker and let it cook shredded it and I've used it for everything including Pizza

This is absolutely the best carnitas recipe I’ve made. The green chile and other spices are just delicious. If you properly rest the meat after pulling it apart, part of the juice is reabsorbed, helping the meat stay tender and moist. I will definitely be making this recipe many more times.

I put my roast in the crockpot with 1/4 cup water and left it on high for five hours.  As I always try to stay true to the original recipe, this was good but it was missing...something.  Definitely a good base to start with.

This is to die for!! It falls apart and is so flavorful! I make it with home-made hard taco shells with corn tortillas. You can't beat it.

I did not make exactly as directed, but regardless it's a 5 star.    I used a 2 pound roast instead of a 4, but kept the other measurements the same.   I also added a few jalapeno slices for just a little more kick.   Lastly, instead of wrapping and baking, I used the slow cook function of my pressure cooker.   I cooked it for 4 hours on high.  At about 3 hours, I removed the meat and cut it into smaller pieces to help speed up the break-down.   Fantastic recipe and I will make again.

I liked the technique instead of using the slow cooker, but sorry this just didn't work for us flavor wise. It smelled great, but the end result tasted like nothing except for beef. Opened the foil in the roasting pan and removed meat to platter to shred. Emptied juices into roasting pan and added shredded meat back to juices, and back into the oven for about 30 min. more. This helped the flavor come through a little more, but was still on the bland side.  Tried it the next day and no difference in meat flavor. Used meat for tacos and topped them with chopped red onion, cilantro, and salsa. Might try it again, but would increase the amount of seasoning.

Used all the spices but only about 2 lbs of meat. Turned out great. I also seperated the beef at 3-1/2 hours and put it uncovered in oven set to broil to crisp it up for the last 20 minutes.

Beef did not have a lot of flavor.  Tasted more like a roast than something for a taco.  Veggies were good.

Fantastic! I had to make some modifications based on what I had on the shelf and what I like. Chopped jalapeños rather than chilies, no oregano, more chili powder and a packet of beefy onion soup mix- I know you all hate changes, but for us this was delicious! Made it in the crockpot and used it for nachos on game day. I'll make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe

Made this in the oven as described and it came out very tough, did not shred easily at all, so I salvaged by slicing into thin pieces and adding back the liquid.  Might be a better recipe in the slow cooker as others have described.

I looked at the ingredients and do not see Cayenne pepper but just chili pepper. I use a little chili mix and add the Cayenne. Sweetness is obtained by the use of Paprika at the end of cooking. I seldom bake anything. You must stir any recipe with Paprika or/and cumin. The cumin is added about half way and the paprika near the end, but stir! I use ground beef instead of sliced as it is easier to eat!

This was so good even my kids ate it! Double up on the spices or you won't taste anything. I wrapped my meat in foil and let it sit in the crockpot while I was at work. The whole house smelled amazing when I walked through the door! I served this with a side of spanish rice, iceburg with tomatoes, avocado, and cilantro. Don't forget the sour cream!

This is a great recipe.  The only changes I made were using 7 oz of chopped green chilies (the whole can), and I used Adobo brand seasoning in place of salt and oregano. I cooked it 7 hours in the crock pot.

I also cooked this in the crockpot and it turned out great. I would give it 5 stars but I had to add more seasonings and an extra can of green chilis to up the flavor. Our guests and their small children loved it as well. I will definetly be making this again.

We followed the recipe to a T, and the meat turned out bland and nearly inedible without a liberal dose of green tomatillo sauce.  ZERO FLAVOR!

Very easy and delicious.  I used a 3.5 lb boneless chuck pot roast.  Cooked as per original recipe.  Sauteed some onions and peppers, and served it all up, fajita style.  The meat completely fell apart when forked apart.  Garnish with sour cream and cilantro.  Perfect!  Will make it again many, many times!

This recipe was great! I used a smaller roast (a little under 2lbs), but doubled the seasoning anyway and it came out delicious. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I wrapped the seasoned roast in foil, then cooked it in the crock pot on high for 5 hours. Then I removed the meat, transferred the juices back into the crock pot, put the meat back, and shredded it with two forks. I cooked it for an additional 30 mins on low. Perfect for tacos!

I’ve tried a lot of carnita recipes and this one does produce a moist, tender meat that easily falls apart.  But then again, I wouldn’t expect anything less from a chuck roast.  For me, this tasted like a meat smothered in chili powder and lacked some key ingredients that would really make this traditional Mexican dish stand out.

This turned out fantastic!  I browned the meat on both sides in a very hot cast iron skillet then poured on the spices and a little beef broth.  I then covered the skillet with foil and put it in the oven.  It is fall apart tender and tasty too.  (I didn't bother wrapping the meat itself in foil- no need to do this.)

Tasty! But I followed the recommendations of many others and changed the following: used a 2 lb roast, doubled the oregano, garlic and cumin, plus added a teaspoon of smoked paprika; salted the roast and marinated in the rub overnight; just before cooking poked holes in the roast, added 1/4 cup beef broth and 7 oz salsa verde instead of chiles; after cooking, skimmed fat from juices and mixed in with the shredded meat. Otherwise cooked as directed and was very pleased with the results. 4 stars because the original seasoning seems way off.

I have made this several times, and it is excellent. Instead of cooking in the oven, I put the meat in the crockpot on low in the morning with all the other ingredients and by late afternoon my house smells delicious. Use it for tacos, enchiladas, or even sandwiches. Wonderful!

Fabulous! I followed the measurements but used 2 lbs of chuck roast instead of four. Made in a crock pot and added a bit of beef broth for the last hour or so. We were feeling indulgent so I stuffed the meat in a tortilla, added cheese and a bit of salsa and fried them in a bit of veg oil to make mock-chimichangas. My husband took a bite and said "that's it, we're opening a restaurant!" Thank you, I'll be making this again!

The way I did this was put a 1 lb beef chuck boneless arm steak in the crock pot (only feeding 2 people) and rub it down on each side with about 1 T chili powder, 1 t oregano, 1 T cumin, 6 cloves minced garlic, 1 t salt and 1 t onion powder. I let cook on low for 4.5 hours turning once every hour. Then I shredded the beef and put about 1/4 cup beef broth in. Cooked on low for another 2 hours (the beef soaked up all the broth). It was soooo good. But next time I will make a bigger hunk of meat wrapped up in foil for the first increment of cooking in the slow cooker (so as not to burn) and calculate the increase in spices according to how many lbs of meat there is. I served with homemade pico de gallo and guacamole w/ shredded monterrey jack cheese. uh....YUM! sidenote: I didn't use the green chiles.

This was quite good.  I used a 2.5 lb. roast and doubled the rest of the ingredients and cooked in the slow cooker for 8 hrs.  Made "burrito bols" using rice, black beans, cheese, garden fresh salsa and lettuce.  Very nice meal.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I sub'd a can of jalapenos bc I didnt have any green chile peppers on hand. Also added a can of beef broth to the crock pot as suggested.  I tasted the beef as I was shredding it and it was pretty bland so I double or tripled all the spices.  Served with Avocado, cilantro, diced tomatoes and white cheese on a flour tortilla.  Yum!

Awesome recipe!  I doubled the spices and the green chile peppers and threw into a slow cooker.  Then I shredded the meat and set out like a taco bar.  Everyone loved it!  My picky two year old nephew would eat nothing but the meat!!!

Not my favorite. I must add however, that I didn't use foil or extra water and put it in the crock pot for eight hours. It was a bit dry, and not very flavorful. I did use the leftovers in enchiladas the next day, and they were great.

I thought this was exceptionally bland, and 4.5 hours was not nearly enough time.  Next time I think I try the crockpot and more spices.  I think adding some beef broth would enhance the flavor and make it more tender.

This is great, but you must double the seasonings for true flavor (or it will be bland).  I also double the chile peppers and cook it in the crock pot (adding 1/2 cup of h2o).

This was good. I accidently bought a less fatty roast and it was a bit dry. So I took it out of the crock, cut it up and simmered it in chicken stock and this helped it to get to the "pulling apart so easily" stage. So if you buy a "better" less fatty cut of meat, pour some chicken stock in there to help with the moisture! Other than that very good...

AMAZING! Double or triple the seasoning. I did this in the crock pot for 5 hours, shredded it, doused it with more cumin and left it in the pot for a while. I burnt it a little, but it was still fine! I WILL make this a family recipe!

This is a solid recipe.  Everyone always likes the meat.  It's very mild tasting, even with double the chiles and spices, so I think I'll start throwing a few jalapenos in with it.  I also cook it in the crockpot on low for about 7 hours.

The roast I had in the freezer was 2.5 lbs. I did doulbe all ingredients as other reviewers suggested. I used Mexican chili powder which gave it a kick. I used two cans of green chili. One mild and the other Hot by La Victoria. I used my crockpot and cooked it for 7 hours. My husband and family loved it. This is a keep!

I doubled the spices called for in the recipe, following the advice of other reviewers, the first time I made it.  With the exception of the chilis, I have since tripled the spices.  

I use this recipe for beef that I then shred and use in chimichangas - very good for that!

Absolutley wonderful.  I did increase the spice and peppers since we have a spicer taste preference.  Also cooked it in the crock pot about 6 hours on low with foil placed snugly on top.  Great with fresh flour tortillas!  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I too cooked this in the crockpot and had great results. I used a 2 lb roast, kept the spices the same, and used a 7 oz can of green chilis. Added 1/2 cup of water and cooked on low for 10 hours. I didn't even have to shred the meat... poked it a few times and it all just fell apart. Moist and perfectly tender. I drained the liquid, put it in the freezer for a bit, then skimmed the fat off the top. Returned the liquid to the crock pot with the shredded meat and let it sit for another hour or so. Served it in flour tortillas with shredded cheese, spanish rice, and sour cream. A+ Recipe, will make often!

This recipe was great. My husband kept telling me how good the meat was and asked for this to be a keeper. I made the recipe as given with a frozen chuck roast and put the foil packet in the crockpot before I went to bed. A frozen roast wrapped in foil and put in a crock stays nice and cold. Then I put it on low in the morning to cook for 9 hours. Then I dump the liquid from packet in crock, shred the meat removing all fat and add back to liquid. We vary putting the meat on flour tortillas, sandwiches, taco shells, etc. The leftovers freeze well for a quick meal another night. For variety one night I sliced three onions and  put on top of the roast before wrapping in foil. When the cooking process was done I removed the onion and set aside for each family member to use or not use on sandwich buns with the meat. Yummy.

Way good! I'll be making this one again and again, only I'm going to double up on the chiles and the seasonings.  And I made it in the crockpot because I didn't want to heat up the house.  Delicious and falling apart tender!

This was good.  I made a few changes based on others' feedback.  I doubled the oregano and cumin.  I added 1/2 t onion powder, 1 can HOT Roel and 1 beef bouillion cube.  I put everything in the crock pot and let it cook for about 8 hours.

I used a 2 1/2 lb. chuck roast. I mixed together all of the seasonings along with 1/2 c. chopped onion,  2 chopped chili peppers. I pressed the mixture into both sides of the meat and wrapped it in foil and baked it at 300 degrees for 2 hours and bumped it up to 350 for 2 1/2 more hours. Turned out very tender but it tasted more like a regular pot roast so after shredding it I added a tbl. chili powder and a tbl. spoon cumin, sprinkle of garlic powder and pepper. Made great tacos.

This was mighty tasty!  I made several changes...as follows.  FIrst, I doubled the spices and only used a 2.5 pound PORK roast.  I rubbed the spices on the roast and then seared it on all sides in a pan.  I used one diced onion and a 7 oz can of green chilies.  After I seared the roast, I cooked the onion and green chili together in that pan to get all the seasonings from the roast.  Then I put the roast into foil, put the onion/green chili combo on top of that, wrapped it up and stuck it in the crock pot.  It cooked for 6 hours on low and then cranked it up to high for another 3 hours.  It was falling apart tender and delicious!  I have tried many different ways to cook a pork roast with green chili and I have to say that this spice combo with the green chili and onion is the best we have had so far.  Cooking it in the foil in the crock pot made it so tender and yummy.
Will definitely make this one again!

It was a bit bland for me and my husband.  I also made it in the slow cooker, but I really needed more time because it came out a bit tough.  I gave it 6 hours on low.  Probably needed a good 8 to 10.

I loved this recipe, though I did double the spices and added some jalapenos.  I put it in the crock pot for about 5 hours and it turned out fantastic!!

Love this recipe!  There's only two of us but I made the whole recipe and froze it into batches to unthaw for an easy meal.  

Also discovered a great use for the frozen batches if you don't feel like carnitas: add some sauted onions and mushrooms, smother in barbeque sauce and serve on sandwiches - yummy!

This was okay.  Doubled the spices, put it in the crock pot for 10 hours on low.  Needed an extra zing or more flavor.  The meat tasted like it would be a delicious filling for tamales, but for soft tacos, I'd definitely add something for extra kick.  Probably will not make again.

Excellent recipe!!  I used half the amount of meat but still did the same amount of the rest of the recipe.  It turned out great.  We ate it with all the regular taco toppings and even had leftovers for the next day.  :)

Wonderful. This is a new family favorite. I have made it three times now, and twice of those for guests. It takes care of it's self in the oven so I am free to prepare sides and clean. The only additional ingredient I add is a ground chipotle pepper. Make sure to use a chuck roast. The cut of meat is pretty important.

This was excellent. I never heard of Carnitas until I stumbled on this recipe. It was a new and welcomed variation for a burrito filling. Even with only a three pound roast, I was glad that I doubled the seasonings. Cooked it in the slow cooker without foil (in my case it took 5 hours on high), shredded it, chilled overnight so I could remove the fat, then reheated and served.

This was the best roast recipe!  I wrapped the roast in foil after rubbing it with seasonings. Then placed it in my crockpot on low for almost 9 hours.  Opened the foil and the juices just flowed and the meat fell apart!  Eight year old son and four year old daughter loved the carnitas and asked for them again!  This one is keeper!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

WOW!  I upped the spices based on other reviews and added some Chipotle flakes for smoky heat, but otherwise prepared as directed, in the oven.  It came out moist, tender and DELICIOUS.  Be sure to keep the rendered juices to pour over the shredded meat -- keeps it moist and holds lots of the flavor.  Made tons of tasty tacos.  Even better the next day!

I doubled the spices like other reviewers suggested. I used one can of mild chiles and one can of hot. I like spicy food, but the spice stayed with me. My husband really liked this recipe, which we ate with rice on the side. Next time I think I'll stick with just mild chiles.
EDIT: Ok, I just heated up some leftovers for lunch and had it on a tortilla with onions, cilantro, a squeeze of lime, a little cheese and sour cream. This was better than leftovers are allowed to be!!!

Everyone at my husbands family's house demolished it in less than 10 minutes. 
I doubled the spices. and used tinfoil in the slow cooker. added can of beef broth towards the end.
I didnt like it so much.. with all the spices. but everyone else looooved it. They said it tasted like Birria.

This was perfect.  Great way to use up a chuck roast.  I rubbed some brown sugar on it as well to give it some sweetness.  Great with homemade pico de gallo.

I also doubled all spices in this recipe.  I sealed it all into foil and set it into the slow cooker for 7 hours. At the end I took the meat out of the foil and drained off some of the liquid.  I used this liquid to cook my rice dish.  YUMMY.  I cont. to cook the meat in the crock for 30 more minutes and then served with the rice and Mexican corn cake.  Awesome meal!  The whole family enjoyed it.

I appreciate all the suggestions noted in the ratings.  It helped me create my own version.  I did it stove top with extra jalapenos and canned tomatoes.  I used the pork roast because they were on sale.  I have about 3 dinners in leftovers and the roast was about $6.00.
Thanks everyone!

Hmm, the taste was good but it didn't seem to penetrate the rest of the roast, as for falling apart, it didn't.  I'll try again with a more tender cut of meat.  We did use it as a rub on B/S chicken breast and then grilled - that turned out great.

This recipe is SOOO good, and even easier!  I have made it with both beef and pork shoulder, and it is great either way.  I like food saucey, so I use 1 1/2 times the chilis & spices, plus I add more cumin, because I love cumin.  I've served this to friends & co-workers, and it's always a hit.  Make it - little effort for great rewards - they'll think you're Rachel Ray!!!

I only used a 2 lb roast and it still had no flavor! Good idea - just needs double the spices.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party, and it was a huge hit!  I used the crockpot as advised in another review and could not believe how tender the meat turned out.  Once the meat was fully cooked I drained as much fat off the top of the liquid and then let the meat simmer in the juices until the liquid had totally evaportated.  I also added a little more garlic and cumin while it simmered.  I look forward to making this again!

This method of cooking the meat is so very easy, and it is delicious.  I used pork shoulder in place of the beef and chipotles in place of the green chiles.  My husband and I have enjoyed it in tacos and burritos.  This is a keeper!  Muchas gracias.

This was delicious! I used a 2 pound roast, but left the spice amounts the same. I doubled the garlic, and also added some onion powder and dried cilantro. We served it on tortillas with cheese, salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. The only thing I'll change next time is to put the rub on the night before and let it marinade overnight. I can't wait to make this again.

Hubby and I liked it a lot, kids not so much and they really love Mexican food. I marinated mine overnight, put it in the slow cooker for 8 hours with a 1/2 cup beef broth.

WOW!  This has become a family favorite.  I always add 2-3 times the amount of cumin because my family likes stronger spice, never-the-less it is requested at least every 2 weeks.  The leftovers are always used by my boys the next day for burritos or even on buns as mexican sloppy joes.

This was great! I doubled the spices as suggested, but it was too much....I think as the recipe calls for will be plenty. I also put it in the slow cooker on low overnight after serving it at dinner......it wasn't falling apart until I cooked the heck out of it. Then it was excellent!

These turned out well for us. I think the cooking time is a little short - don't be afraid to let it go an hour or even two longer. The meat seasoning was good, but compared to a very similar recipe I make with pork, the flavors weren't as strong as they could be. Next time, I'll go with my instinct and double the seasoning rub. This is a no-fuss and very affordable meal - thanks so much for sharing!

Have made this twice. Both times I watched the man in my life eat 8 tacos in one sitting! This was great, I doubled the sauce and added the juice of one lime and it came out great. And the leftovers seem to get better everyday. Since there are only two of us, we get a weeks worth of meals from this recipe. Thanks Ronaldo.

Wasn't as good as I was hoping.  Great taste on the outside of the meat but bland on the inside.  My meat also did not shred very well, don't know why.  After adding to burritos along with other condiments, it was good.  Nice change from ground beef.

I have made this several times.  I've used beef and pork.  Both are great!  I use my slow cooker and the meat is so tender and shreds so easily.  I also double all ingredients except for the chili powder.  That I only use 1-1/2 times the amount.  I am not a fan of alot of chili powder.  This is always a hit.  Everyone is always impressed and they have no idea how easy it is to make.  :)

This recipe is amazing.  You do need to use a good choice chuck roast, and do not trim it completely.  You will need some of the fat to not let it be completely dry.  I, too double all of the ingredients to rub...awesome!  I've made it numerous times and it's even better as left overs.  Yummy!

The beef was dry and bland.  I had even added minced onion and extra garlic to the rub.  The next day I added pureed tomotoes to the beef pieces (it did not shred, I had to cut it )and more garlic and it was much much tastier.  Both nights we used it in burritoes.

This was ok - mine did not shred (I tried halving the meat but used the full seasoning and 2.5 hours cooking though).  The flavor was ok - kind of bland though - I added onions as suggested.  Perhaps if you have really good green chiles it would be better (I was out of my regulars and had to use canned Old El Paso).

I mixed in the juices from the roast with my shredded meat and it added great flavor.  I froze the meat and then later made enchiladas in corn tortillas, chimichangas in flour tortillas then fried.  Even the kids ate dinner!

Super easy to make.  Even though it takes 31/2 hours to cook it is worth it.  I made shredded beef burritos for dinner and my husband said it was the best burrito he had ever tasted.  While its cooking you can be doing fun things you like to do.
