Hey Susan, my girls thought this dish was delicious and they gave it four stars, however, my hubby absolutely flipped over it and said, Oh man, definitely five stars"! I did tweak it a bit to suit our tastes. Normally I would brown my meat first so I can drain the fat, but the recipe called for browning the meat along with the vegies, and no draining was mentioned. I did do that but then put everything in a colander to get rid of the fat. I added a green pepper, used red onion and in addition to the tomatos I used about half of a large can of tomato sauce. I also seasoned with garlic and onion powders, cayenne pepper and "Essence". Hubby is home alone every Wednesday night (poor guy. yeah, right) and was not only thrilled with his dinner but also with the "Crunch Drop" cookies I made this afternoon. (also on this site) I rarely see him eat desserts but he polished off quite a few! I'm always looking for different ways to use cabbage, as it's such a nutritious veggie and this was truly great. Thanks Susan!

To anyone who has reservations about trying this recipe: If you like spicy, esp. jambalaya, or rice based recipes - this is truly a great way to combine the beloved with something as mundane as cabbage, voila! This is the umpteenth time I've made this...I was one of the first to review it in '04. Like other reviewers, I've modified this recipe to give it some umph! I use rotel, hot sm. sausage, Creole or Old Bay seasonings...I even throw in a can of black-eyed peas. Cornbread and Iced Tea to boot! Gotta Love it! Yeah, I'm a Texas Girl...

This recipe is delicious.  Based on other reviews, I used beef stock (approx 4 cups) instead of water.  I used 2 cans of seasoned diced tomatoes.  I added Old Bay and cajun seasoning to spice it up. I also added a small can of diced chili peppers as well as a half pkg of dried onion soup mix.  Since others said the rice may get mushy, I cooked my brown rice separately.  I used 1 cup of rice to 1 1/2 cup of water (instead of the usual 2 c water to 1 c rice) so that the rice would cook completely once added in the end.  Delicious!!  Update - I had not made this since I reviewed it in Oct 2006, but I made it again using Andouille sausage instead of smoked sausage.  Gave it lots of flavor and was truly delicious! Give it a try!

If you are familiar with Polish food, this tastes a lot like Golumpki (sp?)but this is much less work. Instead of garlic salt, I used Lawry's seasoning salt; for the sausage I had linguica on hand(Portugese sausage)and it was very good. Kielbasa would also be excellent. I scaled the recipe up so I would have leftovers. I recommend adding water (or perhaps spaghetti/tomato sauce diluted with water) when re-heating this. My family rated this a keeper. If you think your kids don't like cabbage, you'd be surprised how much they'll like this.

This jambalaya started better, but it does not make good leftovers.  It tastes good, but gets mushy.  If you're going to eat it in one sitting, then I would recommend, but if there's only 2 people eating, then either 1/2 the recipe or try something else and save this one for later.

My Wife and I really like this dish.  The cabbage adds a new twist to "jambalaya".  I agree with everyone else on the liquid content. I omitted the water and used three cans of broth, plus a few extra cloves of garlic.  Mmmm!!  I will certainly make this dish again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Yummy!  Hot and spicy.  I used andouille instead of smoked sausage.  Also used brown rice instead of white and added extra beef broth and a can of Rotel with the diced tomatoes.  Added homemade cajun seasoning too.  Awesome!

I thought this recipe was great.  My husband loved it and he is not necessarily crazy about cabbage.  I did what the other reviewers suggested and used broth instead of water.  I also added the red peppers and creole seasoning. You can also play around with the different kinds of sausage. The first time I mad this with the smoked sausage and then the second time I made it, I used Kielbasa.  It is also great if you add some hot sauce to it.  I love mine spicey and serve this with sweet maple cornbread.  They go great together!!

YUM!  This is the best Jambalayah recipe I've found!  My hubby loved it.    I did make a few probably unorthodox changes, I was trying to figure out something to do with the "spiced cabbage water" that was left over after having cooked a corned beef a few nights earlier, since my hubby won't eat cabbage by itself.  I used this as the base for the Jambalayah, and it came out WOW!  I also used Italian Sausage instead of smoked, gave it a little extra kick, and added a bit more spices to perk it up a bit, I also left out the celery and added green peppers.  I am definately going to try this one again.  (Maybe after next time I do corned beef!) LOL...

I'll give it five stars, but I changed almost everything after reading the reviews of others.  I substituted knockwurst for smoked sausage. I added 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1. I used a 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes, chopped in their juice. I omitted garlic salt and instead used 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1 jalapeno pepper (finely minced), 1 tsp oregano, and 1/2 tsp thyme.  I browned the onions, garlic and celery in some oil before adding the meat.  I browned the ground beef and knockwurst before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I brought the mixture to a boil, lowered the flame, and simmered the mixture covered for 25 minutes.  When I was done, my daughter and husband gave this dish high praise by eating their entire portions. My daughter is a picky eater who at first tried to pull out pieces of the cabbage. When I next look up, her plate was empty! :D

This is great every time.  I kinda liked it better without the beef, but loved it both ways.  I always add an extra veggie or two with the rice... cauliflower or broccoli or bell peppers, or celery - whatever's in the fridge.  So yummy!  Just make sure to use a big enough pot, this one-dish meal really expands!  It really doesn't even take that long to cook using white rice, this is definitely our favorite sub-30-min meal.  Don't forget the Slap Ya Mama!  (or whatever spicy salt you like)

I decided to try this because Susan said her son liked it.  I was looking for a homey, comfort recipe that included cabbage, and... wahla! I knew from the start there would not be enough water for 1 cup of rice, however I tried the recipe as written and wound up adding a can of broth and at least 2 cups more water! I also did not want all the meat listed so I used only 1 lb of ground turkey and seasoned it highly with cajun spice and garlic pepper.  Not appealing visually, but this tastes REALLY GOOD witha touch of hot sauce added. Have french bread on the side. I would recommend this.

The whole family loved this! I didn't put the rice in, so I didn't add the extra liquid (low carb diet for a while).  I know that the rice would have put this over the top!
Delicious!

This was really good. I also subbed a can of Ro-Tel in place of the tomatoes and added some beef broth and extra water.  I cut down the rice to 2/3 cup but I think next time I'll use the full cup. The Ro-Tel made it too spicy for the kids, but Hubby and I loved it.  He said it was a keeper - high praise indeed!  It does make a lot, enough for at least 5 adults.  Great with cornbread on the side!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Very very good!  It was easy to make(i cut my finger cutting the cabbage though :( ).  I added some cayenne and a red pepper to give it more appeal.  Instead of the canned tomatoes, I added two real tomatoes and a little can of tomatoe sauce.  I also omitted the celery.  Everyone liked it alot, and all took seconds.  Definately a recipe to keep!

I was pleasantly surprised by the recipe; I took some of the suggestions of others and used chicken broth instead of water, omitted the celery, used Rotel instead of the stewed tomato, and used lean ground beef and turkey italian sausage.  I also cooked my rice seperately and used a long-grain wild rice, pilaf style mix with added diced veggies because I was worried about the "blandness" that others had mentioned.  In hindsight, plain rice would have been fine.  Next time I'll add two cans of Rotel instead of one, and use plain white rice.  Overall, very pleased and will be making again soon.  I served with blackeyed peas, Mexican cornbread and potato salad.

This was just fantastic!! Even my kids ate it (of course they didn't realize there was cabbage in it). I'll definitely make this again but I think I will spice it up a little with some Cayenne. Excellent!!

Yum!  I used ground turkey, and chicken andouille sausage.  I added some Cajun seasoning and bay leaf.  They didn't have stewed tomatoes at Trader Joe's, so I just used a can of diced tomatoes instead.  I also used brown rice instead of white. After i added the cabbage, I couldn't really stir the pot. The only thing I'd change next time is to add the cabbage later since I like my veggies slightly crispy.  I'd also consider doing a half recipe since I don't have a very large stock pot.

I really liked this.  I'd give it 5 stars but I did change it a little and my husband hasn't tried it yet... so, we'll see.  I left out the rice and extra water because I figured it was just empty carbs that didn't add any flavor.  I also used a little Tony's cajun seasoning at the end.

Super easy and Super changeable. I didn't have a can of stewed tomatoes so I added extra water and a few chopped tomatoes. Even threw in some corn from last night's dinner.

I have made hundreds of recipes from this site. I'm reviewing this one first because it's my favorite. I make it just as it is and it's great or I recently started added a big bag of coleslaw instead of the head of cabbage when I'm pressed for time. I've also used two cans of tomato soup to make it taste more like cabbage rolls and that's great as well. Thanks for putting it on Susan, it's my Grandson's favorite food (he's fifteen months old)

This was much better than I expected.  Even my picky 2 year old liked it.  I cooked the meat, onions and celery and could tell it was going to be way too much food for us.  I put half of the cooked meat into the freezer and proceded with the recipe...using the full amount of cabbage and rice and beef broth in place of the water.  I did add quite a bit extra garlic, however.  We found there was plenty of meat in the finished product with only half of it in there.  Plus I have a head start next time I make it!  Thanks for a new weeknight favorite!

My family loved this very much.  I used spiced diced tomatos, a ham hock, and veggie broth instead of water.  It is really good on cold nights.

This was such a quick and easy meal.  I have never cooked with cabbage before and I was a bit nervous about the result, but my husband and I loved it. We like smoked sausage, but I was sick of my same old recipes so I tried this and it was great. I omited the celery because I didn't have any and I felt it could use a bit of salt, but otherwise it is very yummy!!

Delicious with a few changes.  I used low-fat polish sausage and added sliced red peppers.  The peppers added flavor and color.  I also used 1 can of beef broth instead of all of that water.  Creole seasoning added a kick.  We really enjoyed this, and had plenty of leftovers!  Be sure you have a big pot to cook this in.

My fiance was a little skeptical when I told him what I was cooking (he explained what REAL Jambalaya was). Well, when it was done he didn't have much to say because he was too busy stuffing his mouth! I loved it, my kids loved it. A terrific,hearty meal. Will serve again and again. THANKS!!

I needed to use my largest pot for this recipe.  I also added a cup of broth as it needed more liquid I felt.  It seemed bland so I added herbs and spices to give it a more Creole taste.  The recipe makes a very large amount and I should have halved it as I don't like leftover cabbage.

Wow was this suprising! No beef, just a ring of smoked sausage.  Bag of cole slaw mix, Onion, celery, garlic, can of rotel, can of tomatos, and a cup of water with beef bulion in it.  I added some sprinkle of Old Bay and Creole spice... a bit of Thyme, boiled for 30ish minutes...  Made rice on the side.

This needed a lot more seasoning for our tastes. I did the seasoning suggestions from the #1 review and it was still pretty bland. I'm sure it needs Creole seasoning to give it that jambalaya flavor, and probably a bell pepper too. Thanks for sharing.

This is a pretty heavy dish.  So much meat & very thick.  It was a bit much for us.  Maybe for a large amount of people it would be ok.  I love cabbage, but there was so much meat, just the sausage would've been fine.

I was all set to make cabbage rolls and then I came across this recipe, this resulted in not having some of the ingredients.  It was still wonderful though.  Here's what I did:  I used 1lb. lean gound beef and 3 turkey sausages.  I cooked them as per the recipe with the onion and fresh garlic.  (I used 4 small cloves)  While that was cooking, I had my instant rice cooking in another pan. When I added the cabbage, I also added the rice, 2 cans of Campbell's tomoto soup (I didn't have canned tomatoes), 1 can of water, S&P, and 2 tsp of smokey flovored hot sauce.   I then simmered for about 15 minutes and served. I enjoyed it and my husband gave it 5 stars and said he was glad we didn't have the celery.  (He thought it would taste weird)  This is a great base recipe, I was just confused when it was called Jambalaya but didn't have anything spicy in it.  So tweak it to your liking and enjoy!  Side Note - I had what I would call a small head of cabbage and I only used 3/4 of it.  I thought that was PLENTY. (See photos)

YUM!  I love recipes like this that give you a jumping off point to be creative with.  I took a lot of advice from previous reviews to make this my own.  I treated it like a gumbo and added everything but the kitchen sink, (potatoes, carrots, a can of corn, a can of diced tomatoes in addition to the stewed, a can of black beans), and kicked it up a bit with some cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper flakes. I used chicken broth instead of water, no celery, (my family just doesn't care for it), turkey burger instead of hamburger, and beef kielbasa.  I served it topped with a dollop of sour cream, some shredded cheddar cheese, and drizzled in Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Very filling, spicy, and delicious!  Thanks!

Very good!! I used chicken broth in place of the water and I also used more cabbage and liquid than the recipe called for. To kick it up a notch I added more spices to make it more flavorful. I plan to make it again soon for when my husband goes hunting.

This was a huge hit with my husband and brother-in-law! I'm not a huge cabbage fan, so I was skeptical, but it came together perfectly. I actually used ground turkey instead of beef and it was still very tasty. I added carrots and a red pepper, and a bit of cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes as a seasoning. This recipe lends itself to variation and experimentation - a definite keeper!

The steps in the recipe need to be more user friendly for amatuers.  I.e.  use oil, 2 tblspn to brown the veggies.  How about how to add the spices, crushed or as is.  Overall I give this recipe a 4.

I recommend you exchange a bottle of beer for the water.  Also, drop the stewed tomatoes and substitute two 8 oz cans of tomato sauce.  This is a fantastic recipe.  It gets better the second day..

We thought this was a bit bland.  I will try again adding more garlic, garlic pepper, green chili peppers, and a couple more seasonings that I like such as, Cavender's Greek Seasoning and Fiesta Fajita.  These are great seasonings with a lot of flavor and very versatile for all meats, soups, chowders, beans, etc.  I get them at Wal-Mart.

For a 3 qt crockpot, use 2-4 slices bacon, chopped, 1 lb smoky sausage, sliced, 1 onion, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 head green cabbage, Saute in dutch oven to wilt the cabbage.  Add 1/2 c rice, 3 tomatoes, 1 c V-8 juice (or a can of tomatoes), 1 can blackeyed peas for the best New Year's Day meal ever.  5 hours on high.  Cornbread is a great side for this.  Suggestions to add rotel or green chiles a good idea, try a touch of sour cream on your plate.  Terrific, man-pleaser.

Great dish - didn't have celery on hand so used bell pepper. I used "Chicken/apple" sausage and extra lean hamburger (which made it lower in fat),Napa cabbage and added some Mexican seasoning.

On Thursdays, we play winter league darts and so dinners are always rushed. Therefore, I thought I would make this fairly easy recipe. I used beef broth (and more of it based on previous reviews-thanks) and pre-shredded coleslaw cabbage. I personally wasn't crazy about the taste but my boyfriend and roommate loved this. They each had a couple of bowls. I might make it again and send it with them we they go up north during hunting season.

You need to add more water than given in the recipe. I added some hot salsa to spice it up a bit. I agree with other reviewer who felt it wasn't very eye appealing but it is very tasty. Barb G.

This was a hit with the whole family.  Like others suggested I used broth instead of water and also used an 8oz of preshredded cabbage.

As a newly pregnant mom to be I'm on the look out for nutritious dishes that my family can eat. I replaced some of the brown rice with lentils and garbanzo beans for an extra healthy kick- and added crab meat- all great for baby development. It was delicious even without adding jambalaya spices!

the was fantastic and simple!! this time i stuck to the original recipe, the next i may try some of the changes other people suggested. the only thing that would have been a nice addition is some heat.  it isn't spicy at all.

Very yummy!  I couldn't believe my youngest picky eater enjoyed it. Only addition I made was added a beef boulion cube.  The reason for the 4 stars is that to my personal serving I added jambalya seasoning and hot sauce and my son wasn't thrilled with it... but he ate it all. ;) Will definitely make again.  Thanks.

Great recipe! The family LOVED the dish. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I didn't have celery on-hand so used celery seed instead. Also, I took the advice of one of the reviewers and added some tomato sauce (about 6 oz.). I would have preferred to use beef stock, but I only had chicken, so that's what I supplemented for the water - I used 26 oz and about 85% of it boiled off while simmering. Be careful not to overcook the rice! All-in-all, this dish was very simple and delicious... it has been saved to make again and again!

I was surprised at how good this tasted!  I did make a few revisions to the recipe tho.  In addition to the can of stewed tomatoes, I added a small can of tomato sauce, pepper and creole seasoning while rice was cooking.  I will definitely be making this again!

Using andouille sausage in place of smoked sausage, and beef broth in place of water, plus adding a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning blend (I used Penzey's) makes this excellent.  I also added some chopped poblano and chili peppers.

This was fantastic.  My 2 1/2 and 4 year old picky eaters actually ate their entire bowls.  I made a few changes though based mostly on other reviewers...  I substituted 2 cups of beef broth for the water.  I added an entire can of tomato sauce, I used a red onion instead of a regular onion, I added a chopped green pepper.  Since I added more liquid, I also put in 1 1/2 cups of rice instead of just the one.  Extra seasonings included oregano, emeril essence, garlic salt, pepper... I added cayenne pepper after I took out the kids' portions!  ;)

Fantastic!  Fantastic!  Fantastic!  Substituted turkey ground meat for the beef, spicy sausage for smoked sausage, tomatoes with chilies, extra can of roasted tomatoes, chicken broth instead of water, and brown rice instead of white.  All I can say, IS YUMMY!!!!!  My kids loved it too - that's just plain amazing!  This is a keeper!!!!!  My husbands already asking when will I make it again?

This elicited an "I love cabbage!" from my 3-year-old son. Definitely a keeper. I subbed in ground turkey, turkey sausage, and brown rice and it was still flavorful and filling.

Great one pot meal. I love that the rice isn't cooked separately. I used leftover crumbled hambugers and ham from the freezer. We like spicy food so I used Rotel instead of plain tomatoes and added spicy cajun seasoning. I really enjoyed the cabbage. This tastes like a cross between jambalaya and cabbage rolls. This looks like a great kid friendly meal. Would be great with corn muffins.

My family loved this dish. Especially my picky 3 yr. old. I made the following changes: instead of using ground beef, I used ground turkey and 1 lb. of turkey sausage. I added one diced red pepper and in place of the stewed tomatoes I used one can of cream of mushroom soup. The last thing I did was to use chicken stock in place of water for more flavor. It came out delicious and my family asked that I put this in my favorite recipes book.

A great recipe that is easy to make. I reduced the suggested amount of water and added a can of tomato sauce that was seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano. Add a splash of Louisiana hot sauce and you will have yourself a great meal. Will definitely make this again!!!

Recipe was good, but I thought it would need more and agreed with other reviews that it's not Jambalaya without any Creole or Cajun seasoning.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, which also had roasted garlic in it.  Since I did not have any ground beef, I used ground turkey.  I am not sure how much creole seasoning I used, but I evenly sprinkled it over the meat, onion, and celery.  I did the same over the diced tomatoes, cabbage, and rice. I used 1 c. white rice and 1.5 cups water.  Personally, I thought this dish looked more like it was going to be soupy.  I removed it from the heat after 25 min, uncovered the pot and let it stand about 5-10 minutes.  The liquid absorbed, but it still seemed mushy to me.  Next time I will cook the rice separate and add it to the pot towards the end of cooking.

This recipe is phenomenal! Not to mention extremely easy to make. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great. I was worried about the flavor since it included ground beef, but everyone, including my 5 year old loved it! This dish allows for plenty of leftovers (have a family of 4). For those who like a bit of spice, a couple of drops of Tabasco will do the trick for individual dishes! My husband did this since the rest of us don't like extremely spicy food. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very adaptable meal I found it to be a bit bland but you can add what ever you like to it. What a great way to use cabbage!

I'm not sure what happened but this did not have a traditional "jambalaya" consistency. And how can a jambalaya recipe not call for cajun seasoning?  I added it of course, but the overall dish came out a little mushy.  The taste was like a cabbage roll, just without all the work of rolling each cabbage leave which is why I gave it a 3 and not two because I happen to like cabbage rolls.  Unfortunately I will not be making this one again.

Used turkey sausage, brown rice, and ground turkey in place of ground beef, seasoned with some creole seasoning. We had red cabbage. Kids (9&11) gave it 4 and 5 stars. Easy meal...thanks!

Thanks to you reviewers for your wonderful ideas!  We all love this dish.  I'm sort of a crockpot freak, so I just throw everything all together (after I've browned and drained the meat).  I use skinny Italian sausage, sliced, and regular ground beef.  I get the coleslaw package and add it along with the tomatoes, some beef broth, and a can of tomato soup.  I use the rest of the ingredients as written.  I also think that many cooks use seasonings that are "tried & true" for them, and hate to see a recipe get bad reviews because they are too bland.  Season it up!

Absolutely fabulous!!! I took the advice of adding cajun seasoning and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.
We joked about licking our plates. Thanks so much for sharing.

Like others have said, this is a great basic recipe. When I made it for my daughter and the dayhome children, I stuck to the way it is because it's nice and simple for them. I also let them add some sour cream if they seemed a little iffy to try it. 
When I make it for a potluck or more "grown-up" tastes, I will take some of the suggestions and alter the type of sausage/spices etc. 
Still, since I am really cooking for a lot of children most of the time, this is  a wonderful recipe and I'm glad I found it. Fills the little ones up nicely after a day of tobogganing and they don't even know they are eating EWWWW CABBAGE lol! And for that alone I will give it 5 stars. :D

Good basic recipe, but mine was lacking in flavor.  When I warm it up again I'm going to try adding some oregano, thyme, paprika, pepper and maybe some tomato paste.  It has possibilities.

I tried this recipe for the first time about a month ago, I will be doing it again tonight.  It was exceptionally good.  The first time my son tried, he wasnt that thrilled but then said well maybe it was to hot.  He ate some for lefterovers and that said I was wrong mom, this is the bomb, being he is a pick teenager I was impressed, because if its not fried he dosent want it.  The only thing I will change in the futer is since I use regular rice I will precook it and then mix in.

My whole pot of jambalaya turned to mush in the time it took for the rice to cook!  What a disappointment.  I would recommend cooking the rice seperate, and then adding to the remaining ingredients.  The flavor was wonderful, so I will try again with less cooking time.

This was a great dish. The only thing I changed was adding an extra can of tomatoes. I think you could easily eliminate the ground beef and go with all sausage if you like. Will definitely make again.

Mmmmm....good (after some adjustments).  I found the cabbage ratio to be a bit high, even considering that I was using a 2lb package of burger, so I also added some extra rice and 2 extra cans of tomatoes with jalepanos.  In addition, to combat the blandness of the dish and make it more in the traditional jambalaya flavor I added 2 fresh jalepanos, 1/2 tsp of red pepper, 1/2 tsp of old bay, and 4 extra garlic cloves.  It also helped to substitute chicken broth for the water, and due to the extra rice I ended up using about 34 oz of broth.  Even so, it was not runny at all...if anything could have used a little more liquid.  With a bunch of garlic salt and a little black pepper, this was a dish that my bf LOVED (until I told him it was cabbage, anyway...whoops!)  This has been added to my regular cooking reprotoire...thanks Susan!!

I tried this recipe for the first time 2 weeks ago and it was a huge hit with my hubby and I. I have since passed the recipe on to several others, and everyone loves it.  It reminds me of stuffed cabbage without the added work of rolling in cabbage leaves. I did however change the sausage to a mild italian and added basil to this recipe. My son and his family rate it awesome ! Thanks Susan for a new twist on sometimes boring cabbage !!

Cabbage Jambalaya    What a GREAT recipe. Sounded differnt and good so I tried it for supper. It was a "You can make this again dish". I used half a can of tomato sauce  for a little more liquid. Also I used hamburger and kielbasa because it was what I had on hand.I will make it again. Thanks!!

This came out so good! I did however alter the recipe a little bit by using chicken broth instead of water, added a chopped green bell pepper, ground turkey instead of beef, added cayenne pepper and Tony’s seasoning. I also skipped the rice (I’m just not a rice person) My boyfriend and co-workers loves it!  Next time I’ll try this recipe and add okra.

This was not my favorite for a couple of reasons. It definitely did not call for enough liquid to adequately cook the rice (unless it was supposed to be minute rice - which was not indicated) I added one more can of tomatoes and a can of rotel as there was no spice at all. In addition I still needed a bit more water. The other issue I had was the lack of salt and pepper called for - I added quite a bit. At the end of the day this recipe was just ok and I would not likely make it again.

Very good.  We really liked it.  I added a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper,  probably 1/8 tsp.

I love this recipe! I used cans of Rotel and beef broth. Had kielbasa so I used that. Added a big squirt of siracha at the end. Delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is great comfort food and really flexible. I used beef broth in place of water and a box of Zatarains jambalaya rice for a fuller taste. It makes a TON (getting 4 freezer meals for 4 out of it). The second night we had the leftovers, I mixed in about 1/4 C of parmesan and layered mozzarella on top top to change the taste a bit.  That was really delicious too! I served it with cornbread. Perfect meal.

Delicious! I used about 2 pounds ground beef added seasoning while browning it. Reminds me of the cabbage roll soup I made. Will definitely make again.

This was great.   I followed the directions, but made the following changes - I used two cups of beef broth instead of water,  I added a can of Rotel (original with liquid), 3 cloves of shaved garlic, and only half a head of cabbage chopped.

Cooked on the stove and came out great.  Everyone loved it and went back for more.

I put everything in the crock pot (no browning), and it was perfect for our taste. Very similar to a recipe I have for Unstuffed Cabbage Casserole but with the addition of the Kielbasa. I cooked it for about six hours on low.

I made this recipe as you see it, but opting for the broth rather than the water.  If I were to make this recipe again, I would brown the gr. beef separately, fry some bacon and add some seasoning salt and more minced garlic to the drippings.  Some crushed red pepper and or sugar if you would like.  I would then proceed with the recipe and add the bacon bits from earlier for the last 5 minutes.  Recipe a bit bland as it is, if revised I would give it a 5 star rating!

Made it by the recipe, but added salt and used Conecuh sausage which had a little bit of kick to it.  I shared this with  a friend as well and her family loved it too.  Thank you!

Home canned tomatoes in my cupboard for stewed tomatoes. Added a few drops of Ronnie's Revenge (Cajun green chili sauce, made in La. only available on Mackinaw Island, Mi!).  My husband loved it and I like easy. Will make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was great, the only change I would make would be less rice. The rice overwhelmed the cabbage.

I only left out the shrimp, and it still was very tasty. I did add some hot sauce to taste after cooking. That made it more Cajun! Shrimp are just to expensive, and don't add much flavor. So I did not include them. As I live alone it was supper for several meals.

Great and easy to make.  I read most of the reviews bf I started so I decided to not use water but only beef broth. Added more beef broth so I could also add more rice.  The finished pot tasted a little bland to me so I added a couple Table spoons of Italian  Seasoning.

Easy and good. However, I do not like spicy foods but this was bland to me. Perhaps I should have used Andouille sausage instead of the smoked.

(Previously reviewed, guess I have two accounts)

Somewhat bland but most likely due to my substitution of italian for smoked sausage. I was in a rush and should have looked a little harder. 

Either way this was a good wintertime meal and my wife and I both got lunch out of it as well, for less that $25! I would make it again, plus I've lined up another jambalaya recipe...

A good wintertime meal but somewhat bland, probably because I substituted italian sausage for smoked sausage. I was in a rush and should have spent more time looking... 

Either way, I would make this again plus my wife and I both got a dinner and lunch from the recipe, for less than $25!

I made this recipe exactly as described, using ground beef and turkey wieners.  My husband and I both loved it.  There was very little left over.  We will definitely make it again.

I made this, didn't put as much cabbage as recipe called for cause I only had 1/2 head of cabbage, but I'm glad I didn't put in a whole head.  Also didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead.  Overall the dish came out excellent and will definitely make it again!

I made this tonight for the first time and it was easy and delicious! I only made a couple of changes by adding a large carrot chopped, (2) 13 oz lite kielbasa, because we like extra, 3 1/2 stalks of celery,  a can of low sodium chicken broth in place of the water, some everything bagel seasoning and some ground pepper. The whole family loved it. It's easy to make variations to your liking with this recipe. I will definitely keep this in our dinner rotation. Yummy!!!

After reading reviews of this recipe, I also used beef stock in lieu of water, Cajun seasoning, red onion and pepper jack cheese stuffed sausage. I’m impressed with how tasty and easy this meal was. I’m definitely going to cook this again!

I made this recipe using a couple of the suggestions here like, I  used broth and I also used Old Bay Seasoning which made it more spicy.  Our family loved it and I will be making it again.  It was very easy and only used 1 pot.

We liked it.  I made a few modifications as suggested in the reviews.  I used turkey hamburger and I didn't have any rice so we used orzo on hand.  Used creole seasoning and some cayenne pepper.  I used tomato sauce in addition to tomatoes and water.  We will make this again.

Delicious! Next time will do with beef.

If you are doing a KETO based diet you can really lessen the carbs by using riced cauliflower.It comes frozen in a bag so you would use much less water and shorter cooking time by cooking rice in micro wave per instructions and adding it to meat/veggie mixture.I did this , mixed it all together and baked it for 20 mins.Delicious !

Only used 1/2 lb hamburger, added a few shakes of Old Bay Seasoning, subbed 1 can beef broth for water, and used Uncle Ben's long grain white rice. Followed directions. It was SO good! Ate with Krusteaz Southern Cornbread Mix. We liked it a lot and it's very easy!

I'll definitely make it again! Everybody loved it! I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and added a tiny bit of cajun seasoning(didn't need much!). Super easy, I think this might be really good with some cheese melted over it too!

While this wasn't bad, my biggest criticism is it tastes nothing like jambalaya. It's more like stuffed cabbage.

I gave this 4 stars since I did make a few changes.  I made this with fresh cabbage from our garden and it was delicious.  I added green pepper because I had one. There are only two of us so I used one turkey kielbasa and no other meat.  I did use beef broth instead of water and rotel tomatoes, we like things on the spicy side.  Those are the  changes, other ingredients were as called for in the recipe.  I will definitely make this again, especially when I have fresh cabbage in the garden!

We all loved this and it's very easy to make. I did use broth instead of water, Italian sausage instead of ground beef, added creole seasoning instead of garlic salt, and added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar. Yum!

Actually, I have a question: How could this recipe have 1610 mg of sodium when there is no salt added to the recipe?  I'm sure the sausage adds some salt but not THAT much!  Also, how much is one serving - 1/2 cup, 1 cup, 2 cups??  Thanks to anyone who has the time to answer my questions - I'd like to try this recipe but have to carefully watch my salt intake!

This was FANTASTIC!!  I did make some changes as others suggested.  I used beef stock instead of water.  I added a can of black-eyed peas and a jalapeno for a little heat.  To that I added to hefty shakes of Tony Chachere's.  It's a keeper!!  I used my instapot.  7 minutes on high pressure using the manual feature.

This is a great way to get cabbage into my family's diet.  All 4 kids enjoyed it.  I made the rice separately and added it to the mixture to cook for the last 5 min.  I did add some cayenne pepper as well.  I expected the flavor of the dish to be bold, but it was subtle.  Good though.  I may use more sausage or maybe a bolder sausage next time, or add some additional spices.

Amazing!  I added garlic paste, substituted beef broth for water and double the amount, added old bay seasoning and Franks hot sauce.  Add rice last 5 minutes before you serve. Will definitely make this again.

I followed recipe as written, except, I had no garlic salt. Substituted celery salt instead, worked fine. The flavors jump out at you - really excellent. Love cabbage and it is truly a great addition to jambalaya.  Make it- you won’t be sorry.

Very good. Will make this again. I subbed diced ham for the sausage because that is what I had in the frig. Used beef broth for the liquid.

Absolutely delightful for a cold, rainy day!  I'm not a big fan of cabbage but this dish changed my mind.  I did modify the recipe a little bit - used ground turkey instead of ground beef, used two 15 ounce cans of diced tomatoes (one that was fire roasted for some extra kick), about a teaspoon of Old Bay, and some dehydrated onion mix.  This is definitely a keeper!  Might even have to experiment with adding in some shrimp next time.

My family loves this. My kids fight over the leftovers, if there is anything left over! I use ground turkey and turkey sausage, and then petite diced tomatoes (family doesn't like big chunks of tomatoes) and an extra can of tomato sauce to give it a tangier taste. yumm.

I don't understand why we didn't like this dish.   I used a lot of good ingredients.  I even followed the directions to the T with the  exact ingredients.  I even added more spices trying to make it tasty but it didn't work.

I made the recipe as directed. I will tweak it next time I make it. I suggest doubling up on the sausage and tomatoes. There's really not enough liquids in this to bring it to a boil without burning the bottom.

Easy, quick and oh-so-good!  I used ground turkey, brown rice, turkey smoked sausage and chicken andouille sausage.  I also added finely chopped bell pepper instead of celery and I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning.  My 11-year old Son absolutely loved it and so did my Husband!

This is a good weeknight, healthy-ish skillet dinner.  I didn't change much other than I just added some rice I had left over (nearly eliminating the liquid because of that). I also added some creole seasoning  (Tony Chachere's) which I don't recommend unless you account for the salt. I didn't realize salt was the first ingredient.  I'll just add cayenne next time.

I loved it!  Always looking for recipes with cabbage.  I used what I had at home, so no celery this time.   I used cooked rice instead, and added it to the pot.  I used beef broth like previous reviewers. Next time I may use chicken and/or shrimp, and will definitely double the recipe.

Very easy and tasty as written.  My husband added more spice but my preschoolers and I liked the flavor.  Only thing I'd change is to start rice first and cook separately to ensure it's done and that would have reduced overall prep time.

EXcellent-I used vegetable stock in place of water. As Rachel Ray always said, why add water when you can add favor. Next time I'll try adding a little shrimp.

I made this exactly as written but next time I will use beef broth instead of water-didn't see the other reviews until after I'd made it- and also seasoned salt. I did not brown the ground beef first because it was lean-90% I think. Husband loved it too.

I loved this! I found this recipe by using the ingredient search, and am I ever glad. I will definitely make this again! I used hot Italian sausage and balsamic rice. I believe this recipe will certainly serve more than 6. I cut it in half and served 3 with a good bit left over. I've never looked so forward to leftovers the next night.

I'm always looking for different recipes and this one is a great one. I did modify some things. I couldn't use onions due to my fiance's allergies however I added a lot of onion powder. Also instead of water I used beef broth and instead of regular rice I used the Jambalaya mix by Zatarains. #PERFECT

Good recipe, I only made a couple of changes.  I used to gloves of garlic, I also added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. I also served this over rice, instead of cooking the rice in with the cabbage.

I found this to be totally delicious!! I only made 2 changes and that was to use brown rice and add 2 cans of water or broth instead of 1. I found it to be just as good the second day with my changes. Loved it! Thanks for the recipe Susan.

Following other reviewers suggestions, I used a quart of beef broth, added an extra can of tomatoes and Creole seasoning, used ground beef and andouille sausage, and brown rice. Really enjoyed it, and it makes enough to feed a small army.

I've had this recipe saved since 2003 and finally made it. It was OK but too many ingedients--some got lost in flavor. Did use beef broth and a touch of Pickapepper sauce. Probably won't make again.

This was a great base recipe!  Like about 180 other reviewers, I changed it up.  Used chicken broth, browned the meat before adding onions, seasoned the beef with cajun seasoning, omitted the garlic salt, used a can of diced tomatoes with onions and garlic.  Absolutely amazing!  Family gave it an A+.  None of them like cooked cabbage, by the way.  They loved this!

Loved this. Made with extra can of beef broth and extra can of stewed tomatoes.  Does make a huge batch but at least I know we have something good to eat for the next couple of nights.

Was looking for something to cook ahead that was hearty but veggie loaded. I added extra cabbage and some shredded celeraic. My whole family (including 2 children, aged 2 and 6) loved this. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought it was okay. My husband enjoyed it. My daughter ate the cabbage. I wish I would have added extra water as suggested by other users. I had to drain it to serve it. It was nice change in a dinner menu but I won't be making it again. It makes a lot! This dish is just too much for my family.

This was an unexpected success!  Even my cabbage haters loved it and asked if they could have it again the next day, and my crew isn't keen on leftovers. I made 2 changes. 1. sauteed the cabbage in a T of bacon drippings.  Added the  crumbled bacon (5 strips) to the jambalaya.  2) I chopped carrots and added those, because I didn't have celery.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It was fantastic and inexpensive.  A new family favorite.  Very satisfying on a rainy fall day.

We loved this easy recipe, although we did change the ingredients to suit what we had on hand.  All of the basics were the same, but instead of ground beef, we had chicken-apple sausage and some steamed shrimp that were seasoned with Old Bay Seasoning.  The Old Bay was a nice touch!  We will definitely enjoy the leftovers.

I thought this was very tasty, however, I had to make some adjustments and it was mushy by the time it had finished cooking(I'll cook rice separate and then add at end next time).  The adjs. I made were: put 2 cans of tomatoes in, left out the ground beef,only used the sausage, doubled the liquid due to rice needing it(I used broth) and lastly I added a couple of tsp. of cajun seasoning(to put some heat in).  Even though I gave it a 3(had to because of all the changes) my daughter(22) said it was a 4 (she didn't see all the adj. but loved it). It makes A LOT of food.

I really liked this recipe! I used ground turkey and turkey sausage to make it a bit lower calorie. And I used a second can of tomatoes as one just didn't seem like enough.

Very easy to prepare and quite tasty.  I used beef broth instead of plain water,  smoked turkey sausage, threw in 4 cloves of garlic and 3/4 tsp salt instead of the garlic salt.   Great recipe to get my kids to eat cabbage.  There was plenty of leftovers since it makes a huge pot of it.  I'm sure they'll be gone by the next time around though.

Instructions were easy enough to follow, and it's easy to make, but I did not care for it at all.It makes quite a potful, so you must be sure to stir often, or it will get stuck to the bottom and burn a bit. I found the taste / combo of sausage and ground beef odd.

Very good, especially with some additions suggested from others plus my own: Less meat. Add green pepper, more garlic, dried basil, dried oregano, broth in place of water & Creole seasoning in place of garlic salt. My sausage was smoked sausage from So. LA.

Actually a really good recipe.  I was a little leary...not being very fond of cabbage.  But I found this recipe after searching for specific ingredients.  I had on-hand cabbage, sausage, rice, and stewed tomatoes and looked for a recipe that would utilize all of these.  Even after it was cooked, it didn't look wonderful since the purple from the cabbage seeped into the mixture.  But the flavor was very good.  I do like jambalaya, and the cabbage makes an interesting and healthier variation.j  Pleasantly surprised!  :D

Great recipe. Very hearty and surprisingly flavorful. I didn't add the sausage or ground beef because I didn't have any and needed to use my cabbage. It definitely would have been significantly better with at least one kind of meat (or fake meat for the vegetarians), so I would definitely make sure to add that. It was 4 stars without the meat, so I give it 5 because I know that's what it would be with the meat.

I adjusted the ingredients to make four servings.  Used homemade beef stock instead of water as some reviewers suggested.  This was delicious!! There were no leftovers.  Thanks, Susan for posting something different for us to try; which turned out to be a definite keeper.

Cabbage Jambalaya Haiku: "This was pretty great! Cut the recipe in half, it still made a ton!" I prepared my rice separated and mixed it in b4 serving, b/c rice is either too squishy or too crunch when I do it the way the recipe directed. Also drained the ground beef and sausage b4 mixing the other stuff in b/c Yikes! That was alot of grease and wouldn't have appealed to us at all. Threw in 1 tsp of AR's Creole Seasoning, and this was deliciscrumtastious.

I can't give it 5 stars because I made too many changes, but it is a good starter recipe.  Based on other reviews, I used only a 1/2 pound each of the ground beef and sausage (which I subbed with vegetarian versions).  I also added almost double the water it called for, and a half portion of the Cajun Spice Mix recipe from this site (by Bobbie Jean).  Those changes made my wife say that it was the BEST cabbage dish she had ever had.

Not my favorite thing I think it is a bit too oily/greasy. So if I was to make it again i would drain the fat or I would get a less fattier meat like ground turkey!

Great Recipe! I fixed it for a work pot luck and it was gone in no time!  Next time I will add black beans, more garlic and celery (just did not have at the time).

This recipe came up as I searched using ingredients I had to use up. It looked good, but I really think it needed more flavors for my tastes so I added a bunch of stuff. I added black-eyed peas, used beef broth instead of water. Added green pepper, oregano, thyme, bay leaves, red pepper flakes (then Tabasco at the end!). The rice I used was Bhutanesca red and the tomatoes where a can of fire-roasted. The cabbage was red. I'd give the recipe with my changes 4 stars. Interesting and novel recipe for me.

Awesome! So good! We loved it! Huge hit at our house. I did brown the ground beef seperately so I could drain it. And I cooked the rice in my rice cooker but everything else was the same.

Surprisingly good!  I used a can of diced tomatoes and about 2 cups tomato sauce instead of the stewed tomatoes and added 2.5 t. of creole seasoning.

On of my favorite recipes that I have found on this site. Delicious!  I made it to recipe with ground turkey/turkey sausage the first time, now I like to add 2 teaspoons of cajun seasoning to it and instead of celery I put in one green and one red bell pepper. I also like to use low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  It is a great recipe the way it's listed, I just changed things to cater more to a flavor I enjoy more.

Everyone in my family liked it and with 4 children, that is quite an accomplishment!  The only tweaking I did was to chop the stewed tomatoes with a hand blender, use chicken broth instead of water and sprinkle with a little Tony Cha(sp?) -- uhhh cajun seasoning. :-)

This was SO GOOD!!!  I gave it 4 stars because I did modify it but it's definitely going to be made again. Hubby LOVED it and asked that I keep the recipe and make it again. My modifications/additions: 3 cloves garlic, added 1 can Rotel tomatoes to the recipe, 1 can El Pato spicy tomato sauce (use 1/2 can for less spicy or regular tomato sauce instead), instead of water I used 1 can beef broth plus 1 cup of beef broth (cuz rice soaked broth up before it was done cooking so had to add more), 1/2 tsp. garlic salt, 1/4 tsp. Old Bay seasoning, pinch of red pepper flakes, dash of worcestershire sauce, and a dash of salt.  Loved by all in the family and that right there is worth the effort!

Great basic recipe. I forget to defrost some ground beef so I omitted it. Also left out the celery as Husband hates it. It was a tad bland so I added an onion bouillon cube and some crushed red pepper flakes. It turned out ok - nothing really to rave about, but it was hearty and filling on a chilly Colorado night. Thanks!

Great flavors.  I am giving this a 4 entirely for personal reasons.  I am not a huge ground beef eater and I felt there was too much beef in this dish.  It overpowered all of the other ingredients.  Personally I would cut the beef portion in half.

My kids (all 5) loved this dish!  But they don't like cabbage, go figure!  I added a small can of cream of chicken soup only because I thought it would help them like it, but next time I'll try it without it.

Tasty but needs seasoning. I left out the celery (don't like it/didn't have any) & ommitted the tomatoes (don't like) & added 2 red peppers, chopped & 3/4 C tomato sauce. Will make again but with lots of seasonings. Very easy recipe. Thanks.

I left out the celery and added a bell pepper. I added some diced ham and also used hot italian sausage instead of the ground beef and that gave it a nice kick. The water to rice ratio is off, so I added some more broth. This recipe does need a little tweaking, but overall it was pretty good.

I live in the heart of Cajun Country.  When I saw this recipe, I doubted it would come close to any true Cajun versions.   However, I decided to try it.  I followed the directions exactly.  I was not disappointed.  I was STUNNED!  I showed the finished product to my son.  However, we tried tried it.   We did not care for this.

Added a box of Zatarain's Jambalaya mix for the flavor and added a dash or two of worcetershire sauce to the ground beef as it was browning.

Also added a red and yellow bell pepper and chicken stock instead of water.  Seasoned with hot sauce and Creole seasoning at the end for some spice!

Everyone ate so much of this soup - it was hearty and warming and VERY TASTY.

Wow,
    Now THAT is good stuff...so unexpected!  I substituted ground turkey for beef and used chicken broth instead of water.  I browned the turkey along with the celery and onions and such and drained them, then pretty much followed the rest of the recipe. At the end I used Creole seasoning to bring to my taste.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made a healthier version of this by using ground chicken instead of meat, brown rice instead of white and omitting the sausage. We still found the combination of flavors really good. I jazzed it up with seasoned salt and Old Bay seasoning. Ten stars for ease.

I had my doubts, but this was really good.  We used Andouille sausage, and the spice of the meat made any extra spices completely unnecessary.  I was concerned when I added the cabbage, because it took up a LOT of room in the pot, but after a few minutes, it boiled down to a reasonable size.

The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is b/c my grandchildren liked it. It wasn't that it was "bad", I don't particularly like my cabbage so mushy. The directions don't say to ever stir it but I felt it needed it about 1/2 way through the cooking. I also added some "Tony's" cajun seasoning and I think that enhanced the flavor. I think I'll stick to my cabbage/smoked sausage recipe. This was a little too much work for the end result. Thanks.

Used this recipe with leftover cabbage (from corned beef and cabbage) sausage and meatballs from spaghetti meal yesterday, and a little chicken left over from a roast. OMG!!!! this was great with the rice, tomatoes, and other ingredients. Thanks for another quick easy delicious way to fix cabbage.

good base for tweaking.  i needed more liquid for the rice to cook, so added 2 cans v-8.  also added more garlic (i used roasted).  i also thought this needed more seasoning, so will play with that some.

Pretty good but this made WAAAAYYYY too much for one person and more than half of it went bad in my fridge. I used red cabbage and would probably use green or white next time as the purple color was a bit off-putting.

This is a wonderful recipe! For the most part I follow the recipe but instead of hot sauce I add crushed red pepper flakes. It has turned out perfect both times. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.

Wasn't great but was good.  I didn't have cabbage but instead I used celery.  It worked good!  The amount of the ingredients were just perfect!!! the rice was perfect done!!! Please don't add more water or more rice.  I don't think is necessary to use broth because the sausage and beef have a lot of flavor itself.

This was VERY good - I didn't give it 5 stars because I need to play around with the spices.  There's something (albeit small) missing as is.  I did use beef broth instead of water, and three different sausages - no ground beef.  Will for sure be making this again!!  Thanks for sharing.

I feel like I'm being generous giving this recipe three stars.  I would not recommend this recipe to others.  While it didn't taste _bad_, there was nothing appealing about this dish.  In the time it took the rice to cook, the cabbage got way overcooked.  It was bland -- a real disappointment.

Thought this was great with a few modifications.  I had the ground beef frozen so I had to add almost 2 lbs rather than what the recipe called for. Also added a couple of extra stalks of celery. Additionally I substituted 2 approx 15 oz cans of chicken broth and 1 can full of water.  Also, I added about 6 cloves of garlic minced, red ground pepper, black coarsely ground pepper, garlic salt, and 3 bay leaves which I removed prior to serving.  I substituted 1 can of Rotel and 1 can of diced stewed tomatoes (seasoned with basil, oregano and garlic).  While it may seem overly modified I found it delicious and flavorful as did my DH and picky kiddos.  Enjoy

This makes ALOT!  The 2 times I have made it, I only had smoked sausage and that was plenty.  Not sure if would do hamburger and sausage, we like it with just sausage.  A nice hearty, filling meal with hot breadsticks.

This recipe was very simple. I didn't use the garlic salt called for in the recipe, but next time I think I will. I think it would have given it more flavor. My husband loved it the way it was. My 9 year old didn't like it, but I don't know that many kids who like cooked cabbage anyway.  :-)

I'm trying to figure out how this got so many good reviews.  We did not like this at all.  I used a good Andouille (cajun smoked sausage) and x-tra lean gound beef and it was still way too greasy and was just bluck!!  Tried adding more spices, etc, but to no avail.  Sorry, but will not be making this one again.

Great recipe!  I served it New Year's Eve.  Even those who said they didn't like cabbage loved this dish.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and added more seasonings.  It was delicious.

Outstanding recipe.  I used extra lean ground chuck, Lite sausage, chili style stewed tomatoes and substitued chicked broth for water.  Family loved it!!
