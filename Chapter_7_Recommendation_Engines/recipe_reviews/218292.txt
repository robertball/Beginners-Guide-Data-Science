I made this punch for the pool this Fourth of July and it was a hit! I used raspberry lemonade instead of regular lemonade but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It came out good but was a bit tart for my taste and could of used some watering down or maybe even some carbonated lemon lime soda. My husband luckily loves all things tart and really enjoyed this recipe. I will probably make this again but with a few minor alterations next time. Very yummy drink though, would be great served shaken as a martini too!
