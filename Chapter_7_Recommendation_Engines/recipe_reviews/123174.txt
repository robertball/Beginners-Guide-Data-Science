A tip for anyone who does not cook with ground turkey very often- always season it well while it is browning so that it absorbs more of the flavors of the spices.  I added the chili powder and garlic salt along with the turkey and veggies.  Rather than using white vinegar and adding sugar, I used balsamic vinegar in place of the white and omitted the sugar completely (balsamic vinegar is already sweet). I also added 1 t. of Italian seasoning, and at the end of cooking time, I felt like something was still missing from this recipe, so I added an entire can of dark red kidney beans, and it was perfect!  Very yummy!  The hubby and kids loved it!  With these changes, it was a 5 star family meal!

Even my husband, who is not a big fan of ground Turkey, loved this recipe! I did make a few alterations. I used olive oil seasoned with italian herbs to cook the turkey in, instead of veg oil. I used basil oregano seasoned diced tomatoes instead of plain stewed tomatoes. I used veggie macaroni noodles because that is what I had on hand. I left out the celery and green pepper. I cooked my pasta seperately without using the chicken broth. I added the cooked pasta to the turkey mixtured and simmered. It was very yummy! A definate keeper in my house! My husband said,"You have to make this again!" Thanks for the recipe!

This is similar to a recipe my mom used to make, she called it "sea shells' and made it with jarred sauce, ground beef and pasta shells.  It has been my go to recipe for years.  This is way better!!  All of the kids and the picky husband asked for seconds.  Don't omit the step with the chicken broth, it adds so much flavor to the dish.  Thank you!

Skipped the celery and cooked more pasta in about 3 cups of chicken stock.  Used the mexican version of stewed tomatoes and amped up the spices with paprika, cumin, oregano and a bit more chili powder (and S&P, too).  As I do with most dishes like this, I finished it off with 2 tbsp of butter and about 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream.  Lastly, tossed in some cheddar and monterrey jack cheese.  Had a great flavor, was filling and my kids ate it with no complaints.  Will definitely be making this again.  Bon appetit!

A very simple, healthy tasty dish! I took someone's advice and added the spices early... also added half a small can of tomato paste for thickening. A recipe I will use again and again.

I made exactly as the recipe stated and it was so bland.  I added whatever seasonings I could to amp the taste and I couldn't even save it until I added a 1/2 jar of marinara sauce.

Pretty darn good - I did change a few things due to ingredients on hand. I used chicken breast instead of ground turkey, and a small can of crushed tomatoes rather then the stewed. I didn't have any onions on hand so I just used a generous sprinkling of minced onions. Also left out the celery (not a fan) and added a yellow pepper to the mix as well. I didn't add about 8 oz more chicken broth then it called for and I'm glad I did. Next time I will NOT add the veggies until later as I think having a bit of cruch from them would add a lot to the dish. Great flavor and pretty healthy too since I used whole wheat pasta.

This is a BRILLIANT recipe! So unique and nothing like you think it will taste. Slightly sweet with a hint of chili - just a hint. Perfect. Thank you!!

This was a good, easy week night meal.    Hubby added hot pepper flakes to his to spice it up a bit.

Well, I forgot to buy stewed tomatoes, and the only thing I had in the house that was tomato-based was a can of Manwich... so I went for it.  It turned out good!  I actually doubled the recipe, choosing to cook the pasta separately and omitting the chicken broth.  Good recipe.

I made this tonight and it is good.  My fiance liked it and he can be a picky eater sometimes with new recipes.  I used diced tomatoes since I didn't have any stewed ones.  I made the pasta separate from the turkey mix and I didn't know what to do with the water, since I didn't use the chicken broth either.  I would probably drain some of it off before mixing in the other ingredients next time.  Also, we like our food with herbs and spices so I will probably add some to the turkey while browning it next time.  But it did turn out good.

Excellent dish! I skipped the celery and added some celery seed and a little basil and cumin, along with the chili and garlic salt - all while browning the meet to give it some flavor.  RE: vinegar/sugar...I tried it once as written and once with the balsalmic vinegar, they were both really good but I have a slight preference for the balsalmic, it just adds a really nice sweetness that's a little different than the sugar.  Mine was a little watery both times but it may be because I doubled the recipe and with the 28 oz can of tomatoes, maybe therer was more juice? Anyway, my kids loved it so much they dipped their bread in at the end!

This is a great and easy recipe!  I did make some changes to satisfy my preferences.  I used olive oil to cook my groud turkey and seasoned it well.  I also used a few cloves of garlic and lots of oregano for additional flavor.  Since I don't like green peppers, I used a yellow one.  At the end, I sprinkled it with shredded mozarella and parmesan cheese.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

tastes great even if you don't have all the veggies on hand. I just used onion and garlic. Reminds me of old-fashioned "beefaroni" only leaner.

This was very good. Ofcoarse I am horrible at following the regular recipes though. Everyone that I have followed have been bland and so I go with the flow of my own personal experiences with spices, which isn't to much,haha. This was very different in the wasy that i usually make this. I never put in the sugar, vinegar, garlic befroe and I made a world of difference. If youlike your food with a bit more of a kick, ad more chili pepper.  Adding mrs. dash is good too.

My family liked this recipe.  I didn't have any celery or green peppers so I substituted yellow peppers.  Next time I will buy the celery as the green would help the visual appeal of the dish.

I added chopped carrots, zucchini, mushrooms and spinach.  Used whole wheat pasta and fresh mozzarella instead of parmesan.    Instead of bell peppers (I'm allergic," i used some red pepper flakes to spice it up a lil bit.  Delicious!

Um... this recipe is the exact same one submitted by Taste of Home, how can you say you created it?  Every word of the recipe is the same.  I wonder how that got past TPTB.  It even has the same name!

I misread the recipe, and made it with leftover turkey from my Thanksgiving dinner. It was actually pretty good, although next time, I would add a few more spices. I can't wait to try this recipe with ground turkey, as it was intended!

This is a great recipe that I have made often.  Always add more veggies like shredded carrots, sliced mushrooms, and chopped zucchini or summer squash and more garlic.  Easy and satisfying!
