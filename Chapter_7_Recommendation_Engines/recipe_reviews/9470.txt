This was great. I followed the recipe with the following exceptions. I used one 17 oz bag of Reeces Pieces instead of the m&m's and I used 30 oz of premium white chocolate chips melted in the microwave for the white chocolate. For those who said this was too sweet, it's important NOT to use almond bark or "white chips" which both are sugary and are not actually white chocolate at all. I also rolled out some parchement paper on the counter top to spread the mixture on. It would not have fit on a cookie sheet. After the mixture dried, about 30 minutes, I broke it up a bit and stored in container. I'll be making this one again!

I got this recipe from the Indianapolis Junior League Cookbook 15 years ago and have made it every Christmas and Easter since. At the holidays I make a tin for everyone in my husband's office, and they start asking him for it at Thanksgiving!  It is a nice gift for postman, school bus drivers, trash man etc. I sent this to both of my nephews in Iraq and it was the most requested item from both of them. I also send it with my son for his away golf matches on the bus. My original recipe called for 1-1.5 lbs of almond bark, not 2! I also use Crispix instead of Chex and use 1/2 cashews and 1/2 pecan halves. Either way it is great.

Talk about addictive!  I took this to work which was my first mistake--Now I am asked to make this all the time as everyone gobbles it up.  I use Crispex instead of Rice Chex,use 2 bags of Wilton TM white chocolate wafers, throw everything in a big roasting pan, melt the chocolate in the microwave, stir it all up really well, and turn it out on waxed paper to cool. Easy. Very easy! I believe whoever took Ruth's recipe and put it on this site copied it incorrectly.  Step 2 is just a repeat of Step 1 and is a bit confusing to the reader. Try this you will really like it.

I made this twice - the first time using the recommended amount of white chocolate and I thought it was too sweet.  The second time I halved the amount (I used white chocolate bark) and it was MUCH better.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!  I've made it several times and just use Crispix instead of the 2 cereals.  I have tried this with real white chocolate and also the white chocolate almond bark.  I highly recommend using the real white chocolate.  I did not care for the almond bark version at all.

Updated:  I made this again and my proportions turned out perfectly.  I used 3 bags of white chocolate chips (Walmart brand), one full box of Crispix (12 oz), one full bag of M&Ms (14 oz) and 3 cups of pretzels.  I microwaved the chocolate for 1 minute, 10 seconds and it was perfectly melted.

For Easter gifts, I mixed Fruity Pebble, Pastel marshmallows and pretzels.  Poured melted white choc and chunky peanut butter over....beautiful!  They looked like little Easter baskets with pastel eggs inside.

I've made this for years but only with one pound of white chocolate instead of two, also with peanuts instead of cashews but they do sound worth a try.  Also, use regular size candy only about half as much and get those colored according to the current holiday to make more feastive for the season.

This stuff is addictive!  I made this for a group and got loads of compliments. I used almond bark in place of the white chocolate (that my local store was out of).

When I make this, I use chow mein noodles instead of oat cereal, peanuts instead of cashews and peanut butter M&M's instead of regular. I know this as "White Trash". Seriously one of the best snack mixes I know. I double it AT LEAST and handwrite copies of the recipe for guests because I always get requests for the recipe. NOTE: This can also cool on tin foil. I don't keep wax paper on hand ever, I use tin foil instead.

Love this recipe--I break off pieces of a chewy (non chocolate) penut bar such as (payday) and mix it in.  It is even more addictive.

I call this my "clean out the pantry" Christmas Mix.  I've used all kind of cereals from Cookie Crisp to Lucky Charms, any nuts I may have on hand (the more variety the better), as well as pretzels (any shape size).  Each time I make it, it's a bit different but the reviews are all the same...FANTASTIC!!  It's devoured instantly.

This is a warning!  This stuff is very addicting.  Be sure to have someone to help you eat it, or you will likely eat the whole thing.  I loved it!  I was out of oat cereal, so I omitted it.  I also used salted peanuts instead of cashews.  But either way, I am sure you can't go wrong.  The white chocolate is great with the salty flavors.  Can't wait to make it again.

I'm not sure if this recipe could even be classified as "GORP" since it doesn't have granola, oats, raisins or peanuts.
I think I would just call it "White Chocolate Snack Mix" or how about "this
stuff is really tasty and super easy!"
This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

I'm rating this a five star - not for myself - but for my teenagers.  My son took a large baggy to high school and made many new friends - lol.  It's on my list as a repeater.

Outstanding and very easy - but beware, this is VERY sweet.  I made some modifications to bring it down a notch.  I used 18 oz of chocolate instead of the 2 lbs, and still probably came close to doubling the cereal.  I added the pretzels after I had mixed the chocolate with the cereal to preserve the salty/sweet mix.  And lastly, I skipped the candy coated pieces and added sweetened dried cranberries instead.  Other ingredients would work well in here, but don't skip the oat squares - the sweet cinnamon flavor and crunchy texture are what makes this mix stand out!

My kids and I preferred the ingredients mixed without the white chocolate.  It was too sweet and clumped with the chocolate.

My 3 year old daughter loved this recipe.  It's also very easy to make which is a big plus when you're in a hurry for something sweet.  I'll probably make this again and experiment with different combinations of ingredients.

We call this "White Trash" and everyone loves it! I think it is important to make sure you use salted nuts to cut down on the sweetness as other suggested. I used a mixture of plain Cheerios and Chex cereals, salted peanuts and pretzels, ommiting the candy you really don't need that sweetness on top of the white chocolate. This is great to give as gifts and to have out for munching at parties. A keeper!

Had put off making this as it sounded a bit time consuming, but just tried it and it's super quick and easy.  Only made 1/2 the quantity and used small chocolate-coated honeycomb nuggets instead of the mini-candy coated chocolate pieces - a bit of a mistake as the chocolate on the outside melted into the white chocolate when I mixed it in.  However it still tasted great!  Also left out the toasted oat cereal and don't think I would have had enough chocolate to coat everything if I'd used it.  My husband and guests absolutely loved this, will definitely be making it regularly.

I have made this recipe twice...first as written, then again using granola, oat cereal, raisins, candy-coated chocolate pieces, peanuts and some pretzel squares, along with the melted white chocolate.  First batch was for coworkers to snack, second was for some friends who backpack in the High Sierras.  Both batches were received and consumed to rave reviews!  Will definitely make this again...I sense a new tradition has been created! =)

This was good.  I used white candy coating instead of white chocolate.  I think this was a mistake.  Still overall, good.  My 2 year old nephew couldn't get enough of it.

AMAZING! ADDICTING! WONDERFUL! Need I go on? I definitely had the stomach ache to prove how great this recipe is. I did play with the recipe a bit, and these are the measurements that I recommend: 7 cups chex (I used Crispix), 4 cups cheerios, 4 cups pretzels, 4 cups cashews (I also used dry roasted peanuts). I also think next time I will not use M&M's, but instead use Reese Pieces (the M&M's were just too much chocolate). If you want to be popular, definitely make this recipe :-)

DELISH!!! Very addicting! I did use the white choco premier chips from Nestle, I melted in a double boiler and added 3 tablespoons of Crisco shortening per 2 bags of chips, worked great had no clumping as was a problem in others reviews! Enjoy!!!!!

White Chocolate Gorp is the best!!! An awesome snack food. I followed the recipe to a "T", using Reese's Pieces for the chocolate candies. Everyone raved about this. I will be making this again. Thanks! Update: I made this for a second time using plain M&M's instead of Reese's Pieces. I have to say, the Reese's definitely send this one over the top! Although I think this recipe would be great no matter what the substitution.

I love this recipe and so does everyone I make it for.  I found this a couple of years ago and have used it ever since, many around Christmas.  This is a favorite!

Yes! Ruth, thank you for sharing this recipe. I made this all the time when I was a teenager/young adult but had lost the recipe. This is a great treat that teenagers love! This is especially great at Christmastime!

YUM!  I put this in Christmas baggies & handed them out to my nieces & nephews after dinner.  They all loved it!  I subbed raisins for the toasted oats cereal, & used red & green regular M&M's.  Turned out great, Thanks Ruth, the kids dig when I give them stuff like this.

This is a crowd-pleasing, addictive mix!  It's the perfect blend of sweet and salty!  I'll definitely be making it again during the holidays next year.  I, too, used Crispex instead of Chex as it tends to be a little crunchier.  And, I was sure to use real white chocolate and not "white chips" or almond bark.

Love this recipe.  Used white chocolate chips from Hershey and it turned out great.  Definitely sweet but addictive.  I love that you can add anything you have on hand.  I mixed in some honey nut Cheerios and left out the Chex this time.  Have used a can of mixed nuts as well as honey roasted peanuts.  The saltiness of the pretzels with the sweetness of the coating is my favorite.

This is GREAT and so easy to make!  I used peanuts instead of cashews (I only used half the recommended amount because I didn't buy a big enough jar).  The most challenging part was finding a big enough bowl to hold it all.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again.  I made seven batches so I'd have enough for my co-workers and it was so easy!  The biggest challenge is not eating it all.  :)

Great recipe to make and give as gifts.  I left out the nuts, used rice chex, toasted oatmeal square cereal, pretzel stix & christmas m&m's.  I've made this several years and it's always a big hit!

This was a huge hit with the husband and those we distributed gift bags to. I thought it was too sweet with the M&M's so next time I would leave them out. I couldn't find the mini ones. I used dry roasted peanuts and cashew pieces in this, but I preferred the peanuts so I would leave the cashews out next time. I preferred the chex cereal to the cheerio pieces so I would swap the Cheerios out with maybe wheat chex next time. I do think a mini round or shaped pretzel would work better than the sticks though. DH devoured this like it was going out of style.

This is a great recipe, I do not rate a recipe based on changes I make. So the five stars are for this recipe as is. But I think this recipe is best wtih a bit of pepermint extract added. I make it at christmas time add the mint, holiday colored candies and call it "Santa snacks" we put it out for Santa with his cookies. I also use this as a afordable gift for Teachers etc.

WOW!  So good!  I only made one mistake which was not mixing the dry ingredients together...because the mini M&M's were on top when I poured the white chocolate on, they kind of melted in...still, too addictive!  Hope it makes it to the Super Bowl Party tomorrow!!

This was a wonderful "thought" gift to give during the holiday season.  I made two batches and found that using melted large baking chips, rather than a baking chocolate bar worked better (used only 1 lb, which was more than enuff).  It formed a firmer finished product which I enjoyed.  I also substituted regular M&M's for these wonderful Mint M&M's I happened upon while shopping.  The mint flavor blended beautifully throughout the mix.  I will be making this for years to come!!!

Great recipe and easy to make.  I added peanuts and cashews because I had them both on hand.  I also used regular size M&Ms.  For the pretzels I used Snyders Snaps.  For the chocolate I used white almond bark and white chocolate (16oz each) .  While the chocolate was melting I mixed the cereals, nuts, pretzels, and M&Ms.  I didn't have a roasting pan on hand so I mixed it in a big stock pot.  Once combined I poured it out on wax paper.  It set up very quickly.  It's very sweet!     Great recipe.

This recipe is so easy.  I used 5 cups of rice chex cereal instead of 6 and increased the chocolate to 2 1/2 lbs.  I also added extra m & m's.  I turned out perfect.  My whole family fell in love with this and it was something that was easy for my kids to help me make.

Yum yum yum! This is so great! I think I will follow other reviewers advice next time and leave the pretzels uncoated for more of the salty/sweet flavor. Very easy and highly addictive.

I have been looking for this recipe for a while and it's delicious!  My 5 year old help put it together and it was simple.  This is GREAT for snaking.  The hardest part is waiting for it to cool :)  We make it when friends come over for "game night" or when we play cards.  The first couple of times I made it I used less white chocolate until I realized I wasn't adding the right amount, but it still came out GREAT!  It's also GREAT for the "once a month" sweet tooth.  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing how this stuff disappears.  I package it up with christmas sprinkles & M& M's and give it away for neighbor/teacher etc. gifts.  2 bags of nestle chips in my microwave is 3 mins medium , stir, then 2 mins. medium , stir.

I have been making this for years.  Ever since a friend gave some to us one Christmas as a gift.  Normally I make about 5 batches every Christmas.  I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out great every time.  Makes a wonderful teacher gift in a pretty tin or glass jar.  Make sure you attach the recipe because you will be asked for it.

Very simple, very good. I used 10 cups assorted cereal, 3 cups assorted nuts, and a large bag of candies (some M&Ms, some Kissables). The only major departures here were that I had a math fail and only bought 18 oz. of white chocolate (thinking, somehow, that I had 2 oz. too much!) so that's all I used, and it was great. More would probably not have been better, for me personally. After tasting the mixture (ok, licking my fingers) I decided that Craisins would be a good add-in and promptly sprinkled a cup of Craisins over the whole thing. This made 2 jelly roll pans worth of goodies which I stuffed into 1 gallon + 2 quart bags. (In case anyone else considered, as I did, that the yield of 4 pounds was not terribly helpful in terms of how much "stuff" this makes for gifts.)

I, too, made the mistake of using Nestle Premeire White Morsels and it never melted, just globbed up and was a mess.  So I used melted milk chocolate chips and it tasted great!  I used Honey Grahams and Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch for the cereal and it was awesome!

i thought this was really good just super sweet. I added 2 cups pecan halves along with 2 cups of dry roasted peanuts instead of cashews.  I also used 2lbs almond bark not white chocolate (dont know if the sweetness is less if using real white choc.)  next time i will try with real choc. but overall a great treat to make with the kids.  thank yu for sharing!

Incredibly addictive!  I made this as a gift for a coworker's birthday.  I made it exactly as recipe describes & put it into a cleaned vintage pot lined with plastic wrap.  I piled the mix high into the pot and topped with a beautiful bow.  She L-O-V-E-D it, and the mix looked really pretty served this way.  It made so much there was some left over for the family -- thankfully, since they were fighting each other for what was left!

This made great neighborhood gifts for the holidays! I did go with the white Chocolate bark. I could not get the white choc chips to melt - they just got chunky. The bark melted beautifully! I was only able to find the white bark. Hope this helps!

Delicious- it clumps together when hardening so make sure to have it layed out flat beforehand.  Also, more pretzels next time to add to the salty-sweet combo!

I just love this stuff!  I first made it right before christmas and gave it out to friends, they all hate me now, because they've gained weight eating so much of it.  Honestly it is really good! I put trailmix in mine with some reeses pieces. Yummy!  I think I'll go gain another few pounds....

This is such a great and easy recipe, especially for the holidays! I used Chex, Cheerio's, and peanut butter M&M's. This is so wonderful for giving to co-workers and friends as a Christmas gift. I brought cheap tins, put tissue paper in them and gorp. It was a hit! Will definitely make it again and again. Thanks!

WOW!! This is my new favorite!!! 
I was looking for something new to make and I found it.  This was so simple and way too good.  I think I will have to make another batch. The only change I made was that  I used peanut m&m's (x-mas colors) and white almond bark.

This is my ultimate "I can't stop eating it" snack. I have experimented with different cereals and additions:  lucky charms is wonderful to use (believe it or not).  It adds color and makes it more "candy" like.  I also add different kinds of nuts, m&ms, and I even mix reese's pieces into it!  Anything goes!

My intentions were to make this exactly as written, as I have for a few years, but discovered I did not have the full 2# of white bark, which turned out fine. I substituted half of the chex mix for new chocolate chex (yum!). Tossed in some mini-marshmallows after realizing "someone" ate all the m&m's I thought I had hidden. Although the original is the best, when in a pinch...made it work!

I have made this recipe many times because it is so popular with the kids in my church. It doesn't matter what combination of cereals and snacks I mix together - it is always yummy and devoured. I do typically make it at Christmas time with Christmas minty M&M's and cashews, pretzels, Chex cereal and Cheerios.

This recipe is awesome and flexible.  This year I made the mistake of trying to use nestle's premier white chocolate that I accidentally bought  out of code date.  It just melted into a big unusable blob of white chocolate.  I had to go out and buy blocks of white chocolate.  Watch out for expiration dates.

I have made this recipe several times, and have found that using 1.5 lbs of the almond bark is a better ratio.  If you use the whole 2 lbs the goodies get lost in a mess of super sweet coating.  I usually make a big batch around the holidays and include it in my cookie tins.  The recipe of flexible, so I add whatever I have on hand.  I always get rave reviews.

I'm not a huge fan of this (not a white chocolate lover), but I found it strangely addicting!  Others also couldn't stop eating it.  I did (approx) equal parts rice chex, cheerios, pretzels, cashews, peanuts, and regular and peanut m&ms.  I also added about a tsp of peanut oil to the melted chocolate.  Even 1/2 the recipe made a ton!

I made this for my daughter and sons teachers at their Preschool and it was a hugh hit! I wouldn't reccomend melting the chocolate chips in the microvave- it is to easy to over melt and I had to throw a whole batch out! Also 3 bags of white chocolate chips was plenty for my batch.

I love this stuff!  One of my patient's wife would make this for us on occasion and it's quick and easy and so good.  I basically threw in different types of cereals I had in the house, with some pretzel sticks and cashews.  It made a ton so I gave some to my friend and will send some with the kids to school.

I brought this to a children's party and the kids loved it. It is colorful and looks "fun" on the table. It was also very easy to make and I even threw in leftover baking ingredients from my freezer. This recipe is also great for Holidays and easy to throw in "appropriate" holiday colored candy.

Made it with Crispix instead of Chex, omitted the chocolate candy and opted for craisins instead.  I used the stick pretzels, but it made it difficult to eat, especially since everything sticks together like glue.  Next time I will use pretzel knots, and be sure to double the amount of these.  It makes for a delicious salty-to-sweet ratio.  Took it to work and the whole batch was gone by noon!

YUM!!! After reading reviews & other recipes, I used Crispix, Cheerios, holiday pretzels,& a can of cashew/macadamia nut mix. Melted 2 T. margarine in a lg skillet & then added 2 bags (12 oz ea) of white chocolate chips & melted over low heat. Stirred into mix & lastly added a bag of coated mini Hershey kisses. Be sure to use a HUGE bowl & lay out plenty of wax paper. (I used the hint to tape it down.) This is so easy & good. Makes a ton & a great idea for holiday food gifts.

We love this recipe.  It's a staple at our Christmas gatherings and we call it "Reindeer Chow"

I also use less white chocolate that called for here.

Delicious!!!!  Would give more stars if I could.  I had to give it away to stop myself from eating it all by gone.  All my favorite tastes in one bite.  Salty,sweet,chocolate, all in one recipe.  I think next time I might try adding some kind of dried fruit.  I saw another recipe somewhere else that added cranberries.

I love this stuff! I added a little cinnamon and brought it with me to an out of town family Christmas thing and everyone loved it. It made enough to send everyone leftovers. Thank you so much for this recipe. Will definitely make again next year!!!

I thought this was very good and when I took it to a women's group meeting I came home with any empty bowl and had many requests for the recipe.  Next time I would cut it in half though as it makes tons!

Only I could manage to buy UNSALTED peanuts! So I sprinkled some table salt throughout the mix before the chocolate and made sure to dump the salt at the bottom of the pretzel bag in, too. Good stuff!Ummmm...be sure to turn it out on wax paper or coat your "mixing" pan with nonstick spray.  I'm soaking my mixing pan in hot water right now! LOL

My husband and I laugh at the name "gorp".  We decided to call it White Chocolate Christmas Mix.  We love it.  Very tasty stuff.  I actually put these in with my Christmas cookie packages this year.  Everyone enjoyed.  My brother and sister in law already called for the recipe.

It turned out perfect using 1 pound white almond bark. It's fun adding a variety of different flavored M&Ms! It's addicting!

I use Quispix cereal and the grandkids like Reese's Peanut Butter & Chocolate cereal.  You can always put your own spin on according to what you, family & friends like.  I like mixed nuts,  tiny pretzel twists & thin sticks, red & green M & M's, with & without nuts, whatever, it's all good. Just make sure you melt enough white chocolate to cover ingredients without it pooling on the wax paper. I use two forks to separate it all. We only make it at Christmas so we changed the name to Reindeer Chow.

I followed suggestions and halved the white chocolate, and my family (sugar-lovers, all) still complained that it was too sweet!  Perhaps this just isn't the right thing for us to choose for snacks!  Right now I have more than half the recipe sitting in the fridge because no one is eating it.  :(

This has become a family favorite! I make it every time we go camping and we munch on it the whole trip. I usually use almond bark instead of the white chocolate because its a lot cheaper.

Excellent and very popular snack. It feeds a LOT of people and is very rich. For a class of 30, they ate the whole bowl with about 4 cups still left at the bottom. Quickly polished off by office staff.

My whole family gobbled this up. One said it was the best thing I've ever made! It makes a lot. For my personal taste, I would add more nuts and fewer M&M's but still it was very yummy! I used white chocolate chips. I thought it was kind of expensive to make.

This was delicious! I made a half batch for my sister's class Christmas party and they ate the whole bag. She also mentioned receiving a lot of raves from her classmates. I used frosted cheerios and omitted the nuts, and used red candy coating I happened to have with green sprinkles. I also might use less candy coating next time like some suggested. Thanks for the great recipe!

Love this stuff! It's addictive!! I made last year for Christmas. I used holiday mint m&ms and mixed it up in a roasting pan. Last night made my first batch for this season. I put together by memory and realized after it was mixed, I only used half the amount of white chocolate called for in the recipe. I actually liked it better that way. Perfect blend of sweet and salty. I also used dark chocolate and mint chocolate m&ms.

I made this for Treat Day and I give it 5 stars for being as good as the other reviewers said.  For an older crowd I would modify it by lessening the white chocolate a few ounces and substituting Craisins for the candy pieces.  I found it more attractive when I spread the mix out on wax paper and then drizzled the melted chocolate on top.  Wait until it cools and break it up gently.

Too easy to be this good!! I made the first batch of this yummy goodness and sent most of it to work with my hubby.  Two days later the girls at his office were calling wanting more! My family and friends loved this.  It really is easy and hit the spot!! Thanks so much!

What a great simple recipe. Just a few minor modifications - I melted the white chocolate chips in the microwave and added raisins to the recipe.  Delicious.

use unsalted nuts, or it's really too salty. the pretzles and the salt inherent in white chocolate are enough. i had a friend complain that "gorp" stands for "good ole raisins and peanuts" and this recipe has neither, but frankly i wouldn't have cared for raisins and i like cashews much more than peanuts. be sure you have a really big pan to mix everything together. i took this to my last day of class and everyone nibbled a little on it -- my husband took the rest to his class and those men ate the rest. so no "requests for the recipe," and although it was good, it wasn't really something i think i'll take the time to make again.

This was great! I had doubts, but it was gobbled up at our holiday party last year and people asked me about it in the weeks afterwards! I'll definitely be repeating it this year.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  I used cereal, waffle-cut pretzels, half cashews, half salted peanuts, and part white chocolate chips, part almond bark.  Ridiculously easy and so deliciously munchable!

I have made this three times this month for seperate get togethers.  Each time it is gone in a hurry.   I have found that adults love it as much as kids!  I have used rice chex, honey nut cheerios, pretzel sticks, marshmallows, mini m&m's, and half a bag of heath toffee pieces.  I used one package of white almond bark and it was perfect for all this.  I don't add any nuts due to my daughter's nut allergy.  So easy!

With little supervision - this is one for the little ones to make or just help out with.  There's not much mess scoopin' out the cereals and tossing them in a bowl.  I used reg. mini pretzels, almond M&M's, salted peanuts.  Very good!!!  And pretty addicting too ;O)

Wonderful!!  This stuff is so delicious and easy to make.  I used 2lbs of almond bark and I am glad that I used the full 2lbs.  There was plenty of chocolate to cover every piece.  I also threw in dried cranberries and I used almonds instead of the cashews and I left out the m&m's.

I used these in my Christmas baked good baskets that I made.   This mix is so easy and fun to make and you can always change it up from time to time.    The only suggestion that I would not use again are marshmallows.

This stuff is great.  I only used 1 1/2 lb of white chocolate and that seemd to be plenty.  I also used half m&m's and half reeces pieces (12 oz total).  You can't loose with this recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe! I make it every year for co-workers, teachers and family! 

TIP: Try adding miniature marshmallows to the mix! YUMMY!

Oh and we leave out the M&M's..I personally dont think it needs it!

Great recipe!!!  I made this at Christmas last year and it was a hit.  I substituted the oats with cherrios.  This recipe is a good one that anyone can try and change to your own tastes.  It is soooo easy and let's not forget about tasting great.

this was good, not great.  The kids liked it at the party, but the adults didn't eat much.  I used Crispx and those were really good, cherios--not so much.  I added the m&m's but thought it was too much.  maybe the mini's would be better.  Probably won't make again.

Very easy and delicious. I used a lb. of white choc chips and a lb. of peanut butter chips and it was even better.  Be sure and use salted peanuts and pretzels to cut the sweet just a little.

I am rating this a 3 because I changed the recipe.  As written, I would not even eat this because of the amount of white chocolate called for.  I am not a huge sweet eater, and that seems like WAY too much white chocolate.  Many other reviewers who tried it as written seem to agree.  

So I cut down the white chocolate to 2 cups of Ghiradelli white chocolate melting wafers (that is the measured amount of chocolate in a 10 oz. bag of wafers).  I also added the pretzels and candies AFTER the cereal was mixed in with the white chocolate (didn't have any nuts).  The picture on this recipe appears to have followed this method, although the recipe says to coat everything together.

To me this amount of chocolate still allows you to enjoy the candies.  Otherwise it would be sickeningly sweet.  

Also, it would have helped me to have an idea how many cups of cereal are in a 12 oz. (regular size) box of cereal.  I bought way too much!  There are about 12 cups in a 12 oz box of Rice Chex, and about 9 cups in a 12 oz. box of Cheerios.

So yummy!  I drizzled a little semi sweet chocolate over the white to give it more color and flavor -  so yummy!  I melted nestle white chocolate chips for the white choc.  Then, I  used little mini pretzels, honey roasted almonds, cashews and lightly salted almonds. I just sprinkled a good handful of each.

Loved this.  Used honey roasted peanuts (what I had). I only used one pound of white chocolate, but added about a half pound of white morsels.  I loved the sweet salty crunch.

This is ok.  My kids really like it.  I'm more of a true chocolate fan, but the kids enjoy white chocolate once in a while.  It does make a good gift giving idea and turns out very pretty.

All I have to say is don’t use Nestle premier white morsels.  It wouldn’t really melt and the whole thing just didn’t turn out right.  I don’t think I’ll be taking the time to try and make it with a better white chocolate, maybe milk chocolate if I ever feel like trying it again.

I also used almond bark & it was very sweet!  I only used 1 lb. 8 oz. of it & had plenty.  Next time I will hunt dow real white chocolate.  I subbed the cherrios for Cocoa Krispies and almonds for cashews. Next time I will add raisins!

So quick and easy. Just use what you have in the cabinets. I used 1/2 a box of Crispix cereal, 1/2 a box of cheerios, 1/2 a bag of pretzel sticks, a small can of peanuts, and a bag of plain M&M's. I melted 1 1/2 lbs. of Almond Bark and mixed in a large roster pan. Spread out on parchment paper to cool and enjoy. I threw this together last night for treats at church the today and had rave reviews from all ages!!! On the way out the door, I was asked to make up another batch for the church bake sale on Friday & Saturday. Taking treats to church and school just got incredibly easy. Thanks!!!

Good recipe - I'd change a couple of things.  I reduced chocolate to 1lb.  (I used Almond Bark & didn't find it too sweet. I used: 5c Crispix, 4c Pretzels & a handful+ more of Cheerios.  I didn't add any pre-sweetened cerials.  Next time I will add less of the Crispix and more pretzel. (The sweet/salty is good)  My kids and niece ate almost 1/2 of it before I could put it in a container!!  I think if I used 2lbs of chocolate, it would definately have been too sweet.

A very good snack! Those who've had it before - will love it again, and those who haven't - will think they're in heaven. All the newbies who eat this, ask for the recipe. Great during the holidays or anytime you want a salty/sweet snack.

Made it with real white chocolate the first time and it was excellent.  Made it with white confectioner's coating the second time (because the store was out of white chocolate), but only used 1 pound,  and it was equally good.

Super easy and really good. Made for Christmas treats baskets and this was everyones favorite, even those who "don't like white chocolate".  Couldn't find mini M&Ms anywhere, or plain holiday colored ones for that matter and ended up putting dark chocolate M&Ms which were really good in there. The Cheerios and pretzels added just the right amount of saltiness. Instead of cashews I put mixed nuts just cause I had a ton on hand. I could eat this all day long, so I'm glad I gave most of it away!

Wonderful stuff! I can't believe how many compliments I received over such an easy recipe! I've made it with honey nut Cheerios too and it was even better. I shipped some to my bro-in-law in Iraq and he said it kept well and was his favorite thing that I shipped him. It makes a bunch so it's easy to split up into small treat bags or boxes and give out to everyone.

This for us was just so so, and after spending in upwords of $15 to make it, I probably won't attempt it again. As it is I am going to give most of this away. I did use the suggestion of wal mart white choc chips, so in all fairness I may try it again using almond bark.

I made this for a journalism youth group, and it went over well for them. It was too sweet for me. Next time I would take out the M&M's and add more nuts and/or pretzels.

Can you say addicting and so versatile! You can truly add anything into this, peanuts, pretzels are great, plain cereal...all fantastic. I also think that adding peanut butter/chocolate candies add a great touch. This stuff is hard to get people to eat based on the lack of presentation, but once they start the honestly do not stop until every last morsel is gone!

I liked the salty items covered in chocolate better than the rest, so if you feel the same way, my advice would be to add way more preztels and cashews and cut back on the rest. I would consider this more of a candy treat rather than a snack or trail mix, but if you like salty and sweet, this will certainly fit the bill!

This is one of the easiest treats to make but one of the yummiest!  I usually make this during the holidays...I'm used to calling it, "white trash" but no matter what you call it...it goes a long way, everyone loves it and it's very addicting!  The thing I like is you can add whatever ingredients you want-make it your own!

BEWARE  - THIS WILL SHRINK YOUR CLOTHES - ADDICTIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh my gosh - this stuff is absolutely the best.  I followed the recipe loosely, used mixed nuts rather than cashews - it was great.  Would also be great with only cashews or peanuts.

Terrific!  Sweet and salty.  Very addictive.  We used Crispix, cashews, pretzels, and mini Reese's Pieces with the white chocolate from a bag.  We made it three times in the first week.  My kid's loved to help.

This was good but didn't go over as well as I had hoped.

As per other reviews, I used 7c.crispix, 4 c.cheerios, 4 c.pretzel twists and 4 c.nuts (a mountain mix of almonds, peanuts, raisins and smarties), with 2 full lbs. of choc.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave at 1/2 power, stirring every minute.  After mixing it all and turning it onto wax paper, I sprinkled it with red and green mini M&M's.  It turned out awesome, and will make great gifts for neighbors and teachers in fancy clear bags with Christmas tags.

AMAZING! It was so easy to put together and made a BIG bowl. I added extra chex and peanuts, as well as some red and green sprinkles to add color.

What a wonderful snack mix for the holidays.  Be sure there are many people to share it with, or you will just have to eat it all yourself, and that is not a good thing.  I made it, and I used Golden Grahams instead of Chex.  I was a stroke of genius.  I also used mixed nuts and some Cherios.  I avoided the M&M's, since it was already a sweet chocolatey thing.

I've made this thing twice now.  It's really good.  Yumm!  I used Shreddies instead of Chex and tossed in Oreo chunks.  The oreo and white chocolate was an awesome combination.  I find though, the key is not to have too much white chocolate coating as it can get too sweet.  At any rate, such an easy recipe and people of all ages from teenagers to grandparents loved this confection.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great. I used Crispix too. I also just substituted chocolate chips for the candy coated pieces but I added the after the white chocolate had cooled down.

I can't say enough about this recipe...kids and adults alike just can't eat enough of it!  I use a very good white chocolate, and you really can add/sub different cereals and candies to suit your taste!

yeah, this stuff is the best!  YOU DO NOT NEED 2 LBS of chocolate.  just one did me great.  Oh, and if you really want to flip people out, add cracklin' oat bran cereal.  jeez, the cinnamon sweet in that stuff is amazing!

My husband LOVES this stuff and devours it every time I make it.  We don't use the M&Ms and instead of cashews use mixed nuts.

This is so good!  I use peanuts instead of cashews.  I took it to my school (I'm a teacher) and everyone loved it!  Definitely a keeper.

Good stuff.  I omitted the cashews and just added a bunch of goodies from the cupboard as extras, such as mini choc. chips, a few candy corn in addition to mini M&M's.
