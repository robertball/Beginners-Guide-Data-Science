We're another Catholic family looking for good Lent recipes!  I didn't have the lime on hand, and I used my husband's homemade salsa in place of the picante sauce.  We used ocean perch and my husband enjoyed it, although he wants to try the red snapper next time.  The kids didn't want to eat it, but we grown-ups enjoyed it!  I served this with scalloped potatoes and steamed snow peas, and some wheat bread with butter.  Great for our diets; thanks for the recipe!

i just made this for dinner. i used perch and took advice from reviewers and added pat of butter to fish. i also drapped fish in 2 whole green onions, topped w/ chopped onion, then i seasoned fish w/ lemon pepper and garlic, i then added about 1/4 teaspoon of lemon juic and then about 2 tablespoons pace thick and chunky salsa. i sealed the fish in foil packets and cooked on my indoor grill. they were great!!! i will make them again using different fish. i think next time i will also try some cayenne pepper to give it some heat. the dish reminded me of a carribean fish dish i had in the bahamas and in jamaica. delicious!!!!

I thought this recipe was fabulous.  I'm not a big fish fan, but I was feeling adventurous, so I gave it a try. I stuck to the recipe and WOW!  This one's definitely a keeper.

This recipe was so quick and easy, and my husband and I thought it was great!  I used salmon filets instead of the red snapper, and it went well with the flavors.  A definite must-try.

This is an outstanding dish. I substituted ocean perch, made it just as the recipe called for. I'm not much of a cook and was skeptical but it turned out delicious. It was also the first time I had ever tried to cook ocean perch. I teamed it with a baked potato and ate until I couldn't eat any more. I highly recommend it.

I must admit that when I read over the ingredients I was nervous about how it would come out.  I used flounder because that is what I had on-hand and I have to admit is was great.

So simple to prepare and cooks so quickly.  Not to mention it was very tender.  I can't wait to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

We really liked this.  I used flounder and a medium salsa.  It's not gourmet by any means, but tasty and very easy to do.  I will most likely make it again!

We made fish tacos with this dish and it turned out really great. Very easy clean up, a definite plus in my book. I will make this again for my family. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this easy and tasty dish! Used fresh garlic salsa from the supermarket refrigerator section, but followed as Matt had written. Thanks Matt for a great, easy dish!

We made this for lunch and found it very tasty indeed.  I did add fresh garlic instead of garlic powder to tweek the flavor plus this family loves garlic. The flavors blended together very well and was very easy to prepare and clean up was a breeze.

This recipe was great.  I made it in a foil bag and put it on the grill.  I also made a veggie foil bag, threw them both on the grill together. Twenty minutes later my dinner was done, tasted fabulous, and I just had to throw out the bags and the dinner mess was clean!  Hubby loved it, too!

I thought that this was good, but the fish turned out a little tough - perhaps I cooked it too long?

I normally do not like my fish baked, but this was so good and tasty that I am cooking it again this week.  Also, it was so easy to make.

We used the Mexican Tajin seasoning  instead of the hot sauce and lime (because I didn't have them).  Also added slivers of zucchini, which my daughters liked more than the fish!

This is a great dish.  I would probably only give it 4 stars for the flavor which was good, but not incredible.  However, because of the simplicity of preparation, I have to give it 5!  My husband isn't that in to healthy foods, but he really liked the fish.

Fabulous!  Though I did change it up a lot.  I used Kingfish (King Mackerel) and rubbed the filets with a ready-made Cajun Seasoning, letting the fish marinate in the fridge for about an hour.  Then I substituted some salsa I had made at home (actually the Garden Tomato Salsa from this site) for the picante sauce and grilled the foil packet on an indoor grill.  My husband is gonna love it!  Thanks.

THIS WAS JUST OKAY. I DIDNT HAVE PICANTE SAUCE SO I USED SALSA INSTEAD. I ALSO USED FRESH GARLIC INSTEAD OF GARLIC POWDER. I JUST WASNT IMPRESSED WITH THIS RECIPE. I DOUBT I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN.

After baking, I cooked it in a skillet with more salsa and cilantro.  I used them in fish tacos with lettuce, cheese, sour cream, etc.  A family favorite!

Excellent.  I am on the South Beach Diet and this fits in perfectly.  I noticed that another reviewer was uncertain of the time when using frozen fish, me too! I ended up cooking it for about 35 minutes.  It turned out just right.  I used 2 - 6 oz frozen grouper pieces,medium garden salsa and lemon juice (no picante or lime on hand).  This was the only fish dish on the diet that we have enjoyed (3 others with salmon, mahi mahi and  orange roughby were almost inedible).  Thanks so much for sharing this easy, great recipe.

I would give the recipe more stars if it weren't for the cooking time. I chose to make this recipe because it looked quick. I ended up having to keep my fish in for almost 35 minutes before it was done. It tasted great, but I wish that it didn't take so long. Instead of butter I added coconut oil and fresh lime juice on top. Lovely.

We used fresh garlic and salsa instead of picante over perch.  Flavor was mild; not overly impressed, but good.

I used this with Red Snapper. I will decrease the garlic powder next time. I used Rotelle tomato with peppers instead of picante and it added just the right bite!

I used tilapia instead of snapper. It is wonderfully easy to make, but I think it needs a little something to more fully bring out the flavor of the fish. I will definitely try it again, but I will doctor the recipe a bit. Maybe add fresh garlic? Capers? Lemon as well as lime juice?

I used cod with this recipe because they didn't have red snapper at the store. I'm giving this a 5 star rating because I liked this recipe! My husband didn't care for it though. I'm going to try it with another fish next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I don't like seafood personally, but I made this for my FI who loves seafood.  This was my first attempt at making fish and he LOVED it.  It cooked really fast too, served it with white rice and vegetables.  I will be making this for him again in the near future.  Thanks Matt!

Great recipe! Used salmon instead of red snapper and it turned out fine. Besides the salt and pepper, I added a pat of butter and freshly pressed garlic to each fillet before topping with salsa. Served on a bed of wild rice with a side of broccoli. My wife loved it!

This recipe was extremely fast and easy.  I just put the fish on the foil (no need to fold over and seal) and added more garlic powder since we love garlic.  My boyfriend and I loved it!!!  (and he usually doesn't like the healthier recipes ;))

Great-tasting, the only problem was that I started with frozen fish and didn't know how long to cook it.  I cooked it for 20 minutes and it was still a bit rubbery, so I left it in 10 more minutes.  Also, I used fresh garlic instead of powdered and sprinkled a bit of cayenne pepper along with the other spices.

I used red snapper which has a very delicate flavor.    The picante sauce was fairly mild to suit our taste and it did not over-power the light flavor of the fish.

The cooking instructions were spot on  However, I was unclear as to whether to remove the skin of not.  As it was scaled, I decided to leave the skin on which turned out to be no problem.

Made this with ocean perch, which I do not like very much, but it is what I had.  I liked the flavors in this recipe, following it to the letter, except I had to substitute hot sauce for picante sauce.  Paired with pearl couscous and wheat rolls.  Went very well, and I will try again with a fish I like more.

This is one of my fiance's favorite dishes. I use fresh garlic, lots of fresh lime juice, and picante sauce. I usually make it with tilapia.

This was a very tasty recipe that is quick and easy to make, and it fits in with my husban's low salt/low fat diet.

This was very tasty. I served this with the Brown Rice, Broccoli and Walnut Surprise also from the site. Fast, easy and tasty. Can't think of much better. :)
