I have been making this dish for a long time now! It is wonderful! I do add 2 extra eggs and 1/2 a cup of milk. I have left the peppers out as well if I didnt have any on hand. I also slice the potatoes with my grater, they work out much better this way.  All in all and excellent dish when a few modifications are done! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Definitely a keeper!  Great for substitutions too.  Used some thawed french fries in place of diced potatoes.  Took advice of earlier poster and cooked bacon first and used bacon drippings to saute onion, red pepper, garlic and potatoes.  

Parchment paper is a must for a non-stick flip.  Mine worked perfectly.  Can't wait to put it in the weekend rotation!

Thanks!

Large baking potatoes might be the wrong description...I used 3 large ones and it was too many potatoes.  The eggs wouldn't set as the dish was too thick.  I dumped it onto a cookie sheet finally and finished it that way.  It was tasty, but use smaller potatoes or a larger pan!

I changed the order of the ingredients and did not flip over the "cake" after it was done.  I used sliced Simply Potatoes, fried to a golden brown, as the crust.  Then I topped with the sauteed onions, pepper and garlic, then the bacon and cheese.  I used 6 eggs and 1/2 cup half 'n' half.  Delicious!  Next time I will lightly salt the potatoes after they have fried.

Awesome!  The only thing I did differently was instead of using olive oil, I just cooked the bacon first and used the bacon grease to saute the veggies.  There was so much grease that I had to soak some of it up with a paper towel after it came out of the oven.  When I make this again, I will use the bacon grease instead of olive oil, but perhaps discard half of what the bacon yielded.  Regardless, it was awesome.  Definately a keeper!

I really liked this and was impressed with the presentation. I did not have any troubles with the cheese sticking to the parchment paper. I did a few things differently: I used one more egg and next time I think I may use even more eggs to make it a little more moist (maybe add a little more milk too). I thinly sliced the potatoes and left out the peppers. I used garlic powder and onion powder in the potatoes for a little milder garlic/onion flavor. I only used 8 pieces of bacon, which I thought was plenty. I baked it in a 8x8 square pan and added a little more grated cheese after I poured the egg over. All in all, this was tasty, unique and filling.

Very tasty!  It ended up making enough for two whole cake pans.  I just added 4 more eggs to even it out.  Would recommend and make again!

This was really good. Following some of the other reviewers suggestions, I made some substitutions for my husband's taste and quicker prep time:
2 potatoes - shredded, 
5 lg eggs, 
3 Tbs. milk, 
8 Tbs Hormel real bacon bits, 
no onion or peppers, 
a little hot sauce mixed in the eggs.
Baked it all in a greased 7x11 glass baking dish for 23 minutes, and it came out nice and neat when I flipped it.

A little heavy in calories and fat for my family.  We used eggbeaters and turkey bacon instead, along with reduced fat cheese.  We cut the olive oil in half, only used 2 potatoes and fat free milk.  Who knows how much we cut it by, but we did not have any grease issues that I have read in other reviews.  The people we served it to could not tell that we modified it.

I really enjoyed this breakfast casserole. I omitted the red pepper and added one egg.  Next time I might add bell pepper with the potatoes and use less onion since I really dont like it. And, like other reviewers, the cheese stuck to the wax paper. I wish I knew what to do to prevent that. It really would have been great with more cheese. Overall, I definitely recommend this recipe. The leftovers are good heated up and put in a flour tortilla for a breakfast burrito.

Time consuming....but very good.  I omitted the pepper because we just don't like them and reduced the amount of onion by half (personal preference).  I also made biscuits and gravy and it was wonderful on top of this.  Will definately make again, thanks.

Per other comments, I made the following adjustments:  Sliced 4 medium potatoes very thin sprinkled w/pepper and garlic powder; one 12 oz pkg bacon; 7 eggs with 4 tbsp milk; 1 cup shredded chipotle cheddar. Layered: potatoes, eggs, bacon, cheese.  Used 9 inch glass pie plate and covered with foil. Baked for a total of 35 minutes at 325 degrees. I did not flip it over.  I cannot tell you what a hit this was in my household!  Thank You!

This turned out really pretty.  I used the parchment paper and when I turned it out, it worked perfectly.  I used leftover Easter ham, which turned out really good, but I can see that bacon would be good, too.  Next time I'll either use hash browns or shred the potatoes and I'll use more onions as I felt that the potatoes overwhelmed the rest of the dish.  It was very filling with the amount of potatoes, but it needed a bit more flavor in the potatoes part.  Great recipe, though!

Good recipe. I made this for breakfast last week. I did modify it for out tastes I used jack cheese instead of cheddar, didn't use any bell pepper but used more onion. One thing that does need to be adressed no matter what you put into this dish is that you need to use 1-2 more eggs than the recipe calls for and an extra splash of milk if you want to have enough to coat the other ingredients.

My husband and best friend loved this. But I only gave it four stars because I had to change it a little bit. The first time I made this all of the cheese and most of the bacon stuck to the paper. So the second time I made it, I reversed the order by putting the potato mixture first, then poured the egg mixture on top of that. Then I put the bacon on and finally covered it with cheese. And put aluminum foil on top so the cheese wouldn't burn. I also had to cook it longer, about 30 minutes, for the eggs to not be runny.

This was great!  I made it for my wonderful manfriend (he's NOT a boy) and his mother - we all thought it was soooo good!!  I added two more eggs like another note suggested; also used a tad bit more milk.  I didn't chop the onions too finely, and used garlic powder in addition to the onions.  I did grate the potatoes, but used 3, as called for.    OH!  I decided to use sliced sweet honey ham instead of the bacon, and it was very very good that way too!  This is a recipe which can make many people happy: potato fans, egg fans, and whatever kind of meat you have available, I'm sure sausage would work well too~  I think with the additional 2 eggs, the time to cook is extended by five minutes, it was great!!!

We all enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have parchment paper so I lined the pan with aluminium foil sprayed with cooking spray. To make it faster I used frozen hash browns. Everything turned out perfectly. Thanks for the recipe.

This was an awsome find! Very good recipe, I did make a few changes, I shredded the potatoe, and used 6 eggs and a 1/2 cup of milk.  Didn't have any of the paper so just spayed the pan, it was a little messy but it was becasue Ididn't have the paper. Will be making this  alot! We love breakfast for supper and this is a easy way to have it. Oh an leftovers taste just as good!

Do not use a springform pan.  May leak.  I used FROZEN HASH BROWNS and it worked just fine.  THAW them half way though, or the potatoes may not cook all the way through.  Enjoy!   We did!

I made a bit of a mess of this - bad idea to use a springform pan - the egg started leaking out into the oven. Next time I make it, I'll use a different pan and I would reduce the amount of potato and add an extra egg or two.  It still tasted great despite the mess I ended up making.

I made this recipe "as is" and had a few problems.  The cheese stuck to the paper, so I had to add more after I removed it from the pan.  The flavor was a little bland, and I feel it could have used more onion and bell pepper.  After reading the other reviews I agree that more eggs and less potato would make it a lot better.

I wish I would have read the other reviews before I made this.  Definitely would use more eggs, less potatoes, and cook longer.  I might even layer the potatoes first, the bacon, the egg, and add the cheese at the end.  I didn't like adding the cheese first.  This is a good meal if you need something different or want all your breakfast items "on the go."  I loved sending it with my fiance to work.

I made the bacon first and fried the tatters, pepper and garlic in the left over bacon fat. This came out great. I put it together the night before except for the eggs. So this morning i mixed up the eggs and put it in the oven while getting ready for work. The family enjoyed it! I did have to cook an extra 10 minutes because the eggs were still runny.

I've made this for dinner several times and love it!  I didn't have parchment  paper, so the first time I used wax paper.  It stuck pretty good. The second time I reversed the bacon and cheese layers (put the bacon 1st, then the cheese).  Then I served it without the upside down process.  Much easier that way.

I followed another reviewer's advice and spread into two cake pans - added 2 eggs and increased baking time.  This was very tasty.  I thought that it was a nicer presentation to serve baked side up.  The cheezy bottom was very flat and somewhat undesirable looking. Perhaps additional grated cheese melted  quickly under the broiler would spruce it up.

Good recipe.  We reduced the bacon to 8 slices and added chicken apple sausage.  Used 1 package refrigerated hash brown potatoes instead of whole baking potatoes.  Also added 1/2 cup of egg beaters.  It was a little dry, so next time I will use 1 cup of egg beaters and 1/4 cup nonfat milk as well.

This was great!  I used cooked crumbled sausage and cooked the vegs in the microwave without the oil.  I forgot the garlic but will add it next time.  This would be good to fix the night before and add the eggs in the morning before cooking.  My husband loved it and had the leftovers the next morning.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a huge hit in our house. I used a package of frozen hash browns that was browned with the onion and peppers. I doubled the bacon and used seven eggs. Thanks for this great breakfast pie!

I only cook for 2 so I used 2 potatoes but I used 5 eggs. I cooked the bacon and veggies earlier in the day and then we had "breakfast for dinner". Next time I am going to try using cooked ham instead of bacon to save a little prep time. My husband also requested that I add chopped tomatoes next time. This was so good, thanks for sharing!

This was a wonderful recipe for brunch and feeds a whole family. I didn't have the parchment paper so I just sprayed the pan and it still came out beautifully. The only thing I did different was sprinkle more cheese on the top at the very end. Delicious!

Very Good!  Had to substitute as we were camping.  Used 1 can of canned potatoes - diced.  Diced ham steak - warmed.  Quick, easy and Good!  An I am not much of an egg eater and I still liked it.

It was a tasty dish, but I felt like it needed something more.  It was almost like the potatoes, eggs and cheese didn't meld together correctly.

Based on previous reviews, I only used 2 potatoes.  I also baked these the night before so that they were already cooked and ready to use in the morning.  I put the cheese in the pan, spread with a combination of breakfast sausage and bacon and then the cooked potatoes, followed by the eggs.  Mine did take about 25-30 minutes to bake, and in the end, the top looked better than the bottom, so I chose not to invert.  We all loved the taste and I will for sure be making this one again.

Good idea but not the right mixture of ingredients- too much potato and too bland. With a lot of changes though I think it could be great...

The nice thing about this recipe is that it is very adjustable, based on what you have on hand.  The egg mixture looks like it won't be enough, but when it is finished baking it comes out to the perfect amount.  I had to cut the amount of potatoes in half, because three large baking potatoes was way too much.  I also would have liked to see more seasoning.  Tabasco sauce would be perfect with this.  I think I would make this again with some adjustments.

Very good. I used 4 medium sized red potatoes. Skipped the red pepper only because I did not have any on hand. Used an 8" cake pan lined with foil, sprayed with a little Bakers Joy & it came out of the pan beautifully-no sticking. A little long on prep, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Thank you for sharing!

So easy and very tasty.  I served it with sweet chili sauce (kids and hubby like ketchup with their eggs) and it all got eaten up.  Thanks for sharing, I will keep this in mind for an easy Christmas morning breakfast.

Refrigerated or frozen hash browns can be substituted for the baking potatoes. They make this quicker and easierr to assemble.

This was alright, I thought I'd like it a lot more.  The potato flavor seemed to take over the flavor of the dish but it's not bad, just not what I expected. I followed the recipe exactly too except for using a square pan vs a round one - that shouldn't impact the flavor though :)

I prepared this for Easter brunch and everyone liked it.  You must like potatoes, though.  It took alot longer to cook than recipe stated but my oven temp might have been off.  It is a unique dish that I might make again.

Needs more eggs!!! I used 5 and it still wasn't enough, but it was all that I had.  Maybe less potatoes would have helped?!

We LOVE this recipe.  It is fantastic.  I do add a pound of cooked breakfast sausage and I use 6 eggs and double the milk and cheese.  I also use a 9x13 pan, line it with parchment paper (wax paper is not the same as parchment paper and will not work in this recipe).  It is always the best breakfast casserole at brunches and I always get compliments. This is a must have recipe for any brunch and any other time you want to make a meal out of breakfast.

This recipe is a keeper. I sliced the potatoes instead of dicing them. I used a silicone cake pan, so I had no sticking problems even without parchment paper. I think that next time I will try using frozen obrien potatoes.

Thank you very much for a wonderful Christmas Brunch recipe.  They turned out just like you said they would, no sticking, no fuss, just good eats!!!  I especially liked that I could do a lot of the prep work in advance and just pour in the eggs in the maorning and pop it in the oven.  This is going to be a Christmas tradition and I am going to play with variations for dinners.  Thanks again for the valuable contribution!

Good Taste.   A bit bland for a dinner meal.  Would be better for breakfast (as the title suggets).  Used 1/2 bag of frozen hashbrowns instead of potatoes and a casarole dish instead of a cake pan.  Both worked fine.  The parchment paper called for in the recipe worked perfectly.

This was really good and easy so I gave the recipe 4 stars, even though with the way I served it I would give it 5. The only thing I did different was make a package of instant Country Style Gravy and top the cake with it. I think that really made it.

Made this last night for dinner and my husband flipped.  I'll apparently have to make two next time so he can have the leftovers! It was still a bit time consuming even though I did a little bit of altering:  I just eyeballed it and used Garlic powder, Minced Onion (dried) and Crushed Red Pepper instead of the real thing.  Also used veggie oil instead of olive and put potatoes in a bowl w/ papertowels to absorb some of the oil before baking.  And I used a cheddar/monteray/mozzerella along with a Turkey Bacon/Regular bacon mix for the bottom of the pan.  Might try a few other things next time to make it a tad bit lighter/healtheir but overall a FANTASTIC recipe!

This recipe made my boyfriend and his roommates so happy!  The suggestions I have are:  1. add more eggs, 2. use a deeper dish to bake in, 3. maybe use shredded potatoes (haven't tried this, but I think it will work), and 4. cook for longer...it's better when the egg is set up!!  Great recipe though!  Definitely will make again!

This was very tasty.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I used two potatoes, four pieces of bacon, and three eggs for the two of us in an eight inch round casserole dish.  That was just a little more than we could eat.  Some of the cheese stuck to the parchment paper, but there was still plenty on the dish.  Very good, thanks.

The family loved it!  A very versatile dish that I will be using often.  I used two medium potatoes (fried in bacon grease), left out the garlic & green pepper, added two more eggs and about 1/2 c milk.  This baked up nicely in a deep glass pie pan, but next time I might give the sides of the pan a light non-stick spray.

Very good! I followed the advice of another reviewer and did the arrangement in opposite order so I didn't have to flip it since I didn't have parchment paper.

I put this together last night and baked this morning.  Only used two potatoes, sausage instead of bacon and skipped the garlic.  Served with Sausage Balls from this site.  Made an easy breakfast for this busy morning.  Thanks for posting, MOTMIK.

We enjoyed this for breakfast this morning!  It could easily serve 6 people.  I used frozen hash browns which saved a lot of time. Extra seasonings which we love in it are: pepper flakes and Penzey's Fox Point seasoning which I added to the eggs before pouring them over the potatoes.

Much easier breakfast than making eggs, bacon, potatoes separately.  Like other reviewers, i didn't have any parchment paper on hand, so i made this in reverse, more like a breakfast casserole.  Still fabulous!  I omitted the red peppers and added chives, also left out the bacon for my vegetarian taste and just added some chopped turkey bacon onto my husbands half of the dish, tasty and delicious! Will definitely use this for an easy Christmas breakfastl

This is a great pot luck dish.  It is not mushy and has good flavour.  I have received many requests for this recipe.  I will be making this again.  I also used hashbrowns from a bag and made this super fast.

I used frozen steak fries and 1 pack of oscar mayer pre-cooked bacon to save some time. I also used cheddar cheese and about 8 eggs in a 9 inch round pan. Took a little longer than expected in the oven but well worth the wait :)

My family absolutely loved this! They were a bit turned off by the name when I told them what I was making but they ended up eating it all. They can't wait for me to make it again

Fantastic Recipe! I changed it up a bit to fit what I had on hand. I used 3/4 lb of sausage, Package of shredds hashbrowns, 8 eggs(to feed my crew!) and used an 8x10 baking dish. When precooking the potatoes, I added garlic powder and paprika. I sprayed dish with pam, and had no problem with it sticking to the pan. My kids absolutely loved this dish! Thanks for sharing!

This was an easy meal to make.  We had it for dinner.  I used two medium potatoes and one small potato, since there are only two of us and I didn't want the pan to overflow.  I also used leftover Easter ham instead of bacon.  I baked mine in a 9" pan, and I would recommend adding another egg if you're baking in a 9" pan.

This was easy to make.  I used Cubed Hash Browns instead, it was so easy.  I put bacon and ham together, it add to the color and flavor. I took it to a family brunch and flipped it when we were ready to serve, it worked fine, i don't think it would of traveled well.
We served it with Salsa. That was awesome!  Definitely will make it again. Every one loved it & was different from all of the other egg dishes. Will definitely keep it in my brunch recipes file.

This recipe never fails to please. I'v made it several times and recently converted it to dutch oven. I don't even try the flipping thing though. I coo the veggies as instructed. cook the bacon in a seperate pan then layer on the veggies, then the egss and cheese. I cook until the eggs are cooked through. It still has a pretty layered look to it. TRY IT if you like dutch oven or if you want a nice breakfast for company

made this for my mum and I as was just the 2 of us and it was awesome.  I ended up adding 2 more eggs cause it didn't look like enough eggs.  Next time i think i will mix the bacon and potato mixture together then put it in the pan just to try something different but will be making this again for sure thanks

I liked the seasoning and that was about it. The cheese stuck to the wax paper, I'll try this again as a skillet meal, didn't work as a cake.

This was ok.  We cut down on the amount of potato and added extra eggs but it was still too much potato in my opinion.  Not really worth the effort.

I used 7 eggs and had to cook an extra 15 minutes or so. I thought it turned out good except something about the cheese wasn't so good. I think next time I'll try a different flavor and/or brand of cheese.

I made this recipe today and my son, husband and I thought it was a very good dish. I think the next time I make it I will cook the potatoes the night before to save time.

This was tasty although it didn't come cleanly out of the pan and so looked a bit of a mess.  Luckily it wasn't for company and still tasted good.  I followed some other review suggestions and added an extra egg and more milk.

We love this recipe! I omited the red peppers and served it up with sour cream and Louisana hot sauce. It was a huge hit. Cooking times were very accurate as well! 5 Stars!

Made a few changes to mine according to the ingredients I had on hand. Used green peppers, red potatoes and red onions. Was still super delicious.

Really blah. Hubby put hot sauce in like others suggested, but still needs more help. We'll probably make again but will use homemade sausage from this website or a hot Jimmy Dean sausage. May also use frozen hash browns for a firmer shredded potato if we have some on hand.

Absolutely fabulous! The cheese did stick to the parchment paper but it still looked great. I topped with a bit more cheese and microwaved it for 30 seconds. Oh and I also added shredded mushrooms to the potato mix because we love mushrooms and if I didn’t use them they would not be good for another couple of days. I served with the strawberries and cream recipe on here. Thanks!

This is really delicious served with sour cream and srircha on the side. It definitely needed 2 extra eggs and a little more milk to cover the potato mixture. To save time, I used Simply Potatoes refrigerated shredded hash browns in lieu of fresh potatoes, but I definitely think I would still shred the potatoes if using fresh.  I probably doubled the onion and red pepper by using a whole one of each, and I added salt and pepper to the potato as well as the egg layer.   The parchment paper is a must -- no sticking at all!

I didn't make it upside down (seemed silly), but I did use all the ingredients, maybe not in the recommended quantities, but overall it was extremely tasty. I added an extra egg, the potatoes I used just barely covered the bottom of the 8x8 pan (which was plenty) and I used 8 strips of thick cut bacon. It was a lot of work and prep, but delicious and a great way to start the day in a nice neat casserole.

This turned out really good.  It was delicious and had a nice presentation.  I did not feel like cooking the bacon so I just cut up some pre cooked turkey sausage that I had on hand.  I also added a little bit of paprika to my potatoes as they were cooking.

I turned this into a breakfast casserole and not upside down as I didn't have a round cake pan and read all the reviews about how the yield was too big. I put it in a 9x13 rectangle pan. I can't believe they didn't tell you to add any spices or seasonings to the vegetables. I added a bit of everything to them while they cooked, and some beef broth because they were starting to get brown before it was all cooked. I threw in some cilantro and parsley too. I followed the other raters advice on making it backwards, and added more egg and milk. I used egg substitute and almond milk. We don't eat bacon at my house, so I used deli sliced turkey. I used 3 cheeses on top- feta, italian blend, and colby jack. I also cooked it at 375 for 25 minutes. Came out great!

I love this idea. I make it similarly, but sans peppers as my hubby doesn't like them.  But it's so delicious, and perfect for brunch.

This is an excellent dish.  I have made it many times and my husband and son love it.  It's great for a weekend or holiday breakfast or brunch.  I never put the peppers in it since my husband and son dislike them so.  I love them but they are the majority!!  Thanks for this great recipe!!
