This recipe was TRULY easy and quick! Although my husband merely tolerated it (not a sauerkraut fan), I loved it and will attempt to cut the recipe in half to make just for myself. The chicken was super moist, but as I thought 90 mins was a bit long to bake boneless breast I only baked for 60 mins and it was fully cooked. I also used chopped kraut to avoid the long strings. This is so attractive that it'd make a great "company" dish or "buffet" dish for a crowd! It really has a great tangy flavor, just as long as you enjoy sauerkraut! A winner!

Both my husband and I really like this recipe as long as we didn't eat too much of it. It can become a litte over powering with all the sauerkraut and Thousand Island Dressing. In order to soak up some of the juices, I topped the caserole with rye bread cubes near the end of the cooking time. This made it even more authentically Reuben.

This is great recipe for a variation make this into roll by pounding the breasts flat.  Take the flat chicken breast and lay it flat lay a slice of corned beef then the cheese then the sauerkraut and roll it up. Place the rols in a dish preferably pyrex and bake.  Instead of Thousand Island try serving it with Hollandaise sauce (just ladle over the individual rolls on each plate). If you serve ths with a pasta side & some broccoli or asparagus it makes a great meal and is very pleasing to the eye as well as the tongue!

This recipe was awesome! We loved it, and my hubby couldn't get enough of it. I used almost twice the sauerkraut and mixed parsley, caraway seed and chopped onion to the sauerkraut before putting it on. I also used 9 slices of cheese. This is such a delicious recipe for anyone who loves reubens!!!thanks!

I made this tonight and all in all I think it is a great recipe. Next time I will scale way down on the thousand island dressing but that is just a personal preference. I love kraut and by putting the dressing over the top of everything it seemed to drown everything else out (which some people maybe prefer). Like I said though, look at the ingredients/layers and just assemble it according to your preference. If you like the ingredients then the combination of flavors is good. Like other reviewers I baked 350 for an hour. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this!  It is so easy.  The chicken comes out tender and I love the taste of the sauerkraut.  I have made this three times already.  The last time I only had cheddar cheese and about a quarter cup of thousand island.  It still came out tasting delicious.  I think the secret is to use good sauerkraut.  Thank you.  I will be adding this to our favorites.

I loved this recipe, but it wasn't a hit with my husband (but he's not a swiss cheese lover).  I used fat free cheese and fat free thousand island dressing and since sauerkraut has no fat, this was a great Weight Watchers meal.  I also reduced the cooking time to 60 minutes since the chicken breasts I used were not very thick.  I definitely recommend this recipe for ease and for taste.

Awesome!
I first fixed Chicken Reuben over 30 years ago and have tried a variety of minor changes but always come back to the basic recipe.  One thing I have discovered  NOTE: Do NOT USE WISHBONE dressing!!!  For some reason, when Wishbone is cooked, it turns quite bitter.  I have found that Kraft holds it's flavor and actually becomes slightly more flavorful when cooked.  Also, try this dish substituting Catalina dressing or your favorite dressing flavor.  I always sandwich the chicken breasts between layers of the swiss cheese, and construct mine with the kraut on the bottom, then the dressing, a layer of swiss, the chicken, another layer of swiss and finally another layer of dressing.  Also, another hint.  The low fat swiss seems to lose flavor and texture.  If you are going to make this, I suggest you get a good swiss cheese.  Good swiss and Kraft dressing make a world of difference.

I wasn't sure about this dish.  I love reuben sandwiches but I was unsure how the sauerkraut would taste on baked chicken.  I am SOOO glad I made this!  It was delicious!  So moist and the flavors came together perfectly!  I, like the others, only cooked for 60 minutes at 325.  Used provolone instead of swiss.  Will definitely make again!

I have never had a reuben but this recipe appealed to me.  I have made it several times now and we think it's awesome. I can't believe the simplicity of ingredients.  the only thing bad is that it takes so long to cook.

I have used a this exact recipe soooo many times for my family and friends. This has always been a winner and is always in my "memory" recipe box! The sauerkraut really makes the chicken tender.  I usually serve a baked potatoe and a green salad to complete the meal. This recipe was introduced to me a long time ago.

This was really good! I did add rye bread "croutons" to the top at last 5 minutes. Also I used bavarian style sauerkraut and 1 3/4 cup of thousand island dressing. I used the dressing recipe found on the allrecipes web site.

I loved this. I had 3 chicken breasts which were HUGE, so I sliced them in half. So I had 6 pieces of chicken. Instead of 16 oz of the saurkraut the can I bought was 14 oz. And I miscalculated and used 16 oz of Thousand Island dressing instead of the recommended 12 oz. I cooked it on 325 degrees for 90 minutes, and it was perfect. Tangy, and unique tasting.  I served mine with a baked potato. Delicious. Easy because you just stick it in the oven and dinner is ready in an hour and a half.

Well - it was a good concept...however, baking the chicken made this dish very watered down with all the juices. If I make it again, I'll flatten the chicken and then grill it...placing the toppings on afterward and then placing in the broiler.

I have been making this recipe for years. My aunt made it back when I was a little girl. When I grew up I asked about it, and she told me it was an award winner in a magazine she saw. I had no idea it was so easy! My family loves it. I usually put the chicken on top on the sauerkraut, then pour on the dressing, and I save the cheese for when I remove the foil for the last 20 minutes of baking. I serve it with mashed potatoes and green salad for a hearty meal, or just salad when we want something lighter. I purposely make left-overs, since it is just as good if not better the next day. I cannot recommend this recipe enough. SO GOOD!!!

I really liked it! Even my nephew, 13, who hates sauerkraut and baked chicken loved it! Although he pushed the kraut aside, he said it was so moist and delicious... much better than mom's bc hers is always dried out! lol What a compliment from a young man. Anyways it basically tastes like cheesy baked chicken with some tang that ISN'T dried out thanks to the kraut. I have made it at least 3 times. I love it, but I gave it 4 stars bc it is a unique taste all may not love.

People seem to either love or hate this recipe, and I had no idea what I would think of it. Only thing I did differently was to omit the parsley. It smelled really good while it was cooking, but there wasn't that much flavor. It was ok, just rather bland. And 90 mins is too long. Mine were done in about 45 minutes.

I absolutely love this dish. It takes 5 minutes to put together, and is yummy to boot.  I fed it to my parents when they visited, and they loved it, too.  A great chicken recipe!

We love Reubens, so tonight I was searching for something different to do with the chicken breasts and came across this, I decided to give this a try.  I made a little bit of homemade Thousand Island (Russian) Dressing, and I sprinkled some caraway seeds over the kraut to notch up the dressing a bit.  I also seasoned the breasts with some "Nature's Own0 (seasoned salt) before assembling the layers.  I  have a bread machine and had everything I needed to make some rye bread, which I served on the side.  Added a crispy Kosher dill, some small potatoes roasted, first cutting into large pieces then rubbing with olive oil and addes a bit of dry onion soup mix.  (This is a recipe on it's own, and can be usually found on the Lipton dry soup website or on the web).  We had a small salad with marinated halved grape tomatoes over a little fresh romaine.  Oh My!!  What a delicious meal!  We all loved it and I have added it to my regular "rotation" meals.  By the way, I have made it using both havarti cheese and provolone cheese.  It is good with either!  I hpe your family will enjoy it as much as mine did!

Easy and tasty- the saurkraut keeps the chicken breast moist and witht the chees and dressing, gives a great tangy twist.  A great new way to serve chicken breasts and saurkraut!

Used shredded rotisserie chicken, drained Vclassic sauerkraut, swiss cheese and russian dressing from scratch layered in the same order in the crockpot for 4 hrs on low.  Then served on grilled buttered french bread.  Scrumptous! A hit even with the 3y.o. Thanks for another no fail recipe!

Great dish!! As others suggested, I did cut down on the sauerkraut.  However, I did layer some sauerkraut in the pan, then added the chicken breast then put a little more sauerkraut on top of the chicken.  I cooked the chicken for 30min. before I added the thousand island dressing and cheese, this kept it from drying out completely.  I also added garlic salt to my chicken.  I will definitely make this again.

i LOVE reubens....but, i thought this was just okay.  it wasn't disgusting but the leftovers are being passed up....don't think i'll make it again.  next time i'd rather just make reubens, even if it's with chicken instead of corned beef.

Very good.  Made my own Thousand Island, and used chicken breast tenders, but worth the effort.

Love this recipe, have made it lots of time!   The chicken is always so tender and moist.  You can use other cheeses too if you don't care for swiss.  I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and a veggie, yum!!

After looking for a recipe to use up leftover sauerkraut, I decided on this.  It was very quick to prepare and easy to make.  My husband (like others) does not like Reubens, however he did like this, although asked when I make it again not to put so much Thousand Island dressing and sauerkraut on his.  60 minutes was all I baked it for.

Has been a standard in our house every winter since it was published.  I use sauerkraut from a jar, drained but not rinsed, as I love the sourness of the sauerkraut as it mingles with the nuttiness of the cheese.  I use homemade thousand island (from this site), as we seldom use it, except for this recipe, and have made it with and without the parsley - we prefer it without, but that's just us. Thanks for sharing this recipe - looks like you have made some sauerkraut converts because of this recipe!

I was craving some sauerkraut and my hubby loves reuben so I thought I would try it. I now wish I would of just cooked chicken and sauerkraut and left off everything else. I just didn't care for it.

I made this recipe because it sounded so weird I had to try it. I have to admit it looks weird but both myself and my husband, (who's a picky eater) loved it! As far as presentation, the parsley adds a lot. Also, the dressing mellows out the kraut and the flavors blend nicely.When serving, I reccomend a veggie with color to brighten up the plate.Also, as others have mentioned, 90 minutes is way too long to cook. An hour was perfect. Next time, I am going to chop the chicken before baking and add either Canadian bacon or chopped prosciuto to make more of a cassarole.All in all, a very yummy dish!

Love this recipe!  I've made it often, and always use mozzerella cheese instead of the swiss.  The chicken comes out really moist.  It doesn't need 90 minutes if you use thawed chicken breasts.

HORRIBLE!!! I have no idea how it took the $10,000 prize. It tasted like when I throw up, seriously. I couldn't taste the chicken. I think it was the swiss cheese.  Next time (if there will even be a next time, probably when i'll be desperate to eat) i'll put chedar instead of the swiss.Also it only took me 1 hour to bake it. The 90 mins. are too much.

Very tasty. I love  rebens and this was nice. I made my own fat free thousand island dressing ans use laughing cow swiss cheese. Something seemed to be sort of missing in this for me. I think next time I make this I might add a layers of thinly sliced pareboiled potatoes to the bottom and also add some dill pickles on the side

Thank the heavens you listed this recipe! I've made this dish for years after having seen Marcia Adams make it on her PBS show but lost my copy. I've always liked how tender the sauerkraut makes the chicken and have never had anyone say they didn't like it. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different to do with their chicken. Thanks again for listing this!

We're a bit of a 'Nigela Lawson' cook and not very good ones at that. We managed to pull this recipe off with sucess and it tasted great. Had it for New Years Day dinner infact. We couldn't get our hands on sauerkraut so we boiled fresh cabbage up and used that. We also exchanged the swiss cheese for grated cheddar cheese and the thousand island dressing was made from mixing equal parts of tomato ketchup and mayo together. Quick and simple to made and tasted yummy, served with boiled potatoes.

Wow! This was delicious! I made it exactly as written and it came out perfect. I am one of those people that thinks everything taste better in a crock pot. Not this! This dish is wonderful as is, but the second time I made it I thought I would put it in the crock pot and it was horrid! I wouldn't recommend the crock pot for this dish!

I really liked this, I have made it twice. Once using a 1000 island recipe from this site and once with store bought. Both times it came out wonderful. My husband, who isnt a huge fan of 1000 island dressing, doesn't find it as appealing, but he loves sauerkraut and  swiss cheese so its a good compromise. I think it looks quite lovely served up with parsley potatoes, and its super simple.

Sometimes when something seems too good to be true you end up with a stinky house and nothing for dinner but hopes and dreams, sigh. Anyways, I love reuben sandwiches, I make my own russian dressing (extra horseradish, obv) and only buy the finest of pressed, preformed deli meats on it.  But they are soo fattening and my family doesn't like them.  So I must of been crazy to think they'd go for this mix of thousand island dressing-chick-sauerkraut dish.  
I followed the directions exactly and felt positively saintly when my hubby got home and I could say, 'dinner will be done in fifteen, hunnybunny.'  Then I opened the oven to a grease slick of orange chicken with enough pickle relish (from the dressing) swimming in oil to make a hungry dog run away.  The smell was sour and sweet, like pickle apple lollipops.  My hub said, 'what is that?  my son said, 'what happened?  Is everyone okay.  So I tried one bite and it tasted like, well, there's no polite way to say it, so I wont.  Chicken Reubens are not for us.

Use red kraut instead of the usual saurkraut.  Add cheese the last five minutes of cooking.  Yummy!

Even a friend who has never had a Reuben and says she doesn't like sauerkraut enjoyed this! It was soupier than I had pictured, but maybe I could have drained the sauerkraut better. We plan to make chicken Reuben sandwiches with the leftovers. Thanks for a great new combination!

Our Family Loved this recipe, even my 16 year old.  At first look, the chicken and sauerkraut didn't sound too appetizing, but it was great.  I used a whole jar of Kraut.  I think I'll try it in the crockpot next time.

If you like saurkraut and/or reuban sandwiches, you'll like this.  My family thought it was great.  I've made this on a number of occasions and we haven't gotten tired of it.

This was really good.  I used low-fat dressing and provolone cheese and only baked it for about an hour.  Totally juicy and yummy.  Thanks, Paula.

This was so simple.  I used to have an old recipe similar to this but you had to stuff the chicken breasts and it was very messy and you had to watch for the toothpicks.  Same flavor but easier by far.  The flavor is scrumptious and, yes, it looks great on the table. Everyone loves this one! It's a regular in our house.
Update: 8/27/18  I still make this on occasion but it doesn't take that long to cook .  I cover  it  for a while and near the end uncover it.   Also, I make my own dressing which is way better than any bottled dressing. and I  cut up the chicken into chunks.   Yum

Very easy to make...awsome flavor!! 90 minutes might be too long to bake boneless chicken breasts, though. I suggest checking it after about 45 minutes. Chicken is done when you prick it and the juice runs out clear.

I think that this recipe is good but I liked the leftovers better.  After we ate dinner I cut up the remaining chicken breasts into chunks and mixed it with the sauerkraut/cheese blend.  The result was a chicken sauerkraut casserole which was incredible.  The next time I make this I will make it this way first.

This was great and so easy to make!  I didn't have any Swiss cheese so used Mozzarella. My kids did pick off the topping but that was to be expected.  My husband and I loved it!

I didn't think this was going to be as good as it was.  Will definitely make again.  I think it would probably work with pork chops, as well.

I forgot to add that I layered the ingredients in a different order: chicken, sauerkraut, dressing, cheese. This way the cheese would get a little brown.

This was so easy and easy to adjust to a lower sodium diet by simply not sprinkling salt on the chicken. It was so good that I emailed the recipe to my son that has to always be super careful about how he eats because he is in the Air Force, but needs easy single friendly meals that are not Ramen

My husband loves this recipe but then we both love sauerkraut.  Because we need to keep our sodium intake down, I rinse the sauerkraut very well before I use it.

As other said, I liked all the ingredients and thought this would be a five.  I followed recipe except for reducing the Thousand Island Dressing.  I am glad I did because the baking dish was swimming in sauce.  I didn't finish mine and my partner did but we got rid of the leftovers.  It was easy to make - oh, I also reduced the cooking time to 50 minutes and it was cooked.  I would think it depends on the thickness of the chicken.

I liked this recipe, but the one my Mom gave me was you use slaw mix and mis that with the sauerkraut, which makes it less sour.  Also you can use Munster, provalone, or mozzarella cheese.  They are all yummy!!
