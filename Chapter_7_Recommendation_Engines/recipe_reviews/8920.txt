An amazing recipe!  Make it better, however, by adding lemon juice with your cream sauce, otherwise it's not so amazing... Being a universty student, quick and easy recipes are ideal, this recipe is about as easy as it gets!

This was a great meal - my husband and I loved it! It was easy to whip up and had a very smooth taste to it. We added rice and poured the cream sauce right over it - yum! Something wonderful for a cold night!

UMN....I'm not even sure what to do here.  Well, I scaled the recipe to 3 servings, for the kids & I (baby had plain chicken, egg allergy, hubbys at a buisness dinner..lucky dogg!) and I was trying to lower the calories on this, so I used fat free evaporated milk for the cream.  So as I'm concocting this, I realized that it is nothing other than a chicken omelet with milk.  While I thought the chicken turned out surprisingly good (with the egg batter), the sauce was....milk & onions.  So as I was trying to redeem it, I added a splash of lemon juice, mistake #1, it sorta curdled & looked wierd.  So then I tried to go Alfredo....mistake #2, as it was too late, the end result looked like vomit.  Hmmm, pretty sure I won't be trying this again, it's not worth the calories. 3 stars for okay chicken, sorry Mike.

First, this is not Chicken Francese at all.  Francese (Veal or Chicken) is made with an egg batter, sauteed, and then finished with lemon juice, white wine, and lemon slices.

Second, the instructions are incomplete, and there's far too much cream.  This is closer to Alfredo and if I saw this on a restaurant menu and got this concoction, I would have sent it back.  Francese is Francese.  I'm a pro, and was rather shocked on this take of the classic dish.

I changed the cream with lowfat milk, marinaded the chicken with salt and pepper before I cooked it with low heat. Covered the pan so that the meat is wellcooked. Combined with plain rice and greek salads makes this recipe so good!

I found this recipe very easy and very good. The chicken was tender and the cream was tasty. I added some pepper and served the chicken over a bed of rice. Next time I might add mushroom. I will definitely make this again. My family really liked it.

Excellent nutritious meal. Ready in minutes, put in oven and you have a low fat and complete meal which leaves room for a lucious desert.

Delicious! Definitely decrease amount of cream, though. Not a recipe where all the ingredients have to be precise and perfect amounts. I played around with it, and didn't add the egg. It tasted fine, without the egg.

Ok this recipe was not that bad, but it wasn't anything that much different from an alfredo until I added some things.  When I melted butter to make the cream sauce, I sauteed the green onions and also added some white wine.  This added a special taste, that set this dish apart from others I have served.  Using chicken cutlets made cooking the chicken fast.  Also perhaps adding a little prosciutto and giving that a quick saute with the wine and onion would make the dish good too.

It says to cook the chicken until half way done but then it says to put in the other ingredients and just let it come to a boil then serve.  If we did that, the chicken would not be done.  Also there is nothing to make the heavy cream thicken.  So it was like half-cooked chicken in thick milk.  If you made a rue out of the cream and flour, let it simmer for a while and cooked the chicken more, it may of been better.

This is very tasty, with a few changes! I sauteed in a little Enova oil & added more cheese to the chicken breasts. To the sauce, I added lemon juice, lemon pepper, Tony Chachere's seasoning, ground pepper & salt! Great flavor! Next time I will add capers!

Delicious!!!  My teenagers really enjoyed this meal.  I didn't think they would like the sauce over the chicken and pasta, but I was fooled.  Thanks.

We liked the flavor (added some garlic), it was very easy and quick to assemble, but I wouldn't serve this for everyday as it was so rich and fattening.  It is quite a mild dish, so I think the reviewer who served it with a Greek Salad has the right idea.  You need rice to sop up the creamy sauce, and a spicy sidedish to give it some kick!

Thought it was fair Using some creative licence with it would really impove on it. If I cook it again, I won't even pull up the recipe, I will start from scratch and do what I usually do, go to the cupboard and start pulling out spices. The basic concept will stay the same but there will be a lot move flavor/spices and a lot less cream.

I gave this one star but truthfully would have given it no stars if possible.  I'm not sure how this recipe actually turns out because I never even made it.  Sounds like it might be good.  I gave it 1 star because this is NOT Chicken Francese.  CF is not made with cream. You bread chicken in flour, salt and pepper, than lighlty brown in butter.  To that you add chicken stock and lemon juice and gently sauted the sauce.  There are no onions, cream or parmesan cheese in Chicken Francese.  I would call this "Creamy Chicken" maybe, but it's not even a close relation to an actual Chicken Francese recipe.

Very interesting and rich meal! Not the typical chicken "francese" recipe, usually no cream just lemon juice. The parmesan cheese made it interesting and yummy instead of breadcrumbs. I made 2 servings and served over angel hair. Very rich and can only eat so much in a sitting so I had leftovers. Bonus! Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars With these edits. Cook Parmesan coated chicken in butter/oil on medium to brown, (2 chicken breasts cut in half). mix 1/2 cup white wine (used Pinot Grigio) 1/4 cup lemon juice, t tablespoon of chicken broth granules, and 1 and 1/2 cup cream. Add green onions and mix. Pour over chicken, reduce heat to med-low, let cook for 5-8 minutes. Remove chicken and add some flour to thicken sauce. This was amazing!

This was a very easy and good recipe.  Everyone in my house enjoyed it very much.  I agree with the too much cream sauce probably could be decreased a little.  But, what we did was made a pasta and some vegetables broccoli, carrots and cauliflower and put the sauce over the vegetables and pasta.  And the extra sauce we saved and will put over pasta for a later meal.
