Delicious!  I used half pepperjack and half monterey jack.  And you definitely need more than 4oz of sausage... other than that, perfection!  I gave out the recipe all morning

Fantastic!  Not sure what makes it Bayou-like - it might need crawfish for that. :)  I did make some changes, using:
- 1 lb turkey italian sausage
- About 13 oz of a fresh baguette that I "butterflied" and put in the oven at low heat for a while until somewhat dry.
- 1/2 lb Sargento shredded Mexican cheese blend
- 2 c whole milk
- 16 eggs
- White pepper
- Maybe 1 T + 1 t Dijon mustard
- About 1/2 c white wine
- About 3/4 - 1 c sour cream in the egg mix and dolloped the rest of the 16 oz container on top after cooking
- About 1/4 t cinnamon
- Sprinkled the green onions on top instead of baking in the eggs
- Sprinkled Cajun seasoning on top just before serving
Took it to work and cooked it in an electric skillet @ about 210 for an hour, removing condensation on lid once.  Put Slap Ya Mama seasoning and Sriracha chili sauce on the table.  It received RAVE reviews!

Great dish, went like hot cakes for the office Friday brunch.  I use l lb. of Jimmy Dean Italian Sauage and used ground red pepper instead of the flakes.  As my husband would say "This is company quality".

I think the title of being a "bayou" style dish is a little inappropriate given the chosen ingredients, but that being said, it tasted really good.  Because I was wanting a Cajun kick, I bought a 4 pack of Louisiana  style Cajun sausages.  Several reviewers suggested that it didn't have nearly enough sausage in it, so I just chopped up all 4 sausages and I thought it was the perfect amount.  I also really liked the subtle wine flavor, which is unique for a breakfast casserole (I just used the cheapest Chardonnay I could find).  My only suggestion is that I think the Monterey cheese could be cut down from 4 cups to 3 cups.  Overall, I thought it was a unique, great idea, and I will definitely make it again.

In a word...OUTSTANDING!!!  As the man of the house I do virtually all the cooking.  I can tell you that this is one of the easiest recipes to fix, and the results were just incredible.  There were only two small pieces left from the 8 serving dish.  I have already emailed this to everyone I know.  Thank you so very much for a tasty dish that even a man can't mess it up!!!

This was a good dish to make for a brunch.  However, I made some changes that I think really improved it.  First of all, there's not enough sausage in the original recipe.  I doubled it, and it was just enough where you could at least taste it.  Second, it calls for a lb. of cheese.  For me, that is way too much.  I cut that in half and used one package (8 oz) of cheese which worked fine.  That way you can taste the rest of this instead of just the cheese.  Third, i didn't have green onions so I chopped up one onion and sauteed it in a pan THEN added it.  It was delicious and you could taste that buttery soft onion in there... I would make this again, but not as the original recipe states.  The bread soaking in the egg overnight made it delicious though and it is worth a pop in the oven!

This was very tasty and it was different than the usual breakfast casserole. The white wine gives it a great taste. Very easy to make, I used turkey sausage and 1/2 pepperjack cheese, 1/2 medium chedder. I do not think I used as much cheese as it calls for though. I will definately make this my number one breakfast recipe.

This is SO similar to something I make called "Three Cheese Breakfast Bake."  Mine has 1/2 # sharp cheddar and 1/2 # swiss, instead of the Monteray Jack, and cubed ham in place of the sausage.  We prefer fresh chive to red pepper.  Go ahead and experiment!  It's a great recipe!

I thought it was too rich and a few too many flavors going on with the wine, sour cream & italian sausage. I won't bother making it again

Wow! This was a big hit at a recent party. It made a ton and was very good the next day for breakfast. It was also very convenient to assemble the day before.

I used ingredients I had on hand (ground vinison sausage), and a  slightly different cheese mixture, but it was wonderful. Right before cooking I added chopped artichoke hearts (frozen but thawed), and mushrooms. The kids wouldn't touch it, but that was the plan! ha!

Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely serve again.

This was the HIT of our New Year's Day Brunch. Several people asked for the recipe. I made some minor substitutions based on what I had on hand.  Instead of day-old bread, I used some left-over Pepperidge Farm herbed stuffing mix, used 1lb of breakfast sausage and instead of Monterrey Jack cheese I used 8oz of white cheddar and 6oz of crumbled Feta.

You know it's a great recipe when people can make minor modifications and it STILL comes out wonderfully.

..I don't get it! Mine turned out really bad..:( 
I used bacon rather than italian sausage and did not have any white wine on hand. The bread made it a little tough and the addition of sour cream and parmesan at the end did not help. The kids did not care for it at all.  I'm not sure what I did wrong...

I am thrilled to have a new and different egg bake recipe such as this one.  I just served it to 8 of my HS friends (of 45+ years) and they also loved it.  I was handing out the recipes as they left.  Now I know what I'll serve for our traditional Xmas Day brunch.  The only change I made was to use ground hot Italian sausage, and I used 1 full lb of it to add a little more zip   Thank you!

Oh, yummmmmm.  This was good.  I made it for Christmas brunch and everyone asked for the recipe.  My MIL asked me to make it for her for some guests she is having this week.  I accidently used mozzarella cheese instead of Monterey jack.  Whoops.  But, it was still very good.  I used a whole pound of herbed sausage (garlic and herbs).  If you use that much sausage, you do not need to add any salt.  This is a keeper recipe, for sure!!  Even my two pre-teen boys loved it.  Thank you Lisa!

I took this to a Bible study function and everyone loved it. Here are the mortifications I made; 12 oz. of sage flavored breakfast sausage instead of Italian, a little less than 1 pound of cheddar/jack cheese, and a bit more red pepper flakes than the recipe called for. I'd give this recipe 5 stars but it's kind of a pain being made one day, cooked 30 min covered, 30 uncovered and then finishing with another 10. I didn't have day old bread so I cut a 1 pound loaf into about 10 pieces and put it in a 200 degree oven for 20 minutes before cutting it into 1/2 dollar size pieces. The servings can be cut pretty small since this is very rich. I waited 30 minutes to cut and serve and it held its heat and served perfectly into squares.

Great recipe - made this for Father's Day brunch.  Use 3-4 Italian sweet sausages, 1/2 tsp of chili flakes - just the perfect amount of heat.  Used 2 cups of Monterey jack cheese - this was just right.  Don't forget to spray your pan first.  I served this with a big bowl of cup of mixed fruit and some scones. Cooking time as per recipe are accurate.  So easy as you can make this the day before.  Everyone loved it!

Very nice dish. I omitted the sourcream and parmesean cheese step. I didn't really think it needed it. Everybody loved the dish as it was.

I thought this was tasty, but nothing amazing.  I agree on adding the pepperjack cheese to kick it up.  Not great reheated and makes a lot, so be sure to make it when you have a crowd.

Loved it!  Made it for a family Christmas Eve brunch - my aunt & uncle from Louisiana thought it was fantastic. I overcooked it a little but still thought it was great.  Glad to have a egg casserole that calls for something other than ham!   I'd consider this one a keeper - will definitely make it again.

We LOVED this dish!  Made it for Christmas brunch and it was a hit.  I scaled it for 12 servings and was still able to fit it in a 9 x 13 dish. We doubled the meat, but reduced the cheese by 1/3  and were pleased with the results.  Make this soon!

I was so unimpressed by this recipe although it seemed like it was going to turn out so good and smelled really good while it was cooking.  It seemed like it needed something, but we couldn't figure out what that was - maybe a little less bread and a lot more green onions.  The only change I made to this recipe was use a mixture of Monterey and Colby cheese because my supermarket was out of just Monterey - other than that I went by the directions to a T.  Disappointed - will not make again. (Although two of my guests did really like it, the others weren't impressed either.  No one asked me for the recipe).

Very, very good. Next time I will use spicy ground breakfast sausage instead of Italian--I like that flavor more. But this was a hit at our last brunch. A keeper!

Delicious! Easy! Just broil the cheese to get it to turn a nice brown.  Served at our golf breakfast and everyone said it was good.  I put a heaping 1/4tsp of red pepper tho'.  Next time I'll use a half tsp because we like things a bit spicier than some of our friends.

I made this for a post wedding family brunch and it was a huge success.  I did increase the sausage (used Trader Joe's brand turkey italian).  I hesitated about the sour cream but it really added a great flavor. I also thought the wine a nice addition. Everyone wants the recipe!

Excellent!  I loved preparing it the night before.  The taste of wine really came out in the dish which made for a refreshing change from other egg things I've made.

Good but needs a little kick.  Maybe pepperjack cheese or spicy sausage.  Will try again.

This is rich, but so good.  I made it on Christmas Eve, so that we could have a hot breakfast Christmas morning.  Everyone stopped opening presents for this!  Pair with fruit salad to balance the richness.

I took this to a church brunch and it was the hit of the meal. I used a sage sausage and upped it to a full pound. Will definitely make it again.

This recipe is great. I made it for a girlie brunch and everyone approved. I doubled the red pepper flakes which gave it a nice little kick for a different brunch flavor. The only thing I would consider is adding more sausage. 4 ounces is two sausages, I would probably use 4 sausages next time. My husband doesn't like breakfast foods but absolutely loved this one. Thanks for the recipe!

This makes enough for six people with left overs! This was made for Christmas Day brunch 2014.  We did not make it a day before,so the ingredients did not really get a chance to blend.The taste was very good,texture was very good meaning non soggy. This is the 2nd making it and I am sure we were a little heavy on the sour cream on top, but still very good,saved in the recipe box for good keeping.

I had a Champagne Bunch party in my home, and did what no sensible person would ever do: made three things for the first time, without "test-driving" the recipes. And also refused to actually measure anything. Har-har!
One of the three was this dish.
I used a full 1lb. roll of sage breakfast sausage, added some cayenne to the eggs, topped the sausage layer with sliced red bell pepper (GENIUS!) and didn't measure the cheese...I just sprinkled the amount I thought seemed reasonable. (Also, I used cheddar instead of Monterey Jack.)I suspect it was less than the allotted amount.
My bread was day-old Ciabatta, also not measured, and also maybe less than the suggested amount. Whatever, I just sprinkled bits about until it seemed like enough.
It was DELICIOUS. Top-notch. And I am SO picky about good-quality food! My guests complimented my cooking, and my husband took the left-overs to work the next day for a holiday pitch-in, and came home empty-handed. 
FIVE STARS. Would go with six if it were allowed. :)

Made this last weekend for a family brunch.  It was outstanding! I did mess up on the instructions though, and put the sour cream in with the egg mixture instead of saving it for the top, but it made it yummy!! I used 1/2 pepper jack, 1/2 monterey jack as someone suggested, and loved it.  Think next time I will add more red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch!

OK, but nothing exceptional. I used pepper jack cheese & it still did have much zip.  Don't know why the white wine, sour cream or parmesan cheese are needed because couldn't tell what purpose they served.  Probably will stick to other overnight breakfast recipes.

I made this recipe for Easter brunch and it was a hit.  However, tasty and rich as it was, the suggestions that Pepper Jack could be substituted for 1/2 the cheese would have made this a little more interesting.  The addition of a spicy sausage such as chorizo or Jimmy Dean spicy would have livened it up too.  I did make a pico de gallo to serve with the dish, and it added the needed color and texture.  I doubled the recipe in a lasagne pan and it easily served 18 people.  The recipe was quite good because of the quality of ingredients and the richness of the cream and sour cream.  It simply needed a boost in contrasting flavor and a little color in the dish.

I made this for Easter brunch and the family loved it.
I did make some changes
used chicken sausage
used yellow onion instead of the green onion
used colby jack and low fat milk  since that is what I had on hand.
I loved that I was able to make it the night before especially since the fam was coming over at 9:30am!

Thank you for posting such a lovely brunch recipe. I have several brunces a year, and this was such a nice change to the traditional stratas I usually make. A great flavor....I'd give it more than five stars if I could!!

After my brunch guests left I felt like some kind of cooking star.  This dish brought rave reviews from everyone!!  (the kids wouldn't touch it, but never eat egg dish anyway, I had homemade waffles for them)  It was so different from your run-of-mill egg casserole, that people were looking foreward to trying it.  My sister said it tasted much better than it smelled.  I made 2 pans and that was a bit too much for 10 adults. I increased the sausage to a whole pound, and used spicy bulk sausage (not in the casing). I also used 1/2 Pepper Jack and 1/2 Monterey Jack (1/2 lb. of each).  Broiled to brown the cheese for about three minutes.  Then let it sit about 25 minutes before serving!  Perfect!  It had quite a kick. I served it with the best salad recipe in the world from this site: Mandarin Almond Salad (be sure to add the craisins). It was the perfect complement!

It is excellent, and though people are sort of sceptical about it at first for some reason, once they get a taste they LOVE it.  I made it the first time with breakfast sausage since that is what i had, and it was great that way too.

Excellent! Made this for my Sunday School class and it disappeared quickly. This dish was easy to prepare the night before and baked up beautifully in the morning. The cheese didn't brown on top but I think it may have to be broiled for that to happen. I can't rate it as far as kid pleasing but the adults seemed to love it and I was asked for the recipe.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!  It was both easy and delicious.  I made it for my husband's birthday brunch, and everyone raved.

I used 16 ounces of Italian Sausage instead of 4 oz. I used one stick of butter. And I used a bunch of green onions instead of the three called for. It was a big hit!

So freaking good. I used dry stuffing instead of bread just because that's what I had. Followed the recipe the rest of the way adding a little spice here and there.

I made this for Sunday brunch, and omitted the sour cream on top.  The flavor with the wine is unique and fantastic, and using french bread assures you have no soppy bread at the bottom.  This is a keeper!

Love that it can be made the night ahead!  I doubled the sausage, using andouille to give it a more Louisiana touch.  I also added a small can of diced Ortega chiles & a small can of sliced black olives.  I bought sliced sour dough French bread, cut it in small uniform pieces & toasted it briefly before using it.  Doubled the pepper flakes & served it with srirachi sauce ( we're a spicy family ).  Great recipe!

This was a big hit at brunch. Next time I'll only use half the cheese. With the texture of this dish, the cheese was almost overpowering it but a small adjustment will fix it. I'll probably use about 2/3 of what the recipe calls for. Enjoy!

I was confused by the amount of bread called for because I wasn't sure if the recipe meant 1 pound of bread or 1/2 of a 1 pound loaf! But after consulting my boyfriend, we decided this meant 1 pound. The first time I made this I had about a 3 pound loaf (no kidding) of french bread and kind of guessed at what a pound might be. It turned out excellent. The next time, I bought a 1 pound loaf, and used the whole thing, and thought it was  too bready. So, my conclusion is, I think 1 pound is a little too much bread. I would use 3/4 pound, or even 1/2. I'm still wondering if that's what the recipe was calling for. With all that bread, the other flavors get kind of lost. This was good enough for me to make again, actually it was very good. I didn't change anything. I do agree with other reviewers who added more sausage.

This is by far the recipe I use most frequently from this site because it is requested for every morning get-together!  Love, love, LOVE it.  My only modification is that I use a package of hot Italian turkey sausage (casings removed) instead of the regular sausage.

I made this casserole on Christmas Eve to bake and serve on Christmas morning.  I followed the recipe for the most part, the only changes I made were to add a medium diced onion to the sausage mixture when cooking and I omitted the white wine because I didn't have any that was appropriate to use in this dish.  I was a bit concerned about how the sour cream would affect this dish, but the end result was a really good savory casserole which was perfect with fresh fruit salad on a busy morning.

I have made this on several occasions and I always get "Where did you get that recipe"!  I do add more sausage and don't even bother measuring the sour cream.  I just simple add enough to cover the top.

This recipe has become a family tratition in my home. It is one of my favorite recipes I have found here on Allrecipes. I have my whole family over for Christmas morning Brunch, and this will be the third year in a row I have been asked to make this. I also add some crumbled bacon and chopped ham. Since I make 3 differnt pans, I leave the hot out and one, and one is "kicked up with a lot of heat for all the different taste bud in the family.

This is a great way to use leftover French or Italian loaf bread. I didn't let it sit overnite, only a couple of hours, as my crew was hungry. I will make some small changes next time to make it more our taste, but it is good as is.

Terrific!!!  I used 6 oz, 2 links, of hot Italian sausage.  I think I will use 3 links next time and add bit more red pepper because I like things HOT.  Everyone else thought it was perfect.  A perfect Christmas tradition.

This casserole was wonderful! I served it at the first brunch I threw for my best friends. Aside from adding more sausage (we love our MEAT!), I followed the recipe exactly. I turned from the "microwave girl" to "domestic goddess" instantly. Thank you so much!

Made this for the first time for a Sunday Brunch and everyone loved it!  Next time I will put at least 16 oz of the Italian sausage.  We had green tobasco on the table which adds a great zest.  Served this with scalloped cabbage & griled peaches with almond cream.  Fantastic!

This recipe was okay.  Nothing special.  I've made other breakfast casseroles that were just as good.

I tried this for brunch for my family along with fresh fruit salad and breakfast potatoes. It was definitely "different" at first, but was quite good! Family liked it and the leftovers tasted even better the next day. Great recipe that I will make again when I want to impress. Thanks for this one!
