These potatoes were awesome! I made a few changes to the recipe though. I didnt use velveta because we dont like that, instead I used a bag of cheddar cheese. Also, instead of using 1 1/2 of milk i used a can of cream soup (any kind) and mixed that with milk. It turned out to be a bit too much butter but they were still awesome and really yummy! Everyone was chowing down. They are also good for leftovers, I had them for lunch today! Thanks for the great recipe!

Recipe was very tasty and was a big hit.  My only problems with recipe were "medium baking dish" - my medium baking dish was too small & cooked over into my oven (had to put it on cookie sheet) and directions do not specify greased or ungreased.  I would definitely say ungreased.  It all fit well into my baking dish nicely but baked over anyway.

Very tasty and the ooey goey cheese made this a good comfort food. Also, plenty of room for alterations to your tastes.  We have added sauted green bell peppers (chopped) and some minced garlic but you can add the "extras" that you and your family enjoy most with cheese and potatoes (or just prepare as is). However, we noticed we did not need to cook as long as recipe recommends, even with the extra ingrediants...perhaps we used thinner potato slices? Either way, have made again and will continue into the future.

This recipe was easy to make. However, after reading previous ratings I substituted 1/2 the velveta with sharp cheddar, added 1 T. of flour to the milk and doubled the cooking time. Everyone loved them and I was asked for the recipe! I would definately make these again!

These were very good. My husband loved them as he is a big fan of scalloped potatoes and this version is much easier than making the cream sauce by hand and then adding the cheese. I halved the recipe and used 1/2 colby-jack, 1/2 processed cheese and added flour to the milk before pouring it into the dish and it was yummy.  I also added a little paprika with the salt and pepper for each layer. It won't have the same smooth texture as it does if you make the sauce separate from scratch, but the key is to keep stirring this as it bakes. I also have a mandolin so slicing the potatoes is a snap and it didn't take me long to put this together. Great time saving recipe if you are craving home made scalloped potatoes.

I used 4 Yukon Gold potatoes, less onion than called for and substituted a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella cheese for the velveeta.  You can omit the butter altogether.  It was great!

VERY GOOD!  I cut the recipe in half as there are only 2 of us.  Other than that, I followed it exactly.  To cut down on prep time, I peeled and sliced the potatoes and kept them in a bowl of water until it was time to prepare dinner.  This was a very enjoyable side dish to a ham dinner and I will be making it again.  Thank you Holly Bobst for sharing your recipe!

This was really nice although I sprinkled some tasty shredded cheese between the layers instead of the processed cheese and didn't use quite so much butter. It is important to stir (or spoon) liquid over potatoes during cooking or else it  won't thicken.

This is pretty good.  I think there is way too much butter. It just pooled around, and made it greasy. I had to soak it up with a napkin.  Also, I didn't know how thin to slice the potatoes, so I did some thin, and some not-so-thin. The not-so-thin ones weren't quite done, so I recommend cutting them thin, but not like paper-thin. It makes a lot, so if there are only a couple of you, I would cut the recipe in half unless you want leftovers. Overall, not bad. May or may not make it again. It's worth a try. My husband and the guys liked it.

This is my mother's scallped potato recipe and I've been making it for years. Thank you Holly for posting with measured ingredients. I've been throwing this delicious dish together for years and have never measured. Now I can finally give out the recipe. Some of the reviews have modified by adding flour etc. which completely changes the taste and texture of this recipe. If anything I agree that it's easy to add in additional ingredients like various peppers or shredded cheese between layers or on top to add a kick to the taste. My husband likes to add red devil sauce once on his plate. Delicious!

i dont have processed cheese food in the house unless im making rotel dip so i used shredded sharp cheddar cheese and i felt it would need more than s&p so i added some garlic. i used a big onion and i think id use a smaller one next time. all in all a basic solid recipe just needs more seasoning.

Very good recipe.  I made these at Easter and everyone loved them.    I did as other viewers and used 1/2 lb. processed cheese and 1/2 lb. shredded cheese.  I also used 2 cups of milk.  I baked for 1 1/2 hrs.  Be sure to slice the potatoes thin.  Will definitely make this recipe again!

These had a really good flavor but they looked rather unappetizing. The cheese/milk curdled while cooking and I was certain they were going to be garbage. Wrong! They had a wonderful flavor and my husband, who doesn't really care for potatoes, said that they were the best potatoes he's ever had and wants me to make them again. I will gladly make them again for our family but due to it's unappealing appearance I don't think I would ever consider making this for company. As other reviews suggested I cut the amount of butter in half and while it didn't detract from the dish, I still thought that it could have done with less. Next time I will omit it completely or maybe just add 1 Tbsp. I also recommend using a large dish rather than a medium as it was nearly impossible to stir without making a huge mess.

I cooked it covered in the microwave for 20 minutes, then put it in the oven uncovered for 5 minutes to brown the top. Used sliced cheddar cheese instead of velveta. Delicious!

This was a great base recipe but pay attention to everyone's reviews and tweak it!  After reading the reviews, I sliced them pretty thin to quicken cook time and cut out 1/2 of the velveeta in favor of real shredded cheddar cheese.  I also cut back a bit on the butter.  I went heavy on the milk because so many reviews said dryness was a problem, but I ended up with the opposite prob-too much liquid!  About 3/4 way through cooking time and it was still like soup.  I poured off quite a bit and that fixed the prob.  It took about an hour & 1/2 before it was completely done. It had just the right flavor I was looking for to accompany our ham Christmas dinner though and will definitely make it again, tho I think I'll try it in the crockpot next time!

Very good - nice and cheesy!  We had to use a very large baking dish to hold ours, and we used real cheddar cheese (mild).  I'd probably add a bit more onion myself as we enjoy onion in our cooking.

I decided to try this recipe because I needed a potato side dish to accompany steak and had all the ingredients on hand. This dish was very tasty and held up good even when reheated.  I did cut the butter amount in half.

This is a good "jumping off point" type recipe. Always good to have for the basic quantities, time and temp. The rest can be what you have on hand - for us, better with some chopped up left over bacon sprinkled on top near the end. Not (5) stars as is for my family. Too bland for our tastes but a good base. The "most helpful" review is really that. It's much better with the addition of the soup and no processed cheese loaf.

I absolutely LOVED these and so did my husband. I used less butter and instead of using all velveeta I added shredded mild cheddar and co-jack as well.  I really liked the flavor of all the cheeses.  This one is a keeper.

I hate when people completely change the recipe in their reviews, which I'm not trying to do, but I did add bacon pieces, green onions, and garlic powder to this recipe.  Turned out great and I'm now the official potato casserole maker for family gatherings!

These had good flavor, but the sauce was incredibly greasy and liquidy.  I may have added a little too much milk, but I halved the amount of butter, and added some flour to the milk before adding it so I'm not sure what went wrong.  I will make it again but definitely need to tweak the sauce.  Overall, very easy to make.

We all love this recipe. I have made it twice now and it was awesome. I mix everthing together in the beginning and stir well then put in oven to save on prep time. Great way to get kids to eat potatoes. I used shredded cheddar one time anm Colby Jack another. Does seperate a little but still just as good.

These were so good!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using none of the butter and they turned out perfect!  I did use a larger baking dish so I had room to stir the potatoes during cooking.  I'll definitely make these again.

Awesome!  I halfed the butter and didn't set aside any cheese.  I used half Velvetta and half Pepper Jack and it gave the potatoes a little kick. I made sure to stir it every 20 minutes.  Definately a favorite.

Attention low carb dieters!  I did this recipe with cauliflower instead of potatoes, and it was muy delicioso!  I took the advise of others and cut the butter in half, I also used a combination of co/jack cheese and pepper jack: spicy and yummy. I would recommend cutting down the milk, as the veggies have water in them that releases as cooked.  You could cook the  in advance and drain them...

The onions gave the dish a very nice flavor but I'd use a different cheese next time, maybe mild cheddar.

My family enjoyed this version of scalloped potatoes.  I used a few extra potatoes and a touch more milk and baked it 15 minutes longer. It was really good.  Next time I'm going to try a variety of cheeses and maybe some garlic.  Thanks Holly - from my kids.

My husband said these were the best potatoes he ever had, I thought the were ok. The cheese was all chucky and it did not look very good.If any one has any thoughts on how to get the cheese creamy and not chucky it would be great to know.

I tried this first, exactly as written, and it had a few flaws that we couldn't accept.  The potatoes did not all cook through with these times and temps (and I did use a uniform slicer so they would be evenly thick), making some unpleasantly tough or mildly crisp.  As far as cheese, I'm fine with Velveeta but not okay with tons of fat floating in the pan.  There was simply too much butter and it would have benefitted from a less "greasy" type of cheese.  The clotting effect of the cheese (which does show in the picture) was unappetizing in appearance, and the floating grease just confirmed it was something I would not want to serve any guests.  I made a second version where I increased the onion, used a mixture of different cheeses, decreased the butter to half of what was called for and covered the dish tightly for the first cooking period, then left it open for the last.  I got a decent dish that was rich and less questionable in appearance.  I think the recipe is lovely as far as being easy to prepare but I do think it needs to be altered to individual tastes.  What comes out of the pan is not exactly what was expected.

3* per your recipe, these tips in our family make it a 5*! This is very close to how my mother (as I do w/ a couple tweaks - sorry mom lol) made scalloped potatoes (technically Au Gratin?) and takes the appearance issue away. As another reviewer stated, there are many things I cook that are by eye so I apologize no measurements. 1st, we generally used a 9x13 pan or a lasagna size pan lightly greased or buttered, being spread out negates having to stir it to ensure potatoes are cooked through. Place on a cookie sheet 350 45 mins may require foil if top browns. Using a deeper casserole dish still doesn't require stirring just lengthier cooking time, generally 1 1/2 hrs. We also use 1-2 bags of frozen sweet or petite corn depending on how much we're making, leftovers are always a must! Start w/ layer of potatoes, each layer is then seasoned (personally S&P, garlic or garlic powder, light dusting of flour, dots of butter, grated cheese (personally Colby and/or Cheddar) we love it so cheese layer is until potato layer isn't seen, sprinkle frozen corn around & start over with potato layer. End with a potato layer, seasoned & layer of cheese. I usually use a glass dish so I can see while adding evaporated milk a smidge to 1/2 way mark

This is how I make scalloped potatoes too except I add crushed Town House Crackers to the mix...........very yummy. Have made these for years and my family loves them!!! Only down side is that you do have to use a big baking dish and leave a good 1 1/2 - 2 inches of room at the top so they don't cook-over. However, my family always says the best batches are the one that do cook-over:)

I was looking for a potato recipe using velveeta and this is what I decided to try.  I opted to melt the butter, added a couple of Tbs of flour to thicken, then add the milk and cheese.  Then I just poured it over the potatoes and onions and baked.  For some reason the sauce separated.  It still tasted good, but it was a little globby.  Maybe this was because I switched the cooking method...?? Anyway, my only other comment is there seemed to be a ton of butter, no matter how you choose to cook it.  I bet I could have halved it and it still would have tasted great.  I'll keep playing with it...

My husband loved these.  I changed a few things:  used mozz. cheese because that's what I had and didn't use the milk, added a couple splashes of half and half instead.  Will have again, might even try layering ham next time.

This was awesome!  I left it in too long and it got crispy on the top, but that made it even better!

Good dish.  Cheddar cheese does not melt well.  I'll stick to the original recipe next time. Thanks Holly.

Everyone loved these potatoes.  I did use a little less butter as suggested by other reviews and I divided the cheese into to different kinds - 1/2 Velveeta, 1/2 CoJack.  They were good.

Excellent recipe. I added a little garlic and a block of sharp cheese. It is an easy, wonderful recipe that I will use again.

YUMMMMMM! This was great but a pain to make. Maybe it will get faster with practice, but the outcome was well worth it. I have to add at least an extra 30-40 minutes for my potatoes to come out right.

They were very good, however, they were very runny. I had to mix some flour in milk and it to thicken things up a little bit.

OH MY GOODNESS! This dish is really good, my whole family loved it. I added 1/2 a cup extra sharp cheddar for an extra bit. The left overs were even better the next day for lunch.

Really good, although my family found that the sauce was too runny.  We would make this recipe again that's for sure

This recipe is delicious.  It is a favorite of my family.  The sauce is really good and not to thick.  I will be making it often.
