This is a great recipe for making tasty burgers in a hurry. I used 'seasoned' bread crumbs which I would not recommend since it made the burgers a bit too salty.

I USED LESS SOUP MIX AND INSTEAD OF HOT PEPPER SAUCE I USED A TABLESPOON OF WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE. VERY JUICY BURGERS.

The onion soup mix adds a nice kick.  However, I think that I will go back to using eggs rather than water.  I found they fell apart much easier without.

These were ok. I didn't like the texture I am not a big fan of breadcrumbs in a hamburger. My husband liked them but he is a hamburger fanatic. Personally I would not add the breadcrumbs.

I made these in the oven (450 for 20-25 minutes, turning halfway through).  Turned out great!  Served on onion rolls.  Mmmm.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are great hamburgers.  I get nothing but excellent reviews when I make them.  Instead of hickory chips I just add a teaspoon hickory sauce and it gives the burgers that little extra flavor. Easy to make also

I made these burgers for a nascar party that my husband had, and all the guys just loved them.  Thank you so much that's all they could talk about all night.  Even my three year old son loved them, and he doesn't like anything.

These were pretty good.  I cut the recipe in half and didn't add water or bread crumbs.  I opted for worchestershire, minced garlic, and a little more Frank's Red Hot.  This gave it a nice kick.

Wonderful burgers! Not sure where the complaints came from that I read but I guess that just goes to show that not everyone has the same taste buds. Try them once at the very least. I made no changes other than adding a tsp of Worsterchire. Give it a whirl!

I have been using this recipe with hamburger for as long as i could cook!  I would recommend using a egg instead of water, as it helps the meat stick together.  Also, I like to add sauces to the mix to give it a moist flavor. ketchup, mustard, bbq sauce, A1, worcheshire (sp?); any of these help maintain a great juicy flavor.

I thought they lacked flavor, but my husband and the couple we had over thought they were really good.  Maybe it's just me...

Hubby said he wanted burgers tonight for supper.  I've seen this recipe before, and wanted to make it.  It was delicious!  I'm not big on burgers, but when we had this tonight, it was awesome!!  Hubby said to cut back on the bread crumbs a bit, but I said it was perfect the way it is.  Thanks!

Outstanding! I have probably made these 20 times now and they never get old. For the hot pepper sauce, I usually use Cholula Original which gives them a little kick and a great flavor. Thanks for the recipe!!!

These burgers were quick and easy to make, very juicy, but we didn't care for the taste as much as just a plain burger.  They tasted like meatloaf burgers.

These turned out great.  I prefer using water rather than egg.  They were very juicy and did not fall apart on the BBQ.
