I have just made something like these, I made a few changes to what I had, so it wouldnt be fair for me to say I have made this exact recipe. I used flour tortillas, almost a whole pack of cream cheese, maybe 1/2 pack of taco seasoning, I threw in some taco blend shredded cheese, came out good, just seemed a bit salty from the taco seasoning, but i also didnt use a full pack of cream cheese either, if i had then it may have not been to salty, my fault..i used picante sauce for dipping..It was good, jalepenos are a good idea but i didnt put any on since the kids were eating it too, Thanks for the recipe.

I added a few less jalapenos and also about 1/4 c. shredded cheddar cheese. I also increased the olives. Still I will rate this recipe high even though I made some changes because the basic flavors are just super! Oh yes, I also used sundried tomato tortillas which made a more festive appearance and melded well with the flavors in the spread.

I mixed the jalapenos and black olives in with the cream cheese mixture and it worked really well. Next time I will use flour tortillas, about 1/4 of the jalapenos (they were way too spicy for my taste!) and maybe add a little shredded cheese.

My friends request I make these all the time!  But I use flour tortillas instead of corn.  Sometimes I serve with a side of salsa for dipping.

ICK!! Easy enough to make, but had a weird flavor. Too hot and too strong tasting. I had some friends over, we tasted them then threw the batch out. Blah! Would not make again.

Maybe it was the corn tortillas? My tortillas were thick and were hard to roll up and I couldn't even take a bite. I make a similar item using flour tortilla so I have to say I think that was the main problem. They weren't ate up, I even later tried to warm them up and put enchilada sauce on them as they have similar ingredients as my enchiladas, it didn't save them. I won't keep this one.

These are good but I do not put the jalapenos in them.  Too spicy for me but I do use a whole package of taco seasoning for one container of cream cheese.  Otherwise they are a little too bland.  My kids love these & they are quick & easy!  I use low fat cream chz, just bring it to room temp.  Thanks Melody!

The corn tortillas just don't wrap well, they break and spring apart.  I would suggest flour tortillas.  The flavor of the dip itself is fine.
