We decided to have a pasta night with a variety of sauces.  Our favorite restaurant has a vodka sauce that we wished to replicate. What a find this recipe proved to be.  I did use six cloves of garlic as opposed to 2, but other than that, I changed nothing. We enjoyed it so much, we plan to make several batches this weekend to can for future use.

Pretty good sauce!  My friend requested vodka sauce for her bday & I was bored with my old recipe.  I doubled this recipe & only made a few minor additions.  When cooking my garlic & onions I added in a few handfuls of pancetta.  Also, added 2 bay leaves, some basil and extra garlic.  The sauce was left to simmer for 2.5 hours & came out with a nice, tangy flavor.  It tasted great, but it really didn't taste like the vodka sauce I usually make & I think some were disappointed a bit.  However, it was good & worth trying...  :)

Excellent. I was trying to match a local restaurant's recipe so I added zucchini & prosciutto. If you add prosciutto, then I recommend decreasing the added salt.

I am so impressed with this recipe!  It was simple and delicious!  I have frozen the leftover sauce (without the cream added) and reheated it with great success.  Just add the cream to the sauce when reheating.  I've served with cooked Italian sausage and with chicken.  This sauce is versatile and a great, quick meal during a busy week (when reheated from frozen).

This is for people who can't handle black pepper.  I use dried basil in place of the pepper.  Comes out great.  Everybody in my house loves it.
