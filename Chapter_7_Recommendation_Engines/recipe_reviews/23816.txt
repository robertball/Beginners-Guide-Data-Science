I, too, double the yeast and use melted butter instead of shortening. I have found that using butter not only improves the flavor, but it also eliminates the need to butter the crusts altogether. I also don't bother with the pan of water. No need! It is wonderful without the fuss!! The milk, butter, and honey give the bread the depth of flavor that we were looking for. The texture is perfect, and I love that it makes two 9x5 inch loaves. To make wheat bread, I just substitute whole wheat flour for the first 2 cups of bread flour. I can't believe that this recipe isn't more highly rated!!

Ever since I decided to make my own bread by hand instead of buying the mediocre loaves at the grocery store, I've been in search of the perfect white bread recipe. Well, I found it a month or two ago in this. This bread has everything I want in a loaf -- the flavor is there, it really is tender and creamy enough you can eat it plain, and yet it holds together well enough for sandwiches and for scooping up gravies and sauces. You really do get the best of all worlds with this recipe. However, I recommend using a bread flour instead of all-purpose flour. I have found that all homemade loaves really benefit in texture immensley. The only other thing I eventually changed was using melted butter instead of shortening -- one time I had run out of shortening and didn't notice until it was too late, so I had to substitute. The butter tastes very, very good in this loaf! The texture isn't exactly the same, but the difference is very minor and I actually like it better. This is a keeper! Thanks, Kristin.

Love it, love it, love it!!!!!

I am a novice (with a capital N) baker, but I have made this several times and it always turns out great.  As Kristin has said, it's creamy and rich.  Actually, it's a little too good, because we're consuming a lot more bread than we usually do!!!  :-)

YOUR SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT BREAD RECIPE CAN END RIGHT HERE!  I followed this recipe EXACTLY.  I've eaten some wonderful homemade bread in my life, especially since we don't live that far from Ohio's Amish Country.  This bread blows every other out of the water!  It is so unbelievably good.  Not doughy, but nice and soft inside with a nice crust.  It makes great rolls, too!  I'm going to add a little more sugar and use it for cinnamon rolls.  I'll probably never buy bread from the store again!
Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! :)

I think I am only the second person who did not like this recipe. It was very heavy and had an unpleasing taste. I will not make this bread again.

Wonderful soft sandwich bread. I made half of the recipe in my bread machine. I put it through the dough cycle and shaped it into a long loaf and it turned out great. Thank You Kristin for responding to my request for the "Subway sandwich" type of bread.  It was just what I was looking for.

Made this yesterday except I reduced the salt by 1/2 tsp and doubled the yeast (both recommended tips here, thank you). Don't like shortening, used melted butter. 1/2 dough as is; the other I spread cinnamon and butter (forgot the sugar part, yikes) before rolling up tight and into the pan. Family loved both and had them straight from the oven with butter, and camembert. Made cheese toasts (plain loaf,thickly sliced) served with corned beef hash for breakfast ... mmm. Quite dense if not for the increased yeast, but that's ok too, if you like dense bread. Good basic bread, with lots of possibilities. Thanks Kristin.

I found this recipe to yield a bread that was too salty, too sweet and not a very pleasant flavor or texture. It was easy to make with not too many steps.

This is the best bread I have ever made. I have a bread maker that has been sitting in the closet for years because I could never get good bread out of it. This is the first recipe I tried from this site and it turned out perfect. The more I make it the better it gets and the neighbors won't stop asking for loaves. It was because of this bread recipe that I finally got my wife to get me a Kitchenaid mixer for my birthday!

I make this every week- it's beautiful sandwich bread for the week's lunches.  I used melted butter instead of shortening and don't add any additonal butter after cooking, nor do I put a pan of water in the oven.  I heat my oven to about 200 degrees and then turn it off while I put the ingredients together- then I do the initial rising in my oven- nice warm, draft free spot for rising!  I have non-stick pans, so I don't use any more butter or shortening for this step either.  This is a beautiful, easy, no fail recipe!  Thank you for sharing this!

I MADE BREAD! I have been trying to make successful yeast bread for 17 years with no luck at all. With this recipe, it worked. Two big poofy loaves, like magic! And the taste, oh my, HEAVENLY. It was so decadent with dinner. Wonderful!

I fixed this bread while cleaning the garage. It didn't last long after I finished and got great reviews from the few select people who were allowed to share. Everyone asked me where I got the recipe. I lied and said it had been passed down from father to son for generations and wouldn't tell them how to make it.

I have tried many different white bread recipes; this is by far the best. I took the suggestion made in a few reviews to decrease the salt by 1/2 tsp, double the yeast, and use butter instead of shortening. Perfect.

It is simple to make and tastes like a loaf of yeast rolls. Just irresistable. Great with home made chicken salad.

I made two loaves this morning.  My said that it was the best bread she has ever eaten.  One of the loaves is already gone as I write this tonight.  The bread is creamy, sweet, and has a nice texture.  This recipe is won-der-ful!

WOW!  And I thought baking fresh bread at home was out of my reach.  I followed the recipe exactly, though I only had one bread pan, so I broke up the second loaf into 6 smaller pieces and put them into a 6-cup jumbo muffin pan.  This bread is soft and chewy and absolutely delicious!  You CAN do it!

I love this recipe. I just made it for the second time and I did change one thing. Instead of one package of yeast, I used two. It raised much nicer than the first time. It really is a great bread recipe. Joyln B.

I made it according to the recipe, EXCEPT that after the first 2 cups of flour I stop measuring. I use an electric mixer with kneading hooks. I slowly add flour until the dough starts to cleanly lift from the sides and starts to on the bottom. The dough is very sticky at first, but after the first rise you can handle it with a little care. So I end up using less flour but the loaf is light and very nice. I also don't use the pan of water in the oven because it doesn't need it.  I also used melted butter instead of shortening. Really a great everyday bread recipe.
I recommend that people check out videos on youtube on how to form loaves.

For months now i have been trying new recipes because we are gluten-free and i hate the bread in the packs, they taste like sandpaper. so i have been working on recipe after recipe with no luck of liking them. well i will look no further. yours is perfect with a few minor adjustments, such as just a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar rice/potato flour and doubling the yeast. i love this recipe thank you so much. its almost like i have tasted real bread again.

This bread is fantastic.  I did have a little trouble with it rising at first, then followed the directions of putting it in the oven with a bowl of warm water underneath and gave it another hour to rise.  It came out awesome.  I also only had all-purpose flour on hand, but it came out really great.  The texture was soft, creamy and spongy just like store bought white bread.  Next time I will use the recommendations here and double the yeast.  I also want to try it with some whole wheat flour for wheat bread.  Thanks!

This is the softest bread I've ever baked.  I also doubled the yeast and used butter instead of shortening.  It tastes similar to a croissant.  I still brushed the loaves with butter and put a dish of water in the oven.  Delish!

This bread recipe was another big step for me in making a more complicated recipe with yeast. It had more steps but really wasn't all that difficult, I came to discover. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer from the beginning, proofing my yeast in the bowl then using my hook to combine everything. I love having my Kitchen Aid,
really cuts down on the kneading called for. 

I did have an issue with this bread rising. I followed the instructions directly and still struggled. I set the
bread on a warm oven and covered the
bowl with saran wrap and a towel and it
didn't rise much. It baked up fine, so I guess it didn't matter all that much. I didn't bother with the water bowl in the oven because I only have one rack. Didn't seem to matter with my bread, still came out great.

Texture and taste-wise, I'm on the fence.
I am going to use it for the Garlic 
Bread Fantastique tonight and let the 
family tell me what they think. I think
this might be good for french toast tomorrow.

Very nice texture even in the bread machine. I halved the original recipe. Here's how I adapted it for my machine: omitted sugar, combined all liquids, honey & oil (instead of shortening) & poured that into machine. Combined flour & salt,then put that on top of liquids. Finally poured 1 whole pkg yeast into one corner of flour. Turned machine on & 3.5 hours later I had a beautifully golden, tender loaf of bread. This is a keeper!

i have tried this bread recipe and my family loved it. We even started eating it just to eat it so I had to stop making it for a while. But this bread is the BOMB! excuse the slang but I couldn't find a better word.  Thanks for the pleasure.

Am I the only one who doesn't like this bread?  It was much too crumbly and the taste was only so-so.  Not good for sandwiches, toast, or anything.  And it has an almost twice the calories as regular white bread.  Will not make again.

I've made this recipe several times and each time it's come out a little different, but still delicious. I think I've finally gotten it perfect with very minor adjustments- use two cups less flour than the recipe calls for (because of my large family I always double or triple it) and let rise on top of a warm stove. I had no rising problems, and using the pan of water is something I'd definitely recommend, because it creates a softer, flakier crust. I also use melted butter instead of shortening, and the flavor is amazing for just about everything.

Without a doubt, the best white bread recipe ever.  I made one change to it and used butter instead of shortening. I had searched for years for a good white bread recipe, that wasn't too airy and didn't taste like paste.  This bread has an awesome flavor to it! I made it for the first time and everyone loved it. My daughter's boyfriend wants the recipe. He says it's the best white bread, far better then what you get at the store. I agree.

I have made this recipe several times now and taught it to my daughter over Easter weekend.  We love this bread!  I follow the recipe with the exception that I use butter-flavored shortening since it is the only shortening I keep in my pantry.

I rolled this dough into dinner rolls. They barely made it to dinner. My family loved them. They turned out light and sweet.

I have heard so many good things about this recipe I am going to try my hand at it. I have a convection oven so that eliminates the need for a pan of water and a proof setting on my oven also for rising dough. I may take advantage of others suggestions and use butter instead of shortening. Wish me luck, I'm not a yeast user so this should be interesting. I will post a review once its done.

this is a lovely white bread.  Easy to throw together, the honey will keep it moist, as honey has a tendency to pull moisture from the air. Light and tender, nice crumb.  The only reason for 4 stars is I think it could have used 1/2 tsp more salt.  baking temp and times listed were perfect.  I didn't bother with the moist heat in the oven, or eggwash.  I prefer white bread without the crisp crust.  Brushed some melted butter over the tops after taking out of the oven.  thanks for this nice recipe.

I made this and it looked and smelled wonderful!!  The taste is ...okay...it makes fantastic toast or for a side of bread for dinner but as sandwich bread it is a little too dense. My 4yr old LOVES it, he will eat the bread with nothing on it. I made it with bread flour instead of all purpose, maybe that is why it is so dense. Next time I am going to half it & use all purpose flour.

What a great white bread recipe!  I was out of honey so I used corn syrup, and it came out so good.  I divided the dough in half, part of the dough I used loaf of bread, and the other part I divided up into dinner rolls.  The dinner rolls I liked even better than the bread!

This bread is awesome! So moist and tender. My family raved about it and they are very picky. My son, who is 25, says we should never buy store-bought bread again! We used it for turkey sandwiches the day after Christmas...Wonderful.

This bread tastes great, allthough I've never actually followed the recipe perfectly- I think the fact that it still came out good makes it a good recipe.  If you want my opinion use a little more yeast and do half whole weat flower/half unbleached.

I've been making this recipe for a while now and have finally gotten around to reviewing it.  This was my first non-bread machine recipe and I felt like a genius after making it! This recipe makes really good white bread with flavour!  I have also made this into a garlic and cheese loaf, as well as onion buns.  This is the only white bread recipe I use.

I made this recipe because the reviews on it were great. I made it EXACTLY as the recipe and it turned out delicious (I used the pan of water and everything- no hassle at all!). My family (4 of us) ate both loaves in two days! Goes with absolutely anything-sandwiches or plain and pair with coffee. I am making it right now for the second time and will be using double the yeast and butter as some recommended here.

Don't be to hastey to double the yeast - try doubling the resting times.  Yes I would have liked a little taller loaf but the flavor this way is very good.  I used shortening but agree butter would be much better (isn't it always????).  All in all this is an excellent recipe just remember to double the resting period.

Great bread recipe, much easier than traditional recipes in which you start by scalding milk. Evaporated milk keeps the bread soft. One change I make is that I warm the evaporated milk, honey, salt, second part water, and butter (instead of shortening) in a saucepan, stir, and then let these ingredients cool before incorporating proofed yeast solution. As others have said, I halve the amount of salt. I also use unbleached bread flour.
This bread stays fresh longer than other breads I have made, probably because of the preservative quality of the honey.
I use a Kitchenaid stand mixer for the initial mixture and some of the kneading, and finish kneading by hand.

This was far too sweet and flimsy to be considered a good versatile bread in my opinion. It did not hold together very well, and crumbled quickly. If you have a very sweet tooth and don't mind it falling apart this could be what you are looking for. If you are looking for a savory white loaf, this is not it. Two stars are for being true to it's "tender and creamy" claim.

Pretty good; I like that it makes 2 loaves.  I didn't bother with the water and it still came out fine.  I like the texture -  I do enjoy some of the other bread recipes I've tried better, though.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This bread was wonderful!  It came out beautifully.  It is a bit dense, so I'm not sure how great it would be for sandwiches, but that's just my opinion.  Others may love it as a sandwich bread. It is, however, the perfect bread for making french toast.  It doesn't dry out like some breads can, and holds the flavor well.  All in all, this bread was tasty, easy make, and a hit with my husband and kids, so its a winner!

This is the best bread ever.  I have been trying several differnet bread recipes for our family to use and this is it.  It has easy to follow directions and the bread turned out so tasty!!  The crust was crispy and flaky  and the texture was unbelivable!!! My husband loved it too.  We had a hard time not eating it all gone!  This is our all time favorite bread recipe!!!

My family loved this recipe.  I just threw everything in the bread machine and it came out perfect.  I actually had to stop my older son from eating more bread because he filled up on the bread and not his supper.  Unfortunately the dogs really liked the bread also.  :0)  I halved the recipe.  Thanks

This was my first time making bread from scratch. This recipe makes the best bread my family and I have ever tasted. I also used butter in place of the shortening. My husband requests this bread at least twice a week.

This was my first attempt at baking bread and a good debut it was!  This is a great recipe--the taste was absolutely fantastic, but I apparently still have a little to learn about baking bread.  There was a hole the size of a large cigar on the inside of the first loaf I sliced (we haven't eaten the second one yet), and the middle pieces were slightly soggy.  My wife told me she actually likes bread baked in that "style," but it appeared to me that it just wasn't all the way "done," even though the top was golden brown.  I served it with butter as a side with the BBQ and coleslaw we had for supper.  A winner, but I've got to do some tweaking!

This bread was amazingly good!  Great by itself or for sandwiches.  Anyone who did not like this bread made it wrong. 

 Mine came out light, fluffy and perfect with a consistency like expensive store white bread and more flavor.

With the addition of a little Cinnamon butter and sugar and cream cheese frosting, this makes some amazing "Cinnabon" bread as my son calls it.  I whip butter, sugar, cream cheese frosting and cinnamon together brush it onto the rolled out dough, rill it up and let it rise 30 min and bake it.  I then brush more frosting and cinnamon onto the top when in comes out of the oven.  1 loaf is lucky to last long enough to cool.  Really really good.  
If you try to half the recipe, remember that the quantities change in the ingredients list but not in the written directions.  I made this mistake and ended up making the full recipe to correct the problem. This is prompted me to try making a cinnamon bread.

This is the greatest bread that I've ever eaten!  Do yourself a favor and make this recipe, it's worth all of the work.  I usually make 3 smaller loafs in 3.5'' x 9''pans for about 35-40 minutes and it bakes beautifully.

In one word: FANTASTIC!!  My family and I just loved this bread and ate it right up - I will defiantly make it again!  It was moist and very tender with a lovely hint of sweetness from the honey.  The only problem that I had with the recipe itself was that it really should call for about six cups of flour instead of five - other than that - it was a breeze to mix and knead (I used the dough hooks on my mixmaster).  Well worth the effort!:-)

This recipe is my favorite! My family begs me to make it! It has a creamy taste, The best bread I've ever tasted! It makes two loaves and it won't last a day! My family loves it and I do too! The problem for me is If I baked it every day I'd be big as a house! Because I can't stop eating it!  : - )

This is a great sandwich bread!  It’s perfect to replace anything you’ve been buying at the store.  It’s light fluffy and moist but structurally safe to put anything on it without fear of tearing through the bread.

Thank you Kristin for sharing such an amazing recipe!  I followed the recipe as instructed except for the doubled yeast as suggested by other reviewers and I have to say, I was blown away. Coming from someone who’s very new to baking, this was foolproof.

This  makes a very nice white bread.  I have made it as written and I have halved it to make only one loaf.  It turns out well either way.  I also used a kitchen aid for kneeding and it worked well.  I loved the smell of fresh bread.

The recipe is very good. And I think I figured out why some people complain about thick dough. 
There are 2 kinds of condensed milk: regular and sweetened. The sweetened one is much thicker! And if you wont to use it, you got to add 1 cup of water, otherwise the dough will be very overdried. It will be sweet bread, very tasty too.
But I got to tell you that on the post-USSR territories condensed milk is always sweetened, you have too search for unsweetened one. 
I doubled the yeast, divided it into 2 loaves, let it rise for an hour and baked it for 25 minutes at 375F, next time I'll bake it for 20 minutes or maby at 350F, it came a bit too dark for my taste. But the bread is absolutely delicious.

I liked the taste very much.  I did use the 2,   9 X 5 loaf pans, and the bread did not raise above the edges as much as I would have liked.  I did adjust 2nd rise time to 60 minutes to compensate, but may have to adjust ingredients also.

Great recipe I followed the recipe exactly best I've made in a while. For those who used more yeast I found it to have a little yeasty flavor when I did that. 
Just remember making bread is a formula not a recipe

Perfect!!!! I used my kitchen aid with mixing attachment for the first mixture, then changed to the dough hook as I added the bread flour. Took it out and completed kneading process by hand about 6-7 mins. Followed recipe except 1/4 tsp less salt and added 1 more packet yeast to water. Crust was nice and crunchy firm, inside was soft and springy to the touch ( but not too springy).  It passed my test (as a FIRST TIME BREAD BAKER), my hubby's, he loved it. But now for the room temperature,  cooled down, how does it hold up for sandwiches and maybe even French toast test? I'll Update later. Thank you for the detailed recipe. I'm no longer hesitant about baking breads. The taste was perfect. Not one ingredient over powering another. Ie, honey or yeast, etc. mahalo again.

I used 80g of butter, instead of shortening + butter. I bake for 30 minutes, the middle of the loaf is still wet, so I baked for 1 hour at the same temperature. However, it is a bit 'sticky to my tooth', I wonder if the stickiness is caused by butter? Maybe I should replace butter with olive oil? .

Made as directed and it's some of the best white bread I have ever had, and my family agrees.

I haven't baked bread in years, but thought I'd try this one.  It's so yummy.  My 2 little boys devoured it and my dh was speechless.  We ate a whole loaf right out of the oven.  I'll be making this one again.

This bread turned out beautiful and delicious. It did have a strange texture to it. It did not have the feel of loaf bread really and it crumbled. But I would recommend it for a dinner bread, etc. Great recipe!

I used to make bread when my children were small, but the results were not consistently successful.  This recipe is virtually fool-proof, and when my daughter is home from college, I can't keep enough of it on hand!  I use two packages of yeast, and, with my stand mixer, this couldn't be easier.  Rises wonderfully, and is very tasty!

This one earned the blue ribbon! I made 2 loaves a few days befor thanksgiving, my first time ever making bread by hand, and it came out ok, but I made it again the night before thanksgiving for the feast the next day and it was all I could do not to eat a whole loaf myself! I found it was all in the way i mixed the dough and added ingrediants when it was still mostly liquid and was adding the flour, and also adding just a little more honey to give it a sweet touch. I give it 10 stars, a sure hit!

I used this recipe for fried bread and my seven year old son
ate three pieces and his dinner!!!  My neighbors were
shouting "we're not w o r t h y!"  I liked this recipe it was
allot easier to use than my old recipe.

This recipe is great!  I've made it three times and my family loves it.  Sometimes, I make cinnamon swirl bread by speading butter, cinnamon, and sugar on it then rolling it up.

This is the first bread I tried to make and it turned out very well.  Very creamy, just like the recipe says.  But, it occurred to me that it never mentions when to add the sugar listed in the ingredients list.  But, the absence didn't seem to make much of a difference.
