We made this recipe three times before "perfecting" it to our liking.  We substituted 2 tbsp of reduced sodium soy sauce for the Green Mountain seasoning and cut the curry paste in half.  We then expanded the stir-fry to include beef, zucchini, baby corn, red peppers and water chestnuts.  Now we are arguing over which of us gets to have the leftovers for lunch.  :o)

Very good! I've been looking for a recipe to mock a Thai Avocado Curry we have in San Diego at a Thai restaurant, since we moved to Jacksonville, and this is close to it. I used chicken,. Next time I'll double the amount of sauce though, sauce is the best part of curry! Atop of jasmine rice - YUM. Thank you for the recipe!
