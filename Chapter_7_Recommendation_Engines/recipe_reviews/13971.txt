Really enjoyed these ... a great change from meatballs - my family enjoyed them too.  I also cooked the cheese balls in the oven to avoid deep-frying - 350 degrees for 30 min. was all that was needed.  I also placed them on parchment paper so I didn't have to grease the pan either.  I substituted my own spiced tomato sauce but next time I'll try the one on the recipe.  Thanks Debbie!

This is similar to the Italian Cheese Ball recipe I stole from Kettering Medical Center (Kettering, Ohio) in 1980 - only they called for ground walnuts, instead of pecans. I think thre's more flavor with walnuts. 
Strict carnivores I know don't care for this recipe, and my kids hated it. I love this recipe, however, and so do all my veggie friends. 
NB: I avoid all frying, so I brown the cheese balls in the oven first - 40 min at 350Â°F. It makes for a lot of oven time, but cuts way down on the fat intake.

These are excellent!  I am a vegetarian and couldn't ask for a more perfect snack or appetizer for a meal.  They are absolutely delicious!  I accidentally left out the pecans in the first time around and they were still great!  I am making them again, being sure that I remember the pecans this time!   
A++++++ (I hardly ever give five stars)

The cheeseballs themselves were fabulous.  I left a lot of chunks in the pecans and they made for a wonderful texture.  Next time, though, I will pass on the sauce.  It tasted a bit too much like spaghetti-o sauce.

These are so delicious!  I've made them for lots of people, with great results.  I use a carton of roasted red pepper soup for the sauce, leave out the cumin.  Yumm

I agree with JFOURNIER, these are similar to KMC's Italian Nut Balls. It is a really versatile meatball.  I use pecan meal, instead of chopped pecans, and only 3/4 c bread crumbs. I bake mine for 15 minutes at 350, then cover with store bought or homemade marinara sauce, mushroom gravy, sweet and sour glaze, etc. I bake the sauce covered meatball for 30 minutes at 325. They are wonderful!  These make great breakfast patties, if you use an ice-cream scoop to scoop them out onto a baking sheet. Then flatten to 1/2 inch thickness. Bake at 325 for 30 minutes. Cool, then package 3-4 patties in a zip-lock bag. Nuke about 30 seconds, and they are ready to eat!

This was a good meal and we will probably make it again.  Next time I might just press it in the bottom of the pan instead of taking the time to make balls of it just to make it easier.  I also prebaked it instead of frying it to make it easier as well.  With those changes it can be an easy weeknight meal!

these were messy and tasted really strange.  maybe the pecans weren't processed fully or something.  i ended up with a pan full of oily nut mess.

Basically vegetarian meatballs - my husband loved them but they were a lot of work I felt like.

Very interesting flavor, but a little dry (especially if they've been sitting out at a party for a couple hours).  I would probably recommend adding more cheese.
