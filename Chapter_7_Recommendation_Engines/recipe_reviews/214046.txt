This is a good basic casserole.  What I like about it is that you can adjust it and come up with awesome results.  I used cream of mushroom soup and like to add spinach if I have it on hand.  I also use sharp cheddar cheese because I like it better than swiss.  I sautee the onions and add garlic.  In addition, at the end of cooking time, I brown seasoned bread crumbs in butter and put it on top of the casserole after it finished baking.  Yum, yum yum.  I do cover the casserole to prevent it from drying out.

This recipe is our new favorite casserole!  Followed the recipe exactly as is w/a little sprinkle of garlic as an extra and my family raved about it!  Perfect idea if you need to make a meal for a friend/neighbor as you can make it ahead of time.

This was excellent!  Not only is this a great way to use up leftover ham from Easter, I think it would taste great with leftover corned beef from St. Patty''s day.  I didnt add as much swiss cheese as it called for.  I prob only added 1 1/2 cups and I added a few Tbsps. of milk to the soup/sour cream mixture to thin it out a little.  Next time I will saute the onions because they still had a little crunch to them other than that this was sooooo good!  Thanks for the recipe!

My family isn't a big fan of swiss cheese, I used sharp instead. I also sauteed the onions in olive oil/butter until brown before adding them, they came out perfectly. I also added some of the starchy water after the noodles boiled to the mixture after reading the reviews that it came out too thick.  I added enough to make it 'stirable' but not soupy, if that makes sense. This came out great, it was a huge hit with the family!

Delicious, it does make alot, though. I halved it but still used the same amount of soup and sour cream. Also, I topped with a sleeve of Ritz crumbled in melted butter instead of bread crumbs. They absorb less moisture than bread and brown nicely.

We were trying to figure out what to do with our left over Easter ham and found this recipe.  I give it a 5 star as it is very delicious. I took a pic and posted it, sorry I dished up one plate before remembering to take photo. I also dont think I toasted the bread crumbs long enough,  but it was still very very good and my whole family enjoyed this meal including my 2-yr old daughter who is a picky eater (but what 2 yr old isnt?) This is a keeper, I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Thanks Kelli F. for sharing... as Rachel Ray says "Yummo.

I didn't expect much, but this was an excellent meal.  I made a couple of changes based on what I had in the house.  I added 2 cups sliced mushrooms & 1/2 cup heavy cream and used cream of mushroom soup.  I also eliminated the bread crumbs.  Great base recipe

Perfect and easy recipe for using leftover ham. Made some minor substitutions but I don't think it changed the flavor much. Used Cream of mushroom soup and chopped sliced mild provolone (what I had on hand) Next time I think I will add peas and I will love it even more. Tastes like a grown up mac n cheese.

I made this last night using leftover Easter ham.  It turned out pretty well.  I thought there was a little too much onion.  Also, the ham I had was brown sugar glazed so it was really sweet.  Next time I will try with a different ham.

I liked this recipe.  It took me a little longer to prepare because I had to shred my own Swiss cheese.  I also sauteed onions first along with chopped garlic in olive oil, it does taste like one yellow onion was a bit much.  I used cream of chicken soup, one can of evaporated milk and half a can of water...I didn't have sour cream on hand and the milk kept it moist.  I decided to let the casserole bake for only about 35 mins and I broiled it for about 5 more.  Broiling helped brown and melt the cheese on top.  It turned ot well but I like the suggestion of adding peas or some other green veggie as an extra something :)

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I found it to be rather dry, rather than creamy, even after adding a little milk to thin it out.  Maybe covering it the first 20 minutes would help. The flavor was rather bland.  It makes a lot, and should serve eight, rather than the six shown.

I give it  5 stars because it is so good, Maybe I should give it  4 1/2 but you can't. I did make a couple of minor changes only because of the ingredients I had in the house.  But,  I'm sure it is very good as printed.  I only had  1 1/2 cups of packaged  shredded Swiss cheese, but I had part of a package of Swiss Asiago mixture in the freezer and it was just enough to make two cups.  I also threw in about a cup of frozen peas.  I do feel the noodles were overcooked and would just cook them till almost done the next time I make it. And I will definitely make it again.  Oh... I forgot, I grabbed Cream of Mushroom off of the shelf  instead of Cream of Chicken soup and I had already  opened it, but it didn't ruin it. It is just my husband and myself so we are eating it for a couple of days.  I just finished a lunch with it and that is what inspired me to rate this.  There is still some left for tomorrow, if I don't raid the refrigerator before then. It gets better the second day.  Maybe I feel that way because our meal was interrupted  the night I made it . You gotta  make this one, but use leftover baked ham not stuff from the deli.

This was excellent.  Tweaked the recipe by substituting sharp cheddar instead of Swiss cheese...added sauteed celery and onion and some frozen peas (for color)...prepared mustard and a pinch of nutmeg (for zing) and a bit more milk.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks.

I would give this 4 and 1/2 stars if I could, it was that good. I made several changes other reviewers made, which really made it stand out. First, I sauteed half an onion (a whole onion would be too much) along with a some frozen peas before adding it in. I used cream of mushroom soup as it was all I had and then used cheddar cheese. Last I added a half a can of milk because it looked dry. I then skipped the crumbs and covered with foil, uncovering half way. It was so good, really a perfect casserole. With all the changes I think it really stands out.

I finally made this recipe last night and it turned out great! I thought it had great flavor and was very filling. One thing I had to change was that I used extra sharp new yorker cheddar cheese. That is what I had on hand. Sprinkled more cheese on top and mixed my bread crumbs with melted butter. Did not cover mine, made exactly as recipe said, came out excellent. Thank you for this great recipe. Was a little worried because of no extra liquid, but did not have a problem.

This was very tasty and a great way to use up holiday ham left in the freezer.  Next time I will add milk or some sort of liquid mine came out a little dry but still very tasty.

Kelli gave us a basic and good starting point with this casserole. As is, it needed to be highly seasoned so that I did with my usual garlic and onion powders along with parsley and a bit of dill. I felt it needed some milk to to make it a little creamier and more liquid so the onion could cook. What I love about this dish is that you can add just about anything to it to make it a more of a complete meal; broccoli, green beans, spinach, peas, mushrooms and so on. This is true comfort food and one we all enjoyed. Thank you Kelli!

Delicious and easy to substitute ingredients.  Probably needs more soup or more sour cream than called for.  Would have been too dry if made with one can of soup.

I didn't have an onion - substituted one packet of dry onion soup mix.  I only had about 1/3 Cup sour cream so I added a second can of soup.  It still seemed too dry so I added milk (about 3 tablespoons).  I used Cream of Mushroom soup.  I used two cups shredded cheddar.  Did not have dry bread crumbs.  Cut crusts off 4 slices of white bread, diced bread and lightly browned bread crumbs in melted butter.  Added diced garlic.  Baked uncovered for 50 minutes.  Makes a very full 2 quart casserole.  Will definitely make again.

This was fine for using up leftovers, but I don't think I would make it again. As a previous reviewer stated, the onions came out crunchy, so I would recommend sauteing them in butter or oil before mixing them into the rest of the ingredients.

This wasn't bad, but nobody said it was great either.  We all felt that the onions were way too raw (and I minced them really small!).  I think this would be much better if the onions were sauteed a bit in some butter and then added to the sauce.  I think that even if the onions were softer I'd probably skip making this again.

This turned out fabulous! I used regular macaroni noodles and marble cheddar cheese. I also left out the onions but topped it with french fried onions instead of bread crumbs. Delicious!

This was soooo very good, added garlic powder like others suggested other wise did the same.  I am not a fan of swiss cheese but this was truly great with it.

I used dehydrated chopped onions (because of my child), a heaping tablespoon of sour cream (because of my husband) and topped with some cheese (happened to have 1/2 cup monterey jack) and it was delicious. I used what I call a ham steak, which is an inexpensive round cut of ham sold in the grocery case.  It served four.

I was concerned that the dish would be a little plain...I was wrong.  :)  This is a very tasty meal that the husband loved as well.  The only change I made to the recipe was to cook the onions so that they wouldn't be so crunchy.

This is so good. I am always looking for recipes to use up ham. I loved the Swiss cheese combo. This is a good starter recipe to add various ideas to it. Frozen peas canned mushrooms will be added next time around.

Turned out amazing.  My son had 3 helpings and he hardly likes what I make!!!  Also used Brown Rice Pasta instead of traditional.  Was creamy and delicious.

This was really good. I did make some changes though, just to give it some more flavor, since I read that some reviewers thought it was on the bland side. I sauteed some onion, red, and orange peppers. I also added some red pepper flakes and used pepper jack cheese. I also added just a little milk to lighten it up a little - was on the thick side. I topped it with the breadcrumbs baked it and put a little grated pepper jack cheese over the top right when I pulled it out of the oven. With the changes I made it turned out to have a lot of flavor and both my husband and I went back for seconds :-) I think this is a really good basic recipe that you can add too to make it your own.

I loved this recipe and will make it again!  I made some minor changes.  I cooked the onions in a little butter to soften before adding into the casserole, also I added a can of drained peas (I would have used frozen, but I was out).  I used mostly swiss cheese, but added about 1/2 cup of cheddar in too.  I crushed Ritz crackers for the topping and drizzled 1/2 stick of melted butter on top before putting into the oven.  I served it with a salad and crescent rolls.  My family loved it!

This gets a high rating for being tasty and soooo easy to make. I use whole wheat egg noodles and low-fat or fat free sour cream, and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. I also use 2% mozzarella. Even with these healthy modifications, it is still really good!

This is quite tasty! I used whole grain noodles, cooked my onion in a tbsp of butter before adding. Also added peas! My entire family loved it.

This was a great base recipe as many said. I made a few changes after reading the reviews. I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken, sauteed the onions in olive oil (should have sauteed them longer since they came out a little crunchy for my preference) and then used Ritz as the topping instead of bread crumbs. My boyfriend had 2nd, then a midnight snack, and leftovers the next day so I know it was a hit. Will make again & maybe add a little more ham. Thank you for the recipe!!

This is wonderful receipe.  I did add a little milk to thin it out.  Also, my ham was already salty, so I did not add any salt.  But this was great.  I will make this again.

This was very 'heavy'.  Next time I will delete the cream of chicken soup and the onions.  I will add broccoli or another vegetable to bulk it up without making it too heavy.

Yummy!  I've made this a few times when bring a family a meal and they have all complimented it and asked for the recipe.  One quick note, I sauteed the onions in a bit of butter first to soften them a bit, just a personal preference.

We didn't really care for this, sorry.  I think it may have been that the swiss was too overpowering. I tried mixing in an extra can of cream of ___ and also about a cup of milk but it was still really thick and rich.  Maybe I'll try again but with no cheese, or cheddar just sprinkled on top.  Thanks for posting the recipe, though.  It's always fun to try something new!

Good, basic recipe. 
**Changes:
Sauteed 1/3 of an onion in butter, then added 2 garlic cloves and sauteed a minute or two more. We don't like onion to overpower....and love garlic (which we didn't even taste) Used macaroni noodles and threw about a cup of the 4 cups that I cooked; knowing it would have left the dish too dry (using 4 cups) Added 1/2 cup sharp cheddar, (1 1/2 c swiss per recipe) and about 1/2 cup peas (just our taste). 1/2 cup milk and Cream of Chicken soup- not mushroom. Used Italian bread crumbs mixed with melted butter and some fresh shredded parm--my go to! It was a quick, easy, tasty dish! ;)

This is a new favorite at our house. I made it as written, except I added additional (buttered) breadcrumbs to the top. This creamy, cheesy casserole is soothing comfort food at its best, and definitely a great use for leftover ham.

Wow - this was so good.  I didn't want to mess with onion so I just used some onion powder and I added about 1/2 cup of milk - Baked 20 minuted covered, then uncovered 20 minutes.  Delicious!

I only give it a 4 because I altered it a bit.  This is a great base recipe to start with! I omitted the onions (allergic!), added a can of corn, 1/4 cup milk (mixture was quite thick), 1/4 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, and used sharp cheddar instead of swiss. I also broiled an additional 2-3 minutes to get the bread crumbs a little more crunchy. This recipe would work with MANY substitutes as well: any pasta, any "cream of" soup, any cheese, add any vegetables or favorite seasonings.  You could pretty much use whatever you find in your fridge/cupboard!

This was amazing! I made it just as the recipe calls for except that i used mild and sharp cheddar cheese, just because thats what I had on hand, and added a little milk. After cooking it for 40 minutes my bread crumbs didnt brown, so i put it on broil for a minute or too. IT WAS A HIT! Definatly a keeper!

Awesome!! I had a few things that I had to change due to what I had on hand but I wouldn't make it any differently now! Instead of swiss cheese i had a bag of kraft italian 4 cheese with cream cheese that I used, I also added 1/2 pound of baby portabella mushrooms and peas. I also used cream of mushroom soup instead because that was what i had. It also needs spice i added cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper, absolutely amazing! will make again soon!

4 stars as I had to make changes to get to a product I liked. Consistency.too thick and gloppy on the sauce..added a cup of half and half. Flavor....changed to half sharp cheddar and added half tsp of dry mustard powder as it was a bit bland. Good base to work from though with small changes

This was surprisingly delicious!  I used a mix of gruyere/swiss cheese,  low salt canned mushroom soup, creme fraiche instead of sour cream and also added in a can of drained cut up pineapple yum!  I also drizzled a tiny bit of melted butter over the breadcrumbs to make them crispy.  Definitely will make it again - thanks

If you like the ingredients, you'll probably like this. We found it bland, and I'm not sure what I'd do to kick it up. I did add peas to the overall mix, and that was nice and probably improved it for us. But still, even with added garlic, something, SOMETHING, is missing here. But if you're a fan of bland, you'll like it. Kids who like ham will like it b/c of it's blandness. If I figure out what it needs (a low priority for me, as other recipes don't require such brainpower), I'll make it again with the revision; otherwise, I'm glad I tried it, but won't do again.

This is a really good recipe. Especially if you have ALOT of ham or turkey or whatever just lying around from the holidays. The only change I made though is that I didn't measure my sour cream, just put in three heaping spoons, and as much cheese as I wanted. It came out very creamy with a hint of onion. Yummmm!

Made this with only one change - left out the onion - and it was absolutely delicious. Will definitely make this one again and again - it is now a family favorite!

Delicious for a basic casserole.  I used cheddar and left out the onions because my husband is not a fan.  No leftovers.

This dish surprised me.  I wasn't expecting anything great, but this turned out to be really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any onions, so I left them out. A reviewer below noted that this is like "ham helper." I agree, but I doubt most users are expecting gourmet or haute cuisine from this! For what it is, which is simple comfort food and a great way to use up leftovers, it is wonderful~!

This is Ok if you are looking for simple food for picky eaters, but my husband said it tasted like it came from a box called "Ham Helper"....I agree.

This was a very good casserole and a great way to finish up leftover ham. I added a few things, like peas, sauteed spinach and garlic, I used low fat sour cream and cheddar cheese to make healthier. It was very tasty and my family really enjoyed it.

Very good, and helps to use up leftover ham.  For some reason my onion didn't soften enough, but I'm chalking that up to my error.  Served it with spiced slow cooker applesauce from this site.

This was excellent!  I didn't have sour cream so used a little bit of heavy whipping cream.  After draining the noodles I used the empty pot to saute onions in butter.  Then just added all the ingredients to the pot to mix and then poured into the casserole dish.  I used fresh bread crumbs on top....Delicious!!

This was a delicous way to use up some of our leftover Christmas ham. I did leave out the onion and used 1/2 teaspoon onion powder instead. I also increased the breadcrumbs to 1/2 a cup and toasted them in 1 tablespoon of butter. Just before I was going to pop the casserole in the oven my husband came home with a bonus check so he wanted to take my 80-year old Dad and me out todinner. So I covered the casserole with foil and stuck it in the frige. The next night I took it out and baked it covered for 25 minutes then uncovered for another 25 minutes and it was done.

This was very good, liked the taste tho a bit dry & I did add a little milk, will make again but will add about 3/4 soup can of milk.  I also added steamed broccoli & only had cream of mushroom soup but would try chicken soup next time just to see if there is much difference.Thanks for sharing..

I made changes based on what other people stated about this being: bland or having too much a swiss cheese taste.  I did half swiss and half cheddar. Although, it did seem like a lot of cheese! For additional flavor I added a pinch of onion salt and garlic powder. And, I usually have problems with onions not cooking fully in casseroles or being over-powering, as some reviewers had said, so I very finely minced the onion and used 1/3 cup. Once in the oven though the casserole started getting "dry looking," so I took out after 30 min. instead of the 40. When done no one complained about the meal. However, I rated it a 3 because I really thought this was "dry" and rather "salty." But, the 3 main ingredients are really high in sodium, so that should have been an indicator. I made this because I was really hoping for a creamy looking casserole like the picture, but it was more like dry noodles with swiss cheese flavor and ham.

I loved this recipe. I'm not usually a fan of Swiss cheese, but it does go great with the ham. I made it quick and easy with some store-bought diced ham (and probably used a little more than the recipe called for). It may have been more of a different taste for my son, but he's not the one rating this and I really liked it. Thanks for this one!

Made this with some leftover ham and it was delicious...kids loved it too.  I did not put in the cream of chicken soup due to a soy protein allergy, but instead made my own "cream" sauce using equal amounts (2 T) of butter and flour and a cup of milk.  Also added some garlic powder, pepper, and onion pepper to my cream sauce.  Will make again.  Thanks!

Good casserole. Also tasted good as leftovers. Will probably try cheddar cheese next time. But will most certainly make again. My husband is not a fan of onions, so I used onion powder instead of onion. The neighbors enjoyed this dish also.

This is a wonderful and flexible recipe. I have made it as directed, but have also made changes and it is always delicious. Because we love them, I usually add a can of diced green chiles (mild). I also have added diced zucchini and would not hesitate to add celery, diced peppers, even peas. I use penne pasta because I have it on hand. A "go to" recipe for using left over ham.

I sauteed the onion and some garlic before using. Used cream of mushroom soup in lieu of cream of chicken.  Only had 18 oz of cheese so used that.  Mixture seemed a little dry so I added milk  until it was nice and creamy.  Made two casseroles.  We really enjoyed this casserole and it was easy to make. 
 I will definately make this again but will probably add more peppper and cayenne for a little more spice.
Loved the swiss cheese but may try it with cheddar cheese next time since I always have cheddar in my fridge.

I made this lastnight as a dish to use up some of my Christmas ham. It was pretty tasty! I made a couple of changes to it though. I added a bag of frozen broccoli to add a little bit of veggies to it. I also added a little heavy cream to thin out the mixture a little bit and make it a bit creamier and did a half sharp cheddar and half swiss mix. I also think next time I will saute the onions or do green onions instead since they were still not cooked after 40 minutes in the oven. I also covered with foil for 30 minutes of the bake time so it didn't dry out. All in all this recipe is a keeper!

Made this with leftover Christmas ham and it was good - not super flavorful, but good and filling.  I might make it again using Gruyere or some fancy cheese.  But a good recipe overall.  Thanks!

This recipe is very good. I followed the recipe except for sautéing the onions and, then added diced carrots, fresh peas and two cloves of garlic minced. This was very creamy and not dry in the least as others have posted. Moisture levels do vary based on climate range though. Everyone loved it and asked for seconds so, I was grateful there was a lot. This is a perfect dish to take to a tureen or family dinner. I forgot to take a photo but will add one next time I make it. Thanks Kelli F. for a recipe that my picky family loved.

Great recipe, my family loved it, but I did tweak it a bit.  I also sautéed the onion and a bit of grated garlic before I added it to the mix.  I used grated cheddar in place of the Swiss.  Another person thought it was bland and wondered what to add..I stirred in a tsp or so of Dijon mustard.  Seemed to add a little more flavor and zing!

You MUST add more liquid...I add 'some' half and half and 'some' chicken stock...also I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup, and also added a small can of drained mushroom stems and pieces. Very important for great flavor, brown your cubed ham in olive oil and butter along with the onion ... sprinkle in at least a teaspoon of poultry seasoning... I use white cheddar and put some on top before the breadcrumbs...trust me on this one  :-)

This was delicious. Perfect for left over ham. I only used half the noodles and it was plenty for 3 people. I also sautéed the onions first. I baked it only for about 39 minutes, you don't want to over cook the noodles. And I used some paprika garlic powder and chives.

I loved this recipe because it is so easy to twice. I used cream of mushroom soup and added sliced raw mushrooms and frozen peas. Took the suggestion of another reviewer and used crushed Ritz crackers on the top. The biggest thing I changed is the assembly ,  I did not put the noodles in with the other ingredients but when I baked it, but served them separately. The noodles would have sucked up the liquid and make the casserole dry. I did bake the other ingredients for 45 min. at 350 degrees so the cheese, mushrooms and onion would cook. It was delicious. Could use tune or chicken in this also.

Made this for dinner tonight to use up some leftover ham. Pretty much followed the recipe, but, had to use what I had on hand. Substituted cheddar cheese for the swiss cheese and onion powder in place of the diced onion. Used 1.5 cans of cream of mushroom instead of chicken. It seemed like it would be dry without more soup and a little splash of milk. Baked for 30 minutes and then topped with some Colby Jack cheese instead of bread cumbs, never have liked that texture. I liked that this made a 2 qt. casserole (instead of 3 qt.) because we usually have too much leftover. This was a big hit with the family and will definitely be made again!! Thanks Kelli for the recipe!

I really like this recipe. It has a wonderful taste, it has to be from the swiss cheese. What I did differently from the first time I made it was to add about 3/4 cups of milk to make it a little creamier. It was great.Sweetie and I love it.

This is so good!  We do not like Swiss cheese, so I used Sharp Cheddar instead.  I had some leftover boiled onions from dinner, so I used those. I used french fried onions in place of bread crumbs.  I cooked our ham using the recipe on here calling for beer and pineapples.  My casserole was creamy, not too thick or too thin.

Our family enjoyed this one. The kids even ate it without much of an argument instead of taking one look and saying, "yuck"! We used cheddar instead of swiss, and rotelle noodles because that's what I had on hand.

Very good! I also sautéed the onions first before adding them to the dish. I used cream of mushroom soup,  2cups of ham, rigatoni noodles, 1 cup pepper jack cheese, 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, 3/4 can of skim milk, and omitted the sour cream. I also mixed 2 tablespoons of butter with cornflakes instead of bread crumbs because I didn't have any on hand. It turned out great!

I usually try a recipe unmodified before rating it, but I couldn't do that with this one, because I know my families' taste in food. I made a ham the other day and had tons of leftover ham. I loved this, my husband said it was good, my kids are picky eaters and didn't really like it (but I was expecting that). I used creme of broccoli soup, a bit more sour cream, no onions, cubed sharp cheddar cheese, and cooked broccoli florets. I topped it with crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. If I were rating this just on MY opinion, then I would have given it 5 stars. I did not find this to be dry at all, it was very cheesy. I won't make it again ONLY because of my family. I really loved it!

I have made this recipe twice now and both ways it was good. I played around with the ingredients and found one that my family enjoyed. I added extra sour cream (about 1 cup) and used Cream of mushrom soup. Also I cooked the onion with butter to take out the raw taste and used the cheese I had on hand. Anyway you make it it tastes like comfort! Thanks for the recipe.

This was really fantastic. I usually make a few changes based on what is in my pantry, so here are my substitutions: Garden Rotini (not egg noodles), Cream of Celery soup (not chicken), 1 cup Mexican blend cheese plus 1/2 cup cottage cheese. I also added roughly 1/2 a cup of frozen chopped bell pepper and reserved part of the shredded cheese to top the casserole with the (Panko) bread crumbs. 

My husband and preschooler raved over this simple recipe, and it was surprisingly tasty for a simple casserole. I will probably make this every time I have leftover ham!

My family inhaled! Used a pack of no yolks egg noodles....left over ham from Easter that was defrosted from the freezer, low fat sour cream, crushed up whole wheat Ritaz crackers instead of bread crumbs, added about 1 shredded zucchini for a veg factor, and also used Condensed Cream Of Mushroom From Scratch from this site! Wanted the mushroom instead of chicken soup in this and honestly....did not have any condensed soup at all in the house....this was a very yummy casserole!

Thank You for Sharing this recipe. All good cooks experiment. However, Everything about this was  Bland. Regardless of the fact, I used fresh onion, from my garden and  fresh mushrooms . This may be a good basic recipe but it lacks flavor.

I wasn't really crazy about this one.  If I make it again I think I would add more soup and a little water.  Noodles seemed dry and the onions weren't cooked enough.  It needed a little bit more moisture and I think I will use a different pasta.  Maybe I will try it again with some tweeks.

Chopped onion never really came out tender, and as others have noted, the casserole is very bland.  I finally settled on a customized version submitted by briansthecook and added some of my own seasonings as well.

Did my own spin on this recipe. Diced 2 cups of ham (small pieces), 1 cup par cooked broccoli (chopped med) and 3 cups cooked whole grain pasta shells. (What I had in the house) I made a white cheese sauce in saucepan: 1 stick of butter melted, whisk flour to thicken, add aprox 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 bag of pre-shredded cheese. Salt & pepper to taste. Whisk till smooth...med heat.
Combine all in large bowl, mix well then place in baking dish, topping with a bit more cheese and French Fried Onion Rings, bake in 350 oven till top is browned. OMG it was delish!!!!

Very good for Easter Ham leftovers. I sauteed the onions and added a diced red bell pepper. I replaced half of the swiss cheese by mozzarella to make it more "kid friendly" and did not use bread crumbs.

The whole family enjoyed this!  I didn't use egg noodles, but penne.  I added 2 cups of fresh chopped mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions in about a tablespoon of olive oil until the onions were tender.   I didn't have cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom soup.  Once everything was in the casserole dish I realized I did not have breadcrumbs, so I completely omitted them and covered with foil.  I removed the foil for the last 10 minutes to crisp the top.

My Family LOVES this casserole! I only use about 2/4 of an onion because im not a big fan of them and it always turns out great. I also add 1 cup each of peas and corn and it adds great texture and flavor (Not to mention its a greatway to "sneak" in veggies for my 2 year old ;).

I am deleting this one from my recipe box as we speak.    I did not like the onion taste with this one at all maybe that was because all I had was white onion and I think yellow onion may have been better and also I don't think a whole onion was necessary.  Other than that I can't figure out what went wrong but I thought after eating it (the one bite that I had) that maybe I would try cream cheese instead of swiss. It is not kid friendly either, neither one of my kids would touch it and believe it or not mine are not picky.  My boyfriend was the only one who ate it and even he said it was just ok and he'll eat anything.

This was really good! I will make it again, but probably use a little less ham and maybe add some chopped broccoli.

I give this recipe a five star rating! My family absolutely loved!! No leftovers in this family! I did use some of the other ideas to sauté the onions which Included chopped celery.  are you also add it seasoning salt. As recommended I did add milk. Also melted the butter with Panko breadcrumbs. Covered for half of the time and uncover until golden brown.

I made a few adjustments:
-Used sharp cheddar cheese instead
-Added a pack of bag steamed broccoli, chopped
-Used cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken
-Added soy milk for additional moisture, using the volume of the empty can of mushroom soup
-Baked the casserole covered with a "splash" of water to ensure moisture and then uncovered for an additional 2 minutes under the broiler to crisp the top
YUMMY!!

Inspired me to use up a couple cups of leftover ham. I used cream of mushroom soup and pepperjack cheese, a bit less onion. I think it has many more possibilities.

It was a bit bland.  I used my usual Trader Joe's spices but next time I'll just use a bit more.  I add peas and corn and used mozzarella cheese.  It's below zero here now, and it was a nice, warming bit of comfort food.

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I did do what others said and sautéed the onions & added a bit of garlic.  I also added some mixed veggies to it, also.  It was wonderful!  Great basic recipe that it seems you can change up if you’d like.  I will be making it again, and probably switching things up a bit!!

I added canned mushrooms to the recipe and used cream of chicken with herbs.
I think I would use less onion and saute them first to give them a tender consistency.  But, altogether pretty tasty!

I used a bag of shredded swiss (6 oz instead of 8 oz). I added a box of fresh mushrooms (8 oz) and used cream of mushroom soup as others recommended. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms first to make sure they would be well cooked and everything else the same. Peas as a side ended up getting mixed in. Yummy.

I made this as recipe reads, although I used the bag of egg noodles (probably closer to 6 cups). I think that is why I had to bake in a 9x13 pan. I did add chopped fresh spinach and realized I forgot the sour cream, but added when I took casserole out of oven. May not look picture perfect, but tasted delicious and I will make again and not forget sour cream before baking it.

I love this!  Easy to throw together and delicious. I made this a couple times and love it but I do make a couple small changes. First, a whole onion seems to be too much. I also add half a can of milk to the mixture. Instead of bread crumbs I top it with French fried onions (from the can). There is still a crispy top and adds to the flavor when I cut down on the fresh onion. Lastly, I cover with foil and bake 30 minutes, then remove foil for ten more minutes. Keeping it covered and adding the milk keep it creamy, not soupy, and not dried out. I bet this would be great with some fresh asparagus mixed in, or broccoli. It needs a bit of color.

Came out very good following the recipe with only a couple of changes. Added Cheddar Cheese soup & Low Fat milk instead of the Cream of Chicken and a 4 cheese mixture, along with using gluten-free elbow macaroni. Was a hit at home and on Facebook too!

A big hit at this house. I used mushroom soup and added about half a cup of 10% cream. I had some asparagus that I presteamed and added. Had no Swiss cheese so used medium cheddar. For the topping I used Panko crumbs and Parmesan.
Delicious, will make again

We thought this was yummy. I made half the recipe, used cream of chicken soup and just a small amount of cheddar cheese. I sauteed the onion with garlic then added to the rest. Baked it covered for 20 min then sprinkled on crushed ritz-type crackers and baked another 10. I served it with roasted asparagus and salad. I would have added peas for color but I don't like them.  It was very creamy and two of us finished up the left-overs in no time. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum.  I will make this again as my family liked this dish a lot.  However, per other reviews, the  recipe needs a lot more liquid.  I increased sour cream by 1/4 cup, added 1/4 cup half and half and also 1/2 cup pasta water to the noddle/soup/cheese/ham mixture and it was still a tad dry after baking. I also substituted 1 cup Fontina for 1/2 of the gruyere, added garlic powder, dill, parsley, dry mustard and red pepper flakes. I made the crumb topping from Panko bread crumbs, crushed canned onion rings and grated Parmesan cheese.   Broiled for 2 minutes at end to crisp top.

We loved it! I added 1/2 a bag of steamed peas and left over stuffing in place of the bread crumbs. Just a heads up, I didn't realize the ham I added was a bit salty so when I salted it I put a bit more than I should have. Enjoy

I had to make some changes based on what I had on hand and per some of the reviews, hence the 4 stars.  1st, I used Crm of mushroom soup instead of chicken. 2nd, I added some garlic powder and a bit of cayenne powder, 'cause I like garlic and a little heat. #3, used Monterey Jack cheese, 'cause I didn't have Swiss. #4 added probably almost a soup can of water to the mix 'cause it was so thick. I followed the rest of the recipe AND assembly technique as written.  This was VERY good, but VERY rich.  I'll probably make this again because it's such an easy and flexible recipe.

This recipe is wonderful as is! 

I did make one change based on preference and that was to saute the onions before adding them to the mixture. They come out too raw for my tastes if only cooked in the oven.

The family really enjoyed this dish.  With that said, I made a few alterations so didn't give it 5 stars as-is.  I sauteed the chopped onion first, substituted cheddar for Swiss cheese and cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken soup, added a can of drained peas for some vitamins, and doubled (at least) the amount of sour cream.  I also crumbled some chips I had laying around (potato chips, corn chips) and sprinkled on top in replacement of the bread crumbs.  I baked it uncovered so the crumbled chip topping would crispen.

Kept pretty close to the recipe.  Good basic, added a little sour cream and half and half, just to make sure it did not dry out.  Froze half for another time. 
 Okay and will probably make again.

Easy to make and very tasty. I cooked onion in olive oil before I mixed with the fixings. I used crushed Ritz crackers combined with melted butter for the topping. Covered casserole to prevent drying out. Baked uncovered for 5 minutes to brown topping. Wonderful dish for left over ham.

And the last of the Christmas ham ushered in the New Year on a delicious note.

The best tasting casserole I have made to date. I think the swiss and sour cream made a much better cheese base than my usual milk, butter and cheddar. Lighter on the calories and smoother on the taste buds. So good.

I will be subbing  spaghetti, chicken and parsley into this recipe in the near future.

I had a slice of smoked ham i found in the freezer that i needed to use up. I looked at different recipes,however I chose this one because it was basic and i could use whatever i had on hand. I didn't have  egg noodles,so i used a package of gnocchi made from potato,
cream of mushroom soup,because that is what i had and onions,celery,red pepper for color and flavor,seasoning of  dried chili peppers,mustard,because we like BOLD  flavors. My husband needs  green so i threw in a couple of handfuls of frozen green peas. Topped with  Swiss  and cheddar because i didn't have enough Swiss cheese and corn flake crumbs.... yummy Sunday night dinner.

Excellent use of leftover ham.  Quite tasty and easy.   Based on another review, I added fresh spinach to the sautéed onion until it wilted.   I didn't have any Swiss cheese so used cheddar and it turned out quite well.  Will make this again

I made this tonight and it was certainly a hit with my granddaughter and husband and I. I used potato chips on the top and it gave it a nice flavour and some extra salt. I added broccoli to it for colour and veggies and it turned out great. Definitely make it again.

I added some steamed broccoli to it. We had no Swiss cheese so I substituted sharp cheddar. I didn't think it was going to be as creamy when mixing it but I withheld putting anything extra in it and it came out creamy as is.

It turned out great! I had a lot of ham stuck to the bones of a spiral ham and hated to throw it away. I boiled it for 2 hours and the meat fell off the bone! I followed the directions but used NY cheddar cheese and threw in some frozen peas. BF loved it, so I'll will make it again. Very hearty!  Thanks!

I made a ton of changes but still give it 4 stars as a good base.  I  sauteed the diced ham in bacon grease & should have used 3 cups of ham instead of 2. I made a cheese sauce making a roux (with bacon grease of course, milk, chicken broth, homemade seasoning salt, Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard & a teaspoon of pepper) & using Monterey Jack cheese. I upped the sour cream to a cup. Likewise the breadcrumbs to a cup, mixed with melted butter.

This was a great way to use up some leftover ham!  I added lightly steamed and chopped broccoli like the picture and covered for the first 30 min, then let it brown up a little in the last 10-15.  Delicious!

Because I think it is unfair to rate a recipe without testing it as written, I did try it exactly as described. It is  a very good recipe and a super way to use leftover ham  once people tire of ham sandwiches. 

The second time I made this, I  tweaked it,  the main difference being a quick homemade cream of chicken soup ( heated milk with chicken broth to a simmer, added a roux of butter and flour to thicken, some garlic powder, other spices as desired) .

Also, the photo seems to show broccoli ? but it isn't in the instructions , I think I'll add some next time so the veggies and main dish are combined. I I used the same amounts of noodles, cheese and ham as the original recipe but used cheddar cheese.. Added some cloves of minced garlic with the chopped onions. . . I also  added a fair amount of finely chopped parsley for color. No crumb topping.  Everyone loved it. 

Both versions are tasty but I generally like to adjust recipes to suit my family's taste. And - lke so many families- they have their preferences.m

Really yummy casserole!  I didn't have enough Swiss cheese, so I shredded leftover Provolone, Cheddar, and Asiago cheese as well, in equal amounts.  It may have been more than the 2 cups recommended.  I also substituted cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken and yogurt for the sour cream.  I added several splashes of milk because I thought it would dry out.  Great way to use up stuff and have it taste great!

Not a meal I would serve with company but a great weekday family dinner. I changed a few things to what I had on hand. I used a homemade version of the cream soup (4 T butter melted, whisk in 6 T flour, cook on med whisking for a min or 2, slowly whisk in 1 C broth, 1 C milk, pinch salt & pepper, whisk constantly until thick). I used 1/2 tsp onion powder in place of the onion. I added a 10 oz box of frozen chopped, cooked, and subbed cheddar cheese for the swiss. I used about 10 Ritz crackers crumbled on top. I will definitely make again.

It was a great use for leftover ham!  I adjusted the recipe from 8 servings to six, used sharp cheddar  cheese, Cream of Mushroom soup, and Ritz crackers for topping. Otherwise followed the recipe.

This was excellent! My whole family went back for seconds! I changed it up a bit to use up leftovers I had in the fridge loved it. I sautéed the onion with some garlic in olive oil. I used elbow macaroni and added broccoli. I doubled the soup and sour cream and used a mix of white and medium yellow cheddar. I tossed the bread crumbs with some melted butter and cooked 40 min uncovered. I jade enough to fill 2 9x9 pans so one went in the freezer for another dinner.  I really think you can use any noodle, meat, cheese and veggie and this will be excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

Good as it is but also a good recipe to fool around with a bit, using different cheeses, mushroom soup, different vegetables, or those french fried onion rings on top. I do increase the amount of vegetables in order to get a few more into my vegetable avoiding husband.

The only change I made was to sauté the onions and add some broccoli. It was really good, but next time I make it I think I'll try something other than egg noodles, and make sure they're a little under cooked. The noodles were a little mushy. Otherwise, everyone loved it!

This recipe is delicious and was a big hit with my family. I made the following changes: I cooked the onion in with the noodles so they'd be softer yet still give full flavor, I used 1/2 Swiss cheese and 1/2 cheddar, and I added a pkg of frozen birds eye antioxidant vegetables which gave it a nice color as well as rounded out the casserole for a complete meal. I didn't find it dry at all, I think it's perfect!

Needs a little something to get it all the way to where I want to go. I added a mix of Swiss and Cheddar plus about 3/4 C milk. I like some green so added some broccoli florets to the pasta water (used Gemelli) w/ 5 minutes to go. I upseasoned it w/ pepper and a dash of cayenne. Sauteed shallots/onion/garlic before baking. Sorry, reviewer...I used Boarshead low salt deli Ham...3 Cups worth (wanted to decrease overall salt and increase protein). Turned out great. Leftovers work great and it freezes well too.

Good basic recipe. You can liven it up with some broccoli or mushrooms.  Next time, I'll follow others' recommendation to sauté the onions first (adding mushrooms and broccoli , too).  I added about 1/4 cup milk to thin out the sauce because it looked a bit stiff for mixing in the noodles. Definitely cover the casserole through the first 20 minutes of baking.

This recipe was pretty good. I did have to adjust some things because I didn't have swiss cheese and the hubby and kids don't like it. I used sharp cheddar instead and did keep a little of the pasta water to mix it. When boiling the noodles, I added the ham and some corn and boiled that with the noodles, just to get the dish to bake faster when it was time to put into the oven. For the most part I stuck with the recipe. I will add some garlic seasoning next time as I think that this will make it better overall. Great recipe and very adaptable, Thanks for sharing!

Was this dry for anyone else? I even added a little extra milk before putting in the casserole dish. Maybe 40 minutes is too long for it to bake. I make a similar dish to this but I usually don't bake it. I just combine the ingredients in a large pot and then heat it through and serve it right out of the pot. I like that it stays cheesy and gooy-ier that way. Next time I won't bake this.

I have made this a couple of times.  I used shredded cojack cheese and cream of mushroom soup because that's what I had on hand.  I did add a little milk, otherwise it would have been dry.  Everyone liked the dish.  A very good way to use left over ham.

This was a super easy and delicious casserole!  The only thing I did differently was to boil my onions with the noodles and then added 1/2 cup milk since it seemed very thick when I mixed it all together.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Thank you, Kelli!

I hesitate to review a recipe when I have made changes, but this recipe is so flexible and so good. I had some zucchini and green pepper that needed to be used, so diced both and added them. I used provolone cheese which was also on its last legs. And then because I am trying to eat lo carb, I used Dreamfield's rotini. It came out great!

I would give this 5 stars for flavor, but gave it 4 just because it seemed like it would be too dry when I mixed it up, so added some nonfat milk.  I used light sour cream and lowfat soup, and packaged herb stuffing mix for the breadcrumbs.  We really liked it; I'll make again.  I'm always looking for new ways to use up ham.

Very easy. Used cream of mushroom soup just because that's what I had. Didn't have any onion so left that our but think I wouldn't have used an entire onion anyways. Added about 1 cup frozen peas. Whole family loved it.

Wow, it was surprisingly good, and made with everyday ingredients. I don't really like ham, so my expectations were low. Everyone ate it without complaint and it really smelled delicious while baking.  This recipe is a keeper. (I probably used a little more cheese and sour cream than called for though as I just "eyeballed" the measurements for those yummy ingredients)Thanks for the recipe!

Surprisingly yummy. Used linguini, broken into short lengths and precooked, a mixture of Gouda and strong cheddar (what I had on hand), mushroom soup and a little sour cream (again, what I had left in the container). Fried up half an onion and some mushrooms, tossed it all together and added a little extra milk. Topped with toasted buttered panko and baked about 20 minutes. Really surprised at how good it was!

I prepared this gluten free and it was delicious!  I used gluten free pasta and gluten free cream of chicken soup.  I omitted the bread crumbs and instead put the casserole under the broiler to brown. I also omitted the onions because my family doesn't care for them.  I substituted sharp cheddar cheese for the Swiss cheese.  It's a keeper!

I really liked this recipe but added my own twist.  Used (2) cans of Cream of Mushroom soup.  Can of mushrooms.  1/2 a can of milk.  Kuluski noodles.  2 cups of shredded Italian cheese.  Omitted the onions, but topped our casserole with French's Fried Onions. Delicious.

Giving this a five star rating with my changes. I just made this for the first time today July 1, 2013.  After reading the reviews I made the following changes.  First of all I used whole wheat egg noodles.  I used a mixture of cheddar cheeses already shredded by Sargento although you can use any combination of cheeses you like.  The Sargento package says 1 and 7/8 cups. Close enough.  I also added milk as it seemed dry when I mixed it up.  I used about a cup of milk maybe a bit more until I felt it was creamy enough.  I like to use croutons that I put through my chopper, usually cheddar and garlic, instead of bread crumbs as they add a bit more flavor.  The result was terrific.  My husband and I loved it.

I only had one cup of ham on hand, so I substituted the 2nd cup with chicken and it tasted great! It was a little dry and could use some milk. But it was overall a great casserole. My kids loved it! Which gives this recipe an automatic 5 stars!

Good basic casserole recipe. I would make it again for leftover ham or a quick dinner but I would not make it for other people. It was very easy to make and I would make it again for that reason.

Yum! This has to be one of the fastest and tastiest Mac & Cheese style casseroles we've tried. It was in the oven in no time and we made it on a week night after work and grocery shopping! We used old cheddar as we already had it in the fridge and left over ham from Easter. No extra salt was required due to the saltiness of the other ingredients. This one is a my new favorite!

I had leftover ham from Easter spiral ham. I used rotini pasta, increased the sour cream to 1 cup,added 1 can of baby peas and 1/2 cup chicken broth it was delicious. This is a recipe you can substitute shrimp or chicken for the ham.

I added a 10 ounce can of condensed broccoli cheese soup to it. It helped to keep it creamy and enhanced the cheese flavor without overdoing it.

Thank you! This was great and my family said, "Make again!" Couple of things I did - sauteed the onions before hand as someone had mentioned, subbed plain Greek yogurt for sour cream, added stuffing mix to the top during the last 5 minutes of cooking, and added the leftover corn from dinner yesterday. I cooked it covered and took the lid off during the last 5 minutes. Definitely will make again!!

I always hate to rate a casserole when I make changes, but I'm doing it.  I added a cup of milk/cream as it seemed thick.  I don't like Swiss, so I used Cheddar instead.  I buttered the bread crumbs.  Boy, was it good. It was not bland, but just right. I recommend this recipe, even if you make a few changes.

I added more ham than the recipe called for & also used 8 ounces of sour cream. I think it would have been too dry otherwise. Great easy family meal.

This was amazing. I did make a few adjustments by adding some dried herbs as well as a full tub of sour cream and a little splash of milk because I did use a fair bit of noodles, and oh my god, it was amazingly delicious. I ended up not needing to salt the dish at all. 

The sour cream and chicken soup meld together to create such an amazing sauce. 

I know this will be cooked in my house again and again.

Just tried this recipie.  Loved it!  Only changes I made were:  did not add salt (enough in the ham and cheese for our home)and used a handful of leeks (the green stem parts) and some onion powder instead of a yellow onion.

Used the original recipe and previous reviews as guidelines, but tried to make it a little healthier.  I used whole wheat egg noodles, cream of mushroom soup 98% fat free, non-fat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, about 1/2c. skim milk to moisten, panko crumbs for crispier topping, and mozzarella cheese that I had on hand.  Also, sauteed onions before using as others suggested.  Covered casserole for first 40 minutes to retain moisture then uncovered to brown panko crumbs.  It turned out great and picky family loved it.  I will be making this again.

Hubby & I loved this. I added tiny sweet frozen peas - had to use cream of mushroom soup as we don't care for cream chicken. I will definitely make this again. YUM, this is comfort food!

As a single dad, with very picky daughters, I have to be cautious when cooking. I knew both girls liked ham (Turkey Ham), so I decided to try this. The only addition I made was to finely chop steamed broccoli and mix it in with the other ingredients. It was a complete success. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

My family really enjoyed this. I did make a few  changes. First I used green onions; second, as a previous reviewer suggested I used cream of mushroom soup and increased it to two cans; and third I added an additional cup of swiss cheese. The flavor overall was very good but I did find it dry which may have been because I added the extra cheese. It wasn't creamy the way I was anticipating but again it didn't take away from the flavor. Next time I think I'll stir in a cup of milk and see if that helps but we will be having it again for sure. Great use for that extra ham. Thanks for the recipe.

Good, but better the next day.  I would have left the onions out since the kids thought they were overpowering the recipe.

Had this for dinner tonight.  Not bad, but fairly bland.  My wife and daughter both remarked that it seemed to be missing something, but neither could come up with any suggestions as to what it might be.
