I beg to differ with the reviewer that said “Pasta is pasta”. This is the recipe I have been making for years, give or take a tablespoon or two of water, and when not made with Semolina flour, it is a whole different flavor and texture. I swear by the semolina flour in the pasta I make,  it holds the sauce better and has a much better flavor. Thank you for submitting this recipe, it refreshed my memory.

This is five stars for taste but it required far more liquid and time. I started out with the stated 2 tbs  of water but the dough would not come together so I kept adding more, one tbs at a time for a total of 12. In hindsight I should have added an additional egg or two.  Pasta made with semolina is heartier with a rougher texture that helps sauce cling to the pasta. I cooked this for a total of 8 mins in boiling water then added the pasta to a non stick pan with one ladle of the pasta water and two ladles of sauce and let that simmer for two minutes before serving. Thanks for sharing.
