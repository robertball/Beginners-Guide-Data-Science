I gave it two stars because I made a mess of it. I put too much broth in the mixture and ended up with a chicken/sausage mush. The cornbread and bread cubes disintegrated. It tasted good but the consistency was awful. I will give this a try again with much less chicken broth.

Used croutons instead of French bread also added some dried sage thyme salt and pepper to the sausage/celery mixture because I couldn't find sausage with sage.
