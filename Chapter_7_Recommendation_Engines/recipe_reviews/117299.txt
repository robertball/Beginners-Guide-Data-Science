I am from New England and i can say this was one of the best chowders i have eaten. It was AWESOME! The only thing i did differently was omit the lobster (due to expense). Also the recipe calls to cut the fish into 1 inch cubes, in the future i would make everything (fish and potatoes) bigger chunks because they break apart a little bit. Great recipe! (btw I became a member of this website just so i could review this recipe. It was that good.)

This chowder was AWESOME. I didn't put Lobster in only because it was expensive. I also left out the bacon, but added some corn and I thickened it up with some corn starch.  I will ABSOLUTELY be making this again...Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a very good seafood chowder.  We modified a few things such as, crab instead of lobster and no parsley, but other than that followed the recipe.  I would probably add more potatoes because that's what I like, and I might boil down the potatoes a bit more to make a thicker chowder.  But the taste was awesome!  Thanks for the recipe:-)

DON'T USE SWEETENED EVAPORATED MILK!  Oops, I used SWEETENED evaporated milk and the chowder, while still amazing, had a much sweeter taste than I would have preferred.

This was fantastic! I halved the recipe and added a can of smoked oysters (drained and rinsed) and doubled the haddock as the fish market did not have any cod. This one's a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

a very tasty recipe, my husband and I really enjoyed this, its not too rich but is still sweet and delicious.  We made a basic fish stock and used it in place of the plain water and added fish, shrimps and a small tin of smoked oysters. We used Terekihi in place of the other fish because my husband went fishing on Sunday and thats what he bought home.

This chowder was excellent, although a little expensive if you don't live near the water.  Will definitely make again and again.

This is a great simple chowder recipe.... good with whatever seafood is on hand at the time, the bit of curry is the key to the flavor.... delicious!

Oh, my this was gooood. My husband couldn't have a conversation with anybody. All he could say was mmmh mmmh. I didn't have any lobster or scallops but I can only imagine this would have made it 6 stars. Oh, and I added a little old bay seasoning. Other than that I made it as written! Again, YUM!

delicious! I didnt add all the butter - rather I used a bit of the bacon drippings and 1 tbs butter and it was perfect. I cubed little red potatoes skin on, added fresh thyme and skipped the curry too.

I grew up on the coast of maine, this is a yummy stew, with some thickening would be considered a chowder, but I like this no matter what you call it. I used fresh garlic, and heavy cream instead of evaporated milk.. and used only haddock and no cod, with crabmeat and baby shrimp. It was YUMMY! Thanks for shareing!

This was fantastic. The flavour was terrific. I halved the recipe. I didn't have all the varieties of fish on hand so I used frozen shrimp, scallops, and a seafood medley that had clams and squid, and I used 10% cream as I didn't have evap milk. I also added 2 tbsp. of flour to thicken (made a paste first then stirred into the chowder). I'm glad I did otherwise I think it would have been too thin.

I made this chowder for our annual New Years Eve progressive dinner for 12. Everyone RAVED... including the kids!  I did make a light roux seperately (so as not to darken the chowder using the same pot).  Also used 1 c. 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whole milk, no evaporated milk. I cut the servings down to 20 (love that feature on allrecipes), and had no leftovers! This will be a repeat recipe.

This was good but VERY costly to make in Ohio. You need to live on a coast to eat this on a regular basis.

In searching for just the right recipe to be served at a women's conference, I chose this one.  WOW!  It got rave reviews!  The only change I made was that I only used 3 lbs. of Tilapia and omitted the scallops, shrimp and lobster.  I can not imagine how good it would have been if I had included everything.

This was just what I was looking for. Very simple receipe. I added corn and since I am from MD, I also added some Old Bay Seasoning. I also only put in Lobster, scallops, and shrimp. Delicious. My husband even liked it and he doesn't like much. I thickened with corn starch as well. Thanks!

This soup was awesome! I loved the curry in it. It did not overpower at all and I also used crawfish instead of lobster. I just seasoned the crawfish before hand and it worked out perfectly. I made mine a bit thicker though. I like my chowders thick and creamy. Over all it had great flavor! Thanks for sharing:)

*Sigh.* This is divine. I've been eating chowder all summer at a number of different coastal restaurants and if I'd found anything like this it would have blown my mind. I burned my mouth, couldn't wait for it to cool!! I halved it and will still freeze some - it makes a lot. The only other change was once the onions were partway cooked, I added about 2 tsp of flour to get a bit of a roux going - I like it a bit thicker. AMAZING.

VERY good recipe! I read through the reviews before trying this out, and decided to start by putting the water and half the potatoes to start cooking in a separate pot, so that they would cook down and thicken. For our family, that worked out perfect, just the perfect amount of thickness. I also used half and half and the evaporated milk, and it was creamy without being to rich. This is a keeper recipe for us, so easy to make, and yummy!

Thank you for the recipe.  It turned out great.  I had to modify it for Florida a touch.  I used crab, snapper, and Grouper and it turned out great.  I also added a cup of corn starch like others did.  Thanks again.

This recipe is perfect in flavor. The hint of curry is the secret, not enough to distinguish it as curry, but mingled with the seafood...DELICIOUS! I did use chicken broth(fat free in the box) to cook the potatoes instead of water. I thickened the chowder with a bit of flour in order to give it more body. YUMM

We had this for Christmas Eve dinner and loved it. We added extra haddock and left out the cod and lobster. To thicken it, we used cream style corn and I took some potatoes with some of the broth and processed it. We also used low-fat 2% evaporated milk which was fine. Definitely a keeper.

I eat  and make a lot of chowder and this is the BEST recipe I've made and my family lived it, the curry really adds a nice touch. I just use whatever seafood I have on hand, I like it best with shrimp, scallops  and clams.

Made this recipe exactly as outlined.  It was delicious.   I would be interested in hearing how to make this a creamier chowder.  I would also suggest adding a bit more fish/scallops/lobster as I ended up with lots of broth and no more fish.  All in all, a terrific recipe...yummy!

This had a fantastic seafood chowder flavor, very simple, just as the recipe was written. This was also very simple to make! I'll be making this many times over the cold weather months.

Made it last night...it was awesome!  Used Mahi Mahi instead of the cod and haddock--and added a bunch of fresh in-the-shell clams.  Other than that, I made it as directed.  Very simple, yet so flavorful.  I can't wait to make this again; we loved it!

This is a great "go-to" recipe for those chilly evenings. I made a less expensive verision with cod, scallops and imitation lobster. I'm sure with the real ingredients in would be out-of-this-world! My version was easy and very tasty. My hubby loved it too. The curry seasoning is the secret ingredient! Oh- and don't second-guess the quantity of salt. It seemed excessive to me, but when it was all said and done it was just right! thank you for sharing your recipe!

I've made this twice and love it. The curry is what really makes it. I also added a drop of cheese spread the second time (I know a little ghetto) but the flavor really compliments.

I have tried it exactly like the recipe and LOVE IT. Then I tried a few changes.   I use clam juice instead of water and also add 1/4 cup of clam base and double the fish (because there is always so much of the yummy broth left when everything else is gone.)

Awesome 5 stars.  My picky kids love this recipe.
Yes thicken a little with corn starch if you want.  Maybe a little more potatoes diced (again if that's what you like).  This may be sacriledge but you CAN use imitation lobster and/or crab meat (I'm from Maryland).  Chesapeake Bay rock fish works too!

My whole family (one very picky husband and child, two moderately picky children, and two good eaters) LOVED this, and so did I!The recipe is very flexible, you can add different types of seafood depending on what you have or what's on sale that week! I am making this again tonight because we have a houseguest who is eager to try it since my kids have bragged about how good their mom's seafood chowder is!!

Really good and quick.  I only used shrimp and haddock and added corn.  I also needed to use corn starch to thicken it up, but it was realy good. Thanks.

This is Quite Good! Halved the recipe and I made some substitutions for the seafood using Imitation crab instead of lobster and Salmon for one of the white fishes listed. I used 2 less cups of milk then was called for as well. I was kind of eyeing up my quantities so perhaps my ingredients were on the light side. My only other advice would be to thicken with cornstarch or flour if you prefer your Chowder hearty as I do. I found it a bit "thin" as listed. Will make again using other forms of seafood. Thanks for posting!

Love This!  I used lobster, bay scallops and swordfish.  I also added a touch more curry and some cracked pepper.  Really good and will keep it in rotation.

Delicious.  I used lobster, cod and scallops.  I boiled a fresh lobster in a few cups of water for a few minutes and then strained the water to use it for cooking the potatoes instead of using plain water.  I also didn't add salt- you should taste test your chowder to determine if ou'll need the extra salt or not.

The best soup/chowder I have ever had!  Followed too a tee.  The only thing i might do next time is portion out the salt, and salt the diffrent fish before putting into the pot. I would also cut the haddock or cod into bigger pieces because the flake aprt while mixing.  As far as the complaints of being to pricey, if you ate this ate this  a restauraunt it would be $8.95 or $9.95 a bowl.  Evrey penny well spent on this dish!

This was a delicious chowder.  I've been looking for a good recipe.  Didn't use lobster too much $$$ and doubled the cod (couldn't get haddock).  Will make again.

This recipe is great exactly the way it is, but as lobster is a little hard to get in my area, I just left it out. This was by far the best chowder I have ever eaten.

Since I made this, I have discovered I am allergic to all dairy containing foods, hence this year I will be attempting a dairy-free version of this recipe. If it is just as good, I will post it here. 

Wish me luck!!

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written and it was superb!  We had family up visiting us in Maine from Alabama, so I wanted to give them a good ol' "Maine-themed" meal.  This chowder was such a hit!

Absolutely Delicious!!  I used a chowder mix of fish (included shrimp, haddock, scallops, lobster and more) and one cooked lobster.  I didn't use bacon but did add a half cup of frozen kernel corn.  I also added half a pint Whipping Cream!!  Yum!! I never heard of adding curry powder but it is amazing!

This was very good. I ended up using crawfish tails instead of lobster since it cost so much. I don't recomend the crawfish, but the basic recipe was wonderful. I would make this again.

I found this to be very good recipe.  I made some changes.  I used shrimp, scallops, and cod.  I also skipped the curry, but substituted wocesteshire sauce.  It was way too thin, so I baked 3 potatoes,(in addition to the potatoes that are diced) peeled and smashed them and added to chowder.  Consistency was much more like chowder.  I also didn't have evaporated milk but used 2 qts half and half instead of milk and evaporated milk.

It just lacked something. I even had the lobster and it was just OK. I felt like I wasted alot of good seafood on something that was just OK. I even tried taking the seafood out of the chowder and putting it over rice for a dinner and it just wasn't good. It needed more seasoning.

I had cod that I needed to use.  I decided to try this recipe.  I also had some scallops and shrimp in my freezer.  I followed the recipe exactly (used corn starch as a thickener as others recommended) but I am not a fan of curry.  Instead of the curry, I  added a tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning and a half of teaspoon of dill.  This was restaurant quality chowder.  Absolutely delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this one for my family and it was a total hit! I used a prepackaged seafood mix that I purchased from Costco's frozen section in place of the seafood and it was perfect! Even my guy who is not a big fan of seafood ate it...2 bowls!

This was the first time I made seafood chowder. I embellished a little by adding celery and bell peppers. I substituted cod with an extra pound of haddock and used crab instead of lobster. End result... yum! Thanks for the recipe!

This chowder was pretty good! When I make a choder I save the juices from the fish and scallops etc and add it to the broth.  I also thickened it with potato flakes..not too much just to the thickness you like. I didn't add the curry (not alot of people are a fan). I made this low fat using reduced fat canned milk and 1 % milk.  I omited the bacon altogether.  The lowfat version is awesome!

I didn’t make any significant changes to the recipe. I just used my own smaller amounts of everything to make smaller batch for 2 people. It’s very tasty.

I made this for dinner, and it was SO GOOD!  We're not typically chowder folks, but I had a hodge podge of seafood in the freezer, and I thought I'd take a chance with this.  This recipe did not disappoint.  We shared some with my mom who said it was the best chowder she'd ever had, not a typical "tuna soup."  

I used inexpensive shrimp, bay scallops and haddock (no lobster or cod).  I used a golden potato instead of russets, and added extra potato along with some frozen corn (to bring the overall cost down and to appeal more to my brood of children).  I put about half the potatoes in early and let them cook down into a roux.  I added thinly sliced potatoes in at the end and cooked the whole mess until they were tender.  Served with cornbread, my big family (7 people) ate until stuffed, and we still have half a pot to put in the freezer.

Excellent - delicious recipe. I actually had to make it dairy free for my daughter and used almond milk in place of regular, and a can of coconut milk instead of evaporated. Curry gives it suvh a nice flavour. I've made a couple times now (when canner lobsters are on sale) and will be making again tonight!
