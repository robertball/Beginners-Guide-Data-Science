My husband loved these.  We cooked them on our George Foreman grill in no time.  You can't ask for a quicker, easier meal!

These are absolutly amazing!  My family can't get enough of them.  I like mine without the chicken (veggie) and they're still great.  I use my George Forman for them and then come out crisp and delicious!

this is a quick recipe except for getting the grill ready.  really fast if you own a gas grill.  Makes a lot of servings.  Could upgrade to using chicken breasts and guacamole.

This is a great recipe for leftover chicken. I found it a little too bland for my taste but did add additional spices the second time to my own tastes. This is a great recipe if you do buffet type meals or want something that doesn't take a lot of thought.

I loved grilling quesadillas on the grill.  I used boneless chicken breast.  My kids don't enjoy spicy foods that much, so next time I will use just plain chicken on theirs.

Loved this! I couldn't find that adobo seasoning. I was doing these for a crowd so I cooked my chicken ahead with a little olive oil and spiced it up.  Then I did use chopped jalapeno's...I also made a spicy sour cream from another recipe...1 cup sourcream, 1/4 cup chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and 1/2 lime juice. it was awesome! my group raved!  will make again...

GREAT RICEPE ! HEALTHY - LOW FAT. KIDS LOVE THEM ALSO. FOUND IT EASIER TO USE JUST ONE TORTILLA AND THEN FOLD OVER LIKE AN OMELET. MUCH EASIER TO FLIP OVER ON THE GRILL THEN TO BROWN BOTH SIDES.

Great recipe! Very easy and simple to put together. I did a few changes though: I used the taco bell fajita seasoning instead of the adobo (dont even know what that is and didnt have time to look) and I only put cheese with the chicken (picky husband). I also used bonless skinless breasts. I cooked this in my humongous skillet on the stove. Worked great! (took a little practice to flip!) I scaled the recipe down to half and it still made a LOT for my husband and I. I have 2 days of leftovers for my lunch, fine with me! I served this with mexican rice and it was a great new dinner. Thanks!

We liked these.  Lightly brushed the 'grill' side of the tortillas with canola oil, added some sharp cheddar cheese, used green onions, sprinkled with garlic salt, and grilled on the griddle.

I agree with some of the other posters, it is just fair. It needs a lot of work to be great. With the addition of guacamole or diced tomatoes, cilantro or something else it could be great. I'll keep experimenting with ingredients.

a nice simple recipe that's great for dinner after a long day's work.

Quick to prepare while the 3 kids are telling you about their day and the phone is ringing.

Everyone loved it for the Canada Day BBQ at the park.

I have tried to make quesadillas many times and this recipe is the best. The
adobo seasoning makes a big difference. It makes the dish.

Great recipe, I just added a packet of sazon to the chicken with the adobo. Whole family loved them. Like others I also made them on the George Forman grill, makes it a lot faster.

This was a easy recipe to prepare I mararated my chicken before cooling on the grill in a chicken rub it made the chicken a lot more tender and also cooked a lot faster, I also added cooking my onions and bellpepper on the grill in some butter for more flavor.

These quesadillas are tasty! I would suggest using smaller tortillas if you are using a George Forman grill. The big ones hardly fit on the grill. But this recipe is a keeper!

These were good.  I used the Forman Grill.  I marinated the chicken in McCormick Baja Marinade, grilled and chopped.  I also didn't have green chilies on hand, but next time, I'll be sure use them.  Served with pico de gallo and sour cream.

These were only ok for us. I think they would be better if there had been salsa in the filling. They were also very messy, next time I will use less filling.

This was really an amazing meal. The chicken was amazing; my husband was set for eating just that! I like a lot of vegetables with my quesadillas so I made a kind of pico de gallo with green and red bell pepper and tomato added with the chiles and onion, seasoned with some salt. It adds a nice fresh and crispy taste.  I also used my griddle to toast my tortillas instead of my grill. it has a much lighter toasting effect.

I forgot to pick up adobo seasoning, so I got a recipe of the internet and used that instead.  This chicken turned out wonderful, I thought that it was good enough to eat on it's own!  The meat was wonderful smothered in cheese, and assorted veggies between two hot, crispy tortillas.  I will be making these regularly!

I don't have a grill so I use a 12" skillet on the stove.  I also use Kraft Tex Mex cheese for added flavor/spice (can't find Adobo Spice here), and a can of green chilies.  I also add a chopped tomato as well.  Tastes great and easy to fix.

This was fast and easy. I left off the black olives since my son and hubby don't care much for them. These were pretty good. Thanks.

This was very good. I had some minor changes. I didn't have adobo so I used taco seasoning instead, I skipped the olives and added cooked bacon instead. The tortilla's I bought were too big and were a little difficult to manuever on the bbq. I will definately add this to my bbq rotation.

These were very good. The grill adds a smoky flavor which was delicious! I seasoned the chicken as the recipe directed. Assembling the guesadillasI added chopped onion, peppers  & tomatoes. Love the idea and a great base recipe to have fun with. Would make an excellent camping meal.

Sounds delicious. What can I use in place of adobe seasoning? I've never heard of it and never seen it in the spice section, Help. Thank you:)
