I'm going to be making this for a crowd, so in a test run yesterday, I prepared the dish without cooking the pasta- I just added the extra cup of water and let it all get happy overnight. Baked it today for an hour at 375 and it was delicious. Pasta was perfectly done! So save yourself a step and make it the day before!

Oh....YUM.  Even as I was putting this in the oven I knew it would be our new favorite pasta bake. My only changes were to double the tomato paste and to add some (thawed) frozen spinach to up the nutritional aspect.  My son and I were even looking forward to the leftovers!!

I was trying to locate a meatless dish to serve during lent on Fridays and came upon this.  It was awesome!  My husband and I couldn't get enough of it.  The addition of the grape tomatoes really made this dish.  The freshness of the tomatoes really gave it a whole dimension of flavors as opposed to the traditional canned tomato products.  I didn't have fresh basil and meant to add dry but forgot to.  We didn't miss the basil in this dish at all.

We had it for leftovers another night but it was kind of dry after reheating.  
I was going to add some jarred tomato sauce or something for moisture before reheating but decided against it.  I would recommend doing that if you plan on having it for leftovers another night.

This is a great meal that can easily be heated for a later dinner. I put everything together in the morning, then put it in the fridge, skipping over the baking portion of the recipe. After when we got home for dinner, I heated it up for about 20 minutes, taking it straight out of the fridge. It's so simple, and even better that the family loved it!

Yummy, fast, easy, filling and pretty common ingredients. All pluses around here! I rarely have cherry tomatoes on hand so I used canned, diced tomatoes from my garden. I'm sure fresh would have a better flavor, but these worked just fine.

This was delicious.  Instead of penne pasta,  I used mini tortellini and I added a few shrimp and some mushrooms.  This will be a regular at our house, especially when the garden is gyiving a bumper crop of  cherry tomatoes.

This was super easy and super good!  I modified the recipe a bit, though.  I used one 15 oz can of tomato sauce and one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I couldn't find any fresh basil so I omitted that ingredient and it was just as good.  I added dried parsley, granulated garlic, dried oregano along with the salt and pepper to give it more Italian flavoring.  I believe the secret ingredient here is the whipping cream.  I increased the amount of cheese used and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top along with the mozzarella.  I love cheese so there can never be too much.  I will definitely make this again!

I really enjoyed this dish.  It is quite flexible - I used a cheddar-mozzarella mix, and parsley instead of basil, as that is what I had on hand.  You could also cut back on the amount of pasta, to reduce carb load, or if feeding fewer people.

Good recipe and the more cheese you add the better.  I do think it would have been even better with a pound of either spicy or mild Italian sausage.

Even my very picky husband loved it!  I did doctor the sauce a little bit by adding some Italian Seasonings and letting it simmer.  But it was quite easy and very good.

It was very good except it needed more liquid. I recommend saving more of the pasta water to add to the other liquid ingredients. When I came out of the oven it was too thick.

This was delicious! I added some mushrooms per other suggestions, and I'm glad I did. I didn't have fresh basil, so I mixed dried in with the onions and mushrooms while they cooked. I also used closer to 10oz of penne. I'll definitely make this again.

Very warm and comforting dish. Yummy and satisfying. Family like it!  I added Italian sausage but it would be fine without it.   Confused about the tomato sauce quantity as I 've never seen 6 oz cans...only 8 oz cans. And 18 oz didn't seem like enough so I just used two 15 oz cans and a can of diced tomatoes.  Wanted to make sure it was  moist enough and it was. Didn't notice anyone else mention this so maybe was just me!

Love the freshness of the cherry tomatoes in this recipe and the two cheeses. Something different than your typical tomato based pasta dish and it tastes great!

Not bad at all for a meatless Monday meal. The only real change I made was to use 1 can of tomato sauce,  1 can of diced tomatoes and dried basil ..  Served with a small side salad and garlic bread.

This was very good! I scaled it down to using 1 can of tomato sauce. I used half and half in place of the whipping cream and probably doubled the cheese. It turned out nice and creamy and gooey with the cheese. I had some Campari tomatoes that needed to be used up, so I chopped them and used in place of the cherry tomatoes. The fresh basil works great here, and I'd add more than what's called for another time. Delicious and comes together very quickly. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is delish! My mother is vegetarian and raved over the flavor of this dish. I would put 5 stars only I used basil pesto instead of fresh basil and threw in fresh spinach for some extra nutrients.

The reason it didn't get 5 stars was the timing is a bit off for prep.  I am a seasoned cook and it took closer to 30 minutes to get the dish oven ready.  Then 25-30 more for baking.  It was delish though

Great but with changes. After sautéing onion and garlic pour some Chardonnay in pan and cook 30 seconds.  For more sauce I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and 5 more oz tomato sauce. Simmered sauce about 30 minutes. With extra sauce I added about 3 T sugar, 1 t oregano, Italian seasoning and parsley. Did not have fresh basil so put in about 1 T dry basil. Red pepper flakes would be a good addition . Saved all the pasta sauce to add to noodles- used a good cup and dish very moist. Can add protein or spices- add wine, fire roasted tomatoes and spices- makes a fantastic dish with plenty for freezing

Great recipe. My entire family enjoyed it.  That said I made some adjustments: 1. Added Italian seasoning to the tomato sauce 2. Doubled the mozzarella cheese 3. Used less pasta than 1lb because the full lb seemed like it would be a bit dryer than we'd like, especially for leftovers.  Adding this to my rotation!

Wow!  Absolutely delicious. I only made a small change:  I exchanged a can of tomato  sauce with a can of diced Italian flavored tomatoes. Still a winner!!!!

We had this dish for dinner last night and again tonight. It's one of our new favorites! I did everything according to the directions except: I subbed campanelle pasta, added sliced black olives and threw a few dollops of ricotta into the sauce with the heavy cream. I baked it in a 9 X 13" cake pan for 20 minutes; next time I'll add 5-10 minutes to get the pasta a little hotter. I'm also planning to add some shredded chicken breast or shrimp next time to boost the protein. Excellent dish, Julian!

Yummy!! I made a few changes but stuck to the main ingredients. I used canned diced tomatoes, a whole can of paste and eye-balled the heavy cream. I did add some spinach to give it a boost of some color! Turned out pretty darn tasty!

This is glorious! I used parmesan, cheddar, and mozzarella both in the sauce and on top, and omitted the extra water as even letting the sauce reduce for a bit still left plenty to cover the pasta just fine in the oven. My husband says it reminds of him of something at Olive Garden, which I will definitely take as a compliment!

This is an awesome pasta dish! It was an automatic hit, with everyone wanting leftovers every day. One thing I would suggest is to use more mozzarella on the top so the dish is coated evenly. Also, we're not big tomato fans so next time I'm planning to leave out the plum tomatoes. The pasta still tastes great without them.

Very tasty!  A few changes:  I cooked the onion almost 10 minutes, used two cups of cheese (1/2 mixed in, 1/2 on top, doubled the tomato paste and added extra sauce.  Will make again!

Added ground beef and spinach to the recipe and it was very good. My wife thinks I need to make extra sauce for serving.

Absolutely marvelous!  I used some locally made whisky fennel sausage in the mix and substituted pecorino  cheese since that's what I had...also used passata for the tomato sauce....

What a wonderful meal!

This  is so good and doesn’t need ricotta.  I added a bit of Italian sweet turkey sausage to make it heartier and it was DELISH.  Will make this often!
