These were OK.  Right out of the oven and coated with the sugar, I thought they were average.  My kids did not like them, but I made some powder sugar frosting and covered the rolls with it and then they would eat them.
I thought the dough was very heavy and thick.  I probably won't make these again.  My husband didn't care for them either, and he eats anything.  Sorry!

A wonderful muffin! Though, I only got 8 muffins (2/3 full) out of one batch. They are best served warm but 10 seconds in the microwave can imitate the oven. They are best served the same day, as the topping will start to age and become moist.  A hint for kids:  make mini muffins as my kids ate the topping and didn't want the rest, until I dipped them in the butter and sugar again. The nutmeg makes a nice addition to the batter.  Wonderful, simple recipe!

I used to make these for my children when they were little and they were always a hit.  Recently my oldest daughter requested a copy of this recipe.  I guess the memories of how good they were haven't faded.
