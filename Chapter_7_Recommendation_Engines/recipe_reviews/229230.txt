I really really wanted to like this rice more, and I think I'll try it again with a few changes.  I made Cranberry Walnut Bread from this site so I could make this rice, and I let the slices dry out as much as they could.  But when I added the bread, the rice became gummy.  I used mushrooms rather than water chestnuts, and I omitted the pine nuts (until the price comes down) but otherwise followed the recipe.  I'll make this again because I do like the other ingredients with the rice.

This was good, but the next time I make this I will definitely cut this in half.

I didn't like this at all. The only changes I made were no pine nuts, and I used plain gluten-free bread with a handful of craisins and walnuts instead of cranberry-walnut bread. The texture was strange, and the flavor of the wild rice completely over shadowed all the other ingredients. There are enough good dressing recipes that I won't try this one again.

This was a very good stuffing recipe for Minnesota wild rice.  I served it alongside pork chops for dinner. You can add or delete items according to your taste and creativity.  The recipe looked huge, so I halved it and it was just right.  I think next time I will add some butter and maybe some sage for added flavor, but it's a keeper!
