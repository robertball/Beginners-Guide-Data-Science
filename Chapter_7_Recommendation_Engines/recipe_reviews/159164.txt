I am mainly writing this review so that some beginner, such as myself, doesn't make the same mistake I did...the recipe calls for ONE Chipotle, not ONE CAN!!!  OMG, my mouth is on fire.  Will definitely try this again though.

I made this last night and it turned out fabulous.  I ended up doubling the recipe because of the size pork roast I had.  I followed the recipe exactly with only one exception.  Toward the end of cooking I added one large can of green enchilada sauce, medium heat.  I divided the batch and took half to my Mom and Stepfather, along with some cornbread, and they loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will be making this again!!

This is a favorite now! I cooked it over the stove & for the meat I used the pork chops & chicken breast I had. I chopped up 2 porkchops(bone & all) & a whole chicken breast & a half YUM..YUM! I cooked it down until it reached a think gravey. It is slighty spicy but oh so good! We had mexican rice & refied black beans as a side. YUM YUM!

This is wonderful.  It tastes so much like some of the food I had while in San Antonio, TX.  We've had it once as the soup-like serving.  I am making a double batch to have some as sandwiches and some in enchiladas with the green sauce.  The first time I added the cumin, but this time I am leaving it out.  I have also left out the green chilies as I do not personally care for them.  Thanks for posting!

I'm such an idiot.  I put in a one can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  The recipe calles for ONE PEPPER.  Don't screw that up.  My mouth is on fire from taking a taste of this.  The whole pot is ruined :(

I say delicious, my counter-part rates it good but not great.  I took another reviewer's advice and added a half a can green enchilada sauce and I increased most items by 1/4 (because I had a larger cut of pork roast).  Also served it with corn bread which was awesome.

I made a less spicy version of this with hominy, black beans, pork, canned tomatoes and chilis. It was a nice flavorful soup, but it needs lots of toppings (tortilla strips, lime, jicama, cilantro).

This was my first time making or even tasting Posole. I did everything by the book. It was nice and spicy and resembled Menudo. It was very easy to make. The taste was slightly bland but not too bad. Thanks

Great foundation recipe. I substituted 2 fresh jalapenos for the chipotle (that's more traditional to me) and doubled the garlic. Next time, I think I'll add some canned tomatoes, too. As promised, it does freeze well. Serve with radishes, cilantro, and a tortilla for traditional New Mexican flair!

Well this was different!  It was plenty spicy, very tasty.  Much more soupy than i had expected.  We served it over mexican rice, might be nice with cornbread too.

This dish turned out wonderfully, but a little too hot for me. I didnt add the green chilies (thank God I didn't).   I wanted to add something to tone it down a bit, but didn't know what to add to it. I did add a can of corn to it as my mother in law doesn't like hominy. Aside from being caliente, turned out great.

I had a 2 lb pork loin roast fillet [I think that's the cut (=]. I doubled the recipe and left out the chicken. I threw everything into the crockpot and went to bed while it cooked. I started on high and turned it down to warm an hour later. The onion wasn't soft after 8 hours, so I turned it back up to high and let it cook another hour. I fished the pork out and cut it up - next time I will cut the meat up before putting it in the pot. I think it could easily take another chipotle pepper. Very good (=

I made the mistake most readers did and used the entire can of chipotle peppers. If you made the same mistake I did and want to save soup, pour the entire soup out including  garlic and onion. Save chicken and hominy. Re add a new can of green peppers, cumin, oregano and broth and rinse chicken and hominy. Do not re add chipotle peppers or garlic. This will save your soup and taste delicious. I made this soup again two weeks later,  following the exact directions using one chipotle pepper and it is so delicious. Great soup to make and have for a cold evening.

...if it wasn't for the Chipotle pepper[s] this wasn't a prized dish by any means, but it could be a great dish for using leftovers. If I ever make this again.., this is doubtful.., I'd try to get as much pork flavor as possible. 
The primary ambition for this New Years day slop-soup?
We made our slow-cooker Pasole with a small pork chop and 1/2 lbs. of leftover turkey, and turkey stock; with this twist into leftover mayhem, the hint of smokey chipotle goodness, and the New Mexican textures is what's best about this dish; we served it strained in a soup bowl. Pretty bland.
The hominy and pork are the keys.

It was way too spicy for me. Other than that it was good. I also think it needed 2 cans of hominy.

This was really good, though i had no chipotles and, instead, used a 16 oz. Jar of Mazetti's roasted green chiles with lime and cilantro. Like a cross between NM green chile stew and traditional posole, yumm!!

Almost perfect for me. I don't get the chipotle pepper adobe sauce addition, though. I added chili pequeno, tomatillos and paprika. Helped me win a chili cookoff!

Love this recipe. I basically had to make this with what I had on hand (live in country).  I had 2 cans of hominy...so, that is what peaked my interest in this recipe. I used 2 small (pretty lean) pork shanks; 6 chicken tenders and 1 can of Rotelo. I did not have the Chipolte pepper or the can of green chilies.  I had the remaining ingredients; threw it all together in my slow cooker and it was one of the best soups I have ever made.  Some friends drop by today and they loved the soup - served with warm tortillas.  I added a dollop of sour cream (to cool it off a bit).   I think the slow cooker really makes the difference with infusing all the flavors.  Thank you for this recipe.  I will make again.
