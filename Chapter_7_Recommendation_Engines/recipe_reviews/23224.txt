THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT. TWO THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THOUGH. FIRST OF ALL THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME ATTEMPTING TO MAKE PRALINES SO I MADE NO CLUE JUST HOW MUCH THE WEATHER CAN AFFECT THESE. IF IT IS RAINY OR THERE IS TO MUCH HUMIDITY, THEN MOST LIKELY THEY WILL NOT SET. WELL THIS IS FOR LOUISIANA, IM NOT SURE ABOUT OTHER PLACES. SECOND, I WAS HAVING THE WORST TIME WITH THESE AT FIRST. I DIDNT KNOW HOW LONG TO MICROWAVE THEM FOR TO GET THEM RIGHT. THEN MY MOM GAVE ME THE BEST ADVICE. YOU TAKE A CUP OF ICE WATER; DROP A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE MIX IN THE WATER. IF IT HARDENS UP INTO A BALL, IT IS READY. IF NOT, IT NEEDS TO BE MICROWAVE FOR LONGER. ONCE I GOT IT RIGHT THESE WERE GREAT AND GONE IN A DAY.

I was a little worried about making these as so many people had issues with the microwave times. I have a 1000 watt microwave and cooked them on high for 4 minutes then stirred, and then cooked another 5 minutes. They turned out perfectly! I'm in Florida, and although its not real humid right now in Dec., these still turned out just fine with all the windows open! I think my best Christmas gift will be seeing the look on my mothers face since she has tried had failed so many times attempting to make pralines! Also, I don't know how you could possibly get 3 dozen out of this recipe, I got 1 dozen smaller than New Orleans style pralines.

This recipe is awesome!!!  First of all, this is so easy.  I made pralines "the other way"-on the stove with a candy thermometer--never again.  Second, the pralines melt in your mouth, are not grainy, and are not too sweet. I did have to perfect the recipe to my microwave, however.  I had to microwave for a total of 12 minutes, and I did not stir for the whole three minutes.  I also must make my pralines too big b/c the most I ever got out of the recipe was 28.  I made this about a dozen times this year for Christmas gifts.  It takes me 20 minutes start to finish.  Thanks!

These are VERY good! Used real butter instead of margerine.  My only problem was that they started to firm up quicker than I could spoon them out...so I dumped it all on the wax paper and separated it with spoons.  Much simpler!

Yum.  Pralines are easy to make in the microwave but you have to watch your time.  I zapped them for 3 minutes to start, stirred, then 3 minutes more.  After that I took them out every minute and checked the temp with a candy therm until they reached 240 degrees, then added the vanilla and did the stirring (it did take 9 minutes of cook time for me).    Three minutes of stirring was just about right.  You want to stop stirring just when they start to look cloudy and start firming up a bit.  Drop them on parchment as quick as you can, the remaining mixture will continue to harden as it sits, making it harder to scoop.  If it seizes up on you or gets too hard, add a spoonful of very hot water and stir until it loosens up.  I used an average sized cereal spoon to scoop and got about 2 dozen.  Try dipping these in the "Hard Chocolate Glaze" once they are cool, it looks very fancy :)

I combined all of the ingredients excluding vanilla, and proceeded to microwave...I had stirred the mixture about 4 minutes into the 9 min time frame, and everything appeared fine, but at 6 minutes, smoke fills the entire house.  Apparently... 9 min. was too long for my microwave...Be very careful!

I used half and half by mistake, and they turned out beautifully. I would coarsely chop the pecans next time so they are easier for the kids to eat, but overall, these are our new Christmas favorites!!

Delicioso!!! I made full size pralines & only got 9, but that's OK! I prefer pecan pieces instead of halves- but either way is yum! The only minor gripe I have is I like them a little firmer- I 'll try cooking them an extra minute or so next time. But they did set up- I had to cool & stir a few times to get it the right consistency ( thick with a dull finish ) I do like the yield of this recipe- no chance of a boil over! Thanks so much!

Not for all microwaves.  After 9 minutes, several of the pecan halves were burned and the mixture solidified almost immediately.  I will stick to the old fashioned way of making them.  Disappointing.

These are pretty good.  I was expecting something more like the ones in the pralines and cream ice cream, but they were still pretty good.  They are really simple to make and turn out well.  Next time I might use 2 cups of the pecans instead of 1 1/2 because it made quite a bit of sauce and was just a bit too sweet for me.

This recipe was terrific because it comes out perfectly with following the directions exactly.  I have passed this on to family, friends and co-workers and they are all trying it with much success.

so easy to do!  I followed the directions exactly (except I used real butter) but was not able to stir for 3 minutes because they started to set up very quickly!  They didn't look so pretty but tasted great.  My second batch I decreased the time by 1 minute and used about 2 cups pecans and they came out perfect, gorgeous and yummy!!  would recommend this simple recipe to anyone!  and I guess I make mine big because I only got about a dozen with each batch.

I almost gave up on this recipe because 1) I changed the heavy cream to fat free half and half, 2) I used canola butter spread instead of margarine, and 3) I have a really cheap microwave that apparently has low wattage.  My result was a runny basically caramel sauce.  I used the time as directed, stirred for three minute intervals (I lost track of how many times I waited 30 seconds).  I reheated the mixture to see if some of the liquid would evaporate, and it helped.  I thought I had the right consistency (it was not as runny), but it did not set and stuck to the buttered wax paper.  However, I was determined to make this work, so I came back to it after a couple hours, scraped off the unset piles of sauce and pecans, and threw it back in the microwave for another 3:30 minutes.  It was really bubbly when it came out, and the bubbles did not dissipate until I stirred it.  I knew something had changed because as I kept stirring, the mixture became stickier and I was not able to scrap the sides of the mixing bowl as easily.  Suddenly, after 4 minutes of stirring, the consistency was semi-hard, but pliable, and that is when I realized that I had a batch of pralines!  I believe the key to my dilemma was the wattage on the microwave and basic patience.  Keep trying if it does not work, it might be that you need to microwave it for much longer than 9 minutes, and you can always put it back in the microwave until it is right!

First I made 4 separate batches. I tried whipping cream, half and half, and margarine and butter. I tried various combinations to see what I liked better. All came out excellent, but I preferred butter with half and half. I am from New Orleans and this recipe is fantastic and just as good as any traditional recipe!! Later I made 5 more batches and this is what happened. The first 2 did not firm up well. I just scooped them back I the bowl and remicrowaved them. They came out great. I then tripled the recipe to make another large batch. I was very careful because I wasn't sure if this batch would set up. I microwaved it about 30 min in all and kept checking and stirring. About 3-4 times in all. I also used the trick from another reviewer and dropped a tad in ice water. When it balled up, I knew it was ready. This was the best batch of all!!! They we're lose enough to allow the praline to spread out like a traditional praline does. Also, on the others, I did not butter the parchment paper and they were fine, but it is definitely easier and comes out nicer if you butter the paper prior. This is a FANTASTIC and EASY recipe!!! I will NEVER make pralines on the stove again!!! Highly recommend!!  Thanks so much!!

OMGoodness!!!!!!!!  I am so tickled! I made these and they actually turned out very well even though I am NOT a candy maker by ANY stretch of the imagination. 

I mixed the sugar & cream, put them in a 5-qt Visions Dutch Oven, (A 3-qt size would have been perfect but I don't have one.). I covered it w/ plastic wrap and cooked it in an 1100-watt Microwave for 11 minutes (I suspect that 10 minutes is enough). I took it out, added the butter, vanilla & warmed pecans, stirred it for 30-60 SECONDS and spooned it out in patties onto a large buttered plate. I ended up making 6 very large ones because the mixture set up very quickly. 

Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I make for a 
l-o-n-g time.  :-)

Everything was fine until I added the Vanilla and then after it finished sizzling it immidiatley turned chunky and dry. I added some hot water and put it back in the micro for 30 seconds and that seemed to fix it. In the future I don't think I'll use vanilla.

These are soooo good! They were gone within hours from my family with orders to make some more tomorrow. No problem--They were so easy to make. I lived in Charleston, SC for 16 years and missed pralines so much when moved to the NC mountains. The local candy shop wouldn't make pralines because we were not humid enough. Ha! This recipe can be made on a dry spring day, no problem!

I'm from the Big Easy and this recipe taste just as good if not better, if you follow the exact directions. I have a family member who is known for making pralines and  I let her try one that I made. She gave me the dumbs up and was in total disbelief after I explained that the pralines were made in 9 min in the microwave.

This is the recipe that my Paw Paw has used for years and he is from the New Orleans area. They are requested in mass orders during the holidays. A few key things to remember: High humidity will delay the sitting process, placing the wax paper on kitchen towels may help. Be sure that the cream (half & half) is very fresh and cold and to seal them in AIR TIGHT containers as soon as they cool to prolong shelf life. If they start to crystalize later, place them in a food processor/chopper to chop up and add to homemade vanilla ice cream or top off your favorite ice cream or desserts with it.

I have never posted a bad review till now! I tried these EXACTLY as the recipe is &I checked my candy with a candy thermometer & the temp.was correct but the sugar was still very grainy &I then when you add vanilla it dries it out terribly!   I would recommend leaving out vanilla completely, cooking longer with leaving the pecans out so not to burn them &their putting them in last. I will stick to stove top!

Followed directions as stated. Very tasty and easy. Ready in 20 minutes or less. My mother who is quite a good cook herself, loved them.

I have a 1300 watt oven, but took a chance because my microwave is my friend!   I made two batches...first one I cooked for 8 minutes total.   It got hard very quickly and I had to add water to make them pliable.  The pecans were tasty, not burned, but also only good for small clumps.   I did another batch at 7 minutes and they came out just right.  For the ease of this recipe over stovetop versions it's worth experimenting with a few cups of pecans even if you don't have a 1000 watter!

Love this recipe! So easy and everyone gobbles them up when I take them places. It takes a little practice to know when to stop stirring and start dropping, but once you get that part figured out, you will find this to be the easiest candy ever and so good!

WOW!  I've made pralines many times the 'old way' and it's a tedious process.  And, no matter how much care you take, they sometimes turn out grainy or won't set up at all. I was really surprised to find that this recipe not only was super quick and easy, these pralines were as good or better than any I've ever had. 
I followed the recipe fairly closely except I used an extra 1/2 cup pecans and only cooked 8 minutes in a 1200-watt microwave.  The pralines were set up and ready to eat in less than 20 minutes and absolutely delicious.

I love this recipe and have made it for years (I use 2 c. pecans and toast them first and I double the vanilla extract).  i think it's most helpful to work quickly while dropping on wax paper before the mixture gets too cool. Suggestion if they start getting dry and grainy before finished dropping on wax paper:  add a teaspoon or tablespoon of water (depending on how much mixture is left) and stir - it eliminates that crumbly graininess right away so you can continue with no grainy dry texture.

I have tried so many times over the years to make pralines on the stovetop. I have never managed to get it right.  Today I was craving something sweet and decided to give this recipe a try.  I used half and half and butter because that is what I had on hand. It worked perfectly. I had to add 3 min and 15 seconds to the cooking time but I'm sure that was due to the half and half being thinner than cream.  I'm so excited! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Actually, I have a question about this recipe. Is this LIGHT brown sugar or DARK? And  someone mentioned covering the microwave bowl with plastic wrap. Do I do this, or leave it open? Thanks!!!!

I guess, all microwaves are different. This did not work out for me. I was really hoping it would work, but was skeptical as I have made homemade praline candies and they have to be the proper temperature and monitored well on the stove-top. This seemed too good to be true and it was. After the first 4.5 minutes it seemed fine. Then, I stirred it and put it back in the microwave and it started burning from the center around minute 6. It smoked up my microwave and smelled up my kitchen. I had to use boiling water to clean the hardened burnt sugar off of the bowl and utencils. Also, not too happy about the waste of good ingredients, especially pecans that are very pricy right now.  I followed the directions here, exactly, is all I can say.

The easiest and best pralines that I have made.  I've been making pralines from scratch the old fashioned way for decades... saw this and tried it, not expecting too much.  But I must say, that I am delighted in the results.  I did "test" the mixture after cooking by putting a drop in ice water to see if I got a soft ball, and I did.  I think the whipping cream and real vanilla is the key.  This recipe made about a dozen 3" pralines.  There is no such thing as "bite size" in Louisiana.

Incredibly easier than other recipes and delicious.  My microwave is slower (850 watts), and the time specified here was perfect, so for a newer, faster microwave, I would watch the mixture carefully.

My "gold standard" in Pralines are those from River Street Sweets in Savannah and Charleston.  These had the same texture and balance of candy to pecans, but were darker in color and the taste from the brown sugar was distinct.  I watched them made at the store, and they used all white sugar.  On my next attempt at this recipe, I will try 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, adjusting until I can get as close as possible to the ones I bought from River Street Sweets, even if I eventually modify the recipe to use all white sugar.  And wow, I'll enjoy the experimenting!

This recipe was excellent as is. Made it a 2nd time and tried stirring in chocolate chips during the 3 minute cool down. Complete disaster! Mxture became crumbly and ugly. Still tasty though :)

THESE=AMAZING!  I only had one cup of brown sugar, so I used 1/2 c. of white sugar.  I also added a splash of Crown Royal from my husband's bar.  I ended up microwaving for 12 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes.  After twelve minutes, I stirred for 3 minutes straight, and dropped onto cookie sheet with my cookie dough dropper.  It made 12 big and delicious pralines, which tasted better than my stove-top pralines.

Very good. The first time I went 9 minutes in my little microwave and had some trouble getting them to set up. So next time I decided to go with 12 minutes..not a good idea. They turned into powder on me before I could get them spooned out. To the consistency of brown sugar :(
Taste was great on the first batch, going to try again with maybe 10 minutes. Using Mini muffin pan this time instead of leting them spread of wax paper.

These did not turn out for me.  Maybe they needed a little less time in the microwave?  The first few seemed like they might be okay (they had a smooth consistency), but the rest were real grainy and got hard really fast.

I just got finished trying these out and I couldn't have stirred for 3 minutes  because the sugar started getting grainy.  Not sure what I did wrong but I will it again.  Mayber one minute less next time.

First time to make pralines.  I followed recipe exactly but mine were very runny, about like a loose pecan pie filling.  Absolutely delicious, but had to be scraped up with a spoon and eaten.  The only thing I can figure out is my microwave (which is not as hot as most) was the culprit.  I gave 4 stars only because of the final consistency, otherwise they are a perfect 5 Star.  If I could figure out how to make them firm up I would make them again and again.  I like the taste better than any I have had.

This recipe is delicious! I can never remember exactly how I made it the time before (did I stir it? Did I cook it the suggested time?) but regardless the flavor is always there. Not one batch has come out the same: some are crystalline, some spread out, etc. but they are always gobbled up without complaint. So while I can't give pointers on how to make it the recipe well, I can say it will be scrumptious!

These were fantastic! I really am impressed with how easy these were to make. I made these for a bake sale so I doubled the recipe, so had to make some adjustments in the cooking time (or maybe it's my microwave) but these were delicious! Thank you, Mary!

Had to try this recipe because we all love pralines so much.  I was amazed at how easy these are to make; I've made them the "hard way" using a candy thermometer in the past.  These were so easy and so delicious I've made four batches in the last few days and given them to my friends for Christmas gifts.  Everyone loves them!  They're as good or better than any I've ever tasted.  Thanks for such a great (and easy) recipe.

Pretty good flavor...I should have followed the directions to the tee. I have a 1200 watt microwave and thought that I should only cook the mixture for 8 minutes per another reviewer's recommendation. It wound up very liquidy and I had to cook it longer. Unfortunately it turned out grainy once it finally got to the soft-ball stage. Will definitely try again, but follow original directions EXACTLY to get better results. Oh! Don't forget to toast the pecans to bring out the richness of their flavor!

Ok, I had to revise my rating after I made these myself.  I made a few revisions because our microwave is OLD, but I cooked for 11 minutes instead of 9.  Followed the directions from there, but to cool them down faster I put the bowl in a cold water bath while stirring.  These came out perfectly.  so good my boss called me to tell me how good they were! Thanks for a great recipe!

Soooo Yummy!! It took way more than 3 munutes to cool off enough, but once I figured out the right consistency, they were perfect. I countn't even wait for them to cool completely before digging in! I also used real butter.

I had to adjust the time for my microwave a couple of times.  The first time, following the recipe, mine hardened too quickly -- before I got them dropped onto the wax paper.  But -- it made a "to die for" ice cream topping.  The second time, it never set -- again, an ice cream topping.  But, now I have got it right, and I love these things.  They are SO easy to make and very very yummy!

The flavor was fine, but texture was like brittle. Also my microwave was smoking. I thought the one person who had made that review had made a mistake but it seems that the pecans are burning in the microwave. Thirdly, I buttered the wax paper and they still stuck to the paper. So just be aware that they will stick to the wax paper and keep an eye on your microwave if you  make this recipe.

These were AMAZING! I did the recipe in an 1100W microwave, and I followed it exactly, and they were really good! The only thing I will do different is that I would definatley make the pecans smaller, and work a lot quicker! I stirred for 1 minute and it was already getting hard.

These are absolutely what I have been looking for for about 20 years since I lost the recipe that I used for my sister in laws wedding.  They turn out perfect every time if you do exactly as the recipe suggest. I made 50 large ones in about 1 hr for my sons wedding.

Super easy, but after adding the vanilla the mix began to dry up almost right away. By the time I got them all onto the paper they were totally dry. But they still tasted really really good, not grainy or chewy at all!

This is one of my favorite recipes!  I am now famous for my "homemade pralines"!  I have a pretty powerful microwave, so I microwave 4 min., stir, and micorwave one minute more.  They are creamy and fabulous.  I have to hide them from my husband or he will eat the whole batch in one sitting!

As a Louisiana girl, I know a thing or two about pralines but couldn't resist the call of making them in the microwave. My microwave has a higher wattage than most, so it only took about 5-5 1/2 to cook.  Here's the awesome part: I used brown sugar splenda and half and half instead of their full-calorie counterparts.... AMAZING!!!  I'm fully prepared to run through the streets extolling the praises of these delicious babies, I'm that impressed.

Great recipe! I use it every year for my Christmas baskets. I follow the recipe and I have never had a batch that didn't turn out! They are so easy and everyone loves them.

I followed the directions exactly & got a crumbly, sandy, hard mass of sadness.  I LOVE pralines & was extremely disappointed that this recipe didn't work.  SAD!

I tried this recipe when I was making a batch of Sugar Coated Pecans from this site (always awesome).  After reading the reviews, I was unsure about the wattage of my microwave so I set the cook time for 6 minutes, stopping at 3:30 to stir, and then cooked 3 more minutes, one minute at a time.  Each time I used the cold water soft ball trick to check, and at 8:30 minutes it was done.  Incredibly easy!!   I used butter as I didn't have margarine and added 1/2 cup of pecans to cut down on the sugar part of each one, and they were perfect.  They got rave reviews from everyone, even folks who weren't praline fans and tried them because everyone else said they were good.  Give it a whirl!

Wasn't crazy about this recipe.  The microwaving time should be adjusting according to your microwave.  My pralines came out hard as a rock.

These turned out great. Note to everyone:Not All Microwaves Are Created Equal. I needed to microwave mine for 11 minutes. Moisture and humidity can also play a role in how these turn out. I combined all ingredients in the bowl at once except vanilla, at the half way mark I stirred then at 9 minutes I saw that it needed more cooking, 2 minutes later I pulled out added extract and stirred until it changed color( a creamy opaque color) and spooned onto waxed paper. Perfect.Thanks Mary

well I was afraid to try this recipe. I tried making pralines the 'old fashioned way' once and they bombed on me. This turned out great! The firmed up and no graininess! I did have to stir about 2X the amount mentioned (5-6mins) A+

Caution!!!  If you scale this recipe in half, please change the cook time.  The Allrecipes.com scaling feature does not do that for you.  I cooked a half-batch for the full 9 minutes and nearly started a fire.
On my second try, cooking four minutes in a 1200 Watt microwave, they were wonderful. Very easy too.

I made this recipe upon getting home from a weekend trip where we had stopped at a sweet shop that made everything from bread to candy.  The pralines were $2.50 each and were quite small!  I found this recipe and it looked so easy I just had to try it.  I followed it exactly except I used  butter instead of margarine and added more pecans.  It turned out perfect and is a definite keeper!

I tried this recipe last night. And it turned out great. It was extremely simple with a beautiful color. My mom is 72 years young and used to the original stove top version. And she loved it!!! So it will be a great dish over the holidays! :-)

I grew up in New Orleans and have eaten a truck load of pralines in my time...this recipe makes the chore easy and tastes pretty authentic!  You will probably have to adjust your cook time depending on your microwave - my first batch was too dry to hold together.  I cut back the time by 1 minute and they came out perfect.  My only other advice is to choose the best quality pecans available...they really will make-or-break the recipe.

Modified to make it dairy free: replaced margarine with 2 tablespoons of Earth Balance buttery spread; replaced heavy cream with 2/3 cup coconut vanilla milk beverage (So Delicious) and 1 tablespoon of creamed coconut (Let's do Organic brand).  Also, I roasted the pecans at 400 for about 10 min (till they smelled roasted) before adding to mixture.  After the microwaving, I did put mixture in a saucepan over the cooktop to further tighten the liquid b/c without the heavy cream,  it needed a little more cooking.  DELICIOUS!

This is a great recipe - worked as is for me. I didn't change anything except I took it out of the microwave at 8 mins , 30 secs and stirred at 4 mins. I also stirred mine after I took it out and it started to harden before I had them all on the waxed paper. It's a lot like making fudge, you have to pay attention to the timing and consistency. Much easier than making them the old fashioned way!

Fast, easy, and perfect. No need for a candy thermometer AND no need to change any of the ingredients or instructions. I made these on a cold & snowy winter day and they were gone before they were completely cooled.

These were very easy and quick to make.  They also taste very good.  I like mine to be soft and more creamy and these were a little very sticky and chewy.  Be careful if you have fillings in your teeth.  They are still quite good though.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so easy you can afford to blow the first batch (some darn fine ice cream topping it was. I am from La. and thought it couldn't be done with pralines, but it's a bona fide microwave recipe. Watch your time -- don't go much beyond 234 degrees, and you may need to cut the last stir step to 2 minutes. Don't be tempted to overdo the pecans.

I tried these and they were a flop. Surely I did something wrong because they had a five star rating. They set up too fast, turned black and even smelled burned.

Very tasty. However, mine needed to cook longer and took longer than 3 mins to thicken sufficiently. I added some extra nuts and that helped. Family loved them. The recipe made 36 very small pralines, but they are quite rich - a little goes a long way.

If I would have written this review last year, it would have only gotten one star.  The first time I made these, they were way too runny and waiting the extra 30 seconds X4 did not help at all.  This year, I followed the recipe to a t - but I read a review about adding the other 1/2 a cup of pecans - that was the clincher.  These are delicious and living here in the VERY HUMID state of Mississippi, they set up like a champ.  I recommend those living in other humid states to add the extra pecans, it might make a world of difference.  I bet my coworkers love these tomorrow as much I have tonight!

I spent some time in Chaeleston South Carolina. These are very popular there. That was 4 years ago, and I think about there pralines all the time. This may sound goofy since these are made in a microwave, but WOW they are really good. They taste very close to the ones I ate in Charleston. Great recipe!!! Absolutely delicious.  Make these you won't be sorry.

For quick and easy (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3), these were pretty good.  However, they really don't compare to the Texas Pralines found on this site.  They taste OK but are grainy and crumbly.  I may make them again if I'm in a pinch.

Great recipe.  I had to microwave mine about a minute longer.  I also added an extra handfull of pecans.  Very easy, simple recipe.  I will be making these again.  Next time I might try microwaving half the time and using it as an ice cream topping.

Wow!  I always thought that you had to buy pralines, now I can make them in my own microwave in 15 minutes.  I have a small microwave and I used 11 minutes, no burning or any problems.  I had to stir a little longer than 3 minutes for them to cool, but they set up perfectly and they are delicious!

Ok so the other reviews made this sound so easy and yummy, but, unfortunately, when I tried this recipe it burned everything! I don’t know if everyone knows how bad brown sugar smells burnt, but it stunk up the whole house and it took almost 24 hours to get the smell out of the house. I love pralines and it would be great to make it in the microwave, but I think I’ll stick with the old fashioned way; on the stove. Thanks for sharing though.

Delicious...but you definitely have to drop them fast once they reach the right stage (as I think is the case with all candies).  Amazingly good flavor from a microwave candy!!

Oh my...I had to run back to the store and get more pecans because I ate too many and there weren't enough to take to work!! Other than using butter instead of margerine (because it was all I had) I followed the recipe exactly. These are fabulous...and so easy!!

Because microwaves vary so much, I would recommend giving these a second shot if they don't turn out exactly right on the first try.  I think at 9 minutes mine were a little overdone, and the mixture was a little too stiff when I spooned it out.  Nevertheless, I'm astonished at how easy it was to turn out great tasting pralines in a matter of minutes, and I will make these again.  I couldn't bring myself to use margarine and substituted butter.

Had trouble with overflow in the microwave, but what remained was just as good as other reviewers say.  Despite the mess, I'd be willing to have another go at this--anyone know how large a "large" bowl is?  I used a 3quart pyrex and still got runover. Thanks!

This recipe is soooooo easy. I chose it because I don't own a candy thermometer...and my husband and I LOVE pralines!!! They were wonderful and creamy, and RICH!!! Not grainy at all! The microwave time was perfect, but it took a bit of time to get the mixture to thicken. BE PATIENT!!!

I made the following modifications:
1 cup cream
1.5 cups DARK brown sugar
Stir for 1 minute, wait for 1 minute...repeat until mixture thickens...this took about 6 rounds of stiring and waiting.

I've made a number of praline recipes, all fairly successful - but this was by far the easiest and still tastes wonderful.  Like several others I had to stir about 6 minutes instead of 3 and I added 2 T more cream for a creamier style - terrific recipe!

This came out pretty well.  I am not much of a cook, but I needed to make something for a work function.  After putting them on the wax paper, I found that they were still a little soft, so I put them in the refrigerator overnight, and people at work loved them.

Overall, very good and easy.  However, be sure to use a glass bowl for the microwaving (my sister used plastic and it was a disaster!)  Even though many people seemed to have a problem with getting them to set up - mine set too fast and I followed the directions exactly.  Next time I will only allow to cool for 2 mintues before spooning onto wax paper - they tasted great but did not look very good because they had cooled too much.  I will make again and maybe add a bit more pecans!!

My first try at these went ok.  I had no problem getting them to set-up, but they seemed dry or grainy.  After reading some other reviews, I will add more cream.  I also think I made them too big.  They are way too rich to be much bigger than bon-bon size.  The recipe is good enough to try again.

The success of this recipe depends entirely on how your microwave cooks.  I've made pralines on the stove and they turned out great.  So I thought this would be a faster easier method.  I followed the directions exactly and had the exact opposite result of other reviewers...mine didn't "set up".  I kept stirring to cool the mixture and as it thickened I kept trying to make the pralines.  Finally after stirring a good 10 minutes, I just put the rest on the wax paper and let them run.  After two hrs I scraped half of them off the paper and put in a jar in the fridge for ice cream topping.  The others I left on the counter.  By morning they had set up enough to eat.  They taste wonderful, but the process was not what I expected.  I'll try again... cooking longer maybe.

EXCELLENT!  BUT...when I made them, the hardening during the three minute stirring period.  I had to add more heavy cream and microwave them a few more minutes to get them runny again.  Next time, I won't let them sit as long as the recipe states...YUM.

I've tried this recipe twice in the last two days.  The first try came out okay but was a little drier than I like.  For the second try, I used three-quarters of a cup of heavy cream instead of two-thirds of a cup.  This made the candy a bit smoother and glossier.  Also, being a Southern girl with lots of pecan trees around me,  I made them a little larger than the teaspoonful.  I ended up making about 18 each recipe.  I had no trouble with burning pecans or batter being runny.  I will definitely make them again.  NOTE:  This website does not identify slashes or maybe even other characters other than numbers and letters.

I have made this recipe several times.  I use a mix of brown and white sugar and I drop the candies onto a buttered baking sheet.  I think it's a great recipe--You have to check your microwave wattage though.  Mine is 850 and this recipe works well--I tried another recipe with a cook time of 13 minutes and I got rock.

Easy to make.  I used a 1 qt pyrex bowl in a 1000 watt microwave.   I extended the time to 101/2 minutes.  I live in Atlanta with 40 degree temp outside today.  Hope you will try it.  Excuse me the pralines are calling my name.

Fire hazard! The first batch I made using the nine minutes cooking time, stirring half way through, was the best I ever made. I recreated this recipe but I added the 12 minutes of time as suggested by another reviewer to see if my batch improved. Just after the 11 minute mark, stirring at the 4 and a half mark, I could smell it burning. Opening the door I could see the spread of black, burnt sugar spreading over the top of my glass pot. I got it out and into the sink. If I had it stayed near, this story could have been far worse. Disagree or not, do NOT cook this beyond the original nine minutes. It truly ends up delicious.

OMG! This is the best recipe and so easy! My husband said these are so good and he is not a fan of pralines at all! I followed the recipe and roasted the pecans for about 5 minutes on 375 before adding to the mixture. I live about 2 hours from New Orleans and always look forward to buying pralines. I will make my own from now on. Thanks for sharing!

It took much too long in the microwave. I gave up counting my repeat 4 minutes in the microwave in order to get it to the hard ball stage needed for pralines. It tastes grainy, but I like it anyway. i had to mold them with my hands after they cooled. Each one was runny when putting on wax paper.
Sorry , they did not work out and I did use a 950 watt microwave.

These were absolutely wonderful.  I made them for Father's day;  I used half & half & real butter,   cooked for 3 mins, stirred, cooked for another 3 minutes stirred,  tested by cold water bath, not done yet, cooked another 3 mins, rested 1 minute, tested, they were ready.  Stirred for 2 minutes and they were too hard,  like other reviewers,  I added hot water and stirred,  perfect!  my looked like the pictures shown.   I'll make again, probably for Christmas.

Being born and raised in New Orleans I know how to make pralines. This recipe may not be quite as creamy and smooth as conventional top of the stove methods, but so what!  SO much easier and quicker!  No back breaking stirring over the stove to get to "soft boil" stage that may or may not set.  My mother may be rolling over in her grave - but this is too easy and too good to pass up.

Excellent Recipe! Instead of the microwave I went straight for a medium sauce pan follow directions to the "T" but instead of the microwave heat on the stove top for perfection every time stirring semi- continuously allowing to boil rapid over medium heat for about 5 minutes.

I make these frequently, with these adjustments
-toast the pecans for a few minutes in oven or toaster oven, before beginning.
-use butter instead of margarine
- 3/4 c. white, 3/4 c. brown sugar
 As you stir, as soon as they begin to thicken, IMMEDIATELY, drop by large, serving spoon size, spoonfuls onto parchment or waxed paper. It makes 12 regular praline sized candies.

I thought this would make good use of the cream left over after T-giving and some rock hard brown sugar (dang kids never close the bag!).  I followed the recipe fairly closely although I did monitor the temp with an instant-read thermometer and it took the full 9 minutes in the microwave.   I only mixed for 2 minutes and it started seizing up  when I had scooped out about 2/3 of it.  I only got 2 dozen but they are very tasty and the consistency is perfect (although the last few are kind of ugly)

Super easy. I followed recipe as written and they came out great. I like them a little crumbly with lots of nuts. I'll be making these again.

Certainly does not make 3 dozen.  I got about 15. 
Otherwise, absolutely lovely. So delicious! It's a good thing I don't normally keep pecans on hand or I'd be making them all the time, they're so easy...

This is a perfect recipe when you need something sweet last-minute. I made mine the night before I needed them for a Mardi Gras party. They were perfect, since I didn't have enough time for anything more challenging. But despite how fast and easy this is, they taste almost like the real thing! I'm impressed.

Perfect for somebody without much culinary experience, too. This is a tough recipe to mess up, I think.

My only criticism apart from the amount yielded would be that some may prefer to use pecan pieces/chopped pecans, as opposed to the halves. I like the big pieces, personally, but I know a lot of people don't. Really, it's personal preference on that front.

I did just as it said, except I couldn't stir for 3 minutes. I believe I have a powerful microwave. I would not cook them as long next time. Also, it said it would make 36 pralines. I got about 12. Could have stretched it to 15 but they were really hardening too fast. I may stick to cooking on the stove or try cooking for 6 mins. They taste fine, but they are dark blobs, not smooth like they should be. I should have read the reviews first.

really yummy! everyone at our family Christmas loved them. There was advice I followed about putting the mixing bowl in an ice/cold water bath.  I wouldn't do that next time because, though the first 3/4 or so turned out great-smooth and matte, the others were too cold-so they looked rough and were not attractive. Thankfully they tasted the same though.

Wow. I've never made pralines but I've eaten my share. These were so easy and very delicious. I used butter and stirred for about 5 minutes. I ended up with 12 good sized pralines. Delicious. I'll add these to my Christmas goodie bags. I think everyone will be very impressed.

Great!I did use real butter instead of margarine as well as the ice bath recommended by others. Added some Amarula cream liquor with the vanilla before stirring. Either I didn't cook it long enough or the alcohol just prevents it from setting as firm. Soft or not, they were still delicious.

I usually follow the recipe exactly as it is written the first time and tweak later if needed for my tastes. Had to use 1/2 cup of white sugar because I ran out of brown and I used butter. Cooked in my 950 watt microwave in a 2.5 quart bowl for 10 minutes with no burning or bubbling over. I added the pecans after the cooking time and I forgot to let it rest. They still turned out like they were suppose to. Seems like a pretty fool proof recipe to me.

Took these to a New Orleans party at the home of folks born and raised there.  I asked what they thought - and she would be honest - both husband and wife thought they were better than what they normally buy there to bring home.  She asked for the recipe!  My only modifications:  I used chopped pecans, and I only cooked for eight minutes.  It did take longer than three minutes to cool enough - about six, I would say.  I made them small for the party and got 32 pieces (and came home with none.)   If this recipe doesn't work for you the first time, it is definitely worth trying again using some of the modifications suggested in the reviews.  This recipe is going in my "favorites" file!

OMG is right.  Made these for my sons wedding rehersal dinner. What a success.  They were perfect. I have never made pralines before or even really ate one. But wanted an Mexican Dessert to give to the wedding party and family. Everyone raved about them. Be careful though, they are addictive and you will gain weight ratherly quickly. I made no changes to the receipe or directions given.

This were super delicious, my first attempt at making pralines of any ilk.  I did use butter, 'cause I have no use for margarine unless I intend to lube my car!  I did 4 minutes, stir, then 5 minutes, checked with the cold water for softball stage, did for one more minute.  They were a little grainy, but not bad, and who knows, with how I did them perhaps that contributed.  All in all, an excellent, almost instant dessert with minimum fuss and only a couple of dirty dishes!  ;-)

I thought these were a little sweet and sugary but this is my first foray into Pralines period.  After commenting to my mother that I thought they were sugary she said that is what Pralines are like.  So I guess just not for me...but I am giving them in my Christmas basket for people.  They were extremely easy to make and I can't wait to see what others think of them. Thanks!

I followed this recipe to the T however the pralines were still very runny (thinking it was the heavy cream that caused this) and never hardened.  They did smell good however since I added 100% pure vanilla from Mexico, ummmm.

These are very easy and just delicious. I, like another reviewer, cannot see how I could have made 36 pieces. I got about 14 very small pralines.I used butter rather than margarine and cooked only 8 minutes. GREAT

These are very good, but for my microwave the time of 9 minutes is too long and they set up too fast.  I will try them again and cut down on the time.

This recipe is pure joy.  My children absolutly love love love these nuts.  The delicious sauce atop the nuts just warms their little cockels.  I think the only thing that is missing is some rum.  All in all this is a lovely recipe and I would like to make love to you for creating this.

This recipe is fantastic. I used real butter and cooked for 8 minutes and they turned out great. Thanks so much!

These tasted great but I must have a really powerful microwave because they were way over-done after the recommended microwave time - they were almost black!

I really loved this recipe. So much easier that the traditional way. I used chopped pecans so I could distribute them more through out the candy. Thank you!

This recipe came out very well for me as written. It was easy and very tasty.  I will no longer drive in town to pay $10 bucks a pound for pralines!

I just made these and they were great. I did have to stir the mixture about 5 minutes instead of 3 and it still looked runny, but I decided to spoon it out anyways and they set beautifully. It only took a few minutes for the pralines to harden. Very good and very easy!

Ok, this time I only stirred for about 2 minutes before spooning them onto a silicone baking pad...they turned out great.  Not the least bit grainy.  This is a keeper.

These pralines are great!!!  They take no time to make, but they don't taste like it.  My family loves them so much that I made two batches in two days.
