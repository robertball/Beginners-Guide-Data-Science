These were pretty tasty and would make them again next time without the ranch dressing mix.  It made them a little too salty.  Next time I will roll in garlic olive oil and wrap in the bacon.  Depending on the size of your potatoes you might need more bacon.  I did par boil my potatoes - cooled and then wrapped them in bacon.  They can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator.   They are a bit fiddley to assemble - but easy and fast to grill.  Keep your eye on them though so they don't go up in flames!   *** Yes, these can be done in the oven.   Might make for a tasty appetizer.

I made these for a Labor Day party and changed up a few things, but frankly this is a winning combo that would be hard to mess up.
I made about 75 for the party (they were gone within 1 hour) so I ended up baking them in my oven.  Just too many for the grill.
I used baby golden potatoes that I poked with a fork after washing. and placed in a large zip lock back with vandalia onion dressing, fresh ground pepper, a splash of evoo and let sit overnight in the fridge.
I wrapped the potatoes with thick cut bacon (tucked the ends on the underside) from GFS (my fav) in the morning and again placed back in the fridge until I was ready to bake.  This helped the bacon to set around the potatoe nicely without using toothpicks.  I baked them at 400 for about 45 minutes and they were perfect.  I served with a side bowl of 'Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce"
Next time I might sprinkle with some finely shredded cheddar cheese at the very end of baking, or maybe try these with a bit of brown sugar sprinked on top when rolling up, and just before placing back in the fridge.
As I said, this is just one of those recipes that whatever you do, it will be great tasting, and make you look like a wonder in the kitchen!

HAW - thank you for sharing this recipe.  It is a great addition to any meat being cooked on the grill.  I served these with the Recipe Group choice this week - Marinated Flank Steak with Peppers.  These were so delicious - family loved them.  And, they were easy to make.  I put on metal skewers rather than the toothpicks.  It worked great.  Already thinking ahead to when I can make these again.

These were so good.  I used reduced sodium bacon which was very thin.  I didn't use the ranch, instead I added pepper, dried chives and granulated garlic.  Also, I baked them at 400 and the bacon was crispy.  Avoid my mistake--I tried to put the toothpicks through the edge of the potatoes at first which resulted in broken off, embedded toothpicks--oops!

These were DELISH! Everyone loved them. We used turkey bacon and wrapped the entire slice of bacon a round it. A little piece of heaven.

I fixed this recipe with some minor additions and it was a huge hit. I added garlic powder, black pepper and Mrs. Dash Spicy seasoning. I would recommend using 1/2 strip of bacon rather than 1/3. I wrapped fingerling potatoes and 1/3 was not enough bacon to fully wrap. It also took longer to grill than 20-30 minutes... more like 40 minnutes, they were placed on a veggie grill tray rather than directly on the grill. Hard to turn with toothpicks. While I'm no longer a big bacon eater, I would still make this one again. Delicious and it got lots of positive comments from the party-goers last night!

These were fantastic! I par-boiled the new potatoes and then instead of using ranch mix (which I find too salty) I coated them with olive oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper and then wrapped them with thick bacon (Wright's) and baked on a broiler pan in the oven for 20 minutes or so at 400 degrees. We dipped them in sour cream and they were to-die-for. Thanks!

Very tasty and so easy.  I did make some small changes.  I used a full strip of bacon for each potato and also used small red potatoes.  I followed another reviewer’s suggestion of not using the ranch dressing.  I was doing other things and not watching them closely which caused me to burn some of the potatoes, but they were still excellent.

Great idea for entertaining! I adapted this recipe by cooking my potatoes in the oven at 375 for about 35 minutes or until the potatoes were soft. I also cut a sweet potato into 1 inch thick pieces and wrapped a whole strip of bacon around it. The sweet potato won on the taste test! I also sprinkled fresh rosemary and sage over the bacon wrapped potatoes which added a nice flavor and smell.

Loved it!!!  My whole family enjoyed them.  They were very simple.  I read the other reviews but I didn't think it was neccessary to "pre-cook" the bacon.  It cooked up beautifully!  Next time I will add garlic...a new family favorite!!!

I read all of the reviews and made some changes based on what I read.  I pre-cooked the potatoes and bacon, just a little, in the microwave.  Wrapped the bacon around each potato and threaded 3 potatoes onto a skewer.  These were OK, just not as flavorful as I would have liked.  Won't be making these again.

I made this recipe tonight.. It was a hit. I used baby red potatoes. Boiled them in the skins for approx 5 minutes then cooled. Wrapped each baby potato with half a slice of bacon and finished in the oven at 450 for approx 30 min... or until bacon is as crispy as you like. I did not use the dry mix, just potatoes and bacon. Here's the complete recipe: https://gardensandgrills.com/2016/10/12/bacon-wrapped-baby-potatoes/

These potatoes were very good.  I parboiled mine and put them on skewers instead of toothpicks, leaving room between each so that the bacon could crisp.  Very well received by family and guests.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, hungryallweighs!

Super simple and tasty with the bbq sauce.  I did use the seasoning that the recipe called for and didn't think it was too salty.  In fact, I think it could have used a touch more flavor.

We liked these better without the ranch dressing.  Next time I make them I am going to make my own seasoning mix to sprinkle on them and some parmesan cheese.  I would also precook the potatoes before grilling.  The options are endless with these, they make a great side or an app.

I melted butter in garlic in a sauce pan. Put in some fingerling potatoes & stirred. I did not cook the potatoes. Let them cool in the butter then wrapped them in bacon. Grilled slow on the grill & they were delicious!  The garlic & butter gave them the flavor I was looking for. The bacon was crisp. I dipped them in light sour cream. 
I will make them again for sure!

I had high hopes for these (I mean, they've got bacon!  And ranch!), but they were definately the low point of our meal this evening.  I gave them a "3" and Mr. LTH a "4", so I'll round up to the 4.  As is evident by my yucky photo, our bacon didn't ever get crisp (Mr. LTH has issues w/bacon and the grill...I'm not sure what the issue is as I happily leave the grilling to him).  Assuming that's just a Mr. LTH error, I still wasn't thrilled w/the flavor of the potatoes.  Mr. LTH loves anything potato, so he thought they were "good".  While I'm glad we tried these, they won't become a part of our regular potato rotation.  THANKS, hungryallweighs!

I love this recipe but I tweaked it just a little.  Although the Ranch dressing on the potatoes sounds great, I skipped this part all together. I did not dress the potatoes but I did sauté them in a little butter and oil then once they were browned a little I sprinkled them with some black pepper and onion powder and drained them on papper towel.  I then wrapped them in the bacon an threw them in the oven for about 25 minutes until the bacon was cooked, browned and a little crispy.  The potatoes were nice and soft and fluffy inside; their skins were a little crispy because I had already browned them first before I wrapped them in bacon.  They were gone in seconds after being put out on the table!  Very yummy!!!

I made a simple change with the Ranch mix which added more Ranch flavor to the potatoes themselves rather than mainly flavoring the bacon. I poked the skins of freshly washed red potatoes really well, sprinkled the Ranch mix to taste directly on the still damp skins so the flavor would soak directly in to the potatoes and then wrapped with the bacon. Thank you for a fun and tasty recipe!

We loved these.  My potatoes were a little larger than bite sized, so after par-cooking them (I steamed them) and wrapping them in par-cooked bacon, we tossed them on the grill to crisp them up.  This was a huge hit with everyone at my table.  We skipped the ranch mix on the potatoes and served them instead with a blue-cheese-ranch dip and they were fantastic.  I'm pretty sure this will be asked for again and again by my family.  These would also make a great appetizer for any party or gathering and could easily be cooked in the oven if the grill is not an option.

Made this and they were delicious.  I used the cheaper store brand bacon which was fattier and I think the fat really soaked into the potatoes making them delicious.  I had to cook them a little longer, more like 40 minutes because I had the heat too low but they still came out fantastic.  Thank you for the recipe

Easy and delicious! I did par boil, then bake the potatoes instead of putting them on the grill. After baking I broil them for a few minutes to crisp the bacon. I used thinly sliced bacon, which made wrapping easy. The thin bacon also crisped well. I used fingerling yukon golds. My personal favorite. The sweetness of the potato really worked with the ranch. I noticed quite a few people changed up the spices. I wouldn't. I think this is a wonderful dish, spiced perfectly! The family loved it! Thank you so much for sharing!

Love, love these little bites of heaven!  I made these in the oven and because I strongly dislike ranch I tosses them with pepper, garlic and italian seasoning.  I forgot to watch the time and left them in about an hour so the bacon was nice and crunchy and the potatoes were creamy.

These were very good-the men in my family liked them more than the women.  It was probably the bacon.  I'll make them again and maybe use fingerling potatoes-am always trying to find recipes for those!

Love these!! Family favorite.  We use small red potatoes or butter potatoes.  We also prefer coconut oil to the olive oil.  I use a blend of Italian Seasonings as well.  Use Creamy Italian as a dipping sauce.  Delicious!!

I was a little short on time, so I boiled my new potatoes for about 8 minutes, then sliced them in half and put them in cold water so I could stand to handle them! I drained them and coated them with olive oil, then rolled them in ranch season mix (recipe on this site). I warped 1/2 slice of bacon around each, using toothpicks to hold the bacon on. Placed the taters on a broiler pan, sprinkled grated sharp cheddar cheese on them and baked them for about 20 minutes.  I took these to a pool party - everyone loved them!

Easy and painless!
No wonder we made it as part of a Mother’s Day dinner everyone enjoyed. 
Kids dipped in ketchup, while adults added to their entree!

Wonderful recipe!  Made these as an appetizer with a few changes. Infused olive oil with rosemary, garlic powder, a small amount of the ranch dressing and pepper. Par boiled the potatoes and poured the olive oil mixture over the potatoes.  After wrapping potatoes in bacon poured remaining olive oil mixture over all and let sit in refrigerator for a few houses. Baked for 45 minutes. Definitely will be making these again.

Based on other reviews, I did not use the entire Ranch packet.   I did coat the potatoes with olive oil prior to wrapping and seasoning.   They cooked up great and turned out just as they should but I wasn't blown away.

Quite delicious. I wrapped half pieces of bacon around fingerling potatoes and put them on a skewer. Grilled over low heat for about 30 minutes, turning frequently. Had to keep moving the skewer from the fire flareups due to the bacon, but that's part of the fun of grilling.   This is one of those times where the sum is greater than the parts.    I will definitely make this again.

Mine went up in flames.  Medium heat.  I should have read the reviews first.   Don't think I'll try these again.

So delicious and easy, only thing is some of my friend are on low carb diets. i found this amazing recipe that is basically the same but uses fish wrapped in bacon.
