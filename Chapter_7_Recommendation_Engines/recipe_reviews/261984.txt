These were easy and good. After tasting the cream cheese mixture I decided to add some garlic powder and that bumped up the flavor. What I liked most about this recipe is that the ingredient amount was perfect. Typically I end up with way more filling than there are jalapenos and that is a pet peeve of mine. This one was perfect but I do think it needed the garlic powder.
