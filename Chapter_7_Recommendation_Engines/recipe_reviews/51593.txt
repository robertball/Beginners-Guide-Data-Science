Delicious! Added extra zucchini and an extra clove of garlic. Processing the basil leaves and garlic in a mini-prep processor made that task really easy.

We used a lot more vegetables than was listed. Also used broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower along with the zucchini and tomatoes. We didn't have any yellow squash but that was ok. It seemed very healthy with all the vegetables so I liked that just as much as I like the taste of this.

Very delicious! My whole family loved it! I used it as a side dish with hamburgers. It made a complete meal, and I was very pleased with the way it complemented the juicy, delicious burger with three slices of onions, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and of course mustard, ketchup, and a large pickle.

It was good, but I think it could have used just a little bit less balsamic. Other than that, it was good. This is a great choice for someone looking to eat lighter or fit more veggies into their diet.

This was delicious, just what I wanted. I added mushroom and some chili's to give it a little kick.

This was good! Nice, light, and colorful. I added a bit of onion salt and mushrooms. I also served with the Chicken Scampi II recipe from this site.

Not a lot of flavor.  It is a nice light dish.  Would make again, but next time add some more garlic and spices as well as more fresh veggies.

I couldn't use the parmesan, so it wasn't as good as it could have been. This was nice, but not outstanding.  With a larger pasta in place of teh angel hair it would hold the sauce better.
