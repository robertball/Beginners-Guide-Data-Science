Very good! It tasted very similar to pumpkin pie, with the consistincy of mousse.  I used about two and a half tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice for the spices listed. Very low fat, will make again!

This recipe is much easier than it may look from the instructions and ingredient list. My boyfriend said it tasted just like pumpkin pie, and he would have thought it was if it had a crust. It's very creamy, but way fluffier than pumpkin pie. My only complaint is that I just about overdosed on all the spices. Their flavor was overpowering, and they take away from the mousse's smooth texture. Next time I make this (and I will definitely make it again), I will either use pre-made p.p. spice, or I will reduce everything except the cinnamon by half.

This was easy and perfect for an early fall dinner. I could make it the night before and simply carry them out of the fridge  without little prep. One guest event questioned if I had made this myself. I garnished each with a dollop of whipped cream and a drizzle of maple syrup with a ginger snap on the side. 

 Delicious!

Really good... and pretty easy.  I did make some changes.  I reduced the honey to 1/2 cup and the white sugar (whipped with the egg whites) to 2T.  I also doubled the vanilla, and cut all the other spices in 1/2.  I also used 1 cup of cream to dissolve the gelatin in instead of milk... and used 2% milk for the rest.

I served the mousse with crumbled graham crackers and whipped cream to a group of preschoolers and they LOVED it!

This is an easy recipe to make but the flavor was simply lacking for my taste. I found the egg whites needed more help and added 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar to help increase the lift. The Crystallized Ginger overwhelmed this dish, I would omit this if I choose to doctor it up the next time. Ginger is a very strong hot flavor, I don't suggest using it at the bottom of the dish. If you must use it, finely chop up, only 1 tbs, and place it throughout the Mousse. Update: Dec 16,2010 two cups of mouse still sit in my fridge. Not a huge hit in a house where food is KING. lowering stars to two.

This mousse tastes just like the middle of pumpkin pie, but is light and fluffy.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the separate spices and it tasted delicious!  This has become a fall favorite.

This is a pretty complicated recipe for what I thought was an average/ok end dish.  I used it as a trifle and layered it with whipped topping and crushed gingersnaps.  It was well received but a bit heavy; maybe not the best way to use it. Not sure how I'd modify it just think maybe there's an easier way to get there. Still it was delicious and turned out exactly as the recipe described.

Just made this recipe. It is very tasty but MUCH TOO labor intensive/time consuming.

The instructions need to be rewritten to denote systematic order of procedure.

I eliminated the sugar, and cut the honey to just 1/2 cup.  That is sweet enough for my family!  Great tasting spices are in this pumpkin dessert!  I'll be making this again!

Absolutely wonderful!! Followed the recipe except for the mace, as I didn't have any. Next time will try with a 1/2 c of honey, just to make it a little more "guilt free". Definately a keeper!

Bit disappointed.  I've never made a mousse, though there's nothing here I haven't done before.  I love pumpkin and like pumpkin cookies, bread, muffins, pancakes, etc.  So I expected something else of this.  (Maybe I just don't like mousse.)  It was OK - I didn't dislike it, though I wasn't fond of the texture.  Someone else who tried it really liked it and said it was like creamy pumpkin pie.  (I disagree.)  I decided not to be influenced by her opinion, simply cause I'm the one who had to make it, and I just didn't think it was worth it even if she liked it.  Getting egg whites to stiffen takes patience, and add that to everything else - I wouldn't mind if I liked it better.  I have issues with the recipe as well.  Ingredients out of order is a major beef for me, and really, how hard is it to get them in order?  I don't understand "until there's no big bubbles" - it's on heat - it just bubbled more, not less. (???)  And the "alternative" instructions were confusing - is this an alternative to unmolding onto a plate, or an alternative to using a 6-cup mold at all?  I chose to pretend it was the former, refrigerating in a bundt pan and then spooning into serving dishes before serving.  I'm not sure I even see it as a choice cause it was too soft to "un-mold" on a plate.  (I used the gingersnap crumbs in the bottom since I didn't care to buy crystallized ginger, but I didn't see the point to it.  Well, I had some extra cookies to eat anyway.)

I gave this 3 star since as it is its ok.  I however, made a pumpkin pie "slice" by putting graham crackers into a pan, spreading with the mousse topping with another layer of graham crackers and cool whip.  This was excellent (would have been better with ginger snaps layerd instead of graham crackers!)  The way I served it I'd give it 4 stars.   All in all its only ok on its own but used to make something else its very good - it would be a good filling for a gingerbread cake too!

Oh my, this was absolutely delicious!!  I didn't add quite the full 3 tbsp of white sugar, and next time I am going to leave out the mace (I used only a few small pinches, but it still overpowered the mousse with a cloying peppery taste... not a fan) and further reduce the cloves to just a few small shakes.  Light and airy, like a deliciously smooth pumpkin pie filling without the guilt!

Don't add the vanilla until after you remove it from the heat (it isn't one of the "spices" added with the honey.

Our guests liked this mousse! It is an excellent substitute for pumpkin pie. The only probably I had was getting all the egg whites folded into the mixture. In the end, I just left some of the tiny white blobs.
