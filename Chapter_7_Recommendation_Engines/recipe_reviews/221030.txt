This is awesome!  I added lemon vinegar at the end for a little kick but wow!  Even my boys chomped this down.

The amount of vinegar adds a whole LOT of pucker. Maybe a little fresh ginger and soy sauce would help even out the flavor a bit and cut the vinegar to about half.

I made it with the ingredients in my fridge, fresh black soybeans (kuromame) and komatsuna leaves instead of bok choy. I prepared 2 servings so divided the quantities by 3. I also used less dressing and balanced the acidity of the sake vinegar with sugar (1tsp sugar to 2tbsp sake vinegar and 1tbsp sesame oil). It was delicious, thanks Sonya.

OOOHHH!  The rice wine vinegar in this recipe made us all pucker!  I find it hard to believe that kids would eat this as written.  Thanks to Julee's review we took her advice and added some soy sauce and that made it more palatable, but I also added 2T. of sugar.  Really disappointed.

Really liked this, so did my husband. I didn't  have sesame oil and forgot when I was at the store, also did not want to buy black sesame seeds when I have regular so used those. I also added green onions. So good, next time I'll add tofu. I did not think the vinegar was too strong. Thank you. And I'll make sure to pick up sesame oil.

I didn't add as much sesame oil. Instead I used a heavy tablespoon of sesame oil and the rest was vegetable oil.

Excellent recipe. I will make it again!!

delicious recipe!! I would suggest using more daikon, carrots and bok choy (almost double the amount) and using only 1/4 cup of rice vinegar. Subtle flavor and will make a bigger serving and will still taste great.

I sliced my radishes and carrots instead of shredding them. Didn't have much flavor to it, I skipped the salt.

Terrific! I too reduced the amount of vinegar and the overall amount of dressing, but it was really good.

I can't imagine drowning this in so much vinegar and oil! Trust yourself. Use the same base ingredients, but tweak it for your own tastes. I used a lot more of the cabbage and bok choy and only 1/3 to 1/2 of the vinegar and sesame oil. It's still a bit stronger than I prefer on a salad, but it's quite tasty.
