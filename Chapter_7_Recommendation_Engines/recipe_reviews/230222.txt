Just made these to send cross country for xmas.He is a fan of fig bars so thats why I tried these. I cut down on amount of o.j.concentrate and thesae were still very moist. I love orange but I found the concentrate overpowering. Next time, I might use half apple concentrater. I added a little brandy to spirit them up but definitely need more.Also increased the spices.

I did use apple juice concentrate and a bit less on the orange juice concentrate along with some spiced rum, but kept within  total 6 ounces.   I found that this amount of liquid made the mixture way too moist and had to add coconut flour.   Next time I would put in some liquid, mix together to determine how much is truly needed.  Very yummy!
