Fantastic dressing that I have made many times now. I never used vinegar or sugar before but it really gives blah old potato salad some zing. I used to throw out potato salad after a few days but I never have any leftover now. I never add the carrot or pimento or parsley and only add the celery when I have it. I have though, taken to mixing this dressing in a small bowl beforehand. I have always had a bit of a time, either making my potato cubes too hard, undercooked, or too mushy and they mash up too much when trying to blend in the dressing ingredients. Pre-mixing the dressing in the bowl, I can cook my potato cubes fairly soft and then gently fold in the pre-made dressing only to toss the onions, celery and potato cubes and eggs togehther and just coat with the dressing. A perfect chunky potato salad!

I have been making potato salad for 20 years and never had anyone rave over mine before -- this recipe is a keeper.  I made for 125 for a wedding reception and a company picnic and it was gobbled up -- I used lowfat mayo and it still tasted great.

This is wonderful potato salad. The dressing is creamy and flavorful. Most people won't have to change a thing. For my family's personal preference I used 5 hard boiled eggs, mashing up the yolks into the mayo mixture, for a eggy tasting dressing. I also added another teaspoon of grey poupon mustard, left out carrots. Thanks so much for a great potato salad, Mary Ann.

The dressing or sauce as some reviewers referred to is what makes the difference in this potato salad.  I have been making a similar one for years (just the way my grandmother and her daughters made it).  My potato salad has always received rave reviews, always requested by my children for special dinners or if I just have not make it in a while.  Our preference is to add boiled eggs and more onions, celery, chopped pickles and pimento, otherwise it is just potatoes with seasonings.  I also did not see what just a little amount of carrots would add to the flavor.  If you like celery, also add some celery seeds to the dressing before adding to the polatoes.  If you will sprinkle the vinegar on the hot potatoes, they will absorb more flavor and defiitely add the mixed dressing to the hot potatoes so they will absord the flavors, then chill.  Good basic recipe, just adjust to your own liking and enjoy.  Note:  After reading the original receipe over several times, because I just could not understand the no eggs and the small amounts of the other vegetables, it clicked, these were just supposed to be flavorings for the sauce or dressing and as other reviewers indicated, they added eggs and more vegetables, otherwise it is just sauce on potatoes, but very good sauce and it just makes sense to cut the potatoes into serving size pieces prior to cooking.

Be careful not to use to large of potatoes, or they will not be done. Cut them in half. Boiling time needed to be a bit longer, about 45 minutes. Good taste.

Great potato salad. Made a few changes...No onions (I hate them), no pimento (didn't have any), no carrot (didn't have any) and celery seed instead of celery (I am not fond of the crunchy texture in a potato salad). I know it sounds bland but it was still GREAT! There were no left overs!

This is really, really good!  I chopped up a hard-bioled egg in the salad as well, and used a couple of tablespoons of fresh parsley.  Will definitely make it again.

This was probably the best potato salad I have ever had. The dressing was very creamy and there was plenty of it too. I cut my potatoes into bite size chunks before cooking. I used onion powder and left out the chopped onion. I did add 4 chopped eggs to this. I left out the carrot and the pimento since the relish had pimento in it. Ran out of mayo so 1/2 was mayo 1/2 was miracle whip. I used the whole stalk of celery. Everyone made a comment on how delicious this dish was. This is awesome stuff! Definitely this is going to get a lot of use this summer!

Aside from the fact that this recipe is obviously wrong, it made a very tasty salad. There is no way that the author intended for there to be only 1 Tablespoon of celery or 1/2 teaspoon carrots, right??  So I added a stalk of celery, omitted the carrots, only used 2 T of sugar, and added a handful of fresh parsley. It was very good, and I will make it again.

This is probably the best potato salad I have every tasted.  It is not real quick or easy but well worth the work.  I made it for the Labor Day weekend and everyone loved it.  Thanks!

This a good basic potato salad I have been making for some time now.  I first saw it years ago on the 'Top Secret Recipes' web site as a copy cat version of "KFC Potato Salad".  It is very close in taste to the KFC version.  If you like their's, you will like this.

My family has been raving about my potato salad for years and it's a basic requirement whenever I'm invited topicnics to bring some along.  I basically use this same recipe except I don't use sugar (it's a personalpreference) but I do add several chopped hard boiled eggs to my potato salad.  EXCELLANT!!!

Delicious!  A couple of changes I made was that I added more celery, carrots and onions than the recipe asks for to give it more texture.  I also used a spicy mustard.  In the end AMAZING.  Highly recommend this potato salad.

The BEST potato salad hands down!  Made it the first time as written and the only change I made the second time was no celery, as I don't like celery.  This is not something I can make often as I love potato salad, and this is the best I've had...so I will eat it till it's gone!  Great recipe!  Try it for your next get together!!!

I loved this recipe.  I made a few changes.  I replaced half of the prepared mustard with dijon mustard, added 4 strips of crumbled bacon, and dill pickle instead of relish.  I used slightly less sugar and slightly more vinegar.   This will be my go to recipe for potato salad from now on!

I never liked any potato salad I made until this I tried this one. Soooo easy! I boiled the potatoes whole until just done and used yukon gold potatoes. I cut the potatoes into chunks after they were cooked. Not only did the salad taste fantastic, it look so pretty too. I added extra mayo and sprinkled paprika on top. Thanks for finally giving me a recipe I can make with confidence.

This is the exact flavor that I have been looking for. I used two celery ribs, diced very small. I did not have carrot or pimiento. My potatoes were cooked in 15 minutes because I cubed them before boiling. I served this with zesty slow cooker chicken barbecue, which I found on this site. If I didn't have to share with hubby, I would have eaten it all!

I come from a family in which my mother's (now deceased) potato salad is legendary.  I was surprised by how good and simple to make this one is.  I did increase the onion, grated carrot and celery and added hard-boiled eggs, but I don't think it changed the flavor overall with these additions.  Great recipe, Mary Ann!

I have now made this potato salad several times and it always gets great reviews. The first time I made it I didn't have white wine vinegar so I just used regular white vinegar which was still good but the white wine vinegar gave the dish a smoother taste. I don't add the carrots or pimento but I do add 2 chopped up boiled eggs because we like eggs in our potato salad. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the first potato salad I've ever made and it turned out delish! Changed a few things to suit my personal taste: First, cut the potatoes into squares before boiling them; it only took about 7 - 8 minutes until they were done. I think this makes them cook more evenly. Second, I left out the pickles and onions, but added some hard-boiled eggs. Used regular vinegar instead of white wine, since that's what I had. I also used light mayo to save some calories - can't tell any difference anyway and since I didn't have time to chill it, I served it room temperature, but still it tasted great! I may try adding olives next time. Thanks for the great salad!

This was a little time consuming for me since I minced sweet pickles, red bell pepper, celery, and onion to make the potato salad, but it was well worth it.  It tastes just like it comes from the restaurant, or even better!

This recipe was really good. I did not add the sugar. It's totally not needed. I also did not add the pimento or white onion. I replaced the regular mustard with dijon mustard. I also added fresh parsley and some celery seed. Very nice. I will make this again

I took this to a family event yesterday...when I was supposed to make Mom's recipe for potato salad.  Everybody raved about this version and it was the first thing to go!

An excellent basic potato salad...I've been looking for the right one for some time.  I added 4 hard-boiled eggs and little more pickle relish.  Thanks Mary Ann

I'll be the first to say right off that I've never been a fan of potato salad.....it has to have a certain taste/texture for me to take even a second bite.   But after I read all of the ratings/reviews for this recipe, I had to give it a try for our big July 4th family cookout.  I was nervous about making it because my husband first of all normally hates the stuff, and second, I've never been what you would call a very good potato salad maker.  Not only did my husband devour this potato salad, but so did all the rest of our family and guests, even a 15mo. old!  Everyone was helping themselves to seconds, even thirds until the serving dish was empty. 
I didn't have pimento or fresh white onion on hand, so I used dehydrated minced onions, and omitted the pimento.  The flavors and textures mingled together to make the perfect taste.  This was so much better than I've had in a restaurant.  This was some good stuff :)

This is a keeper, with a few modifications.  I doubled the recipe, used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, and used Dijon mustard. I used white pepper instead of black pepper (looks nicer and is a bit milder), and added half a chopped red onion instead of white onion. (I dont think white onion would compliment this recipe, but green onion or sweet vidalia would be good).  I also added hard boiled eggs and mixed the dressing separately, smashing the hard boiled yolks into it as another reviewer had done.  I omitted the carrot, celery and pimento too, and added celery seed.  This recipe tastes even better the next day, so is a good one to double so that it can serve as a side on a dinner for a hot summer day, and a picnic the next day.

Best potato salad I have ever made. I only had 1 lb of potatoes so I haved the recipe. I still used a little less mayo and no pimentos, but I didn't miss them. Better than most restaurants!!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I weighed and measured everything perfectly but I knew something was wrong as soon as I mixed the potatoes with everything else. The end result was potato salad soup! I chilled the salad in the fridge for a few hours hoping it would thicken but it still had way too much dressing. Luckily, I had extra supplies and quickly cooked and added another russet. It was still pretty sloppy and I had no more potatoes so I added quite a bit more of the other veggies. It was still too mushy but by this point I think it was partly due to over mixing. I will definitely use this recipe again as the taste was exactly what I was looking for but I will use 3 pounds of potatoes instead of 2 and increase the amounts of the other veggies as well. I recommend this recipe but I would highly suggest having a few extra potatoes and veggies on hand just in case your tastes are like mine.

Even without the celery, pimento, dried parsley and carrot (I didn't have the first three on hand, and I'd never had carrots in potato salad and didn't see the need to add it), this recipe was great.  The flavors balanced perfectly, and best of all -- because I left out four ingredients -- it was incredibly quick to make.

Very, very tasty...i left the pickle out of the dressing. I tasted the dressing without it and found it sweet already.  I cut the mayo with non-fat greek yogurt. 50-50. The dressing tasted like a yogurty sweet mustard.  So i put in some more vinegar to balance it.  And 6 sliced eggs, we love eggs here...Cheap protein and ooooh so good in a potato salad.  I chopped the carrot, small crunchies rather than strings.

I made this salad for a fall pig roast and it was fantastic. It was gobbled up and gone in no time! I omitted the carrots and pimento and doubled the onion and celery. I also added 2 chopped hard boiled eggs. A++

Very good potato salad recipe. Not as bland as many others can be. I shredded a whole carrot and added it because I liked the shredded carrot idea, added nutrition and made the salad a nice color.

This is a new staple in my recipe book! Thanks MaryAnn for putting it online for us! Everyone I know is shocked by how great the potato salad is!  I used fresh parsley and fresh ground pepper. I have tried different variations of chopped scallions or chopped fresh chives on the top for extra flavor and color. Either way it turns out delicious! I will double it next time I make so that there is enough to have left overs!

I like to browse recipes and see how people cook..1/2 teaspoon of shredded carrots? miniscule amounts of celery and onion? Can you even taste them? I don't understand the rave reviews.

Delicious!  I agree with other reviewers that the quantity of some ingredients needs to be adjusted (1/2 tsp. carrot for example) but otherwise this is a keeper.  Every time I make it it is gone in a flash.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe to the letter and was pleased with the outcome, with the exception of the mustard.  Next time I will leave it out just didn't care for taste, therefore... 4 stars.

I was hoping to find "the" perfect potato salad recipe, but this wasn't it.  Was extremely bland, and even after "tweaking" and refrigerating to allow flavors to blend, was a disappointment to everyone at our cookout.  Will keep searching!

This was a very tasty potatoe salad and everyone loved it.  The only thing that I did different was that I omitted the olives, and put less mayo in.

I had not made potato salad in years, but when a friend was having a barbeque they know I like to cook and no one was willing to make the potato salad, so he asked me.  Let me just say, this turned out so good, and others at the party were saying "not sure who made this, but its awesome" Not one bite was left!

I had increased the recipe for a full 5 pound bag of potatos, and followed everything else that was listed in the recipe, even the carrots only deviated with using partial dill relish, partial sweet relish.  I really do think the vinegar and sugar made the difference.  I will be offering to make potato salad again for cookouts and making it more at home as well!

The 5 stars is due to this: I followed reviewers advice and added 5 boiled eggs as well as omitted pimentos and carrots and used celery salt in place of minced celery. Absolutely to die for!

I don't usually like to change the recipe and then review it but I didn't have sweet pickle relish , so I used dill pickle cubes and also substituted white balsamic vinegar because that is all I had.... it was FANTASTIC!!  My son who usually doesn't eat potato salad loved it and my daughter said it was the best I had ever made!  Will definitely make it again , can't wait until the next picnic we're invited to... I will be bringing this!

I have never been able to make potato salad as good as my mom but this one is pretty close. I left out the pimento and carrots. I also added chopped boiled eggs and doubled the celery. I will certainly make this again.

Amazing is all I can say.  My new favorite and yes, I used the tiny bits of onion, celery and carrots the recipe called for and it was perfect.  I thought they would be lost, but they weren't.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This wasn't bad, I made it exactly as written omitting the carrot.  However, the second time I made it, I left out the relish and sugar as well as the carrot.. I don't see the point of adding sugar honestly. Instead of just pimento I chopped up green olives with pimento inside, about a handful, and I added one hard boiled egg chopped up. This turned out much better, and my kids who normally hate potato salad loved it.

I needed a quick potato salad for a family gathering and came across this recipe. After hearing all the great reviews I just had to give it a try. And I must say it was terrific!!! I doubled the recipe with just a couple changes. I used regular vinegar (no white wine available) and left out the pimento (didn't have any). I also used the "mini" white potatoes and left the skin on because I like the texture of the skin. I made sure to prepare it a day before the event so that the flavors would really have time to blend together. Everybody loved it and went back for seconds (or thirds!) I will surely be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I gave 4 out of 5 stars because I did make a few changes. First I doubled the recipe because I'm making this for a BBQ tomorrow. I seasoned the water that I used to boil the potatoes with salt (A very neccessary step to making anything with potatoes) and because I did this, additional salt was not needed. I used 1 whole celery stalk, 3/4 of a medium yellow onion, fresh parsley, and a handful of shredded carrotts and chopped them up finely using a food processor. I made the dressing on seperately using 1 1/2 cups of Light Mayo, a hefty squirt of yellow mustard, 1 tbsp of white wine vinegar, fresh ground black pepper, and 2 tsp of paprika. Paprika gives it such a unique taste and I always wonder why more potato salad recipes include it. It makes a wonderful garnish as well if you sprinkle to top when your done. This was my first time making potato salad and it turned out great. I'm so excited to have everyone taste it tomorrow at the St.Patty's day bbq I'm going to. I'm actually debating whether I should use green food coloring to make the salad green...? lol.. maybe next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

we love this potato salad.  I make it often in the summer.  I refuse to buy potato salad in the store because of the weird aftertaste.  This is perfect!

Yummy!  This is creamy and delicious. Used Splenda instead of sugar and didn't have carrots.  Instead of pimentos, added 2 tablespoons of pimento cheese spread.  Tasted great after 24 hours in the fridge.  Thanks.

My husband loved it! He raved over it, and had a hard time putting it down. I did follow other users' advice and added two hard boiled eggs, replaced minced celery for celery flakes, and used grey poupon mustard)

My daughter said "Mom this is the best potato salad I have ever had"  and we have had many different versions.  The thing I like most about this recipe is that the dressing does not overpower the flavor of the potatos.  I made it pretty much as written, just increased the onion and celery a bit.  I made the dressing seperately so I could fold in only the amount I wanted.  We don't like ours soaked in mayo.  It was a good classic, southern, summertime potato salad just like you use to get at church pot lucks!  This is what potato salad is suppose to taste like.  Forget all that fancy mixed in stuff.  Keep it simple.

Great potato salad. Everyone loved it. Few changes though: used red potatoes with the skin on, omitted the carrot and pimentos and added hard boiled eggs and bacon bits. And I ran out of white wine vinegar so I used rice vinegar instead.

I loved this recipe a lot.  The only things I added were corn and sweet green peas with diced boiled eggs.  I did not use the vinegar but it was delicioso nevertheless. Thanks Mary Ann for a great recipe.

I am not a big fan of potato salad and have never liked any potato salad I have ever made but this was very good.  I don't see the point of adding carrots since it called for such a small amount.  I didn't have white wine vinegar and used distilled white instead (it was still good). The next time I'll try it with red onions.

This is the best! I leave out the veggies but a definite keeper. Depending on my mood sometimes I'll add a bit of dill which blends nicely with the other flavors.

I have not even attempted this recipe yet but already I had to leave a note- when you bring up potato salad recipes her little memo mentions white corn in the recipe but I don't see it listed once you actually bring up the recipe! I really wish mary ann benzon would proof read her recipe especially since it seems like reading other reviewers there might be other mistakes w/ this one.

It was hard for me to rate this recipe because I changed a lot to my taste.  But it turned out perfect to me so I guess that means it was a good base recipe.  Instead of 1 cup of mayo I used 2/3 cup and then 1/3 cup of mixed yellow and dijon mustard.  I used finely chopped pickles instead of relish.  3 tsp. of sugar instead of 4.  1/2 large onion (or more :).  1 large stalk of celery. No carrot or pimento.  Very good.

Pretty good.  Added 3 hard boiled eggs, 1/4 tsp dill, 1/4 tsp celery salt and 1 dill pickle diced.  Omitted celery, carrot, pimento and sweet relish.  I thought it was a little to sweet for my taste, but my husband thought it was perfect.

I have tried a number of potato salad recipes from AllRecipes, and this is the best! All of the flavors blend together really well so that there isn't one overpowering taste-not too vinegary or mustardy like some potato salads can be. Excellent!

I wasn't impressed with this potato salad dressing.  It is very basic and I've had much better.  Also - potato salad without eggs and celery???  I added both but still don't think I'll try this one again.  Sorry!

I have ended my search for the perfect potato salad! This is the 4th potato salad recipe I have tried from allrecipes.com, and this is the winner! I didn't have relish, so I left that out (but I can't wait to try it). I also cut the potatoes into cubes before I boiled them which really cuts down on the boiling time. I only used 1 lb of potatoes (and cut the ingredients in half) but I kept the amounts of vegetables the same because I like all of the extras. What a colorful potato salad! I used red onions because I love the color. This is a GREAT recipe!

BEST potato salad ever. Have made this several times adding boiled eggs, more celery, more onions, no carrots or pimentos. I love it warm (when first made) just as much as chilled. I don't think it gets much better than this!

This is close to my standard recipe and it's good.  I usually slice a couple of carrots into 1/4" rounds and add a couple of chopped hard boiled eggs. I cook the potatoes, carrots and eggs in the same pot since they take about the same amount of time. Instead of relish I use about a half cup of small sweet pickles which I cut into 1/4" rounds. I substitute low fat sour cream for half the mayo.

This is a top notch recipe!  Everyone raved.  I've since used the dressing for egg salad and it was fantastic for that as well.  Thanks for a superb recipe!  My search for a great recipe for homemade potato salad is over.

I cut back on the onion a bit as I felt it overpowered the other flavors.  Once I did that, the flavors balanced out beautifully.  The pimento gives it that restaurant taste that I was after.  Don't skip on the pimento.  I've used both fresh celery and celery seed with great success.  This recipe is easily tweaked for personal taste, so don't be afraid to experiment.  If you prefer dill relish intead of sweet, go for it!

Great recipe, Mary Ann!

I've made this several times now when feeding a crowd of people.  I have found that it is the safest for everyone's taste buds.  Sometimes I use dill pickle relish and it still tastes great.  I always get asked which restaurant this came from.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!!

This is delish!!!! I couldn't keep my hands off of it. I put more minced onions in. The relish and onions just work off of each other. I put 1/2 c of shredded carrots in and that gave it a slight soft crunch that it needed. Will make this again and again.

Whether you follow this recipe exactly or omit certain ingredients, this potato salad is hands-down the best you can make. I have been coming back to allrecipes.com for years just to look up this specific recipe again. I am very picky with potato salad and quite the simple person (so I tend to keep out the pimento and relish) but have made it both simple and exactly the same as the recipe. This has been a favorite at parties/bbqs and will continue to be!

Love this recipe.  I always sub light sour cream for half the mayonnaise.  Whenever I make this for a crowd, I go "full dress".  Today, I was only preparing half the recipe for 3 and I needed to go shopping.  I made it without carrots, celery, and pimento.  Other than sprinkling a touch of celery salt (instead of salt and I know they're the same), I made do.  I also made the mistake of tasting it after it had been refrigerated for a few hours.  What makes this special for me is the combination of mayo, sour cream, mustard, and white wine vinegar, sprinkled with parsley.  Keep your potato chunks fairly large (boil them, but cool them in the fridge, covered, at least overnight), and what a treat.  The only thing is, I have to come up with more potato salad in the morning for my few guests.

The flavor was good but could have used even more zing.  15 minutes was not enough time for the potatoes - some of them were not done and were quite hard & crunchy.  I'd recommend 20 minutes.

Really quite good.  A little different from my usual potato salad, but a nice change.  I like the exact measurements.  Usually I just wing it.

Really delicious - I almost gave it four stars because it's not my ideal potato salad -- but that's not fair because it's such a solid recipe.  I will add more vinegar or mustard next time -- I just like a little more tang.  Otherwise, it was awesome and everyone loved it.

Awesome! This truly is a great cold potato salad. Great flavors going on in this dish, and is a great side to lots of summer meals. I omitted the carrots and pimento's due to preference, and doubled the mustard. Also added a few hard boiled eggs. I will use this recipe from now on every time i make potato salad. =)

The best potatoe salad ever! I don't like relish so I used pickle juice, didn't add pimento and used raspberry vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.

Absolutely fantastic! Way to go Mary Ann, my wife and I just loved it.  As a 'potato' salad, it stands alone in it's class as 'best potato salad'.  I've always loved that KFC potato salad and bought it on many occasions for our BBQ's.  Tried the store type but it like KFC were nowhere as good as this recipe.  It's got a wonderful thick creamy texture and a mouth watering taste that makes it stand out in it's class.   This is a solid base recipe that can take on many changes and still come out tasting great.  Cooking those different size potatoes to a uniform texture is quite a feat so I now do as others have suggested, I peel, cube and then boil.  They cook faster on the stove or in the microwave.  I hate cubing potatoes so I slice the peeled potatoes into half inch slices and then pass them through a $5.00 hand held french fry cutter and voila, perfect cubes. Thanks Mary Ann.

This recipes is by far the best thing to come into my kitchen! My boyfriend and I LOVED it. I made the sauce separate, so that the potatos would stay cubed longer, and I didn't add celery, pimentos, carrot or parsley just because I didn't have them. But it STILL came out AWESOME! Thank you for this recipe Mary Ann Benzon.

This has become my favorite potato salad recipe.  Several years ago I was looking for a recipe to take to a family gathering.  I did change this just a bit and did not include the pimento.  I also included a cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese and broccoli flowerettes.  It was a big hit with no left overs!

I have tried this recipe twice and like the sweetness it has. I think 1/2teas. of carrots is pointless so I've added more both times. Good recipe, not the best but worth keeping.

WOW, this turned out well. Used less sugar. Maybe 2/3 amt in recipe. Dried dill instead of dried parsley. Skipped the pimento because I didn't have any but can see how that would really and an extra layer of mild flavor. This is a GREAT recipe that can be tinkered with and still get great results. Used Miracle Whip...jar was near empty, loaded all ingredients into jar and shook it> Dumped dressing onto potatoes and mixed, added some olive oil to release rest of jar contents. Very good stuff!!!

I just made this and it's fantastic! I had a few bites before I even put it to chill and I didn't want to stop snacking! Yum!  Addition: I've now made this several times for various events. People rave about it!

This is really a good recipe. I did,however, add about double the onion and celery and left out the pimiento only because I did not have any. Still in all, a big "thumbs up"!

I used 2 pounds of small red potatoes, unpeeled, half the amount of sugar, omitted the onion (due to guests' preferences) & pimento.  I added fresh Italian flat parsley, some garlic salt & garlic powder, and sliced black olives.  Hadn't made a potato salad in many years; thought this turned out nicely.

This was a tasty, basic potato salad. You can certainly cut the mayo to 2/3 cup or less. Go heavy on the salt and pepper - otherwise it's bland.

Excellent recipe. I like this with a some hard-boiled egg cut in slices on top. A sprinkle of papirka adds color. Great

A KEEPER!!!  We love it!!! - Didn't change one thing.  My favorite potato salad was Octoberfest German Potato Salad from this site.  I've made it dozens of time - now I have two that I love.  They both have completely different tastes so it will be nice to change back and forth!  Thanks submitter!!!

This potato salad is perfect and so simple.  I left out the celery & carrot because some in our family don't like any crunch in their potato salad. I had never made potato salad without eggs before and didn't miss them a bit.  This will be my only potato salad recipe in years to come.  Thank you Mary Ann!

Excellent!  Just what I was looking for!  I used Kraft Fat-Free Mayo, which tends to be sweeter than regular, so I cut back on the sugar (adding it as needed at the end).  But what a perfect blend of flavors.  This definately goes into my recipe file!

Made this on a whim for the 4th of July. I used red wine vinegar and dijon mustard. Didn't have carrot or pimento. Still we loved it and thought it was every bit as good as a more time consuming German potato salad I usually make. Will definitely make again.

I just made this and it's delicious. The only thing I changed is I added bacon and pearl onions. I didn't add in sugar since I thought it didn't need it. I recommend making this.

LOVED IT!  So did my very picky family, who always said my mother's potato salad was the only one worth making!  This required very little effort, other than peeling the potatoes, and the taste was great.  You can add extra mayonnaise if you want it super creamy but you take the chance of drowning out the remaining flavor.  I wouldn't change a thing- and I used white potatoes, which worked beautifully as far as texture.

Finally, a yummy potato sald with no eggs! I cube the potaoes and leave the skins on some of them and then boil. They cook in about 5 minutes that way.

I've used this recipe twice now, changing it up a bit each time. I don't have access to sweet pickle relish, so I just cut up baby sweet pickles into tiny pieces. This gives more tang per bite, which I like. The first time, I left out the pimento (once again, no access to pimento in my little remote island). This time, though, I used canned green chiles instead. Yum! Gives a little bite which is great. I also add generous amounts of salt and black pepper and a tiny bit of paprika.

This was nearly perfect! A few ingredient adjustments here & there (less sugar, more onion & no parsley). Great side dish for any occasion... Thank you for sharing. But- adding a few hard boiled eggs really makes the difference. With the eggs, it is nearly perfect... And paprika.

I made this for our July 4th weekend BBQ, and it was good. I have to admit that I tend not to like potato salad, so I may not be the best judge of the recipe, but wanted to make something traditional for my Japanese friend. I made it without the pimento, parsley, sugar, or pickle relish; and with substitutions of coconut vinegar for white wine vinegar, red onion for white, yogurt for the mayo, plus a few dollops of mayo and dried dill. It needed a little more kick, though. Maybe some more dill and celery next time, plus paprika?

This was a hit in my house. My dad can't eat eggs. Try to find a recipe without eggs is hard. You don't miss the egg in this recipe. My husband is not a fan of potato salad, but even had seconds. So I rate this a 10, a must try!!!

Absolutely loved it! This is my families favorite potato salad and I never have any left. I did make a larger serving size and put more carrots and celery than called for nd added onion. NOTE::::-- IT IS EXTREMELY EASIER TO MAKE THE DRESSING ON THE SIDE AND ADD TO THE POTATOES.

I was looking for a potato salad this evening for packed lunches. I just so happened to have all the ingredients for this one. I just found it way too sweet. The next day, fortunately, it mellows some with the other flavors. The problem is, this potato salad is really just potatoes and mayonnaise. It is also quite heavy on the dressing for my personal taste. I did end up adding some sliced boiled eggs, and garnish, to at least dress it up on top.

Great recipe. I wouldn't change anything, except I cannot eat raw onion, so I substituted onion powder which worked well. I'm excited about this recipe. I made it for 4th of July.

Fantastic! This is my go-to potato salad for every BBQ and the bowl is always scraped clean. I don't use the carrots because I don't want to buy a bag for so little and I put dried minced onion in for the onion flavor without the crunch. Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy!  Made exactly as written.  Only change I made is I added 3 hard boiled eggs chopped up to the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

Quadrupled for a crowd of 30 and there wasn't any left! Made the potatoes the night before by cooking whole (skins on) in a big pot then draining and refrigerating overnight. Chopped up in the morning. Mixed all other ingredients then folded in the potatoes. Omitted pimento and added a smidge more carrots for color and texture. Thanks for sharing!

Really good but the potatoes are suppost to be cooked for longer. I did it for 20 mins, I say cook them for 30 mins and I used non sweet pickle relish. I dont like my potato salad sweet and did half the sugar they recommended.

This is such a fantastic home made potato salad.  I have made it several times now, and always get rave reve reviews.  I can't stand pre-made potato salad, so I always make my own.  And I always use this recipe.  :)

I'm not too fond of pimento (even without pickle relish, it tastes great) so I didn't use any but I must say, I have been coming to this site for the longest time and find myself always coming back to this recipe. This is the best potato salad I have ever had and everyone who's tried it on my end, agrees.

This is very similar to the recipe my mom has made for years. I use Cains maynaise and omit the sugar, pimentoes, carrots and parsley. It 's my favorite- all other potato salads taste so dull in comparison!

Loved this recipe. I've been cooking for 35 years and have never been crazy about any potato salad, this one wins!  I will say though, that you must add hot potatoes to the dressing for best results. I changed a few things.  I did half of a white onion, half the relish, fresh parsley, half the sugar. a little less mayo and added about a half cup of sourcream and three eggs.  I think any variation of this recipe will be great.  Delicious, the longer it sits the better.  5 stars

This was delicious!  I used half red potatoes and half yukon gold, omitted the sugar and used light mayo and everyone loved it! Just be careful the red potatoes cooks faster than the others. I think my dad ate half the bowl:)

I loved this recipe and will make again.  I omitted the pimento (bc I didn't have any on hand) and although I used sugar the first time as written I will omit it next time as it make the salad too sweet for our liking.

Overall I like it but I felt like the relish was too overwhelming. Next time I will omit it completely. I also added hardboiled eggs.

This was really good! I wasn't going to use sugar, since I thought it would have been off, but after tasting it I realized it would def. need some. Added a small dash and it really was just fabulous. I love it.  I'm editing to add in my changes and the reason for 3 stars:  I used red potatoes instead of Russet, red onions instead of white, apple cider vinegar since i didn't have white wine (added to the sweetness, which lessened the need for sugar), skipped the mustard since I didn't have good dijon and skipped out on Pimento. Because i'm not too fond of parsley I subbed it out for cilantro instead. over all it was pretty good... i was hesitant about the relish, but that was a nice taste.  I didn't measure a thing and just eyeballed every ingredient to make sure it balanced out with the ton of potatoes I made. (large family!!) I definitely think that increasing the amount of the veggies is necessary!!!

I adore potato salad! I could never quite make it as good as my Mom makes but with this recipe, I can! I think it was the addition of vinegar. I doubled the recipe and added 6 hard boiled eggs. I also added some diced up dill pickles (because the men in my house love them). I peeled and chopped up my potatoes before boiling them. That way I didn't have to worry about some potatoes being done before others. They all cooked evenly and then I let them cool before mixing in the pre mixed dressing. Thanks for a great recipe.

First attempt making potato salad - made it with TEN pounds of my own, home grown potatoes (also first time growing) for my annual family reunion.  Came out nearly perfect, just overcooked the potatoes a bit. Size variations on them made it a bit difficult. Otherwise, excellent. Was a big hit, and REALLY tasty! This one's a keeper

Excellent recipe, you wouldn't think that the small amounts of some of the ingredients would make that much difference, but they each brought a subtle flavor to the party.  It's easy to adust this to your personal taste, but try it once with all the listed ingredients.  My boyfriend who thought he didn't like potatoe salad likes this one.  Rather than boiling the potatoes, I rubbed them with olive oil and baked them.  I like the flavor and texture of the potatoes better this way.  After baking, you can remove the skins or leave them on.  Oh, and use good quality real mayonaise.  It does make a difference.

The essentials are here. Just tweek a little and add a hard boiled egg or two and more carrots and celery (shredded). The relish is the secret ingredient.  Add a little more of each ingredient and if the potatos come out too hard make the dressing in the side for an easy fold in.  I left out the pimentos and did not miss them.  I got many compliments on this. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was amazed that I actually had all the ingredients for this recipe on hand, so I decided to give it a try. Not bad at all. I'll be making it again. I used my pressure cooker to cook the potatoes whole. Then after they were refrigerated cold, I peeled and cubed them. I always mix the all the other ingredients and then incorporate it into the potatoes last. If you are using M.W. instead of Mayo, You might want to reduce the sugar a little. If you want to make M.W. just add 2 T sugar to one quart Mayo and there you have it!

This is probably the best recipe for Potato Salad that I've come across.  I love potato salad but have come to hate any from the grocery store deli's.  I thought this needed some extra salt and I added some chopped egg to it but otherwise it's awsome. Actually is tastier after about 24 hrs or so!  I've gotten many compliments on this potato salad!

The dressing makes this dish taste great.  I did leave out the relish and added chopped egg.  Also, used a lot more celery and onion.

Delish.  I used left-over roasted red potatoes and left out the carrots, parsley, and celery.  To make this more healthy, I used a combo of low-fat mayo and fat-free yogurt (once everything is mixed together, you can't even tell the difference!) and used a dash of sugar substitute instead of sugar.  I would make this again.

Made this for Easter dinner for my boyfriend and his parents. His dad asked me for the recipe, which was a huge compliment. The only changes I made were leaving out the carrots and pimentos and adding diced pickles and eggs. Very very yummy though

Yum!! Loved it. I left out the carrot and used dill instead of parsley. It does take way longer than 15 minutes to boil the potatoes, though. But seriously, DELICIOUS.

This recipe was really yummy!  I needed a potato salad recipe that didn't call for any eggs because I didn't have in the fridge at the time.  I normally am not a big potato salad fan because I'm not a big fan of mayo, but the dressing in this salad didn't taste all that "mayonnaissy" to my delight.  I followed the recipe as listed except I left out the celery and pimento because I didn't have any on hand.  Also, instead of using pickle relish, I used some of my grandma's homemade pickles and just diced them up a bit.  I think it may have been the pickles that made the dish, but regardless it was extremely tasty and went quick at our picnic.  Oh yeah... one last alteration to the recipe... instead of peeling and boiling the potatoes, I kept the skins on and baked them in the microwave until done.  Then I cut them in half and let them cool, and even stuck them in the freezer for about 30 minutes to harden a bit so that they didn't fall apart when I added them to the dressing.  That seemed to work like a charm.  The shredded carrots in it were a good addition to the salad too.  Enjoy!

I thought this potato salad was pretty good--did not use celery, pimento or shredded carrot only because I don't care for them in my potato salad.  I used white rice vinegar and honey mustard instead of regular mustard.  I also used a dash of dill weed.  From previous reviews, I made the dressing separate and mashed the yolks in the dressing.  Great flavor--will make this again.  Thank you for sharing Mary Ann

I made this recipe for a July 4th party.  Everyone commented on how good it was.  I used Hellmann's Cholesterol free mayonnaise and red potatoes leaving the skin in tact.  Great recipe definitely will make again.

Yum, Yum, YUM!!  My family normally does not care for potato salad but everyone loved this recipe!  I omitted the pimentos, used rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and added some hard boiled eggs.  It was WONDERFUL!!  I will definitely be making this recipe to bring to BBQ's this summer!

Perfect.  Thank you.  I've had a hard time making a potato salad that my family liked.  This was easy and perfect.  I also added in two hard boiled eggs, slicing the whites and mashing the yolks into the dressing.  Simple and delicious.

easy to make and all the ingredients for the potato sauce make it an awesome potato salad. I think I added more mustard than the recipe called for by accident, but it still tasted really good.

Gooood. Cut down on sugar and added a whole carrot (just thought that 1/2 teaspoon was... ridiculous!!). Also added a lot more onion and an extra teaspoon of parsley, plus a tablespoon of white wine vinegar. Forgot about celery. This is a great recipe you can tweak a little bit to suit your own taste. You'll love this one!!

The flavor was excellent, however there are two things I will do differently next time: use a bit less mayonnaise (was just a tad too creamy for my taste); and I think peeling/cutting up the potatoes first before boiling will make their texture more uniform.  Boiling whole left some chunks soft and some hard after cutting up.

Excellent and very easy recipe! I cut the sugar to 1 teaspoon, used Miracle Whip instead of mayo (my husband's preference), added dill instead of pickle, and topped with some sliced olives. Perfecto! :)

A little bland. I add more onion and celer y, finely chopped red pepper, a small amount of grated sharp cheese. I always cube my potatoes before cooking and cook most of the onion and celery with them.  I use just a little raw for crunch.  I top it
with a scattering of green onions and a good sprinkle of paprika.  I like eggs finely chopped as I hate chunks of egg white!

Been making this but the recipe was submitted to Allrecipes by Mary Ann Benson. I fine chop half a small onion . Use vegan mayo & don’t add the pimento because I rarely have on hand.

This was super tasty! I didn't have pimentos so I didn't add those or the carrots. Otherwise I opted to cube my potatoes before boiling and with the suggestion of another review, mixed everything together and then folded in the warm potatoes...… this is a great recipe!

I used only 2 eggs and more parsley and onion and vinegar and it tuned out very good.  I used red and tiny russet potatoes because I had them  and the flavor is tops. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

EXCELLENT!  10/10. I added extra pimento and it was fantastic. It's also nice to have a wonderful recipe that doesn't have to be "creamy".  It was a hit!

Will definitely make this again - much more flavorful than what I've made in the past. I had an abundance of russet potatoes that needed to be used up and this took care of a couple of pounds. I added a bit more onion and celery, and skipped the carrot and pimento. Yum!

I left out the onion (didn't have any), but otherwise made this as close as possible (don't have a scale to weigh the potatoes) to the recipe. Turned out good. Would recommend giving time to refrigerate it...makes it even better.

I used half dry mustard, half Dijon.  I used Yukon gold potatoes, and put the vinegar on while potatoes were still warm, as suggested by another reviewer.  I added some celery salt plus minced celery, and also put some dill weed in it (love dill!).  This potato salad was a huge hit!

I added 2 tablespoons of mustard instead of the 2 teaspoons it called for. When I make it again, I'll probably add more onion. My husband told me I was never allowed to buy store potato salad again, he loved it that much!

I had been looking on this site for an egg-free potato salad and this will be my go-to from now on. Perfection! I can bypass the grocery store's overpriced deli section. This is the perfect potato salad along with Chef John's macaroni salad and  Aunt Mamie's easy apple coleslaw - all winners. Thanks so much, Mary Ann Benzon!

it's very good, except next time I'll cut the mayo to 3/4 C, as I don't like so much, or maybe use more potatoes.  I used Russets because I had them and they turned out fine.

Whoa, really good basic recipe.  Did not have celery, pimentos and hubby said no to carrots.  I did have bacon so cooked and chopped six slices to add.  Also added jarred minced sweet bell peppers along with a good bottled ranch dressing in place of half the mayo.  We have chickens that produce lots of eggs so yes I put chopped boiled eggs in too. This recipe is a keeper, thank you for sharing.

This is now my potato salad...in the summer I make it pretty much on a biweekly basis! It's a five-star recipe as is, but easily adjusted to suit your taste. I use half of a sweet onion, and substitute celery seeds for celery (I like the taste, not the texture.) I add the carrots if I've got them, but they don't make or break the salad. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a great recipe as is. I added boiled eggs, and My husband wants me to dice the celery so there is no crunch. (Or try celery seed? I think it needs the celery flavour.

I've been making potato salad for many, many years and it always turns out a little different every time. I decided to "follow a recipe" this time because I was making it for 20 people that I'd never met. Well, let me say, it was so good! It's the exact flavor I've been trying to achieve for years. It was a huge hit with everyone who tried it. I've been telling all my close friends about it also. It was still just as good on day three as it was on the first day. I omitted the carrot and pimiento, due to preference only. I don't think it needed it for flavor, maybe just for color. I sprinkled smoked paprika on top for color and garnish.

WOW!  Where has this been all my life?

Has to be one of the best potato salads I've ever had.

This goes into the "Make again" folder.  

A hint:  Peel and cube the potatoes before cooking and then cook for 9 min.  Saves a bit of time.

Only thing I changed was to cut up the potatoes prior to boiling, used celery seed instead of celery, and omitted the pimento because I didn't have any. This was a winner! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This was just kind of bland. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was very bland. So I doubled up on the onion, celery, mustard, pimento and parsley.  STILL bland, but I thought maybe it needed to chill for a while, then it would be better, so I put it in the fridge for 3 hours before my family's bbq. At the bbq, it got eaten, but my brothers requested pickles be added (they couldn't taste the relish at all), and my mom said it needed more mustard and salt. I have to say I agree. Also, the recipe says to cook the potatoes for 15 minutes, but I cooked mine for 20 and they still could have used another 5 minutes. I don't know where on earth whole russet potatoes can cook fully in 15 minutes. Maybe if you half or quarter them. But whole? No way.

This is an outstanding recipe.  I never have pimentos.... so, I just chop regular green olives stuffed with pimento... works great (my family loves olives so its just extra bonus goodness for them!).  Again, terrific recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

Super easy.
I chopped the potatoes before boiling (just because it's how i've always done it).
Took advice from other reviewers and mixed the dressing before adding to the potatoes.
I also added 5 chopped up hard boiled eggs to my potatoes before adding the dressing.
I subbed 2tsp onion powder for the onions (my kids won't eat onions)and also added 2 tsp of chia seeds and approx 5 tsp of grated carrots however i think i'll double this next time too.
I left out sugar, mustard, pimento, vinegar & relish as they are not to our tastes although i do think i may try adding mustard next time!
Can't wait for supper am sure it'll go down well it looks great!

4 stars for recipe as is, though I had a few problems with this.
I've never boiled potatoes before and Doing this right is critical. This recipe calls for you to boil water then add whole potatoes, cool and chop after. This will result in mushy outside cooked and hard inside. I had to start all over again but instead, peeled and cut potatoes into 1/2 inch-1inch cubes, put them in cold water and brought that to a boil covered. Once boiling I uncovered and checked for doneness every 1-2 minutes by biting into pieces and cutting with a fork.

I was worried there was too much sugar so I decreased that by a third. I felt there was hardly any ingredients in this so I Added extra onion and carrot, probably double the original recipe.  And lots lots more celery since I like it crunchy. I recommend mixing dressing first then folding into potatoe to prevent mushing them too much. It came out awesome and everyone loved it.
Of note--I made 3x the amount called for one recipe and of course tripled the ingredients but still felt like it was hardly enough though it would have still been good.

Yummy! I give it 5 stars even though I had to substitute a few things, very good base recipe. Had to use 1/2 cup cracked pepper mayo with 1/2 cup miracle whip, and spicy brown mustard, because that's all I had. Turned out great!

There's another potato salad recipe on this site that I normally use and it has lots of ratings on it, but I decided to give this one a chance and I'm glad I did.  It was so easy and very tasty.

I was actually quite lazy and skipped alot of the ingredients. I did half the amount of mayo, used the 2tsp of mustard as called for and honestly, it was good just like that.  I added half the amount of sugar, which in the end, wasn't that necessary but I wanted to see what it would taste like.  I also used cider vinegar since that's all I had and it added a nice zip.  I left everything else out and you know what...it was still good!  I'm sure the onions would have brought it up another notch but I was fine with just the basics.

Very good recipe. A change I tried, cooked the potatoes the night before and marinated them in an Italian vinegarette dressing. Gives the potatoes an amazing flavor. And I also added bacon bits just before serving

This recipe is a great starting point! I would definitely use either dill pickle relish or much less sugar in the future. I didn't even add all the sugar the recipe called for and it was still really sweet. Also, carrots and egg make a nice addition as well.

Great basic recipe! I love onions, so I added more, and I used fresh italian parsley instead of dried. It was pretty easy with pre-chopped onion and celery from the grocery aisle. A perfect quick addition to our 4th of July celebration.

JUST LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE, this recipe is amazing and easy. Did the minced onions-2 TBSP, and added a small can of sliced olives. Omited the pimento just because everyone else did. Make sauce and chill while potatoes are chilling in the frig and add olives at the end. My german mama has been gone 17 years, but I swear it tastes just like hers. DOUBLE THE RECIPE for sure-I would say doubling it serves 8.  Triple it if you have 10-12 people.

This was by far the best potato salad I've ever made. I was so happy to get rave reviews from my family. When I seen the ingredients, I had a good feeling about this one. I have to admit, I didn't follow the exact measurements but added them to my liking and it came out perfectly. The only thing I didn't do was add the shredded carrots and the pimento(couldn't find it). After I boiled my potatoes and skinned them, I just add sea salt to bring out the flavor. This is the best recipe I ever came across and I went through many including my own homemade concoction and this is a definite winner.

I've never been great at making potato salad but my daughter requested some for our grandsons birthday party. After reviewing several recipes I decided to try this version. It was a huge success!  People went back for seconds and thirds. I doubled the recipe and added 5 hard boiled eggs an eliminated the celery. I made the sauce the night before and added the eggs and potatoes the day of the party. Many people in our family like warm potato salad versus cold.  The sauce is FABULOUS!  This recipe is a keeper!  My daughter called for the recipe on her way home so she could make it the next day

This recipe is great because you can make it to suit your/your families' tastes.  Did not add onions, celery, pimento or carrots so the kids would like it.  (In my opinion the carrots just give it color anyway) Was out of eggs, but would definitely add next time. I would have added celery seed instead of celery, but forgot; would add next time. And I would double or come close to doubling the relish next time.  Oh, and I just used plain white vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar and it was not overpowering at all.  I used olive oil mayo, which probably makes little difference. I had to add another 2 min to the cooking time of the potatoes even after I had cut them down to be equal size.  I used Yukon gold potatoes and left some of the skin on.  And I used the "make the dressing first" technique that other reviewers suggested, and then tossed the potatoes in. I served it with turkey burgers and corn on the cob for dinner and I'm ashamed to say I went back twice later that night for my "snack"!

This is a fantastic recipe that was easily made vegan by using vegan mayonnaise. Huge favorite in our house-so much so that we eat it warm.
I never add the carrots, pimientos, relish, celery, or onions. We like our potato salad simple and less sweet so I reduce the sugar by about 1/3 to 1/2.
I have no doubt it will be excellent if made to the recipe-I make it according to our taste and it is outrageously good.
Our nonvegan friends love it too

Revised..Pete thinks its still too sweet. Next time cut even more sugar or relish out.

I made this recipe for the 4th of July cookout and followed the recipe exactly. Everyone commented on how good it was. I think it is the best potato salad recipe that I have ever made and will use it from now on; it was not dry or tasteless, rather you could not help noticing how nice the flavor was from first bite! You could add eggs, bacon or anything else you might think of but it did not need it.

It has always been a standing joke in my house that I make the WORST potato salad. I haven't made it since my kids were in high school, the are now in their 40s, so I am having them over for dinner tomorrow and decide to make potato salad since I have all these recipes at my fingertips. My husband is the best food taster, so he tasted it and now I can't wait to serve it. This recipe was so good. I did use spicy brown mustard as I didn't have the dry mustard. It is chilling now and I can't stop tasting it. My first time in years and it is GREAT

Raymond really liked this. Enough to call & tell me so.
Easy to make. 
Read notes.
Use Scallions instead of white Onion.
Add abit of sour cream to cut mayo.
A couple Hard Boiled Eggs will be good also next time and see if it's better.

Loved the sweeter dressing. I cut the potatoes into smaller bit size pieces before cooking - saved on cooking time. While potatoes were cooling, made the dressing. Added fresh parsley, liked the crunch of the onions and chopped celery, and then added a little more fresh chopped parsley and paprika on top before serving the next day. Will be a keeper recipe!

Just made this for Labor Day. Had to change it a bit due to what we had, so for us, we used white potatoes, yellow onion, celery seed (in place of celery) and omitted the pimento and carrots and it was still delicious! Everyone loved it and was asking where I got the recipe. Thank you! Even taking a few things out, it's still awesome! So yummy.

This is just what I was looking for and it turned out Great! I used baby yellow potatoes that have that extra buttery flavor to them and it really made this salad stand out.

Very good.  I didn't have any celery, pimento or carrot, but it was still very good.  I did read some of the reviews and mixed the dressing ingredients together first and the poured over the potatoes.  Will definatly make this again.

This took me 7 hrs to prepare...no joke! I'm a newbie so beware.....It was wonderful and everyone who eats it loved it. I made extra sauce as I thought it needed a bit more when I finished.

Very good, but a little too much mustard--and I like a bite.  Overall, very good, did not turn bland after a day or two as potato salad often does.

This was pretty good, but its not even close the best potato salad I've ever had. I halved the recipe (always have too many leftovers whenever I make potato/pasta salads), and left out the celery (don't like), pimentos (hubby doesn't like), and carrot (didn't have any), and added two eggs. I wasn't really hot on using both the sweet relish and sugar, and I think it made it too sweet. We did enjoy it, but I think I'll stick with my traditional potato salad from now on. Thanks for sharing though.

I made this as is without the pimento b/c I didn't have and thought it was just ok. I then quickly fixed it by adding some eggs another tbs of mustard and some green pepper. To me it tasted better. I always like to make potato salad with eggs but decided to try one without. I like it with eggs much better. I do like the flavor the vinegar adds though. Overall not a bad potato salad but it is just my family's preference to have eggs in it and green pepper.

Very good potato salad.  I omitted a few things --  carrots, pimentos, and onions because I did not have them in the house and the flavor was excellent anyway. Can't wait to taste it tomorrow mornning when the potatoes absorb more of the flavor of the mayo.  Thanks Maryann for a recipe I will use over and over again!

Very good standard potato salad.  I follow this recipe exactly and always get complimented on the taste.
