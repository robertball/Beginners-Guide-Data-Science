This recipe is okay. I more than doubled the water for cooking the lentils and they still didn't come out as soft I would have liked for this recipe.  While the recipe doesn't use a ton, truffle oil is quite expensive. I'm not sure this recipe is worth the effort or expense, particularly for a someone who eats meat. It still gets 3 stars, because it doesn't taste all that bad.  It's close to real pate, but different enough to feel like something is missing.  *** Three years later*** This recipe has really grown on me. My vegetarian friends seem to like it quite a bit. I keep the ingredients on hand and it's fairly quick and easy to make when I want to bring a dish to a party. I have found that if you don't tell people it's lentils, word might get around that it's liver and it won't eat eaten - even by the nonvegetarians

I've made this before because I have a lot of food allergies and hummus is a wonderful, healthy snack I can eat. The problem: I hate chickpeas. So I've made "hummus" with lentils as this recipe says. I didn't use truffle oil, but the chili oil from Trader Joes. The spice gives it some kick. I love it!

This is actually surprisingly delicious. I had no problem cooking up my lentils (although they didn't get very tender, it's true. But I like them better that way) with the 2 cups of broth. The truffle oil is wonderful. This is my first time making lentils and I'm surprised at how much I like it. I would absolutely make this recipe again.

I used olive oil and lots of fresh garlic  It was delicious and never liked lentils in the past. Healthier than chick peas.

I didnt like this recipe at all. I do really like Hummous and other pate/dips, but this is very chalky and bland... even after adding more oil, water and seasoning. disappointed because I was planning to serve it tonight as an appetizer.

This was nice. The truffle oil did make a difference and we liked the flavor. I tried to play with the ingredients and mixed in a bit of brandy and I think that made it more of a mock patè than a snazzy lentil dip-which is what it tastes like with its original ingredients. I put it in the freezer to maintain the shape of patè and for the next time will make some aspic to cover it to help hold the shape. The original recipe is a 4 star recipe for me; add a splash of brandy and you can tack on a half star. Thank you Cathi from NJ for an enjoyable treat.

As someone else said, even non-vegetarians appreciate it: a lot of people start trying when they get the info that there is no liver in it like the regular patè... I did add a bit more water to increase the smoothness, and some brandy. Well, it's incredible, it tastes like the real thing!!!

I used beef broth instead of chicken broth; not sure how much difference that made on the end product. It was okay, but not great. Just not flavorful enough.
