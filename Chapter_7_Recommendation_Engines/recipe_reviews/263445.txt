Made exactly as written and these turned out pretty good. The one tip I do have is to leave a good amount of space between each stick. I did leave a space but didn't allow enough. With the cheese being frozen, I didn't anticipate them bubbling up as much as they did. Once they bubble into one another it is impossible to separate them. These take a bit of time and effort but are worth it in the end.

These were very good. I may try regular bread crumbs next time.
