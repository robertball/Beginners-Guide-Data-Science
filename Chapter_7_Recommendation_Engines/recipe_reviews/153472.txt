This was EXCELLENT.  I skimped just a tiny bit on the parsley, upped the basil a bit and added an extra clove of garlic.  I will say that it ended up quite garlicky -- which was ok as I really like garlic -- but add garlic at your own risk.  

I wanted it to be more dip-like in consistency, so I used my stick (immersion) blender to puree it a bit, leaving it a little chunky.  Was quite thick, this way, but SO delicious.  It was a big hit at the New Year's Eve party I attended.

Be aware that you do really need to leave time to let it sit before serving -- I made it the night before, and when I tasted it then it was VERY oniony, but by the next day it had blended and tamed nicely.  I believe it's mandatory that the onion used be a sweet variety;  any other kind would be to harsh, I think. If you substitute another kind of onion, you'll want to cut back considerably on the quantity, and maybe add a pinch of sugar.

I wish I could give this more stars!!!  This was so yummy -- once you start eating it you CANNOT stop!  The fresh basil and parsley really make the flavor, so I would not recommend using the dried variety.  I also added some sugar -- I didn't measure, but probably about 1 1/2 teaspoons.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this dish for a birthday get-together and received great reviews. I increased the vinegar a bit, added two chopped Roma tomatoes, and gently mixed in a chopped avocado just before serving.

Prepared for Thunder BB end of season party 2/2009 and it was a big hit.  Added cilantro, omitted parsley and basil, added red pepper, added cucumber.  Dressing is very nice.

Love this!  So easy.  I've made this for snacking at home and I recently made it for a party at work.  It gets rave reviews and everyone was curious about what it was and how it was made.  I love that!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm not great in the kitchen.  My husband is.  But when I made this, he loved it.  Two weeks later, he wanted to know why I hadn't made more!  I add just a touch of fresh cilantro for him and a little habanero in place of the hot sauce for the flavor.

This was so good,it's not even funny! I followed the recipe but used dry spices (that's all I had) I also added some chopped olives and red pepper. So good and healthy.  I will always keep this on hand in the fridge.

Since I forgot to get parsley, I didnt use it.  Took one reviewers advice and pulsed some of it slightly in food processor to give it a little thicker texture.  This is really tasty.

I love, love, love this :) Sometimes I use a raspberry vinaigrette (Paul Newman's) for the sauce. Delicious.

This is very good and very tasty.  I used dry beans, which I soaked and then cooked for about a half hour or until tender.  I also broiled my corn so that it browned/blackened a little bit.  And used green onions instead of sweet because that was what I had.  I've sure you can vary quite a few things with this one and still have it be a great success!

It was a nice basic bean salad.  I didn't add the onion and had to guesstimate the bean amounts a bit (used dried beans instead of canned) and didn't have fresh basil so used dried.  So take the rating with a grain of salt!

Made this and have served to my boyfriend and two friends, so far everyone likes it! I used a yellow onion instead of a small/sweet onion and decreased the parsley (will decrease even more the next time I make it as I don't really like cool-toned foods as much). It is great warm or cold.

Really great flavor! The mix of beans makes this dish hearty while still feeling light. I had to substitute rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar because I didn't have. And I didn't have time to let it sit for 24 hours - so I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow! Great hit at my barbecue!

I'm not even a huge bean fan but wanted to incorporate them into our diet.  This was a great start.  I love the garlic and the corn adds a sweetness to balance the salt and vinegar.  I left out the black-eyed peas, used onion powder since I didn't have onions and used a bit of mustard since I didn't have mustard powder.  It turned out great.  Even my 8 year old raved...he liked his on a toasted pita.

Here's a recipe that's healthy, cheap, TASTY and attractive! Aside from not using black-eyed peas because I never have them, I don't tamper with the ingredients( Although, the avocado addition sounds good too..) This is the real deal people.  We call it cowboy caviar and laugh about the name- it's so entertaining! Try it.  Thanks ANNELISA

I have been looking for a good cowboy caviar recipe and this is it!  I used what I had on hand namely kidney beans, navy beans, yellow corn, 1/3 c. dried parsley and 1/2 to 1 t. dried basil.  The dressing in this recipe is so much more mellow than the recipes that use harsh bottled Italian dressing.

Oh my Gosh! this is so good! I didn't realize it when I opened them but my blackeyed peas were smoke flavored. It just made it even better. Didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white wine and balsamic. Also, added sugar and used dry spices. Didn't measure anything-Sill sooooo awesome. You can't mess this up. Can't wait to try it after it sits!

Loved this recipe! Made a few tweaks with seasoning, but l always do when cooking. Definitely will be making this one again soon. It was excellent served over a bed off baby spinach greens to add even more nutrition.

I didn't have garbanzo beans but this was very good even without them.

Delicious! And I didn't even notice until while I was making it the direction to let it refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. I'd intended it for dinner that day and so tried it to be served right away, and it was good even then! But yep, even better by the next day after the different flavors had more time to marinate. Definitely a winner, whether as a side or a dip.

I substituted kidney beans for the black-eyed peas (made it more attractive and colorful). Nice flavors  and textures (maybe I will reduce the garlic next time).

Okay, so I added my own spin to this recipe.  First of all I like hot dishes - so everything is hot!

I enjoy chicken thighs - cook them in the oven with garlic and onion powder and cumin.

I wanted to try fatbacks (if you have to ask what it is - honey, you're DEFINITELY NOT from the South).  BTW these are soaked in cold water for 30 minutes, rinse and dry before frying.

Placing all the drained and rinsed veggies in a pot with a little of oil from the fatbacks and minced garlic, I added canned collards (NOT DRAINED).

While they were heating up on the stove I added Cajun Spices in place of hot sauce, dry mustard and  distilled vinegar (instead of red wine) in the mix of veggies.  Broke the fatback into nice size pieces and served with chicken and OH MY! 

ABSOLUTELY NO SALT NEEDED!  Enjoy!

This was delicious! I didn't have black eyed peas so I used a can of "salad beans" (dark kidney, pinto, & garbanzo bean mix) and omitted the full can of garbanzos. Also used 1 tsp dried basil instead of fresh (but definitely use fresh parsley!) I used the green tabasco (mild jalapeno) sauce for hot sauce. I was also short on time so it was only in the fridge for about an hour before serving. Was great and leftovers disappeared the next day! Will definitely make again, would be a perfect easy contribution to a potluck or picnic.

I actually enjoyed the bean mix before adding the dressing. With the dressing even after a day the flavor didn't seem to mesh well and it was really lacking.  We ended up throwing a bunch of it out.

My daughter made this and I loved it, and she said she got the recipe here, so I had to get it, too. Tastes so good, and quite nutritious, especially if you use organic ingredients.  Yum-yum!

Good stuff. I could not find black eyed peas in our local store so I used black and white beans.

we love this stuff!  However, we modify a bit.  I use only a couple tablespoons of oil, substitute cilantro for the parsley, and use dried basil.  I also use red onion instead of Vidalia, and top it with fresh avocado.  I don't mix the avocado into the salad bowl because this salad tastes best the next day, and mixing the avocado in makes it too mushy the next day.  I usually put in extra beans or black eyed peas, depending on which I have on hand.
