Great recipie! If you dredge whatever you're frying in flour before you put it in the batter, it helps the batter stick more and makes it thicker.

Simple, tasty batter.  I added just a little salt to enhance flavor.  I use it to make fried shrimp with onion rings on the side. It helps to dust your fish, shrimp, etc. with flour first, then dipping in the batter.  Some people have said this batter is too thin; add a little more flour if you like, but note that a heavy batter will fry up very dense and retain a lot of oil.

This was an excellent recipe, except for the fact that the fish got very soggy when it cooled. My oil was plenty hot, I dried the fish first (as someone else had suggested) and drained them real good. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to keep the fish crispy?

The batter seemed too thin so I followed another reviewers advice and dredged walleye in flour before the batter. It turned out perfect. Nice light crispy coating. I fried two pieces at a time and kept them in a warming drawer as they finished. A 200 degree oven would do the same.

For a more "formal" version of fish & chips, I also coat the french fries in the batter.  For us weight-watching folks, the fish & chips can be oven baked (345-deg./30-35 min), and everyone still loves it.

I used two cups of flour, two and a half cups of beer and a bit of cayenne to use as my batter for blooming onions. Absolutely delicious!

I made this to batter Alaskan Whiting.  As a family from the UK, we were missing our traditional fish and chips so I went on the search for a good batter recipe.  We liked this batter very much.  It had a good flavor and covered the fish beautifully.  The only thing we found was that it was a bit flat and didn't bubble out the way we like it.  This was easily remedied by the addition of a tspn of baking soda.  The key to making perfect fried fish is the temperature of the oil.  If it is too hot, the batter will burn and the fish will be undercooked.  If it is too cool, it will take too long to cook and the fish will be greasy.  If it's cooked at the correct temperature (320f), the batter will be golden and crispy and the fish will be cooked through but won't taste greasy.  Effectively, the fish is steamed by the heat of the oil cooking the batter, but should be cooked before the oil actually soaks through the batter, which is why the temperature of the oil is so crucial.  This is a good recipe and definitely reminded us of home.

I had to start over after initially following the recipe exactly.  This is way too much beer - it makes a soup of the flour mixture.  I suggest pouring about 1/3 cup into the flour mix to start, and to slowly pour beer from the bottle if you need more.

I have tried this recipe a many times and it is excellent!! The trick is to put enough beer into the recipe to make it a little on the loose side. When deep fried, it gives a very light and crispy coating. The thicker the mix, the thicker the end product, which is too much. The beer you use makes a difference also. I have used Sam Adams Boston lager and Pabst Blue Ribbon. I liked the PBR better as it made the batter lighter. Dredge whatever you are frying and the batter will stick like glue. I fried onions, okre, zucunni, green peppers, potatoes, tilapia, and lake Erie perch. All were just awesome. The batter is simple and easy to make. Make sure the fryer is at 350 before you start frying as a cooler temp takes longer and absorbs more oil. Drain on a paper towel and let cool before eating.

This worked perfectly for my onion rings last night. It made me sad to give up my beer for this but it was worth it. Besides, I have more beer. ;o)

Great base recipe. Only used 3/4 beer, otherwise would have been too watery (I prefer thick batter, more southern). Since everyone was complaining about seasoning, I used creole seasoning in replace of the pepper. Turned out great!

I am giving this 5 stars with my additions:
Floured the haddock befor putting into the batter.
I added old bay,onion powder and some hot sauce to the batter for additional kick.
I used a really nasty tasting IPA that my son left us with from christmas this year. When I tasted the uncooked batter I thought it was disgusting and hoped with the frying it would palatable.
It sure was delish. I salted the finished fish and shrimp immediately after taking it from the oil.
What a wonderful surprise. Thank for the basic recipe, I would def use again.

I used this to make homemade chicken nuggets and it was so delicious! Even my son who is picky kid ate them and that is saying something if he its it! My husband loved them as well. The batter made the nuggets so crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I did use flour on them before i put them in the batter. Thanks for the simple and tasty recipe

Here's what my fiance had to say about this recipe: "Awesome recipe! Better than what I've had at most restaurants. Beer batter has got to be cooking's greatest innovation. It has all the charm of beer with the practical greatness of deep frying. The batter bound to the shrimp and created a well integrated taste. The meal was further improved with Booming Onion dipping sauce." He especially liked that he got to drink the rest of the can of beer that I opened to make this. :D I added some cayenne powder and a little chili powder to give it a little kick. Definitely use the sauce from the recipe "Blooming Onion and Dipping Sauce" here on AR!!

This is a great recipe.  My husband is Samoan and is a tough judge of seafood!  This batter (we use it for everything from fish, shrimp, scallops, even mushrooms!) has garnered praise from everyone.  I add an extra 1/2 cup of flour as well as a teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning, just because my family loves that stuff.  Overall, I highly recommend this batter.

I fell in love with cheese curds on a trip to Minnesota visiting a friend.  Don't have those here in Pittsburgh, PA so after purchasing some fresh curds online and finding this batter, in about 10 min. I had fresh fried curds that were every bit as good as what we bough at the fair, for a fraction of the price (thank goodness for the internet!). 

Thank you, great recipe.  Easy to make and use. I only used about 1 1/4c of beer and added a 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning salt. As already stated, make sure you flour your food first before you dip and make sure your oil's hot enough for a good fry.  The popcorn method's always worked for me if you don't have a candy/fry thermometer. (Drop a kernel in the oil, once it pops, remove and you're ready to fry). Make sure you don't overcrowd your pan and the oil's the right temp (if it's taking too long to cook, falling to the bottom of the pan or sticking try adjusting by not adding so much at once, letting your oil rest and recoup its temp between batches and making sure it's hot enough to start). If your food's burning or your oil's turning brown, your fire's too high and the oil's too hot. burnt oil = burnt flavor so Start with fresh oil and turn down the heat. Also, make sure you have a good oil for high temp. I like grapeseed oil (light, no trans fats and great for skin and hair :) ), peanut or vegetable oil (least fav. is the vegetable but it works)...

This worked great for fried cod. I added a teaspoon salt to the batter. Perfect with it, I really think it would have been bland without it.  All I had in the house was a light beer which really didn't lend any beer taste to the batter, which was ok with me, even though we do enjoy the beer taste in the batter. So use a regular/stout beer if you enjoy the taste or a light beer if you prefer not to taste that. The batter seemed quite thin so I added a couple tablespoons more flour to thicken up just a tad. I suppose cutting back on beer would have worked as well. I followed others advice on dredging the fish in flour prior to dipping in the batter. Not sure if it made a difference or not but the batter stayed put on the fish and finished up with a nice golden coating when fried. This was a light, crispy batter even after sitting, and was not greasy in the least.

VERY simple and quick batter that is so versatile.  I was drawn to this recipe because of the few ingredients required.  It crisps up nicely & has a light texture to it.  I tried it with potatoes, zucchini, onions, and jalepeno peppers (w/ cream cheese) and everything turned out great!

This is an awesome batter.  I've tried to fry fish before with little to no success.  This was easy and a household hit.  I made the batter as directed.  I used cod and blotted it dry with paper towels then add lighly salted and peppered prior to dipping in the batter.  Because the batter was thin, I kept it refrigerated.  If you like the consistancy of temperura batter, you'll love this.  I also used this batter and seasoned it a bit for onion rings.

A nice basic batter. I use when deep frying chicken. I first dip the chicken in flour then in batter and deep fry. Really good.

It was a semi-decent start but lacked a LOT of flavor.  Couldn't really taste the beer; so I need more practice on this because it just didn't work as well as I thought as it would.  Oh well.

Good basic recipe, but needs some salt (we add 1/4-1/2 tsp), we also add some paprika and cayenne for a little extra flavor!

This was my first time battering anything!  I really love french fried veggies from the festivals and so I came looking for a batter to make them for myself.  This was PERFECT!  It was very light and crunchy and not at all too heavy for bell peppers or onion rings.  I battered broccoli, cauli, onion rings, bell pepper rings and shrimp...and they all turned out perfectly.  I did at a little more salt, but still feel like I could have kicked it up a notch.  Maybe try adding some Cajun or other spices to it.  I will use this again for sure!!

With the addition of a little salt this is the best light crispy batter we have ever found. It was heavenly for our Canadian Walleye dinner tonight. My husband used Labatt Blue, a Canadian beer, in the batter and seasoning salt for more flavor. It was wonderful and will be our family favorite from now on.

This is so good!  I cut boneless skinless chicken breasts into strips and used those.  Dredged in flour first, then the batter.  They turned out crunchy-crispy and not oily at all.  Next time, I think I'll try adding some herbs to the batter.  I also fried some battered zucchini spears.  They turned out okay, but not as crispy as the chicken.  I made a dipping sauce with mayo, horseradish and mustard, and we had a fun dinner last night!  Another keeper...thanks!!

Very good recipe but you need more like 2 cups of flour, not one. I also added onion powder and season salt. I liked the batter though.

We made this with Perch. It was fantastic! I did add a pinch of salt, dried the perch off with paper towels and coated each in some flower before dipping. Wonderful!

This recipe is so simple and tastes great. This is the fourth time I've used it. Something that I've learned from running my own bar, any beer will do, but Miller High Life seems to give you the best flavor. I don't preffer it as a drinking beer, but it is great to cook with. I make this recipe just as explained and it comes out great.

This is fast to make but it totally needs salt. At least 1/2 t. It was light and crispy but lacking flavor. I used it on rock fish we caught and dh and I both went and got different bottles of sauces for dipping to perk it up. Will probably try again w/that change. For Krystal, who said the batter came off...I've made the mistake of not drying off fish/chicken before adding a coating or not having the oil hot enough. It really helps.

Perfect batter for those who love to taste the fish, not the batter.  I did not dredge in flour before dipping in batter.  Fried up crispy and flavorful.  Sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on flounder filets while thawing. Served w/ Chinese Broccoli Slaw (from this site). Spectacular!!!

Love how this uses commen household ingredients (yeah I always have beer haha).  Omitted the garlic as I dislike it.  DH actually did the work I just found the recipe for him and it turned out great.  I live on Lake Erie and fish a lot so another way to make perch is always welcome, as is another reason to hget more beer LOL ;-)  Thanks for posting this!

Perfect!  We dredged them in flour before the beer batter, added some Old Bay seasoning, a dash of cayenne pepper, and fried 'em on the deck to keep the smell outside.  We LOVED this recipe!

This is a good, basic beer batter recipe. A couple of tweaks, and it's excellent.

1. I found 1 Cup of beer made the batter too thin. Instead, I would gradually pour beer into the four mixture until the desired consistency is achieved.

2. This recipe needed salt. I'd say 1 to 2 tsp. You can always salt them after you fry though. 

3. I would recommend, in accord with other reviewers, to dredge in flour prior to battering. One could even mix some paprika or chili powder with the dredging flour. 

4. Making sure you do not over batter your food will help to ensure that it doesn't get soggy. 

Otherwise, this is a really good basic recipe with a lot of room for creativity.

Easy, simple, delicious.

Most beer batters will become soggy when cooled.  To crisp up, reheat in oven around 375degrees for about 7-10 minutes or so (microwaves will make soggier).

If the batter is too thick, thin it out with more beer for a thinner coating.

I've used this recipe a few times now to make deep fried mushrooms for my kids and they love it!  I usually wash them off and dredge them in flour then dip them in the batter and put them in the deep fryer for about 3-4 minutes and they come out perfect.  Now they want me to make chicken fingers with it next.

Luv, luv, luv this recipe !!!! We were craving long john's but did not want to go out and I had some tilapia in the freezer, did a quick search and found this recipe.  Although it did need salt but no big deal the next time I will salt my fish before battering and I also, dredged in flour before dipping in the batter and frying.  I had no trouble whats so ever with the fish getting soggy when they were ready.  The next day we ate the leftovers and they were a bit soggy but still delicious!!!!  I cant wait to try this on onions, shrimp and other veggies!  This is a keeper and extremely easy! Will definitely make again and again and again!  Thanks for sharing Letty !!!!  YUM YUM !!!

This batter is the business! I didn't change anything, and the flounder pieces I fried for fish tacos came out light and crispy with lovely little lacy edges. Several reviewers have mentioned that the batter needs salt - I usually sprinkle my batter-fried foods with salt as soon as they come out of the oil, so I didn't have any trouble. We are full and happy people tonight - and I'm considering adding some cornmeal to the leftover batter and frying up some hushpuppies. Thank you so much for posting this simple and excellent recipe.

I've read all these reviews...I see nothing wrong with this simple basic recipe.  I have made everything from shrimp to onion rings..and all inbetween.. and keep referring to this recipe. AS IS!   Yeah..the batter gets soggy if you let it sit...but doesn't All batter? (we are not talking breading here).  Anyway..this recipe is great.. perfect!   the only thing i do different is give the family a salt shaker...if they prefer it salty er than what it is..they can shake it! lol   I never measure spices..so maybe a do a little more garlic? or maybe less...  The basics to this recipe is fine..no need to add...no need to flour more..etc.  I LOVE this recipe..its my backbone of my batter !!  Great Job to the Chef!

This beer batter is the best. I used Corona beer because it is our favorite, and next time I will cut back a little on the garlic. I used with chicken breasts and the chicken was so juicy and tender. Had a bunch of batter left over, so I dipped home-made curly potatoe fries into it before frying (in Smart Balance oil) and it was soooo delicious!!! Husband went crazy over it!

Quick easy, I used this for 400+ people of a ship!  After scaling it - and frying it with commercial fryers - but here's the best part...I couldn't obtain the beer because it was still held in a container on the dock...so I replaced the beer with sherry we had on board and a few glugs of white vinegar (WARNING-Batter tastes awful with the sherry) but after the sherry is literally fried out of it, it was fantastic!!!  I have the whole crews word on it, the English & Irish people we have on board couldn't believe I produced such 'Fish & Chips' (we are a Mission NGO organization on a budget).  OH, ONE MORE THING - if its too thick water it down with the beer or sherry you are using to pancake batter consistency then chill it, IF the first fish or too look to smooth, or to bready, give it a few more goes because after the first one or too it straighetened right out to perfect consistency.  5 STARS because of ease, minimal ingredients, and I haven't even used beer with it yet!!!

Wow. That was great! I've never deep fried before and it turned out very well. I dried the fish, dredged in flour, dipped into the batter, with a little salt as another reviewer mentioned, and "deep" fried in about 1.5" canola oil in my stock pot. Worked very well. I used sole and Sleeman Cream Ale.

This batter cooked up nice and crisp. However, it needs salt!! I added 1 tsp to the batter the second time around and it was MUCH better.

I used this batter for Fish 'n Chips for my husband - whose is British - and he LOVED it!  Even told his mom that my recipe was better than hers.  I added a bit too much beer so I upped the flour to get the right thickness.  Turned out great - not to thick - and tasted great!

Excellent recipe though 1 cup of (good) beer works way better. I suggest spicing the batter up with whatever you have on hand. I used paprika and garlic powder.

Seemed to have the same sticking problem as others.  Good flavor, though, so I'd probably give it another try.

I dipped some pre-cooked shrimp into the batter and fried them up. It was excellent! My husband said it was as good as any finer restaurant would serve. With some good sweet and sour sauce, it makes a great main dish with rice or chow mein

I had to add more beer to my recipe. The trick to know the batter is good is when you stick a fork or something in and then let the batter drizzle. If it leaves a trail of batter that slowly disappears on top of the rest of the batter, it's perfect.

Made twice the recipe for a big fish fry, and added some blackened seasoning and a little more garlic salt to the batter and it was fantastic! It was a little too runny but just added some more flour and got it to the consistency I needed!

This batter recipe was excellent for the fried pickles I made~ I personally recommend taking a swig from your can of beer before adding it to the recipe (for thicker batter I used just a splash more than a cup). Next time around I would like to have more seasoning in mine, but this recipe is an amazing ground. Thick yet light, crispy, and easy to whip up.

Makes a great all-purpose batter. Works with anything. Don't add all the ingredients at once. Different beers and different grades of flour don't mix the same. Start with half the mix and add as you need to. Once you get the proportions down, use the same beer and flour each time and you won't go wrong

Being born and raised in Wisconsin, Friday Fish Fries are just a normal part of life . . . and something that I miss dearly since moving to the South. This recipe brought me back home! So delicious! I followed the recipe, but didn't need the full 1-1/2 cups of beer (I used Bud Light Lime) to reach the consistency that I was looking for (probably just slightly more than 1 cup). I used cod, as that is what is available to me, but I was dreaming that it was haddock (my favorite, but not something you can find in Georgia). This would be a great batter for onion rings too! Will make again!

This is a great and simple recipe. It's easy to put together and forgiving in the ingredient amounts. If it gets too thick, add more beer. Too thin? Add more flour.

Dredge in flour, use garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and add a pinch of sugar to help make the batter crispy.

It was very light in flavor.  I added a dash of paprika and dill. I used the tip about dredging in flour first. I used this recipe because I didn't have the breading I normally use. I will definitely use this one again.

OK, I've read all the suggestions and have my own to add. I've used this for many years and always get requests for a fish fry.
First open a can of light beer day before and leave out to get stale. Next day somewhat dry your fish, leave moist. In a one gallon size zip lock bag put in a cup or two of dry fish batter (I use the brand made in Toledo, Oh.) and add a table spoon of Old Bay seasoning and shake to mix. In shallow bowl, mix more batter with the stale beer to a soupy consistency. Your deep fryer should be at least set at 375 degrees.
Add 4-5 fillets to bag and shake, then drudge the fillets through the beer batter and fry until they rise to top or golden brown. Enjoy!

This was a simple very easy to make batter. It was thin in appearance but it turned out to be a nice thickness once the fish was done. I used it on walleye fillets and used New Glarus Spotted Cow beer. Delicious!

This recipe was a TOTAL disaster. I tried using the double servings on the website. I ended up with beer soup with a hint of flour chunks. Same result with the normal recipe. To get ANY kind of batter I had to use quarter a cup of beer with everything else at the double serving size. The taste was just horrible. I tried it on bass, chicken, and snapper. Don't waste your beer or your meat.

Absolutely perfect, and so simple to make! This is a new favorite in our house when we're craving something fried. We usually make it with tilapia pieces, but have also tried mushrooms, onion rings, and shrimp, and they have all been divine!

It was good, but I had the same problem as some others in that the breading didn't stick very well even though I dried the fish fillets thoroughly. It also wasn't as thick as I'd like it. Next time I'll dredge lightly in flour. I also added 2 tsp of (Paula Deen's) house seasoning (garlic powder, salt, pepper) to the batter as well as seasoning the fillets prior to dipping. The flavor was really good.

 I had left over batter so I threw in some zucchini slices ... same deal ... I'll dredge in flour next time.  
Yummy though.

I also agree with one reviewer that you need to dredge what you're cooking in flour first.  I cooked cod at 375 degrees and it came out great but it does need a bit of salt.

This was great!  Used a little less beer so it wasn't thin.  I also followed other recommendations and dredged the fish in flour before batter.  Yumm yummm!

Not bad. Easy to make and worked good as a batter, but the flavor was pretty bland. Next time I'll read more reviews prior to making. I agree that adding a little salt or replacing the garlic powder for garlic salt would enhance the flavor

Was ok..I would prefer more flavor though. Definately a very plain recipe that is easy to use.  Will have to tweak it a littler w/ some salt before I will try it again.

This was amazing! I used it with chicken strips instead of fish. The chicken came out crispy on the outside n moist,juicy chicken. I added a pinch of ceyenne pepper for a hint of spice. Will use forever.

This was a HUGE hit with my family!! I battered tilapia in it and fried it.  Found after a couple of pieces that the fish needed to be rolled in flour first and then batter otherwise the batter blew off the fish in the fryer.  My hubby and kids said it was the best fish I have ever made!

The batter didn't brown until the fish was overdone.  Some salt and more seasoning would have made it better too.

I seasoned the fish with a little sale and pepper and dredged in flour before battering.  The fish was excellent, but did become soggy as it cooled. Any suggestions to keep the fish crisp?

I was hoping this batter would be perfect! However, it was just not for me. I thought it was strange that "the batter had no salt" and it also called for "quite a lot of pepper!" I don't care for pepper, so I used just a small tad. It would have added heat and not flavor anyway. However, the end result was the batter tasted extremely "plain." In addition, I thought it was a little too thick, after fried, but it was crispy. However, as soon as the fish slightly cooled from the oil, the batter turned real "soggy." So, this is definitely not a make ahead meal. Maybe, I wasn't sure how thick or thin to make the batter. And, I would have made sure to season the batter and fish very well. Maybe, the results would have been better then?

Found this recipe and made it tonight.  Though, I did forget to include the egg, the batter worked out anyway.  We battered chicken that came out so juicy and crunchy.  After he tasted the first piece, my BF said, "Just deep fry the batter, why put anything in it?!"  We really liked it and will definitely try it again, this time with the forgotten egg.  BF said he wants to try using Hornsby's Draft Cider.  He thinks it may give a hint of apple flavor to the batter.  Just finished eating dinner and had to come on here to say that this is a great recipe!  Thank you, Letty!

Definietly roll items in flour before dipping. We fried cauliflower and pickles. Tasted good (better the next day as the garlic got stronger), however there was something missing from the overall flavor. Maybe salt?

It was easy to make, and I had all ingredients on hand. It needed some salt though, and if you didn't eat the food right away, it got soggy. Other than that it was just alright. I added extra garlic powder and pepper, but it was still bland. I think I'll stick to the one I buy in the box.

Oh my this was fantastic! I battered some wild caught cod and zucchini wheels and they were amazing. I seasoned my batter with a pinch of cayanne pepper and a dash of cumin then put a decent amount of garlic salt and paprika and parsley. I used an amber IPA for my beer. The results were amazing. The bater didn't fall apart in my oil, it had a perfect golden brown coat and it tasted great best of all!

First class!!!  Used recipe for deep fried green tomatoes and they were absolutely fabulous!  Added a pinch of salt and only used 1 cup of the beer.  So much better than the traditional fried green tomatoes!!!

I've used this batter on chicken fillets and chicken tenders. Turned out great both times. I used 1 cup of beer and left everything else alone. Next time I may try to spice it up a bit.

This recipe was excellent. I used it to coat chicken breast strips.  Very simple and easy.  I added about 1 teaspoon of salt, which made it naturally flavorful, my friends and family thought I had bought the chicken strips from our local restuarant.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This a really nice recipe!!! it came very crunchy and delicious, I used some flour on the fish before the battering and add some dill and paprika powder to make it more flavorful,  We will make it again.

Terrific! Nice and light and tasty. I used this for shrimp and dredged in flour prior to dipping in the batter as some suggested. Definitely going in the recipe box! Might add a pinch of cayenne to the dredging flour next time for a little extra kick.

I didn't have and of the technical problems some other seemed to have. The batter was a very good consistancy and stuck to the fish just fine, but it just didn't taste like enough for me. I even added extra pepper and it was still very bland. I won't be using this recipe again.

Didn't care for this recipe.  The batter sticks to the frying basket terribly.  Also, it is bland.  I used it for frying jumbo shrimp.  My first time - maybe it was something I did.

This was the 1st time I have ever done a fish fry in my turkey fryer, and I used this recipe.  It worked great with catfish nuggets.  I added a little salt and cajun seasoning.  Everyone raved!  Thanks for making my 1st fish fry a success.

Got rave reviews. Worked great for deep fried halibut and salmon. I used a year old Budweiser that was hanging around the house and that worked great (since no one would drink it).
I kept the batter fairly thin (thinner than pancake batter) and it was light and not oily.
I did not dredge the fish in anything (flour) prior to dipping and frying.

Great batter, stayed on well. I only used 1 cup of beer and had to add some bold creole seasoning because the test try was a little bland as is. Once I added that it was an absolute home run! Will definitely use again! We are big fish eaters!

Super simple and crunchy!  You may want to add a little more seasoning or add dipping sauce. Recipe (seasonings) alone is kind of bland.

I scaled this down to 2 servings and omitted the egg because it called for 1/4 of an egg and I didn't want to waste the rest. Added a pinch of salt and dredged in flour before the batter. It was a thinner batter but it came out Amazingly light and crunchy. So much better than the boxed mixes that you just add beer to! We will Definitely be making this again! Thank you so much! Used cheap Keystone Light if anyone's interested lol.

After years of buying store bought batter I was forced to make my own (definitely began cooking without making sure I had ingredients).

I used this recipe to fry bluegill and my husband LOVED it. He said it is probably the best meal I've ever made him. 

)I added some salt and onion powder)

Really fast and easy to put together. We used a wok with cooking oil and bone-in chicken, which is pretty much the toughest way to do this and it still turned out alright. Next time I plan to make the batter thinner, so it'll cook faster. Just a tip for those using the same mats and method!

We did this with fresh haddock and aside from maybe needing a little extra salt for our taste it was excellent. Will make again for sure. Used a red ale for the beer.

Very simple recipe works very well. I did however take the advice of previous subscribers and dried the fish completely and lightly floured it before a better dipped it. That was definitely the ticket.

I get so many compliments on and requests for this. I never share the recipe because people assume it's difficult. Haha I already have every ingredient on hand so we use it often. Simple and delicious. We do dry whatever we're cooking then dredge in flour before battering. Works great on fish, chicken, potatoes, onion rings, and even hush puppies.

The batter had an overpowering beer flavor.  It may have been better with half water, half beer.  I also note that it should be cooked a a higher temperature if you want it browned and the shrimp not overcooked--375 to 400.  It was easy to make and stuck very well to the big shrimp that I used.  We just did not care for the strong beer flavor, which overpowered everything!  I  used Pyramid ale.

The beer batter worked out well.  I used it for the cod fish that I prepared after coating it with this batter.  I followed the suggestion of coating the fish in plain flour first and another suggestion to add 1/2 tsp or so of baking soda.  The recipe worked out very well and my husband loved it.

We loved it!  I added the beer a little at a time until I got a nice thick batter.  I put it on onion rings, bell pepper slices and jalepeno slices. Next I'm going to try it on cauliflower and broccoli. This will be my go to batter. Thanks for sharing.

It turned out wonderfully crispy. Especially when 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda was added for that bubbly crust. I also cover the batter with plastic and let it sit in the fridge for an hour so batter can have a little sticky texture. Make sure you dust your fish with a little flour.

Didn't change ONE thing. Well, okay, I threw about 1/2 tsp of Old Bay in there, because it's seafood. But this is one great, simple, foolproof way to make fish. Used cod, which I got on sale yesterday-thawed overnight in fridge. Dried it WELL with paper towls, sliced loins into 1.5" strips. Floured with plain flour, dipped in batter. Pan fried in olive oil. Fish was perfectly done, light, non-greasy, crisp. Husband said "you can make this any time"--so I think he loved it. Plus, we had 16 oz beers and he got to drink the rest of the can whilst I cooked :)  Thanks for an outstanding recipe !! [I had batter left over, so next time, I'll make 1/2 recipe for the two of us and 4 cod loins. Ick the idea of "cod loins" sorta creeps me out. You know-those squareish chunks of cod]

As others have done I switched the garlic powder to garlic salt (same amount). Not being beer drinkers we weren’t sure what to use - we have been buying Pabst Blue Ribbon and it comes out great. I use cod, pat the fish dry with a paper towel, coat lightly in flour, and then dip in the batter.

Made according to directions except added only 8 oz beer to begin with as advised by another reviewer. Glad I did. batter was pretty thin with only that much. It coated and stuck on shrimp fine but not on pieces of fish. Was very tasteless, so added salt. not much better. Ended up adding about 1/2 tsp Cajun seasoning to get any flavor at all. i won't use this recipe again.

I made the batter as the recipe stated and cooked my first three chunks of cod. The batter is very thin and did not brown. I added ½ cup flour and stirred it in, then battered my fourth chunk of cod. The batter was thicker and stayed on the fish and browned. It tasted good, but the amount flour need to be increased by a ½ cup.

This was awesome!  While I usually don't care much for reviews that change the recipe, I will suggest a few things, as I made this a number of times and followed the recipe which certainly stands on it's own.  First, I definitely agree with Ryan B in recommending the flour dusting prior to dipping in the batter, and if you like a little zing, add a little cayenne.  I added about 1/4 teaspoon, but this is definitely a "to taste" kind of thing.

This batter worked great! We used just over a 1/2 cup of beer and added some Frank's Red Hot to the batter, fried up cauliflower florets, and then tossed in more Frank's. They were a great alternative to chicken wings! We also tried with some sweet chili sauce - a wonderful alternative to sweet and sour chicken.

It needs salt!!!!  I'd like to try it again but with a good bit of salt added.  The batter did work nicely for cod fillets and onion rings, when the food was coated in flour first.

Very basic and simple.  Made a pound of medium size shrimp with these ingredients plus a little added spice.  Too bad I didn't have any coconut to add!!  Next time!

Very simple batter that is easily customizable to fit your taste. I substitute my own blend of cajon seasoning in place of the black pepper and garlic powder. Turns out good and is easily added to or reduced depending upon the level of spice you think tastes best. I also used this in fish tacos and it tasted awesome!

I doubled the recipe and added some mustard powder. Very nice light batter. Perfect for the cod and perch we fried. We used corn meal instead of flour to coat the fish.

Made this for just two pieces of fish.  Used 1/2 cup of flour, one egg, and approx. 1/2 cup of beer and of course the garlic and pepper.   I thought the consistency was perfect.  We did flour the fish lightly before putting in the batter and batter adhered very well.  Made a nice light, crispy coating that was very tasty.  Will definitely be making this batter again.

Not much to it, but it serves it's purpose. This makes for a good base that you can then do what you will with, to spice it up. It works though!

Loved this recipe! It was easy and very good.  After reading other reviews of this recipe I did only add 3/4 Cup of beer and dredged the fish in flour prior to the batter. We deep fried for 5 min at 320* and it was perfect! Yes, I will make this again

Great beer batter recipe!  Simple, but good.  The only thing I did differently was to dredge the item I was frying (fish) in flower before dipping in batter.

If you want it bubbly like the picture, you MUST add a tsp of baking soda like another reviewer said.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND serving it with malt vinegar, you know, like you get on fries at the fair? I think that's what they do with British fish and chips, too, although I could be wrong. Anyways, I'm drooling just thinking about it. Salt the fish when it comes out of the oil.

I keep forgetting that I'm not supposed to add the whole beer at first, but even with the whole can it comes out great. 

Place the fish into the oil one by one and hold them there for a few seconds before releasing them - this will prevent them from sticking to anything.

Was STILL FANTASTIC reheated! It never got soggy for me. I dry the fish VERY well before starting. And when the fish come out, I set them vertically in a paper-towel lined colander (idk why, I just got the tip from a fried green tomatoes recipe review on here). When that gets crowded, I move the cooler ones to a paper-towel covered baking rack, and then every so often I replace the paper towel (I let them sit out and dry for hours). Might work just as well without the paper towel, I just haven't tried that yet. When I finally put it in a container to go into the fridge, that's lined with paper towel, too, and put in between the fish as well. Pop it in the toaster oven and it tastes just as good reheated.

Beat the egg separately first and then get some air into the batter by beating for a couple of minutes. Then put into freezer 20 minutes before use. When ready to use give the batter a further beating. This dramatically improves the finished product.
Dredging what you batter in flour, is also essential.
And I always use unbleached bread flour! Give it a try!

Great proportions; thanks to the reviewer who suggested dredging the fish in flour prior to battering.  Helped the relatively thin batter stick, but was still light and crunchy.  Four stars because I would suggest adding 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt to the batter.  I did add seasoned salt to the flour dredge and sprinkled the fish with salt when it came out of the oil, but it still needed a bit more.  Batter is also great on fries (I parboiled the potatoes first).  Thanks!

Yea Boy!  the best batter for my cheese curds. My cheese curds can now  rival A&W curds with this beer batter. If your looking for cheese curds, try  Menards( they have them in different varieties).

This batter is NOT recommended if you use a fryer. It stuck straight to the basket and never let go. It was good though... as I could testify from eating the little bits of batter that were cooked.

Used this batter for fish and onion rings. I thought it looked bland so I kicked it up a notch. Doubled the amount of garlic powder, added some salt, cayenne pepper, and a dash of curry powder. This turned out perfect and will be making again.

The recipe is o.k but let me add something to it that makes it even better. The ratio is one cup of flour to one cup of beer. For every one cup of flour add 1/4 cup of either Bisquik mix or better yet, buttermilk pancake mix. Best beer to use is on the menus' of thousand's of restaurants Sam Adams. Garlic is right and pepper is right, salt not needed, the beer has salt in it. Add a dab of paprika and Add one extra egg if you used the pancake mix. I put a pinch of old bay seasoning in the mix with two table spoons of honey a few times and others loved it. but the most important thing is to let the batter sit in the frige for about 2-3 hours first. If you are using a strong gamier fish like swia, soak the fish in either buttermilk or regular milk for 4-6 hours before you cook. Trust me this recipe addition is da bomb man

Simple, how it is supposed to be. I tried as the recipe suggested and while one piece of fish was frying added a little more flour to the batter for the next fish to enter. The way the recipe says is better,the first fish in... Just leave the fish in till golden exterior and drain on a wire rack. Nice crispy exterior on the first, second a little more soggy (maybe it wasn't in long enough or cuz I added more flour). What I did though, was season while on the rack instead of the batter. Ground sea salt and ground lemon pepper. I also seasoned my house made tartar with Old Bay. (Tartar: Squeeze of lime, Mayo and sweet relish, Old Bay) Used a Samuel Adams Tasman red IPA and some bagged frozen Alaskan Cod (thawed) from Costco and it turned out epic. Better fish than the fish and chips at my work.

Very easy taste great! I used shrimp so I added 1/2 tsp old bay seasoning and fresh ground pepper. Sprinkled corn starch on so the batter would stick. The hotter the oil the better. Nice lite batter.

This recipe was phenomenal, earning rave reviews from my wife, our guest and I. I used a Sam Adams Lite in the recipe, and it gave the batter fantastic density and flavor. Word of advice, add a twist of lemon to the fish after it is fried; my wife couldn't say enough to that little zest I added.

Used summer shandy beer (lemon and beer) and fried onion rings and cod pieces.  Very light and tasty!  Will definitely make again!

I dipped jumbo fresh gulf shrimp in flour first as recommended, then dipped it in the beer batter, then rolled it in sweetened coconut and fried it in the deep fryer!  Yum!

This was the best fish I ever ate. I'm an avid fisherman and cook, so I eat a lot of fish. I dredged the fillets in flour before dipping them in the batter. I also forgot to add the egg to the batter, and I'm glad I did. Since it came out so good I won't even try to add egg next time. 

P.S. the type of fish was saugeye, pretty much walleye but a different name.

This was a great recipe. We made fish and onion rings. I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder to help give a little flavor and added a little more flour to make it thicker. No dredging in flour before hand but everything still came out great. Crispy fried deliciousness!

Thanks for the recipe! I actually used it on some pork chops and they came out great! I took some of the advice of earlier cooks and dredged them in a mix of 1 cup flour, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp brown sugar.

My husband and I live and fish in the FL Keys. We tried this batter on fresh caught snapper and grouper. DELICIOUS! My husband did add a little salt and extra flour to the batter. We also put some flour in a ziplock bag and coated the fillets with flour before dipping them into the batter. I am so glad that we tried frying up our catch with this beer batter. Just Superb! It's also really simple and easy, which we love.

OMG! This was soo easy! and sooo tasty!! I've always struggled with batters and this was simple. I took someone else's advice and dipped in flour then dipped in batter and dropped in hot oil.   Last night I cooked, broccoli, zucchini, asparagus, carrots and Tiger SHRiMP!! all dipped in golden batter.  Everything tasted like Tempura. I dipped my veggies in soy sauce and It was perfect!   oh oh ALSO! I substituted the egg with EGG BEATERS. and used equal parts of flour, "egg" and beer.   enjoy!    Thanks for the recipe

Good Recipe. I added my own seasonings to give the fish more flavor. If you know someone who can't have alcohol, you can subsitute Sparkling Water for the Beer and it will still taste just as good. Lightly coating the fish in flour before dipping it into the batter really helps the batter stick to the fish. To keep the fish crispy, make sure the cooking oil is hot (350-375 deg.) at all times during cooking and drain the oil from the fish after cooking by putting it on a cooling rack or on paper towels for cooking.

this was ok.  I think it needed more seasoning.  Next time I will add more. Also, I used a light beer. Next time I will use a good quality beer.  Maybe this will make it more flavorful.

We are not beer drinkers, but we've had beer battered stuff at resteraunts and liked it. This recipe had too much beer flavor for us. Next time I think I'm going to use chicken broth or something to see if that changes our views.
