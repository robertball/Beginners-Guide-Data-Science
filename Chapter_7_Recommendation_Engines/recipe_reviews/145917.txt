For champagne lovers, this is a nice change from a Mimosa or Poinsetta.  Adding a twist of lemon or orange adds a different take on this traditional, classic cocktail that is beloved by all.

I drink these all the time and love them.  One rater recommended a lemon twist--this is a great addition; however, try an orange twist instead--gives an entirely different taste.  Yum!

Simple, delicious cocktail. I always wondered what they were drinking when they order champagne cocktails in Casablanca.

Very good.  This was my first time using bitters and I really loved how this seemed to mellow out my champagne.  As a matter of fact some of my memory is a little blurry......  :)

I used to drink this all the time....thanks for reminding me how good it is.  Do not be tempted to use cheap champagne.  You are more likely to like this cocktail when using a champagne that you enjoy by itself.

This is a pretty good cocktail.  Nothing fantastic in my book.  There was a sweetness there that I did enjoy.

This is a unique way to serve champagne.  Just a little sweet (but not too much) and the bitters add an interesting flavor.

A good cocktail, but a little plain. I prefer my other recipe for champange cocktails. It is the same, except I add a shot of Brandy prior to pouring the champange. It is really delicious, and as a side bonus, your champange certainly goes alot further because people sip a little slower!

This was my first time with bitters, and I didn't really like it.  It might have been the champagne we used, but my husband and I won't try this again.

This is one of my favorite cocktails.  I prefer it with more than 1 drop of bitters and a orange twist, hence the 4 not 5 star rating.

Simple and refreshing beverage that changes flavor as the sugar cube dissolves. We really liked this!

This was a nice way to use leftover champagne, and I liked the sweetness from the sugar cube. Definitely adding a twist of lemon or orange makes it more interesting.
