I made this recipe into muffins instead of cake--I made sure to look this recipe over carefully to make sure I could do that. The only think I did adjust was the bananas (I ended up using three large overripe bananas, mashed and one regular banana, chopped). I ran the oats through my food processor to grind them down just a bit, for a finer consistancy, until it looked almost like a coarse wheat flour. We like the texture it adds to the baked goods. I also chopped my almonds as well. I made no other changes. I was able to get 12 muffins out of this recipe and I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. We really loved the different flavors and textures in this muffin. The oatmeal really went well with the orange, coconut and almonds. It was just lightly sweet, not overly so, and the muffin was just perfectly.......muffin-y. Out of twelve muffins, two remain. We REALLY enjoyed them. NOTE FOR ME: Next time, I'll try to make this a little lighter/healthier by using half whole wheat flour and substituting unsweetened applesauce for one of the eggs and part of the butter.

This recipe makes GREAT muffins.  They aren't very sweet, so if you're looking to satisfy a sweet tooth, you want to add some extra sugar.  But, as is they make for a FANTASTIC breakfast muffin.  The only thing I did different was to add a bit of coconut extract to accent the shredded coconut, and I also added a bit of freshly grated nutmeg.  Oh, and I toasted the almonds before adding to the batter.  D-E-Licious!  Definitely a keeper.

Yum! Loved the combo of oats, coconut and orange zest. Not sure if the bananas being sliced was a typo or not but I mashed mine and it turned out great. Made this twice already- thanks!

I didn't make any changes, and for me the banana/orange flavour works. But my hungry hordes were not entirely happy with it. So may not make it again.

I made the recipe and my family loved it. I used 4 ripped bananas, half honey and half brown sugar, and almond flour. Delicious!

Wonderful! Used half honey and half brown sugar, and cut that back a little since our coconut was the sweetened kind. Finely chopped the whole almonds we had. Took about 40 minutes to bake up.  Great flavor and texture.

I suggest adding 2-3 bananas! One isn't enough!

I don't know about the 5 star reviews but I made this according to the directions and it was very dry and dense and the orange was too strong.
