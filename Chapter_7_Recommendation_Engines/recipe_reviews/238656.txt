The jicama and cabbage slaw is crunchy and refreshing. I deleted the cayene and onion; added 1/3 cup craisins and 1 can of mandarine oranges. The next time I make the slaw, I may add toasted salted Sunflower seeds for protein.

It has a perfect blend of ingredients. I omitted the chili and cayenne & replaced it with a salt free chipotle blend. I am going top my beer battered fish tacos with it. Yum!

This was a great base. I hate it when people do this but here I go....  I did make some changes. I cut back on the  oil. 3 T olive oil & 1 T sesame oil. Added red and orange bell peppers as well as 1 T fennel seeds.  I also used 1 T of white vinegar in addition. I'll make a little more of the sauce next time and will consider adding jalapenos if they aren't too hot. Very nice.

Saw this when looking for ideas for sides for tamales. I paired it with  steak tacos. Really good. Never had jicama before. This item has been added to our rotation!
