You didn't say Buffalo wings so I assume that is not what you were making.  Better result by not marinading the wings (which should be separated), raise the oven temp to 450 deg and leave alone for 40 minutes.  Do not turn the wings.  Pour over the wings -Franks hot sauce mixed with melted butter and throw back in oven for ten minutes. Very good and you control the heat by the amount of Frank's

Thank you for an easy, tasty wing recipe! The only addition I made was to broil wings on both sides after baking for 20 min. each side to make them crispy. My husband & I have been looking for a good "baked" wing recipe ~ & you've done it !! Happy Eating !!

Great recipe!!  I used the cajun seasoning and Louisana Hot Sauce and they were wonderful!  I used a little more hot sauce than suggested - almost a full bottle for a pound of wings, and my husband and I loved them.  They were so hot they actually made my lips numb!

Great recipe, and I'll never pay $6.00 for a small order of hot wings again!

Just hot, not that good.  Add a little sweet to it, like honey or brown sugar.

I’m certain the wings would have been better had they marinated in a bowl rather than on a cookie sheet.  The hot sauce (We used LA Gold – love the stuff!!!) was only on 1 side.  Like other reviewers suggested – crank the heat (to at least 475) after turning the wings.  We cooked ours an additional 15 min. once turned.

I loved that a bowl is not needed and very easy to put together. I was expecting for the wings to be spicy but I did not find it spicy at all. I had a 6 ounce Louisiana hot sauce but still did not cover the wings so I basted them every hour while they were marinating and also basted once throughout baking before turning them. Like suggested - after turning the wings I raised the temp to 475 degrees F and baked for additional 15 minutes more.

I cooked the wings about 25 minutes on each side.  I like my wings somewhat dried out.  Also, if you like hot or tangy, use more spice/seasoning.  Great recipe though!

Thought this was quite good and easy.  I used cayenne and chili powder to sprinkle and Louisiana Hot Sauce.  It definitely had bite, though I would suggest putting sauce on both sides tho.

Pretty good recipe but I would like to offer up my baked wing version. Start with 30 wing pieces in a Ziplock bag, add enough hot sauce to coat the wings ( I use Frank's Xtra Hot sauce)and refrigerate for 2 hours. Using Shake n Bake Cajun, remove wings from bag, shake off extra sauce and toss in crumbs 10 at a time using the second envelope of Shake n Bake until they're all done. Place on a foil lined pan and bake @ 400F for 40 minutes. Wow! Hot and crispy wings when it's too cold to take the fryer outside. Of course you can adjust the heat with your choice of hot sauce. Add some veggies and dip and you're good to go.

I have made these for the last two years at our Christmas party and there is never a single one left. I love that I can just make these ahead and throw them in the crockpot until guests arrive. The only bad thing is that my husband tries to steal them all before the party. :)

I would have to say that I have never had baked hotwings before and liked the idea of less calories and fat (since that is why we do not have hotwings more often!)  BUT, these were pale, in flavor and consistency, almost like they were boiled or something.  I liked the marinadine idea so when I tried to make them the second time I put them in a bag with cajun seasoning and garlic spices, and let them sit there sealed over night.  I baked them at the higher temp like other reviews said, to get the crisp finish.  Then I shook half in hot sauce and the other half in a hot sauce/BBQ mixture and served with bleu cheese.  THAT was yummy!  And not fried!  My son and husband who always want wings are so happy that they can have them now!  Thanks for the recipe!

Big hit for the superbowl party.  Crank up the heat in the end to crisp 'em.  After they were done I tossed them with extra dashes of franks sauce

Everyone that I fed these wings to absolutely LOVED it.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was add a bit of garlic salt to the hot sauce.  Other than that, I'm definitely using this recipe again!

This is a very easy and hot recipe. Hot is on the tongue of the tastee! But anyone who thinks this is not hot needs either to have his/her tongue examined for defective taste buds or check out the spice cabinets. Cajun seasoning is very hot unless it has been sitting in the cabinet for a year or more or in a cabinet by the stove. Heat and age will decrease potency. Also knowing your hot sauces helps. I can't imagine making a  new recipe without tasting the sauce or seasoning  to make sure it is as hot or whatever that I want it. So don't diss a recipe until you do that!

This was so easy and tasty! I used almost a full 12 oz bottle of hot sauce to marinate and to add extra right before serving so they were very saucy. Also, they were so hot they made my lips burn. Excellent!

These wings are great, and really simple to make. You can vary the Cajun seasoning to heat level. I used the Cajun seasoning and then completely covered the wings with hot sauce in the morning, and refrigerated. Then baked the wings for an evening get together; they’re are a hit, and no wing maker needed! (Less grease)

These were just "ok" wings, which I doubt I'll make again. I've made them twice with the same outcome each time. The skin wasn't crisp, the sauce had dried up and they were kinda dry.

This was an easy, tasty appetizer.  I used chicken strips instead of wings and used Frank's hot sauce.  Not enough heat, so perhaps I'll try a spicier sauce next time.  I will be making these again. :-P

I did use less Cajun seasoning but otherwise followed the recipe!  Love how quick and easy they are.  I made too many but they were just as good the next day.  I reheated them on the oven and they came out oerfect!

Well for one thing I got the wrong wings.  I bought the full big dogs instead of the- well you know- regular wings.  I will try this recipe again to see if I did something wrong the first time; because they just weren't that good.  But I will try again.
