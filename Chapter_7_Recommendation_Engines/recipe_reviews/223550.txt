This recipe was very easy to make and tasted great!

I used stevia instead of sugar and served it over some herb-spiced quinoa. Next time I would definitely add some carrots and celery to the cabbage to make the flavours a bit more complex. Definitely something I will make again!

Tasty, I love cabbage. I am on a low sodium diet. This is great with unsalted butter and salt
