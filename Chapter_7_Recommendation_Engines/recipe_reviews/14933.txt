Great recipe. Simple and easy. It is very similar to my marinated bean salad recipe. This is definitely meant to be served cold so make ahead and put it in the fridge. I also prefer to use fresh mung bean sprouts as I find the canned too soggy and tinny tasting. The fresh ones add a nice crisp crunch to contrast with the softer canned beans. Really great.:) Try adding a pinch of celery salt to the vinegrette for an extra bit of flavour. Yum yum.:)

Not well liked at my house. I did not know whether to heat before eating or not. So I heated. I think that is the reason it did not turn out too well.
