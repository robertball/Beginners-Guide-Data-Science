Loved it...until I got to the Basil. Couldn’t bring myself to adding it! Just sounded wrong. I added mint leaves instead. Agreed with prior comment, that it’s more smoothie than milkshake. Who cares, it was good and refreshing!

I love strawberry shakes and a healthy one to boot! Woot! But I've never had the combination of strawberry and basil together before so curiousity got the best of me. I only used the five strawberries mentioned and wished I would have upped them by a few more...ok doubled them...because the strawberry flavor just wasn't enough for me at only five. The hint of basil was nice though and not overpowering. This drink just wasn't of a shake consistency to me...more like a smoothie. Perhaps it would have been more shake-like had I upped the frozen strawberries. Good though, and worth a try.
