I have been making a similar version to this for years. One of my favorites. 

I noticed a lot of reviewers mentioning how thin this chili was. DON'T drain or rinse the beans (even though the recipe tells you to). This will help thicken up your chili. Believe me, it will make a big difference. Not sure why you would rinse canned beans anyway.

This was so easy and quick to make! I did make a few changes though: it was a little bland, so I added a few more dashes of each spice, used fresh cilantro, 2 cans of great northern beans, and added a bit of flour to thicken. Simmered 5-10 minutes longer than recipe stated. The grocery store didn't have monterey jack cheese, so we used colby jack instead. Served with cornbread. My husband said, 'mmmmmm,' after every bite. Next time, I'll make a double batch so there are more leftovers! Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This recipe is a good starting point but really needed to be 'kicked-up' a notch. I tweeked it this way: used 3T. olive oil, one chopped purple onion, two cloves of chopped garlic and I added another can of cannellini beans that I had ground to paste in my mini chopper.  This really gave the mix the consistancy of chili rather than soup.  I used 3 chopped, precooked grilled chicken breast that I bought in my store's freezer section. (Don't knock 'em 'till you've tried them.  They're not bad.) A couple of shakes of celery seed, Louisiana red hot and 1/4 cup sherry and...look out!  You talk about good!!!
This is a great concept recipe but I think you'll be pleased if you take my recommendations.

I absolutely loved this.  Everyone who tasted it absolute love this.  However, I made some revisions as well:
Great Northern beans, 2 cans
Only used 1 cup of chicken stock
only used 2 chicken breasts 
Put probably 2 tbsp of cumin in it
Used salsa verde instead of green chiles (because  I couldn't find them.)
Used about 1 tsp of hot pepper
Used about 1 tsp of habenero sauce.
The people who say this is bland probably used no creativity.  Also:  DO NOT PUT THE BEANS IN BUT 5 MINUTES BEFORE EVERYTHING IS DONE.  Otherwise they WILL turn to mush.  Duh.

Made exactly as the recipe calls for, this was a bit bland. (more of a four star recipe). However,  I doubled the spices, except I added fresh cilantro (about 1/4 cup) instead of dried, as well as  the juice of a lime.  With those additions it was excellent.  it took my family forever to get to the table when I made it, so it boiled down to a thick mixture. Otherwise I would have needed to add some smashed beans for thickener.  I cooked the chicken breasts whole and just shredded them after they were cooked.  Much easier than cutting up raw chicken.
 I have six children who can be picky at times, but they all loved this chili.  This is definitely a keeper.

I made this chili for dinner last night for friends for our weekly 'Must See TV' get together. Everyone loved it! It was really easy to make. I did have trouble finding cannellini beans so I used a combination of small white beans and great northern beans instead. I also cut the amount of onion in half.

This was great! I scaled the recipe for 6 servings and used great northern beans. I added a total of 4 cans of the beans for the scaled 6 serving size which is a little more than it called for. I also used two 10 1/2 ounces of chicken broth instead of what the recipe had called for and this seemed to be the perfect amount.  I served it with some sour cream on the top of each bowl along with the cheese, we also had some tortilla chips for dipping and Waikiki cornbread (recipe on this site) on the side. It was delicious! I will Definatley be making this again and again.

I only gave this 3 stars--while it's a good start, I had to add a lot to it in order to make it more of a chili than a soup. I added a can of black beans, a can of corn, and about a TBL of chilipowder (can't have chili without chilipowder, after all)and it was great!

Instead of chicken breasts, I added one package of Tyson Southwest seasoned chicken breast strips (cut up) and 1/2 lb. of hot pork sausage.  I used other suggestions and added 2 cans (undrained) great white northern beans instead of the cannellini.  Most excellent - just the right amount of spice!

I made this tonight and was quite impressed! It's definitely worth playing around with spices, since it would be a bit bland as written. Also, as others suggested, I did not completely drain the cannellini beans, which made the chili a bit thicker, as desired. Ground turkey instead of cubed chicken and a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes (will add more next time) were the other major changes. Definitely a keeper!

I really love the flavor...I would consider it a great recipe for chicken tortilla soup rather than a chili bc as many other reviewers mentioned, its more of a soupy broth.

This was yummy and very quick and easy to make. I love one pot wonders. I forgot to get green onions at the store so I'll have to try that for next time. I didn't cook the chicken and onion separate. I added 2 raw chicken breast to the broth and spices with 1/2 an onion. and half way through I took the chicken out and cut them into bite size cubes. Used 2 cans of Great Northern Beans, drained, 2 cans of green chile peppers and added 1 cubed zuchinni squash. I intended to make Cha Cha's white chili and the ingredients are very similiar but in the end I didn't follow either recipe as far as chicken and bean ratio. I used 2 sprigs of fresh cilantro instead of using dried cilantro, I don't care for the dried one to much. My co-worker loved it and said I should be slapped. lolol We ate this with BLT sandwiches. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I think the title to this recipe is slightly misleading.  Chili conjures up visions of something that's thick and stew-like which this definately isn't if you make it as written.  While this recipe is really good, it's a soup more than anything.  Because I wanted to make something more "chili" like, I made a few changes.  Instead of cubed chicken, I used ground turkey.  I used two 4 ounce cans of green chilis to add more flavor without adding heat.  I also got two cans of beans and pureed 1/2 of 1 can.  I definately didn't rinse or drain them.  Also, I added the beans along with all of the other ingrediants and simmered it for 45 minutes.  The result was still a little thin but it was much more like chili.  Next time I will puree an entire can of beans and leave 1 can whole.  All in all it was a good recipe.  It made about 6 decent sized servings and between 4 people, there was nothing left.

This is a great base to a good white chili.  Like everyone else here I also added to this.  I added fresh chopped garlic, doubled the spices, added celery seed, hot sauce (like a buffalo wing sauce), fresh cilantro, 2 cans of beans and one of the cans I pulsed in my chopper.  I was surprised that there is no salt and pepper in this recipe.  Next time I will season to taste.  I also left the chicken breast whole until the very end.  I pulled them out and shredded them with a fork and put the meat back in and cooked for another 5 minutes.  I served with a dollop of sour cream.  Very good!!

I took this to our church for our chili cook-off. It won first prize for non-traditional chilis and soups. It was my husband's idea to enter it, because I made it before and he loved it.

I doubled the spices and used two cans of Great Nothern Beans. I drained the beans, but did not rinse them. I put one can into the Magic Bullet blender with some of the chili and blended. I then added this mixture and the other can of beans to the chili. Delicious! My bf said he liked better than traditional chili. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a staple in our home.  For those who don't like the consistancy try adding another can of beans and blend/process before adding.  I have given this recipe to so many people who all make it there own so I suggest you try it and experiment to your taste.

This recipe is super quick and easy.  My batch came out think more like a soup, I expect chili to be a bit thicker so next time I will probably use condensed soup instead of the chicken broth.  But it was still very tasty.  I served with cornbread.

Five delicious stars that sent the husband back for seconds! The minor adjustments I made to accommodate cooking for two using what I had on hand stayed pretty true to the original recipe: 1. Used one large precooked breast, shredded; 2. 1 cup broth; 3. 1/2 can chiles; 4. fresh cilantro; 5. 1 can navy beans but not rinsed; 6. no green onions. It made approximately 3.5 perfect and delicious servings. I didn't have problems with it being too soupy, but had higher bean to chicken ratio. I using more than one chicken breast, I recommend using more than one can of beans. (but please stick to white beans. It's WHITE chili!) Topped with jack cheese, sour cream, and jalapeno slices.

Following other poster's advice, I made adjustments. Doubled all spices (except cayenne, due to feeding young children), used fresh cilantro, 2 cans of navy beans (undrained and un-rinsed),  added 2T flour to thicken and used 3/4 cup chicken broth mixed with 1/2 cup water due to a broth shortage. Was DELICIOUS, not too thin, and my super finicky 5 year old who eats nothing but canned chicken noodle soup (and not even the GOOD canned ones) ate 3 bowls!

great recipe! i grilled and shredded the chicken first and added that to the onion. probably will use less chicken next time, too much. also followed another reviewer's suggestions and did not drain the beans, this thickened up the broth. otherwise, made to recipe. great white chili, thanks!

This was amazing! I threw everything into the crockpot, including two cans of beans. I ended up mashing an additional can of beans to thicken it up. Super tasty topped with shredded provel cheese. Yum!

Very good, though I'm not sure I would call this chili.  I'm accustomed to chili having a thick tomato-based sauce.  This really has no sauce, but more of a glaze I guess I would call it.  I substituted black beans for the beans called for in the recipe.  I also grilled and shredded the chicken instead of cubing and pan-frying.  I will be making this again.

Very VERY good! Per others before me, I used (2) 14.5oz cans of chicken broth. I really liked the advice of simmering, so I let the "chili" simmer on low for almost an hour before serving. My daughter thought this was too spicy but all the other adults enjoyed this alot! Will make this many times this winter! Thanks!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. Because of the consitency, I would have to label this a soup rather than a chili. I altered the recipe though--added 2 cans of broth and a lot of cayanne! I also allowed the mixture to simmer for two hours on low, so the flavors would infuse.

Outstanding and great for fiber and protein yet low fat.  I added 1 can Shoe Peg corn to my last batch, that gave it a Southwestern tinge.

There seemed to be too much chicken in this recipe and not enough broth.  I doubled the broth and added a dollop of sour cream to each bowl but something just didn't taste quite right.  A little bland.  Doubt I will make this recipe again.

This was a yummy meal both of us enjoyed. In the future I will add 2 cans beans to this amount of chicken, and increase the green chilis/add extra ground chilis to make this spicy. Thanks very much for submitting.

Delicious!  I did add a couple tablespoons of flour to thicken it a little and a dash more of each of the spices, plus a little garlic salt.  Fabulous flavor!  This one will be a hit!

Great recipe!  I used dry cannellini beans.  Get directions on how to cook them, but the quickie version is hydrate overnight and then discard water, cover with new water in sauce pan and cook for a couple hours til soft (I added garlic, salt, bay leaf). I did not have to use the chicken broth because I used the broth from the beans.  I had to omit the chilis because I did not have any, but  family still raved!  Served with chives and sour cream.

I love love love this recipe! I cook 1/2 lb of pork with the onion and green chiles, I add some diced ham, and I use a 6oz bag of precooked chicken (tyson). I also add a can of Great Northern beans for a total of 2 cans (drained) if I am feeling a thinner chili I will just add light beer till I reach the preferred consistency. Truly a FANTASTIC recipe. I have received many compliments on it and though I have been asked many times I can't bring myself to give the recipe away.... shhh it's our little secret.

good flavor but a little too soupy.  Would have been better if i had taken the recommendations of other reviewers into account.  I also think I added too much oil when cooking the chicken so it was a little greasy- I used thighs instead of breasts so that may also have caused it to be too oily.  Maybe draining the meat before adding the broth and other ingredients would have worked better.  Overall liked the flavors.

I substituted black olives (our kids live) for the green chilies (my wife hates).  But it remained mildly spicy and was applauded as "comfort food" I'm welcome to repeat any time.

Good chili recipe but I agree with others that it is a little bland and a little dry. I topped with some sour cream and colby jack shredded cheese.  I didn't measure the chicken broth just used a can of it and one and a half chicken breast. I made this in the the slow cooker. Placed everything in the crock raw chicken and all and cooked on low about 10 hours.

Super delicious. I pureed one can of beans and added a second can of whole beans. I also used ground chicken instead of cubed. I garnished the chile with the Green Salsa recipe that may be found on this site. It adds an incredible freshness to the chile and makes it hard to stop eating.

I boiled the chicken breasts with some chicken base to make my broth and sauted fresh garlic with the onions.  also, added a couple huge spoonfuls of salsa at the end for some extra color.

This is wonderful!

oh my goodness!  i'm normally a big critic of my own cooking, but this was awesome!  i even said it was good.  i added an extra can of beans, and i smushed up about half the extra can to thicken up the "chili" (more of a soup texture). i like my food a little spicy so next time i might add another can of chiles or serve with fresh jalapeno.  this is going on my regular rotation.

I am giving this recipe five stars because it was a good jumping point for a white chili. I did not follow this recipe exact...I used ground turkey instead of chicken cubes because I usually use ground beef in my regular chili. I also seasoned the turkey with poultry seasoning, garlic powder, white pepper and cayenne. I did not drain the beans (which were white northern)and I added a bit of flour to thicken. In addition I added some shredded mont jack cheese and pepper jack cheese to thicken. I added crushed red pepper and white pepper to the dish. Then I let it all simmer about 30 minutes. All in all the meal came out with a bite and thick just like chili and quite delicious!

This is a very good recipe.  I never tried "white" chili before this.  I'll definitely make this again - but with modifications.  I think I'll use low-sodium or sodium-free chicken broth or a combination of chicken broth and water to dilute the saltiness (my chili seemed quite salty, probably due to the broth) and will rinse my beans (also to remove extra sodium).  I tried Dierdre's suggestion and served with a pre-packaged salad mix and cornbread (I used a Jiffy mix).  To speed things up even more, I purchased a cube of smoked deli chicken and cubed it myself.  These two steps (pre-packaged sides and cubed deli chicken) made this a quick fix.  If I had more time, I think this chili would also go well with tortilla chips, chunky guacamole and caramel apple burritos for dessert.  Thanks for sharing.  This is a keeper!

This was good, but not great. I cooked it in a crock pot, so I omitted the oil. Like other reviewer's suggested, I did two cans of beans and I didn't drain them. I was afraid of getting something too soupy and not enough like chili, so I put the chicken breasts into the crock pot whole, and after the 8 hours was up, I shredded them and put them back into the mix, which thickened it up pretty well. I also added some white pepper. Overall, good, but I think I have another recipe I like better.

Very good.  Would probably add a bit more chicken broth next time, I like my chili more liquidy.  Otherwise would make again, possibly adding fresh cilantro.

This was a very tasty soup rather than a chili.  I did change a few things per other reviews.  I used 2 cans of broth, 2 cans of Great Northwestern beans, fresh cilantro and diced jalapenos.  My husband loved it!! Will definetly make again!

great taste, used fresh celantro. Suggest one use more broth and cook longer in pot.

Delicious! It only fed 2 people though, so I would add in another can of beans and broth. I did have to add a little more water, because there just wasn't enough, and then a little cornstarch to thicken. A great recipe, especially on cold nights, I will be making this regularly!

This recipe isn't wonderful or anything. But I gave it 5 stars because it's soooo easy and healthy. And it's pretty good as well. I put cilantro and montery pepper jack cheese on top. It was good that way. Nice quick meal for a cold night!!

BEST white chili recipe.... Period. I actually double the ingredients, just not the chicken. And it comes out so flavorful! I can cook it in my crockpot or really quick as last minute. I shred my chicken instead of cubing it and it really turns out amazing!

I was a little nervous making this because there were sooo many variations people suggested! But isn't it the greatest feeling when you try a new recipe and it turns out to be something you love! I stuck pretty close to the original recipe because of all the different variations I became overwhelmed...I used one less chicken breast and added a can of beans. Let one can cook a little longer so it did become a little more mushier because people were saying the consistancy wasnt quite "chili like". Spared the one onion chopped as well and a dash more of all the spices like everyone else said to do. It turned out great....good flavor and consistancy! This is getting added to the box! Thanks! :-)

Excellent flavor! This recipe turned out great. Will make again and again.  I made 3 adjustments: Added Mushrooms, Added a 1/4 cup water & 2 Tbsp cornstarch mixture, Added 1/2 cup pureed northern beans. The Beans and Cornstarch mixture really helped thicken the chili, and should be added after all ingredients are cooked, combined and simmering.

Made this as a few people suggested: cut chicken broth to 1 cup, used 2 cans of great northern beans not rinsed, used 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, 3 cloves of fresh garlic and increased the spices. I baked cornbread to go with it and honestly it had such a great flavor I left out the cheese.

Very easy meal- good, quick dinner. This was a hit with my family. I did, however, season to our tastes. It needed salt and pepper. I also added a 3rd can of beans. We'll do this one again!

AWSOME!! I have only had white chili one other time and it was good, I made this with a little Dr.ing of my own and it was better than I ever thought it would be! (I made mine a little more spicey)I also added sour cream and a bit of milk because i went overboard spicing it up, but it balanced it out and it was fabulous! Made quite a-bit so I ate it for about 4 days afterwards and it was still real good!

My favorite thing about this dish is its simplicity and ease. Made this on a Saturday before going to a movie. Also took the suggestion of making some cornbread and using a bagged salad. Perfect for a busy evening. I used a pre-packaged chili seasoning rather than using all of the ones listed. I enjoyed the flavor as did the boy. I would suggest however more beans to add some heartiness, the one can seems to not be enough.

I changed this a little bit to suit my tastes after throwing everything together as written...  It was decent that way, don't get me wrong, but for me, it needed something more to be "chili".  I added a can of great northern beans and a can of chickpeas.  I also added more cumin than called for and more cayenne.  I also added a few splashes of Franks Red Hot and a dash of liquid smoke.  Lots and lots of black pepper as well... It wasn't thin at all (probably due to my adding all those extra beans, eh?) and my husband enjoyed it.  Next time I think I'll use fresh cilantro instead of dried and maybe mince a fresh jalepeno or habanero for it as well.  Good recipe - tweak as you will... Yummy with hot buttered corn bread for sure!

I loved this recipe.  I would have rated more stars, but I made some changes to add some extra flavor to it.  Added more cumin, doubled the beans, used minced garlic instead of powder, added red pepper flakes, and a splash of cinnamon (the Ohio in me).  It was wonderful!  Great with cornbread!

very tasty! I used thigh meat, and Great Northern beans, because they were on sale. I also mixed all the spices and onion with the chicken and let it sit in the fridge for more than an hour. It REALLY seasoned the chicken beautifully. It was thin (more like soup), despite the fact that I didn't drain the beans, and cooked it longer to let it reduce. Next time I will puree some of the beans to give it more chili-like consistency.

Didn't have all ingredients listed, so I used what I had on hand - rotel tomatoes, cumin, cayenne pepper, onion, salt, black and pinto beans, corn, and chicken.  Put it all in the crackpot to cook all afternoon.  Added sour cream and cheese individually.  It was great!

Tasty!  My husband and I enjoyed this.  I felt it was maybe a bit soupy, and I think chili should be thick, hearty, and saucy.  Next time, I will thicken it with a bit of cornstarch.

Very good, we all loved it. I did end up adding and additional can of beans and smashed some to thicken up the broth a bit. It was too soupy for us otherwise. But the flavor is great! We didn't even top it, to make it healthier, and it's perfect.

Great recipe. The only thing I did different was add more cumin. My children would eat this several times a week if I made it. They top it with sour cream, salsa, and tortilla chips. Much tastier and healthier than the seasoning packets!!

Good but definitely needed more seasoning.  I only used 2 chicken breasts and 1/2 onion. Also used fresh cilantro.  The rest of the seasonings I kept the same as original recipe.  I also did not drain the beans.  Topped with sour cream and cheese.  Worth making again

I prepared this dish on Sunday and heated on Wednesday for dinner.  My husband and I love the wonderful mix of flavors and texture.  Very easy to make and not expensive at all!

This was really easy but the flavor was on the flat side.  I will try it again but use ground chicken or turkey, add fresh garlic  and some more spices to boost the flavor.

Good chili. I actually let this simmer for 2 hours. I added a 2 cups of chicken broth and a can of pureed white beans and 1tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it up. Topped it off with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Yummy.

Given 4 stars instead of 5 because the recipe does need a little 'tweaking' to suit individual tastes. However, it was wonderful and quick. I made the following changes (made for enough fro 2 people):  To lower calories/fat I completely left out the cheese.  It was so tasty I didn't notice.  I used one can of Great Northern beans (couldn't find cannellini beans), drained. I used another half can of Great Northern but mashed them up before adding so the chili would thicken. After reading the reviews a lot of them said it was too runny....This step made the chili really thick but I like it that way. I suppose if you want it 'soupier' then add more broth or use flour instead of beans to thicken. I also added about a 1/2tsp of cayenne rather than 1/8tsp but I like SPICY.  Instead of cooking the chili with the chicken, I seasoned chicken breasts and baked them in the oven. When done, I cut the chicken into cubes and added them on top of the chili mixture. A dollop of fat free sour cream and some fresh green onions on top and it was a PERFECT meal.   I didn't cook the chili with the chicken because I wanted to control my portions and if there were leftovers, I don't like to freeze and re-heat meat so I try to cook only the amount of meat we will eat at one sitting.  The only thing I would do differently is add fresh cilantro rather than dried.  Cornbread and a salad and you have dinner lickity-split!

We liked this a lot. I did make some changes. I increased the oil to 3 T. I used the leftovers of some roasted rosemary chicken breasts we had earlier in the week and shredded them up. I used only 1 cup of chicken broth. I doubled all the spices except for the cumin and oregano. The oregano I left as is because we don't like a strong oregano flavor, and I tripled the amount of cumin.  I also added a tablespoon of chili powder, and some celery seed, lime juice, and a few shakes of Frank's Red Hot. I used three cans of beans (not drained) -- two great northern, and one black. I pureed one can of the great northerns. I also added a can of drained corn. I put the whole thing in a slow cooker on high for a few hours, and served with sour cream and shredded cheese. We loved it, and used tortilla chips to scoop it with. And the kids didn't complain of it being too spicy, but it seemed just spicy enough to my husband and I. We'll be adding this to our rotation for sure.

This is a flavorful chili, but had too much onion for my taste.  I used 3/4 of a medium onion, and still seemed too overpowering.  The other spices add good flavor, but next time would cut back to at least half the amount of onion.  I did not have the issue of this being too thin...only a small amount of thin liquid in the bottom of the bowl.  Great with a little of the cheese and some crackers.  It is a bonus that this soup isn't loaded with fat, too!

I added a LOT more cumin/cayenne (and white pepper!) to taste because I like chili hot, and it was great! Got rave reviews at the chili cookoff at work, I highly recommend this recipe and will definitely make it again. Would try adding more dried cilantro next time, didn't feel like that taste came through much.

Great!  Our guests asked for the recipe.  I added 2 cloves minced garlic, some green bell pepper, and put in only part of the green chilis.  Served with sour cream, cilantro and shredded sharp cheddar.  Excellent!

Great recipe.  This is the second time I have made it.  First time I followed the recipe exactly.  It was great!  This time I added a can of creamed corn.  It made it a little thicker which is to my husband's liking and gave it a little more depth.  This was so simple and fast and tastes even better the next day.

Used fresh jalapenos instead of chilies. Also used red pepper instead of cayenne. Added another can of garbanzos in addition to the navy beans. Was good, but I added several cups too much chicken broth by accident so mine was too watery to compare to what it is supposed to be like.

Very tasty. In between a soup and a chili, even when I added some cornstarch. Adding sour cream and some crunched up chips makes the soup great!

I did this as a slow cooker meal, since it was a busy day! I barely made any changes to the recipe...instead of dried cilantro, I used frozen, fresh cubes of it. I also used just a bit more of what was required to suit my tastes. Since I love spicy (the hotter the better!), i added some hot sauce to my bowls. My husband and I enjoyed this chili, and it was GONE by the end of the evening! Fully enjoyed it, and will make it again!

My husband and I were looking over different recipes trying to come up with something different for dinner. We came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. I am definitely glad we did ! This was awesome!

I followed the advice of some others and mashed up some Great Northern beans to act as a thickener. I also added extra garlic powder because we like garlic. It turned out so good ! I doubled it so we would have enough for lunches tomorrow. 

I think the best compliment came from my husband. He commented that we definitely needed to add this to the regular possibilities for dinner.

My son did not care for it because of the green chilies, so when I make it next time I'll set some aside for him before adding the green chilies.

This is reall good, but I do add some ingredients to make it extra tasty. First I use two cans of great northern beans, I drain and rinse one and per other reviews, I mash and do not drain the other. I use a whole can of chicken broth - about two cups. I add the juice of half a lime before cooking, and the other half when serving. I add both hot pepper sauce like louisianna hot sauce - to taste, and green tobasco. I use two cans of fire roasted diced green chiles. I don't use the dried cilantro - my husband doesn't like it, but I bet this would be great with fresh cilantro, maybe as a topping. I throw everything into a crock pot, omit the oil. I just throw the chicken in frozen and shred it 1/2 hour before serving. I cook it on low all day. When serving, I top this with sour cream, green onions, avacado, cheese and optional chips to put in the bottom of your bolw. Really good!

I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  My husband loved it.  The kids even ate it!  Next time I need to make a larger batch. I used only 3 chicken breasts and two cans of beans(1 pureed).  I kept the measurements the same on all other ingredients.  I added a little chili powder in addition to the cayenne.  I also chopped up a green pepper and threw it in.  I topped it with pepper jack cheese, sour cream, green onions and avocados.  Awesome recipe!

I have had this recipe for years. I make it all the time. It is SO delicious, my husband practically begs for me to make this. It is one of my favorites. I make cheezy biscuits to go along with the chili and they are both gone the day I make them! Delicious!

I liked this better than another white chili I found on this site. I'm not sure what made the difference tho, and I can't think of what the other recipe was called. Anyhoo - I made the following substitutions based on what I had on hand: great northern beans for cannelli beans, 1tsp onion powder for onion, 2 cups water + 2tsp chicken bouillion for canned broth, and 1/4tsp coriander for dried cilantro. I doubled the broth, chicken and beans, and it was too much meat for me. Next time I would double the beans and broth only. I wanted it kind of soupy because I dumped it over cornbread. My family enjoyed it, thank you much!

This was the best white chili I've eaten. The only adjustment I made was doubling the green chiles, since we like more heat, and simmering it longer for a "tighter" chili. Great balance of flavors and spices. Pepper jack cheese added an additional kick.

Chili was really good but only with a few modifications. I added 1 can of creamed corn, extra oregano, garlic powder and cayenne.  Also instead of shredded cheese added 4 oz of Mexican velveeda and topped each bowl with a spoon of salsa.

This was a great recipe. My family enjoyed it and my friends wanted the recipe. This recipe has a great flavor to it. I served it where you could add the following to your bowl: fresh cilantro, shredded Colby cheese, green onion, sour cream, salsa and some corn chips.  Really yummy!

My recipe is just about like this but I put 2 cans of shoe peg corn and 2 cans of Northern beans undrained in stead of the ones you use. I also put crumbled corn chips inth bottom of the bowl and grated Montrey Jack cheese top off with the soup

I made this and my family loved it!  I used an entire can (2 cups) of chicken broth and also a can of cream of chicken soup.  We're also taking advantage of our fresh herbs so I substituted 1 Tbsp fresh cilantro, 1 1/2 tsp fresh oregano and also used 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  We will definately be making this again!

I thought this was more like soup than chili.  Next time I'll follow the advice of one of the other reviews and chop some of the beans so they work to thicken the broth.  I took the advice of some of the others and added a can of Northern Beans, Yuck!!!  The cannellini beans are definately the best way to go.  Also, I'll shred the chicken next time instead of leaving it in small cubes. All-in-all a wonderful recipe.  Definately a keeper.

I didn't have cilantro leaves so I used ground coriander instead.  I also included some chopped fresh red bell pepper with the onion and chicken. 
My kids (ages 2 and 5) weren't that interested in it but I thought it was delicious!

this recipe is great!  very easy if you use already cooked chicken.  i used left over crockpot chicken (chicken pieces, 2 ribs celery, 1 sliced apple, and 1 sliced onion with enough water to cover chicken.  discard all but ckicken after 8 hours on low.  debone and use in any chicken recipe).  i also used great northern beans.  since i had a can of chicken broth, i used the whole can.  didn't want to leave any to waste!  great quick and easy recipe.

After reading the reviews of this recipe I anticipated it being bland, so I followed the advice of others and added extra spices, used two cans of Great Northern Beans, etc...  However, it was still very bland and I think I may have over cooked it.  I let it simmer for extra time to thicken it up but then the beans turned to mush.  I will not be making this one again.

This was one of the best turkey chili recipes i've seen. it was zesty and delicous! I embellished a little by dusting the top with a little Emeril's southwest essence along with the cheese and green onion!

The chili had a good flavor but this still isn't the recipe I'm looking for.  I'm looking for a thicker, creamier white chili like the one I found at a local tea room.  I thought this chili had too much chicken in it.

We eat very little red meat, so this recipe was a great find. I changed and added a few things in the original recipe and now it will be a winter staple for us. I reduced the chicken stock by 1/4cup and added a can of chopped tomatoes and a can of red kidney beans. I also waited until I added the beans to add the cubed chicken. Boneless chicken has a tendency to get tough if you cook it too long. Absolutely delicious.

This is a great recipe.  I only changed a few things.. I used 4 chicken thighs and 1 chicken breast because that's what I had.  I baked the chicken rubbed in cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and pepper.  Cooled it and chopped it up. I added fresh minced garlic cloves, 2 cans instead of 1 chopped green chilies.  1 minced Serrano pepper, 1 can of low sodium chicken broth and three cans of great northern beans.  I drained 2 of the cans. I added the seasoning in the recipe Plus 2tblsp of fresh chopped cilantro.  It was tasty and like any chili, stew or soup will be even better tomorrow!

I made this recipe, and it was delicious. I was shocked to go into my cupboard and learn that I was out of cumin! So, I thought carefully and went another route and added yellow curry instead... just a few sprinkles. Knowing the health benefits, and still being on the "white" side, I thought why not? I also added butternut squash and carrots since I already added a little of yellow:) It was yummy! Healthy, hearty, and very tasty!

Made it exactly as stated, but it needed more beans, so I added a can of kidney beans. I made it this week because I was sick and wanted some 'chicken soup'. Both my girlfriend and I were surprised how good it tasted given the simplicity of the recipe. This recipe will definitely be in the rotation now.

I've made variations of this recipe. In my opinion, this recipe is a bit bland. I doubled the amount of green chiles and used white pepper instead of cayenne. I also used fresh garlic to start in the sauté and added powdered as needed to taste.

The flavors on this are really good. I thought this was a bit soupy as others said. I felt like it was missing something that I couldn't place my finger on. I will make this again probably in my slow cooker so those flavors intensify.

I used my immersion blender for a second or two to thicken it up.  This could have used a tiny bit of salt, but I served with cheese and chips, which took care of that. It was very filling on its own.  Next time I will kick up the heat a bit, but overall a keeper!

I used ground white turkey as I didn't have chicken breasts.  This recipe is awesome...lots of flavor.  The chopped green onions on top made it taste fresh and lively.

This one is a keeper!!!!

This is the first time I've ever made a pot of chili and had NO LEFT OVERS!!  The entire family loved it.  I would however lessen the amount of oregano in it, but everything else was amazing!!  I used 2 kinds of white beans.  We topped it with sour cream and green onions and it was perfect!!

I felt like this recipe called for way too much chicken. Next time I would do a single chicken breast and just shred it up instead of cubing it. I didn't like the ratio of liquid to chicken, beans, etc. It was not thick like I expect chili to be. In my opinion, the recipe, as it's written, only deserves 2 stars. With changes it could be much better.

Easy and tasty!! I did cook my chicken separately all the way so I wouldnt have to worry about it being pink when I combined all the ingredients. Instead of using garlic powder I used 2 cloves of garlic.

Pretty good--I ate with tortilla chips--helped with the lack of salt.  May add a little salt next time.

I tweaked this slighty.  I used about 2 cups of broth and added 2 cans of beans.  I thickened it with about 1 T of Masa flour.  Very filling.  I was able to get 4 large bowlfuls. Tasty!!

I used left-over cooked chicken meat from the freezer and put everything (except the wine and cheese) in the slow cooker for about 6 hours on high.  I cut the veggies in pretty small pieces since I chose to use a Crockpot.  This recipe required a lot of "knife work", but the dish turned out great.  Oh, and I topped the bowls off with parmesan cheese instead of Monterey Jack...

This is such a good recipe.  I did make a few changes such as I replaced the green chilies with a can of tomatillo (green) salsa.  I added in a can of corn (drained) and a squeeze of lime.  A nice change of pace from the traditional chili. Family loved it.

i only rated it a 4 because when I doubled the recipe I had to add more ingredients. I used extra diced green chiles, added about 6 cloves of minced garlic & because I only had (soaked) dry beans I had to keep adding water and bouillon (I had no broth)- about 8 cups total- which means I didn't have to add any salt to the recipe. I didn't top it with any cheese because I am allergic.  VERY VERY good recipe!

Very good recipe and very easy to make.  Even my very picky boys loved it!  The only thing I changed is I added a minced jalapino and an extra can of beans with it's liquid to thicken the chili.  This recipe will be a regular in our house.

Pretty good, although I did alter per some other reviewers suggestions: I used 2 cans of beans, one of them mashed with liquid and all. I also added a can of cream corn, fresh cilantro and jalapenos in addition to the green chiles

I have mixed feelings about this. There is way too much chicken, I would really recommend using only two chicken breasts. I slow cooked the chicken the green chili/broth mixture until the chicken shredded easily. It was still an odd consistency for chili. I can't imagine dicing it would be much better as it would make it much more runny. The cayenne needs to be increased and adding chili powder improves flavor. The concept is good...execution needs some tweaking to get something delectable.

Yummy! The only changes I made to this recipe was added fresh cilantro, a teaspoon of flour, a bit of chili powder to taste and did not rinse the beans. I then brought the mixture to a light boil to thicken it up a bit. It all depends on how thick and spicy you like it! I served it with a dallop of sour cream and crushed scoops. The rest of the family doesn't normally stray from regular chili but they loved this - they came back for thirds! Will make again and again...

I did not care for this recipe. The ratio of ingredients is all wrong. Too much chicken, the beans are not enough and turn to mush, the spices need to be at least doubled. There would be way too much to change to make this a good recipe. I would just keep searching for another one. :-(

I liked this a lot. I thought I had green chilis but I only had diced, canned , jalapenos so I used that which made it really spicy. I forgot the cliantro(whoops) and I added a little chili powder.  I used my stick blender to puree up some of the soup because all those beans would have scared off my kids and hubby, which made it less broth like.  I simmered it for about an hour  and then used a little cornstarch slurry to thicken it. It was very thin. I served with shredded pepper jack and crushed tortilla chips. It was more like a spicy chicken soup with beans.  My whole family ate it and liked it. I was pleased.  It tasted like something from a restaurant. I wish I had not forgotten the cilantro. I also think it would be good with a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis in it.

Good, but bland.  Per another white chili recipe I have...  added 2 T. flour for thickening, an extra 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Also added a drained can of corn.  EXCELLENT after adding the changes!!   Oh, also added the Jack cheese and sour cream on top which really made it.  Delicious!

Very good, and super quick.  I use canned chicken breast in place of the cooked chicken. I used two 13 oz cans (the kind from Sams's Club). Went to make this and realized I didn't buy canellini beans! Had some navy beans, so I used those instead. I also used the 7 oz can of green chiles I had in the pantry, and a whole can of chicken broth. It was very good. My 6 year old asked for seconds, so it is a winner in my book.

As the recipe is it is good but it's great when you add a bit more broth.  I also added a can of hominy and some more  spices. I finished it offl with a dollop of sour cream  and some green onions diced and mixed in with chopped fresh cilantro and chopped tomatoe with a splash of lime juice.  DELICIOUS!!!!

WONDERFUL!  I "combined" the suggestions of the first 5 reviewers.  I doubled the beans, nearly doubled the spices (abt 1/2 more on each), didn't drain the beans, added beans abt 5 minutes before time to eat.  I did had 1/4 cup more broth but that's because after simmering, I let the soup sit for about 45 minutes to really get that spice into the chicken.  WOW!  I was SO amazed just how good it turned out!  I would say if you like really spicey, add more spice.  I cut the chicken into little cubes.  There's enough soup for at least 7 bowlfuls especially with the extra beans.  I would think 1 1/2 cans would be plenty.  Next time, I will drain the beans & add extra broth & some flour or cornstarch.  See what happens.  YUMMMMMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My whole family loved this recipe!! I tripled all the ingredients except the chicken and had plenty for our big family. There was plenty of chicken with 4 large breast halves, even tripling the other ingredients. Using fat free chicken broth and just a pinch of low fat cheese makes this an very heatly, low-fat meal! Will definitely make this often!

I added some fresh cilantro, and used two cans of great northern beans (undrained and unrinsed) instead of one can of cannellini. I thought it was spicy (my 1/8 tsp of cayenne was heaping) and delicious!

I get kind of grossed out when I put undrained beans in soup, but it's a little watery without so I added a can of cream of chicken soup and the consistency was perfect. I also added a can of corn, a half can of black beans, and a little salsa for color. Served with tortilla chips - yum.

Very nice flavor and extremely easy to make.  I have added this to my recipe box and will make again and again.  I omit the cayenne and spoon out a little into a medium sized covered dish and set aside for my kids, then I add some of the cayene to the pot and cook for about 30 minutes.  We all love it!

This is the perfect, basic chicken chili recipe. It can be easily modified to taste; I use fresh garlic and fresh peppers, and I add more beans, broth and cayenne pepper. Love it!

Wow! This was VERY good! Great flavor and very easy to make. My 4-yr-old liked it (even with the chilis) and my husband asked that I make more the next time...it's always a good sign when he says, "next time." I used fresh chili and added some frozen corn, and as suggested, I did not drain the beans and I added a little bit of corn meal to thicken it up--perfect! I also served this with the Waikiki corn bread recipe from this site and that was great, too. I had never made "white" chili before, but with this recipe, I'll definitely make it a lot! Thanks :-D

I love the spices in this recipe and I've made it several times just as listed. Tonight I decided to kick it up a notch, so I used a can of diced jalapeno peppers instead of diced green chiles. Great if you like spicy! I served it over rice to cut the heat. My husband said his lips were numb but he ate the entire bowl.

Very good with a couple modifications.  I used three hefty chicken breasts (1.77 lbs) chopped into chunks and cooked them with onion and three cloves of garlic.  Just using garlic powder isn't garlicky enough for us. :)  I only added 1/3 of the container of the green chilis because I prefer my chili mild; my boyfriend, who can tolerate more heat, just added extra chilis on top when we dished it out.  Like some other reviewers suggested, I doubled the beans (two cans of cannelloni) and smooshed 1/2 of them with a potato masher.  Served with buttermilk cornbread, and topped it with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  Yum!

It deserves 4 and a half, but it won't let me do half. I used dried beans which I drained before adding the broth, a fresh Aneheim pepper from my garden, and ground turkey. I agree, it needed something. Lime juice was an amazing addition and with some salt, the flavor was great. It wasn't as pretty as it would have been if I had used chicken; if I used the ground turkey again, I would add black beans in as a subtle flavor addition and to add an asthetic touch. Habenaro would probably give a better flavor than either the suggested canned chili pepper or the aneheim I used (just do NOT include the seeds unless you like it really spicy and remember the longer you cook it, the spicier it gets).

I have made this chili several times. It is healthy and delicious. I have substituted ground turkey, ground chicken breast and precooked cubed chicken breast, all of these sustitutions tasted great. I like the small white beans better than the larger ones. I make a batch and freeze it in single portions to take to work with me.  It freezes well.

This was fantastic! I gave only 4 stars because I did make alterations based on others reviews. I added an extra bit of each spice, extra can of beans, and I added 2 pieces of bacon chopped up for more of a smoky flavor....great stuff! This is a keeper.

We loved it! The store didn't have chopped green chiles, so I used a can of Rotel mild with green chiles drained really well, and the recipe was fine! I did need to thicken sauce a bit with cornstarch, but next time I would use less chicken broth to make it thicker. I also did not drain the beans.I served with a side of rice for those who wanted it. This is heart-healthy and delicious!

I've made this recipe twice now, and my husband and I love it.  Just a few modifications: we don't care for chunks of onion, so I use onion flakes.  I also add 1 C corn and 2 teas chili powder.  My husband likes pinto and navy beans, so we use a can of each.  It's delicious, low-fat, low-cal (without the toppings), and very easy to prepare!

I have made this several times, but have altered it a bit.  I am a big fan of crock pot cooking as I work late, so I cook the chicken in the crock pot all day in chicken taco seasoning and then shred it for the chili.  The last time I added a bag of frozen corn that was a big hit.

I thought this chili had a lot of good flavor.  I especially liked how easy and quick it was to prepare.  I think the chili would have been better if it were thicker.  Next time, I may try adding a can of pureed beans, some flour, or maybe some crumbled tortillas to the chili.

This recipe was great! Very easy to make.  I added an extra can of beans, some Adobo seasoning, garlic, and chicken bullion cubes for a little extra taste.  We also added a can of corn, which seemed to fit right in.

Wow, this was fantastic.  I never make chili, but my husband loves chicken and I decided to try something new.  He and I both loved it.

The only changes I made were that I added one whole can of rinsed cannelini beans and then I took a half of another can and mashed them up (recommended my another reviewer) as a thickening agent.  It worked well.  I also added a little more cayenne and some chopped green pepper for another texture.  I omitted the green chilis and cilantro, just becuase I didn't have them and also omitted the cheese, just becuase I forgot, and I don't think we missed any of those ingredients.

I served the Chili over white rice with mini corn muffins on the side.  I will be making this one again and again!

This was very good! I used butter beans instead because that's what we had, omitted the cilantro & green chilies because we didn't have those, sauteed minced garlic with the chicken and onions before adding the liquids, added a little heavy whipping cream to make the broth creamy, was generous with the jack and added grated parmesan cheese. Served with garlic bread and salad. Also used chili powder instead of cayenne pepper.I guess it was a chili-less chili, but it pleased some hard-to-pleasers :)

This was a little more "herbally" than I care for.  I'm looking for a recipe that tastes more chili-ish.  I may try this again, but next time I will eliminate the oregano and try adding some traditional chili pepper seasoning.  I tripled this recipe for my family of 6, (was hoping to have left-overs) but I wouldn't think that would have effected the flavor of the recipe.

Biggest complaint I see is that the chili is too soupy - either don't drain the beans and add flour, or do a rouge to get thickness - rouge is just flour and oil cooked over low/med heat slowly, and stirred constantly to get to a redbrown color - done mostly on Gumbo.

left out the green chiles and used jalapeno, also used fresh cilantro. I used a lot more onion and pureed it with some of the chicken broth, so it was a little bit thicker. 

Went over well with family.

This is one of my favorite recipes. The only change I make is to use 2 cans of cannellini beans instead of one, and sometimes I will use Great Northern Beans if I can't find cannellini. 

Once the chili is in the bowl, I also add a dallop of sour cream to the bowl and stir. This thickens it up a bit and has a nice taste to it.

Delicious and so easy to prepare. I had a bit more chicken (already boiled and shredded). Added a bit more cumin and tripled the broth because there was so much chicken. Topped with sour cream, green onion and shredded Monterey jack cheese. Wonderful meal. Served with cornbread and a Mexican Cucumber Salad.

Absolutely delicious!  I tried this once about 3 weeks ago with disappointing results.  I tried it again because I love all the ingredients in it, with success this time!  What I did differently this time was use pre-cubed, pre-roasted chicken from Tyson....last time I boiled the chicken on my own and it was so, so tough.  It kind of ruined it.  Also, while sauteeing the chicken with the onion, I put a clove of minced garlic in there too instead of garlic powder later.  I love garlic and this really gave it a great flavor.  Yum!!! It exceeded my expectations the second time around.  A healthy and VERY easy meal.  Thanks Dierdre!

Very good! I added a can of great northern beans (in addition to the cannelini beans) to make this a little "chunkier"...otherwise would have been more like a soup than a chili as other readers mentioned. I followed the rest of the recipe as it is except I added salt and pepper and simmered for an hour. My beans did not get mushy as others mentioned.

Well liked by the family. I made just minor adjustments. I used 2 cups chicken broth and felt the extra was definitely needed. I sauteed garlic with the onions and chicken rather than using garlic powder. Since my family is not fond of real spicy foods, I only used one fourth tsp cumin and just a dash of cayenne pepper. I did not have cilantro so skipped that. We found this recipe quick to make and very tasty. We will be making this often. Thanks Dierdre!!!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe.  In fact, I made it the first time on a Monday and the following Thursday my husband asked me to make it again!  This time I tripled the recipe so that I could share it with our friends.  I did change a few things - I used Northern Beans instead of the Cannellini Beans, I used both minced garlic and garlic powder and I used fresh cilantro.  I altered the recipe a little, but as long as you use the ingredients listed, this is one AWESOME chili!!!

I had nothing but rave reviews from the people I served it to. I used the northern beans though and I used a cajan flavored bean.
I cooked my chicken ahead (boiled it) then I shredded it and cooked this in a slow cooker.(no oil) I served with crushed tortilla chips,cheese,onions & sour cream on the sid. YUM

This was delicious!!  Per Dreginek's recommendation, I used 2-14.5oz cans of chicken broth and simmered for an extra hour or so.  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) I'll add an extra can of cannellini beans to make the dish chunkier.  Loved it!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I thought this was awesome.  I used a pound of chicken.  Broth I used 2, 15oz. fat-free/reduced sodium. Green diced chiles I used 7 oz can. 2 cans of the beans. No cilantro because hubby hates it.  I thought this was awesome.  Will definitely cook it again!

I liked the flavor of this a lot, but hubby didn't like it...he said the beans made it too dry.  Oh, well...what does he know?  :)  I thought it was yummy and a nice change from traditional chili.

So many people that I cooked this for asked me for the recipe.  It is delicious and healthy...the only draw back is that it is not as good when reheated.  (But still scrumptous.)

Oh, this was so good! I used one already-cooked chicken breast and 1/2 pound of ground chicken.  It was all I had, but was great anyway. My husband loved it, and I'm going to keep the ingredients for this in my pantry at all times!  Thanks!

I can't say enough about this recipe...it's wonderful.  I didn't add the diced green chiles or the cayenne pepper or the green onions (husband doesn't like any of them).  I also used a 15 oz. jar of Randall's Northern Beans instead of the cannellini beans.  I have made this many, many times since copying the recipe and can't speak high enough about it.  Thanks for the recipe, it's become a family favorite!

This recipe was delicious!  Even my husband, "white chili isn't real chili", loved it.  I took the advice of others and reduced the amount of chicken broth, added more beans, and topped with tortilla chips.  This one is definately a keeper.  Thanks!

I made this for my in-laws, and we all loved it!  I added an extra can of beans, used no-fat chicken broth, and left out the cheese, and it was still great.  I simmered it for 45 minutes instead of 15, and it married the flavors really well.

This recipe hardly needs another rave review, but I thought it was outstanding.  Very flavorful and very easy to make.  It was soupier than I expected, but some nice multi-grain rolls took care of that quite well.  This would not serve 5 in MY family!

Fantastic-We LOVED this!  I added an extra can of beans and a bit more spice to heat it up a bit. I served it with sour cream, cheese, onions and corn chips on top.  To die for!  Try it-it's a keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe!  My husband and I loved it.  I will be making this regularly.  I made a few substitutions.  I used Northern beans (undrained) and 1/2 an onion.  I left out the chilies but added extra pepper. I also added a few tsp of flour to thicken.  Top it off with the cheese and a plop of sour cream.....Excellent eating!!

I doubled this recipe and should not have doubled the broth.  It was a little soupy and I had to thicken it.  My husband and I loved it.  My kids were a little leary of it because of it's gray color, but once coaxed they loved it too!One of them added sour cream to her bowl and that was a good addition also.

I had a recipe like this years ago that I found in a magazine.  It used 1 lb. of dry navy beans and it would take hours for it to boil on the stove.  My friends and family always raved about it.  This recipe is so much easier and it tastes as good as my other recipe. For any one who isn't sure about trying this recipe, go ahead and try it, it's fabulous!

This recipe was wonderful, but kind of an off-white chili rather than white.  It is a bit ugly - the topping is a good cover-up.  A great alternative to regular chili!

I like things a little spicier I guess, this seemed a bit on the bland side and couldn't hold a candle to regular chili.  If I try it again I will be sure to spice it up!

I turned to this recipe when I couldn't find my usual white chicken chili seasoning packet at my local grocery store.  What a great surprise!  It was simple to make using ingredients I already had on hand and tasted much better than with the store-bought seasoning packet.  We love it served in bread bowls and topped with shredded English Cheddar.

It’s a great base recipe. I added corn, salsa verde, Sazon and pinto beans. I’m very happy with the way it turned out. The consistency was just right.

Easy to make. 2 chicken breasts go along way. I suggest doubling if you want leftovers. Enjoyed by everyone, including those that dont like spicy food. Add avocado and cilantro when serving for a nice upgrade.

As others have said, this is a great start. I doubled up on the spices, and also instead of cubing the chicken I cut it into strips and before I added the beans I used a potato masher to shred the chicken. And a little corn starch thickened it all up nicely.

It was very good but a little watery for a chili. I added a little corn starch to thicken it. I would also have liked some zuchini in it or some rich. But it was easy to make and very much a comfort food. I'll make it again.

I have been making this for years and this particular recipe is a real keeper. This time I used only 2 boneless chicken breasts, 3 cans of cannellini beans and about a cup more chicken broth. I doubled the spices (cumin rocks!) and added about two cups of shredded cheese to thicken it up some. Turned out AWESOME!!!!

Great recipe. Interesting flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except I had to use more oil to make the onions come out right. I used about a teaspoon of coconut oil. This is my first try at chicken chili. I like it!

Pretty good, though a bit bland. Next time I cook it, I will use more of the spices and maybe add salt.

Super easy and fantastic! 

For those who felt it was bland,  it may be the type of cililis you used?  I used a can of Herdez Jalapeño peppers - definitely not bland.   However, it was too thin for our liking, so I suggest mashing half of the beans to thicken.

As others have said, I think this recipe provided a great starting point.  I just changed a few things to suit my tastes.  First, I only used 2 chicken breasts (not 4 - this resulted in about 1.4 lbs of chicken total).  Second, I shredded the chicken instead of cubed it (figured that would let more flavor get into the chicken).  Third, I doubled the beans (to change the bean/chicken ratio).  Fourth, to thicken the broth I used a tbsp of corn starch and let it simmer for 10 min (instead of leaving the bean liquid in as others suggested).  Fifth, I used roasted Hatch green chile instead of canned.  In the end, I thought it turned out great. :)  Had a little bit of a New Mexican flavor to it with the shredded chicken and Hatch chile.

Even as this was cooking,  the aroma told me I was going to love this stew. The only thing I did different was use fresh cilantro instead of dried, because it was cheaper. Loving every bite!!

Initially this was a watery unflavorful skillet of bland chicken, broth, & beans even though I used fresh cilantro, fresh oregano, plus banana & cubelle peppers from our garden.  Intuition told me to add a can of creamed white corn, 1 cup of frozen yellow corn, 1 t. of chili powder, 1/2 t. of chinese 5 spice, garlic powder, black & white pepper. and lots of salt.  THEN it was awesome! Poured it a bowl over roasted butternut squash. Great early autumn dish

This recipe is a good base recipe, but it needs work.  I doubled the spices and still found it bland. The only thing that I could taste was the cayenne pepper and the cumin.The liquid was too thin and did not have the chili thickness. I added salt and fresh cilantro to it as well as lime. I was surprised by the raving reviews - it goes to show that people have different taste buds. I will not be repeating this recipe again because even with the additions, it was still only mediocre.

My family and friends enjoyed this recipe. It was perfect for the first rainy day in the PNW. I loved that it took 10 minutes to prepare and then when I returned home from work it was ready to serve. We added a dollop of sour cream, cilantro, and cheese to the top. Another great meal #AroundTheTable

I made this recipe as, except I didn't drain and rinse the beans.  Super yummy and easy!  The next time I made it I substituted 20 oz. lean ground turkey for the chicken and that was yummy also.

I used chicken stock instead of broth because that's what I had on hand, skipped the green onions and added extra cheese and cayenne.  Was delicious and easy for a single guy to make!  Will definitely be a common thing in my kitchen from now on.

I'm not the type of person who writes reviews on things, but I just had to let you guys know how wonderful this is! There's not much liquid to it, and it's a pretty chunky chili. Further, the liquid it does have is not very thick like a normal chili, but the flavor is so, so good!

This is a really good chili. I used black beans instead of the white, and added a little bit of corn. It is very flavorful since I used the spicy green chiles and garlic salt to season. I also added a little bit of can tomatoes with bell peppers. Excellent dish that was very easy to make and healthy too. You can eat it with cheese on top, avocado, corn chips or maybe a dash of sour cream.

So this recipes is absolutely awesome.  I gave it 5 stars being that I did add some things.  I added ground chicken as well as the cubed breast for texture variations.  I also added a small can of salsa verde to it and sauteed my chicken in southwest seasoning.  I topped it w/ shredded pepper jack...mmmmm good!

Great easy recipe for a meal that can simmer while you do other things.  The kids all loved it.

To make things easier, I used one box of chicken stock (no measuring) and used a large jar of northern beans because that is what we had in the pantry - still turned out great.  We topped with cheese, tortilla chips and sour cream.

This is a fantastic base recipe that can be adapted for numerous variations. I tend to double the spices, mash this slightly, and then use it for tortilla filling. It's so much lighter than the traditional beef/cheese fillings. Yum!

I used half the chicken, doubled the beans, and added 1/2 tsp. salt.  Like others, I used fresh garlic (3 cloves) and cilantro in place of the dried. Definately more of a soup than a chili, but tasty nonetheless.

loved it! i paired it with the grandmother's buttermilk cornbread. I wanted to take a picture to post, but it was long gone before I had the chance. it was so delicious and a perfect combination. I added canned corn to both the bread and the chili which was needed (I think). As others have mentioned, the chili was a little bland, but it was nothing a few shakes of tapatillo couldn't fix! i also used fresh cilantro instead of dried. definitely enhanced the flavor! I topped it with a chedar monterey cheese mis, sour cream and chives. This will definitely be made again, hopefully soon. the words "epic meal" were actually muttered between huge bites by my boyfriend. hats off to you Dierdre! thank you for the recipe!!!

This recipe is almost exactly like one I make.  I use only 1 cup of broth, and don't drain the beans.  This makes it a bit thicker.  You can also use 1lb of ground chicken instead of chicken breast.  I put white rice on the bottom of the bowl before pouring in the chili, which also thickens it.  Eat with Tostitos scoops!

I thought this was a great recipe.  I did change a couple of things, but stuck pretty close to the origional recipe.  I used 2 cans of cooked chicken instead of the chicken breasts.  I used half the can of green chilis, and chili powder instead of cayenne (I didn't want to make it too spicy for my daughter on the first try).  Other than that I stuck to the recipe (oh and I also used two cans of beans instead of one) and it turned out great.  I like a recipe that can be toned down for kids or revved up for adults.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

This was a great recipe, I made the few recommended changes.  I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic vs. the powdered.  I added a palm full of chili powder.  I used fresh cilantro vs. the dried and I took a second can of the cannellini beans and puree'd them in a blender with some chicken stock to thicken the chili.  This was a fantastic recipe that I will be making many many times.  Thank you.

Very good flavor.  More like a soup than a chili.  Next time, will cut chicken smaller or shred.   Will take another can of beans and puree them and use less broth.

This was a yummy, quick and easy lunch for 4 people. I used 1 can canellini beans, and 1 can navy beans. I blended the canellini beans and used as a thickener.

I used 1 lb ground chicken and 1 lb ground turkey, becuase that is what I had.  I also added an extra can of beans, 2 cloves of garlic and 3 t of flour to thicken.  It was great and very easy.  Will do over and over.

I rate this recipe only a 3 stars as written because it would be extremely bland with just the amount of seasoning listed.  I doubled the seasoning in addition to adding a minced glove of garlic.  The end result was flavorful but for those with a spicy pallet I think you would be disappointed with the amount of 'heat'. Also I only added 1 cup of broth instead of 1 1/4 to make it less soupy.

This recipe is wonderful!  I didn't have all the spices so I used some taco seasoning (since it contained most of the spices) and added oregano as well.  The cheese and green onions top it off perfectly.  Will most certainly make this again!

I thought this was really good. it's not quite a five-star recipe in my book, but one that is worth trying.  Everyone else liked it more than I did, including my picky twin 8 year olds and 6 year old.  Per suggestions, I made the following changes: omitted cayenne pepper because of the kids and added 1T chili powder, 1T lime juice, 2 cans of beans and 1 can of beans ground into paste for a thickener.  For toppings, I had sour cream, bacon, Fritos, shredded cheese and green onions. I saw someone had avocado slices in their picture of the dish and I bet that would be tasty too!  Good dish for a cold winter's day.  Thanks, Dierdre!

Excellent alternative to traditional chili. Using pre-cooked chicken breasts would have been a big time saver and I would consider this next time. I followed the recipe except for doubling the amount of beans, rinsing them, and then pureeing half in order to help thicken the sauce. I also omitted the green chiles and added about 1/8-1/4 tsp chili powder. Otherwise, all spices were added as the recipe called for. I made cornbread muffins to serve along with it. Delish!

What a yummy twist on chili.  My whole family loved it.  I was so excited that I had everything on hand except the beans which my hubby went and got ( : Nice hubby.  I made exactly as prescribed except I went a little heavy on the spices.  Delish! 5 Stars for you Dierdre Dee!!

I added a green bell pepper, I cooked the chicken with 2 cloves of garlic, I used 3 cans white beans, and 3 cups of broth.  I thought there was too much chicken, so maybe 3 breasts or add even more broth and beans to equal it out.

This was a very good mild white chicken chili.  We prefer our chili pretty spicy but this was awesome for when we had guests.  I wasn't able to find cannellini beans so I just used white beans.  Very good!

Like everyone else, I made a few adjustments.  I used 2 chicken breasts (but only because that's all I had, but I think it did make the seasonings a little more intense), added in canned tomatoes, and used seasoning salt while I cooked the chicken.  I let the mixture cook longer than suggested so that the seasonings would be more concentrated and there would be less liquid.  DO NOT DRAIN THE BEANS!!  I also added a little bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce.  Be generous with the cheese, use sour cream, and green onion.  AMAZING!!  You won't be disappointed!

I left out the cilatro and oregano. I added 1/2Cup Chopped Celery, the juice of 1/2 a lime and doubled the cumin... Also threw in a few dashes of hot chili oil...and garnished with some tortilla chips...I did drain the beans but, ued only a Cup of chicken broth...sautee the celery with the onion and chicken first...I also threw a little salt and pepper on the chicken as it was cooking...really tasted great - I like more of a kick so, i personally amped it up with more cayenne but, not nessecary if you don't like that much heat...

I am on the Abs Diet for Women and this recipe has three powerfoods - olive oil, beans, and lean meats.  This was fantastic too!  Quick to make and delicious!  I left off the cheese to cut calories and fat but it was still great!

Make it Vegetarian!  Thank you very much to this start to my vegetarian version,which turned out to be absolutely delicious.Start with one package chicken-style seitan,   cut into small cubes and brown with the onions.  For stock, use 1.5 cups un-chicken stock of vegetable stock.  2 tablespoons of nutritional yeast for thickening.  Added one can garbanzo beans (not enough beans with one can of cannelli).  I like my food spicier, so I doubled the oregano, added slightly more cayenne pepper and added a teaspoon of coriander.

This is a great recipe.    Nothing beats this chili and some corn bread on a cold winter evening.     

Maybe it is my imagination but it seems like it taste even better when you warm it up the second night.

Very good.  I would add more cayenne, crushed chili peppers or your favorite hot sauce.  Also, I would serve with balsamic vinegar -- adds some nice balance and will help for those who find this just a tad bland.

This was a little more like soup than chili, but still tasty nonetheless. I reduced the chicken by half and added a can of red beans (wanted more protein and less meat. I guess that makes it red and white chili). I also used cheddar cheese on top instead of the Monterey Jack. Thanks for the great recipe, I'll definitely be making this again!

I would have given this recipe 3 1/2 stars if it was an option.  But, in all fairness, I didn't have green chilies or cilantro, so that might have bumped it up to a true 4 or 5.  What I ended up with was a very good base. But it was a soup that I ended up standing over shaking a variety of different spices and beans into to make it taste like I wanted.  Which doesn't make this a bad recipe.  It was a lazy Saturday and standing in front of a hot pot of chili experimenting with spices was a perfect way to spend some time.  I topped it with sour cream, shredded cheese, and chopped green onions and it was delicious!

Although my kids complained a bit about the spiciness of this dish (which is definitely more of a soup), the family liked it overall.  My husband did wish it were thicker.  I think I read a tip about mashing some additional beans to thicken the "chili," so I will try that next time.  I used pre-cooked, packaged chicken shortcuts and fresh cilantro.  Also, I tried substituting 1/2 t. garlic salt for the garlic powder, but that was a mistake -- WAY too salty.  I will just used minced garlic next time or break down and buy garlic powder.

My boyfriend is not a fan of traditional red-sauce chili - in fact, before I made this recipe he hadn't had ANY kind of chili in years!  We both found this to be divine.  I'm a pretty novice cook, so if you're just trying out your culinary skills, this is a pretty easy recipe to follow.  I stuck to the exact recipe on the site, and it came out perfectly.

I love this recipe and have been making it for a few years now.  The only changes I make is to thicken the broth with a mixture of half and half and a little flour.  I simmer it to cook out the flour taste and the dish ends up super creamy and tasty!  I think next time I'm going to try adding another can of pureed beans as other reviewers suggested.  Excellent starting recipe.

A friend of mine from work made this white chili for a potluck & it was so good. Although, I lost the recipe she gave me. I found this recipe & it turned out better than what my coworker made. I revised it, instead of browning onion in pan I added minced onion. Was super easy to make. I boiled my chicken (4 chicken breasts) I had an extra breast leftover & turned that into my salad the following day. The chili lasted only 24 hours in my house. Next time I will double the cans of white northern beans. A "must do" recipe.  :)

Much better the next day!  I would've rated this a 3 on Day 1 as the flavors and textures didn't seem to really come together... perhaps I should've let it simmer on the stove for an hour (after adding the beans) instead of 20 min as I did last night.  Like others, I doubled the spices and used fresh cilantro and garlic.  I added one diced green bell pepper with the chicken and onions to up the veggie count of this dish -- I thought it was a great addition in terms of variation and color.

The overall flavor was pretty good.  although I made this dish for 2 people and it turns out this is not something I would eat leftovers of.
***doubled the green chili's and beans...now it rocks!

It was pretty good.  I would probably make again, especially on a cold night.  I think I'll try adding lime juice as recommended by another.

Ok, I give this recipe only 4 because I had to tweak it to make it more chili-like which turned it into a 5 star.  I didn't have cilantro so I didn't use that.  I added an extra can of beans, mashed to thicken it up.  I also added like 4oz of Mont/Jack/Colby Cheese and 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I really liked it, good seasoning.

This recipe had more of a kick than I expected, but I liked it. I did use more of each seasoning, and added fresh garlic. Was surprisingly flavorful, and healthy too!  Will make again!

My family has never ever had white chili and wasn't sure if they would eat it.  Made a very small pot the first time and it was gone fast! A+++ recipe.  I have made it several times since for my daughters home warming party and for dinner!  This recipe is a five star no doubt!

This was really easy and really yummy!  The only complaint was that it didn't make enough for a big group like I thought it would, I doubled the recipe and it was perfect.

Very good recipe.  It came together very quickly and I was very happy with the results.  I will probably add a thickener next time I make it, as it was kind of soupy.  Definitely a keeper!!

Yep, this one's darn near the best white chili I ever had.  Good, easy, healthy.  I had fresh cilantro and garlic on hand to use and topped it off with some grated cheese and a dab of sour cream.  Corn bread on the side. Yum!

MY HUSBAND REALLY LIKED THIS. I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXCEPT WE ARE NOT BIG ONION FANS AND I DO NOT LIKE OREGANO, SO THOSE WERE LEFT OUT.  I USED LEFT OVER CHICKEN AND A CAN OF PINTO BEANS. THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO GET IN THE FIBER AND USE LEFT OVER CHICKEN. IT WAS NOT TOO SPICY AND I AM WHIMPY.

Perfect and hearty for a cold night! Also super easy and quick to make. I didn't have any cayenne so I used Emeril's Southwest Essence. I also chopped up an avocado and added it in with the beans. YUM!

This was my first attempt at white chili.  The only change I made was to sub ground turkey for the chicken.  The chili was ok, but nothing exciting.  I will keep looking for a good white chili recipe.

WOW!  We always have chili on Halloween, so we can come back from trick or treating to a hot meal.  This chili rocks!  My husband said he would prefer this to a tomato based chili any day and my non-spice loving son agreed.

I tend to change things up just a bit, usually because I'm lacking an ingredient or two! This is a tad spicy for me, my husband loves the spice. I doubled everything and added 2 cans of blendered cannellini beans and used both chicken and vegetable broth to thin spiciness and thicken consistency. Very good. We are having leftovers tomorrow!

We really enjoyed it and it was super easy. I added a can of diced pimentos and I used Great Northern Beans. The pimentos gave it some nice color contrast. Pureeing a can of beans was a good idea. I did that as well.

This was fabulous! I was looking for something easy that I could throw together with ingredients I already had on hand - this was perfect. I used leftover chicken, doubled the recipe, and added a little extra chicken broth; and I threw in a chopped up green pepper, which added a nice flavor. This will definitely be added to my recipe rotation!

I liked this very much.  I doubled the cayanne which made it too spicy for my wife but just about right for me.  Will make again, but a little milder so that whole family can enjoy.  Corn bread is perfect with it.

My Texan husband really enjoyed this with sour cream and tomatillo salsa. And he's finicky about anything that's remotely Mexican! I also used pickled jalepenos instead of the chilies [just so I didn't have to go the grocery.] We loved it!

Good Recipe.  I like food with a bite, so I added much more cayenne.

This is a great alternative to traditional chili!  I added a tablespoon of flour (whisked into 1/4 cup of water) at the end of the cooking time, then brought it to a boil to thicken the broth slightly.

This was okay, not as good as I had hoped for.  I did use my own dried mix of beans instead of canned white beans.  Maybe this was the problem.

This is a GREAT recipe!  Easy and quick!  Next time I will make it in the slow cooker by dumping everything in at the same time and slow cooking it all day.  I didn't have any green chilies OR cilantro, but I had some dried Habanero peppers and I added one chopped up for some bite!  Was afraid it would be too hot but it made it just right!

This is the best white chili EVER!!!  It was delicious.  I left out the corn to adapt to a low carb diet and it tasted fantastic.  This a keeper.  I will be making this often.  Thanks!

Very delicious!  I didn't use the dried cilantro and didn't have any cayenne, so I just added a little more cumin and a couple flecks of red pepper flakes.  Very quick and easy!

I used great northern beans which I drained a little, but did not rinse.  I omitted the cilantro, since I don't care for the flavor.  I added about 10-12 drops of Tobasco and about 10 seeded and chopped jalapeno slices (jarred, not fresh).  It wasn't too spicy when served with rice, but I would use a few less slices if I was going to serve it alone.  I used almost twice the chicken broth, but I added about 2 1/2-3 Tbsp. of corn starch to it, to slightly thicken. I would use less broth if serving without rice.  I used a small onion, and I decided that I would use a larger one next time.  Don't skimp on the cheese.  It really completes it.  Delicious!

The chili is delicious, very light and healthy but with lots of flavor. I was short on time so I shortened the simmering times a bit but everything was still wonderful. The only thing I will change is to double the portion. The recipe feeds 4 not-too-hungry people.

I was worried that my husband may not like this, but he loved it! I gave the recipe to a friend and she makes it all the time. I went to her house for dinner when she made it and my husband asked if I brought any leftovers home. This is a great easy quick dinner, I make it often, thanks.

Very good.  Used 5 cans of beans (2 cans small white beans and 3 cans great northern)  Probably would reduce amount of chicken broth.  Used one whole can of jalapenos....made very spicy but very good!  Sour cream on top was great..also sprinkled with cornbread.  Will make again!  Very easy!

This is a nice chicken soup.  I would add another can of beans next time because they are so good in the soup.  If I were splurging, I'd finish off the soup with some whipping cream or half and half.  YUM!

This is an incredible recipe. We love this with corn muffins.  I have been making this for a couple of years and one of my personal favorites. I cut it out of a coupon flyer, lost it, and have been winging it since then.  Thank goodness for the internet!

We loved this white chili!! It had a wonderful flavor and I served it with sour cream dolloped on top. I did improvise some.....didn't have the correct beans, so I used another white bean, and I didn't have the cheese it called for so I added what I had. I also doubled the chicken broth and let it cook an hour or so. YUMMY! AAA+    I would recommend it to anyone. Thanks!!

This was a really great chili. It was a nice change from 'ordinary' and the expected. I enjoyed tenderness of the chicken; the white beans made this great! This chili has great texture too. It's just a great recipe - many thanks to EKWilliams for making it for our Thursday night 'Must See TV' get-together!

Oh yeah - that EKWilliams.  What an amazing cook!  Her rendition of this white chili recipe was, as my mother would say, 'out of this world!'  She threw this dish together in mere minutes, and it was the highlight of the evening!  Mmmmm...

This was very good.  I added 1/2 cup more of chicken broth and used more green onions.  I also toped it with a little fresh cilantro and served it with tortilla chips (for dipping), it was wonderful!
