Amazing! garlicky, cheesy, spinachy (is that a word?) all wrapped in a great knob of decadent warm wonderful tomato goodness. Try these in place of that scary frozen block of green beans you have shoved in the back of your freezer. I used fresh spinach and followed the directions just the same. I paired this up with another newer offering here on allrecipes.com, Joanne's Jalapeno Chicken. A night of comfort food awaits you with this dynamic  duo.

it's a fairly good and colorful nice appetizer, found the prep and cooking time to be closer to 25-30 minutes total making it something that can be put together pretty quickly in a pinch to accompany a chicken dish

No disrespect to the poster but I subbed polenta because I didn't have the mix.  They were amazing!   One cup polenta (uncooked) yields enough stuffing to double the recipe or freeze for later

this is like a tomato topped with a spinach ball...great idea!  I used herbed stuffing crumbs, as I do in my spinach ball recipe, and used less butter. The only problem I had ... They got dried out on top when I broiled them, maybe because I cut butter back to 1/4 cup. So I just brushed some butter on top and they were fine. Would not recommend as an appetizer. You need a fork and a knife.

A little to vegatably for me.  Needs more cheese or cream or something and make sure to not eat this with another onion heavy food.
