Ok, I did this a lot differently.  First of all, you should probably add more pasta if you don't want too much of the sauce.  I omitted the mustard.  I added 1 cup colby and 1/1/2 cup mozzarella and then salt, pepper and italian seasonings.  Oh ya, and peas.  Was a great dish, will definately make again.  This is a good recipe to keep around just for the fact that you can do so much with it(use it as a base).  Maybe add chicken or turkey and/or french cut green beans next time.  Maybe top it off with some sliced cherry tomatoes.

We had a big ham for Christmas with lots of leftovers to use up.  This recipe had all the ingredients that my family loves, ham, cheese, noodles, garlic, I mean what’s not to like?  And the added bonus was that I had all the ingredients on hand.  Which meant no trip needed to the grocery store!  Gotta love that!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out really yummy!  Cheesy, gooey, and warm on a cold, stormy, winter night!  Served with a big green salad.  Will serve with some rolls next time too.   My husband’s only complaint was that it was a tad salty.  So the next time I make this I won’t add salt to the pasta water when I cook the noodles, and I won’t be adding any salt to the recipe.  The Parmesan cheese and ham provide more than enough salt for this dish.  One added bonus about this recipe is that while the noodles are cooking you can make up the sauce and slice the ham; then while the dish is baking in the oven you have just enough time to clean up the dirty pan from the sauce, tidy up the kitchen, set the table and toss the salad; then after dinner there’s only the casserole dish, the dinner plates and utensils to wash up!  Nice!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  We’ll be making this one again!

I was looking for an easy recipe to use up some leftover ham and came across this one...glad I did!  The whole family (3 kids) enjoyed it and wanted seconds...and THAT doesn't happen often!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using whole wheat pasta, dijon instead of reg. mustard, and a colby/jack blend of cheese.  Next time, I'll be doubling the recipe. We'll be making this often.

I used dijon mustard and added a tablespoon of dillweed. Substituted the colby cheese (too mild for my tastes) with a mix of cheeses: 1 cup Extra Sharp orange cheddar, 3/4 cup monterey jack, and 3/4 cup mozerella. Topped with a mix of bread crumbs and parmesan.

Everyone liked this recipe, and in our house, that's saying something!  I left the prepared mustard out, and when we reheat (I double the recipe so we have leftovers), I add milk to make the sauce creamy again.

Excellent recipe. My whole family loved it. It cooked up perfectly (just make sure you follow the instructions carefully to insure your white sauce turns out properly). I added some grated cheddar and bread crumbs to the parmesan topping and I included a little sharp cheddar and cayenne to the casserole to spice it up a bit. Yummy!

A very good recipe and this is a mild cheese flavored sauce.  Use some cheddar if you want to zip it up.

My husband and I really liked this. I used 1 1/2 cup mozzarella and a cup of an Italian cheese blend in place of the colby. I used 12 oz of elbow pasta and added peas and a dash of cayenne pepper. Will make again.

Spectacular dish! I added a sprig (not a leaf but a whole sprig) of fresh, minced basil and about a tablespoon of Italian Seasoning.  It was wonderful!  I also took the suggestion of one of the raters and used a cup of colby and a cup and a half of mozzerella for the sauce.  It was so yummy!

This was delicious!  I needed to use up some leftover ham and this was the perfect recipe.  I used 16 ounces of pasta rather than just 8 and there was plenty of sauce to spare.

This was a great recipe, easy to make and called for things I always have on hand. I've made it a couple times and done some different things each time. We like it with a combination of cheeses (tonight I used Havarti, cheddar, and muster) so I use whatever cheeses I have. I also add some chopped onion with the garlic, and fresh red bell pepper if I have it. My kids loved it when I added peas (it looked pretty with the red pepper and green peas). And I at least double the ham, even more if I have enough. This is a really great, flexible recipe!

What a great, basic mac and cheese recipe.  Very easy.  We omitted the ham, used cheddar instead of colby, and added diced cauliflower and peas.  I also sauteed some panko in butter to give it a crunchy topping.  Very easy and very good.

My family liked this.  It was a little too thick/rich for me.  I added peas to this.  Next time I will add more milk to thin it out a little.

This was great... my family enjoyed it! I took the advice of not adding salt to the pasta water and I didn't put as much salt in as the receipe called for. VERY GOOD! I didn't put peas IN with the pasta, but we had it on the side, definitely a good side dish to have with it. I also added the italian seasonings and put breadcrumbs with the parm ontop. Definitely a keeper:)  Also, I only boiled the pasta for about 6-7 minutes. I didn't want it to get floppy/soggy while baking it. It turned out really great, I am sharing this recipe with all who want it!

This was pretty good, the fam. went back for 3rds!  I like to bake a ham to have handy for quick, economical meals and sandwich meat.  I used what I had for cheese; 2 c. Jack, 4 oz cream cheese.  I also added shredded parmesean to the sauce for extra bite, and used 1 c. milk and 1 c. heavy cream for richness.  I used 16 oz of pasta like others and it was perfect.  I added peas and they were my favorite part! I'll add more next time.  A trick to keeping white sauces like these from being bland is to be sure to cook your flour long enough.  Treat it almost like a roux and stir constantly over med low heat for about 10-13 min and your flavor will then have depth. (be sure to add your garlic AFTER the flour is almost cooked or you will have burnt, bitter garlic).  I also added crushed ritz to the parmesean for the topping, yum!

This was fantastic.  I made it with leftover ham and rotini pasta because it's what I had.  Probably used 10-12 oz of pasta and it was just right.  I also added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of frozen peas and a dash of tabasco too. Lastly I topped it with the parm and italian seasoned bread crumbs.  It was a hit in my house!

I changed it a little bit: I used penne instead of bows and used like 16 onz because it is a lot of sauce. I put peas and a lot more christmas ham because I love it. I used mozzarella cheese and gouda cheese because those where the ones I had, top with parmesan, I added a little more milk to the sauce because I thought it was too thick but nevertheless it dried more in the oven so be aware of that, overall VERY GOOD.

We loved this!! Had some leftover ham from Christmas.. I prety much followed the recipe with the exception of sauting some onion in the butter before adding the garlic. oh, and my son was scooping his with Chicken In a Biscuit Crackers so I crushed some of those up and it tasted even better with that as a topping.  Yum! Will make again.

Love homemade pasta and cheese with no processed cheese product!  I tried this recipe as written and it was fantastic!  On my second baking, I made it mine by adding a 1/2 cup of mild cheddar and used 4 oz of leftover spiral cut honey ham, fresh Parmesan and of course, a handful of breadcrumbs on the top.  Magnifico!  Five stars.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent comfort food.  Only made a few minor changes : used cayenne instead of black pepper, used cheddar (that's what we had), added conflake crumbs with the Parm on top, garlic powder (no fresh on hand) & onion powder.  Also, I added a bit too much flour so my sauce was too thick, used a bit of chicken broth to thin it.  Easy & fast.  Thanks!

I made this last night & my family gobbled it up & my boys had the leftovers for breakfast this morning.  :) I didn't have bowties so I used the small seashell pasta.I'm not really sure how one "julienne's" ham so I just chopped mine into bite-sized pieces. I skipped all of the sauce making & instead, I used a can of undiluted cheese soup (I bet cheez-whiz would work, too, or melted velveeta).  Added salt, pepper, garlic powder & stirred it all together, poured it into a baking pan, covered it with garlic bread crumbs & shredded cheddar.I was going to also add peas to it but I forgot so I just served them on the side.  But this morning for breakfast, the boys stirred the leftover peas into the casserole, anyway.  This is a keeper.

This was pretty good.  I would strongly recommend that if you are going to use the whole box of pasta that you make more sauce.  Some reviewers didn't feel it needed it, but if you like your sauce more "saucy" then you're going to wish you had.  If you're going to use just the 8 oz, then you will be fine.  
All in all, pretty good though.  I followed the directions with the exception of using a cheddar/colby blend and more noodles.  I'll make this again.

my kids LOVED this recipe.  I'm not a large fan of ham or cheese, but even i have to admit this was fairly good.  I did change a couple of things.  I used marble cheese instead of colby as that is what i had on hand, i added extra ham and more pasta.  I actually ended up almost doubling the whole recipe to feed everyone.  Instead of just the grated parmesan on top, i melted 2 tbsp of butter, added about 2 cups of coarse bread crumbs, 1 cup shredded marble and 1/2 cup parmesan and spread it over the top to bake.  It gave it a nice crunchy topping that my kids were fighting over.  My very picky kids loved this so much, they even ate it as leftovers (a rarity in my home), so this is a definite keeper and a 5 stars from me!  Thank you for sharing!

Kids loved this!! I doubled this recipe because my 14 year old had a friend over and there were no left overs! I only had a cheddar cheese and jack cheese blend on hand, but it tasted great!

Very good use for leftover baked ham!  I made quite a few changes to fit our likes: more pasta, added peas and more liquid, used lowfat (not notfat cheese).  I used a colby, cheddar. mozzerella mix as that is what I had on hand, and used 1/4 tsp. dry mustard instead of prepared.

Tasted very similar to home-made macaroni and cheese with ham. Very yummy. 
I also cut the pasta to the amount our family normally eats.

This was delicious - I used Campanella shaped pasta which I really love the way it cooks up. I bought  a 5 oz. piece of nice lean ham at the deli to dice. I topped the dish with fresh shaved parmesan which baked up lightly crusty and golden on top - my sweetheart loved this so it goes in with the "Keepers"!

Yummy recipe! They only things I changed were instead of only Colby cheese I used a combination of Colby, sharp cheddar, and provolone cheese mixture. I also added some chopped onion in addition to the garlic. I served this on a bed of spinach along with some sauteed carrots and green beans.

My husband and I really liked this.  I hate reviewing after i've made modifications, but it turns out I didn't have all of the ingredients in the house like I thought I did.  Instead of colby, I used a Kraft blend of 3 cheddar cheeses (it comes in a bag).  I omitted the mustard and used smoked sausage instead of ham.  It was really easy to make and very, very good.  Next time I'll use the colby and follow the recipe exactly.

Sauce easily accommodates a full 16 oz of pasta. I used a mix of cheeses (a taco blend). I topped with a handful of crouton crumbs. Other than that, this recipe is a keeper.

Very flavorful - I chose to do an elbow macaroni and a mix of Colby Jack and Sharp Cheddar - and successfully substituted regular mustard (no dry on hand).    I cubed up some leftover Boar's Head ham to mix in, and on top used crushed garlic croutons.  Delicious!

I made this recipe using rotini pasta and cheddar cheese.  I used about 6 oz of ham.  It was very cheesey (which I like), but it was missing something.  My son added bacon bits to his bowl.  I think I will try that next time.  It was good and easy to make.

Perfect as is.  I did add frozen peas as we just happen to love them.  Previous reviews said it freezes well also - love to know that! Would be a great food gift for a friend or great potluck dish. Reheats well.

Super easy and yummy. I typically mess up a mac n cheese. Not sure what was different about this one. I added frozen mixed veggies to the pasta at the end of boiling to make it a better balanced meal. Also, not a big deal, but I used penne instead of bowties since that's what I had on hand. 2 year old loved it! p.s. I used non-fat milk...Suprisingly worked like a charm.

Very good!! The colby cheese gives it a smoother taste than cheddar. In this way it was easy to have it as the main course and didn't feel like we were just eating mac and cheese. I used smoked ham. It combined perfectly with the cheese. Followed the recipe exactly and highly recommend.

If you don't already have ham- just go to the deli and ask for one to two slices of the thickest cut they can do.  Julienne it and its ready to go.  Used a mixture of Cheddar/Jack and Mozzarella in the sauce.  Added some bread crumbs to the top. Pretty yummy.

This was excellent! Even my 4 yr old gobbled it all down. I did make a few changes. Per others' suggestions, I increased the milk and that made it more creamy. I used Colby jack cheese and added frozen broccoli to the mixture as well. Used Romano instead of Parmesan cheese (since that is what I had).  I never noticed the dish to be "garlicky" so I think that the amount called for was just the right amount. Definitely a keeper!

Very good.  I made some changes suggested by others - used dijon mustard and a little more pasta.  I don't recommend leaving out the mustard like some had.  Even if you don't care too much for mustard, it really adds a nice flavor that isn't too strong.  I had cheddar and mozz cheese on hand so used that.  My only grips are the sauce isn't as creamy as I would like and it's pretty fattening.  Next time I will try some different cheeses and maybe a little less flour.  Also, broccoli or peas would be a great addition like others suggest.  But in all, a great recipe.  My family loved it, it was fast and easy to make and I almost always have all the ingredients on hand.  Will make this again (on occasion because of the fat & calories) as a fast, middle of the week meal with a salad and good crusty bread.

I used Fiori pasta instead (honeycomb shaped) which allowed the cheese to hold better.   It is a rich sauce so I added a little more pasta.  I also would mention to add the milk while adding the flour.   It was loved in my household!

This was a super easy recipe for leftover ham and you can basically add anything you like to it. I skipped the garlic and added onion instead. I also added a mixture of cheeses like velveeta, swiss, and sharp instead of using the colby and parmesean. It came out very creamy and my kids loved it, not to mention the husband too..  :)

This came out exceptionally well. I made this last night for my parents, sister, and grandmother and they all loved it. I got rewarded by being selected to cook meals for the fam more often. Only 3 slight changes.
1) Add frozen peas
2) Cube the ham instead of jullienning it
and 3) use chedar cheese instead of colby

I tweeked it abit.  I added green peppers, tomatoes, and onion to the garlic.  Instead of using ham I chopped up some summer sausage and added it to the cheese mixture while I was waiting for my macaroni to cook.  I also finly crumbed uop about 10 Ritz crackers and added it to the parmesan cheese then baked it like normal.  Everyone loved it.  I will be adding this to our routine in meals.

This casserole was DELISH! I made it exactly like you said to and it turned out wonderful. The flavors were perfect. My fiance and I will be having it again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Good basic recipe, I doubled so we would have leftovers. Personally, I like my cheese with a little more zip, so I would go for sharp or extra sharp and maybe a little more mustard.

This is yummy!! My kids loved it, as did I. I added a little more ham, a whole 12 oz. packed of pre-chopped ham. And I browned the ham in a frying pan before putting in the casserole. Also added 1/2 of a 16 oz. bag of frozen peas to the pasta the last minute of cooking......This will be part of my dinner rotation for sure!

Very good!! Used 1/2 colby and the rest a mix of stronger cheeses.  Cheddar, italian mix and more parmesan.  I increased ingredients, some I doubled (pasta) and the meat and some I just increased 1 1/2 times.   Used very little salt. Doubling the pasta made it just enuf to fill a 13x9 pan!  After I added the parmesan on top I sprinkled on some panko bread crumbs for some crunchiness.  It was AWESOME. My mom loved it and my I-hate-pasta son even liked it!

I've made this recipe 3 times. This is a great recipe to work from...then add your own favorite cheese(s).  The white sauce is just perfect as written in the recipe. My favorite combination of cheese includes equal parts of mild cheddar, swiss and gruyere. Oh so good!!!

My kids loved it but I thought it to be a bit bland and a bit greasy even though i used cheddar.  with some tweaking, it definately has some possiblities.  There are a lot better cheese pasta recipes out there.

I've made this dish several times, and love it! Make it exactly as the recipe says, except I use the pre-cooked, cubed ham they sell in grocery stores. I usually serve this with crescent rolls and steamed vegis. Great as leftovers too!

I doubled this recipe, eliminated the mustard and substituted a mix of cheddar and mozzarella for the colby(only because it's what I had here)...and this was deeeeee-licious!  This will definitely be a favorite use for leftover ham in our family!  Thank you! :)

This was delicious and comforting. I threw in a handful of frozen baby peas and that was yummy. I also served it right away without baking it, as I find so many casseroles get dried out when you bake them. Super good!

This was a tasty dish however I doubt anyone in my family will request it again. I guess it just didn't appeal to our taste buds but it may appeal to yours so it's easy and worth a try.

Delicious!  I made this tonight for myself, my fiance and his best friend  as something hearty after a long days work, and they loved it!.  For the milk I used skim, which didn't stop it from being a thick and bubbly sauce, I used Light Becel instead of butter, and a combination of mild cheddar and monterey cheese instead of colby.  For the ham, I don't really cook many hams, so I just bought an inexpensive ham steak, cooked it up and chopped it julienne.  Wonderful! Thanks so much, its a keeper.

This was very good. Following what other reviewers said, I added a couple dashes of cayenne and used more pasta and ham than the recipe calls for (I also used tri-color bowtie pasta). We don't have Colby cheese here (in Spain), so I used half mozzarella, and the other half was a packaged blend of mozzarella/blue/Swiss/Gouda/cheddar. Will definitely make this again (I'd give it four and a half stars).

My kids loved it, and really that's all that mattered, but for some reason it had a sweet taste to it, and my husband and I didn't care for that. Not sure what made it sweet, if someone could tell me, I will gladly make it again and try it. Made it like the recipe said, but omitted the mustard.

I didn't use bow-ties, and I used different cheese, monterey jack. and I used probably close to a pound of ham..

This is a really good recipe, thanks!  I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for a ton of ingredients and this one is really good.  Good enough to give a 1st review!

This was good, but I agree w/ others that said it was a little bland. It just seemed to be missing something, but not sure what. I also wish that I would've went w/ my instincts and used velveeta, because while the colby melted fine, it had a grainy texture/flavor that I didn't really care for. I used a 12oz. bag of egg noodles and that worked well. Topped it w/ both parmesan and seasoned breadcrumbs before baking. The concept was great to use up the last of the leftover ham, but I think I will play with this more to suit it to our tastes. Thanks for sharing. :)

I followed the recipe except for doubling all ingredients.   We were not fans of the sauce and felt it needed more flavor, and tasted like flour.  Not sure if I did something wrong or if it's just not our "cup of tea", but I do appreciate you sharing your recipe with me and my family.  Thank you.

This is a family favorite. SO easy and SO delicious! I usually use sharp cheddar because I always have it on hand -- same with the cubed ham. The only addition I've made is I brown panko bread crumbs & some parmesan cheese together until they are golden brown & sprinkle over the top before putting into the oven. My 4-yr-old calls them "crispy crumbs" and that's the only way he'll eat mac & cheese. This is truly a comfort food recipe. Thank you so much!

Granted, this was just macaroni and cheese with ham, but it was pretty darn tasty!  I used a heaping teaspoon of garlic and also probably about 3 cups of cheese total (cleaning out the fridge).  Served with green beans for an easy dinner.

This was very, very good.  Even my husband, who doesn't like ham, liked this. I did, however, tweak it a little. I added onion with my garlic to caramelize them just a bit, added peas, used jalapeño jack instead of colby, and omitted the mustard.  We both were sneaking bites out of the pan before dinner!  Thank you Stephndon for giving me a wonderful way to use up my easter ham!

This recipe was sooo easy.  My family ate it up!!  The only change I made was, I used spicy brown mustard instead of the prepared.  I think the cheese sauce was lovely!  Very creamy and with perfect taste!  I will definitely be making this again and again!

This was good. I used cheddar cheese instead of Colby and garlic powder instead of a clove. Also I topped with mixed parm cheese and bread crumbs.

I felt this was very bland.  It could have been my fault though.  I had no Colby cheese so I used Co-Jack and Co-Cheddar.  I used 1-1/2 cloves of garlic and also added some onion powder and added more milk than the recipe called for as I felt it was too thick.  I won't blame the recipe but the cook because of my substituted ingredients.  I took it to a party and others felt is was good.  The recipe yields quite a bit.

This was EXCELLENT!! One of the best, simple pasta dishes I have made from this site. I used Cheddar cheese instead of Colby and it was like a rich, creamy mac n' cheese!

Very good, though I added some finely minced onion (sauteed with the butter & garlic) as well as some fresh chopped parsley for color.  Great way to use leftover ham and the kids loved it!

YUM! I actually doubled this recipe because....we'll.....we like macaroni and cheese. Super simple. I used a mixture of different pasta I had in boxes/packages in my pantry and threw in the last ends of cheese I had along with the Colby, like a little sharp cheddar and a little mozzerella. I was running low on milk so I used one can of evaporated milk. I did take Nuggets suggestion and added about a tsp. of onion powder. Really, really good. Just what we needed on a stormy day outside. I served this with a green salad and leftover BBQ chicken. NOM! NOTE: This whole recipe, doubled, didn't cost me more than five dollars. All my pasta, cheese and even the ham was all bought at Grocery Outlet for a buck a piece. I'm really thrilled.

I'm giving this five stars only because I haven't had a chance to try it exactly according to the recipe. I made it last night for dinner though with what I had available, substituting turkey for ham and mexican-blend (cheddar, monterey jack, asadero, and queso quesadilla) shredded cheese for colby. It was absolutely delicious. I also did have to add some extra milk (probably about 1/4 cup or so) to the sauce as it got way too thick. But again, this was a scrumptious meal. I loved it. My fiance didn't like it as much as I did, but he's not much of a cheese fan. I will definitely be making this again, hopefully next time following the recipe exactly.

This was better than expected.  The only thing I did different was I used elbow macaroni (it is what I had) and used a Colby/Jack mix (that is all they had at the store).  I will make this again.

This was an alright recipe.  I made double the amount of pasta and I'm glad I did, there would have definitely been too much sauce.  I used a 16 oz package of cubed ham which went well with the extra pasta.  I kept everything else the same.

Can you tell that this is my reviewing day?? :] I made this for lunch the other day because I had all the ingredients on hand and my youngest adores anything that is similar to a mac and cheese. I liked this recipe alright but he really enjoyed it. I prefer a more cheesy sauce, I thought this was more alfredo-y. BUt it was very easy, and a kid pleaser, so it's a kepper!!!

So yummy!  I love the garlicky taste to the sauce.  I added some extra bowties (almost 12 oz) and topped with bread crumbs in addition to the parmesan.  Hit with the kids, too.

This was really tasty and easy to make.  I prefer it with bread crumbs along with the Parmesan cheese to top and with broccoli mixed in.  I like to either steam the broccoli or cook it in chicken broth for extra flavor.  Adding the broccoli makes it a one dish meal.

This dish was absolutely fantastic. Of course, it helped that I also have a great recipe I use for Holiday Baked Ham.  I used the leftover ham for this dish.  It made a lot, but all leftovers were eaten.

I have tried a lot of recipes from this website and this one is hands down the best! This mac and cheese is very simple and easy to make. I used regular elbow macaroni (about 3/4 of a box) and substituted a chedder/mozzarella mix for the colby. It turned out great! I will definately be making this one again!

I made this tonight and logged on to be sure to review it.  It was a big hit with our family.  I haven't had much luck in the past with homemade macaroni and cheese, but with this recipe, I've finally found a keeper.  I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I used about 1 1/4 cups of 2% milk and used half and half for the rest, only because I ran out of milk.  I couldn't find shredded colby cheese, so I used a package of shredded sharp cheddar and I also threw in a handful of an italian blend shredded cheese leftover from another recipe.  My 4 year old loves broccoli, so I threw some broccoli flowerets into the pasta water for the last two minutes of cooking time.  I also misread the directions and used 1 Tbsp of dijon mustard instead of 1 tsp., but it was just right for us.  I tried this before baking it as a casserole, and thought it was really good, but after baking, it was excellent.  It really wasn't difficult to make- this is definitely one I will make again.  I also might try substituting chicken for the ham for a change.  Thanks for the recipe!

Okay I thought I should edit my previous review, because I have tinkered with the original recipe and still do so to this day. I've added 3 cups instead of 2 and a half cups of shredded Colby Jack cheese. I also use a bit more mustard and garlic than the original, but I keep the amount of milk the same. Also, I add more than a 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese and I use about 6 to 8 oz. of ham cubes. After doing this it's even better, but the original is still good too, so I'd still give it five stars-because really it all comes down to your personal taste.

You know, this was really very good. I will for sure be making this again. Great use for leftover ham! Speaking of ham, I would add at least six ounces, instead of four, and I also used tri-colored bow-tie instead of plain.

Very good, but I had to make a couple of substitutions. I had no bowties so used Rotini instead. Also didn't have Colby so used 1/2 mozzerella and 1/2 white cheddar. Put 1/2 cup of leftover peas and carrots in to use them up. Will make again for sure!

8 ounces of pasta is not going to serve 6 people. As written this is average. But, it's a good place to start. It also needs a sharper cheese, to compliment the ham.  I have found that using equal amounts of cheddar and mozzarella make a good combination of flavor and gooeyness.  Butter really isn't needed, and neither is the flour.    I think adding peas, carrots broccoli or whatever veggies you like will add more nourishment to it, and some color too.

I have made this recipe many times, sometimes exactly following the recipe and other times changing it. I have added an extra 1/2 cup of milk and I have also made it with four different cheeses using the required amount. I have used soft cheese like havarti . I also made this with cut up roasted chicken and it was delicious.

My kids loved this and ask for it over and over. I added frozen peas to get their veggies in without a fight.

Very good!  Added a little more garlic and mustard just for our taste.  I may add some chopped broccoli next time since I love the combination of broccoli and cheese.

The base of this recipe is really good! I just added a bit more spices some herbs, some peas, double the amount of pasta, some cheddar and will definately use less flour next time. My husband and I thought it tasted to much like flour! So let see how it turns out next time with less flour! ;-)

Loved it.  I had gruyere, cheddar and a small piece of velveeta that I needed to use up.  I buttered the bread crumbs to make it extra fattening.  Comfort food at its best!

The ratios of sauce to pasta is right.  I used different cheeses (sharp cheddar and gouda), but I don't think that's the reason that I ended up not liking it.  I was just disappointed with the thickness, and lack of creaminess of the sauce.  It was too thick and somewhat sticky after it baked.  I crumbled Ritz crackers with the parmesan and some melted butter and topped the dish with that before going into the oven.  That was my fault, it was awful!  Oh, one more thing...do not add the salt!  Between the salted pasta water, the ham and the cheeses...this has too much salt!  I do not plan to make this one again.  It was a waste of good ingredients.

Very good! I'll use this method of making a roux, adding the milk and then stirring in the cheese to make the sauce from now on for Mac & Cheese. I found the ratio of ingredients perfect.  I didn't have Colby so I used a shredded cheese blend of mild cheddar and jack. Still mild. I will try all white cheddar next time. We like a little zing so I added 1 cup of finely diced sweet onion & 2 tsp cayenne pepper.  Used Dijon instead of dry.

WOW is all i can say!! I did as the other comments said and used less milk and cheese so it wouldn't be too saucy. I put a 1 1/4 cups of milk, 2 cups of cheese, and a little less of a 1/4 cup of flour and i used whole wheat flour. I didn't have colby so i used cheddar which turned out awesome anyway. I added dill weed and used Dijon like some of the comments suggested. After i boiled the pasta i let it cool and i cooked some carrots, broccoli, and, celery separately and added it to the pasta and ham before i added the sauce. Then after i added the sauce i added fresh spinach. Like i said before i used cheddar instead of Colby and topped it with freshly grated mozzarella instead since i didn't have any Parmesan. It came out BEAUTIFUL first of all.. Second it tasted very good. I was glad i added the veggies though because it is pretty rich from the cheese. Next time i'll add more seasoning though. 1/8 ts of pepper wasn't enough spice for me. The last thing i did differently was i LIGHTLY sprayed the bottom of the dish with Pam cooking spray and when i took it out it came out of the pan CLEAN. I'm thinking of adding green onion as a topper along with the cheese next time too. Overall very good! I don't like ham much and my SO doesn't either BUT we loved it in this dish.

Added more pasta, ham and a can of small peas. Left out the parm and didn't bake. Not bad for Easter ham leftovers.

This was just a little above OK. I wish I'd used cheddar cheese, Colby is too mild in a dish like this. I could not taste the mustard either and would double or triple it next time. Or use dried mustard in that amount. I think the amount of saltiness in this dish is greatly affected by the type of ham used. I used deli ham and omitted all the salt (from water and recipe) and it was a little under-salted to me. For no reason I can quite determine, this sauce was a little thicker than I wanted it to be when it came time to stir in the noodles; I would reduce the flour/butter roux to 3 and 3 next time to suit my own preferences. Thanks for sharing!

This was a huge hit and easy to freeze.  I did add some frozen broccoli to it, used whatever cheese I had in the fridge instead of all Colby, omitted the mustard & doubled the pasta. I would suggest making a little more white sauce if freezing because it was a tad dry, but oh so good!  Thanks for sharing!

This was yummy and very creamy. My family LOVES garlic, but it just didn't taste right in this dish. I will make this dish many times in the future, just leaving out the garlic. It's a quick whip-up with that comfort food filling that easily uses up your leftover ham. Thanks for sharing!

I gave this four stars for the main fact that I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  We are not big colby or mustard fans so those items were left out and we used cheddar instead of colby, but this dish really was amazing!  I have it on the menu to make again in the next two weeks.

I made this and it was pretty good, but only one of the three kids liked it (which is the reason for 3 stars). I will make it again without making it early in the day and keeping it in the fridge until dinner (made it dry with extra noodles). I added peas to it and ritz cracker crumbs for the topping.

This recipe was really tasty and popular.  I tripled the recipe and used mozzarella instead.  I did not use quite as much cheese as it called for, I thought it was cheesy enough, and wanted it a bit more "saucy."  It turned out perfect.  Even my picky 4 year old asked for seconds-and thirds.  Definitely will make again, maybe even venture to use other leftover meats!

This was so good!  I changed the servings to 8 and added additional pasta beyond the 11 oz it called for, a little more garlic, and a little less mustard (used mild dijon).  I had an 8oz package of julienne ham strips and I used the whole thing for this and it seemed like the perfect amount.  I just used whatever cheese I had on hand (colby/jack and mozzarella) and it was fabulous!  I cooked the 8 servings in an 7 x 11 pan, and it was right to the top, maybe could have even gone to a 9 x 13 pan.  Will definitely be making again!

I made this almost exactly as written.  I had a 12 oz box of bowtie pasta so I used it all.  And I threw in cheddar, mozzarella and colby cheese - tried to use the same amount as the recipe called for but split it into the 3 types of cheese.  Also, thought it needed a veggie so put in some sweet peas.  My husband and I loved it - the kids didn't like it too much, it had a bit of a gourmet flavor which is good!  Tip:  I used a 12 inch deep skillet to make the recipe in, it accommodated the pasta and I just threw it in the oven since the skillet was oven safe.  So there really wasn't a lot of dishes to clean up.  This is a great, homemade tasting meal for a winter night that you can customize to your family's liking.

This is very easy to put together. I added more garlic to it as I like garlic flavor. I would give 4 and a half but there is no star for that. Thank you for sharing.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I added more milk to the cheese sauce. It was so thick I couldn't mix it into the noodles & ham. Other then that it was awesome! My picky 4 yr old loved it!

I was a bit skeptical about this dish because it didn't look like there was much too it.  WOW, it was amazing!  I think the cheese sauce would be sooo good as a fondue as well.  The only thing I might try differently next time is adding a bit more milk, like 1/4 cup to make the sauce a bit more saucy.  After it's been on your plate it gets a bit cakey, but it has unbelievable flavor.  I also omitted the parmesan in the last step and used shredded colby and monterrey jack because it's what I had on hand.  Right after dinner I made another batch to freeze! Yummy!!

Yummy! I subbed some swiss & fontina cheeses for the colby since thats what I had on hand. I was out of milk so I used a cup of half & half and a cup of chicken broth. Also used the whole box of pasta instead of only 8 ounces.

Delicious!  The only thing I do differently is I use the packaged cubed ham.  My boys love it! I also add a dash or two of cayenne pepper.

I gave it 5 stars b/c my hubby said it was the BEST mac and cheese he's ever had!  I followed the recipe except I added one extra garlic glove, used dijon mustard, and topped it with buttered panko crumbs mixed w/ garlic powder and parsley.  Crunchy on the top and cheesy underneath!! yummy!

Great recipe to use up left over ham or grated cheese. I live in Europe, so had to substitute some ingredients: using dijon mustard, cheddar cheese, and smoked ham. I also added about two handfuls of peas (like a few other members suggested) and used whole wheat pasta. An easy and tasty weekday meal!

My family really liked this recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly but omitted the salt and used a combo of Sharp and mild cheddar because thats what I had. I didn't measure the ham but im sure I used much more than 4oz. to make it more of entree.

I enjoyed the creaminess of mine. If yours turned out gritty that means you didnt smooth out the flour and butter enough and if it tasted like flour you didnt cook it long enough. I was worried about that took alittle longer than expected. Good recipe but needs tweekin. Having different blends of cheeses and maybe peas or broccoli would have helped alot. There was definitely a missing link. Would Try again.

The cheese was grainy, and it took too much time to make something that I could just get out of a box. Two stars because I like the idea of ham with mac n cheese.

Delicious!  I used colby jack cheese because that's what I had, otherwise no changes.  I think a bit of chopped onion would taste great in this too.  This is a recipe that can be adjusted to your taste but is perfect as is!

I was pleasantly surprised with this dish.  I had some extra ham leftover and found this recipe.  It was very good.  Next time I might cut back on the garlic....was a little strong for us.

This was super yummy and super easy. The person who said this was gritty must not have made this right. Mine was very creamy. I used leftover ham and shredded cheddar since that's all I had. Next time I will try with Dijon mustard to see if it makes a difference. But the mustard and garlic added a nice flavor. I will definitely be making this again!!

My family LOVES this!  Will be a weekly staple at our house.  I uses spiral pasta (only because that is what I had) and a mixture of cheddar and jack (only because that is what I had).  Was like an easier version of homemade mac & cheese.  Next time I might put some buttered bread crumbs on top.  Such a flexible recipe.  Easily adaptable to whatever you have on hand.
Thanks

This is sooo  good!  Had left over ham piece and decided to make this.  It was a hit!  I used the colby cheese, but next time I think I will try it with the 
swiss cheese, like others suggested.  I also added a cup of frozen peas to the pasta while cooking, and it turned out great.  Both hubby and son loved it!

This was delicious!  I made few modifications by using swiss cheese instead of colby, skipping the mustard, and using half and half cream and 1% milk.  I also used less flour, and only baked it long enough to melt the parmasean cheese on top, (5-10 mins). My family loved it!  A definite keeper!

I've been in search of mac n' cheese recipe that isn't so grainy.  Unfortunately this isn't one of them.  It had good flavor but I'm just not very fond of the texture.  I'm going to try the four cheese macaroni recipe on this site and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will have a nice creamy texture.

Wow, I can't believe I'm rating this "kid meal" a 5 but it deserves it!  I loved this!  The sauce is creamy and perfect and this is just a delicious meal.  Not fancy, but certainly filling and great comfort food.  I made exactly as written except I added a bit more ham.  Yum!

I haven't rated this recipe yet even though I have made it a dozen times. I am making it again tonight so I thought I had better review it.  I LOVE this recipe.  It is very easy and my family enjoys it.  I make it as a main dish with the ham in it and as a side dish leaving the ham out.  I have thought about adding frozen peas to it but haven't tried it yet. This dish is a winner!

This is a great use of ham using a basic bechamel sauce.  Please consider keeping the mustard in - I read a lot of reviewers who omitted it but it's such a wonderful flavor with cheese and ham.  I doubled the recipe and sent the extras with my fiance to work the next day and his coworkers were fighting over seconds.  It was incredible!  Oh, and I used colby/jack cheese instead of just colby.  It was so incredibly yummy!

My 4 year old said, "Wow, mom, this is really delicious!" This was easy to make (and I've got a 2 year old & a 1 month old, too) and tasted great. My only changes were that I only had sharp & mild cheddar cheese on hand, so I used a combination of those- and I used a good 1/2 cup of parmesan on top. It was a great use of leftover Easter ham. I'll definitely make it again!

There were no leftovers and I changed the proportions to use an entire box of pasta. I did use sharp cheddar because I am not a fan of Colby. I added about a 1/4 tsp of cayanne, because I like the way it cuts a bit of the fattiness of a rich sauce. In addition to the parm topping I added panko bread crumbs that I had leftover, for extra crunch. My family fights over the crunchy top. I grated my garlic on a microplane and it blended perfectly into the sauce. The mustard the recipe calls for is a nice touch. This meal is a real winner. I will be making this again soon.

This was tasty, but very rich.  I added petite peas and had to use more milk than called for because it got too thick.  Good with the ham!

Very good...use ziti (all I had), a ham steak cut into cubes and used swiss and mozzarella. I also used a good heaping tblspn of dijon mustard in the sauce which I doubled because I made a full pound of ziti. This was delicious.

Kids loved it!  I couldn't find shredded Colby, so I used the Colby Jack mix and a handful of sharp Cheddar. Also, the pasta didn't come in an 8 oz pkg, so I used 12 oz and 8 oz ham instead of 4 oz.

EXCELLENT RECIPE! EASY AND INEXPENSIVE,  I ALSO ADDED A DASH OF CAYENNE, IT REALLY PERKED UP THE FLAVOR. THIS SAUCE COULD ALSO BE USED FOR MAKING AUGRATIN POTATOES AND HAM, OR SERVED OVER CAULIFLOWER OR BROCCOLI.
THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

I did however, use a strong cheddar cheese, rather than the colby and it was really good.  I have forwarded the recipe to our friends who enjoyed the dish with us accompanied by a salad and rolls.

I thought this one was just ok.  It may have been because I used cheddar instead of colby cheese though since that was what I had on hand.  I just really didn't like the flavor

Seems like soooo much sauce!  I agree with the others who say to add more pasta, and ham.   Double the garlic, I always say, and use dijon and cheddar.

Definitely a keeper, especially if you have leftover ham. One of those recipes you substitute & add, etc. and make your own. You kind of have to make it once to get a sense of the flavors & then explore the endless possibilities. It’s a great quick meal for one or something simple for many like a potluck at work.

Great comfort food and so delicious! I subbed extra old white cheddar for the colby cheese but otherwise followed the recipe. I may add breadcrumbs along with the parmesan next time for some extra crunch on the top.

I thought this had such an odd flavor, and I think it was maybe the mustard. I might try this again without mustard and with some sharp cheddar.

Winner! This is one of our favourites. I use Mexican  cheese and velveeta. Add peas, one dish meal. Applesauce makes a good side.

It was pretty good! Definitely different. I used another user's advice and used 1 cup Monterey, 1 cup sharp cheddar, and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Also used Dijon mustard.

I made this for my husband since he loves ham in any recipe.  We both thought this was good, but had way to much cheese and I can eat cheese on almost anything.  Won't be making this one again.

I made this for a family who had were having health issues, so I personally did not eat the dish personally other than to taste a morsel or two while licking a spoon. They informed me it was "To Die For". I plan to make it for family soon.

honest opinion: This  was nasty. even after I used the little tips to spruce it up. There was nothing special about this. everyone else loved it. I thought it was gross. I won't be making this again.

By no fault of the recipe, here's what I did.. and it didn't work great

*I used the diced kind of ham. These pieces were so tiny, they were lost in the dish. Would have worked much better with bigger chunks, and just more in general.
*I omitted mustard because one of my roommates wasn't a fan of it
*I used some shredded cheddar in addition to colby jack. 

So I ended up with a kind of mush. I love pasta, but not what I was expecting. Not bad, not great. There needed to be some texture, which we tried salvaging with steamed broccoli, but turns out none of us have made steamed broccoli before, so that was also a bust. Made correctly, I think it would have worked.  I see some people used peas. 

The sauce turned out great, so I'll be playing with that one more.

Will try to make this recipe another time and better.

This was delicious! My entire family, including my picky 11 year old, cleaned their plates. We usually have most of the ingredients on hand which makes it a great weeknight meal. I served it with a side of broccoli which could be kept on the side or stirred into the pasta.

This was fantastic.  I used Cheddar cheese, evaporated milk  and elbows as that is what I had on hand.  As per another reviewer I also added the crunchy onions on top.  It produced a tasty and filling meal.  Will definitely make again.

Big hit with the kids but in my opinion way too much cheese sauce. I would double the ham and add pasta and also try to sneak in some vegetables (peas or asparagus maybe). Couldn't be easier.

Pretty good! I used 1lb of pasta and doubled the sauce, it was the perfect amount! The cheese sauce as written is extremely bland, but I added some cayenne, seasoned salt, another clove of garlic and some diced onion, it helped. It was a great way to use up leftover Easter ham. Served with a green salad for a full meal.

While I enjoyed this recipe, I thought it was lacking a little in the flavor department.  This is even after I added peas, mozzarella, and Italian seasonings to it.  I think it might have been more flavorful if I had added more garlic.  My husband was totally unimpressed though, so I most likely won't be making it again.

Easy to put together, and both my stepson and husband loved it.  Very creamy. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  The only thing I did different was to use rotini instead of bow ties,it was what I had. Other than that, followed recipe.

Okay, so this is amazingly easy and sooo yummy. My husband and I lick the bowls when we're done. Seriously--it's that good. I normally don't like colby cheese, but I thought it worked perfect here. I used dijon mustard instead, but it still turned out perfecto.

As luck would have it, the grocery store had ham steaks on sale and the Allrecipes magazine arrived the next day - so Ham and Cheese Bowties was the logical step.  Easy, crowd pleasing with pantry items, I made it exactly as directed and it would be a success with any gathering where there may be less adventurous eaters.

Loved it.  I don't do much measuring, but followed the ingredients with the exception of cheese.  I only found Colby jack and added Monterey jack, too.  Used more ham than called for.  Used grated parm.  Will be making again!  Thanks for this recipe.

I tweaked the recipe and chose a cheddar, american and swiss cheese mixture instead of the colby cheese, used dijon mustard instead of regular mustard and added panko italian bread crumbs over the top before baking...it was delicious!  Will definitely be making again!!

I doubled this for my large family and only used 4 cups of colby.  It was terribly saucy and sat heavy in everyone's belly.  If I make it again, I will decrease the amount of the sauce or increase the amount of pasta.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. It was good. I love colby cheese, but this was a little on the bland side. I think I would use sharp cheddar the next time. I will probably try this again.

Had to make a dish to bring over to a last-minute cookout and chose this one because I had all the ingredients on hand. I used Colby/Jack cheese, left out the mustard, and used evaporated milk to make things extra creamy. Also topped the dish with a combination of panko bread crumbs and grated parmesan. DELICIOUS! Will have to make again!

My family and I really loved this.  What a great way to use up leftover ham.  The only two things I did differently is that I did add peas and along with topping it with Parmesan, I also added Italian Panko. Please don't leave out the prepared mustard, it really adds a little zing to it.  Thank you for a great recipe.

A little bland. I used Medium cheddar instead of Colby, but it was missing something.

I made this exactly as it was instructed in the recipe, but I think it was just okay.  The flavor was fine, nothing special, but it seemed a little too dry to me.  The cheese sauce was actually kind of pasty, not creamy.  If I try this again, I will leave out the flour, or add more milk, to make it more creamy.

I had some leftover ham from Xmas, of course. I added about 2 tablespoons of tabasco and a little parmesan to the cheese mixture. Not too saucy, just right! I'll make it again!

This is a great recipe to use up leftover ham. However, I doubled the pasta and ham and the still had a LOT of extra sauce.  Quick and easy! Thanks.

This was easy to make and very tasty. I took it to some friends for dinner and they loved it.  I kept a small amount for my husband, who loved it as well. Definitely a keeper -- without ham, this would be a great vegetarian dish as well. Creamy comfort food!

Very basic, not bad at all. Accidentally dumped more pepper than I intended to (probably about a teaspoon?) and I'm glad I did - it needed a kick. Used cheese I had handy, which was some leftover mexican blend and italian blend - I like the combo very much. Also sprinkled some crushed ritz cracker crumbs on top with a few dabs of butter. Nice, cool evening comfort food! A mess to clean up afterwards, however, with 3 pans to clean, plus utensils, etc., but well worth it.

Very tasty and quite simple to put together.... I love making mac & cheese recipes at home because you have complete control over the ingredients. Believe me, restaurants use heart stopping, artery clogging amounts of butter and cheese. I agree that the ratio of pasta to sauce is a bit off... you'll want to use at least 12 oz. of bowties. Also, I used a couple of teaspoons of Dijon mustard and a few splashes of hot sauce to suit our taste. Served this with fresh green beans for a hearty and delicious meal. Thanks for sharing!

We all liked it.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I used 4 cups rotini.  The only complaint was my garlic mincer was missing so I crushed it myself and some people got chunks of garlic which is more than they like.  I think garlic is a good addition but I'll maybe use less or mince it better next time.  We all went back for seconds.

A-MAZING! Left out the mustard just b/c I don't like it & used canadian bacon b/c it was on hand, but I can't imagine the dish being any better than it was. Creamy & delicious w/a little garlic kick...Fabulous!

This was a different take on a clasic macaroni and cheese recipe. I found it to be a bit dry though so will stick with the original mac and cheese.

I have had this recipe saved for awhile and finally decided to make it for dinner last night. My 8 year old said it's worth 4 stars. I did end up changing it a little. First I used mickey mouse pasta and used the entire box. I left out the mustard and used velveeta cheese because that is how I usually make my cheese sauce for mac and cheese we just like the flavor better. I then put bread crumbs and parmesan cheese on the top. I had 4 ham steaks left over so I put them on the top also. I usually make au gratin potatoes this way and top them with the last 4 ham steaks. I guess that is kind of what this recipe reminded me of. I will make this again and soon.

This was pretty good for a quick and easy meal. I used elbow macaroni only because it is what I had on had. I skipped the roux and sauteed the garlic is a tsp butter. Added the milk and cheese, mustard and pepper, and then tossed with the macaroni. Yummy and easy meal! Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this! Of course with 3 boys you can't go wrong with cheese, cheese, cheese and this recipe had a lot of that! I actually tripled the recipe and there was only a tiny serving left for lunch the next day and only because I scooped it out before they finished eating! I think next time I'll use a sharper cheese and try some cayenne pepper for some zing.

Very good. I added broccoli and red pepper and I think that and the ham gave this dish an excellent flavor. After stirring it all together my boyfriend and I decided not to bake it as a casserole. It was already hot and looked delicious.

Very nice twist on our normal mac and cheese.  The garlic was nice but we thought it needed more mustard for a bit of a kick.  I also added some broccoli when I boiled the pasta and added it to the mac and cheese.  Would make again.

Made a few changes to make a little healthier. I used whole wheat pasta, skim milk and cut back on the butter. Used the whole amount of cheese and threw in some cayenne, nutmeg and mustard powder (instead of mustard). Turned out great!

3.5 stars here. It was def edible but very blah. If I were to make this again, I'd use a different cheese. Not a big hit w/the kiddos, only 1 of them would eat the leftovers so quite a bit got thrown away:(

This recipe has become a tradition after eating a spiral ham.  I add more milk or it gets a glue-like texture.  I also use cheddar or whatever cheese mix is onhand.

I was disappointed with the results considering the pretty good reviews. The garlic taste was somewhat distracting.There was too much sauce for the amount of pasta (I used 12 oz but could have used at least 16 oz).  Not bad, but definitely nothing special.

My new favorite way to eat pasta. This recipe is like grown up Mac and Cheese. Served with "Fresh Pea Soup," "Italian Peas," "Fried Broccoli," "Pumpkin Seed Beer Brittle," and "Hot Toddy."

This was good - great way to use up ham. I would, however, suggest a few alterations. I would omit the garlic (it did not seem to fit with the rest of the dish), I think it would be better with a mixture of cheeses, not just colby, and finally I would suggest adding more pasta and ham (5 oz pasta and 2 oz ham for 4 is not quite enough).  I also added some frozen peas and corn when putting it all in the baking dish (no need to defrost, the cooked perfectly when added frozen). I forgot the parmesean topping, and it was fine without it but I will definitely add it next time.  Over all it is a very nice, comforting dish that is pretty easy to put together.

Yummy! I didn't have bowtie, so I used Penne, and instead of colby I used a combo of cheddar and smoked jalepeno gouda. Added a few shakes of chili powder as well. So good!! Definitely a keeper!

wow I have never seen my 16 month old eat soo fast! She loved this pasta and so did her dad. The only changes I made were to use shredded colby and mont. jack cheese because that is what I had on hand. I didn't follow the instuctions on how to cook it exactly. I melted the butter on low then added the flour and whisked stirring constantly for a couple minutes. I let the milk warm up a little in a sauce pan before adding to the butter/flour mixture then added a little bit of the warmed milk at a time constantly stirring. I let that simmer on low heat for atleast ten minutes stirring and stirring until it was nice and thick then turned off the heat and added the cheese a handful at a time, turned out soooo good. Will def. make again! Thank you.

I used egg noodles, added more ham, and also mixed the parmesean into the cheese sauce instead of sprinkling it on top. Everyone enjoyed it.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly but if I made this again I would change a few things. I would use a smaller pasta to stretch the sauce and more ham.  4 ounces just wasn't enough. This is a good basic recipe that you could alter to suit your taste and fit what you have on hand.

This is a good, sturdy "go-to" recipe when needing to use up some leftover ham.  It's a basic home-made cheese sauce.  Can't go wrong.  I made exactly as the recipe stated, just adding a little cheese on top to go with the parmesean to make a crust.  Very good dish.  Will definitely add this recipe to my binder for "what to make with all that leftover ham"!

Great sauce base. I added swiss cheese and doubled the mustard using dijon. I also blanched some broccoli and threw that in as well and used penne pasta. The whole family loved it!

Great starter recipe.  Next time I will use less rue.  You could taste the flour in the sauce.  I'll probably start the sauce with the milk and cheese first and add the rue as needed to thicken.  I did make a few changes that did work:  I used the mini farfarelle pasta (3 cups) and cubed leftover ham (2 cups).  I also used shredded chedder cheese and added frozen peas to the pasta while it cooked.  Everyone loved it and went for seconds.

I LOVE this recipe! Instead of using 4 oz. of ham I used 8. I would add more pasta to this recipe. This recipe has just enough garlic and cheese. It is awesome!!!!!

I'm eating this now...  I only had macaroni, which is fine.  I was hesitant about the mustard, so I only added a small amount.  I used 1 pound of ham because 4 ounces didn't seem like enough.  I used a different kind of cheese, because it was what I had.  It is a hit at our house!

This was unbelievably delicious.  I used some Swiss and Asiago cheese as well along with the colby/parmesan. I also added 3-4 chopped green onions for a little bit different flavor.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  Based on the reviews I was expecting something full of flavor, but found that it came out very bland.  I followed the instructions to a tee, except I doubled the pasta and ham based on the other reviews, all the other ingredients were the same.  The sauce had a very gritty texture to it.  If I could resolve the gritty feeling and add some additional spices to give it some more flavor, I might try it again.

This is one of my family's favorite meals.  We always make this when we have left over ham.  I usually skip baking it, and serve it from the saucepan.

This is a great recipe and my kids just gobbled it down. I didn't follow it exactly: the cheese I had on hand was mozzarella and a little cheddar, I doubled the ham, and I added some frozen peas and frozen sliced carrots. The sauce wasn't as cheesy as I would have liked, but that may be due to the fact I didn't use the cheese called for. I'm sure it's just as good or better when following the recipe exactly.

This was oddly addictive.  I used swiss and cheddar cheese with left over cob-smoked ham from Easter. Broccoli is a natural choice for a side dish.

My husband loved this - as did the teenage boys who found it in the fridge later that night. I made changes based on what I had in house. I used egg noodles and a combination of pepperjack cheese and sharp cheddar. I used brown mustard, but I think honey mustard would be really good. Hubby said it didn't need the parmesan on top - but that was one of my favorite parts.

I barely got any of this.  The daughter ate 2 plates before I went for my first.  I love cheese, but this might be better without the parm on top.  Either mix it in or don't use.  Takes longer to do all the dishes than to make.  Real good, thanks.

This was way better than I was expecting!  I followed the measurements exactly, only substituting dijon mustard for regular, and whole wheat bow ties.  I was thinking it was just going to taste like macaroni and cheese with ham added, but it had a much  more impressive flavor.  I will make this again.

This is a good recipe.  Not earth-shatteringly wonderful, but good.  I used 13 oz whole wheat rotini, had it on hand.  I also used 2 cups leftover ham and increased the sauce a little.  It needed a little more salt, in my opinion.  I'll probably leave out the mustard next time.  All in all, nice dinner.  Thanks!

I used Mozzerella Cheese and Omited the mustard...Also I added peas. My kids went back for seconds, but my husband and I both thought it was good, but not great. Could be the changes I made.

For my husband and I this was a recipe that we could do without. I can't say it was bad - good flavor (I sauteed some onion in the butter when making the sauce) - but it wasn't to die for.The calories made it a bit hard to swallow. Good way to use leftover ham - my kids liked it which was a surprise because they don't generally like cassarole type dishes. Reheated the next day and it wasn't all that great. However - it tastes much better than it looks.

I sauteed fresh sliced fresh mushrooms, cut up red pepper & fresh green beans with chopped garlic.  Added ham to this and then added all to sauce.  I didn't have the colby cheese, so I melted cheddar and mozza slices into the sauce and then shredded a marble cheese on top.  Turned out great!  Next time I will try fresh broccoli or asparagus.

Like others have said, add more pasta otherwise it is too saucy. I substituted dijon mustard which added more flavor as this is a bland dish. Good kicked up macaroni and cheese recipe, but thats it.

This came out pretty good.  My two boys and liked it (they can be pickey) and my husband said it was good too - but I didn't think it was all that special.  It also had a flour-y feeling to the sauce, maybe I didn't make it right I don't know.  All in all I might make this again, but change it up a little (different cheeses and stuff like that).

We enjoyed this quite a bit.  It's very good with peas added to it.  The sauce is a bit rich and the mustard really comes through.

I loved this recipe. I made a few changes to it such as adding a can of peas and using colby jack cheese with some mozzarella. I would recommend using more pasta as it was almost too much sauce. But other than that it was quick and had a great taste.

These were very good, but a little "sticky" for lack of a better word.  The sauce was not real creamy.  But its noodles, ham and cheese.  Yum!  I did like the garlic thrown in there too!

I was looking for something my grandchildren would like but I wouldn't be tempted by, since I'm dieting. I'm not a fan of mac and cheese in any form, but I did taste this, and it was surprisingly good, even to me. Since I didn't have any leftover ham, I used a small can (like a tuna can) of ham chunks, and it was perfect. I will be serving this again - my grandkids loved it.

Delicious. Big hit at my house. I used virginia baked ham and used shredded parmesian cheese instead of grated because that's what I had.  It was still great.  I also forgot to get garlic at the grocery store and had to use garlic powder.  It probably would of been even better with fresh garlic.  Great Recipe, adding it to my favorites.

I absolutely love this dish. It always turns out well and it isn't hard to make. My boyfriend begs me to make this all the time! Since I am on a certain type of diet, I changed the cheese to 2% Mild Cheddar instead of Colby, subsituted whole wheat for the pasta and flour, and used skim milk instead. It turns out exactly the same, but it is better for you (more fiber!)

I love this recipe. I have made it several times and my family always loves it. I bought cheddar by mistake today instead of colby, but this dish turned out just as good. I also added mushrooms and omitted the salt. Since it is hot summer time in Georgia now I did't bake it but served it up right after mixing everything together and putting the parmesan cheese on top. Will for surely make again and try the peas that other members suggested!!!

Delicious!  Added peas to the pasta water at the end of cooking as another reviewer suggested.  Added a nice color (and snuck in the veggie).  My husband, 2-year old, and I really enjoyed it.  It was equally good reheated for lunch.  We will definitely make this again.

Since making this for the first time about five weeks ago we've had it six times. The kids love it, I love it and it's easy to put together. I prefer 1/4 tsp. dry mustard, but prepared works as well. Excellent casserole.

We really enjoyed this.  I used whole wheat mini penne because I had no bow-ties.  I also used sharp cheddar instead of colby, and a hard Irish cheese (Dubliner) instead of parm.  I doubled the mustard and used half regular dijon, half grainy dijon.  I used skim milk and it thickened up nicely.  Served with peas and cherry tomatoes.

This was simple and delicious.  As filling as it is I HAD to get a 2nd plate! Alterations: Used Sharp Cheddar and pizza blend (all I had).  Also topped with bread crumbs and put on broil for last 3 mins.  Excellent week night recipe, we all enjoyed it.

This was easy to make & family and guests had 2nds.  I added leftover chopped spinach & followed the suggestions for adding cayenne and the panko bread crumbs and doubled the recipe.  It disappeared.  Agree that the sauce would be good for Au Gratin dishes. I made a 2nd dish for my lactose intolerant daughter with her lactaid milk and goat cheese. Still yummy! It's a keeper.

This is great for leftover ham, especially after Thanksgiving. This homemade sauce is very creamy and cheesy-just the right texture! Mix it in with the bowties and you're sure to please the family.

My family LOVED this and it was SO EASY!  We didn't find it bland at all like some reported.  We doubled it and had none left over.  A very good recipe just as it is written!  Thank you to the one who shared it!  Just a PS - we're not much of a baked casserole kind of family.  We just ate this right out of the pan and it was perfect so if you're low on time know that you can do the same.

I made this yesterday for the first (and not last) time.  It was great.  I think the colby was perfect in place of cheddar, and the bowtie pasta was a nice change from elbow noodles.  I served plain, steamed broccolie on the side.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The texture seemed a bit off.  Sorry.
