What a creative idea for the Christmas daintie tray or to give away as gifts.  As a daycare provider I am always looking for creative things for the kids to do too!  :-)
Many reviewers felt the taste and/or sweetness was lacking.  I compared this recipe with my favourite peanut butter recipe and it was similar with the exception that my recipe also called for 1 cup brown sugar (I always loosely pack the brown sugar) and one more teaspoon of vanilla.  So you could add these two extra items if you prefer a sweeter cookie!  I personally find that this recipe with these added items made a nice cookie.  I used mini chocolate chips for the eyes and the red M&M chocolate candies to make the reindeer Rudolph's.  I would recommend that you bake your cookies for 8 - 10 minutes to start as mine only took 9 minutes to bake to a golden brown on the bottom.  Using my small cookie scoop which measures a level tablespoon of cookie dough I was able to get about 6 dozen reindeer cookies from this recipe.  The kids and I enjoyed making these cookies!!!

How far this recipe stretches really depends on how big you make the dough balls. For the first few batches, we used about 1/2 Tbs per ball. It worked just fine, but we realized we were going to have a ton of cookies (not that that's a bad thing!), so we moved up to a full Tbs per ball, which also worked great. Either way, the peanut butter cookie with pretzel is a winner!

Not Sweet. Peanut butter flavor is there, but that's all. Am an experienced baker and I knew from beginning that the RATIO of flour/baking soda vs. sugar is waaaayy  off. Result is a dry, cake like, gritty cookie. Also all the granulated sugar needs to be replaced with brown sugar (and more of it).

If you want to make another cute variation of reindeer, make some balls smaller & some a little larger then place on cookie sheet with larger oner one right next to smaller one. Press down on both at the same time with your hand & put pretzels at top of larger one & chips/brown m&ms for eyes. On smaller one, put the red m&ms for the noses. Sooooo cute!

Came out awesome! Just be careful of what kind of cookie sheet you use- it changes how long they should be in the oven for. I used a Pizza stone and followed the recipes bake time and it came out great, but if you are using a cookie sheet bake 2 minutes less than recommended!

These were really fun for my kids to help make. They're 3&5 and were able to totally decorate all of the cookies all by themselves. I just sorted everything out and put them in bowls for them. I used red m&m's for the nose, and choc chips for the eyes so they're like Rudolph. I'm not sure  of the size balls that the author was making, we made pretty good sized cookies and made WAY more than 24- which is great when you have a ton of people to give to. As far as taste goes- they're alright. I've had better pb cookies. I used off brand pb so maybe that's why? And,  at least for my oven, anything over 10-11 mins would be over-baking them.  Overall, a fun cookie to make with your kids or grandkids!

We made these for a cookie exchange. We were not impressed with the flavor, for a peanut butter cookie it has a very subtle cookie flavor that's almost nonexistent. They looked awesome we'll just use a different cookie recipe for the next go round.

My 7 year old and I loved making these.  We read the reviews and added brown sugar so that seemed to do the trick.  The kids didn't mind that they didn't have much flavor.

This recipe makes atleast 3 x more than states.  I followed recipe per directions  and yielded 72 cookies.  I chilled the dough and then scooped scant 1T, rolling into balls about the size of a Ping-Pong ball.  Used parchment paper (ungreased) and flattened by hand, gently shaping into triangles and then pressing in the mini-pretzels, choc chip eyes and M&M noses.  They were so cute and baked perfectly.  The taste of the cookie was not very flavorful but I loved the look.  Lots of fun to make!  I'll hunt for a different dough recipe next time, keeping the same decorations.

The dough was very easy to make and work with.  Loved it!
The girls had fun making them turn into reindeer.  They are adorable!
They make a large cookie and they did expand so space accordingly.  You could probably make 48 and still have decent sized cookies.

These look way better than they taste. Extremely DRY and crumbly!! I followed the recipe exactly and have never had cookies turn out this way. I think the recipe calls for too much flour, just from experience.  Wish I had read the reviews first before wasting the time making them!

total fail, receipt is wrong, cookies are dry and tasteless. If you are going to try it don't get small or tiny pretzels, get mini or really tiny, small or tiny are too large. couldn't eat them, took forever to shape, looked horrible....

These cookies were super-cute and the kids did have a great time making them.  Ours came out dry and not very sweet.  For us, they could have been a little tastier.

These turned out super cute!  I dressed them up with some red, green, and white Christmas sprinkles around the “antlers.”

Next time I make these, I will add another 1/2 cup of sugar or sprinkle them before baking.

I liked the flavor, and they are really cute. However, my husband was not a fan of th taste. Not enough sugar.

They are very cute and fun to make, but they are EXTREMELY DRY.   I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed in the dry taste.

I rated them two stars because they actually look great. But they are dry, and they don't have much peanut butter flavor either. 

If you're making cookies for Santa, then these are cute.

So easy and such a crowd pleaser for my little ones.  My kindergartner had a friend over today and we had a great playdate making these cookies...it's easy enough to have a 5 and 6 year old helping you out ;)

Cute idea.  The kids like the reindeer part.  My 7 year old son helped assemble them and helped me eat some of the dough, m & m's and chocolate chips!.  He had to bring a dozen cookies to a school Christmas program.  

Cookies we OK for peanut butter taste - a little cake-y.  I suppose to keep the dough from spreading out during baking.

I recommend adding chunky peanut butter and 1/2 cup to a cup of ground dry roasted peanuts, if you want to bring out the peanut flavor.  

Perhaps a little more sugar too -  but then you run the risk of the cookies spreading out more.  Overall, good recipe for kids and Christmas.

These reindeer cookies are cute and tasty, look great on a tray of Christmas goodies. I also used a red M&M for  a nose to make Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. I got twice as many cookies as the recipe called for, 51!

While the cookie is super cute, it does lack in flavor. It is lacking about a cup of sugar. The batter tasted great, but baked they were bland except for where the candy was. If you added about 3/4 cup brown sugar that might do the trick. I tried it with 3/4 cup white and 1/2 brown and it still wasn't sweet enough.

Fun recipe to do with kids. The recipe called for 24 balls, that would make the reindeer face way to big in proportion to the decoration. I ended up with 3 dozen cookies and the faces were still too big. The cookies tasted pretty good, it's flaky instead of soft and chewy, and not overly sweet. I used 2 1/2 cups of flour and half a cup of quick oats and 2 table spoons of ground flax seed for some texture.

Cute and easy. However, I shaped in ovals and everything worked out great. The dough isn't sweet enough for my family and me. I may need to use another peanut butter recipe. I used Jiffy peanut butter not sure if maybe I should try another brand and add more sugar.

Only had 1/2 cup butter, so I substituted peanut butter making the total amount of peanut butter I used 1 1/2 cups. The dough was dry and hard to roll into balls, the antlers kept falling off too. Made them with my kids, which was fun. They aren't bad tasting cookies, just need to figure out the antler thing.

i love making this recipe.  its so cute.  the only thing is don't get to close to the pan when you put the stuff on because i burned myself putting on a pretzel.  otherwise its cute and fun for your kids to do.  and people love how they look.
