This was out of this world, mostly due to the dressing. My family gobbled it up and looked for more. Do not let the anchovy paste throw you. The little bit this calls for is more then enough and really packs a flavor punch. A definite keeper.. the kale cooked up beautifully. Some salt and pepper while its  cooking would add some additional flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Like a caesar salad.  A good use for kale but nothing special.  I would remake it if you had kale to spare as its different from other kale dishes and easy to make

Loved it.  Even my husband who sneers at kale said he would eat it again. I put seared ahi on top.
