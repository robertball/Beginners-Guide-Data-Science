Oh, this was so good!  I added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest to bread machine.  Taste was great.  We toasted it this morning for breakfast!

Delicious sweet bread with a hint of lemon.  Wasn't overly sweet, but still a good breakfast bread.  We had it for our Easter brunch.  I followed the directions exactly, except I used pie pans because our cake pans are non-stick, which tends to over-brown.  We brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with sanding sugar, which gave it a pretty look.  Good served with butter.  :)

Made this at my aunt's house- no lemons or lemon extract so I used 1 tsp anise oil and 1-1/2 tsp vanilla-
It turned out great...I took dough from the machine and braided it lengthwise and placed on a prepared cookie sheet to raise in a cool oven.  We were pretty busy so it REALLY RAISED before I remembered it.  I removed it and set it aside in a draft-free area till the oven heated.  It baked up beautifully...the scent in the house was perfection....we rubbed the top with butter- sliced it hot from the oven and enjoyed...it was almost like eating sponge cake/bread...de-lish!
The next morning we toasted it and ate it without butter...so good.  Thank you, now that I am back home I will try it with the lemon as mentioned in the recipe.  That is why I am giving it 4 stars due to not making the exact recipe.  If you enjoy a less heavy bread this is your recipe!

I made half this recipe without a bread machine, proofing the yeast in the water with some of the sugar until foamy.  I then added the remainder of the ingredients, mixing well, and kneading until smooth.  I made one loaf, braiding the dough to add some interest.  The texture was good, and the flavor of the bread was OK, but for us, it needed butter to enjoy.

I made this for Easter, and my family thought it was okay, not "fantastic." I could not find my lemon extract so had to substitute vanilla extract and lemon zest; the lemon flavor was nice. It was my first time using my breadmaker machine; maybe that affected how my bread turned out.
