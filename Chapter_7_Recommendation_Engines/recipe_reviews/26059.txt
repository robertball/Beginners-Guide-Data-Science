I made this for a party and everyone loved it! I only put half the coconut milk/pineapple juice mixture on top because I was afraid it would be soggy. It came out just right.

I made this cake for co-workers and they loved it! I made the cake and added the coconut mixture the night before and refrigerated it. I added the whipped topping the next day and the cake was wonderful! I will definitely make this again!

Good, but I didn't think the cake itself had much of a coconut flavor.  It was VERY moist.  I, too, didn't use all the mixture because I was afraid it would be a mess.  I made a layer cake and mixed some crushed pineapple into the whipped cream.  I sprinkled coconut all over the cake after it was frosted.  YUMMY!!

Friend made this for my birthday and it was very good! I can't wait to make this myself. I may mix pineapple with the cool whip and toast some coconut and sprinkle on top.

I'm not sure how I feel about this recipe's taste. I don't get a distinct coconut or pineapple taste. I am going to let it sit a little longer and try it again. Definitely would reduce the amount of Cool Whip.

Tastes better after being refrigerated overnight. I was disapppointed though that the sauce never thickened and the cake was "floating" in it in the pan. Was hoping for a pudding type consistency here. I bought Cool Whip to use for the frosting but we ended up just adding it to individual servings. This cake is VERY VERY sweet and to me, doesn't really need the added sugar. Some of the family didn't want it at all..

I made this cake for my room-mate, and it is his favorite cake ever. He is always asking me to make it again and again. It is soo moist and delicious. Really the best cake I have ever had.

It is too sweet, I also didn't add the entire amount of liquid because I was afraid it would be swimming in it. I didn't use as much cool whip as they asked for either. Also, I wanted to add in to make sure you get cream of coconut. I think some of these people may have used coconut milk from the sound of their cakes! I won't be trying this one again.

This cake turned out WAY too sweet. So sweet that it overpwered any coconut or pineapple flavor. Don't know if the the pineapple juice or creme of coconut was sweeter than it was supposed to be. Also, there seemed to be too much pineapple-coconut liquid to pour over the cake. Cake was swimming in it. Won't make this again

I was craving pineapple and coconut, so I searched and found this recipe. I modified it just a hair by using coconut cake mix and adding crushed pineapple to the cool whip. Man, this cake is DEE-LISH! It's easy to make, too. I think it would be great with pineapple cake mix, too.
