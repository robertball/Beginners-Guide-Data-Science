This is the best recipe!! I am from Holland and knew this dish already. We use to make it in 3 layers. first the leeks (not to cooked) than the meat and as last the potatoes. You get a nice brown crust on the patatoes. love it.

This is good however, I have made this when I lived in the Netherlands and its typically a very basic recipe....mashed potatoes w/ some nutmeg, sauteed leeks w/ garlic and onion, and some dutch cheese on top before some fine bread crumbs go on top of that.

This was hearty and filling. My first experience with leeks. I think I may have missed out on some flavour for not preparing the leeks properly or something. Next time I think I'd add some garlic (I am a garlic person). Oh and I used bacon instead of ham and jalapenos instead of green chiles. Overall I liked it. A bit more time to prepare than the recipe says. Would probably work great in a slow cooker! Next time I am using my slow cooker to make it easier to prepare (no boiling of potatoes and leeks, just brown the beef and mix it all together well at the end to get the mashed potato effect).

This was a good, hearty casserole. We used similar ingredients but made it easier. Instead of boiling the potatoes and leeks I sauteed the leeks while microwaving the potatoes until soft. When the leeks were soft I put them onto a plate and sauteed the rest of the meat and veggies in the same pan. While those were sauteeing I mashed the potatoes. This made it easy and use less dishes. We did sub veggie meat for the beef and my husband added ham after baking. Being Dutch he enjoyed it very much! Leftovers were great too!

Good dish, husband went back for thirds so will make it again.  I added 1/4 tea. red pepper flakes, salt and pepper during preperation and would keep it at that.  Not a dish that I would take to a potluck or serve to company because flavor is a bit too unique and appearance is less than flatering but overall good for a family dinner.

This was very good and simple, however i didnt have any ham, so i used bacon, and it added a little extra flavour.  I also added garlic to my mashed potatoes..

The meat part of this dish was rather bland, but overall my husband really liked it. Therefore I will try this again but add a few more herbs to the meat mixture to give it more flavour.

Some of the ingredients may sound a little weird at first, but rest assured they all come together for a tasty surprise! This dish turned out to be sooo...good! It took a little bit longer for the entire process than what the time said,but it did turn out to be extremely well worth it! This is another winner at our house.

This turned out nicely.  I took the advice of another reviewer by microwaving the potatoes and sauteing the leeks to save time.  I also added a bit more seasoning and salt to taste.

I love this recipe.  It's so easy to play with and add what you have in your kitchen (although I suppose that's the definition of casserole!).  I have made it as is and I've also made it without the peppers and chilis and instead substituted some zucchini I had on hand.  It was just as tasty.

A very easy dish to throw together. I did saute the leeks with the onion and a couple of cloves of garlic. I didn't have green chile peppers so I added some ground chili powder, it still needed something more in seasoning though. I also added some nutmeg to the mashed potatoes as another reviewer suggested. This was nice to layer by using leek mixture, ground beef mixture, mashed potatoes and finally the cheese and cooked ham.

in a word - wow!
so easy to make and I couldn't keep any leftovers long enough to call them my own. My husband loved this and even my six year old (who tends to be finicky) was eating enough for two. I made it for the first time last week and have already received two "strongly hinted suggestions" via my spouse that I really should make it again...lol
Thanks for a fantastic recipe Brigit!
(btw - my small alterations includes ommitting the chile and the red peppers as well as the ham)...this is just one of those dishes that if you don't havethe ingredients around (as was my case), all of the other great things about it make up for it! 
Definately a do-over!

I wanted to try this casserole for two reasons, besides sounding delicious...  First of all, I liked that many vegetables were incorporated into this dish and there was no added fat. Also, I remember dining in a Dutch household many years ago. I think the dish was potatoes and kale mashed together with other ingredients and I absolutely loved it. My husband and I love leeks so that was another reason for trying this. This recipe was fantastic!  It was a bit of a job putting it together but well worth it since we like leftovers. It was very satisfying on a cold day and the ham and cheese added a lot of flavour.   Of course, the taste of all those leeks, peppers and potatoes will win me over anytime!  Thanks for another great dinner idea!

This was a decent casserole - something like Shepherd's Pie. I layered it like others had suggested but I think next time I would mix it all together.

YUM!  I also was a little uncertain about all the ingredients in this coming together - I had also never used leeks before.  But I have just polished off the last batch I made (just yesterday) and already have a shopping list to remake it tomorrow for leftovers during the week.  Awesome recipe!

Wow, really good.  I was just looking for a recipe to use leeks with ground beef but this is a keeper.  I layered it as suggested by another reader - leeks, then beef then potatoes and cheese.  Used the hot peppers, sweet peppers, potatoes and fresh garlic I had on hand from CSA.  Didn't have ham around but I'm sure that would just make it even better. 
 Thank you!

Pretty tasty. My one gripe is that, for being called "LEEK Casserole", the leeks really got lost in the potatoes, beef, cheese, and other, stronger flavors.
