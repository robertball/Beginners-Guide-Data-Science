This was delicious.  The only changes I made was I used the entire package (8oz) of cream cheese and a 16 oz container of sour cream instead of 3/4 cup.  I also used a little more sauce.  I will definitely make this again and was already asked for the recipe.

This recipe is simple and delicious.  You can play with the sour cream and cream cheese portions.  Will use this recipe again.

Tried this tonight and it was terrific!  Husband and kids all liked it.  I used a few substitutions based on what I had on hand: Ragu Sauteed Onion and Garlic spaghetti sauce (I think any jar sauce will do, actually) instead of Classico,  and McCormick Chopped Chives instead of green onions.  Will definitely be making this again!

Really didn't think I would care about this, but it was fabulous. I didn't have sour cream so I used yogurt. Very, very good! Made it in a large corelle square pan. Filled it right to the top and made great leftovers! Thanks for a great recipe. Yummy!

I wanted to try something different than plain old spaghetti. This was a good substitution.I used mozzarella verses cheddar cheese because that's all I had handy. Next time I will use more sauce and more peppers to give it extra flavor. And probably less cream cheese I felt like it took over a lot of the dish.
