I orginally made this recipe because it was lower in fat then classic pumpkin pie recipes.  However, it was such a hit that I will surely make it time and time again.  However, take into consideration how the crust you use will be frozen.  Mine was slightly overbaked and very difficult to cut, much less eat.  Overall a great twist on a classic pie that all are sure to love!

I wanted something a little different this Thanksgiving so I tried this recipe. It was delicious. The kids especially loved it! The only thing I did differently, was I made a homemade gingersnap crust, which add a little extra spice to the pie.

This was a good recipe. I made a graham cracker crust and put it in a 9 by 13 in. cake pan and I doubled the filling.  I also used cinnamon ice cream instead of vanilla.  A very easy no-bake recipe that left room in my oven for the holiday turkey.

I used a graham cracker crust, did a layer of the ice cream mixture, topped with crushed gingerbread snaps, topped with a second layer of ice cream mixture.

Garnished with caramel ice cream topping, crushed pecans and whipped cream dollops, yum!

As a pie, I think I would have preferred this in a graham-cracker crust, so if I had to rate it as a pie, I would say it was "ok". The mixture, however, made an excellent milkshake! That I would give 5 stars. We couldn't stop drinking it!

I can not believe I finally found this recipe. I can remember my grandmother making this pie every holiday. It was always my favorite. Now my kids can have the same fond memories my grandmother left me!

Delicious!  Only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and it was plenty. Next time will add more pumpkin.

I made this to try something different and because I was bored. I LOVED it! I too used a graham cracker crust instead. This will be a nice alternative this Thanksgiving, especially since I live in Hawaii where it will be warm out come November.

This was very yummy. I had to add extra spices and it was more of an ice cream to me, so I would omit the shell next time. It's quite different to "regular" pumpkin pie.

This is gooood!!! My husband loves pumpkin pie and also likes to eat ice cream. It's a good combination. I eat it with the whip cream topping and he eats it straight, without any topping. I used the graham cracker crust as many suggested. The ice cream filling makes a lot, it spilled out. I just scooped out the overflowing ice cream and ate it. Yummy!

I made this several years ago because it was a no-cook alternative.  Now it's a regular Thanksgiving item.  It's a hit! I use graham cracker crust instead of regular.

I don't care for regular pumpkin pie, and thought maybe I'd like this better, but no such luck.  However, my husband says it is worth 5 stars and guests seemed to like it as well.  The only change I made was that I used a graham cracker crust.

My sister and I tried this recipe a while ago on a hot day when we craved something pumpkin-flavored but didn't want to make a hot dessert. We used a graham cracker crust instead of a pie shell. The hardest part was being patient while the pie freezes! In the end, the pie was absolutely delicious and a huge hit with the whole family!

I used a graham cracker crust and a full small can of pumpkin.  Instaead of 1 quart of vanilla ice cream, I used 1 pint vanilla and 1 pint Haggen Daz ginger ice cream. I took it to a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. I was lucky I still had a little bit of the filling left at home in the freezer! I will DEFINITELY make this again!

I love this recipe because it tastes delicious and I can make it a healthier alternative without anyone knowing. I use sugar-free, fat-free ice cream (sinless sweet cream from Cold Stone) and Spenda brown sugar. It's just as good without the guilt. This is especially useful if you are going somewhere else for the holidays and they don't use the healthier options for their cooking.

Quick and easy to make.  Tasty pie.  Does not need all the brown sugar, makes it much too sweet.  I cut it back to 1/4 C and it was still delicious.  May try none next time but not sure how much it contributes to that 'pumpkin pie taste' and may alter consistency.

My son has milk and egg allergies, so I made this with soy 'ice cream' in a graham cracker crust. He loved it and so did the rest of us.

this was really yummy and tasted great. The consistency was great. It was nice and smooth. I was afraid it would taste like an ice cream cake. It didn't. It just tasted like a frozen pumpkin pie but better cause it was so creamy.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and served it to my hubs, kids and inlaws without tasting it before hand. It stayed together really well while being served, the presentation was lovely, and it was a sweet non-pumpkin-lover-friendly pie. Also keeps well! :)

I made this for thanksgiving this year and was a huge success! I didn't add salt and I added a pinch of ground cloves. I bought gingerbread graham crackers and made the crust out of them. It was awesome! Will definitely make again!

Didn't like the consistency. The only thing I can think of that messed it up was that I used Breyer's Natural Ice Cream, which isn't as creamy as some others. Maybe that's the difference.

I made the dessert for our family's Thanksgiving meal this year and opted for this one since its made a little differently. And it was a HIT! I have made 4 of these pies in about 5 weeks and everyone loved them! My husband doesnt like regular pumpkin pie but says this one has become a favorite! I really like how easy it is to make. I used a store-brand vanilla bean ice cream. The only change I made to the recipe was using 1 & 1/2 teasp. of Pumpkin Pie Spice because that's what I had on hand. I will definitely keep this recipe for our family!

Really easy to make and very tasty! Perfect because with all the allergies in my family I was able to tailor the recipe (no eggs and I used soy ice cream for my niece who is allergic to milk). Everyone enjoyed it :-)

Love it! Substituted one container of non-dairy creamer and an egg for the ice cream, and baked it at 350 until set.  It was the first thing on our Thanksgiving table to go!

Delicious. Made this just like the recipe says and one with a gram cracker crust.  Both delicious, especially with a dollup of homemade whipped cream on top.

I also added ground cloves to this recipe, since I like cloves a lot. It was easy and tasty.

This is really good & easy.  My husband and I each took huge pieces but couldn't eat it all because it's pretty rich-didn't expect that.  I this in the freezer about 5 hours-next time I'll try to time it so it's only in freezer for a couple hours.  That way it won't be as "hard."  I used a store bought grahm cracker crust.  Topped with homemade whipped cream.  Good Stuff!! And yes this would be great in warmer months as well as in the fall.

10 minutes to assemble and I had to fight my daughter for the Pumpkin Pie IceCream. This stuff is the BOMB...I put extra cinnamon on the graham craker crust and a couple extra sprinkles on top of the pie. AWESOME. Thanks...

I just gave this 4 stars because I felt the graham cracker crust wouldn't have enough punch. Instead I made a crust from ginger snaps, perfect compliment for this. Also, I cheated and used pumpkin pie filling. This was so good, and so simple. Something different in the summer.

While tasty it didn't have enough pumpkin flavor for my pumpkin pie lovers. So I doubled the pumpkin and halved the ice cream which satisfied my pumpkin pie lovers.  Over all a recipe worth keeping and making over and over.
