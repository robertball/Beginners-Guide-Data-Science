The quiche turned out well, although I omitted the red pepper, and it required more baking time than stated.  Everyone loved it!  Would definitely make again.

GREAT RECIPE!!!  I accidentally left out the red pepper and liked it much better than with the pepper in it.  I also subsituted sherry for the wine.  I make a crustless version by using swiss cheese slices as the "crust" instead of putting shredded swiss on top.  It is really good!

Delicious. I subbed sherry - didn't have an open bottle of white handy - and it came out great. I used baby Swiss for a milder flavor. I  A little more work than "Crab Quiche I", also from this site, but worth it.

I am never sure whether I should review a recipe when I have not followed it exactly, but hopefully my changes were not major. I left out the wine as I had none open. I used a combination of mozarella and cheddar as that is what I had. I added mushrooms because I had some. It was tasty and delicious.

This quiche is delicious!  I am not a seasoned cook, so this was my first quiche and I was very pleasantly suprised.  I added green peppers, baby shrimp, and used a mexican blend cheese rather than the swiss.  It was fabulous!!  Wish me luck on my journey to becoming a good cook!!

I made it for my mom's birthday. It had a light texture, but a rich taste. I made my own crust. I used the canned premium lump crabmeat (about $4 instead of $20). I would use a little more red pepper next time.

Very good.  Everyone in my house liked it.   I used "lump" crab meat.  It's costly but makes a big difference.

I thought this was wonderful.  I did not use a crust for this and I also used some Gruyere cheese instead of regular swiss. It was delicious!

I recently had Lapband surgery and this was something I cooked THE DAY I was able to eat solid foods (2 weeks post-surgery) and this was AMAZING!!! the flavors were really good and it was really easy to make. I enjoy this recipe a lot. I'd like to try it with a mixture of real crab and artificial.

I followed the recipe pretty closely. I only had 1 small can of crab.  I added extra shredded swiss cheese.  I loved the way it turned out. I did use a frozen pie shell from the grocery store. I thought it was going to be too shallow for all of the ingredients but it wasn't.  This was easy to put together and turned out very well. I did find that I had to bake mine a bit longer. I kept it in the oven until it browned a bit.  I will definitely make this again. When I do, I will use more vegetables and two cans of crab and maybe double the eggs and cream.  This  recipe is very good. Might as well make two at a time! I would also like to serve it with a salad or some fruit.  Very very very good!

This was really good.  I didn't have any green onions so used a red and a can of crab (I'm landlocked, not much good seafood,but otherwise followed recipe would have been better with green and regular crab I think). I used a homemade crust and prebaked 5 min.  I think a little longer would have been better.   I resisted the urge to use one more egg and it filled an 8 inch pan just right.  Very yummy.  I ate 1/3 myself and froze the rest for lunches.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this! It's a keeper. I did use leeks instead of green onion, jarred roasted red peppers, and sherry. Needs a deeper pie shell than the frozen ones in my grocery store. Yum o.

This is a great recipe!  I love making quiche and most recipes for quiche call for more liquid which takes it forever to set.  This amount of liquid (eggs and half n half) is perfect.  I did add mushrooms (about 1/4 cup finely chopped) and I added some pimentos (just because I had them - I would have added the red pepper if I had one) and I also added about 2 Tablespoons finely chopped onions.  Very yummy!!

Made for Thanksgiving 2009 and even the TEENAGERS loved it!  Delicious and light, with the just the right balance of flavor between the peppers and crabmeat; it was really fantastic.

This was a simple recipe and very good.

I agree it needed to be baked longer than 25-30 minutes.  Probably about 35 minutes.

Next time I might try adding some mushrooms and/or shrimp to it.

I followed the recipe too and it was very good.  So easy.  I'm going to try substituting ham or bacon and see how it turns out.  I made this one night for a quick dinner for two.  I didn't mind the leftovers one bit!  Yum : )

This was great.  I made it for Christmas breakfast and everyone loved it.  If you like crabcakes, you'll probably like this.

I don't like swiss cheese, so I used a mexican cheese blend like another reviewer did.  Also, I cooked it for 35 minutes and it came out perfectly.

This was easy and delicious.  I pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes at 350 (I used a pillsbury refrigerated crust).  Will definitely make this again.

I used canned crabmeat and the quiche ended up tasting awful. Maybe if I used real crabmeat it would have tasted a lot better!

I'm not so sure about the cooking instructions on this recipe. After pre-baking my crust for 5 minutes, I had to leave my quiche in the oven at least 35-40 minutes. I don't know why but the crust on the bottom didn't look cooked through. The quiche tastes good, but it's a bit moist. I cut out the bell peppers, used canned lump crab, and didn't add the wine since I didn't have a bottle open. Instead of swiss I used a mexican blend and a bit of shredded parmesan on top - definitely had to use 1 cup or more. I might make this again with some changes.

Very good and easy. Didn't have a red pepper on hand so I used an onion and added more cheese than required. My oven required about 40 mins of bake time for this one as opposed to the 25-30 min recommendation. We will definitely make this again!

It was very good! I did not add the wine because I did not have any on hand.  I think I will make it for my next brunch in smaller tart pastry shells.

First time I have ever made a quiche, and this was crazy easy! My use of salt was Old Bay, and my use of pepper was Mr’s Dash table blend. Loving garlic, I added that as well. Past that followed this to a T and had instant love!

I added mushrooms & used sherry in place of white wine, as some other reviews suggested.  This was such a great recipe!  I will make a shrimp quiche with this same base recipe next.

This was a HUGE hit for brunch! I forgot to buy a red pepper but had a large tomato, so I sautéed it with the onion, and it turned out great! It did need additional time to bake, but I am sure it was due to the juice of the tomato. I used high quality Phillip's crab claw meat.  Absolutely delicious! My husband is already asking me to make it again.

This was really good, and so simple. I omitted the hot sauce, because I am not comfortable guessing how much to use. I used a tsp of Old Bay seasoning, and that was just right for our family. I used two cans of crab and added feta (that I crumbled into chunks myself) and spinach (that I had lightly sauteed). Rave reviews. Will be making this again soon and often!

My Gullah Girlfriend returned from SC lowcountry with a bunch of blue crab meat.  Used some of it in this recipe, and added a little old bay seasoning.  Delicious.  Will make it again.

My wife put it best when she said, "That was delicious." Stuck to the recipe, except as follows: (1) Added ten drops +/- of hot sauce to the wet mix, and (2) Used Gruyere instead of Swiss. Also, enhanced the flavor with squeeze of lemon on my serving. As others have mentioned, required baking time was a little longer than recipe suggests. Definitely an addition to the regular rotation.

Followed the recipe exactly making no changes at all.  It was wonderful and came out perfectly.  I may make  some adjustmets just to indulge personal preferences but will most definitely add this to my recipe box.

My family DEVOURED this quiche!  I made it exactly as written, and to be honest, it was simply to use up two cans of canned crabmeat I had for some odd reason.  It was simple, but elegant enough that I may make it as mini-quiches to serve at an upcoming tea party. Just the kind of recipe I need when cooking for a crowd.  Thanks!

The only change I made from the recipe as written was to substitute green pepper for the red as that is what I had on hand.  I used two cans of crab which equaled about 1 cup.  For a dish so easy to prepare, this tasted very special.  My family loved it and we will probably make this often.

This recipie was outstanding.  I substituted a small red onion added some sauted broccoli a little extra swiss and some feta cheese.  I cooked it for about 30 minutes.  Sweet red peppers really added to the flavor!  One of the best recipies!

This recipe is so easy and full of flavor. I adjusted because of ingredients I had on hand...added about a cup of chopped mushrooms, doubled the crab to two cups, used the sweet mini peppers, used cream and half and half. Will use this recipe often because it is flavorful, incredibly easy and very adaptable!

Made it for family and everyone raved about it. I put in an extra egg, 1 1/2 cups of cheddar , some grated nutmeg and a little extra wine. It was a hit with a simple tossed salad.
