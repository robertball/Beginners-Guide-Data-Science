These were very good and smelled great coming out of the oven. The only thing I did differently was to add kosher salt, and I sprinkled them with lemon pepper. Before I baked them I defrosted and drained the edamame on paper towels to get the excess water off. Next time I'll try adding cayenne.

This is very good however, I roasted for quite a bit longer...until edamame was a little darker and firmer. The end result is very nutty and delicious. I did not use basil. I used sea salt, pepper, cayenne, chili powder, garlic powder, and cumin.

Based on the "oily" warnings from the other reviewers, I sprayed the beans with a couple of squirts of Pam Olive Oil.  No oily residue at all!  I loved the spice combination.  I also left out the basil added garlic powder and a pinch of kosher salt.

Tried this today to have as a snack. I may have done something wrong, but it was like eating cold beans covered in some spices. I may try this again as a side dish instead of cooling to have as a snack. I would definitely add some heat next time - maybe some cayenne.

This is fantastic. They're not good when they get cold, so make sure you serve hot. This is a great twist for edamame.

These are pretty darn good.  I added garlic powder (thought it would work with the spice combo) and I do not have dried basil just fresh so I deleted that spice.  I thought it needed some salt, but other than that it is good and spicey and would make a good beer drinking appetizer.  Thanks for sharing.

This was really good. We have been on an edamame kick lately and this really hit the spot. Next time I would maybe add some fresh garlic, as it is missing just a tiny tiny something.

This made my kitchen smell so good that I almost want to use it as a potpurri!  I did everything as instructed and I must admit that I was surprised at how "baked" the texture turned out to be in the finished dish, but I found it delightful.  I can also see how these would be great to keep on hand as a yummy and healthy snack!  Kudos!

Followed the recipe to a T! Thought they were delicious! I do agree that cayenne would be a nice addition and even garlic powder but over all this recipe was great! Thanks!

Great recipe, but not spicy enough for my family. We will be using more chili powder on the next batch. Makes a great snack.

I didn't really like this.  I tried it warm and then cooled, didn't care for it either way.  This is my first taste of edamame, so maybe I'm just not a fan of them.

This was a good side dish but still couldn't get my husband and three boys to eat much of it.  Hubby thought it was a little "oily".  I had it the next day over penne and that was a good meal too.

I made these using edamame in the shell as I wanted something to munch on during a movie.  I used a bag of beans and doubled the spices ... and added salt.  I baked them for about 20 minutes, stirring a couple of times.

Not terrible.  Definitely was a spin on a usually typical vegetable.  But it was lacking... something.  Maybe it was salt?

We were disappointed. I think we are such die hard fans of edamame made in the standard way (in the pod with kosher salt) that this just did not fit with our taste buds. So if you really like traditional edamame then this may not be an appetizing dish for you.

This was a perfect way to punch up a vegetable without adding "bad" stuff.  It was tasty, but not spectacular, but you can only expect so much out of soy beans.

I followed the advice of drying the beans prior to preparing them, but they were still just soft and mushy, with a flavor we did not care for.

I thought that these came out just "ok". I expected there to be a lot more flavor but I felt that it was pretty bland. I will say that the first couple of pieces were eh but the more I ate the more they grew on me. If I ever decide to make this again I will add kosher salt into the mixture to bring out the flavors more and I'll add cayenne pepper and more chili powder to intensify the heat.
Also, like many of the reviewers before me I also had to increase the cook time. It took forever for these guys to roast. Probably about 30-45 minutes. I'd suggest baking at a higher temp. to see if that makes a difference.

I used soy sauce in place of cumin and garlic powder instead of onion powder. I also added teaspoon of sea salt.
On the cook time: I stirred them again after the 15 minutes, lowered the heat to 300, and added 5 minutes to the bake time (hoping they woukd crisp more). 
They are flavorful, but I would have preferred them to be crispier.  I am thinking that lowering the heat a little and adding more bake time could crisp them up more.

It was alright. There was something I think may have been missing or to subtract. I was not sure but it was good. It would be great if served in a hot bowl or plate to keep warm longer. I mixed with pasta which kept it warmer longer.

I liked this, but my hubby wasn't to impressed. It was a lot of work for nothing. We had Edamame, just plain, in Mexico as a snack & they were good. Don't know if I'll make again. Since I don't think many people buy them in our town, they were hard to find in our store, maybe they weren't the best.

These were good.  I increased the temp to 400 degrees and roasted them for approximately 20 minutes on the bottom rack.  I also mixed some grated parmesan cheese with the herbs.

I enjoyed these when they were hot but not so much the next day. Also I should've cooked them longer so they were slightly more crunchy.

It was bland, tasteless and mealy. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using granulated garlic instead of onion powder and using a cookie sheet rather than a glass container. Maybe using glass is the secret? I found that it also needed salt and a lot more garlic to make it edible. However, this seems to be a healthy snack so I will keep trying...

Delish!  I followed the recipe (almost) exactly ... I don't generally measure herbs and spices because I know what my family and I like.  Baked exactly as the recipe called for, and they were awesome!  Highly recommend ... and there was no need for salt ... the combination of spices was that good.
