Made as written, and it was a huge hit. My husband raved about it, and it will now be a staple in my summer pasta dish rotation.

Amazing cheese sauce, and I loved the lemon zest kick!  I made it with steamed broccoli instead of peas and skipped the mint because I didn't have any on hand, and I was amazed at how delicious and easy this recipe was.  Looking forward to trying it again with the mint.

I made it as directed, it was good.  I would cut back on the lemon and add some liquid, maybe a few tablespoons of pasta water or cream, it was a little dry.  I had left over ham, so reheated as an option to add on top as well as dried onions.  I'll make it again.

10.1.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/254914/little-ears-pasta-with-peas-mint-ricotta/ ... I halved this, subbed with cavatappi - that's so fun to eat -  skipped the zest, fresh lemon per serving,  frozen peas.  That's not toooo bad, right?   I mean, after all, I did use ricotta & fresh mint!  :O  I liked, but it wasn't well-received by the rest.  'Tried before & after mint.  Good either way, but I  think I'd like the after mint version as a chilled pasta dish.
