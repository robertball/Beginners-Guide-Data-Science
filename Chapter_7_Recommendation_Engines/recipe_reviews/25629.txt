This was very moist and came right out of the pan nicely. A beautiful bright red topping. But it was extremely sweet. If I make it again, I will cut back on the marshmallows or sugar.

I have had this recipe for years. My family loved it and took it to church suppers every year and the people, even thos who do not like rhubarb, raved about it.

This was a great recipes, my son loved it. I used the fruit flavored mini marshmellows and that added a little more flavor.  Was very good.

Comes out of the pan very easily. My family didn't care for the taste. They would have preferred fresh strawberries instead of the strawberry jello.

This was a good recipe but I would use more rhubarb and add some strawberries.  It was a little dry on top.  Very sweet.

This was a wonderful way to use up all that rhubarb.  The cake was light as air, and it was especially tastey with strawberry swirl icecream on top.

Great recipe! Added a small box of instant vanilla pudding to my cake mix which made this cake more dense and moist.

Fantastic recipe. I substituted 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for the 4 tablespoons of tapioca pudding the recipe called for and it turned out great. Thank you.

It was very moist, it came out of the pan really easy, and the flavor was good, but I feel it needed more rhubarb. Seemed like the ratio of cake vrs rhubarb was off.

Everyone enjoyed this easy dessert.  I used a scant 1/2 cup of sugar because I knew it would be too sweet for our tastes and this worked out very well.   I like the ease in making this dessert but cake mixes always have a processed taste to me so I probably wonâ€™t be making this again.
