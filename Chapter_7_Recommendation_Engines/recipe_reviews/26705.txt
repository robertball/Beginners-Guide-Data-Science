My family has made this every year for Christmas as a tradition for 40 years. It is a northern Italian recipe. BUT we made it like the previous poster. NO CREAM... USE olive oil instead. It is all put in an electric skillet on medium heat in the center of a table. (HINT: duck tape the cord to the table and to the ground so no one trips over it.) Cook until the anchovies dissapate and the flavor sets in...about 30 minutes. Do not burn. We use 4 cubes butter, 4 cups olive oil, 4 cans anchovies and about 4 whole cloves of garlic. Add more as you eat and cook. We all swarm around the skillet with our skewers and dip in filet mignon, shrimp, lobster, cabbage, mushrooms and good crusty Italian bread. Indulge with a glass of wine too! It is fun to cook, eat and socialize. No one would ever know that there were anchovies in it. It is really garlicy and your house "reaks" of garlic for several days afterwards too! Every new person that tries it is very apprehensive at first but the next year they invite themselves and couldn't imagine a Christmas without it.

I would not recommend anybody to use the cream. but that is just my opinions.

I am a garlic lover and when I came across this recipe, I thought it would really be good.  Keep in mind:  I can't think of ANYTHING that I don't like.  I love to cook, especially different things.  I had my family for Christmas day this year, and I told everyone they had be bring something different, something they hadn't made before.  I thought this would be so much fun.  Well, I chose to make this Bagna Cauda.  Everyone in my family loves garlic as well, so I thought it would be a big hit.  I'm sorry to say....this has to be the worst tasting stuff I have ever made or tasted!  When I was making it...I thought, "I hope it tastes better than it smells!"  Well...when I got some on my finger, and subconsciously I went to the sink to wash them, instead of the normal 'licking' it off...I knew I was in trouble!  :-)  But..I thought I'd still taste it and see.  I have to be honest and tell you that I gagged.  I couldn't even swallow it!  I had crusty bread with it.  I don't know what others see in this, but I, for one, won't ever make it again.  About 5 other family members tried it, because they couldn't believe it could be 'that bad'.  Well..they all agreed, hands down...it was horrible.  I'm sorry!  I guess it's something you had to grow up with!

Whoo, boy!, we just finished our bagna-cauda.
It was delicious!.
My granny used to do this for grand occasions, where there were at least ten people round the table, and to me, this bagna-cauda means good memories.
Unfortunaley, by the time I asked my granny for the recipe she was already ninety-nine and she had forgotten the recipe!!.
This recipe is extremely similar, except that, I'm thinking that she might have put more anchovies and garlic in it, plus a little olive oil and pepper.
And we always served as fondue it in a founde pot to keep it hot.
All in all, this is a wonderful recipe, even my husband who doesn't like anchovies loved it.

A note for those who don't know what to serve it with, we eat it with boiled potato chunks, italian bread, celery, gren bell peppers, cooked broccoli and cauliflower, raw carrots, cooked green beans and steamed onions and boiled cardoon.

And I thought WE were the only ones who ate this!  We have this every New Year's - handed down through many generations of my family.  We do it just a little different.  We use 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 real butter and saute' the anchovies and garlic over low heat until they fall apart.  We then put it in a fondue pot and add the cream about 6 oz. at a time.  We fondue steamed cabbage wedges and raw mushrooms and catch the drips with the crusty Italian bread.  When the bagna cauda starts to thicken, add some more cream and let warm up before dipping some more.  When I was younger, we tried this out on our boyfriends.  If they didn't like it or wouldn't try it, they weren't keepers!  Luckily, my husband and brother-in-law love it!

My family has been making this for years to go with fondue, but it is good for any occasion!  I use 1 stick of butter, 2 can anchovies minced or chopped, lots and lots of fresh garlic, and some olive oil.  I've never tried it with cream or chilling it first...  I put everything in an electric skillet on med-low heat and let is simmer until the achovies dissolve in with the butter and garlic.  Then we dip cabbage and bread into the sauce.  Add bits of butter or olive oil if you need a bit more liquid after people have snacked for awhile.  Rich and delicious!!!
Don't forget to brush and use listerine for the next couple of days  :)

OMG!!!  Someone actually makes this recipe the same way (well almost) my dad did when I was a little girl. I'm now 56 years old.  Most Bagna Calda recipes don't add the cream, but my dad always did.  He actually added evaporated milk.  This recipe is awesome - brings back some old memories !!!!!

I make this dish every holiday, but served this specific version for my latest New Year's Feast, and it ended up being the main attraction. Opened with the dip, and when my guests finished the meal, we all stayed at the table just dipping foccacia. I was asked for the recipe, and typically I do not tell people about the anchovies until after they have tasted it, but it did not sway my friends as they all were pleased to know what that special something was :)

Good Bagna Cauda! This is a slightly different recipe than the one passed down in my family. It was a nice twist, but I prefer my recipe overall. I use only butter, garlic, and anchovy paste. But this recipe still was good!

My friends and I absolutely love this dish.  We always have to make 3 different versions one regular, one without cream and one with tuna instead of anchovies.  Tuna makes a great variation of this wonderful recipe.  Also we saute the garlic and the anchovies/tuna for a bit before adding the other ingredients then blend till smooth after it cooks.  The only time we refrigerate is the left overs.

We make it with Anchovies and Tuna, butter EVOO, and massive amounts of garlic.  Served with fresh baked italian bread. Man so good! Going to make some tonight. No milk or cream though, that would make it into a gravy.

I use Bagna Cauda as a base for my clam sauce.  I use olive oil instead of cream and add white wine and fresh clams.  It's a family favorite!

My dad grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where many nationalities settled in search of work in the mines.  We're Scandinavian but I think we consider our "family dishes" to be pasties (Welsh) and bagna cauda (Italian). People seem to be in two camps with bagna - love it or hate it.  I make it and invite my mom and sister over while my husband has to leave the house.  Don't let that scare you - this is a delicious dish.  Garlic lovers will love this!!

I thought this was something only my dad made for my family on fondue night.  When we do it, we use an electric skillet on med-low, start with two sticks of butter, some olive oil, approx. a whole garlic bulb, and the 2 cans of anchovies.  Once we soak up most of the liquid, we add in another stick of butter if we want it.  We also dip cabbage, veggies, meat, and bread in ours.

I have never hear of/tried it with cream...bet it is good!  I do not suggest mixing half cream and half olive oil.  It's probably good either way, but not combined.  Just don't burn the butter and cook it nice and slow until the anchovies dissolve...YUMMY!

Like many Americans, for much of my life I totally avoided ever even trying anchovies.  Then while dining in an Italian restaurant one evening, the host ordered anchovies to add to his spaghetti dish.  I was intrigued,and gave them a try.    I was quite surprised to discover that I REALLY liked the fishy/salty taste of these little fishies.  The reason I bring up the above is because of the extreme flavor that the anchovies bring to this dip.  If you don't like the strong flavor of anchovies, you probably won't like this dish.  The garlic is just an added attraction!  I have never been to Italy, so my exposure to Italian food has been entirely of the American variety.  I have tried several variations of Bagna that are heavy on olive oil, and I found them less enjoyable.  This version that uses heavy cream was - to my taste - truly excellent.  Thank you Julie P. for sharing!

I grew up eating this and sadly my husband doesn't like it and I LOVE it.  We did not put cream in -- just the butter, garlic and anchovies. We used celery cabbage and we dipped pickled peppers and mushrooms and swiss chard, also the crusty bread and let it drip on that.  Makes my mouth water to think about it.

Like another reviewer, for a New Year's Day feast, my Italian family has had the tradition of cooking bagna cauda for several decades.  We, also, use olive oil instead of cream and simmer the mixture in a frying pan until all the ingredients are melded.  One addition suggested by a newcomer to our celebration was to use pineapple as part of the "dipping" foods.  We also use cheese as a quick dip and it is very good on crusty bread (which is the showpiece food in my family).  For those that don't like achovies, you will never know they are in the sauce.  Felice Mangiare!!!

I've made this using olive oil, no cream and about 1 cup of clarified butter. We do it as a fondue adding fresh chopped vegetables, onions, broccoli, mushrooms, cauliflower, carrots, ect. and letting them cook at the table. Then everyone fishes out what they want to eat. It's a little oily but if you use a piece of french bread to blot it it's very tasty, plus you can eat the bread after.
Then we just turn the heat back up and cook our meat in it. You can add a little more olive oil if nessasary.

This is a love it or hate it thing and I love it. My wife hated it until she got pregnant and has now loved it for the last 30 years. My family's recipe used half as much cream and it's a 50% half and half and 50% heavy cream mix but otherwise it's the same recipe and I have tried using olive oil and gave up, it just isn't the same unless it's all butter. You can dip anything in it, most any vegetable, bread, cheese, fingers, I especially like the end of a loaf of hard bread. Just take and smush in the bread so you have a small bowl of the crust then scoop.

I made this as a dip for New Year’s Eve and it was phenomenal! My husband and I both loved it. This will become a staple go-to dish in our house.

We make this twice a year but I use one stick butter melted, one can anchovies stirred in until it disolves, then add 8 garlic bulbs chopped . Stir until garlic is cooked (about 6 min) and then add a quart of heavy cream.  Cook and stir until cream thickens and becomes like a fondue or dip.  (About 45 min).  It needs to bubble but stir so it does not burn.  Heat should be low but cream needs to bubble.  Sounds like it takes a long time but it is worth it! Serve as a dip for raw cabbage, peppers, cauliflower, celery and Italian bread.

My mother's family had been making this since they were kids in Benld, Illinois. 
Our old Christmas tradition is to put a hot plate in the middle of a table to keep the bagna cauda (hot bath) hot and as all stand around the table, dip fresh napa cabbage, lettuce, broccoli, green pepper etc., and let it cool over held plate of Italian bread, then when bread soaked, eat bread. Always looked forward to.

Bagna has been a Christmas tradition in our family for years.  Most of us prefer to leave the cream out.  We call the kind with cream, "Beginner Bagna" because it's not as garlicy and strong.  Some people have to work up to the full strength.  Preferred dippers for us: french or italian bread and Napa cabbage.  We also put tons of fresh mushrooms in.  You either love it or you hate it; there's no in-between.
