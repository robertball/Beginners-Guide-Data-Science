Mmmm,mmmm, good!  I was looking for something different than the hundreds of recipes that have mushroom gravy, since my family doesn't care for mushrooms. The sauce was rich and delicious.  The only adjustment I had to make was that my chuck roast was still tough after cooking on high for five hours, so I had to cook it another five hours.  Next time I'll start earlier and cook for 10-12 hours on low.  Highly recommend this recipe.  Surprised it doesn't have more reviews.

Missing all of the goodness from the skillet (there's a lot of flavor left). After removing the meat, deglaze with a bit of wine or broth and pour that into the slow cooker. I also like a bit more seasoning, like garlic, basil, black pepper, seasoned salt.

Made it exactly to the recipe shown and it was fabulous, both my husband & I enjoyed this and it made 2 extra meals for us. If anything, due to the sodium amount in the nutritional info, I would probably not add the salt to the spices and look for a low salt version of the cream of mushroom soup. Usually I don't make a recipe until it is tried and true and gets excellent ratings, but I am soooo glad I tried it.

Made this tonight with a venison roast. It was delicious! I served it with sour cream for the potatoes and meat and an extra side vegetable.

Brown sugar....who could know?  I will give this one five stars because this was the easiest and most tender pot roast I have ever made.  5 hours on high and I added 4 cloves of garlic [crushed] and 12-14 cremini mushrooms [halved].  I coated the roast in flour, kosher salt, and Herbs de Provence and browned to a nice crust.  You need a 6 qt or better cooker.  All I can say is the guests were all saying yum, yum, yum.  This recipe is a keeper!

Was a hit in my house! I saved some time and made a few changes. I skipped the step of browning the roast, left the skins on my potatoes and whole carrots, used whole onions, and did not thicken the sauce at the end. I layered everything in the crockpot as the recipe stated. Cooked it until the meat came apart easily in small hunks which allowed the juices soak into it. When plating, spoon juices over the meat an vegetables. Really good and  as simple as it gets!

My family loved this. Even my very picky 16 year old daughter liked it. She has requested it twice in one week.  Very easy to prepare. Thanks for a great recipe!

Have tried several of these and none were as good as this one. Made it exactly as written. Next time only change I might make is to add some mushrooms and maybe a splash of red wine to the reduction just because I like the taste

MMMMMM.....excellent flavor.  I did soften the onions in a bit of olive oil as I have a thing about not adding raw onions to a crock pot-a personal thing.  Removed the onions and put them over the other vegetables. Then I added the meat to the pan and browned it.  I did add salt/pepper/garlic powder to the meat and deglaze the pan with a bit of white wine to get those brown bits and poured this over the meat.  I also added a few sliced mushrooms, too, that I had to use up.  At this point I put the crock point insert in the fridge overnight.  I mixed up the sauce in a separate bowl and refrigerated. In the morning I put on the dish after pouring on the sauce.  About 4 hours into cooking I did add one packet of beef bouillion dissolved in a cup of hot water as I was concerned that there wasn't enough liquid to fully cook all of the vegetables. I cooked it for 10 hours.  The broth and dish was delicious and the house smelled great.  I didn't thicken the sauce and liked it just fine as it was. So did my husband and son!! I will definitly make this agaain.  Thank you for the recipe.

A different way to flavor roast.  I added bay leaves, smashed garlic and rosemary. Very tasty.

This was delicious. And so easy. Followed the recipe as written (other than adding a little garlic salt and onion powder to the meat). The meat was fall-apart tender and the veggies were delicious in the sauce. My family loved it.

My chuck roast was not tender at all. Didn't think the sauce was all that flavorful. I did just what it said and cooked it on the stove for 15 min. It never thickened.

Family absolutely loved this recipe!  A bit different than the usual pot roast.  I did saut√© the onions as others had suggested right in the same pan as I had browned the roast.  Deglazed with a splash of white wine and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  A bit of work to get it into the slow cooker, but a lovely smell in the house all day!

I made this exactly as written but it tasted very bland to me.. I had to jack up the gravy by adding beef broth, more salt and even some packet gravy mixes.  I'm not one of those "over-salters" either.. but it needed it! Sorry but not for me.  :/

VERY GOOD. We enjoyed the sweet flavour. Easy to double for leftovers. Slow Cookers seem hotter these days. Watch cooking time . Mine did not need that long..

This was very tasty and a nice change from the usual treatments with onion soup mix or cream of mushroom soup.  The sweet-sour taste was subtle; just right I thought.  I sliced sweet onions instead of chopping them and I think that blended better with the other vegetables than chopping them.

This is delicious.  I made it just as the recipe stated and everyone raved about it. This will join my favorites list. I did choose to cook it on high for 4 1/2 hours due to time constraints.

I can't really rate this recipe fairly until I manage to try it with a roast that isn't 80% fat and grizzle.  We ended up throwing ours out after finding just enough that was edible for dinner.   But we liked the sauce and the flavor of the beef of what we could eat so for that reason and the fact that it's super easy to put together, it gets 4 stars.  I will try this again with a better cut of beef.

Always try to make them the 1st time as written.  This one was a winner!   Wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. Saved the leftovers,cut them up added about  one cup beef broth, and some frozen peas and made two  small cartons to freeze  for a quick meal for one. Thanks for sharing.

I substituted baby carrots and quartered unpeeled gold potatoes in this recipe and it was delicious. The aroma filled the house and my husband and I  enjoyed the taste of the dish as well. The meat was tender and the sauce 'made' the dish! I will make this again!

I cooked it 10 hours, but that might have been a bit too long for my slow cooker.  The roast was a bit dry, but tasty.

I have made this recipe several times. This is truly a big favorite of mine. I think it's a little too sweet for my husband but he eats it just fine. Because of that I don't make it regularly but it is one of the best roast recipes I have ever had.

This was just ok for me. Not too flavorful. I had to add wine, beef broth and seasonings to the sauce. The meat was nice and tender though.

The tomato tends to detract from the natural flavor of the meat; the sauce doesn't help the veggies at all; and there is not enough tang or heat in the sauce to make up for what it takes away from the roast.

This is a great recipe!  I followed the recipe except I did add 1 cup of beef broth, garlic and I deglazed the pan with wine after browning the beef as another reviewer suggested.  Will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe - new twist on the basic pot roast.  Cooked the sauce until reduced by about half which took about 10 minutes on medium high heat.  Enjoy this easy comfort food!

This is better the next day but not as flavorful as I'd hoped. Had to add salt to the plate and the sodium count is already pretty high. Definitely check a 3 lb roast at 10 hrs on low; cooked just right at that point, 12 hrs would have been way overdone. Will try again though with more seasoning.

This would be just as awesome covered with Kitchen Bouquet, on all sides, before baking. Get it in your local grocery store, in the condiment aisle.

I used the recipe and checked the meat at 6 and 1/2 hours of low cooking, but the meat was far from tender.  I would not make this again.

This is so easy, and so good!  Only changes I made were to use vegetable oil; a bit more than a cup of onion; seasoned the pot roast with salt and pepper prior to searing; and skipped adding the salt to the sauce.  Didn't have time to slow cook for 12 hours, so I cooked it on high for 2.5 hours, and then another 6 hours on low.  The flavor is wonderful, and it's even better as leftovers.

This was really good, meat was tender and delicious. I added more veggies like celery and mushrooms, as well as garlic, beef base, and some more seasonings. I also felt it was bit tomato-y, next time I plan on added less tomato sauce. Was a great base recipe to work off of!

This is nice change if your a looking for one when making pot roast and are tired of the traditional recipe. Season the meat though before browning it, as you always should.

I made it, but instead of tomato sauce, I used a can of tomato soup and 3/4 cup water and one can diced tomatoes plain. I also added 1 tbs minced dried garlic, and 1/2 sweet onion chopped. Then in last hour, thickened with 3 Tbs corn starch after blending until smooth in a little hot water. It was delicious, and my family raves about it...it‚Äôs will be a frequent flier in my home, with pork as well...

I prefer a bit more liquid, so I tried adding some chicken stock. Bad choice... changed the initial taste of the recipe, which I found delightful. Next time I'll just double the liquids.
I cooked this on high for nearly 7 hours. The meat fell apart, the veggies were excellent but there was no need to thicken the sauce; it was already thick and sticking to all the ingredients even after I added the chicken stock.
Definitely will be added to my rotation.

I am making it right as I type this, but made some changes. I doubled the sauce parts of the recipe since the sauce the recipe calls for is about 2 cups and very thick. Plus I added a can of crushed pineapple (including the juice) and also added a large red bell pepper chopped in large pieces. When it is done, will update this with a pic .

I made the slow cooker sweet/sour pot roast exactly as the recipe called for,  except I did not brown the roast - just put it atop the veggies as it came from the meat market.  I never did get the considerable liquid at the end of cooking to thicken - perhaps I was not patient enough. The sauce was good, more like a jus, but could have used a bit more zing to the flavor. I will make this again - next time with a whole chicken, since we are trying to eat less red meat - and will tinker a bit with the ingredients. Will read what others say here, and I am thinking a bit more vinegar, a bit less brown sugar.  Enjoy!

I made this in a pot on top of the stove instead of a slow cooker but it turned out great! Husband and son loved it and it was super easy!

Added a little Korean BBQ sauce and some Costco pineapple-habanero salsa. It was very tasty. Also used turnips for slow cooking portion and added small potatoes and mushrooms in the last hour.

Couldn't have been any simpler.  Only changes I made were that I didn't chop the carrots...I just cut them into 1-inch (+/-) pieces, and I added some celery cut the same way.

So good...my wife says this is even better than the pot roast she makes!  Definitely on the "keeper" list!

Best pot roast ever! I took the advice of some others and added minced garlic, seasoned salt, some dried basil , and garlic powder. Also, I had small(ish) red potatoes on hand that I peeled and quartered.  I didn't chop the onions but basically quartered them as well. I used about four med-large carrots which was plenty. Cooked on low and switched over to "warm" in the last few hours because I felt it was cooking ahead of schedule.  I combined a tsp. of cornstarch to a tsp. of water and added that to the sauce to thicken it a little. It all came out superbly. Will definitely make again!

This was probably the best pot roast I've ever made!  The ONLY two things I did differently was add 2 stalks of roughly chopped celery AND I cooked it in my 6 quart T Fal stovetop pressure cooker.  I browned the 3 pound roast, trimmed of excess fat, and deglazed with a half cup of beef broth.  I cooked it on high pressure, 15 pounds, for 1 hour and let it naturally depressurize for 20 minutes,  Other than that it was as the recipe dictates.  I forgot to add that I didn't cook potatoes with the roast as I prefer mashed potatoes.  It really was an EXCELLENT meal!!!!!!!!!!

Pretty good. Made it in my  electric pressure cooker...beef on high pressure for 10, then add veggies for another 10 on high pressure.  Used the quick release. Good flavor , tender and way faster.

Excellent!  The only change I made was to put the veggies in a foil packet at the bottom of the crock pot.    Many times when making such recipes everything in the pot tastes the same.  I like the veggies to stand out and not taste just like the roast.    Will make again!    I also sometimes use London Broil  if I have enough time to cook on low.   Very lean but has to cook a long time low and slow.    ANother reviewer mentioned "the cream of mushroom soup" - am I missing something or is that not in the original recipe??

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have any onions so I added onion soup mix to the sauce mixture before pouring it on the roast. Otherwise I followed the recipe and no problems. Will make this again.

I made this just as written.  I thought the sauce was bitter without much flavor.  The roast was tender and not overdone. The potatoes were cooked through.  The carrots and onions, in the bottom, were still crunchy.  I would not make this again and do not recommend it.

Awesome recipe!  I couldn't find small white potatoes at my store, so I used red instead.  I also used baby carrots.  I cooked on low for 10.5 hours and the meat fell apart.  My husband doesn't even like pot roast, but loved this.  I've shared with all my friends.  LOVE IT!

This tastes fabulous! It's my go-to recipe for pot roast. I use pearl onions instead of chopped onions. I love pot roast; my husband--not so much. He dislikes roasts that use a wine-based sauce. We meet in the middle with this one and we both rave about. And the kids gobble it up, even the veggies.

This was pretty good. Has a slightly different flavor than your standard pot roast. Isaac likes the tomato-based gravy. We reduced it on the stove for a pretty long time but ended up adding some thickener to it anyway.

Was just ok to me. Made it exactly as stated but felt the sauce could've used a little more kick. My roast also never got tender for some reason, even after 10 hours on low -- not sure if that was my fault or if it just wasn't a great cut of meat.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I skipped browning the meat in the skillet and substituted baby carrots to make it even easier!  I made it for Sunday supper, but assembled everything in the crock on Saturday evening, put in in the fridge and brought it out early Sunday morning for 2 hours to come to room temp and put it in the crock pot on high for 8 hours.  What could be easier?

I had a 2.5 lb. pot roast, used the same quantities  listed in the recipe and it turned out great!  Even my picky meat eater loved it!  We had an excellent amount of gravy and veggies with the smaller cut of meat.

This was great. I added 4 bay leaves. I used a 3 1/2 lb bottom round roast. Cooked on high 3 hours and low 3 hours. Doubled the sauce and served on white rice.

The sauce didn't thicken for me but oh well, it was delicious! Definitely my go-to recipe for pot roasts in the future.

Made as recipe called for and as another reviewer stated, my roast wasn't all that tender either. But that could be the butchers fault. The juices were awesome as were the vegetables. And those were even better the next day over buiscuts!

The trick is to cook the meat long and slow until it is falling apart. A bit of salt really brings out the flavors. I've made the 6 times!

This super!  This a easy recipe and the Kids even went back for seconds. Left overs added some BBQ sauce and made sandwiches with the veggies. Awesome.

Delicious!  I substituted 1/2 low sodium soy sauce and 1/2 teriyaki.  The sauce didn't thicken as instructed, so I added 1/4 c. water mixed with 1 tab. potato starch, and it worked perfectly.  Would try this recipe again, and again, and again!

Used a pork shoulder roast and did not do the browning step.  Added fresh thyme and 3 cloves of garlic, the sauce was thick enough so did not need to do the last step, very tasty dish.

I did like you're suppose to do when reviewing a recipe and made it exactly like the recipe called for. It was delicious. The gravy that it made was great. Colorful smelt wonderful and tasted even better. While it cooks there is plenty of time to make some yeast rolls. Nice change to the regular ole roast. Remember..... crock pot liner = no clean up :)

Delicious! I tried cooking it on high, carrots started burning and sauce was gone at about 1 1/2 hours.  Don't recommend high temp.  Made a second portion of sauce, added a little water and continued cooking on low.  Ate a little later but worthwhile and really delicious!!!

Great recipe!  Different from the usual pot roast recipes, but in a very good way.  Cooked for 6 hours on high and roast and veggy's came out perfect. Almost gone in one night!!  Going to make it again next week.

great recipe and oh so easy!  that's always my preference - delicious and easy!  to much hassle and i'll just go out to a restaurant!  this was great...my only confusion or suggestion was at the end.  the gravy really does not thicken in the skillet unless some cornstarch or flour is added as well.  i added 1 heaping tbs of cornstarch to a small amount of the broth in a separate container and then returned to the skillet and cooked it for about 5 minutes.

This was good, but when we made it into stew the second night it was fabulous! Had made gravy with the yummy tomato-ey juice, so added that the second night to the leftovers along with some stock. Everyone loved it - thanks for TWO great, easy dinners!

I cooked the roast in a Dutch oven using low (300 F) heat for about two hours. The meat was very tender, although, I think next time, I'll make it without the brown sugar and vinegar.
