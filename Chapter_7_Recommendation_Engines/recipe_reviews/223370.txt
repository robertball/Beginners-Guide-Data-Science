My whole family loved this...i added artichoke hearts, grape tomatoes and kale...it seems that it just fits no matter what you blend.

This needed just a tad more oil and vinegar in my opinion but other than that it was perfect as written! Neither me or the hubs are big on eggplant but loved it in this. It kinda dries out and gets a weird texture but it really absorbs the smokiness and is delicious. I grilled some red onions that I had on hand that needed used and they worked nicely in this too. Great recipe!

I put the veggies in a foil packet and put on the grill.  It was great!  Afterwards, I put the hot veggies on uncooked spinach leaves and topped it with Balsamic Vin. dressing.  It was really good!
