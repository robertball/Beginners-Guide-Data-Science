This is dish was wonderful.  I did however make some adjustments.  I actually used less peanut butter and less tomatoe paste.  I added some seasoning salt and a little bit of curry.  The dish was amazing.  I added water to the dish so that it would not be too thick.  overall after making adjustments the dish was excellent

Seems proportions mentioned in this recipe were not accurate. Following the directions made for a very dry and unpleasant texture and an overwhelming peanut-buttery taste. I was able to save the meal, though, by adding a can of diced tomatoes and the juice of 1 lemon to balance out the peanut butter.

The one star is given fors a nice idea for flavor combination.  Things went well until it was time to add the peanut butter.  It did not melt so much as start to scorch.  I turned the heat down even though this is not included in the directions.  Next was the tomato paste-it calls for 3/4 of a 6-ounce can. As I tried to combine the ingredients, I saw that they would not blend easily and it was a very thick paste which would just sit in top of the rice. I take full responsibility for the following: I tried to doctor it up with a little oil..then water, then it turned into this huge amount and the pb became lumpy and unappealing. A strange red oily substance began to separate from the sauce. I removed most of the "sauce" so there was a small amount on the tofu then added 1/2 tsp of chili powder for flavor and...Ketchup!  Ketchup is a miracle worker.  This recipe was a flavor/texture mess.

I used a pretty watery tomato paste and it came out perfectly. Just use common sense and add some water or broth if it seems to thick.  Also threw in a dash of cinnamon and a dash of cayenne pepper. Fabulous and the peanut buttery tomato texture was to die for!

I made this the other night and the taste just didn't do it for me, the paste was overpowering and there wasn't enough flavour from the garlic, on the bright side me my brother and his wife did eat it all.

This was pretty good, nice and quick and tasty.  Based on previous comments, I added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chicken broth, and a little rooster sauce for heat.  I'll definitely make this again.

Added thawed asian veggies, black and red pepper to the mix after the tofu had browned a bit. Also used diced tomatoes in can instead of paste and mashed a bit with peanut butter. Was really good!

Used the full amounts of tomato paste and peanut butter but added a cup of broth to the sauce. Also added chili powder and hot sauce.  It was good, might make again, but not mind blowing.

This is a good idea and I was excited about it, but I think it turned out only so-so, even with a lot of modifications.   For starters, I actually made it with a cup of plain tomato sauce rather than tomato paste (this was after reading other reviews that it was too dry without broth or water added).  I also added about 1/4 cup lemon juice to add some extra zest and moisture, but the peanut butter in the amount called for was still too overpowering.  I would definitely halve or even third the amount of peanut butter next time.  Also, I found the flavor to be pretty bland...it does need something else.  I added rooster sauce when I ate it and extra garlic and garlic salt, but still lacking.  I didn't really have any other Asian spices besides some chili garlic sauce which I also put in, but I think that would help if there were some additional spices.  I also added chopped bell peppers and chopped green cabbage that I simmered with the tofu and sauce and that helped a lot.  I considered adding canned tomatoes, (like other reviews mention) even a can of Rotel to the mix, but I was afraid of adding too many elements to the dish--now I'm thinking some Rotel would've helped perk it up a bit.  Weird recipe, but has potential--I'll maybe try this again.

This was a great way to make tofu, wonderful flavours. I added pineapple cubes to the tofu while it was frying and it was delicious! I think the pineapple gave it flavour it needed and I wouldn't have liked it as much without it. I will definitely make again with pineapple.

I needed a recipe I could make with ingredients I had on hand.  I found this one and I'm so glad I ignored the negative reviews.  My family is ambivalent about tofu and even they thought this was wonderful.  I followed the advice of decreasing the amount of peanut butter and adding a little water.  I stirred the PB, tomato paste and water in a bowl before adding it to the pan. I also added a few shakes of curry powder as latavaea suggested.  I will be making this again.

Google it. I just tried this. It was okay, but not as exciting as I expected. So I googled, and this is an abbreviated version of a more interesting dish that includes ginger, chickpeas, more onion and more moisture. I love peanut anything, so I took the basic concept and played with it. My preference was less tomato, but that's me. They suggested it with chicken instead, too, which is what I'll do with the extra sauce I have. I'm pushing it more toward middle eastern. One caution- garlic burns quickly, so work around that. I made the sauce first, then did the fofu and stirred it in. I also coated the tofu in corn starch before sauteing, to make it nice and crispy.

yum. i made it with a varied amount of tomato paste and peanut butter proly less. i've tried sesame, peanut, sunflour oil, touch of roasted sesame touch of red palm; all good . i like to add green beans 1 leaf of kale or chard.  at first i was adding  a little over 1/3 cup veg broth,crushed red pepper.. now use a little broth on some i leave in pan to add to rice. and i up the onion and add chili pepper, cayenne and some other wetter form of tomato such as roasted or fresh juicy. the peanut butter and tomato paste do melt ; mix together add salt at some point. i recommend this dish.
 maybe try i either  cinnamon bark or pineapple as suggested by others.
 wouldn't have thought of this. Had fun. thanks.

I read the reviews and decided to tweak it a little. I used Rotel canned tomatoes instead of tomato paste. Rinsing the can out with water and using 3/4 of the water in the dish. I used all-natural chunky peanut butter and added a Tb. of curry powder. I also cubed my tofu small like 1/2" x 1/2".  It was even better after it sat in  the fridge over night. My husband liked it, so it's a keeper!

the dish was good. I used brown rice instead of white as it is healthier. besides I did some modifications as I added some sweet corn to avoid that dry taste of tofu. since, my taste buds love spices, I added salt and red chilly powder in the end. I added 1 table spoon of peanut butter, which I think was less as that flavor was lost completely after spices and lemon, so I will advice to add lil more. The dish was very healthy combination and ya it was bit dry of course, but sweet corn really helped.. it was a fulfilling dish, small amount fills your tummy with loads of nutrition.

I made this recipe using almond butter instead of  peanut butter.  I made all of the changes that Latavea mentioned plus added cayenne pepper and some sesame oil.  I also added a 1 1/2 cups of what to help with the consistency.

I'd never cooked with tofu before, so didn't know what to do with it. This might have been an odd choice to start with, but it turned out pretty well. Interesting combination of flavors. It does need some spices and some extra liquid, as others have mentioned, and it looked awful, but it tasted good.

Such an odd combo...but it IS delish...I copied latavaeas ideas of cutting the tomato paste and pb down...however I used hunts red spicy pepper pasta sauce and used a little less than 1/2 a cup and the pb I used a table spoon and melted it in the microwave....CAREFUL my first melt job burned:(...I also used canola oil instead of peanut and added zuchini, mushrooms, eggplant and crushed walnuts...near the end it did become sticky so I added a little bit of H20 to lighten up and I sprinkled curry over it as well...

I read the reviews before I cooked the meal.  So i modified it with a cup of chicken broth (which i made from 1 bouillie cube and a cup of hot water).  But the key ingredient (which was written the a previous review) was some spices.  I put in some paprika and cumin and ground black pepper and this dish was amazing.  I also added more garlic (again someone said this in a review).  So I think someone should probably modify the recipe.  There were such mixed reviews and I was about to pass on cooking this, thinking i would waste my time and food, but the peanut butter ingredient really intrigued me.  So I tried it and i'm glad I did.   Definite give this one a go, but add those extra ingredients
