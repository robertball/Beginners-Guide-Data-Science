I liked this but to top it and add a little more sweetness i.made a simple syrup with lemon juice sugar and berries for the top. I would make it again. It is simple and quick and I had everything on hand.

Quick and easy to make. I had everything mixed and in the baking dish in 5 minutes. I found it bland and tart. Needed a bit more sweetness to balance the raspberries. Took an extra 12 minutes for the center to finally set. Thank you for the recipe but  I will more than likely not make this again.
