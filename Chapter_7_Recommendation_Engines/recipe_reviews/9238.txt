This dough resembled the kind I used to make at a restaurant.  I think they would have turned out better had I prepared them like we did there.  Next time I'll form the dough into roll sized pieces and place on a greased baking sheet in a warm moist oven.  I will also add a little more sugar and salt next time.  Acutally, I can't wait to make them again!!!

This recipe is great except it's missing one important step:  Let the rolls rise again on the baking sheet before you bake them.  I made a sheet of rolls and some "bubble bread" because it makes a lot of dough.  Both were great.

Very good recipe. I recieve compliments each time I make these rolls. I made a few adjustments.I add a tad more sugar and salt because my family said they were a lit bland the first time I tried them.

I substituted a small boiled mashed potato for the flakes and that worked just fine. Let it do a second rise in a warm oven. I also kneeded by hand for about 7-10 minutes. I noticed some of the other reviewers said it tasted biscuity that's probably because they under kneeded it. Mine was soft and chewy-great! I used it for bierochs and it was a perfect match.

I, like a lot of others who rated this, added a little more sugar and salt for flavor as well as letting them rise a 2nd time on the baking sheet before cooking them. The longer you let them rise the fluffier they will be...they turn out more like biscuits if you don't let them rise a 2nd time. My husband loved these and I've been attempting many recipes as of late, but this is the only one that came close to pleasing me as well as my family. Thanks for the recipe!!

I really liked this recipe. But, the last couple of times I've made it, the crust is really hard. Probably user error. I added more salt b/c I like more of a saltier taste than sweet. But excellent otherwise..

My husband thought these were store-bought rolls (coming from him, this is a good thing).  These had an odd texture to them that I have never had when baking bread--they weren't chewy, exactly, but kind of mealy, more like a biscuit (although these definitely tasted more like rolls than bixcuits).  I might try making these again, but I would add more salt to give them a little more flavor.  Also, like another reviewer noted, I think these would turn out better if, after the dough has risen the first time, they were formed into balls and allowed to rise again before baking.

excellent rolls.  I let them rise 30 minutes in the bowl and 30 minutes on the tray after shaping.  They were perfect

I made SO many recipes and this one was SUPER easy and great tasting.  Passed them around to my whole family, several households lol, and everyone loved them!  Thanks so much!  I did use highly active yeast and self rising flour so the dough would rise faster.  The results were awesome.  I found the crust to be just right, brown and perfect, except when I forgot to oil one of the muffin pans lol ;(

I made these for Thanksgiving, and this was my first shot at yeast rolls.  They were sooo good.  I made enough for breakfast the next day.  The second day, they were out of this world with a little butter and jelly.  The whole family loved them.  They were also easy to make.

These rolls were good when I first made them. Then I decided to freeze some of the dough, rolled into balls and placed on a cookie sheet and put into the freezer,for later.That didn't work.They never would rise as before, no matter how long they sat in a warm place. So they were not for me.

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted just as good. Should also make an excellent Pizza crust or garlic roll substitute. Thanks!

These are fairly simple to make, even if they are a little dirty dish intensive. Often time, I make these for supper. Main course. After the first rising, I wrap the dough around ham dill and sharp cheddar, brats, sausages, pepperoni and mozzarella with a dab of pizza sauce, or any other combo that strikes my fancy. I put them on a cookie sheet seam side up, let them rise again, and bake as directed. You end up with little sandwiches that are easy to grab and go to eat. Leftovers go in the fridge, and we nuke them for 20 seconds then toss them in the toaster oven for 2 minutes so they aren’t soggy. It is a very versatile dough that you can play with.

Tried this recipe for the first time ever yesterday and it came out perfect my family was surprised when I brought them out to the table. My husband arrived home from work and the first thing he said was I could smell them from the driveway when I walked down the carport to enter the doorway to the house I thought to myself that wonderful smell can't be comming from my home cause my wife dosen't know how to make bread/rolls. To his surprise and amazement it was our home he couldn't wait to eat dinner with hot yeast rolls, gravy, and for dessert homemade turnovers. I'm making another batch now because he is off tomorrow and will be asking for some with leftovers for lunch, not to mention my kids loved them also so this time I doubled the recipe to make 12 I hope they come out as good like the first ones did because the recipe is easy and fail proof anyone can do it if you just follow the simple and easy directions.

These were ok, but I was attempting to make something similar to the frozen Rhodes rolls you defrost and let rise, for Thanksgiving. These fell drastically short of those. I followed the recipe but added more salt. Taste and smell was good but the texture was off. I gave them a second rise once formed into balls. They weren't very fluffy or light, were a bit dry and almost stale tasting right from the oven. Strange. I'll try a new recipe.

These were very good rolls, I made them into small oval shapes and cut little slits on the top then after shaping them I let them rise again and baked to a beautiful golden brown... They went excellent with the homemade clam chowder I served tonight!

turned out well.  I used a potato dumpling mix instead of flakes, but it still turned out fine.  I have made better hot roll recipes, but this was pretty good!  It raised up nicely and I brushed them with butter.
