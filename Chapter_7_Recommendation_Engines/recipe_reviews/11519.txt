I am actually sitting here eating my new cookie and drinking a cup of tea.  It is delicious.  I agree that cutting them in squares is tedious so I rolled the dough out, put the sugar and cinnamon on and proceeded to make a roll just like cinnamom buns.  Them I cut them in slices and put four slices together.  I pinched the top half together a little and put them in my muffin pan. Next time I would use a little less flour in the dough to make it easier to roll out.

I wouldn't classify this as a cookie, more like mini-cinnamon buns.  Very yummy.

These taste good, like very cakey cinnamon rolls, but they aren't worth the effort --- too time-consuming for a result of only 12 cookies.  I'd rather just make real cinnamon rolls.

It's a lot of work for very few cookies, but definately worth the effort, specially if you really want to impress someone. I've made these cookies many times now.. they're amazing.

Delicious! I made the recipe as written and I was very happy with the result. It's just like a cinnamon roll but without having to wait for it to rise.

I agree with another reviewer. . . Not quite a cookie, but not quite a cinnamon roll either.  The concept was fun and the end product is good.  They came out a bit "floury" for my taste.  This could be due to a number of things.  Flour measurements are SO critical especially depending on HOW you measure.  All in all, the effort is worth it in the end.
