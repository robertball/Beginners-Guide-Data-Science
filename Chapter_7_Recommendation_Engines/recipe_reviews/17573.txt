All I can really say is this recipe is fantastic.  When a recipe is so good I can't make it enough and my husband asks to make it then you know it is good.  This recipe is so good that when I make it people take credit and say they made it beause of all the compliments that it gets.  This recipe is also easy to make, which my kids can attest to, at 8 (boy) and 3(girl) they both run to the kitchen when I say I'm making lemon cake.  There is no comparison for this moist, fluffy cake, once you've made it once you'll keep making it.  Just a little clue to that, I made this cake for the first time in August and have made approximately 25 since then.  Sometimes 3 cakes at one time.  People have told me to stop teasing them with pieces and start making whole cakes when I share with them.  Thanks again.

I only had a lemon cake mix, but it said it had pudding in the mix, so I followed the recipe as if it were already combined.  It turned out light and fluffy.  For the glaze, because so many said it was on the very sweet side, I squeezed enough for 1/2 cup of lemon juice, and added 2 tsp of stick butter for a smoothness.  The family has given this an "awesome" rating, and insisted on it all summer long as the "perfect light desert.  We had it the third night with crushed raspberries and a dollop of whipped cream for company, and the cake was still just perfect. Rave reviews from all.

Perfectly easy, fresh, lemony cake.  I topped it with a lemony whipped cream topping (4 oz cream cheese, 1 c. powdered sugar, 1 c. cool whip, the juice of one lemon and 1 tsp lemon zest).  We love lemon so I only use fresh squeezed lemon juice which I think makes a difference and I add a bit of lemon juice to the cake.

My family loves this cake.  My recipe is just slightly different.  Instead of lemon pudding mix, mine calls for dry lemon jello powder to be added to the batter.  #2 son always asks for this cake for his birthday.

yuuuummy, I will be making this this summer, however, I do plan on making it in a bundt cake pan and adding strawberries and blueberries to go over top of it. It's def. a summer dessert. very light and fluffy. another option is to use a lemon cake mix and a vanilla pudding!

I have made this many times, however I use lemon cake mix and 1 C of lemon juice. If you really like lemon use a full cup. Trust me it does not make it too soggy. Don't worry that the mix sizes don't match up with today's inflation, they work fine.I take this to pot lucks. It usually gets passed up until one person tries it ; within minutes it is gone. My most asked for recipe.

Just what I was looking for. I was craving lemon poppy seed cake. So I added 1/2 cup of poppy seeds and cooked it in 2 loaf pans. Definitely a do again and again!

Like the other reviewer, I used lemon cake with vanilla pudding (except I did mine on accident)-
and it turned out great. A tad on the "too sweet side," but delicious nontheless!

I made this cake for a big gathering this weekend. Maybe the recipe is missing something, I covered it with whipped cream as the appearance of all the holes poked into the cake didn't look very nice. It wasn't a big hit altho I LOVE lemon almost anything. Not sure if I'll make it again as there better lemon recipes. It was easy enough tho so maybe for a quick fix I might.

I baked in a bundt pan but otherwise followed all directions. It was like a cross between a lemon bar and pound cake. Hubby said it was just like he remembered his Nana making :)

So simple & so deliciously moist.  I tried other "from scratch" lemon cakes & they just weren't what I was looking for.  This is it.  Next time I will lower the temp to 325 for my dark non-stick pan & spread half the glaze before poking to encourage the glaze to seep into the cake then spread the rest of the glaze over the top.   I used a meat serving fork with two long tines to get nice clean, deep holes.  If you make even marks with the fork it's a beautiful end result.  A drizzle of blueberry or strawberry sauce &  dollop of whipped topping to make an outstanding dessert.   Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe.  I sometimes will use my bundt cake pan.  For the glaze I use 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup water (could use lemon/lime drink) and boil while cake is baking until it starts to thicken up a little.  When cake is done and has cooled slightly, loosen cake in pan and then pour the glaze mixture over the cake being sure that a lost of it goes down the sides of the pan.  Let this sit for 45-60 minutes so it has time to absorb glaze.  Turn it out on your cake plate.  Moist, great and delicious.

The cake was good, but I thought it needed more lemon flavor.  I'll try the suggestion to use lemon cake mix and vanilla pudding next time.

Very easy to make and worth it.  I didn't have any whipped topping but that would have topped it off even better.

LUSCIOUS!!! I did one thing a bit differentthis time. I used 1/2 the amount of lemon with fresh lemon.(didn't have enough of just juice) I have made this several times the original way and just loved the taste using fresh lemon!I think next time I will use all fresh lemon. It was so fresh tasting.

Easy cake to make and easy to bring to an event.  I added extra XXX sugar on top once it was cooled to make it look more attractive.

Sooo Lemony and sooo delicious!  I used the lemon cake and lemon pudding mix.  I also doubled the amount of glaze to go on top, and basically bathed it in glaze, letting it soak up into every inch of the cake!  It turned out amazingly tasty!

This was the easiest cake to make.  I couldn't believe how flavorful it was with so little effort.  My husband who always says everything is just ok even said it was good.  The proof was when he ate three pieces of it.  I will definitely be making this again.

I myself thought the cake was good-nothing exceptional though. No one ate one piece of it at a picnic-I believe because it looks terrible on top.  I tried to cover it up with 10X but the glaze soaks it up.  To put anything else on top would just take away from the simplicity of the recipe.

This cake only lasted about two days in our house.  I did not change a thing about the recipe and it turned out perfect. Very good, this is the only lemon cake recipe you need in your cookbook.

I knew I'd seen this recipe somewhere but with Key Lime Juice instead of lemon.  Used a Duncan Hines mix and a bunt pan. The Lemon Lime combo was wonderful...  If you like Key Lime Pie you would like substituting Lime for the Lemon...

Now, I usually don't like when people post reviews without adhering to the recipe as written, but I only made the cake (no glaze) and it was DIVINE. After butchering the cake from another recipe from this site, I only needed the actual cake with a recipe that included ingredients I already had (it was midnight of Thanksgiving!) and found this one. I baked it in two 9" rounds for 25 min and used it with the filling from the original recipe and Wilton's lemon buttercream frosting. . .the end result was amazing. I'm giving the five stars for the cake because 1.) It was fantastic and because 2.) it SAVED MY LIFE lol! I will definitely go back and try the recipe as written soon.  Thank you, MARBALET!

I spent the day trying different lemon cake recipes.  This one was the best.  I used a lemon cake mix instead of yellow & changed the 3/4 c. water to juice of one lemon plus enough water to make 3/4 c.  Yummy

I have made this cake dozens of times.  I don't like lemon cakes but this one is exceptional.  It is easy, tasty, and dangerously delicious.  This is one of my go to cakes when I am taking a cake  to an occasion.  I know that it will be easy enough to prepare on a weeknight, reliable enough not to fail, and tasty enough to please.  Thanks Marbalet.

This makes a nice, light-tasting, lemony cake that is less sweet than many cakes.  I think the amount of glaze could probably be cut in half -- it made far more glaze than was necessary.  Frosting lovers (like my family) might prefer this cake with a lemon frosting.

I didn't get to try this, but I gave it 5 stars because of the reviews I got.  I added a few drops of yellow food coloring to my cake and glaze.  I topped it with Cool Whip.

This is a great recipe that I will make again and again! For a lower fat version, I used applesauce in place of the oil and 1 cup egg substitute for the eggs and it turned out just as good.

I did make some changes do to necessity...didn't have lemon pudding so used cheesecake pudding. I thawed the lemon juice from my freezer and it came to 3/4 cup, soooo I used  about a 1/3 cup for the glazed and added  the rest to the water amount for the cake.  Father's Day was soon so it became hubby's cake cause he  LOVES lemon.  HE LOVED THE CAKE!!  Out of a 9x13 inch pan I got 2 slices...enough said.  Great Recipe!

Been making this for years. I use lemon cake mix and lemon instant pudding. And use lemon juice in glaze. I’m a pastor’ wife and this is always requested. My husband’s grandma used to make a similar one   It’s up to me to carry it on. It’s fast you don’t have to cool the cake to frost

Excellent recipe...I made this for a family dinner and it was a big hit.   My only suggestion is to follow the cake mix directions for the cooking time.

My son loves lemon not too sweet.  I used lemon cake and pudding. Made it in a bunt pan.  I did not poke instead I let the cake cool some and drizzled  I made a few candied lemons for decoration.  He does not like frosting!  It was not stunning just simple   He loved the cake it was moist.

I have made this three times now. Everyone loves it. I bake it in two 8X8 glass pans so I can share on with friends and my husband gets the second one. His favorite (even over my yummy brownies). I make it with lemon cake mix and lemon pudding & add fresh lemon zest to the glaze. We love the extra lemon taste.

I made this since it was the easiest Lemon Poke cake I could find for a hot afternoon. Super easy, not overly special, but extremely delicious. I'm using the base to create a banana version, and can't WAIT!

We LOVE this cake!  It's so lemony and moist.  Has anyone put frosting on top of the glaze?  I'm making it for a birthday soon and am nervous about putting buttercream on top.  It's already so moist.  Maybe just whipped cream?  Decorating suggestions...?

I have been making a lemon poke cake for years (my mother's recipe), and she made it for even more years prior to me; however, due to a recent move I couldn't use her recipe since it is in storage. So I turned to Allrecipes for help. Although the texture is different, this recipe definitely helped in a pinch. 

I made a couple of changes: 1) I added a little bit of lemon extract to the batter before mixing, and 2) I mixed the batter for 10 full minutes which helps with the height of the cake.

What a wonderful moist cake! Made as stated, but used only 1 cup icing sugar in the last part, as I like it tart. Excellent results, and even better the next day if I am the one slicing the cake!!
Thanks, and this is a wonderful addition to my lemon recipe box.

I just took this out of the oven.  After reading the reviews I made the following changes.  

I used lemon cake mix and lemon pudding mix in a large cast iron pan 32 minutes at 350.  For the glaze I used zest of one lemon, 1/3 lemon juice and 1 cup of confectioners sugar.  My Hubby prefers icing so I made a lemon cream cheese icing using.  It was super moist.  I'd definitely make it again

I have made this cake many times with just 2 variations: I bake it in a bundt pan for easier slicing, and  I mix Cool Whip with cream cheese and top the cake with that and then sprinkle lemon zest on top. Then I make sure that I chill the cake well before serving. I just took it to a potluck this afternoon. As soon as I set it on the dessert table, someone sliced into it, and before I knew it I had people coming up to me and saying that your cake is absolutely delicious! When I went back to the table a while later there were maybe two slices left. Success! I would have liked to have garnished with some fresh berries, but I used the last of them for breakfast cereal. Next time I will.

350 for forty five minutes even on a top shelf of the oven made the cake burn on the sides and top and as still loose in the middle.

My mom has made this recipe for many years now. She always has people asking her for the recipe. I have always requested this for my birthday cake. Now, I am making my own since I have been missing it. 

You most definitely have to love lemon  and be able to handle a very sweet cake.  I do and I can so I LOVE this cake. 

There is another variation on this cake using lemon Jello and it is also yummy.

I had been looking a long time for a recipe like this. It was a cake we had occasionally while I was growing up. This is a very good recipe, however, not quite up to my childhood cake which was a 5-star rating.

It only took 28 minutes to bake in my oven, so keep an eye on it. The glaze tastes very artificial; so much so that I didn't use it. I ended up just frosting the cake with a lemon cheesecake frosting. Will not make again.

Great recipe. My only change was to add 2 tablespoons lemon juice to the cake mixture. I think that helped keep it from being too sweet. Also, I remember having a lemon jello poke cake as a child. This is much better using pudding instead of the jello.

Great cake! The only thing different from my mothers recipe is to dissolve a pkg. of lemon jello in the 3/4 cup of boiling water, cool it and use it with the rest of the ingredients in the recipe. And add some lemon zest. It's really lemony and sooo good.

Followed exactly.  We loved it and so easy!!!  The cake looks kind of boring because of no frosting but the taste was super.

I used lemon cake mix, lemon pudding and lemon juice in the glaze and I can't say that it had the lemon flavor I was hoping for.

Have been making this cake for years. I use lemon cake mix and lemon instant pudding or lemon jello. I actually prefer it with the lemon jello but my family likes it either way.

I have been making this cake for many many years, but I also use the dry lemon jello instead of pudding.  It is so refreshing and tangy.  Even though I'm a chocolate person, this is still one of my all-time favorites.

Absolutely enjoyed making this cake and I was able to share it with our new neighbors! It tastes delicious with vanilla ice cream, blueberries, strawberries or any other type of fruit you might like. I loved the glaze that was placed on top and everything was so easy to follow. I used instant vanilla pudding mix and it still turned out delicious.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I followed it exactly. It was good, but I think next tie I will make larger holes and double the icing for our tastes. 4 stars on this one as it is a good recipe, just needs a little tweeking.

BIG FANS!!  I couldn't find lemon pudding mix, so I switched it up - used lemon cake mix and vanilla pudding. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The glaze ended up thicker than I thought it would, so whatever didn't seep into the "pokes", I re-spooned over the cake. It was delicious. The cake didn't last the night!!

Delicious cake...raves from everyone!  Made this for the first time for my husband's birthday and he, along with the rest of the family said it was the best cake they had ever tasted!  Quite  a compliment considering I haven't baked much.  Only change I made was the recommendation from others to use lemon cake mix instead of yellow.  Tangy and moist and fabulous!

This cake is so tangy and delicious!!  A big success with family and friends.  I used 3 eggs instead of 4 and also used lemon juice instead of water in the cake.  I also added some lemon zest to the glaze.  My cake was not soggy as some reviews indicated.  I will make this again and again (a great way to use the lemons from my backyard.)

This is a quick easy, light cake. We liked the glaze, kinda like a glazed donut. This does taste like a mix, which it is. I used lemon cake mix. Yes, I would make it again. I might dust the top with some powdered sugar next time once the glaze and cake are completely cooled. Also would like to put some fresh lemon juice into the batter.

I enjoyed this cake. I liked the tartness of the glaze. My son thought it was too tart. I ran into one problem, but that was my own fault. I bought the cake with the pudding already in it. I didn't want it to taste like yellow cake only, so I add the box of lemon pudding, and then I add some lemon juice to loosen the batter up, because it got sticky. I've made cakes before, so I was able to tell consistency. I baked my in a loaf pan, and it came out great. It looked good on the inside and out. It was light, and lemony. I had a thin glaze over the top to soak into the holes, then I used more confectioners sugar to add a white drizzle look, that covered the holes. I used a tooth pick to prick holes into the cake, that way they were not craters. I will definitely make this again.

This cake was YUMMY! I made some minor changes to the recipe: I had lemon cake mix on hand, so i used that with vanilla pudding mix (instead of the reverse); i used egg beaters instead of eggs; i added 2 tablespoons of water to the glaze, to stretch it out a bit. Anyway, it came out delicious! My friends all LOVED it!

This is a WONDERFUL cake.  Very easy, very moist, very flavorful.  I accidentally purchased lemon flavored cake mix rather than yellow but it was great.  No reason for me to even try it with yellow now.  I took it to work and it was a great hit.  As soon as you uncover the pan you can smell the lemon.

This recipe was very easy to make! The cake was moist and delicious!  I plan on making two more this week - one for home and one for work!
