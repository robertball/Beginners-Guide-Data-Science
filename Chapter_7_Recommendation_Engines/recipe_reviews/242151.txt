The spices are way too much for the 3 eggs called for in the recipe, and it looks nothing like the picture.  It turned out green/gray with all the parsley and pepper, and tasted like i just liked a creamy spoonful of pepper.  Maybe it's supposed to be for a dozen eggs?

I have made this a few times and after the first time it is clear that the amount of the ingredients is wrong. 2 Tbs of parsley flakes is WAY TOO MUCH for 3 eggs. I changed it to 2 tea spoons and put less of both salt and pepper. Turned out way better!

This was very tasty, but I did feel that 3 tablespoons of fat was a bit much, so I halved it and it was still very creamy & rich.  I definitely will make this again!

Try a tablespoon of heavy cream per egg and beat with a whisk just until the egg is blended well.  I like thinly sliced green onion blades and minced jalapeno for flavor enhancement.  When I have leftover boiled crawfish tails I add a generous amount to blast the taste into outer space.

Very good.  I eliminated the salt and it was still just fine!
