So yummy!  Just served tonight and it was really good.  We didn't have fish sauce so I used Worcestershire Sauce and it was great!

I made these pork chops last night as a change from our usual grilled pork chop recipe. They were a success. My husband and I especially enjoyed the sticky sauce which was the perfect blend of sweet, salt, and heat. We aren't huge fans of this type of Asian cuisine but truly were happy with the results. I followed the recipe exactly however next time, I will add some minced fresh ginger. I served with Rice Ah Roni, a recipe also from Chef John, and some snow peas.

This was my first time making and eating a pork chop, and i am in love! I love you chef john, I wish you had a cook book! I'm making these again soon! I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled everything and blended the sauce a bit because the minced garlic wasn't minced enough for me...  The sauce is heaven, the cook times were very helpful and the meat came out perfectly cooked and tender.

Instead of 1/3 cup brown sugar I used a 1/2 cup

Very Good. I depend on getting my recipe from Allrecipe as well as watching YouTube TV Chef John.. I recently got married and the man I married went to culinary school so he thinks outside the box. What a challenge. So intimating . So thanks to this web site I am doing ok.
PS My husband loved this recipe

This was absolutely the bomb, I made it with Tapatio instead of Sriracha and used a little extra because I like my food spicy, but the sauce still had plenty of sweetness.  Will definitely make this again!

This one is a keeper, as are  so many from Chef John.

I really liked the way the pork chops are finished after the sauce is thickened as iit is very easy to control the level of doneness using a thermometer.  This makes it very easy to monitor the internal temp with a thermometer and serve the chops right when they just cooked enough.

I had about half a head of garlic and ended up using the whole thing.  We have never had anything with too much garlic in our house.  

A rubber spatula was really useful in getting most of the marinade and garlic bits off the chops before the initial frying which reduced the risk of burning the garlic which gives things a terrible taste.

I bought one of those garlic smashing gizmos from Amazon that lets  you break the cloves into little pellet shaped hunks.  Its much easier than chopping the garlic and much easier to clean than a garlic press.

These pork chops are incredible! I followed Chef John’s recipe/instructions perfectly and they had an amazing texture and flavor to them. My only critique is that I didn’t get much heat from them, so next time I’ll likely double the Sriracha and/or add some cayenne (which he does mention as being an option). I will absolutely be making this dish many, many more times to come.

Awesome - very flavorful.  Did use small pork chops and cooked just two minutes on each side.  Boiled the sticky sauce down in a separate pan.  Will definitely make again.

The first taste of the sauce while it was reducing, well, let's just say chops were all I had on my plate.

Will be trying this with chicken this weekend. But, will be using the oven rather than stovetop. I imagine the result will be no less spectacular than with the chops.

The sauce was quite nice. I poured it on rice and it was very good.  My husband liked it a lot. But it wasn't over the top,  which is why I gave it only four stars.

Very tasty. I will be trying the sauce on chicken breast next time. The pork chops were very moist and flavorful so I look forward to trying it on chicken

We eat very little pork or beef, so I made this with some bone in chicken breast and thighs. To paraphrase Emeril, it was so good you could put it on a VW bumper and it would still taste good.

This sauce is delicious!  I also substituted worcestershire sauce for the fish sauce....if my husband saw, smelled or looked at fish sauce it would be all over! I believe you could also use white wine vinegar instead of the rice vinegar. 
It will be serviced again!

Another Chef John winner! I did cut the hot sauce down to one teaspoon, but  I do think I'll use the 2 next time around. That was the only variation and it came out wonderful. I thickened the sauce for 5 min but probably will add a minute next time for a bit more thickness.

I had pork chops and needed a recipe.  Ran across this one.  I had everything but the fish sauce.  I considered leaving that out, but decided to make a run for it.  Delicious!  Flavor of the sauce was intense which is what we need around here.  Will make again.

Incredibly good! I was surprised at how yummy these are. The marinade did not smell that tempting to me but when the cooking was finished and the marinade reduced and bubbled in the pan, no one could get enough. I only had this sliced pork chops so I was worried the flavor would be compromised. Not at all! Now I am going to try with thick chops. Everyone loved these. A big hit!

Listen to Chef John--and you can't go wrong!  This recipe works heavenly with pork AND CHICKEN!! No fish sauce??? No problem--sub with Worcestershire sauce and everything's fine. I tripled the sauce ( wise call )and divided some for generous dipping!!  I tried including orange zest ( and juice ) with pork--worked beautifully; lemon zest/juice is perfect with chicken.

Sauce was a bit sweet for me. Maybe needed 
less sugar and more hotsauce. Otherwise easy and will probably try again. Thanks!

Big success!   I followed the recipe to the letter, however I thought I was thawing out pork chops, but when I opened the butcher paper, it was pork shoulder, no bones.   I also ran out of time and ended up marinating the 3 lbs of pork for 24 hours.  Still amazing!    This is the tastiest pork I have EVER prepared!!    So happy was I, that I took a pic! (Ignore those horrific frozen peas-ugh)   Thanks Chef John, for the awesome recipe !!

This was really good.  However it took longer than six min to cook the sauce down and it didn't get "sticky" really...but it was good!

This was very good. The sauce, I think, would be great on chicken wings and other meat. The pork chops were tender and moist. This was a winner in my house!

These pork chops were easy to make and tasted awesome. Just be aware the you need to marinate them 1-2 hours so plan it when you have the lead time. But cooking them was all done in the frying pan. Very simple. I love garlic so added a little extra and went easy on the hot sauce. Served them with rice and broccoli. Delicious!!! Will definitely make them again.

This is another good recipe from Chef John.  The sauce is a sweet and very tangy compliment to the pork.  Even with seven cloves of garlic, I felt that the garlic was slightly over powered by the vinegar and fish sauce.  So, I was hoping for more garlic flavor, but it was still very good.  Next time I might adjust the other ingredients slightly to try to balance it with the garlic.  I recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a new twist on pork chops.

Made these with boneless butterfly pork chops and they were amazing.  Served it with brown rice cooked with chicken broth and steamed broccoli.  Rave reviews all around.

Loved, loved, loved this!  And so did my family.  SCORE!  That's rare, LOL.  I have a family of 5, so I used 5 chops.  They wanted seconds, but there were none.  After I marinated the chops and started heating up the marinade, I realized there just wasn’t enough sauce, so I doubled the recipe.  In the beginning I used a few shakes of garlic powder instead of minced garlic, but ended up using minced garlic when I doubled it.  I didn’t have fish sauce, so I added a little bit of water.  I use Tabasco for the hot sauce, but you could use something else.  I did have rice vinegar, but you could definitely use white or apple cider vinegar.  I cooked the chops on my Cuisinart press-type grill and then transferred them to the pan with the sauce once cooked.  Yum-O!
