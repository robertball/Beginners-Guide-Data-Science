my husband and i really liked this. i did make some changes though.... first, i used a pre-made brownie mix, and needed to use more graham crackers on the bottom because the amount called for didnt cover the bottom of my 9 x 13 pan. i also added the marshmallows about halfway through my baking time (which was fantastic because the marshmallows browned on top & made them more smores like, in my opinion) & i waited until the last few minutes to add the chocolate and broken graham crackers. the only problem i had cutting them was with the fact that the marshmallows can be a bit sticky, but if you take your time cutting they come out just fine!

I have made these 5 times so far and they have been one of the first deserts on the table to be finished, everyone loves them and they have become the unofficial brownie of our Girl Scout troupe.

I second running them under the broiler for 30 seconds or so to finish them off with a nice carmelization. If you want them to have a smooth top, you will need to do that yourself, but I like the "natural" look you get without smoothing them.

I also substituted chocolate chips for the pieces, they seem to fit better with the mini marshmallows.

As to the cutting problem mentioned, just let them cool completely (a couple of hours) and there is no problem cutting them.

A nice tribute to the campfire favorite.  Served them at a bonfire party and turned several s'more-haters into converts.  Smoothed the marshmallow layer out after 2min. baking, and then put under the broiler for 1min. to create the "toasted" effect.  Topped with graham crackers and Ghiradelli chocolate pieces.

These brownies are exceptional and very fast to prepare (don't let the somewhat tricky directions fool you). The only difficult part is that the brownie batter is very thick because there are 3 eggs versus any oil in the mixture which results a spreadable mixture as opposed to pourable. Thus, it is messy to spread the mixture onto the graham crackers without moving them around. Other than that, no problems with this recipe!  The presentation is lovely and receives many rave reviews.   The taste? A campfire S'more, straight from your childhood!

I wonder if you used a graham cracker crust for the bottom (crushed grahams mixed with butter and a little sugar and pressed into pan) if they would be even better because the grahams would be crispier???

I've made these for my son's birthday the past two years.  This is so rich - it's definitely a special occasion dessert.  You won't be able to go back to brownies from a mix after these.

They were pretty good and very well liked at the neighbor cookout that I made them for.  They were a little bit hard to cut for serving due to the gooey marshmallows and melted chocolate but they tasted amazing!

A fairly easy brownie to make, but tastes more complicated and who doesn't love s'mores!  I've been testing recipes for a brownie bake-off, this was my first try and I think the one I'll submit.    My co-workers and friends all loved it.

I don't really bake- I wouldn't call this recipe "easy" but it wasn't hard either.  I forgot to grease the tinfoil and they still peeled off very easily.  It was also much less clean up with the tinfoil.  They were very yummy- several people asked me for the recipe at the BBQ I brought them to.  It was nice to have something different.

These are sooooo good! I didn't have unsweetened BAKERS, so I used the semisweet I had and a tad less sugar.  I also used more crackers on the bottom and crumbled the ones on top to almost crumb size and used chocolate chips.  I cooked three minutes less because I like really gooey brownies.  LOVE them!
