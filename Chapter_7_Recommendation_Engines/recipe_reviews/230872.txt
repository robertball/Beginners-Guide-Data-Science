I love this as a garlic bread spread. I use my own homemade onion soup mix (I use half of what the recipe calls for, for us, it's too strong otherwise) and mayonnaise instead of sour cream. I just spread this on italian bread, sprinkle over the top with parmesan cheese then wrap in foil and bake at 350* for 10-15 minutes. It's heaven.

Something was way off on this recipe.  I made it exaclty as written plus the bit of sour cream and it was SO salty and way too intense.  This would be perfect if you add one more block of cream cheese OR 8 oz of sour cream. But as it stands it is unpalatable.

Delicious! I used it as a garlic spread one day and a dip the next, both times were well received by family! I did go wit mayo instead of sour cream since that's what I had on hand. Really yummy!! Btw, those crackers are Trader Joe's Raisin / Rosemary cracker, our newest favorite addiction:)

No. Bland and VERY salty, and an unappetizing brown from the onion soup. Ick. I’ll try it as a spread as another reviewer mentioned, but I don’t have huge hopes. I wish I was enough of a cook to know what to do to save this. It’s like...almost.

I like to add an onion, chopped...but not too small, fry it lightly to soften..then leave it on paper towel to dry off all oils....add this to dip - amazing!

Excellent! Did add a bit of sour cream to spread easier, and peeled 1 tomato and chopped it in from the garden.
I use Goodman's Low Sodium Onion Soup Packet.
