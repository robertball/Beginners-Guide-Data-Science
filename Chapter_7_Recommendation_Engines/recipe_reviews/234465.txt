Cute idea but could not get icing to stay on..it slid right off because of the cooking spray I guess or something...I don't know...so my son ended up with just two toned jello shooters for his Halloween party...kinda disappointing

I thought these looked better than they tasted. I could not get the icing to stay on either, so I used small pieces of black licorice to make the eyes and I skipped the mouth. Cute, but I doubt I'll make them again.
