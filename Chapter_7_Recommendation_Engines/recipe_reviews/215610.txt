I followed the recipe exact, only stopping at the gravy directions because I made my own gravy. I used dried seasonings only because that's all I had so I adjusted the recipe to reflect that. (Thank goodness for Google!) I also used my own chicken stock. This was a cinch and produced a moist, very flavorful turkey!

This was the first year I cooked a turkey - and this was a *huge* hit! I forgot to use oregano (going from memory); used butter instead of olive oil, and did not use broth in the roasting pan. it was still super moist and flavorful. We looked forward to leftovers for days!

This is an excellent recipe.  The only thing I would do different is to bag the turkey before roasting.  I used fresh herbs with some poultry seasoning.  Turkey was very moist.  Brining is the way to go.

This is a great Turkey recipie. The whole family loved it. I picked this recipie because it came closest to a recipie that I used to have and lost. It was not as good as the one I had before was, but it was still excellent. I will be making this Turkey again for future family events in which a Turkey is needed or wanted!

The herb rub is wonderful and adds a lot of flavor but I gave it 4 stars because I added a couple more ingredients to the mix.  First I added more of the herbs than what the recipe calls for and I also added fresh minced garlic, and 1/3 stick of butter mixed with the olive oil.  Mixed all the ingredients together and then proceeded to season the bird.  I always go under the skin and add seasoning there as well.   Added a chopped orange in the cavity with the stuffing.   With these additions, it has a 5 star rating.   Delicious gravy too!
