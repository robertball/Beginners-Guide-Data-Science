I really liked this recipe and i would recommend this, with a few tweaks. I chopped about 1 cup of pecans in the food processor and mixed it into the crisp mix. I also would omit the water and lemon juice because it tends to make it watery on the bottom, because the apples make their own juice, especially with the honey. Along with the cinnamon, i also sprinkled 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and allspice to spice things up a little bit. Served hot with ice cream, this is one rockin' dessert. Think i'll get me another scoop while i am thinking about it.......

This was extremly yummy! For the people who say it was gooey and sticky my advice is that when you mix the flour etc to create the texture of breadcrumbs, make sure you've washed your hands in cold water so the butter does not melt when you are mixing it!

This was pretty good. I really liked the crunch of oats, so I'd add more next time. It also needed more cinnamon, so I upped to a tablespoon. For a recipe with no sugar added, this was a little too sweet for me, so I'd cut down on the honey.

My husband really liked this even though I thought it was just a little too sweet. Next time I'll try adding walnuts to the topping. It seemed runny at first, but after cooling off it thickened a bit.

This was very good. I loved the honey, but I used just 1/4 cup of honey and it was plenty sweet. The topping was a little dry so I would add a little more butter next time.

I thought this was very good, but I think it would have just as good w/out the honey.  Also I had to add more butter to the crumbly top before baking as it wasn't crumbly enuff.  For an extra treat, I put craisins on the top before I baked it! Thank you for the fast recipe!

This was good, I really like the flavor of the honey.  Next time I might double the crust, but that is my only suggestion!  Thanks for the great recipe!

As a beekeeper I'm always looking for recipes that use honey.  This one is great!  It is easy to make and everyone has raved about it.  I mixed a bunch of different types of apples together since I had a few left over from our last apple-orchard visit.  Serve warm with a scoop of ice cream and you've got a winning dessert.

Who doesn't love crisp?  Followed advice of fellow reviewers and omitted water and added only 1/4 cup honey. Used vegan butter and substituted 1/4 c date sugar for brown sugar. Used macintosh apples and sliced very thin. Also added 1 tbs butter to dot the top of the crisp. Will be making this again!!

This recipe turned out wonderfully! I used three different types of apples for variety and added more oats and sprinkled some apple pie spice also. The honey really goes nicely with the apples! Thanks for a great recipe!

I couldn't get the coarseness of the crumbs right. I tried compensating by putting more butter and honey over the top - but that just made it gooey. Not sure what I needed to do but this didn't mix up right.

Easy recipe but far too sweet. The honey is overwhelming. Too much liquid as well. Half the honey and cut out the water (squirt a bit of lemon on the apples and toss) and this recipe is top notch

Quick & Easy!  I also omitted the water and used less honey.  Added wheat germ to the top before baking.  Delicious!  Will make again.

This was absolutely wonderful. I omitted the lemon juice and added a 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder for the topping and baked it for almost an hour. My boyfriend and I were very pleased with the results. I'll definitely make this again!

This a very good recipe as it was easy for me to adapt to our diet. I used whole wheat flour vs. all purpose, Splenda/brown sugar mix, and Smart Balance instead of butter. It was DELICIOUS!!!! I make it at least twice a week for dessert!

Very very good.   I took others advice and omitted the lemon juice and water and it was a good consistency without them.  Only changes I would make next time would be to use a little less honey as it was very sweet.

I also baked for longer...45 mins. I also used McIntosh apples. They cook down nicely.

This was good...a little sweeter than I like but still was gone in no time. I left out the water/lemon juice and had no problems. The other thing I would change is to add more butter to the topping mix. It was a little dry with only 4 TB of butter. Will make again for sure!

This is one amazing(and simple)apple crisp! I didn't read any of the reviews before making, but I usually do and wish i had for this recipe.  The water and lemon may have been too much, as it was a little watery at the bottom of baking dish, so you may want to omit or half it. If you are a fan of the crispy crust, then I would suggest adding an entire stick of butter vs. half because that's where the crispness comes from...but it was delicious regardless. Try it out as I don't think you'll be disappointed:)

Delicious! We really enjoyed it. I added twice as much oats, but didn't increase the butter. It probably would have been a little more "crisp" if I had done so, but it was still really good.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I've made it numerous times and it seems to just disappear.  I use Macintosh apples, double the topping except for the flour, and cook for about 50 minutes.

Made this last night. I doubled the topping because we love it. I also had to use a 9x13 pan because a smaller one just wouldn't do. I baked it about 8 additional minutes as well since it was larger then I thought it would be. It tasted ok but the lemon juice gave it a funny taste to us. Good recipe overall we just won't do the lemon juice next time.

Very easy recipe! One change I would recommend.....cut down on the sweetness by cutting down on the honey. Otherwise, a definite keeper on my list.

Don't make this too hard!  Use a CAN OF APPLE PIE FILLING!  Omit lemon juice, and follow all other steps exactly.  PERFECT!!  I drizzled another 4 Tablespoons of melted butter over top since it didn't look "crumbly" enough.  I could eat the whole thing myself!

I used a bit more butter than the recipe called for, and eyeballed the apples, honey and cinnamon. over all it was great, and easy. only peeling and coring the apples took any effort or time.

I love this recipe!!!  I always have so many apples from my organic co-op and this is so easy.  I did change a few things.  I used whole wheat flour and left the peels on the apples.

The perfect family pleaser! I followed th recipe as directed, though mixed cinnamon w/apples, then added chopped candied walnuts to the topping. I served this with lite vanilla ice cream. There was none left afterwards!

Oh my this is wonderful! Make sure you slice your apple thin so that they get good and tender. The only change I would make is to double the amount of butter so that the topping is not so dry. Otherwise it is   fantastic! Thanks for posting :)

We lost our regular recipe for apple crisp to the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina, but I found this one.  It's so easy - my 5-year-old daughter loved that she "made" it herself.  We realized that we did not have rolled oats on hand, so we substituted crushed Special K cereal, and it was still great.  We will make this again. Thanks!

I made this for Rosh Hashanah. Good concept but way too sweet. I would use a 1/4 the honey called for and 1/2 the brown sugar.

This was very good. I thought the topping a little dry so I added more butter and it turned out wonderfully. My family ate this all in 2 days, I only got a little bit. I will definitely make it again.

I don't think I made this right because the topping was not crispy at all.  The whole thing looked soggy.  It didn't look too good, but it dd taste really good, especially topped with vanilla ice cream.  I added some nutmeg and cut out the water.  Maybe my pan was too deep??

Quickest apple crisp recipe I have found!  Omitted the lemon and water as suggested.  I love using honey instead of sugar and corn starch to mix with the apples.  This recipe also allows me to use all-natural, organic ingredients without too much hassle - thank you!!!

It was awesome, my family of 5 ate the whole thing in one night! We used apples that stayed a bit crunchy for the 25 minute baking time, and I doubled the topping ingredients using 1 stick of unsalted butter which yielded plenty of crunchy topping. The honey was a very nice addition!!

I was not impressed with this recipe. I have had many better crisps in my life. I used Granny Smith apples, and they were still a little crunchy after the 25 minute baking time. If I do use this recipe again, I will try Golden Delicious apples, instead. I will probably just look around for a better recipe.

I've never really made this before so I was a bit apprehensive at first. To simplify the peeling process I used a vegetable peeler and an apple slicer, that was a huge help. The dough didn't work very well and when I took it out of the oven it was still  not completely baked but it turned out well in the end.

this is a very yummy and easy apple crisp, i really liked the added touch of honey..however I did not add the oats, because I didnt have any on hand, and it was still delicious!

This recipe is wonderful.  I love honey, so I added a little more than what the recipe called for, but it was great.

I thought this recipe was awful! The topping had almost no flavor at all. I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting butter with margarine.

This recipe is amazing!  No too sweet and easy to make.  The only thing I altered was the baking time - I baked it for considerably longer then suggested, until it was bubbling.   I have already made it twice and plan to make many more times.

This is the best apple crisp recipe I've found.  My husband, who doesn't even like baked fruit at all, liked this recipe. Granny Smith apples are really good with this recipe because of the combination with the tartness in the apple and sweetness of the honey.  It's delicious!

The apple crisp tasted fantastic.  It was on the sweet side and it wasn't crispy, but I would definitely make this again.

This apple crisp tastes unbelievable!  What a perfect fall dessert.  One note: I baked the crisp for almost twice the time directed.

I agree with raisinwoman.  This was a doughy mess.  I couldn't even salvage it with ice-cream. I followed the directions exactly. Unlike her, I don't think  I will try it again.

I have tried this twice now and both times ended up with a gooey doughy mess.  I thought I must have done something wrong the first time & so tried it again with the same result.  I don't really know how I could ruin an easy recipe like this, but I guess I managed it.  Even the 4-year old I was making it with wouldn't eat it.  Hmmmmmm.
