This recipe was good. I love really sweet stuff, however, this was too much! Next time I will add more coconut to balance out the sugar mixture.

These were fast and easy to make, but very sweet. I would use unsweetened coconut next time, but I would probably make them again. I also quartered the recipe, and still got 12 balls, so yield is really a lot more than stated.
I tried a version with soymilk, and they were just as good. A great coconut "macaroon-type" alternative for my milk/egg allergic kiddo.

This recipe is a real winner!  I made it on a rainy day, and the candies still set up beautifully and tasted great.  A great addition to Christmas gift baskets, especially for coconut lovers.

I double the recipe to make as Christmas gifts this year, based on all the good reviews. I boiled and boiled the milk and sugar with a candy thermometer for about 20 minutes and the temp never reached the 240 mark.  I finally gave up and poured it out on 2 cookie sheets, hoping it would set and I could cut into bars.  Of course, they never really solidified, so I added some mini-choc chips, poured it into jars and called it "Coconut Ice Cream Topping".  LOL

This recipe is a life saver. My 2-year old granddaughter has severe allergies to dairy, egg, and peanuts. There are not too many chewy recipes available. I substituted soy milk. I did use some gel food coloring to make them look prettier.  Thanks so much for posting this!

I followed the instructions exactly, and they did not set up right.  This was my first try really making candy though.  I am sure that it is an art.  Even though they did not set up, they were still good.

I substituted almond extract for the vanilla. I put an almond in the center of each ball and then chilled for one hour. I melted dark chocolate wafers and dipped each ball and chilled again. They taste pretty close to the Almond Joy but a lot fresher! They were a big hit at the Church bazaar!

This recipe was okay...I thought it was way to sugary and so eating just one kinda made me a little sick.  I think that if you were to add a little less sugar and maybe change it up by dipping them in chocolate, even just one side it would look pretty and break up the flavor just a little.

Yummy! I loved this recipe because I am a coconut lover! Even my family loved as well. Although it was a little sweet for my taste. But it is great recipe for the holidays!

I decided that just twelve weren't going to be enough for my family, so I doubled the batch. I had to dump the sugar/milk mixture into a stock pot not too long into the cooking process bacause it started to overflow. When I started scooping it out onto the wax paper, it started spreading really bad, so I waited a little bit to let it cool, when it was a consistance of creamed butter and sugar I scooped the rest out and it is doing well setting up. I should have read some more reviews...as the double batch made over fifty treats. I am going to drizzle or dip some in chocolate.

I only made one quarter of the recipe because that's all the coconut I had. After reading the reviews about how sweet this was, I decided to add 1 tsp. lime juice and a dash or two of salt. It turned out great!

These are good the only problem is they are soooo sticky. You will need to rinse your hands after every time you touch one. However, they taste good and the recipe is easy.

I made two batches of these.  The first one came out gooey and the second one formed perfectly.  I didn't have a thermometer, so I just tried to gage by the consistency.  My first batch I used a one quart saucepan and my second batch I used a one gallon pot.  The larger pot was the key in letting it boil up at a higher temp without overflowing the pot.  I placed a spoon in and pulled it out, allowing the syrup to drop off, when the last bit would kind of sit mid air in a ball I figured it was ready....that is the batch that set well.  The first batch had the gooey consistency of a mounds bar so I did a makeshift layer bar with a crust and topped with chocolate chips and almonds.

I followed the recipe...well I tried to, anyway on Med. Heat I couldn't get the ball to form. I cooked well over 40min then turned the heat up and just cooked it like no bake cookies. Removed from heat added the other 2 ingredients, at this point it still looks runny but I have patience and let it cool. After a few minutes I noticed that it was trying to set up so I dropped them on the paper and they set up. (FYI I'm not a experienced baker)

Similar to another review, this recipe fell short. I boiled the sugar/milk solution for 20 minutes and never achieved the 240 degree temp. Was never able to make balls with the final mix and it never solidified.  I decided to add a little more coconut and semi-sweet morsels to salvage something out of it.  Very disappointed.

I made this candy tonight for my 95-year-old mother for Mother's Day--it's always been a favorite of hers--she made it in the 40's and 50's. It's an easy recipe, but my suggestion is to be sure you cook the milk/sugar mixture to the temperature indicated in the recipe, and it will turn out perfect. The 20 minute time given is probably just an estimate.  This is a very sweet candy, so you may want to eat only one piece at a time.

These are very sweet! I had to add extra coconut because the consistency wasn't thick enough even though I got it to the desired temp listed in the recipe. I think using UNSWEETENED coconut would be better.  As others have said, this recipe makes a lot of candies. I scooped up almost 60.

I certainly will not make this recipe again without having the exact ingredients. I tried to cut some corners such as using diced coconut instead and it turned out like watery chunks of coconut.

This recipe makes a lot more than one dozen. i tried this at home and it's just so liquidy.
