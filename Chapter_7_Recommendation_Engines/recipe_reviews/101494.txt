Very filling soup! Similar to the one I had in Tuscany, minus the canned tomatoes which I left out as personal preference. Don't cook for too long or else the cabbage goes mushy and tasteless, and choose stale bread -soaked in cold water for a day or two- for the best results. A wonderful fall or winter soup that doesn't disappoint. Thanks for sharing Josie!

Our family had picked lots of produce at a farm and this was an excellent way to use it up.  I cannot think of a kale and chard soup that I have enjoyed as much!

I bypassed the sauteing of veggies and just put them directly into the soup. We used Eden's canned cannellini beans instead of cooking from scratch and Muir Glen organic canned tomatoes. My french bread was a few days old.  It was difficult to toast in my toaster, so I chose to fry it lightly with olive oil, and I would do that again, as it added lots of flavor!  I also used a powdered vegetable broth from Frontier instead of chicken broth and a very small amount of diced jalapeno- not traditional but very tasty!

This is a fantastic soup recipe.  I did add extra chicken broth, 1 cup fresh parsley, extra potatoes, carrots, celery, and cabbage.  Added thyme, savory, italian seasoning and cut down on the olive oil.

I've had better soups in my life, but I don't know that  I've had a better vegetable soup! This was excellent. That said, I might add sausage next time to make this even better. I followed the recipe, except that I upped the cabbage and kale and skipped the chard. I also left out the french bread. This seems to be a very adaptable and forgiving recipe.

Excellent flavor! I forgot to add the garlic in step 2 so I just sauteed it with the onions, which worked well. Also, my pot was too full to add the bread so I skipped that part. It tasted great without it, though I also tried it with putting a piece of toasted bread in the bottom of a soup bowl and ladeling the soup over it. It was delicious both ways.

This was a lot of work, but I somehow had all of the ingredients on hand and needed to use them up. I am glad that I did, because this was outstanding. I ended up making it like you would French Onion Soup, putting it in serving size containers, adding the toasted bread and cheese right at the end and then sticking them under the broiler. Absolutely delicious! Thank you Josie!

I made this soup for our Christmas Eve dinner. It was very labor intensive but worth it.  I think we had even more than 12 servings.  I substituted canned beans for dried ones.

First and foremost, I threw everything in a slow cooker (gasp!) excluding the greens. I also used canned beans (another gasp!). I let this simmer in a slow cooker for 8 hours and then added the greens the last 30 mins or so. I also added a stock that I had left over from a fish dish earlier in the week. Served over crusty day old bread and its was very feeling and comforting. I am sorry I did not prepare as directed, but I am sure it would be even better if I had. Thanks!

Hearty and delicious.  I will make this again.  I didn't have white beans so I used garbanzo, and it was still delish.

Love it. Made it twice in 2 weeks. Substituted the dried beans with canned Cannillini Beans to save time and it worked fine. Thanks

I love this soup!  The changes I've made is to add some hot Italian sausage while sauteing the onions, used canned cannellini beans instead of dried and will use whatever green I have on hand when I make it  (kale, swiss chard, collard greens, etc).  I tend to use more cabbage (at least 2 cups).  I also omit the bread and reduce the amount of olive oil to just a TBS or 2 when sauteeing the onion and sausage.  I have made this several times and it is always consistently good and a hit with whoever has it!

One of the best soups I ever made!  I froze some of it, because it makes a big batch.  It tasted great when I reheated it!  As good, as I had remembered it, when I first made it. I will definetely make it again and again.

Delicious!  I am a beginning cook and have never been very good in the kitchen, but this turned out super tasty -- receiving great reviews from both my fiance and neighbor.  I used vegetable broth since I'm a vegetarian and skipped the chard since I didn't have any, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used savoy cabbage as it tastes much better in soup to me than other kinds of cabbage.  The recipe made a huge amount so I am glad it turned out so good!  Thanks for sharing; I'll definitely be making this again and again.

I've wanted to make this since seeing it featured on a Bravo cooking show (Around the World in 80 Plates). Well this week, my CSA box had just about all the ingredients, except the celery, garlic and onion (which I already had)! The only thing I did that was not per the recipe was to use canned beans (sorry, but I'm lazy that way), and I only had 1 can of cannellini beans, so I used garbanzos for the second can. Again, sorry! Aside from that, I followed the recipe, except to make a bigger batch so I can freeze the leftovers. This is a delicious soup, and I think it's a great way to serve super nutritious greens to the family! I love greens of all kinds, and can chase my boyfriend with them, but when I've made soups like white bean and Swiss chard, he enjoyed it. I work from home, so on my lunch break, I prepared the soup and left it simmering on the stove, as the prep work is fairly labor intensive (but well worth it). I had some already stale French bread, and I did cook some spicy chicken Italian sausage to add, for my boyfriend, as he always has to have meat with dinner. What I like about this soup is it can be made vegan/vegetarian by using a vegan chicken flavored broth (Superior Touch Better Than Bouillon), and meat/cheese eaters can add Parmesan (or sausage). I can easily serve this to my vegan and meat eating friends, knowing it's both delicious and hearty!

This is absolutely delicious and great for using a variety of greens from the garden. It looked like it made a ton, so I cut it down considerably, and I used canned cannellini beans. It's good even without the bread and cheese, but if you want a "comfort food," I suggest toasting a bit of rustic bread and sprinkling parmesan on the top and broiling it in the oven for a few minutes (like French onion soup, but bury the bread down in the soup so that it soaks up the deliciousness).  It's delicious, warming, and comforting at the end of a twelve-hour shift. An excellent winter stew!

I have made this recipe twice, doubling up both times. This last time I put in swiss chard,kale and a bunch of dandelion leaves. I used white navy beans. I didn't do the toasted bread and parmesan to cut down on calories. If anyone is looking for a great diet meal, this is it. The best soap I have ever had the pleasure of making.

Exceptional vegetable soup (and I am not big on vegetable soups or bean soups without meats for that matter)!!!  This I will make over and over again.  I only had italian style diced tomatoes, so that is what I used.

Sensational!  I omitted a few things that I didn't have on hand, cabbage, potato and the bread....   instead of parm on top, when it was simmering I added a parm-regg rind.  Took it out before serving of course...  SOOO good!  I can't wait to make it with the cabbage bread!   Thanks for the recipe it was absolutely delicious!

Delicious! I followed the directions fairly closely except to halve the olive oil, use canned beans instead of dry, and I skipped the potatoes because I don't like them in soup. I also only put two slices of toast (whole wheat bread, to keep it healthy) in the soup initially, because I wasn't quite sure how it would turn out after soaking in soup for so long....but it was FABULOUS, like eating soup from a bread bowl and scraping up some of the soggy bread at the bottom that's sopped up all the delicious soup flavor. I didn't even think it needed Parmesan cheese, though it's certainly good with it.  Flavorful even without significant seasoning, nutritious, and TASTY - I will definitely make this again when I have the time.

This is an excellent recipe. it's labor intensive but worth it. The toasted French bread works if you can't get real Italian 3 day old bread. Ribollita can also be made from canned minestrone soup cooked down with stale Italian bread, crushed and added.

Following another reviewer's suggestion, I made it like french onion soup, with the bread on top and sprinkled with cheese, then melted in the broiler. That way, my gluten-free friends could enjoy it, too! I substituted spinach for the swiss chard. Delish!

I made this soup with high hopes for it. I did change one thing, I did not put the bread in the soup.  I'm only giving it three stars as this was a huge amount of work.  There is no way 30 minutes is the prep time.  I'm an experienced cook and found I was prepping forever.  The instructions should advise the cook to prep everything prior to beginning any cooking.  Good flavor, might make again but would cut the recipe in half.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner - it was the first time  people asked to take soup home! Labor intensive, but it was wonderful just to take the pot out of the fridge on turkey day and heat it up. I didn't make it with the bread and I did find that the parmesan cheese did give it the added flavor I liked. I used the canned beans as other suggested. Might try this again - with the bread next time! Was very good!

WOW! This is one filling dish!  I got a head of cabbage and a bunch of kale this week in my CSA and was looking for a new way to use them.  My husband asked me to make something Italian so when I came across this recipe I gave it a try.
It's delicious and I tried to make it as written.  I think a few pinches of crushed red pepper flakes would be nice, but other than that we both loved it.
This soup is so easy to make despite the number of ingredients used.  The most difficult thing for us was waiting 24 hours to eat it :-)

This is very tasty vegetable soup, but it's a lot of soup.  I definitely need to freeze some soup for later.  So, I wish  I had the fore-thought to put the bread in each bowl as I served the soup, as some other reviewers suggest.  

If anyone has added the bread to the pot and then put  some soup in the freezer, I like to know if the soup reheated well.

Good soup.  Made if for friends and they loved it.  It makes a lot of soup so did half in my Crockpot.  Cooked it on low for 2 hours and high for 3 1/2.  Turned out great.  Garlic, Sage and Bay Leaf were great spices.  Use special olive oil from France as a special treat to finish each dish.

As I was making it, I thought I'd never make it again.  It seemed like so much work.  Wrong!  I can't resist making it again.  Even my son, who is indifferent to most foods, liked it.  I used canned beans rather than the dry.  I guessed at using 3 cans.  Next time I plan to use 6 cans.  I probably will serve the French bread separately instead of in the soup.  Wonderful, wonderful recipe.  Thanks!

I had precooked beans in the freezer (canned would work too), so I skipped the first step. I only simmered the beans with seasonings for about half an hour while I prepped and cooked the rest of the veggies. When they were done and I added the stock, the consistency was perfect and I couldn't bring myself to add a loaf of bread (especially since the soup already filled my largest pot!). I stopped right there (did not simmer for 2 more hours), and instead filled individual bowls, put a piece of toast on top, topped with cheese (parm and cheddar), and put it under the broiler until bubbly, french onion soup style. Done this way it was delicious and only took me about an hour start to finish! Will probably make again with these changes.

Oh, my, I had such high hopes for this soup, but what a disappointment.  Overall, the ingredients were fine, but adding the sliced toasted bread to the soup resulted in what was to us a slimy mess.  I will probably try this soup again and leave out the bread.  I found this recipe in the AllRecipes magazine, and  I read and re-read the recipe over and over because I couldn't quite fathom  putting whole slices of bread into the soup.  I thought it was a misprint.  I followed the directions and of course, the bread disintegrated as it was supposed to, but I don't think the bread did anything but detract from the soup.  Next time, I will follow a reviewer's advice and put the toasted bread into individual soup bowls and ladle the soup over that.  Sorry the recipe didn't work out for me.

I used canned beans and added them with their liquid. Instead of adding the toasted french bread and allowing to soak in the soup overnight, I made parmesan crouton (one big crouton as in french onion soup) and floated them on top when serving

I loved this  recipe! Have made this several times now usually with a few changes because of what I have on have on hand. I did sub spinach & collards (separate times) for the chard & used my own homemade chicken broth for the base. Was unsure about putting bread directly into it but I followed the instructions and it worked out fine. Reheats from frozen just fine. Delightfully delicious on a cold and dreary day. First time I didn't puree the beans, second time I did and liked that better. Sometimes I hold off on the sage and add lots of oregano & thyme instead. Also, the rind from a Parmigiano Reggianno cheese will add lots of extra flavor if added with the vegetables.

We wanted to love this soup...but just couldn't.  I had 2 very small bowls and found that hot sauce helped me overcome the earthy taste.  Unfortunately, after a few bites my husband was not able to finish his.  Not having ever used Swiss Chard in a recipe before, I wonder if removing the stems might have helped?  (They were red stems and I read that those are supposed to be the sweetest.)

The recipe reminded me of Kale and Bean soup, which we love, so we'll go back to that one and take this one out of our recipe box.

This is so good and well worth the time.  It isn't a hard recipe, just time-consuming.  But the good news is that a lot of the time is passive so it's great for a multi-tasking day.  I'll definitely make this again.

WE loved this soup especially the next day although we did omit the bread.  Delicious and tasty!
