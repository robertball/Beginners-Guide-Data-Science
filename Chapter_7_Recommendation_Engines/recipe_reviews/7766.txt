I also made it and took it to a party.  Everyone loved it.  Suggestion:  make another batch of glaze with 2 cups of confectioners and 1/2 cup of amaretto.  After removing cooled cake from pan, drizzle this thicker glaze over the top.  Top it off by sprinkling sliced almonds over the top.

I've probably baked this cake about a dozen times and it never fails to be a success!! I've learned though, that it is better to pour the glaze into the poked holes after the cake has almost cooled completely, rather than while it's still warm to prevent it from breaking apart when slicing.  This is by-far the BEST cake that I've ever baked and I enjoy eating it everytime!!  Thanks Shawn!

Great cake!  I would suggest using less amaretto in the icing if you're serving it to folks who aren't drinkers - just barely glaze the cake instead.  On the other hand, if they do drink, use it all!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent cake. I used 1/2 the amaretto in the glaze they brushed it on. Then I made a second glaze to drizzle on. 1 cup powdered sugar. 2 tbs. melted butter. a few drops of almond extract and a litte water. Very easy but tastes like you slaved all day.

I made this cake before "as is" and it turned out wonderful.  I didn't have any vanilla pudding mix, so I decided to use chocolate.  Almond and chocolate are a great pair.  If you liked the original recipe, you'll LOVE the chocolatey version!

It's recipes like this that make me LOVE allrecipes.com. Note: the glaze makes this cake so good. Next time, I'm doubling the glaze and poking tons of holes in the cake to pour it into. It's amazing. Also - if you haven't tried kitchen aide silicone bakeware, you must! My cake practically jumped out of my silicone bundt pan. My boyfriend loved the cake so much that after we'd each had one slice he asked if he could take the rest home to his family so they could try it. They loved it, too.

This cake is fantastic!  I made it for my mom's birthday party - everyone loved it.  I used a french vanilla cake mix - all I had on hand - and dusted the top with powdered sugar since my mom doesn't like frosting or sugary glazes or anything too sweet.  It was easy and looked very tempting on the plate.  I will definitely make this again.

Very Moist. I can still tell that it's a box cake though. I would add more almond extract next time to add more flavor.

my husband recommended i crush some walnuts and pour it in the batter.  it looked so delicious that i had to try it right after i took it out of the oven.  my husband tried it after it cooled and he suggested i gave it another try.  it was good.  

fyi:  
*cool it before you eat it.  
*the height of the cake is half the size of a regular bundt cake; it's short.

Sprinkle 2/3 cup slivered almonds in the pan before adding the batter.  Cool completely and remove from pan before glazing.  The nuts and shimmer from the glaze give a nice, finished look.

This cake was wonderful - I am told it is the best cake I have made (and I have made many good ones!).  I used cheesecake flavored pudding mix and I did change the glaze to be more like a rum cake sauce I make:  1/2 stick unsalted butter, 1/3 to 1/2 c of amaretto, and 1 cup granulated sugar...put all in a pot and bring to a boil, then pour over hot cake while still in pan.  DELICIOUS!

I turned the recipe into cupcakes, which was not a good idea.  It took way more time and energy than a cake would have taken.  They were still very good, but next time I will stick with a bundt cake pan.

I was very excited about making this recipe for my company picnic. However, it seems the directions were not very clear for a newbie like me. "Take out of oven" and "while still warm, poke holes in cake" apparently do not mean "poke holes after you take out of the oven". My cake fell instantly. Too bad, I tried a chunk of it before tossing it out, seems like it would have been a hit.

Tasty!  Just like rum cake (except it's amaretto).  I adjusted the glaze.  I didn't want a soggy, wet cake (which I sometimes get with really liquidy glazes).  So I added another 2c. powered sugar  & 1/4 tsp almond extract to the glaze to make a cinnamon bun glaze consistency.  I then poured it on the top of the cake & let it run down the sides.  Didn't cover it for a couple hours to let the glaze harden slightly.  The cake was nice & moist with a sweet frosting.  The only negative thing about the recipe - the amaretto made the glaze taste like perfume. It tasted better on the cake, but next time I will experiment with making a glaze with milk & powdered sugar & adding just a couple T of amaretto or maybe just some almond extract.

Everyone loved this! You can make this really healthy by using egg whites and apple sauce and believe me, no one will know! The glaze is the special secret to this one.
Don't forget your coffee and amaretto and creamer along side a piece of this.

Yup, this certainly does deserve five stars. I dusted mine with a bit of powdered sugar for looks. Especially nice to do during Christmas.

This cake was so easy to make and it was just the delicious.  The smell alone made my mouth water.  I used a 3.4 ounce package of the vanilla instant pudding and that worked just as well.  Would definitely make this again!

Very yummy and very fast to make. Personally, I felt that the icing was a little thin so I added another cup of powdered sugar to it. Be careful when you adjust the serving size to the recipe. It doesn't adjust the numbers in the "steps" portion of the recipe.

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve. Both kids and adults loved it. I didn't have almond extract so I substituted lemon extract. Since kids were eating it, also, I made half the glaze with orange juice and half with amaretto. The OJ gave it a different taste but it was still delicious!

I made this cake for a 4th of July and, though it was a bit time-consuming, the payoff was wonderful!  This is the most delicious cake we ever had!  My husband and daughter ate the leftovers within 24 hours!  I didn't use a bundt pan, I used a 9" springform pan and just cooked it twice as long---PERFECT!!!

Shawn thank you so much for this recipe, this is my FAVORITE cake now!!!  I made this for the first time maybe 6-7 years ago and never posted a review (sorry) and it was an absolute hit!! It was so good that I made 2 more back to back.  Every time I make this cake it gets gobbled down within an hour - no kidding.  The cake is so moist and light, it's amazing.  This is an awesome recipe, thanks again!!!  My only recommendation, I am a big amaretto fan and I can absolutely taste the difference between the cheap amaretto and the more expensive.  I prefer DiSaronno Amaretto, I've tried the Hiram Walker, never the DuBushon or whatever that cheapy bottle is, and the cake always tastes better with the DiSaronno.  I've even tried Hiram Walker in the batter and DiSaronno in the glaze, it was good, but again, I'm an amaretto aficianado so I could taste the difference.

I wanted to find a recipe to use up that little bit of Amaretto that had been sitting in my cupboard for about 10 yrs. and decided to try this one.  Of course, I didn't have some of the listed ingredients.  Here were my substitutions:  one 16 oz. lemon pound cake mix (which I HIGHLY recommend - lemon + Amaretto = yum!); one 3.4 oz box of instant vanilla pudding (they make a 5.1 oz box?  I debated for about half an hour whether to use two boxes or just one.  I ended up erring on the side of subtlety.); and vanilla extract instead of almond.  It turned out fabulous dahling!  Oh, and I used an angel food cake pan as I didn't have a bundt pan.  I will definitely make this cake again.  (Darn!  Now I have to go out and buy some more Amaretto.;>) )  A really good recipe Shawn.  Thanks so much!

The cake was delicious. I decided at the last minute that it needed something more so I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze also on this website and it was just right.

Really easy and SOOOO yummy!  Someone always requests this recipe from me. (First reviewed 1/25/05)

Added note:  I just made this (7/12/07) and I didn't have any yellow cake mix ... made it with white and it was just as moist and yummy.  Got another request for the recipe ...

This was a very yummy, moist, and simple cake. My husband asks daily when i'm going to make it again. Didn't have quite the almond flavor I thought that it would, so will increase the almond extract next go around. And as another reviewer suggested will use a glaze on top and add slivered almonds to it.

I made this to take to a family dinner at my parent's house.  No one really liked this cake and I was very disappointed.  I had very high hopes for it with all the great ratings and followed the recipe exactly, but I guess it's just not our taste.

Made this cake to bring to my doctor but I forgot it so my kids ate it and loved it. I've made it 3 more times since then and family members thought that it was very moist & tasty. I will make this again!

This was a very moist cake.  I used a bamboo skewer to punch small holes all over it and it worked really well.  My glaze got a little crunchy like the glaze on a cruller.  It was a little different!  My mother-in-law never drinks and she didn't find this "too much" so it was a hit all the way around!  Thanks for a keeper.

I just made this recipe for a family get together and it was a hit.  I did make a modification to the frosting.  We are all Chocolate finatics so I couldn't show up without chocolate on my dessert.  I bought the Betty Crocker ready made chocolate frosting with hershey chocolate and mixed in two tablespoons of Amaretto.  If you don't like a strong kick, you might want to add just a couple teaspoons or a tablespoon.  I suggest you start out with just a little and taste until you reach the desired taste.  Thanks for the recipe Shawn!

I made this cake with some Amaretto that I picked up in Italy. It was wonderful. I used twice the glaze which gave it quite a punch!

This cake disappeared in no time and everyone requested it be made again. I used 1/4 cup amaretto and no almond extract. I also crushed some pecans and put them in the bundt pan before pouring in the batter (I had them left from various Christmas/Thanksgiving recipes) and it really took it up a notch. Fantastic recipe!

Really hoped this cake would be more flavorful than it turned out to be. Cake was really light and fluffy but not a deep amaretto flavor,even though I increased the amount of amaretto I put into the cake.

I made one change to this great moist cake is instead of 1/2 cup of water...use Amaretto instead.  Makes a big different, much more flavor.  I get many requests. I top the glaze with sliced amonds. Looks so pretty.

My boyfriend and all of our co-workers LOVE this cake!  If you have problems with sogginess, then cut back, just a little bit, on the other liquids (grandma's suggestion on seeing the recipe before I made it the first time).  It always comes out moist and flavorful.  Topped with the glaze from this recipe, chocolate buttercream frosting, Nutella (chocolate-hazlenut spread), or ice cream, it's always a welcomed addition to the dessert table or office luncheon.  Also, if the taste in the glaze is too overpowering, add a pinch of salt.  It will help to mellow the flavor.

It got good reviews at the dinner I took the cake too.  My biggest complaint is that it gets soggy - quick!  Best at the first sitting.

This was OK. The glaze wasn't very good...I should've waited until the cake cooled completely and then put a glaze on it.

This cake is AWESOME! My family pretty much devoured this cake in a day. The inside is so moist and delicious. The only change I made was to double the almond extract. I had planned on making an additional glaze for the top, but it is so good on its own, there's really no need! It is so quick and easy to make since the base is a box cake mix. The soaked in Amaretto is definitely the key to this cake!  Update - I have made a similar version of this cake twice in the past week for friends' b-days. I substituted chocolate cake mix (regular and devil's food), chocolate pudding, vanilla extract, and Kahlua. They both turned out so good! I would suggest doubling the extract and adding a bit more Kahlua (no more than extra 1/4 cup) for more flavor. My friends loved it! Such a great recipe and very versatile!!

I baked this cake and I think it's going to be absolutely delicious. However, I'm wondering if there wasn't a slight miscalculation for the glaze. 1/2 cup Amaretto to one cup of powdered sugar just doesn't turn out like it should for a glaze. I'm wondering if Shawn meant one box of powdered sugar.

The best cake ever tasted.  But I have 1 problem.  I cant for the life of me get the glaze right.  What am I doing wrong?  The glaze just absorbs into the cake leaving nothing on top just a soggy cake.
Please help anyone.....12/13/04

A very average cake. I can't believe all the 5 stars! Made the recipe as it was written.This cake had no spectacular almond flavor, wasn't very sweet & yes, you could still tell very much that it was a box cake. Very disappointing, given all the 5 stars! Will never make this again!

This recipe is to DIE for.  I love amaretto to begin with and this cake was perfectly moist.  I topped mine off with an amaretto glaze that I made with 1 cup of powdered sugar,  2 tbsp melted butter, a few drops of almond extract, a tablespoon of amaretto and enough water to make it pourable.  I drizzled this over the top.  YUMMY!

This is a wonderful recipe and I too suggest doubling the glaze for the last step.  Everyone flipped out over this one!

This cake was so good! I took another reviewer's suggestion and did the glaze with 2 cups confectioners' sugar and 1/2 cup amaretto. I roasted the almonds before putting them on the cake! YUM!

Easy recipe and great flavor. I made cupcakes instead of a bundt cake and they came out very moist. The glaze recipe as written, however, is not really made for applying to cupcakes. Even with holes in the cupcakes, most of the glaze ran off the tops and into the pans. As a result, I had soggy and sticky cupcake wrappers. Great tasting, but definitely messy!

This cake was so amazing that I had to convince my friends that I actually made it. I arranged sliced maraschino cherries around the middle of the cake after pouring about 1/2 of the batter into the mold, and before I poured some of the icing into the bottom of the cake, I mixed a little bit of the grenadine from the cherries into it. SO YUMMY. I left the rest of the icing w/o cherry, painted on a few layers, and then made a non-alcoholic icing of milk and powdered sugar for the final glaze so it would look pretty. I was afraid I had over saturated it but everyone loved it! It gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling while you eat it :)

This came out terrific ! I did not have yellow cake mix at the time I was making this but i had a recipe for yellow cake and just started from scratch with out adding any of the liquid ingredients . I did use a little more amaretto by switching the measurements for the water to 2 tbs instead but that's just because i like it so much ;O) . And i also made a double layered cake out of it instead of a bundt pan but it came out wonderful.

I'm a cake virgin and I really wanted to make something special for my husband's birthday. Since Disaronno is one of his favorite liqueurs, this was a perfect choice.
The recipe is obviously super easy. The only change I made was to double the almond essence.
Like everyone else commented, the cake is moist and delicious! This recipe's a sure keeper.

very good cake.  I made it ahead and kept drizzling the glaze over it from the bottom them drizzled the top of the cake.  It absorbs the glaze.  Very good.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Made it to take the the in-laws and they couldn't stop whittling away at this. I punched a bazillion holes in the bottom for the initial icing, then after it was cooled made a little more to drizzle on top. It looked great and tasted AMAZING!!

This cake was really good for a box mix. The amaretto glaze was awesome! The only problem i had was the cake really needed more amaretto flavor i really didnt taste alot! But a good basic cake with a hint and i mean hint of amaretto.

I altered this a little. I used Butterscotch cake mix, and butterscotch pudding for the cake. I also added a little milk and ground cloves to the glaze. Absolutely fabulous!!!

I made this into cupcakes and while they are good, they really don't have the amaretto taste I was hoping for.  I even added extra amaretto to the batter and a little extra almond extract.  

If I attempt this again, I would double the glaze (really the only almond flavor) and add atleast a tablespoon of almond extract.

For now I'll just have to make almond flavored frosting.

Easy and very tasty.  We prefer desserts that are not over the top sweet and this fits the bill.  Plus, I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I've made it many times and friends always ask for the recipe.  Bon Appetite

One of my all-time favorite cakes. It's moist and does not taste boxed at all. I've been known to melt butter in the bottom of the bundt pan and put a little brown sugar over it to make a crunchy, caramel glaze on the cake.

Got rave reviews from my family over christmas. Followed the directions exactly - made it a couple days before xmas.  Right before we served it I made a little thicker glaze from more pwdered sugar and amaretto so it didnt look so plain.  Definitely a keeper.

Made this cake last weekend.  It was awesome.  Boyfried loved it and guest also raved about it.  I agree with others that the cake should be made a day ahead.  Was much better the 2nd day.  Next time, I will try glazing the cake after removing it from the pan.

This is the first time in maybe 25 years I've baked a cake using a box mix. I won't do it again. Although the almond flavor is there the texture and taste come from the box.

With the great reviews this cake got, I thought I had a winner, so I made 2 cakes...1 for my family and 1 for a housewarming gift.  It was so ordinary...a boxed yellow cake mix...and that's exactly what it tasted like, that I was embarassed to give it as a gift, so I didn't.  My husband took ours to work, and the other one went in the trash.  I won't be making this cake again.

I made this for a school bake sale/auction; two cakes are made, one for sample, one for sale. This was the most popular cake there (take that boring pineapple upside down cake!). Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Add an almond butercream icing (or the Almond Chocolate sold in stores) and it's out of this world! Thanks ever so much.

I tasted this cake after it cooled, and my first impression was that the amaretto was too strong and the cake was soggy on top (as mentioned by other reviewers).  However, the next day, the cake was perfect!  Make it a day ahead for the flavors to meld.

I also didn't have any amaretto, but had butterscotch schnapps, so made it like that, it was FANTASTIC..Well, wanted to experiment, so used chocolate cake mix, peppermint schnapps, peppermint extract and chocolate/peppermint pudding...it tasted just as good...:)

This recipe sounded great, but I don't like amaretto, so I substituted butterscotch schnapps and butterscotch pudding.  It was heavenly.

This cake is really good, but might I suggest you check out White Chocolate Amaretto Cake on this site too.  It think it's better still.  Nothing wrong with this one, though.

I'm confused, is the glaze supposed to go on the bottom of the bundt cake?!  Well, I removed the cake from the pan immediately after it came out of the oven (make sure you greased & floured your pan well!) and then drizzled the "top" with the glaze.  I heated the glaze in a saucepan until just boiling, then poured slowly over the  cake (after I poked a bunch of holes).  I then sprinkled it with slivered almonds as other reviewers suggested.  Pretty cake, very sugary glaze, but tasty.  Confusing directions, but good recipe idea.  Thanks!

Very moist cake, took other reviewer's suggestions and cut the oil back to 1/3 C, and added water depending on consistency of cake batter.  I had some leftover shelled walnuts that I mixed with some store bought caramel syrup (enough to cover the nuts), a dash of almond extract, and about 1 tsp (maybe less?) of Amaretto.  After I poured the batter into mini bundt pans, I spooned the nut mixture on top and baked for about 30 minutes.  (Your baking time may differ, our oven's weird)  Came out very tasty, and didn't need the glaze, although a light dusting with confectioner's sugar is a pretty touch.  Can't wait to experiment with this recipe again.  :)

My husband found this cake to be a little bitter (perhaps his translation of the taste of the amaretto?).  This cake was pretty good, just not as good as I had expected due to the rave reviews.  I will try it again, just in case it was baker error.  This cake would definitely be better--to my family--if it had a frosting!  It is quite moist, though.

Great cake!!! I made this cake yesterday to take to my Greek in-laws for my mother-in-laws birthday.  It was excellent tasting and everyone commented on how moist it was and not to sweet.  I will definately be making this again! Thanks! :)

I have made this several times and it's always a hit. I used to use Butter Recipe Yellow, but really liked Golden Vanilla. Sadly, they don't make those cakes any longer, and who knows why, because they were excellent sellers as far as boxed cakes go. I even turned the recipe into cupcakes for my wedding reception and they were gone quickly. I make it exactly as this recipe and the glaze. I poke my holes right out of the oven because it doesn't work as well if it cools. Cupcakes were a trick and I had help for hole poking, because I don't do full thickness cupcakes either and they cool quickly.  It does not make the cake flop, nor does the glaze make it soggy. It makes it moist. The glaze also needs to go on when the cake is warm. I pour it over each 1-1 1/2" layer, as I make thin, 9" rounds, as opposed to bundt. This isn't a healthy recipe...what cake is. I am aware and will not do this cake such an injustice as to turn it into something it's not. The only thing I do differently,  is add filling between thin layers, and topping. I think it just makes this cake over the top. beat 2c heavy cream, then add 1c amaretto creamer, 3.4oz instant vanilla pudding, 1/4 c amaretto. yumm. I top that with crushed toffee bits,  with or without the chocolate. It's all good and I am even making one tomorrow.

Excellent cake - it got rave reviews from my group! I goofed up and put the 1/2 cup of amaretto in the cake batter accidentally, so I added two 3.2 oz vanilla pudding boxes to the batter. Despite the goof up, the cake turned out wonderful, very aromatic (needless to say!!) and moist. For the glaze, I thickened it up as others had suggested and put 2 c. powdered sugar to 1/2 cup amaretto. It turned out nice and thick but once on the cake thinned out and sunk in nicely. This is a five-star recipe for me!

I made this cake as cupcakes using a buttercream frosting flavored with Amaretto liqueur.  It was excellent.  I also made a gluten free version of this using a gluten free cake mix and adding some sour cream to make it more moist.  They were amazing!

So amazingly good!  My family cannot get enough amaretto so it was very popular!  I liked cooking it the day before because it does make it taste a little less alcoholy.  Also, I definitely used cheap amaretto and it still tasted really good so no need to bust your butt buying disarono or anything like that

An easy way to jazz up a cake mix when you need a little something fast.  I let the glaze soak in while the cake was hot and set for a couple hours then drizzled melted chocolate frosting (I had stirred in a teaspoon of amaretto) over the cake when it was plated to add a nice finish.  I like the ease of this and will make again soon.  Thanks for this recipe.

This cake was moist and delicious.  I used Betty Crocker's super moist yellow butter cake mix which required a stick of butter.
This is definitely a keeper!

Quick and easy, this gets 5 stars because my boyfriend loved it! I didn't have any amaretto so I used almond flavoring and coconut Barcardi rum. I also used the rum when making the glaze. I will make this again in the future...also dusting the cake with a little powdered sugar was sufficient decoration for me.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe but my husband really liked it. You definitely have to cut back on the bake time or it will come out burnt. Overall, it just tasted like a coffee cake with a hint of amaretto.

Glad i didn't leave the cake in the oven as long as suggested, was already dry when taken out 5 mins before time.  Cake very fluffy and light though.  Could use a little more taste.

DEFINITELY A KEEPER, GETS MANY RAVE REVIEWS.  THE ONLY THING I DID WAS ADD ABOUT TWO TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER TO THE GLACE AS IT HELPS TO TONE DOWN THE SWEETNESS OF IT.  A GREAT CAKE FOR SPECIAL EVENTS.

This recipe was fantastic!  My daughter had it for her 13th birthday. But instead of the amaretto sauce she used chocolate syrup and absolutely adored it!  And we had decided to make them as mini bunts and this was a big hit!  Everyone loved their little bunt cakes!

This cake is incredible.  I really enjoyed it.  Instead of the amaretto glaze, my wonderful husband suggested I use a bocce ball drink glaze.  (We didn't use the amaretto in the glaze because we were serving it to kids, but it still turned out great.)  The recipe is 1 cup sifted powdered sugar, 2 T pineapple juice and a splash of OJ.  It didn't taste that great alone, but when we put it on the cake...it was very yummy.  Especially when it has a chance to soak in.

Happy eating!

This cake is ok.  The amaretto liquor adds an odd flavor, not as flavorful as you would imagine.  It is definately moist, but I will keep looking.

I fixed this for my Mother's 82nd birthday dinner and it was a big hit!! I thought the glaze idea was a little weird and I, too, agree, when you put the cake on the plate after taking it out of the pan, it looks boring. So I just dusted it with powdered sugar!

I was hoping for something that was quick, easy & a substitute for homemade.  With all the additions, it still tasted like it came straight from the box. All Recipes took the "no rating" option out--or I would have used that. If you like the boxed cake taste then you will probably like this one alot.

I baked the Amaretto Cake for the first time just to try it out to see how good it really is, and it was very good, so I baked it again for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it, it is so easy to just throw it in one pan and bakeit, cool, and turn it out of the bundt pan and its ready to eat.

This cake is very good and also easy to make. Surprisingly the suggested amount of Amaretto (which I thought seemed like a lot) may not be enough. Don't get me wrong - the cake is very good as instructed.

Cake is very good.  Nice and moist.  My taste had it a little over powering with the almond extract.  Will make again but cut back on the extract.

I didn't like this recipe, I thought it was kinda heavy, even though very moist. It tasted too much like a box cake that was soaked in amaretto. But my neighbors liked it so I gave it to them.

I did not add the glaze and still this was a good moist cake with strong amaretto flavor.  I actually might cut down on the amaretto next time.

This cake is great.  I drizzle the icing on the top of the cake as well and add toasted almonds and it is always very moist and a hit.  I have been asked for this recipe on several occasions.

This is a totally mixed review. Two people enjoyed it and the other two felt it was only mediorce/O.K. You could for sure tell it was not a "from scratch" effort. Probably wouldn't use again unless I experimented with it, alot. I was disapointed in this, overall. Sorry. Jazzy

I worried that there would be a strong Amaretto taste,  but to my surprise it was mild and pleasant.  This cake was moist and absolutely wonderful.  I added an extra 1/2 cup confectioners sugar to the glaze and the consistancy was perfect for me.  My husband and I ate the whole cake ourselves.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made this cake for a fathers day party and everybody loved it. If you like amarretto then this cake is for you! It was very sweet, but took a little bit longer than it said to cook completely.

I guess I should have known this recipe was not going to be on my list of "best cakes".  
I just don't like the taste of boxed cake mixes.
I thought that adding the pudding and the ammaretto would mask the taste of a pre-packaged cake mix, sadly, it did not...
Overall, it's an ok cake.  
I wouldn't rave about it.

fantastic! so easy, yet so delicious. highly recommend this simple way to spruce up a box cake mix. it's very moist, too. yum! the only thing i might do differently next time is save some glaze 'til the cake is cooled so you can see it for a prettier presentation.

We have a version of this cake in our family for years but slightly different.  1 box yellow cake mix, 1 pkg instant vanilla OR pecan pudding, 1/2 cup cocoa, 4 eggs, 1/2 cup cold water, 1/2 cup Amaretto.  Mix and pour into greased Bundt pan (I spread a thin layer of sliced almonds to the pan first) and bake at 350 for approx 50-60 minutes or until done.  GLAZE:  Boil for 5 minutes - 1/4 cup water, 1 stick butter, 1 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup Amaretto.  Let cake cook for 10 minutes I. Pan then turn onto plate.  Pout 1/2 your glaze into pan and lining up ridges turn your cake back into Bundt pan.  With a toothpick make a bunch of holes into bottom or cake and pour on the rest of the glaze.  Let it sit for a bit so glaze can soak in and then turn onto platter.  Add a few cherry halves for a festive look.  Absolutely wonderful, especially if made a day in advance!  Enjoy!

It was delicious!  Even better a couple days after the amaretto settled into the cake and the icing firmed a bit. As others did, I made extra icing to put on the top and added sliced toasted almond on top.

To avoid a soggy cake that falls apart, I followed other reviewers suggestions and waited until mostly cooled before glazing, using a silicone brush to apply a little less than half the glaze. The other half I thickened up with 2 cups powdered sugar and applied as a slow thick drizzle. The cake was a little drier than I would have liked without all of that soaked-in glaze. Still, it was pretty delicious, and I will definitely make again, but I will reduce baking time.

I followed this recipe to a point. No longer can find that siZe cake mix. The supermarket only had the 15.25 size cake mixes. This is about 1/3 less quantity. So I reduced the amounts of other ingredients to make it turn out. 
I also used a stainless infuser to get the glaze into the holes.  Workegteat.

I followed the recipe as written BUT I used 2 loaf pans—8X3, sprinkled bottom with slivered almonds before batter. I had too much glaze.! I poked holes on cooled cakes in the pans, slowly poured glaze, waited 10 mins. Turned cakes out quickly poured more glaze on top of each and allowed to cool completely. I still had glaze left over. The cake is DELICIOUS but a bit too sweet. Will definitely make again but will use less glaze.

I was looking for an Amaretto cake recipe for my boyfriend who has "sweet" memory around an Amaretto cake (they had this baked by a bakery) he had for his aunt's birthday. He wanted it really soaked in Amaretto and this recipe was perfect. It came out really well, but I now see that the key is how to fill the Amaretto glaze into the cake well. I poked many many deep holes with skewer stick and poured the glaze thoroughly, but when I cut the cake, I could see that the glaze has reached only about 1/3 from the bottom of the cake. Next time, I will try something different - either making a little larger holes or making the glaze a little thinner (more Amaretto! :) so more cake will be soaked in Amaretto.

I made this cake as is.  It tasted like nothing more than yellow box cake, only drier.  No amaretto flavor in the 2 T. to add for the cake.  Disappointed.

Best cake ever! I’ve made it for several occasions and it’s a hit every time. I’ve made it exactly as written, with Baileys instead of Amaretto, and with chocolate cake and pudding with Kahlua. You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

This was good, but it's very sweet. I probably should have expected it, given the amaretto, but it was too much for me.

This is word for word the famous Bacardi rum cake using amaretto instead of rum and the glaze is incorrect.  It should be 1 stick butter, 1 cups sugar, 1/2 cup amaretto and 1/4 cup water.  Melt the butter, add sugar and water and boil for 5 mins (use timer) remove from heat add amaretto and pour over cake while it is still in pan, wait 5 mins and invert on cake plate.  It amazes me that 50+ people are calling it a family recipe!

I did read the reviews and make a couple of the changes that were mentioned. 
I added amaretto to the batter and increased the almond extract and the cake was very, very good!
 I will be making this cake again soon! 
I had a hard time finding a 18.25 oz cake mix as almost all of them were 15.25 oz. Am I the only one who ran into this?

Oh my!  Love this. I increased the amaretto to 1/4 C + 2T, and decreased the water to 1/4 C in the batter.  Very nice.  Used the usual 1/2 C of amaretto for the icing.  Poked the holes in the cake with a bamboo skewer and had no problems whatsoever with it soaking in while hot.  Gonna make this one again.  Thanks.

This cake was so light and fluffy. It's now one of my 'go to' recipes. Gonna try the almonds in the bottom of the bunt pan next time.

Overall the cake tastes okay. But I am very disappointed with this recipe. I'm not sure if the amounts of the amaretto were mixed up. It only calls for 2 TBSP in the cake itself along with almond extract , and then 1/2 cup of amaretto in the icing. The cake had very little almond flavor and I even doubled the amount of amaretto (4 TBSP). The glaze seemed to be too strong - I had to add more confectioner's sugar. I think next time I will flip the amaretto amounts - put more in the cake, less in the glaze...or better yet, find another recipe since I was looking for a recipe where the cake was just bursting with amaretto flavor, and you didn't have rely on the icing glaze to accomplish that..

i made this for several friends for Christmas, rather than the usual cookie platter.  I got rave reviews on the 'high octane'  wonderfulness :)  This will definitely be a repeat recipe for my adult friends.

I wanted an easy cake, using the cake mix I had on hand. I'm sorry to change things a little bit, but I used a dark chocolate cake mix, pumpkin spice liqueur, and chocolate pudding. Other than that I followed the directions exactly. This is the second time I made this cake, and it's a winner every time.

I'm thinking about replacing the 1/2 cup of water with Amaretto for a more  intense Amaretto flavor.  Has anyone tried this and with what results?  Thanks for the help!

My daughter wanted amaretto cake for her birthday.  I had never made one before and this recipe looked easy and had great reviews.  The cake turned out amazing!!  I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla.  I made a double batch of the glaze but I think a single would have been fine. I poked holes and filled them with the glaze.  I did use disaronno.  I will make this again!!  Made it a second time in a regular cake pan and it was a big hit again.  I am using this recipe to make cupcakes now.

This recipe is so easy to  make and the cake came out really moist. When I was mixing the batter it was so thik that my hand held mixer started to get overheated and started to smell the burning wire smell. I stopped and put it in the oven without doing anymore mixing. I was afraid that may be I saw the portions of water or oil  wrong. But I didn't. I used orange juice instead of water. Also, the glaze was very watery so it soaks into the cake. I didn't make any thicker glaze separately though as there was plenty of sugar in the cake. I got quite a compliment with it and will make it again. Thanks for the easy recipe.

Absolutely delish!  I agree that allowing the cake to cool awhile before pouring the glaze works better....and I also made extra glaze to pour over cake after it is turned out. Served with homemade vanilla ice cream it is fantastic!

It doesn't get any simpler than this!  Wait for a day or two, and the cake will get real boozy depending on how much Amaretto you put in to your liking.  For me, I would have a hard time passing a breathalyzer test.  LOL!

Easy and delicious - took it to work and it was gone by noon.  I increased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp. and made another glaze for the top.  Then I sprinkled toasted sliced almond and pressed it on the glaze - very pretty presentation.

This cake is the best! Our daughter started making it years ago and we have never changed anything about it! It is great the way it is! Since the ameretto isn't used often I get the small bottles and that works out great! 

Thank you Shawn from the Cookie Gram!

OMG this is delicious.  If you're trying to get favors out of someone, make them this cake.  It's incredible.  I follow the most helpful review that suggests making a thicker glaze from powdered sugar and amaretto.  Once the cake is cool, drizzle it on top - it provides a nice contrast, and an extra punch (but not a kick) of amaretto.

My family loved this cake. It was excellent and very easy to make.   I always add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to all my bundt cakes.  The cake will to taller.  This is just personal preference.  This cake is wonderful either way.

OMG...This recipe is amazing! I would change nothing or add nothing because it is perfect.  It is so moist and soft.  And it didn't crumble.  I waited for the cake to cool before I used the toothpick to put holes in it for the glaze. My husband loves it and I love it.  I defiantly going to make this again!

So delicious!  The glaze is not even necessary, but if you want a stronger amaretto taste or if sweeter is always better in your book, then definitely make the glaze.

Followed recipe exactly. At first did not like the cake and felt the glaze was too "alchoholy" but once the cake sat over night, the glaze seemed to seep into the cake and lose that taste. This was delicious, got tons of compliments and will be used often!

This cake is so easy to make and tastes great!  I followed Elisah's suggestion and make extra glaze with 2 cups confection sugar and 1/2 cup amaretto.  This is a great cake to take to a gathering. Loved it!

I substituted the Yellow Cake for French Vanilla and doubled the almond extract using 1/2 tsp. instead of 1/4 tsp. After glazing the cake I allowed it to sit for a couple of hours (and essentially harden) so that I could sift a pretty sprinkling of confectionery sugar over the top. The cake was pretty, moist and full of flavor. It was definitely on the sweet side. I have made it three times now and it has always been a hit. This Amaretto Cake is super quick and easy to make.

This was a yummy cake that I happened to have all the ingredients for on hand and decided to try out.  I used a cherry chip box cake, sugar-free pudding mix, and substituted applesauce for about 3/4 of the vegetable oil called for.  Delicious cake if you're looking for something different and like the sweetness of amaretto!

YUMMY!
First attempt I felt you couldn't quite taste the Amaretto enough so I added a little more. 
Note: Don't try to replace the Sugar with artificial sweeteners... Doesn't too well.

This cake is delicious.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I've made it 3 times and sometimes it seems to be better than others.  I'm not sure what the difference is.

This was great! I made a little thicker glaze and toned down the amaretto in the glaze. For the 1 cup of confectioner's sugar I used 3 T. of water and 1 T. of amaretto. This was so moist and had a great flavor. Will definitely be making this one again. So easy too! I would recommend to anyone. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for Easter this year.  This is a delicious cake and pretty moist as well.  I was tempted to make some frosting to drizzle over the outside as a glaze, but it is sweet enough without it thanks to the powdered sugar/amaretto solution.  Just don't eat too much in one sitting.  One caution: make sure your guests are OK with alchohol.  The sugar/amaretto soak solution has enough alchohol in it that eating several pieces (probably 3 or more) could give someone a "buzz", especially a child...

Super Easy attractive cake!  I "sugar" my bundt pan instead of "flour" it before pouring in the batter.  Gives the cake a little bit of a crisper outer crust, and no ugly leftover flour.  Disappers quickly no matter where I take it!

Great tasting cake. I used a marble cake mix for a different look and it was really impressive looking. But as much as I love the taste of amaretto I still like the rum cake recipe from this site better. (and I don't even like rum)

This recipe is great! I made it exactly as the recipe requires and as a chocolate double layer cake. Instead of yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding I used butter chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding, butter fudge frosting with toasted almond slices on top. Both cakes were so good and moist. It's great. Now people think I can bake.

This cake was moist and delicious.  I received many compliments and many requests for the recipe.  I am not a fan of cakes that use a mix but this one is a keeper!  Although I can still tell it is made from a mix, the amaretto gives it a really special flavor.  I made one and a half times the glaze and was too impatient to wait more than 15 minutes to remove it from the pan.  At that time, I noticed that the glaze was not evenly distributed so I halved the glaze recipe and brushed the rest over the top.  Before serving, I dusted this cake with powdered sugar to lighten it up a bit (in coloring... not in calories).  It was very good!

This is one of the best cake mix based recipes I've ever tried.  Incredibly easy--I had it in the oven in less than 10 minutes and came out of the pan perfect.  The texture is light and very moist and the taste is delicious. I topped the cake with a confectioners sugar and milk glaze flavored with almond extract and sprinkled with toasted sliced almonds. Will definitely make this cake again.

This cake was made for me by one of my co-workers.  She made it without the glaze and it still had a really good taste to it.  It was moist and super yummy.  I would make it myself in the future.

This was sinfully good!  The only thing that makes it better is to let it set for at least a day. The glaze soaks in and the cake is even moister.  I made it and immediately took it to someone's house and it was a hit.  But, I brought home the rest and the next day, it was twice as good.

Had to use a white cake mix but I don't think affected the outcome.  My friends liked but I wouldn't rush to make it again.  It was a very wet cake so some of the slices were falling apart.  Also, I'm not much of a drinker so it was a little strong for me when I got a slice that had a hole poked in it with lots of the alcohol.

My boyfriend's birthday was two days away and I had no idea what cake to make him because he is such a picky eater. I made him the amaretto cake and he loved it!! I also made this cake for his father's birthday ( who is a professional chef) and he could not stop raving about it. Thank you for this recipe!!!

Turned out delicious and a hit!  I forgot to add the almond extract (oops) and it was still loved by all!  What a moist & yummy cake. I lowered the ameretto when making the syrup, and just used it as a thick glaze over top of cake.  Success.

I loved this cake !
I used cook pudding instead of the instant, only because that's all I have on hand.
It came out wonderful anyway.
I made it in a bundt pan.
Bravo !

This cake got rave reviews at my latest dinner party.  I added just a bit more almond extract, which enhanced the flavor even more.  Everyone had seconds!!!!!!  Linda

I always pass this off as my own recipe when bringing it to a gathering or party...This recipe is extremely easy and tastes like you have been in the kitchen for hours making it from scatch.

Perpetual dieters came back for 3rds and 4ths after taking 'just a sliver'
This cake disappeared in a matter of minutes.  Would really like to give
it 10 stars
