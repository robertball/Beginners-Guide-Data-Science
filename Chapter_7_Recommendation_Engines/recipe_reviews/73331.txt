Awesome! I deep fried the chicken (less greasy than pan frying)and added 1/2 cup ground coconut and 1/4 cup ground almonds in the breading mixture. I added some shopped water chestnuts and also used the "Spicy Pineapple Sauce" from this site...the two together can't be beat! My kids (5 & 9) even raved and ate every last morsel.

These were awesome! I added curry cumin garlic and chicken stock to the rice (jasmine rice) which enhanced the flavors of the chicken. The sweetness of the coconut mixed with the other flavors was so delicious!! I also served this with a Thai ginger soup that used the coconut milk instead of throwing it away.

This was very yummy. I changed it around a bit but stuck to the spirit of the recipe. I used light coconut milk to marinate because that is what was in the cupboard. I also had some cooked brown rice so I used that instead of the white. I dredged the chicken in the flour mixture but only used about 1T of oil to saute things in. I just couldn't bring myself to use the full amount. I cut back on the amount of rice in each wrap and added in some sauted cabbage. I also toasted the coconut under the broiler before I added it to the wraps. I agree this needs some sort of a sauce so I think next time I make this I may make a yogurt/sour cream sauce with sme curry and garlic or something along those lines. This was a nice change of pace for my work lunches and it froze well. Thanks.

So good! My curry was of the yellow-not-so-spicy variety so I added probably just shy of 1/4 cup of bottled Thai Chili Sauce to the chicken while it was cooking. The chicken marinated for only 45 minutes but it turned out fine. I added the coconut and green onion directly to the chicken mix when it was done cooking and used premade lime juice. I did not use anywhere near the full amount of veg. oil. Overall we thought this was tasty and very filling.

I made this recipe for my family and we all loved it! It's definately a keeper. Although I think it needs some kind of sauce so it's not so dry. Something like a Pina Colada sauce.

These were certainly interesting. Very unique. Not bad but not one of our favorites. I made a sauce that I put inside with the chicken made of pineapple cilantro red onion and plain yogurt and it seemed to marry nicely.

YUM! There is some work involved. Next time I'd like to make my rice the day before. I toasted the coconut and that gave a nice texture to the wrap. I also made a sweet and spicy aoli sauce out of mayo garlic saracha and orange marmalade.

when i was prepping this recipe i couldn't wait to eat it. and when i did i was so glad i tried this recipe. the combination of flavors make this dish so appealing to the palate. i agree with others about the pinapple sauce or salsa but it was still really good without it. you have to try this recipe!!

i thought it was great except I do think it needed a sauce. I made an easy one up with plain yogurt crushed pineapple cilantro and the green onions the recipe calls for. My whole family loved it!

We ate this up! This recipe changes up boring old chicken and we could taste the cocnut and lime shich we loved. I will try a sauce next time and add something more spicy maybe pepper flakes or jalepeno seasoning.

A great recipe. Just add more curry and some chili powder to the chicken. Also I took others' advice and made a sauce to go over the chicken (plain yogurt green onion and lime zest). If you do make the sauce definately add more heat to the chicken to battle the sweetness!

This was so good and so different from our typical dinners. We also used the Spicy Pineapple Sauce and it really made the dish. We halved this recipe and got 4 8-in wraps out of it but we didn't have enough rice and had some chicken left over. Next time I'll increase the rice by at least a 1/2 c.

The chicken strips were perfect but on a whole this recipe was a little bland even though I flavored my rice as others suggested. This definitely needs a sauce of some kind. I will make it again but with put some thought into making it tastier.

To solve the "dryness" problem I'd add the grilled pineapple slices submitted by praisegod on this site. They are delicous and would taste good in this wrap or as a side.

Wonderful Recipe! Different from anything we have ever had. I made it according to the recipe the first time and next time I will make the spicy pineapple sauce to go with it.

Didn't care for this as it was. The rice fell out of the wrap and I should have listened to other reviewers who suggested a sauce. I might try mixing the rice with a thick teriyaki sauce and maybe both my problems would be solved.

Made this last night without the shredded coconut. My family absolutely loved it. I was trying to make the salsa but the chicken was gone by the time the salsa was finished. Great recipe and we had extra green onions so we grilled those and it was perfect!

this was delicious we made the recipe to a tee. we served it up with warmed corn 6" tortillas and I think next time we might forego the wraps & just serve this over rice. lots of carbs! yummy though. curious as to what other veggies we could add to the toppings for a different twist on this easy weekday staple meal.

I strayed from the recipe a little bit for these. I made the chicken as stated but I sauteed the onions and some red bell pepper with the lime juice in the pan when I finished cooking the chicken then added that to the rice (I used Jasmine). I tried making a sauce out of crushed pineapple ginger yogurt and cilantro as another reviewer had mentioned but it turned out awful and I'm glad I kept it separate. Otherwise this was delicious. Next time I'm going to try baking the chicken instead of frying it to make it a little healthier.

I made this last night for some guests and it was phenomenal! I had the leftovers for breakfast - and then put the remaining chicken in a salad for lunch. Yum all the way.

This was really good. I didnt have any jasmine rice so I used saffron for that extra flavor and I also added more curry because its a favorite. I used yellow and a bit of red for some more kick. I think if you like the ingredients you'll really enjoy this easy meal!

This was delicious if not a lot of work. The only changes we made were adding cayenne pepper and garam masala to the breading mixture. I think the dish would do well with some sort of chili-lime sauce but all in all the various flavors blended wonderfully.

Made these for supper tonight and they were a hit! Great flavor! I did not add the coconut because I thought that it would taste too weird but everything else I kept the same. Thanks for sharing!:)

This was decent. We liked it but it was not "wow". The rice needs something it was too bland on its own. We even added the pineapple sauce from this site and it still was just okay. I would imagine it would be awfully bland without it. Overall it was good but we probably wont make this again.

We marinated the chicken with the coconut milk for 3 hrs and it still did not give it an "umph" in the taste. It was not amazing but ok.

Made this for my mom and she loved it. I didn't use the flour. Instead I poured the whole marinate in the pan with the chicken then sprinkled with the seasoning and let the chicken soak up all the coconut milk. Created more flavour.
