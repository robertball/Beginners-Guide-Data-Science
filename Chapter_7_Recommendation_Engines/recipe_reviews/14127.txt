This is a good recipe.  It does well when cut in half.  To add quickness cook squash in microwave.  Cook halves on a plate for 1 1/2 min on high.  Test every 45 sec. for tenderness.  I would suggest eating with tomato sauce.  Good without, better with!

I thought this was great!  I made a lot of changes.  I sauted the scooped out parts with the onion and garlic and omitted the spinach.  It took about 50 minutes to cook.  Anyway, it was delicious and I'll definitely make it again!

The results are very nice, but the number of pots and pans are not.

Yum!  This is one of my favorite vegetarian dishes!  I top it with plenty of warmed roasted garlic marinara sauce.  No accompanying side dish is necessary.  It works great by itself.  I would caution against overcooking the squash as it makes it watery and mushy.  This dish would also work well with some basil mixed into the spinach and mozzarella cheese on top.

The filling was fantastic, my favorite part. I added a seeded, chopped tomato, a dash of red pepper flakes, and added chopped fresh basil. I couldn't stop eating the filling while cooking. I microwaved the sqaush for 2 minutes then put it in the over for 5 minutes before adding the filling. 20 minutes before it was done I added swiss cheese to the top. Served it with fresh parmesan cheese and warm tomato sauce. Excellent, will definitely make again. Oh yeah, this dish is HUGE, you don't need any sides.

My husband raves over this one! I've made it with zucchini with equal success. I've also done some small modifications, depending on what I have on hand (mozzarella vs. parm..)
Definitely a keeper! A great way to use extra squash from the garden, or just to incorporate a different veggie into your meals!

beautiful presentation and the filling is fantastic (with minor changes).

I boiled and then baked my squash (brushed with oul and lightly seasoned with salt and paper)...however the squash was still semi-hard in some places so next time I will microwave then bake.

For the filing, I sauteed the onion, garlic, and scooped out squash with butter and olive oil...I also added one small seeded jalepeno pepper. While sauteeing I salted the veggies and then added the spinach which I salted to taste later.

We used the left over filling to make pizza and plan to use the filling for a sauceless lasagna.

Do try!

Very tasty. I baked them with meat sauce. It tasted a little like lasagna without the noodles and carbs. Served with a salad.

YUMMY!  I used 2 ( four halves) very large garden squash and then halved the other ingredients.  Lightened it up a little by using LOWFAT ricotta, sauteing the onion, etc., in olive oil with just a tiny bit of I can't believe it's not butter.  Partially cooked the squash in the microwave, then sprayed it with Parkay Butter spray.  Used my Misto to spray olive oil on the pan I was going to bake them on.  Added chopped, fresh garden basil to the spinach mixture.  Had some leftover spaghetti sauce I'd made using garden tomatoes and turkey italian sausage that I put over the top before serving.  Our plates were clean!  Thanks.

This recipe was very good.  We had it over spaghetti noodles and served garlic bread on the side.  The only thing I would do differant is cook the squash longer.  My family likes our veggies soft.

Tasty.. I didn't have any sauce though and I think it would have improved it. The filling for me does need more seasoning

Skipped the step of cooking onions and garlic and just used powder since I was in a hurry and didn't want to dirty more dishes.  Pretty good stuff!

This didn't turn out as yummy as I had hoped.  I love squash but I think another squash besides yellow would work best.  It wasn't as creamy as I wanted it.  A smoother squash would likely have made the difference because the filling was awesome.  I definitely loved that it was healthy and vegetarian.

I'm sure now why I read several reviews saying that this was good/okay without the tomato sauce but better with. The flavor in this dish is almost totally dependent on the tomato sauce. The idea of this recipe seems delicious but unfortunately it's just not for us.

I thought it was very good and it felt good not to have pasta and be healthier. I did however add a tablespoon of pasta sauce on top for my boyfriend who likes things a little less healthy ;-) and added a 6 cheese blend on top to melt on top of the sauce.

A little bland. Good way to get spinach in your diet.  Will probably make again except will try a smoked gouda cheese maybe?

Pretty good - better than I thought it would be actually.  It does taste a lot like lasagna and it's a great way to get some extra veggies.  It was a little bland on its own so it does take some doctoring.  It also takes a lot of dishes and is fairly time-consuming.

This was so delicious! I subbed butternut from the CSA, and that’s what I’ll use from now on—the sweetness worked well with the stuffing, and I liked the heartier texture. Instead of dried herbs, I used lots of fresh basil and oregano, and I used Parmesan-reggiano cheese, which has a stronger flavor. I also used fresh spinach (with some chard, because I had extra), and homemade marinara from our favorite Jersey deli. A perfect cold-weather dish!

Great idea. I boiled my squash, instead of steaming (by accident), and it still came out great. Only complaint is that there is not enough salt. Top with parmesean and broil for a minute for a crispier top.

I used Egg Beaters and part skim ricotta, and sauted the onion in Pam to reduce the fat.  It was easy and very good.  I'll be making this again.

I decided to use butternut squash because I knew the filling would fit better and I love butternut squash.  Followed another user's suggestion to steam the squash in the microwave, was a major time saver for me.  I didn't like how wasteful it seamed to scoop out part of the squash and not use it in the filling, so I added it and turned out great.  My last addition was a sprinkle of mozzarella after the squash finished baking and then popping it back in the oven to melt with the oven turned off. Definitely agree it's best with spaghetti sauce.  I can see myself making this again down the road.

I thought that this was pretty tasty just as it was! I used the yellow patty pan squash since that was what I had. Mine were so big that I increased the cooking time a bit but it was a fun change from plain steamed squash. My husband's only complaint that was he wanted this as a side not the main course.

The filling and squash tasted good but some what dry. I think I'll have to try this recipe again with some modifications. For the spaghetti sauce, I used 2 servings of "Kay's Spaghetti and Lasagna Sauce" and some left over " Simple Arrabbiata Sauce" I had in the fridge.

Very yummy. I used acorn squash which I baked face down with a little water for 15 minutes before filling. I used fresh spinach, lots of garlic, ricotta and topped with freshly grated romano and white pepper.  It took an addition 30+ minutes to cook sufficiently. I'll definitely do this one again.

this was only so-so.  I thought the stuffing was bland...maybe some feta and more parmesan might have helped.

WOW!! This is a superb recipe.  I am a huge garlic lover, so I used about 3 garlic cloves, which really gave the "stuffing" a great flavor.  Next time I am going to sprinkle motzarella over the tops of these--YUMMY

Delicious! I used butternut squash. I took advice from other reviews and microwaved the squash halves 2 at a time for 3-4 minutes before putting the mixture on to try to speed up the cooking time, but it still took an hour to get the squash  "al dente". It was worth the wait!

Cubed and browned chicken breast in butter for added protein. Removed chicken. Sauteed the garlic, onions, and spinach in the butter and chicken juices. Placed chicken pieces in the squash before covering with cheese-spinach mixture. Brushed butter and juices from the saute pan on top of the stuffed squash.

Excellent heart healthy entree that can be eaten as main dish. No need to add side dishes.  Serving size is generous as well. Highly recommend. Would add more spinach and garlic and red pepper flakes to give it a kick and can top off with  a hearty red sauce

I halved the filling recipe but still used a whole clove of garlic. It was a perfect amount for two halves of ONE yellow squash. Definitely wouldn't have made enough to fill 4 squash. I had fresh spinach on hand and used 2 big handfuls torn into smaller pieces. I put marinara sauce and 4-cheese italian blend before baking. Delicious!

I loved this recipe - it's great when you have an abundance of squash in the garden!  I left out the onion and spaghetti sauce and it was delicious.  My husband wasn't quite as crazy about it as I was, but he's more of a meat lover anyway. I served it as a main dish (which is what he didn't like) because it was fairly time-consuming to be just a side dish.

Very good; especially when you are looking for a different way to eat "squash". I didn't even use tomato sauce. The seasonings can be altered accorning to individual taste also. Quite a good recipe. Thanks

This was okay. Good base recipe but a tad bland. I think it needs some more spices. Lovely presentation though.

This is a surprisingly good way to use up squash.  The spaghetti sauce was great with it and fresh Parmesan is a must.

My husband and I liked this a lot.  I added some mozzarella and fresh grated parmesan cheese to the filling.  I also served it with a side of whole wheat spaghetti and topped it with marinara sauce.  Yum!

This was very bland and the squash was very under-done even though I steamed it for 10 minutes instead of the recommended 5.  The stuffing was fine, although pretty tasteless.  The only thing in the recipe with any flavor was the spaghetti sauce topping.  I will not make this again.

Just okay for us, used low-fat everything but needed more of a kick.  Maybe something spicey?  Anyway, heed the advice of others, don't overcook, ours was a bit runny.

A big hit with my family! Use a melon baller to scoop the seeds and pulp out (easier than using a spoon!). I used the light version of ricotta cheese and it came out perfect! Will keep this recipe and serve again!

awesome! i tried it with tomato sauce, but i'm convinced it's better without.  also, i would exclude the rice or pasta.  this squash   is a meal on its own!  delicious!

MMMMM this was so wonderful and delicious!  According to my daughter (who is 5 years old) this tastes like lasagne!!!!  I served it with lots of sauce, and it was well concealed that it was squash not noodles!  My family was thrilled with this recipe.

I found this very easy to prepare. I made my own tomato sauce, but otherwise prepared the recipe exactly as it is here.  I prefer my veggies on the crispy side, and these were perfect.  The steaming before cooking softens them up enough in my opinion.  Thumb-up from the husband also.  Will definitely make again.
