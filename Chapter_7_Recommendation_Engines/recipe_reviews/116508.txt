This was pretty good.  The only thing that I would change is the amount of liquid.  I found that it's a little dry.

Wow. This is a GREAT rice dish! I was skeptical about layering it, but it definitely works. I left out the green peppers, and I added fresh, sliced mushrooms. I used cream of mushroom soup, rather than cream of chicken. This is a really great side dish to serve with a whole, roasted chicken. There wasn't any direction on weather to use fresh or dried dill, so I opted for fresh. I think it really makes a difference in the taste... Use fresh! I don't normally prefer rice as a side, but this is wonderful.

This recipe was a real hit at the church luncheon!  It made an excellent side dish for the Artichoke Chicken recipe (also from this site).  Only a minor change: I cooked the rice in chicken stock as others have suggested, and for a little less time.  I used larger amounts of the veggies (about 1 cup of each) and used what I had--fresh peas and asparagus were a great addition of color.  Experiemnt and enjoy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband was not as keen on it but it is a great vegetarian dish and I will be making it again.

YUM! super easy & very flavorful. I added a minced clove of garlic when I sauteed the veggies, subbed cream of mushroom for cream of chicken, added some spicier peppers & sprinkled cheese on top.  Great dish, that lends itself to whatever veggies you have on hand. We'll be making this again!

I added fresh garlic & squash to the veggie's and cheese to the top. I also did wild rice instead of white. With these additions I would give this dish 5 stars.

This was very good!  I added jalepeno's to it and it had quite a kick to it, but not too much, as I'm not big on really spicy food. Will definately make it again and there are lots of leftovers!  Yummy!

This was a very flavorful dish.  We really enjoyed it.  My fresh banana pepper was not very spicy so I threw in some jalapeno cubes and it turned out just right!

awesome side dish. It goes with almost anything and is so easy to make. This will be a new favourite in our house. I added a bit of feta in the middle layer and cheddar on top :)
