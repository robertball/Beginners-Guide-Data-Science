Great recipe. I was a little skeptical about the amount of sauce, thinking it might make the noodles soggy but somehow this worked. I didn't end up adding as much of the sauce at the end but rather went by taste. Also I accidently cooked my noodles in the hot water step longer than 3 min so this would probably account for less sauce being needed. Overall great taste! I will make this again for sure.
