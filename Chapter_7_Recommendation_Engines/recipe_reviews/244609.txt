I keep getting requests for this after my first time making it. I have made my own adjustments to this to suit our needs. First, I have to double it to feed our large family. I end up using 2-3 cans of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh. I leave out the peas, and use fresh mushrooms finely chopped. I end up only using 4 peppers instead of the six I'd be using with the doubled recipe, and we use mushroom soy sauce instead of regular. I've tried the store bought lemon juice in it before, but the fresh squeezed is the best. I also take chicken thighs or chicken quarters, bone in and skin on, and toss them in the bottom of the slow cooker before putting the stuff on top of them. Later, after it's cooked for a while, I pry the bones and skin out and shred the chicken. I also add a lot more garlic than it calls for because of our love of garlic. It's very good, and I will continue to make this as long as my family requests it.

I made it pretty much as the recipe called for. I used Bragg's Aminos instead of soy sauce....tastes the same and NO sodium. I used canned peas since that's all I had and I left out the carrots because I didn't have any. the family loved it ?? Served it with cornbread.

This was a great meal. VERY Filling. I followed previous reviews and used low sodium soy sauce. I also made Uncle Ben's Wild Rice and some corn bread as sides. It smells great and tastes good too!

The family really liked. I made it according to the recipe, substituting in low sodium soy for the regular soy. We still found it to be a bit saltier than we usually cook but I was delicious just the same.

Given the lack of spices I was concerned this dish would not be spicy enough.  No worries!  As I am watching my sodium intake, I used low salt soy sauce and only used 1/3 cup of olive oil.  Nice stew. 3.5

Not great but palatable.. the ingredients are great but the slow cooking process dulls the flavors beyond their peak.. had to add a lot of salt afterwards.

This was absolutely phenomenal. I loved it! I only had regular potatoes so I used those. The flavor is so juicy and perfect! Can’t wait to make it again??

The only thing I changed was that I substituted some of the vegetables to suit my own tastes. Great flavor, but a little salty.

I really enjoyed this, as did my family. Very quick and simple to put together, but very flavorful and delicious. I used canned diced tomatoes because I didn’t have fresh on hand, and added frozen peas about 10 minutes before serving so they didn’t get mushy. The only change I would make next time is to decrease the amount of olive oil because it was slightly too oily for my taste.

The only variation from this recipe that I took was I used 3/4 cup soy sauce and didn’t add the vegetables until about two hours before it was done just because I didn’t want them reduced to mush. It was delicious over rice with cornbread!

Delicious and so easy! I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 things I didn’t have in stock: I used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and 2 Yukon gold potatoes instead of red. I cooked on low for 4.5 hours then on high for an hour because everybody was hungry! I thought it might lack flavor based on other reviews, but it was flavorful and delicious. Even better the next day. We ate it over rice the first night and over spaghetti squash the next night. Will definitely make this again. Thank you!

Made as directed except increased soy sauce and olive oil by 1/4 cup. Substituted red potatoes for brown and can of Rotel mild tomotoes w green chiles for tomatoes. Added a can of chicken broth. So flavorful and hearty. Delicious to eat alone or over white rice, just the way my Lola used to make.

Flavour is great. I got a late start and opted for the 4 hours on high. This didn’t work well. Potatoes and carrots weren’t soft.  Might be that pieces were too large. Definitely recommend using the longer time and cutting veggies about 1inch cubes max. Will definitely make again

Taste was great. On high, this needed stirring fairly often. I think next time I'll do half the liquid and cook it on low. I used a bag of chopped peppers & onions and a cup of baby carrots and that made this so quick to make. I talked it up to my 7r old and she agreed that it was "pretty good" which means she did like it, she just doesn't like to admit when I'm right.

Really good!  It tastes better after it sits for a few days and the flavors blend.  I did NOT use potatoes because I did not have any.  II used real tomatoes but I think a couple of cans of Rotel would have been tastier.  Serve it over brown rie!

It was a bit bland for my taste. But I made it for my son's family including a picky four-year-old so it was very successful and they all liked it.

So delicious! The only change I make is omitting the tomato because my husband doesn't like them but otherwise I make it just as the recipe states and it's so good! I've found the chicken stays more moist when cooked for the longer duration on low.

I made it 2 days ahead in order to give the flavors time to blend. Also, I didn't add the peas. It just didn't seem like they would enhance the dish. It was quite good.

Great recipe. Cooked in an Aroma rice cooker/slow cooker. Came out perfectly. We substituted low sodium soy sauce. If we make it again, we will probably dial down the olive oil too to reduce the fat grams per serving.

Delicious. I used low-sodium soy sauce substitute on lowsodiumcooking.com, and the whole thing turned out delish. Definitely adding to the dinner rotation.
