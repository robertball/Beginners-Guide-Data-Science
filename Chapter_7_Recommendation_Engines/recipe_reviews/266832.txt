8.3.18  There are times where simple is best, and that’s the case with this elegant dessert.  One may think this is just strawberries with whipped cream, but once you taste that topping, you know there’s something unique going on.  Although the brandy flavor is subtle, you know it’s there, and it's what makes this so special.  I added no sugar to the freshly-sliced strawberries, just put them into the dessert dishes and added a dollop of the whipped topping.  I didn’t add all of the sour cream-brandy-brown sugar mixture to the whipped cream because it was starting to thin out a bit, look a little “saucy,” and I wanted a firm whipped cream topping.  So very simple, so very easy and quick, and sooooo very good.  Steph, thanks for sharing your recipe.
