This recipe needs to be a lot better written. Do NOT use "a big pot"!  Dampfkupal is made in a larger pan, flat and wide and covered when cooking..  The variance to amount of flour can't be overstated or you get sticky glob with most all-purpose flour.  The brandy amount also needs revision as it is absent in the cooking detail, mead makes a great alternative.
Adding milk after the sugar browns creates instant hard candy, so preheat and add slowly.  This is a great recipe, but the instructions are poor.

I have made dampfnudeln many times but lost my original recipe so I used this one for the savory version.  It's spot on except I would use less yeast next time.  They were a bit too light.  I would recommend one packet of yeast for up to 12 servings.  Overall, these things are delicious and worth the effort.

I was so happy to find this recipe! We tried dampfnudel one time in Germany on our honeymoon recently, and it was so delicious, I had to try to replicate it! It came out almost EXACTLY like what we had in Germany. I did have to make a few minor adjustments, but this is a great base recipe:


1.	I had to add quite a bit more flour because the dough was very sticky. I would say I added around ½ to ¾ cup more flour during the initial mixing. Also I used the food processor to mix the dry ingredients, but then I dumped it into a bowl and used an electric hand mixer to incorporate the wet ingredients. Once the dough started getting too thick for the mixers, I mixed it with my hands and added flour until it formed a nice ball.

2.	I let it rise for an hour, it looked nice, but I was in the middle of cooking dinner, so I let it be for a while longer. After around 1.5 hours, it rose very nicely. I think I would go ahead and let it rise a little longer than an hour. 

3.	I kneaded it until it was smooth, rolled it out about an inch+ thick, and then cut 8 circles with a drinking glass. I still had some dough leftover, so I divided this up evenly and kneaded a little into each circle so all of the dough was used up. Next time, I think I’ll roll it into a log and cut 8 pieces with a knife instead, so I don’t have to re-incorporate the leftover dough. I let these rise for around 30 minutes, flipped them over, and let them rise for another 10 minutes (the bottoms seemed very sticky).

Bakery had the savory form of these one day every week, and you had to get there early every day to get one.  This recipe tastes just like those, so glad this recipe is on here
