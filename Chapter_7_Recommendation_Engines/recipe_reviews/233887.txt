If you want to make a smaller amount the recipe breaks down to 15 parts lime juice, 7 parts soy, 4 parts brown sugar, 3 parts olive oil, 1 part garlic, and 1 part red pepper flakes.

You can easily cut back WAY back on the oil by the way.  Cheers!

This is the BEST dressing yet.  I've marinated chicken and  fish with it before
grilling. Put it on "bowl" meals of salad greens, pinto beans, spanish rice, tomatoes, red onion, pico de gallo, and any other thing that strikes my fancy. This dressing gets better with time, so if spicy is not your thing, start with a lesser amount of red pepper flakes. My entire family loves it and requests it at almost every meal. - not breakfast, as yet - One daughter who lives out of state heard how great it is and requested the recipe after her sister told her how good this turned out. Thanks Amanda for a constant way to get salad and veggies on the table with loads of flavor.

I marinated steak with this and it was so good! Instead of crushed red pepper, I substituted sliced habanero peppers which added a great kick to the sauce

There was another review that suggested that the oil should be cut way back, so I made two small batches to test. Definitely cut it back. The one made according to the recipe was way too oily and the way with less was much better. I marked down the recipe because of this issue

Tasty dressing. A tip; if you don't need 7 cups of dressing (!), I scaled the recipe to 9 servings without too many weird fractions. I subbed garlic powder for fresh garlic. Also I used bottled lime juice, which fresh is no doubt tastier, but the reason I chose this recipe was to avoid going to the store :) Thanks for the recipe, Amanda Sheumaker!

This has become a family favourite, a go to recipe. I use it on the sweet kale salad from Costco. I make up enough for several servings, like a bottle of dressing worth, and we use it up quickly.

I normally prefer creamy dressings over vinegrettes, but this was quite good.  My boyfriend was crazy about it.  I did add the juice from a quarter of an orange to sweeten it up a little.  I love making dressings that are tasty and unusual and this fit the bill.

Delicious and savory/sweet!  This will go perfect with a left over steak salad for the night after steak night. Thanks!
