Followed the recipe all the way ending with a desert that was delightful which the whole family enjoyed!  Will definitely make this again.

This is a very good pie. I tried it the second time doing the lower fat version of 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 2% milk, Smart Balance peanut butter, and margarine ( and my husband through in another 1/4 cup or so of Skippy) and it was still good but the consistency was softer. So I make it the standard recipe way, after all it is once a year for his birthday.

Hmm, definitely a good recipe. Unfortunately you stole this recipe off line from Kraft foods. Cool that you did, but if I were you I'd give credit where credit is due...definitely not to you! Great recipe Kraft!! Only 1 star since it's a stolen recipe.
