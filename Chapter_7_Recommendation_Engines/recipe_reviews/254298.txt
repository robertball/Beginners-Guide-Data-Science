I used chocolate frosting to cover and give a bit of sweetness.  I'm not good at frosting so my stuff looks funny, but tastes yummy ??

Very, very messy! Be careful as in the microwave it might soon spill over. We had a low-watt microwave, yet it still went over! It's easy to make the batter/frosting, though, and it tastes very good. You just have to forget what it  looks like coming out of the microwave. Don't make it if you want your food looking absolutely perfect!
