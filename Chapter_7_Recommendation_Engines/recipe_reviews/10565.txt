I liked this recipe but I make a few changes to it.  Instead of the hard boiled egg, I substituted shredded coconut for flavoring inside the cookie.  I didn't make the full braids instead just patted out regular cookies and at times making shapes like trees, snowmen, stars, and hearts.  They went over so great that I only got 1 out of the entire batch.

Tasted quite good - I didn't make the braids, just twisted two strands together 'crown' style.  Lots less frustrating that way.

It's pretty good, but it takes a long time and is frustrating.
