I used to have lunch at California Pizza Kitchen and have missed the flavor of their BBQ Chicken Salad.  This is it!  Wonderful dressing - sweet from the BBQ sauce but tangy from the ranch dressing.  It's also good as a dressing for chicken breast sandwiches.  Thanks.

This was good, but I LOVED it with a SPICY,not honey-sweet,  BBQ sauce SO MUCH MORE. I used Bob Evans Wildfire BBQ sauce. OUTSTANDING! (and it tastes like the dressing that is on their restaurant's Chicken Wildfire Salad).

We use this delicious dressing to bind together a quick, yummy, and complete meal in salad-form.  Cook up a couple of cups of tri-color pasta shells.  Drain, rinse, and mix them together with black beans, corn and green onions (scallions).  Throw together mixed baby greens, fresh spinach, chunks of avocado and halved-cherry tomatoes.  Crush a couple of cups of tortilla chips on top, add this BBQ-Ranch dressing and, you're set with a hearty, healthy meal.

This was delicious and easy!  I used jalapeno ranch and regular BBQ sauce.  (We mixed it with a can of mixed beans and chopped tomatoes for a quick and tasty salad).  Yum!

I was truly surprised at how much I enjoyed this dressing.  I diced up two leftover chicken breasts I had grilled with BBQ sauce.  Tossed that into some spinach and romaine along with some black beans, diced tomatoes and avocado.  Very yummy summer meal that I am sure we will make again.

Yummy!  I used 1/2c. spicy ranch dressing and cut the bbq sauce to 1/4c.  For the salad:  Romaine lettuce, black beans, corn, and Monterey Jack cheese.

Easy and delicious!  I grilled chicken tenders, sprinkled with southwest seasoning, tossed with mixed greens, white corn, jack/cheddar cheese, and baked tortilla strips.  The dressing really brought the salad together - Thank You!

I am so glad I came upon this technique for yummy dressing.  I mixed equal parts (1/2 cup) light ranch dressing and sesame ginger bbq sauces, then got crazy and added 1 tsp wasabi sauce. Yum!

I loved how easy this was. I was looking for a dressing that used the few ingredients I had on hand. I think it would be great with a chipotle style bbq.

Super easy dressing.Needed a quick dressing for a southwest meal and this fit the bill. Threw together a salad with some romaine, canned corn, canned black beans, avocado, and crushed tortilla chips. This dressing was wonderful.

It was a little thick for our liking, so I added some skim milk and sour cream.

I am not a big fan of Ranch dressing but I needed dressing for a mexican salad so I gave this a try. It was great on the salad. So easy and tasted great.

Brings something special to the dinner table without any effort. I used a delicious, but potent, spicy honey bbq sauce. It overwhelmed the ranch. Next time, I will do a 2:1 ratio of ranch to bbq. I think this will give it a smoother taste.

Two ingredients and a perfect dressing?  YES!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hot and Spicy BBQ sauce, regular ranch and then added some honey to the final product.  Went perfectly with the chicken, black bean and corn mixture that I had leftover from another recipe.  Thanks!

I'll try again but I will lower the BBQ vs the Ranch.  Maybe 1 Cup ranch to 3/4 cup BBQ.  The BBQ will decrease until I find where it is just right for me.

This made a yummy, easy, and quick dressing/sauce. Hubby didn't like it, but I thought it tasted wonderful on my chicken burger. I did think that the ranch/bbq ratio was off somewhat, and next time I will use less bbq and more ranch. Thanks for sharing.

A++ I was looking for a quick, good dressing. All my family loved this one.  I cut back a little on the BBQ sauce tho.
