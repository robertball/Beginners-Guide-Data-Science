Excellent recipe. The batter is super moist and if not, you likely forgot the eggs or coconut oil. I substituted about half of a cup of Truvia for the honey. This made the raw batter taste a little off but was delicious once baked. Also, I used a 8x8 glass dish and these were very " skinny" brownies. I would probably double the recipe next time. The baking times is accurate. Nice crispy/flaky top like wheat flour brownies. Give these a try.

I have made other gluten free brownies and I thought these were pretty good. I followed the recipe, except for the coconut oil I used half vegetable oil and half butter with canola oil. I didn't want them overly sweet, so I subbed half the honey with coconut sugar. I added the optional walnuts and highly recommend that. I lined an 8" pan with heavy duty foil and sprayed with Baker Joy spray. The lifted right off the foil. I got 16 brownies. ty

I thought it might be a little weird with the honey, but it is fine. Also thought maybe more cocoa would be wanted, but 5 T is more than enough for this.

Followed the recipe exactly, and these are fantastic! Unsure as to what others did wrong, as these were moist and delicious. Would go perfectly with vanilla ice cream! Cake pan size was awkward tho, and I baked in what I had which was a typical square 9x9 cake pan. They were perfect after the full 25 minutes. Will definitely make these again and again!

This came out quite crumbly. Not sure if it's because I only had ? cup of honey, maybe I should have added something else? Another egg, more almond  flour? Had to add another 10 minutes to the 20 I originally  baked them at.

Just loved it!! I didn't have honey, so I used 1/3 cup xylitol granules. Also I have Black Cocoa from King Arthur and I used 1 T of it and 4 of the regular cocoa. Extra richness!

I personally didnâ€™t need the amount of honey in this. I like butter chocolate. To make the batter moist enough I added almond milk.

My son wanted brownies tonight after his hockey game and this was the winner to make. I followed the directions to as instructed; I was a little suspicious at first at how liquefied the batter was, however, depending on your stove, I had to bake ours for 30min in an 8x8 glass pan and it turned out great! They were so easy to cut and so moist. I loved them. Easy treat to take on the go and good with ice cream! My husband only suggestion is to add chocolate chips next time, ha! Will definitely make again!

These were so good.  I doubled the recipe and baked in an 8X8 pan.  I didn't have coconut oil so I used veg oil.  They are so chocolatey and delicious without the refined sugar.

This recipe was just ok.  I would not make it again.  It was moist but not flavorful.  Liquid ingredients separated from dry during baking - I think perhaps the honey?  I ended up with a layer of wet caramel on the bottom of the pan.  I have baked MANY gluten free recipes and have NEVER experienced that.

These are very good and quite easy to make. The textute is a bit chewy and serms like a regular brownie. Thank you for the recipe.
