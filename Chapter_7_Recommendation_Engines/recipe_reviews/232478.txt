I chose this recipe because my husband loves all these ingredients individually, but neither of us was impressed with the end result.  Contrary to the receipe title, I did not find this very quick to prepare and all the yummy, and pricey, ingredients were lost in a sea of noodles at the end.  I also had some issues with the cheese: the thinly sliced provolone didn't agree with the other ingredeints shape-wise and the grated asiago became a little clumpy when tossed in with the dressing.  I could see these ingredients transformed into a very yummy sandwich, though - just substitute bread for noodles and reduce the vinegar to a splash once assembled.

YUM! The only issue that I had (and it was my own personal preference) was that it was a bit too vinegar-y for me, but I will know to reduce that next time. I didn't measure any of the add-ins, just did everything to taste. LOVED the fresh basil in this! Oh, I didn't have any asiago on hand, so I used parmesan, which was great. This was a nice, different pasta salad, that I will def be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)

It is delightful!  It can be prepared ahead of time, customized (I love basil, so I went a little overboard with it, and I did use white wine in place of red wine vinegar, but those are personal preferences).  The recipe, just as it is, is fabulous!  I will be making this quite often!  It certainly can be substituted for a light meal during our long, hot summers...thank you.

I used 1/2 cup of mozzarella cubes instead of the provolone. Next time I'm going to double the amount of artichoke hearts (wife likes those the best). I changed the olives to Lindsay green olives sliced in half and used a half a can.  I just used about a teaspoon of dried basil and a teaspoon of dried oregano instead of the fresh basil. I mixed all the ingredients together before I mixed in the vinaigrette. I think that makes sure everything doesn't clump together. Turned out really great!

I really liked this recipe!  I usually take the easy route and just use a bottle of zesty Italian dressing.  However, this is definitely better.  Thank you for sharing!

I added chicken and made this for a big party and everyone just loved it.  The great thing about this is you can add anything and it is delicious.
