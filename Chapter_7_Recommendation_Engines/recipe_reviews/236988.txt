This was exceptional! I added a little extra garlic but otherwise made as-is. The wife commented that this was the best stew she has ever had. I am certainly not going to wait for St, Patrick’s day to make again. Chef John’s Irish Stew with Lamb is on the radar too. Going to be tough to top this one though.

Served it to company on St. Patty's Day Eve, without first trying the recipe - which is something I never do.  And everyone was delighted that I did!  It was FANTASTIC!  I had nearly 6 pounds of meat, and adjusted the recipe to suit.  We (okay, 'I') just finished the last of the stew a few moments ago.  My son even had it for breakfast after pulling an 'all nighter' for college.  I had to promise my family that I'll make it again very soon.  WELL WORTH MAKING.  I did read one review that gave this recipe a lower rating because it contained alcohol, which honestly doesn't make any sense to me.  If you don't like the alcohol, then use an alcohol free beer - don't give a wonderful recipe a bad rap.  Anyway - please try this recipe.  And definitely watch the video, too.  Enjoy! :-)

Delicious Stew and very easy to make, I just have to say to all those saying they don't like the idea this has alcohol in it, if that's what you think then your cooking education is lacking. Yes you put beer in it but by the time it's done ALL traces of Alcohol have long evaporated away. There is no alcohol in the finished dish.

Delicious!  Made the recipe exactly as written and we all loved it.   Next time, however, I plan to roast the brussels sprouts before adding them to the stew rather than boiling them as the recipe calls for.  I personally just don't care for the taste of boiled brussels sprouts and I think roasting them would give them a depth of flavor that would go wonderfully with the stew.

Absolutely delicious.. Couldn't have been happier with the way it turned out. I all-way like to made the recipe once as written, the way the chef did it. But I love it wend someone do the recipe with alterations, I too can't leave anything alone! I have to play with my food. You did adjusted it to your personal taste that what I like, to see what others have did to any improvements and/or variations you make to this simple recipe. I use 3 pounds lamb shoulder chops a little extra garlic but otherwise made as-is. I did read one review that gave this recipe a lower rating because it contained alcohol, You can substitute 1-1/2 cups chicken stock. YES I DO SEE this is on the radar too. Going to be tough to top this one though. I did adjusted to my personal taste. Your way is very delicious. The next time I did it and I add it to my recipe box and to My Note: My family loved bouth ways, and I'll be making this a lot more. Both are delicious, it's a matter of what your taste is....I now have two ways to this. YOU HAVE SUCCESS!! with me. Now I can do my happy food dance!!  Thank you!!! Happy Cooking to you and y'all!

I used "country style ribs" and omitted the caraway seed. The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful. I also used small wedges of cabbage instead of sprouts. My family and guests raved. Thanks, Chef John!

Just made this last night. One word to describe it:  AMAZING!!  Best stew ever!!! The Brussels sprouts give it an extra texture and flavor that was just yummy! Will definitely be making this often. Only next time, I will add more carrots, celery, and definitely more Brussels sprouts.

This was killer stew. I made it exactly as written and it will be my new St. Patrick's Day meal from now on! I never did like corned beef or shepherd's pie. This is insanely delicious! Thanks John, I'm a big fan!

You know when you eat something that is so good you insist others taste it....well that is how I feel about this stew. I wanted to keep eating but got full and will have to wait till morning to have more.  I didn't have caraway seeds and halved the balsamic only because I'm not a big fan of it.   This recipe is going to be a regular feature at our house!

Fantastic dish for St Paddys day with a little twist on the seasonings.    I loved the caraway , and serving it over mashed potatoes reminded me of shepherds pie.   It's a keeper!!!

Oh yum!  I have never poured soup over mashed potatoes before, and we loved it!  The family looked at me strange as I instructed them to do it but they loved it!  Perfect St. Patrick's Day dinner!!!

This stew was delicious! We enjoyed it even more left over. I followed the recipe exactly except for two things  – we don't like the flavor of caraway seeds so I  omitted them. Also I saw no reason to cook the Brussels sprouts separately - why mess up another pot! I simply added them about 10 to 15 minutes before the end of the cooking time. I am making this again this weekend.

Once again Chef John, excellent recipe.  Did exactly as instructed and no changes and it was really, really good.  Time was a little off.  Mine needed about 3.5 hours but it was awesome. Thanks!

This is the second batch I've made this LONG Winter and by far it's the best stew I've ever had!  I doubled the serving size so I can share with my Irish bachelor friends!!! They always return the Tupperware bowls when finished and keep coming back for more!!! Thank you Chef John!

My family loved it so much they requested I make it for company we had over.  I didn't add the brussel sprouts which I'm sure would have made it better but I know some folks don't care for them.

Chef John did it again! Definitely worth the time spent. I followed the recipe exactly. My husband said its restaurant quality. The only thing I would change is maybe use a leaner cut of pork or mix the pork shoulder with pork loin. I had to skim out about a cup of fat while stew was simmering. This recipe still deserve 5 stars though. Thank you chef john!

5 stars for taste but this was kind of a pain in the but t make. My whole family loved it and it was delicious over the mashed potatoes. We haven had stew that way. This cut of meat was very fatty so took a long time to cut and prepare. I left out the caraway seeds and used Budweiser instead of dark beer since that is what we had. The brussels sprouts were so good and very tasty in the stew. It seemed there was a ton of meat and not enough veggies but I'm not sure I'll be taking the time to make this again. I think most of the pots in the kitchen were dirty when I was done!

This was so great. My husband and I taste tested the sauce kinda at the beginning of cooking.  We both looked at each other like...are we going to have to order pizza tonight? And then it's like a little leprechaun came in and made it delicious! Even my kids liked it.  Will definitely make again. No substitutions needed!!

I didn't have caraway seeds, so I used dill seeds. Also, I didn't have quite enough beer, so I finished it out with Pinot Noir. Vey Irish, I know. ;) Anyway, I think it was a strong enough recipe to withstand my necessary changes, and everyone raved about it!

This is a great recipe! I added about 1/4 tsp more caraway seeds as well as Cayenne pepper to give it some heat. I was short on time, so I cooked the meat covered on the medium setting for 1hr and 15 minutes. The meat was very tender. I omitted the mashed potatoes. This would also complement some steamed rice!

This was amazing!! My family, including my very picky 17 y.o. daughter, loved it.  I did omit the Brussel sprouts from the pot because I'm the only one who loves them,but I followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  I just added the sprouts to my bowel, and I think my family is crazy for not loving them too, LOL!! I was told this is a "keeper" recipe, so I will definately make it again. This , like so many other Chef John recipes, is another hit! Thanks

AMAZINGLY GOOD! I planned this recipe over a two week period. I didn't have any caraway seeds, bay leaves or Irish beer. It's not a cheap stew. I used country boneless ribs because they were cheaper. After preparing this meal without brussel sprouts, I used about 2 cups of shredded cabbage. I added a tsp.of sugar while cooking and it enhanced the entire meal. I cooked it for 2 hrs. and my family said they felt like they were in an Irish restaurant. They practically licked their bowls. Even the picky 10 yr. old asked for 2nd. Since, I have the herbs, I will cook this again and again.

Chef John, I just recently started watching your videos, and I am a convert. My family is very impressed with my renewed love of cooking. I love the recipes, and watching how everything comes together. Thank you so much. Please, keep them coming!

Up-to-date comments: I made this stew today, as promised, and it was magnificent. I was afraid that the pork would not become tender, but it was very tender indeed. I'm just sorry that winter is over because I can't make it very often now...more of a winter meal. It was definitely a triumph in my house. My husband and family loved it and were very impressed. Thanks again, Chef John, for a winner!

Absolutely delicious!  The pork had a great flavor and was so tender.   Followed recipe - needed to add 1 more cup of broth and threw in some thyme.  Used Sam Adams beer.  Wicked good with the mashed potatoes on the bottom.  Will make again and add in more veggies - the little cabbages were a great addition!    Yummy in my tummy!

This is a regular in my cold weather rotation. It is delicious and versatile. You can use pork or beef and really any type of broth. I am pretty heavy handed with the vegetables (Brussels sprouts especially) and there is enough liquid in the stew to not feel crapped or over crowded.

The best pork stew in ages. And I come from "stew country". Made it as is and was super delicious. Next time however will cook only 1 - 1.5 hrs. I think 2 hrs was too much. Also, I added the Brussels sprouts 10 min before the stew was done and loved it. Thank you Chef John. Staple in our house!

What a great stew recipe!!! Made it on a cold, snowy day and it was the perfect dinner. Only change I made was to add two more carrots, more Brussels sprouts (we love veggies) and a little more flour for a thicker sauce. Otherwise don’t change a thing- can’t wait to make for our kids.

This is wonderful and other than needing to add broth during the second hour of cooking, I made the recipe as is. This is such an interesting way to serve Brussels sprouts. I’m eating low carb and so didn’t serve the stew with mashed potatoes, but the addition of Brussels sprouts made the stew substantial enough to eat on its own.

I made this entire recipe in our Cast Iron Dutch ovens and boiled the brussle sprouts in our cast iron deep fat fryer.  Absolutely wonderful flavors, rich and hearty.  The brussle sprouts had an amazing crunch that added some nice texture. I love how Irish Stout was present at the end of each bite and complemented every single ingredient. I might try adding in some halved whole mushrooms next time to add another level of flavor and texture.   I did have to add in some slurry made with flour and Water to thicken the gravy some more but other than that followed the recipe to the letter.  Thank you for such a wonderful treat with tastes of the Emerald Isle.

Excellent.  Cut the recipe in half...and used a little less caraway as my DH finds the taste overpowering.  Also browned the Brussel sprouts for better flavor.  This was very good.  I plan to make this for the family for St Patrick's day...perhaps a side of colcannon...and some scones....Yum!  Thanks for this recipe.

I used the Robust Porter from Smuttynose Brewing company instead of Guinness (which i guess would make it an English pork stew rather than Irish), and used a picnic shoulder cut instead of Boston Butt (not by choice, my grocery never sells Boston Butt), and I roughly scaled up the recipe to accommodate the ~3.2lb of meat from the boneless picnic shoulder. I was pretty liberal with the salt, and if i make this again I will probably use a little less salt. 
It came out very flavorful and the pork was exceptionally tender, the Robust Porter gives it a nice flavor. This one is definitely a keeper.

My whole family loved it! I did make a few changes...added three small potatoes, diced, and used some 1 tsp thyme instead of the bay leaf (mine had gone stale). Also used 2 tsp dried parsley instead of fresh as I could not find any to buy at this time of year. Family asked me to make again, so I'll try to follow exactly next time.

I love Chef John and this recipe did not disappoint. No caraway seeds in my cupboard so omitted those and used a light lager I had on hand instead of a dark stout. Still so incredibly delish! My incredibly picky teen loved it, especially that amazing sauce.

I have made this probably a dozen times since finding the recipe. Exactly as written and with adjustments. 

Very delicious on its own. Nothing I have done to it made it "better" but the stew is a great vehicle for all kinds of additions/adjustments. 

Peas, pearl onions, mushrooms and parsnips added.
Doubled garlic.
Tripled garlic.
Bacon fat instead of butter to saute the onions. 
Pork lion dredged in flour ended up with literally melt in mouth chunks at the end.
I don't keep caraway seed around and have had to omit a few times, still comes out good.
Forgot the bay leaf once. Still tasty.
Newcastle is amazing in this. Better than Guinness IMO. Every batch but the first 2 I experimented and it's never been bad.

The one thing I changed permanently was how the meat and veg cook. Steps 1-5 are the same but I leave the veg out of 5 and cook for 30 w/ just the onions, beer, and meat. Then dump in all the veggies and cook for 1 hr. Then make your potatoes while the stew still cooks. By the time they're done, so is the stew.  Gives the veggies more texture which is my preference. Onions will probably dissolve if done this way so make sure to add a few more in step 5. Or use pearl onions.

I don't like the taste of beer in my food. I thought the recipe was too bitter. I might try making it again with using beef broth instead of the chicken/beer broth mixture. I thought the brussels and pork shoulder turned out really good. The taste was definitely better the next day.

I'm always looking for new stew recipes and this one was great! Had all the veggies we love and the gravy was excellent! Instead of serving it on mashed potatoes, I added chunks of yellow Yukon potatoes and served it with a crusty loaf of bread. Yummy! Will definitely make again- and again.

Very delicious and we really enjoyed the flavor of  brussel sprouts and caraway seeds in the stew - something I've never added before.  I used beef instead of pork, but I'm sure we'll love it with pork, too.  This recipe is a keeper!  It's comfort food at its best!

Made this on St. Patrick's Day, & my family loved it!  I did make a couple changes, though.  I used beef broth instead of beer, cabbage instead of brussel sprouts, and I used some shredded pork I already had cooked.

I didn't add balsamic vinegar or the bay leaf and instead of cooking it on top of the stove, I baked it in a 400 degree oven for two hours. The meat was very tender and my family really liked it but I didn't care for it. This stew was very easy and I may try again, this time with beef.

I made it with the same ingredients, only adjusted for quantity and I didn't have the same beer. My wife immediately all me to print the recipe so she could save it in her files. I will definitely be making this again.I did use a homemade chicken broth, both a shoulder and a small sirloin. I used almost three beers, they were all dark and one contained honey. I am a fan of garlic, so I added about 4 cloves to the amount.

I made the recipe exactly as stated except caraway seeds, due to allergy. Maybe that's why, but it needed something else...it just didn't taste 'complete'. I'll definitely make it again, but I'll have to think on some sort of tweak.

I don't like beer so I wasn't too keen on trying this recipe.  However, after reading all the glowing reviews I thought I'd give it a chance.  I'm I glad I did.  This was delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing the stew recipe is great as written.

The recipe called for it to be reduced to medium low and cook for 2 hours.  I reduced the heat to low and cooked for 40 minutes before checking it.  The stew was burning and the carrots were mushy and the celery evaporated.  I followed the recipe precisely but it caught on fire.  The liquid was all that remained intact.

A rich stew that was perfect for a Sunday. My only modification was cooking potatoes in the stew instead of making mashed potatoes separately. This greatly increased the volume of stew, requiring a full quart of chicken stock. However, after 2 hours of simmering, it still had loads of flavor.

Very tasty. The caraway seeds give it a great flavor but don't over do them as a small amount can go a long way.

I personally didn’t like the bitter flavor the Guinness added to this stew. I will make it again but with either a lighter beer, or no beer.

Always trust chef john

Honestly if you don't like this stew I'd say that's on you - either you made a mistake or you don't like one of the ingredients. If you do it anything close to as stated you end up with tender pork, perfect veg, and a rich pub-style gravy.

You will notice immediately after you put it in how essential the balsamic is to this though; I would say for all the variations you can do w/ meat, veg, beer, broth, fat, it won't be the same without the vinegar.

Hard to believe I've never reviewed this recipe. It was my first Chef John recipe and it rocks. Both my husband and I grew up on Hamburger Helper, Shake and Bake, etc. I was much better than that, but far, far from where I am now as a cook. It opened a whole new world. 

This is one of my first cool weather recipes of each and every year, and every time, we love every bite.

We made this last night and it was awesome!  We used country style boneless pork ribs, extra garlic, extra Brussels' sprouts.
Instead of boiling the Brussels' we sauteed them in olive oil until crisp on the edges and then added them and the other veggies with about 30 minutes remaining. - we like our vegetables a little on the al dente side.  We kept the sauce true to the recipe.  It was delicious.  Can't wait to make it again.

I used Sierra Nevada's IPA because I didn't want to buy a 6 pack of Guinness and it still tasted amazing. I think a darker stout or porter would definitely add to the flavor though, but it is so good. Cut up some russett's and boiled til soft then mashed and poured stew over it. Didn't get crazy with my mashed potatoes except to add butter. I followed recipe as written. Had to add more chicken stock. Turned out wonderful. Thank you!

Very good stew.  I never thought that Brussel sprouts would be so good in a stew.  Plan to add them to other stews in the future.

Used a light German beer instead of the dark and it worked fine. Also cooked the pork stew meat in the broth, beer, garlic and onions mix for one hour, and then added cubed potatoes and remaining vegetables to the stew.

This stew is incredible! The mashed potatoes soaking in the stew are my favorite part - so delicious. The only change we made was cooking the brussel sprouts separately, and we sauteed them. Brussels are kind of smelly (especially when boiled) and we didn't want the stew to take on that smell. They also didn't hold up well in the reheat for leftovers, so we make a fresh batch each time.

Loved this dish!  I made it exactly as written but I had a little over 3 lbs of pork shoulder and I just decided to used it all.  I worked out just fine.  I think I like this more than Irish beef stew  with Guiness that I made for St. Paddy's day.

Very delicious.  I used more veggies than the recipe called for.  I also thickened the sauce with a tablespoon of corn starch stirred into a little of the liquid, then added to the pot.  The caraway seeds were a subtle but important addition.

Omitted the caraway because we don't like the flavour, and the Brussel sprouts because our kids don't like them. Despite these changes it was fabulous. Next time we will add the sprouts. The meat was fork tender and the gravy rich. We served the stew on whipped russet potatoes.

This was very tasty! Next time I will make with pork shoulder instead of pork chops and add in sprouts a little sooner so they can absorb more stew flavor. No changes needed to recipe!

I made this tasty dish this evening for dinner.  It lit up our home with a lovely scent the entire time it was cooking.  I didn't add the brussels sprouts since I didn't have any on hand.  Otherwise, it was absolutely wonderful.  I would certain make it again.

I loved the recipe but I thought the Balsamic vinegar taste was too strong.  Next time I’ll use half the amount

This stew was great! The only suggestion I have is to buy a pint of the Guinness so you can add the 12 ounces and still have some left to sip. With the caraway seeds and stout it is almost like having rye bread with the stew. Great job Chef John and thank you!

I used half apple cider vinegar with the mother for the health benefits. Used regular cabbage instead. Ate it with homemade sourdough. I also was lazy and just threw in the entire 4 pounds of pork and just let it fall off the bone, so I shouldn’t really rate the recipe since I changed it, but I get the point.

Ahhhhmazing!  I added more garlic, MUST use a dark ale, and although I love Brussels sprouts not everyone does so I cooked them and left them on the side.
Serve with crusty bread and a pint...enjoy!

Absolutely fabulous! Made recipe "as is" and it was wonderful. Be sure your sprouts are almost completely cooked. Next night we cooked up some red potatoes to add to it as a variation on the potato theme. Definitely a keeper! Oh, be sure to watch the video and go to Chef John's website as, per usual, Allrecipes tends to cut some of the spices.

Thank you Chef John, this was a great meal even in the springtime.  Used only 1 lb Pork Stew meat instead of the 2 1/2 pork shoulder.  Simmered the stew for 1 1/2 hrs instead of the 2 hours recommended.   Tasted delicious and I will add this recipe to the "do again soon" list.

Holy cow, is this good!!  I made only a couple of changes... I used pork butt instead of shoulder because that was all the butcher had.  I then trimmed a ton of fat off of it, and used a kitchen scale to get to 2.5 lbs.  I also added 1 extra carrot and celery stalk, and threw in a few more brussels sprouts, just because veggies are good for you.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out fantastic.  And it's even better as leftovers!

I'm not entirely sure what went wrong as I followed the instructions exactly. While the pork was tender, the stew came out more as a sauce as the instructions made it reduce to a vinegary mess. If I try this again, it will need to serious retooling.

Exceptional!  Loved the combination of flavors.  I didn't have caraway seeds so I substituted Anise seeds (.5 tsp).  The family loved it, my teenage son left no leftovers.

Will definitely make it again. Even the wife liked it and she's not big on beer or balsamic vinegar, but even she agreed that the mix worked very well together. Easy to put together and delicious to eat.

I'm a great fan of Brussels Sprouts and fortunately so is the rest of my family so when I saw this recipe used them I had to give it a go. Everybody liked it very much as did I, it had a mildly sweet flavor from the vegetables that complemented the very tender pork chunks all perfect on top of the bowl of mashed potatoes and I already have requests to make this one again in the future. The only deviation I made was to add an additional stalk of celery and another carrot plus a few extra sprouts.

Fantastic,  for some reason I was out of caraway and used a couple anise pods and pork loin instead of shoulder. Still  was amazing.   This will be a regular pork stew for me.

I make this in the crock pot and it turns out great. The only change I make is adding some cornstarch mixed with water at the end to thicken the stew and serve over white rice. This is perfect for a weeknight dinner and tasty enough for guest.

I didn't care for the mashed potatoes in the bowl as directed the recipe.  Would have preferred cubed potatoes in the stew.  Also I think mushrooms and green pepper would have added to the stew.

Made this for the 1st time tonight and it was fantastic!!!   Only thing I did different was add 2 tbsp of corn starch about 30 minutes before finishing to thicken up the sauce since the 1tbsp of flour wasn't doing it.  My son ate Brussels sprouts and liked them for the 1st time!!    I'll definitely be making this again before the end of winter.

pork was absolutely amazing with this broth. Just fell apart with my fork. I used beef broth instead. Even my family enjoyed the brussel sprouts in this.

Simply the best!
Didn't have the sprouts or the beer, so I substituted with sweet potatoes and a hard apple cider.   I added extra broth, and served with the mashed potatoes on the side.    Unbelievable flavor!

Yes, I would make this again. I bought  some pork stew meat this morning on sale and was looking for something like turnips to add but then I bought brussels sprouts instead. The changes I made were I browned the pork in some lard I'd rendered a few days ago.  Also, I didn't have balsamic vinegar or brown beer so I added a little Worcestershire sauce and Jamesons (tm). I cooked it for 1.5 hours because I like the pork to have more chew. Considering I had to adapt a little bit it was very good. But I did add more water than Chef John recommended and should have kept to it as the broth was a bit thin. I love the brussels sprouts in this; it hits the spot, goes so well with the dish.  I thought to add cubed potatoes to the stew, but I am glad I skipped it and will go with spooning it over mashed. I  also put on top of egg noddles with parsley and butter. Already have the ingredients to make it again.

This is amazing. My family requests it often. I usually use pork loin because it's lower in fat and is often on sale so it's really economical. Make sure to get a nice browning on the meat. it really brings out the flavor. I accidently forgot the Brussels sprouts once and really missed them. Don't skip the mashed potatoes. A little goes a long way to add another level.

This stew is simply delicious.  The only change I made is subbed chicken broth for beer.  I have never had Brussels sprouts in a stew and they just helped to put it over the top.  I steamed the sprouts rather than boil and then added at the end as the recipe stated.  I will be making this stew frequently and not just for St. Patrick's...it's too good for just once a year.

Fantastic recipie!  Made it for a family birthday supper and everyone loved it.  Only thing I changed was to slow roast in the oven instead of cooking it on the stove for the final step (300 degrees for 3 1/2 hours) which was a matter of convenience. Everyone loved the bright colours and the Brussels sprouts were a hit!

This was delish!!!   A little time consuming but soooooo worth it. My family's new favourite stew.  Made EXACTLY as written.  Meat was so tender and flavourful.  Next time I'm making with a cheap cut of beef.  Thanks Chef John.

This is the 2nd time I've made this and it was even better this time. It was one of the few times my husband hasn't asked for dessert -- he was too full - LOL . I bought a 4-1/2 lb boneless pork shoulder (that is the smallest the store had) and cut off almost all of the fat. I probably ended up with 2-1/2 lbs of all meat. In Chef John's video he included the fat; but my version was just  as tasty and more diet friendly. Also, I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts, but in this dish I loved them. Simply delicious!!

Almost no stews get a 5 from me, but this was very good. I don't like Brussels sprouts, so used cabbage, and over rice instead of potato, which made it better in my view. I'm definitely willing to make this again.  Oh, drizzling balsamic vinegar on the final served product  also improved it.

Awsome!!! I loved it although my family didn't care for the Brussel Sprouts. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will just leave the Sprouts out and make a side of cabbage.

This was fantastic! It was time consuming to make but well worth it! I followed the recipe exactly except I put it in the crockpot instead of simmering it on the stove for 2 hours. The pork was very tender. Will definitely be making this again!

This was a bit more work than I am used to doing, but it got rave reviews from the family, so well worth it.  I could not find brussell sprouts or baby cabbage, so made Rumpeldethumps colcannon with the potatoes and it came out great.

Great, will make again and no changes.   However, I wanted to comment on the shoulder pork cut.  I spent 25 min trimming fat, don't know if I had a substandard cut or what.   However, I would not recommend using a leaner cut.  The beer and the caraway seeds made the recipe stand out for me.

I've made this recipe several times.  Everyone loves it.  Do not omit the Caraway seed. They marry with the dark beer and onions to impart an amazing flavor. This stew is incredibly delicious the next day or so.  Now I make it couple of days in advance of a dinner party.  I serve the Brussels sprouts on the side so they do not detract from the delicate  flavor of the stew.  Thank you Chef John.

I am usually one to add extra things to my recipes , however I decided to followed this one completely. I am generally not a stew fan either but this was quite delicious. I am also not a fan of alcohol but I think the  Guiness My entire family loved it and will probably make this our new Sunday evening dinner from now on.

According to my hubby, who loves Irish stew, he thinks it is good.However, I did not add celery n brussels sprouts because my daughter don't like them.As I ran out of balsamic vinegar, I used grape vinegar.On a cold day, this dish tastes very good.

Nice winters day meal. Even my two year old niece loves it. I didn't have any beer so just added more broth. Also no celery so replaced with with anise plant. The veggies are so flavorful. We had it with mash potatoes and leftovers over rice. yummy both ways.

I increased the garlic to 4 cloves and used beef broth because that was what i had in the pantry.  
BEST STEW EVER!  
We ate it 2 nights in a row.  Hubby didn't even complain about eating leftovers.  I am sharing this recipe with all my friends on facebook.  Will definitely be making it again.

This was really good.  It had a much richer flavor than I expected.   It was a lovely combination of the dark beer fullness coupled with the slight bitterness of the Brussel sprouts and the flavorful pork.  The mashed potatoes put it over the top.  The only slight change I made was to leave out the caraway seeds which I did not have.

This is one of the best recipes I have tried!  It will now be a go to winter meal!  Absolutely amazing!  The balsamic vinegar and Guiness was a perfect marriage.

I made this recipe and thought I was going to love it, however, it turned out bitter.  I'm not sure if it was the Brussels Sprouts or the Guinness, but next time I'm going to use cabbage and Obsidian Stout.  I browned the pork on our Traeger grill and it turned out perfectly.  Definitely will make again with the adjustments above.

This is delicious! I make it year round! I was skeptical at first because I kept tasting it as it was cooking. It has to cook for a long time to marry the flavors! One of my all time favorites!

This was delicious. I used boneless country spare ribs. I didn't have caraway seeds so I used 1/4 teaspoon of Chinese 5 spice. I added parsnips to my vegetable mix. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.
