I used 2 medium red delicious apples(all I had on hand)  Took the apples unpeeled and half a lemon rind and threw it into my food processor.  Very easy to whip up.  I like the skin left on the apples for bits of color(and added fiber)  I used half cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup a-p flour.  I only had buttermilk so used that in lieu of regular milk.  Added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the batter and this complimented the other flavors nicely.  These are not very sweet so sugar/cinnamon mixture on top was a plus.  I also added tsp. vanilla.  These were super moist with a fluffy light texture even with using the w.wheat flour.  They almost had a 'tutti-frutti' flavor.  Very nice muffin.

These are really nice, moist, and flavorful muffins.  I am generally not one to hack these recipes to death when I try them, but I did make a few changes this time (some out of necessity and some out of preference).  I didn't have any lemons on hand, so instead of using the zest and juice of a lemon, I added a tsp of Penzey's lemon extract, which is nice and strong and imparted a nice natural-tasting lemon flavor.  I diced the apples very, very finely because if my 2-year old finds chunks of anything in her muffins, she spits them out.  (I would love to know if anyone has made this with grated apples, by the way!)  10 T of butter seemed like a lot to me, so I used 6 T of butter and 4 T. of natural style applesauce; this was just enough butter to keep the muffins rich and moist.  I added about a half tsp of cinnamon to the batter and skipped the cinnamon/sugar on top.  These are moist, flavorful, not-too-dense and not-too-light, and I agree with another reviewer in saying kind of tutti-fruitti in flavor.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for a great muffin recipe!

These muffins are wonderful. I added more apple, as my family loves them. They are tender and wonderful hot, right out of the oven. I will definately make these again.

These turned out so pretty and fluffy! I used whole wheat white flour and buttermilk. I didn't bother to lighten the recipe this time because just by looking at them, I knew they'd be good and....we'll.....I wanted to indulge today. I wasn't really too concerned about the lemon flavor--I used Spice Island's dried lemon peel. I didn't use a whole tablespoon, a heaping teaspoon was more than plenty. Next time I make these, I don't think the outcome of the muffin would be drastically changed if I cut the butter by half (at least) and used organic unsweetened applesauce in it's place. I would also cut back on the baking powder just a bit, but that's personal choice. I did get twelve regular muffins and 18 mini-muffins out of this recipe, more than the original recipe stated. I always bake my muffins at 350; the large ones for 20 minutes and the mini ones for 12 minutes.

These muffins were very tender and light, but the three stars reflects the fact that they have no lemon flavor at all. Basically a plain apple muffin with very little flavor, period. They would have been really good had the lemon flavor been prominent.

The cinnamon topping is what makes these and the lemon makes them just a little bit different from other apple muffins I've tried. Ideal for breakfast as they weren't too sweet. Thankyou Roby we enjoyed these.

Yum! Next time I will be sure to cover the entire muffins with the cinnamon and sugar mixture. Be careful though, I ended putting apples on some of the bottoms of the muffins and the bottoms fell off. I had my camera near by and I thought it was fun to take a picture of them and I posted the picture :0)

These muffins were yummy! The only thing that kept it from having that 5th star was that I was expecting more lemon flavor. I'll probably add more than the recipe calls for next time to meet my taste expectations. All in all this recipe is a keeper. I like to make things according to the original recipe first and then tweak. :-)

Was amazing!!!!! I used cane sugar instead of white - made for a softer "sweet"... So easy and can be used as a muffin base for any kind of muffin like Blueberry, Cranberry.... tastes like lemon cake without all the calories!!!

I liked the muffins but I did use extra apple & I don't like using butter in my recipes, so I used canola oil & applesause instead.  Next time, I would use a bit more lemon because there wasn't very much of a lemon taste.

I love these muffins! They're perfect.  I made slight changes but they don't affect the recipe too much. I used whole wheat flour, margarine instead of butter, lime zest instead of lemon and left the peels on the apples for fibre. All the ingredient proportions were left as is. The muffins aren't very sweet, but have a moist, buttery taste. This recipe is a keeper!

Planned to make this recipe today, made them as people arrived left, right and center. Not one left for later! Everyone agreed they are fantastic.  Made as per the recipe. The electrician installing the solar panels on the roof couldn't resist inquiring what was baking, apparently the aroma was wonderful - they enjoyed the muffins as well. Thanks for the great recipe. Carol.

Just made these muffins to surprise our 17 year old son, who homeschools.  He loved them!  He ate 3, and said he really liked them a LOT!  So I tried one too!  Excellent!  My only reason for the 4 star rating, is that the sugar/cinnamon mixture on top, makes them look brown, and nearly burnt.  Of course, they aren't burnt, but it takes away from the over all look.  I am wondering what would happen if you just put the topping on for the last 5 minutes.  Still, I will make these again!   Went great with a cup of my freshly roasted coffee!

These did not turn out well at all. The recipe just doesnt blend together well. The tops of the muffins are good. But the bottoms are so plain and not very good at all.

The muffins were great. I modifed the recipe by leaving out the lemon juice based on comments about tutti-frutti-ness.  I also added 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  The flavor was wonderful.  Good cinnamon apple flavor, lemon hints. 

One problem I ran into was the butter aglomerating when creaming.

What a great recipe!  I have to admit I threw in a little more lemon juice, sugar, added some apple juice (and less milk), some walnuts, and made a bread out of it.  Deliciously moist and tasty.  Yes, the cinnamon sugar topping is the best!

Very moist, nice apple-y flavor. Not too sweet, no spice at all. I could barely taste any lemon despite using both bottled lemon juice and dried lemon zest in this. I used 2 pink lady apples diced up finely. I used a premixed cinnamon/sugar in the shaker for this and plenty of it for each muffin. The sugar/cinnamon topping made a flaky layer that peeled and fell off, rather messy when they cooled. I would much rather have had a streusel topping instead. I got 12 regular sized muffins and 3 large ones from this batter. Okay but I probably won't make these again as they just didn't make "the list".

Gorgeous! I also made a few adjustments… Brown sugar instead of white, 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour to 1 1/2 cups white flour, three eggs instead of two, and two apples instead of one. The raw mixture comes out fluffy, almost soufflé like, and the baked end result is moist and wonderful. The lemon is a genius addition to these muffins… Really makes them!

This is a very good muffin and like the texture.  I know there are complaints about not enough lemony flavor.   As a suggestion...if you rub the lemon zest into the sugar with your fingertips it releases the oils and hence you get more flavor.

These are good, really! I made these twice and both times they came out soft and fluffy. They don't rise up much though.. I followed the recipe to the T the first time. Didn't get the lemon taste and its really not enough sweetness for me. I shoulda put more topping on them..2nd time, I sub sugar with Splenda and added extra 2 more tablespoons of that, also triple amount of the zest.. Cos I love lemons!! I also added a 1/3 cup of quick oats and more apples. Also made sure the tops are covered nicely with the sugar topping.Oh!! My goodness, the whole house smell of lemons and yummmmmmm! Next time, i'll sub the butter with applesauce and more oats. A girl gotta watch what she eats ;) You gotta try this recipe if you love lemons .....and apples of course! Thanks for sharing,Roby!!

Everyone loved them so much that it did not matter that they all fell on the floor while taking them out of the oven. And it made way more than stated, which is a bonus. (And the lemon flavor was great, a perfect balance with the apple.)

The baking powder left a bitter taste that was not covered by lemons , apple and cinnamon.  The texture was not my favorite.

I made this with vegan replacements. And they are delicous. Some of the best muffins I have had. I had to add a little more soy milk. I did add cinnamon to the batter as well. And a little more lemon zest and juice, because I love the taste of lemon. These are very good.

I have been making these for a couple of years now. The only thing that I do differently is add a teaspoon of strawberry jam to  the middle. I also often leave the lemon peel out if I don't have one on hand. Great for breakfast because they are not too sweet and with the jam in the middle they are perfect for running out the door (or great to take on camping trips).

Very tasty. Used extra apple and didn't peel them. I also used Whole wheat flour for half the flour requirements. Thanks!

I used half whole wheat and half unbleached flour, 2 small apples in place of the large granny, didn't have quite enough lemon. But 15 min in the oven and they came out perfect! They were sweet enough by themselves, too. Still, I'm not overly impressed by them, thus the 4 out of 5 stars.

I'm not sure why but I totally didn't like these.  My boyfriend did though.  The cinnamon scorched on top (not surprising for 15 min at 425).  They took an extra 5 min to bake, but I think I was just expecting it to taste differently.  The apples, lemon and cinnamon combined into a weird flavor.

This is an easy recipe with few ingredients, and I like that.  I love exotic, but often can't find ingredients for them, so simple is best for me.  I live in Guatemala, and we don't have lemons here -- go figure -- so I often sub limes, but I do have a good extract that I used in place of juice.  I needed to use up a half container of sour cream, so replaced half the butter with it.  and because apples without cinnamon just can't exist in my world, tossed some in.  Results??  Really excellent, tender, moist and flavorful muffins.  I got 18 from this recipe, and will make them again.  Great job, and thanks for posting.    ----- Oh, and one more thing for those of you who get annoyed with ratings based on changes.  I come from a family of traditionalists.  You make the bread the same way every time.  I am not like that.  I make changes to everything.  I rate recipes based on the accuracy of the basic ingredients, the ease of cooking, and the results.  For some, recipes are "paint by number," for others color books that let us choose colors and paint outside the lines.  Enjoy them however you like.

These muffins were ok. I had heard from other reviews that they were plain, so I added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the batter. The resulting muffin was a little soggy from the apples, even though I gave them a little extra time in the oven. Sorry, but these weren't my favorites. ):

I won't  ever make this recipe again. I love to make muffins for my husband and I and tried this recipe to use up some apples and lemons we had on hand. It turned out awful! I forced myself to eat 2 of them and that was all I could handle. They were flavorless and had a very mushy texture (not under baked, just weird and mush/fluff). I was very disappointed and we ended up throwing most of them away. :(

A very tasty muffin, my family loved it. I made a few minor changes. I added a tsp of vinegar to the milk to give it a little buttermilk flavor. I very finely chopped in the food processor the apples, I decreased the butter to 8Tbs and was liberal with the cinnamon and sugar topping. The consistency is a little spongy, but my family loved it.

This recipe is really  yummy! When I was creaming what I had to, the butter was still in chunks. I didn't know what to do except deal with it but it probably was just a mistake on my part. Maybe next time I may cut a bit down on the butter, just to try and see what happens. When I took the muffins out of the oven, they looked so delicious and when I gave them to my family to try, they loved it. I also did not have a full tablespoon of lemon skin so I just added a bit more lemon juice and it added a bit of a lemon-y kick to it that was actually quite delicious! I will definitely be making this again and recommending it to friends!

Great recipe. I made a vegan version of it and it worked really well and they're super fluffy (substituted soymilk for milk, olive oil for butter, and banana for egg). I also added twice the amount of lemon juice and a little bit more of the zest. I realise that this is pretty much a completely different recipe to the original but it was a fantastic base to work from!

the muffin mainly taste of apple without lemon. As I have reduced 20% sugar (which i usually did for all baking), it turns out rather bland.  i will recommend sticking to it's original sugar amount for this particular recipes.  husband still managed to find the muffin tasting alright after adding additional sugar toppings.

They turned out delicious, and one of the lightest muffins I've ever made. Only thing I did different was use 2 medium gala apples instead of a granny smith apple.

Well I just took it out of the oven and had a bite. No flavor.  The texture is nice and cake-like, it browned nicely and rose with a pretty top. But even though I sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on top, there is not any flavor. I expected much more from these lovely ingredients and all that butter. Very disappointed.

First, I agree that it is more cake-like than muffin. FOUR tsp of baking powder? It seemed excessive to me, so I only added 3, but I could still taste it in the final product in an unpleasant way.  I had high hopes, but I will unfortunately not be making these again.

This recipe is great. I added extra lemon zest and about 3 TBL of Lemon juice. Get as much of the Cinnamon and Sugar to stick to the top as you can. I will make this again for sure. :)

Very good recipie.  I made with lemon extract because I didn't have lemon zest and it turned out pretty good.  I will say that the muffins aren't sweet so those of you who like a sweet muffin might want to up the sugar content.  Also I think 1 apple is not enough - this gets you 2-3 apple pieces per muffin.  Also I didn't find the lemon flavour to be very noticable - not sure if that's because I used extract instead of zest

This recipe makes some really yummy muffins.  To reduce some of the fat of the 10TBLS of butter I used 1/2 unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter and it worked out well.  My 17mnth old calls these "yummy yum yums" hahaha.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Pretty nice muffin.  I didn't have butter so used a mix of margarine and oil.  I added ground flax seeds and wheat germ, as I do with all muffins, and substituted some of the white flour with pastry whole wheat.  Also, I added some vanilla, and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter in addition to sprinkling on top.

These were very good. I used soy milk for the milk and powdered egg-replacer for the eggs(allergies!).  I added just a 1/2 t. or so of cinnamon to the flour mixture.  Also, I used a little more fresh squeezed lemon than was called for.  Very light. Yum!

I liked this recipe and it looked visually appealing, but it had a funny taste to it when I made it- I don't know what it was, but it had a sour aftertaste. It might have been the apples or the lemon, but it did come out tasting average.

Great recipe!
I made this together with my 3-year-old and everyone loved them!
I will definitely make them again!

Delicious! My fruit-avoiding 3-yr old son wolfed down his own and his grandfather's while grandfather wasn't looking!  I added extra lemon juice and used a mixture of lemon and orange zest because that's what I had available. I also microwaved the chopped apple for 30s before adding it to the mix. They turned out light and fluffy inside and beautifully crunchy on top.  Thanks!

My family loves this muffins, but I found it a bit wet due to the apples. I also prefer more cinnamon in this recipe as the sprinkling on top is not enough for me. But overall it tastes good

Husband really liked these.  We both agreed that next time we are going to try with orange instead of lemon, think it will be great.  Used 25% whole wheat flour and cooking time in a convection oven using frozen apples was 21 minutes.  Will def. make again.
