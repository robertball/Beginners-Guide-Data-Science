This was pretty good. Next time I will line the baking sheet with foil, the dressing made it impossible to clean.

I left out the mushrooms and mozzarella because I don't like them, and grilled my chicken after marinating. This is a great salad for a light lunch that doesn't leave you wanting for more.

I do the 5:2 diet and this salad fits perfectly into that plan for me! I had some leftover grilled chicken that I used instead of the tenders and some really nice Queen's Creek Balsamic Vinegar that I drizzled on top to reduce calories! I also season the salad with salt and freshly ground black pepper. It's great for the 5:2 diet lover!

I made this for dinner and it was really good! I put my chicken and mushrooms on a foiled grill pan and let the grill do the rest. I also used fresh mozzarella cheese chunks. Everyone in the family enjoyed. This one's a winner.

This was very good, the chicken was tender and the mushrooms were bursting with flavor.
