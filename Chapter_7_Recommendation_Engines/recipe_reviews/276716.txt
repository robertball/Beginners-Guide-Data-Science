Super yummy! I used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 4 and sweet potato instead of gold. This will go into my weekly rotation!

I made this exactly as written, except I didnâ€™t use the Pine nuts. I will make this again and again! Very tasty and easy to make, also very filling. Thank you for this recipe, Chef Ellie!

Easy, delicious, healthy! I like walnuts more than pine nuts - they tasted great as well. This recipe makes a VERY large bowl. And such an easy clean up!
