I am a professional chef who works as a Child Nutritionist with the
Homewood City Shcool System in Birmingham, Alabama, and am always looking
for different things to go on a school lunch program. Usually when I have soup
on the menu, we make 35 gallons of soup and have some left over. When I
made this soup for our highschool lunch, it was gone before half of the 1000+
students we serve each day had eaten. When the others arrived, I keept
hearing, "Where's that great soup we've heard about?"
When I can make that many teenagers happy with a soup, it must be 
SOME SOUP. Thanks for all the help!

I've tried several baked potato soup recipes, but this is the best.  Its names holds true- it tastes very much like the soup you can get in a restaurant (even better than some restaurants if you ask me.)  It was very thick, rich, and delicious!  I changed the recipe a bit and was able to cut the fat SIGNIFICANTLY.  I used 2 cans no-fat, low sodium chicken broth, skim milk instead of half and half, 1/3 cup store-bought bacon bits (added at the same time as the potato flakes so they're not crunchy), and 1 package (1 cup) 4-cheese instant mashed potato flakes.  By using cheese mashed potato flakes you don't need to use the cheddar cheese.  It still tastes very cheesey (in fact, I would not use more than one cup of the flakes) and you don't add any fat.  I estimated that by making these alterations you cut the total fat by at least 70 grams.  Even with the alterations, it was fantastic.  For those of you with cornstarch issues, I found that it was easier to chill the water and mix the cornstarch in the water before adding both.  No lumps, no pasty-ness!

This soup would be so much better without the instant mashed potatoes.  It turned out way too thick and the most dominant flavor is the taste of "fake" potatoes.  I won't be making this one again.

I wish I could give this 10 stars! We use 3 potatoes, garlic flavored flakes and 1/8C of cornstarch. We also add about a cup of shredded cheddar with the half & half. This is the best potato soup I've ever had, we make it at least once a month!

If you are browsing for an awesome potato soup recipe.. this is the one you want ! ! ! !

I made it last week for a pregnant friend.. she raved!  I finished the whole batch off over the next two days for lunch.. it is divine.
I bought "Real Bacon" bits for the topping.. I was too lazy to fry and chop bacon.  I also topped it with sharp cheddar.  You will definitely want to use one whole onion finely minced.  It is killer to try to chop an onion and then saute it in butter until it is soft.  I am not a big onion fan.. but the soup gets a terrific flavor from the onion.

I used about half of the corn starch.. I didn't want a really thick soup, and it turn out great.

YUM!

This receipe is wonderful.  Very flavorful.  I made 20 quarts for a party, and got rave reviews from all!  I used 1/2 of the cornstarch and 2/3 of the potato flakes the recipe calls for. It still gets quite thick, especially if you make it ahead and reheat it. I also added chopped carrots for color. I will make this often!

This is a truly AWESOME homemade soup. It tastes just like the one we get at our favorite restaurant. I cut the onions to 1 cup, and added one more potatoe. But other than that, the recipe was perfect for us. Thanks Holly. This is a keeper for these rainy Pacific Northwest days.

I really enjoyed this soup. I am going to make it for my recipe exchange club.  It wasn't the consistancy I was expecting (thought it would be more mashed potato like) but it was wonderful. I took the advice of other reviews and used 2% milk instead of half and half. Next time I will split it. I think it could have been a little richer. WONDERFUL FLAVOR, was not bland at all!!!

This is an awesome recipe.  I had searched for years for a great potato soup recipe and this is it.  I did take others' advice and cut the corn starch in half and I also used fat free half & half, broth (instead of stock) and cut the potato flakes a bit.  It is a very thick, rich and hearty soup.  Brought some into work and they loved it.  Reheats nicely (even thicker the next day).  Great for fall/winter!

This soup is perfect for a cold winter day.  Hearty enough to be a meal in itself.  Had so many compliments on the taste that it's sure to become a favorite.  (reheats well and is even better the next day!)

OMG...What can I say?  This soup is awesome!!!  I even substituted the half-and-half with Simply Smart 1% milk and it came out great!.  I like things a bit spicy so I increased the pepper amount and added hot sauce.  To give it even more flavor, I used garlic instant potatoes instead of regular instant.  This was so comforting with the cold temperatures on the east coast this winter.  Thanks so much Marbalet!!!

Made this today and it was absolutely delicious!! I accidentally bought heavy cream instead of half and half, but that didn't matter since I like my cream soups very THICK. My Mom loved it as well and she's picky about soups. Will definitely make this again. Wonderful!

Good grief! I have been making this for nearly 4 years (based on the date at the bottom of the printed recipe) and somehow haven't rated it until now. We've been absolutely loving it, but I do double the amount of potatoes used (for a chunkier soup) and microwave them when I haven't planned sufficiently ahead. Sometimes I'll use potato flakes as stated, but if there are leftover mashed potatoes on hand, then those will be subbed. I also saute a clove of garlic with the chopped onion. Thankfully it's a very forgiving recipe. I've had to increase the number of servings that I make in hopes of having a bowlful leftover for lunch the next day. Yum!

With potatoes, potato flakes, cornstarch AND flour, any one of which is by itself a thickener, this quadruple dose produces a "soup" with the texture of school paste.  All the great reviews convince me that many people like this texture, but if if your taste doesn't run that way, stay clear of this recipe.  There was so much thickener that even after adding another 2 cups of chicken broth, it was still glue!

Spicier than I anticipated, but still very tasty. Used fat free half & half, reduced fat cheese, reduced sodium chicken stock and reduced sodium bacon and it was still great.

Just made the soup with some changes which will make the "it's too thick" or "potato flakes?!" crowd happy (See other comments).

I sauted the onions and a package of Hormel real bacon bits together. Added flour. Added chicken broth. 

Now I diced up 5 potatoes and let them cook in the broth. I mashed them into soup when after they cooked. Because I used so many potatoes, I cut the flakes down to 3/4's or so cup. Did not add cornstarch or salt. Added tablespoon minced garlic.  Used a mexican blend of cheese and doubled. OH my my. Made it an hour ago and it is almost gone.

*New Review*  
The problem last time was the type of potato flakes I used.  After making again I have changed the review to 4 stars.  Still a little salty for me but very tasty.
*Old Review*
Way too salty and tasted like bacon (before I even added the real bacon).  I used "loaded" potato flakes which might have caused this.  I would like to try this again with plain flakes as the texture and thickness was exactly what I was looking for.

This is a wonderful soup for a cold wintery day.  The addition of the instant potatoes is an excellent thickener.  My local (Kroger) grocery store sells a great soup that reminds me of this, but this is cheaper to make and I like it better.

hmm... when i read all the rave reviews i was SO excited. baked potato soup is my favorite, i always get it at my favorite restaurant. but this to me tasted more like instant potatoes than anything else, and i felt the chicken broth really over powered the flavor. i think next time, i will go with a recipe which uses real potatoes as the base. the texture was strange, runny/glue like. i would try another recipe if you're looking for a real restaurant style baked potato soup.

This has a rich flavor and is creamy without being excessivley heavy.  I mixed in the cheese and added about 1/2 cup sour cream.  It was the best I've ever had!  Thanks for sharing Holly!

I made this as my first attempt at soup, I had never made a roux in my life! It turned out AMAZING, my husband and 2 toddler sons devoured it with cheese and bacon biscuits and have been begging me to make it again! I changed a few things a bit: I sauted some minced garlic with the onion; instead of fully baking the potatoes I microwaved them for about 5 minutes; I used leftover prepared mashed potatoes instead of just flakes; and I used Italian seasoning and steak seasoning instead of salt, pepper and the spices called for. Another recipe on this site: pull-apart bacon bread, it compliments this soup so well, I crumble the bread into my soup bowl. Delicious!

this is beyond the best soup i have ever tasted its better than black anguses....and that is saying something..i added some celery and sauted it with the onion gives a nice flavor...also this would be a good base for clam chowder...or you could add corn, green beans anything just about...i added the bacon and cheese to the whole pot that is how my family likes it...it is some time to make but well worth it...you wont regret making it but if you are planning on serving a crowd ya better make more than one batch it dont go very far cause of how thick it is...enjoy i will make this recipe for the rest of my life

My Fiance' dislikes soup for some reason unbeknown st  to me.  Where as I enjoy homemade soup of any kind especially in the winter.  I came across this recipe and decided I would try it out on him.  We, yes we loved it!  The texture was perfect and the flavor awesome.  This is the best potato soup recipe I have ever made!

I know the fat content in bacon grease is unsuitable, but the flaver is spectacular. Chop and fry bacon reserving the grease to saute onion . I have never needed to use cornstarch or instant flakes as the starch from the potatoes thickens the recipe. A pinch of cayene into the soup picks up all the flavors. Try it and let me know if you like it.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe except that I used fat-free half & half and omitted the cornstarch (not necessary.)  I don't like instant mashed potatoes at all but I didn't taste any "fake" flavor in the soup.  I keep the potato flakes on hand to use in baking bread.  Fat can also be reduced by substituting parmesan cheese for the cheddar, or just omitting the cheese.

Flavor is excellent. I could only give 4 stars because it has 2800 mg sodium per serving! That's more than an adult should have for their daily total of sodium.  Some great substitutions to make this more healthy: homemade sodium-free broth, fat free half'n'half, decrease bacon by 50% and use 2% cheese.  BONUS: There's enough protein in one serving of soup that the meal would be nutritionally complete with the addition of a tossed salad and some fruit.

I would give this soup 3.5 stars. It was far too thick made as written (think mashed potato thick). I ended up having to add considerably more cream to thin it out. I also didn't care for the overwhelming flavor of the instant potato flakes. If I made this again I would try adding the cornstarch by itself first, letting it thicken, then add just enough potato flakes as needed to further thicken and flavor. The three toppings finish this recipe really well.

I thought that there was way too much cornstarch in this recipe.  The soup almost tasted pasty.  And the baked potatoes got really mushy and were hard to cut up.
I wouldn't make this again.

This was wonderful! I used 3 potatoes, sour cream and onion mashed potato flakes and only half the cornstarch. I also added corn just because we love it in potato soup. Will keep in my favorites!

Even though my primary love is baking, I really enjoy cooking also.  Today we decided to go for some hot, potato soup. This wonderful, flavorful soup is great for the rainy, cold weather we're having.  My boyfriend and I paired it with hot, turkey sandwiches, while my son enjoyed a slice of toasted garlic-cheese bread with his soup.  We definitely plan on having this soup again in the very near future.  I made few changes to our version, I fried the bacon in the stock pot and drained off the fat before adding the butter and onion to give a little bacon flavor to the soup and also a tsp. of minced, roasted garlic.  At the end, I added more potato and added a little more half and half, but other than that, I definitely give this soup...5 stars!!!

You could tell the taste of instant smashed tomatoes in there, personally i wouldn't be happy if that was served to me in a restaurant. However, it had an overall nice texture, wasn't bland, bacon and onion complements the soup perfectly. i used normal milk (i had to add more milk to get it smoother because it got very thick) and i would recommend less cornstarch and less smashed potatoe flakes too. next time i'm gonna try this with real smashed potatoes! an overall not bad recipe!

A hit with me and the hubby! I will add extra real potatoes next time. I used skim milk instead of half-and-half. I used 3 cups chicken stock and 3 cups water. Used less onions, because I only had a cup. This will definitely go in the personal favorites cookbook!

I have to agree with a previous reviewer.  I made this soup exactly as the recipe indicated, and it does, indeed, taste very strongly of instant mashed potatoes.  Expecting restaurant-quality soup from potato flakes is just setting yourself up for disappointment.  

However, it definitely had potential, so I made it again using leftover homemade mashed potatoes instead of the flakes (adjusting the liquid accordingly) and it was divine.  Try it this way and you'll be in potato-soup *heaven.*  (I bet you could use a tub of pre-made real mashed potatoes from the refrigerated section in the grocery store, too.)

Tasty! I used 4 potatoes and didn't bother cooking them in the oven. I just peeled & diced them and put them in the pot with the cream just after boiling the chicken broth/water.

I have had this recipe for several years.  To me, it has been known as "Tony Roma's Baked Potato Soup".  We have this all the time, and I really like that it is easy, especially if you bake your potatoes ahead of time.  I also use flavored potato flakes (like Betty Crocker) to add more flavor.  This time I used Cheddar Garlic.  I have also used milk instead of the cream to cut out some fat, and we still enjoy it.  The soup can also be made ahead and kept warm in the slow cooker.  Overall, we really like this one and will continue to have it often.

Made this on a cold January day and it was very filling and a great cold weather soup.  That said, I could really detect the flavor of the instant potato flakes.  Will try again maybe with a few modifications. Thanks for the recipe

This is an excellent soup. Made it for the first time last night. Followed the recipe exactly, except I only had sour cream and chive instant potatoes. It was wonderful. My husband, who is an extrememly picking eater, even loved it. I will be making this again many times thru out the winter.

Upon hearing we were having potato soup for supper, my kids all groaned. However, they LOVED this soup! I would add another potato or two next time. I boiled the potatoes in bite sized pieces, which took less time than baking.  This is absolutely delicious! I had a craving for it while we were in NYC so I ordered some from a deli. It wasn't as good as this recipe, and it cost $5.50 a bowl! I definitely recommend this recipe.

I didn't have a whole lot of time this morning to wait for potatoes to bake, so I roasted them. I used the Roast Potatoes recipe, which is also from this site. I had a couple extra potatoes so I just cubed them and threw them in, too, just to use them up. Plus, it made the soup a little "chunkier". I omitted the cornstarch only because I thought the flour and potato flakes would be enough thickener on it's own. I used Cracker Barrel 2% extra white cheddar. I did stir the original bacon and cheddar in, I just set bowls of extra on the table for garnish. We all liked this. I actually was able to make this in my crockpot without issues. Plenty of leftovers, which is always nice. I served this with Cottage Dill Bread.

Excellent! This soup was defiantly restaurant quality; it tastes just like the potato soup from several chain restaurants around here. My only reason for giving this only four stars is because my husband (not a soup fan) wasn't too impressed. I, however, thought it was fantastic! Will make again when hubby is away for dinner.

This was an interesing recipe. It was a bit thicker than I prefer and I thought that the taste was off abit from the instant potatoes. My husband on the other hands loved it. The next time I may just puree some of the potatoes to thicken the soup instead of adding instant potato. I would also use much less onion as the onion flavor was very pronounced.

I have made this  so many times  over the past few years- it comes out just like a restaurant in my home town.  The only change I have made is to make the potatoes in the microwave , just to speed up the process on week days .  
I have also made "to go mason jars" of flakes, cornstarch, spices, etc.... to have on hand in the pantry and to take with me to family/friends/summer houses for quick dinner. 
I always serve with salad and cut up french bread on the side

This was GREAT! This is definitely going in my recipe box! I used 4 small to medium potatoes, peeled and cooked in the microwave - very quick! I used broth instead of stock plus one chicken bouillion cube, added 2 stalks of chopped celery, used 1/2 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup of 2% milk, added 1 cup of cheddar cheese at the end of cooking and just used pre-cooked bacon pieces out of the bag for a topping for those that wanted them (most of our family didn't) and had extra shredded cheese for topping. I was out of green onions and used minced dried green onions. YUMMY!

This soup is absolutely delecious. I can't believe that I made something that tasted so good! On my day off, I wanted to make something for my wife when she got off work. She loves potato soup so I picked this recipe to attempt. This was my third attempt at cooking, so I consider myself a bonified rookie. The directions were easy to follow.  I did make a few changes... We had some left over corn beef from St. Patty's day so I sliced it up and added it to the soup. I also added more potatoes, some fresh mushrooms and a garlic clove. The soup was extra thick so next time I would put a little less corn starch.  I ate three bowls last night and two for breakfast this morning!! My wife said it was the best she had ever eaten. WOW!

I made this soup tonight and it was so yummy! I added a couple cloves of minced garlic along with the onions. I used 6 or 7 small red potatoes and cooked them in the microwave. Much faster this way and it doesn't heat up the house! That many potatoes wasn't too much. It was just right! I don't think the recommeded amount of 2 baking potatoes is enough for the soup, but anyway... I also added an extra cup of half&half and another cup of milk. I did this because I was trying to stretch the soup a little more. This did not alter the taste whatsoever. It was fantastic and everyone loved this. All the kids, all the grownups. The bacon, chives, cheese and sour cream made it even better. This was better than baked-potato soup that I've had in restaurants! Thanks for the recipe, Holly. This one is a keeper.

I decided to try this recipe out of all the others I saw.  It was fantastic!  It tasted just like the baked potato soup at a place called Houston's in Atlanta.  I added a little garlic to mine and used chicken broth instead of the stock.  Also, I didn't have enough potato flakes so I only used 1 cup, but it turned out to be as thick as I wanted.  My husband even ate it ant he's is no soup eater.  I added the bacon, cheese and green onion to the soup instead of on top.  This was delicious!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was really good...one of the best I've tried.  However, the cornstarch made lumps in the soup, so next time I'll use less.  I also substituted whole milk for the half & half to save calories. Nex time I'll try skim milk.

Good soup- I made it with 2% milk instead of half and half, and also did not have enough potatoes on hand.  (Would have liked the soup a bit chunkier, although the thickness was terrific!)  It is very close to the soup you get in restaurants...good job, and thank you!

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet. I have made it for years. It is GREAT. I microwave the potatoes, use 1 c. onion, & use a little less potato flakes. I also use real bacon bits in a jar (easier) & omit the green onions as a garnish. This recipe is easier than it may seem.

I don't know how I feel about this one. I thought I would love it, but it really was only so-so for me. I liked the flavor that the baked tator brought to the party. And I did change the cream to sour cream, because I don't have cream but also it just seemed like a baked tator should have some sour cream. But it wasnt the flavors. It was something else. Maybe too many tator flakes? Or maybe not enough tators? I did a triple batch but I should have added more tators. I don't know. I like my own tator soup. I don't meaure anything but the key is this Chip-n-Dip from our local dairy. It is awesome! Sometimes I add cheese to the soup too. And sometimes some bacon or ham if I have it. But really the kicker is the chip-n-dip. Maybe for supper this other soup will taste better since it has had all day to hang out.

I liked the consistency of this soup very much but it was way to much onion for us. If I ever make this again I'll only use about half as much onion.

Use the "fresh" diced hash brown potatoes w/onion available now to make this even quicker!  Just add the pkg of potatoes along with the broth/water and simmer a few minutes before you add the potato flakes and 1/2 and 1/2.  (I still used the whole onion, sauteed as called for).  1 package (4 oz.) of "Loaded Baked" potato flakes was plenty to thicken it -- didn't need the cornstarch at all.  Added cheese to the soup AND added some on top for garnish.  Used FF half and half to cut some calories.  A great super-fast shortcut to homemade potato soup!

I couldn't beleive what a difference the potato flakes made in the soup!  I picked up the loaded baked potato flavored and pretty much followed the recipe remaining recipe, much like the potato soup I have been making for years.  Not a drop was left, everyone had two bowls each!

This was delicious and full of flavor.  I shortened my cooking time by peeling and cutting up the potatoes before boiling.  I would probably use less half and half or cornstarch next time because mine was a bit too thick, but otherwise this recipe lived up to it's name. Thanks.

By cooking at home, my whole goal is to eat better than what is considered "restaurant-quality" food, in the first place.  If you make real potato soup, you don't need instant flakes.

Delish!  Followed almost to a "t"...I didn't have regular instant flakes, so I used Betty Crocker loaded potato flakes (just one of the 2 packs in a box).

Made with a couple changes. Used olive oil to saute the onions. Swapped the half and half for skim milk. Only used cheese for a garnish. Came out creamy and delicious. Very good!

Really, really good!  I needed to make it lower in fat so here is what I did-I used 8 ounces lower sodium bacon  and coarsely diced it before crisply frying it.  I only used one cup potato flakes, used skim milk instead of half and half, and used low sodium, fat-free chicken broth.  I put the bacon right into the soup before the second simmer rather than just using as a garnish, and  I skipped the cheese entirely.  Oh, and I mixed the cornstarch in with the water before putting it into the soup.  I will make this again and again.

I made several changes... which turned it into a pot full of epic win. I mashed two ginormous cooked baked potatoes with sour cream and some salt, pepper, and paprika. Then I cooked everything like was stated, except instead of 2 cups water I replaced it with 2 cups milk. I skipped the potato flakes since I found it unnecessary. I added some garlic powder and paprika powder and then I added the creamed mashed potatoes into the soup. I didn't add the half and half and I added a little cheddar cheese and some bacon to the tops of the bowls. I didn't use the green onions. This was the best tasting potato soup ever. Epic soup is epic.

very good! But i did make come changes, I usedsome ofthe grease of bacon to cook the onion, garlic (1) clove finely chopped. I left my potatoes cubed for texture. added carrot and celery. left out the instant potato why make something artificial tasting. this in my opinion .It was used as the thickner base.so I made slurry of chicken broth and flour to give body.I liked it

BEST POTATO SOUP EVER!!!!  Definitely use butter instead of margarine and it really needs nothing.  I wish I could give this 2984709218374 stars!  I've gotten marriage proposals over this recipe.  Definitely is a steady in my fall and winter menu.  Thank you!!

I made this soup with only two changes, one was that I increased the number of baked potatoes by two, and I omitted the instant potato flakes....I just can't bring myself to do instant potatoes, and the other change was adding 1/2 tsp garlic powder. This soup was delicious, it was very creamy and very flavorful! I will make it again!

This soup is very good, but instead of just putting the bacon and green onions on top when serving, I added directly to the soup.  I also added additional salt to keep it from being bland.

AMAZING!!!  My husband and kids LOVED it!!  The only small changes I made were that I used butter instead of margarine, because that's what I had on hand and I doubled the amount of bacon it called for.  I stirred half of it in when I added the half & half and used the rest on top as called for.

I tried this tonight and it is a really awesome soup!  The only thing I had to change was adding bacon to the soup as well as some cheddar cheese.  Kudos!  Thanks!

This is one of our family's favorite soups.  It is a great hearty soup with rich flavor and smooth creamy texture.  I use extra potatoes since we like it "chunkier".  I do omit the cornstarch though.  I don't see the need for it - especially if using potato flakes to thicken.  A family favorite!

Very, very good. I am gluten intolerant so I left out the flour to make it a gluten free recipe - and still was perfect.

Very yummy soup.  I used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth to make it vegetarian.  It was thick anc creamy and went over well with the three teenagers I made it for.  I served it in bread bowls, and that made it extra nice.

oh my god is this good!! I did do SOME things different though. I sauteed the bacon with the onions. And i added garlic .I also poured some milk in it along with some half and half. i added more potatoes then it said too.Not that you needed to do anything different, this is just me. I never measured anything either, only the chicken stock, and water. I also steamed some broccoli and let the kids add it to their soup if they wanted.They didn't but my husband and i did. Awesome recipe. thankyou sooo much for this recipe!!!

This recipe is fantastic.   I didn't change a thing except I used the real bacon bits they sell in huge bag at Costco/Sam's Club and added those instead of frying the bacon.   I put the green onion and bacon in the soup and simmered for awhile instead of using as a topping. I also cut up a few carrots and added.  Wonderful flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will definitely share and make again.

I hate when people rate a recipe but then list a million things they changed. (It's called a different recipe!) I changed nothing on this and it was delicious! My 11 year old helped me make this. My family loved this & they can't wait for me to make it again! It felt like I was eating in a restaurant! Thanks!!

I loved this soup.  The only thing I changed was taking a shortcut on the potatoes.  I used canned diced potatoes instead.

I used chicken broth instead of stock as some other reviews recommended.  I ended up adding another can as this was looking really thick.  Maybe next time I won't add the cornstarch, or not as much of it.  In my opinion, it needed alot of salt.  Also recommended was to fry the potatoes in the bacon grease, not healthy, but added some flavor.  I also added the whole 16 ounces of half and half.  I crumbled the bacon, chopped some green onion and added it in the whole pot.  Also added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese.  All in all, pretty easy and tasty.  My family loved it; I will keep this recipe until I find something better.

This deserves more than 5 stars! Unquestionably the best potato soup ever (which I boast to doubtful folks before they try it & without fail, everyone agrees). I  use 1 c. garlic potato flakes and 1/2 c. butter flavored flakes (incidentally, those little packets of Idahoan brand flavored flakes, 6 oz I think, equal about one dry cup so you need two of those packets & end up having a leftover 1/2 c for the next batch). I also use sweet/yellow onion instead of white, which is not as harsh for those who aren't huge onion fans, and this is plenty thick either making the roux OR use corn starch; not both. A must-try if you're a soup-fan!

This recipe is fantastic. I did make a few changes since I doubled the recipe. Used 7 potatoes instead of just 4. Since previous posters said it was too thick I only used 1/4 cup cornstarch and 2 cups potato flakes--I used the garlic cheddar kind and it really added flavor. Even doubled we flew through the leftovers--I am making it again this weekend. Yum!!!!!!

Yummy soup! This one is so flavorful and not bland at all. I only used 1 Tablespoon cornstarch and I did add 1 clove of minced garlic, 2 stalks of celery, and 1 extra potato (it definently needs 3 or 4 medium sized potatoes). I also used real bacon bits instead of bacon which was perfect and easy!  Also, I did cook the potatoes in the microwave to save on time and it worked great. Just puncture with a fork and cover with wet paper towels.  I love the addition of potato flakes. What a great idea! This is definently my new potato soup recipe that I will use whenever I want that creamy goodness! Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making baked potato soup and it was great! It was very thick at first after adding the instant mashed potato flakes and cornstarch.  I would recommend not adding the cornstarch
(which should be mixed with 1/4 - 1/2 water) until later in the process (if the soup isn't thick enough)or not at all. I added about 2 extra cups of water and 1 cube of chicken boullion and it was still plenty thick.  I also used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream in place of the half and half. I added about a tablespoon of bacon drippings for flavor as well. I will be making this again but with a few minor changes.

Yummy!  I used less onion, three potatoes and fat-free half & half...this was delicious.  I mixed the corn starch with the water before adding it to the soup- it wasn't lumpy at all. We ate the soup out of bread bowls.  I will definitely make this again- Thanks!  :o)

This soup was very good. I would add more potatoes and serve it with cheese topping to give more flavor. Very good heated up the next day. I agree on the bacon bits . I used turkey bacon and it seemed a bit floppy in the soup.

I've been looking for a baked potato soup recipe for a long time and this is it!  This is a terrific soup and easy to make.  My husband couldn't get enough of it.  I used fat-free half and half and it was still thick and creamy.  I also used 3 potatoes instead of 2.  This is a definite keeper!!

This is absolutely wonderful.  I made it for the first time last winter and it was great to warm up with.  The other day I added some corn kernals and it was an awesome chowder.  There are a lot of varations you can do with this recipe. I have made it on several occasions and people always rave and ask for the recipe!

Excellent soup!  It is truly yummy.  I cut out some fat by sauteing the onions in some of the broth, then using skim milk instead of the half & half, with no sacrifice to the taste.

Hands down the best potato soup I've ever had! The whole family loved it!  Only change I made was I used garlic instant potato flakes and reduced them to 1 cup. It seemed people said it was very thick. I also used milk instead of Half and half ( only because I forgot to buy it!). Absolutely delicious

Loved this! So good.  Great flavors and definitely a hit with my husband and son. I don't think I'll add the cornstarch next time though. Wasn't needed at all. I did mix in the bacon and about a cup of cheese instead of serving it on top of each bowl. Can't wait to make again.

This is a good recipe and gives the baked potato feel. My children loved it.  Changes: no cornstarch and half the potato flakes and 3 potatoes next time I make it. It came out really thick and I ended up adding 2 cups of half-half to thin it out.

This is a really good and easy soup, but as written, the consistency is way too thick.  I even cut the corn starch in half and it was still too thick.  I would suggest starting with 1/8 c. cornstarch and 1/2 c. of potato flakes.  You can add more flakes slowly as the mixture thickens until you get to a consistency you like.  I would have much preferred a more "cream soup-y" consistency and what I got was very "mashed potato-y".  I was concerned about the 1/2 tsp. basil, but it ended up being a very mellow flavor and not overpowering.  I think nest time I might add just a tiny bit of bacon grease with the butter when sautéing the onions to give it a little more bacon flavor.  Otherwise, really great.  I really like doing the baked potatoes in advance and cutting the chunks up in the soup.

This was sooooo good! I made it for some guests on a cold wintry night and they raved on and on about how good it was! I would've given it 5 stars, but I made some alterations based on what others had said about the recipe. I baked four large potatoes in the microwave instead of the oven, diced 3 (so added one extra) and made one into a small batch of "mashed potatoes," which I then substituted for the potato flakes.It was obviously hard to mix in evenly, but after a few minutes it worked well. I also saved the bacon grease and used it to start my roux. I put bacon in the soup and also saved some for a topping. I almost put cheese in the soup as well, but I decided to wait and just put it on top, which worked out well. Can't wait to make it again!

This is my favorite potato soup recipe and I've been making it for years. It's one of my go-to comfort dishes for shut ins and sick folks at church. I get rave reviews and requests for the recipe all the time. I'd like to add that I disagree with people saying to use milk instead of half and half. You can use fat free half and half if it's the fat content you're concerned about. The soup will be much creamier and tastier  if you use half-and-half instead of milk. Some other changes I make consistently are that I cook carrots and celery in the chicken broth for about 15 minutes for a heartier soup but it's truly good without these as well. I skip using any thickening agent except for the mashed potato flakes. I also like to experiment with the flavors of mashed potato pouches that I buy. Finally I very often skip the cheese part to save calories if I'm making it for myself. The soup is  fairly low cal if fat free half and half is used and the mash potatoes flakes are used for the thickening.

This recipe is pretty darn tasty and really easy!  I took some ideas from other users that I think helped improve it...I really don't like instant mashed potatoes...they have a funny taste to me, so I did some things to mask them in the soup, but they are essential for texture and body in the soup.  For starters, I used cheddar/garlic flavored potatoes and then, since I didn't have any half and half and to add "tang" to the soup, I added about 1/2 cup of low-fat sour cream along with a cup of milk.  I also added 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and served the soup with more sour cream and cheddar cheese on top.  Also, I kept the potato skins on to add more color/texture to the soup and used four small russet potatoes rather than 2.  I think next time I might even use red potatoes (using 6 because they're smaller) and leave skins on to make the soup prettier and compliment the bacon.  It's also much faster to "bake" your potatoes in the microwave...simply pierce them and put them on a microwave safe plate...microwave them about 6 minutes on each side until both sides tender.  Voila!  Overall, a good weeknight meal for cold evenings!

I'm giving this recipe as written 4 stars because I just can't imagine using potato flakes - yuck!  However, with my mods it was really good.  I used about 7 smallish potatoes, used the immersion blender to smooth about 5 of them, and then added the remaining potatoes in chunks to give it a little more texture.  Also, used heavy cream instead of half & half, no water - skim milk instead, and fresh basil instead of dried.  My kids loved it.

This is an excellent recipe and even my teen loved it. I did have to double the margarine and I thought the pepper was a little strong, I would cut that back a little next time.  I only used a little over a cup of onions. Also put the green onions, bacon and cheese into the soup along with using it as a garnish.  They add a lot of great flavor.

Made the recipe as is and loved every bite of it.  Husband and son gobbled it up as well.  Will definitely make again and this time I won't forget to use the bacon bits that I bought to serve with the soup!

Incredible!! I did double it and found it to be a bit bland so I added the cheese in and let in melt. I also added teh bacon right into the soup. I also added a tiny bit more basil and thyme at the end to taste. Overall, very good!!!

My boyfriend and I LOVE this soup!! I used cheddar flavored potato flakes and as other reviewers suggested, I cut down on the flakes and cornstarch.  At first I was worried that it would have a "fake" potato taste due to the flakes, but this was not an issue at all.   Yum!

I did not like this at all. All I could taste was the fake potatoes. The texture was kind of gross as well. It was like runny mashed potatoes. I followed the recipe exactly. I will not be making this one again.

Pretty good!  :)  used the suggestions of others and halved the cornstarch, potato flakes, and half&half.  I also added 1/2 c of milk to substitute the half&half that I omitted.  It was plenty thick.  I did add some extra spices just to make it a little more flavorful!  I think next time I might try the cheddar flavored potato flakes.

I was a little leery of the instant mashed potatoes when I made this soup. It was for good reason, they did not enhance this soup in the slightest. It's so easy to use leftover mashed potatoes (really, what else will you do with them?) or to add extra potatoes and mashed them up in the pot, it's really not worth the time you may save using fake potatoes.  I think it's an okay soup when made with real potatoes, though even canned soup is good with bacon, green onions and shredded cheese on them!

Don said 5 stars.  Not as good as non-veg, but good for veg.  Added fake bacon and 1 cup cheese just prior to 15 mins simmer.  Use less cornstarch next time (doesn't need to be so thick).  Makes a full dutch oven (way more than for just 2 ppl).

I was looking for an easy and great tasting potato soup recipe for me and my partner; I have never really cooked anything, unless it's boxed or frozen, but this was really good!!!  I did add 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup, because we both love cheese, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome!  I wll def be making this again!

I thought it was a very easy recipe.  I made it gluten free by substituting 2T potato flakes for the flour.  The roux was just a little thicker.  In the future, I will NOT add the basil or thyme.  I did not like the flavor with the potatoes.

This has to be one of the BEST recipes I've found online, hands down. My bf is an EXTREMELY picky eater and not a soup person, and even he loves it! I left out the cornstarch and used heavy cream instead of half n' half. I know that adds quite a bit more fat and calories but it really perfected it for me.

Yum Yum! Didn't change a thing and it was great! It is a thick soup, but my family loves chowders and other thick soups so that didn't bother us one bit! Great flavor and texture. Kids and adults loved this one. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  I didn't have quite enough chicken stock, so I added a little extra water and a little extra half and half.  Instread of garnishing with cheese, bacon, and green onions, I just mixed it all in.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as directed and it was delicious!

This was a very easy and great tasting soup! I do think for us it was best right after cooking vs left overs.  I will certainly make this again! Thank you!

This was pretty good.  The toppings are a must to really taste like a true baked potato!  I added an extra potato and I still think it needed more chunks of potato.  I served this with mini reubens.  Yummy!

This was a good recipe.  My husband loved it.  I personally did not like the texture/tast from the instant mashed and did not need the additional cornstarch.  It reheated wonderfully the next day.

Very very good. I used an envelope of four cheese mashed potatoes instead of plain potato flakes to add to the flavor. I also stirred the bacon into the soup, and used sharp cheddar and chopped green onions for the garnish. I kept the skins on the potatoes because I like the skins. The consistency was perfect, and the taste was wonderful. I will definitely be making this again.

This soup is  fabulous. I made a huge pot and took it to a Lenten Soup supper potluck and it was gone in no time. Don't cut out the green onions & bacon. Without them it's a good soup. With them it's a great soup.

This is a great recipe.  I followed the recipe as written and did not have a problem with the soup being too thick.  Nor did I think that the onions were "too much".  I am glad I did not read the reviews first, or I may have cut back on the onions, and I thought it was just right after cooking down.  The only thing I didn't like about the recipe is that is was not quite "creamy" enough for me... next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will add more milk and/or add cheese while cooking, not just on top (Adding sour cream did help some).  Overall a good flavor and texture!

Everyone in my family devoured every last bit of this soup. My father actually used bread to wipe the bowl clean!  I made it vegetarian by using vegetable broth and vegetarian bacon strips. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the knockout recipe.

I've never met a potato soup I didn't like, but this recipe was WAY too starchy for me.  Maybe cutting back on the potato flakes and using more cream would help.

I made this last week and loved it - I did not change much at all - used half cream and 1/2 milk because that was all I had on hand and I added a pound of bacon to the recipe (not just on top). I did not have any green onions on hand so I skipped that.  IT WAS SO GOOD - I raved about it for so long my husband asked if it was better than s** - I told him it was a toss up. ;-)

I doubled this to make a big soup pot of it, and it was good, but definitely take heed about the amount of potato flakes. I used half of what I should have for the doubled recipe and it was almost as thick as mashed potatoes (spoon stood up by itself).  I don't see how the cornstarch could be needed along with flakes, although I used both. I ended up adding an extra 2 CUPS! of water and NO half and half to cut down the thickness, which didn't work. It was still good though! Other than far fewer flakes next time, I'd also add garlic (my flakes were garlic flavored) and keep the bacon tender as I could have lived without the crunch.

My mom visited from out of town over the Thanksgiving holidays, and I tried out this recipe to change up our usual weekend BBQ's and to accommodate the chilly weather. I had always wanted to make this resteraunt fave, but never could quite figure out how to make a thick soup without changing the robust flavor that is expected in this soup. Well, I found it...it was a huge hit! I doubled the recipe, and there were STILL no leftovers! Even the little kids enjoyed it...the fresh bacon on top helped alot! I added a clove of garlic (I add garlic to absolutley everything!)to the sauteed onions, and had to substitute half of the chicken stock with broth (since I doubled, I ran out of stock), but other than that, I followed the recipe and it was great. I do recommend letting the potatoes cool before chopping for obvious reasons (They crumble when you cut them warm...I was in a hurry). This is now a family favorite, and I am already being asked when I will make the soup again. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I've been trying to find my family's idea of the perfect baked potato soup.  We have tried a few and I decided to throw this one on them.  This one was a little different than others I have tried.  The instant potato flakes were new, as were the basil and thyme.  I LOVED the idea of thickening with potato flakes.  I only used about 1 cup, so I didn't have any problems with them overpowering the soup.  The basil and thyme, on first bite, were a little different.  However, after the first bite, they really added to the flavor of the soup.  I did cut back on the cornstarch a little, added some cheddar with my half & half (we like cheesy soup!), and instead of margarine, I used the bacon grease to start my soup in (incredibly healthy, I know!).  All in all, with a little tweaking, this COULD become our favorite baked potato soup.  I'll have to work with it a little, but we'll see.  Without much tweaking, it's a solid 4 stars, for sure!  Thanks for posting!

I make this recipe about twice a month because its fabulous.  I use some shortcuts and can make a batch in about 30 minutes.  First: microwave the baked potatoes, approx 4 min per potato, they turn out just as good.  Second:  use real bacon bits that you can buy in the dressing aisle instead of frying your own.  I have also tried different kinds of mashed potato flakes, by far the best is Idahoan Loaded Baked Potato.  Take the time to really soften the onions...one time I rushed it and they were too crunchy.  Enjoy!!

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now and I get more compiments on it - it is a staple for my winter holiday parties!  I do have to adjust it to fit my crowd so here's my 2 cents...Use a 5lb bag of russets and douple the remaining ingredints.  It feeds 10 adults nicely!  Also, I use the garlic mashed potato flakes!  Good luck and enjoy!

A very good soup! It's definitely a time investment to make this. But for all the trouble you get a very creamy, tasty restaurant-quality soup! Would've given 5 stars, but the basil and thyme were a bit strong. I will use this recipe again, but will ease off on those spices and add a good deal of garlic. I don't know what those earlier reviewers did wrong with their soups - but mine WAS NOT TOO THICK at all! It was just as thick as you get at the restaurants. Yummm.

This is my first review on this site.  I love to go eat at Black Angus Steak house just for the baked potatoe soup.  This is very similar.  I loved it.  My kids loved it and my husband that is hard to please liked it.  I didn't follow the recipe exact but similar.  I didn'thave 1/2 and 1/2 so I used regular milk, I didn't have cornstarch so I didn't add that and it still came out delicious.  I've made this twice in about a week in a half.  Fresh bread to dip and it's a must.

This was excellent. I baked the potatoes in the microwave, used roasted garlic instant mashed potatoes and omitted the cornstatrch and half & half, because it was already so thick. This will be a staple in my house.

Great soup! I did follow some of the advice from other reviews. I didn't make the flour roux, but I did add 1/8 cup (or 4 TBsp) corn starch. Also, using the garlic flavored potato flakes is a must. It adds sooo much flavor. I would highly recommend this recipe for anyone throwing a dinner party. Very impressive even though it is not that difficult. Thanks!

This was AWESOME!  I left out the onion because I've tried other potato soup recipes that call for it and it doesn't appeal to me.  I also left out the cornstarch and used milk instead of half and half or cream - it was SO GOOD.  My kids loved it.  I have been looking for a potato soup recipe that gets close to a favorite chain restuarant and this one is IT!!!  Thank you so much!

Excellent!!! I will make this again and again. My only modification was to add the bacon directly to the soup, instead of using as a garnish.

This soup is great!  I added celery and garlic to the onion while it sauteed, and then followed it to a T!  I've made it for lots of people with rave reviews...

omitted cornstarch.  plenty thick enough. used two cans of diced potatoes--busy week-night supper. NO baking required. Turned out very nice.  husband told me after we ate, that he does not like potato soup in general, not the recipe itself.  so i probably will not make again.  Oh well, more leftovers for me.

Good soup, but the onion flavor was a bit overpowering for my taste - next time I'll use half as much and add a clove of garlic.  Didn't use cornstarch at all, and it was plenty thick.

This soup was absouletly delicious. I wanted a more creamy soup, so I strained it halfway through cooking time. The potato flakes I used were garlic flavoured and that worked nicely. We needed more bacon though, to satisfy my ever-hungry boyfriend. Thanks for the recipe!

Creamy and wonderful!  I took the advise of previous reviews with great results - use 3 potatoes, use only 1/8 cup of cornstarch, and use only a 4 oz. package of potato flakes.  Filling and delicious!

This soup is out of this world!!! Just as good as any restaurant's baked potato soup, and I have tried alot. I did use about eight small red potatoes instead and I added some bacon pieces to the soup as well as on top. My family devoured it!

This was THE BEST potato soup I have ever eaten.  It took a little longer than I thought it would to make, but it was worth it.  Both my 3 year old and my husband LOVED it.  It absolutely tastes like a soup you would order in a restaurant.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

This is the best tasting potato soup ever! It takes a while to make the first time, but I can be finished with it in 40 minutes now. Bake potatoes in the microwave to speed up the process. I use fat free half and half and it turns out great. Be careful with the amount of pepper. Depending on how it is ground, you can end up with too much. I top with green onion and cheese, no bacon. I use two cans of chicken broth rather than chicken stock.

Made this for dinner and it was delicious! I used a mix of veggie and chicken broth (no water) and a mix of half and half and whole milk. I also added a handful of cheese into the soup to make it extra cheesy. Recommend this!!

I was searching for a baked potato soup that didn’t have sour cream or cream cheese in it and this was the only one. I knew I’d have to go rogue on the recipe to fit my family’s needs. I added celery and carrots for an additional boost and didn’t bake the potatoes but cut them up and put them into the chicken stock to boil with onions, carrots and celery, so much easier!!! I couldn’t figure out why four thickening agents (instant flakes, flour, cornstarch and cheese) were needed. I didn’t want paste so I made a simple roux and BAM that’s all it needs. I used one 16 ounce container of whipping cream and it was an immediate impact providing the creaminess this soup demands. I also used 64 ounces of chicken stock vs 32 ounces so it ensures that there’s enough ‘soup’ with the added veggies. I keep back green onions and bacon bits for garnish. This is a darn good recipe and glad I tweaked it. This is a keeper

I made this soup but since I literally don't use anything that is boxed, I skipped over the potato flakes, but I also didn't use any butter or flour. I boiled the chicken broth and threw the onions and seasoning in there while boiling it, cut up about 5 small potatoes and put them in the boiling broth. mashed it up a bit to give it the thickness. I added just enough 2% milk to give it that creamy color and garlic salt. mixed cheddar cheese and the crumbled bacon. at the very end to make sure it was thick, even thoigh it still turned out to be, I added maybe 2-3 TBSP in about 1/4 cup of water to the soup. I did have to add a lil extra chicken stock to it only because my broth was evaporating away, but that was just my fault not focusing on it as much while I was making dinner. but it was a MAJOR hit between me and my boyfriend. my other family members are begging for me to make them little batches to take home so they can try it too. definitely a keeper!!

Really tasty. I boiled the potatoes then blended about a cup with stock to thicken instead of using potato flakes. Cooked the onions in bacon grease instead of margarine. Mixed everything together for a super yummy dinner. Will definitely make again!

Since you asked if I made any changes, I will tell you that I did.  I followed the basic recipe except for the thickeners, no flour, no cornstarch, no instant potatoes.  I simply added a couple of extra potatoes and used my potato masher in the soup until I had it of the consistency that I wanted.  I also added an extra cup of FF half and half.  Other than that I followed the recipe.
Oh yeah, and a lot more bacon, but not in the soup...on the top as a garnish.
Absolutely delicious!  Yes, I will make this again.

This was very good. I did use flour mixed with water to thicken the soup instead of cornstarch as I find cornstarch tends to make liquid a little slimy. I used leftover ham from Easter rather than bacon but I'm sure the bacon would be good too--just wanted to use the ham up.

Delicious recipe.  Very good recipe as a base to change it to what you have around the kitchen (used flour instead of corn starch, used 2-1 cup pouches of potato flakes, used whole milk, added Queso Velveeta cheese to mine to melt, stirred the bacon into it, added a can of corn, and cooked it with bay leaves for flavor).  I'm sure it would have been great as is also.

I did not care for the boxed potatoes. It has too much thyme, which was very overpowering until I added the bacon to the simmering process along with a lot of salt and pepper.  The end result was more of a mashed potato consistency than soup.  Thankfully the bread bowl I put it in saved the soup, but I would not make this again.

The flavor of the instant potatoes overpowered the true flavor of the soup.

After looking through many baked potato soup recipes on Pinterest, I decided on this one.   I read many reviews on this site as well and have always found them to be very helpful.  Made some adjustments as well, I did not have the potato flakes so I admitted them as well as cornstarch and just used another potato, used half and half and skim milk.  My family loved it!  The consistency was perfect for us, as I think the potato flakes and cornstarch would have made it too thick for our taste.  The flavor was outstanding!

I loved this recipe, and my boyfriend RAVED about it.  I did have to put a little extra half & half in so that it wasn't TOO thick, so I'd advise having enough on hand to add as desired.

This was AWESOME!!! We went back for seconds:)) The only changes I made were I used chicken broth as opposed to the chicken stock and I added some garlic powder! But other than that followed it exactly! I Will definitely be making this again.

Excellent! One of best potato soups I've had. My kids went nuts for it, especially with lots of sharp cheddar and bacon on top. After reading some reviews, used 3 potatoes and only 1 c flakes, plus added dash garlic powder.  Try this one for sure!

I used a little less onion -- i pretty much halved the recipe, as there's only 3 of us! But it turned out great.  I wanted a thicker soup and this was exactly what i was looking for.  Came out great, only change really was that i took half the cooked bacon and chopped up some chives and let it simmer all together for the last 15 to 10 minutes.  really made all the flavors come together.

My families favorite!!! I like that its easy and I usually have all ingredients on hand.  The only change I made was I baked my potatoes in the microwave just because its quicker and then set them in the fridge to cool.  I have fixed it with and without the skin on the potatoes.  I like it with the skin on. I don't usually keep cream around and rarely use it so I use whole milk instead.  Works great!! This is a keeper.  I will pass it on to my daughter when she's ready.

This is the exact recipe as the copy-cat one I have for Tony Roma's Baked Potato Soup.  So no wonder it is "restaurant-quality."

OMG!!!!  EXCELLENT SOUP.  We added the bacon and cheese in the pot and it was AWESOME.  Used butter instead of margarine and cream instead of half and half.  Cut the cream with milk.

This soup is delicious, the only problem I had was that everyone liked it so much I didn't have any leftovers!  I tweeked the recipe a little bit by using one can of chicken broth and one container of chicken stock, just because it was i had on hand.  Also used fat free half and half and it came out great.  I also used the packaged bacon bits and put them in while it was simmering.  Next time I think I will use a few more potatoes and perhaps one of the "loaded" instant potato mixes as a previous reviewer suggested.  My husband and kids scraped the pot.  I can tell I will be making this recipe often!!

Great recipe!!! Almost didn't try because of the potato flakes, but glad I listened to the majority of the reviews and gave it a try as written.  Only change I'd make is next time I'll tmake a double batch.

This was easy and tastes fabulous! Even the hubbie, who's VERY picky about his baked potato soup, scarfed this down and asked for more! I did use 3 potatoes and I threw in about 3/4 cup sharp cheddar I needed to use up. Very yummy!

Good but not sure I'd call it "restaurant quality". The final three ingredients used for garnish were a really nice touch! However I'll probably will continue my search for the perfect baked potato soup.

Excellent!  I didn't have any chicken stock, so I used water and chicken base.  I also skipped the thyme.  I put the soup base in the crock pot after I had it all together, and added raw, peeled, chopped potatoes to the crock pot.  I cooked on high for about 4 hours.  Served with bacon bits, cheese and chives on top.  Delish!

This was really great but I changed it a bit. I didn't bake the potatoes until they were completely done, added a can of corn, added the bacon bits before serving and chunks of ham. Threw it all in the crock pot for a couple hours to finish cooking the potatoes and it really helped to blend the flavors together even better.

ahhh i dont know how i feel about this. i  halved it, and used 3 red potatoes that were on the small side. and used skim milk instead of half and half. but i wouldnt have thought that would make it taste different! i just think it's not as good as the other potato soup recipe i tried from this website!!

Used red potatoes, added some Velveeta, used skim milk.  Most of the family (11 yo, 2 yo, husband) really liked it (though 11yo thought too many onions).  7 yo didn't care for at all.

Made this tonight and it was easy and super delish! I fried the bacon first and then sauteed the onions in bacon grease instead of using butter. I also used less cornstarch so it would not be too thick....turned out perfect! My hubby loved it too... Will make again for sure!

Made this soup for a soup bar we had for 60 people at church this weekend.  It was a hit and extremely easy.  Gave the recipe out over and ove and my only complaint was that there were no leftovers.

Awesome soup!  My very picky daughter loved it.  As some reviewers recommended  I also used only an 1/8 cup of cornstarch and 1% milk.  Will definitely make again!  Delish!

This soup was exactly what I was looking for! The only real change I made was using cornstarch and extra potato flakes instead of flour to make it Gluten-Free and it still came out thick and delicious.

This was yummy! I used chicken broth, not stock.  Also, I used italian seasoning in place of thyme and basil.  I used about half the cornstarch, and 2 1/2 potatoes.  My whole family said this is better than my other potato soup recipe, so there ya go! :) Thanks for sharing!!

I made this soup for a card night with family.  It's a hearty soup and everyone enjoyed it.  Kind of like a baked potato with all the toppings added.  Thicker than I thought it would be, but that may be because I forgot to add the half and half.

This was good, but not all that GREAT.  Didn't care for the instant potatoes...almost had a gritty texture.  If I make this one again, I will follow others and do some tweaking.

This soup is really thick and hearty. I used vegetable stock in place of chicken broth. I didn't use the flakes as I hate fake potato taste, instead I put half the potatos and half the half and half in my food processor. I also put the cheese into the soup but I don't think I would do that again.

This is really delicious and fairly easy to prepare.  I agree with previous reviewers and did not add the cornstarch, it doesn't need it. I did add a little more half and half though.

Very good!  It needed a little more seasoning and a lot less onion for my taste, but it was great on a chilly Arizona night.  I had leftover mashed potatoes, so I used them in place of the instant potatoes and water, and left out the cornstarch.  This had a much better flavor than the usual milk and potatoes version.  I'll be making this often.

This potato soup recipe is the closest I've found to a restaurant quality baked potato soup.  So good!  I did cut the amount of onion in half and used cheddar garlic mashed potato flakes.  I have made it with and without the cornstarch, and my family and I prefer it without - the soup gets too thick with it I think.  I made this soup for a casual Christmas party, and it was a hit with my guests.  Try it!

I used leftover mashed potatoes so I have no idea how many potatoes were actually involved here. I skipped the roux, threw in a can of Cream of Chicken soup, used no water, and no salt. Used more cheese than stated and ended up with a nice thick and hearty soup that my family loved. With these few changes, this recipe definitely warrants a repeat performance. Thanks Holly!

this was good, i doubled the recipe.  It needed a lot of salt in my opinion and lots of cheese.  I really enjoy homemade soups and thought this one would be better than the ones that call for canned soups mixed in, however, i think that the "worlds best potatoe soup" from this site is by far the best potatoe soup I've tried thus far and I will make that one until or if I find a better one.  Thanks

This was a great soup, I like mine a little thicker so we had no problem with this.  Excellent.  Thanks for the post.

I added more potatoes and some carrots and celery, but this turned out to be the best Potato soup i have ever had.  I served this in the Italian bread bowls recipe from this site.

One of the best potato soups we've ever had.  A change I made though; I used 4 potatoes instead of 2. Two would have been too few I believe.  Also nice to have sour cream on hand for people to put on top of the soup.  Makes great left-overs, but you'll probably have to add some milk to thin it out after it's been in the fridge.  For a healthier alternative to half and half, try some 2% milk.

This soup was delicious.  I added a little parmesan to the soup, but otherwise I did stick to the recipe.  My family loved it too.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.  I'll be adding this recipe to my "favorite" recipes.

VERY good!  Easy.  I dissolved the corn starch in water and had no lumps-only had about 1/8 cup of corn starch, but that was perfect.  I used 3 potatoes and didn't brown the onions-just cooked until tender.  The downside?  NO LEFTOVERS!!!  Have already emailed the recipe to 7 friends.  Thanks.

This was great.  I added another potato for more substance. I omitted the flour because one of my dinner guests has celiac's disease (can't eat gluten) and the soup still thickened up beautifully.  Garnishing the soup with the bacon just immediately before serving is a must so that it is still crisp.  I served it with a side of broccoli and fresh sourdough rolls. Everyone commented on how good it was.

I thought this was a little bland.  I saved it with lots of bacon, chives, cheese and salt - and then it was pretty good.  I think it had too much potato flakes perhaps.  Might make it again.

OUTSTANDING!  This was just what I was looking for on a cold winter day.  I added about one and a half cups chopped ham instead of the bacon (stirred it in with potatoes), and followed several readers' advice and went with 2 T cornstarch.  Also, used chopped chives on top.  Really delicious flavor and yummy texture.  Thanks for sharing!

Thanks Holly!  This has become our fave! Even my 7 yr old will eat this, and he hates soup! Some TIPS- I peel the potatoes and bake them in the microwave, it makes it go much faster. Also, used 4-5 potatoes, added cheese to the soup at the end, and mixed the cornstarch with the 2 cups of water.  I use skim milk and it's great. Thanks again!

This was SOOO good, and so easy to make!  I made it for my daughters birthday party, and it was all gone by the end.  I had about five members of my family ask for the recipe!  The only thing about it is, the cornstarch made clumps in the soup...  I will probably make a paste with the cornstarch next time.

This is simply the best soup recipe ever! My whole family loves it!  I added milk to thin it out a bit and i added the green onions and bacon rather than just using them as a topping. Wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing this one!

This has 5 star potential with some modifications... less onion (maybe 1 cup instead of 2), and less potatoe flakes/cornstarch as the soup was a bit too thick. Also, I used evaporated skim milk instead of the cream to reduce the fat content, but this made the soup a touch too sweet. Next time I will just add 2% milk as the added thickness was not necessary.

Very rich and hearty soup! Excellent flavor. I, too used chicken broth instead of stock and more cheese than it called for. This one's a keeper!

Excellent, rich soup.  Used up some left over mashed potatoes instead of instant flakes, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  This will go in my "regulars" file to make often.
