Loved this.  I left out the cracker crumbs, did not see a need for it.  I used a little chicken broth and just a spray of olive oil to cut down the fat as much as possible.  The red onion in the recipe was a nice touch!

I think this is the tastiest asparagus I've ever had!  I really enjoyed it.  It was so good.  I don't use wine so I used a mix of balsamic vinegar and apple juice.  Sounds wierd, but it was really yummy.  The parmesan cheese went so well with the carmelized onions.  I omitted the crackers, I think that would have taken away from this dish.  Served with lemon/garlic roasted chicken.

I have never made asparagus before, but had a taste for it, picked some up on the way home and found this recipe. I had all most of the ingredients at home already and it was really very good. Of course every cook add their own touch. I cut the stalks in half and then cut them again to open them up lengthwise. I used a white onion, (that was what I had on hand) and instead of a white wine, I had to use this delicious garlic vinaigrette - It was delicious. If you like your asparagus more tender than crunchy, like me, reduce the heat some and cover it. I shook the asparagus around frequently in the skillet with the lid on to make sure the seasoning were coating well. I added a bit more seasoning in the cooking process, salt, pepper and lemon pepper. Turned out great! Can't wait to make it again.

Very simple side dish to make; it really only takes 20 minutes! I recommend using 1/2 to 3/4 recommended amount of oil (otherwise the dish is too oily).  The browned onions are very tasty!  And parmesan cheese makes the dish delish.  :)  Will make again.

This was the easiset way I've ever tried for asparagus.  The asparagus came out tender and the addition of the red onion was just perfect.

Good way to prepare asparagus.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I used fresh lemon juice.  I too omitted the whole wheat crackers.

These were delicious. I usually blanch my asparagus first, but I decided to follow the cook instructions in the recipe, and I'm glad I did. I made a few changes, but nothing too major: I used a pinch of lemon pepper... I don't think it is really necessary to the recipe. I only had about a tsp of olive oil left, so I substituted the rest with butter. I had an opened bottle of red wine, so I used that to deglaze the pan, and then I added a splash (seriously, maybe a tablespoon) of heavy whipping cream. I omitted the crackers. Seriously delicious.

Baking or panfrying is my favourite way to do asparagus and this recipe was very good.  Did not add the cracker crumbs and used fresh grated parmesan ... everyone loved it!

I made this recipe last night for company and got mixed reviews.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written because it drives me nuts when people rate a recipe after they've completely changed it.  So based on the written recipe, I would give it 4 stars only because it wasn't something that I can't wait to try again.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, my daughter liked it, I just thought it was ok.

I really liked this recipe a lot! I didn't use the crackers because I have a wheat allergy. I also left off the Parmesan cheese, used the whole bunch of asparagus instead of 10 spears, and used Marsala wine instead of white wine since I didn't have any white wine on hand.

This is the best asparagus I've ever had.  I used a yellow onion (because I didn't have a red one), and didn't use crackers (because I didn't have any), and it was still amazing.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I love this recipe!  It's one of those really great go-to recipes when you're looking for a healthy side dish.  Tip: Cut the last 3" or so off the asparagus spear because that part is often too hard to eat.

My whole family loves this asparagus recipe(including my kids!)! I'm so surprised at the review stating to eliminate the crackers, since I think they added such great taste & texture. The best was the way some of the crackers,onions,etc got a lil crispy when seared. So tasty & easy! 
The only thing I substituted was the wine(didn't have some on hand) so I've tried both 1TBSP of white vinegar diluted with 1/4cup H20, or chix broth(both in lieu of wine) and both made only a lil difference,but still tasted great! I like the broth best, though. Enjoy!!

Simple and delicious, what more can you want out of a recipe?  I didn't use the crackers, but will try it next time.  But even without, I thought this was just a great way to have asparagus.  Thanks for the recipe Beckerkorn!

I probably make this once a week. It is one of our very favorite recipes. The only think I do differently is to add some real bacon bits to the onions, and I don't use the cracker crumbs either. But this is quick, easy, healthy and very yummy. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious. It doesn't even need the wine. We ate a couple spears before we added the wine and prefer it that way. However, either method is good. The kids had theirs with parmesan cheese and the adults opted out.

I love my variation of this recipe for asparagus. It is so good. I use a balsamic vinigarette instead of white wine because I never have that available, a white onion instead of red, and I don't add the crackers. Also, I let it simmer for 5-10 mins after cooking on high to get the asparagus much softer. It is so good!

This was quick and easy.  I left out the whole wheat crumbs but cooked it as given otherwise.   I used very thin asparagus spears and it was great!  My 5 year old even liked them this way!  He just didn't eat the onions :)

Excellent recipe: very tasty and very easy. I didn't have purple onions, so I used some green instead.  We tried your basic "saute with salt and butter" recipe for asparagus last night - this one definitely tops it and barely takes any more work.

I really liked these crab cakes.  It was all about the crab!  Only made 2 changes....ritz crackers instead of saltines and I did not coat in breadcrumbs.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe is quick, easy and absolutely the best asparagus I have ever eaten.  I used red wine vinegar in place of the white wine, worked really well with other ingredients.

I loved this recipe and so did my children. If you don't have purple onions, you can use white but may lose a certain sweetness that only the purple has. May be a miss the first few times you make it with the lemon pepper as wel. First time I added to little, second too much. Extra parmesian for the kids is always helpful.

Really tasty, really good.  However, wasn't as simple as it sounded.  I attempted this a while back when I wasn't cooking very much yet and it wasn't "easy".  Now perhaps I could do it, but it was alot of hassle when I could have steamed them.

Good recipe. Easy, and tasty. I used red onlions, and it was strong, but great. The white wine really tops it off. I also simmered longer so the asparagus would be more tender.

I found that I didn't have any moisture left at the end and might try blanching the asparagus for a few seconds before frying it next time. I omitted the crackers and they were not missed.

I wanted a lighter vegtable dish, so simplified this one by omitting the cheese and cracker crumbs, and by using water instead of wine.  It was still quite good.

I love asparagus, so I can't imagine a bad asparagus recipe, but I've had better.  There's nothing bad about this recipe but I guess I expected it to have more flavor.  It definitely has potential though because I love all the ingredients- I may try tweaking a few things by adding more of something- but until then I'll probably stick with my old asparagus recipes and keep searching for new ones.

This  was great! Loved, loved, loved it. I didn't have the lemon pepper on hand, but used some "lemon zing" dip spice that's been kicking around in my pantry.  Forgot about the cracker crumbs, I'll be making it again tomorrow evening, maybe I'll use the crackers then, although it was fabulous without! :-)

Amazingly delicious! I paired this w/ a lemon pepper roasted salmon & it was perfect. I did however leave off the cracker, I'm sure it would have still been great, I just forgot to add it before I served.

This is the best asparagus I've ever had.  I omitted the onions as neither my husband or I care for them, I also subsituted italian bread crumbs in place of the crushed crackers.  It was esquisite.

A good change from the usual steamed.  The flavors worked well and the hubby loved it. Didn't use the crackers - don't know how that would work, other than that followed the recipe exactly.  This will become a frequent side dish in our house.

I think this recipe was good, but I would recommend allowing the asparagus to cook a little longer. It has some interesting tastes. I added more garlic, pepper, salt and lemon pepper than it recommended, and it made it better. I agree with other reviewers that the crackers were a little weird. All in all, a decent recipe and I'll continue to make it with a little tinkering here and there.

The asparagus was tasty, but the crackers were the strangest thing... I'll definitely omit that the next time...

I really liked the wine sauce, I think that's what made the recipe.  My husband doesn't like parmesan, so I left that and the crackers out.  I also used olive oil and some leftover bacon grease.  yumm.

This is not only easy but delicious. I'm very surprised how much flavor it had and definitely is a new spin for me who normally just steams it and adds a bit of butter! I did like others have said and skipped the bread crumbs, but I also didn't use white wine either and it was great. I'll be making this again and again!

This recipe is good. I used lemon juice in place of lemon pepper, because too much pepper can ruin anything, even asparagus! You can also add a bit of butter to give the drippings more substance.

The asparagus was good, but I always have problems when the instructions tell you to cook the onion, garlic etc. first.  I love my asparagus very tender and this takes time - more time than the onion and garlic need.  I would also use a flavored oil or a bit of butter.  The purple onion was a great touch.  Again, this dish was good, but it could be better.

I assume that the heat should be lowered once the asparagus goes in the skillet, but recipe does not specify this.

Poor instructions.

I thought the idea was good but I changed it a bit. Sauteed the garlic and red onion (good color) and then added the asparagus till it was still barely crisp and then drizzled soy on top.  Good I will try again with Parmesean.

This was great-I cut the asparagus into 1 1/2" pieces instead of leaving them whole. I think the onions are what really makes this recipe great. The whole family loved it! Next time I would add a little less wine.

This was so AWESOME.  I just got done eating it!  I had doubts about the cooking time since the Asparagus I used was large but it turned out perfect.  I did use breadcrumbs instead of crumbled crackers.

I wasn't as impressed by this as some other reviewers. The asparagus didn't have much flavor, and the presentation   didn't look very appealing, but maybe I somehow made this wrong!

I haven't typically been an asparagus fan, but I'll eat it in other dishes.  I tried this and we LOVE it.  Makes the asparagus much more flavorful and appealing.  Even my toddler was willing to eat a few.

I will try again and will follow the recipe next time. I made this with what I had on hand and didn’t love it. I used yellow onions, pinot Grigio (too bitter) and panko bread crumbs. I promise to make again as directed and hopefully it will be better and I’ll rerate it.

Great recipe! Like others, I left out the cracker crumb topping and exchanged the white wine for white grape juice with a splash of lemon juice and vinegar.  I also cooked the spears 5 minutes longer, and used powdered parmesan instead of grated as it was on hand. My family loved this dish, and it was very quick and simple to make!

This is easy and fabulous. I left out the cracker crumbs, you really don't need them. I substituted sherry for the white wine and shallots for the onions because that's what I had on hand. Delish!

I have not made it yet, but this is the recipe that my aunt made the one night when I was at my grandmother's house, and I have been searching for it with a broken link in my email, but now that I've found it with the website, keywords, and title of the recipe via a search engine on the internet, I can actually wow her with the recipe and 1 her up by making it even richer than how she made it!!!

Probably didn't follow times suggested.  Browned onion and garlic.  Cooked asparagus until tender.  Didn't add cracker crumbs. Otherwise followed directions.  Absolutely the best asparagus I've ever tasted!

This was a nice side for the "Filet Mignon with Rich Balsamic Glaze"!  I pretty much followed the instructions minus the cheese and crackers.

Fantastic!  Made it just as is but without the crackers.  Used a whole "bunch" of asparagus with the amounts for 2 servings and found it to be perfect.  Wouldn't change a thing (except that the crackers really are unnecessary). Served with "steak au poivre" and was a great balance of flavors.

My husband thought I had become a gourmet cook! These plated up so beautifully! I wish I would have taken a picture.. Next time.  This was easy and delicious. I also didn't have red onion so I used the green onion.  After plating I added some green onion on the top!
