This was delicious. I used an unbaked, homemade pie crust and baked it for 45 minutes, which was a perfect amount of time for my oven.  I didn't have a springform pan, so I used a cake pan. I might need to make this again for Christmas!

Soooo good! Added a butterscotch-bourbon sauce and served with a scoop of ice cream. The bacon crumble is a nice twist.

Tasted fine but not pretty.
