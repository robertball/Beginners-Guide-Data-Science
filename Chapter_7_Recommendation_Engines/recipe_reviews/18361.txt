This recipe was 5 star with the modifications I used as follows:
I used chocolate cookie crusts instead of graham.  I crumbled up 1/2 box of  choc/mint grasshopper cookies (Girl Scout thin mints would work great also!).  i spread hot fudge sauce on the empty pie shell and added some cookie crumbs there, then added the minty cream, and finally completely covered the top of the pie with the crumb topping.  It was delicious!!

This was okay, I wasn't particularly impressed. BUT... mint extract is 89% alcohol, while creme de menthe is 15% alcohol, so I can't understand why they say this recope does not contain alcohol.  ALL extracts (including vanilla) contain alcohol!

Very good!  I also made my own mint Oreo cookie crust.  And I took the advice of some others and instead of chocolate extract, used two Hershey bars chopped in the food processor.  I would recommend freezing them before chopping them, however so that you are pouring in flakes, and not trying to mix in a paste.  It was WONDERFUL!

This was so good... I recommend freezing it for an "almost ice cream" pie. I got creme de menthe flavoring (instead of regular mint) and used equal parts of that and the chocolate flavoring.  It was superb and I'll make it again and again!

I am a HUGE fan of regular grasshopper pie, but didn't want to risk anything when I was pregnant so I made this version instead.  I agree with another that it should only be made with OREO crust (not chocolate graham cracker, that wouldn't taste good), but the filling is great and perfect for our needs.  :)  This year I can have the regular version again, but I keep the recipe on hand as I've already made it twice.

I made this for a church bake sale. The chocolate extract was a bit hard to find, but I was finally able to locate it at a cake decorating store. It turned out nicely, but I added grasshopper cookies around the edges of the pie crust along with crushed cookies on top of the pie with the suggested chocolate shavings.  It looked nice and I hear it tasted pretty good.  Would make again.

This pie cuts into perfect wedges and is not messy at all. It also keeps well for several days in the fridge. Due to lack of ingredients on hand, I had to change the recipe up a bit. I baked a chocolate pie crust (just add 4 Tbsp of cocoa powder and 4 Tbsp of sugar to your back pocket pie crust recipe) as I didn't have the grahams. I could not find the mint or cocoa extract in the store, so I used peppermint extract and vanilla extract instead. After pouring the filling into the pie crust, I shaved milk chocolate over the top. My husband enjoyed the texture of this dessert. I thought it was a bit too minty, so next time I will use 1/2 Tbsp of the peppermint extract. Great job!

This pie wasn't anything great. I had trouble finding chocolate extract. I ended up buying Ghiradelli semi-sweet baking chocolate, melting it in a double boiler with a little butter and then blending it with the melted marshmallows and whipped cream. Flavor was good but the texture was too 'marshmallowy'. Fluffy but yet squishy like a marshmallow. My substitutions could have resulted in the lack luster result but I'd say skip this recipe.

HUGE hit at Thanksgiving! I'll have to try freezing it next time.

A couple of tips:
Don't use a whole tablespoon of mint extract. Use 2 teaspoons at the most, but it depends on how strong the extract is.  I also used a few melted Andy's chocolates to add the chocolate flavor instead of chocolate extract, so that led me to use less mint extract.

This was so minty and good. I made my own crust with mint oreos (about 2/3s of the package) and about 1/2 stick of butter which I baked at 325 for 7 minutes. I also substituted the chocolate extract with 3 ounces of chocolate chips. This turned out great!

Not bad at all, and will make again. Oh, there is alcohol in it - the two extracts are made with it, and they aren't cooked in this recipe which would cause the alcohol to burn out.

Per other reviews I did change this up a bit but the original recipe inspired me! I used mint oreos (in processor) and melted butter to make crust. I chopped up 2 Hershey bars and added to marshmallow mixture and it still stayed smooth and creamy. Topped about half of the pie with crushed bits of the oreos so you could see the green filling. Didn't use the chocolate extract since I prefer solid chocolate. What a chocolate and mint lovers dream! AWESOME

The reviewer below is absolutely correct--this pie is NOT alcohol free. I was making a grasshopper pie for a party and wanted to make a kid-friendly one also and used this recipe. Then I checked the bottles. My peppermint extract is 86% alcohol, while the creme de menthe is 30% (the standard grasshopper recipe uses 1/4 cup creme de menthe). If you do the math, you will see that the "Baptist" pie is actually only 35% less alcohol than regular pie (insert your own Baptist joke here). I used chopped chocolate instead of creme de cacao or chocolate extract because I didn't have either, so I'm not sure how much they contribute. Additionally in a side by side tasting everyone preferred the creme de menthe pie...the peppermint extract pie was described as "toothpasty".

This is a very good recipe. Just wanted to add that the alcohol content in extracts are higher than the liqueur you are replacing.

I could't find chocolate extract so I used a little chocolate syrup.  Cuts the Minty flavor.  Also put in individual cracker crusts.  Grandkids liked that idea.
