Finally! Someone making a true Aioli instead of adding spices to mayonnaise! I have made this same recipe and it is great. But remember there are so many different variations of it. I went a bit lighter on the vinegar. Lemon juice is a good substitute for the vinegar. Anyhow well done! I also used (high quality) olive oil instead of canola.

Made as written and this did not turn out good at all for me. There was nothing creamy about it. In fact it was pretty much all oil. I think if you cut the oil in half it might have been edible. Even then it is all juice so I'm not sure how you would ever put this on a hamburger or cold cut sandwich as the recipe submitter mentions. I'm thinking maybe there was supposed to be some mayo in the ingredient list that got left out?
