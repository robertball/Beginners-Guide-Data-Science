I'm always happy to be the first reviewer of a new recipe and report that I enjoyed it and recommend it. This is not a unique pasta salad, but it's a good one, and the submitter is correct - the bacon and cheddar DOES make it better.  In this case, I needed something at the last minute and this was good, filling and simple.  I find that often it's the basic recipes, the non-fussy, non-fancy recipes, that are the best.  I stuck pretty much to the submitter's intent, only adding a little sour cream as I always do to mayonnaise-based salads to mellow out the tang of the mayo, and some thawed, frozen peas.  This was exactly what I had in mind for our impromptu, grilled burgers dinner tonight.

I used red bell pepper instead of green, reduced fat mayonnaise and homemade dry ranch seasoning mix. My husband and kids liked it but it was unanimous that it needs double the bacon, for us at least. Great quick pasta salad. EDITED: My husband said this was even better the next day, after it had sat. He ate all the leftovers.

This was right up our alley. I did mix mayo with sour cream as another reviewer recommended. Great ranch flavor and super quick to prepare. Highly recommend!

In looking for a pasta salad recipe that included bacon I found this one.  I was drawn to the simplicity of ingredients and inclusion of cheddar cheese along with the bacon and mayonnaise.  I will definitely make this one again…I did add a bit of sour cream to the mixture of mayo and ranch dressing as per other reviewers…if anything, next time I would add a bit more bacon and a little extra ranch dressing…This was very easy to make and crowd pleasing.

This recipe is really good. Added more of the ranch mixture. Try heating up. It's excellent. Actually better hot.

We love this salad! I've made this a few times now with minimal changes. I usually use whole wheat pasta and do 3/4 c mayo and 1/4 sour cream. I use shredded cheddar. This is the best macaroni salad we've ever tasted! Thank you!

This salad was ok, but I had to adjust the recipe.  Using a full pound of macaroni, I had to almost double the ranch dressing.  I used shredded cheese because that's what I had on hand I think I liked it better than I would have liked cubed.  I also wish I had used miracle whip instead of mayo because it needed a little zing (I guess I could have added a little vinegar, but didn't think about it at the time).  Good starter recipe and easily adjustable to your tastes.

This was great and really easy to make.  I added some garlic powder, pepper, and chipotle seasoning to it, gives it a nice kick without overpowering the other flavors.  We had seconds and thirds of this!

this recipe was a nice alternative to classic mac salad. I just had to substitute some sour cream because I ran out of mayo, but it was just fine that way. yum!

It was good, but I used fat free Greek yogurt as well as mayo to give the ranch dressing a little bit of that tartness that is associated with ranch dressing.  Definitely will make again.

This doesn't call for salt and pepper but it sure needed it!  I also felt it was a tad dry and needed more dressing.  Fixing these things would make this 4*.  Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

I am in LOVE with this macaroni salad! ?  I made this for a big family gathering, but, I am normally not a big macaroni salad fan (because of the onions, which I dislike, and are always a main ingredient), so, because I was making it, I just added some onion powder, to accommodate the taste buds of the onion lovers; and, the bell peppers still give the perfect amount of crunchiness in each bite. When I finally ate my "taste test" bite; I was floored!  With all the flavors, mixed with the bacon, bell peppers and small cubes of tillamook sharp cheddar cheese, I LOVED it, and will continue to make, even with the onion powder!  It was a big hit at the family gathering,  and was happy that I made enough to set some aside to save at home... ;)

I enjoyed this quick simple macaroni salad. I exchanged green pepper for peas as I don't like green pepper and added a little sour cream to thin the mix out a little. It is a very good quick salad!

I was in a hurry to make a pasta salad for a picnic. I had all of the ingredients so I decided to try this. This was very good. The only changes that I made were that I added some grape tomatoes cut in half, used tri-color rotini instead of elbow macaroni, and I added about a 1/4 cup of milk to the mayonnaise and hidden valley ranch mix to make it a little thinner so it would coat the macaroni a little better. I know others added sour cream but I didn't have any on hand and the milk seemed to do the trick. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe. I added some red pepper and black olives for a different twist. For appeal I top it with slice hard boil eggs. Easy to make and will make it at the NASCAR race in Bristol in August.

This is REALLY good!  I did omit peppers cause I didn't have any on hand. I also doubled the mayo, added 1/2 c sour cream, splash of whole milk & an extra ranch mix packet.  (After being in the fridge overnight, it needed a little more "wetness".)  The overnight wait is so worth it!  The flavors meld together so well.  YUMM-O!!!

I made this a couple hours ago for our bbq dinner tonight, and I just snuck a taste! I had to force myself to put the lid back on before I ate it all! Changes I made based on what I had on hand; 8 slices of bacon, rotini pasta, broccoli (tossed into the pasta during the last few minutes of boiling), and green onion. I probably put in more cheddar than called for and I doubled the ranch dressing because the rotini really sucks it up. I substituted 1 cup of mayo for 1 cup of sour cream. I didn't use the full 2 cups, so i reserved the rest to add as need be.  Lastly, i have a bag of those colorful baby bell peppers, so i sliced 4 or 5 into rings, and they look so pretty! It's going to be so good with our pork chops and corn on the cob! Thank you! Edit: I did in fact need the extra dressing, as the rotini completely sucked it up. And it was a huge hit!

I am logging my modifications for this recipe more as notes to myself so I can recreate my experiment again.  We tend to eat things with a little more fire and extra spice, so I made changes that fit our tastes.  I used 16 oz. large shell pasta.  I used 1 pkg of Hidden Valley Spicy Ranch dressing mix to add a kick.  I used Olive Oil mayo, and added an extra large dollop, maybe a 1/3 cup to the 1 cup.  I did use the green bell peppers and red onions.  I also added sliced black olives.  I used packaged bacon pieces for ease and speed.  I used 8 oz of sharp cheddar cut into chunks.  I added about 2 Tablespoons of Mezzetta Sweet Bell Pepper Relish to the dressing before folding it into the salad.

This recipe is just what I was looking for. I did make a few alterations because of what I had on hand. For the crunch I used celery instead of the bell pepper. I only had shredded sharp cheddar, so I used that. I had frozen green peas so I threw in a couple handfuls of those. Also, cut the mayo with about 1/4 cup sour cream and added a bit of salt and black pepper. Delicious!!!  Tonight’s dinner is leftover macaroni salad with leftover ham bits. We’re looking forward to this meal. Thanks for a great recipe.

I will definitely make this again.  It was soooo good. The only change I made was to substitute early green peas for the green peppers (only because I don't eat them) and I added another cup of mayo.  It seemed to be a lot of macaroni as it made a huge amount, so maybe if I cut back on the amount of macaroni then the 1 cup of mayo will be enough.

Like others, I found this salad to be too dry,  I made it the night before, and the next day, all the dressing had been absorbed into the pasta.  (I did add about 1/2 cup sour cream that I had on hand)  I did double the bacon as others suggested, and the flavor was very good. It doesn't have enough vegetables and the texture was poor.

Good, simple summer side dish. I've substituted boiled potatoes for pasta, ham for bacon and 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo dressing plus add green onions.  I think a good pantry cleaner type of recipe. No fuss. Definitely let it sit for awhile before serving, let those flavors get to know each other!

This was delicious though I had one heck of an onion!  Next time may cut that in half.  I also added salt, pepper, and a little celery seed for flavoring.  Took to church picnic and it was a hit!

Excellent! Instead of bacon and cheddar cheese I used shrimp and Swiss cheese. I have already been asked to make it again this week-end for a camping trip. Like another reviewer said, I think it taste better heated up. Cold is good but heated is better. I also used shallots instead of onions for a milder onion flavor. Very tasty recipe!

I did a whole onion and pepper, and added a little relish.
