Well - I didn't have the right flavors of cake mix/pudding/chips - but guess what?? - I used "Cherry Chip" cake mix, Hershey's Rasberry chips, and Vanilla pudding mix (non-instant)...and it came out GRRRRRRREAT!!!!
    Very rich and dense (almost like a bread pudding texture) - great hot with vanilla ice cream!  (p.s. - I used Whole Milk!)

My family is snobby about chocolate cakes, and we think it needs to take hours to come up with anything good - so I'm not telling them about this recipe!  it's such a heavy dose of chocolate - moist and rich, just what I want in a chocolate cake.  The chocolate chips on top are perfect for copping out of frosting it, but if you want to avoid chocolate overkill I think a non-chocolate icing would go nicely... Raspberry would really go well with this... Or you could maybe get, say, peanut butter chips instead?  But if you're in a pinch and need a dessert fast, have at this one!  The people you feed will tell you you're evil for tempting them with it.

Such an easy "cake mix" recipe!  This is great if you want to make an ordinary cake mix extraordinary.  I loved the dense, fudgy texture.  I make it in 2 9" cake pans and cooked for 20 minutes--perfect!

I have made this recipe for years.  Got it from my mother, who got it from her sister, who got it from her mother-in-law.  It's definitely been passed around.  I have found that the finished quality is directly related to the kind of cake mix used.  If I use the cheapest cake mix I can find ... it tastes that way.  However, if I use a good quality cake mix such as Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake mix ... it is oh so yummy.  Also, it cannot be a mix with pudding already in the mix.  Those who have been unhappy with this cake, try it again with a good quality cake mix (if you didn't already) and see if you like it better.  I give this recipe 4 stars, only because it can be messed up.  A truly 5 star recipe is one that turns out great so matter what the cook does.

Good staple cake to have in your pantry -- also the leftovers froze wonderfully, holding its moist texture.  I used instant jello without any issues and added ~2 Tbs vanilla extract as well as ~4 Tbs Bailey's liquor to address other's comments of blandness.  I would add even a bit more of each next time.  I also mixed the chocolate chips into the batter, reserving a just a handful for the top. No need to frost, just serve warm with ice cream.

My famiy would have enjoyed this a lot more had it not been for all those chocolate chips, and I added only 1 cup, not the 2. The cake itself was very good after scraping off the choc chips. I'll make it again but without the choc chips. Great with ice-cream and whipped cream!

This cake is so good and very easy. All I had was instant pudding and it still worked. Would probably taste better with non-instant, but my kids and husband ate it all!

This recipe is very good! I made it exactly as written, with no changes. It turned out moist and very chocolatey! I will be making this again, next time w/ yellow cake mix, butterscotch pudding, and butterscotch chips. YUM!

I've made this cake once before, following the recipe exactly, and it was a hit! Now that it's close to Christmas, I wanted to change it slightly, so instead of semisweet chocolate chips, I used Andes Mint baking chips. It came out DELICIOUS! To anyone who thinks this cake is "too" chocolatey (not that I understand that anyway), the mint flavor combines to make a perfectly chocolate and perfectly minty cake. I'm afraid I might eat the whole thing.

Wow! I made 2 cakes tonight. I made the first one just like the recipes says. Very easy and very tasty. The second one, I used spice cake mix, instant french vanilla pudding and cinnamon chips. Oh, what a scrumptious combination. Thank you.

If you're looking for something REALLY quick and easy to satisfy a chocolate craving- this is it.  I follwed the recipe as listed (used Duncan Hines Devils food cake mix and non-instant chocolate pudding).  I did however add 1/2 cup chopped pecans in the mix just because I love nuts in brownies, which this cake resembles.  Next time I may put 1/2 the chocolate chips in the batter misx, and 1/2 on top just to spread the chocolate love throughout the cake more.  It is very rich and I HAD to have milk with it to really make it.  It would be great too served warm with a scoop of ice cream or fresh whipped cream.  I will make again when I want chocolate cake, but not a lot of fussy mixing and baking.

I needed a snack for kiddos today and did an ingredient search, this recipe came up.  However I did not have chocolate anything (very depresing, I know!)  I did however have a white cake mix and lemon pudding!  I didn't have any chips either so just made it without and drizzled a little lemon frosting glaze on top.  The kids loved it!

What do you do when you realize you have to make a birthday cake for a work party the next day and you've been cleaning all day and have no energy to go to the store?  You raid your pantry and you make this cake!  So good, so easy, and did I mention it was good??  Followed it exactly and bam - I had a cake that made my co-workers drool AND ask for the recipe.  Totally awesome heated up just a bit with some ice cream.  Thanks!

Wonderful!  I made it for a family reunion last weekend and it was a hit.  If you're a chocoholic you'll love it.  I even bought a pint of whole milk just for this and finished it off with the skim milk I have at home.  I also used Duncan Hines devils food cake mix.  It would be great with roasted pecans in it and served warm with vanilla ice cream.  It's a rich, dense dark chocolate cake, so if you like that, you have to try it!

I used to have my own restaurant and had a Sunday buffet with 6 or 8 different homemade desserts, and this was one of the favorites w/ vanilla ice cream on top, only I cheated and made this very easy recipe even easier.  I used canned pudding!!  It was something we had on hand for kids and it worked perfectly.  Turned this into a 5 min. dish.

This cake was soooo goood!  I used a yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding.  I put a mixture of walnuts, butterscotch, and chocolate chips.  I think you could have endless combinations with this recipe idea.  My family is not big on chocolate, the reason I tried the other combo.

Boys & Girls this cake deserves a much classier name!  My family went nuts over it.  I used vanilla pudding with a Duncan Hines Chocolate Fudge cake mix. This is THE easiest cake that I have ever made, and I have made plenty in the last 45 years. We're calling it the "Illegal To Eat Cake" (surely it will be against the law to enjoy anything that much in the future)Thank you so much for this recipe.

Very easy and chocolaty. I would make it again and although I don't like desserts, the flavor was good. My only concern was the fact that the top came out somewhat chewy, kind of a brownie consistency. Otherwise, a good recipe. Definitely check it after 30 minutes.

I tried this recipe today. I had one small packet of instant chocolate pudding mix and another small box of pistachio instant pudding-- I used both. Instead of milk, I used almond milk then added about 6 tablespoons of almond extract (I didn't have vanilla). I used a regular cake mix. Once the batter was mixed and thick, I then sprinkled semi-sweet chocolate chips and folded it into the batter. I baked it at 325 degrees for about an hour. The cake was fluffy and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is great!  The possibilities of different cake mixes, pudding mixes and chips are endless!  Can't wait to try with lemon cake mix and vanilla pudding and white choc. chips.  ....Or yellow cake mix with peanut butter chips....oh my....

OMG!  This cake is to die for!  I made it for my nephew's birthday party and it was gone within seconds.  No joke!  You have to really like chocolate to enjoy this cake.

Weird texture to the cake.  Tasted good warmed up with a scoop of ice cream, but I don't think I'll make this again.

This was ok at best.  I completely agree with the review that it was bland, and needed an icing instead of just chocolate chips on top.  I 100% agree that with the expense of the mix, pudding, and chocolate chips, it wasn't worth it.  I'll never make it again.

Thank you for submitting this recipe. I have been trying to find this recipes for years. My mom made it dozens of times when I was a kid. We couldn't find the recipes in any of her books or notes. It is a fantastic chocolate cake, tastes like chocolate heaven. I knew it had to be easy because Mom never wasted time on any complicated cake recipes. This recipes is exactly the way Mom made it. I made it and it turned out great. Can't wait to surprise my sister with it.

This came out great!  I wasn't sure because half the reviews said no, and half said yes.  But my extended family loved it - none left.  Served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

this was very good! i was short on oil & didnt have quite enough to make a regular cake, and this recipe was a great substitute! i omited the chocolate chips (i love chocolate but am not a fan of chocolate chips on things) & i also put german chocolate frosting on top that i mixed with 1/8 tsp of vanilla and 2 tbsp of caramel syrup(the liquid kind used to flavor coffee).   for those who have had problems with how your cake came out... bake times vary. it just depends on what kind of oven you have, what altitude you're at, how old your oven is, so on and so forth. also, glass pans and non-stick or dark pans both require differnt bake times. 40-45 minutes may not always be best for you and your oven or pan. i almost always judge when a cake or brownie mix is done by sticking a toothpick in the center & if it comes out clean your mix is done! sometimes i take my mixes out of the oven when there is just a tiny bit of goop on the end of the toothpick, and it comes out perfect for my taste. for this recipe, it only took 18 minutes in my oven for it to be done.  thank you for the recipe! my husband and i loved it and will absolutely make it again!

I don't know what happened.  The cake turned out very dry and the chips didn't melt.  I'm giving it 2 stars because my husband and sons actually finished it.  I'm not one to turn down either chocolate or cake, so you know there's a problem.

really great recipe and so versatile! not a chocolate lover? try this with yellow cake mix, lemon or vanilla pudding mix and chopped canned fruit over the top. also- i used sugar free pudding mix and replaced half the milk with water to make it more figure friendly and it turned out great! if your cake mix come with pudding in the mix (like the betty crocker kind) don't worry- it makes the end result even more like one big brownie!

YUM! My husband called and sounded like he'd had a rough day so I was looking for something to whip up in a hurry to cheer him up. It worked!! I used Duncan Hines Devils Food Mix as suggested by another reviewer. I also used Nestles Mini Morsels, which I think might have worked better than regular sized chips. 

Alos, I thought this would be better served warm, but as it turns out, it is best after it is refrigerated and the chocolate hardens on top. WOW. It is a really dense moist cake, almost like a brownie, but better. And very easy! 

The only thing I gave it 4 stars for is because it is boring LOOKING. I only give 5 stars to recipes that taste and present well.

I didn't have chocolate pudding or chocolate cake mix, so I used a white cake with lemon pudding and then put a lemon glaze over the top. It was AWESOME!!!!!!! We loved it and can't wait to try the real recipe with the chocolate. Definitely needs vanilla ice cream to go with it.

This cake is definately a dense cake.  (That is not a bad thing!)  The cake took a lot longer to bake than mentioned, and was still really moist when done.  It was too moist for my preference, but the guys loved it!

This cake is AWESOME! My kids & husband loved it & could not be easier to make. Tastes more like a rich gooey brownie...needless to say, the entire cake was eaten in one night. Will definitely be making this again & again & trying out different flavor combinations. THANK YOU!

It could be because of the brand of cake mix I used (duncan hines, I think) but I did not care for this.  Even my teenage boys said it just isn't normal. The cake turned out overly chewy and without enough chocolate flavor.  The texture was just downright weird.  Nope, don't do it.

Try using peanut butter morsels instead of semi sweet chocolate chips - fabulous!  I think I may have let the pudding get a little to thick before adding the cake mix.  Will watch more closely for next time and that will be soon.

I doubled this to make one for work and one for home.  After I tasted it, I didn't take it to work.  Don't know what I'll do with all this cake now. The texture is strange (pastier than cake but not as dense as a brownie).  I followed directions exactly and used quality ingredients.

This cake is a chocaholics new favorite in our family.  Instead of the stove top pudding which i didnt have i used 2 small boxes of the instant pudding (devils food of course)  It was very simple to make and im going to make sure to have lots of milk on hand everytime i make this one.

So easy and delicious! I accidentally mixed in the chocolate chips which of course was great, then decorated the top with some large chocolate chips. I'm going to try this with other flavors and see how it works.

Very good and very easy. Nice chewy consistency. Kind of like a "triple chocolate overdose". I will make this again sometime, but will probably divide the recipe in half. I did lightly oil a spatula to make spreading of the batter easier. We liked it best slightly warmed in the microwave then topped with a scoop or two of ice-cream.

This was a really easy cake to make.  Was extremely flavorful and moist.  I'm giving it four stars because there were too many chocolate chips on top.  After the cake cooled the chips hardened back up and I felt like I was chewing rocks.  I might try chocolate syrup or something like it next time.

Cake was way overcooked.  I only cooked it 30 minutes and the recipes calls for 40-45. I have a brand new oven so I don't think it's my oven.

This was delicious!  I didn't have non-instant pudding either, so I used the large package of Jell-O Mint Chocolate Chip instant pudding mix, and only used one cup of chocolate chips and it turned out great!! I ate it warm with a little Cool Whip on top.  Heavenly!  It's a keeper!

BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I'VE EVER HAD! 
I have no idea what the original poster is talking about with non-instant chocolate pudding so I just used instant. I made it for a bake sale and ti was gone within 10 minutes and they kept asking if I had more. Definitely going to make again and again!

I misread the recipe the first time and used instant pudding.  DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE.  I had to throw it all out and start over.  Using Cook and Serve pudding, it was very good.  I left off the chocolate chips and topped it with coffee ice cream and hot fudge.  Delicious.

One of my co-workers brought this in for a unit get-together about 30 years ago!  We had no idea what it was called so decided to call it Denny's Deluxe since "Denny" was the person that brought it in. The only thing additional that we did was to add chopped walnuts on top along with cool whip which cut down on the too chocolate flavor.  It's an easy recipe and one that everyone seems to like.

I found the recipe for this cake last summer and have made it several times since. It was a hit and I had several guests at summer party ask for the recipe. My favorite way to make this cake is with peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. I also prefer it warm with vanilla ice cream, but it is still great later. I love how easy this cake recipe is, without looking like I made a cake from the box.

We did not like this.  The consistency was spongy and it tasted artificial.  I'll stick with just adding a cup of sour cream to a box cake mix to make it tasty.

I thought this was just - ok. Husband is the chocolate freak and he liked it real well.
   However when a small scoop of Spumoni was had with the cake - WOW! it really made it for me. I highly reccomend Spumoni icecream with this.

Nothing spectacular for my group. I followed the instructions exactly. The cake was sort of rubbery. As the cake cooled the crunch of the chocolate chips just overpowered everything.

MmmMmm.. moist fudgy chocolate yumminess.
I found this recipe when I was looking for something to bake without eggs.. (I didn't have any and the shops were closed).  I used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate and since I didn't have any chocolate chips I left those out.  It didn't matter though.. because this cake is delicious.  We had it with warm custard poured over the top.. It was chocolate/custard heaven.

Karen A certainly knows cakes.  Took this to a pot luck and they gobbled it up.  Now I am making one to take in to work.  Both have been chocolate.  Yummy!  This is a very good cake and easy to make.  The only things I changed was to add some chocolate chips to the cake/pudding mix (to give it an all around more chocolaty taste) and to bake it for about 30 minutes (my oven is a little strange).  Thanks!

This cake is easy and delicious. I took it to work and it was devoured!  The batter is very thick and next time I will make sure to smooth it down in the cake pan.  I thought it would flatten out by itself but it didn't.  I will definately make this again and I am going to experiment with different cakes and puddings.

This cake should be re named to "HO HO or Ding Dong cake"!  Eat it after it's cooled and you would think you were eating a hostess treat.  Next time I make it I will add some kind of marshmallow mixture to the cake after cooled.  I love the idea of using different mixes.  It's a great cake for us (even if it's a little costly) because of my daughters egg allergy.  She was so excited to eat cake!

This was delicious, very moist and chocolate-y!  Definitely for chocolate lovers.  I tried one reviewer's idea of using half white chocolate/ half semi-sweet chips, and my white chips almost burnt! Next time, I'll stick to the recipe.

This recipe was great.  We used a dark chocolate cake mix and a mixture of double chocolate and milk chocolate chips on top.  Needless to say it disappeared quickly.

Really great chocolate taste; unfortunately, the texture was quite rubbery.  The cake mix I used was "low fat" though, so that may have been the problem.

You can also make this in a crock pot and it’s kinda like a lava cake.  Very easy and always have requests for it at work gatherings.

I just love this cake for its versatility. I mix most of the chocolate chips into the batter and usually add some chopped pecans and mini marshmallows too and call it "Rocky Road Cake". It isn't usually a pretty cake, but a little powdered sugar on top dresses it up a little.  It comes out dense and moist. We love it!

I made it exactly like the recipe only I used dark chocolate chips and I mixed them into the batter. Very fudgey like a brownie. I topped it with powdered sugar. Wish I would have bought vanilla ice cream.

I didn't make any changes this time, and will definitely make again. I do plan on trying different flavors which I think William be interesting. It was well enjoyed by friends. Also, we liked it serve warm with a scoop of ice cream. It's pretty versatile.

In Canada our packages are in metric, so the sizing is different.  The size of the chocolate pudding is different, so I measured out the correct amount (as per the recipe) but the size of the cake mix is much smaller than it used to be.  I used the new size.  I cooked it for 35 minutes only.  It was lovely.  My family raved about the taste and texture.  Next time though I would only do 1 cup of chocolate chips as 2 was too much we felt.  So simple and delicious.  Thanks

Very tasty and I made this as-is. I don't know what went wrong in my oven, but it came out very chewy - like chewing gum. A + for taste, fail for texture. So sad this didn't come out to match the terrific reviews.  Thanks for sharing your easy recipe. I may try again, but I followed it exactly this first time. Stumped. ***11-2018 Now I think I know what went wrong. I used a box of Hershey's chocolate pudding. I think it was that brand that made it go wrong. IF I need to make pudding from a box, I use Hershey's, otherwise, use Jell-O brand for this. Made this afterwards and NO issues using the Jell-O pudding. Upgraded the stars from 3 to 4 since this was my goof!

THIS is the BEST chocolate cake you have EVER tasted..!! My mother-in-law introduced me to this YEARS ago and I have never looked back..!! OMG.. It’s been my ‘go to’ chocolate cake always..! You can use any cake mix. Doesn’t have to be SUPER DUPER ‘name-brand’ variety..! I would put the dry cake mix in a bowl, make the pudding, add the pudding to the dry cake mix,  mix well, put into a 13x9 pan, sprinkle with chocolate bits. BAKE..!! OMG.. the BEST..!!! Thanks for reminding me..!

This cake was good. It was thick and dense but not dry. I would have preferred no chocolate chips on top. I didn't like the consistency of the chips. Maybe next time I will mix the chips in the cake before baking.

Thought it was quite bland and lacking flavor.  I only used half the chocolate chips the recipe called for on top. Maybe that is why.

very good cake, chocolatey and very quick to throw together. it stays moist and nice after days! I put big chunks of chocolate on top and they didn't melt thoroughly: my kids fought about whose slice had the big piece of choc...

Texture was really unappealing (kind of lumpy and doughy seeming) and there wasn't a lot of taste to it considering all the chocolate that went into it.  Two of my kids refused to eat it at all after two bites, and my hubby politely ate one piece.  We won't be making it again which is unfortunate because it was so quick and easy to put together.

My husband was in the desert/confection businessfor many years (pretty picky) and he liked it!  Definitely for chocolate lovers.

This was so easy to put together, what a time saver.  No sooner had the cake come out of the oven and over half was gone!!!!!  This is great with peppermint ice cream served on top!!  Already have given this recipe out to several neighbors, and they are raving!!!
