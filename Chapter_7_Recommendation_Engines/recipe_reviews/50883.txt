Perfect idea and great taste; the only suggestion would be to sprinkle cheese first and then again last to ensure that the other filling stay in the quesedilla.

This was a great meal for the cottage. When my girl friend and I spent a week at the cottage we planned out a week worth of BBQ recipes from various places around the world.  The Quesadillas were simple to make and tasted Great!I would suggest being creative when making them though.  Add some red and yellow peppers for example to give them more color.Another piece of advice would be to just lightly oil the ouside of the quesadialls instead of putting the oil on the grill.Thanks for a great contribution.Glen (from Cottage Country)ps/ This recipe can work in the oven too, but keep a close eye on them.

Definately take the suggestion of putting the cheese on both sides to hold the ingredients in and using your imagination with the ingredients. I used chicken instead of shrimp because I am allergic to shellfish. Also, instead of brushing oil on the outside, I used a little melted butter. Watch them closely. Love the grill marks.

This is a great summer time  recipe for the grill.  I followed the advice with the cheese on either side to hold the filling together.  Worked great!

Loved these fun quesadillas. The grill marks look great, and I used melted butter on both sides, which made the flour tortilla crispy and flaky, not to mention delicious.

Overall these were pretty good but honestly we just prefer the traditional quesadillas, it may be because I used whole wheat tortillas. Sounded good though!

Great weekend food.  Kids love them.  You can spice them up or keep them milder  just by adding jalapenas.  Love these.

These were very good and easy to adapt to individual tastes and dietary needs. Added black beans to all of them. Left out cilantro, substituting flat leaf parsley. Left the shrimp out for the vegetarians. Put cheese under and on top of the filling so that it would stick together. Thanks!
