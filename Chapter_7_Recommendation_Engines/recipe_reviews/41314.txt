This recipe was a total hit for an adult birthday party. I served it with Vanilla Wafers. I made it the day before, added pecans and chocolate chips inside the ball...it took about 24 hours to get hard enough to shape, I rolled it in chocolate chips and pecans also. Definately make in advance

This has become a holiday tradition in my house.  People are pleasantly surprised by this sweet cheese ball.  My favorite is to serve it with chocolate graham crackers.

I am updating my rating of this recipe.  I have made this several times.  I have learned that you can use 1/3 less fat or regular cream cheese but it WILL NOT work with fat free cream cheese.  It's doesn't matter if you use brand name or store brand.  Also users may want to use the Keebler brand graham cracker STICKs.  They are the perfect accessory for this recipe.  I have also used GROUND nuts to cover the cheese ball.  You can find this in your local grocery store.

If you use a fat-free or fat-reduced cream cheese, it is not possible to shape into a ball, even with the addition of extra powdered sugar.  Makes a great frosting recipe though.  Have to go for the calories on this one and use the full fat to get a good cheeseball.

LOVED this, as did the women I served it to. I added pre-packaged Heath candy bar bits (enough to combine with the chips) and followed other reviewers input to cut back a little on the powdered sugar and up the brown sugar to 3 tablespoons. I made it well ahead of time (about 2 days, just so I would have one less thing to do when company arrived) - let it set in the fridge as it was (after stirring together); formed it into a ball and froze it (on parchment paper) for a few hours. Pulled it out an hour before eating it, put it on top of some food-processed crushed pecans in a bowl and shook the bowl enough to coat each side. Used a cheese spreader to spread it onto choc. graham cracker sticks as others suggested. Can't sing this recipe's praises enough, and so EASY!

This was wonderful!  I took it to a potluck and people I'd never met before were asking me for the recipe.  I rolled mine in graham cracker crumbs & more chocolate chip instead of nuts and that worked beautifully.

I made this for a bachularette party... it tastes great... but i got generic graham crackers, and they tasted stale, so not many people ate it, but the ones that did said it was great.  I had to explain it to them a couple of times so they would understand it was a desert.  Probably would do better with a more adult, non-picky eater group.  I honestly didn't have any problem making it.  I let it sit in the bowl in the regrig over night, rolled it up in saran wrap, and stuck it in the freezer until i was ready to serve it.  It was perfect! (Kinda looked like a Hershey's Kiss) Oh, and I didn't roll mine in any nuts, just more chocolate chips.

This recipe is a winner all around!  I've made it several times for different functions and everyone loves it once they realize it's a dessert cheese ball.

Be careful when mixing it though - the mixture gets way too soft to handle.  I put it in the freezer to firm up.  Then I shape it into a ball.  Then I freeze it again to firm it up enough to add the pecan coating.  I then wrap the cheese ball in foil and keep it frozen until about 30 minutes prior to serving.

this recipe is great.  However, some people are confused by cookies being served with what looks like a regular cheese ball.  Try rolling the ball in a mixture of pecans and mini chocolate chips to identify it as a sweet cheese ball.  I serve with chocolate wafers and gingersnaps.

I made this for a women's meeting and everyone that tried it loved it.  Many people asked me for the recipe.  I used light cream cheese and rolled in left over chocolate chips.  I refrigerated it overnight and then I placed in the freezer for about an hour and had no problems rolling into a ball.

This was so simple to make and got raves at the party I took it to.  I shaped it into a big Hershey Kiss and covered it with the mini chocolate chips instead of the pecans.  I had more than one request for the recipe.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!

This recipe (or quite similar) is a staple on my catering menu. Rather than shaping the entire thing into a ball, I use a cookie scoop and serve them in individual portions with shortbread sticks. Always a huge huge hit.

Huge hit!  I'm giving just four stars however because I made a few changes ... First I added more powdered sugar & brown sugar - the cream cheese taste was too much for me and I wanted more of a cookie dough taste - kept adding the sugars until I reached my own desirable taste ... Second, I used the suggestion of rolling it in the mini chips rather than nuts so my guests would recognize it as a sweet appetizer ... Served it with chocolate graham crackers and pretzels ... Everyone asked for the recipe!!

Really, really good. I divided the ball in half (refridgerated for 24 hours), rolled one in mini m&m's and the other in chopped walnuts. The one w/m&m's disappeared, the one with walnuts was tried, but obviously not the favorite. Next time it's m&m's all the way. Big hit at the party!

I served this at a Halloween party so I added orange food coloring--looked very cute--made a stem to look like a pumpkin. The flavor was okay. I would put this in a "serve to kids" category. I would not serve this at a party of adults.

I needed a kid treat for day care - I decided to make this as a dip instead of a formed ball. I used spreadable cream cheese instead of the brick and added 1cup icing sugar, 3tbs brown sugar, 1/2tsp vanilla & 1 cup mini chips. Mixed it altogether & spooned it into a dish. I topped it with a mixture of mini chips and skor toffee pieces. Cookies were animal crackers & teddy grahams (choc & vanilla) The kids & teachers loved it!!

This was a great recipe. I followed previous reviewer's ideas with the powdered sugar and brown sugar. It was a hit at a 1st b-day party. Rolling it in oreo's and using mimi m&m's were key

This is AWESOME!  I made this as a snack for Thanksgiving day.  Huge hit!  I recommend freezing it for a little while before you roll it in the nuts.  If you make it a few days or weeks in advance, put it in the freezer then pull it out about an hour before you serve it.  I served it with Graham Cracker "Honey Sticks"...they are a little more sturdy for scooping into the cheese ball.  I plan on making a couple of these and keeping them in my freezer for last minute needs.

I make this recipe all the time and it is a HUGE hit. I have also used mini M&M's in place of the mini chocolate chips (to make it look kind of like confetti) and rolled it in crushed oreos and served it w/ teddy grahams (for kids parties) Also good served w/ graham cracker sticks.

Absolutely delicious.  The kids and adults were fighting over it.  I served it with Honey Maid graham cracker sticks - a variety of chocolate, honey, and cinnamon.  It was amazing.

This does not taste like cookie dough.  You can tell it's supposed to, but it doesn't.  I added half cup of graham cracker crumbs & an additional 1/8c brown sugar to the ball & that improved the flavor - more realistic - but maybe, just maybe, we'll have to stick to eating dough from the bowl or indulging in the ice cream.  No, it wasn't bad; but I won't be making it again.

I took this to work and everyone wanted to recipe.  I didn't form it into a ball, just served it in the bowl as a dip and instead of regular graham crackers, I used the graham cracker sticks.  It was definately a hit!  Tastes just like cookie dough. Thanks

Wow! Is all I can say. Forget the graham crackers I ate this with just a spoon. After I served it to my guests, of course. I can't wait to make it again but my waist says I have to wait a little while.

Very sweet, but very good.  Perfect as gifts and easy to make.  I will roll in mini-chips next time instead of nuts.

Fairly easy to prepare and delicious! I did keep it in the fridge a little longer than instructed each time though to help it get a little more firm (as suggested by previous reviewers.)It was a hit at the party I took it to last night. I have already been instructed to pass on the recipe!

Awesome recipe!  My family is not crazy about pecans, so I rolled this in miniature chocolate chips instead, and it was great.  Served it with the graham crackers and vanilla wafers at an office party, and it was a huge hit.

This was delicious! Everyone at my party raved about it and kept going back for more. The only problem is that I couldn't get it to roll into a ball even though I chilled it for 4 hours. I ended up just putting it in a bowl like it was meant to be a dip. I also sprinkled some Halloween colored m&ms on it. I served it with chocolate graham cracker sticks and the flavors mixed really well. I will definitely be making this again. A lot!

What a fun and yummy dessert idea! It was a big hit, but even though I served it with graham cracker sticks and nilla wafers, people mistook it for a typical cheese ball and tried it w/ wheat thins.  After they got over the inital shock and realized it was a dessert, they gobbled it up.  It tasted just like cookie dough.

Very good!!  Read a few of the other reviews and added extra powdered sugar to thicken it up a bit. There was no way to make this into a ball----so I just put it in a pretty pie plate and sprinkled the pecans on top. Used graham cracker sticks for dipping.

This cheeseball is terrific and a real attention getter at parties.  I take it to all events that require you to bring a food dish.  It is very unique and taste wonderful.  It is not too sweet.  Try it at your next event...You will be the hit of the party...Don't take it out until is ready to be served.  It doesn't stay cold very long....

I wouldn't say this "tastes just like cookie dough" but a lot of people thought it LOOKED like cookie dough. Mine never became really firm, but it did stay relatively in shape after I took it out of the plastic wrap and put it on the serving plate. Thinking about the recipe, all it really is is cream cheese frosting with chocolate chips in it, so the expectation that it would ever get as firm as a "real" cheese ball is probably unrealistic. Everyone who tried it thought it was really good and several people asked for the recipe. I thought the taste of butter was a little too dominant and I might try it with only 1/4 cup next time.

Soooo yummmy!!!  I would recommend adding additional brown sugar to taste.  When I serve this, I don't even shape it into a ball, I just put in pretty dish and serve with graham cracker sticks.  I don't like nuts mixed in, so I omit that.

This is so yummy and easy.  Make it at least a day ahead of time.  I also had a chocolate fondue at the party that this was served and some of the guest took the large pretzel sticks for the fondue and used them with this spread.  The sweet and salty was very good!This is a fun and different dessert.

Everyone really liked this recipe, several people commented on how yummy it was.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and increased my powdered sugar to 1 cup and the brown sugar to 3 Tbsp.
It really did taste like chocolate chip cookie dough!  I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.

I love this recipe!  I have made it many times with no problems.  Any event I have made it for, they always ask for the recipe and I go home with an empty container. Very good with choc. grahams.   I also have used reg. sized choc. chips if I didn't have the little ones.

I made this for Christmas Eve.  I was disappointed! I added more brown sugar and less powdered sugar, as others suggested. In addition, I had a very hard time shaping this into anything resembling a ball.  I did manage to get it into a round shape and added mini chips all over it. I served it with the graham cracker sticks. It looked pretty, however, my guests seemed to share my feelings and tastebuds, I had almost an entire plate left, that was thrown away. I'm glad I added more brown sugar, but even doing that it still tasted like cream cheese and butter to me. Definately will not make again. I would strongly recommend trying a half batch, if you're debating on giving this recipe a try. Thanks anyways, it did sound like it would be good. Sorry for a thumbs down, but any recipe I have to throw away, gets the thumbs down in our house.

This is a great recipe and I can't wait to make it again. I did find that the longer it chilled in the fridge the firmer it got. It was still very soft after an hour. Next time I will plan for it a day ahead and let it chill overnight.

made this last weekend for family get-together.  Everyone loved it! I didn't have any trouble shaping it into a ball, and rolled it in the leftover chocolate chips instead of nuts.  I was asked for the recipe several times!

Another fabulous recipe.  Always a hit and many requests for the recipe.  I agree with previous reviews, decrease the powdered sugar and increase the brown sugar.  I use a deep bowl lined with plastic wrap as my mold and press mini chocolate chips on it after inverting on to a plate.  This one will always be a hit with my family and friends. :)

I made this for my husband to take to work for a party and everyone loved it, and wanted the recipe. I did not have a hard time molding it into a ball. I think the trick is to really beat the cream cheese mixture and ref for a good 2 hours.

Mine came out soft because I used "light" cream cheese (you have to use regular cream cheese to be firm enough for a ball).  I served it in a bowl with chocolate graham cracker sticks.  I used less butter.  Very good.

The only reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is no way it would form into a ball! The taste, however, is delicious. I fought with this, refrigerated it and then froze it, but there was no easy way to form it into a ball- I ended up making a huge mess of it. Served as a dip with chocolate graham crackers, it went over very well at work for Food Day.

Definitely tasted more like chocolate chip cheesecake than cookie dough. Yummy, but one or two scoops is plenty - probably won't make again.

This is a holiday staple at our home. This will be the 4th year that I have made this (however I do coat it in oreo crumbs instead of nuts) and usually have to make at least two. Everyone looks forward to it and I'm going to try it this year with some red and green sprinkles mixed with the coating.

This is the perfect treat for any type of potluck.  It's different and unusual and oh so good!  I made it for my staff at work and it was devoured while the photocopier was busy duplicating the recipe.  Thanks for a good one!  I really like serving it with a variety of cookies including animal crackers and chocolate fingers.

Well, I didn't do it as directed, but it makes a great dip! I "accidently" used margarine instead of butter (phone ringing, kid screaming, cat meowing, dog barking kind of accident). It takes great but it won't ball with margarine:) I'll remember that next time.

Delicious and easy.  It is very soft and has to be refrigerated for quite a while.  I served it with an assortment of animal crackers, Teddy grahams, nilla wafers, etc, and everyone loved it.  I rolled mine in chocolate wafer crumbs for the people who don't care for nuts.

By far one of the best and easiest desserts I've ever made!  This is a definite crowd pleaser and I have yet to find anyone that doesn't like it.  YUMMY!!!

One tip:  If you're going to be letting this sit out for a long period of time, it might be beneficial to put it in a cool location or perhaps in a chilzine cooler (like Pampered Chef sells) to keep it cool.

I mixed up the cream cheese mixture the day before (I added toffee chips w/ the mini-chips) & let it sit in the fridge overnight. Then I shaped it into a ball & put it in the freezer for an hour before rolling in crushed graham crackers. Served it w/  cinnamon graham sticks & vanilla wafers but most everyone preferred the vanilla wafers. It was a hit at my granddaughter's birthday party!

I had high hopes for this recipe. I followed the recipe with no substitutions. I made one with the graham cracker crumbs and one with some crushed oreo crumbs (the boxed kind). I served it with the graham cracker sticks. I ate more of it than anyone else but nobody seemed really interested in it. I kept wondering what I might have done wrong since all of the reviews were so high. I then realized that I don't really like cookie dough unless it is just that - dough! (ie I don't like cookie dough ice cream etc). Maybe that is why I didnt care for it. I don't know why nobody else was thrilled. I won't be trying it again.

Very sweet!  Followed advice to increase the brown sugar (to 3T) and confectioners sugar (to 1 c) to taste more like cookie dough.  Maybe sweetened it too much.  My kids and husband loved it.  Me, not so much.

This is a hit at every function I serve it!  As long as I use stick butter and it firms up great for me.  Sometimes I make it with tub butter (margarine) and serve in a bowl as a dip instead of a ball.  Either way is great.  I serve with graham cracker sticks.  I will have to try pretzels next time.

This recipe is terrific! Popular with both the adults and the kids. 
I took it recently to a cookout and someone else showed up with the same thing. I thought this recipe was unusual enough that there wouldn't be duplicates, but people ended up eating both of them. 
I had read the reviews about it not doing well as a ball, so I didn't even try. I just put it in a container and served it as a spread with vanilla wafers and graham sticks.

We love this cheeseball!!! It's important to make it in advance so that it will firm up. We love it with animal crackers .. also graham cracker sticks and vanilla wafers. Next time I'll try the pretzels, yumm!

This is good but if you expect it to taste exactly like cookie dough, you'll be disappointed.  I will try again, maybe using more brown sugar and less butter as others have suggested.

My roommate loves cookie dough (she buys the refridgerated kind and eats it cold), so I made this for her birthday party.  It was a huge hit with everyone.  I agree that it tastes best with pretzels, so you get that great sweet & salty combination.

This is a wonderful party dish. It is very easy to make, and everyone loves it! I am now only invited to parties if I bring this dessert ball along with me. Instead of graham crackers, I serve it with vanilla wafers.

I really enjoyed this appetizer, and it was just so yummy!  I ended up making two smaller cheese balls out of it,and freezing one for later use.

This item is always a hit!  I vary my cheese ball a bit though, I skip the pecans and for extra sweetness I use both semisweet and butterscotch chips!  Always good with Honey Graham Crackers and Chocolate Graham Crackers.

Very, very tasty.  It was a little soft, and instead of going to the trouble of trying to roll it into a ball, we should have just put it in a bowl and used it as a dip. It's great with the Honey Graham sticks.

What a creative idea!  I make a regular cheeseball that gets rave reviews and am always asked to bring it.  This one is a nice change - I'll try it out on some friends this weekend.  I tried it the first day, but then had some of it leftover the second day.  I thought it tasted even better on day 2.  The chocolate chips were still very crunchy, but had melded into the flavor of the cream cheese a bit more.  Any ideas on what it can be served with besides graham crackers??

Coworkers LOVED this!  They are men so I wasn't sure if this would be their type of recipe, but it was a hit.  I personally will put in an entire cup of the powdered sugar for consistency and a little less cream cheese taste, maybe a little extra brown sugar.  I am making it again for Christmas Eve though!

I used reduced fat cream cheese and had some difficulity rolling into a ball, but the end product was still wonderful!  Next time i will increase the brown sugar a tablespoon.

Took this to a Christmas party and everyone just loved it. Didn't have mini chips so I chopped up regular chips and was left with a powdery mess, but, this chocolate powder made the perfect coating with chopped almonds to roll the ball in.  Definitely making this one again and again!

Easy and delicious! Found it was too soft (even after all night in the refrigerator) to form into a ball so I just put in in a bowl, sprinkled with pecans, and served it as a dip.

This recipe is a big hit wherever I take it!  Sometimes I have trouble getting it to set into a ball, so I take it in a little glass bowl.  I have also found that it's nice to roll the ball in the extra mini-chocolate chips instead of pecans.  This is an awesome recipe!

This was soooo good. We had an Easter dinner and an Easter lunch to go to and I wish I had brought it for both gatherings!! Everyone loved it at the Easter lunch - goes perfect with the chocolate graham crackers. I rolled it in left over mini chocolate chips. This was a great invention!

I wrote a previous review before I had my party and just had to follow up. I got so many compliments on this. It is more like chocolate chip cheesecake and I had 2 people at the party that don't like cheesecake (go figure) and they both loved this. One of the girls asked if I had any left after she left the party and wanted to come back for more. She said she kept thinking about it. So I am making her another one and printing out this recipe for her. This was excellent and set up wonderfully as a ball for me which I rolled in more mini chips. (make sure to use butter not margarine and regular fat brick cream cheese. Let chill for a couple hours and you should have no problems.) Thanks again for a great recipe.

I'll give this five stars for ease and taste. I found the recipe the morning of the Super Bowl, had the ingredients on hand, whipped it up before church and let it chill. I didn't attempt to form it into a ball, but served it as a spread with graham cracker sticks. I sent it with my son to a Super Bowl party and the bowl came back empty with requests for the recipe. I did use lowfat cream cheese and left out the pecans.

My friends were hesitant to try it but thought it was great once they tried it.  Had requests for more.

MOST EXCELLANT - I served w/ graham crackers.  I will serve again and again and again. I did not use light cream cheese, I used regular so it held it's shape.  I also drizzled a little chocolate sauce on it to make it look even prettier.

I can't tell you how many times I've made this 
since I found the recipe. It is wonderful. I served with the new graham cracker sticks and I've
not found one person that hasn't loved it.

This recipe tasted good.  I followed it to the letter and couldn't get it to form a ball so I left it as a spread.  Adults and children alike loved it.

This is my standard "bring to the party" dish.  It serves well with the graham cracker stix.  It is fabulous and so easy.  Spread it on banana bread too...

Very good. Be careful when shaping, even after chilling it's still very soft. I thought it  tasted like cheesecake, not cookie dough. I left off the pecans and just sprinkled it with red and green sugar crystals.

This was okay.  I don't think it tastes anything like cookie dough--more like chocolate chip cheese cake.  This sat in the refrigerator for a few days and I ended up throwing half of it out.  It wasn't terrible, just not what I expected.

Just like cookie dough!  I served mine with vanilla wafers and it was great.  I also froze it until ready to serve, and it held up considerably well even outside in 80 degree temperature.

This went over very well with my guests...after I explained that it was dessert.  Tastes great with chocolate "vanilla" wafers!  It melts in your hands, so be ready when you attempt to shape it into a ball.

Yep, this is yummy.  Mine didn't have the consistency to roll into a ball so I just put it in a bowl and sprinkled the nuts on the top.  Also was fantastic with strawberries.
