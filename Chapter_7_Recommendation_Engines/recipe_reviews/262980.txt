Very good turkey meatloaf. Cooked pretty much by the direction, but had to add a little time (probably because of the pan type); used internal temp to determine doneness and it tasted great. As with any ground turkey, season it up. The Italian flavor in bread crumb and onion did that, plus catsup when eating it. Only reason for a 4 star is I enjoyed turkey meatloaf recipes using tomato paste and/or catsup better. That is personal preference though.
