I substituted chicken and chicken broth because I didn’t have any ground beef on hand. Wow it was good. I served it Texas style by cooking up some rice so that a spoonful could be ladled into the middle of the bowl. Delicious with tortillas!

I put a little garlic powder and onion powder in it. If I'd had time I would have finely chopped an onion and put in it. It was a good supper.
