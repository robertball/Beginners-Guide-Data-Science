It important that you use Carl Budding Beef and not roast beef as AR added into the review page narrative. You can also you dried salted beef but you must omit the salt from the recipe and soak your beef to remove some of the salt (not as quick and easy). I use 2 heaping tablespoons of flour per cup of milk (AR calculates that at about 3/4 cup). They changed my directions also. Add the entire milk mixture to butter and whisk constantly until thickened (5-7 min). For thinner cream chipped beef use pre warmed milk before adding the flour for thicker use cold milk.

This was the closest to my Mom's Recipe that I could find. The only thing she did different was she'd start in a frying pan with the butter & melt over med heat, then she'd had the chopped/shredded beef, then she'd add the flour & kind of coat the pieces of beef in the flour.  After a "Roux" was kind of made, then she'd gradually add the milk & stir until no lumps were there. Then she'd add the salt (easy) & pepper to taste. Cut the heat up a little til it got thick & bubbly & then serve it over plain toast. Yuuummyy!!  Makes me want some NOW!!

Just like my mum made when I was a kid. I used to use Armor dried beef (the glass jar makes an excellent juice glass :) but deli meat is cheaper. For a extra kick add a dash of Worcestershire sauce

I like this recipe because it uses a milk gravy base for its body.  I fry chopped up dried beef in 1/4 cup of butter till slightly browned. I omit the flour and use two heaping tablespoons of corn starch disolved into the milk. I omit salt all together beause Dried beef is generally salty enough. You will never get lumps using cornstarch.
When its thick and bubbly, I pour it over homefries or toast. And, splash on some Tabasco!

Recipe is just fine the way it is.  I did however add something.  My family always liked this for breakfast so we added chopped boiled eggs and served it over hash browns.  For dinner we prefer the creamed beef over mashed potatoes or rice with a green veggie on the side. For dinner I also add a bit of hot sauce to the beef.  Use the creamed beef as is but over a waffle or English Muffin and top with a fried or poached egg.

I minced a small amount of onion, melted butter in pan, & cooked the onion a little to soften. I then put rest of ingredients in, and also added a little garlic powder, but did leave out the salt. It can always be added later to taste. Very good comfort food!

My husband was adamant that I've had this for breakfast before and insisted that I've had this in the Army. When I told him that I can't recall having it, he insisted that I try it. I made it for breakfast today and it is very tasty, easy to make, and fast to prepare. Reminds me of bisuits with country gravy. Thanks Rebecca June "Cleaver" Paxton for a recipe that I can make over and over again.

Perfect Creamed Dried Beef.  To make it 5 stars, I use real dried beef from the grocer's deli.  Not every grocery carries it and it's about $11 a pound (and you don't need that much), but really, it makes the dish.  I'm in NE and found real dried beef at Super Saver and Baker's supermarkets.  Also, try your local meat locker, they should have it too.

My "Recipe" (I don't measure often, I cook by tase and sight mostly)is pretty similar. I also use a small onion diced and some garlic. I DO prefer it with a package or two of Dried Beef, an lot of lunch meat style roast beef has very strong flavors, and the dried beef taste is unique.

My mom used to make this recipe all the time when I was a kid - it was always a favorite. I think she learned it in the army years ago, or overseas, I can't remember. I'm so glad you posted it - you make it just like she does using the Carl Budding packets! I always put mine on Texas toast - yummy! Thanks for sharing, I'm so glad I could rediscover an old favorite!

We add frozen peas after the white sauce begins to thicken. Cook until the peas are lightly done. Adds a great dimension to the dish, especially if it's too salty. We use Hormel dried beef, which needs to be rinsed twice in water.

Chipped beef on Toast was a required Breafast on every visit to my grandparent when we were growing up.  This recipe is almost identical to hers expcet in place of the salt, she used 1/2 tsp chicken bullion.  It adds a liitle more flavor to the white sauce.

I made this a few days ago and didn't serve it to bf until this morning (I've never been a fan of this stuff).  He insisted that his toast be ripped into bite size pieces before it being put on top.  He ate every bite, so I count it a success.  I used the Buddig lunch meat as well, and only used one package so cut it down to 2 servings.  Thanks for the recipe!

One of the best comfort foods EVER. I add just a little Frank's Hot Sauce to mine. I also use Buddig Beef, as Kangal Gal does. The whole skillet disappears whenever I make this.

I had tried another chipped beef recipe on this site, but this one was far better. Creamier. I added a bit of smoked paprika, a dash of garlic powder and a dab of Dijon mustard. The Worcestershire is a good idea, too! Served it over waffles for dinner. Wonderful!

My mom made this quite often for my stepdad and brother when I was a kid-I hated it and my mom would have to make me a scrambled egg! My stepdad called it S--- on a Shingle.  Maybe I'll give it a try now that I am older-I know my hubby will eat it at least!

This is a good start for a good breakfast gravy.  The changes I made were to cook the Carl Budding beef in a couple tablespoons of butter and then remove the beef from the skillet.  Pour a quart of fat free half-and-half into the skillet and heat it up.  Mix a couple tablespoons of cornstarch with water to thicken the half-and-half -- omit the flour (avoid that flour after taste to the gravy and lumps). Add a couple more tablespoons of butter to the gravy, along with cooked beef and the salt and pepper.  Serve over homemade biscuits for a good old fashioned breakfast.  Every mouthful brings back memories of days gone by.

I made this for dinner tonight and it received rave reviews from the family! It tasted just like what my grandmother used to make when I was a kid. I used more of the beef in my recipe and it was just great on thick-cut Texas Toast.

I thought it was a little bland, so I added a dash or two of worcestershire sauce and a splash of white wine to round out the flavors and I didn't use much salt because the meat is already salty. We also tried it with smoked turkey instead of chipped beef but the flavor dried up even more.

For years I made chipped beef over toast using the Armor's chipped beef in a jar, but, lately it is about $6 a jar so stopped.
 Never even dawned on me to use Buddigs sliced beef. until I saw this recipe.  
  We have now gone back to having chipped beef on toast again, my husband was really surprised when I made it yesterday morning.

Way Excellant. My Boyfriend actually said it was thicker than his mom's and that used to be his favorite meal. I did cut back on the milk about a half of cup. Reheating was easy in the microwave at a lower power level and just added a bit of butter and keep stopping and stiring it to make sure it stay creamy and heated thru out. Bravo to You!

Whoa!  Way to salty!!  I had to double the milk, add more flour to thicken and my husband dumped so much pepper on it to counteract the salt, I worry about his tummy.  Love the concept and other suggestions, re: sausage and ground beef.  Suggestion: Boil the beef and rinse well if using jarred beef, and only use 1 jar (my jar was 4.5 oz and I used 2) for the amount of milk recommended in this recipe.

As it was, no one in my family would eat it.  I added soy sauce, garlic salt and extra black pepper.  Then 4/5 of us liked it.

I just made this, totally impressed!! Using Carl Budding is genius: it's shaved really thin, not too strongly flavored, and  extremely cost effective. I did melt the butter first,  lightly cook some chopped onion, then slowly add the milk. Eliminated the salt and threw in a couple twists of cracked pepper. Before this the only way I knew to find creamed chipped beef was in the frozen food aisle from Stauffer's, this was  WAY better

I substituted sausage for the dried beef, and it came out great! All the kids finished their plates, which is a rarity.

I made this when I couldn't find the packaged chipped beef in the store (I'm not gonna lie, I didn't look that hard because I prefer making things from scratch!). This was super easy to make. I cut the recipe down to two servings and it came out great. I used the Carl Buddig Beef and added extra. My boyfriend said he liked this recipe even better than packaged chipped beef! Score!

I made this for brunch this a.m. and Hubby & I loved it!  I did tweak it a bit, however (I can't help myself): I added pinches of smoked paprika & cayenne, and a dash of Worcestershire, along with some sautéed shallots & mushrooms.  We were out of bread so I served it over crispy hash browns.  YUM.

This is my favorite creamed chip beef recipe. I do add about 6-8 slices of American cheese. It makes it creamier and takes away the flour taste that I hate when I eat this in a restaurant. My whole family loves this!

So I don't usually post but I've gotta say love the ease of this recipe, everyone in my house loves it... 
with the creamed chipped beef I add a little worcestershire sauce.. I also use this for my sausage biscuit breakfast but use of course ground sausage first fried and crumbled up and use fresh ground pepper to give it more of that sausage gravy taste and again love this recipe.

After reading the reviews, I thought I had been making chipped beef incorrectly.  After tasting this recipe I will stick to making a roux.  I just didn't like the taste.  No matter how long I cooked it all I could taste was flour.  But to each their own.  I'll stick with my Grandmothers recipe.

I made it for my husband because he has never experienced SOS. I tasted it and it's exactly like mom used to make. I do not like Chipped Beef on Toast, but that's how it is supposed to taste. Husband thought it was weird, but he was probably influenced by me. 

Good job - It's straight outta the 50s!

DO NOT MAKE THIS WITHOUT CHANGING IT! 
That is waaaay too much flour! I made it just to see and give it a chance and it tasted completely of flour. Yes the gravy thickened up but that was the only part that was good about this gravy. My suggestion: cook the beef and butter (2tbsp) together in a skillet (with salt and pepper to taste) until the butter melts. Add 1tbsp flour and stir until smooth and bubbly. Add one cup of milk and boil WHILE CONSTANTLY STIRRING until it thickens up. If you want more gravy add another Tbsp butter, another tbspof flour, and another cup of milk. Cook it until it’s as thick as you want. Also I only ended up using 8oz of the packaged buddig beef meat.

My grandmother has made this for me since I was very young! This recipe turns out to have a great consistency, but it does make a LOT! My fiance and I always cut it in half from now on, and we still have leftovers. 

A tip - my family and I add MSG or other types of seasoned salt, and 1 slice of white American cheese (2 slices for the full recipe). It adds a lot more flavor!

II only make this once in a Blue Moon which what it was this week. I used a premix gravy that was salty, and Armor Dried Beef. I should have boiled the beef and made my own gravy because it was super salty. As I recall the last time it was super salty, not good for a guy with hypertension. I hope I remember this lesson next time I make it.

This is exactly how my dad made it, and exactly how I make it.  The only difference is we serve it on either a baked potato or mashed potatoes.  We’ve never been a fan of it being served on toast. It’s my daughters favorite food I make and I fix it for her every year on her birthday.  It’s definitely a fall/winter comfort food.   I make it in a reverse order - butter, add meat and brown a little bit, add flour to make a roux then slowly add the milk, then salt & pepper to taste.

Loved this recipe as a kid and am still making it today. My mother always used the Carl Budding Corned Beef and, to me, that is the best choice.

Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe for my DH and I. Have made it many times. He just likes a little more of a "zing" so I add a little McKormick minced onion and minced garlic, and I increase the pepper to 1/2 tsp. He loves it! (Great on potatoes too)

Fantastic, Quick and Easy. I used leftover Roast Beef and cut the recipe in Half to serve three! It's all gone.

I wish I would've read some of the reviews, before making. I used dried beef and kept the salt in the recipe, which made it ultra salty, but it was still delicious! Next time, I'll just take the salt out of the recipe, like the reviews recommend, when I use dried beef, instead of the lunch meat. I have been craving this for quite some time and I enjoyed this recipe!

It needed a lot more pepper for my taste but it's extremely easy to make and tastes good :)

LOVE this stuff! I add a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce but that's the only thing I do differently in this recipe. The only thing that makes it better is frying a sunny side up egg that goes on top! Mmmmmmm

My husband was really looking forward to this meal but it did not live up to his memory of having chipped beef when he was younger.  It was definitely okay but not memorable.  Not sure if chipped beef can really be memorable anyway!  :)

Excellent easy recipe to follow. I did however change it up. I didn't use any salt since the dried beef has plenty. I also bought the beef fresh from the deli. I mixed the milk mix and also pan fried the beef before adding it in. Came up tasty over a toasted english muffin. I don't think I'll ever buy the bagged beef.

This is very similar to what I have done for many years. But I melt the butter and saute the jar dry beef (sliced), and also saute chopped onion.  Sometimes for variations, I have added such items as diced green chilies to the cream gravy. It is a wonderful quick and tasty meal.  I generally have it for a quick dinner and serve over biscuits. My mother made this frequently when I was growing up and served on toast; therefore I highly recommend trying it!

Turned out just like my mom made. One adjustment, though. I got mine a little thicker by only using 4 cups of milk, and it turned out fine.

This recipe made perfect creamed beef on toast.  It brought me back to my childhood when my dad made this for us all the time.  My 6-year-old son, who is a very picky eater, ate it up and loved it.  I did add a tiny dash of cayenne pepper and just a little spoonful of Dijon mustard.

This was a great base recipe and have used it many times. The last time I added a small onion, which I sautéed in the the butter with the beef. I also added Worcester sauce and Dijon mustard to the milk and flour mixture. These were suggestions I found in other reviews. Really good!

it was pretty good. I'm 13 and have just started cooking and this was great. I substituted the lunch meat for ground beef and added some extra salt and pepper. It had a slightly plain flavor but with added salt it was good. I made three ingredient carrot slaw as a side dish and it was delicious. Overall It was pretty good

Very good recipe and will surely use it again,maybe add some red pepper flakes or onion like others. This gravey would be excellent with sausage in it also. Thanks for the recipe.
