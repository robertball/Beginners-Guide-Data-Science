Excellent bread made in my bread machine. I used bread flour rather than all purpose flour. It is simple to make and was quickly eaten up by my family. I will make it often.  Cobbler63

This is the BEST banana bread I've ever tasted. I can't keep it made fast enough for my family.

This bread smelled wonderful baking. What a dissapointment. Very bland tasting, not at all what I expected.

This makes good bread, but it's not the cake like banana bread most are used to and I can see why the 1 user called it bland. It really is more banana flavored white bread than "banana bread".  Next time I make it I intend to try with 3 bananas to see if that makes it better. I hesitate to add more sugar because I don't know if that would feed the yeast too much, but it could certainly be sweeter.

I thought this bread was great.  It has a mild banana flavor, but that was okay, because my son hates bananas, and I've been looking for ways to get him to eat them.  If you're looking for lots of banana taste, you would have to play around with the recipe or go back to quick bread.  I might use more cinnamon, more raisins, and a tsp of vanilla next time, but that's all preference.  Also, I used half whole wheat flour.  Thanks Oz for this great recipe!

This makes a nice loaf of bread,smells good while baking, and makes nice toast. It is not, however, the dense, moist banana bread one might expect or was hoping for. 

I baked to recipe and the bread is good and tasty, although next time I intend to change it up and see what it would be like with:

* 3 bananas
* Half the yeast (1 1/2 tsp)
* Double the cinnamon (2 tsp)
* 3 Tbl Sugar

Hopefully this will increase the density and sweetness of the loaf.

Making this bread again and again it has fallen and flat on top? Not that it matters cause it is soooooo good ! I alway make substitutions to the flour but measurements stay the same...just add flavorings like coconut oil-tsp., vanilla-tsp., .......wheat germ, flax, almond meal, coconut meal, whole wheat is added to one of the cups of flour to make it more healthy.                                                I have diverticulitis so everything with seeds, nuts, hard to digest foods have to be processed in my Nutri-bullet.  Still, I add twice the raisens, but eat in moderation! Absolutely delicious and plenty of flavor. My go-to recipe for company. Thanks OZ!

Not a bad bread, but it was bland and not very bananay.  I skipped the raisins, but know that was not the problem.  The bread is very moist thanks to the bananas though

Tried this out with some variation, added vanilla 1tsp, omitted nuts and raisins, and used 4 bananas instead of 2, and extra cinnamon. Turned out fantastic! Great toasted with honey. Less Cake-y more bread-like. Thank you OZ!

This is a lovely yeast bread.  It's wonderful as breakfast toast.  I like to substitute 1 of the cups of all purpose flour with 1 cup of whole wheat flour.

I tried the recipe in my bread maker but it didn't come out right.  The flavor was superb, but the cake didn't rise appropriately and was also not very firm. I'm sure with a little tweaking it would be great but not for my machine.

Recipe was excellent, family loved it. I made a few changes though. We are trying to eat healthier, so I ground white wheat berries into flour making 2 1/4 cups of wheat berry flour, then added the balance with all purpose flour. Also deleted the nuts and raisins because of my daughters braces, (boring). When mixing the recipe, the dough was very wet and soggy. I added about 2 tablespoons of flour to bring it to the right consistency. Marvelous flavor, love the banana and yeast flavor.

Our cousin just gave me a breadmaker she wasn't using and this was the 2nd recipe I tried. It was a hit and I will definitely be making this again.  I read other reviews and since I already had bananas that had been cut in half and frozen I used the equivalent of 2 1/2 bananas, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and left out the nuts and raisins to suit my husband's tastes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved this bread.  It has a great banana flavor, and has a great texture.  I saw some people rating it low, saying it wasn't as good as their other banana bread recipes, but you have to remember that this isn't a quick bread. It's a yeast bread, so it should be expected to come out  like a yeast bread.  

We ate it fresh out of the bread machine with steak salad, and  it was perfect.  The leftovers will make great french toast, or simply toast with peanut butter -- or even ham sandwiches.

I don't like raisins or walnuts, so omitted both. I made it after reading the reviews, so knew what to expect and was very pleased. Light, fluffy bread with a banana flavour. Great for breakfast and peanut butter sandwiches.

It's nice and fluffy bread with just a hint of banana sweetness. But definitely not the cake like banana bread that our sweet tooth craves.... So if you want cake use your old fashioned banana bread recipe for the oven
