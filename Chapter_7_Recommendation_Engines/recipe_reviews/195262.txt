I added Mozzerella cheese to the middle of my meatballs and I have to say this was one very delicious recipe! Left overs tasted just as good. Yum!

This is a quick and easy way to take Spaghetti up a notch (from a jar of sauce over noodles). The meatballs could use some doctoring, though. My hubby thinks garlic and salt should do it.

I made these per request of my husband. I've never had meatballs much and this was my first time to make them. We were very pleased! They saved well and we kept eating them throughout the week.

This is exactly how I made my spaghetti when I first moved out on my own, only adding a couple tbsp. of italian seasoning to the spaghetti sauce. I also baked my meatballs for 20-30 minutes, drained, then added them in my sauce. A good basic recipe for any beginning cook.

The meatballs will be SO bland--find a better recipe.  This looked so easy, and This was my first atempt at meatballs, and I have found you HAVE to add more to them or they are tasteless.

Just for the heck of it, I tried this.  The meatballs were both dry and bland considering seasoned breadcrumbs have parsley and very little else.

This was a great recipe to follow. However I hadded a lot of zip to mine with chile flakes and hot sauce. I also cooked teh meatballs out of the sauce so I could drain the little bit of fat that did come off them. Adding vegetables made the sauce a lot thicker and heartier.

They were pretty good, but tasted like they were missing something.  I will have to experiment with tweaking the recipe.

A good basic recipe, tho' I did put some changes in. I cooked the meatballs in the skillet first to get some color then cut up zucchini in the sauce. Also added some Ro-tel tomatoes. Made a good supper.

These make wonderful meatballs when you season them well.  I added dried chopped onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the meat mixture.  It was delicious and very easy.

Meatballs weren't done after 20 minutes. More like 30 or more. Very bland.
