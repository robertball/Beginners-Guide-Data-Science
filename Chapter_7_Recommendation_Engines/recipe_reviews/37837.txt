Funky! My boyfriend didn't care for it but I thought it was something nice to have...every once in a while.  I did add a slice of cheese to melt and if I made again, I think I'll use crossiants or english muffins instead of bagels...easier to "load" and eat.

I did not like the lettuce and tomato with the egg.

I made these after throwing away a pancake recipe I tried on this site that didn't work out.  These are super!  I also added a slice of lowfat cheese, omitted the green pepper and used precooked bacon.  Will make again and again for a good quick breakfast or brunch.
