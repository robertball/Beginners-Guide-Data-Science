I made the recipe as written.  Some problems were that the recipe doesn’t say how big of a casserole dish to use.  By the time the chicken and potatoes were added and sauce was made I realized that a bigger casserole (13x9) at least is needed.  Also, there is a lot of salt in this recipe some needed some not.  Definitely use low salt Soup.  The chicken was really tender.  I’ll make this again.

This was a good recipe.  For all the fresh ingredients in this dish, I was disappointed at how overwhelming and dominant the canned soup taste was.  My husband would give it 5 stars.  I give it 4 for taste.  Unfortunately I will NOT make this recipe again as it is just very labor intensive.  Lots of ingredients being cooked on the stove first, then transferrend to the baking dish while it awaits the next layer of ingredients to cook on the stove, and then again.   Make sure you have enough time to prep!

This recipe was a lot of work for the subtle flavor it had. I will not be making it again.

Made this recipe for my husband. It was excellent. It didn't specify what size of pan to use, I used a 9x13 size Pyrex and it worked well. I used double of the mushrooms, came out great. I also used cream of mushroom instead. Great recipe and really good flavor, this is definitely a keeper for future dinners. I think this would be a great dinner if you were having guest over a nice dinner.

I love casseroles and this one did not disappoint. Yes, a lot of prep work, but well worth it. Overall taste was soooo good. Flavor was perfect.

I used broccoli instead of spinach and a combo of sherry and Marsala to get a deeper flavor. It is a lovely recipe, but takes a lot of prep and time for each step, this is not a quickie meal.

Loved it! My husband said I should definitely make it again, which he rarely says. I used precooked chicken and baked the potatoes for 40 minutes. I put the seasonings in with the sauce. Sauce was a little too thick so I added a little water. Baked chicken and cheese on top for 15 minutes- perfect!

Flavor was good but very labor intensive! Gave it a 5 for taste but a 2 for time! Definitely not the 30 minutes prep time as stated! By the time you measure, chop, cut etc. there are several more steps to cooking. Too much work unless you have a Sunday afternoon!

I made this dish with some slight variations and it was awesome! I used meat from a rotisserie chicken, substituted a sweet potato an since I'm not a big fan of mushrooms used a can of cream of mushroom soup. My wine of choice was a white wine.

Was easy to make. I would only change the amount of oil recommended for browning the chicken and potatoes, as I had to use more for every batch.  I was going to replace the green onions with shallots but forgot to buy them,lol . The recipe came out great!  Delicious. Will make again!

I made this for my family & the person in my youngest daughter can  be quite picky about food.  She tasted it & enjoyed every bit of it.  I love that it is so filling.  Will be making this again.

I really liked this recipe.  I made it according to the recipe, except for the Parm and the sherry.  I subbed more broth for the wine.  I would have given this 5 stars except for t he mozzarella cheese dissolved into the dish and it tasted a little to rich when I got a spoon of cheese.  Otherwise it was great

It was ok a complete meal in one dish but was not happy with how thin the sauce was. Next time might try adding a bit of flour to the sauce to thicken it.

No, no changes. It turned out nice, but not spectactular. I thought this recipe would be a cut above all others, but I was disappointed. In any case I may make it again?

We loved it! I had to sub big chunks of carrot for the potato (mine had gone bad), red wine for the sherry, and cheddar for mozzarella. I just love the dredging spices. Such great flavour!
