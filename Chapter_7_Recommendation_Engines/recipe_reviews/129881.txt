It seems that Strawberry Cool Whip is no longer available. Looked for it in two stores before looking at Kraft's web site. Used Cool Whip Lite, brought it to a Father's Day gathering and it got rave reviews. Being a cheesecake purist, I wasn't sure about the lemon pudding - but it made for a nice summer flavor, not too overpowering.

I made this a few years ago and lost the recipe. Thank God I found it on here! Its delicious!! Out of this world!!!! The only thing, and it's probbably just me, (I'm not great sometimes at following directions and Im not a veteran in the kitchen, lol) but, it says to line the baking dish with foil and then remove the cake with foil handles. Well, you see the picture with the cake so pretty, I find it hard to get the foil off the cake and have it look so good. But no matter really. it's so good. I usually just leave it in the baking dish and everyone just inhales it! yummy!  oh, and i find you need to use more butter.

WOW!  This was the best cheesecake EVER!  I used a graham cracker crust instead of vanilla wafers because graham crackers were on sale and vanilla wafers were not.  The store didn't have kiwi, so I used fresh, ripe peaches along with the blueberries and strawberries.  I served it out of the pan, so I don't know how well it would have slipped out.  The absolute best ever cheesecake!!

I've made this twice- once for Easter and once for a baby shower. I love this recipe. It's a crowd pleaser and it's super easy. I tried the Nilla Wafer crust and it was fine, but I prefer graham cracker crust. I also melted down some white chocolate chips and drizzled them on top for the baby shower and it was I nice touch. It looked pretty and tasted great. I had no problem getting the cake out of the aluminum-lined pan as one reviewer mentioned. I didn't try to get the aluminum off, but the cake came out of the pan quite easily. I used sugar-free, fat-free lemon pudding just because the store was sold out of regular, and it was great. I'm always going to make it that way.

I made this for my husbands birthday , per his request...I am not a cheescake fan, BUT, this was amazing ! The whole family thought this was the "best" I like things natural so I made my own fresh whipped cream and used a graham cracker base , again, per my husbands request :0) The fresh fruit was a great addition and my  7 year old daughter even helped decorate ! :) I will make again !

I made this and brought it to our family Easter celebration.  53 people attended as our family is huge.  There was a complete table full of dessers to choose from and this was GONE within 15 minutes after setting it out after dinner.  I had rave reviews and no one could belive I had made it (I don't cook often and when I do....well it isnt always anything to brag about).  This was delicious and fairly easy to make as well.  However as a note I did not attempt to remove the cheesecake I just made it in a disposable cake pan which makes it very easy to transport and easy to clean up.  Yum! :-)

This is a delicious summertime dessert! I made this for the adult dessert at my son's 1st birthday party almnost 3 years ago. I still get request to make it and for the recipe. I try to make it at least once each summer for a party, BBQ or church potluck.

Very Yummy I did skip the foil step and just put into pan and it came out very easy piece by piece.
