I made this last night for a pre trick or treat party at our house for a group of my kids friends.  The taste of the punch was good and very easy to throw together although the hand did not work out for me so I'm only rating this 4 stars.  I followed the directions as written and ended up with enough raspberry mixture to fill 2 gloves.  I froze them for 2 full days and while I was removing the glove a finger on each hand broke off.  The kids thought it was still cool to have the chopped off finger floating in the punch bowl with the hand missing a finger.  Very Halloween!  I think next time I will just freeze water and make an ice hand.  I hope they edit the recipe to indicate "latex free" glove.  I used vinyl because you just never know who could have an allergy.

When I was a child my grandmother would make "punch." 

She would then make an ice cube hand like the one above. 

Her's was made wit dry ice however. So when the hand was placed in the punch it would fog. Not only does it keep it cold and look neat; but it has a spooky fog too.

She also put red food coloring on it as blood some times too

Really cute idea.  Using jello for the hand was an ingenious idea.  It made this punch look and taste great.  Thanks again.

I bought the most inexpensive gloves I could find.  I didn't realize how short they would be so instead of one giant arm I had two hands.  I served this at my MOMS Club Halloween Party and everyone thought it was very festive.

Great recipe. Personally, I think the advice about using vinyl in stead of latex gloves is overrated. I have a very severe nut allergy (more common than latex allergy) and I have never seen the same advise when a recipe contains nuts.

This was good.  I had problems with the hand because the fingers fell off while I was cutting the glove off, but my hand only had about 24 hours to freeze.  It was still really cool though because it still looked neat.  Kept the punch cool AND it did not lose its form because the jello held it together.  Thank you for sharing this idea. Notes for others to consider: pay attention to how long the gloves are if you want there to be an arm this recipe made two gloves for me, both did not have long arms. Try to separate the fingers when freezing as it is this that makes the fingers come off when taking off the glove

My hand came out pretty good, but  I broke a finger..his, not mine...be careful when removing the finger portion of the glove. A few seconds in warm water helped it all slip off better instead of cutting.  I'll wear my own gloves next time too because that sucker was cold to handle!  The punch is ubber-simple and very good.  The hand did a great job of keeping it all cold without any additional ice and yet still kept its form because of the gelatin.  Just be sure to refrigerate the cider and ginger-ale the day before to give it a head start!  I actually was not able to find any sparkling apple cider so I just used a gallon of plain old apple cider with one 2 liter bottle of ginger-ale.  There was still plenty of carbonation from the ginger-ale--especially since it went in cold so there was very little release on pouring.

I made this punch at our halloween party and it turned out great. The stars are mainly for the hand, because the hand turned out fantastic! In lieu of ginger ale, i used green stawberry & kiwi flavored punch so there was a color contrast, plus my kids aren't crazy about ginger ale. As the fingers started to melt, the hand looked more like a heart and the melted fingers looked like blood. The other change I made was using a package of black cherry gelatin in lieu of unflavored. It really made the punch taste great and gave the hand the deep red color! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last year for a Halloween party, it was the perfect touch for the punch bowl!  I am getting ready to make it again this year! I only used the recipe for the floating hand so I can't say much for the punch. I used strawberries and lemonade for the hand since it went with the drink I was making...turned out great!!

TOTALLY AWESOME! And we threw in a hunk of dry ice, really made it bubble and brew. Only problem with that was that the gummies stuck to the dry ice on the bottom and turned into ice cubes. But not really a big deal. I made it with Hansen's high fructose corn syrup free ginger ale and langer's hfcs free apple cider so even better. The ratios weren't quite 2 liters and 2 liters (more like 64 oz and 72 oz) but it turned out real tasty. Was a real hit at the halloween party. Highly recommend-- even extracting the hand from the glove became a bit of party entertainment.

I did the hands 3 days early and they came out great but did end up sinking to the bottom of the punch bowl.  Used a clear bowl but it was still hard to see the two hands I was so proud didn't break!   They lasted through a four hour party and the drink was better than I thought it would be...especially as the cranberry flavor mixed in.

Punch is great... ADVICE YOU MUST TAKE:  Get a good set of gloves.  I bought a dollar 10-pack of cheap-o's and the hands were horrible.  Kinda like the thin purple ones your doctor uses.  All fat & blulgy at the hand then the fingers all broke off.  Nothing like the photo.  That photo is perfect!  I like this recipe so next year I am going to buy a really nice latex-free set of gloves (expensive ones) and I am going to do this again.  I love this recipe and I want mine to look like this one next year.  Thanks!

We used flavored Jell-o and different juice but it gave flavor to our hunch punch.  As the night goes on the Jell-o will slowly start to break up and make it slightly chunky in the punch.. kinda gross.

This is a good recipe but it is better if you use Hawaiian Punch ginger ale, rainbow sherbet ice cream. Then add Malibu for an adult drink. It is delicious and I make it for all my Halloween Parties.

The taste was excellent on this punch and the hand was highly entertaining for everyone...until it melted.  Once it started to break up, leaving gelatin globs in the punch, no one would go near it again.  As cute as it was, I'll have to stick to the plain ice hands.

Made punch green with ginger ale, sparkling cider and limon Jarritos. Added lychee nuts for eyeballs. For hand, used 1/2 large package of red jello, 1 unflavored gelatin packet, and raspberries. Froze for 2 days. Worked great. Took 5-10 minutes to cut off the glove, so don't do this at the last minute. Cut the glove off and return to freezer until ready to assemble the punch. Popular!

The hands last a long time... well into the morning. They were creepy to make, look at and when they grazed your lips. Super fun and I would definitely make again. I would omit the gummy worms though.

Worked really well. I followed the recipe and the hand worked perfectly and the punch was delicious. I did have to figure a way to hang the hands in the freezer because if i layed them down they would leak.

Rating for the creative use of the frozen hand.  Didn't follow the recipe for the actual punch.  Hand didn't really melt in the punch as anticipated, so never got the eat the raspberries or taste much cranberry.  Next time I'll leave out the gelatin.

do NOT fill hands too much.  lay them flat w/ all fingers spread.  it will be very hard to take the glove off if the fingers are sticking!  not as easy as they make it sound but had a great effect.  i made 8 gloves and only 1 survived w/ all 5 fingers after I took the gloves off!

I did this at a Halloween Party years ago and it was a big hit!!!!  I didn't color the hand though, great idea!!!  A few younger kids were actually very scared of the hand and wouldn't go near it.  BOO!

I can only review the hand portion since I didn't use the punch recipe.  The hand came out great though.  Used the recipie as written.  It froze fine, I sliced the glove up the side and then each finger as it was coming off.   We served it in a red wine sangria, very spooky!  Even as it started to thaw the gelatin kept the hand together, and actually made it kind of move funky when people dipped in for more punch. It was a huge hit at the Halloween party.

This is quite cool for a kids' party.  Instead of gummi snakes, I floated gummi eyeballs.  It was wonderful!

Ok, I loved this idea, not the recipe, that's why I only gave it 4 stars. I changed it considerably to get it to work. The recipe, as is, produces a popsicle-like consistency for the hand. It didn't hold up, and when I tried to remove the hand from the rubber glove the fingers broke off. I rigged up a method to get the fingers to stay put for "display" by using toothpicks to stick the fingers back in place.
Here's what will make this work way better: 1) use colored water with the same amounts given. The water will freeze completely and hold up. 2)I would suggest making it 3-4 days in advance to give it plenty of time to freeze, 3) Allow 10-15 minutes time to remove the hand from the glove. It takes awhile and a steady hand, 4) Lastly, and MOST important - use a LARGE rubber glove. I used a medium one that fits my hand, but it looks wimpy. A large one would produce a better effect. 
Next Halloween, I'll make it with the revisions that I've indicated above for a more satisfactory result.

Way too sweet for punch.  Hand was neat, but watch the type of glove you use as ours stuck to the frozen inside and was a huge pain to separate.

This was a really great idea. The only thing I would do is to do a hand out of water and put alot of green food dye so it could really pass as a witch's hand! Very Cool, I tried black food dye but if you are using a black punch bucket it doesn't stand out at all, Try using a glow in the dark pumpkin candy basket for the black hand or the typical Orange one.

Hand turned out awesome! A few fingers fell off but it looked great! The actual punch tasted great too. I also added some leftover cranberry juice in mine. I had some plastic halloween ice cubes like bats and ghosts that I threw in too! Super cool!Thanks!

This was so fun to make and drink! I didn't let the hand freeze long enough, so a couple fingers fell off into the "brew". That was okay though as it added to the grotesque ooey gooeyness of the recipe. The kids LOVED it! They drank every last drop and then played with the gooey jello hand.

I cheated and just bought generic cherry jello.  It worked just as well as the gelatin and fruit in this recipe, but was very inexpensive and easy!  I made the jello according to package directons, put it in the glove and froze it.

Totally fun and easy recipe! I modified by blending raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries together with cran-raspberry juice before putting in saucepan and I used raspberry jello instead of unflavored. The hands, once frozen, taste like super fresh berry popsicles and the effect was very creepy. I also only used raspberry ginger ale as the "punch" but as the hands melted, the punch became more and more dark red and flavorful. Will definitely use this recipe again!

it was a pretty good punch! I took it to a Halloween party and everyone loved it. I think the best part was that the hand falls apart after a while of sitting in the punch, which adds to the gross out factor. Will def. make again!

Had a real hard time getting the hands out of the gloves.  All the fingers broke.  I think I may have had to much fruit in them.  The punch in itself was good until the gooey hand started melting into it.

Made this with my children for a Halloween party - it was a HUGE hit!! Do be sure to allow more then overnight for the hand to freeze, and you do want to make the hand with the gelatin because if not, it will melt way too fast!

Makes quite a bit for the hand.  Buy a large size glove to use all the liquid for a large upright hand, or fill a small or medium pair to have floating hands.
Halving the recipe makes one good sized floating hand.

Kids loved it!  Fingers a little fragile and broke some off.  I threw them in the punch and kids thought severed fingers were creepy.  Punch was "potion" of half ginger ale and half apple juice.

AMAZING! HUGE hit at the Halloween party and a "Mad Scientist" party. Added dry ice and severed plastic fingers which kids loved. We turned a smaller bowl upside down inside the punch bowl to keep the hand standing up. Parents and kids loved the punch taste. Used pressed apple cider b/c much less expensive than sparkling. Buy a large size glove so your hand will be big. The fingers fell off while trying to cut the glove off. Will use a razor blade next time and buy a thinner glove. We called it "bloody brain punch" b/c the raspberries made it look more like a brain after the fingers broke off. Will add water in the glove to make it icier next time to help fingers. I had to refill the punch 10 times at the school b/c every student wanted a cup!

They were so neat.  I made them 4 days in advance for our Halloween party.  Only trouble I had was trying not to break the fingers while removing from the glove.  Very tricky.  Otherwise, they were great in my punch!

Made this hand for my halloween party and it turned out great, I did freeze it for 2 whole days and had no problems with fingers falling off. I made my own punch to go with it. But loved loved loved the hand, thanks for the recipe!!

Great idea, but I'll probably never make this again.  Sorry!  All the fingers snapped off, except for the thumb :( The kids thought it was still cool, but then decided it looked pretty gross once it started melting.

This review is just for the hand.  I made Green Punch (another recipe on allrecipes) and added the hand.    It was super easy and fun to make. A big hit at the party.

My family and I made this for Halloween last night and the kids thought it was so cool. The hand came out perfect. There was about a cup of juice mix left so next time I might cut down on that but overall it's a great, fun recipe! Thanks!

So fun! I should have made 2 of them, or even 3, but I wasn't expecting the hand to melt so fast. The punch itself tasted like plain apple juice.

I used this recipe just for the hand.  It was rather messy and filled 2 hands; and took more than a couple days to freeze solid enought to remove the glove.  I wasn't able to get it to stick out of the punch without weighing it down so I just let it float.  It still turned out impressively for my daughter's party. Next time I think I'll just freeze red jello or juice, it'll be cheaper and I think it will give the same effect.  Thanks for the great idea anyway!

I did use a differant punch but I used the hand and let it float around in the punch. It was very cool and everyone loved it. when I cut the glove off almost all of the fingers broke off. That could have been because it was only in my freezer for 3 or 4 days before the party and it said to give it a week. next time I will try it that way. by the end of the night the hand was falling apart but since it is made with the gelitine it doesnt really melt and with the rassberry seeds it kind of made it look like muscle fallin off of a bone. very gross but VERY cool looking at the same time everyone thought it was great!

The concept was right on the money, but I botched it up... not the fault of the recipe. Here's some tips: 1: Use a razor blade to remove the glove. Just before I broke off pinky and thumb, my husband suggested it. huge difference and I saved all 5 fingers!! 2: my hand wouldn't stay upright. I'm guessing I should have anchored it, or had a more shallow/more narrow bucket. 3: I used a orange dream punch (delicious- search for it). I should have used clear punch to get better effect.  4: I didn't have cranberries, so I mushed up canned pears- worked perfectly. I'll redo this again next year for sure!! :)

I only used the recipe for the hand. It was so neat! The gelatin made it float for a long time too. Next time though I might try the same idea without the gelatin only because when it DOES start to thaw and fall apart it sort of made the punch look gross and no one wanted to drink the "chunkies".

I used cherry jello sinceI didn't have plain gelatin in the house.  It made the punch a deeper red.  The hand had 2 fingers break off but that made it more scary.  In fact, it was so scary for the kids they wouldn't drink it initially.  It was very good and eventually they got over the scariness.

I made this for my Gravity Falls themed Halloween party. It turned out perfect and I had enough of the berry mixture for two hands.  Maybe I had a smaller glove.  The punch was delicious and everyone liked it.  Will make again!

This is great. 
The glove trick worked great, you really need to be careful while getting the hand out of the glove, but i didn't use the punch that was in this recipe.
I took the Jelly, water and red food coloring to make the had, this made a very stiff had in the first place, and when it did get softer, it still stayed in one piece because of all the gelatin.

Added lichees with grapes in them to add floating eyeballs to the punch (slightly different recipe) to make an even spookier drink!! The eyeballs could also go in the glasses, decorating more than just the bowl.

It tasted really good and was a nice attention grabber however I unfortunately broke fingers off the hand...TWICE! I made an extra back up one in case the first one would brake but wasn't a good idea anyways.
