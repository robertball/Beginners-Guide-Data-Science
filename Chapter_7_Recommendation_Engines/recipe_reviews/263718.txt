Five stars for sure. This is an elegant way to serve tilapia. My wife thinks I am  the best. I changed nothing and really enjoyed the tang of the capers. I am going to prepare this tonight,  this will be my third time.

This is wonderful! I made it exactly as the recipe said, but next time, I will not use two different pans. I will remove the fish, then pour in the cream, and deglaze the pan. It made a prettier photo to use two pans, but did not add to the flavor. With that said, though, I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. I served the fish over jasmine rice and poured extra sauce over the rice.
