EXCELLENT!  Chef John has never let me down.  This recipe was so easy, I found myself giving it over the phone to a friend without even looking at the recipe.  I watched the video first which is always a plus.  I did make one change and that was to use vanilla bean paste in place of vanilla extract.  I like seeing the vanilla beans in the ice cream and the flavor was oh so good!!!  Thank you Chef John for sharing such an EXCELLENT recipe!  I will be making this many times over!

I give it five stars, though I make one really major change.  I don't have the patience to wait overnight!  You can use one can of sweetened condensed milk that's been chilled and you don't have to wait at all!  Put any flavor in it you want.  My personal favorite is lemon.

I think this is probably the BEST ice cream recipe ever! It's so easy to change the amounts of whipping cream and milk (I made it the 1st time as Chef John instructed). I liked more cream then milk and then I decided to add eggs to make it more creamy and rich. It was perfect! This is my new base recipe for making ice cream!

this one does not work for the good ol' fashioned ice cream maker. The wooden kind with the motor on top.  I've had this thing running for 2 hours now and it's just slush.

This was great. Easy recipe, no raw eggs. This was our first time ever making ice cream. We followed the directions exactly, including leaving the stuff to chill overnight. Some of the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had.

I can't wait to try it again with some other flavors.

This was absolutely the BEST ice cream I have ever made. (Chef John never lets me down.) I love the simple and few ingredients needed. It tasted just like the ice cream I remember eating as a child from the little ice cream stand in my hometown. Will have to make a double batch tomorrow, this didn't last long!

Wonderful recipe.  Its the only ice cream recipe I use.  It's simple and yummy.  Also, it's a great base recipe in that you can add whatever flavoring you want.  Today I made this and then divided the milk mixture into separate containers, then I flavored each container differently (root beer, peppermint and vanilla).

First homemade ice cream I loved! This recipe is clean and delicious with the perfect texture. I used whole milk and pure vanilla. I let it cool in fridge for 3 hours before adding it to my Kitchen Aid ice cream mixer bowl attachment. 20 minutes later, the most delicious ice cream I've ever had. I froze the remainder in a ziploc container and it remained scoopable after 24 hours. It wasn't a solid brick of ice as I've experienced in the past with home churned ice cream.

Lost everything in a fire including the vanilla ice cream recipe weâ€™ve made for over 35 years. Made this one last Saturday with  our Grandbabies and the first bite my husband said it tasted just like what his Grammie and PawPaw made. Made it exactly as is in a regular  rock salt ice cream maker ( no problem doubling for the big machine )  Made it again 5 days later and I topped mine with my homemade canned strawberry topping. 
Best vanilla ice cream recipe and this is the only one we will ever use from now on.  Thank you for bringing back a treasured memory  to my Hubby.

I think I write AWESOME about every one of Chef John's recipes!  If you like Bryers Natural Vanilla, you will LOVE this!  SO easy and delicious!  This was my first time time making ice cream.  I used 1% milk and just regular whipping cream (not heavy) as that was what I had on hand.  It was marvelous! I personally like the lighter texture that is created with less fat.   I made some yummy hot fudge to put on it and was soooo goooood!  Hub likes his ice cream creamier, so I'm going to try a batch with whole milk and heavy cream for him.  Thank you so much Chef John for another winner!

**Update**  I've made this with 1/2 C sugar and it's plenty sweet, so delicious!  I also use vanilla bean paste for added depth.  This ice cream is simple and absolutely delicious!!!

Delicious simplicity! I was skeptical of the sparse list of ingredients, but I shouldn't have been! This ice cream is incredible! Everyone agrees... better than any other homemade recipe we've tried, and way WAY better than store bought! Yum!!

i will most definitely make this several more times.
if you sift about four tablespoons of cocoa powder it makes delicious chocolate ice cream.

How are you people getting this to work! The milk and cream amount are backwards. I lost the recipe book from my ice cream maker and found this one. It looked similar so I thought I'd try it. IT DOESN'T WORK. Stored the milk overnight in the fridge with the ice cream maker drum in the freezer overnight. It's been mixing for 30 mins and is still just liquid. I found the original recipe book online, and it had the opposite amounts for the cream and milk. That recipe works every time.

Made exactly as the recipe calls for.  Super easy and very delicious!  I used this ice cream to make a Giant Ice Cream Sandwhich cake.  Definetly will make again and again.  Very soft ice cream and very tasty.  I let me ice cream mixture cool overnight.   I did have to mix an extra 5 mins in my ice cream maker.  The instructions called for 20-30 mins for my kitchen aid ice cream mixer and I ended up going for at least 35 mins.

I love this base recipe! I usually make this recipe as described or if in a hurry with sweetened condensed milk that's already cold and then add things like Oreos or frozen strawberries or whatever we're craving at the time. Though Oreos are hands-down my favorite thing to add to this recipe! But even made exactly as is, it'sabsolutely delicious! I had noticed that another reviewer stated it didn't work in their old fashioned ice cream maker, but works in mine just fine. Maybe they didn't use enough rock salt/ice?

Made as is without any changes to the recipe. This was a very easy ice cream to make, and it came out pretty tasty too considering it only has four ingredient. 

What I didn't like: I thought is was a little on the too sweet side, so next time I'll reduce the sugar a bit. I didn't know how much this would make as the recipe didn't state this, and it turns out that for my machine, I could have doubled it, or at least added another cup of milk (probably would have balanced out the sweetness a little more). 

So next time, I'll increase the milk by a cup, and maybe add 1/8 teaspoon of guar gum. Guar gum is a natural product that helps to increase mouthfeel allowing you to use less cream. If this turns out, I'll use this as my base for other ice creams in the future.

I made a couple of changes. I used heavy coconut cream for the milk. Since the can was short by a few ounces, I used 3 ounces of full fat Almond milk. I did use the heavy whipping cream (organic). This ice cream turned out so good! It was creamy and smooth. Yes! Most definitely yes, I'll be making this again!

I followed the recipe, toasting the coconut and putting it through the food processor. This is the best coconut ice cream ever! Itâ€™s very creamy and the coconut flavor is very intense.

This was the first time I ever made ice cream in a machine my husband's owned since he was a kid. I doubled the recipe and it made about a 1/2 gallon. It's softer than store bought but I understand that homemade ice cream usually is. This was a simple recipe for a first-timer, easy to follow and my 4 year old was thrilled.

Amazing recipe! I'm trying to fing an easy and tasty recipe for our family - we are all love ice cream. And this recipe is great! For the first trying I made a vanilla flavor and peach (mixed with the peach sugar-free jam). Great taste! The next is raspberry and chocolate! Thank you, Chef John, for this recipe!

I might add a tad bit more heavy cream next time, but it was absolutely surprisingly delicious.  It's my first time making ice cream, and I thought it was a bit too sweet, so while it was mixing in the ice cream maker I smashed half a bar of 72% dark chocolate into choco chips and mixed it in- it balanced out the sweetness and gave a nice texture!

This Is a great ice cream. I have made it just like the recipe suggest. I later tweaked it buy adding lime juice and some rind. I also made a mint chip with it. This is a awsome recipe you will not be disappointed.

Great base! The recipes with sweetened condensed milk are too syrupy and other cream/milk balances don't get the classic ice cream curl when serving like this recipe does.

I switched out the white sugar with Stevia (zero calorie sweetner) I did not transfer to a automatic ice cream maker , but to a chill fast ice cream maker. It came out very well and was enjoyed by all. I highly recommend this recipe...

This was my first time making ice cream.  I've always used recipes from this site because they've always turned out perfectly.  However, something was off with this recipe.  The milk to cream ratio was off because this was nothing but ice milk.

I make this recipe all the time and itâ€™s amazing!! Iâ€™ve tried freezing for few hours vs overnight and I think the best consistency is just few hours. You donâ€™t need to do any longer than that...I swear it changes it to more icey than ice cream overnight.....
I also double batch it and just enough for our ice cream maker

The ice cream came out gorgeous! This was the second time I've made ice cream, and with this recipe I nailed it! However, the vanilla extract was just a bit on the excess side. I would recommend putting half the given amount.

I got an ice-cream maker for my birthday in May, and have been using it constantly!! This was the first ice-cream recipe I made, and it turned out great! I almost always use this one, and just use add-ins like cookies and mint extract to change the flavor.  Excellent recipe, Chef  John, thanks! :)

Love it! I added 2 extra tsp of vanilla though because I felt the flavor needed to pop a little more. That's just my opinion though.

It was more like ice milk ice cream.  I even added more vanilla but it just was bland.

I made two batches of ice cream following this recipe exactly. I was very disappointed. I used the kitchenaid ice cream maker attachment, left the bowl in the freezer for well over 24 hours, and let my milk/cream/sugar mixture chill to 36 degrees before beginning. It churned for 40 minutes the first time, and barely got post the slush stage. It also tastes more like flavorless ice milk. For the second batch I tried using it as a base for cookies n' cream, but that turned out horribly. I let it churn for about 25 minutes until it was looking thick, added in my crushed Oreos, and it turned to complete slush. After churning for an hour it never became thick or creamy.

It was great but instead of whipping cream. I used cool whip and some homage butter milk (cream)
