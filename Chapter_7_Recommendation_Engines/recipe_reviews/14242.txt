Very good & different recipe.I am a vegetarian, so instead of chicken broth, I just added curry powder to the water & boiled the bulgur. In india, we pressure cook cracked wheat with veggies like cauliflower, peas, carrots & potatoes after frying the bulgur in a little clarified butter. That tastes good but this idea of using uncooked vegetables is amazing. Thanks a lot.

I halved the amount of chili powder, and still could not even eat this salad.  I am a big fan of bulgar wheat (tabouli salad is a favorite)but I had to through this away.  It definitely needs some oil or something to tone down the citrus/chili powder flavor

Found the recipe easy and useful as a base.  A bit bland for us so I tossed in some oil and vinegar.  Worked well.

I did not like this salad at all because of the chili lime dressing.  I would have preferred the basic ingredients with an italian style dressing or something with less bite.  My husband did like it although agreed that the chili powder does overwhelm all the other ingredients.

OK....this to me was really good! Some of the other reviews werent so hot on this dish, but I decided to try anyway. Glad I did. My only change was to used fresh lemon juice instead of the lime because I didnt have limes. I thought this was light and refreshing. Yes, very healthy, but thats what I was looking for. This was my first attempt at using Bulgur and it was a success. This is going to be a great salad come summer when you want to eat light. I also sprinkled some cayenne pepper on mine cause I like the heat. Will me making often! Thanks!

Very good salad.  I used lemon juice instead of lime and added a bit of EVOO.  Only added chili powder to taste.  Make sure the dressing has a bit of a bite before you add the bulgur as the bulgur sucks it up.

The combination of cracked bulgar and vegetables was wonderful. When I made the dressing it didn't smell very good, so instead I made a vinaigrette of cider vinegar, chili powder, and olive oil. The cider vinegar added a bright note to the salad.

I pour boiling veggie/chicken broth over the bulgar (2 to 1). Strain it. Add indicated veggies plus a ton of fine chopped parsley (at least a cup), 2TBS lemon instead of lime juice and generous splash of cider vinegar, skip the chili and garlic power and top it off with half olive oil and half blended soy/sesame oil. Lots of fine pepper, some salt and that is how I've made it for 30+ years.

It's colorful and chock full of healthy ingredients.  However, it lacked a certain tastiness.  I'm not likely to make this recipe again.

This was very good and very easy. I used part of an English Cucumber, pre shredded carrots and used minced garlic rather than powder. I probably used more veggies than the recipe called for, but for so few calories you really get a lot of food!

Not bad if you like bland food,made with salmon they went pretty good but I added olive oil and avocado on the side. That makes a difference.

Was looking for a burgul salad and found this recipe.  Love it, so simple but delicious and filling.  I added a little olive oil and fresh ground pepper instead of chili.

Finally, a recipe for bulgur that is not tabouli! I think it's good just like it is. The dressing is tasty and not overpowering. This one is a keeper.

I love bulgur salads but did not like the chili/lime dressing on this recipe.  I brought this to work for lunch and I didn't have the desire to finish it.  I didnt want to waste a fibrous salad with veggies, so the next day, I mixed olive oil, lemon, and kosher salt, tossed it to the salad.
