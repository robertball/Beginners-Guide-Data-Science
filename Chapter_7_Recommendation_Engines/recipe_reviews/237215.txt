Definitely not enough flour for the moisture in the milk and the carrots.   OK flavor, but not planning to put them in the family rotation.

These are flavorful and tender. Even my son who hates carrots liked them, and a good thing, too. I wish I had noted the servings before I made these. For a family dinner I would quarter or even eighth the recipe.

The amounts of ingredients are a bit confusing and the ratio seems off. Way too much milk, I had to use about 6 cups of flour for the dough to form, with 4.75 cups of flour the dough was way too soft and watery. And even with 6 cups of flour, the dough I got at the end was still very sticky and hard to shape. The result came out to be ok,
