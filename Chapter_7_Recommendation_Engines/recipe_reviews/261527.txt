These were really good! I added some chopped portobello mushrooms in with the meat because another bison burger I was making had them in there and I liked the idea. The one thing I did like better about this recipe was the bacon because well lets face it.....bacon does make everything better. I used shredded cheese instead of slices because that it all that I had. This is an excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing!
