This is perfect to bring to any party/gathering and I love that I can pretty much make it the night before (waiting to add the avocado right before serving).

I used juice from half an orange in addition to the lime juice and  it was perfect. This will be one of my staples from now on.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe as is, although I forgot to buy the avocado which only made a difference to me because I knew it was missing.  I'll definitely add it next time. This will become one of my signature dishes when I entertain. Thank you Chef John!

This has become a staple in our house, made this several times and will make it again when our daughter's family visits from Vermont this Easter weekend. So good and very filling, this is an entre not an appetizer. Serve with flour and corn tortillas, I prefer corn tortillas!!

This was pretty good!  I think I may have added too much cucumber BC it tasted a little watered down.  And next time, I’ll add more avocado! I mean, ya can’t go wrong w more avocado!!!

Pickle juice? Hmm wondering about that. Love the recipy and it's almost exact as I've been making for years, I did sometimes add either fresh or frozen sweet corn..i do know there is nothing traditional about that except that corn is a staple in Mexico, and it does a nice sweet to the spicy savory tangy flavor...either way 2 thumbs up.

Oh. My. GAWD!!! This was delicious.  I didn’t think there would be anyway I would love this style of shrimp cocktail better than the  other kind I had been eating all of my life but boy, was I wrong!  I couldn’t find any clam juice anywhere, so I had to use Clamato. It was spicy so I omitted the cayenne pepper, and I added a little garlic salt that had parsley in it in addition to the parsley (because we are garlic lovers). Everything else I followed to a T.  I made a huge bowl of it, thinking it would last but it was gone in 24 hours with just 3 of us eating it for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  This is easily my favorite recipe I have found in years. Not to mention that aside from the ketchup, it is a pretty darn healthy meal (and snack) for anytime of the day. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made it, but I didn't add the celery, did add some V8 juice and some Clamato spicy juice, cause I recall my dad using those juices and not adding celery. :-)

I've made this several times and made the most amazing discovery: people who don't like shrimp and/or spicy fresh vegetable mixtures don't seem to like this recipe.  The rest of us say "scr** em" and eat their share.  I never have all the ingredients for any of CJ's recipes but this one is forgiving of my inadequacies.  It definitely needs the hot sauce and crushed red pepper flakes don't hurt either.
