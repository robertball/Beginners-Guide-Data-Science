No creaming, no adding ingredients one by one,  no alternating ingredients. Basically dump everything in a bowl and mix.  How easy is that?  Great cake – moist, pleasantly spiced with cinnamon, with no shortage of blueberries for sure.  I made this as cupcakes, then piped each with a small rosette of lemon cream cheese frosting:  1/2 c. butter, 2 oz. softened cream cheese, 2-1/2 c. powdered sugar, some fresh lemon zest and enough milk or cream to achieve desired consistency.  Very nice recipe.

I halved this recipe and baked it in a 9 inch round cake pan. The result was very pretty. The cake is full of blueberries with a subtle hint of cinnamon. Nice and moist too. I made a crumb topping for it using brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and butter. Terrific! Thanks AuntieJ

Awesome recipe. I substituted butter for shortening (the same amount) and instead of sour cream, I used 1 cup of vanilla yogurt. 

If you plan on doubling the recipe, I suggest baking it on 325 instead of 350, as it is a denser cake. 

Will definitely be making this again! and again and again and again :)

My 7 year old loves blueberries and requested a blueberry cake for her birthday. I found this recipe and decided to try it out. I made it as written and it was WONDERFUL. I was a bit worried because the batter was so thick, but it was perfect! I used two 9" round cake pans to make a layered cake. I made cream cheese frosting  to frost the cake. Great recipe. I will definitely be making this cake again!

I halved this recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pan.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Even with the smaller cake, it still took the full baking time to test done. This is a nice, moist, classic blueberry cake.  We enjoyed it with a little whipped cream and additional fresh berries.

This was really good. If you don't like overly sweet cake you may want to scale back the sugar. Added a tsp of vanilla. This was so moist and really nice with the cinnamon. I didn't think it needed any topping. My husband wanted some though.

This was great as written; didn't find it too sweet at all.  Added about half a teaspoon of strong almond flavoring and a handful of sliced almonds to the batter, then sprinkled more sliced almonds and a bit of sugar on top before baking.

I cut the recipe in half and made it in an 8x8 pan, since it's just my husband and me and I'm on a diet (I like to torture myself).  Also used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk, as that is what I had.  This was very good.  I enjoyed it as is, but think I might like to try it with a crumb topping another time.

Made the full recipe. Lessened the sugar, skipped the cinnamon,  & added lemon juice & zest, a lot, and baked it in a bundt pan. End result was my hubby of 45+ years says this is the BEST cake I've EVER made! Made it for Easter 2014, totally easy and so good!  Glazed it with a lemon glaze.

It was my husband's birthday so I asked him what kind of cake would you like.  He hits me with a blueberry cake...really?  Never made one of those before.  So I came across this recipe and decided to give it a whirl.  It came out perfect. It was so good my 5 year old said he wanted this cake for his next birthday.

**I will say that we do like icing in my house so I made some cream cheese icing & baked it in layers.  Will definitely make again!

I was so excited to find a simple blueberry cake recipe after seeing many recipes that involved separating eggs, whipping egg whites, etc.  I left out the cinnamon (personal preference) and sweetened with maple syrup instead of sugar (3/4 cup maple syrup for 1 cup sugar, reduce the buttermilk to 3/4 cup) and substituted a mixture of lemon juice and soy milk for the buttermilk to make it non-dairy.  I also used spelt flour instead of wheat flour. The result was a cake that everyone in my sister-in-law's family could eat (they have various food restrictions). Not only could they eat it, but they loved it!

Great, easy recipe. I made two recipes and baked them at the same time in two sheet cake pans. Then I put a whipped cream frosting in the middle and a simple glaze on top. A hit with all!

Love this recipe.  Easy and tasty.  We serve it with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.   When I'm feeling extra healthy, I replace half or more of the flour with whole wheat.

Was looking for a kinda different birthday cake.  And I love me some blueberries so this caught my attention.

Everyone knows lemon and blueberries go great together.  So I was pretty curious about using cinnamon instead.

Cooked this in a bundt pan for 50 mins and turned out great.  Moist and not too sweet.  I used some frozen wild blueberries (thawed)  since I prefer their size over the big fresh ones and they turned out great.

Taste kind of reminded me of coffee cake or cinnamon-raisin bread.

For a simple, basic cake, this is really good.  I read the reviews, and subbed my homemade applesauce for half of the oil, and used some yogurt for most of the buttermilk.  I don't usually put icing on cake, so was happy that this is good without it.  My husband likes it, so it will be made again!  Thanks for posting.

I subbed applesauce for the oil, was a  bit apprehensive about the quantity of baking powder, but it turned out just fine. In a 9 inch diameter round pan, took exactly 35 minutes to be golden brown. And the taste is wonderful!! We didn't need frosting, just sprinkled coloured sugar balls while baking. Will definitely be making again and again.

Made this to find a good use for extra blueberries, it was great. Moist, not too sweet, very dense cake. I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil (do this with all baking), and used yogurt in place of buttermilk, as I had none on hand. The batter is really really really thick. So thick, the the hand mixer blades were completly covered and almost unable to unbatter, if that makes sense. May just mix without electric next time.
I topped with homemade vanilla buttercream icing, and it was just the right amount of sweet to make this awesome.

This cake was well liked by my family. I did make some changes; I substituted 1 cup of sugar for Splenda (I'm Diabetic ).  I used a bundt pan and frozen blueberries so I had to extend the baking time to 60 minutes. I did use my mixer and mixed well with each addition. I reserved a 1/2 cup of flour and tossed it well with the blueberries then folded it in with the batter and poured into the bundt. The cake was light and the berries cooked, and were through out the cake. I will make it again but will make a few changes; substitute the cinnamom for 2 tsp. Vanilla plus lemon rind from 1 small lemon. Mix the rind in with the flour,  the vanilla with sugar and oil/eggs. I think, either flavours with this cake & blueberries, will taste amazing.

Loved this! It was a HUGE hit at a dinner party, guests asked to take extra home with them :) I did make a few alterations - lowered the sugar to 1&1/4 cups, used half oil and half unsweetened applesauce, added the zest of half a lemon and added about a half cup more blueberries (because can you really ever have too many?). I iced it with a lemon cream cheese frosting/glaze (4 oz cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter, the juice of one lemon and zest of half) and it was wonderful! I'm definitely keeping this in my dessert favorites!

I made this for my 32 year old granddaughter's birthday and it was a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly, but cooked it in a bundt pan for a total of 60 minutes.  After I cooked and removed it from the pan, I glazed it as recommended by another reader, with 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 2 t fresh lemon juice.  This was easy and delicious!

Very easy, the only change I made was the batter after mixing appeared a little dry so I add half cup of apple sauce.

One bowl, a spoon and your ingredients is all it takes to make this cake. On top of ease of preparation, the taste and texture are perfect. Best blueberry cake I have ever made.

I am rating this 5 stars but I did not get to eat it, yet.  I made it for my son to take as he travelled out of state to a friend's house.  It came together so quickly and baked up beautifully and smelled great!  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla.  I will make very soon and try it and update the rating with taste.  Thanks!  UPDATE:  I made it today in a bundt cake pan.  It took about an hour. Delicious!  I did add a tsp of vanilla and made my own buttermilk made with lactose free milk (for one son) and a TBSP fresh lemon juice.  Served it to hubby tonight with vanilla ice cream (did not frost it.  So easy and excellent taste).  ANOTHER UPDATE:  Made this for July 4th barbecue yesterday.  I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract (along with the tsp of vanilla that I added) and some slivered almonds.  Cooked a little over an hour in a bundt pan. YUUMM.  It was gone! LAST UPDATE:  I used 3/4 teaspoon of almond extract along with the teaspoon of vanilla....just perfect and many compliments.  It would be nice with nuts added, too, if you like nuts.

Substituted almond extract for cinnamon, and added slivered almonds to a Bundt pan before pouring in the batter. The cake was wonderful; not too sweet, but a real adult pleaser! Also, I did mix the wet and dry ingredients separately (just in case) and baked at 375.

I made as is, with the exception of adding two tablespoons of Vanilla. I think next time I would omit the cinnamon (personal preference, not a fan of cinnamon & blueberry together). I had a two year old and 5 year old helping make this and it came out perfect. Very easy to make and turned out great.
