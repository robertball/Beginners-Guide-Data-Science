Nice, smooth texture, moderate spice and easy to make.  I combined all the dry ingredients and added the mixed wet ingredients (this includes the sugar), mixing until smooth.  Omitted the almonds, and folded in the chocolate chips.  These make good muffins as well as mini loaves.  An delightful fall treat!

This loaf is TASTY. Kids couldn't tell it had pumpkin in it. I used cold, mashed, roast pumpkin and decreased the amount of chocolate chips. I also didn't use any almonds because I didn't have any. A very light, moist loaf.

This is absolutely an awesome bread.  Next time, I will cut back on the sugar because the chocolate chips add sweetness.  This is a keeper!

I left out the almonds and added more chocolate chips, according to my taste preferences. The bread seemed overbaked on the outside but was so moist on the inside that it fell apart as I sliced it. I brought what I could salvage to church for Bible class and heard many compliments. It's really good!

Yum!  I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup of coconut instead of chocolate chips and almonds. Moist and delicious.  Kids and hubby loved it too.

Different lighter flavor than my traditional pumpkin bread recipe. I left out the chocolate chips and almonds and decreased the sugar to 1-1/4 cups - you can't tell the difference. I baked it in 2 smaller pans and they were done in 45 minutes. One loaf for my family and one loaf to share!

Really, really good snack bread. I didn't have any almonds, and it was still excellent. It's also great for slicing thick and freezing for school lunches.

I made this last week. My family loved it. It makes a large loaf, moist and tasty, and it keeps well. The only change I made was to omit the almonds. This one is a keeper!
