This was great! It can be used as a filling inside a tortilla too. That is how we ate the leftovers. I will definitely will cook this meal again :)

My husband and I loved this dish!  I loved how quick and easy it was.  I used ground turkey, added corn, and I also ended up using 2 jars of salsa because we wanted it "saucier."  My kids thought it was too spicy, but they were enticed by the chips and cheese on top of it.  I will definitely make this again.

It was cheesy. It was easy and *extremely fast* to make. It didn't have much flavour. It was okay but I wouldn't make it again.

Very easy to make, and the salsa and chili peppers gave it just enough spice.  The only fault I found with it was that the skillet mix was just a bit too juicy, but other than that, I loved it.

I have been making this recipe for my now teenage boys for 8-9 years.  I leave out the chilis (because we don't like spicy) as well as the mushrooms.  The guys scoop it up with tortilla chips.  It is quick, easy, satisfying and customizable.

What an easy meal to put together!  My husband, who is not a big fan of Mexican food, went back for seconds.
