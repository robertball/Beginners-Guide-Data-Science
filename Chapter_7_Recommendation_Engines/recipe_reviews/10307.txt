I had hoped to find a traditional New Mexican biscochitos recipe and was excited to try this one.  Unfortunately, the dough was impossible to roll out and I had to take extra time I didn't really have to roll dough into individual balls and press with a glass to flatten.  I think due to this extra handling, the cookies turned out tougher than they should be.  The biscochitos recipe I had made in the past resulted in very buttery, fine-textured cookies- these were hard and crumbly.  I took care not to over-bake, and followed the recipe to a "T".  Also, it should be noted that this recipe makes FAR more than 3 dozen cookies.  I think I ended up with 6 dozen cookies or more. I do not recommend using this recipe.

I live in New Mexico and these are the best Biscochito cookies I have ever had!!!  I have made them for the last few years at Christmas and told my firends/famliy I only had time to make one kind of Cookie and this is the one they ALL picked.  

I use real butter and double the anise seeds (which isn't really nesseccary). 

!Muy Bueno! -- Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe was not the best.  I have another recipe which I wish I would of used, but instead I tried this one because the ratings seemed high. I will never use this one again.  I had to add water to make the dough form.  It was so dry and crumbling, I had to add water to make the dough form. I do not recommend this recipe.

This is a lovely recipe. You just have to be sure to start with soft shortening and cream it well with the other wet ingredients. Because I read the other reviews before trying the recipe, I added extra anise seed (3tsp) (crushed in a mortar/pestle), some anise extract (1tsp) because I felt my anise seeds were a little old. Lovely texture and my 3 y/o loved them and he's very picky.

We had a Mexican Fiesta on Christmas Eve and everyone really liked these cookies.  They had a really nice, mild flavor, and were different from our usual sugar cookies.   I didn't use brandy for the kids - 7UP was a great substitute.   I assumed the anise seed was supposed to be whole, and that also worked out just fine.

I logged on to locate a cookie that involed childhhod memories. Imagine my surprise when I found it. Further imagine my absolute delight when I read that Paricia's mother shared her name with my mom. My mother is named Margaret Miera and my best friend is a Romero. How great is that! To top it off the recipe is perfect, delicious and now a tradition of my family for holidays.

Traditional "New Mexican" cookie for the holidays and special occasions. I was thrilled to see this "family recipe" in print. My copy was hand written by my great grandma and I remember cutting-out the cookies with my mother and dipping them in the cinnamon/sugar mixture before placing them in the oven to cook. I could never eat just one!!

What a treat! Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It's been a friend's family secret for years, and I've only been able to enjoy their cookies over Christmas. I love family recipes most because you can taste the love. Thanks!!

Great authentic Mexican Christmas cookie that brought back memories of making them with mi abuela from Southern Colorado.... the Maes & Martinez family love them!  We had a few slight modifications: 1.  Use 1 T of anise liquid instead of anise seed to make the taste more uniform & subtle. 2.  ALWAYS use lard as it keeps the cookie light like shortbread.  We melt it in the microwave then refrigerate the dough for about 30 mins before rolling the cookies. 3.  We also dust them in red or green sugar sprinkles for Xmas tree or reindeer shapes, or orange pumpkin shapes at Halloween ... just as good. 4.  I use bread flour & sift it 3 times which seems to help keep them really light & airy. 5.  For newbies, these cookies are supposed to be thick... don't roll the dough out too thin & cook them til they are a light golden brown on bottom.  Both my Latino family & gringo friends love these cookies.  I usually end up making around 10 batches at Christmas!

I made these for a fiesta themed christmas eve dinner. They were just a tad bland but good. I liked them better after they had sat and absorbed more of the anise flavor. Good for freezing and I also used my cookie press which worked great and was really simply.

I really liked the flavor of these cookies.  The anise seed and cinnamon area nice combination.  Since I didn't have a trefoil cookie cutter, I used a cookie press with three holes.  Worked very well and was very quick.

I lost the recipe I used for years and tried this one.  I don't recommend it.  They don't melt in your mouth the way they're supposed to and are lacking in flavor.  BTW, Biscochitos are the traditional cookie of NM, not just Taos.

Traditionally, biscochitos are made with lard, not shortening. If you want the authentic, traditional biscochito, you must use lard. As for the issue of cutting out the brandy because of the kids, alcohol evaporates when baked, and only the flavor remains.

This is a great recipe!  For all who have had problems, it is a user error.  I was born and raised in New Mexico and have watched my grandmother and mother make these for over 30 years, and the only difference is that my grandmother used LARD.  My mom has used Crisco for many years now, and honestly we cannot tell the difference.  Believe you me though, I bet our cholesterol levels can!  Anyway, I have used this recipe and love the way they come out, taste just like my moms!  Thank you for the recipe, as I needed to have the ingredients broken down into measurements for me.  My mom does not measure when baking these cookies, a true Biscochito maker does not have to.

This recipe was a blast from the past.  My Grandmother, Grace Miera, used to send us these cookies every Christmas.  As she has now passed away, I was desperately looking for this recipe.  My grandfather, Edmund, was unable to locate it.  When I found this recipe with the Miera name referenced in the description, I knew I found it.  This recipe brought back alot of memories and wonderful taste.  I did alter the recipe slightly using lard instead of shorteneing as this is a traditional Mexican cookie.  Thank you!!!!!

These were better than expected! An interesting flavored-shortbread style cookie. I had no shortening used all butter. Had no anise seed used fennel seed. The family DEVOURED them! The key to tenderness is to not overwork the dough.

Excellent recipe, absolutely loved it!  I did not have anise and substituted with Mexican vanilla "Molina" and also substituted brandy with fresh orange juice and added the orange zest.  Baked for 10 minutes and they came out heavenly soft and delicious!!!! Thank you for this recipe, it is a keeper.  :)

I made these with friends and they were a hit.  I added extra cinnamon into the dough for more flavor.  I rolled out to about 1/2" thickness and made sure not to overbake.  We did leaf shapes for fall last time and they turned out great!  Pronounced biz-ko-CHEE-toes

This recipe is almost identical to the one I have been using for years.  With one exception.  Actually, two.  I never use brandy or wine.  Mostly because I never seem to have it on hand when I need it.  I just use water.  The biggest difference is that I have gone back to using 1 lb of lard, which is the "most" traditional.  In an attempt to ameliorate bad fat impact, I had tried margarine (both regular and diet), butter, crisco and butter flavored crisco.  They just don't have the result that lard gives.  It is a firm, crumbly cookie - not crisp or "chewy" - much like a Pecan Sandie in texture.

I roll the dough out and use a bottle lid to cut bite size cookies so I always end up with waaaay more than 3 dozen cookies. I gave up years ago using fancy cuts since the star or angel or whatever always got misshapen in transferring it to the cookie sheet.   I press the rounds into a cinnamon sugar mixture and then lay them on a cookie sheet.    Keep in mind that humidity levels can affect the amount of liquid you need.  When I got my recipe over 60 years ago,  it said "1/4 C, more or less as needed, of brandy" so I already knew to adjust liquid levels as needed.  Pat Quinto Kemm Mann

This is the closest recipe I know to the original "Grandma Sofia Biscochitos!" I did not use lard, instead I used Crisco butter flavored sticks. That's what made it buttery all right!

Absolutely what I was looking for!  Used to get these as a kid at the local Mexican bakeries here in Washington state (very few).  Made a similar recipe for my brothers wedding then lost it! This one was a bit different but fabulous.  I was hesitant about the whole anise seed so I ground it instead, then accidently put 2 Tbsp rather than the 2 tsp, the flavor was heavenly!!!!  I also prefer to bake them plain then toss gently in a bowl of cinnamon & sugar.  The texture was devine.  I LOVE, LOVE this recipe and will take these tonight to my family's Christmas eve gathering....they will be a great ending after eating tamales all night!  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I got my first recipe for these wonderful cookies from Spanish class in highschool.  I have since lost that recipe.  This one is way better though.  Even though it's time-consuming and the dough takes some work, it's well worth it.  They're great for the holidays, especially for coffee drinkers.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I was craving my childhood favorite and decided to try this one. Since I never in my life remember using shortening, I substituted lard for the shortening and then realized I didn't have brandy so I used Jack Daniels...still came out great! (according to many co-workers as well)My semi vegitarian friend didn't like the lard and may have preferred the shortening.

These cookies are delicious. They are  lightly sweet, and the combination of anise seed and cinnamon sugar make them pretty different. They take a bit of work to make, but the end result is certainly worth it.

I maded these for Christmas 2005 for all my native Colorado/New Mexico family.  These loved these and everyone took some home.  They taste like shortbread.

I made these for our thanksgiving feast and were well liked by my picky sister. I used a maple leaf cutter and when sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar, they looked like fall leaves.I personally thought they were okay, probably not for every one.The dough is a little tricky to work with, but they did look nice.

Just like the biscochitos I had when I went to college in Albuquerque! I did add anise extract in addition to the anise seeds and, because I had read this somewhere else, I rolled the dough between two sheets of wax paper...worked beautifully! I will make again!

this recipe was okay, my dough was really dry and crumbly, it would not hold together. I followed the directions for the recipe exactly and the cookies ended up being really dry and fell apart.

Made these tasty little cookies...easy, very good flavor. I made them for my daughter-in-law...Mexican...she got pregnant and could not eat them..

I might use powdered sugar instead next time just to see how that affects the outer coating..

These cookies were kind of bland. I made a glaze for them with confectioners sugar, 1/2 teaspoon anise extract, about 4 or 5 tablespoons of brandy, and a little milk. They now taste the way I imagined they were supposed to, but they are much more messy now :/

My cookies turned out a little harded than I like. So I sealed them in a contained with two slices of apple and it softened them. Next time I make then I will use more anise seed maybe 3 tsp.

I tried the recipe as it was, and it was way too dry. So the next time I only used 5 cups of flour and 1/3 a cup of brandy instead of 1/4. They were delicious! My family loved them, and they hard critics being native New Mexicans!

This is the official State Cookie of New Mexico.

I was tentative as I am not a huge anise fan but these were great.  I used white wine instead of rum as I saw it in another recipe.  Also debated a very long time in the store on lard vs. Crisco.  Crisco won.  No trouble rolling them out and they came out very light and shortbread like.  I smushed the anise with the flat side of a mallet before adding.

Make 1/2 a recipe unless you are feeding a crowd. It makes a TON.  Think this is in my Christmas cookie rotation from now on.

Very dry. Being Native New Mexican, very disappointed in this recipe. Think it is too much flour. Even added an extra egg to the 6 cups but still very dry. I know this is supposed to be a "dry" cookie, but this was too dry.
