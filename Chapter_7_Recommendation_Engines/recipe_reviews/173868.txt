I make this same sandwich-yummy!  To make it 5 stars, use a really good artisan bread and put in in the panini press for a few minutes...gooey brie is the best!  Also, I skip the mayo, but that's just personal preference.

This was a delicious concept! I made quite a few changes to suit my husband and my's tastes. Instead of bread I used flour tortillas, used only green apples (I also cut them thicker so that the crunch was bigger), and I omitted the mayo and lettuce in favor of thin slices of mild cheddar. I then fried it up in a pan with some butter. YUM!
