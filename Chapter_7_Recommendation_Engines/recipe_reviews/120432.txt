Excellent and very easy. I used two thin cut ribeyes and instead of frying them I broiled them. Simply rub with the olive oil on both sides and then rub with the spice/herb mixture. Broil 3-5 minutes each side, depending on the thickness of your steaks and how done you want them to be. Excellent with a cucumber salad.

All I can say is WOW! This recipe was super easy and so tasty too! I wanted to cook rib eyes without firing up the grill in winter and this was the perfect recipe for me! I didn't change much, just added garlic salt and onion powder and didn't use the olives because we don't like them. Other than that, everything the same. Don't forget the lemon juice! It really adds something that makes it taste very "Greek" :o)

I really liked this recipe, the flavors blended so well. I did let the seasoned steaks sit for about 30 min before cooking. Combined with the feta cheese & olives. Yum! Great flavor.

These were SO good!  I used petite sirloin steaks and just cooked until my meat thermometer read 160.  I loved the way the herbs formed a yummy crust on the steaks. I loved the lemon flavor too, and the feta on top.  I just left off the olives since I was serving these with a Greek salad that already had olives.  This made a yummy Valentine's Day dinner with that salad and some pasta.

Great! I used spicy greek olives and bleu cheese because that's what I had. Other than adding some dry lemon juice to the rub, I followed th rest of the recipe. Thanks!

Being half Greek myself I decided to try this recipe for Valentine's night.  IT WAS A HIT!  Great taste.  Used feta cheese on the steaks but omitted the olives.  Husband loved it.  Thank you for the recipe!  We will use it again!

Followed the recipe with the exception of the feta and olives.  Steaks came out tasting great and remained moist.  I would recommend this recipe for a low end steak as well as long as you score the fatty edges so that the meat doesnt get ruined.

Very good.  Was looking something slightly different than a regular old steak and this turned out great! Made exactly how described.

We made this dish last night with two Ribeyes grilled.  It was fantastic!  The rub was perfect and the lemon juice added just the right amount of tang.  I am a cheese lover and over did it on the Feta and found myself searching for the great taste of the beef.  I would advise that you use just a sprinkling of the cheese (as the recipe calls for).  Thank you so much for sharing this, we will be making it again!

This was delicious!  As suggested I used the oil to rub the meat, sprinkled on the seasoning and broiled.  I left out the olives because I don't like them.  We will definitely make these again!

The flavor was excellent - but my rib steaks were the toughest I've ever bought!  I'm complaining to the butcher tomorrow!

These were great even without olives. The feta is just enough to be flavorful but not overwhelming. The seasonings compliment the tartness of the feta perfectly. Perfect with spinach or vegetable medley on the side.

Tip - Don't add too much salt to the meat since the feta cheese is salty. This is delicious and was my introduction to feta cheese, which I now love. The seasonings mesh so very well together with the cheese, black olives, and lemon juice.

This was delicious.  My husband raved. I omitted the olives from my portion. Also I let the steak marinade in the lemon/oil and seasoning mixture for about an hour.

Typically my hubby doesn't like his steaks messed with. He says he loves the taste of beef. Needless to say... I was of course a little hesitant about serving him this version of steak....Wow!!! He enjoyed it a lot. Every bite was an ooo!!! Awh!!! This taste so good. The recipe also didn't state what type of olives to use...So, I used green sliced olives. Just Wonderful!!!

Wonderfully fast and easy to prepare and cook, although I definitely recommend only cooking for seven minutes on each side. I was worried about undercooking the steaks, so I cooked each side for nine minutes and ended up with them being medium well instead of medium rare. Still, very tasty, a great "bang for the buck" considering the minimal time involved. The lemon juice- soaked feta is an especially nice element!

Everyone who had them loved them! I used T-bone instead of ribeye because they were on sale, and they turned out great. We grilled them instead of pan frying. I also used the seasoning on soy chicken for me, and it was really good. Thanks so much!

I loved the simplicity of this recipe.  However I wondered if blue cheese, olives, and the seasoning are Greek?  Not to my recollection so I went to the Taste of Homes website and looked up this recipe. The blue cheese is an added option, they don't list on TOH.  So, as written it is delicious but lesson learned, if the recipe references Taste of Homes, I will double check with their website to verify the actual/submitted recipe.

This was really good! I just wanted to add that I used two 1/2 pound flat iron steaks and it worked just fine... I cooked each side of the steaks for about five minutes on medium heat with the skillet covered and they turned out juicy and well-done, just how I like them. I served them with Greek gigantes (giant white beans) and green beans. Thanks for the great recipe!

My boyfriend and I gave this recipe a try and loved it. Super easy but tastes great. We added sun dried tomatoes and used tomato / basil seasoned feta instead of plain. Yum!

Absolutely fantastic!  My fiance raved about these steaks for three days after eating them.  They came out perfectly  seasoned and crispy on the outside, but super juicy and tender on the inside (I heated to about 150 for medium rare).   If you don't have a grill, this is definitely the way to go.  Be sure to get thick, marbled cuts of meat.

I'm always leary of pan-fried steaks, but this sounded like a recipe worth trying. The flavors were great! The only changes I made were brushing the steaks lightly with olive oil before putting on the seasoning, letting the seasoned steaks sit about 30 minutes and adding some chopped sun dried tomatoes along with the feta and black olives. I will definitely make these again.

I was surprised by how much flavor the ingredients in this recipe added, and how well all the flavors blended.  We love steak and we love feta, but we never thought to put them together.  Very good!

Yummy!! I served as suggested with Feta and black olives. My sides were: Fresh green beans fried in butter and garlic, a sliced cucumber salad with a drizzle of EVOO, lemon juice and the left over rub. Per husband's request, this will be a regular around our house!

The seasoning is so good that the topping is not needed.  The olives make it too strong.  But I will probably use only this seasoning mix going forward!

I just made this recipe and it was EXCELLENT!  Everyone gave it 5 stars, so I thought, it has to be good.  Although, sometimes on Allrecipes, 5 stars doesn't always mean good.  This one exceeded my expectations and then some!  The feta cheese was awesome!  At first, I though it might be a little over seasoned.  And, when I cooked it, I wondered whether the seasoning would burn and ruin the steak.  Well, the seasoning was not overpowering at all, nor did it burn.  It was the perfect combination of everything and I will for sure pass this one on to friends and family....and, make it again soon!!!!

I normally just rub my steak with olive oil and Montreal steak seasoning. Last night I wanted to try something else so I picked this one. I was afraid that it would be too much seasoning but it wasn't. My husband and I loved it. It was quick and easy. I rubbed the steaks with olive oil then the seasoning. Grilled them on a wrought iron grill pan. Topped it with fried mushrooms and feta instead of olives. I then wanted so "au jus" so I poured some red wine into the pan, let it reduce a but then poured all that goodness over the steak and roasted potatoes I prepared as a side. DEEELICIOUS!

Perfect recipe if your grill is not available (we were out of propane). Could have cut the amount of basil & oregano (I had leftover herb mixture), but otherwise it was very flavorful and I will definitely make this again! My ribeyes were only 1" thick, so I cooked them 6 minutes a side (med heat in a stainless skillet). I let them rest a few minutes before serving, and they were a perfect medium. Don't be afraid if the outside looks a little overdone--the herbs will cook faster than the meat, but won't taste burnt even though they may look like they are.

We thought this was very good.  I did broil it and the flavor was good.  You just have to watch it closely.  We also used petite sirloins.  My husband agreed that the flavor really stays and is good.

This was a great steak.  I did make one change. I didn't have ripe olives on hand, but I did have Kalamata olive tapenade.  I spread a thin layer over the steak after the lemon juice, and before the feta. It didn't have the aesthetics that ripe olives would, but it most likely added a better flavor to every bite. I have made this twice, the first was grilled on my gas bbq, rubbing the steaks with oil and spices. And the second was on the stove.   I preferred the grilled one a little better.

I made this recipe for my husband and some friends.  They all loved it; the pickiest eater didn't have anything to say.  I didn't have any regular salt or garlic powder, but I did have garlic salt so that's what I used and it was fine.  I also didn't have any black olives I used Klamata olives instead. Will definitely use this one again.

I combined olive oil,  a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar & the spices, then rubbed on steaks & broiled.  I then topped with the feta and broiled 2 more minutes.  Delicious & juicy!

This was AWESOME!!! We were out of olives, so instead I sauted some mushrooms and also put fresh, diced tomato on top. I also used the crumbled feta cheese with sundried tomato and basil seasonings. YUM-O! This entire combination would be excellent in a salad with some avocado, sauted onion, and a light blue cheese dressing.

LOVE IT!!! This was the first recipe I ever used when learning to cook steaks (5 yrs ago). It came out so good that I've never tweaked the recipe and I've made this at least once a month since. Delicious!

Delicious!  Perfect for a special dinner.  Made just as written, but rubbed the steaks w/ spices and just a little olive oil and broiled instead of fried. Thank you for sharing!

I found this recipe hard to follow. I wasn't sure how high to have the skillet, but even at a pretty low temperature, the outsides almost burned. Meanwhile, the insides didn't get cooked.

This was just okay for me...there seemed to be too many flavors going on with the rub, feta cheese, and olives.  My husband liked it, but I thought it was too salty

I put the rub on the meat as recommended and back in the frig for about an hour. Instead of cooking it whole I cut it into strips, cooked it then sprinkled it with lemon juice and made steak pita sandwiches.  I filled the pitas w/ the steak, feta, olives, tomato, onion, lettuce and topped w/ a dill cucumber sauce.  They came out great and the meat alone was excellent.  Next time I will make it as recommended.

Wow, very busy day but saw this on the homepage a few days ago and was excited to give it a try.  My 17 year old son and his buddy are studying for midterm exams and the smell was distracting them.  They couldn't wait to eat them, even though his friend had already eaten supper. We all loved the steaks and my husband loves me even more now.  I used lemon pepper instead of lemon juice and it was super.  I also threw in tarragon because I always use it with oregano.

I love this recipe.  I've made it twice now and wonder why I haven't made it more.  The only two times I've ever prepared a steak in my frying pan, but two of the best that I've had.  Followed the recipe to a T and it has turned out perfectly both times.  It's also very easy to make.

This was a mouthful of flavor!! The seasoning combination is awesome! I will be trying it on other types and cuts of meat. The only thing I didn't use were the black olives only b/c we don't care for them. Thanks for the recipe!! It's a keeper!

I have used this recipe several times now; it is definitely a keeper! Didn't change a thing the first time, but have made steaks since then using just the dry seasonings - I was out of feta and olives at the time - and they were still a mouthful of WOW! We like the seasoning combination so much that I mix it up in bulk (1/4 cup each of garlic powder, oregano, and basil; 1 Tbsp. salt; 1 tsp. black pepper) and keep it in a shaker jar!  It is a wonderful all-purpose seasoning mix. I have used it on hamburgers, and on chicken breasts... even sprinkled on half an avacado! YUM! My youngest son, who is in the midst of moving out on his own, asked me to make him a jar for his kitchen.  Hmm... what shall I try it on next?  Maybe fish?  Baked potatoes?  Steamed veggies?

I prepared this dish for mom on Mother's Day. It was so quick and easy, I really didn't expect it to turn out as good as it did! I've never tasted a steak that had anything like olives, cheese, or even lemon juice added to it, but these ingredients definitely enhanced the flavor and made for a splendid meal.

We tried this recipe without the cheese or olives. This made some of the best steak we have ever had. After trying this, we were disappointed with the steak at a few different steakhouses, so we just make our own steak now.

WOW..
all I can say is YUMMO!
Even my skeptical 15yr old though it was delish!
Quick and easy too.
I used olive oil and I think that added to the flavor also.

Super good and easy.  I had some small steaks in the fridge and some feta cheese so I put them together with this recipe.  The rub was super yum, I adjusted it for my personal tastes and omited the olives just because I was out and didn't want to make a trip to the store.  After the steaks were cooked I put them on a plate and topped with the cheese and put a lid over them just to warm and soften the cheese a little bit...mmmm, tasty!

This recipe was amazing. I was kind of scared about pan frying a 20 dollar rib eye. But let me tell ya, after eating it you will never want a steak any other way. The flavor combination is amazing. This is a new all time favorite for me!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was better than ok but not great.  Next time I'll do fresh oregano and basil then grill.

Excellent!  We didn't have rib eye in the house, so I used skirt steak.  Other than that, followed the recipe to a tee.  I am not a big fan of feta cheese; however, it really worked with this!

This was a really good seasoning for some rib-eye steaks I found in our freezer. My family has a habit of buying things and then they get lost in the freezer but it still tasted really good. It was really salty so next time I'll use half the salt and let them all salt their own but it was a big hit with everyone.. sans salt problem.

This was good. I omitted olives because I didn't have amy on hand but it still was good.

This rocked!  I used blue cheese and omitted the olives.  It was perfectly seasoned.  This one is a keeper!

This was easy and delicious. I had to add some salt to my steak, but my husband loved it as is.

One word: DELICIOUS!! My steak was a bit thinner (about 3/4 inch thick) so I only had to cook it for about 3 minutes on each side for med rare. So good! I will be making this regularly.

I made this steak for dinner and my husband thought it was the best pan friend steak he's ever tried next to grilling them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with just a rib steak, rather than the rib eye and it still was fabulous. The spices are just right and the blue cheese and black olives make it a very unique dish, delicious.

This was absolutely delicious. I am always looking for another way to cook these rather than grilling. I have definitely found a new way. I will surely make these again. EXCELLENT!!!
