I really enjoyed this! I modified it by using vanilla almond milk so I did not add any more vanilla or sugar. About half way through I added dried cranberries and chopped walnuts. A fabulous and healthy desert!

Yummy quinoa. A few changes: I used fat-free half-and-half in place of whole milk, substituted orange juice for 2 of the cups of water, added shredded coconut and raisins and used a bit more butter. Since the butter was salted, I didn't add more salt. In place of refined white sugar, I used a drop of real maple syrup. Next time, I'll skip the maple syrup because the bananas and orange juice definitely made it sweet enough.

Use a big pot when making this, I made a half recipe and it foamed up tremendously.

It's kind of like a light and airy tapioca.  The riper the banana I think the less the sweetener you need.  I had to add honey to mine because the banana wasn't overripe.

This is a great Quinoa receipe.  I make it for breakfast and I feel full until late in the afternoon.  I used skim milk and honey.  Thanks for sharing!

I had some quinoa that didn't know how to prepare, then found this recipe and tryed it, it turnd out to be yummy. However I introduced some changes, as I don't like bananas that much, used some powdered soy milk that added to the whole milk to give it the thickness, and also added an egg yolk 3 minuts before ending the cookin process, as well as some raisins. It was great. I prefferred to serve it cool. I'll try to post a picture, so you can see the results.

I had never tried Quinoa and had only recently heard of it.  This was my first try at it.  I loved this recipe.  The only changes I made were 1% milk, no salt added and sugar in the raw instead of white sugar.

Yummy!!!

Easy to make!  I subbed soy milk for cow's milk, and honey for the sugar because of family preferences.  This pudding was more like more like tapioca than rice pudding.  Next time, I'll try using a different fruit, maybe fruit cocktail.

This was a good way to use quinoa. I added cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to add some more flavour. I also made it with skim milk and honey and halved the butter to make it a little more healthy.

This was really good, and wonderful to make for my 3 year old who LOVES Quinoa.  It didn't thicken after cooking for about 15 minutes after adding the bananas, milk, and honey (instead of sugar), so I stirred 1/2 the mixture into a bowl with a 2 beaten eggs, then returned it to a boil for a couple minutes.

I thought it was good.  Next time I'll use Thai canned coconut milk.  I would also like to substitute the bananas with something that won't impact the coconut flavor.  I'll see what I can come up with.  Suggestions are welcome.

This was light and fluffy, I have been eating it as a breakfast cereal instead of for desert, because it reminds me of cream of wheat.

This was really good.  I used quinoa, vanilla almond milk, and bananas.  It was plenty sweet with just those ingredients.  This recipe makes about 5 cups total which is a lot of quinoa to eat.  If you are unsure if you will like it, I suggest halving or quartering the recipe.

Very tasty! I added in an extra bannana. After it had cooked for 10 mins. I put it back in the blender and pureed it. I then put it in a container and in the frig. This morning I scooped some out into a bowl, added a little bit of milk and microwaved it for a 1.5 mins. It was wonderful! More the texture of a creamy smooth cream of wheat. I also used skim milk for the recipe and the addition before reheating.

I loved this recipe but I made several changes to better suite my family. Substituted whole milk for fat-free soy. Added a scoop of vanilla protein powder. Halved the butter and used a teaspoon of Agave nectare instead of sugar. Added two egg whites to thicken during last 5 minutes of cooking. Topped with nutmeg and cinnamon... Terrific!

This is really good. The only thing we changed was to add a bit more sugar, left out the butter and added about 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch to get a more pudding like consistancy.

My little guy loved this (1.5 yrs).  It didn't thicken very well but that could be because I used 1% milk.  Next time I'll use less milk.  But the flavor is good.  Thanks.

I kinda liked this. I liked the texture, creamy like rice pudding, not too sweet. I could easily sub quinoa for rice in rice pudding. I just didn't care for the banana taste in this recipe. I made half a recipe with no problem. I didn't have whole milk so used evaporated milk and added 1/2 teas cinnamon. Threw in a handful of raisins at the end. I am going to find a regular rice pudding recipe and just sub quinoa in for the rice. Great idea!

I was trying to find ways to eat quinoa since it's so good for you.  I came upon this recipe and I'm so happy I did!  I followed the recipe w/no changes at all.  It has a mild flavor, it's not too sweet and not to bland.  It was perfect for breakfast.

I'm still getting used to the taste of Quinoa so it'll take a little while for me; nevertheless I do like the pudding. I made a few changes as I am trying to get different foods into my diet; instead of milk I used coconut milk which gives it an interesting flavour.

I made this with vanilla almond milk, but still added the vanilla. I used a bit of honey in place of the sugar, but did not need a lot due to the sweetness of the milk and banana. I also added cinnamon. Makes a nice breakfast!

This was my first attempt at cooking quinoa. It's a great recipe (I love banana) the quinoa texture is something between rice and tapioca. I did have to add an egg to help the pudding thicken and I subbed honey for the sugar. The pudding was delicious and held me for quite some time. =)

Turned out real nice, we added the raisins and walnuts per other readers' suggestions.  The butter didn't melt right away because the cold milk brought the temperature down quite a bit so I heated it up for 30 secs in the microwave and that did the trick.  I also added nutmeg since we were out of vanilla extract.

Liked this recipe a lot. I did think it was a little on the bland side as is, for my taste. I added a sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon onto each dish for serving. It added that little bite I was looking for and made it look pretty as well.

This is a great way to use quinoa!  I substituted the whole milk for vanilla soy milk and topped with cinnamon.  It's different but enjoyable.

I enjoyed this, but it was a little too thin for my liking, even after cooking 10 minutes. Might have been because there was still some water that wasn't absorbed by the quinoa after cooking... next time I'll check for that and drain it off if that's the case. I used non-fat milk and added about a half teaspoon of cinnamon, but thought it was a really good (and easy, and much more nutritious!) substitute for rice pudding, better cold than warm (my preference)

I love quinoa, and was excited after reading the reviews, but mine didn't turn out so well.  I didn't add the two tablespoons of sugar, however, and used honey instead.  It looked great when cooking, but just didn't taste that creamy and rich like rice pudding.  It turned gray in the refrigerator, too.  Good concept, though.

I didn't really care for this. This was my first experience with quinoa, so maybe I'm just not used to it yet. Also, for me the banana taste was a little overpowering. I'll have to try again without the banana.

Actually I'd give this 4.5 stars. I used red quinoa, maple syrup instead of sugar and skim milk. It didn't want to thicken up for me though, so I added an egg yolk after 20 minutes of simmering then brought to a boil for 3 minutes. That did the trick. Stirred in vanilla and raisins. Delicious! Thank you so much for the great idea!

Its very earthy tasting, which I find a natural characteristic of quinoa anyways. It tastes like a less sweet version of rice pudding... Good for breakfast, maybe not so much for dessert.

This is an interesting recipe. I only had 1 ripe banana and I used 2% milk because that's what I had on hand. Once I added the banana/milk mixture, it smelled horrible during the cooking process, and that made me a little worried. I also couldn't get the mixture to thicken up after 30 minutes at a rolling boil, so I added an egg yolk (tempered so it doesn't "scramble"). That did the trick. Maybe the second banana would have changed the thickening process. I let it cool for a bit and tried it warm with cinnamon and raisins sprinkled on top. It's good, but as much as I like bananas, they don't really do it for me in this recipe. I think I'll try again next time and skip the bananas altogether and just go with 2 egg yolks to add the richness and help with thickening. By the way, even though the recipe suggests serving this pudding warm, it is way better the next day right out of the refrigerator.

I used coconut milk in lieu of whole milk (mostly because I didn't want to go to the store to buy milk). The result was extremely thick, creamy pudding. I also added honey, brown sugar, real maple syrup, and cinnamon to try to disguise the flavor of the quinoa, which was a bit overpowering. Still yummy, but not quite as dessert-like as I would have hoped.

This pudding was really good. I soaked the quinoa first for probably 1 hour. I used soy milk instead of whole milk and used 1 tsp of brown sugar.

This was fine, but not great. I used applesauce instead of bananas, and fat free milk with a little canola oil instead of whole milk, which seemed to work. Maybe it would have been better if I followed the recipe exactly, though.

This is a delicious breakfast for anyone who likes cream of wheat or oatmeal. The only subs I made were 1.5 c of skim milk + .5 c whole milk, honey instead of sugar, and no butter. It was really good topped with chopped pecans. Thanks!

My son practically lived off of this when he was 9-12 months old and still loves it at 2 years. The only change I suggest is to add the milk on its own instead of putting it with the bananas in the food processor. It really helps reduce the foaming. It's a great healthy snack for little ones and big ones - on special days, put a dollop of Nutella on top. ;)

Did not care for recipe as is.  There needs to be a lot of adjustments.  The taste was bland and the consistency was thin.  I like the idea of using quinoa, but this just didn't cut it for me.  Sorry.

I was indifferent to this recipe. The outcome wasn't a pudding consistency. It was more like warm oatmeal (but Quinoa instead of oats).. Tastes yummy with Almond extract though. :)

Simply delicious!  My almost two-year old daughter loved it!  I did however make some changes:  only half the sugar, double the butter(she is underweight but it did make the concoction nice and thick), and COCONUT MILK.  MmMMmmM Oh and I blended the cinnamon into the mix rather than sprinkle it on top for a consistent flavor.

This is really good.  I substitute canned coconut milk (Thai) and use xylitol for the sweetener.  It is a great dessert and a yummy breakfast.  I prefer my puddings cold and can hardly keep myself from sneaking in the fridge.  I have also made it before adding an egg to the final 2 minutes of cooking. Yum!

Not very pudding-y in texture- more paste-like but not really. The only changes were to use lactose free milk, three bananas, omit the sugar, add an egg and some cinnamon. Made the recipe as per the directions. It was just sweet enough from the bananas, and I was glad I'd skipped the additional sugar. My boys didn't care for it, but I thought it was okay though I won't make it again.

This is my 1st experience with Quinoa and I love it.  I used vanilla soy milk instead of whole milk, but didn't add the vanilla at the end and really liked the consistency and texture of the Quinoa.  Nice change from oatmeal in the morning.

This tastes really healthy-I made it with soy milk instead of whole milk and skipped the butter and added raisins.  I put it in single serving tupperware and grabbed it for work in the morning-its not to sweet and a good oatmeal alternative.

I'm not sure I cared for the texture. For some reason when quinoa is cooked in milk it makes it like little pebbles.  The taste of the banana was ok. My 11 year old like it.

I made this recipe dairy free due to recent food allergy testing, but it still came out nicely. If your banana is super ripe, I would add sugar (or maple syrup like I did) to taste. It does have a little bit of a banana taste to it, so if someone in your household doesn't like them I'd probably not include it. I used a combination of vanilla unsweetened oat milk and coconut creamer, and coconut oil to top it off. Actually my first time making quinoa and I'm pretty happy with it!

I really liked this and, unfortunately, I had to make two changes. I started making it and realized I only had almond milk instead of regular milk. Also, I like raisins in my rice pudding so why not?

I would suggest you give this recipe a try.

I read the lowest rated reviews and some higher ones. The recipe doesn't specify that YOU SHOULD COOK THE QUINOA UNTIL THICKENED before adding blended mixture, this doesn't necessarily happen in 15 minutes! This is a slow cook prep, but IT WILL THICKEN. 

Think of it as preparing oatmeal, add whatever makes you happy (but it doesn't taste like "dessert"!! I added dried cherries, ORANGE EXTRACT WAS AMAZING (maybe prepare quinoa with a juice instead of water as someone else suggested), cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, xylitol (sweetner), and shaved sugared almonds. 

I think next time I will use a bit of brown sugar or maple!

I was looking for a basic quinoa pudding recipe to switch out my mom favorite rice and raisins recipe.  I added cinnamon nutmeg cardamon raisins and a little brown sugar.  Used almond milk instead of regular milk; Want to try with coconut milk.

I liked it.  Added raisins and dried cranberries a touch of honey.  As did other I used soy milk instead of apple juice.  Next time would add less honey.  It was a little too sweet.

I have made this three times.  Every time I make it exactly like the recipe says and the final 5-10 minutes usually runs longer than that -closer to 15-20.  Not sure what I am doing wrong.  I top it with mango chunks and it is really delicious.  I know it says serve warm, but it is also great cold the next day.  Be advised, this makes a lot of pudding!

I loved this as a healthy dessert.   I toasted the quinoa first, then added the water a little at a time, just covering the quinoa then letting it cook down, then covering again.  This gives it a creamy nutty flavor.  I used honey instead of sugar, it worked great.  I am adding cranberries and walnuts to it tomorrow.  Can't wait to try it that way, too!

Made this for breakfast and was happy with it. I've had chia pods and this reminds me of those warmed up. I used honey instead of sugar and added egg white at the end to thicken it up (as suggested by other reviewers).

Reminiscent of tapioca pudding.  Taste is good, but needs eggs to give it a more pudding-like consistency.  Would make a great breakfast dish with less sugar and fresh berries.

Very bland and thin, and the banana is overpowering. I added some spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove), as well as some golden raisins, and while this improved the flavor somewhat, the recipe was still bland and not at all creamy.

Have to say that I was a bit skeptical trying this..but I gave it a try…and was quite impressed.  I only had one very ripe banana, used 2% milk, brown sugar and added Craisins.  Skipped the butter and vanilla at the end as it really did not need it.  It did thicken up a tad when cooked for a full 10 mins but is on the thinner side. I would think if you want it a bit thicker, try decreasing the amount of milk added. This recipe is a good base to start with and add varied flavorings and add ins to your taste or for what you have on hand. I did soak the quinoa for 15 mins and gave a good rinse until clear…does make a difference.  Great as left overs too.  Awesome.  Thanks for sharing Lynda Q.

When I looked at the recipe, 2 cups of milk looked like way too much liquid, but I followed it because it has so many good reviews. However it turned out like soup and we didn't like the flavour at all. I love quinoa but just not this recipe. Glad others found it good though!

I just made this today and love it.   I used a whole banana (because it needed to be used) 2% milk and brown sugar and also added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg.   I'm enjoying it now as I type this review.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Better than the other quinoa recipe (for pilaf) we tried tonight, but it wasn't fabulous... We'll have to see how it turns out tomorrow when we reheat it for breakfast.

This was a very easy recipe, although the consistency wasn't quite a pudding, I did not mind at all.In the end, the flavour of vanilla meeting the quinoa tasted very much like a banana bread smoothie. A healthy, easy, and DELICIOUS breakfast aswell as desert idea. Kids love it too.

I made this pudding last night and it is really, really good.  I added cinnamon and that was the necessary topper to make it awesome! I'm interested in trying one of the other reviewers suggestions using coconut milk! Yum!
