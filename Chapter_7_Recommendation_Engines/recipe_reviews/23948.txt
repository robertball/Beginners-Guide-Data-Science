IT STINKS.  IT IS TOO RUNNY AND YOU CAN'T TASTE THE AVACADO.  NO WONDER PEOPLE LIKE IT WHO DON'T LIKE AVACADOS, YOU CAN'T TASTE ANY.  
TOO MUCH SOUR CREAM AND WAY TOO MUCH SALSA, I AM UPSET I WASTED TWO AVACADOS!

I have always made guacamole for snacking but with the family over for Thanksgiving, I decided to try this as an appetizer.  Well, goodbye guac cause this just kicked!!  I loved this so much as did my family, even 80 year old Dad.  Served with those new scoop style tortilla chips, there was none left!  Thank you, Holly and thank you, Christy! :D

YAAAAAAAYYYYY!  Avacado dip that doesn't have a ton of onions!!  We LOVED this dip--and its so easy and tastes like its not.  I'm lactose intolerant so we substituted tofu sour cream and you can't tell its not the real thing.  I like it because you can control the spice through your salsa.  I left it chunky--just barely mashing it.  THANKS SOOOO MUCH--I've been looking for a recipe like this for years.  :)

Very good recipe.  Easy too make!  I wasn't sure how the salse was going to taste in it, but it was great!  Next time i may only add 1/2 cup of salsa to get more of the avocado taste.  Thanks a lot!

I made this recipe for the 4th of July for a few friends and my husband (who isn't a big avocado fan)and everyone loved it and wanted to know what was in it!  [It's very addicting too; you can't stop at just a little.]  I added a little more garlic powder, cumin and black pepper and used a chunky medium-spiced salsa and it had a great kick to it (but not too much).  I'm definately adding this to my party must haves!

Considering I don't particularly care for guacamole, this was pretty darn good! I did end up adding hot sauce to the recipe, but all in all, I'd definately make it again
Thanks

Some say too runny and some suggest they could not taste the avocado? One can use 1/2 cup mild salsa and drain the liquid before mixing. You can reduce the sour cream to 1/2 cup, also. The cumin tends to reduce the taste of the avocado.. so reduce this as well.

Great REecipie-- better then the cream cheese recipe!    I used 3 avocados,  2 very ripe tomatoes instead of the salsa.  Added chalula w/ lime hot sauce for xtra zest.  Turned out great!  Going in my recipe box!

We loved this recipe. It's easy and delicious.  I added the juice of 1 lime.  That helped with the darkening and added a nice zing to the dip.

This recipe was very good but a little too salsa-like. Next time I make this I'm going to use less sals and more avocado.

I absolutely loved this recipe and so did everyone I made it for.  I did reduce both the salsa and sour cream down to half a cup each just so more of the avocado taste would come through.  Highly recommended!

Fabulous recipe, first bowl to empty at a party and I have memorized the recipe as I am always giving it to friends!  Cumin is the secret ingredient...  I use a little extra garlic powder and chunky HOT salsa... if you don't want it to turn brown, place saran wrap directly on top of the dip's surface and refridgerate.

This recipe was very bad!  Maybe I did something wrong with the avocado, but it didn't play well in the dip.

I LOVE this recipe. It's very quick & the taste is great. When I was mixing all the ingredients together I didn't think it would taste right. But I made if for a b-day party & it was gone in no time. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

I replaced the cumin with cajun and added just a little bit of sea salt. I left out the garlic powder...didnt have it... it turned out pretty good. I have never had avocado before and i liked it.

This is delicious, although it looks somewhat less than appetizing. I was tempted to throw in some lemon juice to keep the avocado from turned brownish and darkening the dip, but was afraid it would alter the taste, which was perfect when made as directed.

Very good recipe to start from! I also love avocado so I decreased the amount of sour cream and salsa to 1/4 cup each. I also decreased the cumin and salt to 1/4 tsp and used onion powder instead of garlic powder (just because that is what I had on hand.) Turned out delicious! This is definitely one of those go quick dips. I will make this again for sure!

Made this for the 4th of July and it was gone before the food made it off the BBQ.  I made it with 3 avacados and it made a really large bowl.  Huge hit.

Quick and tasty recipe made from ingredients I usually have on-hand. I added some green onions and black olives, and stirred in about 1/4 cup of shredded cheese.

This was easy and good. Like a few other reviewers, I like more avocado, so I used 1/2C of sour cream and 1/2C salsa. It was very good. Next time will add a little hot sauce. Pretty tasty.

I have now made this dip about 5 times and always get asked for the recipe. This is perfect it you like a blend of sour cream & avacado. I never make any other kind of guacamole. I will say the appearance isn't the prettiest but who cares if it tastes great!!! Thank you for the recipe!

I ended up using 3 avocados since mine were on the small side. I also used homemade salsa to add to it.  I couldn't find my potato masher so I ended up using my food processor.  I blended everything until it was pretty creamy then I diced the 3rd avocado and added that for texture.  I garnished with diced tomatoes.  I used it as a dip and for chicken quesadillas.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I really enjoy creamy guacamole and this is perfect.  My husband just loved it but the kids wouldn't touch it (green food issues).  My dip started out runny when I made it but after 30 minutes of being in the fridge fixed that just fine.  Thanks for such a nice and simple recipe!  Will use it again and again!

This really is quick, easy and delicious. The first time I made it, it was rather runny. So, the second time, I strained the salsa ( I use the fresh kind sold in the supermarket)and the consistency was pefect. Everyone was asking for the recipe.Thanks for sharing!

Incorporated previous review to use a chunky salsa, this tasted great, but like others have mentioned is not soo attractive.  I added some lemon juice to see if it would keep the avocados from oxidizing and turning brown, but alas that dip looked brown anyway.  Oh well, a yummy snack at home, but nothing I would bring to a pot luck.

This had a great flavor overall but was way too thin textured for my liking so I ended up doubling the avocado in this. I used some restaurant salsa that I had leftover from take out. My husband wasn't impressed, but said it was okay. My only real compliant was that I wanted it a lot thicker and more avocado-ey. I'd use this recipe again with modifications such as a third of the salsa and a third of the sour cream and double the avocado and a splash of lime juice too. Thanks I really enjoyed this dip once I tinkered around with it. Sorry as it was it was too thin, runny, and not enough avocado.

Thank you for an inspirational recipe. I have been wanting to make a really good guacamole dip, I came upon your recipe, the sour cream was the key. Using that with other basic ingredients made a reaaly nice dip.

I served this recipe last year and am serving it up for this Christmas and New Year's Parties. It is, hands down, the very best Avocado Dip I've ever had!!! I did not think many would eat it...BUT...I am not lying when I tell you it was the very first bowl to empty! So, I'm doubling up on it this year! Thank you and your friend, Christy, for sharing this wonderful piece of heaven with us!

The  avocados get lost in all the other stuff..If you like the taste of fresh avocados, this recipe is not for you.  I was not impressed with this recipe and will not make it again.  But then again, I love fresh peeled avocados with nothing on them(it did get better after sitting in refrigerator awhile).  There are some very good guacamole recipes in Allrecipes.  Just look for them.

Yummmmmmmmm!  I used 4 avocados and chunky lime salsa.  It turned brown after a while, but still tasted great.  I hear if you leave the avocado pit in the guac, it won't turn brown.  I'll have to try that next time, because I'm definitely making this one again!

I've made this twice in one week, because my family demolished it. It's delicious. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, and the second time, I left out the cumin (as it had too strong of a flavor for my taste last time) and added lime juice. Even more perfect. Will be making this many more times in the future. :)

If you're looking for a simple avocado dip or the base for more adventurous dips and spreads, this is it.  I left out the salsa with the intent of adding either salsa or veggies when I serve it.  Used red cayenne pepper instead of cumin and added some lemon juice to stop the avocado from browning.

Very good.  I still prefer guacamole but as the other reviewers said, this is a good recipe for those that aren't crazy about avocados.  I recommend adding the salt to taste as 1/2 teaspoon left mine a bit too salty.  I used the dip as a sandwich spread for a tex-mex style panini.

I am giving this a 5 because of the ease in making it and the popularity with my guests. Everyone liked it. I  will definitely make it again.
