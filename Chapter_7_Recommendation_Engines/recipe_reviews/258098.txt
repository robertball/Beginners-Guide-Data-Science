These took about 30 minutes to bake. Maybe it was because my apple slices were a bit too thick. I topped them off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and they are in a way reminiscent of apple pie.

It was good. It was mostly biscuit. The apple and the cheese were surprisingly good together. If I ever make this again I would add more apples to it.

I made this today and was pleased with the flavor. Quick because they use refrigerated biscuits. I cut my apple wrong -- I cored it with the kitchen corer before I realized that I wanted slices the other way. But I went ahead and slided the apple slices thin. I also put the flour/cinnamon/sugar mixture on the top of the biscuits and sprinkled on top. Dotted with butter.
