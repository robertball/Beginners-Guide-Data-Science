This smoothed the jagged edge off a particularly rough week and restored a sense of general benevolence. Now if only it counted towards my goal of five fruit and veg per day. *Sigh*

This is a great cocktail. For these, I usually make individual servings of simple syrup: a 1/2 teaspoon or so of sugar in each glass plus a tablespoon of warm/hot water, stirred until the sugar dissolves.

Okay. So, I searched my Fred Meyer looking for pear nectar. Found everything BUT. I ended up picking up peach nectar instead.

I made the simple syrup myself.

Just with the peach/pear mixture, this is POTENT. And really has a bite. I know it's not exactly the same and I sure tried to find pear nectar. (If anyone knows, please let me know where you got it.)

Really took the edge off my day.

This is a truly *delicious* cocktail.  I highly recommend using a good Pear Brandy though.  A cheaper brand will have a "fake" pear flavor.  I used Clear Creek Pear Brandy -- super smooth.  I served with a cheese/bread/fruit platter and every last drop was enjoyed.

Truly perfect for a Thanksgiving day cocktail. I'd found Asian Pear Cider at the farmer's market and used it for the pear nectar.

Love pears. Was really looking forward to the wonderful pear taste this drink promised. We didn't think it delivered. Won't be making this again.
