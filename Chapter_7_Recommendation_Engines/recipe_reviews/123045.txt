PLEASE READ THIS: You are such a lifesaver. I couldn't find another truffle recipe that looked good enough to try. But then I come over to this. This 3 hours left till the party I finally find this recipe and I went to the party and came back with orders to make these. FOR MONEY!!! HAHAHAHA! Okay I'm like 13 years old so Money is a HUGE deal hahaha! Some of my friends couldn't have  pecans, nuts or almonds. So What I used to make it look purtyyy was mini chocolate chips. Another thing that I changed about the recipie was using milk chocolate and vanilla extract. They still melted in your mouth and they still tasted amazing! I'm so making these for Christmas! THESE WERE AWESOME!!!

Such a great easy recipe! Just as good as the ones that take all day to coat with chocolate, but they came together in just a few minutes. I made them yesterday and they seem to be holding up just fine at room temp. I tried them with pecans, coconut, and crushed candy canes (I recommend the candy canes, there's something about chocolate and peppermint). I only had bittersweet chocolate, so I added about 1/3 cup powdered sugar to each batch. Still came out perfect.

This is just as advertised! Smooth, creamy, easy to prepare, and everyone just kept sneaking them off the tray. I substituted a bit of vanilla and rum extract for the almond extract. I'm about to try using white chocolate, and mint chocolate chips. This is essentially a solid genache, so could be used as a truffle center as well.

Wow, these are wonderful. I love cherries and did a slight twist - I added 1/8 cup of chopped maraschino cherries, changed the pecans to almonds, changed the semi-sweet chocolate to white chocolate and changed the almond extract to cherry brandy. Absolutely great. I will be trying them again for a company food swap. I am going to try milk chocolate next. I imagine these would be delicious with crushed candy canes and mint extract too!

So easy!  So great!  I'm always a hero when I bring these to a party.  Sometimes I add vanilla.  The last time I added Frangelico and Kahlua and left out some of the cream.  Delicious!  I couldn't find truffle cups for my last batch and didn't have time to run out to the gourmet shop so I made them on a cookie sheet and sliced it just before it was too stiff and cracked.  When it set up I was able to break off the small squares.  Thanks!

Awesome fast recipe for truffles! I usually make them the old fashion way, with waiting till set, then forming into nalls and dipping into various toppings such as melted chocolate(white, milk, dark...)then into sprinkles, nuts...etc. However, I was in a real hurry this time, and really needed to make something quick, whithout too much fuss or mess. This recipe was perfect! I used thinly sliced almonds, because we have someone in the family with nut alergies(but not to almonds!). I followed the rest exactly. Scooped into mini muffin liners with a small icce cream scoop. No mess whatsoever! They barely took 10 to 15 mins in the fridge and the were perfectly set. picked them up easily and placed into a nice tin box to take to my parents house. They were such a hit! Melt in your mouth goodness! thanks so much for this lifesaver!

This was a great recipe for my first time trying truffles. I actually used a double boiler instead of the microwave, but used the same proportions. It definitely needed time to set in the cups...after 1.5 hours in the fridge, the consistency was still fudge-like. Next time I would probably refrigerate the whole batter then scoop out truffle balls instead of using the cups. I substituted hazelnuts and a lot of Frangelico. They were a hit.

These are fabulous. I used milk chocolate and vanilla extract.  I put a layer of chocolate and then a 1/2 teaspoon of carmel ice cream topping in the middle and then more chocolate and topped it with a whole cashew. They were gone in 5 minutes!

I think if I would have used milk chocolate chips i could have gave this 5 stars. Plus maybe think of something else but nuts to line the paper cups. To use the whole bag of chocolate chips I indreased the proportions an it made 30 truffles.
  1/2c pecans, 12 oz of chips, 1/4c + 2T  butter, 1/4c + 2T whipping cream. 2 teaspoons almond extract.

I bought what I thought were mini muffin cups but they probably weren't quite mini enough. They didn't fit into the cups on my mini muffin pan which wasn't really a problem, but I was only able to make 12 cups instead of 24. And they ended up a little thinner than I would like but they still taste good. Next time I'll try to make sure I'm getting the really mini muffin cups.

Super easy to make and delicious too! I tried one batch as written and one batch substituting walnuts for pecans (mixing right in with the chocolate), not putting the almond extract in, and using a mould. Great both ways!

My granddaughter and I made these as a gift for her father.  We used Ghiradelli 60% bittersweet chocolate.  They were so easy to make and they were gone in no time.

Amazing little bundles of Heaven! Super-easy and soooo creamy! I will make again and again!! I'm anxious to try new variations! My variations I made for this recipe are: substituted walnuts for pecans and used half-and-half instead of cream. Quick, delicious...I'm excited to share this recipe with others!!

This recipe is amazing!  I constantly make it for parties and people love how they melt in your mouth.  Absolutely perfect recipe, the only problem I found was that they got a little messy after a while, but that's not that big of a deal. :)
