Excellent! You could taste every spice and had just alittle bite which, to me, was perfect! I added 1/2 c more tomato and a tad more brown sugar to extend the sauce as I like a lot. I made the full recipe for 2 lamb shanks and used the leftover sauce on chicken. YUM! Best I have had!!

Hands down the best Lamb Vindaloo we have eaten! I cooked two lamb shanks for hubbie and I yet kept all the other ingredients the same as we like it saucey. When I reached for the tamarind in the refrigerator, I couldn't find it. I ran to the Buzz for substitution ideas. It was suggested that I use molasses and lemon juice. So I added 1 tbsp. molasses and 1 tsp. lemon juice. When putting the lemon juice back in the fridge, I saw the tamarind on the door! I went ahead and added it too. Just a little comic relief! Served with brown basmati rice, spinach paneer and garlic naan. Fabulous! Thanks Chef John!

Thank you, Chef John!  These are probably the best lamb shanks we've ever made and eaten.  A bit labor intensive, but worth every minute.  My guy has an onion allergy, so we made this sans onion, but with a bit more garlic than the recipe calls, other than that followed the recipe exactly.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thank you again!

This was delicious.  Oven searing the lamb shanks is a nice way to go because they are such an awkward shape to pan fry.  Similarly, the blender method means that you can get a smooth sauce without finely chopping anything!  The texture of the finished product was excellent - tender and juicy but firm meat in a great deeply flavored sauce.  I added half of the cayenne originally and then continued tasting and adding more towards the end to make sure I got the hot I liked.  I also added a smidgen of brown sugar to lessen the harshness of the sauce.   This is a great company dish because you can do all the prep and shove it in the oven hours before dinner.  I served it with a simple roast veggie medley, also prepared ahead of time and shoved in the oven 30 min before dinner (while the sauce thickened on the stove top.) and basmati rice with a touch of chicken bouillon and saffron.  It’s a great gourmet dinner with little fuss when your company is there!

What a taste explosion! Before starting the meal, realize that it is time consuming. My wife does not understand why I make meals that are so involved but...this was well worth the effort.

I tried this recipe today loved it!  I have tried this meal at Indian restaurants before and had tried to make it based on my taste bud memories but it didn't come out the same as this recipe and that is because I was missing some of the major ingredients it was given in this recipe.  I love spicy foods and this food is definitely one of them!

This dish was delicious and well worth the time invested. My husband loved this spicy lamb which I served with white rice and a green salad. I'll be making this again.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent! The second time I made it, I was looking for something a little lighter, so I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of the the lamb shanks and adjusted the cooking times down. It was really good this way too. I am looking forward to adapting this vindaloo sauce to use with other proteins in the future.

This is a great recipe, and I had never cooked lamb before!! Did it for me and my husband and used just two lamb shanks and kept the measurement of everything else the same to have twice the sauce.

I've been trying to recreate the Lamb Vindaloo I get from my favorite Indian restaurant for years and this recipe  proved to be a great starting point.   Every place I  have ordered it has prepared the dish with potatoes and lamb so I added potatoes.  Also, I added one tsp of Cardamom to the spice mix.  Then I adapted the cooking process for a pressure cooker rather than stove top.  So. . .

1) Follow the original recipe to step 7, adding one tsp of Cardamom and an extra 1/2 tsp of Cayenne (I like it hot).

2) Instead of adding the lamb shanks to the pot, transfer everything to the pressure cooker and then add the lamb.

3)  Set pressure cooker  to "Meat, High" and cook for 1 1/2 hours.

4) Release pressure and add six medium red potatoes cut in eighths.  Cook for an additional 30 min.

5) Remove main components and transfer sauce to original stove top pot.  Reduce sauce on med-high to desired thickness, stirring frequently.  

6) Serve with Basmati rice.

Want to add  an appetizer and bread?

7) While the pressure cooker is doing it's magic,   prepare frozen Onion Kultcha from your favorite Indian Grocery per directions.  

8) Prepare Udad Papad   from your favorite Indian Grocery by placing on a cookie sheet, spraying with cooking spray, and broiling for 45-60 seconds.  Serve with a mixture of Swad Bombay Sandwich Spread and Indian Yogurt  (also  from your favorite Indian Grocery) mixed one to two)

This resulted in the best Indian meal I have ever made! But I like it hot,

Not difficult but definitely plan ahead and don’t plan on leaving the house all afternoon. Marinating overnight softens the meat too. I used lamb shank steaks since that was on sale. The aroma of the onion is intoxicating so it’s not a bad thing your hair will smell like it. I put it in the oven at 250F instead of stove top for 3hrs. The tamarind paste took some digging but found it at Wegmans hidden in the Asian isle. Everything else you should be able to find at a half way decent grocery store.  Garam masala is also much cheaper in the Asian isle or at an Asian store vs some place like Williams Sonoma.

Chef John, another great recipe.  A fair amount of work but well worth the effort.  My wife does not like lamb and I shy away from any type of vindaloo but I decided to give this one a lash.  Found American lamb shanks in our local store recently instead of the imported lamb usually available.   It did have a milder lamb taste and my wife hesitantly tried it.  She raved about the meal.  It was spicy hot but not overpowering.  Could not find tamarind concentrate locally so I substituted a good quality Worcestershire Sauce as it contains tamarind.   I did cook a couple of chicken thighs separately in some of the sauce as a backup plan.  The chicken was also excellent but will be a meal for another day as we stuck with the lamb.  Very happy I made this recipe.  My wife has already invited the neighbors over so I will be cooking it again soon.  Thanks again.

I love this recipe. I've been making it with 1 lb chicken, instead of lamb. After the first time making it with chicken, I found the cider vinegar flavor to be a bit too strong. To compensate the next time, I used 1/4 cup cider vinegar and 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 cup wider vinegar. The flavor came out perfect!

Lots of exposure to Indian food at our house but this was so spicy that we had to do a major  intervention! Added a cup of peanut butter and some sugar.  Served with sour cream to mix in...was very good albeit still a bit too spicy.
Definitely worth another try so next  time will leave out the cayenne until the end....and keep the peanut butter, sugar and sour cream available!!!
