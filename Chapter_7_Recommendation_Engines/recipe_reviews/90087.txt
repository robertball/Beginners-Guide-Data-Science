Oh how I wanted to love you Cilantro Chicken Salad!  As a cilantro fan, I thought this would be the best chix salad of my life.  Unfortunately, I found that the poaching process didn't add additional flavor to the chicken, but alas, the cilantro addition was too overwhelming.  I tried in a salad, plain and in a sandwich and although as a part of a lettuce salad was the most palatable, it was a disappointment overall.

This was fantastic.  I was a little skeptical at first but was thrilled with the results.  I served mine over warm jasmine rice.  I will definitely be making this again.

Great, non-mayo, chicken salad.  My husband thinks this is the best chicken salad ever (he does not like mayo).  I've made it several times to have for lunch with weekend visitors and we just took it to an evening, outdoor concert.  Followed the recipe as-is (did not use anchovy).  Lots of flavor from the cilantro, garlic and shallots, but not too much.  It is great.

I was looking for a light chicken salad without mayo, and this satisfied.  It was delicious tossed with spinach and shredded carrots.  I only shredded two chicken breasts into the lime mixture; next time I'd double the dressing if using all four chicken breasts.  Added a splash of rice vinegar to the lime juice.  To improve even more, I'd add a dash of sesame oil to give it a bit more Asian flavor, and perhaps a bit of minced green onion.  Nonetheless excellent, and a wonderful base for ideas.

This recipe was very good.  I was a bit worried about it being too overpowering, but it wasn't.  The shallots and the cilantro go well together.  Others mentioned that cooking the chicken in the soy sauce/lime mixture was for naught, so I saved 2 tablespoons of that mixture and mixed it in with the shredded chicken to make sure I had some of that flavor still.  I also added a large handful of shredded parmesan cheese and we ate this on pitas with a slice of swiss cheese.  It was very good.  Will definitely make this again.

We really enjoyed this. The flavors are very light and refreshing. This would be a perfect summer supper salad. I ate it over fresh baby greens. The teenagers mixed it into some stir-fried sesame rice noodles, as well as ate it over the fresh greens.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Didn't use the anchovy paste but I just don't like anchovies. I added chopped fresh mushrooms and red peppers to the broth mixture and then put the cooked down pieces in the salad with the other ingredients. It was absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this dish again.

WOW! ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!! My entire family liked it! I served it on a tomato basil tortilla wrap with some tomato and avocado, like one review suggested. The chicken was moist and shredded nicely and we used fat free chicken broth. We estimated this at 7 or 8 Weight Watchers points for 1 wrap. Will definitely make again. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!!!

GOOD GOOD GOOD...I had left over chicken from a previous recipe (unbelievable chicken) so I used those pieces to make this salad. I love cilantro so I added a little more than it calls for. I didn't have the anchovy paste so left it out. GREAT chix salad. Will definitely store in my "do again" recipes.

This was pretty simple and quick to make.  It looked a little bland and lifeless, but the taste was anything but!  It had nice flavor and didn't make you feel heavy and full.  I will be making this one again!

Excellent! Great summertime dinner. Chicken was moist and light. I served with slices of tomato and avacado and jersey lettuce on tortillas. WONDERFUL! Thanks

A light, summery recipe.  I didn't pay attention to the directions and put the lime zest into the salad, but it tasted great.

This is not too bad, but I find that the ingredients in which the chicken was cooked (chicken broth etc.) were pretty much wasted; that process did nothing for the chicken.  If I try this again, I will use those initial ingredients as a marinade.  The rest of the salad was pretty good; I served it over fresh spinach and Jasmine rice.  My sons and husband liked it more than I.

Made some changes after reading the reviews. I marinated the chicken in soy sauce and chicken broth, and we grilled the chicken at a very high temperature to make it just a little crisp, but still tender on the inside. I mixed the rest of the ingredients as a dressing and served the chicken strips over a green salad. It was fabulous!

This was somewhat edible. 

I love lime, cilantro, garlic, and chicken salad.  

I ended up making just a little bit of this and trying it before I added the dressing to all of my chicken (i was a bit skeptical- thankfully!). It just wasn't good. 

I used the rest of the chicken for regular chicken salad (with mayo)

The addition of pine nuts made it even more delicious.  It made a good filling for lettuce wraps.

Very flavorful recipe. I used leftover chicken and reheated it in the sauce like it called for and then just followed the recipe the rest of the way. I served it over sliced, slightly seasoned avocado and it was wonderful.

This was so great!  Loved the really strong flavors of garlic, cilantro and anchovies! I used anchovy filets instead of the paste, as that is what I had on hand. Delicious with a bean/rice salad, and would be good in wraps-- our new fave!

I have served this salad as my filling for lettuce wraps and tortilla wraps at parties and it is always a hit.  I've given out this recipe many times!
