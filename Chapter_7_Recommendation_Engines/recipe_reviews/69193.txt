this recipe is worth 5 stars because it can be modified to taste well.  it is too dry on its own, and i recommend adding another can of soup or additional milk/sour cream.  i also changed the vegetables - i included brocolli, peas, and mushrooms; and spices - italian seasoning with garlic/onion.  this is also the perfect recipe to use with whole wheat pasta - as you can't taste the pasta.  very easy to modify.

This dish was terrific.  Instead of the chicken tenderloins, I just used  leftover roasted chicken that I had in the fridge.  I also added a bit of milk and sour cream on top of the mixture once it was in the baking dish.  I spread it on sort of like a frosting, before adding the bread crumbs.  I also splashed a bit more milk around the edges just to liquify it a little more.  It turned out perfect!  My whole household said that I should make this again.  It was a hit!

I really liked this recipe and will be making it again. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup because it was all I had and it turned out very good. I was in a huge rush when I chose this recipe however (a hungry 2 year old yanking at my leg) so I didn't read the reviews till after. Next time the change I'll be making is adding some milk because it was a tad dry. Not terrible but it did seem to need a bit of milk. I used some alphabet shaped whole wheat pasta to make it kid friendly and my 2 year old gobbled it right up happily! Definitely recommend this recipe, it was quick and easy and uses basic staple foods.

I used two cups of pasta and cut the soup down to one can.  I think the recipe would be way too soupy as written.  I was out of bread crumbs, so I just topped the casserole with parmesan.  It came out pretty good and is a nice, easy, one-pot meal for nights when you don't really feel like cooking.

I had some leftover baked chicken which tasted terrible.  Thanks for this recipe; it turned nasty into tasty!  I used cream of chicken soup with 8oz plain yogurt and about 1/3 C milk, (instead of an additional can of soup) and organic seasoning blend with garlic pepper for seasonings also mostaccioli instead of fusilli.  A Delicious adaptable casserole!!

My husband really enjoyed this dish...I thought it was okay.  I had to make a few substitutions based on the ingredients I had at the time: I used bowtie pasta, I used only cream of chicken soup, and I added some milk like some of the other reviews suggested.  It had alot of flavor and was not dry at all.  I'm just not sure that I would ever make it again.

I was looking for comfort food casserole and this is exactly what I was looking for.  My husband ended up making this recipe because I was too sick to cook.  The only thing both he and I decided was that the bread crumbs don't really work because they just get soggy, especially when reheating leftovers.  We suggest using grated mozza cheese and letting it brown and bubble in the oven.  Good flavors.

I love this recipe!  I was frantically looking for something to cook last night, when I found this one.  Of course, I substituted what I had on hand:  cream of celery instead of chicken/ mushroom, and 1/2 packet dry leek soup mix instead of all the herbs.  I added about 6 oz sharp cheddar cheese.  It came out fantastic!  Perfect comfort food.

I added a few more spices, Italian , thyme and poultry seasoning. I also added about 1/4 cup of half and half.  This was a DELICIOUS. My wife fell in love with it. Great Recipe.

This recipe was a big hit at dinner! I whisked the cream soup together with half a can of vegetable broth to give it extra moisture. I also added marjoram and pearl onions to the mix. Very tasty - glad I found this recipe!

Used a little more pasta than the recipe called for and I prefer crackers on top to the bread crumbs.  Otherwise a tasty, warm hot dish.

This recipe was really good.  I added about a half cup of chicken broth to the mixture before baking and the consistency turned out great.  I would definitely recommend adding grated cheese on top  - cheddar was great - for a little extra flavor.

I love this recipe!  I've made it multiple times and it always goes over well!  I do add more pasta than the recipe calls for, and always make a vegetarian version for the vegetarian in our house.

I think it turned out great. I followed the recipe as is and it was great. The breading mixture on top added the perfect amount of crunch to it. Will be making again.

I tweaked this as per other reviews suggested- seasoned chicken with whatever I had (cut into chunks); used over 2 cups of pasta (penne); used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup only; added a can & a half of skim milk; added several spoons of fat free sour cream; added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese that I had on hand; and used 4 tbs of butter + enough bread crumbs & parmesan cheese (kraft sprinkles, not grated) to coat the entire dish. It all fit in a 9x13 pyrex.

Came out delicious. I suggest you tweak it with whatever you have on hand- worked for me!

I think it needs to be creamier and punched up with a little heat; like adding curry to the chicken.  It is, however, an easy way for the kids to enjoy their vegetables.

This is easy & easy to adapt to your own preferences. Very filling & tasty, great for a weeknight dinner. I added some milk to thin it a bit, used just cream of mushroom soup, & added some dry mustard,  peas & carrots. Will definately be making this again.

Made this recipe tonight, it was wonderful and super easy.  Based on the previous reviews I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. I also added 1/2 cup milk and a can of sliced mushrooms. I did not use the bread crumbs or Parmesan cheese nor any kind of topping, it was good enough without it.  From my 18 month old granddaughter to my husband, all loved it. Will make again many more times.

I used an entire box of whole grain pasta. Even though it was more than a cup of pasta I still used only the 2 cans of soup. To make up the difference I used about 1 1/2 cups of fat free sour cream I had that needed using and a splash of milk. I used just peas, carrots and corn for the veggies. I also used a little bit of pepper flakes along with the other spices and added about 1/2 of a cup of parmesan in with the soups. It wasn't my favorite recipe ever but the kids each had 3 helpings and so did my mom who generally doesn't like pasta. So over all I would say it was a success.

Delish!  I used elbow macaroni, cause that's what I had on hand and I added about 1/2 cup diced yellow peppers, 1/4 cup diced onions, minced garlic, chix soup, celery soup, about 1/2 cup milk, can mixed veggies (would have used broccoli, if I'd had it), covered with foil and baked about 45 min.  It was a little soupy so I added little mozz cheese on top and toped that with ritz crackers/parm/butter mixture and baked about 10 more minutes, uncovered.  My hubby loved it and wants the leftovers again tonight.

This is a quick easy recipe and mine was not dry at all! Instead I used 2 cups pasta, 1 can of condensed soup, a dollop of sour cream, and drizzled milk around the edges half-way through baking. Also crumbled potato chips on top are delicious!

I recently made this and it was very good! Not amazing, but definitely tasty and not hard to make.  I made the following substitutions: 2 cans cream of chicken instead of one mushroom and one chicken, 2 cups pasta instead of one, 1 cup mixed veggies instead of two, and I didn't make the topping of cheese/butter/breadcrumbs.  The casserole was not too soupy. It was definitely moist though! Without the topping a few of the noodles on top got a little tough but the rest was good.   I cooked it in a 9x9 dish. If you make the recipe as stated it's too small for a 9x13.

I made this exactly and I had no problems!  The only thing I did differently,  was broiled the top til brown and baked for maybe 5 minutes.  It was not dry as others had stated! It was really good.

The dish was just ok. On the plus side it was easy to make but the meal itself just didn't do it for me.

Just used a whole bag of frozen veggies (about 3 cups) and doubled the pasta. I think next time, I'd throw in one more can of cream of mushroom too. Overall everyone like it. In our convection oven I found it only took 15 minutes to be ready.

This was ok. Decent. Not the greatest but not the worst. I added a 1/4 cup milk because it seemed dry when I mixed all the ingredients. I used fresh potatoes and carrots cubed (and boiled first) instead of frozen veg and vegetable spiral noodles. I added fresh garlic instead of powder. I believe my additions made this better than it would have been. Also the soup base tastes much better with one can mushroom soup and one can cream of cheese vs the cream of chicken.

After all the rave reviews I was expecting more. I agree with other reviewers that a bit of milk or broth would make the sauce creamier. This was actually better left over than the day I made it. The recipe does not tell you to cook the vegetables but I recommend doing so. I had to add additional seasoning at the table to make it edible. I used some garlic salt and some Meijer salt free all purpose seasoning.

Yummy! Added 1 cup motzerella cheese to the main part. Added 1 cup Parmesan cheese to topping. Should have added 3/4 - 1 cup  milk and 4 chicken breasts instead of 2. Also added 1 1/2 cup pasta instead of 1.

Delicious! I don't ever change a recipe, but in this case I had to use what I had on hand: leftover rotisserie chicken, a jar of Alfredo sauce, a can of Cream of Mushroom, elbow macaroni and no veggies.  It was excellent! Not dry at all and very tasty...a keeper. Next time I plan on using some veggies though. Thank you for sharing this simple and delicious recipe :)

This recipe was really good, I made changes though. 
I oven baked the chicken breasts with seasonings, so they didn't get dry in the frying pan. For the vegetables I used fresh broccoli and fresh zucchini, white onion chopped finely. 
I chopped the cooked chicken in smaller pieces and added it to the frying pan with the oil. I added the white onions, zucchini and broccoli. I cooked those for a few minutes, seasoned as it was needed. 
I stired in only one can of mushroom soup and mixed it well. Added the cooked pasta, mixed again. I added 1/4 cup milk to thin it out so it isn't so dry. 
I used panko bread crumbs and parmesan cheese mixed with melted butter and put on top. Baked at 425 for about 20 minurea, delicious. I would make it again :)

This will now be called Chicken Pot Pasta in my house.  You're welcome.  This was easy, really good, and my three year old went to town on it.  Hooray!  I switched the cream of chicken (not a fan) for a second mushroom as indicated by others, added a little Szeged Chicken rub in lieu of salt and pepper, and probably used extra veggies, but pretty much verbatim.  Great stuff!

I don't know why my casserole turned out so tasteless, but unlike other reviewers, it didn't taste like anything more than cream soup and noodles. I did use 1 can of milk based on so many reviewers' suggestions, chicken breast instead of tenderloins, and used fresh onion and garlic instead of the dried onion and garlic salt. Other than those changes, I followed it to a T. Those changes I made should have only increased the flavor, yet it didn't.

There's a lot of leftovers, so I added some sour cream and can only hope that maybe it gets better after the flavors meld overnight, and the sour cream helps a little. Sorry, but something went wrong, or it's just not the dish for us.

After reading other reviews, I added probably a cup or cup and a half of organic cream to the casserole.  Unfortunately I did not have mixed vegies on hand but got by just fine with broccoli.  Also, I cut up a whole chicken (again because that is what was on hand) instead of just the chicken breasts. I made this for a crew of men that I feed everyday, and they thought it was great.

I followed the instructions but with some changes. I used 2 1/2 cups fusili tri-colored pasta, 4 chicken breasts cubed, 2 cups frozen mixed veggies (peas, corn, carrots), 2 cans cream of chicken, fresh minced garlic, and panko bread crumbs, no butter. Halfway through baking, I added the half cup of milk other reviewers suggested to keep it moist.

It came out creamy and delicious. The husband thought it was great. No complaints except for what I would change for myself. The amount of chicken I used was a lot in proportion to the pasta/veggies. I'll use 3 breasts next time. And I'll use fresh veggies of my choice instead of frozen, mixed. I also forgot to add salt. It needed a bit of salt.

I loved this recipe! My family went back for seconds even thirds.  While cooking my chicken I add a splash of Marsala wine and some Greek seasoning, it was amazing. Mastacoli for the pasta was perfect match.

4.5 : )   Hate canned and frozen vegetables and only use them as a last resort.  Also used 3 chicken breasts.  Added broccoli and cauliflower florets to the pasta in the last few minutes of cooking and nuked a bunch of fresh mushrooms, drained them.   Also sauted some fresh onion and garlic and increased the topping a bit, YUMMY!!!  Otherwise, everything the same other than a bit more pasta.

I made this for my grandkids and they loved it so much they went back for seconds. I did make a few changes. I used 8 oz pasta, used fresh onions - sautéed. I placed the chicken in just enough water to cover, sprinkled with garlic powder, salt and pepper and cooked until just done (approx 5 min) I removed chicken to cool (reserving broth)before cutting into bite size pieces. I combined the ingredients plus a cup of sour cream along with soups and used Italian seasoning instead of basil and parsley. I used broth as needed to make sure pasta mixture was good and moist. It was so good. We liked the crunchy topping too.

Good flavor but the chicken got too tough from cooking it beforehand then cooking for 30min in the oven. I might use meat from a rotisserie chicken next time or maybe use dark meat.

I used the advice of some of the other reviews and added more cream of chicken.  I accidentally poured too many breadcrumbs in the mixture of butter and Parmesan but it turned out ok.  I will definitely make it again and maybe use crumbled butter crackers and perhaps more salt.

I used 2 cups of dry rotini noodles, added about 6 oz. of sour cream, and a tiny splash of beer to the bread crumbs. I also used a steamer bag of frozen mixed vegetables for time and convenience. Definitely will make again! Picky husband and toddler approved!

My husband asks me to make this for him every week now! I used crushed Ritz crackers on top instead of the breadcrumbs and I think it makes it crispier. Thanks for this recipe.

This was a lot of steps and a lot of dishes for something pretty mediocre. I’d cut back on the breadcrumbs, too.

Amazing! Followed directions exactly except I added a 1/2 of cup of milk as some reviews suggested. Also, cooked at 350 degrees versus 400 as I suspect this is the reason the recipe was ‘dry’ for some users. Lastly, I broiled on 350 degrees the last 2-5 mins to ensure the crust was brown enough. Will definitely make again.

Just popped this dish out of the oven! It smells heavenly! AND, I made it entirely GLUTEN FREE! Cut up 2 large chicken breasts, used 2 dry cups of GF penne rigate, 2 cans of Progresso GF cream of mushroom soup, used same spices for cooking chicken plus added some Mrs Dash’s Italian Medley seasoning. The Progresso soup has more liquid than a condensed soup. I added sour cream, a little shredded pepper jack & sharp cheddar cheeses.  Poured it into baking dish. Took GF multigrain bread & ran it through food processor for crumbs, then mixed it with butter & Parmesan/Romano cheese & spread it on top. Baked 30 minutes @ 400. My husband loved it....it was delicious!! This is certain to become a favorite! Thank you for the recipe.

Keeper!!  I made it nearly exact to recipe. I didn't have frozen veggies so I put in a drained can of sweet corn - worked just fine.  I think I will halve the bread crumbs next time as they were a little dry and took some pushing around the plate to moisten up. But this is GREAT!  And it should freeze well for nights I get home and just do NOT want to cook. :)  Thanks for a great recipe Jen - keep 'em comin'!!

I increased the amount of chicken and pasta because I felt it would be too soupy. It still came out very thick and creamy.
 To be very honest though, I did not really like the taste of it, but my 3 year old devoured her entire plate and my husband could take it or leave it. he said it reminded him of hospital food. He still ate it though, lol!
 Giving it 3 stars because my picky toddler ate it without complaint.

I would give this recipe 3 stars if made as it is written due to the dryness.  Even using the recommendations of other reviews to add milk, it is still dry, especially if you reheat leftovers.  To fix this, in addition to adding a cup of milk, only add half off the breadcrumbs.  To add a little more flavor, you can also drizzle a about 1/4 cup ranch dressing to the breadcrumb topping.

We made this for dinner tonight. Based on the other reviews, I added 2 cans of milk to create a sauce with the soups. I think 1 can would have been enough. :) But, we followed the rest of the recipe as instructed and it is delicious! I will definitely make it again, especially when the cold weather returns. This will be a great comfort food. :)

I thought this recipe was very easy to follow and also easy to make changes where needed. And I did make a few changes. I substituted 1 1/2 cups of Penne for the fusilli pasta. I used 2 cans of Campbell's  Heathy Request Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom soups. Instead of mixed vegetables, I used 1 cup of canned carrot slices drained, and 1 cup of canned cut green beans drained. I didn't have the dried minced onion so I used onion  powder, about 1 tsp. And I didn't have the dried parsley so I omitted it.  Neither myself or my husband like breadcrumb toppings on casseroles so I didn't do that part of the recipe. We both thought the casserole tasted great, and he even asked for a second helping! Next time I make this, I am thinking of  adding shredded mild cheddar cheese to the top the last 10 minutes of baking.   I definitely will be adding this recipe to my favorites! Thank you JENTOP!

this recipe was pretty good and easy to make, the only thing I did different was add a cup of half and half,  it was so thick with the condensed soup that you couldn't hardly mix it. Next time I will use 2 cups so its more creamy. The bread topping needs to be cut in about half way too much topping.

This was great!  It definitely needs a 3rd can of cream of chicken/mushroom.  To make it quicker, I used a rotisserie chicken.  I subbed frozen broccoli and a can of (well-drained) italian diced tomatoes for the mixed veggies, but I'm sure it would be great with standard mixed vegetables.

Really love this recipe,  but like pretty much every recipe I make it my own

2-3 cans mushroom soup
Brussel sprouts/peas/mushrms
Garlic salt/pepper/grd onion/grd garlic/montreal chkn spice

Mix cooked pasta and soup, add in chicken, then veggies.

Top with grated cheese, some pepper and garlic salt if desired. 

Spread crumb topping

This time I poured a bit of milk over mixture. Will decide if this was neccessary after. 

Cover.

Bake and then broil for one or two minutes.

Just OK, mainly due to the frozen mixed veggies.  Obviously that is a huge time saver, but also a flavor tanker as well IMO.  Frozen corn is ok, but green beans and carrots from frozen are nothing like the non-frozen item.  I wonder if throwing in some chopped carrots and uncooked green beans would work.  Maybe sub out the green beans for something else altogether.

Very good. I used ~ 2 1/2 cups (dry)rotini pasta, 3 chicken breasts, chopped onion, 1tsp garlic and added mushrooms. I also added 1/2 can milk as recommended by others and the amount of liquid was perfect. I used my large oval casserole dish- perfect size.

Pretty good! Only complaint is that its a tad too much basil. I used the low fat versions of the soups, and only one cup of breadcrumbs instead of 2. It was not dry at all as some have complained.

I made this with rotini instead of fusili, and ended up using 2 cups. The flavor is great!

Instead of frozen mixed vegetables I used a frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrot blend. The casserole was very good. I will use this recipe again.

Made this for my wife and 11 year old and it was a hit.  I used 2 cups of penne pasta.  Substituted minced dried onion for onion powder.  Substituted cream of celery for the mushroom soup.  Added a splash of 2% milk to each corner before baking.

I wanted something tasty, easy, and not loaded with pasta or cheese. This was really good considering how easy it was to make. I used frozen broccoli and cauliflower, diced the chicken into large chunks since I had whole breasts, added half a can of milk, and used Italian bread crumbs. It came together quickly and will make really good leftovers.

I used 2.5 cups of noodles. 3 tablespoons of oil was too much and made things very greasy, would only use 2 tablespoons in the future.
I made it expecting it to be a main dish but in the future I would  make it as a side dish.

I actually made this quite a few months ago but forgot to rate it. I used leftover rotisserie chicken as it needed to be used up. Other than that I made it pretty much as written. I could tell that it might need some liquid as it seemed a bit on the dry side and other reviews agreed. Next time I'll add a half can or so of milk or some FF sour cream or Greek yogurt. Aside from that, the flavor was very good and it was easy to put together. I'll definitely be making this again.

It's an ok casserole. I've followed this recipe almost to the T except didn't have parsley on hand and instead of parmesan cheese I used an old cheddar cheese as that's all I had on hand. 
I would make it again as it's not that expensive to make and it doesn't take a long time to prepare it but maybe less dried onion next time as that's all I'm tasting kinda overpowering.

I liked it and I will be making it again.  I used sour cream and half and half as other reviewers suggested.  I also left out the addition of butter to the topping mixture, but next time I'll probably incorporate.  All in all it was pretty quick and delicious.

I didn’t really like the texture of all the bread crumbs on the top. It was kind of bland in flavor and the leftovers were soggy. I won’t be making again because I don’t think it tastes good enough. Not to mention the calories is relatively high for the amount of food you get

Delicious and easy. I swapped the cream of mushroom for cream of potato and baked covered with tinfoil for 15 minutes and uncovered for 5 in a 13x9 baking pan. It came out perfectly creamy and amazing.  It’s even great to make for just myself with delicious leftovers for the week. Yum!

I used 2 cups of rotini instead of 1 cup fusilli.  I seasoned the tenders with California garlic salt and browned them whole.  I shredded them with two forks into coarse bites before mixing everything.  Like previous reviewers stated, this needed about a can of milk.  It turned out great , and the bread crumb mixture added a nice crunch.

The aroma of this recipe was certainly apparant throughout the apartment complex. This recipe was simple and took one hour to create. You may cut the cost of this by omitting the cream of chicken soup, and using organic frozen vegetables instead of fresh. Broccoli florets, peas and coin crinkle cut carrots make the perfect medley. Very tasty, healthy and budget friendly!

This is my go-to casserole recipe! I have made this recipe many times before and it always turns out great--it is delicious and easy to modify.

This time around I didn't have any mixed veggies on hand, so I swapped out frozen broccoli instead. I also added a little more milk to make it creamier, and I seasoned the chicken with a pre-made poultry seasoning rub. It turned out great! :)

This was my first time trying this! I made the recipe as written with one exception...I used WHOLE WHEAT bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand. It turned out to be a negative for me since they started to blacken after about 20 minutes of baking. Fortunately, they were easily removed with a spoon. My youngest adult daughter and myself thought the dish was just okay. While my husband ate two helpings and said that he really enjoyed it! However, it's not a dish that I would make again.

I added 1 tablespoon tarragon, and because we made a double batch for a large group, I changed out the soups to 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of onion, 1 can of cheddar cheese. I added about 2 cups chicken broth to thin the soups. It was amazing! Wonderful reviews. I will definitely be making this again.

I gave this 5 stars because it was so easy and delicious.  I used 3 large chicken breasts and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (we don't like mushroom).  I didn't have a bag of frozen mixed veggies, so used half a bag of frozen broccoli chopped up , a half of can of sweet corn and chopped up carrot sticks.  followed the rest of the recipe and it came out amazing.   I found leftovers to taste even better after the flavors all married in the container overnight.  We will be making this again for sure.

Added 7oz. of cheese to the mix itself, along with a cup of milk and doubled the amount of pasta. Also added a bunch of garlic (but that's just because I like garlic, not really a must have) and used panko instead of normal breadcrumbs. Turned out pretty good. When I make it again (which I will), I'm adding sliced mushrooms and also doubling the amount of chicken to two pounds. Made enough for six meals, or dinner for almost the whole week for one person. With the extra chicken it might stretch another two days. Can't beat that!

Great recipe! I used all cream of  mushroom soup half of the vegetables  2 cans mushrooms. I did  not use basil I do not like it. I had left over rotisserie chicken so I used it. Crushed garlic     croutons for the top. It really needed milk I used 1 can. Baked it for  25 minutes.  The flavor of this casserole is  great. I will definitely make it again. CFC

Delicious! Made a few changes to make it "my own" but who doesn't do that? I used rotelli pasta and added sautéed onions plus a little milk. Whether from leftover ingredients or fresh, this dish is a winner. Thanks!

As some previous comments made, this recipe needs some milk added because the soup makes it quite thick. I happen to like mine a bit thinner.  I also added an extra cup of fusilli and glad I did because there wouldn't have been enough with just one cup. Since I really like to get a lot of vegetables in my meals, I would definitely add more  the next time I make it. My granddaughters who are 3 yrs and 20 mos. old really liked it.

This recipe needs more flavor. We found it to be bland and it needs more moisture. Will try this again with some changes to suit our particular taste. Its a good start, and definitely something that requires food that I always have on hand so it is convenient.

This was pretty darn good! I had ingredients and no dish! Saw this and threw it together really quickly. I had left over chicken that I had roasted the night before and used that.  I didn't have frozen veggies, but I had canned and I think they were even better.  I threw in some mushrooms that were hanging around the fridge, and it came out great - my picky daughter loved it.  (She doesn't eat animals who she considers 'cute' anymore -- but she still eats chicken thankfully).  Must be the 'ugly animal diet' LOL

I did not care for this. Maybe it's just my husband's and my taste buds, but we thought it was bland (even with salt added) and just gross... we would not make it again.

After reading other reviews, I decided to take advice and add about a cup or so of water to the soup mixture so that it wouldn't end up being too thick or dry. I'm glad I did!  I also used fresh onions and basil instead of dried to amp up the taste overall. I think next time, I'll play more with different spices to give a bit more flavor. Also, I love the Parmesan bread crumb topping, so I plan to double it to balance the extra creaminess of the soup mix. Overall, it's pretty good.

I made this for an elderly couple who have salt restrictions. Used low salt versions wherever possible,  chicken thighs instead of breasts (lower cost); and Italian veggies.  They loved it and it reheats well!

Very good. I was looking for a healthy pasta chicken dish for the two of us for dinner and this filled the bill. I cut the recipe back to 4 servings and there were still some leftovers. Used two skinless boneless chicken breasts from the freezer. Also only used one can of mushroom soup but put in a cup of yogurt to make up for the other can. Didn't have any fusilli so used up the last of some whole wheat penne. Might add some milk to make this a little creamier as suggested by others here. We both enjoyed, will make again.

Because you add cream of chicken and mushroom, the taste is not unique. But if that is the flavor you want, the recipe is nice, with the breadcrumbs to top it off.

Absolutely delicious! My husband enjoyed it as well and he's not much of a casserole person, so I'm impressed! Really easy to make and then keep in the refrigerator for those nights that you just don't want to cook. I substituted the chicken tenderloin for breasts and didn't use butter with the cheese and bread crumbs on top, to cut down on the calories. I am definitely making this dish again!

My 5-yr-old loved it and after her first bite said please make it again Daddy. Really good! I don't think I need to mix the bread crumbs with butter next time as I just added some extra dry on top to completely cover the pan and it was fine, nice and crispy. Added fresh onion and garlic for a little zing too.

I made this tonight 01/28/2017 very easy recipe to follow and quick to make and bake! My family enjoyed it very much! Although I changed out the dried minced onions for  fresh minced sweet onion, minced celery, and fresh minced garlic. My family loves onions and celery in their casseroles like this. It turned sooo good! I also added natures seasoning and Mrs. dash. When I make it again I'm kick it up with sour cream , broccoli, cauliflower, and fresh mushrooms.  It will be even better I bet!

My husband absolutely LOVED this casserole!! I made this on a very cold and snowy night for dinner as the description said and it was perfect... Yummy, creamy and filling.  The only change I made was a different type of pasta because I had it on hand. This is a perfect winter casserole using ingredients that I almost always have on hand.

I changed this a bit. I used 1 cup of protein plus penne pasta instead of the called for pasta. I used 1 cup of petite fresh carrots and 1 cup frozen broccoli in place of the frozen veggies.  I changed the topping to use 3 Tbsp of butter from 2 and then instead of the grated Parmesan I used fresh grated 3 cheese Italian and also used Italian bread crumbs. My husband LOVED this and we will be having it again. I thought it was a bit dry and will add more moisture to it for next time.

Made this last night and it was a hit.  My husband does not like casseroles but he liked this one.  Out of my two children, two of them ate it.  All round delicious.

I read the reviews and added an extra can of the chicken soup, as well as some milk. I also added an extra cup of pasta. It came out great...very creamy. The only thing I might change the next time I make it, is to dial back the basil a tad.

This came out really good.  I made a few small changes.  Next time, I will make a few minor adjustments.  This time, I used the small 8oz. can of carrots and peas instead of 2 cups frozen vegetables.  I also used one can each of Campbell's cream of chicken (as required) and one of cream of broccoli.  I drained the leftover liquid in the saucepan after cooking the chicken    I also used the little ring shaped pasta instead of fusili, again, it was on hand.  I used a 9x9 glass dish which worked OK.  I will use a larger dish next time, use less breadcrumbs not drain the chicken juice and maybe add a bit of liquid to keep it a little more gooey and moist.  The consistency was actually perfect (could have done with less breadcrumbs) but I can imagine it will be a bit dry tomorrow when I reheat it.

First after watching the video I could tell that the dish she used wasn't 9x13, and with only 1 cup of dry pasta in the recipe I could tell there is no way this dish serves 6 with leftovers!  So I increased by half all the ingredients so it would fit a 9x13 and serve my family of 6.  It turned out pretty good, the family liked it.  I agree with another reviewer though that the recipe called for waaayy too much bread crumbs.  Even with a larger recipe  that I made I thought the bread crumbs were too thick on top.  Actually if I make it again I will use Durkee onions on top for some texture and crunch.

This was delicious! My picky little eaters love it! I took advice from the most popular post and added about 1/4 c of milk to make it creamier, hence not so dry, and added italian panko bread crumbs, instead of plain, and this is so full of flavor, they don't even recognize the green bean taste! Thanks for posting.

I didn't have any milk so I used chicken broth to keep it moist. Just don't use to much. just about 1/4 cup. I did add the sour cream. My husband said "it's a keeper"

This is true comfort food. Excellent flavor and very satisfying. Only had enough for lunch the next day. The only thing I did differently was I added fresh onion and a can of mushrooms and 1/2 cup milk. I will definitely make again.

Not bad at all.  Good for leftover rotisserie chicken meat. I did 2c of rotini, 2 cans of soup plus 1 can of milk.  Added a bunch of spices I had in the cupboard that sounded good at the time. 

Next time I will reduce the breadcrumb mixture by about 1/2.

It was delicious, but the quantities seemed really off.  We used about 1 pound of chicken breast (not sure how that compared to what is suggested), 1.5 cups of pasta, one can of soup, added some milk, topped it with just half a cup of bread crumbs and more parmesan than called for.  Luckily, it's a very forgiving recipe, and it came out fine.

I used rice instead of pasta...a little less than 1 cup dry.  I also used some chicken broth and cream of celery instead of the cream of cream of chicken because it was what I had on hand.  I like that this recipe is so easy to change up!

I made this exactly by the recipe but it didn't come out very creamy. It was tasty but dryer than I expected for a casserole. I wonder if a bit of milk (1 or 2 cups)should have been called for.

My husband is a VERY picky eater and he ate 2 bowls of this for dinner! Personally I would have liked a little more flavor... maybe more garlic? I don't know, but it was still good and a keeper for a recipe later.

My husband and I both really liked this. If I recall I followed the recipe as is. I was thinking I could make it for a friend who is sick and needs meals for the family. I think it would be very kid friendly.

This is a great recipe and I highly recommend it to anyone in need for something fairly cheap. If you don't include the low volume ingredients like the spices, bread crumbs, butter, etc.  The dish usually costs 2-3 dollars per serving which makes it great for savings. Instead of the normal chicken, I cut up chicken thighs and it tasted the same to save money. The crumb topping works perfectly with the meal adding an extra texture and flavoring inside. The veggies are the perfect amount, chicken is delicious, and whole dish worth while.

I would have given this a 5 stars, but I added an extra ingredient.  I made as directed, but I added in a whole cup of sour cream. The boys in my family didn't leave any room for leftovers, so it was a HUGE hit. The only downside was that there was a lot of "prep work" to be done, so it took more time than I would have liked. Tip: use crushed Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs.

This recipe was very good!  I did follow the suggestion of adding a soup can of milk and I'm glad I did.  I also added some mushrooms and used stove top stuffing instead of bread crumbs.  Will probably try a different combination of veggies next time.  Great recipe, very yummy.

My family loved this dish. This was such an easy dish to make. I had almost everything I needed on hand already. I used left over roasted chicken that I made the night before. I only had cream of chicken but I added a can of milk to the recipe and it turned out real creamy. I only used corn and peas because my family doesn't like vegetables to much. I'll definitely make this again.

The frozen vegetables were a massive fail with my kids, but I will make this again with fresh vegetables.  The flavors worked really well.

As per other suggestions I added sour cream and broccoli for mixed veggies since that's what I had on hand. Also topped with cheddar cheese instead of bread crumbs. Very good and all 5 kids liked it. Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good.  I added mixed veggies, broccoli and some milk to make it creamier.  It tastes like pot pie without the crust.  Hubby and daughter liked it.  I will make this dish again.

I made a double recipe so I could have left overs for the work week. I found it good but not great. A little too salty for me - I don't heavily salt my food so all the canned condensed soup would be enough sodium for me without adding more. My husband asked me to keep the recipe, which is not common, and the kids liked it immediately and ate it all up. 5 stars from them and 3-4 from me.

This recipe has great flavor!. I will make it again :) I did not use frozen veggies, I used 2 cans of drained Veg-All instead.  I also sautéed onions instead of onion flakes.  Next time I would  mix crumbled bread crumbs with the parmesan for the topping.  I used Italian Bread crumbs and it was a bit too mealy for my taste.

Very Good! I had two large chicken breast so I doubled the pasta to 2 cups. Only pasta I had was Penne.  I added a splash or two of milk like other viewers suggested and let it simmer down to make it creamier. I used a bread crumb parmesan cheese mix that I had left over from a pork chop dish.  It was pretty easy and great!! Added cilantro to the top and used up a orange pepper I needed to use up before it went bad.  All I wish I could add was mozzarella cheese!

I doubled the recipe and the only main thing I changed was the garlic powder. I rarely use the powder, but prefer to use fresh garlic. I put some in the water I used to cook the pasta, and in the butter I used to mix the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese in. Turned out GREAT!  :)

I thought this was bland but my toddler ate every bit of it so you betcha this is getting made again.  I added 1/2 a cup of milk as other reviewers recommended and the consistency was fine, my veggie of choice was frozen broccoli and onion.  Next time I would sauté onion and garlic with the chicken and I would play around with the veggies.  I am just thrilled my toddler actually ate it, a bit of Sriracha makes it palatable enough for me.

Perfect for kids, nothing weird.  As a single Dad with limited time and fewer skills this was great.  I substituted a second can of cream of Chicken for the cream of mushroom and, like others, added a can of milk.  Also added bacon bits to top which added a nice savory, smoky taste and, well, because it's me any my 2 boys, so, yeah, bacon.

Very easy to adapt recipe. I increased the pasta and veggies to use up what I had on hand, added some cheddar cheese to the mixture as well as some greek yogurt for a more liquidy mixture and did cover halfway through so the breadcrumbs weren't too brown. Great way to get the kids to eat veggies and super easy!

Just made this for dinner.  I used 2 cups of noodles, 2 chicken breasts (cubed) and for the vegetables I used 3 med. mushrooms sliced, 1 head of broccoli florets, 1/2 cup of peas.  A great way to use all the leftover vegetables in the fridge.  I also used about 3/4 can of water, since a few comments said it was dry.  I mixed the spices in a bowl and tossed the chicken in them before frying.  Tastes like Chicken Tetrazzini.  A definite add to our meal rotation!  Very Good.

I made it with egg noodles and left over chicken. I added about a quarter cup of milk. It was pretty good but too salty and needed more milk, it was too thick.

Nice mix of flavors and great comfort food.  I doubled the pasta, chicken and seasonings; used a 12 oz bag of broc/carrots/cauliflower;  kept the soup proportions but added 1/2 a soup can of milk.   Thanks for the recipe, will make again for sure.

Definitely need to add at least a cup of milk. Way too much bread crumbs too. Next time I'll change that to 1/2 cup. Used a 3QT pan and dish and both were filled to the max. Will make again w/some adjustments.

This recipe is super easy and I had most of the stuff on hand. I broke it into two halves, one with chicken and one without. I did add more soup than it asked for AND a slash of milk and it turned out perfect. Not to dry. My advice is if you want to make this vegetarian, SEASON! it's pretty bland without chicken. You can really customize this recipe for any preference!

Made the changes that were mentioned in previous reviews. Added half a can more of cream of chicken and Italian seasonings to the chicken. The bread crumb mixture got a little too dark. Next time I will use a thin biscuit layer on top to make a pot pie effect.

I made this mostly following the recipe. I made some changes following some reviews, but I'm rating this based on how it would have turned out had I not followed the reviews. First of all, TOO MANY BREADCRUMBS! I cut back the breadcrumbs from 1 cup to 3/4th of a cup and boy do I wish I cut it down to 1/4th of a cup. I ended up tilting the casserole dish diagonally toward the sink and blowing off as many breadcrumbs from the surface as possible. Luckily the casserole was just for myself or that would have been completely unacceptable to do had I been serving it to guests. The casserole itself is dry, and the obscene amount of breadcrumbs just makes it worse. They're not even crunchy and don't add much flavor at all. I ended up using about 1/2 to 3/4th of a cup of water as per some of the reviews to keep the casserole moist because it would have been too dry otherwise. However, the flavor was great and even better the next day. My only suggestions would be add some water or milk to make it moist, and use much less bread crumbs. If you want a crunchier texture use panko crumbs, or even omit the breadcrumbs completely if you don't care much for them.

Wow. This is an amazing recipe, especially for cold winter evenings. I read the reviews and added a little bit if milk so it wasn't dry and it turned out perfect. My parents and siblings loved it, as did I. I recommend it to everyone merry Christmas!

I thought it was good didn't add dried tomatoes or parsley not a huge fan if either but the rest was what I cook with. I used about a cup and half of elbow noodles instead  as I had to improvise. Would make again.

Cooked this for my parents (I'm the cook in the family) and they absolutely loved it. Said it reminded them of my mom's old tuna noodle casserole but fancier. 

Next time I make it I'll definitely add a little paprika or something to give it a little more depth of flavor. Very comforting homey recipe. It was completely gone in two days!!!

This recipe is such a good base to modify as needed. I used 2 cups pasta, 4 chicken breast, 2 cans cream of mushroom, 2 cans cream of chicken with herbs (Campbell), 1/4 cup of milk,  2 cups mixed veggies frozen,  1 tablespoon basel, 1 tablespoon garlic salt mixed in.  I sprinkled herbs day province on top as well as a small bag of three cheese blend by kraft. So perfect. Fed a family of 4 plus left overs. Very cheap to make as well!

DL Oct 2014- I modified this recipe to suit our tastes.  I used broccoli, carrots, fresh mushrooms, onion and green peppers instead of the mixed vegetables.  I added milk and sour cream as other suggested.  I added swiss cheese to the mixture.  I topped the casserole with a mixture of ritz crackers, garlic cheese croutons and melted butter.  Yum!

I thought it was great. The only things I changed was I added 1/3 cup milk and Romano cheese instead of parmesan. Very creamy and tasty. Good reheated as well.

I liked it but my husband did not. He thought the topping was strange and did not care for the texture.

This was the perfect meal to warm you up and those chilly nights. It was flavorful and was very filling. I used vegetable rotini for the pasta since that was in the cupboard already. I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup so I used two can of chicken. I was worried when I put it all into the casserole dish that there wasn't enough liquid, but it came out perfectly. I added a small amount of shredded cheddar cheese, that wasn't necessary because it would have been great without it anyways. I will make this again for sure!

I fed this to my husband and dad last night and everyone thought the flavoring was really good. I had accidentally put a bag of noodles rather than a cup, so it turned out pretty dry, but I would definitely make it again and try it with the right amount of ingrediants.

The casserole was pretty easy to make. I added more veggies than the recipe called for because I am always looking for was to get more vegetables in. It tasted great the first night, but the leftovers didn't reheat well. (But maybe that's just me). Otherwise, it's a very delicious recipe. I will make this again!
