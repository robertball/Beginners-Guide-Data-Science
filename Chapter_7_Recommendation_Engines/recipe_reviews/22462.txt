I use two single serving yogurts for one container of cool whip. I usually buy Yoplait's strawberry/banana yogurt. The combination is out of this world. If you have time (although not necessary) chill overnight...the flavors are much more rich the next day but it's still good served immediately. Have fun and use your favorite flavors of yogurt.

This is the standard fruit dip for our family get-togethers.  We usually make it with Raspberry White Chocolate yogurt (by Yoplait).  It is light and delicious.  It tastes great the same day, but doesn't keep very well.

This is the easiest and lightest fruit dip I have ever made.  As with other reviews, it tastes much better with 2 containers of yogurt to 1 container of cool whip.  It's also much healthier than some of the marshmallow fruit dips, especially if you use the cool whip free.  I made it the other day for a party and decided to divide the cool whip and use a container and a half of 2 types of yogurt in each.  It makes so much and I wanted 2 varieties.  My guests went nuts over it and couldn't believe how simple it was.  I suggest yoplait key lime pie and strawberry for 2 great flavors.  I also used the left overs for fruit parfaits and added some granola.

I make this recipe ALL THE TIME.....
It is super easy and the best thing is you can use whatever yogurt you like. 
I also added a bit of cream cheese to make it a bit bolder. It is the best dip I have ever used and my son LLOVES to make it. (he is 5)

FINALLY!! I thought I'd never find a fruit dip that didn't contain cream cheese or marshmellow creme! This was absolutely wonderful! It's easy, it's light, it's refreshing and not overly sweet. Thanks Carmen!

I jumped on all recipes for a spur of the moment fruit dip for my kids lunch I was in the middle of making, and a lot of the other recipes were calling for softened cream cheese or marshmallow creme (and I didn't have either!) I found this and VERY quickly whipped this up with cool whip from the fridge and two containers of kids Trix yogurt, and a sprinkle of splenda for added sweetness, and my kids loved it!  They dipped everything in it, including graham crackers!!  Thanks for a quick, easy, and tasty recipe!!

Oh my goodness! Who new such a yummy dip could be so simple!? I needed a recipe for a healthy fruit dip for my first graders Valentine's Day party.  I followed others' advice and used dbl the amount of yogurt. I also used light whipped topping and fat free vanilla yogurt. (vanilla was all I had) It was SO yummy. I can't wait to try it with other flavors of yogurt. I'm going to make this and keep it on hand.

After I read the ingredients in other fruit dips, I decided to make a healthier alternative for my toddler and this was it!  You can use whatever flavor of yogurt and it is great!  I tried using pudding (made with 1/2 c less milk for firmness), but it was a little too sweet for my tastes.  I will stick to this simple and somewhat healthy dip from now on!

I really wasn't very impressed with this.  It was ok - but just ok.  To me it didn't have much flavor, and tasted like just plain cool whip.  I just felt it needed something else.  I won't be trying this one again.

This was one of several appetizers I made for the Super Bowl. I used Granny Smith & red delicious apples, watermelon & cantelope. Everyone enjoyed the dip so much I had to cut up more fruit. We really enjoyed this recipe & so easy. Like many others suggested I used 2 containers of yogurt (I used orange creme..umm good!). This is something I will make many times again trying different kinds of yogurt..Thanks for a great recipe

made it with Stoneyfield fat free french vanilla yogurt (16 oz.) and cool whip free. OMG, it was so good.  I could eat it without fruit.  It is about 13 calories per serving if the servings are 32.

This is a great dip. Use 16 oz. of yogurt to each 8 oz.  whipped topping for a 5-star recipe. Orange is my favorite.

Was looking for a lighter fruit dip. This was good. Used LITE Cool whip and two single serves of light blackberry/ pomegranite yogurt. YUM. Bananas, strawberries, and pears are so good.....Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this. Served it at a shower and a few people asked what was in it because they liked how light it was. I saw many people get seconds of it so I'm assuming it was a hit. I loved it on strawberries. I used half a container of creamy cool whip and a 6oz container of thick vanilla yogurt.

Super Easy Fruit Dip Haiku: "Well, yes it's easy. But to us, was just whipped cream. More yogurt maybe?" Served this in half a scooped out cantaloupe at a party alongside "Fruity Fun Skewers" and barely a dent was put in it. I wanted an alternative to the fruit dips that consist of marshmallow fluff and cream cheese and thought this would be a win, but honestly, it tasted just like whipped cream. I used French Vanilla yogurt; maybe if I doubled the containers, or subbed a flavored yogurt like some reviewers did, it would've been eaten up, but I ended up tossing it all out.

I followed other advice and used more yougurt.  I used 2-6oz. strawberry yoplait and 1-4oz. lemon whip yoplait.  I also added some food coloring because my daughter wanted it to be pink.  I would use less cool whip next time, it made alot!  Overall very tasty, nice and light, not too sweet.

I am requested to make this fruit dip at every family function! EVERYONE loves it. I use two containers of yogurt per one container coolwhip. It is SO versatile! I usually do one fruit flavored yogurt and one that is a bit more bold, like the yoplait cinnemon roll (YUM!) or chocolate moose. It is always the first thing to completely go!

I think I've found the fruit dip I'll be making from now on. Like others, I was bored with cream cheese or marshmallow creme based fruit dip recipes. The only thing I did differently was use 2 containers of yogurt, rather than 1. I used Yoplait's Blueberry and Yoplait's French Vanilla. So, so, so good. Served it up at my son's birthday party and everyone thought it was delicious! Great and simple recipe!

It doesn't get much easier than this! I mixed lowfat vanilla yogurt with light cool whip and brought it to a potluck with fruit. People asked if it was whipped cream and wouldn't believe me when I told them how easy it was to make!

This is a good recipe if you are looking for a dip that doesn't have marshmallow. I put about a teaspoon of vanilla and  some orange zest for a bit of zing.

Made this for my 4 year old's b-day party.  Used 2 strawberry yogurts to a container of CoolWhip. The kids liked it, the grown ups thought it was okay. I'd make again, but will think about using a more "potent" flavor like key lime or lemon.

I made  this for a party of 50 people following the recipe as written. No one liked it. Vanilla yogurt was too plain and didn't add to the whipped topping. I won't make this again.

I took other's advice and doubled the yogurt, using 16oz. of vanilla yogurt. I use fat free whipped topping. Everyone raves over this ridiculously easy recipe!

Perfect! Light and refreshing! I was also searching for a dip without cream cheese or marshmallow creme. I used Fiber One yogurt and Cool Whip Free for a great low calorie treat.

I have made this with peach yogurt and with vanilla yogurt. I prefer the latter, with some amaretto mixed in. When you keep the dip in the fridge overnight, you have to mix it well before serving it.

Chocolate yogurt in this is awesome with strawberries!  I used 1 chocolate yogurt with half a tub of the cool whip (I actually used an organic version of it) and the other half with a fruit yogurt to give options with the different fruits on the platter.  Both were still very cool whip tasting so I might use less in the future to bring out more of the yogurt flavor.  Would make a great cake topper too.

Second time making this recipe but this time tweaked it a little to use what I had on hand. I used 200ml balkan style yogurt fieldberry and 200ml greek style lemon yogurt in 2 cups dream whip (all I had in pantry and it worked fine). Let it sit for a day before eating and all the flavours will come out beautifully. I would definatly use the thicker greek/balkan yogurts to be sure it clings to fruit when dipped.

I made this with light Cool Whip and fat free key lime yogurt and added a little packet of crystallized lemon to add more tartness.  So good, so simple and so much healthier than most fruit dips.  Good with graham crackers and vanilla wafers, too!!

This recipe was all right but not spectacular.  I thought the flavor was basically that of Cool-Whip.  I think if I ever make this again, I might try adding another carton of yogurt just for more flavor.  There is definitely something missing, I'm just not sure what.  It is, however, incredibly easy.  I used it on a fruit pizza and still had about half of the dip left for fruit.

WOW! I used raspberry yogurt for a fruit tray, then tried peach with some fresh peach slices for a pound cake and received great reviews. Everyone loved it with no leftovers. Quick, easy, cheap and you can use low fat topping and no fat yogurt to reduce your guilt! I added a little vanilla extract for the fruit and almond for the cake, made it even better.

Delicious and not too sweet. I used lemon flavoured yogurt so there was some tang against the sweetness.  The texture is light and fluffy.  Good enough to eat with a spoon ??

I made this with Oikos Raspberry Blended Greek Yogurt.  I just halfed the recipe (4 oz regular cool whip, 2- 5.3 oz containers of yogurt).  It made plenty for my fruit tray. Will definitely make again!

I used about 16 - 20 oz of vanilla yogurt and one 8 oz container of Cool Whip.  However, I also added confectioners sugar to taste (it needed to be a little more sweeter), and 1 tsp on vanilla extract (to boost the vanilla flavor).  The mixture thickened up nicely after sitting in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. It was delicious.  My husband really enjoyed it.

Finally a simple, tasty fruit dip that doesn't have marshmallow creme!  So simple, and you can choose whichever flavour(s) of yogurt you like!  Sometimes I add a bit of softened cream cheese for a bolder flavour.

My friend gave me her fruit dip recipe that is similar to this but she adds two teaspoons of jello powder to hers. It makes the dip a bit thicker so I would definitely use two containers of yogurt.

This fruit dip was certainly "super easy," but it did not have enough flavor for me. It was a weak flavored dip, and I even used twice the amount of yogurt called for.

This has been a standby snack at my house for years because I don't like the added sugar or marshmallow creme (and cream cheese is very expensive with 4 bottomless pit children! haha)W make ours in single servings so it is more customizable. Equal parts of Yogurt to Cool-Whip seems to be about right for our tastes. If you want a "stiffer" consistency just add more cool-whip. This is super delicious on apples or strawberries and we never have any leftovers. Also tried it on chunks of Canteloupe and seemed to get good reviews from my kiddos. :) 
   *tip* when seasonal cool-whips come out....... try this with strawberry yogurt and chocolate cool-whip...... soooooooooo good. haha :)

Easy, creamy, and delicious.  I used Red Raspberry Yogurt.  But, any type would be great.
