The frosting is horrible.  This recipe is expensive to make.

Was really yummy. I topped with chocolate frosting. Reminded me of a "chocolate chip cookie' cake.

I made this cake for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he loved it.  It turned out exactly like the picture and I have never made a cake from scratch before.  It was fun and it tasted fantastic, so well, he almost wouldn't share any with me!

Naturally i made this cake for Valentines day. It was my first experience making a cake from scratch and it turned out great!  I stayed away from the frosting and just dyed a store bought brand.

I made this cake for our anniversary and my husband loved it. It was great, considering I can ruin almost everything I get my hands on.

The cake was OK.  I'd use a mix next time.  But the cake was just too cute.  Great Valentine's cake!

This cake tastes like a big chocolate cookie but cake like. What i di was i madea butter cream frosting that is on this website instead of using the suggested frosting. Everyone else loved the cake. Its not bad but not the best cake i ever i had. Its cute though to make fo rvalentines day or anniversary.
