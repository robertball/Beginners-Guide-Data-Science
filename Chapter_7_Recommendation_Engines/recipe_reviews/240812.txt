This is a lovely side dish or salad with African flavors. I think you could easily toss it with cooked chicken or shrimp for a main dish. I could not find harissa so I amde a mixture of a 1/2 teaspoon chili paste and six finely minced mint leaves. This turned out great in spite of me. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Yes and it was fun tastey and quick. Yum. It went great with the Moroccan lamb tagine.

Easy, re-heats well, and has a unique flavor.  I used Israeli (Pearl) couscous, but it might be better with regular couscous.  No harissa, so I used hot sauce. Saffron strands are really expensive in the grocery store - try to find it at a local market.
