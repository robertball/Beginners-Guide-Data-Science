I love fried cabbage & noodles, but I didn't really care for this with the bacon. Next time I'll stick to plain C&N fried in butter or just use kielbasa.

I grew up eating this basic recipe... the only small differences is we used paprika to spice things up and sauté the onions in bacon grease before adding the cabbage. Never used the bacon in the dish.  (in my parents’ house there is always bacon grease around...)

This is Halushki, a traditional Slovak dish. I grew up eating this and still make it today. I can't believe anyone would NOT like the bacon in this!

This is the exact way we've always made it in my family.  I also put sour cream out as a condiment to put on top

I made this with homemade noodles with the help of my Kitchenaid stand mixer and the pasta attachments.  I did not add the hot sauce, but it was delicious without.  Definitely not a low fat recipe, but very yummy!

It was good. I left out the hot sauce though and added crushed red pepper flakes instead.

It may have been the bacon I used but there was just too much bacon grease which overpowered the cabbage and noodles so much that all you could taste was the grease.  I may not be allowed to tell the brand of bacon but it was OM and I will not buy it again.  Maybe I will try it another time with different bacon but I did throw 99% of it in the garbage because of that grease.  Hate to blame the recipe when it may have been the product I used.  So I will say it was "ok"

this is the same basic recipe I grew up on also! My Polish Gramma, mom and aunt always included this in family meals,, but we would make our own fresh  noodles.  IF you don't really like bacon or the grease,, we sometimes fried polish sausage, or ham instead. thanx for sharing!!

Made it just as written in a black iron Dutch oven. Worked like charm. Excellent recipe. Very tasty and makes great leftovers.
