I used this recipe for steak fajitas...minus the salad part.  Instead of pickling the onions, I sliced thin and cooked them with the peppers on a "skillet" over the fire next to the steak.  Very good.

I served this for company and everybody asked for the recipe.  It's a great-tasting, healthful entree salad that's easy to prepare.  I would definitely make this again.  The pickled red onions were a great addition to the salad.

The recipe is outstanding!  I was surprised by how easy it was.  The meat is tender and the flavor out of this world! My husband and kids ate it all up and raved about how incredible it was. You must try this recipe!

Great recipe - the flavors blend beautifully. I made it as written and added chopped tomato and avocado. My only complaint is about how tart the lime-garlic dressing is when you get to the bottom of the bowl. If you didn't drain the dressing off the arugula, you were in for a sour bite. Next time, I'm going to try a lime-cilantro vinaigrette instead.

Next time I make this I'll use Tri-tip steak with spicy Montreal seasoning- the cumin rub wasn't that great. Cilantro would be great, too. This salad was AWESOME!!!!!!

Best recipe in a long time...  would add a quarter cup of cilantro on top of the salad to really bring the flavors home. Could not ask for a tastier summer salad!  Enjoy!

I marinated the onions in red wine vinegar as that was all I had. A delicous salad.

After trying this recipe as-is last time, I had to 'dress up' the dressing to suit my tastes, it was just slightly bland.  But the overall recipe is great.  This time I tried the dressing base of this recipe, mixed with the spices, and marinated some sliced chicken meat, bell peppers, red onion, and mushrooms and made a stir-fry out of it.  I served it over rice and it was fantastic!  I think I actually like the flavors of the lime and vinegar with chicken rather than beef, and the salad can still be used and taste fantastic.  Thanks, very yummy :-)

We only used the marinade portion and made regular fajitas, but this had great flavor after only marinating for a couple hours.  This will be my go-to fajita marinade from now on - thank you!

This is a very good recipe.  It looks sort of high maintenance, but is actually quite simple.  I used a fat free dressing to reduce calories, but added it to the lime and garlic.  I also added some tomato since they were in season...it worked nicely.

Loved the lime flavor. Added extra veggies and cooked them in the marinade. Very yummy!
