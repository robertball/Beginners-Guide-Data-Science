Good meatless alfredo lasagna. I used yellow onion in place of the green onion. I only actually made four of these for guest that didn't want meat. Turned out great. I did add some cottage cheese to the ricotta cheese mixture.

I am a vegetarian and I made this for my boyfriend who asked for a very cheesy dinner.  And indeed, cheesy it is.  I found the recipe very tasty, but it was perhaps a tad too rich.  Calling for 21 ounces of alfredo sauce is just too much.
