Absolutely DELICIOUS! We loved this! Did it in the crock pot instead of the oven and I almost couldn't take it out because it was so tender and falling apart! A+++++

This recipe was awesome. I made it for my Asian mother, who can be a tough critic when it comes to other people's cooking; she liked it so much that she actually suggested I make it again a week later when my siblings were coming to visit. I made it three times in one week and didn't even get tired of it. It is sooo delicious. I added a little bit of sriracha to one batch to give it a little heat--it was excellent.  My husband ate some of the shredded meat on tortillas with molcajete salsa--I didn't think the flavor combo would work at first, but boy was I wrong. This meat made for excellent burritos.   The flavor was so good that when chuck roasts went on sale at the local market, we stocked the freezer so that we would be able to make this roast any time.

great way to dress up a chuck roast. I added two cloves garlic minced to liquid and omitted garlic salt. I also added some roasted bell pepper. I will definately make this again.

This is an excellent recipe as written. I have sodium issues so I had to reduce the soy sauce and substituted  granulated garlic for the garlic salt but the recipe is still deserving five stars.

This is by far the BEST pot roast recipe I've ever had. This is now my husband's favorite meal. Every time we serve it to guests they rave about it. I sear the outsides in the pan and put it in the crock pot with the sauce ingredients. I use a little red wine to deglaze the pan and get those flavorful bits in the crock pot. Instead of celery seed I use celery stalks and sometimes add onions. I also use fresh minced ginger. To make this WAPF compliant I use coconut oil, traditionally brewed soy sauce, raw honey, and raw vinegar. I also use arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch.  I cook it on high for 3-4 hours and on low for 2-3 hours. Every time the meat is so tender it falls apart. I always make enough to have leftovers and store it in the amazing sauce. I am making this today and LOVE it.

I made this recipe as written.  The soy sauce flavor in the juice was overwhelming and it was too strong to just pour all over the meat ... it was more of a dipping-type sauce.   The next time I'll cut the soy sauce down to 1/2 C and maybe add more honey.  I served with white rice and broccoli.  Not bad and worth trying again with some changes.
UPDATE 3/13:  Made again, kept soy sauce the same but added a cup of water.  It cooked nicely but for some reason some of the meat was dry... I think that is more the cut of meat's fault rather than the recipe.  The juice was delicious, so much so that my daughter asked me to save it so she could "drink it."  Yuck. As good as it was I did not comply!

Pleasantly surprised! Very good recipe. I did take the advice of other reviewers and use low sodium soy sauce, garlic powder, and a little less water.   After baking, I removed the meat from the pan and tented on a plate. I finely sliced some onion, added to the liquid and reduced it on the stove for about 30 minutes on medium. Then I added the cornstarch mixture, cooked a little more and it was perfect! Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is pretty good and a nice change - different way to make pot roast. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and used low sodium soy sauce. This makes a large amount of gravy and I think the flavor could be a bit more concentrated. To solve both issues, I'll try using less water next time.

By using fresh garlic and reducing the amount of soy sauce used, this is very good and I will make it again.

This was good. I cooked as traditional pot roast with potatoes, carrots, celery  and garlic and onion. I  upped the marinade ingredients to 1 1/2 times and used wet mustard, garlic cloves and celery instead of powder forms . Not quite chinese food but very tasty

This pot roast was good, but even with doubling the spices (I did cut down on soy since hubby and I have high blood pressure)there was simply no Chinese flavor to it. Maybe a LOT more ginger, more garlic, some red pepper flakes and green onions added at the end would have helped.  It just came out plain pot roast, at best.

Try using garlic powder instead of salt and the lite soy sauce. This should cut the sodium considerably. I have not used this recipe but have altered many others due to my own sodium restricted diet.

Very tasty and I will definitely make this again. This was so simple and the meat turned out tender and fell apart. The flavors I thought were most dominant were the black pepper (I used fresh ground) and soy. I browned this is a skillet and then transferred it to a 8x8 baking dish and covered it with aluminum foil. My husband isn't a fan of soy sauce and he really liked this roast. The leftovers reheated very well too. Thanks for a great meal!

I made this for my mother's birthday dinner last weekend, and it was wonderful. Several reviewers used less soy sauce, but instead, I just added another cup of water. I was also out of celery seed. A few potatoes, celery, carrots, quartered onions and fresh mushrooms were added for the last hour. The meat and vegetables were removed to rest for about 20 minutes while the gravy was made. The roast served with crisp lightly steamed brocoli florets, mashed potatoes, and fresh fruit salad.

The family loved it. There will be a next time!!

My wife pulled the first package out of the freezer, and low and behold, it was a RUMP ROAST! Being honest, not my favourite cut of beef. We had organic bok choy from our CSA so she challenged me to do an Asian inspired meal. Naturally, allrecipes.com was my first stop!

I followed the recipe....mostly. After reading the first 20 or so reviews, I reduced the amount of soya sauce to 1/2 and put in a 1/4 cup of sesame oil instead. I doubled the ginger and used two LARGE cloves of organic garlic instead. I also used a TBSP of Keen's Hot Mustard as I did not find the dry mustard until after when I was digging for the other spices.

I have to remind myself that a rump roast does not the same texture as a pot roast but I found the meat a bit tough (SO HERE IS MY REASON FOR 4 STARS). I used a SST dutch oven but lowered the heat to 285F for 4 hours and then increased it to 375F for the last 20 minutes so that the braising fluid was at a rolling boil for the gravy part. DO NOT use all the liquid to make the gravy or you will be reducing it down for 30 minutes. I used about half and had plenty.

Changes for next time:
1. Use fresh minced ginger instead of ground. 2. Add even more garlic. 3. Further cut back to 1/3 cup of soya sauce.

I would like to give this 4.5 stars, but I will have to settle.  The cooking method yields a tender, flavorful, fall-off-the-bone roast.  However, I did not really get a "Chinese" flavor from this.  It's certainly different, and it tastes good, but it's not marvelous, and somehow it misses for me.  But what does my American palate know?  Good idea, but it needs some tweaks for me to call this Chinese.  (I used my cast iron dutch oven to cook this.)

Awesome! Especially leftovers, a little more flavor the next day. Garlic minced instead of garlic salt, and a little more ginger.

We really liked this roast. Had a one and a half pound roast and adjusted the recipe accordingly.  Next time I will use a bigger roast so there are more left overs. May cut the water and soy sauce a little next time because it did make a lot of gravy/sauce. Thanks for posting.

I made this not only for my family but my inlaws too & everyone absolutely loved it!!!  I paired it with brown rice & California medley veggies. I did change out two of the ingredients though. Instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder & instead of regular soy sauce I used Tamari. The roast is gone but there is sauce left that will be used later this week for maybe chicken!!! I highly recommend this recipe!!!!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I had all 3 kids asking for seconds and saying I should give this 5 stars for sure.  Was a nice surprise that something a bit different and that I was a bit hesitant to try turned out to be such a great success!  Thank you for posting this recipe - delicious :)

I don't think I'm a huge fan of pot roast, but bf really liked this.  I cut the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and used garlic powder and minced fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Otherwise, I left it the same.  At first I was worried the gravy wouldn't thicken at all, but after about 10-15 minutes, it did.  It's a concentrated flavor for gravy, but it does taste relatively good.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was a nice change for a pot roast dinner!  I used the ingredients as shown.  I cooked it in the Instant Pot so a few adjustments were made.  I used only half of the cooking marinade and used the 30 min meat setting to pressure cook.  The roast was then left on the keep warm setting for about 3 hours til we were ready to eat.  The meat was fall apart tender and had a very good flavor.  The gravy from the drippings was super peppery.  We ate it with rice & broccoli, so it did remind us a bit of Chinese takeout beef & broccoli.  My husband and I used a little of the gravy but the teens would not use it.  It was just too spicy.  A few days later I made beef gravy from a little of the peppery gravy and some additional beef base and that together with the roast meat & rice was delicious. Thank you for sharing!

This was good. It is a great starter recipe. I think next time I want something more added to it to make it great. I made it in the slow cooker. There was a little too much pepper for my taste but it wasn't a bad meal over rice.

Delicious! I have been using recipes form allrecipes.com for about a month now, and this has been my very favorite so far.  The only thing I changed was using just 1/2 cup of worchester sauce.  I also added baby carrots and beans to the dish when it had about an hour left in the oven. I served over white rice.  My family requested it again next week!

We really enjoyed this meat dish.  My husband says that because it was so good I didn't use a large enough cut of meat.  I will do this again as it had a lot better flavor than just plain.

Nice change from the usual pot roast. Used low sodium soy sauce and fresh garlic. The flavor is much more subtle than you would think from the list of ingredients. I served it with sugar snap peas and soba noodles cooked in the roast broth. Will make again!!

This was pretty good. Made as written other than I cooked it in my One Pot. Was enough for me to freeze half of the roast as well as the gravy for inner for another night. The wife did think the gravy was a little strong tasting however. I'm not sure if this is due to me cooking in the One Pot or not. Served it with creamed potatoes, corn and steamed broccoli.

I made this tonight pretty much as specified (I used 2 cups of water, lo sodium soy, and added a sliced onion and 8 oz of sliced mushroom 2 hours into the cook).  The sauce is an important part of this this recipe.  If you are concerned about salt:  you shouldn't go with this recipe, you can cut down by using lite soy and more crushed garlic instead of garlic salt.  A slow cooker approach will marry the flavors more-a great modify if you can't be doing the cook 3 hours prior to dinner.  Next time:  we want to add some bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, shiitake mushrooms to the mix during the last hour.  Really appreciate the effort to share with the rest of us.

This is the first recipe from allrecipes that I have made and no one cared for. Which is a surprise because I have been using the site for around ten years and prior to this never had a dud.  It was edible but just not good, the flavor wasn't a hit.

Excellent roast. Only changes I made were minor changes. I used chopped garlic and red wine vinegar and cooked in my crock pot. 

I will make this again and encourage others to try it.

Seared the roast and let it cook in the crock pot with all the juices. Way too much juice/sauce, it took extra corn starch to thicken up and I have  a half a gallon left over. Not a real problem as I will use some over rice and put some in the freezer to probably make a beef barley soup with. I did have not much of an oriental taste but it was still very good.

A FAVORITE! My family loves this dish. I cook it according to the recipe and it comes out delicious every time. Sometimes I'll throw in potatoes, carrots, onions, and/or celery. If I do, I make extra sauce to pour over everything, so it's all covered during cooking; otherwise the veggies soak up too much of the sauce and there's not enough to tenderize the meat. Enjoy!

Followed recipe exactly except I reduced the amount of ginger because my family nor I are big fans of ginger.  
The roast was very tasty but I found it to be a tiny bit too salty for me.  Next time I will try using a low sodium soy sauce.

This was delicious! My husband liked it so much he invited people over just so they could have some. I didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder, sea salt  and cracked pepper as the rub before I seared it. My husband almost wouldn't let me cook the whole roast so he could eat it like a medium rare steak just like that. But he would have been sorry if he had. I cooked my almost four pound chuck roast in my 7 qt crockpot and 3 cups of water was too much liquid. I used 1-1.5 cups of water and it turned out great!!  I added regular mustard to the sauce and used sesame oil in the pan and rice vinegar instead of white to add additional Asian flavors. Will definitely be making this again!

Love this recipe!  I used minced ginger instead of powder, dried onion flakes, sriracha and doubled the cornstarch mixture at the end. I used my ninja slow cooker on low for about 10hrs. It doesn't taste all that Chinese but it is super delish!

This is interesting.  I was looking for new ways to use chuck roasts from a side of beef and this intrigued me.  I wanted to use the crock pot, though, so I took the advice of previous reviewers and tossed everything (save the extra water/cornstarch) in the crock pot on low (I skipped the sear/brown because I'm lazy) and let it cook all day.  I also subbed 1/4C of worchestershire sauce for 1/4C of the water and used significantly less black pepper (and a dash of red).  It was pretty dry, so most people will probably want to make the accompanying gravy (we skipped it; just not gravy people).  It's tough to describe, but worth a try if you're looking for something different to use a chuck roast; it was fall apart/shreddy tender.  I served it over wild rice with roasted broccoli.  THANKS, for the recipe!

I made this following the directions exactly.  It was delicious and a big hit with my family.  Served it with jasmine rice and cabbage.  Will definitely be making this again.

So, so good.  Like others, I used garlic powder (but the same amount as called for because garlic is awesome) instead of garlic salt for the rub, and lower-sodium soy sauce.  I also added more ginger (ginger paste as sold in many produce sections is super convenient).  Served it up in a bowl with rice on the bottom, meat, steamed broccoli, and the gravy over top. I had never considered cooking a pot roast like this until I stumbled upon this recipe, but I don't know that I will ever make it differently from here on out.

This pot roast was found when looking for a taste out of the norm...glad we found it. The roast itself was tender and flavorful  from the soysauce based liquid. I would shorten the cooking time by about 10 minutes.  I used fresh ginger and  chopped a celery stalk. I also added to the liquid because my family loves sauces. The sauce reminded me of a thickened teriyaki sauce but not as sweet. We will eat this again.

This recipe is delicious!  A great twist on pot roast.  I also do in the crock pot!  My family loves it, rarely are there leftovers.

This is a delicious pot roast and a nice change from a more traditional roast!  I made it for Sunday dinner and served it over homemade mashed potatoes.  It was a huge hit with the family!  

I followed the recipe as instructed.  Once I made the gravy the saltiness from the soy sauce was a little overwhelming for me.  I added another tablespoon of honey and grated an additional teaspoon of fresh ginger into the pan.  That really made a difference. 

We will certainly be having this in our home again!  Thanks for sharing!

I cut back the soy sauce & used Kikoman's Lite Soy Sauce to keep the sodium down, All other ingredients as listed.  Superb!  This is the first time I've made a roast that didn't taste like ho-hum roast!  I didn't bother searing it, just whisked ingredients together and poured them over the roast in the crock pot; Cooked on low for 5-6 hours; Then thickened the sauce as instructed.  Will be making this again & again =D  Thank you for the recipe!

A lot of ingredients for not much flavor.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and used only 1 tsp black pepper otherwise followed directions exactly.  I might try again, using less water

this was ok for us...not terrible, but just not quite for us.  the soy sauce gravy is very strong. i did not stray from the original recipe as this was the first time making, besides using low sodium soy.  thanks for the post JDONNELLON :-)

Really, really good. I would've rated it 4.5 stars but it's not an option!  Like others, I did mine in a crock pot overnight which made it extremely tender (great for someone like me who's prone to overcooking meat!).  I also used the recommended amount of soy sauce and didn't find it to be too much, though it was reduced-sodium. Yum!

I can only give this recipe 3 stars until I get a chance to make it again and alter the seasoning.  My husband and I like spicy food.  The black pepper was VERY heavy-handed.  I checked the recipe 3 times to verify I was putting in a whole tablespoon.  The meat was very moist and the gravy is nice.  I also had to double the cornstarch and water because the gravy wouldn't thicken until I did.  
I will make this again and probably cut the black pepper in half.

I read the reviews and cut the soy to 1/4 cup, used fresh galic and cut the water to 1 cup. I added some sriracha to spice it up and give it a little heat and added a little more honey. It was still, to my taste, too salty. I also added some sour cream to the sauce after the cornstarch and water, this helped with the salty taste. In the future I think I will cut the salt out of the initial browning. My husband thought it was great.

Very enjoyable.  I used stew meat instead of a roast, cut the bake time to 1 hr @325 and 1 hr @200, tripled the spices, used 1 C reduced sodium soy sauce and ZERO water and still needed to add some flour to thicken gravy.  You can add water or broth at that point, depending on how many veggies you need gravy over, but there was way over and above for just the meat.
