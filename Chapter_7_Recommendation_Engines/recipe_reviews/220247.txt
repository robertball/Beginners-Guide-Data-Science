Added fresh asparagus, chicken breast strips, and spring onions, this casserole was super filling and yummy.

Yum! My mom used to make a similar casarole with broccoli when I was a kid. Me and my mom both loved this! I even got my 7 y/o to try it and she liked it too, until she realized it was a vegetable. I will definitely be making this yummy, quick and easy dish.
