4 pans?  Eh.  I agree with the comments about the mess, and personally think that each pot being so "sterile" leaves a whole lotta flavor out of this equation.  So I did it with two pots -- one for the boiling of pasta, and the second for everything else.  Cook the chicken and peppers FIRST, in a large skillet.  Drain a little fat, if you want, and then directly add the cream/herb mixture.  Cook that down.  When the pasta is almost ready (about 1 minute short of finish), drain it and add it to the skillet.  Mix all that love up together.  Hot and luscious -- you'll be eating all your flavors from one pan, instead of rinsing much of the taste down the drain.  Other than the prep style, I thought the ingredients worked really well -- thank you!

WHOOO-HOOOO!!! This one's a winner! I read the reviews before I made mine, and here's what I did: I preheated my large skillet nice n hot (just before the olive oil in it started to smoke). Then, I added the diced chicken. As the chicken started to cook, I added salt & pepper (a fair amount). 


While the chicken was going, I heated 2 cups of heavy cream and 2 T butter. I didn't have a drop of milk in the house, and I didn't want to use a whole stick of butter, so... there ya go. :)


Now, back to the chicken: About halfway through the cooking, I tossed in 3 healthy cloves of minced garlic, 2 diced scallions, 1/2 green pepper, and 1/2 yellow pepper (no red in the store that day).


I also used 1 cup of Parm instead of 2/3 (all you cheese lovers out there know what I'm talkin' about, wink, wink). And I doubled the dried spices, while omitting the chives (didn't have any, and I had already used fresh scallions anyway).


This dish is absolutely wonderful. For those who noted a bland taste, I would recommend seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper, and also tossing in garlic AND scallions along with the peppers while chicken is still cooking. Doing this allows the flavor of all these wonderful veggies to enhance the chicken and the entire dish. 

I reheated this one stove top the next day: I poured about 1/5 cup of chicken broth into a sauce pan. Then, I added the Chicken Rotini and stirred occasionally while cooking it over medium low to medium heat. Tastes fresh!

Killer. It's like a snooty Chicken Helper. I did add fresh garlic, one sliced onion and half a package of fresh mushrooms because I didn't have enough chicken. I sprinkled just a touch of crushed red pepper flake in the sauce. Very, very good. (My husband thought it was too rich, so next time I might see if I can't slim it down a bit. He also suggested I try this with rock shrimp.)

My daughter called and wanted me to make pasta for dinner. I searched the database and come up this recipe.  I added a good "dose" of garlic and I sauted the chicken (I used 3 breasts) with the peppers and added garlic, onion and mushrooms.  It was sooooooo good.  Even my 5 year old ate it.  I only added a 1/2 tsp of cornstarch to get the sauce to thicken.  I will be using this recipe again and again. Thanks for sharing Terry!

Pretty tasty stuff...and that's saying something since I have a terrible cold and can hardly taste anything! My boyfriend in particular really liked this dish. The only downfall is the 4 pots/pans you have sitting on your stovetop just to make this! Oh well, the taste was good. If you think you can handle it-try cooking the chicken/peppers at the same time your letting your sauce thicken.  That way, your noodles, chicken and sauce are done at almost the same time, resulting in a hot meal! The only change I made was to add a dash of garlic/onion powder to the sauce when whisking in the other spices and while sauting the chicken/bell peppers-added some minced onion/garlic and some fresh sliced mushrooms. Tasty stuff Terry!

I'm giving this 4 stars because had I followed the recipe I know this would've tasted great.  I made this uusing low fat ingredients and it was very bland.  So live a little and use cream and butter.

I'm sorry, but this was not good. What a strange way to make a cream sauce. It was way too buttery (1/2 a cup of butter?!) and didn't mix well. I added some flour to help it thicken, but the flavor was just off. My husband ate it, but I couldn't. Sorry.

This was very good. I used fat free half and half and added a little cornstarch. My company still had not arrived when it was done so I threw it all in a casserole dish in the oven at 300. This thickened it up more. When I served it we sprinkled freshly grated parmesan cheese on top. Yum!

Awesome basic recipe from which you can make changes based on personal preference.  I just made this for dinner, and my husband and I literally could not stop eating it.  I added onions, garlic and salt and pepper to the chicken and substituted mushrooms for the peppers.  Also used one full cup of the cheese.  Excellent!

This is reminded me of an alfredo sauce with chicken and peppers.  Also, you can prepare this in two pans, not four! One for the Rotini, and one for everything else. Gives it more flavor that way. The only thing i changed is i added salt and pepper to the chicken while it cooked and some freah chopped garlic tossed in with the bell peppers. I expected more flavor out of it tho.. and more parm cheese would only make it taste more like alfredo..

Good start, needs tweaking. Next time I need to REALLY reduce the sauce (had way too much liquid after 20 minutes). Also going to follow other member suggestions: double the veg, **4x** the spices, more chicken, and cook all but the pasta in one pan! This is a lovely dish, just needs some extra umph! :)

This was good, but I of course did my own thing by doubling the spices and only using two pans among other things. Thanks for sharing!

I used fresh basil and oregano, so I tripled the amount.   1/2 teaspoon of fresh parsley is way too light.  In all my years of cooking I have never seen such a small quantity of fresh parsley.   So I did 2 tablespoons will maybe 2 1/2.   I also waited to put the parsley in,  you want the residual heat to cook the parsley just before serving.   I know it was good because the leftovers were gone by the next morning.

I loved this dish!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 as DH doesn't care for leftovers and it is just the 2 of us.  I added some garlic powder and salt.  Next time I will throw in some mushrooms, or at least fix them on the side for me as DH doesn't like them.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was delicious - after I added some spices, otherwise, it would have been pretty bland.  This was so easy, I will add this recipe to my favorites list.

This recipe was okay, but was rather bland.  If I make it again, I think I'll add garlic or pepper to give it a bit more flavor.

This casserole is really good! I love chicken and this was easy to make and I will be making it again. I only had green pepper and no red but I just put twice the amount of green and it was fine. My husband really liked it too.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe, but thought it could use a little something more.  I made as directed, with the exception of cooking the chicken with some chicken grill seasoning.  Even so, it could have used more garlic, more herbs in the sauce, etc.  A dash of red pepper flake might have been nice, too.  I would say that the only thing that was excessive was the butter.  That said, it was simple and we ate it :)

Delicious! Like a previous reviewer suggested, I cooked the chicken in the sauce to add more flavor. Everyone loved this dish and was raving about it for the rest of the night. I will definitely make this again!

My only complaint of this dish was that it never thickened up. I have to say, though, that everyone was happy to lap up their spiral "soup". Very flavorful and good. I skipped the chives and used just a red pepper because that's what I had. I only used half the butter called for, and low-fat half-and-half (oops...accidentally bought that one at the store) and a full cup of a grated parmesan, asiago, and romano mix(another oops at the store). It was amazing. I hate rating a recipe after making so many changes, but now that we already tried it this way I don't know if my family will allow me to try the original recipe!

This recipe is easy and very good. I never have heavy cream so I needed to use milk. Due to timing I needed to put it in the oven to keep warm for dinner. The 15 minutes in the oven evaporated enough of the milk to thicken it and crisped up the top which really was a hit with the kids. I did use an oven safe skillet. I also added one chicken bouillion cube to my milk/ butter mixture for some extra flavor. I have made this 3 times in 2 weeks and it is gone by the second day.

It's a little time-consuming chopping all the vegetables, but everything else was quite easy from there! Provides a delicious end result; I shredded the chicken and used tricolor rotinis. Definitely a repeat dish.

My husband and I really liked this dish. Like many, I only used two pans--one for pasta and one for everything else. Added some chicken rub to the chicken prior to cooking and used whole wheat rotini. May add pepper next time for a tad more flavor.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make when I need comfort food and a quick meal.  I usually make a little extra sauce though, otherwise the pasta soaks up the sauce and the leftovers can be a little dry.

My husband complimented this so it must be good since he only makes and likes gourmet meals.  It was quick and easy too.

I've been on a health binge lately, and was really craving SOMETHING with chicken and bell peppers..Did an internet search, and luckily, ran across this. After I finished cooking, I tasted it before serving it to my three (male) roommates.  I ran thru the house shouting that I could finally cook! My roommates in turn agreed to clean the house for a week. They were so happy that I cooked something not just edible, but absolutely delicious!!

Like others, didn't see any reason for multiple pots. We browned the chicken with a little sliced red onion and the bell peppers.  Added two crushed cloves of garlic and the herbs.  Then poured in a pint of heavy cream and let that come to a simmer before stirring in the parmesan.  Very rich tasting and very tasty over the rotini.

I really enjoyed making this recipe, as updated by CHEFSINGLEDAD so that it is cooked/combined in one pot. My half and half went bad so I substituted 1/2 whipping cream and one half skim milk to yummy result. The amount of butter freaked me out but I went for it. Was very rich and tasty and not too buttery.

My tips:
- Salt generously. That was the only thing the recipe needed per our three reviewers. I would taste right before serving and salt at that point. I did salt the chicken when sauteing (and used the salted butter) but it wasn't enough.
- Use one extra bell pepper. The peppers cooked PERFECTLY after pre-sauteing, and we wanted more more more!

Otherwise, was PERFECTO. My family was impressed, and my eight year old had thirds!

I took the advice of the other reviews and used just two pans. Overall this recipe was very yummy and even my picky youngest ate everything on his plate!

This was a good quick weeknight meal. I too didn't use four pans: one to boil the pasta, and one for everything else (chicken/veggies, then sauce ingredients, then mix everything together in it to serve). The sauce was pretty good but for using so much butter/cream/cheese it wasn't very rich tasting: definitely not an alfredo flavor, and not something I would spend so much in ingredients/calories on. In the future I would probably sub broth and a can of cream soup, or broth and some cream cheese. Definitely add more peppers/veggies. I only used 3 breasts with the written amount of pasta/sauce, and added 2 whole peppers right off the bat, and still thought there were too few. A nice dinner, thanks for sharing.

So this was very good and I would definitely make it again, but it was a bit bland. I added paprika on top when i ate it, as well as salt and pepper, but it still needed something. More cheese? Something spicy? Im not sure, but I'll play with this recipe.

This recipe is delicious. The only addition I had was to dice up some roma tomates and add it to the pasta at the very end. Even my picky son cleaned his plate! I will definitely make this again.

This was great, would probably have been better if I had a whisk to use in my good pots to make the sauce.  Next time!

This was okay, sauce was extremely runny, so I would suggest thickening it up with some flour before adding it to your dish. A little bland but after some garlic powder it turned out decent. Not really a family favorite though...

This is excellent! I did add onion and garlic powder as well as a pinch of hot red pepper, and it was yummmy. I highly recommend making a loaf of Jo's Rosemary Bread, which available here, to eat with it. The bread is the perfect compliment to this dish.

It is very hard to find a meal that myself and all my picky eaters at home will enjoy.  This one was a real crowd pleaser!  Added a little garlic powder (which I always do with my Alfredo Sauce) for more zing.  Would never have thought to put peppers in it, but it tasted great and I got to sneak in some veggies on the kids!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Like many others, I only used 2 pots: 1 for the pasta and 1 for everything else. I also doubled the peppers, added chopped onion and sliced mushrooms and salt and pepper. It was good, but it needed more flavour. I think some fresh garlic at the beginning and fresh basil at the end would go a long way with this dish.

This recipe is very good. We will definitly be making it again. Also, I agree with chefsingledad on his point of using only two pans. It works just fine that way.

I thought this was pretty darn good. I have to agree with CHEFSINGLEDAD though, hence only four stars. Four pans are unnecessary. I chose to use the same pan and it turned out great. My family just ate it up and loved it. I did not use the green and red peppers as our family doesn't like them, but I did add in some ground black pepper. Also, I didn't have any half and half on hand, so I used an equal amount of evaporated milk instead.

Pretty good- this is basically like an alfredo sauce with chicken and peppers.  I used two whole peppers because I'm always for adding more veggies and used fat free evaporated milk instead of the half and half.  Also, this recipe CAN be made in two pans, not four!  One for pasta, and one for everything else.

Easy and good.  A real family favorite or a great dish to enjoy with friends. I did as the pervious posters suggusted and did the chicken first, I did set it aside and cook up the sause just beause my pan wouldn't have been big enough to hold it all.  I also added about 3/4 teaspoon chopped gaarlic to the chicken.

I thought this was only okay. It's kind of a lot of chopping and grating and busy work, and the end result is just so-so.  An acceptable dinner, but nothing very exciting. My family found the flavor to be pretty bland. Will not be making again. Sorry!

This recipie was absolutely wonderful!!!!  I did make a few changes while making it based on the comments!   I found them quite handy so I thought I would share.  I cooked the chicken in the oven to begin with.  This way when I went to cut it up it shredded into the consistancy I wanted.  I then melted some butter in a fry pan and thew in the chicken, pepeper, spices, and garlic.  While that was cooking together I put the butter and cream in a saucepan and cooked it up.  When that had boiled a few minutes I threw the ck. mixture into the sauce.  When the noodels finished up I therw the sauce on top.  This way if I wanted alot of sauce I could add as much as I wanted.  It turned out GREAT!!  I will definately continue to make this recipie!

Delicious!  This was such a tasty recipe.  I did tweak a few things. I doubled the parmesean cheese and added salt, red pepper flakes and 3 cloves of garlic.  I used 1/2 cup of fresh basil instead of dried basil.

Needless to say this was a hit with my family....the kids are on their 2nd bowl as I type!  I, too, added garlic powder, generous amounts of S&P and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I then tossed the sauce and pasta in a baking dish and mixed in some shredded Italian cheese blend, topped with more Parmesean and baked at 325 for about 10-15 mins to thicken everything up.  My 4 year old son "helped" make this and he is so proud!  Thanks Terry for a new recipie!

The name of the recipe implies a one pot kinda deal, not so! Other than the mountain of dishes, pretty good. I added some mushrooms, onions and broccoli with the peppers to suit my family's tastes. Yum.

I made this for some friends. I got off work at 5:15 at was leaving my house with it at 10 minutes of 6:00. It fed four adults, without any side items, and my friends liked it so much, they made it for other guests two nights later.

Way too much FAT (butter)...and I'm really sick of the 4 & 5 star ratings when everyone says: BUT I added this and that and then fried or grilled or baked instead and I baked at lower or higher temp...etc.  RATE the recipe as written & then if you add extra's say so!!!  Don't rate a recipe AFTER you've fixed it by ADDING all your extra's!!!

My only change was using Italian, rather than regular parsley, since this is a pasta dish. My son and I really enjoyed it but we both thought it would be even better with more herbs. Will up the herb amounts for next time.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made the sauce like a basic cheese sauce. I added the extra seasonings and used Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  I also added garlic with the sauteed peppers .  I used pre-cooked turkey breast instead of the chicken.  Good!

We have some extremely picky eaters in my family, but everyone loved this!  Tons of flavor and very kid-friendly.  I would suggest doubling the sauce if you like your pasta to be covered rather than coated.  Excellent dish.

The kids loved it!  Good way to use up leftover roasted chicken.  A lot of cream and butter, but I think that's what makes it work.   Took Chefsingledad's advice and saved myself some dishes!

I made this tonight and only used 2 pots ;) boiled the pasta in one and throw everything else in the fry pan, when the pasta was almost done I added it the the fry pan and let simmer for a couple minutes. I used onions insteads of scallions, doubled the spices, used half the butter, extra cheese, and cut up rotisery chicken instead of chicken breast. Hubs loved it, will make again!

4 stars for the idea, but there's no way I'm getting that many pots dirty for a weeknight meal.  I cooked the chicken in a dutch oven, added onions, garlic, and mushrooms.  When that was all cooked, I added the cream, and double the spices.  When that boiled I turned the hear down and added the cheese.  Once that was melted in and smooth, I stirred the hot cooked pasta in along with 1/2 a bell pepper and some broccoli.  I covered the pot, and let the whole thing sit on low for 10 mins, then ate.  The sauce was quite thin (I did let it simmer for about 15 mins before adding the cheese), but when I mixed in the pasta it spread through and stuck to the pasta, and worked quite well.

The whole family loved this recipe.  I did reduce the # of pans by boiling the water in one pan, & cooking the chicken & veggies in another pan.  When the pasta was done, I drained it & made the sauce in the pasta pan, then mixed it all together in the pan with the chicken & vegies.  I also used a while red pepper instead of 1/2 red & 1/2 green because it's what I had on hand.  Everything was delicious!

Really good!  Everyone loved it.  

Cooked the chicken and peppers first with salt, pepper, minced garlic and scallions.  Then added the ingredients for the creamy herb sauce.  Added the parm at the last 5 minutes (raised it to 1 cup) then tossed all with the rotini.  Awesome!  Next time will add more vegetables.

Not a big fan of this one. The sauce was bland and it had an odd consistency. I tried to add garlic to the chicken while it was browning, but it didn't really help. I wanted to like this, but no one in the family really cared for it.

Great recipe!  It dirties alot of pots, but it's well worth it!  I added sea salt, fresh ground pepper and a healthy dose of cayenne pepper (we like spice) to the chicken while it cooked, and for the sauce I added 1 cup of parmesan, and fresh basil along with the required ingredients.  I also added two chopped green onions along with the peppers.

Meh. I'm surprised this made it into Allrecipes' "Tried & True" Quick & Easy Favorite's cookbook (sorry!). This was quite mediocre. Just like Lampchop's Mom suggested, this is basically a "snooty" version of Chicken Helper. I was really hoping for a great tasting update of a childhood favorite (yes, I LOOOVED all the Helpers - beef, chicken tuna), but this was bland, bland, bland! I even s&p'd my chx. REALLY well, add. 1 sm. chopped onion & 3 cloves of minced garlic. As many have advised (thanks!), I too used only 2 pans. I can't see the pt. in using 3 sparate pans PLUS a casserole dish (my gosh!) - just boil your pasta, and, while it's cooking, brown your chx./veggies 2gether, add the sauce ing., bring to a gentle boil, reduce as directed and then add the cooked pasta and voila! One thing to note: Fresh herbs can be $$$, esp. if you're on a budget (and my herb picking/garden season is long gone here in the "Windy City"). The $'s spent on fresh chives (parsley was relatively inexpensive, but chives were $1.99) was a waste when considering how much I actually used! One more thing to note: I wish I would have mix. all of my sauce ing. 2gether (in a bowl, w/ a whisk) B4 add. to the skillet. The cheese part was kinda grainy. Served w/ garlic butter crescents, this was a decent meal, but nothing to rave about. My fiance & I didn't even have 2nd's or save the leftovers :( Thx. anyways!

Pretty good!  I didn't have peppers, so I used onions and frozen broccoli/ cauliflower, sauteing the onions with the chicken and then tossing in the frozen vegetables at the end (put a lid on it, they steamed nicely and even caramelized a little--and they could also be added to the pasta at the end of the boiling, two birds with one stone).  My half-and-half separated as soon as it heated, so I ended up thickening the sauce with a little flour/water before pouring it over. Though it wasn't creamy, it tasted fine. I added minced garlic in with the herbs, and the sauce didn't look pretty but it smelled heavenly.  Then our dinner guest was a little late, so I put it in the oven topped with mozzarella to stay hot.  Everyone liked it, most people had seconds, though if I make it again I'm going to add a lot more seasoning.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! My husband is NOT a fan of casseroles, but this is a little bit more like a pasta dish than a "casserole". (We're from The South where anything called a "Casserole" is mixed with mayo or COMS and covered in a layer of crumbled crackers with tons of cheese and baked for a while.) 

I made this for him and his bandmates one evening this week and it received stellar reviews!! It's perfect for the spring/summer because it's so light tasting. The flavor of the basil and bell peppers mixed ... that's trick, I think!

I changed a couple of things. I followed one reviewer's idea of using only two pans -- one for boiling the pasta and the other for everything else. Excellent idea. Who wants to wash an extra two pots?!

And I also added a dose of garlic to the chicken and bell pepper while it cooked. (Maybe ~1/2 tsp.) 

This will definitely be a repeat at our house! Yum!!

I thought this dish was excellent.  I cook a lot and it didn't seem to be a ton of work but I did have a stack of dishes at the end...not a huge surprise with a pasta entree.  Anyhow, I added quite a little garlic and fresh mushrooms.  I wish I would have added cornstarch because it was a little thin.  Also, just a word of caution, if you follow the directions exactly, the noodles and chicken will be sitting quite a while and will likely be cool by the time the sauce is done cooking (which takes quite a while).  Try to cook as much at once as possible or put the cooked portions someplace to keep them warm.

This was wonderful!  I made it again for guests.  I thought it was easy to make and well worth the bit of chopping effort.  I added mushrooms,onion and garlic.  My guests ALL wanted a copy of the recipe.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe, we will make this again! This is definitely not a casserole, but more like a chicken alfredo with peppers. I didnt have any green onions, still came out fine. I saw that many said there wasnt enough sauce so I altered the recipe. It was set for four, and I set it to 5, and used one less chicken breast/noodle serving. Definitely had enough sauce. Thanx for the recipe Terry!

So, I basically made a version of this based on the reviews. I did the 2 pan method, because who wants to wash all those pans? I added garlic salt and pepper to my chicken, and used all fresh herbs and WAY increased the amounts (a few tablespoons of each). Cooked the chicken first, then added in the peppers, then the half and half and butter (which, next time I think I could get away with not including), let that reduce and then when the pasta was done, took the sauce off the heat, added in the cheese and herbs, then tossed everything together after draining the pasta. Doing it this way yielded a fast, easy, tasty dinner with half the clean up.

I read many reviews before trying this because I was concerned about boiling half & half. The sauce seperated ruining the dish. The only reason I gave this 2 stars was because it did have good flavor and I will make this again but will be using my tried and true method.

Family loved it.   just make sure you make the sauce first before putting the pasta into the water so that it has time to cool properly.

I don't know what a quarter cup of butter did to the recipe so next time I'll cut that in half. Otherwise it  was good; I made the chicken breasts separately because I like them crispy and served atop the pasta, my preference. I also sprinkled garlic salt whilst cooking them. I had lemon thyme in the garden so added some of that as well, but it would be good as written.

I liked how easy this recipe was.  I only used two pots - one for the pasta and an iron skillet for everything else.  I've made this recipe twice, and one thing I've noticed is both times the cream sauce starts out great, but then it separates and becomes blobs, while although is still edible, it is not attractive.  I'm thinking I should not have left the finished product on the stove after adding the cream sauce and that perhaps contributed to its breakdown.  Very tasty however!

Read reviews: Use two pans, one for boiling pasta, the other to cook chicken and prepare sauce.  Will use leftover, rotisserie, or Purdue shortcuts so chicken will be seasoned sufficiently. Simmer FF half and half with half of the butter suggested in recipe!  In addition to onions and peppers, add tiny broccoli florets or peas for color. Could also use bagged onion and pepper to expedite. Try for the boys.

The ingredients are great, (though I feel it needs onion and garlic), but the prep method is ridiculous, and probably resulted in the blandness of the taste.  I think this recipe would be better if prepared in a Dutch oven, then the cooked pasta added, and allowed to sit for a bit before serving.

This is awesome as is, however my daughter suggested maybe adding broccoli next time. I made an error and added the cheese to the butter/cream mixture while it was still cooking.  It did not ruin anything. 2 thumbs up from this house!

I used two pans. One for pasta, one for the rest. I used pre-cooked chicken and a bag of onions and peppers for the veggies. I used almond milk and neufchatal cream cheese in place of half and half. Easy and tasted good, but the leftovers were dry and not as good. That may have been my substitutes, so my rating doesn't reflect that part.

super easy to make sauce really made the whole dinner come together.  I did add more cheese and mixed veggies to make it a heartier meal ( I have a 17yoa boy) he ate two huge helpings.  Would add pepper to the ingredients next time.  And will def add mushrooms and other veggies next time as well.

It was hearty, colorful and delicious. I knew there would be some clean up so I snuck in other time savers. I used pre-chopped red, yellow and green bell pepper from Walmart fresh grocery. My few tweaks worked out very well. I sautéed garlic in a small amount of oil before adding the chicken and I added a small can of sliced black olives at the end. I also added a bit of red pepper flakes. The olives really took the dish up a notch. The flavors worked very well together. Family loved this one and I'd make it for a pot luck dish too.

I did add to this recipe - sliced mushrooms and cubed tomatoes. Everything else was the same. I did make my version of one portion, which I am very used to doing, being on my own. LOVED IT. I made enough for 2 and ate it all. It was excellent! I will make this again.Comfort food for sure.

This was delicious. I did follow some hints from other reviewers and I made some changes. I added a minced clove of garlic and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to the chicken. Also, to make it a bit healthier, I used 2% milk instead of the half-and-half, and I cut down the butter to a few tablespoons. To thicken the sauce, I added two tablespoons of flour before it boiled. That did the trick. I also increased the amount of fresh parsley to 2-3 Tbsps, and I added 1/2 tsp. of kosher salt. After everything was mixed together, I put it in the oven with some extra Parmesan cheese on top at 350 for 30 minutes. It was scrumptious. I usually don't make so many changes to a recipe but I'm glad I "enhanced" it a bit!

WAY too much work the way it's done! I added olive oil to my  deep chicken pan, and added the pasta to some salted boiling water. Cooked the chicken and veggies with garlic added to it. I added the cream and butter once the chicken browned, along with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch (or flour). and a cup of chicken broth. 
Simmer on low about 15 minutes and then add the pasta. 
MUCH easier and really, only one pan to wash.

I loved the recipe. However just for personal preferences I added spices to the chicken (sal, pepper, garlic, onion powder) added more parmesan cheese and instead of half and half I used heavy cream. It came out wonderful.

I'm sorry but I did not like this dish at all! The sauce would not thicken and the butter did not blend well at all. It also could have used some additional seasoning it was on the bland side all I could taste was the bell peppers.

My Fam loved this.  I cooked the chicken in a skillet with a generous sprinkle of salt and added the veggies. Once cooked I remove them from the pan and deglazed with 1 C of water.  Added 1 C half and half, Parmesan and herbs.  I used MRS dash garlic and herb and fresh basil.  I was asked to make it again.  Really yummy.

Halved the butter, doubled the pasta and parsley, substituted a green onion for the chives, boiled sauce in the chicken pan. Still good!

Loved this! It tasted great and was really easy to make, the only hiccups i had was i used drumsticks instead of breast, and coolwhip reduced with milk instead of half and half. Didnt have oregano, chives or bell peppers, but i had some broccoli and cauliflower that went in just great instead!

I used Italian Seasoning in a lesser amount for this dish to be more palatable for the kids. I also mixed the ingredients in the large pot in which I made the pasta. Then, I poured it into the casserole dish and served.

It was too much dry seasoning. the basil oregano and parsley all together gives it a dry kind of taste... it turned out nice but next time I'll probably use a dash of an Italian seasoning instead of the three different one.

This was quick, tasty and filling as a one dish dinner. I did not alter the recipe at all - and it was delicious as followed.  I delivered this casserole along with a roll of french bread to my friends family during a difficult week.

This was a family favorite and my 3 youngest even cleaned their plates.  Made quite a mess in the kitchen but I think I'll take advice from some of the other reviews next time.

This wasn't my favorite recipe, I made it as directed, and felt like it needed salt, or was missing something.  HOWEVER, I'm giving it four stars because my husband loved it, and thought it was perfect.

Pretty good, and I will make this again.  I did make changes after reading reviews.  Half way through cooking the chicken I added 3 diced scallions, a dash of garlic powder, 1/3 cup diced red and green pepper (pre-sauteed, that I keep in the freezer), and 1 1/2 cups chopped broccoli.  I also generously seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper.  Very tasty, my husband doesn't like casseroles, ate 2 huge helpings!!!

I made this dish using homemade fresh pasta, substituted half-and-half for Fat Free evaporated milk and forgot to add the chives and parsley but did add ¼ tsp of Italian seasoning.  My family loved the dish.  Although, I didn't combine the fresh pasta in the creamed chicken sauce, I served it over it instead.  To round this meal off we had fresh bread and fresh blueberries with water since there’s Parmesan which is more salty.  I would have to disagree with other reviews in regards to blandness.  But again everyone’s palate is different.  Godere!
