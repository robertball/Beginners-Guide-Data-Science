We made this recipe last night to go with some taco soup that I had made in the slow cooker.  Normally I would use a Jiffy Cornbread recipe because I've been too scared to try making cornbread "from scratch." I followed the recipe with one small modification: yellow cornmeal.  I did not have white cornmeal to use.

I didn't have a lot of time to get this made because I was working with it last minute. The recipe was so easy to follow which is a huge factor for me.  It had a reasonable amount of ingredients and doesn't require three hours of stirring, kneading and other various baking terms I didn't have time for.

It made a HUGE skillet full.  Very thick. So delicious and I don't even like cornbread! Hubby loved it and apparently so did the sugar ants.  I am adding this to my "kid tested, mother approved" file.

So tasty! I made a half recipe in my 6 inch Pyrex dish, turned out crispy on the edges and very flavorful and moist. I did change the method a bit...I added the cornmeal to the wet ingredients first, then did the other steps; I find the texture in the finished product to be more acceptable to DBF. Cast iron would have made it better, but that's a lotta leftover cornbread :) thank you for sharing this awesome recipe from your other mom, Nandabear!

This was different than other cornbread I've made.  The cornmeal, flour ratio especially.  With that, it's much more "gritty" than the recipes with similar amounts.  'Not a bad thing necessarily, just something I noticed.  I added less sugar, 1/4c.  A third would not have been too much though.  As cornbread, I like other recipes better; as the base for cornbread dressing, I think this is our winner.  :)  Something else I noticed, this sizzles when it's done.  Weird with only a quarter cup oil.  Other recipes that have more fat, don't.  Huh.  This bakes with slight brown patches near the edge & a flat (not rounded) top.

I added a little more sugar and frozen corn that I heated a little in the microwave. Also used butter instead of oil.

Easy & delicious!  Tastes just like the cornbread they serve at one of my favorite restaurants in Laguna Beach!  My whole family loved it!

This was pretty good, but a little on the dry side. The hot oil in the pan also pooled up over the top of my batter after I poured it into the pan, which resulted in the center top getting a little too brown. Tasted good, but I was hoping to get a better photo of the recipe. I served this with chili and a bit of butter on the cornbread, which helped with the dryness.

I really enjoyed this cornbread and it took me back to my Mother's kitchen. I'm a country girl at heart and this recipe is just what I needed. I will be making this when ever I need my fix of cornbread.

This makes a scrumptious and versital corn bread.  As Nandabear has said it can be used a varity of ways.  I can imagine all kinds of add-ins.  It reminds me of my grandma's cornbread which was a regular on her table.  I will be making this my go to recipe.

Cornbread is not, as we say, "the food of my people." I never had it as a child. But I've eaten my share of it, and recently moved to Texas so I wanted to try to make it.  I had a very specific idea of what I wanted: something very slightly sweet but coarse, crumbly enough to make a mess but firm enough to take some butter. 
I made this exactly as stated but I used about part butter and part oil. I guess about 3 tbsp butter and 1 of oil.  
It was exactly what I was looking for. I now have a big problem. There are only two of us - and neither of us needs to eat 1/2 a pan of cornbread with butter and honey. But this was easy and delicious. 
That should be our biggest problem in life.

Yummy!!!!! Not too sweet. I've made cornbread before that should have been called sweet corn cake. This does have a little sweetness (obviously from the sugar) but it's not too much like a dessert. Went great with vegetable beef soup from this site. Thanks so much!!!

I grew up with cornbread but never got around to making it myself, until tonight.  It was easy and really reminded me of growing up.  Recipe was spot on and even hubby liked it.  Now I will be looking for meals to have this with, other than pinto beans since DH is not fond of those.  Only adjustment I made was to use yellow corn meal as I didn't have white.  Next time I might add another teaspoon of sugar and I  think it would be great with corn or hot peppers.

The cornbread came out light and moist; it was very good. I skipped the sugar because one reviewer had found the recipe to be too sweet, and this worked out fine.  I also added corn kernels and minced jalapenos, and that worked well, too.

Really good! Much better than any store-bought mix.  We used less salt than the recipe called for  - most recipes are too salty for our tastes. This one's a keeper!

I’ve made this recipe countless times and it’s always a hit. This time, I didn’t have any red wine on hand so i just made it without and added a little more of the boullion. I cooked it on the stove for about 20 mins, then into the crockpot on high for 4 hours. It came out sooooo good! My 5 & 3 year old gobbled it up! Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Yes, this bread was a bit sweet but moist. Had several folks try it and all went for seconds. Didn’t use skillet but was golden and scrumptious. Will make it again but will add 1/2 cup of popped Amaranth.

I love sweet corn bread.  This is nice but not right.  Yellow cornmeal has more flavor.  Let the buttermilk hydrate the meal for about 2 hours.  You might need more buttermilk, up to one cup more.  Follow the rest and enjoy.  The photo shows an unbrowned bread.  Please replace it.

I'm about to make this for a 2nd time. The 1st time it came out great! I used yellow cornmeal as I couldn't find white, but it came out great! Such easy directions and I loved using my cast iron skillet!! It was a big hit with my husband too. Thanks for sharing!!

I used 1 can of sweetened condensed milk. Poored it into a 4 cup measurer and also poored into the measurer ordinary milk till I got 2 cups total. The cornbread was dense but very moist. It did not dry out when we ate the leftovers for the next couple of days. Made sure the skillet was in the centre of the oven to prevent the top from getting too brown. This went great with my wife's chilly!

I do not have a cast iron skillet so I just slightly preheated my muffin tin with some oil and baked for about 10 mins. I made 16 with the full recipe.
Quite yummy!

Just the wife and I and I'm the only one that likes corn bread. I cut the recipe in half and use a eight inch skillet. Bread like I remember it.  Very good. RS

Great recipe!! My only suggestion would be to add the dry ingredients in small batches to the wet ingredients so that the cornbread comes out light and fluffy.

I like a sweet cornbread, so next time I will use 1/2 cup sugar. Next time I may sub some of the sugar with honey. .  To get the crispest edges, put the iron skillet in the oven for 15 minutes, then add the oil and put the skillet back in oven for 2-3 min, then add the batter. This made a big difference.    I know it is done when the edges barely start to come away from the skillet, although the top may not be brown. Remember that the bread will continue to cook in the skillet so remove from skillet as soon as possible

Excellent...not too sweet with a nice texture and a perfectly browned crust on the bottom.  My favorite cornbread recipe so far!

My husband loved it!  He asked for cornbread with his chilli tonight so I made this.  I had to use yellow cornmeal as I could not find white.  Everything about this cornbread was superb.  The texture was light and moist, no "off" flavors, in other words, perfect.  Thank you Nandabear for sharing this wonderful recipe, I will be making it the next time someone asks for cornbread.
