I really think people who don't particularly like cauliflower would like this recipe...the balsamic vinegar and the caramelization from roasting add a nice sweetness.  Allow about an hour to marinate for maximum flavor and don't skip the step of lining your baking sheet with foil!

I made this almost exactly as is.  The only thing I did differently was add about half a head of garlic cloves, unchopped, instead of the diced garlic.  We love the flavor of roasted garlic, and the cloves mixed in with the cauliflower were a treat.  Will DEFINITELY make again!!

Be sure to cut the cauliflower small.  Allow it to marinate to absorb the maximum flavor.  You do need the foil in the pan because this is messy, but worth it.

Mine came out ok, and after reading reviews I can see what could have been done better. I should have marinated (not mentioned in the recipe), added a little more oil and left the garlic whole (finely chopped garlic 20 min on high definitely burns and becomes unsavory). I will try it again this way and see what happens!

This was pretty good - the balsamic was not too overpowering, but I needed to add a bit more oil in order to prevent the cauliflower from sticking.  Will make this again, but we do prefer roasting the cauliflower with just garlic, oil and a little parmesan.

This was fantastic!  I used broccoflower instead of plain cauliflower, because that's what I had on hand.  Since my head of broccoflower was rather large, I used 3 Tbs each of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and almost a full teaspoon of kosher salt.  I have the minced garlic in a jar, so I just plopped some of it into the bowl without measuring.  I'm sure I used more than three cloves' worth, but we really like garlic!  Twenty minutes was the perfect amount of time to roast this.  The broccoflower was tender, but still had a bit of a snap to it.  This went perfectly with my pot roast and salt and herb crusted roasted baby potatoes.

This is a very nice recipe but I did make a few additions to fit our taste. I used cauliflower, carrots and fresh mushrooms plus I added rosemary all together it was very yummy and I would make it again. The only problem I had was the cook time, my veggies were still crunchy so I had to cook them about 5 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.

What a revelation! My hubby really liked this and he doesn't care for cauliflower normally. Took others' advice and marinated it for a while, added whole peeled garlic cloves, red pepper and mushrooms. I used a very aged balsmic vinegar that is thick and sweeter than the cheaper kind and makes all the difference I think. Used cooking parchment instead of foil on the cookie tray (more environmentally friendly). Yummy and sweet. It's nothing like boiled or steamed. Can't go back now. Thank you.

Quite good!  Used nonstick aluminum foil and only half a head of cauliflower.  Maybe my cauliflower was huge, but I didn't actually think the dressing would have coated much more than that.  Roasting time worked well for us; in fact, I gave it a few extra minutes, and it caramelized nicely.

I didn't change a thing and loved it.  I cooked on the grill in a grill basket instead of the oven, and it turned out really good.  My boyfriend and I devoured an entire head of cauliflower!

I've made a similar version where you add Marjoram to the marinaide and fresh grated parmesan added for the last 10 minutes or so.  Get's rave reviews every time.

I especially like this because the balsamic is not an overpowering favor, as it can sometimes be. A very nice different take on cauliflower. Next time, I'd like to cut my cauliflower smaller and let it marinate for a little while.

Very nice!  Easy and yummy.  Next time, I may try white balsamic vinegar to improve eye appeal.

Make sure you use a large enough pan so the cauliflower is not crowded and it will brown nicely.

This smelled amazing in the first 8 min of cooking but then it started burning.  I turned the heat down so I wasnt able to fully cook it all the way.  Maybe my oven is too efficient. I really enjoyed the recipe, I hope my next trial run will turn out better.

I love these and make them all the time. I make 1/2 cup more of the sauce to make them more flavorful. I also add about a cup of shelled pistachios to the cauliflower when I am tossing it. When they are out of them oven I throw some parm on top! Easy and quick!

Nice sweet tart from the balsamic. I didn't marinate. I did sub in garlic powder. Needed more oil, I always oil the pan, and then toss the vegetable with oil and the spices. Nice change of pace for roasting. Thanks!

Thank you hike4diamonds. It's always good to have another easy veggie in the aresenal. Will definitely make this again. However, my garlic burned, so I may leave the garlic out until the end and just use a little garlic powder

This wasn't bad, by any means, but this wasn't great either.  It was nowhere near as flavorful as I expected it to be.  I may make it again, but with some tweaking to boost the balsamic and garlic flavor.

This is such an addicting recipe. I practically ate 3/4 of a head of cauliflower just this morning/afternoon and baking two more batches in the oven right now. I used balsamic cream which is creamier, thicker, and a tad bit sweeter. Delicious when baked. Thank you!

I'm always trying to find more interesting ways to make cauliflower.  I made small changes by initially steaming the cauliflower to make it slightly tender before combining it with sliced white onions and whole fresh garlic cloves in the balsamic vinegar and olive oil marinade.  It came out great!  Just wish I had more time to let it marinate before cooking.

Really yummy!  What a nice change from steamed cauliflower. I added a little extra garlic, and next time may marinade it just a bit longer, but this was a winner with my whole family.

This is such a simple, yet delicious recipe! The recipe is great as is, but I might tweak it a bit in the future just for fun:) Even my husband, who doesn't like cauliflower AT ALL, said he'd eat it again!

I normally won't eat cauliflower, but I bought 2 heads and wanted to try a recipe. Found this one and have to say that I like cauliflower this way. I was nervous about the basalmic vinegar as well, but it tastes great. Instead of cutting my garlic I just put in whole pieces, and roasted it. Turned out great I will make this again.

Easy, quick, delicious way to have cauliflower!  Healthy, too.  Just need to watch them, so they don't burn... as 450 may be a bit high.  400 next time. :)

I did not care for this at all.  The balsamic vinegar was overpowering and the cauliflower was completely dried out and lifeless. I've reread the recipe to see if I missed something, but didn't. Sorry, but this didn't work for me.

Delicious!  Steaming cauliflower has never produced a great flavor.  This recipe did the trick!  I added another tablespoon each of the vinegar and oil, and a little more salt.  I marinated it for 2 hours in a large ziploc bag.  I cooked it 25 minutes and it came out just right.  Thanks!

Didn't really like it.  It smelled good but tasted bland.  Took a long time to cook.  Maybe you have to cut up the Cauliflower real small.

I lined my broiling pan with foil and then on top put parchment paper (my husband cleans up, and I wanted things to go well for him--and it did in this way).  I used a bit more olive oil, balsamic cream, 1/2 a head of garlic (cloves peeled but left whole), and roasted for about 30 minutes.  After dishing out on the plate, I sprinkled Penzeys' Brady Street Cheese Sprinkle on top.    Delish!   https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/brady-street-cheese-sprinkle/c-24/p-345/pd-s

I made this with whole garlic cloves (several) based on the other reviews and marinaded for about an hour. I think another Tbsp of olive oil would have been better. Delicious and easy! My husband said this is his new favorite way to eat cauliflower.

The only variation I made to the recipe was to chop the garlic coarsely instead of finely because of some of the comments that the garlic will burn.  I was glad I did.  Also, I had two types of balsamic vinegar on hand; generic and a nice one.  Because of one of the comments, I went with the nicer one and it was delicious!

OMG. I loved this recipe. Never been a huge fan of cauliflower but this was amazing.
I added my own little twist when serving.  I drizzled a cabernet balsamic glaze on it. Divine!

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it just as described.  I'm not much of a cauliflower fan, but this simple, easy, quick recipe made a great tasting veggie.

We love both balsamic and roasted cauliflower so I knew that we would like this recipe. I cut the portions back to two. I found that the balsamic didn't come through as much a I would have liked.

I made this dish for a sunday afternoon potluck dinner. I marinated it all in a bag for 4 hours then roasted it. It needed some more flavor--& I could have added fresh rosemary, as well as other veggies (after reading another review).  I'll be making it again as even seasoned as it was it was good!

They taste great, but marinating them for an hour made them even better. Great tip from other reviewers.

This recipe has all the characteristics I like in a recipe - it is very good, has ingredients which are readily available, and is incredibly easy to make. The only things I did differently, after reading the reviews, were to marinate the cauliflower for about an hour and to increase the garlic, as we love it with roasted veggies. I also love Indian cauliflower, my husband not so much, so we generally alternate these recipes during the cauliflower season.

I did take the suggestion and marinated them for a bit. They had a very good flavor and were easy to make. Nice change from my usual cauliflower recipe.

Will definitely make this again! The balsamic I used had a slightly syrupy consistency and it stuck to the cauliflower very nicely--no marinating needed. Very simple and its sweetness was a great compliment to the ham I served with it.

I used red wine vinegar instead and drizzled a little ranch dressing over all. Roasting in a tin foil lined pan. Letting roast at 450 till fork tender and brown.  It was wonderful on top of Angel Hair pasta. Making again soon. Thanks

Meh, not bad but not awesome. Let it marinade for a couple do house, didn't help. I used minced garlic AND cloves, should have added garlic powder, too.

This is now my favorite way to eat cauliflower. I did marinate the veggies for about an hour, as suggested by reviewers. I loved that the cauliflower didn't have the nasty smell it usually has when you steam it. The whole family loved it, even my 3 and 5-year olds.

I added another clove of minced garlic, chopped the cauliflower small, and marinated it for 30 mins like the previous comments suggested. Super delicious! Will make again.

Easy to make and the cauliflower was not overpowering. Next time  I will let it marinate for a while and  move my oven rack up higher in the oven. Definitely a keeper.

Yummy!  I too added more olive oil and it turned out great.  I let it marinate for about 10 minutes while I prepped other parts of our meal.  Our 3 year old even had a few bites!

Oh my - this recipe was awesome.  I've been staring at the cauliflower in the fridge for days thinking ho-hum I guess I'll have to cook it tonight.  Decided to look at this website and used this recipe.  Well, my husband and I ate practically the entire head of cauliflower! I use a premium and rather expensive balsamic vinegar for my salads and used it for this dish.  Very, very yummy and so easy.
