This was a fabulous recipe, and we love Apple cider vinegar. If it is too strong a vinegar for you, just add slowly until you reach your taste threshold. We also added a splash of balsamic vinegar to give it a slightly sweet, more complex flavor, fabulous recipe!

I totally disagree with the previous reviewer.  I cut the recipe in half, but followed it exactly.  It was very refreshing and an excellent to a rich and spicy chicken curry.  This would go well with everything.  If you're afraid it may be too acidic, just put the vinegar in last, a little at a time.  I thought it was fine.

I love this recipe! I made it with and without cucumbers. I like radish pickles and this works perfectly. When I want cucumbers, I just toss them in the bowl. Easy peasy! Thanks!

It did taste good, but the cucumbers get soggy very quickly. I would only make what you expect to eat that night, or else keep the dressing & the leftovers separate.

It was a nice salad, but with less flavor than I though it would have.  Next time I will serve it with something strong in flavor that could use a "tame" sidedish.

There was nothing wrong with this, but it didn't wow me. Not sure what to do to take it up to 4 or 5 stars.

Sorry, we found the acidity so overpowering. Felt it needed something sweet to balance. We liked the cucumber/radish combo and enjoyed trying the recipe.
