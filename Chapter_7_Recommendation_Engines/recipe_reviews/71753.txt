My family has made a variation of this dip for over 40 years.  Leave out the Catsups and add a little juice from the olive jar to thin the cream cheese.  You also get a different favor if you process over chop your olives (we like Chopped). Great (addictive) with potato chips, or prezels.

Have had this for years in different social circles but didn't know the measurements until I found it here.  Omitted the ketchup (have never had it looking pinkish but to each his own).  Simple and delish.  I added a few tablespoons of olive juice as suggested (to taste - I went with 3 tbsp for a half batch) to give it extra flavor.  Chilled for two hours and it was all melded.  I only made a "half" batch with 1 block of cream cheese and half a jar of the green olives.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but I made it for an office party and it was a huge hit! I used cocktail sauce instead of the ketchup as one reviewer suggested. Easy & yummy recipe!

5 stars for ease, speed, taste, and appearance.
Tasted better on the 2nd day.  We used it as a spread on crackers.  Yum!

We have been making this dip for years! It is super simple and yummy. Sometimes we also will make it without the ketchup and that's really good too. Either way it's wonderful! :)

I didn't think it was that good.  I followed the recipe exactly and took one of the suggestions of a fellow reviewer by rinsing the olives first to eliminate salt.  It was still salty and the ketchup did nothing for it.  I had enough ingredients to make a modification based on suggestions of other reviewers.  I washed 10 medium sized olives.  I placed them in a blender with 8oz cream cheese and 6 TBSP of mild taco sauce.  For the final touch, I sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar cheese.  This turned into a olive tasting southwestern dip.  I'm glad I did a trial run before serving the original to my co-workers.  I'm sure they would thank me! :)

This is the craziest recipe! It was surprisingly good. It was midnight before I remembered that I was having a potluck at work today, so I needed a recipe with few ingredients that I had on hand as the store was closed. If you are unsure about your fondness for green olives, this probably isn't a recipe for you.  But I tell you what, I got several requests for the recipe and my bowl was pretty much licked clean.  Don't omit the ketchup...I know, I was skeptical but it adds the right amount of secret flavor so it doesn't seem like you just bit into a brick of cream cheese with a mouth full of olives.  This is actually a keeper.

Like others said, way too salty. I probably added too much juice. Other than that, it's good! I also left out the ketchup and put in a 1/2 cup of sour cream. This made is creamy!

I LOVE olives.  I have been making this dip (minus the ketchup) for years,  I, too, add some of the olive brine to thin out the cream cheese.  I rate this recipe a four star because of the ketchup, which is, in my opinion, an unnecessary ingredient.

I made this for Father's Day, as my Dad loves green olives, but I used half a jar of mild taco sauce instead of ketchup, as we are not big ketchup fans. Blended it all in a food processor and turned out nice and creamy. Was a little salty for my taste but that's the olives I guess. I would like to try this again using black and green olives and pizza sauce.

This reminded me of the cream cheese-olive spread my parents used to buy.  Try the spread on a bagel or even on toast with lettuce as a sandwich.  I phoned my mom right after I had made it to tell her she should try it!

Made half recipe.  Added enough ketchup until I was satisfied with consistency.  Olive lovers in the crowd loved it!

Fantastic, but I did make some suggested changes: I rinsed the olives to get rid of some of the salt, and instead of the ketsup, I addd salsa and a little ground cumin. This dip was a huge hit.

This was excellent!  I added 1 tbsp. of horseradish (we love cocktail sauce, but not big fans of ketchup alone), and also about a teaspoon of cumin seasoning, and it just kicked in a little more flavor!  YUM!

Wow, this recipe takes me back. It's been comfort food in my family since my mom was a kid. As written the recipe gets 4 stars, but leave out the ketchup and add a teaspoon of good paprika (the sweet Hungarian kind or Spanish smoked) and it goes up to 6 on a scale of 1-5.

What can I say, I love green olives and a good way to get them as a dip for veggies or crackers.

Love, love, love this dip! I'm a huge green olive fan and can not stop eating it. So easy too! I've made it with both ketchup and cocktail sauce....both delicious. If you use cocktail sauce be sure not to put too much in as it can be overwhelming, especially the next day. This dip is best with pretzels in my opinion.

This is great!  Since I like a bit of a kick to some dishes, I added a bit of cayenne pepper. Wasabi also works well to.

A true olive lover would add more olives and less ketchup. It  made a good appetizer.
