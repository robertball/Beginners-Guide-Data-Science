These ABSOLUTELY rock!! I cut the bacon content back to one half pound and the beef back to 1/2 pound. The butter beans are what make this dish. I did not drain any of the beans. And, I only had light brown sugar, so that is what I used. I used navy beans, butter beans and Campbell's baked beans. Relatively inexpensive and a snap to make.

This is always a pot luck success. You can use ketchup if you don't have barbecue sauce on hand.

I have made this several times and everyone in my family enjoys it.  I cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and I have substitued black beans for the white beans and it has always turned out very good.

These were the best baked beans!  Everyone at our cookout couldn't get enough of them.  I used light brown sugar and 1 lb of ground beef.  I will be making these VERY often!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

These beans are so good and so easy.  They taste like you worked all day.  I did do as the other reviewers and cut down on the bacon and hamburger to half a pound each. A pound of each would have been to much.  I think next time I will use another can of butter beans because I really liked them in this.  GREAT the family loved this recipe.

These are great.  I am not much of a meat eater, so next time I think I will add another can of beans and only a little ground beef or omit the beef altogether.  Very high in protein, which is something I needed.  I can always use a recipe with beans to increase my protein intake without soy or tofu....Kudos to you...

These were absolutely fabulous! I didnt have any ground meat so I subsituted for roll sausage. I used one spicy and one maple. I also didnt have white beans so I used two cans of Goya pink beans. Took this to a church potlock and it was GONE!

These were a big hit at when I made them for a carry in dinner. The only tweaks I will make when I make them again is to drain the beans before adding them to pan and possibly cutting back on the brown sugar.

This could be a meal by itself. I used a pound of ground round and half the amount of bacon. I added an extra can of beans and a little more bbq sauce. It was a great hit.

I'm not a big beans fan, but my family LOVED them. They said they were the best beans they've ever had. I'm making them again for a potluck tomorrow. I'm sure I'll make them many more times in years to come!!!

I'll make this again. I feel like I could tweek the sauce, but I can't put my finger on it yet. Everyone came back for seconds though so it was a hit. I love that there's beef and butter beans in this. Keep an eye on it during baking though. I might cover it and then uncover it right at the end. Mine burnt around the edges and dried out the beans in that area.

I guess we're just baked beans purists - we didn't enjoy the addition of butter beans. I'm still giving it a 4 because the flavor is great.

My whole family loved it!  I added just a bit of mustard, Worcester sauce and ketchup.  I switch the beans around and use different ones.  This is a huge hit and will most definitely be made time and time again!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

Best bean dish ever! My store didn't have ground round but did have ground prime rib and grabbed it instead. My husband smoked the bean dish under our pork ribs so the juice from the ribs fell into the pan of beans. Yum so good! Unbelievable! Making them again this week while camping with a large crowd. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious! Our company loved it too. Almost everyone had seconds. I used maple bacon and cut it up with a scissors before frying. I only had light brown sugar, so I added about 1 Tablespoon of molasses. I also added a teaspoon or so of liquid smoke. You can get away with using almost any kind of beans with this, so I used black and kidney. This is VERY meaty and flavorful, so I’m pretty certain you could stretch the recipe for a larger crowd just by adding more baked beans.

Very good!  I've never had baked beans with ground beef, but this was very good.  I did add a chopped green pepper. I might use a little less brown sugar next time as it was very sweet.

I loved these beans!!!! I will def make them for any BBQ hosted or invited to. I cut the bacon in half but my hubby said next time use the whole lb so I will next time. I used 3/4 dark brown sugar & Jack Daniels original BBQ sauce so it was not overbearingly sweet. So delish!

YUM!  This recipe was incredibly easy and so delicious!  I drained the beans per the directions but became worried that there wasn't enough liquid when I added all of the other ingredients.  Turns out I was worried for nothing.  The dish turned out great!  The only thing I would do differently next time is cut the beef down to about 3/4 of a pound.  1 1/2 pounds was too much in my opinion.

Superb!!  I would probably use half bbq sauce and half ketchup though, almost a bit too sweet.  I microwaved this and its about 30 min.

This was a big hit at a family party.  I have given the recipe to at least 4 people that came!  The only changes I made was that I used a 28 oz can of baked beans, instead of butter beans I used pinto beans.  In addition after baking I added 2 cups of beef broth, the recipe seemed to dry out I may have baked the recipe for a little too long.  I will make these again, thanks.

These were good but I'd like it better with more beans and less beef.
