I tried this recipe for my mother in law for her birthday and it did not work at all. When I added the chocolate to the water,corn syrup, sugar and cornstarch it curdled. When I have made mousse before I thought that you had to pre-melt the chocolate and add the other things to the chocolate not the other way around. I gave it two stars tho because it did have a yummy taste to it. Maybe I will try and fiddle with the recipe procedure to see if I can get it to work.

Wow, this is good.  I made it "fancier" for a special occasion with a chocolate graham cracker crust, chocolate ganache on top (EASY recipe on this site!), and raspberry sauce.  I also had no springform pan so I baked it in a deep dish pie pan.  It's not as much "mousse" as I expected... much richer than mousse, sort of halfway to a cheesecake.  Sooo good though.  If you try it with the crust/ganache/raspberries like I did, it would be good with white chocolate.

This recipe was fairly easy to make-just be sure to follow the instructions carefully. I put tin foil about 1/2 way up the outside of my pan to keep any water from seaping in.
My family and friends all gave this cake rave reviews and I have had repeat requests to make this for parties!

I made this mousse cake yesterday and it turned out fantastic. Baking in a bath is a good idea and keeps it moist...we used an 8" springform pan. Did not use chocolate curls but next time I will fancy it up a little. Thanks for a great recipe!

this worked out for me great! it did take a while to get it all prepared but it was the best cake i've ever had and i would make it again all the time if i could gain that much weight. it's very rich and tastes good hot but if you try it eat it cold and it is like heaven.

I followed the recipe exactly. The chocolate mixture was a bit grainy for some reason, even though the end product came out okay. It did not rise very much though. Although I thought it was really good and chocolatey, most members of my family thought it was way too heavy, and that is why I gave it four instead of five stars. It came out so tiny, I was disapointed with it's look as well. All in all, it's an okay recipe, but would not make it again. Thanks though!

Delicious - and I thought I'd messed this up completely. While reading the directions I somehow managed to skip over the eggs completely, so didn't add them in until it came to me that I had forgot them - after the cake had been in the oven for about 5 minutes. I thought it was going to be completely ruined - and when I took it out of the pan after baking it was a little soft and not holding together so well. I refrigerated it over night and just had some this morning... it solidified just how it should, and tastes great!!! So if I can screw it up and it's still good, it's got to be fantastic done properly. Also - I did not use a springform pan, just a greased/floured round pan, and had no problems getting it out. (I prefer these to springform pans when using a water bath, as springform pans tend to leak.)

A very yummy recipe! word to the wise,  read all of the instructions before you start baking or else you will not realize that you need a pan larger than 9' to place your cake pan in in order for the cake to bake properly. besides that, it was delicious! :D
