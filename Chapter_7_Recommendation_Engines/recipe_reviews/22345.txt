GOODNESS at its finest!! I would have never considered lard in the past but I am NEVER going to make another pie crust.It is beyond awesome and it redefines the word "flaky" in context to a pie crust. I would give it a 10 if I could!!!!!!!!

I used shortening with mine only because I have family members that do not eat lard. It came out pretty good--I had to add a little more flour though since the consistancy was a little different. Haven't actually eaten the pie yet but it rolled out fairly well and looks really good. Will repost rating on how it taste at later time. Thanks for the short-cut.

This was exactly the recipe I needed.  I've now shared it with the rest of the women in the family who sometimes are rushed as well.  My only mistake was after rolling out the crust, I put it in the fridge, and didn't take it out to let it come to room temp before working with it.  So it was falling apart.  Luckily that didn't matter so much for what I needed it for.  I will continue to use this recipe for many more pies and dumplings!

I made this recipe using butter flavored crisco instead of the lard and it was wonderful.  I also used self-rising flour so I didn't need to measure the baking powder and salt.  I will make this one again and again.  I used it for fruit pies, pumpkin pie, and chicken pot pie.  It is SO versitle.  It is SO flaky.  I don't know how long the mix will keep because it was such a hit that I keep using it all up.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

This is great and very workable. I opted for a mix of whole wheat and white flour to give it more health benefits and some texture. It's beautiful!

This is the best pie crust I have ever made and tasted. It rolled out easily too. It was flaky and it just melted in your mouth. I brought this pie to work and everyone couldn't stop talking about it.  Thank you.

This recipe was my first attempt at a homemade pie crust. I have always used frozen ready made crust with no complaints. It was christmas eve and i had no frozen crust on hand and no open stores to go get one, so i tried this recipe since it seemed the simplest and am i ever glad i did. This is an awesome crust and soooo simple. I will not ever use a frozen crust again. Thank you so much for this GREAT recipe.

This is absolutely awesome. Better than having pre made in the freezer. Very good texture. Easy to use. Great being able to take what you need.

I will take responsibility here however, the directions could have been more precise. I used the lard based on the recipe (one pound) but I guess it was too much... My crust was mushy and I never could get it up to par no matter how much flour I added. I managed to get it in the pie plate and it never baked through. After cooling, the taste was not good. Very disappointing!

This came together so easily.  I stored mine in a gallon sized freezer storage bag.  My daughter and I were able to scale back the mix proportions so that she could make tiny pies for her easy bake oven.  I used the lard as the recipe called for but am trying it tonight with shortening to compare.  A true winner for a pie novice like me.

I have used some pastry recipes in my time, but this one is the best. I didn't have lard, just shortening. I couldn't figure out how to measure it in lbs, so I just kind of eyeballed it, about 3cups. Followed the recipe except for that. Made it for turkey pot pie (leftovers), but I will use this for pies as well. Yummy and easy!

I upped my ingredients to 1 tbsp salt & 1 tbsp baking powder which seemed like the correct adjustments. Other than that great recipe.

This is the only pie crust I have ever made and I can't understand why people think crust-making is difficult. I have never added the baking powder, where are you expecting it to rise to? NEVER make another pie crust, this is it.

Easy mix to make and handy to have around. I used vegetable shortening and did need to add a little more than 5 tbsp. of water to make it manageable, but the crust came out tasty and flaky. This definitely will become my standard crust recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

The taste was amazing, but it was so hard for me to work with it, I thought 4 stars would be my judging. I wonder if the lard should have been cold so maybe that was my problem?

Extremely simple and quick.  I don't have lard, so I used butter flavored shortening instead, and I only made enough for one pie crust.  It worked perfectly with the Cranberry Streusel Pie I made.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this exactly as called for. I used mix and 4 tablespoons instead of five to make two crusts. THE BEST CRUST I HAVE EVER TASTED!!! THANK YOU!! the crust I made for 2 9 inch pie crusts made almost enough for enough for 3.

well, i´m giving three stars just because it really made a pie shell. Ohterwise wouldn´t give any  star at all. Everyone´s writing how flaky and yummy it was. Well, I´m of a diffenent opinion. It was flaky, but just because It was completely dried out, with no taste at all. I was very dissapointed by this recipe. Well I was a little surprised that there´s basically just fat and flour but when I saw all the great ratings I  thought I could try it ouy. Well, I did  and it was tha laest try out of this recipe. Know much tastier pie crust recipes, containing eggs, milk and a little bit of sugar which gives your pie shell a flavour.
