We all loved this recipe. I made it just the way it is written the first time I made it  and loved. Tonight was my second time making it. Only thing I did different was add the entire can of  red enchilada sauce, added another chicken breast and just a little bit more on the spices. So yummy!

This is, by far, the best pasta dish I have ever made. My children had seconds!!!!! We love chicken enchiladas and pasta so I though, "why not? worst that's gonna happen is I'll never make it again." You bet this will be a regular in our household!!

Great recipe, added black beans at the same time the chicken was added. Topped off with green onions and sliced avocado.  Will be making again!

I cooked the chicken in adobo seasoning (my go to seasoning for Hispanic dishes), fresh squeezed lime juice, and cilantro, shredding it in the pan as it cooked, and added some cilantro to the sauce as it cooked. I topped with sour cream and green onions. Very yummy!

We liked this recipe and would do it again.  It had a milder flavor than we thought it would have with the Chiles and Enchilada sauces.
Took longer than 55 minutes to prep and cook.  Also expensive in our locale for the Mexican ingredients.  We also froze the large amount of leftovers for future dinners.

Delicious!!!!!    Made exactly as stated except: only had 12 oz of green enchilada sauce so I cut the red enchilada sauce from 2/3 C to 1/2 C so it didn’t overwhelm the red sauce.
The other change I made was that I didn’t have chilli powder so I used cayenne instead.   Came out great.  Will def make again.    Well I made it again tonight with ground turkey and a different noodle.  Came out delicious.

My whole family liked this. I made it per recipe, but would use light sour cream next time.

Green enchilada sauce was overpowering. Also didn't have penne on hand, so used medium shell pasta (it worked!). Remade it omitting the green, used only one can (homemade batch) red enchilada sauce, used rotisserie grilled chicken, added 1/4 C lime juice. Substituted Greek yoghurt for sour creme. Delish!

Husband loves chicken enchiladas, I don't like them so this was my way of compromising and it was wonderful! Rotisserie chicken made it even faster, I highly recommend! I ate my whole bowl....

Super delicious!  I made as is and it was delicious.  This is not a low calorie dish by any means.  I would say that I might treat it like a baked ziti next time and share it.

My first taste of this recipe was when a friend made it and shared some with me. She made it as written and it was fantastic. I followed some reviews and added saute'd peppers, corn and black beans to the sauce, also didn't have sour cream so subbed in Greek yogurt instead. I loved it both ways, but  anytime I can get extra veggies in a meal, I'll do it. Sprinkled with chopped avocado, tomato and olives and it was a hit at our house! Thanks for this recipe, I'm making it for our family gathering next week.

OMG! This was delicious. Husband cooked two small chickens and we had two nights of tacos. Leftover chicken, what to do?! Found this and made it. Added some corn when I added the chicken and sauces, etc. Also heated some black beans and added these to mine (though my kids enjoyed them as a side, and hubby can't eat them). But it was so wonderful. Everyone liked it, even my picky 8 year old! Husband announced this would be on regular rotation for chicken! WIN!

Only alteration I made was using 3 mini sweet peppers instead of a bell pepper.  It was great - the kids ate it without complaint... which is a pretty good endorsement.

Great! I used extra green chili I had made yesterday that was a bit too hot for stew in place of the enchilada sauce, and skimped on the cheese and sour cream to lighten it up some, and it was still great.

This was really tasty.  Did it exactly to the recipe and loved it.  Took the leftovers for lunch the next day and it was just as good.
