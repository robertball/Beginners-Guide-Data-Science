Call me a purist.  If you want to enjoy swiss chard by itself (vs. as part of a casserole, etc), adding most things to it is just a bad idea. The vegetable has such a delicate peppery taste that's delightful by itself - I normally don't even add salt (only pepper) because the salt will mask its natural taste. I decided to give this recipe the benefit of the doubt and used 1/4 of the recommended amount of balsamic vinegar - it completely covered the natural taste of the leaves (couldn't penetrate some of the stalks, thank goodness) and all I could taste was vinegar. My advice? Keep it simple. Saute in garlic and olive oil and add some pepper at the end - that's it.

I thought this recipe was simple, yet good. I changed it a bit. I diced the ribs of rainbow chard and sauted them with diced onion...this gave the dish a bit of crunch.  I also had a jar of roasted red peppers and slivered them in when the chard was added.  The combo was excellent. I loved the amount of vinegar (our family loves vinegar). I did add a pinch of sugar to offset the acidity.  Topped smashed fingerling potatoes with this colorful and yummy wilted chard. And served with a sliced heirloom tomato! YUM!  My husband and my 17 month old son LOVED it.

Hey i dont really see why people are being so negative about this recipe, i think its great!

I used half the balsamic vinegar, as others reccomended, and i poured the excess liquid before serving, and it turned out lovely.

If your worried about the vinegar becoming too overpowering, remember to not use strong balsamic vinegar.

I highly reccomend adding a pinch of sugar, to combat the vinegars acidity. 

Thanks for sharing

A neighbor gave us some Swiss Chard.  We had never had it before so I looked up recipes. We made this one and loved it!  It has a wonderful taste!

Very tasty, be sure to use a good quality balsamic.  I used the stems of the swiss chard, why waste them.  I would make this again.

Holy cow! That was good! My kids ate this!!! I didn't make enough thinking they wouldn't even look at it, let alone taste it. I will have to make it again soon so I can have some! Thanks for a great recipe I will use again and again.

I love Swiss chard and I made a point of cutting way down on the Balsmic vinegar due to other reviews. I am giving it 2 stars due to the good idea of olive oil and garlic, but the Balsamic vinegar ruined it for me!  I only used TWO TEASPOONS and that was too much!
I will stick with S&P and a little butter on the chard when serving. Why ruin garden fresh greens with vinegar?

This was great. I added less vinegar and cooked the stems first before adding the leaves.

I liked this, nice and easy. Didn't have any red balsamic on hand, so I used white, which may have been too sweet... still, I liked it

This is an excellent basic recipe that can't go wrong, with one exception. You must love balsamic vinegar enough to propose marriage to it. Against my better judgement , I made the fatal decision to follow the directions explicitly, as I usually do when trying a new recipe. This amount of balsamic absolutely ruined the dish. Try a tablespoon instead. Balsamic has a strong and earthy flavor but, overused, it turns your dish into a mushy, sharply flavored nightmare. Rethink it Teresa.

I like fresh chard. I didn't like this. If you like to sip balsamic with alittle crunch then this is you. I left out the Balsamic. Added a tsp lemon juice and  one tab of butter. A small amount of Bacon is good too. You don't need to bury the Chard.

This was a good idea for a recipe, but I changed the balsamic vinegar to white cooking wine, the white wine did not overwhelm the dish like the balsamic vinegar. It was amazing. I sauteed thickly sliced garlic (I enjoy the flavor and texture), added freshly ground pepper, salt, fresh rosemary and finally poured in the wine, added the chard and cooked as recommended. It was delish!

Perfect for its simplicity. Great vivid green side on a plate, alongside a savory entree. Served with osso bucco and creamy polenta.

Delicious! I used the colorful stalks, and they tasted fine. I would suggest reducing the balsamic vinegar, as it was a little bit sour. An alternate solution is to add 1 tbsp+1 tsp brown sugar to the swiss chard after adding the balsamic vinegar. For extra flavor, add a dash each of lemon pepper, pepper, red pepper flakes, and salt. Feeling adventurous? Add a couple pinches lavender flowers!

Very quick and easy. I added 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and it was just right. I also added 2 big cloves of garlic, and a pinch of sugar. It was delicious  just dont overcook it or it ends up mushy, about 7 mins was good.

My first time fixing swiss chard (I used rainbow chard). Was a bit blah (other than too vinegary) so I added some pine nuts. Next time I'll cut the vinegar and I'm sure it'll be better.

meh, this was okay.  I think it is probably a better recipe for those who aren't true fans of greens and need to disguise them to be able to eat them.  The garlic and vinegar definitely overpowered the lovely swiss chard taste.  I'm glad I tried it, but won't be making it again.

Very nice, basic recipe. I sauteed a few strips of cubed bacon and chopped onion with the garlic. I skipped the salt since the bacon had plenty and added the balsamic when I served it rather than cooking it in to the dish. Yummy! I will mention for those new to chard that you have to wash it very thoroughly as it tends to be sandy/gritty.

I have cooked the swiss chard without the balsamic and it was too bitter. I liked the way the swiss chard bitterness disappeared when cooked with the balsamic vinegar.  I served it with Basmati brown rice, sauteed onions and scrambled eggs all mixed up. Then I topped it with salsa.  Makes a good vegetarian meal.

My husband HATED this. I found it barely edible. Ironically, my 16 month old daughter enjoyed chewing on some of the pieces. Go figure. I did use slightly less balsamic vinegar as per other reviews, but not that much less. It didn't help. I don't know if you have to really LOVE swiss chard to enjoy this recipe or if the recipe just isn't that great. Personally, I thought it was awful and I won't be making it again.

I've been trying to incorporate different greens in our diet and my husband loved it.  I halved the balsamic as suggested but and only added pepper.  I will definitely make this again.  Simple is the word!

Liked this recipe... but we are lovers of balsamic vinegar.  I'm sure I didn't use as much vinegar as called for.  I don't measure... but it still turned out great.  For added flavor and color I peeled carrots into the pan as the chard cooked down.  The contrast of the orange looked pretty on the plate and tasted great!  With the rows and rows of swiss chard growing in my garden, I will be sure to use this quick recipe again and again!

Easy and simple as the title says.  I also reduced the balsamic vinegar and also added some onions for some sweetness.  Turned out well.

Waaaaayyyy too much vinegar.  Cut the vinegar in half, at least, and this recipe has potential.

Too much vinegar, but still good. I love chard! And a super simple recipe is usually my favorite way to eat it, but some carmelized onions would cut the sour a bit I think. I paired this with "Barley Primavera" and it's really good together!

Excellent, simple way to make chard.  Even though we are a family who likes the flavor of vinegar, I did only use a couple of tablespoons, just enough to empart that flavor without taking away from the freshness of the chard taste.  Will so make this again!

I've been making this for 3 years +.  It is by far one of our favorite side dishes.  It takes 5 minutes to make and is amazing.  Instead of mincing the garlic, I take two cloves and smash them and then just mix them in the bowl with the cooked chard.  We don't eat the garlic, but it's enough to give the chard flavor...and it saves time.

I was worried that my husband may not go for this one...he actually liked it.  I think next time I will use a little less balsamic vinegar as it was almost overpowering.

I've recently tried Swiss Chard for the first time and thought this to be O.K. for a green leafy vegetable. I decided to try this particular way of cooking it and found it very pleasing to my palate.  Reading other comments regarding the balsamic vinegar I decided to use white balsamic and only added a couple of tablespoons and a bit of sugar to counter balance the acidity. I cut up the stems and used them also just saute'd them first, then added the greens.  The Swiss Chard came out really delicious! Thanks for the recipe - I would of never thought of using the balsamic vinegar.

This recipe was really good!  The only substitution I used was roasted garlic instead of fresh.  I was expecting the vinegar to be overpowering, but all the flavors complimented each other.  I also sprinkled it with shredded parmesan cheese as a finishing touch.  I will make this again if Swiss Chard ends up in my basket again.

I'm making this for the 3rd time tonight.  We've really enjoyed the intense flavor of the balsamic vingear.  It's a great way to use the abundance of rainbow swiss chard we've received in our weekly share from our community farm.

I thought this recipe was great! If you like balsamic vinegar then you will love the way it turns out. It's just bitter enough and the bite of the sauteed garlic adds that ever punch.  It goes well on cous cous or rice.

Very tasty!  My first time for Swiss Chard..got it with our CSA this week and wasn't sure what to do with it.  We did cut back on the balsamic, as other reviewers suggested, but otherwise it was great!

1 bunch of swiss chard doesn't tell me how much since I grow my own.  I think I used too little and the vinegar became over-powering.  I'd try again if I had a weight value on a 'bunch'

I love Swiss chard, but the balsamic vinegar was OVERWHELMING. I think I will use maybe 1 or 2 tablespoons next time. This was edible after we drained it and added parmesan to the top, but this amount of vinegar is just was too much and overpowered the dish.

Simple and elegant.  The first day I went by the recipe, keeping in mind other viewers' comments about the amount of balsamic vinegar.  I also added more garlic and spring onions, as well as the stems.  Nice and crunchy.  The second day I substituted some red wine that had been opened too long, and added red onions.  The result was very colorful and tasty.  I forgot the pine nuts that one reviewer recommended.  That would have been wonderful.

My vegetable-novice husband actually enjoyed this! I served ithe balsamic vinegar on the side. I'm glad I did, the Swiss chard actually has a nice sweet flavor that the balsamic would easily overpower. I also cooked the red stalks ahead with the garlic and some onion. Served it with mashed potatoes (the way my mom served wilted spinach) and some sautéed chicken for optional protein. Will definitely make this again!

Waaaay too much balsamic for one buncb of chard.  Try it with a teaspoon, 2 at most and add more to suit your personal taste, but a quarter cup for one bunch of chard is seriously overdoing (just my opinion, but my family LOVES chard and no one would eat it).  Usually for one bunch of chard I will add lime juice as an acid.  It is less harsh than balsamic and adds a nice flavor.

Every week I get Swiss Chard in my CSA box.  My husband and one kid do not like it at all.  Despite all the recipes I've used.  This recipe had both of them asking for more!

As a first timer with swiss chard, I found this super easy to make and delicious! Added a bit of lemon which was nice. Also think it would taste good with or without the balsamic vinegar, and with onions I bet. I'd recommend this to those wanting to try swiss chard cooked.

Absolutely incredible!!  I am not a "veggie" person and I LOVED this!  I used a rasberry balsalmic vinegar and added a little salted pork to the pot.  Highly recommended!!!

I threw in 3/4 can of kidney beans and used Newman's Own Light Balsamic salad dressing in lieu of the straight balsamic. Throw on some Adobo seasoning. Yummy! (Sauteed the chard stalks first and then threw in the leaves.)

Delicious but the balsamic vineger gives the swiss chard a "smell" my 11 year old did not like. Oh well, she ate them, so in my book the recipe is GREAT!

it sounds good. However, I prefer swiss chard just steamed & served with salt, pepper & balsamic vinegar. The stems are the best so don't discard them. I like other greens fixed like this recipe.

This was delicious. I got swiss chard in my CSA box this week and was looking for a simple way to prepare. This was great- mine cooked up much faster than the 5 minutes stated in the recipe, but the result was delicious.

This was good, but not great. I would recommend sauteing some mushrooms in butter separately and mixing them into the Swiss Chard after it's done cooking.

This was good.  I tend to like a sweeter balsamic but I resisted adding anything not on the ingredient list.  I think what really made this work for me, is it was served with Amish Macaroni Salad from this site, which was way too sweet.  So the two complimented each other nicely and one helped balance out the other.  The main dish was Fish Fillets Italiano also from AR, and I think they all complimented each other.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

It's a perfectly fine recipe.  I grew up having it with white vinegar so the balsamic was a refreshing change.  In the future, I will use more than "a bunch" of chard and much less vinegar, but otherwise this is an excellent way to whip up some greens with dinner.

Thanks.  I loved this.  I followed other recommendations and added a T of sugar and used white balsamic (full amount).  A little sweet for my tastes, so I'll probably use regular balsamic next time but keep the T of sugar for a little sweet and sour taste.  Definitely a keeper though.

Sorry - I love vinegar and even cutting way back, it was still overpowering.  Maybe my "bunch" was too small.  Anyway, I'll keep looking.

Not bad.  I took the advice of previous reviewers, and used only about half of the balsamic vinegar specified - and there was still more than enough!  I also think it was a little too garlicky - although we like garlic a lot, this was just a bit too much.  Still, it was a tasty way to cook chard, thanks for the inspiration!

I harvested the first of our Swiss chard from the garden and followed this recipe fairly closely. The sweetness of the Balsamic vinegar was a plus. We loved the combination of the strong flavor of the chard and garlic. Made a great side with our Paleo grain-free almond grits with savory sausage meal a delight!

This dish gets my first 1 star ever since the inception of Allrecipes!  First, I can't stand the thought of including stems in this dish, then there is the silly idea these days that balsamic vinegar makes everything better......not in this dish, this dish is an old peasant dish originating in countries along the Adriatic and does not require sweetness and it's yucky with it, if you absolutely require "tang" try a dash of plain wine vinegar.

I  don't know how those children liked it, according to one person who shared. I found Swiss chard to be tough and bitter. It was so hard to chew, I eventually gave up. I left some in the pan cooking longer than an hour, and  it became slightly more tender, but was still very bitter. I'm trying to try new vegetables, but Swiss chard is definitely not for me. It was like chewing a medication that was bitter.  Yuck!

Before I only used Swiss Chard in salads

This recipe is easy and full of flavor.  I like to dice the stems of the swiss chard and saute in olive oil with the minced garlic.  I cut the amount of the balsamic vinegar to taste and add grape tomatoes cut in half.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  My family and coworker love it.

This was my first time cooking chard, it was tastey but I would cut all the stalks out so it is less bitter.

Wow! I haven't used balsamic vinegar lately. I'd forgotten how potent it can be. It virtually overpowered the ruby Swiss chard, and I used a high quality balsamic. Next time, I'll read the reviews first, I usually do, but this looked so easy and good that I skipped that step. I would've known to cut back on vinegar - thought as much as I was pouring it in. I'm sure cutting back will make all the difference and make this a 4 star recipe!

No one in my family liked this.  Too much wine, not enough butter and the cheese didn't really add to the recipe.

I halved the vinegar and included diced stems (added w/garlic).  Pleasantly sweet.  Astringent aftertaste -- I don't know if this was from the vinegar or the leaves themselves.  Served with a fried egg and pumpkin bread.

Made this for lunch today, and it turned out allright. I agree with the reviewers that have said that this amount of basalmic vinegar is too much. It is also really wasteful to discard the stems - if you don't like eating them plain, you can chop them up and saute them for a few minutes extra with the garlic. Also, we added dried cranberries with the garlic as well and our version turned out pretty good.

My first experience with Swiss Chard, delish!  I would probably use a bit less balsamic next time.  I did 1 TBSP of coconut oil and 1/4 c. broth.  Try it as is, you'll enjoy it

I have never had Swiss Chard before, and this was actually delicious.  Unfortunately, none of the kids liked it.  I might try next time leaving out the balsamic (as other reviewers suggested).

I enjoyed this recipe greatly! I was looking for a quick recipe for my chard I got at the farm yesterday. I used grapeseed oil for the cooking, throwing in garlic and the chard stems first. I splashed the chard leaves with vinegar after they were cooking, added a sprinkle of rosemary and pepper at the finish.
If you think you are a professional chef, this may not be the website for you. I feel like this is a community of people who like to share and encourage each other, not rip others apart because their tastes may be different. There are other venues where you can do that silly work.
Thank you for the recipe!

I am giving this 4 stars because my husband, who gags on cooked greens, enjoyed it. I won't give it 5 stars because the balsamic vinegar was overpowering, even with halving the amount (only 2 Tbsp). Next time I'll add more garlic and only 1 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar.

I cut some swiss chard from my greenhouse. Followed directions exactly and it was extremely tasty.
