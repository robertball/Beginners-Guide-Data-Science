I marinated the meat a few hours before I grilled.  
After supper my family said I should make it again.

These were very very good. The sauce is so delicious.  But I think the next time I make these I would marinate the meat as I just wished the flavour from the sauce had infused the meat.

These were so good and so easy to make. They disappeared as soon as I put them on the table. I surprised my family with these for lunch. I added some other vegetables to the skewers like tomatoes and jalapenos. I only had thin strips of steak, so I rolled them up after marinating them and then put them on the sticks. Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing it with us.

Made this this evening. I used Goya Mojo which I have used for years to marinate flank steak and eat as fajitas. Made two changes. I don’t like zucchini so I used yellow squash. And I cooked about 4-5 mins per side for both meat and squash. Squash was crisp and tender and the meat was medium. I served with Mexican rice which I made in my instant pot.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make! We loved our dinner tonight! The flavors are perfectly balanced and really makes zucchini delicious as you dip it in the sauce (my husband does not care for zucchini and loved this). I chose to marinade the beef with half of the sauce for ~45 min. - 1 hour, which resulted in the meat soaking in the flavor and tender for being sirloin. When dipping the beef in the sauce, there seemed to be too much lime coming through, but that's soley from my obvious adjustment to the recipe. This recipe is so good though that I didn't even realize I forgot to add the salt and pepper before grilling and didn't bother to add any after! Served over plain steamed white rice. Looking forward to making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

For once I did  not change the original recipe. The sauce was delicious though a bit "limey" for my teenager. I did make chicken kabobs for the kids  as they don't like steak. That may be why the lime was more pronounced. It was more mellow on the beef. Will make again and consider marinating depending on time.

Very good! Easy to make, not need a lot of prep time. And grilling veggies is always a hit with my 10 year old! Sauce. Ramped everything up a notch. Will make again. Was very good paired with Raspberry mojitos!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I marinated the meat for 2 hours. Everyone loved it, but I think I’ll marinate for less time when I make it again. I brushed the zucchini with sauce prior to grilling. I used fresh oregano because I grow it.
