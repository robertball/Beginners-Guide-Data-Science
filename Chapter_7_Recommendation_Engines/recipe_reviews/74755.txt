I was a bit skeptical of such a creation, but it was pretty tasty. I found the apple flavor a bit mild, though. Some people may want to throw in more apples. I will make this again!

This recipe intrigued me but there didn't seem to be enough apple flavour...perhaps I used the wrong type of apple. I think a green Granny Smith apple would work better. (not red). My toddler loved it!

This is a good recipe, but I found that if you use at least 2 apples, it taste better.  Plus if you add at least 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon it taste better yet.  Still a good recipe.

The apple wouldn't blend, and it left the shake chunky. and I tried to blend the apple in so much, it got really foamy. idk...well, it tastes good without the apple! (very sweet recipe; seriously, lots of sugar)

I like the taste but I think it's too grainy and foamy .  Swallowing is hard.

Good.  Sprinkled a couple taps of cinnamon on the top of the shake; was a nice addition. Make sure to blend until the apples are smooth. The apple flavor is mild.  4 stars.

Awesome drink to get on the go, tried it with breakfast and enjoyed it, even with non-fat ice cream.

Tastes good.  Needed one more scoop of ice cream for the consistency I like.  Took me a minute to get past the texture as the apples don't completely blend.  But good!

Awesome Idea!!! A great new nourishment for my kids to enjoy.  It gives a whole new light to the flat taste of milk.

I made a few changes with the recipe to my liking and im surprised it turned out good.

here my recipe:
1 cup fresh milk
2 fresh red apples
3 scoops of vanilla ice-cream
1 1/2 cups of ice

no sugar bc i believe that the apple, milk and ice cream can already bring sweetness to the drink :)

Better than I would've expected; used 2 apples. My only problem was that it wasn't very cold, and too sweet, but overall fine-would make it again
