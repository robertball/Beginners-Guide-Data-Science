I read the first review and decided to try this with 1/2 bag of butterscotch chips instead of the pudding.  I really like the flavor of butterscotch and combining that with rice crispy treats sounded great!  I'm giving it 5 stars for the idea but I can't say how the recipe is as written.  They turned out great!  I also added an extra cup or so of rice crispies so it wasn't too gooey.

I made a batch of these to send home with my boyfriend for his kids.  Not only did Dad and the boys love them, but they went through the entire batch in one evening. Extremely easy to make and had a great flavor. Will definitely make this again, but obviously I need to double the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This treat is Amazing!! I was looking for some butterscotch recipes and came across this so I decided to try it. I can't tell you the number of times I make regular treats but now that I have made this there is no going back!. Did everything exactly the way it is written and my husband even took some to work and they are all wanting me to make more! Great butterscotch flavor never thought of adding pudding mix to a simple recipe to change things up.

Good but, couldn't really taste the butterscotch, even added more pudding mix.
