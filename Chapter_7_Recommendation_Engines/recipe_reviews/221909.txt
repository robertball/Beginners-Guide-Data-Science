I have heard of tres leche cakes for a long time..but never tried one..till now. I am an instant fan..this cake is the best thing I have put in my mouth in a long time. I am picky when it comes to cakes and this one is worth the time and the wait for the 2 days to enjoy it. The only changes I made was to use a 12 oz can of cocont milk instead of the evaporated milk, poured the milk sauce on when warm, and put on the whip cream after it was refrigerated for 2 days. and topped it with toasted coconut. This cake reminded me of a coconut cream pie souffle'

Very good recipe. I made it exactly as written. Next time, I would omit the almond flavoring or reduce it to maybe a quarter teaspoon, it's just not to my taste (to much like Christmas cut out cookies). I would also cut back the sugar a little, maybe by 1/4 cup. don't worry about the liquid being too much it Will all be absorbed by the cake, in fact, it's probably more absorbed then some other tres leches cakes that I've had. the cake will be high and fluffy out of the oven, I ended up baking mine for 37 minutes the top was golden and a few cracks just starting in the middle. The cake will shrink and flatten out (becoming denser) as it cools, I ran a knife around the edges to loosen right away. Letting the cake cool will allow it to continue cooking in case the middle has any slightly gooey parts. All in all it got a thumbs up and with the changes should be a 5 star for me.

My god woman. First things first.. That's the best sponge cake recipe I've ever made. It was flawless! I can see this as is being so lovely on a hot day straight out of the fridge. I'm in IL in the fall however so I jazzed it up!!  In the batter I halved the almond extract and added a full tsp of vanilla. I grated some fresh nutmeg (probably about 1/2tsp) and added some cinnamon (probably about 1/4tsp) and a shot of Rumchata. I also added another shot of Rumchata to the whipped cream and probably only used about half the sugar figuring the liquor likely adds some sweet too. And dusted the top w another bit of fresh nutmeg and cinnamon. Made it for a coworkers birthday who loves tres leches. He was SO happy!  Resounding success. Thank you so much for sharing. This cake has so many possibilities. I'm going to have to make it again and again to satisfy my curiosity. Is anyone is looking for a good gift, I'm going to need a gym membership! Lol. Happy baking y'all!

Oh my gosh, was this good. I took this to a Cinco De Mayo party for dessert. Everyone raved about it. It was a little time consuming to make but it was well worth it. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. However, I did add the toasted coconut on top per another reviewer. I prepared it the day before the party finishing it at 8 pm and then refrigerated it overnight. It was served the next night at about 6 pm. Awesome recipe.

I had never heard of Tres Leches cake and this was my first time making it. I was surprised that no one else noted that the cake would be totally submerged after pouring the three-milk mixture over it. This had me worried, so I poured out a considerable amount of liquid out of the pan (1/4 of the total) before icing the cake with whipped cream and refrigerating it. It turned out dense, moist, very sweet, but very nice complexity of vanilla and other flavors. (I also replaced the almond extract with vanilla.) It's worth noting that my eggs never stiffened even after I beat them a long time, and it still turned out alright.

I've had another recipe from this site printed and ready to go for about two weeks. It had hundreds of reviews, but for some reason, at the last minute, I had second thoughts and decided to look around and settled on making this one instead, even though it had only a handful of reviews. I'm SO glad I did! This cake was fabulous!! I'd never made it before, so I was a bit nervous to bring it to a work potluck, but everyone who tried it loved it. I made only two minor revisions - I used vanilla extract instead of almond (daughter has an almond allergy) and used powdered sugar in the whipping cream just because that's what I always use. Followed the directions otherwise exactly as written. Success! Looking at how the measurement of ingredients differs in this one so much from the one I was going to try, I can't even imagine how the other one could work out.

I served this cake for a Dia de los Muertos fundraiser dinner and it was a big hit. I've made other recipes for Tres Leche cake but I prefer the flavor and texture of this recipe. I didn't change a thing with this recipe and I did make it two days in advance as recommended. I topped the cake with toasted coconut on top of the whipped cream topping and I'd do that again.

This is a great recipe. It may seem like a lot of liquid, but it gets absorbed into the cake very quickly. We didn't wait for the cake to cool before we poured the milk mixture on top, and it turned out beautifully. I was a little concerned because the cake rose up really high while it was cooking, but once I removed it from the oven and poked the holes into it, it fell enough so that the topping could be added. The cake turned out very moist and flavorful, but not as wet as other tres leches cakes I've had. The texture was wonderful. 

You can top it with toasted sliced almonds and fresh strawberries to make it extra special. It's the perfect dessert for summer and definitely better served the next day. My husband also tried it topped with coconut and with sliced bananas, and that was good too. You can really customize it to your own tastes. I like that you can bake it in a standard 13x9 inch pan. Other recipes I looked at required pan sizes that we don't have. Will definitely make this one again. Might try substituting vanilla extract for the almond next time, although the almond pairs great with fresh strawberries.

This recipe produces a very dense cake after it soaks up the milk mixture - another reviewer mentioned bread pudding consistency and I agree with that description. (This is not a light sponge cake type of Tres Leches.) As with other recipes, you can taste the condensed milk flavor which can be strong. To counteract that I added 1/2 tsp. rum flavoring to the milk mixture which worked really well. I did not make any other changes. I thought the cake was very good but also different from any other I’ve had or made due to the density. I used a 9x13 Pyrex snd it was fine.

This is one of the best cakes I have ever had! I substituted coconut milk for the evaporated milk, but otherwise made this exactly as written. Excellent summer dessert, and even better the longer it sits.

This cake gets five stars from me!! It’s probably been 10 years since I made a tres leches cake, so when my son requested one for his birthday, I scoured the internet & this was one of the few that had consistent five star ratings. And deservedly so!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, only subbing extra vanilla for the almond extract, just because of personal taste. It did take the full 45 minutes to bake in my oven and I worried the edges might be dry, but no. I only let it cool slightly before pouring the milk mixture over the cake. It really absorbed all the liquid, no problem. I made it the day before so it had a chance to set up. I did add a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the whipped topping and then sprinkled the iced cake with cinnamon sugar. Everyone raves, especially my son. I’ll definitely be making this again!

I’ve been wanting to try a tres leches cake for a while now. This recipe had a solid 5-stars (as opposed to other recipes that had 4.5) so I decided to give it a try. I didn’t read the recipe ahead of time to see that half the ingredients needed to be room temperature, so everything I used was cold (right out of the fridge), which didn’t seem to make a difference – it turned out great! I used salted butter, which I microwaved for 15-seconds to make it “room temperature-ish”, so I omitted the extra salt. I followed all the other instructions. Also changed the almond extract to vanilla. I baked this in an 11x15 glass pan (instead of a metal one) so that I could leave the cake in the pan to absorb the milk mixture. Baked at 325 in convection oven for 45-minutes. Didn’t have whole milk so used 1-tbsp 2% and 1-tbsp of 18% cream. Made on Saturday night for Sunday supper so it was in the fridge for 24-hours before serving. Frosted with whipped cream right before serving. This cake was very dense but not soggy, and was very easy on the palette. It was a good dessert choice for after a very flavour-intense meal. You could also jazz this up a million different ways.

I've made this recipe 4 times, all yielding many compliments (even though I overbaked the cake once) and without an electric mixer. If you're going to hand-whisk, I recommend halving the recipe as it's much easier to get the eggs and whipped cream to the right consistency. Using thickened cream instead of whipping cream also helps. I also tend to halve the sugar and butter content, which makes it taste lighter.

I made this recipe exactly the way it was stated. I've never made Tres Leches before, therefore made a test-batch and made my coworkers my guinea pigs.  Everyone loved it and all went for seconds!!!!  It was a huge sigh of relief as this is my boyfriend's favorite type of cake and am making this for his birthday.

I used a cake mix for this and it was too light, so made the cake a little too damp in the bottom for me.  I made it for a group meeting and they loved it.  Next time I will use the recommended recipe for the cake or use a pound cake.  I will definitely do it again soon.

Terrific recipe! I didn't have any canned evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk, so I made my own by simmering down 6 c. organic whole milk mixed with 3/4 c. sucanat until the volume was reduced by about half. Then I stirred in 4 T of butter, 1 t. of vanilla extract and about 3/4 c. heavy cream  before pouring it over the cake. Yum! This recipe also works well with sweetened condensed coconut milk.

This was so good!  It's the first time I've made a Tres Leches cake and it got rave reviews.  More rich than overly sweet.  My egg whites wouldn't whip up so I just used them as is and it worked fine. Maybe even better because it was fairly dense and this was a good thing :). I didn't use the almond extract and used just a bit of powdered sugar when making the whipped cream because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  I made it 2 days ahead. It was still amazingly good 4 day after making it!  This is a keeper.

This cake is AMAZING!!! It was my first time making Tres Leches and it was beautiful. I followed it with two exceptions: I didn't wait until it was totally cooled to add the milks and I used almond extract in the whipped cream (because I couldn't open my vanilla). Incredible! I will be using this recipe again.

My husband absolutely loved this cake! It is definitely something you should make ahead of time as the flavor and texture gets better the longer it sits. I also substituted the whole milk for a mixture of half-and-half and 1% milk, and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract instead of using almond extract. The recipe is easy, but it does take a little time to assemble. I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top of the whipped cream as a garnish. Thanks for the recipe!

Made per the recipe, except I replaced the almond extract with vanilla extract. Came out really great! I cooled the cake slightly before soaking it overnight. I put the whipped cream on in the morning and everybody at my potluck loved it. Someone suggested cinnamon sugar as a topping, and it was pretty tasty. Reminds me of bread pudding, very dense and great with coffee.

this recipe was great! very easy to follow! i used canned whip cream instead of using the heavy whipping cream. I couldn't get the heavy whipping cream to thicken. :( I added strawberry topping! delicious! next time I'm going to add chocolate topping!

Delicious!  This was my first time making a Tres Leches cake and was so glad that I found a great recipe.  I made it exactly as written and I used a meat fork to poke the holes in the cake.  Will definitely be making this again!

This cake was amazing! Made it just like the recipe said and it turned out great. A lot of reviews suggested letting it sit for a day before eating it, to let the cake soak up the milk. So, I impatiently let it sit in the fridge overnight. It was worth the wait! Everyone at the family party loved it.

This is a fairly good cake on the day it's made, but my, oh my, oh my - what an outstanding desert the next day!  Didn't change a thing.  This is a great Tres Leche!

First time to make this.  This was easy to make.  I'm not crazy about almond and so I used vanilla instead and it tasted like all the other Tres Leche cakes I've had.  Very, very good--sweet, dense and very moist.  Made it for my sister to share at work.  Turned out great!!  Just sorry I didn't get a piece.  It's one that I'll definitely make again!

I fell in love with this recipe. I made it for my neighbor's birthday. 
I did tweak it a little. I used vanilla extract instead of almond extract. I just don't care for it. For the tres leches I used 1/3 of a cup of heavy cream instead of the whole milk. I'm lactose intolerant so tasting it was a bit of a sacrifice but worth it. I will be making this again but adding some strawberries.  It was the best tres leches cake I've ever had.

Made this recipe for the first annual Tamale Day with friends...what a big hit!!  Everyone wanted the recipe and there was none left.  So very good and not overly sweet and perfect density.  Will make again and again!!

It was so heavy and thick to eat. A stodgy consistency. Not a fan for the work it entailed.

Followed the recipe and read all the reviews.  Could not wait to serve it.  Here we go:  Certainly is a time consuming recipe with many steps.  Waited till the next day as advised before serving and to add the whipped cream topping.  Dense is definitely a good description and the cake did NOT absorb the tres leches.  It was floating in it, and after the second day, there are the tres leches surrounding the perimeter of the cake.  Did follow suggestions, and added the toasted almonds and sliced strawberries.  The guests liked it, but I will buy the one I had tried at Costco next time.  It did not float and made a much prettier presentation!
