aah, people. I have found the secret to this recipe. ADD some HERBS DE PROVENCE when cooking the mushrooms and artichokes - it is the perfect spice and compliments the delicate flavors of the wine and mushrooms, bringing out the natural flavors sweetly with a lovely country herb taste. If you want to really enjoy the dish to its fullest, I recommend a few sprinkles of Herbs de Provence to round out this mature, delicious dish. (Also, it went well over orzo as prepared in the Orzo with Parmesan and Basil recipe, and with some steamed asparagus.)

With the following modifications this dish was fabulous!  I chopped 6 boneless, skinless thighs into bite sized pieces, added 5 cloves minced garlic and 3 chilies de arbol to the butter & oil, saute'd and then set aside.  I used sherry instead of white wine and just to be sure I put a spoonful (just before the final step) in a bowl and tasted it with and without heavy cream - ADD THE CREAM!  The cream adds to the presentation as well.  After I added the capers I added 1 cup or 1/2 pint of heavy cream and served over white rice.  It was fabulous!  Even my boyfriend, who isn't a fan of artichokes, LOVED it and scarfed it up like there was no tomorrow.

I actually did not try this recipe yet. It is similiar to one that I have had for years and have enjoyed.  Some differences that people may want to incorporate to address the blandness are as follows:  Saute the bnls chix (in strips) in a little butter and some white wine.  In a separate pan heat 1 13 oz can of artichoke hearts (I use packed in water), juice of 1/2 lemon and 1/2 lime, 1 13oz can of peeled and diced tomatoes, and some nice herbs (parsley, shallots, chives, pepper) and some garlic.  The other difference is I have always served over rice.  I love the basmati rice.  The acid from the lemon, lime, and tomato really perks up the dish.  Hope it helps.  I actually originally got this recipe from a very nice restaurant I worked in during college (a lifetime ago!!).

I am so glad I made this, it was FANTASTIC! I was a little leery to make this recipe since there were several people who said it was so bland and horrible but I decided to trust the majority who loved it. I tried it out on my husband and my friend last night my friend already called me today for the recipe! I added lots of minced garlic, salt, and pepper to the recipe. I also used some cornstartch to thicken the sauce and I  chopped up the chicken after I browned it and I used a full carton of mushrooms. I served it over buttered and salted fusilli then topped with fresh parmasean...YUM!

I tried this recipe for my catering business.  It is awesome.  Very Flavorful.  I grilled the chicken breasts, then put in a pan with the wine etc and baked at 325 degrees for 30 minutes.  I then drained off the liquid, added a little water and chicken base and thicked and poured this sauce over the chicken.  It is to die for.  Thanks for the recipe, I will use this again.

Great Recipe!  I'm on a low carb diet so I ate mine with just the chicken and put it over pasta for the boys.  I did make some changes.  I cut the chicken into chunks.  I also sauteed the chicken with some garlic and wine.  I used low carb chardonney.  I used 18 oz. of artichokes and 8 oz of sliced mushrooms.  I also only used 3 chicken breasts.  Altered the capers to 2 Tbls.  I also used alot of herbs de provence to flavor the chicken.  I then added some lemon and lime to the sauce to give it more tang.  THe sauce wasn't thick enough and I didn't want to use cornstarch due to the carbs so I used some heavy whipping cream being careful to make sure the sauce wasn't to acidic to curdle.  I put the mixture for the boys over bowtie pasta.  It was a hit and will definately make again was definately restaurant quality!  Thanks!!!!!

Awesome!  I added Herbs from Provence and dredged the chicken in flour before cooking.  I also thickened the sauce with corn starch and added added lemon juice. Served with angel hair pasta...It was restaurant quality!

Interesting recipe - rather easy.  The "sauce" has to boil down for considerably longer than it takes the chicken to cook to get to the right consistency, especially if eating with pasta.  The overall sauce is extremely sour between the artichoke marinade the white wine and the capers.  I smoothed it out with some heavy whipping cream and thickened it with a bit of cornstarch.  Next time, saute some shallots in with the artichokes & mushrooms to sweeten the sauce further.

EXCELLENT!!  Please allow me to share my rendition of this wonderful recipe.  I am confident that this original version is awesome as well, but I had to make a change to satisfy a picky eater.  (My husband will not eat a thick piece of chicken.  Don't ask me why.)

I pounded the chicken to about 1/4" thickness between two sheets of plastic wrap (with the flat side of a meat mallet).  Then I dredged the chicken in flour mixed with the salt and pepper.  I sauteed the chicken in the olive oil/butter until nicely browned and fully cooked.  Remove the chicken from the pan and let drain on paper towels.  Cover with foil to keep warm.  THEN, I cooked the (not marinated, but canned)artichokes & mushrooms in the "roux", scraping the bottom of the pan.  I added a little more butter/oil and a couple more pinches of flour and let it cook for a few minutes.  NEXT, I added the wine and artichoke liquid and let simmer for about 15 minutes or so.  I also added in about a teaspoon of lemon juice with the capers at the end.  

I poured the sauce/veggies over the chicken atop a bed of buttered egg noodles - YUMMY!!!  I served this dish with the "Cream of Fresh Asparagus Soup II" from this website (Also delish!)  and a simple, fresh spinach salad with mushrooms, fresh ground pepper & salt, and extra virin olive oil.  (And NO, I don't care to know how many calories were in my final meal combo!!  Thanks.)  Enjoy!!

This is by far one of the best Chicken receipes -- I add more artichokes  (I use marinated and rinse lightly) and more mushroom.(I use baby portebello)  I cut the chicken in strips and brown well.  I would add the herbs as suggested the next time. Great served over a brown or wild rice.  A great dish to serve for a buffet too.  Enjoy!

This is an excellent recipe.  To lower the fat I took the reccomendation of another reviewer and only used one small jar (6oz.) of marinated artichokes.  I then used a whole can of unmarinated artichokes (14oz).  We never would have known the difference.  Next time I won't even used the marinated ones.  I also added extra capers, which we love.  The liquid can be reduced by simmering on medium, rather than low.  We put the sauce on our pasta rather than buttering it and it was great!

Awesome combination of flavors!  I didn't measure anything.  Also -- dusted chicken in flour to help thicken the sauce, used a mix of white wine/chicken stock/lemon juice for the sauce.  Added fresh Greek oregano, garlic, pepper.  Served with rosemary garlic mashed potatoes, and a light tomato/cucumber/bell pepper salad.  A keeper!

My family loves this recipe; I add garlic and fines herbs (combo of basil, thyme and oregano) and saute with the mushrooms.  I have dry mouth problems caused by medication and can't eat food without very moist sauces. However, Cook's Ilustrated magazine published an article in their September 1, 2008 issue describing how to brine poultry and pork that produces very moist, delicious meat.  For 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts weighing about 6 oz. to 8 oz. each: dissolve 1/4 cup table salt and 1/4 cup sugar in 2 quarts cold water. Add the chicken and set aside 30 minutes to one hour before cooking. Don't brine the chicken any longer or else it will taste very salty.  Wipe the chicken dry and proceed with the recipe. Discard the brine.

Surprisingly boring and kind of tasteless. Still, I'm glad I used frozen artichokes rather than the marinated variety because it then would have been tasteless and too tangy.  I forgot the capers but I don't think it would have made a difference had I included them.  The addition of shallots and garlic didn't do much for this either. Very disappointing.

This recipe was awesome! I used legs and thighs instead of breasts. I added garlic and herbs de provence as suggested in earlier reviews. I did remove the chicken from the pan at the end of cooking and added cornstarch to thicken the juices, then returned the chicken to the pan. It turned out great!!! I served it over buttered noodles with sauteed spinach on the side. My boyfriend and I both love artichokes and mushrooms...and it was very romantic...he was lovin' on me all night after that dinner, even before, because the aroma while it was cooking was so heavenly. Thanks so much. This recipe was awesome

Just read the reviews, and it's totally beyond me as to why someone would post a recipe for chicken that has nothing to do with the outcome of this recipe??? My opinion is "post your own recipe people"!  Giving it 5 stars just because it sounds good :)

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I was unsure how the artihcoke liquid would be but it combined so amazing well with the wine (I actually used dry sherry because that was what i had on hand)>. I did do a few very minor adjustments; I dusted the chicken breast lightly in flour (no liquid) and I added 3 tablespoons of butter (I doubled the sauce because it was SOOO good). Added penne and a garden salad. So good, so easy and so fast. No prep work at all. This is a real winner and I will keep this in my menu rotation. Thanks Caity-O

LOVE IT!  I pounded and floured the chicken before I browned it and added garlic salt vs salt.  I omitted the cappers (not big fans) and reduced the artichoke oil by a little.  I also added a splash of lemon juice and garlic to the sauce. Finally, I added lots more mushrooms since we all love mushrooms.  (I am getting hungry again just thinking about it).  The flavor was wonderful.  This was a birthday dinner for my mom and she loved it, in fact the entire family loved it.  I served over angel hair pasta.  This is a keeper.

This is a good base recipe!
I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. I added some Garlic and feta cheese.  To thicken sauce add heavy cream.  Toss with bow tie pasta.

I really enjoyed this recipe! It was easy and fairly quick to make. I love artichokes and capers, so I definitely will be making this again and again! It has a nice, bright flavor!

I took the advice of other reviews. I pounded down the chicken breasts, dusted them lightly with flour. I added 1/2 c chopped onion and 2-3 cloves minced garlic in with the artichokes and mushrooms and 1 tbs Herbs de Provence (this made this dish! I can't imagine how bland it would have been without it!) I omitted the liquid from the artichokes entirely and used chicken broth instead. I also added 1/8 c cream at the end with the capers. Very beautiful presentation and flavor.  Great served over egg noodles. Next time I'll try it over rice. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe and for the helpful alterations from fellow reviewers!

I have made variations of this recipe for years, and I love to top it with pistachio nuts for a little extra salt, flavor and crunch.  They really dress it up.

I love artichoke hearts and capers so this dish was so tasty.  I will cook it again!  Did not want to go to the trouble to fry the chicken and was not sure it would make a difference, but it definitely made the dish better.  WIll not skip that step.

Delicious recipe. I used 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup of wine. The marinate in the artichokes was too vinegary so use only a few tablespoons. Also I added spinach to the artichokes and mushrooms.

Made this pretty much according to recipe - used canned artichoke hearts, not the marinated ones.  It was good and could be better - needs some minced garlic - about 2 good sized cloves is what I'll add next time.  I did add a small chopped onion and thickened the sauce with a little potato starch. My husband loved it. I'll definitely make this one again!

Made this again (3/10/14) with the marinated artichoke hearts.  Used some chopped onion - sautéed with 3 cloves garlic and just couldn't get it to taste the way I thought it should.  It was sour from the marinade.  I tried adding sour cream to tone down the sourness (I know) and it helped some but not enough.  I've downgraded this to a 3 star - will probably add it to my "don't bother" list.  I'll look for a better recipe.  This just didn't give me that - Wow factor and you only get 5 stars for Wow's.

Made this dish last night for my son's birthday dinner..scaled it for 10 people..Everyone loved it..I didn't used marinated atichokes though..2 can's of regular..next time I would add a third can..I also used an entire small jar of the capers as everyone loves them..I reduced the sauce instead of adding any thickener..everyone trying to watch their weight.. I also added some garlic as others did..will defintely make again and have given this recipe to two who had dinner with us, who just had to have it!

This was delicious!  I too, made some minor alterations.  I sauted 1 small chopped onion and minced garlic with the artichoke hearts & mushrooms.  When adding the liquids, I also added the juice from 1 lemon and some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I was very happy with the results!  Someone mentioned having this dish paired with the Orzo w/Parmesan and Basil recipe found on this site, so I did...along with roasted asparagus.  The perfect dinner!  Thanks!

lovely recipe! my only complaint is that there isn't enough sauce - because the sauce was yummy! 

i think next time i would double everything but the chicken, and then maybe thicken the sauce a little

I'm told by my friends that I'm a great cook something that I've not really felt that strongly about until I adapted this wonderful recipe to what I had in my kitchen.   I used all the ingredients listed except I forgot to add the capers (which is a staple in our house) when I prepared this dish. But I followed my own instincts and as often happens with someone who understands cooking I made one of the finest dinners of my life.   I used a whole cut up chicken minus the wings and back which I used to make a chicken stock for future use.   Upped the amount of artichoke hearts, used the herbs Provence after browning the chicken as suggested PLUS tossed 4 crushed cloves of roasted garlic into the mix with the wine and mushrooms.   At that point popped the pan into the oven and backed it covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15. Let sit while the bread heated in the cooling oven and served it along side the spaghetti carbonara II recipe from this site.   Served a green salad with grape tomatoes tossed with Hidden Valley upped with again some roasted garlic.   Rumor has it you could smell the food out in the driveway when you pulled up to the house.   What a wonderful experience. Much thanks to the original provider of this amazing food combination.

This was a good recipe to go by. I made a few changes. First off I floured and seasoned(garlic salt, pepper and parsley) my chicken before I browned it.(this helped thicken it a bit) I left out the butter and used all olive oil.I also added chopped red onion and garlic.
I also used fat free marinated artichokes. They are in water not oil so I think that they have a lighter flavor. Will leave out the capers next time to tangy. Over all not to bad.

Not bad but the sauce is a little too sour for our taste.  I think it is due to using the reserved artichoke liquid.  If I make again, I will cut back on the reserved liquid.  Thanks

This is fabulous! But I did make a few adjustments. 1. Cut back on the reserved artichoke liquid and use more wine or chicken broth...the reserve liquid was too rich for me. 2. Add a T of lemon juice, garlic, onion or shallots and green onions for some extra flavor. I like this best served with egg noodles, but it's also good over pasta or rice!

Fabulous! I cannot believe that anyone would say that this recipe was bland. Will definitely make this dish again. We used baby portabello mushrooms, inexpensive chardonnay and a little corn starch. The sauce was divine. We only added the corn starch so that the sauce would stick to the mini penne pasta. Most excellent.

I have a similar recipe which calls for 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1 tbsp. dijon mustard, 1 tbsp. white wine vinegar, garlic, and about half the wine. The dijon gives it a nice kick.

Flavor was a little bland. I did try adding garlic and fresh chives with no luck on adding the right flavors. My biggest complaint was that this was the 2nd time I've made it and both times the chicken turned grey at the end and I can't figure out why..Did this happen to anyone else?

This was very easy & came out great!  I made just a few tiny adjustments.  I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic & a shallot with the mushrooms at the beginning.  I seasoned the chicken with Tarragon & substituted champagne for white wine & used only about half of the artichoke marinade.    I understand what others who reviewed this recipe were saying about the sauce being thin but it was great over spaghetti & didn't need any thickening agents.

This was really good, but I made a couple of additions that I think made it more flavorful than the recipe would have. I added half an onion, sliced, and a garlic clove, minced to the mushrooms and artichokes before sauteeing. At the end, I put in a couple cups of egg noodles, a pat of butter, and about 1/8 cup of cream. I also skipped the capers. It was delicious!!

My hubby  (who is not a huge chicken fan) said this was great.  But, I adjusted it so I could not give it 5.  I added some chicken broth and poultry seasons.  Its a  keeper!

This is really tasty, but I do mine a little easier.  Put chicken (or chicken pieces with bone if you prefer) in a roasting pan, add 1 chopped onion, 2 or 3 cloves minced garlic and rest of ingredients (except capers, and just omit oil/ butter), top with several fresh rosemary sprigs or equivalent dried, cover with foil and bake 30 minutes at 350, then uncovered 30+ minutes (less if chicken breast), then stir in capers at end.

This was great. I used vermouth instead of wine, which I totally prefer in cooking. 

Also, others complained the sauce was a little thin, so I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour before I browned it & the sauce was just thick enough. 

I will do this again.

Easy - I only had canned artichoke hearts (not marinated on hand) so I added a little balsamic while it was simmering.  Also garnished with Feta.  Nest time I'll add tomatoes for some color.  House smells great!

Very simple and looks very impressive to any dinner guests.  2 notes - 1) use the reserved artichoke marinate very sparingly, otherwise you'll get a very oily taste to the whole dish; and 2) if the chicken breasts are thick, slice them to reduce their cooking time!

My husband turned up his nose when I told him what I was making for dinner, but man, did he clean his plate and ask for seconds!  I had never used the marinated artichokes before and I was quite surprised how good they were vs. the canned ones in juice.  I omitted the capers and served it over white rice, with the "Sweet Green Bean Bundles" from this site, which by the way, is another 5 star recipe!  This is truly a  restaurant quality dish and definately something to impress your dinner guests with.

I was surprised at how bland this recipe was.  I've had good luck with recipes with 4 stars or more in the past.  I won't make this again.  I did thicken it - but it would be better if it was creamier.

Enjoyed the recipe very much. My mother-in-law and I even had the leftovers for lunch the next day and enjoyed it even more.  It did take a lot longer than listed to make sure the chicken was cooked though.

I've made this recipe a few times and is always a hit. It's exactly like a dish that is served at one of my favorite restaurants. The only change I make is to add a little bit of flour to the sauce to thicken it up a bit. Delicious!!!

So easy yet so elelant. Made exactly as stated in recipe minus the capers and it was perfect. Make sure you use a dry white wine, I used Pinot Grigio and it was perfect. Next make sure the artichokes are marinated. If they were packed in water the recipe would be runny and bland. Will make again. Kids liked it too!

I thought this recipe was quite good, and very easy.  I dredged the chicken in flour (as someone else suggested) and I doubled the capers (as others suggested).  My husband had seconds, which is always a good sign!

This is a super recipe, we make chicken picatta using lemon juice, capers and white wine. The artichokes keep the flavor tangy as a picatta should be, but adds another dimension. A true picatta is a little tangy, so be forewarned!

I loved this.  The artichokes, wine, mushrooms and capers were wonderful together.  Very tangy and flavorful.  I used chicken thighs which are much more moist and tender than breasts.  I also had to use cornstarch and a little heavy cream to thicken, and it was still too runny for the pasta.  Next time I will have it over rice.  Wonderful flavor and so easy.

I loved this recipe!  I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I only give 5 stars to recipes the whole family likes.  My 6-year-old wouldn't eat it.  I wonder if the person who said it was bland used the unmarinated artichokes by mistake.  I almost did.  The marinade and wine add all the flavor.  To serve over pasta I would definitely thicken the sauce.  Otherwise perfect as is.

I served this over spagetti which I tossed with a little olive and parsely flakes before putting it on the plates. Then I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese and chopped tomotoes on the top for some color. Everyone liked it.

This recipe is incredible.  It tastes gourmet yet is so simple.  A gentleman from my husband's work stopped by unexpectedly the evening I was trying this recipe, and I was a little nervous about serving it.  He went to work the next day though and told everyone that was the best chicken he'd ever had! My kids liked it as well and even ate the artichokes! I almost always tweak recipes a little, but this one is perfect the way it is.  Thank you!

Would make this again. Very fast for a nice romantic dinner after working all day. I did thicken the sauce just a little with cornstarch, and added a little more spices like some of the previous posts suggested. Went well with the buttered noodles and salad.

My whole family liked this recipe, even my 5 and 3 year olds cleaned their plates.  The changes I made were, I used one small jar of marinated artichokes and one small can of not marinated artichokes, and I didn't even use all of the oil from the marinated ones.  Most of it but not all.  Also, next time I would NOT use the capers, we hate them, we just found out.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  And I used a full 8 oz package of sliced mushrooms.  It was really delicious, thanks!

Very nice recipe to use as a base.  I would suggest adding roasted red bell peppers along with the mushrooms and artichokes, and adding capers during the last 5 minutes of simmering the sauce.  I also recommend thickening the sauce slightly.

I'm not much of a cook but I love artichokes and capers so I followed this recipe to the letter - it was good but I thought there was too much liquid and it could have had more zip. Next time I'll try not adding in the leftover artichoke juice.

My wife made this for dinner last night and it was good. I'm not a big fan of mushrooms, so some of the changes she made were to add onion, garlic, and herbes de provence. They went well with everything, but I think adding some sun dried tomatoes would be fantastic.

I have made this recipe about five times and it is great.  Sometimes I have left over cooked chicken and just saute the artichokes, mushrooms and I add onion.  Then add cooked chicken and heat through.  I also serve with Tortelloni or Orecchiette *** Add a salad ** Fantastic

If there was a 4 1/2 I would give it that.  The flavors were great, although next time I will add some flour to thicken the sauce. Also, we love sauce, so will likely double all the "saucy" ingredients to make more.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I used sherry instead of white wine since that was all I had.

Great Recipe and easy to make. I used left over grilled chicken and sliced it up other than that stuck to the recipe. Changes for next time: add more mushrooms, thicken the sauce and serve on egg noodles. The flavor on it's own was great!

I used baby portobellos instead of regular white mushrooms, and I didn't have white wine handy, so I used champagne.  I added grated lemon zest while cooking and at the end to cut the sweetness of the champagne and add some brightness to the flavors.  My very picky hubby really liked it!

Wow! This is wonderful.  I made it for my bride for our Pre-Valentines Day Dinner and she loved it! I used Black and Green Olives and doubled the mushrooms.  I also use the quartered, marinated artichokes that come in small glass jars because I had them.  I prefer them because their marinade is mostly olive oil.  If you like olives, artichokes and mushrooms, this dish is a must try!

Oh soooo good. Used canned artichokes, not marinated, added more garlic, 1/2 cup chicken broth mixed with 1 teaspoon corn starch and 2 or 3 tablespoons of sliced sundried tomatoes (not in oil). Served it over mini penne. Incredible dish.

Great recipe to add on! I made sure to saute my chicken with a blend of cracked peppercorns, salt, Italian herb blend, rosemary, garlic salt and onion powder. When I took the chicken out, I put the white wine in alone at first to lift all the baked on seasoning and drippings. This step gave great color and taste to the resulting sauce. I added cold chicken broth with cornstarch to thicken the mixture. I also added fresh leaf spinach while it all simmered. I served it over Jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth.

Fantastic!  I took some others' advice and floured the chicken before browning.  I added fresh garlic, some parsley and juice from 1/2 lemon and 1/2 lime.  Fantastic!  I think this would be great w/ pine nuts tossed on top as well.  Side was roasted red potatoes! YUM!

This was a delightful recipe.  The only changes I made was to add some garlic and a bit of lemon juice.  It was wonderful served with buttered noodles as suggested.  I will be making this again.  Thanks

Based on some of the other reivews, I sauteed the chicken with 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I also added balsamic vinagrette while simmering because my local market didn't have marinated artichokes, just canned in water.  The sauce was a little runny but the taste was FANTASTIC !!

I made this dish for my husband and myself last night and it turned out great.  I did make a few minor changes based on previous reviews. I put black pepper and garlic powder directly on the chicken then dredged in flour before adding to butter/oil.  We didn't eat this with any kind of pasta and the consistency of the sauce turned out fine.  I did use all of the wine and artichoke reserve also adding some lemon juice and LOTS of minced garlic and thought the taste was fantastic.  I think that if you don't know what to expect or aren't too sure if you like white wine/artichokes, this might not be the dish for you.  Also, I didn't add capers only b/c we don't care for them.  I will absolutely make this again!

this was very good. my husband LOVED it, but I think next time we'll try it over rice instead. The rice would soak up the sauce very well I think. Very easy to make and quite yummy.

Is good, however as usual made some adjustments: used two 6 oz jars artichokes, one jar of the liquid, rosemary, 3/4 c onion, 3 clove garlic, a few chopped sun-dried tomato's for color, about 1/4 c milk, 3/4 c chicken broth,corn starch with a bit of water, handful of parmesean. Served over angel hair pasta. Must have been good, as my husband keeps asking for it!

I adjusted the recipe with heavy cream and some cornstarch and doubled the artichokes and mushrooms as other had suggested and it was simply fabulous served over angel hair pasta.  Both my husband and I kept comparing it to all of our favorite restaurants and rated it as good as any similiar type meal we'd have out.  Thank you!
PS:  He has always been "ambivalent" about artichokes but is eagerly awaiting the next time I make this one.

My roommate first made this recipe and it was so good.  The sauce is very runny but I just added to a rue and made more of a gravy out it.  It is really good served with mashed potatoes.

I added chopped sun dried tomatoes to the recipe to add a little color and texture. My guests enjoyed it but I didn't think it was that great.  I don't think I'd make it again.

Added garlic powder as well as fresh minced garlic, additional salt and pepper. Cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces. I debated whether or not to add some heavy cream to make it more saucy but my husband talked me out of it. He really enjoyed the dish that is why it is getting a four-star rating. I made it for two servings and didn't have quite enough marinated artichokes but it seemed like the right amount. Also, didn't add the reserved juice. Served with some mashed potatoes.

I added lemon juice and garlic powder.  I also dredged the chicken in flour before I put it in the pan.  Make sure you use MARINATED artichoke hearts- that makes a big difference.  I thickened the sauce up with a bit of flour too.

A wonderful, different chicken recipe--tangy and tender.  I did pound the chicken breast before browning--I think that makes a big difference, for it allows the sauce to permeate the chicken pieces more completely, as well as tenderizing the meat.  For the most part, I followed the recipe very closely (omitting the capers--forgot to buy them--and adding a tbsp of diluted cornstarch for thickening), and it was perfect.  I think using the marinated artichoke hearts makes the dish quite distinctive. I know this is something I will make often.

This was an absolutely incredible dish. The flavors were amazing and for my additional touch, I added some minced garlic as I was cooking the chicken and about a teaspoon of corn starch to lightly thicken the sauce. It was even as delicious as a leftover. I think for a touch, I may added sliced olives to the dish next time. A+++ Thanks so much!

This was very simple and very tasty.  My children thought that it tasted a bit too salty but other than that, we loved it.  I also made some egg noodles seasoned with butter, garlic salt and parsley flakes and sauteed veggies.  What a great quick meal!

This was good.  I subbed chicken stock for the wine, and used split breasts with ribs, as that's what I had.  Cooked it  5-10 minutes longer, as my chicken breasts were pretty large.  The only change I'd make is to use more mushrooms & artichokes!

After having read the reviews, I made some changes and my husband loved it!  I dipped the chicken in flour and sauteed with garlic. Removed chicken, then sauteed the artichokes, mushrooms, added more garlic, salt, pepper, margarum, and chicken broth.  I omitted the wine.  Added flour to thicken and then put in chicken and simmered for 45 minutes.

I made this recipe before I saw it here, except here's my differences: add garlic; cube the chicken for shorter cook time; substitute chicken broth for the wine, thicken with cornstarch slurry if to be served over pasta; replace the capers with strips of red sweet peppers from a jar (or pimentos), this adds a nice color and another level of flavor; and last, if you want to serve it casserole style, you can place it into an oven proof dish on top of penne or similar pasta, top with parmesean cheese, and bake at 350 until golden brown.  I have also found significant cost savings in purchasing the items that tend to be pricey in the American supermarkets at smaller ethnic stores.

GOOD GRIEF this was good!  I have fallen off the review bandwagon in favor of rating for future reference. But I feel compelled to share. I did make changes, but they don't matter. I think that is the beauty of cooking, tweak it to how your family will like it the most. We don't all have the same taste.  STELLAR RECIPE! Thank you!

My husband is not a fan of artichokes, well that was until I made this recipe for him!  I added in some fresh minced garlic and I also add in a cup of chicken stock along with the wine so I would have enough sauce to server over angel hair pasta with crusty bread.  The recipe really lives up to its title!

This was amazing!  I only made 3 small changes.  I added garlic, chopped green onions and taking the advice of another reviewer, added heavy cream to the sauce at the very end. I served it over egg noodles with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.  It was even better the next day.  Every drop was eaten!  Amazing!

I followed the recipe to the letter. The result was ok but fairly bland. The sauce was thin and a bit acidic.  Next time, I'll follow the suggestions of other reviewers, and add herbes de provence to the sauce, use some sherry as well as wine, and thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch.  I might also cut the chicken into chunks after sauteing it.  I think the recipe has potential, but it needs to be tweaked.

I took the advice of one reviewer and used herbs de Provence for seasoning however next time, I will cut back or eliminate salt. The capers and the artichoke marinade add plenty of saltiness without adding any more. It is a keeper! Served it over rice Pilaf with steamed asparagus.

Added - This was pretty good. Mine seemed to be a little salty but I think I added salt where I should not have. Would make again.

I love this recipe! I did use white cooking wine since I didn't have reg white wine on hand, but I didnt add any salt to it at all. I also used whipping cream as was suggested and it was just what it needed. Thanks for sharing

Like other reviews, I found this very bland.  I love all the ingredients but for some reason they didn't work together.  I added loads of spices, but it still didn't fix it.  I ate it, but I wouldn't make it again.

It was lovely.  We butterflied the chicken breasts, pounded them, and dredged them in a mixture of salt, pepper, cornmeal and flour.  We used olive oil exclusively for cooking.  It's important to use the marinated artichokes, and of course, based on everyone else, we also added herbes de provence.   Because the sauce was kind of thin, yet flavorful, I served it with rice, and it really worked.  Easy, and delicious.

This turned out great!  I added a little milk and flour to thicken (due to lack of other recommendations) and it worked really well.  I always heavily season my chicken and added garlic which is a staple in my cooking.  We served it over brown rice-yummy!  My boyfriend loved this and we will add it to our favorites.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good. The family ate it all.  I made a few changes. I cut up the chicken into pieces and pat it onto wheat flour(it coats better then white) then pan fryed it for a couple of mintutes. Then cooked the other ingre. then added like other views  lemon juice and herbes de provence then baked it all together for 25 min. It tasted like a restaurant dish. It's a keeper. Thanks

I loved this recipe. I have made it with the marinated artichokes and fresh baby artichokes, both ways are delish!. We live only a few miles from the "Artichoke Capitol of the World" Castroville, CA and have access to fresh artichokes year round (lucky us!)If you like artichokes, you'll love this recipe.

I thought this was pretty good!  Most of my family liked it, but they didn't rave about it like they did the Camembert Chicken that I made earlier this week.  I did what a few others did--I dredged the chicken in flour and various seasonings, threw minced garlic in the butter and oil, and then fried the breasts.  After taking the breasts out of the pan, I threw a bit of wine in the pan and scraped up the brown bits.  Then I cooked the mushrooms, onion and artichokes.  After they were tender, I then added the artichoke liquid (from non-marinated artichokes) and some wine.  I didn't measure, but I didn't use near as much liquid as the recipe said.  The liquid thickened right up because of the browned bits of flour.  I thought it was a great way to dress up chicken!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very, very good. I made a few alterations to the recipe, added herbs de provence and salt to the cubed chicken. I used the Trader Joe's marinated artichoke hearts that come in a jar which seem to be less oily than the kind you buy in the store and the sauce was excellent and didn't need any lemon. I also added cornstrach and half and half to thicken the sauce. Served over Pappardelle pasta and it was excellent!!!!

I tried this recipe with the addition of heavy cream as one of the reviews suggested.  I think I preferred it the original way.  The artichokes were fantastic!  Everyone liked it, and I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe with a few modifications.  Added fresh ground Italian seasoning to chicken, as well as some crushed red pepper. Used sherry instead of white wine (mainly b/c I didn't have the latter, but the sherry worked great!), used quartered canned chokes and reserved THAT liquid to combine w/ the sherry. Once the chx was set aside and the liquids had simmered awhile w/ the chokes and shrooms, I sirred in somewhere around 2/3 cup sour cream to the sauce to make it a little creamy and thicken it up. Stuck the chicken in the sauce to simmer through for the time it took to boil some egg noodles to toss w/ the sauce.  This was a total winner. Tangy, fresh (x-tra capers for me, please!) and lighter with the egg noodles.  Easy, but impressive.

Delicious! Doubled the recipe for my mom’s birthday dinner. I added cornstarch to the left over liquid to make a thicker sauce to poor over the egg noodles. I would also recommend using half marinated artichoke hearts and the other half plain. It was took much tartness from the vinegar in the marinade and the wine- too over powering. But everyone LOVED it! Clean plates all around.

Good. Needed to sautee a little minced shallot before adding the mushrooms and artichokes. I also added a little chicken broth. Hint - flour the chicken before sauteeing. The juice/sauce will thicken after adding the chicken back to the pan.

I found this recipe GOOD but not great.  For me it needed more artichokes and mushrooms.  I felt it lacked in ingredience volumn, but had a good taste.

If I made it again I would artichoke and mushroom it up a bit more.

I did add dredge the chicken breasts in flour with Italian Seasonings before I browned it.  I served with Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  At first I wasn't impressed, but the more I ate it, the more I really liked it.  It left a wonderful after taste.  Highly recommend with the Garlic Mashed Potatoes!

This is my favorite recipe for unexpected dinner guests. This recipe is great, and very easy to make.  It gets rave reviews from all our guests.  Serve over white or brown rice. Make sure you use marinated artichokes, they add the real flavor.

I made this last night because all the ingredients are ones I love.  I gave it 4 stars because it was good with some modifications.  I will make it again but I think it needs more spice.  I am going to add some more garlic, garlic salt and some lemon juice this next time.

I thought the sauce was bitter.  I drained the sauce and added one cup of chicken broth thickened with cornstarch.  Everyone liked it and I will make it again but I will not use the artichoke liquid or the wine.

BLAND! Looked better than it tasted. I had to keep adding seasonings to it to try and salvage my meal, but not what I expected. Definetly needs garlic. A bit too watery of a sauce too.

This was great 'as-is' except I didn't have capers. I did not add milk or cream because I have milk allergies. I did not thicken the sauce. I served for valentines day dinner, with mushroom & onion orzo, and asparagus spears. We drizzled some of the sauce over the asparagus and drank the rest of the bottle of wine. Yummy. I think if you think this was bland, you might be using plain canned artichokes instead of marinated,  or your wine might not be dry enough. Reminds me of chicken picatta. I'll do this probably once a month.

This was great with a few changes, I doubled the artichokes, mushrooms, oil, and butter, added cream and corn starch to thicken sauce. Next time I make I think I will cube the chicken after browning and see if a can of cream of mushroom soup will thicken the sauce

My husband really enjoyed this dish.  I did add garlic to the butter and oil while browning the chicken.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Next time going to see how it turns out in a slow cooker.

It was very romantic! I used more mushrooms as my boyfriend and I both like them a lot. The chicken did turn out a little tough, but I think I just needed to watch it more closely.

Delicious! Tastes just like one of those pricey dishes at a well-known chain of Italian restaurants! As do most "chefs", I made a couple of minor modifications. I did not use the reserved artichoke liquid but added chicken broth thickened with cornstarch so we would have a thicker sauce for the noodles. I also cut the wine to 1/2 cup and may cut a bit more next time as it did turn out very tangy. I used breast tenders and they did not seem to dry out like others have complained the halved breasts did. I may even cube the chicken next time so that no knife is required. I served this over angel hair pasta with a side of fresh asparagus and my boyfriend made a happy plate!

This is wonderful!! Just make sure you drain the artichokes. I think it was even better the next day warmed up. I served it with buttered angel hair pasta.

Everyone LOVED this. I used black olives only, didn't have capers.  The artichokes were not marinated so, I used chicken broth (maybe 12 c). Adding lemon juice was a great idea. Next time I will add the cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Served over noodles.   Quick and easy.

FABULOUS!   We loved this recipe.  I made more of the sauce and I, too, added sliced black olives to the dish.  I thickened the sauce with some flour and served it over rice because I knew the rice would help soak up the sauce.  No need for a veggie side dish since the main course already had artichokes, olives, and mushrooms.  I will be serving this again - - especially for company.  I found yet another way to my honey's heart!

What a fabulous dinner.  Every Sunday our family has dinner with another.  It was my turn to prepare the main dinner.  This got rave reviews from everyone.  The young children even enjoyed it although they didn't eat any artichokes or mushrooms.  Served it over egg noodle.  We would definitely make it again.  Thanks

Very good!  Big hit with the in-laws.  I did not use capers, as I did not have any and it didn't seem to matter. I did not serve with rice or noodles, just by itself on a plate with homemade mashed potatoes and on the side-salad with homemade crutons and homemade bread.  I would definitely have this again for company. Not bland and yet not overpowering.

Anyone who says this dish is bland is not using good ingredients to start with.  It all lies in the quality you choose to cook with.  I have made this many times and every time I've gotten raves from my guests.  It is absolutely delicious as long as you use, delicious marintated artichokes and a delicious white wine.  Many people make the mistake of using a bland or cheap wine to cook with but you should NEVER cook with something you wouldn't drink and enjoy.  I love it and you can quote me on that!

I thought this was outstanding!  This is a perfect recipe for a romantic meal or for important company.  The chicken is very moist and the sauce is excellent.  I served this over buttered noodles, which absorbed the delicious sauce.  I did make a minor alteration: since I was serving this to children as well as adults, I substituted apple juice for the white wine.  I was so surprised at how well this substitution worked and would continue to use the apple juice even if not serving to children.

This recipe was not only easy to make, it solicited rave reviews from all who ate it! I used marinated artichoke bottoms instead, and added McCormick's (?) Spice Blend, the one with roasted red peppers and garlic. I served it with a salad, pita bread, and hummus. Ummmm.... Delish!

Delicious!  Rather than using boneless chicken breasts, which have a tendency to dry out quickly, I used legs and thighs...the extra cooking time needed for the bone-in chicken was worth it.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is an amazing combination of flavors, and it's so simple!  The only thing I would do differently next time is to mix in a little bit of fresh chopped Italian parsley to add a little of that fresh herb-y flavor and some nice bright-green color.

We didn't care for the tang of the artichoke marinade in the sauce.  It is extremely salty with salt & pepper on the chicken, the artichokes and the capers.   It isn't a bad recipe.. but I won't be making it again without changes.

Do not cook in a cast iron skillet!~ The citric acid liquid saved from the artichokes had a reaction with the iron and turned all of the ingredients grey! A major disaster.

This was excellent! I did add a couple things. I chopped about half a shallot and 1 clove of garlic and sautéed it with the oil and butter to give the chicken some taste because I am on a sodium restricted diet so could not salt the chicken.  I also left out the capers as I am not a fan and used chicken broth instead of the reserved brine. The rest stayed the same. I will defiantly be having this again! So easy to make too!! Picture added above :)

This was delicious! I changed things according to what was available in my kitchen & number of guests. I tripled the recipe but still used just 1 cup of wine. I subbed thighs for breasts & used portobello mushrooms & about 1/2 teaspoon herbs de Provence in the sauté. My artichokes were in brine vs. marinade so I skipped that part of adding the liquid from the artichokes. At the end I loaded up the pot w/ cracked black pepper & the zest of one lemon. There was a ton of broth, perfect amount actually. I served it over potato gnocchi and garnished it w/ shaved Parmesan. My husband had THREE helpings & my picky 6 year old asked if I would make it again ;) Next time I make this, I will put the artichokes in at the end. They were a bit beat up & visually unappealing so, adding them in last minute might make a better presentation.

for one thing with this you really have to use marinated artichoke hearts....not the plain ones...or it is totally bland. I only had plain on hand. tried it...no flavor even before cooking...so I took the veggies out (shrooms and chokes) and marinated them in Greek salad dressing...which gve it some lemon/garlic flavor. Better, but still bland. So I just dumped the dressing I was marinating the  veggies in (1/2 c of Greek dressing) into the sauce as well. Now it has some flavor. So...this is a good base to start with....but still needs some extra jazzing up.

This is a winner and definately going into my recipe book. I followed other reviewers' advice and added herbs, garlic and lemon juice. My boyfriend LOVES it (must be because artichokes and capers are two of his favourite foods...). Making it again tonight! Thanks!

I was skeptical about making this after reading some of the reviews, but was glad I did.  The taste of the wine, and saltiness from the capers made the flavours all blend together well.

This was a delicious meal!  I made a few modifications - sherry instead of white wine, chicken tender-sized pieces, and added some tarragon and garlic.  I served it on top of mashed potatoes will definitely be making this again!

This was a great recipe.  I only give it a 4 because I made alterations based on what I had on hand and since I was only cooking for 2.  I used 2 chicken breasts and cut the chicken into cubes and marinated with a little salt, pepper and lemon juice.  I added 1/2 yellow onion while cooking the chicken.  I also added a can of tomatoes with green chiles for color and 3 small cloves of minced garlic when I added the reserved liquid and wine, and I used sherry since I didn't have any cooking wine.  I served this with egg noodles.  A very good recipe.  Will make this again.

First thing out of my husband's mouth was what's so romantic about it, it's mono-color.  It did look kinda elegant, though needed colorful veggies on the plate to liven it up, but something was off about the flavor.  I would say don't add the artichoke liquid and rinse the capers before adding.

This is really easy to prepare and serve on a weeknight. I made it tonight with a couple of little changes. I used 1-3/4 white wine (Sauvignon Blanc) instead of using the artichoke liquid, and added 1 tsp. dried oregano.  I served it over thin spaghetti -- it was a huge hit. I'd serve this to company!

This was just wonderful.  I like to follow recipes exactly the first time out, but felt like what I added would not hurt.  I  added a few sprinkles of  de Herbs Provence seasoning, a chopped garlic clove, two wedges of lemon, and finished it off with crumbled goat cheese.

The "sauce" was way too thin and flavorless. I added some lemon juice & herbs like everyone suggested, then I tried to thicken it with some cornstarch and added some milk - but nothing could save this.

I used only 1 tbsp. of olive oil and left out the butter. I added some lemon juice and some chicken soup mix with water instead of the wine. I left out the capers. I used 1 samll jar of marinated artichoke hearts and a bag of frozen artichoke hearts (because that is what I had on hand). I would recommend using only marinated artichoke hearts - as they are softed and more tender than the frozen one. If you do use the frozen one - you should cook them a bit - to soften them up and so they can absorb some of the flavor of the dish.

I followed advice of another allrecipes' cook and sautéed tomatoes, garlic, onion, mushrooms, and artichoke hearts in white wine. Then, added spices, lemon, and lime juices before adding the chicken. Because of the tomatoes, the sauce was a bit runny. So, I added a couple of tablespoons of flour. Turned out great!

I'm giving this four stars because I think without the additions I made, it would have been too bland. I started by sauteeing onion and garlic in the olive oil and butter, then added some sage and thyme. I browned the chicken, then while that was cooking, added the mushrooms, frozen artichokes (from Trader Joes), and halved grape tomatoes. I used lemon white cooking wine, a splash of lemon juice, and a splash of soy sauce. As it was finishing up, I added the capers, a bit of garlic salt to bring out the flavors and about a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce. My husband thought it would be good with some olives in the mix, too. Overall with these modifications, it was awesome!

I felt this recipe lacked alot of flavor so I changed it around by adding a can of chicken broth and a 1/2 cup of marsala wine.  To thicken the sauce I used 1/4 cup of water with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and a little gravy master to make it brown.  Also season with alot of chopped garlic when cooking mushrooms and artichokes (did not use marinated ones).  Flouring chicken and add salt/pepper to that is very flavorful.

I thought it was kind of bland.  I followed the recipe exactly and I felt the majority of the taste came from the canned artichokes, which tasted like tin.  I will try it one more time and add some more herbs, garlic, pepper, and I will use fresh artichokes.

My DH and I liked this a lot, I think me more than him.  He wasn't overly crazy about the tartness of the artichoke marinade, so next time I'll use them packed in brine.  I used chicken broth instead of the wine, and added some flour to thicken slightly.  Easy and delicious.  Will make again.

I can't believe I got away with it.  Didn't tell the family that it had artichokes, capers and mushrooms, and they LOVED it!!  And it was fun to make too!  I served it "Carrabba" style, over angel hair pasta, with fresh bread, and oil with herbs for dipping.  BIG HIT!!

I am a very novice cook, and previous attempts at cooking especially chicken usually ended up with very dry and overcooked chicken.  However I just made this dish and it is wonderful, nice and juicy. I was a lil too liberal with the artichoke liquid, but am quite pleased with myself and the recipe definately a keeper.

Awesome! I mostly followed the recipe this time, although I never learned to measure. My marinated chokes came in an olive-oily sauce which smelled great, so I did dump it in. Taste/smell the liquid first before you add it. One thing - I served this with a risotto so I didn't need extra sauce, but you might want to double or triple the sauce to serve over pasta. Thank you!

I, too, am a fan of all the ingredients in this dish...thus my willingness to try it!  BUT... the "sauce" was bitter and unappetizing and I'm annoyed that I wasted my last cup of my favorite white wine! Like others said, perhaps it was the artichoke liquid that was the problem.... The only reason I'm giving this one star is because I was able to rescue the chicken and use it in the chicken alfredo I made as a backup to this meal.  I will not make this again.

I gave this a rating of 5 star because it was so great. I just added some lemon juice as what I have read from the other reviewers and my boyfriend just love it. He wanted a second serving, but unfortunately it was all gone. :)

Nothing exceptional. Would definately use less artichoke brine, less wine, and more butter next time. Does make a good comfort meal with buttermilk mashed potatoes or rice.

I may not have let the wine and artichoke juice simmer long enough, but the sauce was incredibly bitter. I added cream to even out the taste, which made it bareable to eat.  Will not make again.

I did not like this recipe. I love artichokes, love mushrooms, love capers and wine, just didn't like this combination. I think it was the reserved marinade from the artichokes. I won't make this again. Even from the photo I was suspicious if I would even like it, but so many people raved about it, I thought it had to be at least ok. Just not for me.

I made this dish for Valentine's Day, and it was a big hit.  We had leftovers for a few days, and it was just as good, if not better, the following day.  The flavors really came alive.  If you love artichoke's, it's a good one!

I'm a huge fan of every ingredient in this recipe, but together they just didn't work for me. The capers made the entire dish too acidic and salty. The sauce never thickened even after I added a tablespoon of cornstarch. And unfortunately, the chicken had very little taste. Maybe served over pasta and taking out the chicken all together would work better.

Very good.  I added an extra can of regular artichokes, extra mushrooms, served over angel hair, then sprinkled with Seasoned Salt when serving (it needed a little something).  Will make again!

I give this recipe three stars because it didnt taste BAD, but it didnt taste GOOD either. It's certainly nothing I would get a craving for even though I love all of the ingredients...I think the sauce needs to be thicker or creamier.

We thought this was very yummy. I did add some onion and garlic but I add those to everything I cook. I served it with angel hair pasta and a salad.  I'll probably play with the sauce ingredients the next time I make it - it was very tangy with the artichoke liquid.  Maybe add a little cream to it?  Nevertheless - this is a great recipe!!

This meal turned out good but not great.  I may try it again using some of the ideas submitted in other reviews.  The chicken and artichokes seemed a little heavy for the noodles; they sort of fell to the bottom of the plate, leaving the noodles all alone with no real sauce substance.  I might try thickening the sauce a little more next time.  This is definitely worth another try.

This was a little tangy for me, but my husband loved it and he can be incredibly picky. Making it again, i might try using chicken broth in place of the white wine (i used white cooking wine). It might tone down the tang a little. I also just browned the chicken and veggies in cooking spray instead of butter and olive oil. That cut down the calories.

My husband made this the first time, it is that easy.  I always use the unmarinted artichokes but last time he bought the marinted kind, and I did not like the recipe as much, too oily and stong tasting.  We usually serve this with noodles and a salad, we love it!

I made this for Valentines day for my husband and he absolutely loved it!  It has such a different taste from any other chicken recipe that I make.  I thought that the artichoke flavor was a bit strong (I, however used marinated artichokes since I didn't have plain). I have made it several times since, and it is always a hit with him!

I would remove the chicken from the juice at the end and then let it reduce to prevent the chicken from becoming too dry.

Excellent.  I added fresh garlic, a little more butter, and about 1/2 the jar of cappers.  This was very good and very eligant over fresh angle hair pasta.  I would not hesitate to serve this to company with high expectations!

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day and he definitely rated it a l0.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I sauteed an onion and three tomatoes, a little diced celery,  then the artichokes.  I served the meal on a bed of rice that had been cooked in cream of chicken soup instead of water.  "Wow"

This is a very quick and pretty dish.  I added 2 TBS of minced garlic to the mushrooms and artichokes.  A little extra pepper at the finish added just the right amount of zing and balanced the artichoke flavor.  It was a hit at our potluck last night.

Really good, easy weeknight recipe. I did make some modifications-
1. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and herbes de provence
2. I added shallots to the mushrooms and artichoke hearts
3. I deglazed the skillet with the white wine after browning the mushrooms, shallots, and artichoke hearts and let it reduce some before adding the artichoke juice
4. I added 3/4 cup cream to the wine and artichoke juice 
The recipe was yummy, worthy of company, and I will make it again.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.

I read a lot of reviews before making this and made some changes knowing what would work with our tastes. I used chicken thighs, browning them in bacon fat instead of the oil and butter. I doubled the mushrooms, added scallions, and used plain artichokes - not marinated. I also added more wine and more capers.  The sauce was very tangy, so after tasting I added a splash of cream and a hunk of butter and made a small bit of a roux with flour and cream.  That thickened the sauce just enough so it wasn't soupy but still had a nice, light texture. It's a different taste - and if you enjoy things that are tangy then this will be a good recipe for you.

This is the second time I made this recipe and it came out wonderfully both times. I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to add that extra something. it was just enough. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Sauce didn't seem to have a point, did not reduce or pick up any flavour and when it was done it just tasted like wet chicken and the marinade from the artichoke hearts.  I did wait a while for the sauce o boil down but just not a fan of this one.

chicken was sort of tough (maybe I overcooked though) but the taste of the sauce was good.  I added some lemon juice.  It was OK but I wished it had some color in it.  Looked blah.

Good flavors but I felt that the sauce needed thickening. Next time I'll add corn starch. (And maybe some tomatoes)

AWESOME!!!!!!! Cut 4 chicken breasts into chunks, or I use filets. browned in 2 pans w/ 4 garlic cloves, 3 shallots and sherry. Near the end of browning, added rosemary, thyme, tiny bit of oregano and half & half.  THE SHERRY & Half /Half make a HUGE difference in the recipe. Don't use wine use sherry.

I did not use the artichoke liquid. I felt as though it would be too soupy. Great taste though....very light for a summer dinner.

This was delicious, but after sautéing the chicken which I had cut up into chunks instead of leaving as whole breasts, I sautéed half an onion and two chopped garlic cloves for a few minutes before adding the artichokes and mushrooms and a little crushed red pepper flakes.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and served over butter and herbed egg noodles.  (PS, I drained the capers).  Will definitely make again (and may add sliced up brussel sprouts next time).

The recipe is fairly easy. I listened to other reviewers and dredged the chicken in flour with salt and pepper, and added herbs de Provence to the cooking mushrooms and artichokes. I sprinkled Wondra to thicken the sauce some and simmered on low-medium heat, but the sauce was still quite thin. I probably could have added more Wondra. I served it with noodles and steamed cauliflower. It was good, and I would make it again. My husband is not a fan of acidic flavors and did not like the artichoke marinade. Next time I might substitute chicken broth for that portion.

I've made this many times before- it used to be a staple in our household! I gave it a rest for about a year, until last night. I've stopped eating meat, so I left the chicken out of this- I used 1 lb of mushrooms, 2 10-oz jars of artichokes (with about 1/2 the reserved liquid from one), 3/4 cup white wine, and the capers. A little flour to thicken the sauce, then Served over linguine. DELISH as a vegetarian dish!

As for many who said the flavor is too tart- maybe it depends on the brand of marinated artichokes that you use- I've never had that problem. I've also thrown in some Italian dressing when I've accidentally bought plain artichokes :)

This was quite good.  I added cream to the finished product just to make it a bit more decadent.  I did leave out the capers though.

This was very good.  I didn't think it was as bland as some people, but the chicken itself could've been more flavorful.  Next time, I will either put minced garlic in with it, or I will use garlic salt to season it instead of regular salt.  We will eat this again!

Very good flavor.  I mixed corn starch w/ the wine and eliminated the aritchokes juice so when it simmers the sauce thickened nicely.  Definitely added different spices, though forgot to use garlic but will use it when I make it again.  Also added half a bag of spinach w/ the mushrooms and artichokes.  Quick and easy!

No one in the family cared for this recipe. It was the marinated artichokes. The vinegar taste was overpowering. I think plain unmarinated artichokes with some additional seasoning would be the only way we could roll with this. To each his own I guess.

While I can't really rate the recipe as is, it was good and my husband, who's somewhat picky, asked me to add it to the repertoire to alternate for stroganoff.

Because we don't drink wine, I substituted 3/4 c. chicken broth and 1/4 c. sparkling apple cider. Because I shook the chicken thigh strips in Italian bread crumbs and wheat flour, I did have to add an 2 more c. water.  Also added: 3/4 t. minced garlic and 1/2 onion, minced. Since my Italian seasoning had essentially the same herbs as herbes de Provence, used 2 t. - plus a drizzle of white truffle oil, 1/2 t. balsamic vinegar, 1/4 t. dried tarragon, pinch Sicilian lemon salt, and lemon pepper instead of pepper. Also eliminated capers. Served on bed of noodles and used rosemary and olive oil bread to sop up sauce.

This was just not as good as it looked. I think the problem was the marinated artichokes, which added a strange flavor for this type of dish. Even my husband, who'll eat anything, didn't really like this.  Probably using artichokes from a can would make this a lot better.

Delicious base for a great recipe! I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts because we’re dark meat lovers, so it took a little longer than the recipe called for. I also added a couple handfuls of sundried tomatoes, 2 tbs lemon juice, 1.5 tbs dried parsley, and 5 cloves minced garlic. Rather than using the juice from the artichokes, I added another ½ cup of white wine. I served it with 
Orzo with Parmesan and Basil Recipe from the site. Next time I will add more mushrooms and artichokes because they act as a great side dish. Great Meal!

Great recipe! I made serveral modifications, hence only four stars. I used chicken broth instead of wine, and left out the capers. I also used artichokes in water instead of marinated artichose. Overall pretty tasty!

Absolutely delightful.  Guests will think you slaved for hours.  Didn't change a thing and won't.  A welcome and simple change for chicken.

Yum! Tastes great, very unique, and fun.  I used White Wine Vinegar instead of Wine, and only used 1/4 cup, with added corn starch. Turned out fantastic. Color is still drab, not sure what to add.

This is so GOOOOOODDDD!!!!  I cut up the chicken breasts so all pieces get drenched in this yummy sauce.  I also use a can of artichokes and add some italian dressing and let them sit for a few hours to marinate.  This is so easy-I highly recommend.

Artichokes were overpowering.  I like artichokes but this was a bit much.  My wife had never had artichokes before and didn't like the taste.  If I were to cook this again I'd double the mushrooms and halve the artichokes.  I gave it 4 stars because we ate the leftovers, but wouldn't cook it again.

This recipe was pretty good.  I added two cloves of garlic but it could still use a little kick.  My husband absolutely loved the way the chicken and mushrooms tasted.  I will definitely be doubling up on the mushrooms next time.

I'm on Weight Watchers so to accommodate a lower point meal, I subbed out the white wine for low sodium chicken broth and a splash of white wine vinegar. I added a bit more broth and a touch of corn starch at the end to make a saucy sauce. Topped with fresh parsley. I forgot to add the capers. It was delish! I'll absolutely will make this again.

I first encountered this dish while dining at a family owned Italian restaurant. The chef-owner noticed it was the only item on the menu I would order.  It was that good. He would always bring me a tasting of something different but no avail, I was hooked. The last time we were in to dine he came out to tell us they were closing as they had to move due to a family illness. I'm sure he recognized the disappointment on my face. Before we left that night he returned to the table with a grin as big as Texas on his face and a tear in his eye. He pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket and handed it to me. There it was! his personal recipe written in his hand. It is almost exactly like this one. Although, as one of your reviewers suggested he included the equivalent of Herbs de Provance, and he served over Linguine pasta.  Ummmmmm GOOD!

Made it yesterday for Valentine's dinner. I made it little bit different, since tried recently in Prego restaurant. So I did mashed potato as a side dish and added some garlic,  but without capers. It was amazing

I used dried porcini and shiitake mushrooms with good results. As a leftover meal, I used more of same ingredients, heated on top of stove, adding the diced chicken just to heat. Very tasty recipe!

I have made this dish twice.  Once following the recipe exactly and the second time with a few changes as recommended by other reviewers.  I found the original recipe to be very good but bland. My changes were to thicken the sauce with flour and a little bit of cream and to add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of herbes de provence.  The herbs added a brightness and flavor that were wonderful.  Highly recommended!

Sorry but no stars.  Made this dish for dinner tonight.  Husband didn't even finish his dinner.  I added garlic more wine even a bit of lemon juice and this still was tasteless.  This is not restaurant quality.

This is wonderful tasty chicken.  The only thing I did different (no I didn't add more wine) was add some fresh rosemary.

Next time I will make the sauce the day before I add the small chicken breasts to it.  Following the advice of other cooks I added a chopped medium onion, four cloves of minced garlic and one tsp. of Herbs de Provence to the saute.  I used a whole 8 oz. mushrooms.  After adding the chicken I will sprinkle in some Wonder flour to thicken the broth slightly.  Very good on whole wheat noodles, mashed potatoes, etc.

I didn't have white wine and was out of capers so used vermouth in place of the wine, although only about half of what was called for, and quartered Campari tomatoes instead of capers.  It was delicious and would have been equally so as written.

Very good, I made it almost to the recipe, except I was out of wine so I deglazed the pan with chicken stock. It was a bit too much of a high note for me, so I did add some 1/2 and 1/2 and also had a lovely 2 year aged crumbly chedder that I added sparingly to it.  I also only had canned mushrooms, but they turned out fine.  I served with smashed red potatos and the chicken and sauce over a bed of fresh steamed spinach. It was so delish. One more thing, I did add some Herbs de Provence (the advice of another reviewer) to the sauce and it just went from really really good to smack your mama good!

Fabulous! I used 8 boneless skinless thighs cut into quarters (family preference) and then followed directions. By the time it came to sauté the mushrooms...since I was reading reviews as it was cooking, I was intrigued by the some other reviewers and I decided to add in a can fire-roasted tomatoes, dried basil, 1 very large lemon juiced, 4 cloves of crushed garlic, 1 T cornstarch, and 1/2 C heavy cream. It was delicious. The tang from capers and lemon was balanced by the cream and served over white rice w/ steamed broccoli. Could lick my plate clean.

I skipped the capers (Spouse hates them) and added in shallots & spinach & a squeeze of lemon based on other reviews. Served with spaghetti (what we had on hand) and crusty garlic bread. It was wonderful!

Excellent dish.  The only change I make is to use 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the liquid from the artichokes.  Good enough for company.

One of our favorites......I have been cooking for 50+ years and now that my husband has to eat healthy, it does fit the bill....I honestly think that those who thought it bland are probably people who must have things with lots of spice.....

Really good recipe. Be sure not to overcook... my guest was late for dinner so I left it on low for longer than I should have, definitely made the chicken dry out some but that was my fault. The flavors came together really well and I can't wait to make it again, this time for the right amount of cooking time!!

I used to cook this for my previous husband who passed away 5 years ago.  I remarried and have not tried this again until tonight.  When I asked how he liked it (I used the herbs de Provence, thickened the sauce and added cream - yum!), he said "It's okay".  He did not like the taste of the artichokes (canned).  He is a Midwestern farm boy and likes plain food.  His idea of a spice/ herb is ketchup.  I once made coq au vin and he doused it with ketchup.  He did the same with my boeuf bourguinon.

This was ok ,  I was disappointed with the flavors, and I am glad I read some reviews about adding cream to the finished sauce.  It was a "dry" sauce, tart, and I added Italian seasoning as it simmered since I tasted it during the simmering.   I don't think the  capers added anything, and should have skipped them since it added more sourness.    I liked all the veggies in it, but will look for other recipes using this combo.   I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans.  - Koriander

I first cut up the chicken into bite size pieces and sautéed, then added mushrooms,sliced heirloom tomatoes, minced garlic, onion,kale, artichokes,capers and a Hungarian pepper.  I used a cup of Sauvignon blanc, liquid from artichokes and a little organic chicken stock. I served this over Israel pearled couscous and quinoa. Very good!

Love this recipe.  I have made my alterations, as well as adding the suggestions of others.  The herbs de provence & garlic are great additions.  One major change I have made is instead of chicken I make this recipe with scallops.  It is exquisite.  An additional healthy choice for good protein is I pour this over quinoa.  My husband will make special requests for me to make this.  He even asked me to make this for a colleague's family because the colleague had been in the hospital.  I later heard all about how the colleague bragged about the meal I prepared from the others that he worked with.  Always a hit!

I have made this recipe a few times;  Originally a book club friend made it for a holiday dinner.  It's really good the way it is.  Have made it with chicken on the bone too.  Just remember is takes longer to saute before adding the other ingredients.  A keeper.

Just made this and it was delish! I did add some diced red peppers for color and flavor. If you are not a fan of wine sauces , you can substitute chicken broth, or cut the wine in half and fill in liquid measurement w/broth.  My husband and I are trying to eat less carbs, so I served it over Miracle Noodles and it was fantastic. This one is in the recipe box for sure !

Great recipe!  My entire family loved it and its easy to make with simple ingredients.  I tried the Herbs De Provence because several people on this site suggest it.  I also made the orzo with parmesan and basil as a side and it went well with it.  Will make again!

I made this the other night for my wife. We both loved it. I think this will work over white fish felays.

This turned out exceptionally for me. The chicken was so moist and flavorful. Because it's relatively some, it seems like it's open for experimentation.

It wasn't bad, but it just didn't "wow" me. I wasn't saying to myself, "Mmm! I'm making this again!". Followed the directions as written, something just seemed to be missing. Not a memorable dish.

I made a few of the modifications that others had suggested.  I added herb de provence and garlic, let the sauce boil down and added cream.  The sauce was still way too acidic.  I gave it two stars because it was edible, but I won't make it again.

Quick and taste yummy. I used sherry instead and added some flavor to the cut chicken pieces.

I have been making this for a few years and absolutely love it. I always want to read the reviews of others who give their own spin on a recipe as it gives me ideas on different ways to try other ingredients I might not have thought of.  So keep all those wonderful reviews coming  - there are some great cooks on this site!!

After reading some of the reviews I made a few slight modifications. I sliced the chicken breast into strips before I browned them, I added herbs DE Provence with the capers and a cup of heavy cream at the end. It came out great, I served it over whole grain angel hair. I will make this again frequently, great recipe...

I have never eaten artichokes before, so I thought I'd try this recipe. Hunny loved it, I wasn't so sure. For me, the mix of flavors was too strong. I might try it again with non-marinated artichokes to see if the fact that they were marinated, caused the flavors to be so strong. Else, I'll probably do what some of you suggested, substitute the artichoke for another vegetable. I did like the overal taste of it. Will try again, and will see how we go :)

I really liked this dish.  Of course it's not spicy or exciting but it is very tasty and comforting.  The flavor is more mediterranean/provencal and hence milder than many chicken recipes you might find.  I added three cloves of crushed garlic while browning the chicken, and used 2 1/2 cups of sliced baby bella mushrooms instead of the  1c of regular mushooms.  Went fantastically with steamed asparagus, egg noodles, and a bottle of Pinot Grigio!

I thought this recipe was going to be scrumptious but turned out just OK.  I also added more garlic and spices to this recipe but it looked a lot better than it tasted. It was just OK

Great recipe! I was afraid my fiance wouldn't like the artichoke hearts, but he loved it! Next time I will make twice as much sauce, and serve over noodles.

I served this to my nine year old but just the chicken, no shrooms or artichoke hearts. He liked it. I served it with tri colored pasta and sprinkled a little romano cheese on top. Hubby liked it too.

Despite the fact that my boyfriend and I haven't found a taste for pickled artichoke hearts just yet, we found them to be very well complimentary to the overall simply delicious dish. Rather than use chicken breast I used chicken thighs which was much more tender and went well with the texture of the soft mushrooms and artichoke hearts.

We were really disappointed in this one.  It did smell wonderful and the sauce over rice or noodles is pretty good, but thin.  And the chicken was boring and flavorless.  Maybe better over breaded breasts or bone-in.

A bit of a disappointment.  The flavors were all too strong and meshed together in an unusual way.  I would recommend less capers and no artichoke juice and more mushroom to make it a bit more bland.  It really had too much punch to it.

Quite tasty, though it would also be good with the addition of any herbs or seasonings desired. I don't care for capers myself, but my fiance, who absolutely loves both capers and artichokes, was very pleased with the meal. I will definitely try this recipe again.

I was so hopeful for this recipe, and true, it smelled good, but there was nothing exceptional about the taste...especially for the price of ingredients in the recipe.  It wasn't bad, but I won't make it again
