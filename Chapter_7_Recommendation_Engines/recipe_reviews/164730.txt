Delish~Very nice original taste.  I used butter in place of shortening and watch these guys cause they burn easy.  I recommend 8 min max.

Excellent!  Did 1/2 cup of margarine instead of adding the shorting.  I decreased the white sugar to 1/4 cup.  It think it is still too sweet.  Next time I will decrease on the sugar again.

I made the recipe exactly as it is written and we loved them!  If you're a big fan of coconut and butterscotch, these are the cookies for you!

Well, learned my mom does NOT like butterscotch... but everyone else in my house loved it! My mom had to stop my dad from having too many. He liked the idea she didn't like it so there's more for him. Score 1 for dad! However, the great thing about this recipe is that butterscotch can easily replaced with chocolate chips. Score 1 for mom! Sorry dad.

In this recipe, Coco stands for "coconut" not for "cocoa-chocolate" and it's the coconut that givs these cookies their unique flavor. The mixture of butter/crisco means the cookies come out not too crunchy but a nice thickness, somewhat soft and in the middle. Not too sweet or too "butterscotchy," these were a hit when I made them for a neighborhood party. Great smell too!

My 13-year-old made these himself because he loves the 2 main flavors in this cookie. We didn't use any shortening, and just replaced it with butter, and used wheat flour. These were really delicious!

Nice, sweet cookies...I ended up lightly greasing the cookie sheet since my first batch stuck a little.  They were also somewhat thin so I might consider increasing the flour a bit.  Still good though!

Absolutely wonderful and easy.  The surprise cookie hit of the season.  I added 2/3 butterscotch chips and 1/3 chocolate and it was excellent.

Terrific flavor and texture!   I only made changes to "healthify" - only 1/4 c white sugar instead of 1/2 c.  1/2 c white & 1/2+1/8 c wheat flours.  Next time, I'll exchange some butter for applesauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

With everyones rave reviews I took a chance and multiplied the recipe X 6 for a large group. Didn't have butter flavored shortening so went with margarine only, they were great! Thanks for a great cookie!

My husband absolutely loves this recipe!   I use all butter and no shortening.  Hubby doesn't like coconut, so make half w/coconut and 1/2 w/out.  The batch w/out coconut spreads more,so need to leave plenty of room on the cookie sheet. 

Reliable, excellent tasting cookie!

THESE WERE AMAZING! I switched it up by using all butter, and also in place of a cup of shredded coconut (my kids aren't huge fans of coconut) I used 1/2 cup of coconut and 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. left them a little bit underdone in the center and OMG- insanely yummy.

Yummy. It's not a fancy cookie but if you like coconut +/- butterscotch chips, give this recipe a shot. I don't like sweet cookies so I decreased white sugar by half (used 1/4 C) and bakes some cookies without butterscotch chips. Also, I replaced 1/4C + 1/8C of white flour with whole wheat flour. Cookie turned out well but next time, I'll try 10minutes instead of 12 minute to make it chewier. Overall, simple recipe which yielded simple coconut/butterscotch cookies.
