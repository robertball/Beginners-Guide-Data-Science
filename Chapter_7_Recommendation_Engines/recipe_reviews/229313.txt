Hi! Thanks for the great reviews.  I submitted this recipe (because it's awesome!) :) and I meant to change the amount of english muffins.  You're right- it only takes one package.  Unfortunately I have no idea how to go in to the recipe and change that!  So, hopefully people will read the reviews.  If not, they'll have a leftover package of English muffins!

I really liked this one a lot. I used some morning star farms veggie sausage patties, double fiber whole wheat english muffins and egg whites. I do like a bit more egg so I added a bit more. I'll make this again.. really easy. Don't know why I never thought of using english muffins, but it was better than using bread.

Agree this is a great breakfast casserole.  I use Canadian Bacon instead of sausage and really enjoy that flavor (as well as saving fat and calories).

This was a very good recipe, something different for a small Sunday brunch, but my wife finds chopped green chilis too spicy for her, so I substituted a diced Cubanella and cooked them in with the sausage.
I also wanted a little more "substance" to the strata, so I added mushrooms and chopped onion.
I loved the texture of the combined egg/sour cream mixture.
Will make this one again!
Note: as it was for two, I used two Muffins in a 6" x 6" square baking dish, cut the ingredients in half.

So very good! Made this last night and baked this morning....love these kind of casseroles. I used whole wheat English muffins and yes 1 pk is way more than enough. I actually was one muffin shy of a full pk and I even had to cut some in half to fit around the edges of my 9x13. I used 7 whole eggs and 3 egg whites (had leftover whites in the fridge), used cheese and garlic chicken sausage out of the casing and crumbled. I think next time I will use 2 cans of diced green chilies....they really add a great flavor to this. All in all there is hardly any left as everyone had seconds....thank you!

So yummy and easy to make! I forgot to buy mozzarella, so just used cheddar. I made it for a breakfast for 25 soldiers and got rave reviews!

OMG!!!  Just brought this in for my office potluck and it's gone!  Fabulous!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, but couldn't help adding 1/2 diced onion when browning the spicy sausage.  I also sprinkled fresh chopped cilantro on top just before cutting into squares.  Everyone in my office is asking for the recipe.  YUMMO!

This is a delicious breakfast casserole! It is very simple to make, but only requires ONE package of English Muffins - not two.  There are 8 English Muffins in a pack and when they are split open you have 16 halves which is more than enough to cover the bottom of the pan, so I think there was a typo in the recipe.  But the layers of muffins on the bottom makes the perfect buttery "crust" and it was just perfect to pop in the oven on a busy morning for company or during the holidays!  I will be making this often - very delicious and easy!

I followed the recipe as written (except I used 1 package of english muffins), and it was fantastic.  I will make this again and not change anything!

I've made this and it's really terrific. I even goofed and put it together the morning I wished to serve and it turned out perfect. It reheats really well. Rave reviews from our guests. I did add some extra sausage and cheese. Don't leave out the green chilis, they aren't hot and they really give the dish a pop of something fresh and different tasting. It's my new favorite breakfast recipe!

We liked it. The casserole’s firm texture was a plus. Halved the recipe, used an 8" square Pyrex dish, and let chill for 3 hours before baking rather than chilling overnight. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written. The 35 minute bake time was still perfect for a smaller version of this recipe. If doing this again, we would alter the egg/sour cream/green chili mixture by adding chopped mushrooms and onions, reduce or omit the butter, and sub Canadian bacon for the sausage. We will make the modified version again. Thank you for sharing, amycheryl.

Excellent. I served this to guests and they loved it. I will have to say that it does not taste the same or very good as left overs, so make just enough for the one meal.

Easy and enjoyable.Visiting family loved this-even a 5 y/o 
Used LF sour cream and turkey sausage to reduce calories.
Wondered if it is necessary to butter the1 pkg of E. muffins-
may try without next time.

Excellent!  Made this for a crowd during the Thanksgiving holiday.  This recipe will be a regular in our house.  Love the green chilies...may even kick it up a notch spice wise next time I make it.  English muffins are a wonderful crust.  Great recipe!

Delicious. Used Italian sausage instead of pork. No need for chilies as Italian sausage  adds great spice to it.  Love this recipe.

I recently made this recipe for my family to eat on Christmas morning. I prepared the recipe the night before following the instructions closely. I used approximately 8 english muffins, cutting a few to cover the bottom completey. I also used Bob Evan's Savory Sage sausage, a favorite breakfast sausage in my home. Wow! What a hit this was! Our 6 year old loved it, and my teenage son even took leftovers to go to his girlfriend's home. Will definately make again.

This is a great egg bake. The first time I made it, I used italian sausage. Very good. 2nd time I made, I used bratwurst that need to be used and added cooked carrots and broccoli. I also added onions. I didn't have a can of chili so I used a bit of cayenne pepper. Very good also. I served it for dinner. My family really likes this recipe. I'll keep this recipe handy. Probably can use any meat leftovers. Very versatile recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Turned out ok.  Too much bread if you follow the recipe exactly.  And next time I will cube the English muffins instead of leaving whole.

I loved it, but it was a little too cheesy for our taste.  Next time I will put a little less cheese for a more eggy taste.  Otherwise delicious and easy!

Very good! This was the first time I followed a recipe exactly as written (except for using just one package of muffins).   I used Original Thomas' English Muffins which I think are the best because they are very lite and airy.  Cheaper muffins can be dense and heavy.  My daughter thought it was too spicy with the chili's but I thought it was necessary to include them.  Might just use a half a can next time, just for her.  Have made similar casseroles with bread.  This was a lot better! I definitely do this again.

Loved it! Actually didn't have english muffins (and wanted to use some other leftover muffins) so I went with five blueberry and five zucchini muffins, halved, and then followed the rest of the recipe. It was fantastic!

This was so yummy and was a huge hit with my Sunday School class at church.  I did make a few changes to suit my tastes by using 1 cup pepper jack and 1 cup fiesta blend cheese instead of what is listed.  Otherwise followed the recipe and it was fantastic!

This was easy and delicious.  We followed the recipe except we held the chiles out of the egg mixture and sprinkled them on half of the casserole later leaving the other half without chiles, for the kids. We found it took almost an hour to bake through, but it was worth the wait!  Will definitely make again.

This was great!  I don't care for mushy egg casseroles, but this wasn't mushy at all. 
The only thing I changed, was that I added 2 cans of green chilies.  It's even good cold.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This dish was spectacular! I made the recipe exactly as it was written with the exception of only using one package of English muffins. 
 It wasn’t dry like some breakfast casseroles can be. I think the addition of sour cream really played a role in that. The green chilies added a nice subtle flavor. If you really like green chilies you could definitely use two cans and make it a more prominent flavor. I made this for a work brunch and it was gone in no time!

Sometimes we end up with a lot of English muffins so was happy to find this and really liked it. Used American cheese because that’s what we had on hand and Southwest seasoning instead of chilies.

Loved this recipe. I ended up adding more green chiles because my family is obsessed with them, and a homemade Turkey breakfast sausage I always have hand. Otherwise, left the recipe the same and will absolutely make it again. So good!

I’ve made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. I use Jimmy Dean sage sausage and I skip buttering the English muffins.

This was excellent. I used this recipe for the base, and I added chives, green onion, fresh basil and mushrooms to mine! It was a hit... I made it twice now and both times it was gone, with requests for a copy of the recipe!

Not only was this easy but it was delicious. Instead of the sausage I added bacon and peameal bacon.(Americans call it Canadian Bacon.)
I didn't let it chill either and it still turned out great! Will be making this again! Thanks for sharing.

My sons devoured this the first time I made it - it is one of their all time faves. Just threw it together last night to take to a church event this morning. The ingredients cost me all of $14 at Aldi. This makes a good sized, well filled 13 x 9 casserole dish. It went fast yet again! Was just glad I could get a little portion for myself before it was gone. Note: Only 1 pkg. of the 12 oz English muffins is needed. I cut the muffins into 6 slices after buttering and pile them across the bottom of the casserole dish for nice bite size pieces. I double the amount of green chilies. I had extra brown and serve sausage links - warmed them up, sliced them thinly and threw them in with the cooked pork sausage.

I make this to have on Christmas morning and I would definitely make this again.  I used diced canadian bacon as another reviewer did.  Only six muffin halves fit in my dish, so I cut out one egg.  Used plain greek yogurt as opposed to the sour cream (personal preference).  This was easy to prepare and tasted great.  I've looked at a lot of these types of overnight casseroles and I think I picked the right one here!

I stay away from breakfast recipes that call for a ridiculous number of eggs; this recipe is perfect!  I reduce the servings for my family of four, but leftovers do heat up nicely.  I've made it as is and I've also added in broccoli. This is one I come back to often! Nice weekend breakfast, thanks for sharing!

Very yummy! I followed the ingredients to the letter, but I did not let it sit. I assembled and immediately baked it. I plan on making this again and letting it sit to see if there is a difference.  Nonetheless, great and easy to make.  I paired this with a delicious slow cooker French toast recipe. I think I'm going to try different ingredients for variety, can't wait.

This was a HUGE hit with the whole family, adults and kids alike!  My 8-year-old niece said, "Things that look like this are usually gross, but this is really good!"  :)  I used sage sausage and omitted the butter, but otherwise followed it to a T (with one package of english muffins, of course).  So yummy!

So, a friend sent this and I thought it sounded easy enough,but super yummy. And, it was! The problem was that I didnt read it all (surprise!) before I started to cook and realized we needed to chill it over night. Boo hoo. So we collectively decided that we would give it a shot anyway and only chilled it for about 30 minutes. It turned out great. Everyone loved it. We added extra eggs like some users mentioned and that worked too.  Appreciate all the feedback and hope my experiment with NOT chilling overnight (like it was clearly explained in the recipe) still made this A-ok! Good luck and thanks for sharing.

I had to make an unexpected breakfast with the items that I had on hand and this recipe was perfect and adaptable! First, I defrosted a 12 oz. pack of Johnsonville Chipotle Monterey Jack Cheese Chicken Sausage in cold water. Meanwhile, I buttered a Pyrex dish and put two halved whole wheat English muffins in the dish.  I melted a little butter in the microwave and brushed the muffins lightly with butter (next time, I will omit the butter, the rest of the ingredients makes it creamy and the butter won't be missed). I halved and divided the cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese then I mixed the 4 eggs and ¾ c. light sour cream in a separate bowl and set it aside. I didn't have the chilies on hand therefore I omitted them. Next, I took the thawed sausages and cut off the skin, chopped, and browned/cooked in a pan. Since the sausages were frozen, I probably only used 10 oz. of meat after I skinned and ground them.
 
We each ate one serving (1/2 of a muffin plus all the goodies) and refrigerated one serving each for breakfast the next day. DELICIOUS! It was a perfect leftover! 

I cooked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Next time, I will probably decrease the cooking time by 5 minutes since the edges were brown. But, still YUMMY!

Perfect! I have made it twice, the 2nd time I didn't have mozzarella so I used all cheddar and it wasn't nearly as good. I did use bacon instead of sausage, to me it's just a better flavor and less greasy.
I do hate to change recipes around, but I omitted the green chilies. I'll make this over & over again.

I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was a big hit with my family.  I assembled it the night before, placed in the fridge, then baked as directed Christmas morning.  I only used one package of English muffins and added two additional eggs.  Easy, delicious, and flavorful.

I made this recipe for Christmas Brunch...my mother-n-law said it was the best breakfast casserole I have made yet and I have been hosting brunch for 7 years!! I fixed it exactly as recipe was written. I used 1/2 lb. jimmy dean regular and 1/2 lb. jimmy dean hot sausage.

I made this the same day I served it and it turned out beautiful and delicious! I was nervous that I didn't have time to chill it, but it was great. I used "Bays" English muffins which I think are better than Thomas. Will probably use this recipe for years to come for Christmas brunch!

I really liked this.  It wasn't soggy like some stratas I've had before.  It probably helps to use English Muffins--which is not what I used.  I actually used a stale bread braid bc it was too hard to eat any other way, so went looking for a strata.  It worked perfectly.  I also just used sausage patties and cut them into pieces.  I'd be willing to try this with English Muffins; I like the idea, and I think it would work very well.  I'll keep this one to try completely as written!  thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for the great recipe!  I love breakfast bakes and am always wanting to try new ones.  I ended up using 2 pans though because they wouldn't all fit into one, but followed the recipe and it turned out great!  I think adding some other ingredients like onions, green peppers, etc would be a good addition as well...maybe next time!

I only used one package of muffins & it turned out great! Easy to put together, make it the night before, just pop it in the oven in the morning & you have breakfast!
