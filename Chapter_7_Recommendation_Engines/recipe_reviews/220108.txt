This was definitely worth the try, and we will be making it again. Such an interesting blend of flavors. My wife thought it was a 5-star, but I was closer to 4.5 since it needed more vegetables or mushrooms. The broth was strong for me the first serving, but settled the next day. We used a 2lb boneless pork roast and kept all other ingredients the same, which seemed to be a perfect proportion. This would go good with rice as well; we used brown rice noodles.  Keep a spoon and fork handy! Thanks for posting this recipe!

My boyfriend and I were very hesitant as weâ€™ve never had a pork base soup before. But let me tell you, this soup is extremely delicious. I was hesitant to add Parmesan and lime together for the garnish, but we gave it a shot and with the soup and that combined it make a nice symphony. Will be making this again!! Only problem is my opinion in wanting more veggies like onion, mushroom or even garlic. So I will deff. Add that next time.

Didn't have bok choy, subbed celery instead.
