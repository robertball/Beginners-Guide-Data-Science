I found the texture to be very nice but the taste was really lacking.  I added about three tablespoons of coco powder as well as a chocolate icing and still found them very bland.  I am known for the cookies I bring to our office meetings and these were not a hit.  It was the first time I had cookies left to bring home.

These were very good.  I did modify the recipe a tiny bit...used self-rising flour, added one cup cup of chocolate chips to the cookie dough and I decreased the cooking time to 9 minutes.  Undercooking gives you a soft chewy texture which is what my family likes.  This would be a good recipe to play around with.  Adding coconut, nuts, vanilla chips or peanut butter chips, etc. would produce interesting results.  Thanks Nevena for your recipe.

These were just so-so. I thought the dough was terribly bland so after I baked about half the dough and tasted a cookie, I ended up adding some cocoa powder to the rest of the batch (would have equaled about 3Tbsp for the whole batch) and that gave a lot more flavor.  Still not great though.  The texture was also a little bit on the dry side. I don't think I'll chance it again.

I make cookies all the time and these ones were quite disappointing.

This has a great texture and was really easy to make.  I think the taste is a little bland, though.  So I frosted them with Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting (this site) and they are delicious!  The cookie is almost brownie-like.  I used half whole-wheat pastry flour.  I made these with my two older kids and we decorated them for Halloween/Fall.  They're a hit with everyone.  Oh, I only baked for 7 minutes, and let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute.  They stay soft, chewy and delicous this way.

This was really a yummy cookie! It was easy to make and a little bit different- a great way to get a chocolate fix when there isn't any cocoa powder in the house. They were easy enough for my 4-year-old to help with. We made small cookies- about walnut sized balls of dough- and they were just perfect. I'm thinking of making a Halloween version using licorice to make spider legs just after I take them out of the oven. I did cook them around 9-10 minutes because we like soft cookies.
