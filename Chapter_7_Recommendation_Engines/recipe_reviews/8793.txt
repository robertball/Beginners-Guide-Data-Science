Going along with the others...A great base recipe. I took the advice of another and added honey teriyaki sauce, garlic powder, pepper, coconut and raisins. I cooked three large chicken breasts (not pounded)with the mixture in a large foil pouch on 325 degrees. After 35 minutes, the breasts were still pretty raw so I turned up the hear to 385 degrees for another 15 minutes. The chicken was tender and flavorful even though it was cooking for a long time. So if you do it this way, turn up the heat to 375 for about 30 minutes. I also put the dish over orzo with fresh spinach and pine nuts mixed in and a little parmesan. Yummy, my family ate it up! Thanks!

I'm going to rate this a three because the basic idea is a very good one.  It was delicious, but I changed it a LOT.  I used tropical fruit cocktail in juice (not syrup).  I used chicken breasts and seasoned them with salt and a generous amount of fresh ground black pepper.  Smeared them with fresh minced garlic and topped them with the fruit cocktail, teriyaki sauce and raisins.  Bake them in the pouches for 35 minutes, let them rest and then topped them with coconut.  Yummy.  But like one reviewer said, if you have to change it that much, it's not the same recipe.  It's still a great concept.

Pretty much what I expected; a quick and easy way to start chicken; we just had some johnny's seasoning salt on the table to eat it with, and a nice flavorful rice and some veggies.
What to expect: A mild, slightly sweet chicken that takes four minutes to prepare (and how much of a blessing is that on a busy night!) with not a ton of flavor on its own...just have some spices on hand

I didn't have fruit cocktail so I substituted canned sliced peaches instead. It came out delicious. Spray cooking pan before adding chicken so it won't stick.

This is a great base recipe. I took the advice from other reviews and added my own seasonings.  I used a fruit medley in light fruit juice syrup (rather than fruit cocktail), and I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt/powder, chili powder, Old Bay seasoning, and Teriyaki sauce.  I also covered the dish while it was baking. Overall it turned out really well. It was very tender, and I would certainly try the recipe again using different seasonings. I rated this a 3 only because it will require some experimentation with seasonings to make this recipe complete.  I would certainly recommend it for a quick meal after a long day. Thanks for the great idea.

gross by itself, but i added my own teriyaki sauce which consisted of 1/3c of soy sauce, 1/3c brown sugar, a 1/3c of water and a dash of cinnamon. then added chunks of white onion and a few shakes of parsley.  these ingredients marrying with the fruit cocktail while cooking was really delicious!

I find it laughable this recipe is named "...Polynesian..."  there is absolutely NOTHING polynesian about it.  Sorry, this won't cut it with ANY polynesian that cooks. i rate it 1/2 a star for no prep, no creativity or taste. better luck next time.

Chicken was very tender.  I sprinkled caribbean jerk seasoning on the chicken before pouring in the fruit cocktail, due to previous reviews expressing blandness.  It was still missing a little something, but the family gobbled it up.

I topped the chicken first with a teriyaki sauce then baked it with the fruit cocktail.  No one in my family liked this - way too bland.

I gave this recipe 3 Stars because it needs something, don't quite know what that something is, though... Any idea's?
It was okay but nothing special.

It is a quick, easy recipe, but very little flavor.  I make it when I need a quick meal and make sure my side dishes carry great flavor.

As the others say, it is somewhat bland. But for the amount of effort put into it, it's not bad. It's good for novice cooks like me.

The chicken was too sweet and sticky. Maybe fresh fruit would be better. I am not a fan of really sweet stuff.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this.  It was the easiest meal ever!  I used a tropical fruit cocktail with lots of pineapple in it and also spinkled the chicken with chili powder as suggested by some of the other reviews.  It may not be an all-time favorite, but definately a wonderful dish to fix when your tired and don't feel like cooking.  Very moist and a nice combo of flavors (especially with the chili powder).  Add some white rice on the side and you've got a great easy meal.

Once again, this recipe shows how two people can have vastly different tastes.  My husband liked it. He said that this recipe made him realize that he likes sweet chicken recipes, even though he dislikes sweet beef recipes.  This dish wasn't to my taste, however.  I felt it was very bland, and couldn't really taste the fruit at all - of course, that might've just been me, I suppose.

I used tropical fruit cocktail and chicken breasts I had cleaned and halved I advance.  Then I came home from work, threw the ingredients in a baking dish and went for a jog.  So easy.  Pairs well with brown rice cooked in chicken broth and sweet chili sauce.

Very plain and bland.  We did it both with real chicken and with fake vegetarian chicken-like meat.  The fruit tasted pretty icky after baking.

the chicken had almost no flavor. It was juicy but definately not a good taste.

Excellent!! The chicken turns out very moist and juicy with an awesome flavor!
