I made this for a Thanksgiving pie contest, and well... I still don't know who won, but that is irrelevant of the fact that this pie is heaven! It turned out wonderfully! I made two, but one got messed up, so I told them not to judge it. Guess what? I come back and both pans are empty and people are trying to scoop up the last of the crust and spilled cream! It was a hit! Only thing: the cream was too... liquidy. I've whipped cream before, but this was different. Or maybe it WAS just me! :P Also, if you want, add some more sugar. The mocha part isn't just for a name. It's RICH and you can taste both the choc. and coffee (which I liked), so if you want, add extra sugar. My family didn't like it as much as my friends, b/c they wanted it sweeter. Last, be careful when you combine the egg mixture with the chocolate. Don't stop stirring the whole time to prevent the eggs from cooking! :)
