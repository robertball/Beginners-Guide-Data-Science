Very strong vinegary flavor.  I had to tone it down with half-and-half.  Too much Worcestershire sauce for me.

Way too much Worcestershire sauce! It was overpowering. I like meat cooked in sauce to tenderize it. This was just mixed together over the browned meat at the last minute. This was just not an enjoyable meal for us.

This is easy to make, we used rice have enough left to put on noodles.  I thought it was really salty when I tasted it, but when it was on rice, I had to add salt. I used the beef broth as I thought it would be less salty.  It was really good, hubby was pleased.

My daughter (14) found this recipe because she does not like the beef tips recipe I use with mushrooms.  
She did an AMAZING JOB!  She may have cooked it longer than the recipe called for, she didn't know it would thicken as it cooled.  BUT, I think it only made it better    ; )     (mom perspective).

Based on the other reviews, I halved the recommended amount of both the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. It was still too vinager-y!! I added milk and a bit more water, and cornstarch as necessary to re-thicken the sauce. Eventually I found a yummy beef flavor that wasn't overpowering. I also cooked the meat/onion mixture as suggested, and the meat was a bit on the tough side! not necessarily the fault of the recipe creator, but perhaps this recipe needs to be the slow cook method (either crockpot or low temp in stove for hours, etc)! I'm overall happy with the final product, but I definitely recommend adjusting the sauce to taste as you're cooking!

My family loved this! I always use lite soy sauce and did in this recipe as well. I also used Better than Bouillon beef flavor for the beef bouillon cubes. Next time I will use less or use lower sodium beef broth. It was a little salty to me, but I didn't salt the noodles so all was well. I also wonder if flank steak sliced really thin would be more tender than the stew meat.

My family enjoyed this very much! I made some simply no yolk noodles with it and it's all gone. Will definitely make again!
