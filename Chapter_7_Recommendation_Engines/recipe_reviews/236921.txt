Easy. Fast. Not a ton of dirty dishes. Kids ate it. Husband ate it. SCORE!  We doubled it and had lots of good leftovers.

Delicious! I did switch things up a bit. I used ground turkey and cooked some fresh garlic with the onion. i also used a combo of a 10oz can of rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles and 4.5oz of tomato sauce.

It was very good and filling! I think I will omit or add less onions the next time I make it though, that's just a personal preference of mine.

Other than my preference for a little more salt on my food, this was excellent. The best part about this recipe is it’s ability to be adjusted. I’ll try it with Mexican style shredded cheese next time and maybe add more or different veggies to it. I want try it with ground lamb as well. Thank you for a great starter recipe.

5 stars for being fast, easy, cheap, filling and good! I followed the recipe exactly. This is perfect for a busy work night...I had to go grocery shopping after work and we still got to eat dinner in time. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

My hamburger is in two pound chubs so I doubled the recipe, everything except the corn and the diced tomatoes. I left those at one can each because I was scared the tomatoes would make it too soupy. It turned out wonderful! I wish I could've made it a bit cheesier because, come on, who doesn't like a little more cheese? I might try shells and cheese next time to give it that creamy cheese sauce as seen in one of the reviews. Will absolutely be making this again!

So easy and fast! The only thing I changed was adding Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese. My kids are 9 and 6 years old and both loved it! I also added a little Sriracha to mine. Definitely a keeper!

It was easy, but I think it needed salt and pepper added. Also did not thicken until we let it sit for ten minutes.

I added some extra chili powder and melted cheddar over it. Kids loved it.
