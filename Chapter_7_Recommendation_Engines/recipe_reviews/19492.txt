This was definitely the best clam chowder I have ever made!
My store didn't have fresh clams so I had to use 2 cans of baby clams with the juice, the clam juice was rather expensive so I only bought 1- 8 oz. bottle and substituted 5 cups of chicken broth and it still turned out great!!
Thanks so much for sharing

I've tried making clam chowder using many different recipes and this is the best recipe I have ever used. From now on it's the only recipe for clam chowder I will use. I substituted fat free half and half and it was still wonderful.

Definitely need to fry up some bacon for this!  Chop bacon into bite sized bits and fry up crisply.. use the fat to saute onion and celery along with a reduced amount of butter.  I also like a stalk or two of chopped celery.  Also, if you are using canned clams, don't boil your clams in the liquid, just reserve them and add them in with the cooked potatoes at the end.  Otherwise your clams will be very chewy and rubbery.  This recipe assumes the use of fresh clams, which is ideal, but not always practical.  Also, there are different kinds of clam species.. most that you buy in the store are best for steamers, but these lack the flavor of clams best used in chowders.  Canned clams are generally best for chowders in my experience.  I also add a pinch of dill weed, a teaspoon or two of Old Bay and float a pat of butter on top when serving.  Yummo!  As an ex-Newporter, I can testify that this is the REAL DEAL!!!  VERY NICE and thanks for sharing!!

This is a really good recipe.  I used a little less on the clams (had to use canned as I am not in N.E.)and more on the potatoes.  I did brown four slices of bacon first and cut out 1 Tbs Butter in place.  Tasted much better the next day!  Very good stuff!  Serve with some clam cakes and you are set for a meal!  Brought back a little of home (RI) for us military people!

My husband and I both Loved this recipe!  I used 4 cans of clams and 4 bottles of clam juice, plus one can of chicken broth.  I also chopped up a couple of stalks of celery and sauted along with the onions.  I also added only 2 cups of fat-free half and half.  I didn't have fresh dill, so I substituted dried dill, but it was still awesome.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Dee!!!

Great Recipe! I did not have extra clam juice , other than from my fresh clams and so I used some chicken stock instead. Also instead of half and half I used skim milk, still as creamy and tasty. Although I did not have any dill on hand, the soup was wonderful. This will by the recipe I use from now on!! For sure a once a month meal!!

I always thought making clam chowder is complicated therefore I never tried it, but since my husband always comment how tasty his mother makes clam chowder I thought I give it a try.  Not only was this recipe easy to make, but it was very delicous.  My husband loved it.  Like other I substitute with can whole clams all three cans of them.  Got to love those clams!

The flavor of this chowder is so fantastic! I used canned clams and I cut the clam juice in half, and substituted chicken broth for the rest (clam juice is expensive!). I recommed more potatoes. I like a thicker chowder, so I had to add a cornstarch/milk mixture toward the end to thicken it. Per my husband's request, I think I will add bacon text time and see how we do with that. I made this soup for my mother in law for her birthday- and she loved it- along with all the other guests. It was quite a compliment, because the family that I married into are seafood experts- and live on this stuff.

First of all, I'm a New Englander, so I've had many great chowders in my lifetime and have to say this is just ok.
I suggest adding pork fat and parsley instead of dill.  Milk is also ok in place of 1/2 and 1/2.

I made this Clam Chowder last night to serve today.  This is an excellant recipe.  I too, added several pieces of bacon fried and crumbled.  I made breadbowls to serve the chowder in. (Got a new bread machine for Christmas)  Great winter lunch.  I will be making this again.

Made this last week with clams caught by hand at Ninilchik, Alaska.  Added half a pound of bacon to the recipe but otherwise followed it to the letter.  Absolutely fabulous!  Total crowd pleaser.  We killed a pot in a single sitting.  Awesome recipe!

I made this on Christmas Eve day for the family to have prior to a late dinner.  I kept it warm in a crockpot (low setting with lid off--stirring occasionally). The only change I made was using 2 cups of half-and-half versus 3 cups for a slightly thicker chowder.  My husband said it was the best he'd ever had....and our older daughter raved about it too.  This is THE BEST!

Wonderful chowder recipe!  FIrst time I'd ever made it, and we had some frozen razor clams and used those.  Clam juice was almost 3.00 a bottle for 8 ounces, so we used two bottles and then chicken stock for the remaining 32 oz and made sure to put the clam juice from the clams in.  I thought it still had great clam flavor.  Cooking the potatoes separately is genius; that way they are never underdone or mushy.  I also added celery to the onion mix and crumbled bacon at the end, per others' reviews.  Rich, creamy, satisfying chowder that got rave reviews, thank you!

this is great! i've made it as the recipe is written, but i more often add scallops, shrimp and fish (and some extra potatoes) with the clams.  i also use unpeeled red-skinned potatoes and add celery to make a more colorful presentation.  definitely a slow cooker meal on busy days like christmas or new years day.

Outstanding!  This is the holy grail of clam chowder recipes.  I used the canned clams, and probably will continue to do so for convenience.  But I used a mixture of the whole baby clams and the chopped clams the first time - next time I'll just use whole clams.

I made this recipe with a 50oz can of clams from Costso and used fish broth instead of clam juice. I also added 1/2 lb of diced bacon and 1/4 cup of dry red wine. I made it for a large gathering and people couldn't get enough of it. I served it with homemade garlic croutons on top( 3 on each bowl) guests said it wasby far the best clam chowder they had ever had. It was so good I had to make itagain the next night.

This chowder was very good.  I did change a few things though.  I added bacon and only 2 tablespoons of butter instead of a half cup.  I added two cans of chicken broth and filled one of the empty cans with half and half and that was plenty of liquid. I used two cans of minced clams in the juice and half a bottle of clam juice.  This was very good and I will make it again!

Wow! THis was fabulous! Being in Wisconsin I don't have a lot of access to clams so I was stuck with buying cans. I used four small cans of chopped clams with their juice, 3 bottles clam juice and 12 oz of chicken broth. I would love to taste the original because everyone **raved** about the way I made it!! I do think that it benefitted from a night in the fridge..it was better the second day with a sprig of dill and a sprinkle of old bay on top along with a crusty sourdough roll..yummmy.

TERRIFIC!  I've never thought to make clam chowder before.  This was so good even my kiddos ate it (two 8 yr olds and a 2 yr old!)  I did add a jalapeño and scaled for 5 servings, and there's quite a bit leftover.  This was better than every clam chowder I've ever had in a restaurant!

This was the best clam chowder I have ever eaten bar none. I did substitute chicken broth for some of the clam juice, but otherwise follwed recipe as written.  The whole family gobbled it right up.  My Father-in-law says he will never be able to eat restaurant clam chowder again. Thank you!

Was a great Super bowl meal. I also halfed the clam juice with chicken broth.  I had a hard time with the butter and flour roux, and had to add 1 cup buttermilk mixed well with about a third cup of milk to thicken the consistancy.  Next time I'll almost double the potatoes and clams.  We like it thick and chunky. Great reciepe Dee!

Very, very good - but not exact.  I used mostly chicken stock (one bottle of clam juice), two cans of clams, added one can of corn and two chopped stalks of celery.  The biggest change, though, was that I used two cans of evaporated skim milk instead of half & half, which cuts about 90 grams of fat from the recipe.  My clam chowder snob husband heartily approved and didn't taste any difference with the skim evap milk.  We had clam chowder at a restaurant the other day and I really think this was just as good or better.  Try it with the Cheddar Biscuits from this site.

My first time ever making clam chowder!  I will be making this one again.  It was awesome, took some advice from other reviews: 6 strips of bacon cooked with the butter (6 Tbsp), 3 stalks of celery, 3 cans (10oz each) chopped baby clams, 2 jars (8oz each)clam juice, 4 Cups chicken broth, 2 cups half and half.  I served this soup in mugs with sliced pugliese bread warmed in a 250 degree oven.  So So good!  Thank you. Thank you.

This was very good, however, I made some changes the next time I made this.  I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth, saving the broth to use for thickening more, just took about 1/2 cup of broth, whisked in a little flour,(Wondra Flour is good for this as it doesn't lump up) and added to the pot to cook and thicken the chowder more, also, didn't like the dill so left out and added a little garlic powder, more suiting for our taste.  Thank you for your submission!

This is just yummy. Made a few modifications-took the advice of others and added some bacon which gave a great flavor.  Also used 2% milk instead of half and half and this soup was still nice and thick. No fresh clams available so I used canned clams and added them at the end to not overcook. Will make again!

SOOO GOOD!!!!! I've made chowder before and this is the simplest recipe I've used.  I am not sure I used the specified amount of flour and butter because I'm not experienced with using a rue as a thickening agent.  Because the rue can be made aside... i made a little extra and put it aside JUST IN CASE I'd need to thicken it even more.  I also added celery and some old bay.

So-so. This recipe needs some salt port and/or bacon, also some celery. Just too bland for me. Also, what's with the dill?

Awesome chowder...try to use fresh clams vs canned if you can and don't forget that little bit of fresh dill at the end. I'm from Rhode Island so have had my share of great chowder and this is right up there with the best! Enjoy! Oh btw, the only thing I added was about a TSP of diced salt pork into the butter and onion saute.

We had a Soup Party at our house a few nights ago that included homemade breads and rolls, 2 kinds of chili, 3 soups, one stew and This Recipe for Newport Clam Chowder. Well, the results are in: The Clam Chwder stole the show. The raves were mainly about the flavor. A few guests, however, confided in me that it wasn't thick enough. I WILL make this again to see if I did something wrong but will thicken it if necessary.

This is, without a doubt, the BEST clam chowder ever!  And I didn't even use fresh clams!  Instead I used 6 8-oz cans of chopped clams with clam juice already in it.  I like my chowder a bit thicker, so I used the same amount of flour, 1 small onion, reduced the half and half to 2 cups and potatoes to approximately 6 smallish-sized ones.  Makes plenty for 2 with lots of leftovers.  I've been making it this way for years now, and everyone who has tried it swears its the best NE Clam Chowder they have tasted!

We made this for Christmas and it was such a hit, I have shared the recipe with family and made it again at their request! We substituted; 4 cans clam, 1 bottle clam juice with 5 cups chicken broth, added 3 celery stalks and 3 bacon strips and 2 cups of half and half.
This recipe is worth the trouble!

This was waaaayyy too clammy tasting for us.  I followed the directions to a "T".  It would probably be good if you cut down on the clam juice and thickened it up a bit.  I won't be making this again.

The best clam chowder recipe I have ever tried.  I used canned clams, and frozen cubed potatoes to save time, and this turned out wonderful.  My husband and his friends ate it all in less than a day, and they are begging for more already.  I really like the dill weed- it gives it a nice flavor.

awesome, i left the peels on the potatoes, thats really all i did different. I cleaned out the grocery store of clam juice but i had enough. Came out delicious, a tiny bit runny at first, but it thickened after an hour after it was done. Thanks!

Wonderful. Cooked potatoes in chicken stock and used that liquid and half the called for clam juice.  Used 2 c. cream and 1 c. half & half.  2 T. bacon drippings added to roux mixture and crumbled the bacon for the top of chowder. Added 3 stalks of celery.   (Have also added fresh crab and lobster and have enjoyed that.) Add it at the very end and just heat through. Served in french bread bowls. Super Bowl hit and not a drop or bread crumb left! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is REALLY GOOD! Being that I am a vegetarian, I replaced the clams with Oyster mushrooms that I diced into small clam-type pieces and sauteed in 3 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of white wine. I used water instead of clam stock and it tasted really good. I no longer have clam chowder envy..LOL!!
Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Growing up in New England, I consider myself a chowdah aficionado.  This recipe has excellent flavor!  I did cut back on the onions (just 1 large) & added a thickening agent.  Authentic chowdah should be a bit thicker.  I will absolutely make this again & again.  I'm serving it over the holidays w/ a cesear salad & fresh bread.  What a great meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as written. Although I found this recipe to be easy, and we all thought it was absolutely delicious, it did taste more like onion chowder than clam chowder.

I decided to dice 6 slices of smokey bacon, frying it until crispy, and added that to the pot in hopes of masking some of the onion flavor and it worked perfectly!

I will definitely make this recipe again, however; I will reduce the amount of onion and just use 1/2 of a large onion. I will also keep the bacon addition.

This is the Best Clam Chowder recipe ever.  I have made it many times and it is always a big hit with our dinner guests.  I have also added shrimp, scallops, salmon and mussels to this recipe and it always turns out great.  I also add chicken bouillon to the recipe.

This is truly the best New England clam chowder recipe I've ever tasted! I recently made it for a dinner party and it received rave reviews! The only change I made is instead of fresh clams I used 6 cans of canned and mixed the broth from the canned clams with chicken broth to equal 48oz. Oh, and I also added celery.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Excellent!!  I used 3 cans of vegetable broth for the clam juice and 4 cans of clams instead of fresh.  I also added some celery and instead of butter, I fried up some chopped up bacon to cook the onion and celery in.  I used 2 cups cream with one cup milk.  Great chowder!

Clam chowder has forever been my favorite soup, and this may be my favorite recipe!  Slight alterations: added 2 tbsp. bacon drippings to butter/onions and used fat free half and half.  Creamy & delicious!

Tastes great.  Clams end up tough though.  Next time add the clams at the very end.

WOW!  The flavor is fantastic!! I did tweak it a bit according to some previous reviews (adding carrots, celery, and bacon, as well as substituting some of the clam juice for chicken broth).  Turned out great.  The only thing is it was a bit soupier than we like our chowder, so next time I will be thickening it up a bit.  Definitely a keeper!!

This chowder has one of the best flavors. I would recommend making it a bit thicker though and make sure to chop the onions small. I left mine a bit too big and it was pretty chunky.

Unbelievable!  I am a soup-a-holic and have tried more than my fair share of recipes from this website.  This one by far outshines all others.  My better half devoured bowl after bowl.  I only added a touch more dill in addition to celery.

This recipe was fabulous and easy.  Instead of littlenecks, we used 20 quahogs, steamed them first and then chopped.  By accident, we used 2 cups half and half and 1 cup heavy cream.  It still came out great, but I think the half and half would have made it a little less rich.  Enjoy!

***Save time AND money!*** Instead of buying fresh clams, buy 6 canned and reserve the juice (since it's packed in clam juice anyway) and buy only 3 bottles of juice. The amount of clam juice in the cans is enough to save you $$ on more. Now, since you decided to use canned clams, you do NOT need to cook these up on the clam juice as they will become rubbery and tough if you do. Also, cook the potatoes in a separate pot ahead of time and you'll be all set to throw everything together. Add 3 slices of bacon and celery if desired. You now have a clam chowder that has TONS more clams and you've saved money on juice. IF you wanted to save more money then I suppose you could cut the clam juice by adding chicken broth and juice just from the canned clams but I have never tried this myself

I loved this recipe.  I took reviewers advice and used four slabs of bacon fat and offset the difference with butter.  I used five cans of clams, one bottle of clam juice and the rest was chicken broth.  I added the clams when I put in the potatoes.  I also added the chopped cooked bacon, and some red pepper and old bay seasoning.  My husband and I loved it.  I also used four stalks of celery with the chopped onions.  This is a keeper.

I made this recipe without reading any of the reviews, but the basic ingredients and procedures were in line with how I usually make chowder.... loved it!  I'm not sure if I used exact amounts listed (I've never tried to measure a quart of shucked clams) but I used a 51oz can of clams from Costco and added about 2 cups of water.  I added three stalks of celery to the onions and butter and instead of 3 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 I used 2 cups fat free milk and 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2.  Still really creamy and good.  My family loved it!  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

I am a fair cook, but I have never made anything quite this excellent. Have had many Clam Chowders in and about New England. This is by far the best ever!  This recipe has made me the family clam chowder king! John, South Carolina.

Fantastic Clam Chowder. I wanted a chowder recipe that does not rely on bacon fat to make it good. This recipe is phenomenal! Everyone loved it, including my 4 year old picky eater. I didn't think my sons were going to eat it so I made half the recipe. My sons polished their portion and asked for seconds! I had dried dill weed at home but it worked out. Definitely a keeper!

The best Clam Chowder I have ever had! I did not add as much clam juice, I simply used the juice from the can and one bottle of clam juice, this was plenty when making for a serving for 4. I like my chowder thicker anyway. Also used minced clams and some whole, added celery finely chopped. It was fantastic!

We cut this recipe in half and used 2 jars of clam juice and one chicken broth to cut the cost. We used yukon gold potatoes. It was excellent!

Excellent recipe! I just got great comments from my guests. Special thanks to all the reviewers that suggested adding celery stalks and bacon. Wonderful addition that makes this dish even better. We have a winner!

I just signed up for this site to let you know "This clam cowder is amazing". Good job, I can see how it won a chowder cookoff. Thanks for sharing! Used 2 slices of bacon and celery for flavor as well.

Made a few small changes for economy and taste.  Used 5 cans of minced/chopped clams with juice, 2 12 oz cans of clam juice, and made up the remainder of the liquid with homemade chicken stock.  Used diced frozen potatoes, heated in microwave, and added some white pepper as well as black.  Cut half-and-half to 2 cups.  Delicious!

Oh my goodness! This is the best!  We made it pretty much exactly as stated, only we used 4 cans whole baby clams and 2 cans chopped clams and the juice instead of fresh.  WOW!  We'll be making this over and over, our new favorite chowder recipe!  Thanks!

I have used this recipe several times and really like it.  we usually have an aboundance of razor clams and this recipe is perfect for using the tougher neck.  I usually grind the necks up like "clamburger" (new word I think)  I save some of the other tender parts for larger chunks.  Next time I make this I will fry some bacon bits into it for a little complexity.  Great recipe!!

This is a wonderful tasting chowder.  It would have been helpful, however, if the recipe had stated the total amount of clam juice needed.  I did modify the amount of clam juice.  We had clams that we dug ourselves and they had a lot of juice of their own.  I used only an additional 27 ounce can of clam juice and it was perfect!

I gave this 4 because I thought it was a 3 and my husband thought it was a 5. He thought it was really delicious and requested that I make it again. I, on the other hand, thought it was sort of runny and just odd. I followed the recipe exactly. My butter/onion/flour mix was so lumpy and the lumps never dissolved. I think it has potential with modifications, but I will probably try another recipe before I attempt this one with modifications.

EXCELLENT chowder.  I doubled the recipe because I was having a crowd.  Followed the recipe exact except for leaving out the dill and adding some salt.....just a preference.  Everyone raved.  I liked the fact that I didn't have to deal with cooking bacon (unhealthy too) like so many other chowder recipes.  This one is a keeper!

This clam chowder is sensational! We have a strange family tradition of eating clam chowder on Christmas Eve. This is the first year I spent Christmas Eve with my husband's family and I made this chowder. It was a huge success!I might use less flour next time because the soup was a bit rich. This is probably going to replace our old recipe and become the new tradition!

Good stuff! I used canned clams and they were fine. I felt nothing needed to be changed in this recipe, except next time I may add another potato out of preference. Good work!

I didn't have enough clam juice on hand so I increased the amount of half and half to three cups and reduced the clam juice to two bottles.  It was an absolute hit my family and my in-laws.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

This is my first time making Clam Chowder.  The recipe was very easy to follow.  I didn't start boiling the potatoe first.  I also add 2TBS of cornstarch because it didn't look thick enough...but realize that the chowder thickens when it cooled.  My family loved it! Will make this recipe again. Oh...tabasco sauce adds a nice kick! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great recipe I had to change a few things because I didn't have the ingreds on hand but it worked.  I had to sub the clams and clam sauce with Progresso White clam sauce with garlic and herb I also used whole milk instead of cream I also added small chucks of smoked ham and yellow corn.  Thanks for a great recipe.

YUM.  I used 4 (6.5oz) cans of minced clam and did not drain them to get more clam flavor.  Decreased the other liquid by one cup (which I used chicken broth instead of bottles and bottles of clam juice), added an extra potato and some celery, a 1/2 t. or so of Old Bay and used dried dill.  VERY good.  Served with cheddar bay biscuits.  Thanks for an awsome recipe!!

This was an amazing recipe.  Very easy to follow, and the results were incredible.  I tweaked it just a bit.  I added some bacon, celery, & carrots.  I used 2 cups of cream and 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 to make it a bit richer (instead of the suggested 3 cups of ½ and ½).  My family loved it and I have been asked to make it for some friends!!

What a fantastic recipe! I just made a double batch for a crowd of 40 people. I actually made this soup and a Corn, Sausage and Pepper chowder I found on this site also. Both received rave reviews from everyone. I can't say I followed the recipe to a T. But I stuck pretty close. I did add more butter in the onion and flour mixture and used some cream with the 1/2 and 1/2. Not the healthiest recipe in the world, but so yummy. Will be making this again for sure.

This recipe was good, however a little thin.  I recommend more potatoes.  At the end I ended up adding instant potato flakes to make it thicker.  I would also use the suggested amount of clam juice...1/2 clam and 1/2 chicken broth just didn't cut it, but then again I like clams a lot.  I also used canned clams... way easier and cheaper.

This recipe is simply incredible.  I have made it time and again, and it has never disappointed.  It makes a TON of soup though.  What I do is cut everything in half except for the butter--I keep that amount the same.  Why not?  It tastes great-very rich.  I also use dried dill weed, and it spreads through the soup nicely.  I will never use a different clam chowder recipe again.

I made this chowder for a church supper, and some people wanted thirds!  Because clam juice is expensive, I substituted half of the clam juice with fish bullion (available in the seafood section of grocery stores).  I also used 1/2 fat-free half and half.  Make sure you rinse the clams and look for shell pieces!

The amount of clam juice required was a bit shocking at first, but the soup turned out absolutely delicious.  I ate it with some saltine crackers and fresh sourdough for dipping.  Tastes even better than my mom's recipe...and that is good!

This is delicious clam chowder! One of the things I liked about it was it is not so thick your spoon stands in it alone. I used canned clams, fat free half and half and added some well-done bacon ... my family loves it and its pretty easy to make. Will definitely be bringing it to summer cook outs.

Oh this chowder was so good!  I'm from Maine, so no traditional chowder from my neck of the woods has celery and carrots in it like many of the recipes on here.  Gah....  I subbed a few ingredients, as I only had bottled clam juice and canned chopped clams.  I also only had light cream instead of half and half.  But the consistancy was SO good!  Thick, creamy and reminded me of canned clam chowder but without the nasty canned soup taste, of course!  Oh, and I used bacon grease in place of butter.  A+

Liked it alot, I used canned clams with the juice and chicken broth, also heavy cream instead of half and half; as well as I added some spicy chili pepper( i like some spice to all foods) served it in a sourdough bread bowl.

Amazing!  No need for salt and pepper or any other seasonings.  I did use canned clams and had to use a cup of flour to thicken but one of my pickiest guests took some home with her!!!  Of course she only gave it a 4.9999999999999.....

As written, this would be very bland, however this is quite tasty with the addition of bacon.  Don't cut back on the clam juice though or it won't have the underlying clam taste, regardless of how many actual clams you toss in.  I mis-read the recipe and was 1 bottle short on the juice and it was quite noticeable.

Loved this clam chowder. I did use chicken broth, as I did not have clam juice. Did use lots of fresh clams though, and it still had great clam flavor.

I'm giving this 5 stars b/c I think as written it will be 5 stars.  We had to substitute chicken broth for some of the clam juice and also didn't have enough clams. We added some carrots and celery too.  Next time I will follow the recipe to a T and I'm sure it will be even better.

Very tasty!  My grocery store only had 3 jars of clam juice, so I substituted chicken broth for the rest. Also, used 4 cans of clams as fresh are not available here.  I did add a few pieces of crumbled up bacon at the end, and it was fabulous. It did come out a little thinner than I would like, so I may try to thicken it up next time.  Didn't affect the flavor at all though.  Still delicious.  Makes a lot, so I was able to freeze some for another day!

This chowder is excellent!  I am very picky about clam chowder and I generally only eat it at a favorite local restaurant, because I have been eating it there since I was a kid.  I have since moved away and I had a craving for chowder so I thought I would give this one a try.  I am glad I did!  It was very easy to make too.  I used 5 medium potatoes, 4 cans of chopped clams, 2 jars of clam juice and 2 cans of chicken broth.  Delicious!  I can't wait to make it again.

The best!! I didn't have any dill so I didn't use it, we like it with pepper anyways, I also used more potatoes and clams and less clam juice (it's expensive!) and it turned out awesome!!

I'm sorry to say that I didn't have the dillweed this recipe called for, so I made it without -- It was still pretty fabulous.  I like that this comes out nice and thick.  Next time I'll put in the dillweed.

I'm sorry, but I don't know why people thought this was so good.  It was tasteless and watery.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was edible, but sadly I've had better chowder.  Will not make again.

Between all the clam juice (6 bottles) and the canned clams (5 cans) This became a pretty pricey chowder. Easy and delicious though. I added a few extra potatoes, a few cups of veggie broth and sharp cheddar cheese to the final product (sprinkled on each bowl) and fed 12 hungry adults and 5 kids under 5 with it. Home Made Sourdough bread topped it off.

THE WAY THE CLAMS WERE ADDED TO THIS RECIPE WAS A BIG DISSERVICE.....WHAT IS A QT. OF SHUCKED CLAMS TO MOST OF US? SO, I MADE THE CHOWDER EXACTLY AS WRITTEN HAVING HAD A LG. [49+ OUNCE] CAN OF CLAM BROTH IN MY PANTRY JUST WAITING FOR THAT LONG SOUGHT AFTER PERFECT NEW CREAMY NEW ENGLAND STYLE CLAM CHOWDER. AND I NOTICED MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN USE THE AMOUNT OF BROTH THE RECIPE ASKED FOR. THAT BROTH WAS WASTED DUE TO THE CLAM DESCRIPTION.....I GUESSED @ 2 CANS.....SHOULD HAVE USED MAYBE 4! ALSO, IT COULD HAVE USED MORE POTATOES, & MAYBE SOME SWEET RED PEPPER FOR A LITTLE PUNCH..... I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE SAVED THAT HUGE CAN OF BROTH FOR A BETTER RECIPE. SORRY BUT CAN'T SEE HOW THAT RECIPE WON AWARDS.....

I have been looking for a fabulous Clam Chowder recipe as my husband is a big fan and orders it whenever we go out to eat. I don't usually like clam chowder but this one was great. It was even better the next day! If you are making it for company, make it the day before. I only used 2 bottles of clam juice, substituting chicken broth for the others, I added celery and I used canned baby clams as suggested by others. This is a keeper. My husband loved it! I will be making it again.

I loved this clam chowder!  I had never made anything like this before (I am young!), but I did make my own little tweaks and will be doing so again.  I only used one large onion, which was plenty.  Also, next time I make it, I will probably use 3 bottles clam juice, 3 cans chicken broth, 3 cans baby clams and a couple extra potatoes.  Thicken it up a little.  It was really good as it is, though

Great recipe, got a lot of compliments, though, I think it may have feel short as I couldn't find clam juice and my clams were canned, not shucked.  I like this recipe because it delivers a great, uncomplicated taste and the only tangible complaint came from my health conscious wife about all the fat in the butter, half-and-half, etc.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I made several recommended changes to it to make it a 5 star recipe.  Used canned, minced clams, used half chicken broth and half clam juice and also added some bacon and celery.  It came out perfect.

Next time I'll add just a bit more flour\butter mixture to make it a bit thicker. I also added bacon and with the onion I added a finely chopped celery stick and carrot (for a little added color and flavor). I also substituted 2 jars of clam juice for a can for chicken broth so it wasn't too clammy for my husband. I made this for a get together with my side of the family and everyone loved it. Thanks!

This soup was AMAZING!  I took the advice of some of the other members - I used about 1 1/2 cup 2% and 1 1/2 Fat Free half and Half.  Also, I added celery.  Everyone RAVED.. and I was pretty impressed too!

Very good.  I made this for my husband because I don't like clam chowder, this recipe changed my mind.  I also added some bacon and the drippings.  Definately will make again.

Everyone raved.  I also added a little bacon drippings to the rue and some cooked chopped bacon to final result but not too much to over power or change the wonderful dill flavor.  Will make again and again!

This was an outstanding recipe! I added some cooked bacon and simmered much longer than recommended as I always feel like soup gets better the longer it simmers. I cooked the potatoes in chicken stock and found that I had to use a bit more flour than suggested to get the thickness I prefer in a chowder. I highly recommend this excellent chowder on a cold winter day.

I've had this recipe saved for a year and FINALLY made it. It's Yummy!  Just a hint, if you can't find a QUART of clams (as I couldn't), 2-10oz cans of baby clams did the trick just fine.  I added some water at the end because it IS a bit thicker than I prefer and I forgot the dill so I used a bit of basil. Next time, all I'd change is to maybe substitue some of the 1/2 and 1/2 with milk. Thanks for sharing!!

This is a SUPER CHOWDA!  It's the thick, rich and delicious kind you get in a decent deafood restaurant on the coast of Maine.  Yummy.  My husband is very critical of his beloved clam chowder and this got a "two thumbs up" rating!

THIS CHOWDER WAS GREAT!  I USED 4-8OZ BOTTLES OF CLAM JUICE AND 2C. CHICKEN BROTH AS SUGGESTED BY SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS.  I ADDED SOME CELERY TOO.  BE CAREFUL NOT TO COOK THE CLAMS TO MUCH, THEY GET CHEWY.  I HAD USED CLAMS FROM THE SEAFOOD DEPT. THAT WERE ALREADY CUT UP, SO THEY DIDNT NEED QUITE AS MUCH TIME TO COOK AS WHOLE CLAMS.  OVERALL GREAT.., WILL DEFINATLY MAKE IT AGAIN!!

My whole family raved about this chowder!  It has a wonderful flavor...I can see how it won chowder competitions!  Next time, tho, I'll make it a bit thicker as it was a little too soupy for me...but everyone loved it!  5 stars!!!

Not quite as thick, and add some bacon, and this could be from Newport's Black Pearl, which serves the world's best clam chowder.

Someone asks, What's with the dill?  If you use fresh dill, it's the taste!  I think dill and the light smoke taste are the secrets to great New England clam chowder.

yes!! I made this. just like home. It is missing the bacon and a good shaker of pepper when served. This is not your canned chowder, it's thinner but so much more flavor. dill is just garnish,but it's fine. EAT MORE CHOWDAH

Made as written and it was great. One of the best recipes. Made again but sautéed onions with 1/2 cup finely diced salt pork. Also used parsley instead of dill. OMG

I made it for a luncheon at our local legion. It was a hit! Everyone raved over it.  I did add a few more potatoes than what was called for.
I trippled the recipe which was enough to fill two large Crock-Pots.

If this won the Newport Chowder festival then it must be spectacular.  We lived in Newport for over 30 years and went to almost all the Yachting festival events.  Trust me - you don't have to make chowder with bacon.  This version helps make the world go 'round.

I’ve been making this chowder for a couple of years now.  When I’m in RI I can buy shucked chopped sea clams.  Makes a huge difference. Go a little heavy on clams a a little lighter on the potatoes.  Best chowder recipe there is.

As per directions, it was a bit less creamy or thick than I prefer...U think it needs some evaporated milk in place of some of the half and half.

AWESOME!!!!!!!!    However, I added more half and half to dilute the sodium intake. After making this chowder, I don't have the desire to try another recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times now and I honestly think this is the Best New England clam chowder I've ever had let alone made. I made it exact to recipe the first time and wowed the Family. 
The second time I made a couple of changes and if possible it came out better. I cooked the clams and potatoes together in the broth and removed the dill and substituted dried thyme, because the family felt the dill was too strong. Now it's perfect!

Super good Chowder! Keeping this as my #1 clam chowder recipe.  I used a couple jars of clam juice the first time I made this then all chicken broth the second time and I gotta say I kinda like all chicken broth! Other then that had to use canned clams and the broth they're packed in.   Still a super good recipe!

Is it possible that I hadn't reviewed this recipe before now?! I discovered it nearly 10 years ago, when I had a LOT of fresh clams left over after a 60th Birthday party! It has become a staple at our house, and I'm pretty sure that I can no longer get through the door at a family gathering without it!! Per 4 servings, I use 4 small cans of clams (2 chopped, 2 minced), a 27 oz can of clam juice (MUCH cheaper than the bottles!), and fat free 1/2 'n' 1/2.  Aside from not shucking clams, I don't add or change anything, and everyone swears it's the best they've had!!!

This was really good! The only change per reviews was I cooked a bit of bacon and added the butter to the fat before tossing in the onions. I assume the cooking time for the clams was for fresh....only canned available to me at the time...so I just heated up the liquid from the canned clams with added bottled clam juice before adding to flour mix. I did add a bit of Old Bay for a kick because we are in Texas and everything kicks. I threw the clams in just before serving and topped with green onions and bacon bits for those who wanted. Very nice addition for seafood night! Thank you, OMMIE3

My whole family loves this chowder recipe. I add a few stalks of chopped celery, 3 cloves finely chopped garlic, some Old Bay & parsley. I also throw in a few more potatoes & use seafood stock in place of clam juice since it is expensive. Thanks for the tips on adding clams at the end so they don't get chewy. Will try with some bacon next time.

I was looking for a recipe to make my own clam chowder more delicious.  I added a small amount of diced salt pork to the butter and onions.  I had already steamed some clams and reserved the broth.  I cooked my potatoes in the clam broth .  I mixed the butter mixture with the potatoes and broth, added clams and half and half.  I did not use the dill. It was the best clam chowder I have ever made!

It is easy to see why this recipe won an award. Rich and flavorful, it was great.  We added some celery and used green onions instead, we also added four crisp strips of bacon, crumbled. It turned out great!

We added some white wine and some crumbled bacon. It got rave reviews from native New Englanders. The clams that we bought fresh from the clammer when he pulled up beside our boat definitely helped. The recipe was still delicious, but not quite as good when I made a second batch with store bought clams.

My favorite clam chowder recipe. It's always a good standby and handy because it can be made ahead and reheated. I use the large can of chopped clams and juice from Costco and when I have them, I add minced razor clams and their juice. I usually just serve it with some nice bread for a simple meal.

This is the bomb.  Fantastic.  I added a twist, however, substituting spiny lobster (I doubled the called for clam ingredient for the lobster chopped into bite size pieces).  The base chowder itself was better than restaurant quality.  Very very good!

Wow, very easy recipe, followed the directions to the T and let me say, amazing, brings back the taste of home, as I am from RI. Thank you so much for posting this. Only thing is out here in PA, I would say cost a bit of money to make as the clam juice was $2.99 each for the 6 8 ounce jars of clam juice. I also didn't do this with fresh clams, I used 4 10 oz bumble bee fancy whole baby clams. Never the less, simply amazing, I will be making this again for sure!

Outstanding!!!! This was so easy to make came home from work and we were eating by 6:30 I chose to use 4 cans of clams and also added celery in when you add the clam and juice to onion mix. Family loved it and I think that it might be the best chowder since I was in New England!!!!! Try it you will love it!!!

Oh my gosh!  I have never made clam chowder before, and I've never had Newport style. My husband and I LOVED this recipe, and LOVED the thinner consistency. I didn't have any fresh clams so I just got the canned ones.  I used 6 6.5oz cans chopped clams in their own juice, and 6 8oz jars of clam juice. It was amazing! Everything else was per recipe instructions, except I didn't have any dill. I topped it with a pat of butter, a little salt and pepper, and some old bay as another reviewer recommended.

Fantastic recipe! Everyone raved about how great this soup came out - I followed the directions, but also doubled the potatoes to two pounds (I like the pieces cut a little smaller), and added some chopped bacon to the onion/flower mixture before mixing. I also went heavy on the dill, since we love dill. 

I went to college in Newport and haven't been able to find clam chowder that tastes so "Newporty" since! Thank you so much for sharing, will absolutley make again.

Hail the great OMMIE3!

But seriously bomb chowder recipe. I cant believe how much difference the clam juice makes over water (I sucked it up and forked over the additional 8 bucks). My changes were 3-4 stalks of celery and I added 2 extra cans of clams (7.5oz) and withdrew 2 (8oz) bottles of juice. Then I threw it in a lightly toasted sourdough bread bowl. Sooo soo good. I think I am going to get some friends and have a chowder bowl night. lol

excellent.  I added the dill with the onions, and probably double the amount.  I used canned clams, cooked the potatoes in some soup stock then added all of that, and didn't measure anything.  It didn't need the flour, actually.  I found it thick enough without it.

About as close as I can get to San Francisco (I know it's not New England but...) clam chowder at home in the desert.

My go-to recipe! I add a dash of red-wine vinegar, and sometimes salt-pork, or liquid smoke. Pretty versatile. Yum yum, thanks!

Having grown up in New England, I've tried a lot of chowders.  This recipe is excellent! I crisped up 3 slices of chopped bacon and cooked the onion in the bacon fat instead.  I added the cooked bacon back into the chowder at the end.  Don't skip the fresh dill weed, it totally makes the dish!

Good basic recipe. I made it all in one pot by doing butter and onions first till translucent, adding the potatoes and clam juice next till potatoes were cooked through, then the rest later. I also used rice flour (just mix it in before the cream, no need to separate like flour) to make it a gluten free dish and it turned out well.

This is an excellent dish. I didn't put as much clam juice in and I also added corn. It turned out wonderfully.

This recipe is to die for!  Great consistency!  As some reviewers suggested, I added 2 stalks of celery (diced) and 5 pieces of cooked bacon torn into bits.  The dill weed was a great surprise and really made it yummy.

Where do I start with this one?? This as a very expensive lesson & dissapointment. Made as written and it was tasteless!! I then added bacon & celery but by then it was too late. I tripled the recipe, figured this cost me about $30++ to make! I cant understand the rave reviews! We actually had to go buy canned chowder at the last minute and mix it with this just to serve. Sorry, will not make again.

When I make clam chowder, it is a REAL treat. I usually use heavy whipping cream instead of the half n half. It gives it a really creamy texture, and more of that whiter color, not yellowish. BUT since I am cutting back on calories, and fat, I used the half and half and it tasted very good. I did use some bacon for extra flavor and some chicken stock. It was really good. Dont forgte the dill. I had dried and it adds such a unique flavor.It made a lot for me and my boyfriend. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this last night and it was delicious! Added 1 tablespoon fresh tyme and rosemary and 1 cup of both carrots and celery. Per other reviews substituted some chicken stock for clam juice and used fat free half and half to cut back on the calories and fat.

This was good after tweaking, but I found it to be very bland in its original recipe, and I don't even like spicy food. It just seemed to lack flavor, but that's probably because I used only 3 jars of clam juice and I used 5 cans of clams rather than fresh.  I also added a stalk of celery and lots of spices at the end, plus closer to 2 pounds of potatoes.  Even after adding vegetable bullion, extra dill, Old Bay, paprika, salt and  pepper, and even cayenne pepper, it was still rather bland and a little thinner than what I'd hoped. I think I probably should have used the entire 6 bottles of clam juice and not tried to substitute with chicken broth.  Anyway, it's good. I just wasn't wowed by it.

Revised:  After sitting int he fridge overnight and then eating it again the next day, it was absolutely delicious!  The consistency was perfect (not too thick, not toot thin) and the flavors really blended together well.  I'd give it 5 stars now, but I'd definitely say to make it a day ahead and serve it the next day, for best results.

I made this yesterday morning and when it cooled put it in the fridge till supper time. OK, I bought 4 bottles of clam juice and one broke so I used 3. I used 5 cans of minced clam's & 1 large can of whole clams with the juice & I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2. Everything else I did according to the original recipe. It was my first time making a clam chowder and wanted something to thrill my hubby with who is from Maine. This did it. He was amazed and said it was the best clam chowder he had ever had. I loved it! I think the clam juice bottle that broke was a blessing in disguise! ****UPDATE****09/09/14*** I only make this once a year if that, as it is rich. NO fresh clams in my area and canned works fine. Last night I used 4 large cans of clams with juice and 5 bottles of clam juice and it was fine. You can't have too many clams in my opinion so I'll more than likely add 1 more can next time. I have never made it with bacon in it and do not plan to. I do let it simmer on the stove for a good bit longer than the recipe says to. If you are searching for the best clam chowder recipe, well, you have just found it. Oh, one more note just for fun....I call this my lay away chowder. As it is rather costly to make I will buy a can of clams or a bottle of clam juice on different trips to the store over a period of time so I don't get stuck with the "sticker shock" of buying everything needed at one time.

My husband loves clam chowder, so I decided to try this recipe as a special treat for him.  At first he was a little hesitant about the dill, but after having this soup a dozen times over the past couple of years, he is a true believer.  This is one of the best clam chowders I have tasted and everyone who tastes it loves it.

This was my first time making clam chowder and I was impressed.  I prefer the chowder to be just a little thicker, so next time I will put a can of cream of potato soup in there.  I also added about a half cup of shredded carrots, and I used 4 jars of clam juice and one can of chicken broth, plus two cans of baby clams, undrained.  Over all, the flavor was wonderful (even better the next day).  I will absolutely make this again.  Thanks!

Sometimes the simplest things are the best!   Clams are my favorite so of course clam chowder is awesome. This is more of a runny, soupy clam chowder, nothing like other recipes I've tried which are thicker. I would definitely make this again, but maybe add some carrots or celery to change it up and try new things. But with just potatoes, clams and onions, it's awesome as is too.

Wow! This was so good!  I only made a couple of changes.  First of all I used 2 cups of fat free half and half and 1 cup of regular.  Next time I will use all fat free.  You really could't tell the difference.  I use fresh razor clams, 2 bottles of clam juice and 2 cans of minced clams.  I used the liquid from the juice and minced clams to cook the fresh clams and the diced potatoes.  I also mixed the butter and flour as directed but then added some of the half and half before mixing it with the broth.  Next time the only additional change I will make is to cut the potatoes a bit bigger and some of the razor clams a bit bigger too.

New England maybe... Newport, no... Guessing I expect a Newport clam chowder to be much more thin... had to edit recipe exponentially to get near a true Newport chowder. 3 stars because its still a good chowder, just not as titled.

This is thee best clam chowder on this site.  However, I recommend not substituting fresh clams for cans (including juice).  I used cans and we couldn't even taste the clam flavor. Definitely will use fresh clams next time.  It has the right texture and consistency. Superb.

I wasn't too sold on this after sampling it right away after I made it, but when we ate it the next day it was fantastic.  I would definitely recommend letting it sit overnight, as the flavors really seemed to come together nicely after doing so.  There is a local restaurant that my family has always said has the best clam chowder, but we all agreed this one surpassed it.  A nice, easy recipe.

This is THE BEST clam chowder I've ever had.  I've made it for Christmas Eve dinner the past two years, and everyone loves it!    I triple or even quadruple the amount of dill, I just keep adding until I feel it has enough, such a unique flavor for this chowder.  I also use 3 6.5oz cans minced clams instead of fresh, and it's great!

Great recipe. I doubled this recipe and make a few changes. I did half butter and half bacon for the fat, nad I used canned chopped clams(2x 51oz) undrained for the clams and clam juice. I also used canned cooked potatoes, drained. Just a few changes to make it go easier/faster. It turned out fantastic!

Fed it to a roomful of rugged Alaskan men and got lots of grunts of approval!  I used 2 cans of clams and 1.5 pounds of fresh.

This came out great and everyone loved it.  One thing that I did, was cut the clams down a bit and put in some Shrimp & Scallops, it was a big hit.

So, I cant give this recipe a true review because I didnt follow it exactly. I read the directions and the ingrediants and just kinda did my own thing in the kitchen. I doubled the batch (we love chowder so I wanted a bunch of leftovers). I used 1 jar of clam juice (could have used more), 3 cans of minced clams (juice included) and 1.5lbs fresh clams I found at the grocery store. I also used fat free half and half as well as skim milk and chicken broth (equal parts). Oh, i chopped up some salt pork and cut the onions in half (based on other reviews). I used dried dill and dried thyme. Overall it came out pretty good. Not as thick as we would have liked but good none the less. Served with crusty french bread and oyster crackers. Will def make another chowder attempt. :D

This was my first attempt at clam chowder. Based on the rating and review, I took a gamble on this one.  Tripled the recipe for our weekly neighborhood get-together, and followed the suggestions of others, by adding 4 celery stalks to the butter/onion roux.  I also used 3 tsp old bay seasoning, 6 cans whole baby clams, 3 bottles clam juice,15 cups of chicken stock, 9 cups half-n-half and 8 pounds of potatoes. This recipe was pretty easy to prepare and cooked up thick and hearty. The taste is rich and delicious and I love the addition of the dill.  This chowder was an absolute hit and deserves its 5 star rating!!

This was my first attempt at making Clam Chowder and I wish all my first attempts in life turned out this good! 
I did make a few minor adjustments according to personal tastes and what I had on hand.
Instead of using canned clams and bottled clam juice, all I had was leftover steamed clams and the water they were cooked in. I chopped up the clams as small as I dared but there still wasn't half as much as the recipe calls for. Oh well, next time. The clam water saved the day as an excellent stock; yes!
Also, I added celery to the onions and used dried thyme and bay leaves instead of dill weed.
If tonight the chowder tastes this so amazing, I can't wait to eat it again tomorrow!

This chowder was the very best I have ever made.  I did add a little paprika and cayenne pepper which gave it a little kick.  I made this for a chowder party and everyone raved about it. It was a little expensive to make for 16 people using fresh clams, however, it was will worth it.

This is the BEST clam chowder! It has become the new tradition for Christmas Eve Dinner (3 yrs and running). We serve it in bread bowls and with a Caesar Salad. We always serve another soup as well, usually the Baked Potato Soup V (by Tammy)which is excellent! on this site.  The second pot of soup can be interchanged but not this one. My family says this is a must.  Thanks Dee!

Best chowder recipe I've tried. Most of them you read are "dump it in a pot and cook it" type recipes, but this one starts with a roux of butter and flour and onions basically and creates a naturally thick soup, really nice. I used some salt pork when I cooked the onions, and I used a 4-cup box of seafood broth + 1 bottle of clam liquor, kept everything else as-is.

Very rich and creamy.  I added whole milk instead of half and half cream to reduce fat content.  Also added some frozen corn.  Turned out wonderful, like the clam chowder I had in San Francisco.

Everyone loved it!  I substituted equal parts half-and-half and milk which worked well for my family.  I added 1/2 pound of browned and crumbled bacon and used canned clams with their liquid instead of the shucked clams.  That much clam juice is really expensive, so I now use "Better than Bullion Clam Stock" which works equally well.

This had a great flavor without changing a thing except using minced clams so the kids could eat it. I do like thick clam chowders so I probably would not make this again without finding a way to make it more New england style, but newport clam chowder is supposed to be thin so I cant rate it poorly on that. My 7 year and 19 month old both ate two bowls a piece! I served with slightly toasted french bread and it was yummy.

THIS WAS THE BEST CHOWDER I HAVE EVER MADE. I MADE A COUPLE OF SUBSTITUTIONS, ADDED SOME CELERY, CHANGED THE DILL TO PARSLEY.. AND MY FAMILY IS GOING TO USE THE RECIPE FOR OUR RESTARAUNT. I WAS PERFECT THANKS! :)

Awesome chowder and quite easy to make.  I added 3 strips of chopped bacon and used 3 bottles of clam juice and 3 cups of chicken broth.  I also used 3 cans of chopped clams.  Next time i would add celery, but it's great either way

I followed this recipe exactly except for using canned clams in place of fresh.  The chowder came out with a perfect consistency and was super tastey!  Fresh clams would make it even better I'm sure.

I was very pleased with this recipe.  My husband and son both enjoyed it.  Very good for a recipe without the added flavor of bacon.

Good flavor, but too thin.  I like my chowder much thicker.  Will make again with changes.

Absolutely the best clam chowder I've ever tasted.  Unbelievable, the whole family loved it.  I'll definately have to laminate this one and put it in heavy rotation from now on.  If your like me, from the East living in the West, and you can't seem to find chowder like they make back home give this one a shot. Follow the recipe to the T and you won't be disapointed, guaranteed.

I can see how this recipe won!  It was soooooo tasty.  This is one of my seven year old daughter's favorite dinners.  It gets requested quite a bit!  Definitely the best, better than what you get in a can!

I substituted some chicken broth for clam broth (alot cheaper), and evaporated milk for cream (alot healthier AND cheaper).  Delicious!

Great recipe.  I used the foil pouched whole baby clams you can buy now instead of shucking raw ones, and it worked great. Great flavor.

Very good recipe.  I used half the amount of clam juice and canned clams and it came out delicious.

One of my all-time favorite soups. Serve it with some crusty San Francisco sourdough straight out of the oven, and life does not get much better. Thanks for the great recipe!
