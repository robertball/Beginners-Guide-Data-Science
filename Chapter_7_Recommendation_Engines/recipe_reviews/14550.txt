These were great at a family barbeque! I used potatoes, onions and corn and everyone was satisfied.  Simple recipe, easy to prep and oh, so tasty!  Be sure you have the extra big foil on hand or else wrap them in several smaller pouches.

Although the concept is great, found that the frozen corn came out soggy once it finally cooked...top of grill was taking way too long.  Think it works best without ice cub if veggies are fozen, but think fresh corn would be great.  Thanks for sharing.

My non-veggie eating crew loved this.  I seasoned the veggies with other flavors of Mrs. Dash along with the onion and omitted the ice.  I have also done this recipe with all kinds of frozen veggies.  Comes out perfect every time!!  THANKS!

So good!  I would recommend just going ahead and using fresh corn on the cob.  That's what I did, and I also used sugar snap peas for the snow peas just for preference.  These took about 30 minutes and we had nice crunchy perfectly cooked corn!  Thanks!!

Easy to make and tasty! I would add some sort of seasoning salt.
