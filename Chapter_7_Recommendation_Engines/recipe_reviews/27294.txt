Only got the recipe 2 weeks ago and have made them 3 times!  The first time was apricots and white chocolate chips.  Instead of boiling water, I microwaved the apricots in orange juice.  Second time was with dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  Again, I softened them in orange juice.  Last time I made them with bananas and walnuts.  Each time I had to bake them for 20 minutes, not 15, but that may have been because of the added ingredients.  This is a great recipe as a muffin base and you can add anything you want!!

These are absolutely delicious! I noticed that some reviewers used a substitute for buttermilk, all I can say to that is....DON"T! While I'm sure their muffins still turned out fine, it is the buttermilk that really makes this recipe. It adds a creaminess to the muffin that is just divine. I really liked the apricot, but next time I will try blueberries.

I had been itchin' to make muffins for a few weeks now, and my mom sent me this recipe. I was a little worried because I don't like cakey muffins, I like them much more dense. Well, I added some dried cranberries in place of half of the apricots, and also added about 1/2 cup of walnuts. THEY TURNED OUT SO DELICIOUS! Perfect consistancy. I should note that I totally forgot to add the 1 egg, but I wonder if thats why they were the dense consistancy I liked. Still good minus the egg and less fat! I'll continue to do sans egg.

Yum.  My family are muffin connoseurs and these definately passed the test.  I made them with chopped dates added into the mixture and wondered if they would go well together, but they were great.  Nice texture and great taste.  A Keeper for sure!!

These were gorgeous muffins.  They're rich, mildly sweet and delightfully apricot flavored. The combination of butter, vegetable oil and buttermilk drew me in as I knew I could expect those buttery rich, moist results.  I felt no need to add any spice and I'm glad I couldn't be tempted by other reviews to do so.  I wanted an apricot muffin, not a spice muffin, and that's exactly what I got with these.  The ingredients, directions and cooking time were all spot on.  I did have a little extra batter leftover, but muffin tins do vary in size.  I meant to top these with demerara sugar (turbinado sugar, sugar in the raw) before baking but forgot. Once they came out of the oven and I tasted them, however, I found it didn't matter a bit.  Hubs will be taking these to a breakfast meeting tomorrow and I have no qualms about that at all with these.  Nice recipe.

This is a fantastic Recipe! Great texture, very moist and flavorful. I did not have buttermilk,so I added 3 Tbs. Lime Juice to one cup 2%Organic Milk. It worked out great to thicken the milk and even added a nice hint of Lime to the taste of the muffin. I also added about  1/2 cup of finely chopped fresh Almonds to the flour mixture, might use 3/4 cup next time for added flavor. 
This recipe is a keeper!

I really enjoyed these muffins.  In fact, I use this muffin batter as my muffin batter for every muffin that I make now.  I love how tender the muffins are!

Very yummy muffins.  I used canned apricots and they turned out perfectly moist.  I love the texture of these muffins and the cake part is very tasty...just the right sweetness.

I had some leftover buttermilk and I didn't really know what to do with it. So I decided to do a search for recipes that had buttermilk. I was a bit sceptical about this recipe inspite of the good reviews, since I'm not a big fan of apricots.

But these turned out wonderfully soft and moist, and extremly tasty. Of course, I did a little bit of tweaking. I added a handful of raisins to soak along with the apricots. I also added a handful of shredded coconut and about 1/2 cup of orange juice.

I made about 6 muffins (17 minutes) and baked the rest in a loaf pan (35 minutes).

My husband loved it. And to my surprise, so did I! I guess I'll be making it again :)

I love these muffins.  I have tried many, many types of muffins over the last several weeks and these are my favorites.  I keep making them again and again and even my kids love them!  I don't usually keep buttermilk on hand so I use regular milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice added to it and it turns out just great.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I loved this!  I am not generally a home baker but my daughter was after me to make muffins and I only had apricots in the cupboard. Anyway, I only tried it a couple of weeks ago and I've made them three times.  The first two times I didn't have buttermilk so used regular milk and they were still so yummy.  Today I made them with buttermilk and instead of apricots used cranberries and white chocolate.  Oh my gosh - to die for! I highly recommend!

I used vegan butter, rice milk, organic evaporated cane sugar and non sulfured dried apricots in this recipe and baked them in a cast iron muffin pan.  They were perfect.  Without question the best homemade muffin recipe I've tried. I may be biased since I like tart muffins like cranberry and my favorite syrup is apricot.

I made these with fresh apricot instead of dried so maybe that was the problem, but I didn't think these had much flavor.  No one in my family really liked them at all.  Maybe some spices would help but I don't think I will try it again, sorry.

These muffins are DELICIOUS. I made the first batch just as is and they were perfect. I made a second batch with the following modifications, for those of us looking to add some fibre and iron to our lives: Reduced white flour to 1c and added 1c whole wheat flour, 1/4c wheat germ, 1/4c bran and 1/2c walnuts. Still DELICIOUS, with just a slightly nuttier flavour. And so good for you. Thanks for posting!!!

I really like these muffins.  They are light and have a wonderful buttery taste. I didn't want to tweek or add anything.  I like the simple nature of them and the clean flavors.  I found that they didn't the whole 15 minutes baking time, so I watched until they were done.

This is the best muffin recipe ever!  Very moist and deliscious.  My family and office loved it!  Followed recipe exactly. This is the standard recipe from now on, with substitutions of other fruit.  Buttermilk makes all the difference!

I also added a half a cup of chopped walnuts to these muffins.  Muffin cups weren't needed, because they didn't stick- they just fell out of the pan!  They need lots of apricots to taste good.

I must admit, I did tweak the recipe by using 1/2 unbleached and 1/2 stone-ground whole wheat flour ('cause I can't leave well enough alone), and I also added 1 tsp ground ginger (since apricot and ginger go well together, IMHO), but these came out GREAT.  I was tempted to cut back on the sugar as well, since I find most muffin recipes are too sweet for my taste, but the sugar here was spot on. I plan on making this recipe as written, and also flavoring it with a little orange zest instead of ground ginger in the future.  I love it when a great recipe can stand alone but also take well to adaptations. This one's a keeper!

5 stars! Delicious and perfectly moist! I followed the recipe exactly not making any alterations or adjustments. I used Mariani mediterranean apricots. It took exactly 5 minutes to reconstitute them in boiling water. The batter was easy to put together and I had no lumps. I ended up with 18 muffins, all baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.  I could actually smell the buttermilk and apricots baking and filling my house with this aroma. Once they were done, I took them out and let them rest a few minutes before tasting one. They turned out lovely with little specks of chopped apricots show casing throughout the muffins. The muffin tops were nicely rounded and were a nice golden color. The muffins itself were moist and fluffy. The apricots were delicately sweet and added a nice texture. The ingredients, directions, baking time and results were perfect. I think next time I might add more apricots. I can't think of a better way than to start off my morning with a good source of potassium, antioxidants and fiber!

I made these with some small variations: I used 1/2 a cup brown sugar and 1/4 white, because brown has more flavour. I also used a mix of dried fruits (apricots, dates, craisins, pears and prunes) because I didn't have enough apricots. They turned out delicious! Very moist. 

One minor complaint: I find them just a teensy bit lacking in flavour. Next time I'll use more apricots/dried fruit and throw in some cinnamon to give them a boost. Still, a very good recipe that I'll make again!

This recipe was pretty successful.  It was popular at my work -- they said it was subtly sweet, but not as sweet as a dessert -- kind of like a good breakfast muffin.  P.S. I made mini-muffins, which are easy to grab and stick in your mouth without being really messy.

My first thought as I was making these muffins was that there was WAY too much fat, but I followed the recipe exactly anyway. There was definitely too much batter for 12 muffins; this easily makes 18 muffins, filling each cup the standard 3/4 full. Maybe I have smaller muffin cups in my pans. Despite my concerns, the muffins are very good. The next time I make these I will try reducing the fat to 1/4 cup melted butter or margarine.

It seemed a waste to drain all this flavorful apricot liquid into the sink, so I added some sugar, cornstarch, and a tiny splash of almond extract, simmered it, and reduced it down into a fresh jam to serve with the muffins - a perfect complement!

As for the recipe itself, I agree with another reviewer - these make closer to 18 than 12 standard muffins.  I added some vanilla, substituted milk+vinegar for buttermilk, and topped them with demerara sugar before baking.  I also used California apricots (the darker, larger halves, as opposed to the small whole dried Mediterranean apricots).

These muffins have a moist richness due to the mixture of buttermilk, oil, and butter (butter for flavor, oil for moisture, and buttermilk for tenderness) and are a wonderful base for anything you want to add. Definitely use real buttermilk if you can-it always produces delicious results in baked goods -and it is needed in this recipe because the acid in it activates the baking soda (though a good substitute for one cup of buttermilk is 3/4 cup whole milk or low-fat yogurt and 1/4 cup of milk stirred together well). Do make sure to not overwork the dough, stirring until just combined as the recipe directs-this is so important to the texture of these muffins. I found that the apricots needed to be chopped pretty small because they expand quite a bit when soaked in the hot water. A little vanilla is a good addition. I may try these sometime with some apples and nutmeg mixed in. Thanks for such a delightful recipe!

I bought a large bag of apricots at Costco, then wasn't sure where to go with them - so -found this delicious recipe for muffins -- so easy and delicious.  The apricots I bought were not dried at all, very moist, so I did not rehydrate them - and they were perfect.  I, too will use this basic recipe for other fruits --

Turned out great! Only thing I did different is I added was sliced almonds to the batter and a sprinkle of them on top.

Oh these muffins are just delightful.  I followed the recipe exactly, did not change a thing.  The muffins have a cornbread texture to them, which I really enjoyed.  Gentle flavor nothing overpowering, I did wonder what they would be liked in the apricots were soaked in a little apricot brandy.  I think I will give that a try next time around!

I love this recipe. The muffins were light and fluffy and still moist. I would definitely use the recipe as a base for other muffins as well. Not too sweet.

The muffins turned out fabulous....light and fluffy, very delicious! I added a half cup of slivered almonds. I microwaved the apricots for a minute in orange juice and a splash of amaretto and let them soak for 5 mins. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. The recipe made 9 large muffins.

These went over big with the adults in the house, but my son and the neighbors kids didn't like them at all.  I added some chopped dates to the mixture.  Was very good and very easy to make.

These are delicious as listed.  To make them a little healthier the next time I made them, I substituted applesauce for oil, added 1/2 tsp imitation vanilla extract (1/4 tsp real), and added 2 Tbsp flaxseed meal. Needed to add a little bit more butter milk so it would stir. Next time, I'm going to replace some of the flour with flaxseed meal, instead of adding.  These were also delicious.

These were delicious!  I loved the light fluffy texture, the flavor and the moist nuggets of apricot.  I even froze them and they were wonderful when thawed.  I'll add this to my favorite muffin recipes.  A keeper!

Nice muffins.  They are pretty plain, cakelike muffins, so unless you want to add other spices that's what you'll end up with.  I did add some vanilla, which was a good complement.  I pulled out and chopped what I thought were apricots from the freezer; nope, they were peaches.  Oh, well, they still make a nice light muffin.   Obviously I skipped the step of plumping them up in hot water since they weren't dried.  Thanks for the recipe!

Muffins surely make more than 12; I estimate it more like 15+, depending on where you fill the cups to. I baked the last of the batter in a Pyrex cup to make a little cake! Yuuummmm

Wonderful!  So delicious!  I made a few changes:  I used margarine instead of butter.  I used half sugar, half truvia.  I also used half white flour and half wheat flour.  My fiance is big into working out, so I also added 2 scoops of protein powder.  The taste was wonderful!

I loved the consistency of these muffins.  This will be my new base recipe.  I used regular milk and they were still good but I will definitely try them with buttermilk next time.  I used freeze dried apricots, reconstituted.

I have tried many muffin recipes lately and have always messed up something - too dry - too sweet etc... but this was perfect! I actually made them with wholemeal flour so they are a bit healthier, reduced the sugar a little and added honey instead to the butter/milk mixture. I also used fresh apricots chopped which gave them a slight tang which I like and also a little more moisture. Finally I added linseeds and pumpkin seeds to the flour for omega 3 and good oils - I will eat them for breakfast as a healthy and tasty start to the day :)

These would have been great if I followed the recipe exactly.  I had about a 1/2 pint of blueberries to use up and I also toasted about a 1/2 cup of pecans to add to the muffins.  Also just because I had it in my hand I added a teaspoon of vanilla to them. These are some of the best muffins I've ever had.  I used muffin liners and sprayed those also...they won't stick to the liners and leave half the muffin behind. :) They also took about 22mins to bake.  Everyone's oven is different.  I never bake things as directed.  I go under and add time if I have to.  This way you can never mess up!!!

I soaked apricots in 1/2 c fresh orange juice & 1/2 c water-boiling. Added some vanilla also to that mixture. Used powdered buttermilk mixture. Added 1 to 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/2 c chopped walnuts. Had to bake 20 minutes. I would make again. Like that you can substitute ingredients in this.

Excellent with some changes (of course).  I had a lot of ripe apricots, so I chopped them and cooked them down with some sugar then added that to the batter instead of the dried apricots.  I added nutmeg to the dry ingredients and also added a streusel topping to give them some crunch.  I also substituted 3/4 soy milk for the buttermilk since I didn't have any buttermilk.  Oh and they took about 19 minutes to cook.  They turned out delicious and made 12 perfect plump muffins.

My wife raved over these, I though they were good; I added a teaspoon of vanilla and had to bake them 20 minutes; the batter seemed really thin but they baked up fine with a cake-like texture. As another reviewer stated, these make more than 12 when baked in a standard-sized muffin pan. I still feel like they "need" a little something extra (maybe it's that orange juice another reviewer is talking about or some white chocolate chips). Buttermilk makes the best pancakes and cornbread at our house and now we can add muffins to the list.

This is GREAT muffin batter!  I am a quick bread addict, and make it usually once a week at least in various incarnations, and this will be my new base batter for many types of breads.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of subbing in applesauce for fat, and I made it in a loaf pan instead of muffins and baked for about an hour.  The texture of this bread is fantastic.  Light, fluffy and moist.  Really great.

This recipe came out slightly dry, but otherwise very good. I think next time I'll add a little more oil.

I substituted a jar of apricot baby food in place of the oil for a bit more flavor. The kids loved them. Even the pickier teenagers grabbed two!! Not too sweet.

I used all oil instead of the melted butter which made it quite moist.  I also added chocolate chips and raisins to my muffins.

I made this yesterday and kept the recipe exactly the same except used 1/2 of a 14oz can of apricots, drained them well and cut in smaller pieces (they came cut in half). I gently mixed them in to the batter at the end and then added the crumb topping from the blueberry buttermilk coffee cake ( 3/4 sugar and 3/4 flour and 6 tsp of butter mixed to crumble consistency) and put plenty on top. I used a tin for 6 large muffins and baked for 25 minutes in my oven, but need to check often.  They came out great, loved the little moist pieces of apricot with the texture of the crunchy crumb topping.

Delicious recipie, did not change a thing other than I added 1 tsp. Of baking powder by accident, as it goes in most other muffin recipies.  They were delicious, make sure you use buttermilk as recommended.  If you take them out after 15 minutes, they will be raw inside.  I actually had to bake mine for an extra 8 minutes.  15 min. Is not enough.

I added dates, as well, but what really made the muffin was diced candied ginger - that added the flavor that others said may have been missing because of the lack of spices.

I made this recipe using 1 cup chopped fresh apricots instead of dried apricots soaked in boiling water.  Everything else was the same. The muffins turned out perfectly.

I doubled ingredients to make 24 muffins for our church group - ended up with 36!  baked in convection oven for 18 minutes, dusted top of each muffin with cinnamon sugar before baking (I'm a cinnamon freak). YUMMY

My daughters loved these, I liked them. I used half oat flour and half  all purpose flour (which I always do when I make muffins), and added a tsp. of vanilla. They were very moist,  and this is an easily customizable recipe. I may try soaking the apricots in orange juice, like another reviewer suggested, next time. I make muffins frequently , and this recipe is  a keeper.

These were not only gorgeous but delicious!! One thing that I noticed though was at the 400 degree temperature, I found that they were done at not 30 minutes but 23 minutes exactly. The fork came out clean and they were golden brown. Thanks so much for this!

I made this with a friend and we LOVED them! They were gone in a matter of minutes. The muffin itself was the perfect texture, they came out a little dry but not noticeably to someone who doesn't cook often. Also the apricots kind of overpower the muffin itself, I suggest using a few less apricots if this is an issue, but they were still amazing regardless.

Favorite muffin recipe!  I make it exactly as outlined and have made the muffins with bananas and almonds, mixed dried fruits such as pineapple, peaches, dates, and of course, aprictos, nuts and chocolate - you name it, I've put them in these muffins.  I hightly recommend!  They are a huge hit in my house and I pack them in my hubby's lunch box for a breakfast treat.

Well, played a bit of "mad scientist" with the recipe using ingredients I had on hand...My mom gave me a bag of dried cherries, so used that instead.  No buttermilk, so used milk and about a Tb of sour cream (cut back on oil about a Tb).  The cherries were very tart after soaking and I did not chop them, I added about a Tb of honey to wet in addition to sugar.  I also added about 9/10 of a the remaining bag of chocolate chips on hand.  They are delicious and in the future I will increase cherries to 1 1/2 cup!

I enjoy making jumbo muffins and this recipe did not work that great for it. I found them "cake-like". I was expecting them to be more moist. This recipe made 6 jumbo muffins.

These were good. A great snack and not too sweet. I might reduce the amounts next time though as like another reviewer I got 18 out of this. Thanks
