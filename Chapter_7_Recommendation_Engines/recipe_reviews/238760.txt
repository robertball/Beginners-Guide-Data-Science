This was fantastic.  My store did not have swiss chard so I used fresh baby spinach in place of this and it was great.  The little parmesan crisps were a nice added touch!

I just made this soup ... Stovetop tho because I needed it prepared quicker. I saut√©ed all veggies first in olive oil then added remaining ingredients. It was amazing even the picky eaters loved it. Definitely could use just one more veggie broth container. So next time I will add double broth. Btw I made this with all organic ingredients. The nutrition in this meal is increased when we don't use pesticide covered veggies :)

I made this on the stove, not a slow cooker. I used kale instead of swiss chard. I also added more broth, as there wasn't enough to cook the pasta and still have broth left over for the soup. It was very good.

This was so good! It's so satisfying when you make something and the finished product is seasoned perfectly, you don't even need to add salt or anything. I thought the artichokes really made this. They add a subtle but super effective tangy-ness and i wouldn't make this without them. I also actually really liked the texture that the beans added. Everything in it was perfect. I cooked this on the stove by sauteeing everything in olive oil and then adding the broth. Brought it to a light boil and then let simmer on low for about 40 minutes. Then for the last 2 minutes I brought it back to a boil and added a 9oz pack of tri-colored torellinis from Aldis. The only ingredients I tweaked were I didn't have celery or chard. I added chopped carrots, chopped zucchini and spinach instead. The spinach I added right before serving. I also added about 2 tsp of dried basil and a dash of thyme. For broth i used 2 1/2 cubes of Knorrs vegetarian bouillon in 4 cups of water. At first when i was boiling the tortellinis i didn't think there was going to be enough broth but I'm glad I trusted it because it was the perfect amount. I could eat this for the rest of my life if it were socially acceptable!

Loved this one, as did the rest of the family! I didn't add the artichoke because my husband is not a fan and I used fresh chopped spinach instead of Swiss chard because that's what I had on hand. (Added it just before serving because I prefer it just wilted not cooked.) Also added about a tablespoon of fresh basil just because everything taste better with fresh basil. :-)

I subbed spinach for the Swiss chard, it's what I had on hand. I'm not a fan of artichokes. I really didn't care for the beans and tortellini together. I did like the parmesan crisps - very tasty and easy. The slow cooker liners make clean up a breeze.

I think the soup was pretty good and has potential, but it seemed like something was missing. We are normally not picky eaters but this soup didn't stand out.  We used 1/2 chard and 1/2 kale. I preferred the kale to the chard and would just use that next time. The texture of the beans and tortellini together was a little odd. I normally like artichokes, but it seems like the flavor was lost in the soup. Overall, we're not really excited about eating the leftovers, but I might try to add a cream base or small meatballs to see if that helps. I'm interested to see what other people try with this recipe.

This recipe turned out really good. It was light and perfect for a cold evening dinner. I had this with some garlic bread and it was a great meal. I substituted kale for the chard as I am more partial to kale. Definitely add two to four cups more broth or less pasta. With the amount suggested there is not enough brith to cover the pasta when finishing the recipe.

I wasn't a fan of this one.  I left out the artichoke hearts and used spinach and cheese tortellini. I will not make this one again.

This is a tasty, easy to make soup! I made it exact with a little more garlic and it cooked so easy. The ingredients all worked really well together. Artichoke hearts in soup is a new twist for me and I'm happy I tried this recipe. Clean up was a breeze with the Reynolds slow cooker liners, won't slow cook without them anymore. We love, love, love Parmesan crisps now!
