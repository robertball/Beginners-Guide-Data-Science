Delectable!  Light, flavorful, we loved it.  Seemed like more marinade was needed - I had to keep stirring the carrots around while they were marinating because they weren't "submersed" enough.  Next time I will double the amount of marinade.

These were really tasty. I didn't have a grill to finish these in so I stir fried them in the marinade on the stove top. Delicious.

It was a bit too salty for my taste, next time I'll try to reduce the soy sauce and add a bit of sugar...

I was a little worried about this one as other reviewers suggested the sour flavor was unpleasant, but we just loved the kick it gave this, and the flavor was amazing.  I should note that I left out the five spice powder (not a fan of it). I chose not to grill, as I just couldn't see that working. I followed the recipe up to that point, keeping the carrots in the saucepan and letting them marinate, then turned them to low heat and simmered for about 20 minutes.

I changed absolutely nothing, except I cooked them on my indoor electric grill. A lot of people reviewed that these are salty... be sure to use low-sodium soy sauce. The rice vinegar gave them a nice zip that could easily be mistaken for saltiness too. Really good!

There wasn't enough of the marinade, and it was a tad salty to me. I did eat it, but I don't know if I will make it again.

This was a nice way to have Asian flared veggies to go with 'Asian Lettuce Wraps' and 'Fried Rice w/Ginger, Hoisin, and Sesame' both AR recipes.  I cooked the carrots on the stovetop rather than the grill as it was snowing out when I made them.  Stovetop method worked great.

These were delicious! There wasn't enough liquid in the marinade to even come close to covering the carrots, so I doubled the soy sauce and vinegar. (Most of the liquid gets discarded in the end anyway.) I also cooked them on the oven using the broil setting. I will definitely be making these again!

They were a bit salty. I also didn't have any sesame oil, so I substituted sesame seeds and a bit of olive oil. I think the sesame oil would have made the flavor a little better, but they were still good. Also, I didn't have a grill available, so I broiled them on a foil lined baking sheet for 10 minutes or so, and they were tasty!

LOVE the ingredient choices, not so hot on the outdoor grill idea. For normal folk like me, just tossing it on a small cookie sheet the oven for 20 min or so did the trick just fine.

My husband and I liked these. I subbed crossover spice blend (Lynne Rossetto Kasper) for the five spice powder and used powdered ginger. I also used baby carrots and did not parboil them first.

I followed the instructions exactly except for grilling and the carrots were too hard based on the instructions.  I added water to the marinade in the pan I tried to sautÃ© the carrots on a low heat tobtry and soften the carrots further thus diffusing the marinade slightly. No complaints from family however no compliments either.
