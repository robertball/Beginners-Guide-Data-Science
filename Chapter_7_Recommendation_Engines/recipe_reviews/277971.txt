Very tasty!  Next time will put veggies in a bowl to toss. Used two pans. One for chicken and one for veggies.  Only used broccoli and cauliflower. Did add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to spices and added black pepper and cayenne to sauce mixture.

it was nice but I would make the peppers as optional, due to they don't get soft enough so that changes the taste of the hash.
