I'm in the middle of Whole 30 right now and this is a good quick and easy snack. Made my own mayo to be safe (only takes a couple of minutes).

This is a very flavorful recipe for tuna salad. I highly enjoyed the creaminess of the avocado against the crunchy additions to the fish. This was quick, easy and enough to easily serve 2 for a light, healthy lunch. Will make again!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe, and it didn't disappoint. Something different for tuna, and so good if you like avocado! I didn't measure the celery--just chopped up one rib. Also didn't measure the onion, just chopped two green onions. I had to use some dried dill since I didn't have fresh. I squeezed some fresh lemon juice right into the tuna salad and didn't add any kosher salt. Thanks for a wonderful lunch! I will try this again.

Super simple and very easy. We added a dollop of horseradish and have made this twice. We also ate it with some black bean quinoa chips.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I was a little worried it would be too salty so I didn't add any kosher salt and didn't miss it at all. This was packed with flavor and was light and filling. I did notice that the tuna mixture does taste better the longer  it sits so making ahead is a plus. I also like my tuna a little more moist so next time I will increase the mayo slightly. Delicious!
