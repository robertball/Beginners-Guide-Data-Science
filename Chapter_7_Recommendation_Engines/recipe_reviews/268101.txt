This was pretty good. I think I would prefer a bit more soy because they're pretty sweet between the sugars and ketchup. I also thought it would cook into more of a slick glaze, but the potatoes absorbed most of the sauce - which was delicious, but I expected a sticky sauce.

I will make it again.  I added a little corn starch soaked in some of the sauce to make it a little thinker sajce.
