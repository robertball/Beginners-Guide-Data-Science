I made this last night and I tasted it after it cooled. I was pretty disappointed, not sweet enough, could not taste the cookie butter, too dense. I decided to throw it away in the morning. This morning I sat down to review it and then thought I should try it again. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! The flavors all melded and came together to produce a sweet, moist bread. I made half the recipe and decreased the bananas to 2 rather than 3. I think the addition of nuts would compliment this bread. Good recipe.

We just recently discovered cookie butter.....yummm!  I had some bananas and didn't want 'just'  banana bread, so I opened AllRecipes to do an ingredient search and before I even typed in bananas, there was this recipe.  PERFECT!  This made such moist bread with that special surprise ribbon of flavor going through it.  Hubby loved it!!!  Enuf said!

A reliable recipe! I've made this cake 3 times and it's never failed me. My friends and colleagues loved it. It's moist, tasty and the melted cookie butter in the middle is the perfect secret ingredient.
