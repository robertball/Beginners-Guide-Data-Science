Easy to make and smelled very nice cooking.  I think there may be an error in the recipe as it lists fresh cut bean and then frozen cut beans.  I used a cup of fresh only.  I also used a regular masala mix not specifically for biryani.  Other than that, it worked just as it should.

So good! A little spicier than I expected, so next time I'll make some raita to go with it. It's pretty versatile, too, so it's easy to customize with whatever veggies you have on hand.

I halved the recipe and donâ€™t feel there was enough spice.
