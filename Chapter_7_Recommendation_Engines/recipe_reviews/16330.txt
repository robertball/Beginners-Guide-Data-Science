This  is almost exactly how I make stuffed peppers. Except that I brown and season the meat before hand, pour off the oil , mix in the remaing ingredients,stuff the peppers, and then cover during baking. I never baste...the steam does the basting for me.  The last five minutes of baking remove cover and sprinkle grated mozzarella or cheddar over each pepper for added flavor if you like.

Loved the recipe but the green peppers need to be blanched before being put into the oven.  Put green peppers into boiling water for 1 - 2 minutes then quickly put in ice water. Then proceed with recipe as is.  Green pepper have a much better consistency this way.

I made this drunk. In a toaster oven. With ketchup and sliced cheese. Also, no worcesterrshire sauce or onoin powder or garlic powder. It was amazing. I'm still drunk. And it's still amazing. Rock on.

I found that the sauce in this recipie was not enough, as there was none in the bottom of the pan for basting. Also, it was a little to thick.I think a thinner sauce and more of it, would make for better basting. This recipie did not specify wheather to bake covered or not. This can definately affect baking results.I would, however try this dish again, making certain revisions. It was pretty good but could stand some improvements.***UPDATE- I originaly gave this recipe 4 stars, however,I have made some revitions and will now give this recipe 5 stars. Here is what I do....Do not precook the ground beef. Mix uncooked beef with 1/2 C instant rice. (saves time) Instead of garlic and onion powder,sautee 1 small onion, finely chopped, and 2 cloves minced garlic in olive oil prior to adding to meat mixture. Also I add 1/2 of a 15 oz can of italian style stewed or diced tomatoes and 1/2 t italian seasoning to meat mixture. For the sauce I use 1 15 oz can of tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 can of tomatoes, pureed,a dash of sugar and 1/2 t of italian seasoning. Or,you can substitute jared marinara sauce for tomato sauce in both meat mixture and over the top. This works well. These can also be cooked in a slow cooker on high for 2 1/2-3 hrs or untill thermometer inserted into center reads 160 degrees. Enjoy!

This was my first time to make stuffed peppers.  I steamed my peppers for about 15 minutes before hand to soften and to reduce cooking time.  While cooking the meat, I added ALOT of onion powder and 2 cloves of garlic, minced.  I used brown rice.  I mixed together with regular tomato sauce and worcestershire. Then topped with basil, oregano, garlic tomato sauce because that was the only other can I had available.  I baked at 350 for 30 minutes, I did not baste every 15 minutes. They turned out tender, not mushy, and wonderful. My husband has never had stuffed peppers in his life and loved them, actually went back for seconds.  My children (10 & 6)topped theirs with parmesean cheese and ate the meat out of the middle, thought it tasted like the meat used in spaghetti sauce.  They both tried a taste of the pepper, which made mom happy. Maybe next time they'll try more.  Great recipe!

I followed suit with the reviewer who dirtied only one skillet to cook the rice and beef.  I sauteed 1/2 onion, and a few cloves of garlic for 10 min.  I removed and browned meat(used the beef, pork, veal mix for better flavor) draining all the gross grease and returned the tasty onion mixture back again.  I then added the 2 cans of tomato sauce, worcestershire sauce, rice, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and a dash of paprika, and 1 cup water like the other reviewer suggested(dont think it really needed all that water-maybe half) and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Toward the end I added in some shredded cheddar cheese(love cheese).  I stuffed red, orange, and yellow peppers and placed in a casserole dish on top of tomato sauce and baked as directed.  They were good but I tend to like a little more rice in my stuffed peppers so next time I will add a tad more rice..otherwise these were very enjoyable.

Good, solid, basic recipe for stuffed peppers that offers the freedom to tweak to your own liking. I could see this recipe in a basic and general reference-type cookbook. I did put my own spin on this as well. I used green, orange, yellow and red bell peppers, not just for color but for a milder, sweeter flavor. I cut them in half lengthwise, then blanched them for about three minutes before transfering them to an ice bath. I cooked the rice, but did NOT cook the meat - added an egg, chopped onion, minced garlic rather than the garlic and onion powders, fresh chopped parsley, oregano and thyme, as well as salt, pepper, a handful of grated Parmesan cheese, and tomato sauce I had put up from my garden. Poured more sauce over the peppers than called for, dotted with butter, then baked for about 45 minutes. Now it's a five star recipe in my book!

These turned out DELICIOUS and flavorful! Even with a few substitutions: Used ground turkey vs. ground beef, added a can of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic (omitted garlic powder) to ground turkey before stuffing, used 2 tsp. of italian dressing (fat-free) vs. 1 tsp., omitted the worchestershire sauce, covered it with foil so no basting needed. This recipe did yield enough filling for only 4 large bell peppers like the other reviewers stated, which made 1 bell pepper too much for one person. Next time, I'll try and make it for 6 small bell peppers (so there will be enough room for side dishes!). Thanks for the great recipe!

I actually used this recipe with the fresh garlic and onion(I also used one cup of minute rice...all that I had).  I stuffed the peppers with an uncooked meat and rice mixture and put it all in my crockpot. I also put more tomato sauce over everything.  Let it cook on low for 8-10 hours. Easy and it kept the house cooler on a hot summer day!

Very good, I added onion & garlic as well, YUM!  I "microwave steam" the pepper (in my Pampered Chef micro steamer...I love it) for mine, but my hubby likes them cooked per the recipe (a little crisp) he loves them!  Sometimes I mix 1/2 beef & 1/2 pork.  Thanks Bonnie!!

Very easy to prepare.  I think one can of tomato sause isn't enough though, to be able to add to the mixture and baste the peppers.  Also, I only get about 3 peppers stuffed.  Maybe the ones I use are larger or I fill them more.  Anyway, they taste good!

Because I dislike it when someone alters a recipe then rates it, I made this recipe exactly as directed.  It was great!  Even my kids enjoyed it.  Next time I will make more sauce for the topping, but other than that, it was great as is.

I made this as written the first time.  The taste is excellent and everyone enjoyed them. I gave it 4 stars because the peppers came out too "tough" to be easily cut and eaten. The second time I made them, I did not change anything except I parboiled the peppers for 2 minutes, then dunked them in ice water to stop the cooking.  I also cut them in half length-wise. They are easier to stuff this way and allow serving 1/2 pepper for smaller appetites. Also, if you use different colored peppers, you can mix the colors on each plate for a more interesting presentation.

This is the perfect time of year for this recipe.  Peppers are still plentiful and affordable locally and meanwhile the temps are cool enough to have the oven on.  This is very nice, basic stuffed peppers recipe.  I didn't stick to the preparation method as I don't precook the beef or the rice.  It requires much longer baking that way but I believe the flavor is so much better.  The rice cooks fine with the longer cooking time and I think has a better texture then using precooked rice (which can fall apart and disintegrate after being cooked again in the mix).  I bake for an hour and a half covered and then remove the cover for another half hour.  Meat, rice and peppers are all done just right for me.  Yes, it can be more greasy not precooking and draining the meat but it depends on the ground beef you choose, and I would pick that any day over dry meat.  The Worcestershire is a great addition!  Used fresh garlic and onion instead of powders.  Added a can of diced tomatoes to the 2nd can of tomato sauce before pouring over the filled peppers.  Happy tummy and lots of leftovers for the fridge and freezer.

Great recipe !!  I also used arborio rice as another reviewer did.  Works very well for this recipe.  Instead of par boiling the peppers, I gave them a light coat of EVOO and roasted them under the broiler, turning them every so often so as not to burn them,  just until they began to soften.  Then added the rice and beef mixture and baked for about 15 min. Then topped them with fresh grated Parm. cheese.  Very good !  My husband and I both agreed the roasted peppers were a great added flavor.  This is a keeper for sure !

We certainly loved this dish.  I read all the reviews and made some "quick" changes.  I did blanche my peppers first for 10 minutes and then put them into cold water.  What a difference this made! I browned my beef with some onions and then drained.  I used a spanish rice mix (follow the package directions) and added a can of mushrooms, black olives and 2 tsp of red pepper.  I also added an Italian blend of cheeses to the mix.  For more flavor I used Spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Baked as directed with this recipie and everything was done in a hour.  I had plenty of mix left over to freeze for another quick meal.  I served this dinner with Rosemary Roasted Potatoes, Spring Mix Salad with homemade Italian Dressing and crusty garlic cheese bread.  Awesome!

I have tried other stuffed peppers recipes but I like having the rice and meat cooked first - otherwise the rice can be undercooked and crunchy. Reducing the recipe for 3 people made enough for 4 peppers. I did blanch the peppers first and drained off liquid after browning the meat. Replace the pepper tops because it helps steam the insides and you'll know when its done because the tops will brown. Instead of measuring out the Italian seasoning, I just put the tomato sauce on and then topped each with the dressing - no need to measure it. I've even used spaghetti sauce once. Four peppers fit in my 8x8 glass pan. I put some water on the bottom of the pan without basting and covered all with foil. Remove the foil after 1/2 an hour. Mine only took 45 minutes. Using green, yellow and red peppers makes a nice presentation. I've made this numerous times, great for company.

This is a variation of a recipe my wife found in an old Hunt's cook book right after we got married. We've been enjoying this dish for years. Excellent! Serve with shredded cheddar melted on top. I like to have corn as a side with this dish.

I just made this recipe (modified) last night and both my hubby and I really enjoyed it. I used two small onions (chopped) and 4 garlic cloves (minced) instead of the dried onion/garlic powder. I almost tripled the W. sauce and added lots of parsley/thyme/tarragon - came out with full of flavor.... also used a veggie spag. sauce instead of the regular tomato sauce and added some bay leaves to the sauce. I pre-steamed the peppers so I only had to put the dish in the oven for about 30 minutes...nearing the end of the 30 minutes, I added parmesan cheese to the tops of the peppers and broiled away... Yummy!!! This recipe is a good starting point - but I think that if I had followed the recipe it would have ended up being a tad bland...

We love this one at our house and I have made it 5 or 6 times.  Here is what I do.   I use 2 peppers and cut them in half.  There is extra filling (probably enough for one more pepper) which I just scoop on the outside of the peppers.  (6 Peppers are too expensive for our budget)  I poor an extra can of tomato sauce over the top of everything and use lots of italian seasoning.    I like to use spanish rice if I have it on hand, white rice works great too.  I "blanched" the peppers as someone else suggested this last time and it made a HUGE difference.  Apparently blanching means boiling them in water for 2 minutes and then putting them in ice cold water before you stuff the peppers.    Enjoy

It was OK, but I think it could be really great with a few modifications. 1)Blanch or otherwise pre-cooked the peppers. 2) More tomato sauce, or even adding tomato pieces. Mine dried out even with all the basting. 3) Top with cheese. This was the one missing flavor in the final product.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I made it last night for the first time! It was delicious. I made the following modifications for fun: I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 Italian sausage (which gave it an extra kick). I also used fresh, chopped mushrooms and real onion and garlic instead of powder. 5 minutes before it was done I sprinkled the tops with colby jack cheese. Yummy...

My first time making these, and they turned out great!  I followed the recipe to the letter except that I covered with foil for the first half hour and added some sharp cheddar in the last few minutes.  I thought the texture of the peppers was really good - cooked, but crisp.  They weren't mushy or overdone at all.

I used red bell peppers and green peppers.  The red give it a wonderful slightly sweet flavor.  I will use all red next time.  Also, to cut fat and carbs, I used extra lean turkey and reduced the amount of rice in half.  In addition to 1 can of tomato sauce, I used 1 cup of Pace chunky salsa.   I put all the liquid and the uncooked rice in with the browned beef and let it cook 20 min until rice was cooked, then put it in the  parboiled peppers for 20 min. No need to baste.  Very moist and juicy.

This recipe needed alot of doctoring up! I added in the diced up discarded tops of the bell peppers and real onions to the browned meat, a clove of minced garlic, a can of rotel tomatoes to the sauce, and mozarella and parm cheese in the mixture.  stuff the peppers, then poor the rest of the sauce on top of each one and then top with a little sprinkle of cheese! oh yeah, and some fresh basil in with the stuffing

These were delicious! I made them for my first time and they were super easy. We went as far as adding 2.5 times more beef, tomato sauce, and rice. It was still cutting it really close. What made them even better was fresh provolone on top! Mmmmmmm............. We also did the thing where you boil the peppers for 2 minutes first then let them soak in ice cold water. If we didn't, they would have fell apart. We also didn't baste them. We just added half of the sauce first and the rest with 15 minutes to go (when we added the provolone) You all should try it..... delicious!!!!!

i omitted the garlic and onion powders, and instead added one yellow onion chopped and about 2 teaspoons of crushed garlic. i baked mine at 400 for 40 minutes, cut them in half, sprinkled with mozerella and baked for 20 more. i didn't baste them every 15 minutes or cover them with foil, and they came out just fine. next time, i'll add in more tomato sauce and mix in mozerella before stuffing. these are really good and make a full meal alone. they remind me of a pizza without the crust! versatile and great recipe!!

We enjoyed these so much.  The flavor was fantastic.  I did ended up making quite a few changes based on what was in the fridge - used ground turkey breast, orange peppers, added diced sauted onion, cayanne and red pepper to the filling and topped each one with a slice of sharp cheddar in the last 10 minutes of bake time.  I will make these often.

Very simple to make, tastey and everyone ate their dinner!  That's what counts in my house.  I did soften the peppers the day before in a pot of boiling water as well as pre-cook the rice at the same time.    I also heated the assembled peppers in tomatoe sauce. covered  with aluminum foil.  Dinner was ready to eat in 20 minutes.

I made a few changes to this recipe, based on others' reviews. I added cheese to the mixture and add some chopped onion when I was browning the hamburger. I also covered the baking dish, instead of basting, and cooked for the amount of time specified in the instructions. It turned out incredibly tender. During the last 10 minutes of cooking I took the tinfoil off of the baking dish and added cheese to the top of each pepper. The dish turned out amazing! I had large peppers and filled up five, 3 green and 2 red. We ate 2 for dinner that night, and my husband took the leftovers to work for several days in a row. This is definitely a keeper!

I think this was a great recipe and I followed it exactly as it is. Only reason for three starts is that it was bland. This is a great base recipe, so next time I will make with my own blend of spices.

This recipe turned out great, with a few twists. I used chopped onion and minced garlic in place of the powders. I also boiled the peppers about 4-5 minutes before stuffing them as other reviews suggested. I think they would have still been too crunchy and undercooked if I hadn't. Also they need a whole 15 oz of tomato sauce, maybe more, just for pouring over the peppers in the pan. I will definitely be making this again.

Didn't have italian seasoning, but found a recipe online: equal parts oregano, basil, marjoram, thyme and rosemary. Fabulous! Also, I had a rice snafu (it didn't cook and was crunchy) so I made it with orzo istead and it was really, really, really good. Added cheese like some of the others to top it off too!

Lovely way to serve all the bell peppers popping up in the garden in the summer! But they definitely need to be blanched in boiling water 1st. Brown beef w/ minced garlic and some diced onion. Instead of 2X tom. sauce, I used 1 can tom. soup. Also whilst they're baking, they need a generous sprinkling of shredded cheese! A little bit of work goes into these, but they're well worth it b/c they look so pretty all lined up like delicious meaty, cheesy, pepper soldiers.

My family loved this recipe...even my picky 10 year old! I simplified it a bit, and used jarred marinara sauce instead of the tomato sauce. I also steamed the green peppers for 10 minutes, then cooled in an ice water bath until stuffing. After stuffing the peppers, I topped each one with a bit of shredded mozzarella. I baked them uncovered for 30 minutes, and did not need to baste them at all.

This is good basic recipe. I changed it up by using hot & mild Italian sausage instead of hamburger. I also used an onion & tomato paste with oregano & basil instead of plain tomato sauce to mix with the sausage & rice to fill the peppers. This created enough filling for 8 small peppers and to fill in around them in a 9 x 13 pan. I topped with a 16 oz can of flavored diced tomato. I added mozzarella cheese the last 10 minutes of cook time. It turned out fantastic. I'll have to make this once a month, since my family liked it so much.

Yummy! Better than Stouffers. I followed the recipe almost exactly... except I substituted some left-over Rice-a-Roni for the rice... and added some garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Worsteshire sauce (which I can't spell) to the Italian seasoning used on the can of tomato sauce for the baking dish. I also boiled the peppers for 10 or so minutes after seeding them to precook.  Like others, I covered with foil to avoid basting.  Really good, comforting food. Great way to use up left over rice.

Made this for my Dad because I don't eat meat. I made a couple of changes, but basic ones. Used real onion and garlic which I browned with the meat. Used yellow and orange peppers for a lighter pepper flavor. Also used spaghetti sauce for a little more flavor. For myself I followed another reviewer's advice. Grilled garlic and mushrooms and added ricotta, parmesan and cheddar. Added the rice and layered this mixture between layers of spaghetti sauce. My pepper was 4 stars, but my Dad only gave his 3. He said even with spicing it up a bit it was a little bland. I would make this again but might make some changes to add more flavor. BTW if you cut the peppers in half lengthwise, you can fit more filling in, and they stay upright more easily. Thanks for posting!

I never brown my meat- do it all in the oven. Mix ground turkey, chop pepers, onion, a fresh tomato, spinach and quinoa and brown rice. Season to taste and sprinkle a little olive oil.  Cut tops and bottoms or multi colored peppers and bake in ductch oven at 400 degress for an hour with a little beef broth in bottom of pan.  Out of this world good.

I made these as written the first time and we thought they were good, but just a little bland.  The second time I made them I used brown rice and ground turkey, doubled the Worcestershire, made my garlic and onion powder measurements just a bit "rounded", added about 6-7 drops of tobasco sauce to the mixture, and used mostly red peppers instead of green (personal flavor preference.)  I baked them covered in a dutch oven and don't bother basting.  With the extra seasoning (especially the tobasco) we really liked them!!

This was a hit at dinner last night.  I did a few things different just to suit my family's taste: used turkey instead of beef, brown rice, and one can of diced tomatoes and one 8 oz can of tomato sauce in the stuffing mix.  Then I used 2 cans tomato sauce and the italian seasoning for the topping.  I covered and cooked for 1 hour at 375* and then added cheese and cooked another 10 minutes uncovered.  The peppers were perfect with out having to steam them first.  I added a little more seasoning then called for and you can add in your favorites to make it your own.  This is one of those dishes that leaves room for you to season how you want.  I will keep this one handy!

These were excellent!  I used ground turkey and brown rice instead because that's what I had on hand.  My husband really liked them, as did my 2 year old. About 10 minutes before they were done, I added some shredded cheddar cheese to the tops.  Yummm!!

This was my first time making stuffed peppers. Instead of onion powder, I  sauteed about a 1/2 cup chopped onion in a little olive oil, drained the oil, then added the beef. I also added about 2 tbs of grated parmesan cheese to the rice/beef mixture.  I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I thought the saltiness from the cheese would help.  I sprinkled some cheese & bread crumbs with some sauce on top before baking. I guess I am used to my mom's stuffed peppers...the mixture was flavorful and moist but I like the "juice" at the bottom of the pan. These didn't have that. Maybe I did something wrong? I will add more pureed tomato next time. Otherwise these were so good!

I made this dish according to the recipe.  As there wasn't enough tomato sauce for basting, I added more; so, be sure to have extra available.  The texture of the peppers was "just right" and the whole dish was very flavorful.  I will never pre cook my peppers again!

This is similar to how I've always cooked my peppers, but I cover them, so I don't have to baste or blanch the peppers during cooking.
Use a muffin tin to stand peppers up in - then you don't have to cut the bottoms!

This recipe was pretty good.  I prefer ones that have you put the meat in raw so it forms a little meat loaf and sticks to the pepper.

A couple of things I would like to mention:  I must have used very generously sized peppers, because I didn't have enough filling for 6 peppers. 4 would have been perfect. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added fresh chopped onion (1/2 of a large) and fresh garlic. As far as the sauce, I didn't think there was enough to provide any basting sauce, so add more sauce if you need it. However, if you parboil the peppers as one person suggested, you won't need extra sauce. This is just such a good basic recipe. I had been looking for one that I could use as a basic and then "tweak" depending on what our mood is, or what's in season. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good recipe for traditional stuffed peppers.  I added a can of diced tomatoes to mixture and also cumin for flavor and sliced green onions instead of onion salt.  Par-boiling the peppers reduces the baking time by at least a third.  Mixture made enough for 4 peppers.  The red peppers are sweeter and at least as desirable as green.

This is a really good recipe.  Because I like fresh vegitables, I subsituted the onion powder and garlic powder with one small onion finely chopped and two small minced garlics.

These stuffed peppers were amazing. Next time I will try pre-cooking the beef. Or, I will bake for 45 min., remove, cut in half and bake for 30 min. then broil for 5 min. with cheese and sauce on top. I will defenitely make this again!!

This was really good. I changed a couple things. 1. I added some diced onions to my ground beef when I browned it. 2. I substituted spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce for a little more flavor. I also covered it with tin foil to cook so that the steam could cook the peppers and eliminate the basting.

My boyfriend said these were very good. I blanched the peppers (per another reviewers recommendation). I didn't have long grain rice, so I substituted traditional white rice. I added a diced onion to the ground beef. For the tomato topping I used one can of tomato sauce, added a splash of lemon juice and Worcestershire and red wine, and then Italian seasonings. Topped with Parmesan cheese. I would make again.

Very Yummy!!The only thing I did different was I used real onion and real garlic. Next time I am thinking about mixing some shredded cheese in with the meat mixture before cooking! I also steamed the peppers before cooking (10-15 each), that way I didn't have to tend to them after I put them in the oven - and it reduced the cook time to 40 mins.

These were good. I did them a little differently, i used lean ground turkey and brown rice. The mixture was only enough for about 5 medium size bell peppers. I felt like they needed more seasoning, i browned the meat with fresh chopped onions, minced garlic, salt and pepper and some ground cayenne pepper. Still felt this was missing something so i will play around with the recipe, great base to start with.

Love it! Few changes: I added cheese in the filling mixture and some on top (shredded Italian 5 cheese blend), I also loved it with red bell peppers. I threw in some tiny diced yellow squash from the garden with the ground beef. I seasoned everything as I went with italian seasoning and s&p. Also, I followed the tip of another member by blanching peppers first. Picky 4 year old ate the filling all gone! Winner!

Green peppers really should be used. The tanginess of the green pepper is needed. This recipe is solid. It has plenty of spice & flavor. It's nothing special though.

Amazing! I added extra italian seasoning and did not baste the peppers, just through the tomato sauce in with the meat and all. Added diced onion. Only needed 30 minutes in the oven.

My husband and I loved the flavor of these stuffed peppers.  I made a few changes to the original recipe.  I used 3/4 lb of sweet italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I chopped the sausage after I cooked it so it was ground up - then I added it to the sauce/rice mixture.  We loved it!

I really enjoyed these, the peppers were cooked perfectly and I did not baste, just covered. I added shredded chedder on the bottom before I filled the peppers and topped them off with it too. I did season the meat first and cooked with real onions and garlic. I also used 1 15oz can and 1 8oz can of tomato sauce. I also used more rice, one cup uncooked. enough to fill 3 large and 3 medium peppers.

great flavor -- one key instruction is to COVER the peppers while baking.  Otherwise they don't get tender.  I didn't have anything but Minute Rice, and it was still excellent.

The only thing I did differently was to add a bit of cheddar cheese to the meat, and I didn't have Worchestershire so I used steak sauce. I may use more tomato sauce next time. This is your basic stuffed pepper recipe, delicious!

(typos) I took the rice and did that as it says, then I browned the meat and drained it. (I used canned stewed tomatoes since that is what we had) Then I finely chopped the green peppers and added the peppers and the rest of the mix as they said to make it all at the same time to the meat. I added a bit of water, eyeballed, and simmered. The length of time I simmered for is as follows: I made some corn and foiled it and put it on the grill. I made the corn first in foil wraps then when the dish hit the simmer stage I put the corn on the grill. when the corn was done I turned off the peppers and served it all piping hot. Was perfect. Thank you for the recipe.

I made these for a couple guests and they just loved it!  I used Basmati rice (what I had on hand) and halved the peppers instead of standing them up.  I used a little bit of water in the bottom of the pan and covered with foil so there was no need to precook or baste the peppers.  About 10 minutes before they came out I took the top off and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top.  Very simple and tasty!  I should also mention I only filled 4 peppers this way.  I was able to "stuff" more stuff into them as they were halved.

Good!  I think 1 lb of meat divided between 6 peppers is a little stingy though.  And I don't think my peppers are any sort of mutant size; 4 might be a better number.  I used wild rice which took about 35 minutes to cook and blanched the peppers first for about 15.  In the meantime, I browned the meat, drained off the oil, and then let the beef simmer in one 28 oz jar of barilla sauce with one can of diced tomatoes and a load of extra spices.  I baked them for about 1/2 hour because we were hungry; they could have been cooked a little longer.  But overall it was quite tasty!  Oh!  And I didn't do any of that basting...too lazy.  I just used a covered casserole so that the moisture stayed inside.  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent!  I admit that I did make changes as I do like to "play" in the kitchen.  I used a packet on Lipton Onion Soup mix in the cooked ground TURKEY and rice mixture.  I also used the wostershire sauce, italian seasoning, black pepper, and garlic salt to taste.  Prior to stuffing I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to the stuffing mixture and 2 eggs to make it more firm like meatloaf on the inside as it baked.   After stuffing the (homegrown!) peppers, I topped them each with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  I made a homemade sauce (like my mom ised to do =P can of tomato paste, 2 cans diced tomatoes, can tomato soup, garlic, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, capers--all to taste) and topped each pepper with the sauce.  I baked in the oven COVERED at 350 for about 55 minutes.  In the last 5 minutes I removed the foil and covered with shredded mozzerella and baked for another 5 minutes.  This turned out AMAZING!  Great recipe and awesome for modifications to make it your own.

These were very good, my husband loves them.  I made them for a Mother's Day get together and they were a hit.  They even freeze well.  I made so many for my get together that I froze a couple, defrosted them and made them tonight and they were still very good.

This is a great recipe, very versatile. I've made it 3-4 times now, making my own changes each time. Vegetarian style is very tasty, and healthier... I omit the ground beef, and instead saute 1 onion and 5-6 small mushrooms in oil, then add the rice, tomatoes, etc. (I find the Worcestershire sauce is indispensable -- adds a nice tangy kick that is necessary.) While the rice mixture cooks, I clean the peppers and boil them (don't have a steamer) for about 15 mins. Then I combine both, bake for 15-20 minuntes, and add some cheese on top at the very end. The whole process takes only about 40 minutes. Easy, fast, a little bit fancy and very delicious. (Even my one-year-old loves the rice mixture.) I find a nice substitute for the tomato sauce is a can of chopped tomatoes. hope this helps somebody.

This was very good, but like many others, I changed things up a bit.  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef and cooked it with a diced onion.  I also added a can of corn and zucchini to the stuffing mixture as well.  Instead of tomato sauce I used tomato soup in the filling mixture and on top of the peppers.  Instead of cooking the peppers in additional tomato sauce I anchored them in a can of chicken stock and covered them to bake, so the broth kept them moist and steamed without having to baste at all.  Very yummy, balanced, and filling; a hit with my family.

Very Good! I also used fresh onion and garlic and blanched the peppers for 2 minutes.  I used a can of diced tomatoes that were seasoned with garlic and oregano in the mixture instead of the tomato sauce. I added italian seasoning to the mixture. Instead of tomato sauce on the top I used a jar of prego roasted garlic and parmesan spagetti sauce mixed with more italian seasoning. Great way to use the peppers growing in my back yard.

A hit with my family.  The only changes I made were to par-boil the peppers and added onion when I browned the meat. Will make often!

I used ground turkey and brown rice, and I put the peppers covered in the oven while I was browning the turkey & cooking the rice. Then, I only had to bake for 30 minutes and the peppers were nice and tender. I skipped the basting, and I added fresh chopped onion and garlic to the mix.

Very good.  I used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and it added a little more flavor.  I would make it again!

MMMM!!! Delicious!  I used a crock pot.  I didn't cook the beef, I mixed with onions, rice, and a little tomato sauce, stuffed the peppers, put into crock pot on low, poured the rest of the tomato sauce and a can of diced tomato's,  Cook for about 5-6 hours.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

I love this recipe.  It is requested often in my home and that's saying a lot considering there are 3 finicky children to please.  I don't even measure out the sauce anymore, I have used this enough to eyeball it.  We like them topped with provel cheese added during the last 1 minutes of cooking so that it gets brown and bubbly.  Sometimes we mix ground beef and sage pork sausage for extra flavor in the meat.  Can't go wrong with this one!

My mothers recipe is much better.  You don't have to pre-cook the meat or the rice.  You mix 1 lb. of ground chuck with 1 can of stewed tomatoes, chopped onions, one envelope of dry onion soup, and a large handful of Minute Rice.  Combine all ingredients and place in hollowed out peppers.  Cover top of peppers with either ketchup or tomatoe sauce.  Cook covered at 350 for 2 hours.  Best stuffed peppers ever!!!!!

Easy recipe. I substituted Italian Pork Sausage for the ground beef, drain the grease off after cooking. I also used fresh Vidalia onion, fresh garlic and brown rice. I make my own tomato sauce with home grown toms, but I did use 16 oz. I omitted the Worcestershire sauce and cooked the brown rice in beef broth instead of water- Makes a world of difference. 

Great base recipe to tweak with your own touch.

This was a good base recipe. Next time I'll add another can of sauce, add a few red pepper flakes, use brown rice instead of white, and add real onions and maybe some celery. I like my peppers a little more tender so I would cook a little longer too.

I had never made stuffed peppers before but these were easy and delicious!! After reading a few existing reviews I was concerned the peppers wouldn't be tender enough. I cooked them on 450 for about 25 minutes and they were perfect! I also put mozzarella cheese on top because my family LOVES cheese..

I LOVED this.  I used brown rice, spaghetti sauce, real onion and garlic... and added some cheese.  Okay, so it wasn't exactly the same recipe.  But without this one as a jumping off point, I never would have gotten there.  It was really filling and flavorful.

This is a pretty decent version of stuffed peppers. Just to be different, I substituted salsa for the tomato sauce. Also, cooking the rice with chicken broth added a depth of flavor. I've made this twice, and both times it was a hit.

Simple and tasty.  Great for a weeknight dinner.  Can be made ahead of time and popped in the oven when you get home from work.  I also really like using fresh onions and garlic.

We blanched the peppers first, so then it only required baking for 45 min.  For the last 10 min, top with cheese.  Yummy!

These turned out well!  I did customize a little.  I made a vegetarian version by substituting mushrooms for the beef (and using a vegetarian version of Worcestershire sauce).  I also used fresh onions (instead of powder), which I sauteed with the mushrooms before mixing everything together.  I used instant wild rice, and poured extra tomato sauce (about twice as much) over the peppers before baking.

My husband really enjoyed them, but I added 2 shallots, some mushrooms, a can of diced tomatoes to the mixture of beef, & 2 cloves of garlic.  I also sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top after they came out of the oven.

Loved this recipe! So worth the steps to cook the rice and beef before baking. My husband asks for this meal more often than any other. Definitely needs a little more sauce though.

I thought this recipe was great with a few changes and additions. I used about a cup of rice since it didn't seem like enough. I used a large can and a small can of tomato sauce and added a can of diced tomatoes as well. Added some mushrooms and garlic and extra seasonings.  I didn't do anything to the pepper first just cooked them like the recipes says and they came out fine.

Never had stuffed peppers in my life and really wanted to try this out... not too bad but I felt like it lacked complexity. I mean, rice and ground beef whoopdidoo. No one in my family were really impressed. I guess we're not a stuffed pepper lovin family

Pretty yummy. I did make some changes.  I seasoned the filling as the recipe states except I added red chili flakes, I also used canned tomatoes instead of canned sauce and blended it.  As for the sauce over the peppers again I blended some canned tomatoes and added basil, oregano, red chili flakes, onion & garlic, salt and pepper and just let it simmer a bit.  It was pretty flavourful and I served it with a salad.

I really liked this recipe, but I did boil the peppers in salt water for 5 minutes before cooking, and I put a dab of tomato sauce in the middle of the meat mixture.  Awesome!

I took this idea and put my own swing to it. I was tired of cooking with tomato sauce so I used a dissolved bullion cube to give it moisture and a bit more flavor. 
Browned the meat and seasoned with garlic, onion, Worcestershire sauce and a seasoning salt mix. Instead of tossing the tops of the peppers I diced them and added them to the meat. Poured in my cooked rice along with 2 diced tomatoes. I added some moisture by dissolving a beef bullion cube in 1 cup of water and pouring 1/2 of the water before baking and the other 1/2 while baking. Also instead of baking the peppers whole, I cut them into quarters. This made them easier to eat.

I love stuffed peppers, though I prefer to use red, yellow, and orange peppers. I think that the yellow and orange have a much better flavor and aren't as bitter as green.

We LOVE this.  I've tried other recipies that use tomato soup and they're too sweet.  Some small changes...I use red peppers and I second the tip from others about prepping them by boiling them for 1-2 minutes before baking.  My 6 year old fights me for the last of these. ;)

Will try to make again... Peppers have to be blanched before stuffing as one reviewer suggested (unless you like al dente) and I also used 14 oz can of tom sauce and 14 oz can of italian diced toms for sauce... still could have used a little more....

Yummy, tasty, and easy. I always need more of the sauce than what it calls for.  I have people ask for the recipe every time I serve these.

Love, love, love this recipe! The only thing I did differently is I used half ground beef and half Italian sausage and I used a traditional Sphagetti sauce instead of adding the Italian spice to tomato sauce. I also covered it with foil while baking instead of having to continually having to bast it and the last 10 minutes I uncovered and topped it with mozzarella. It turned out great and everyone loved it!

I've been making this type or recipe for years and have adapted it. I use brown rice (no one notices & it's much healthier), ADD 1 cup shredded chedder  cheese at the very end; use red, yellow, orange peppers when prices are really good, after the mixture is cooked- stuff the peppers then wrap tightly in plastic wrap & freeze. When you want to eat them, just put froEn in the microwave and cook on high until heated through. The peppers are nice and soft!

Made this recipe without browning beef first and it turned out great! Cooked the rice first in the microwave before mixing with ground beef. I also made a little hole in the bottom of the peppers, using a toothpick to let out some of fat from the ground beef. I used lean ground beef so there wasn't very much. Peppers turned out very moist and yummy! Used red and yellow bell peppers since I find the taste of green peppers overpowering.

This recipe turned out really well for us. We scaled the recipe down for just the two of us. But I added more spices than the recipe calls for. I added more rice and shredded mozzarella into the meat mixture (I let the meat mixture cool a bit while I waited for the rice to cook before I added the cheese) I also put cheese on top while baking. I used more tomato sauce than was called for as well when I was basting them. I personally did not pre boil my peppers, I think its a matter of taste. But I think since I added the extra tomato sauce and had a ton to baste the peppers with it really helped.

mmmm mmmm mmm! Very good recipe. Only thing I did differently was boiled some water and cute bell peppers in half and boiled them in water for around 10 minutes, but no more! them drained and set aside... It makes them more tender and yummy to eat.

My family has been making these since I was a little girl.  We never cook anything before stuffing the peppers.  just mix it up like meatloaf, stuff the peppers and bake covered until almost done, top with cheese and bake some more uncovered.  much easier and less time consuming than this (use instant rice instead of regular rice)

This is a really good recipe!  I have made them twice, once with ground beef and once with ground turkey and both worked well for me. I have also used every color BUT green for the peppers (I really just don't like green peppers) and it works in anything!  I also don't use the extra sauce on top, I just mixed it all in. I've also never covered these while baking them and I think they turned out just fine.  I wouldn't eat stuffed peppers as a kid when my mom would make them for herself and now I know what I've been missing!

I absolutely loved this recipe!!  The only thing I did different was increase the amount of rice to about 1 1/2 because just a 1/2 seemed too small.. also when I tasted the rice/beef mix it seemed bland so I added a couple dashed of cayenne pepper and chili powder. The whole thing melded fabulously and it warms up well.

AFTER YOU STUFF AND PLACE THE PEPPERS IN THE PAN ADD  WATER HALF WAY UP THE PEPPERS. THAT WILL STEAM THE PEPPERS AS THEY COOK IN THE OVEN. I FOUND THIS METHOD WORKS REALLY WELL.

This was my first time making stuffed peppers and my family loved them! My sister wished I added cheese to the stuffing though. I guess it all depends on your personal preference. I also made 3/4 of a cup of rice instead of 1/2 a cup, and it still only filled 4 peppers. I was using large green peppers though and wanted them to be really full.

This is a standard recipe for Stuffed Peppers.  But if you want to add some additional flavor, use Hot Italian sausage with the ground beef.  You can omit the italian seasoning from the recipe.  I also use onions along with fresh garlic instead of the powder stuff. Cook the onios with the beef and sausage.

This recipe is very similar to the stuffed peppers I've been making for years, but with a little extra flavor thanks to the worcestershire sauce and Italian seasoning.  I made a few changes, however.  First, blanch the peppers in boiling water for about 5 minutes to help take away some of their bitterness.  Instead of onion powder and garlic powder, I use the real stuff - diced onion and minced garlic.  And, I add a slice of mozzarella to the top of each pepper during the last ten minutes of cooking.  This creates a nice flavor contrast.  All in all, a very good recipe.

I haven't had stuffed peppers since I was a little girl.  I don't remember liking them that well but I have such an over abundance of peppers this year that I decided to try stuffed peppers.  They were wonderful.  I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and then sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  Thank you I will make theses again!

Well this was a big hit.  My oh so fussy children actually like these!!  I did change it a bit from the recipe as given.  I used fresh onion and garlic instead of powder and I used tomato puree instead of a can of tomatoes as my kids don't like things with a sauce.  I then poached the stuffed peppers in the oven.  Turned out well and I will definitely be making them again.

My parents, picky sister, my fiance and I all loved this recipe!  I made a few changes-- I doubled the amount of Worchester sauce, doubled the amount of onion powder, at least doubled the amount of garlic powder, and I used red peppers instead of green.  At first I made both but the red peppers, though more expensive, are sweeter and more tender. I also topped it with reduced fat mozzarella cheese and a bit of parm cheese. Since I'm on a wedding dress diet, I've been using either 99% fat free ground turkey breast or 93% lean beef and it's all delicious... thanks!!

I actually used leftover wild rice because that's what I had on hand and it worked very well.  I prefer red bell peppers so that's what I used.  For more flavour I used spaghetti sauce as other reviewers suggested.  My husband (who usually hates stuffed peppers) loved these.  I will make them again.  Thanks!

With a little tweaking this has become a family favorite.  The changes we made are these:  Red Peppers instead of Green, Ground Chicken or Yves Veggie Ground Round instead of beef (cuts out a lot of fat!), Uncle Bens Spanish style rice instead of white rice, and finally instead of tomato sauce we used Classico Spicy Red Pepper spaghetti sauce.  The substitutes were based on what we had at home and it turned out fantastic!

Great recipes.  I didn't baste(there is no need) I just covered them with tinfoil and then removed the last 10min. I also added cheese at the end to melt on top.

Great recipe! I suggest blanching the peppers before cooking, that way you don't need to keep pouring sauce over the peppers and they don't take as long to cook in the oven (half hour instead of an hour). I also added shredded parmesan cheese and sautéed mushrooms to the ground beef mix, which made it even tastier. I skipped mixing the Italian seasonings into the tomato sauce to add on top of the peppers because I don’t like all the flavors. I just poured tomato sauce over the top and added a little more cheese before putting the peppers into the oven.

I'm not sure what I did wrong here.  I loved the flavor of this but it didn't turn out the way it should have.  There was no juice to "baste" the peppers with, and even though I added lots of water, it still took forever to cook, and the peppers were still too tough.

I substituted ground beef for ground turkey and white rice for couscous, and I think these are excellent. But, don't try to save them by freezing the leftovers! Freezing them ruins the green pepper and they don't quite taste the same.

I've made this several times now. I followed the recipe with only a few modifications. I used brown rice instead of white and added fresh garlic and minced onions instead of onion and garlic powder.  It's very easy to make and the taste is excellent.  Thanks.

This is an excellent start for stuffed peppers; I made a few changes. I used real garlic instead of powder and like many other reviewers, used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and added cheese during the last 10 minutes. Both my hubby and I loved it this way- and the more garlic the better! I didn't cover while baking; I chose to bast as directed and I will continue to do it that way each time I make it. I did have to open another can of tomato sauce for basting but it was well worth it.
Thanks Bonnie!

I scaled the recipe down to make 2 stuffed peppers. I sauteed a small chopped onion before browning the ground beef with the garlic. I also added some chopped mushrooms, diced smoked sausage and fresh herbs to the mixture. Although I took other reviewers' advice and layered some cheese in with the mixture, it disappeared during cooking! I'm not sure what happened there! This is a good recipe though - nice and healthy, and tasty too.

the recipe was great! after reading the reviews i did however alter some things. definitely need more sauce than is called for and if you cover with foil you don't need to baste. i also boiled the peppers a little first. delicious! my 4 year old even ate them-and that's saying a lot! i've shared the recipe with friends.

It tastes delicious!! However, I would use 2 cans of the tomato sauce instead of one (at least). Regarding to the baking time I would suggest 30 minutes more or until the bell peppers get brown on the top. My husband is very picky but I was amazed how he really enjoy them alot.

These tasted wonderful. My husband loved them, although he said they would taste even better with some cheese. I also couldn't baste them liked the recipe said, because there was no liquid or sauce to do that with. I used an extra can of sauce, and there still wasn't enough to baste with. But, this is a great recipe that really pleased my husband!

I made this tonight for my boyfriend and myself. I used four peppers (green, orange, red, and yellow) to see how it tastes with the different sweetnesses of the different peppers. I added diced white onion to it and added to onion, seasoning, and sauce to the ground beef as I browned it. It was a hit! My boyfriend is a stickler for good food and he said it was delicious. So easy to make!

I haven't tried this recipe until now but had it on my meals-to-try list. I thought the instructions were simple and easy to follow. I used all of the ingredients listed accept three. Worchester sauce, tomatoe sauce, and onion powder. In replace of those ingredients I used liquid smoke with bbq sauce, fresh chopped onions, and diced tomatoes.  I seasoned the meat before browning it. I didn't need to baste and topped the finished stuffed bell pepper with cheddar colby jack cheese blend.

Thanks to all who offered suggestions and tips. I browned the ground beef with fresh chopped onion and garlic. I added one can of Rotell to a 15 oz can of tomato sauce to add some heat and then cooked the rice in the tomato sauce/Rotell mixture instead of water. (Reviewers are correct the beef/rice mixture would have been too dry without that added can of Rotell.) Mixed everything together and then baked. This was my first time making stuffed peppers but hubby said these were as good as his mother's peppers. Great way to use up red peppers and hamburger that doesn't require a bun. I will make this again.

Yes and mine just did not come out right the hamburger meat was way over cooked with 1st cooking it in a pan then baking it in the oven was just too much.
So yesterday, I made these again except I did not brown the meat ,I just mixed the raw meat with a egg and all the spices and stuffed the peppers and put it the oven for 1 hour 45 minutes tented with a tight fighting foil and they came out perfect!!

These were AMAZING!  The only rice I had was a package of Zataran's Dirty Rice...certainly added a great flavor to these.  I used Basil, Garlic & Oregano tomato sauce and topped with a mixture of Pepper Jack and a Mexican cheese blend.  Will be making these again for sure!  Thanks :)

I made this exactly as the recipe states.  The only thing I did different was to cover with tin foil as another rated suggested.  I didn't need to baste because the tin foil did it for me.  This was really easy and they came out delicious.

I follow this recipe exactly as its written. My girlfriend just loves it when I make this. Even feeding it to the little ones who don't like green peppers at all, they scoop out the insides and ask for more. I stick to this recipe exactly cause I don't want to compromise the original taste. My girl and kids thank whoever shared this one. You, are a true chef!!!! ;-P

I subbed Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage for half the ground beef in this and it added so much wonderful flavor! We felt the peppers seemed a little undercooked and would be better if they were cooked a bit before stuffing to soften them. I topped them with a slice of provolone cheese for the last 5 minutes of baking time. Really good!

Put a cpl tbsp of sauce into the bottom of the peppers, fill with mixture, add a tbsp of sauce on top then a bit of shredded cheddar, place into a dish with sauce in the bottom and bake for 45 mins at 350. never had a complaint.(I cook the hamburger first)

I have always made my own version of stuffed peppers,but thought I would try a recipe. This one! I must say, THEY WERE DELICIOUS! I am not a big fan of canned soups, but it works! I could not stop eating it, nearly made myself sick. The whole family loved them. DH ate one for breakfast this morning, said he couldn't stop thinking about the leftovers in the frig. Glad I made extra, having the last of it for lunch. Excellent as is! Thanks BDEGER!

The best stuffed peppers! I made few changes....steamed the peppers for 15 min to reduce overall baking time to half hour. I added dash of chili powder to mixture and topped with shredded mozzerella. YUM!!

From the first reading of this recipe I could see it would be lacking flavor, powder anything over fresh never makes sense to me, So first I went with fresh garlic and diced onion, added 1TBS fresh basil and  parsley, some chopped chinese chili peppers, drizzled with olive oil and baked, much better.

This was a really good recipe. The rice I use to stuff is lightly fried in a little bit of oil until it just starts to brown, then I add the water and about a tbsp or so of chicken and tomato seasoning, stir then let cover and cook as usual. I add cheese to the stuffing mix and top with cheese at the end.

I didn't have any Worchestershire sauce, so I added 1 tbps liquid smoke, 1/2 tbsp soy sauce, 1/2 tbsp lemon juice, 1/4 pepper jack cheese replaced the tomato sauce with stewed tomatoes, and grilled them in a pan for 1 hour on medium low. Also, I don't eat beef so I substituted ground pork sausage. *Fabulous* summer dish both hot and cold!

I really like this recipe because it was pretty basic and was easily doctored up. I hadn't had stuffed peppers in years and it brought me back to my childhood.

Huge hit!  I skipped the italian seasoning,used one can tomato sauce, one can diced tomatos, and one can chicken broth.  I put it all in the dutch oven and cooked it on the stove for an hour.  DELISH!!  And the peppers were a great texture!

you really needed to make a few changes. I used beef broth, thyme, wild mushrooms, spaghetti sauce, fresh onion and garlic and any other seasonings that you'd like also. I will also try it with cheese over it and some pink beans in the mix next time. Just be creative.

The peppers were outstanding.  I used green, yellow and red peppers to add more color.  I did use plain spaghetti sauce and a little of the canned tomatoes.  Next time I would add more rice as I felt more rice was needed. I did not pre cook the peppers they cooked perfectly under the foil.

I did not care for this recipe. I used all of the exact measurments, and regular sized peppers, but when it came to the part where I mixed everything together and poured it in the peppers, it only filled 3 1/2 of the peppers. Hmmm.

Having never even eaten a stuffed pepper before    ( I don't like peppers ) I tried making these last week. They were fantastic. I used yellow orange and red peppers instead of green and cooked the hamburger first. They got rave reviews. Making them again tonite.

The recipe should call for the peppers to be boiled so they are softer. Also there is only enough filling to fill 4 peppers. I added cheese to the top but wished there was cheese throughout the pepper along with the tomato sauce. Otherwise, the flavor was really nice!

This was delicious and super easy!!!  I used ground turkey instead of the beef only used 1/2 cup of water and only 1 can of tomato sauce.  The sauce was seasoned with italian seasonings.  I drained the juice from the diced tomatoes into my casserole dish and laid the sliced par-boiled peppers on top.  I used half of the tomato sauce in the meat mixture and the other half to top the peppers.  Sprinkled cheese on and baked!  A must make!!!

just made these for dinner - they were delish !!  just a couple adjustments - yes..obv brown the ground beef before combining w the rice - drain well (less fat!) - personally i think you need more rice than this recipe calls for - i'd say double - unless u want mostly meat - also i used tomato paste - around a tablespoon or so - stirred in to the rice/hamburger - didn't use italian seasoning - did use sauteed diced yellow onion - about 1/2 of an onion that i added to mixture - and good old salt + pepper - used orange peppers and steamed in microwave for 6-7 min - in a mostly covered container w a little water in bottom - came out perfectly!  and much less time + energy than using the oven - enjoy  =)

I followed everything in this recipe except I used pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I skipped the garlic & onion powder, but feel it would have been better if I kept that in.  I also did what another reviewer said and just steamed them in a dish with a lid...it was PERFECT.  The ingredients only fit 4 large stuffed peppers with none to spare.  It feeds 2 - 3 people without sides and 4 people with sides.  I also recommend topping with cheddar cheese before the last 10 mins of baking.  You will not be dissapointed.'

Good basic recipe! You can use any kind of tomato sauce, i've even made it with vodka sauces. I don't generally use more than 1 jar.  This recipe can also be made with ground turkey for a healthier option

Needs a lot of work. The stuffing does not hold together at all. Could use some other spices. Next time, I'm just going to use a meatloaf recipe for the stuffing. Also, the peppers should be boiled for about 2-3 minutes before stuffing.

This was a great recipe. Followed it to the teeth, except I did blanched the peppers prior to stuffing then. I was able to cut the oven time in half, great when you are short on time. This recipe will easly make its way back to my kitchen soon. Thanks allrecipes.com

I have a childhood memory of a relative making great stuffed peppers, and this is my second attempt at finding a good recipe.    This one didn't cut it. I made it  according to recipe directions.  For starters, the peppers (and I used green and yellow) were still tough.  Even a day later, heating them in the microwave doesn't soften them enough.    The recipe calls for basting  the sauce every 15 minutes. With what???  Try pouring one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce on the top of six green peppers.  There is nothing spilling over onto the bottom.  I used my common sense and added some water to the bottom. It really needs more sauce.

Easy recipe to make and came out great!!!  The only thing that I would add for the next time is some sort of tomatoe sauce to go in the pan with the peppers...besides that they turned out great!

Very good recipe!  This is the one I will be using from now on when I make stuffed peppers.  The only changes I made was I only had tomato paste instead of tomato sauce but I added water and seasonings to it and it worked great.  Also, toward the end of baking, I added mexican style cheese and feta cheese on top.  These were awesome!

simple and easy. For a mexi twist I omit italian seasoning and add cumin, paprika, oregano, and chili powder to the other seasonings. a can of black beans(rinsed and drained), corn, tomatoes and brown rice with some cheese on top is yummy. Parents- I pureed steamed broccoli, peas and spinach and mixed that in jic the kiddos don't want to eat the pepper part. Can't taste it at all!

These were so good! I covered them instead of basting and baked uncovered the last 15 minutes with cheddar cheese on top. Yummy!

I'm sorry but this recipe was not very good. the peppers came out still hard and the filling was tasteless. I remember my mom putting garlic and real chopped onion not powder in the filling. She also par boiled the peppers as well.  My husband was so disapointed with this dinner. I'm gona have to stick with Mom's recipe.

I've never tried a stuffed pepper before. The recipe was quick and easy, and I LOVED it. Will definitely make in the future. Changes to recipe I made:  I didn't add Italian seasoning, because I don't care for it, and I added a bit more garlic because I love garlic. I also added a little bit of mozzarella cheese on top. It was excellent.

Good recipe. I used ground turkey and red peppers in place of the ground beef and green peppers. I also sliced my peppers length ways and put a hole in the bottom to keep them from getting too soggy. I use chopped fresh garlic cloves and chopped green onions in place of the powders.

Okay, so I made these with green peppers. I don't know if that makes too much of a difference, but anyway, they were pretty good. One person thought they were okay, the other really liked them. I liked them a lot, but might try a couple other recipes before deciding which stuffed pepper is my favorite.

Oh man, these were SO GOOD! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I added about a half cup of cheddar cheese to the rice/beef mixture which just held it together a little better, instead of the beef and rice falling all over the place when you cut it open. Like others have said, definitely need more tomato sauce, which might have helped with the bell peppers being softer, because I didnt pre-cook them or anything and they were a little hard. That being said, SO FREAKIN GOOD, I recommend everyone try them as is or with everyone's suggestions.

This was a very good recipe.  I did saute one onion and 1 tsp. garlic and used turkey.  I took advice from another who boiled the peppers 1-2 min. then put them in cold water.  I also added 1/2 can italian tomatoes to the meat mixture and used the remaining can in the tomatoe sauce on top.  I did not however put all the sauce on top of the peppers because I thought is would be too soupy.  I just put a little on each pepper and the remainder in the bottom of the pan.  It is not necessary to baste the peppers.  You definitely need to cover the peppers and then uncover for the last 5 min. while the cheese melts.  My husband and kids loved this and I will definitely make them again.  Thanks

This was a great base-recipe.  I made a "fiesta stuffed peppers" variation by subbing a few things: italian sausage for ground beef, enchilada sauce for tomato sauce, 1/2 a real onion for onion powder and 2 large garlic cloves for garlic powder.  I omitted the worcestershire sauce and italian seasoning, and added in about a cup of frozen corn.  I cooked the italian sausage, onion and garlic in a large skillet.  Then added the rice, enchilada sauce, frozen corn and seasonings to taste.  I added a little mexican cheese mix to the top of each pepper, then put the lids back on for aesthetics!  I was able to stuff 4 medium sized green peppers and cooked them, covered, in a deep cassarole dish for about an hour.  I will defintely make these again - maybe an italian version?!

Tasty. Added shredded provolone on top. Used wild/brown rice blend instead of white rice and ground turkey instead of beef and it tasted comparable. Needed a bit of extra italian seasoning in the sauce that tops the peppers.

Went down very well with the boyfriend and roommate.  Next time we'll be using Italian sausage rather than ground beef, it was too much of a "sloppy joe" dinner.  I wanted something that you could light candles to.  I added chipotle powder and a TAD of chili powder as well, which was a good choice.

I have never had better stuffed peppers, and that's saying something, because I had an "aunt" (family friend) who made some AWESOME peppers back in the day!  I did use ground turkey instead of beef and added a lot more seasonings than called for (same seasonings, just more of it)... including stirring a little italian seasoning in the beef mixture as well as the tomato sauce mix.  I used green, red and yellow peppers and did NOT blanch or steam them first!  But rather baked them in my heavy dutch oven with the lid on (which in effect steamed them) and they were PERFECT... so tender.  Each of the different colors tasted a little different, but all were great!!   We will have these again and again... very tasty and easy to boot!!

This really didn't turn out that well for me.  I though stuffed peppers were made with raw beef in the peppers and baked, but this called for browned beef...?

Wonderful!  Made just as instructed but used brown minute rice instead.  Oh, and also blanced the green pepper for 1 to 2 minutes like another lady on here suggested.  Great anytime of year.  Light and hearty all at the same time!

I altered this a little - I added some chipotle chili powder, some frozen corn, a can of diced tomatoes, and about 3/4 cup shredded cheese.  I also used brown rice vs. white rice.  I loved it, though I could have cooked it a little longer - maybe I'll parboil the peppers next time.  My husband liked the filling. I will definitely make this again!

This has become a family favorite in our house.  When I make this, I double the rice, I use about 1 1/4- 1 1/2 lb. ground turkey, I add oregano to the turkey just as its done browning, and after I mix the meat and rice together, I let it cool a little and then add about 1/2 - 3/4 cup cheese to the mix, and also add the cheese on top.  Everyone loves it.  I used to blanche the peppers, but since only a few of us in the house actually eat the pepper, I don't take the time to do that anymore.  I think it tastes good either way.  Great recipe!!!

This was a great recipe. Total cost for seven peppers to be made was $30.00. I am craving them still! I recommend whole foods market meat, natural beef tastes better than factory beef pumped with antibiotics!

I had never had stuffed peppers before, but I've been into cooking new things lately so I thought I'd give it a try. I had a friend over who grew up on them, and she loved this recipe. She complimented me on it and took a couple home.

I would recommend putting about a tablespoon of sauce in the bottom of the peppers before adding the rice/meat mixture. The sauce on the top doesn't soak all the way through and this gives it a good even flavor.

Overall, a wonderful recipe!

This was really easy and delicious!  Took a little time to prepare but it's worth it.  I followed one of the reviewer's instructions by blanching the peppers in boiling water for 2-3 minutes then submerged in ice water before beginning.  

I added a little more seasoning and added it to taste.  Covered with foil and baked for 1 hours.  10 mins prior to an hour, I added cheese on the top and cooked for the remaining time uncovered.  

It really turned out nice and moist!  I omitted the water which was probably a good thing because the steam was enough water for the dish.  

I suggest for next time, adding chopped onions, minced garlic and some extra spices to make it even more mouthwatering!

Will use this recipe again!

This turned out super yummy!  The only thing I did differently was added taco seasoning to the meat when I browned it, and topped the peppers off with cheese.  I took another reviewers advice and cooked it with tin foil over the top, and it made the peppers come out perfect and tender with no crispy edges.

These peppers were great with some modifications.  First I sauteed an onion and added 2 cloves of minced galic.  I added the ground turkey and cooked until it was 3/4 of the way done.  I added fresh oregeno, the rice and a 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  I cooked this mixture for about 15 minutes until most of the water was absorbed.  The rice wasn't completely done, but cooked the rest of the way in the oven.  I did not discard the tops.  These help with moisture as well as makes a nice presentation.  I did not baste with sauce.  I put 2 cups of water in the dish.  This "steamed" the peppers and kept them moist.

This recipe is very, very good, but... I think it lacks a bit of kick! I like very flavorful and depthy food and this just doesn't quite meet the mark. Don't get me wrong, I've made it at least twice since I found the recipe, but it's just missing something. Maybe some chilli powder and extra garlic? I'm not quite sure. Anyway, good recipe to start, but don't be afraid to try adding different flavors!

I made a few tweaks to this recipe, instead of using onion and garlic powders, I sauted some onions, garlic and mushrooms then browned the ground beef. I also covered the peppers in foil while the baked, but other than that it is a good recipe. I will make again!

This is almost identical to a recipe I have used for years.  I add some red pepper flakes, finely diced red onion and parmesan cheese to the meat mixture.  Delish!

I can't give this recipe 5 stars because I changed it slightly.  I only used one can of tomato sauce and used fresh herbs.  I used brown rice (it's what I had on hand).  I used a covered casserole dish (so I wouldn't have to baste the peppers).  They came out wonderful!!!  Thanks for the start to a great recipe.

I had whole peppers frozen from my summer garden and used them.  This did not require as long of cooking time because the pepper were already soft.  I also used homemade marinara in place of the sauce from a can, this also eliminated use of the spices.  I baked covered and put cheese on top last 5 mins.  These were very good!!!

YUMMY!  These were great!  I added some chopped onion, about half a cup along with a cup of fat free chedder cheese in the meat mixture and substituted brown rice for the white rice and used the ultra lean meat for a low fat version that any weight watcher on the core plan would LOVE!

Excellent, basic recipe!  I used lean ground beef and divided the mixture between 4 peppers.  Paired with a green salad, this was an easy, filling meal.  This one is a regular on our menu!

I have never made stuffed peppers before but this recipe was really easy and tasty. I seasoned the ground beef earlier in the day to ensure that the beef was flavorful.  I used more dry herbs such as onion, garlic, and italian seasoning and I used tomatoes that had onion and garlic in them already and it was delicious. My husband and I never had them before and we both enjoyed the leftovers.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I would have given it 5 stars, but I think it needs more flavor.  Next time I'll probably add more garlic, some basil and I'll definitely use the same cheese. I used  the Sargento Classic 6 Cheese Italian with shredded Mozzarella, Smoked Provolone, Asiago, Romano and Fontina Cheese...it was yummy!  This definitely deserved 4 stars for being so fast and easy to make!  Thanks!

Great basic recipe, though you might have to add a lot more seasoning (salt, pepper, basil, oregano) for flavor. I also added chopped onions and doubled the rice.

This was amazing!! I did make a few changes though. I bought some prego 4 cheese sauce to replace the the red sauce in the recipe. It just made it easier. I also used some hot Italian sausage to add a little kick to it. Plus half a yellow onion. All these flavors together made a lot of stuffed peppers. Every bite I took just made me melt with pleasure. However the left overs where not as good :(

These were really good. I added some chopped onion to the hamburger while it was cooking and added some shredded cheddar cheese to the tops during the last 5 to 10 minutes. I only had enough filling for 4 peppers instead of 6. My husband thought they were great.

I made this recipe with ground venison and it was wonderful.  I never thought I was a fan of venison, but this was very good.  I did cover the peppers for about half of the cooking time to make them tender, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you.  Now I have something to make with my freezer full of deer!

These were really good.  My husband thought they were the best stuffed peppers he's ever had!  I did change a few things.  I didn't use rice, instead I used 2 shredded zucchini, I also added about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese to the meat mixture.  I also added some garlic powder to the tomato sauce that tops the peppers.  I baked them covered for 45 minutes, like another poster recommended, then I uncovered the last 15 minutes and toped with some more parmesan.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe, I'll be making these often.

The peppers were awesome but I had to cook them for closer to 2 hours than the 1 hour stated on the recipe which made the stuffing a bit dry.  I also added parmesan cheese to the beef/rice mixture & sprinkled grated mozzarella cheese on the top of the peppers at the end of the cooking time

I haven't had stuffed peppers in ages and it was just like I remembered it, yummy! I made a few alterations - added real garlic and onions plus mushrooms to the mixture and white cheddar during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Next time I'll sprinkle a bit of cheese in the mixture too! Great recipe!

I loved this recipe. Instead of the long grain rice i used Spanish Rice. mmm....it was so tasty and added a little kick to the flavor. After reading other reviews i covered my peppers when i put them in the oven and didn't have to baste them at all.

Really good!  I've had these before better, but this is the best I have ever made them =). minor changes:  I sauted onions with the meat. I also used half the tomatoe sauce and added diced garden tomatoes.  And I added cheese durring the last 5 min of oven time.  Delicous!

This dish is just like mom used to make!  

One tip: add some chopped vidalia sweet onion to the ground beef when it is halfway done browning and delete the onion powder but double-up on the garlic powder.

Terrific recipe!  I parboiled the green peppers which I cut in half.  I used brown rice, 1/2 pound ground beef, 1/2 pound ground turkey, and mixed a 24 oz can of diced tomatoes into the meat mixture before stuffing.  I also added a sprinkle of flaked red pepper.  I had enough meat to overstuff 6 halves and make two mini meatloaves (my 5 year old and 2 year old would not touch cooked green pepper).  Ultimate comfort food!

I kicked this recipe up a notch (wink, wink) and tripled all the spices, and added some hot sauce and red hot chili flakes - it was AWESOME! If you like your food spicy, try this! Great recipe! :)

As a kid, stuffed peppers were a regular meal in our house.  I tried this recipe as my first attempt making stuffed peppers on my own.  They turned out really yummy, but they weren't quite as saucy as I remember my mother making hers.  I will be using this recipe again, but I may tweak it a little bit next time.  I did add extra garlic, extra Italian seasoning, and a little extra Worcestershire sauce for more flavor.  My husband was skeptical, but ended up loving them and eating two.  Thanks for the recipe!

I took some reviews & advice and went a different route - spicy with the whole thing. I used 1 1/3 lb beef and 1 c. rice, and still had enough for only 4 bell peppers, which was fine for us. I chopped an onion, and browned with beef in the microwave, mixing the worcestershire in with those prior to cooking, due to some other comments. I added a can of drained Rotel to the beef/rice mix (in addition to the can of tomato sauce), plus cajun spices, tons of garlic salt, hot sauce, & half a bag of Mexi-cheese mix. I seasoned the tomato sauce topping with cajun spices & garlic salt instead of Italian spices, then topped with the other half of Mexi-cheese. Spicy and lots of flavor with these twists.

This turned out better than I thought it would! I was hesitant not to parboil the peppers, but I wanted to give the "cover with foil" method a shot! (we like tender peppers) I used instant brown rice which I cooked in the microwave. I also used a mixture of green, yellow, red & orange bell peppers! (they were on sale at Kroger) What a beautiful arrangement. Making the recipe as is with foil on top worked great. My only minor gripe is that there was no sauce to spoon over. (the topping stayed on top of the peppers- which was fine) Next time I will mix up another can of tomato sauce with a little brown sugar & water & pour this over the top before baking. (in addition to the recipe's topping) I wanted a recipe for under 300 calories- which is why I tried one. Another can of tomato sauce won't add many calories. Thanks so much for this recipe, Bonnie!

The recipe is different with the Worcestershire sauce.  I generally make my stuffed peppers meatloaf style and stuff the peppers with the raw meat mixture.  I like the addition of the rice, but it adds so many carbs I don't want to serve potatoes as a side dish like I usually do.  The benefits of this recipe are a slightly faster cooking time (particularly if the peppers are boiled for 10 minutes in lightly salted water prior to filling) and a very flexible filling that can be changed to accommodate whatever is available.  I didn't want to have to baste the peppers, so I put about 1/4 cup of water in the bottom of the casserole dish and covered it.  The peppers are moist and don't require any basting.

I truly enjoyed making this recipe. The rice and meat filling is so great, I almost couldn't resist eating it before I stuffed the peppers.

Absolutely Fabulous!  Very simple and delicious.  Better than it even sounds.  I added some additional italian spices to the rice & sausage mixture with a little cheese on top.

Fantastic! Being the inventive chef that I am, I decided to spice things up a little and added fresh olives, mushrooms and 1 jalapeno. Really added some kick to it. Also, used spaghetti sauce instead. The jalapeno really made the dish. If you are one for spicy foods, it's a definite keeper. But, if you have children, avoid it. Way too spicy for the lil'uns.

An easy and great recipe for stuffed peppers.  My husband and I really enjoyed.  I did make a couple of revisions though, instead of tomato sauce I used a jar of tomato and basil spaghetti sauce.  Then during the last 5 minutes of cooking I sprinkled the peppers w/mozzarella cheese. Wonderful!

I was in a rush and did not have the Italian seasoning or the Worcestershire sauce, so I used spaghetti sauce instead.  They turned out GREAT!  My 8 year old and 14 month old gobbled the filling right up!  I also did not baste them in the sauce, instead I poured the leftover spaghetti sauce on them after they came out of the oven.  I will definitely make this one again!!!

Hubby and I both loved this recipe, but the kids picked around the bell pepper and just ate the meat/rice mixture.  I added 1/2 can peeled and diced tomatoes to the meat/rice mixture. I followed some reviews and steamed the bell pepper halves in boiling water for 5 minutes before stuffing them. Afterward, I stuffed the bell peppers halves with the uncooked meat/rice/tomato mixture, and poured a layer of spaghetti sauce in the bottom of the 9x13 inch pan, then baked at 375 degrees for 1 hour 10 minutes, until no pink remained in the meat mixture.  Finally, I topped the peppers with shredded mozzarella cheese and baked another 10 minutes.  By baking the meat in the peppers instead of pre-cooking it, this allowed more time for the bell peppers to cook, thus softening the skins a little more.  Very nice blend of flavors.  Will definitely make again sometime.

Changed the process but everyone loved it, did the Best Spanish Rice recipe from this website with chopped onion & garlic. Blanched (1 each) red, green & yellow peppers, put in bottom of casserole topped with rice/meat, baked at 300 for 2 hours, added 1/2 cup more salsa and cheese last 15 min.  Too much filling for the peppers so just covered them using the peppers as the bottom layer.  RV cooking!

I too changed it up a bit...sauteed some garlic and 1 white onion then added some button mushroom and sundried tomatoes to the pan ..continued to saute all the veg then put it aside...i did brown the meat and precook the rice...i used jasmine rice.  Xtra Worcestershire gives it a great taste...did not blanch the peppers, or baste every 15 min,  just covered them and let the steam work its magic! Finish with cheese, yum!

This was really good and super easy to throw together. I used spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce mixture. I also topped it with cheddar cheese during the last 10 mins of cooking. I think next time I'll cut each pepper in half and add more sauce.

This is a great basic recipe!  Not sure what all the back and forth about boiling, covering, etc. in the reviews is about.  I followed the prep/cooking instructions, and I highly recommend you season to your personal taste.  The instructions are clear and make a really good finished product.  I had fun reading all the Reviews while they were in the oven.  I changed the spices up, added a little heat, but that's a normal part of being a home cook. If you don't already know, the easiest way to remove ribs is to scrape with a spoon.  Oh, and I had six large green bell peppers and this was sufficient to fill. They aren't super saucy, but they're moist and meaty as written. BDEGER, thanks for sharing!   Looks like a lot of people have tried and enjoyed these. Also a very budget friendly meal. There are some good reviewer tips about preparing ahead to make prep even easier. Try and enjoy!

I love this recipe, just tweaked it a little.before i started cooking meat i added about 4tbsp of butter nd sauted an onion with crushed garlic then added meat with all the ingredients but we like it with a little kick so i added 4-5 dashes of ground cayenne..also added a cup of water to the meat so it can be a little moist when i added my rice.also added colby cheese on the bottom nd between layers..covered with foil nd baked for about 1.5 hrs..no basting needed..PERFECT.

Great base recipe, but here's my version. Boiled peppers first for 2 minutes then allow to cool. Brown 1lb turkey w/ 1c chopped onion and 1tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp salt and pepper. I then added the suggested tomato sauce mixture and rice. After stuffing the peppers, the sauce seemed quite thick and didnt leave anything for me to baste with...not a problem. Baked for 45 mins covered then uncovered and topped with sharp cheddar the last 5 mins. They were so frikin good!!

I liked the recipe but I made it simpler by adding a can of Hunts Spaghetti Sauce. It is much easier without adding and cooking all the onions and garlic and such. I use the Italian but you can use any of your favorite spaghetti sauces. 
Plus I like mozzarella cheese on top. I add during the last few minutes of cooking so that it melts. Sometimes I put a little in the meat.

Absolutely delish!  I made just a couple of changes:  chopped onion, instead of onion powder and minced garlic, instead of garlic powder. The rest of the recipe was spot on. I might have added a pinch or two extra of something, but the base was perfect.  Thank you BDEGER

I made a couple changes based on the comments I read and it turned out great. 

I blanched the peppers first then used ground sausage instead of hamburger, tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and a little more rice. I cooked it covered in the oven so no basting was necessary and five or so minutes before it was done I added just a touch more sauce on the tops and then a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella on top.

I added about 1 cup of cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of corn and 1/3 cup of chopped onions (instead of onion powder) and my husband and I loved it. I also used red peppers because that's what I had from the garden. The flavor was great!

This turned out wonderfully!  I did blanch the peppers so there was no need to baste.  I simply covered with foil and baked.  Also, added parmesean cheese and used ground turkey vice ground beef.  I think the next time I make this I'm going to use other peppers to mix it up.

Absolutely delish, but as in all stuffed peppers, this calls for "too much peppers" when you leave them whole. The first time I made this recipe I diced my peppers into largish (not more than 1 in.) dices and mixed them all in together in a 10x13 pan. I followed the recipe in every other way. AMAZING!!

This was so easy and so good.  I used fresh green peppers from my garden.  I did add some cheddar cheese on top and let it melt after I took them out of the oven.

Amazing. I'd never had stuffed peppers before. I was very pleased with these. I monkeyed up the recipe a bit (didn't do the tomato sauce/Italian seasoning separately, and therefore had nothing to baste with), but they came out perfectly. They were a bit bland, so I'm thinking next time of putting some hot sauce in the mix, or perhaps some crushed red peppers, just for a little kick. OMNOMNOM, will make these again!

These are good, if not a little boring.  The recipe doesn't call for cheese, but some parmesan on top for the last 5-10 minutes of baking was much appreciated.  Also, if you blanch the peppers ahead of time, there is no need to baste to get tender peppers.

I made this for a potluck where the theme was vegetables that came from your garden. So easy, but it makes a great presentation and is SO delicious! I chopped up some onion and mushrooms and added that to the beef/rice mixture and everyone loved it! I had to cut a small bit from the bottom of each green pepper so that they would stand up straight, so I put a slice of tomato in the bottom of each of them and it held the mixture in the pepper and also added a bit of a surprise at the end!

Halved the recipe.  Blanched the peppers, browned the hamburger and cooked the rice ahead of time.  Folded Thai basil and parmesan cheese into the filling which added a lot more depth of flavor.  Also did not do any basting and cooked for only 20 minutes.  Very good though definitely deviated from the original recipe.

this was delicious!  I browned a pound of ground turkey, threw in onions and tons of minced garlic, then added a spicy marinara, with chopped yellow bell peppers, rice, italian seasoning, cooked it for twenty minutes, then put it in a square glass baking dish.  i covered the bottom with the filling and then filled four big peppers, covered with lid, baked it for an hour, and then added the cheese before serving.  DELISH!

Loved it. Made this for dinner for myself and my parents. Made a few changes: ground turkey instead of beef, a variety of pepper colors, cheese on top, and a change of sauce. We didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 spaghetti sauce, and no italian seasoning, and the result was great. My Dad especially enjoyed it, said it reminded him of his childhood, and his mother's cooking. Very happy with this recipe!

I was really not impressed with this recipe, it seemed bland to me. Wont be making it again. I even added additional worcestershire sauce, and sauteed the meat with onion.. and it was still bland. I tried making it twice, and will have to find a different recipe. Bummer since 6 bell peppers and meat are not the cheapest :/

Loved this recipe by far one of the easiest ones I've ever followed. I would like to add that I do add cheese to the mix, when you've made your meat and rice mixture with the sauces and seasonings, I take some shreded cheese and put it in the pepper, then some mix, then some cheese then file the rest with mix, and about 5 minutes before its finished in the oven I will pull it out and add cheese to the top. Just a suggestion.

Delicious! I dreaded stuffed pepper as a child, but as an adult I've had such a craving. These are absolutely wonderful! My husband (who is quite fussy) loves these also! I make them almost every week; they are such a hit!

Really enjoyed the stuffed peppers! The only thing that I can think of is that I didnt really care for the texture of the peppers...i added 2 stalks of celery and 3 scallions to the mixture as well...

I used brown rice instead of white (due to my family's diet). I also have a tin for extra large muffins which was the PERFECT size to hold the peppers upright. As they cooked, they sagged slightly to fill the shape at the bottom of the tin. They retained this shape after cooking, so they stood up perfectly on the plate. With the addition of some cheese, this dish even managed to charm the picky 8 year old!

This was excellent!  I used quinoa for the rice and chicken sausage for the beef, I also used red bell pepper instead of green and I covered with foil.  This had great flavor, at least with the sausage!!  This will be on regular rotation at our house!

This was a great dish, however, I recommend adding a bit of a favorite spicy sauce to it. Not so much to actually make it spicy, but to enhance the flavor a little bit, especially if your not working with the best tomato sauce. It helped our dish out an extra star's worth.

This recipe lacked some flavor. I guess its good if you don' like any real spice to your meal. My grandparents would love it... easy on the stomach. If i was o remake this, I would probably mix in some salsa or rotel to give it a little kick. Maybe I'll add some velveeta too. That would be good.

This was a good recipe however, I made some moderate changes. I put my bellpeppers on the grill separately in aluminum foil  with cut up portabella mushrooms, seasoning, and butter for about 20 minutes. I then made the stuffing using a 6 oz can of tomato paste instead. I didn't add worcestershire sauce. I added mixed cheese into my stuffing and then put it in the bell peppers and put them in the oven for 20 minutes. GREAT!

This was my first time making & eating stuffed peppers & it was delicious, the whole famioly enjoyed, which is rare.  The only change I made was instead of tomato sauce, I added a can of italian styled diced tomatoes.  I did still pour some tomato sauce over them before putting them into the oven and covered with foil while baking.  Last 5 minutes I took it off, added a little extra sauce and parm cheese and let it go.  It was a big hit!

Really good!1  The only thing I did was throw the peppers in some boiling water for a few minutes ( I like my peppers done) and instead of tomato sauce I used diced tomatoes..Turned out awesome..will be making again!

These are as good as it gets!  This was one of my very favourites when I was a kid.  I am giving it a five based on how I would have expected them to taste if I had followed the recipe and used GREEN peppers.  But I only had red and yellow peppers and their sweetness was a bit much with the tomato sauce sweetness.  The green would have been PERFECT with the filling!

A huge hit for dinner! Made with brown rice instead of white and topped with mozzarella cheese during the last few minutes of baking! I baked peppers in the oven raw and came out PERFECT! Baked for about 40 minutes.

This was excellent! I had 4 large peppers in my fridge and I had heard of stuffed peppers before but never had them. I lucked out and picked an excellent recipe. I used whole grain rice instead of white. I also added some italian sausage seasoning to it. Baked it about 15 minutes longer because my peppers were large and I wanted them soft. My 4 year old devoured this! It was yummy and easy to make!

looks great.  i am making them now, however, the photo shows cheese and there is no cheese listed in the ingredients.  It looks like parmesan...?   I'll try that and see how it goes.

These were very good! I did make a few changes (it seems like a lot but most are small): 1) I made the rice in my rice cooker and doubled the amount 2) I browned the ground beef with 4 cloves chopped garlic 3) Used garlic and herb spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato (and used a lot more than 8 ounces) 4) Added shredded cheddar to the meat mixture 5) Cut the peppers in half lengthwise - made a "bowl" that I could mound filling on. 6) Boiled the peppers for 10 minutes and them submerged in ice water before stuffing 7) Added extra of the seasonings called for 8) Didn't baste - and during the last 10 minutes I sprinkled with more shredder cheddar.

I followed some suggestions from others...boiling the peppers before and putting on the cheeses 10 minutes prior to pulling from the oven.  I also added corn to the mixture but held Italian seasonging.  One of the best recipes for stuffed peppers I have found yet!

This was pretty good. I added cheese at the end. The peppers were a little tough, I may try the boiling suggestion next time. Also, I added parmasan cheese to the mixture.

Great recipe...I made it for another couple and they loved it. I actually forgot the rice...I know right!!! But it was still great. I didn't cook the meat before hand; I actually used venison instead of beef and it was a lot more lean and made the peppers really moist.  Next time i will make sure to add the rice.

I find these are better if you use 3 cans of Tomato Soup, not Tomato Sauce and I don't cook the meat before putting into the peppers. If you don't cook the meat beforehand, they remain in a ball and stick together better.  I also cut the peppers in half sideways and lay them flat, and it makes a lot more peppers.

The only thing different that I did on this receipe was to add one cup of cheese to the mix, and then about 10 minutes before it was done, I topped them with more cheese.  It was a very tasty..my husband even loved them, and he is extremely hard to please. Would definitely make this again.

I just finished eating these. I did Red, yellow and orange peppers and used sausage meat with whole grain brown rice. I added an egg and also some cheese while the meat and rice was in the pan together. Tastes Awesome and will def. make again.

The classic. I used brown rice and added a tsp red curry paste (It was in the fridge. I gotta use it up sooner or later!) instead of the italian seasoning/onion pwdr/garlic pwdr. It turned out just like my mom made when we were growing up. Maybe I didn't stir the curry paste in enough? Ha ha if it's in a clump thats going to be a surprise!

I love stuffed peppers and I liked the simplicity of the recipe.  However, the next time I make stuffed peppers, I will experiment more.  When I made these, I was pushed for time and did not have an opportunity to experiment much.  I will take some tips from the other raters and add cheese and more tomato sauce.  I will definitely keep this recipe and tweak it.  It's a keeper :-)

mmmmmmm! I'd never even eaten a stuffed pepper before, but now I can make them! They look beautiful, lots of color, and taste amazing! I used bison meat which added to the sweetness of the peppers. Thank you for this recipe!

Very Good! i did boil some water, then add the peppers and boiled them for 10 minutes.  I always do that when i make stuffed peppers it makes a HUGE difference in softness.  I did feel like something was missing. i thought maybe next time i would add some shredded cheese in the beef and rice mixture.

This recipe is good for a quick dinner but, is better if you brown the beef and use fresh onions and garlic. also fresh parsley. I prefer some diced tomatoes in the sauce and cheese on top. Use your imagination for this one!

Needed more seasoning and flavor.  Bell Peppers burned on the edges before getting tender enough to eat.  Maybe if there was more sauce to baste with??

I did not cook the rice.  I added it to the beef mixture,stuffed the peppers - then added water to the bottom of the pan.  I covered it with foil and increased the cooking time a few minutes.

Delicious!  1st time making stuffed peppers. I noticed the picture has what looks like melted cheese on top.  So even though the recipe didn't call for it - I sprinkled on some the last 10min of cooking. Also used 1/2 italian diced tomatoes.

I thought this recipe was just awful!  The peppers were hard (despite being cooked for an hour) and the stuffing had no taste whatsoever!  I was thoroughly disappointed in this recipe and in the fact that I had to waste all that time and food making them!

These were very good, and easy to make! I found like other reviewer's that the sauce was too thick to really baste. I also got an extra can so there would be enough at the bottom. I used fresh onion and pepper and they tasted great.

Very good!  I had a bunch of green peppers from my garden, and this was perfect!  I sauteed some chopped onions, garlic and jalapeno before cooking the ground beef.  I mixed that together with some fresh chopped basil, oregano and parsley, before adding some of the tomato sauce.  My husband kept coming back for more.

I read some of the posts about the stuffing being bland, and opted to mix in a small can of tomatoes and green chilies. Turned out to be a good call.    Also it was my first time stuffing peppers, I was thinking there would be juices leaking out of the peppers to baste with, not so.  Save out some sauce to spoon over for the basting.

These just really didn't work for me.  I followed the instructions, but I expected the peppers to be more tender.  I couldn't cut them with a fork, had to use a knife.  Don't plan on making them again.

Not bad, I was afraid of them being too dry so I poured in a lot more tomato sauce than required and continued basting with tomato sauce while the peppers were in the oven. For extra flavor, I also baked the peppers with the tops on!

This was my first time making stuffed peppers, and they came out pretty good.  I only had four peppers on hand, and since some reviewers said they ran out of filling before all six peppers were stuffed, I thought I'd be okay with the four.  I ended up having extra, so I'd recommend sticking with the six peppers as directed.

These were sooo yummy! Even though I'm sure they would've turned out just as great without any changes, I did make some adjustments. I also blanched the peppers for 2 minutes like suggested by other reviewers. I cooked the rice in chicken broth, I only used one can of tomato sauce and I added 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese to the filling. I covered the pan with aluminum foil and didn't use any extra sauce or baste the peppers. I used up all the filling on three peppers, but that was enough for my family. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!

This was by far the easiest recipe for stuffed peppers! The only change I made was adding a can of stewed tomatoes to an onion and garlic mixture. I put that in the pepper before we baked it! It added a nice sweet touch later!

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was scrumptulescent! It was easier than other stuffed pepper recipes. I made the stuffing ahead of time, which was nice. I used ground pork instead of beef, and put shredded cheese(monterey jack & mozz) in the mixture as another reviewer recommended. I also put cherry tomatoes around the peppers in the pan, and they were a great, juicy addition. I didn't use worstershire, though..

This is a great recipe.  I made a few changes to give it some extra flavor.

First, I used red peppers instead of green.  Just a personal preference.

When I browned the beef, I also added chopped onion and chopped garlic.  I then seasoned the beef with a pinch of italian seasoning, garlic powder, and pepper.  I used tomato paste instead of sauce and thinned it out with beer and chicken broth.  I also squeezed in two limes to the stuffing when it was finished.

I used the remaining tomato paste for the topping which I thinned out with beer and chicken broth as well.  I layered in the tomato topping as I filled the peppers instead of just pouring it over the top.

Ok, I did what other member suggested and covered with foil.  They came out perfect!  Also, I' m a vegetarian and my family is not so i used the meatless sausage you can get in a roll, I used two rolls.  Topped with cheese and nobody could get enough!
Thanks great recipe!

I cut the recipe in half because it was just my husband and me.  I thought it was a little dry though, it might need more tomato sauce.  I also topped them with a little cheese.

I parboil the peppers for 5 minutes in boiling water before stuffing, especially when they are a thick skinned pepper.  I also sauted some onion and the chopped tops of the peppers and added that to the mixture.  Real excellent recipe.  I like to eat it with a side of cottage cheese.

I love this recipe. I altered it so my son will not have the option of throwing the pepper off to the side. I use only one can of tomato sauce and dice up the peppers. I also use Red, yellow, orange and some green peppers. I have to cook it about 1 1/2 hours, but it is AWESOME. The Italian seasoning really flavors it well. Growing up my mom always used American cheese on her peppers, so I top with about 1-2 slices per serving. This has become my son's favorite AND he loves the peppers!! (When the peppers were whole, he always tossed the pepper and ate only the mixture.)

I give this one a five!  Made these for dinner last week.  To the ground beef I added a packet of low sodium taco seasoning.  Gave it more of a bite and extra flavor.  While ground beef was browing, I added in one small vidalia onion diced and two cloves of minced garlic.  I prefer the real over the powdered.  I too, added extra sauce.  Instead of two cans of tomato sauce, I used three.  I put two in with the rice mixture, and used the third to top each pepper.  I also added a touch of shredded jack/cheddar cheese.  Oh, and before I forget, I also blanched my peppers in boiling water for about 3 minutes to soften a touch.

Fiance had never had stuffed peppers before, and he has requested I make them again very soon!  Great recipe, quick and easy dinner!

This is the first tiome I have ever made stuffed peppers. I thought this recipe was a great starting point. I made a few changes, I used half hamburger and half sausage also added corn. I added a dash of brown sugar and chopped onin would have used garlic cloves but I was all out. Instead of green peppers I used red.

These were fantastic! I altered the cooking style a little by browning onion and garlic, then browning the meat, draining, and simmering the beef mixture with rice, sauce, worchestire, various spices from the cabinet and 1/2 c. water. I was in a rush, so it only simmered for 15 minutes, and after blanching the peppers (i left them in the boiling water for about 3-4 mins), i filled them, topped with parm cheese and a little sauce, and baked for about 45 minutes. I did a side of spaghetti, and my husband absolutely loved them, said it was a great change from our everyday meals.

Great recipe followed through or a fantastic base to add to your liking (did both, added can of petite-cut tomatoes and reduced water by half). I covered with foil during cooking to cut down on cooking time and it still cooked the peppers to tender.

I didn't eat them because I hate bell peppers but my boyfriend who absolutely adores bell peppers said they were "ok".  For the amount of time and effort they took, I would never make them again.

Very Tasty, I did blanche my peppers before stuffing. I also used Beef broth instead of water to cook my rice, for a more beefy taste.  Will make again thanks for the recipe

I changed a few things and my family loved it, including my three year old!  I made 4 servings (well 4 peppers), and since we all prefer red ones, I bought those.  I doubled the recipe to accommodate two lbs of meat.  We had probably enough for 5 peppers, but we really needed the extra.  I tripled the Worcestershire sauce to 3 tbs and cooked the Italian seasoning right in. I also used minced 2 tbs of garlic instead of powder. I mixed everything in but the rice while I browned the beef, then at the end added the rice and sauce. 
 
I covered the peppers in the oven with aluminum foil and only cooked them for 30 min total (25 + 5 to melt the cheese).  The only cheese I had was that Kraft Mexican mix grated- perfect.  I might add that next time into the browning stage for a more cheesy flavor.  

I had headed a few reviewers and boiled the peppers for 2 min and then put them in ice water before baking.  I used instant rice and cooked it before hand with min water.  The peppers stayed firm and tasted great. This will be a staple in our house.

I make these all of the time and they are a hit! I get the italian ground turkey, so it's already preseasoned, and I add cheese to the top of everyone when 10 min is left on the clock.

I loved this recipe. The only changes I made was that I mixed 1 lb of ground Sweet Italian Sausage in with the ground beef, I added 1 jar of Sauce in the casserole pan so I wouldn't have to baste and I added shredded mozzerella cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking. These were a hit on 4th of July!

I must have missed something. The recipe did not say to cover while baking, so I did not. It also said to baste every 15 minutes..... uncovered there was nothing to bast with. I poured a little water on the filling and into the dish, but the peppers ended up being undercooked and somewhat dry, and the meat fell apart upon cutting the pepper. Good flavor to the meat and sauce, but something is way wrong with the technique.

I made this the other night with some changes. As I don't have "Italian Seasoning" I just used what I had handy, Basil, Thyme, Oregano. Also I boiled the peppers for 3 minutes, I also topped mine with mozorella cheese the last 5 or so minutes of cooking.. My husband said these were the BEST I ever made. Thanks Boonie!

pretty good. I covered with cheese as well, and because my mom would never let me throw out perfectly good peppers, i diced up the tops of the peppers and added that to my mixture. I also added some crushed hot peppers. Next time I think I will add even more--we like it spicy:)

These were OK. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I will definately make some changes. After the peppers being in the oven for an hour, they were still a bit crunchy. I would suggest pre-baking them in the oven for 20 mins before stuffing with the beef/rice mixture! Next time I will sautee onion with the beef and add more tomato sauce to baste the tomatoes in as there was nowhere near enough and it ended up burning to the oven dish. Overal, they were "OK".

Really great recipe for a busy weeknight if you make the meat mixture ahead of time. You could probably even make a large batch and freeze in portions. I used brown rice and added some crushed red pepper for a little kick. All I had to do that night was blanch my peppers for 10 mins, stuff 'em and bake 'em.

These were so good! I was a little nervous because I have never done stuffed peppers and no one in the family particularly likes green peppers. But the were a total hit! Everyone gobbled them up! Even my brother, who doesn't like anything (especially anything with vegetables), LOVED them!! We are going to make this recipe part of our regular rotation.

I use red pepper, because I like the flavor better. It adds a little spice. Also, I cook my rice half way beforehand and cover when baking. I go light on the Italian seasoning and add a bit of crushed pepper for more of a Spanish flare.

I used Italian Sausage, onion soup mix, and topped these off with sour cream and dill. They turned out fantastic although I prefer using red peppers to green. I will definitely make again.

i made some modifications to this. First, I always use ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I also used 1 cup of instant rice to 1 cup of water, and I cooked it separately. I added chopped onion when I browned the turkey. I also used 4 large peppers, but I should've only used three because they weren't completely stuffed. Also, when I mixed the turkey with the rice, and other stuff I added a lot of other seasonings, like italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion salt, crushed red pepper, and more ground black pepper. I also added parmesan cheese in with that mix. I boiled the peppers for about 8 minutes. This was too long, maybe only 5. O ran cold water over them afterwards. I topped them with the tomato sauce and italian seasoning (didn't seem like enough sauce), and also more parmesan cheese. I covered the pan with aluminum foil and I baked for 20 minutes. They turned out really well. I really think I could've baked for 15 minutes. I was pleased, and my husband loved them. :) a 5 with my modifications.

This was fantastic!  I added fresh onion and a can of diced tomatoes with chiles to this and it came out very well.  Some suggestions: Try not to pack the meat so the tomato sauce gets in there, it gets a bit overwhelming when going for seconds.  Also cook rice beforehand, even after 30 minutes it hadnt cooked all the way.

Fabulous! Even if they are a little time consuming, these stuffed peppers are phenomenal. We even got the kids to eat them! Sort of like a cabbage roll in a pepper. A little saucy though, but otherwise very good.

It's hard to fairly rate this as I altered it quite a bit as well.  I used brown rice and sausage and I blanched the peppers first, plus I used some leftover homemade tomato sauce.  I steamed them for the first 1/2 hour or so using some tin foil, then poured a little balasmic vinegar into the pan and sprinkled the peppers with some grated Parmesan for the last ten minutes or so of steaming.  Came out nice and moist with a good texture to the peppers, but could have used a tiny bit more zing.  Next time I may add some more garlic or maybe some jalapenos.  Excellent basic starting point, though!  Am looking forward to perfecting my own version of this.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The first time I made them several months ago, my boyfriend told not to loose it.  I use sirloin burger in mine.  I brown it first, drain the grease, then I chop up jalepano slices in my food processor, and pour the jalepano's and crushed red pepper into my meat as I am adding the other ingredients.  This is a great option if you like your food hot.

This was the first time I've ever made stuffed peppers. It was an easy recipe, but it definately needs more flavor. The texture was good. I made it exactly as posted. I would add more spices next time. Maybe even use a maranara or flavored spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce.

This is definitely a keeper! I only made a few of changes: I used 5 peppers instead of 6 and also substituted 1/4 cup chopped onion instead of the onion powder. I ran a little short on the tomato sauce for the last basting so I just used some spaghetti sauce I had in the fridge. Last few minutes of cooking I added fresh grated parmesan cheese and some shredded mozzarella to the the tops of the peppers. YUMMY! Thanks for sharing!

Filling was pretty tasty. However, the peppers did not produce enough liquid to become tenderized. I think that this recipe should include more liquid.

I love this! I added canned parmesan cheese to the rice mixture and topped it with fresh parmesan. I also added oregano and old bay seasoning. I put enough of the rice picure in the bottom so we could have the rice as a side. Also wonderful with garlic bread to enhance the meal. My boyfriends already requests some more of this in the near future. Will make it for pot luck dishes in the future. THANKS!!!

I haven't made stuffed peppers in years. For this recipe, I used a wild rice mix instead of long grain and I boiled it with a beef boullion for some added flavour. I used the exact same spices and everything came out quite tasty. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was the cooking time. At 350, for an hour, the peppers were still a little crispy so I had to turn up the heat to 425 and added another 15 minutes in the oven. Also, I had prepped the beef and rice so by the time it was ready to go into to oven it was cool and after 350 for an hour, the insides were only warm. Could be my oven, but I doubt it. So the next time, I'd stick to the recipe the same except change my cooking tempuratures and times to suite my oven. 350 didn't work for me. My boyfriend loved them. He ate 3!!

I think this recipe is a great example of how useful peppers are. The diversity of this fabulous vegetable means that any dish can be served with or within itself. This wonderful recipe also brings out the true potential of this vegetable and has motivated me to use it in more dishes and even produce some recipes of my own.

thank you bonnie for such an excellent dish.

Very easy to make and very good. I changed it a little by addeing 2/3 cup bread crumbs and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. I also parboiled the peppers, so the bake time was reduced by 20 minutes.

The serving size is more like 4 large green peppers.

Also added more spices than recipe called for. Flavor was okay. Could use more sauce.

This is a very good stuffed pepper recipe!  It's not as saucy as some recipes I've tried and I really like that. I added a little bit more garlic powder than the recipe called for, but I imagine it really depends on how much garlic flavor you like. This one is a keeper for sure.

I added a touch of Parmesan and Mozzrella cheese to the top just before they were done.  Let the cheese melt and brown to give this already great recipe a new highlight.

We really enjoyed these.  The only thing I did different was I just cut the bell peppers in half, filled each half with the mixture then used an extra can of tomato sauce with brown sugar mixed with it and spread on top of the mixture, no basting required when you do it this way.

Good recipe after a bit of tweaking. I blanched my peppers for about 4 minutes first, and sprinkled a bit of salt into them. Also, I added a lot more seasoning to the meat mixture and used half ground beef half ground sausage. I stuffed the bottom of each pepper with cheese, & melted some on top after they were done cooking. I also doubled the sauce. Thanks Bonnie, I'll be making these again.

These were good, but needed a little something. I layered the peppers with Monterey Jack cheese with jalapenos, the mixture, the cheese, the mixture, the cheese, etc. This gave it alot more flavor and some heat.

WWWWOOOOWWWW!!!! I have never made or even eaten stuffed green peppers before, but MAN these are good!!! Suprised everyone and made them for dinner one evening, and the hugs and raves wouldn't stop! I ommitted the worchester sauce though, since my mom is ill, it would have bothered her stomach too much. Still incredible though.

Awesome!  Added cheese to half of them to try it both ways.  We all liked the cheese ones most.  Doubled the recipe (except bell peppers) and it was exactly enough to fill them completely full with no leftovers.  Covered with tinfoil for 55 minutes then added cheese for the last 5 minutes.  Next time I will blanche the peppers as recommended by others.

This recipe was great!  I added chopped onion and garlic instead of powder, as others have suggested.  I also used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce.  I just add it straight from the can, and pour over a little more, heated, just before serving.  It adds a nice flavor, sweeter than the tomato sauce!

My stuffed peppers are similar to these, but before baking them I top each one with ketchup (it's better than it sounds) and then place a thick slice of cheddar cheese on top of that.  I bake them covered for 45 minutes, and uncovered for another 15 minutes.

This is a wonderful and tastey recipe.  I added extra spices because my family likes things a little spicier.  It was easy to make & was very very good.  Even my 2 yr. old son loved it.

I fondly remember stuffed green peppers from my childhood, and this recipe hit it dead on!  I loved it!  I agree with the others about adding more tomato sauce, and there isn't enough to baste.  But it was delicious!

Read the reviews before cooking.  I boiled the peppers for 3 minutes before stuffing.  I modified the filling with prepared spaghetti sauce and more spices, they still were a little to bland for me.  Will be more heavy handed with the spices next time.  Also, they took longer than an hour to cook more like a hour and half.

I throughly enjoyed this recipe.  Easy to prepare and a good comfort food.  This was the first time I prepared the filling with uncooked chop meat and found that the meat/filling tasted much better.  VERY SATISIFYING!!!!! :)

the peppers needed to cook more before putting them in the oven, maybe boiling them first would make them a little more tender

This came out so yummy. I microwaved for about 8 mins and finished for about 25 or 30 mins in the oven to speed up the overall cooking time.

Good simple recipe. I would recommend getting another pepper or two and including it in the beef/rice mixture. I would also recommend adding mozzarella cheese over the top, after the tomato sauce/Italian seasoning mixture.

I made this without rice and doubled the recipe. Didn't have 2 pounds of ground beef so used 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of sausage. I did not brown the meat before stuffing the peppers.  I used red and orange peppers for color and because I don't like green peppers. I also covered with foil because I like the peppers to be very soft. This is a great recipe that you can tweak to your liking.

so I read a bunch of reviews and decided to use Turkey instead, and used double Worcestershire and a little Tabasco for added flavor. I added diced onion as well.  I cooked it covered so I didn't need to baste. I also added a little cheese on top the last 5 min. came out very good. dialing this recipie in.

I have made this three times.  It is now  my go to recipe for stuffed peppers.  I don't use onion powder or garlic powder.  So, I minced half an onion and a clove of garlic which I sautéed until the onion was soft before adding to the meat mixture.  Other that than, I followed the recipe.   Love it!

I parboiled the peppers as several reviewers suggested and I ended up being irritable about it—the peppers were full of water and mushy and had to be halved lengthwise because they wouldn’t “stand up”. So, bad suggestion. Otherwise, I browned the meat and used fresh  chopped onion and garlic (why use powders???) , then drained. I then put the uncooked rice (I used 1 cup), spices and Worcestershire sauce, a can of crushed tomatoes, and a cup plus a few splashes of chicken broth (instead of water) in the saucepan with a lid and cooked until the rice was done.  I did not see a need to use another pot to cook the rice first. At the end, I added about a cup of cheddar cheese and mixed, then stuffed the peppers. Then I poured tomato sauce on top before  I sprinkled Parmesan on them and baked them for about 30 minutes. 
I took them out, sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top then broiled for about 5 minutes. 
I have never made stuffed peppers before, but my family loved these! I will add that I had a 2.3lb pkg of meat, so my mixture was more than enough to stuff 12 halves, with some of the meat mixture left over.
We served this with a fresh loaf of baked bread and butter. Prep time for the peppers is fairly labor intensive. This is not a quick dish, but was worth the time.

Excellent recipe. Very filling, and made a lot of peppers. I combined 1/2lb Italian Sausage with 1/2lb beef and it added a different dimension to the flavor.

I changed things up a bit.  I use quinoa instead of rice.  I also bar-boiled the peppers for 5 minutes. I also added fresh onions and mushrooms to the mixture before putting it into the pepper and went from 1/4 teaspoon for the onion and garlic powder to 1/2 teaspoon and then covered with foil.

We love this recipe. It is so easy and delicious. My kids eat it, but I don't waste the peppers on my boys, since they wouldn't eat them. I put theirs in silicone muffin cups and cook along side ours. I will say, I cook mine in the crock pot on low for ~2.5-3 hours, till the peppers are done. So easy. My husband raves about them. If you like spicy, try adding 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper to the mixture!

I made this after reading the comments. So, I blanched the bell peppers before placing in the baking dish, used a clove of garlic instead of garlic powder, a half of a small red onion instead of onion power, and topped with shredded cheddar. Delish. Only thing I will do differently next time is season the beef. Husband loved it. Said he could eat it everyday.

this is a great base recipe. I have used it many times, and altered it each time, with great results.  Quicker for me to add Italian seasoning.  fresh onion and garlic to meat browning in pan, add Worcestershire and rice when meat is drained. I always cover pan tightly with foil, to steam the peppers as the dish bakes. Remove foil after 1 hour, sprinkle with cheese (parm or mozzarella) and cook 5 min. I also always use a full jar ( 25 oz) of sauce, reserving half to warm and pour over top before serving. It's the way my family likes it, and easy.

I took advice from another fellow cook on here and blanched the peppers. They came out perfect texture was great! May try again with pepper jack cheese instead of mozzarella.

Used the basic recipe but added sweet sausage and onions to mix. Cut the peppers in half and filled them.  Added cheddar/jack cheese to tops and used broiler to melt cheese.

Awesome recipe! I did as someone else said, and blanched my peppers and it was super good! Since they were blanched I cut the cooking time in half and they turned out perfect! I also covered them in cheese ??

These are delicious!  I prefer red peppers so I used them and orange (my husband's favorite) instead of green.  I would STRONGLY suggest using 1 lb. of Italian sausage out of its casing instead of ground beef.  It has much more flavor.  I also covered the peppers in the oven with foil and sprinkled some grated cheese on the top for the last 5 minutes as some other reviewers suggested.

Never made these before and wanted to try something new.  My husband and I loved it!  At first I thought the rice was not going to be enough but yup.  I did boil the peppers first, next time I'll roast them first.  I added some canned, chopped chipolte chiles in adobe sauce to the ground beef that I had leftover from another recipe and some cayenne pepper for a little heat, yum!  Will make again.

I liked this recipe. I messed up and had tomato soup instead of sauce but it worked out fine. I also used taco seasoning instead of the garlic powder and onion powder. That wasn't necessarily the best idea. It made it a bit too sweet for my taste. So next time I will stick directly to this recipe.

I altered the recipe just a bit. I added some sugar to the tomato sauce to make less tart, I sauteed chopped sweet onions with the ground beef and I added some canned diced tomatoes to sauce. I kept tasting the sauce until I got the spices exactly where I wanted them. 
Also, I wrapped each pepper in aluminium foil while baking them. I kept them moist and the basting juices were able to be sprinkled into the finished product.

I used turkey burger instead and I cooked onion with it instead of adding onion powder. I also used garlic & herb no salt seasoning.  I also 1/2 the peppers in put them in a 13x9 pan.. It made about 11 peppers. And I covered the peppers with tin foil. The last 5 minutes I removed and lightly sprinkled with cheddar cheese. It was DELICIOUS!! My husband loved them!

Make it ahead and pop in the oven when you get home!  This was good!  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand, so I substituted a can of Hunt's Garlic & Herb Spaghetti Sauce, to which I added 2 Tbsp. Worcestershire and 2 Tbsp. brown sugar.  I did cook and drain the beef first.  I did not blanch the peppers.  MAKE AHEAD: I put everything together earlier in the day and placed in the fridge. When it was time to cook, I pulled the dish (covered with foil) out of the fridge and cooked for about 50-55 minutes. The peppers were just done enough - not mushy and not too crunchy. My family (including two teenage girls) told me to save this one!

Fantastic!! The only thing I did differently was  book the hollowed peppers for 8 minutes before filling them. I also used cheddar cheese and poured a layer of sauce in between layers of beef/rice stuffing and on top. Yummy!

I really liked this recipe for the most part, however I used all colors of bells and each had a little different flavor.I also cooked my rice first but did not cook the meat until I put in oven.The only thing I added was some finely diced fresh tomatoes from our garden and that added a lot of freshness. did not precook bells,I just covered with foil and baked for approx.40minutes,removed foil added parmesan cheese and cooked until lightly browned****

This is a very good recipe, But I added pine nuts and diced onions, garlic minced, and diced celery, I also added extra basil and additional Worcestershire sauce and Italian seasoning, Julianne carrots maybe good in it also. may like to beat one egg and add to the meat mixture prior to filling peppers.

Great recipe! I did sautee diced onion with hamburger while browning. I add 1 cup crushed saltines to the beef mixture because my husband doesn't like rice. Mixed 1 8oz can tomato sauce and a couple tablespoons of catsup in beef and added 1/2 cup each parmesan and shredded cheddar. I didn't blanch the peppers.Cover 1/2 way through cooking.Huge hit! :)

This is a great recipe...sometimes I vary and make them with sloppy joe sauce instead of the tomatoes etc...then you need very little extra seasonings..gives it a great flavor...I also like to use brown rice........also I put mine in a muffin pan with a little water in each place and then place the pepper in the tin......works great!

I have tried for years to find a good recipe for Stuffed Peppers and this is it. My husband does not like peppers but loves the stuffing with the flavor of peppers. We fought like children over the leftovers. This is by far the BEST recipe I have ever cooked. I even cooked them up twice in the same week!!!

I actually simplified this TREMENDOUSLY. And I absolutely LOVED it!!! I did everything the same, except I omitted the tomato sauce, worcester sauce, and extra seasonings. I did everything the same way like the recipe says as far as preparing the meat and green peppers. All I did to change the recipe was use mexican rice and added mozzarella cheese on top of the bell peppers. This is the way that we love eating stuffed peppers and it is the way we will eat it again and again and again! :)

This recipe seemed doomed for failure from the beginning due to my inattention...but it turned out great! I wanted to use some leftover rice but didn't have quite enough, so I added onions and the pepper tops to the ground beef as it browned, hoping they would take up some of the space that extra rice would incorporate. Then I goofed up and added the Italian seasoning to the beef mixture instead of the tomato sauce. I decided to add 1/4 tsp. Italian seasoning and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder to the sauce anyway to pour over the tops of the peppers. I also didn't baste...there was nothing to baste with! At the end of the cooking time, I topped the peppers with some mozzarella cheese. These turned out delicious!

I liked this recipe alot.  I cut the peppers in half and stuffed them in 1/2s in case someone didnt want a whole pepper.  I covered tight with foil and baked them that way without blanching.  thanks

I made this tonight and thought it was very good.  I gave 4 stars because I made a few changes due to personal taste. Upped the garlic and onion powders.  I thought the beef was a bit too dry, so used 1` 1/2 tins tomato sauce.  Didn't top with sauce, but added shredded sharp cheddar a few minutes before it was done.  I'll make this again.

I used this recipe and found it a great basic. I did microwave the peppers prior for 2-3 minutes to soften. I used a sautéed onion instead of onion powder. Used mushroom pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce and added the Italian seasoning directly to the meat/rice mixture. Some chili flakes added a nice bit of heat! I chose not to cover and baste with the other half of tomato sauce, but I'm sure it would be very good

Good recipe. I recommend choosing medium size peppers and spicing up the basting sauce.

This was a good base recipe as others stated. To make it 5 stars, I doubled the onion and garlic powder and added a little extra dash of Worcestershire. I didn't have any italian seasoning so instead I got the tomato sauce w/oregano & basil. Add a little shredded parmesan cheese into the mixture and some shredded cheddar on top of peppers (after adding remaining sauce). Place about 1/2 c water in the bottom of the baking dish and cover with foil and bake for 35 mins to cut down cooking time and no need to baste. Also, it only made 4 large peppers and not 6 as the recipe states.

I topped it with cheese and used brown rice instead.  This meal was very tasty.  One of the best I've gotten from this website.  Thanks for sharing!

I just used this recipe as a base and did my own thing.....I cut the peppers long ways in half and just used 3, then layed them out in a casserole dish; cooked the hamburger with all the spices except W sauce, also used minced onion and a tiny sprinkle of onion powder.  Then I filled the halves with the hamburger (added the W sauce after it cooled a tiny bit), sprinkled a small amount of uncooked rice over each one and put the rest of the rice (up to one cup) in the bottom of the casserole and covered with a large can of crushed tomatoes and 2 very small cans of tomato juice.  Cover with tin foil and cook up to 2 hours or until the rice is cooked and the peppers are tender.  My hubby loved it!

Made this recipe today and it was delicious! I did have some modifications though...used diced onions instead of powder, orange and yellow bell peppers instead of green and instead of rice, I used quinoa for more texture.  Forgot to add the Worcestershire sauce but it still tasted wonderful.  Will definitely be making this again!

Made these for supper and followed recipe almost to the T.  They were fabulous.  Only change I made was to season burger as I browned it.  Added onion and garlic, pepper and a pinch of salt.  Thanks, will be making this again and again.

My first try with a stuffed pepper recipe and it was delicious. I may add more of the seasonings next time though since the pepper itself is not flavored. I used ground turkey instead of beef and added cheese on top of the peppers during the last 15 minutes of cooking. My fiancee really liked this dish and it's pretty healthy when pairing it with a side salad.

Love this recipe but I did make some changes.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I used brown rice instead of white rice and I didn't use the worcestershire suace because I didn't have any and they still turned out great!!.  I also boiled the peppers first to decrease time in the oven and I covered them so there was no need to baste them. I added the second can of tomato sauce in the mixture since I didn't need to use it for basting.  I added mozz cheese during the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  My entire family loved these.  I didn't get leftovers.  I will try shredded chicken the next time I make these.

I am making this for dinner tonight...can't wait.  I am going to substitute Prego for the tomato sauce...I think it will give it a richer flavor....I'll add a pinch of sugar to the sauce.  I'm also gonna use red bell peppers with the green.

To save time, I'm going to use minute rice (which I rarely ever use).  I won't have to cook it.  It will cook while the peppers cook.    Can't wait!

I changed it quite a bit... but I couldn't find a recipe that rang home.  This recipe had the correct ratios to get me started.  I crock potted it!  Fresh herbs, no worcestershire, par-boiled rice (cooled then added to RAW meat), 24oz of last year's garden sauce.  Good flavor!

Yum! But I made many modifications.. I used ground turkey and brown rice.  I mixed the ground turkey with onions, garlic, goat cheese, spices, (salt, pepper, garlic powder, thyme, and basil), tomato sauce, and then browned the meat. I also read the other suggestions and steamed the peppers beforehand.  I mixed it with more tomato sauce and goat cheese before stuffing the peppers.

I made this last night for me and my boyfriend.  I picked this recipe because of it's simplicity but it lacked flavor.  If I make it again, I am going to try adding onions and garlic to the ground turkey (I used this instead of beef) and maybe a little crushed red pepper.

These were very good for stuffed peppers-a stuffed pepper can only be so exciting. My husband has an aversion to simple, healthy food but even he liked these. I subbed out the ground beef for lean ground turkey and used brown rice instead of white for an added fiber boost. Also, I used low sodium tomato sauce--which didn't hurt because I seasoned the turkey. Added a little light parmesan and part skimmed cheddar cheese on top. All in all, we both really enjoyed these.

I grew up eating stuffed bell peppers and so I wanted to try making them myself! This recipe is wonderful and my husband asked me to make them again soon. 
Some one had said to blanch the peppers before cooking them and I did. They were great! I can remember the peppers being a little soggy when my mom made them and this time they had a better texture. :)

Very good! Next time I will decrease the ratio of rice to meat, and won't use any green peppers--just red and yellow!

I have made these twice now, first time as the recipe states and they were very good.  We like things spicy so the second time i added smoked paprika, and some cumin, and added extra of the specified seasonings.  I topped it off with adding home made hot salsa to take it to the next level.  This summer i will try to freeze them with extra peppers from the garden.  :)

I made these last night. They were delicious but agree with others that you definitely need to tend to the peppers before putting in the oven.

This was wonderful. I added chees to the top of this and it was amazing. I was only able to stuff 4 peppers which was okay because there are only two of us. Thank you so much. I will be making these again.

I blanched the bell peppers prior to baking, as suggested by a previous taster. I also used an extra can of sauce. Turned out very yummy.

Followed the recipe almost exactly.  One ingredient that is sorely needed is Frank's Red Hot!  Add 2-3 tablespoons to the rice/meat mix before stuffing, you won't be sorry!

I had left over "meat" that was prepared earlier for porcupine/headhog balls so I just stuffed that into my red peppers, I used red peppers instead of green  besides that my meat was not browned prior or or was my nice... so I checked on it every 15 minutes while brushing it with some hot chili sauce and a little cheese, ended up taking an 1hr & 30 minutes. Was delicious :)

This was WONDERFUL! I didn't have the long grain white rice so used rice pilaf from a package that I had instead. Everything else was cooked exactly like the directions mentioned, and it was great! Took a while, but it was well worth it - Will be making it again!

Did'n't like.  Bland, dry, and meat mixture fell apart when cutting open.  Also peppers should have been blanched prior to cooking. Some reviewers have good suggestion for improvement.  I should have read them first.

I have never made stuffed peppers before and this recipe was very easy and very good!  I added a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to the basting mix for a little bite and it was really good, next time I will double the basting sauce to make more sauce but otherwise it was great!

Delicious! I've never attempted stuffed peppers before and these were ah-mazing! Substituted real garlic and onion for the powder since we're low on spices (probably tasted better!) I did blanch the peppers as one reviewer recommended, but still cooked them for about an hour. As the hubby put it "W-o-w!"

Flavor is wonderful! My peppers did not stand up well and tipped over. Directions said I could cut he bottoms off them if they would not stand up. I did not do that because I thought the juice and stuff would run out. So they tipped over but they turned out great!

Tasty indeed. I scaled down the quanities for 2 people and it stuffed two peppers perfectly. The rice and beef result in a wonderful texture and the tomatoes lend just the right ammount of moisture. I used the canned fire roasted variety though, and that  worked well.

I thought this dish was excellent, as did my husband and 2 year old triplets.  Added minced garlic and parmesan to the rice/beef mixture and topped with cheddar after coming out of the oven (kept covered for a few to melt it).  Definitely think it helped to cover the dish in the oven.  Also, I only had 3 peppers so I halfed a summer squash, scooped it out and filled it with the remaining rice mixture as well as the shredded squash.  Great!

Delicious! I have made this recipe twice now. My husband isn't a fan of green peppers so I always eat his but he really enjoys the filling. I also made this for my mom and dad when they were visiting us. My mom has made stuffed green peppers for years and she LOVED mine.

Tried this recipe over a year ago, and now it's my standard for stuffed peppers. Very simple and delicious. Freezes well too.

I used minute rice and didn't cook it prior to stuffing the peppers and just let the oven do the work. The rice was fully cooked when the peppers were done and I got to save a step! I excluded the italian seasoning as I didn't realized that I didn't have any on hand before I started cooking and thought the taste was still excellent. Classic recipe.

I use real oinon vs oinon powder.  I also added a dash of taco powder to the meat and rice mix and it gives the pepper a nice little kick!

I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the peppers in half and laid them on their sides.  I did not use cheese to cover them, I think it takes away from the meat taste.  Pair with buttery mashed potatoes, and done!

These were edible but not a favorite. My friends didn't like them either. I followed the recipe exactly but they seem... too sweet maybe? I'm not sure.

This recipe was OK. I followed directions to the T. Seems like more tomato sauce needs to be added when pouring over the peppers. Also needs to be cooked in a smaller baking dish. I would like to try this again later in the future.

Everyone enjoyed these peppers. I used 1 cup of rice with 2 cups of water. Before browning ground beef, I sauteed onion with salt and garlic then added beef and seasoned with pepper and dry basil. I mixed rest of the ingredients and substituted Worcestershire sauce with spoon of soy sauce and 1/4 spoon of White wine vinegar. I stuffed 3 big bell green peppers cut in half and they fitted into 9x13 pan. I poured Prego Italian sauce over peppers. Covered, and sparkled with cheese 5 min before they're done. Thanks for the recipe.

I make this all the time with a few changes.  I use ground turkey instead of ground beef, 1 cup brown rice with 2.5 cups water, 1 can (14.5) oz of tomato sauce, 1 can (14.5) oz of italian style diced tomatoes.  I mix it all together with the seasonings and then spoon into bell peppers cut in half.  You can get more stuffing in and the pepper cook a little faster.  Just pop into the oven uncovered and they're done in about an hour.  My family loves this and it's healthy too!

Good...  but needed something.  A little on the bland side, in my opinion.  I used both fresh peppers and garlic as well as the called for powders in the recipe.  Still lacking...  something.  I might add another more spicy pepper in the mix.  Habenero, chipotle?  IDK, good, but not fabulous.

I did make some changes.. I cut my pepper the long way, they seen to fit better for me that way. And I steamed them for a minute or two first. I also found that brown rice gives it a great texture.  I used garlic flavored sauce with the mixture and added pet. canned tom.  This was the second time I made them and they were AWESOME!!!!

Very good, quick and easy recipe.  My peppers were still pretty firm after baking for an hour (I didn't cover them) so I kicked the oven temp. up to 400 and gave them another 15 minutes.  Very tasty...in fact, I had one for dinner last night, 1 for lunch today and again for dinner this evening...maybe I should freeze the rest!

This is  a good recipe but I added fresh garlic and onions, used turkey instead of beef, and used brown rice.  I boiled the peppers for a couple of minutes first, mixed in two cans of tomato sauce with the turkey mixture, and used red, green, and yellow peppers.  And it was quite tasty!!

These were ok.  I require a little thicker sauce.  I would make it with the meat mixture uncooked next time and put it in the pepper - cut in half long way and then cook it.  Very difficult to baste standing up.

I will continue to use this as a base to make stuffed peppers, but I will be adding things to give it some more zip. It was very good and filling, but seemed like it was missing something.

I made half a recipe and used leftover basmati rice.  Sauteed minced garlic and diced onions with the browned beef instead of using the powdered stuff (I did season it with garlic salt and fresh cracked pepper).  I cut the peppers into "boat" halves since it's easier for the kids to eat that way.  The half recipe filled 6 large pepper halves (3 peppers total).  My husband loved this, he went back for thirds!  My 4 year old (a very picky eater) liked it as well.  My 2 year old and I weren't so crazy about it, but thought it was okay.

This is a pretty good recipe. It's great to find another use for plain ground beef. It's a little bland, but I like the traditional taste :)

Pretty good but you should par boil the peppers first for about 3 minutes.  I also wanted more flavor so I used a bag of Knorr Spanish Rice with the ground beef. Using real garlic and onions also makes a big difference. Yum.

This is very good, although I think next time I will change a few things. The filling doesn't bind very well, so I think next time I will use a little less beef and add some cheese to the filling. Also, I topped mine with grated Monterey Jack and loved the added flavor. I would do this again but leave off the extra sauce on top (didn't seem to add anything).

This was my first stuffed pepper recipe. It was really good but I expected a little more kick with the flavor. Next time I make it I think I'll add some fresh herbs and garlic, maybe some red pepper flakes. Yum!

Great recipe. I used tomato soup instead of sauce. I usually just make two peppers, so 1 can worked quite well, mixing 3/4 into the mix, and blending the Italian season with the other 1/4. I also put cheese in the middle, and piled it on top. The long cooking time makes it nice and crispy and delicious. Yum.

Very good for a starter.  I added lots of seasonings and topped with cheese for the last 10 minutes of cooking.

Good recipe for stuffed peppers.  I use instant rice straight out of the microwave when making this recipe and it works great.  I actually use only two peppers sliced vertically and stuff them with the filling called for in the recipe.  We like our peppers piled high.  The sauce actually covers more area and stays put a little better when you slice them lengthwise.

I used Red bell peppers. Recipe is delicious, but I would prefer more than 1 lb of ground beef and less rice.

I found these to be average at best.  For me, there needs to be more sauce and less of the Italian seasoning which overpowered the meat.  The next time I try these, I will use more sauce and skip the Italian seasoning relying more maybe on onion/garlic salt or powder.

This recipe is great! I only made one adjustment to the recipe. I added about one half of a chopped white onion to the browned meat and rice mixture instead of the suggested onion powder. Other then that a great easy recipe! Great for St Pattys day Dinner

Good recipe overall.  I tweaked it a bit by boiling the peppers (1 of each red, green, yellow, and orange) for 5 minutes to par-cook them.  Run them under some cold water to stop the cooking process so they won't be overdone.  Instead of the regular long grain rice I used the boil-in-bag kind (1 bag), boiled for 10 mins.  I used ground turkey (20 oz. pkg) instead of beef and added some mozzarella cheese in the bottom of the peppers (before filling them) and on top as well.  In order to lower the sodium a bit I used 1 can (8 oz.) of regular tomato sauce and 1 can (8 oz.) of no salt added tomato sauce.  Like others have done, I mixed all of the ingredients together in the same pan I cooked the ground turkey in and skipped the basting part.  I cooked the peppers for 25 minutes in the oven on 350 and they came out perfect, not too soft with still a bit of crisp to them.  This recipe only had about 3/4 cup leftover "stuffing" as I think the peppers I used might have been larger than normal.  I will make this one again, maybe with a mixture of ground pork and turkey next time!  I think fresh sauteed onion and garlic would add some texture to this dish as well but overall the recipe is a good place to start.  Once you've got a foundation then you can always "make it your own".

THESE WERE REALLY GOOD. DELICIOUS. I BOILED MY PEPPERS AND CUT THEM LENGTHWISE AS ITS EASIER TO GET THEM TO STAND UP. I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXCEPT I ADDED EXTRA SPICES TO MY OWN LIKING AS WELL AS I PUT CHEESE AND ROTEL IN THE BEEF/RICE MIXTURE. I ONLY HAD TOO COOK ABOUT 30 MINUTES SINCE I BOILED THE PEPPERS. SCRUMPTIOUS WONDERFUL. I AM SERVING WITH GARLIC BREAD. I WILL MAKE THIS A REGULAR!! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!! = )

I love this recipe, however I did make a few alterations. My family is trying to eat healthier this new year, so instead of ground beef I used ground turkey. Also instead of brown rice I decided to use whole grain rice. Finally for the tomato sauce, I used Hunt's no salt added sauce which really cuts down on the sodium content. Overall really easy to make and tastes great.

Very good pepper recipe.  I assemble all of the raw ingredients (including raw meat), stuff the peppers and put in the crock pot for 8-10 hours.  Its super easy and tastes great.  I also put a squeeze of ketchup on top of each pepper before cooking.  I also put quite a bit of salt on it as I'm eating it, but that might just be my tastes.

This was a bit to spicey and believe me our family loves spice but I found that there was way to much garlic powder. So I used a little more rice and it tasted better.

I had leftover ground beef and was looking for a different way to use it for dinner, and I'm so glad I found this recipe!  My husband and I both really liked it, and agreed that we'll add it to our dinner "rotation"!  I used brown rice, blanched the peppers in boiling water, and sauteed onion/garlic with the meat.  I topped with Mozzarella cheese and next time, I'll probably add some of the cheese to the meat mixture before stuffing them!  Yum, yum!

Delicious! I had never had stuffed peppers before, but these were so good and really not that difficult. My only changes were that I used brown rice which only called for 1/2 cup water to 1/2 cup rice. Also covered the pan with tin foil. I sprinkled the peppers with shredded cheese within the last 10-15 minutes. This really made them taste great!

Just made this and it was wonderful. Made a few changes: browned the beef with diced carrots, green onions and celery and garlic. Added the tomato sauce (prego with mushrooms) and let simmer together while the rice pilaf (near east brand)cooked. Mixed all together with rest of ingredients/spices. Filled the peppers and cooked 1 hr and added cheese topping for another 10 min. My kids loved it. Served with bread and a salad!

Great recipe!  Just made a few changes-  I used brown rice instead of white rice and ground turkey for healthier eating.  Like many other reviewers, I blanched the peppers before stuffing them to make them a little bit softer.  I also topped with mozzarella cheese after the peppers had been in the oven for 3/4 of the time required.  Very good!

For a faster meal, I take off the tops, and remove the seeds and membranes, and then boil the green peppers for about 5 minutes.  I remove them from the boiling water carefully, so they don't break, and turn them upside down on paper towels to drain well.  While they are boiling, I prepare what the green peppers are going to be stuffed with.  (I use beef flavored rice-a-roni, instead of long grain rice).  Since the peppers have already been boiled, they are soft, and only have to go in the oven for 10 minutes or so to warm up the insides, and melt the cheese.  Delish!

great recipe! the reason why i gave it a four star rating instead of 5, however, is that like other reviewers, i found that the stuffing only filled 3 peppers! next time, i will double the stuffing ingredients. my family had to share 3 peppers amongst ourselves for dinner!

These were very good.  I made some slight changes to the recipe.  I used fresh garlic and onion and fried them up with the beef.  I added a t of chili powder to the mix and a fair amount of salt and pepper.  The meat stuffed 2 large peppers that I cut lenthwise because they are more stable in the pan.  I did not add the can of sauce over the peppers because it seemed like a waste.  I covered with foil and cooked them for 45 minutes then took the foil off and topped with cheese.  This will be my go to recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

We do not like green peppers. I was looking for something different to do with ground beef so when I found this recipe I thought why not. My husband was not in favor of the meal until I showed him the recipe. When all was eaten ( it was really all gone) he said that this meal was a keeper and to put it in my meal rotation. I did not make many changes and I kept snacking on the unused filling!

Absolutely amazing!  I used ground turkey instead and I topped mine with Asiago cheese which went really well.  I think next time I will mix it in with the rice & ground turkey.  I followed people's advice to cook the meat & rice in one pan and it turned out really lovely and easy.

Very bland, doesn't seem to be enough seasoning. When cooking the ground beef, used fresh minced garlic and diced onion. I blanched the bell peppers in the rice water (accidentally bought minute rice bags).

This recipe was dry and tasteless. Recommend author change "tomato paste" amounts and use "diced or stewed tomatoes" maybe even marinara sauce.

My family loved this! Of course I had to play with it. Used ground turkey and browned it with a small chopped onion and 2 chopped garlic cloves. I parboiled my peppers for about 4 minutes - we like them soft. Because my peppers were long and skinny, I halved them lenghtwise. I used 2 15 oz cans of tomato sauce and a cup+  of cooked rice.I used all the spices listed in the recipe for both cans of tomato sauce.Covered the filled peppers with foil and baked about 30 minutes. My family thanks you!

I LOVE this recipe. But there's not enough sauce at all. Thankfully I had a jar of spaghetti sauce and dumped it all over the peppers and it came out great!

These are sooooo good!!! My hubby was so impressed. Like other users I did add some things like paprika and italian style diced tomatoes, but the foundation of this recipe is what makes it the best. It is sooooo good!!! I will be making this for years and years to come. Thaks for such a great one!!!

I modified this recipe to bring it up to my Husband's standards...While browning the meat, I added more garlic powder, a dash of ground red pepper and some chili powder. This helped give it a little more flavor. I also used about double the Wors. sauce that this recipe calls for. We love foods with a "kick"! After seeing others advice on covering the dish as it bakes, I did so but pulled the foil with about 10 minutes left.I topped them with cheese (which my Husband said needed to be added to the "stuffing" as well)and baked for the remaining time.

 I am not a big fan of stuffed peppers but it was pretty tasty and easy to make. I am a big fan of baking things for a while so that I can clean up the kitchen as it cooks!

Great recipe.  I blanched the peppers for 5 min.  I used one onion because I like onions.  I used one can of tomato sauce and about the same amount of meat prego in the mixture.  I also blended parsley, garlic, green onion with salt and hot sauce in the food processor for taste (it's a Haitian thing - gives your food more flavor).  I added half of the second can of tomato sauce to the top of my stuffed peppers then added mixed cheese (containing cheddar).  I think this prevents the dryness some of the readers were complaining about.  I used the other half of that second can of tomato and mixed it with equal amount of water and poured it at the bottom of the pan.  I cooked everything for 25 min -- perfect!

I really liked this recipe! I was really pressed for time so this is what I did: After prepping the peppers to be stuffed, I submerged them in a huge pot of boiling water for about 20 min. to soften. I used microwaved instant rice as well. By the time the peppers were stuffed, they only needed another 15 min. in the preheated oven for the sauce and peppers to heat through and for the mozzerella cheese (I added) to melt. * Didn't have any worcestershire ( BTW, I pronounce it wers-ter-shur. Is that incorrect?) I put about a TBS. of Heinz 57. Tasted great! Thanks to the author for a fabulous base recipe!

I made this recipe using 10-minute brown rice and lean ground beef. I added minced garlic and onion for flavor and I blanched the peppers for one minute before stuffing. One bell pepper was plenty for two people (we had veggies and salad, too).  Will make again.

Healthy and soooooo delicious! I added a 1/2 can of petite diced tomatoes to the beef and rice mixture, and used the rest in the sauce to pour over the peppers. I also used Minute rice. Boyfriend thought it was one of the best meals he's had. Thanks for sharing!

This was so good that both my husband and son had seconds. I cooked in some chopped onion and minced garlic in the meat. I subbed 2 cans of tomato soup for the sauce. I didn't use the italian seasoning. I topped these with cheese and cooked until it melted the last 7 minutes of cook time.

My mom used to make this for my sister and I while growing up, and I haven't since leaving the house. This recipe reminded me of my mom's recipe, it's delicious. My husband never had stuffed peppers and he liked them as well. I always use ground turkey instead of ground beef (to cut down on fat and calories) and it was terrific. I would definitely make this again!

We also add about 3 Tbsp of brown sugar to the sauce and spices BEFORE adding the sauce to the beef and rice..  that way both the stuffing AND the basting sauce have a slightly sweet taste - GREAT for getting the younger taste buds tingled!

I followed the recipe and it turned out well. However, I covered it with foil instead of basting and it turned out great. Also, it needs more of a kick. I added oregano but it could still use something else. We thought it could use more sauce, too.

Absolutely perfect, my family loved them. The only thing that I did differently is after I basted the peppers for the last time I sprinkled grated mozzerella cheese on top and raised the temp to 450* to get the cheese golden brown.

My family loved this recipe and it was such an easy supper.  I love recipes that don't have weird, obscure ingredients.  Very tasty.

My family LOVED these peppers! I thought they were easy to make. I did add spaghetti sauce to the top of them instead of the tomato sauce. They were delicious.

This was really tasty. I too added some sausage and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top during the last 10 minutes of baking. The only problem was that the recipe only made 3 fully stuffed peppers, but the only peppers I could find were extremely large. If you're using large peppers, be sure to increase the ingredients. Other than that, it was a winner. I will definitely make again.

This recipe was a hit.    I used saffron rice instead and added minced garlic to the recipe.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Excellent base recipe!

I modified it fairly extensively, using brown rice, cooked onion, jalapeño, fresh garlic, raisins, and I used Red, Yellow and Orange bell peppers.

I also used chopped tomatoes as the topping and put the bell pepper tops on while cooking - they came out very moist and delicious!

This is a great recipe. Although, sometimes I switch up the ground beef with ground pork sausage and lose the seasonings.

This recipe has a good flavor and is one of the few vegetable-oriented dishes that my husband will actually eat.  I sprinkle cheddar cheese on the tops for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  My complaint is that there really isn't enough stuffing for 6 peppers.

I'm updating my review with my revisions to 5 stars.  I sautéed about 1/2 cup diced onion with a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic, then I added the ground beef to the skillet and browned the meat.  I added about 1/2 cup extra cooked rice and I also used tomato sauce with garlic, basil and oregano added.  I also doubled the Worcestershire sauce and added about 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese.  I ended up with a much more flavorful filling and probably had enough for an extra pepper.

Very tasty!

These were delicious. I added a little extra pepper, salt, garlic salt, and Worcestire sauce then what the recipe called for. Plus, I grilled a diced onion with the beef, which came out great. Also, I used 5 minute boil-in-a-bag rice because that was all I had. It was great! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was good but it needs some cheese added.  I might also add some more spices, the tomato paste with rice and meat is rather bland... could use a little kick maybe.

Very good. I used real chopped garlic and onion and mixed in some Paremsan cheese too. I also cooked in creamy tomato soup and sour cream mixture--makes the sauce thicker and isn't absorbed as quickly by the peppers/meat. Delish!!

Very good.  Not so sure that I like stuffed pepers, but everyone else loved it.  I made it with ground turkey and brown rice that I cooked in the rice cooker.

I used ground buffalo meat instead of beef. I added a bunch of feta to the sauce (Great addition we though!) I used tomatoe paste as well as a little tomatoe sauce. Instead of green peppers, I used yellow and red. Finally I topped it off with lots of cheddar and parm cheese before baking. Yum! :)

Oh boy this is a good one. Might want a tad more sauce for 'basting' though. Also, we made with Red, Yellow and Green Peppers and that gives it a bit of a different flavor. We'll be having this one again for sure!

This was just ok.  I did add 1 can of diced tomatos for extra sauce and flavor like some suggested.  The taste was ok, but nothing extraordinary.  The kids didn't really care for it, and neither did the hubby.

This is a great stuffed pepper recipe! The only things I would change are using more sauce and planning on only 4 peppers.  My husband loves them and they taste very close to what my mom used to make me as a kid, if not the same.

I tried this recipe last night. I sliced the peppers longways. This allowed the peppers to lay in the pan and the sauce dispersed evenly. It alsa made it easier to service. The famiy loved it. I will make this again. Maybe I'll add a little cheese on top next time ...

Awesome!  I am not a fan of bell peppers and was hesitant to taste the actual pepper instead of just eating the yummy filling!  LOL.  Man was I shocked that the pepper didn't have that "bell peppery" taste!  I will definitely make this again, but if using large peppers, cook a little while longer.

YUMMY!! I cooked the rice & meat before stuffing. Placed the peppers in some water and microwaved for 1 min. I season the meat like I do for tacos (a great use for leftovers! Sometimes I'll do 1/2 hot sausage, too!) I use ketchup (better than it sounds-- it's seasoned tomato sauce!) chili powder, garlic & tabasco, & some lawry's in the meat. I make whatever rice I have handy-- cheesy broccoli works well. Stuff the peppers & bake covered for 45-50 minutes @ 400. Then top with cheese (any kind!) and bake uncovered for 15 more minutes.

I followed the instructions scaled down to 3 servings (instead of 6). I still used 2 cans of tomato sauce (one in the mixture and one to baste) and it was great- I think that only using 1 would have made the peppers too dry. I did not blanch my peppers before stuffing and baking them and I loved the texture- still firm, but starting to soften. 
I also topped mine with a few french's dry onions and it was a nice touch.

I'm trying to add fiber to my diet so I added a can of corn (drained) and some carrots finely chopped in the food processor.  Came out great!  Recommend a bit of extra garlic powder too.

Tasty recipe, it was close to the basic recipe my grandmother used which is what first inspired me to select it.  We are a family of six, 3 of 6 ate them, 3 of 6 liked them.  The other 3 wouldn't try.  I used other suggestions as well.  I added Mozzarella, I used minced garlic.  Forgot to pre-boil the peppers though.  I used Ragu spaghetti sauce.  I used foil so  didn't have to best.  Excellent, will use again.  More cheese next time.

The pepper filling was delicious, however, if I had made this for company, I would have been disappointed because my peppers were a bit burned on the top. I spoke to my mom afterwards and she said next time, boil or steam the peppers for 5 minutes first and only put it in the oven for 30, also add some shredded cheese to the bottom and top. Sounds like a good plan for next time, I think! At least now I can make excellent filling. Thanks!

This is a great basic version of the classic stuffed pepper recipe.  I used two huge yellow peppers and one red one and halved the recipe.  I also added cheese on top but did not have enough sauce it seemed so I basted with chicken broth.

Great recipe. I used two green peppers and two red peppers. The red peppers were very large, so I only made four and had plenty of filling. The filling could use a little more seasoning - maybe more garlic powder or some onion. Next time, I met try substituting cooked sausage for the ground beef. A little mozzarella cheese might also be a good addition, either added to the filling or sprinkled on top. Excellent flavor!

This is a meal in and of itself. I don't usually go for stuffed peppers, but these were Good. The preparation is a little on the long side, but very simple. I also added grated mozzarella on top.

Mixture filled up four large green peppers (with a little extra rice) and I used another entire can of sauce over the top...we like it saucy around here.  I tossed on a can of mushrooms since my son won't eat the green pepper....easy and delicious.....It took about 20 more mins to cook to 160 degrees.

this was great! i'm not a cook person, but the instructions were super easy to follow and it was really easy to make these! they were wonderful! except i skipped out on the tomoato sauce and the italian-style seasoning. and instead of onion powder, i choped and mixed half a bulb of onion. and for the basting, i used beef broth. it came out wonderful! this recipe was great in helping me get the jist of how to make it!

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and it came out well. I had to cook it for longer than one hour for the meat to be fully cooked. Also, like other reviews, I felt it was a little bland. Next time I will add more spices. Also, I too used more sauce. I covered the dish except for the last 15 minutes and I boiled the peppers for 4 mintues to make the softer. I would definitely try this again though. I liked that I didnt have to brown the meat first. Huge time saver.

Turned out fairly well, I spiced it up a bit with some leftover peperoni and it turned out much better. Used chopped onion instead of powder.

I used half of a large fresh onion and it worked out well.  I also used an excess of garlic and W-sauce.  You don't really need to baste the peppers while they cook.  Instead, when you cut them in half to eat, pour on some hot tomato sauce.  Great, even as leftovers!

Very nice - I used this recipe the first time I made stuffed peppers, and it's very easy and straightforward. I recycled rice from a previous sausage and peppers dish, and it picked up some of that flavor, which enhanced the dish. Also good with ground sausage vs. ground beef.

these were okay, actually without the peppers the filling was fine since we had leftovers, we topped the filling with mozerella cheese. These though are not kid friendly, my brother 16, was not impressed.

This recipe was delicious.  My fiance cleaned his plate and mentioned how much he enjoyed it several times.  I used more tomato sauce and boiled the peppers first for 4-5 min, followed by placing them in a cold bath of water and rinsing well.

Great recipe.  Best stuffed peppers I’ve ever eaten.  Where’s the cheese shown on the picture?  I used it anyway.  My peppers were really large so I poured the sauce into the top of each pepper.  They were delicious.

Very good, I followed the suggestions of using a can of diced tomato & also increased the rice to 1 cup (water 2 cups).  I used 3 1/2 peppers cut -into halves.   Baked them covered for 1hr.  I uncovered,  put the extra sauce on top, then the cheese & baked an additional 10 min.

The mixture was not moist, no sauce to baste with.    I only made 4 peppers & had barely enough to fill them all. Cooked uncovered &now the peppers are all dry.

Made this recipe using turkey instead of beef. I added a little shredded parmesan on top. It was tasty and everyone liked it.

I boiled the peppers for a few minutes first. Instead of ground beef I used plant based sausage and chick peas. I like a little more worcestershire sauce but great base recipe.

I don’t know why this is rated so highly. I’m Croatian and I’ll tell you that this is an abomination. Use fresh garlic and onions. Use paprika. This recipe is lacking in every area. Use red peppers not green ones. If you are cooking for the first time and have no kitchen experience then use the recipe from this site otherwise find an authentic stuffed peppers recipe. This one is a no go.

If I make it again I will pre-cook the bell peppers before filling.  I actually put them in the microwave with a bit of water in the bowl to tenderize the peppers.  Other than that issue for me they are very good.

I love stuffed bell peppers but I am not a great fan of rice. I usually substitute some chopped fresh tomatoes, chopped cauliflower,  chopped broccoli and a little jalapenos for the rice. Try a little experimentation, you can bend the rules a bit if you like.

This is a great recipe. I followed the recipe and the peppers were so good.  By basting the peppers they stayed moist and delicious. I live a low carb lifestyle so the only thing that I changed was cauliflower for rice.

Followed this recipe to a T except that I added provolone on top. I doubled the recipe and had to cook them for 1.5 hours bc my peppers were so large. The peppers consistency came out just to my liking, soft, not to crisp or to mushy. The meat was very very bland. I was extremely disappointed. I even thought that i over seasoned it while cooking  the meat. They tasted like something was missing or lacking but I'm not sure what. If my husband likes them I will try again a little differently. I also will add/admit that the  look/presentation was outstanding and also that the recipe was very easy to follow and all ingredients were all also very easy to have on hand.

These were awesome! The picture shows cheese melted on top, but was not in the recipe. I covered the peppers with foil and baked. Afterward, I removed the foil , covered with shredded mozzarella and put them back in the oven for cheese to melt. Everyone loved them !

This was really yummy! I thought the seasoning was just right. 
 Will definitely add it to the weeknight dinner rotation!  I was short on time so I steamed the peppers in the microwave for 2 minutes before baking and they only needed 40 min.  Topped with cheese and broiled for a few minutes at the end.  Served with sour cream and refried beans.

(Replaces previous review.) Instead of a pound of ground beef, I used a pound of frozen soy protein crumbles, thawed (no need to brown them); I also replaced the tomato sauce with a 14.5-ounce can of stewed tomatoes and a 6-ounce can of tomato paste, simmered for about 10 minutes while the rice cooked. I also added Italian seasoning to the beef and rice mixture and covered the pan with foil before baking. Perform that last step and you won’t need to blanch the peppers before filling them. The result will be a tad sweeter and definitely less salty than the original recipe.

I do not like stuffed peppers but I made it for my husband who does. Every other recipe I have used in the past stated to parboil the peppers before stuffing. I was happy to see that I didn't have to with this one...until hubby said they were not cooked enough. Too crunchy. Now I have to find a way to cook the remaining peppers without recooking the meat.

This was delicious! I added a little garlic and onion powder to the beef while it cooked and then stuffed 12 mini sweet peppers cut in half long ways. The extra filling I spread over the top so it was almost like a casserole. Cooked at 400 for 20 min (remember I used the mini peppers), topped them with some mozzarella and then back in the oven for a few minutes until the cheese browned some. Definitely a keeper and if I stuffed more peppers instead of laying the extra filling on top, these would have made a great appetizer.

This recipe is my go-to, but I blanch the peppers for 2-3 mins before baking so it only takes about 20 in the oven. ?? Also as a vegetarian option, I’ve made this with MorningStar Farms Grillers Crumbles in place of beef, and A1 Sauce (did you know it’s vegan?!) in place of Worcestershire! As others have said, this recipe is a great outline of the dish so you can make it your own.

I have made this twice and the family just loves it. I always substitute Paul Newman's sockarooni pasta sauce in place of the tomato sauce, it's adds a great flavor. I always have extra stuffing so I make a casserole for my two kids that don't like bell peppers. they just devour it!!!

Am I the only one who added an entire 15oz can of tomato sauce to the meat mixture bc they don’t sell 8oz cans in the store? I didn’t even notice, I only saw “2 cans of tomato sauce” when I read the recipe. They sell 8oz cans of tomato paste but not sauce. I don’t know how it’s gonna turn out now but that’s confusing and it kinda irked me a bit when I realized. In the future I would recommend changing that to 1 can of sauce divided.

This is how my stuffed peppers turned out. They roasted without me having to baste. I would say 1 1/2 cans of tomato sauce is more than plenty. I used two cans and I had way to much after stuffing the beef mixture in.

Flavor was good, but the portions seem way off. The beef and rice mixture is not enough to fill 6 peppers, unless they are very small. The amount of tomato sauce is also grossly insufficient, resulting in unusually dry stuffed peppers.

I added Taco Sauce with the tomato sauce. It came out great. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a photo of it. My family loved it and asked me to make it again. Next time, I will remember to take a photo before consuming it.

I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of the Worcestershire sauce extra and added a half of cup of shredded Parmesan cheese to the hamburger mixture. It was a hit and my son's girlfriend ask him often when i make it again to please let her know.

I charred the peppers under the broiler while cooking the rice and meat, then topped the stuffed peppers with cheese and cooked it all together for ~15 minutes to melt the cheese, finish roasting the peppers, and let the flavors get to know each other. Fab!

The sauce was good. However, I used 6 large, thick skinned peppers. There was only enough filling to fill them a bit more than halfway. For large peppers amount should probably be doubled (meat and rice). There was absolutely nothing to baste these peppers with. It also did not specify whether to cover them while in the oven. Since I had made stuffed peppers in my rice steamer before (these peppers were too large to use it) I put a cup of water in the bottom of the pan and put foil over the top of the pan to let them steam. It took an hour and 15 minutes to be able to steam large peppers so they were soft enough to eat. 

Parboiling was suggested by other reviewers and I think that is a good idea. Also, if you're going to make six peppers, use the thinner skinned small ones to have enough to make them look like the illustration, or brown more meat and make more rice so that you have enough filling to fill them to the top. I think if a beginning cook were making this recipe they would have been sorely disappointed in the outcome. 

My steamer recipe uses ketchup as a topping instead of the Italian seasoning tomato sauce. I think that would have been a much better option here.

We weren't crazy about the tomato topping but overall it was a good dish.  Prep took a little longer than expected, but it was easy.  I will make it again with a tweak or two.

It needs more flavour.  It is to bland for my taste. I would add some Parmesan cheese in the meat and rice mixture. And some mozzarella on top when you bake the peppers.

I used diced onion instead of onion powder and I didn't have Italian seasoning but it was still delicious! I covered it with foil before baking and added shredded cheese for the last 5 minutes. Next time I'll garnish with some jalepeno slices and diced onion. Everyone loved these, even the kids!

Very delicious. Husband gives it 2 thumbs up. I substituted garlic and onion powder for minced of each as I was out of the powder. My peppers were so large I only got for peppers with this recipe. I probably could have gotten more “stuffed” going with 3 peppers.

I sautéed a yellow onion, 2 cloves garlic and 1lb ground beef with parsley and meat seasoning. Cooked instant rice separately and then mixed it in the beef mixture with 1/2 can diced tomatoes. 2 cans tomato sauce in a bowl added sugar, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, pepper, and meat seasoning. Mixed it together. Pour half the sauce in with the meat mixture. Stuff 4 green peppers with the mixture. Bake covered, at 350 for 45 minutes. Top with remaining sauce and shredded cheddar and bake uncovered, for 15 more minutes.

I cooked the meat with the seasonings rather than adding them to the mixture. And for a bit of a bite, a dash of tobasco. 
My grandparents are now begging for the recipe.

It was ok, but I found it pretty bland even though I seasoned it more than the recipe called for. I think adding  some chopped onion, garlic, and maybe even a couple jalapeños would have made it more flavorful.

We loved these stuffed peppers and will definitely make them again.  One change I made was to blanch the peppers for 2 minutes in boiling water.  I reduced the baking time to 40 minutes, because everything was already cooked.

I used fresh tomatoes in with the burger and rice, fresh garlic, fresh green onion and basil I dried myself. There was also oregano, celery salt ... basically, everything I used was  fresh.. I did not use Worcestershire  and the sauce I poured on top and around was Ragu Mushroom and Green Pepper. Everyone loved it! Thank you for the basics!

Have made this recipe 3-4 times - it’s in the repertoire now for sure! I blanched the peppers this time it worked good, also added blended cheese.

I enjoyed this recipe.    I added sliced provolone as a topper near the end of the baking process, and added hot sauce, basil, and garlic to the rice mixture.

I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup .  I recommend increasing the cook time to 70 minutes to soften up the peppers.

Closest recipe I have found to my mom’s!  I did brown the meat and added half a chopped onion.  Out of Worcestershire sauce which I love, so tried soy sauce instead.  Next time I will make sure to use Worcestershire!  Only used five peppers because they were humongous at the store and I like the peppers filled all the way to the top!  Finally, used a 15 ounce can of sauce vs. the smaller can, to make sure all peppers were covered—plus I like them saucey.  Very good-thank you for sharing!

First time I have ever made these, it was very easy and I doubled the meat. My family is primarily carnivorous, so the extra meat became a meatloaf so to speak.

I made the green stuffed bell peppers ... with changes.
I cut the tops off & set them aside.
I removed the pith & seeds from the body of the peppers & cleaned the inside of the tops.  I put the tops back on the pepper I cut it from later after stuffing the peppers.  Also, I cooked the rice to the sticky stage.   
I used Contadina sauce in the stuffing the mixture in each pepper & used toothpicks to reattach the tops to the peppers. I used 2 large cans of Contadina crushed tomatoes plus 2 TBS of sugar all mixed together. 
I added enough of the crushed tomatoes to just cover the bottom of a dutch oven on top of the stove and then put the peppers in.  I poured the remaining crushed tomatoes over the peppers. Put the cover on the pot & cooked them on simmer for 2 1/2 hours. I left them on the stove covered until I was ready to serve dinner.

This came out really good, will definitely make again. I added some fresh garlic to the beef and used prego pasta sauce, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I dont get home from work until 930, so this was a perfect recipe to make in the morning, stick in the fridge. and have my husband put in the oven later so dinner was ready when I got home.

This is a good starter recipe but it left me craving more flavor. I added sautéd onions and blue cheese crumbles on top which proved to be delightful. Next time I make, I think I’ll do some experimenting with adobo peppers and spices to liven it up a bit. May also put cheese inside the pepper.

When making this consider which herbs and spices you prefer (definitely add more than the recipe calls for).  Also, if you're vegetarian like moi, cube a couple mushrooms instead of using minced meat! It creates a wonderful risotto-like element and contributes a creamy texture!

I will definitely makes these again! My son doesn't eat peppers so he was served the filling and LOVED IT! And he's only 4. We all know how picky they can be! I added extra seasonings for taste but other than that followed the recipe just as it said.

I boiled the peppers for 5-10 minutes before stuffing them and then cooked them at 400 for 25 minutes for time sake. They came out awesome! Also added a slice of mozzarella at the end.

Loved it! I wound up cutting the peppers in half to make boats out of them and laying them on their sides rather than standing the peppers full and upright. I also added some extra toppings like cheese and sour cream like a bit of a fiesta style.

Didn’t mix the Worcestershire sauce very well so some bites were bitter.  Might leave the Worcestershire sauce out next time and add more tomato sauce.

Came out good. I changed a few things. Steamed the peppers first to reduce baking time. Added fresh onion and fresh garlic, green chilis. Added sazon for more flavor, was pretty bland at first. I also just cooked the meat with the onion and just added all the ingredients to the pan. Why transfer it to a bowl and make another dirty dish? Put cheddar cheese on top of the and broiled it :)

We used chopped onions, minced garlic, and mushrooms. Cooked those up with the hamburger.  We topped it with a mix of mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese. It turned out great!

Was good. Used tomato soup for the tomato topping like I normally do. Added extra stuffing left over to wedge in between the peppers which keeps them upright and allows extra filling if wanted. Also added stewed tomatoes to pan.

I loved it! Very delicious! Also, an easier way is to get a different sauce than traditional and then you won't have to add the italian seasoning.

There was not enough moisture present in the ingredients as they are written.  Add a LOT of extra tomato sauce and make sure to tightly cover the dish to a better likelihood of success.

Added onion and mushrooms. Diced the peppers and incorporated them in the “stuffing”...otherwise daughter would not even try it.

She not only tried it, she loved it. And, asked me to make it again.

I really like this recipe a lot! Doing it as shown here is fine. I've started using spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and spices though just for ease. I also add some mozzarella cheese on top of the peppers for the last 15 minutes of bake time to make it extra decadent!

I have to agree with another reviewer that this is a good "base" recipe to get them started. I never par-cook the peppers because there is no need for that if you cook them long enough.
I par-cook lean ground chuck 90/10 and most of the time (to save time) use uncooked Minute Rice. You can also just mix the burger (raw) and the Minute Rice in a pinch and put you seasonings in the mix and some of the sauce. I personally use a 29 ounce can of Tomato Sauce because I like to pour sauce over a bed of rice.
I bake them at a 375 degree oven for 1 hour to an hour and fifteen minutes and I also add fresh grated garlic and minced onions to the mix with S&P.
My husband LOVES them and they turn out perfect every time!

These were great. I added extra rice which was cooked in chicken broth first. I also added chopped celery, chopped bell pepper tops , and chopped onion, which I browned before adding to the meat and rice mixture.

I used ground turkey rather than beef. I found that there was a lack of flavour, so added quite a few different spices. Also tripled the amount of rice that was mixed in and I felt that was a great addition (likely would have ran out of filling otherwise). Agree with the recommendations to add more sauce, will likely use a marinara sauce next time just to add more flavour and less tomato acidity. But a good bass recipe to start with.

Discrding the tops is wasteful cooking, not what mother taught me. Remove the stems from the tops and chop the remaining finely. Add the finely chopped tops to the hamburger while cooking.

My husband loved these!! I did make some adjustments though  - sauteed finely chopped onion and 2 garlic cloves then added meat to brown before adding left over cooked basmati rice. As noted in an earlier review, there was not enough sauce to ladle over the peppers so added extra tomato sauce and white wine. Worked perfectly. Cooked the peppers for 15 minutes longer than indicated which made for nice soft peppers that still held their shape. Will definitely do this recipe again!

They were ok.  I would blanch my peppers first as they were too crunchy.  Also, there wasn't much substance to them.  They needed eggs and breadcrumbs.

I haven't made peppers that tasted even close to this ever! Mom's recipe is now labeled in my collection as bland LOL.  I took this recipe and doctored it up a bit, with fire roasted tomatoes (in a can), some RPF, and a red onion diced. And I kind of misread the amount for the Worcestershire, but who doesn't love that flavor?!?! I'm keeping this recipe for my next pepper delivery from Imperfect Produce!

I did what several other commenters suggested: blanched the peppers first, omitted the onion powder and garlic spice and used real chopped onion and crushed garlic in with the ground beef.  I also used a garlic tomato/spaghetti sauce.  I think it would have been bland otherwise and I don't like the powders.  The peppers were very flavourful.  I would suggest making the filling ahead to simplify weeknight meals if you can.

These were very delicious. The changes I made were - I cooked the hamburger and strained it, in the same pan the hamburger cooked in I added chopped garlic and sautéed it. Then I added the rice and water and cooked it. While the rice was cooking I prepped the peppers and cooked them in the oven with no filling. When the rice was ready I added in the hamburger that was strained and the tomato sauce In the same pan. So only one pan was used. I also added in some can chopped tomatoes. I took the empty peppers out of the oven and filled them with the hamburger mix. And lastly baked for 40 minutes. The last 5 mins of cooking I sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top. Yummy!!

These were good!  I made some changes based on reviews.  I had 4 large red peppers and felt like I needed more filling so I used about 1 1/2 lb. gr. beef and made adjustments to the seasonings accordingly.  I started by blanching the peppers for 2 minutes and plunging in a ice bath to stop the cooking.  I then sauted a small onion with a couple cloves garlic to soften, then added the beef to brown.  Once brown, I drained and returned to the pan.  I added 2 (8 oz) cans tomato sauce and increased the garlic powder and onion powder to 1 tsp, used 1 tsp salt and about 1/2 tsp pepper. Combined all and heated for a few minutes. I then combined a 3rd (8 oz) can of tomato sauce with the Italian seasoning and topped the peppers with it.  I covered them with foil, baked for 30 minutes covered, then removed the foil and topped with mozzarella cheese and baked uncovered for an additional 15 minutes.  Sorry this is so long! I wrote it all out so I would remember what i did next time I make them!

I made the recipe as is but just in a bigger batch for a family get-together. The meal turned out wonder! It was so easy and delish. We did add a little shredded cheese to the top about 5 min before the peppers where done baking. I will definitely be making these again.

I made the recipe as follows but I added onions and butter when I browned the meat. The salt and pepper was not enough seasoning for me so I added seasoned and garlic salt.

I'd rather try a recipe with onions and garlic next time. This was a tad boring in my opinion. Also peppers required over 1hr cook time.

I followed this recipe exactly. It came out very nice.  I did cover the peppers with some foil for most of the cooking time so they wouldn't burn and dry out on top.  Then removed it about 10 min. before the end of cooking time.  Cheese on top is a nice touch.

Great recipe tweaked to make it even better! I used red, yellow, and green peppers, 1.25lbs ground beef/pork/veal mixture, 1/2c long grain rice cooked with parsley. I sauteed 1/4 of Vidalia onion in olive oil with 1 clove of garlic, 1-2tbsp of chopped parsley, 2tsp of fresh oregano, 1tbsp fresh basil chopped then added 1tbsp Worcestershire sauce. Put meat, rice, sauteed seasonings and 1 can of tomato sauce into large bowl to fold ingredients together. Put mixture into peppers that I cut in half and then covered using 1 can of tomato sauce. Cooked at 350° for about 45 minutes. Sprinkled with mozzarella and put back in the oven at 425° for 5(+/-) minutes. Perfection!!

I followed some of the suggestions and made a few changes.

I prefer red peppers so I used those instead; cooked them first in a covered pan for about 30 minutes.

I slightly undercooked the rice (intentional).

I then made tomato sauce using Italian seasoning, crushed tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.

Sautéed garlic and onions which i added to the cooked rice.

After/during the browning of the meat, I added the Worcestershire sauce. 

I put everything together and then stuffed the peppers. Also added fresh mozzarella inside a few of the pepper and on top.

They came out delicious.

My variation: I blanch my peppers to soften. I add garlic powder,diced  onions, yellow/ red peppers  when cooking  the ground turkey and  taco seasoning  when the meat is cooked. I mix the meat with yellow rice and then stuff the peppers. I pour taco sauce on the top of the peppers before placing in the oven. My cooking in the oven is less because I have softened the peppers in the preparation.

Did change a little.  Cooked peppers in boiling water for about 10 minutes.  Left out the Italian sausage since didn't have any.  Added chopped onion instead of onion powder and cooked with ground beef.  Added some Mozzarella cheese to the top of peppers.  Really good.

I used bacon instead of beef, and it was a bit too rich-- my bad. I followed baking time and my peppers were tender, but they turned an unappetizing shade of light green and wrinkled quite a bit. Perhaps a little less time in the oven will make the dish look more appealing while ensuring tender peppers.

Third review attempt is a charm! Phone is giving me a hard time. I love this recipe and adjusted it for my  and my family’s taste. I’ve used Ragu in place of tomato sauce for more flavor, more hamburger and rice for a hardier dish, and cheese on top. I used tinfoil on top for baking the whole time so that the peppers cook through fully.

REVISED REVIEW:  These are the best stuffed peppers we've ever had.  I am used to blanching the cleaned peppers for 2 minutes in boiling water so I did that.  Perhaps it wasn't necessary.  BE SURE TO DRAIN THE GREASE FROM THE GROUND BEEF.   Seasonings were just right for our family.  Made a double batch and took one to a sick neighbor.  This will be my new go-to-recipe for stuffed peppers.  Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe was good. I made it to specifications except I added an extra tablespooon of worchesire sauce. I also used  red, yellow, and orange bell peppers, which added another level of flavor. I would make this recipe again, and would add onions and spicy Italian sausage.

This was a very simple tasty dish. I cooked my rice in beef bullion cubs instead of water to give it extra flavor. Also increase the amount of spices add to the dish.

Was worried that the peppers would come out "crunchy" because I didn't blanch them first, but it worked! Definitely baste the peppers while cooking. Helps soften the peppers

I did not put the sauce on at the end. And it still turned out wonderful. Made this last night for dinner, for my boyfriend, his father and mother and myself. And got a great outcome.

I absolutely loved this recipe, quick and easy to make. I would recommend using additional tomato sauce with seasoning and a half cup of water (to thin it out) to baste with as I did not have enough after the initial basting and it left the peppers slightly drier than I had prefered when they had finished cooking. Even so, Amazing taste! I used yellow red and orange peppers as I prefer a sweeter taste, did not disappoint! Topped with shredded cheese sprinkle and was delish.

Made a few changes.
Substituted Quinoa for the Rice. Used same amount. Rice has folic acid, and family member can't have it.
Also kept the tops of the bell peppers (made sure to keep them organized to each other.)
I recall my Mom doing that.
Covered in foil.
Came out very moist and did not need to do any basting.

Excellent BASIC  recipe that, with some tweeking, should gain many plaudits from your family and guests. 
There are two of us, so I used only four peppers -- leaving two peppers' worth of stuffing.  That makes for a really easy meal later in the week.
I  did some mixing-up on the tomatoes, too: I used one 8 oz can (half the recipes' recommendation) complemented with a similarly-sized can of diced tomatoes with green-- 'warm'  but not hot, peppers) and a small can of tomato paste. 
And I  moderately undercooked the rice, as it was getting an hour in the oven to finish it off.
My  BIGGEST   change to the recipe was to add a really fully   cup of fresh parsley and a  tablespooon_plus a   generous dollop of oregano and about a  Tbs of minced garlic. '(Next  time, I'll add  more!)
A minor thing:  I used enough white wine to loosen the tomato paste so all from the can could be used.
Oh, and  I added NO salt or pepper  -- not least because I am salt-sensitive and... hey, other ingredients added enough of that.
Don't  be shy with the Worcestershire Sauce:  You'd have to REALLY overdo it to be in trouble, flavorwise. 
NOTE: Don't leave yourself short of sauce for the topping.
And consider doing  as  I  did: Leaving enough filling for another couples of pepper later in the week! (Or use the mix as an omelet filling!)

Made exactly as the recipe says - but this just didn't wow me.  It was okay, and was simple enough to make, using common pantry items (a huge plus in my book).  I think my preferences run toward a more mexican flavor than Italian.  This won't be my go-to recipe

I have made this several times now, I use multicolored peppers rather than green and a mixture of brown and wild rice  but otherwise stick to the recipe.  This recipe never disappoints and the left overs for lunches are wonderful.  I use tinfoil over the pan so no basting and never any cheese.

It was my first time making stuffed peppers. I sliced 2 large red peppers in half and filled them. I had enough left over filling for one more half. The only thing I thought this needed was more salt. Other than that it was de-lish. Will make again!

From this as a start, you can create a great dish. 
My problem with stuffed peppers is their texture baked individually.
To fix this, for me, I placed the stuffed peppers in a deep baking dish and then packed around them with the stuffing mix, covered with sauce and shredded cedar and baked. 
The peppers are tender but not rubbery and mushy, retaining some crispness.
I know... I made a casserole! Lol
The best part is it's easy to make excellent variations. I made southwestern with taco seasononING, corn and black beans. Once with feta, olives, etc Greek style.

I’m not used to eating these with tomato sauce but figured I would give it a try. The first time, the taste was ok but the peppers were too hard. The second time, I blanched the peppers for two minutes, added Sazon & Sofrito instead of the Italian seasoning, used an actual onion and two cloves of garlic. It was better tasting but the peppers were still too hard for my liking.

I used red pepper with the bottom sealed with foil (because cutting for a standing base made a hole and I didn't want all the deliciousness to leak out), real garlic cooked slightly before adding the beef, and didn't baste at all since I forgot to save some sauce for that. I was surprised how easy and yummy this was! Next time I will  also use real onion if I have any.

This was an AMAZING dish. This is an easy recipe and I used it as the base. I kind of combined it with Chef John's recipe, but I preferred this one as it was more simple. I did make a couple modifications. I cooked half beef and half sausage. I substituted fresh onion and garlic for the powdered. I did put a bit of cumin and cayenne pepper, but not enough to make it noticeable. I also added parmesan cheese. Yum!

I do cut my peppers lengthwise, which allows for easy filling and equal cooking time. Loved all the ingredients in the recipe and added some Italian blend cheese in the meat mixture as well as on the top. Added a 15oz can of tomato sauce to the bottom, covered with foil and baked at 375 for approx. 50 minutes until the peppers pierced easily.  Thank You for Sharing.

Flavorless recipe, not enough sauce to “baste” peppers. One hour is not long enough for peppers to become tender, especially with the lack of liquid. I would add at least another can of sauce or even diced tomatoes. Wouldn’t make this again.

I made it with 4 red bell peppers sliced in half lengthwise.   Also used a 24 oz jar of tomato sauce.  Baked for 45 minutes covered with foil.  And then topped them with a little bit of shredded mozzarella.  Turned out really good and moist.  The pepper was the right texture, soft but still a little bit firm and not mushy.

I used 3 green and 3 sweet peppers (orange, yellow, and red),  1 1/2 lbs of hamburger, and 2 cups of cooked rice.  I added shredded cheddar to the mixture before stuffing the peppers.  I did not baste every 15 minutes.  Instead I spooned the seasoned tomato sauce into the casserole pan before adding the peppers, then spooned the leftover mixture into the extra space in the pan.  I baked for 30 minutes, then topped the peppers with shredded cheddar, loosely covered with foil, and baked for the remaining 30 minutes.  They were not dry at all!  I will definitely make this again!

These were fantastic.  Made no changes to the recipe ingredients but I did cover the peppers for the first 45 minutes instead of basting. The peppers were cooked perfectly.

This is a good basic stuffed pepper recipe. I made minor changes. I added garlic and onion to the meat mixture and also blanched the peppers before stuffing them. I covered with foil so I did not base although it didn’t seem to have anything to baste with. Just before taking out of the oven I removed the foil and added sliced provolone cheese to each pepper.

I followed the directions to the tee and they turned out wonderful!  I think the only thing I will do differently next time is add some sort of topping that will add a bit of a crunch.

Made this last night .  I used about half pizza sauce (needed to get rid of it) and half tomato sauce, and then followed to recipe using red peppers.  This turned out great and was enjoyed by all.

My family loved this, even my 8,6, and 4 year olds! Instead of Italian seasoning I just added some Basil, Oregano and other spices. I also used the seasoned tomato sauce in the ground beef mix.

I added a can of Rotel spiced it up. Brown beef with a bit of onion and garlic. Mixed all together with cooked rice. Put tomato sauce on the bottom and on top of each half pepper. Covered with foil. Delicious

So yummy! This recipe is great to make in the morning before work, then just stick in the oven when you get home. 
I just added one chopped onion and 1 tbsp garlic and cooked them with the beef.

My entire family, kids included, loved this recipe!!! I've made a few different stuffed peppers recipes from this site and this one is simple and so delicious! I try to stick to the original recipe, so the only change I made was fresh garlic (1 small clove) instead of garlic powder and I added an extra 8 oz can of tomato sauce (with Italian spices added) on top of the stuffed peppers. I might make more filling next time. This was definitely enough to fill 6 halves, but I would've liked a little more in each pepper. Had leftovers the next day and they were even better!

This is my BF's favorite meal... He RAVES over them!!  I didn't change a thing the first time... I do add ''shredded cheddar cheese'' to the meat mixture before I stuff the pepper's.. I don't disgard the cut-off tops tho... I just put it on top of the peppers, add water, then cover with foil for an hour... no basting required... VOILA, a meal for a KING!!

This is a great started recipe but after mixing the filling together me and my husband decided that it still tasted kinda bland. We ended up adding more of the spices until it tasted better. Otherwise it's a great and easy to follow recipe.

I will definitely make this again! I suggest doubling the tomato sauce to make extra pan drippings for the mashed potatoes that you should make to go with the stuffed peppers.

very good recipe but I added more herbs and spices than what is called because the rice made the stuffing bland. I also like a crunchy pepper so I baked it for 30 min at 350 degrees and wrapped the bottom with foil to keep the moisture in.

This tasted great! I added some frozen sweet corn and chopped up cabbage to the mixture the second time I made it in place of some of the rice since I used leftover rice from a previous meal which wasn't enough and I didn't feel like spending 20 mins making more. Both versions were very good!

Loved it! Only modifications I made was using steak sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce (silly me hadn't checked the pantry before the grocery run) and adding cheese during the last few minutes of baking. I will use this recipe again, we loved it!

I made this recipe as is but i use red peppers only. I also use a combination of marinara and strained tomatoes for the sauce. Also sometimes I add matchstick carrots for additional flavour and sweetness.

Not nearly as flavorful as I will make next time. I'll add onions and garlic sautéed before I brown the hamburger meat with it. I'll also definitely skip the Italian seasoning in the basting sauce and add more of the onion/garlic powder. Overall all 5 of us ate and enjoyed it!

Would add more rice for a firmer body.  This recipe was too loose.  Overall flavor good.  Used red, green and yellow peppers.  Blanch first.  Also, make more filling as pepper size varies.  Was short on filling about 1 C. for 6 large peppers.
Also covered w foil and did not baste.  Very tender.

I made these except I used buckwheat instead of ground beef and increased the spice levels.  I covered w/ foil and didn't baste. Added shredded cheddar at the end. It was great! So close to what mom made and no one would know it is buckwheat instead of ground beef!

As stated before, this is a very good base recipe for stuffed peppers.  I used my own variation of things I liked in my peppers, but a very good base line.  I did not use 6 peppers....I used 4 very large peppers which was the perfect amount for the mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making this again.

I only cooked 5 peppers and there was barely enough meat mixture. There was no juice to baste with and the peppers were still crunchy after cooking an hour. I will not make this again. Kids hated it. I didn't like it either.

My family thought they were dry. I spooned the sauce over the peppers before baking, but there was no liquid to baste them, like the recipe said. Continuing my search for a great stuffed pepper recipe.

This was a great recipe although I'd try to simplify it next time to save time and dishes! I did blanch the peppers for 2 minutes before cooking and made a few small substations. I doubled the garlic (the more the better!). I used one can of tomato sauce in the beef broth sauce and also added a little white wine and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. I also used a half pound of chorizo instead of Italian sausage and brown rice instead of white. They were delicious and made 10 peppers with plenty of filling in each! I will be making this again, thanks for the recipe!

It was good, simple enough and don't be afraid to Doctor it to your tastes. Picture shows cheese melted on top but recipe doesn't call for any. I used red, orange and yellow peppers they were much sweeter than green peppers would be. 
Going to make again with variations.

This was so very delicious! The best ever. The only thing I did was add condensed tomato soup to the meat mixture and left out the onion powder. Plus I cooked my rice separately and add Lipton onion soup mix to the water I cooked my rice in. I have made stuffed bell peppers before but this was by far the best ever. My husband was scrapping the plate!

This is a classic preparation. I like to throw mine over charcoal for fifteen minutes to give them that smoky grilled flavor then toss in the oven.

Good basic recipe.  Had to add some water half-way through cooking to bottom of pan, which helped steam the green peppers.  There didn't seem to be enough tomato sauce.

Vegetarians: I tried something different as I was making my adult son butter chicken at the same time. I used the butter chicken seasoning from grocery store (kitchens of India) brand, put in some chick peas, olives, artichoke, onion and Jasmine rice. Blanched my peppers and baked. so good...

I used Tony Chachere's Cajun mix for flavor.

I made this as directed but the filling tasted very blah. I added some leftover jarred spaghetti sauce from my fridge and it helped. It still wasn't anything to write home about but it served its purpose.

Wahla.....recipes are about creativity... Being creative is not mean to be insulting to the originator..  I tried the originally and of course, had to put my own spin on things..  I sauté garlic, and onion, then add minced lamb, brown it with aged balsamic, red wine vinegar, a tad of mustard and 1/2 tsp of tomato paste.,  add onion powder, dried Italian seasoning, fresh parsley, fresh basil, fresh seranno chill., red pepper flakes, S&P.. don't let it get dry, this makes a nice broth in itself( the couscous will absorb so no need to worry.. . if you need it wet just add a little water. , once done, I toss in fresh diced tomatoes , and couscous.. stuff peppers and put in a baking dish bath, crumbled a little feta while baking.. when done.. I add fresh feta and more diced tomatoes...   Deliciosa!

Great recipe. I gave 4 stars as I did change a little. I used brown rice. Added 1 can diced tomatoes to a jar of sauce. I used real onion and minced garlic that I sauteed and added to the meat. Added some basil and oregano as well. I cooked covered for 40 mins and then topped with mozzarella cheese and cooked another 10 uncovered. So yummy.

I made these stuffed peppers and they were very good!! I was pressed for time, so while I prepared the stuffing- I put the cleaned bell peppers to steam upside-down in a large pot with about a quarter cup of water and a colander inside. I did this to tendorize them. I continued to prepare the peppers as directed, but added diced onions and fresh garlic to the meat. I served the peppers on top of heated red chili beans (canned - no meat). I placed a nice garden salad on the side and some warm bakery fresh French bread.

I blanched the peppers, covered tops with sauce and covered with tin foil.  Cooked for an hour, sprinkled with cheese and put back in over until the cheese melted.  Very delicious!  Will make again for sure.

We loved this dish. Very easy to prepare. Took the advice from a reviewer and had it covered during cooking. Used a Dutch oven, no need to baste. In the last five minutes, added cheddar and mozzarella cheese and it was great. We did add ketchup because it lacked a bit of sweetness.

When I made this I used yellow and orange peppers instead of the green. Also I took out the ground beef and substituted mushrooms. It tasted wonderful and the family loved it.

Great flavor. I blanched peppers first, and browned meat with seasonings. Cooks much faster so you are not heating up the house on a hot summer day!

Easy, simple, delicious recipe! I'll make this again. Loved the filling, but the bell peppers were still to crunchy after an hour in the oven. I added 1/2 diced onion when I browned the ground beef because I was all out of onion powder. Next time I'll blanch the bell peppers beforehand.

This is a good base starter recipe. I did have to change things somewhat as we tend to like more flavor and as is this is a bit bland. I added additional garlic, smoked paprika, Italian seasoning salt and pepper as well as some basil and adobe. I topped with mozzarella and parmesan cheese. I did cover with foil while in the oven  as suggested by other reviews. But I will be making this again and use more sauce as we like to put sauce in bottom of baking dish and top peppers with additional sauce..

My family loves this recipe!!!  The only thing I changed was the cook time.  I bake them for 45 minutes.  The peppers stay crunchy and that adds awesome texture and flavor.

This was so easy and sooooo good! I added a little water to the bottle of the pan and covered them for the hour. Sprinkled some shredded mozzarella over each and uncovered for about 5 minutes to melt the cheese and brown the meat a little bit! DELISH!

I've made these twice now, and they're delicious. The second time I used brown rice to make it healthier, and I couldn't tell a taste difference from the first time. I've used lean ground beef both times and skipped the Worcestershire sauce simply because I didn't have any. First time I used a variety of bell peppers, and the second time just green -- no complaints either time! Both times they were topped with Mozzarella cheese when there was about 10-15 minutes left, which I think is a nice touch. The leftovers heat up nicely, which is a definite plus.

Will definitely make this again! A yummy low calorie meal! There was not nearly enough sauce to baste it while cooking. I just topped each pepper with the sauce, there wasn't any to go in the bottom of the pan after that. The only change I would make is to salt the peppers before stuffing them. They were a little bland compared to the stuffing. But overall still a delicious meal for such little calories.

Super easy, came out well. Used Italian sweet sausage instead of ground beef, and to make it again, I'd put some cheese on top and maybe yield 5 peppers instead of 6.

Excellent flavor. I followed previous reviews and blanched the peppers before baking and I covered the peppers for the first 45 min. I didn't need to baste. Delicious.

I couldn't help but put about a tablespoon of Brown Sugar in the topping mix.  This is a hit with me for sure.  I cut the recipe in half and used 7halves of Orange, Yellow, Red, and Green peppers - cut sideways.  Topped with fresh grated Parmesan cheese the last 15 minutes of cooking.  My Godmother loved them!

I have been making these for years.  I put mine in a crockpot, the kitchen smells heavenly.  I use regular instant rice.  The rest is the same.  But, I add a can of tomato soup instead of tomato sauce.  I add 1/3 can of water.  The sauce is thin and a great flavor.

I have made this many times and added a little spin in it. I used more seasonings and just whatever I could find around my house. I ran out of tomato sauce and used ketchup instead and it worked great! Will definitely be making this again and again!

I made this recipe but used ground turkey instead. I also used 2 more 8 ounce cans of tomato sauce and they turned out amazing. I like a little crunch to my peppers so I baked them for 30 minutes instead of the hour and some minutes called for. Delicious!!

The flavor was good however next I will make a few changes. The peppers should be parboiled and more sauce and rice should be added. I also topped mine with mozarella cheese.

I used this recipe as as a base.
Instead of ground beef,  ~ground turkey~ 
Instead of white rice, ~brown wild rice mix~
instead of tomato sauce, ~diced tomatoes~ 
added diced onions & diced garlic, instead of powered ones, 
used red & yellow peppers, instead of green peppers~
baked old white chedder cheese on top, yum !!!

I followed the recipe as is except I didn't read that you were supposed to base the peppers in sauce every 15 minutes while it was baking in the oven. The meat inside of the green pepper was really good! My daughter loved the meat and rice. However, the green pepper could have been softer, so maybe keeping it in the oven a little longer?

Loved it! We blanched the peppers, added cumin and minced garlic to the beef. We also added olive oil, this helped keep the mixture creamy after adding the rice.

I blanched the peppers as others suggested, and used red, yellow, and orange peppers. I also cut them in half lengthwise to get two servings from one pepper. To make it lighter, I used ground turkey and brown rice, and I included some corn. I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, and I mixed it into the meat, corn, and rice instead of pouring it over top of the peppers. They were delicious.

I loved how well this recipe cooked up except for the sauce. I didn't feel it covered enough. Otherwise the stuffing was good and I think I can defiantly tweak this more next time.

Added some diced green pepper from the tops into the stuffing. I also had an extra fresh tomato that I diced and put inside, as well as fresh slices on the top while in the oven. The tomato slices on top were delicious! I also had a little low sodium V8 that I used to stretch the sauce that went on top of the peppers. The recipe was very yummy. Will make again.

I will definitely will make this version again. the only change would be to add diced onions when the meat is browning. Also cooking in tomato sauce instead of water.

I rated this with 5 stars cuz I love All Recipes :) I cooked the rice as directed, added some mozzarella, dash of Worcestershire, Parmesan and small can Rotel to the rice. Used cooked mild sausage instead of ground beef. Shredded some sharp cheese on the bottom of the pepper before adding the rice mixture then added more shredded sharp and mozzarella before baking.

Taste was awesome. I used yellow, orange, and red peppers instead of green, made for a nice change. I'd probably use a bit more sauce at the end to put on top of the filled peppers, but realized at the end that I should have just put a dollop of sauce on each filled peppers instead of pouring over all of them. When I made the filling it made 8 halves (4 whole) peppers.

Great basic recipe.  I made it first as listed. (It is unfair to rate something, Nor is it fair to suggest changes, unless you have made it as written.)  2nd time I made adjustments to my tastes:
Seasonings are always as needed when I cook, so amounts will be different every time.  I added about 1/2 freshly grated parmesan into the mix (for taste), also 1 can diced tomatoes (adds flavor and texture). I did cover with foil while baking (so no basting).  I used a generous giant pinch of fresh grated parmesan on top of each pepper about 10-15 mins before serving (removed foil before doing so).  Otherwise followed recipe.  There was plenty of sauce even for my husband he likes a lot.  Over all, give recipe a chance first so you know what might  improve taste, don't just base on what others wrote....plenty of recipes ruined that way.

YUM YUM! I substituted meat with ground Elk, added diced onions while browning meat, tsp(ish) of minced garlic, big pinch of cayenne pepper & few dashed of crushed red pepper flakes. I used all ingredients listed (except beef) and added extra of all seasonings. I blanched green peppers for 3-5mins && they were too soft once cooked, next time I will skip blanching & add little extra water. I skipped basting & compensated by covering with foil.  **YES I will make again!!

I love this recipe!  The only thing I do differently is turn it into a casserole.  I make the filling but add 3 chopped peppers, spread it in a casserole dish and bake.  My kids, who don't like stuffed peppers, love this version of it!

As is it was a bit bland. I will add some additional spiced next time.  It also could use a couple more cams of sauce if you like it saucy. Overall it was good and would make again.

Blanching the peppers is a must. They came out perfect this way - otherwise I pretty much stuck to the recipe. I used venison instead of beef and it came out great - I also cooked the meat prior to filling and added cheese. Very yummy!

Seasoning was inadequate. I didn't care for the Italian seasoning in this; I might try a Creole seasoning instead.  There was inadequate sauce for the recipe and it was too thick.  I think blanching teh peppers first would yield a better result. Cheese would also be an improvement.

I absolutely love this recipe. It's is simple and cheap and you can add whatever you want! I have made this recipe countless times and I change it every time because I love to experiment. Sometimes I add cheese, onion, garlic, mushrooms, different seasonings. I always add 3x the Italian seasoning and 2x the sauce. I just mix everything together without separating the sauce, and I end up cooking it for an extra 20 to 30 minites with cheese on top. It's the perfect base recipe to make on a whim and add a countless variety of extras. It's a favorite at my house. People who rated this recipe low just do not know how to "season to taste."

Next time I will pre-cook the peppers a bit by boiling them as others have suggested because they were still crispy in the lower parts but overall it was pretty good.  I made this dish with ground venison and added some chopped onion, minced garlic, and chopped mushrooms to the meat as it was browning.  I used brown rice instead of white and added 1/2 cup of lentils to the rice.  I omitted the onion and garlic powders but kept the rest of the seasonings and sauce true to the recipe.  The flavor was good, I just would've preferred the peppers to be a little softer and more consistent (the tops of the peppers cooked great but the middle and bottoms were still crispy).  I'll also try some red and orange peppers next time for some variety.

Good, but if you add 1 inch of water to the pan & cover with foil, you don't have to baste.  If you mix dry ingredients into meat before browning, increases taste throughout instead of typical ground beef.

Followed the recipe except I used turkey burger. It was easy and delicious. Next time I would use more sauce to pour on top since there really wasn't enough to use for basting. The peppers came out tender, I cooked an additional 10 mins over the hour. Picture shows cheese on it though it isn't mentioned in the recipe. We did add some mozzarella for the last 15 mins. Great recipe!

With a few simple modifications this recipe is 5 stars! Because my family isn't fans of green peppers we used sweet - and they turned out great! After cutting the tops off and seeding the peppers, I boiled them for 5 min so they wouldn't end up too crunchy. As directed, I did use onion powder to make the "gravy" but for the beef mixture I instead diced & sautéed a small onion and (I used fresh garlic too). I added a large tin of diced tomatoes (unstrained) to the beef mixture and substituted the tomato sauce for a 24 oz jar of passata - I put half the jar in the beef mixture and saved half to make the "gravy". I also grated 1 cup of cheddar cheese and melted it over the peppers (uncovered) when they were finished cooking. My husband said it could've done with more cheese though, even throughout the peppers. Something to try for next time!

I used mild Italian sausage which doesn't contain as much grease. I also instead of using tomatoe sause I used "Dei Fratelli" spaghetti sauce I added a little extra of the onion seasoning (1/4 tsp) and Italian seasoning (1/4) My one son doesn't like peppers so I carved out hard rolls leaving a space in the center to place the mixture. Inside the opened hard roll I buttered it and added garlic salt. Covered and baked with the mixture for 25 minutes. This would make a great snack for any game, just slice and eat!

Thought these were pretty good.  I used leftover rice from previous night and then made fresh ground beef.  Needed a bit of seasoning though, thought it was a bit bland.  Good basic recipe that you can then tweak with your own seasonings.

This was much better as a leftover than it was the night we made it.   We used one can of tomato sauce and one can of stewed tomatoes, other than that we made it as written.  Had I rated this the other night, I would have only given it one star, but we had one leftover and my husband and I share it tonight.  The flavors blended, and it tasted like the stuffed peppers my mom used to make when I was a kid.  We will make this again, refrigerate it and eat it the next day.

simple meal to make. I used organic ground turkey and pre-made Spanish rice in place of the ground meat and white rice. I also added shredded cheese which made it super yummy :)

Perfect tasting stuffed peppers, enjoyed by the whole family. I liked not having to blanch the peppers before stuffing them. I've always thought it made them too soft. One thing I did different was to leave some space at the top of the pepper. After they cooked about 50 minutes, I added shredded mozzarella on top and baked another ten minutes.

I always use lamb for my stuffed pepper, it is just a personal choice.  I mix the lamb and rice and seasonings together with tomato sauce.  I stuffed the peppers, put them in the bottom of a sauce pan with a steamer gadget and just enough water to cover top of steamer.  I bring the water to a boil and then turn it down to low.  Cook pepper until rice is done.  No need to cook beef and rice before hand. Delicious

1 hour bake time was way too long. 
I used couscous instead of rice,  ground chicken instead of beef,  pasta sauce instead of tomato, and red peppers. 
Came out pretty good.

I tried this recipe almost exactly as described. The only change that I made was boiling the peppers before I filled and baked them. I am no chef, but I can follow a recipe. These peppers came out wayyyyy too undercooked. It was like eating a raw pepper and there was absolutely no flavor. It would have been even worse if I did not boil the peppers. 

My husband and I were highly disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but felt it was necessary on this one. I would not make again.

This was great, a nice comforting meal for winter. Instead of ground beef, I had a package of ground pork and bacon that I used (yum!) in addition to brown rice, minced onion and minced garlic. I cut the recipe down to two servings, but used all of the 15 ounce can of tomato sauce and added shredded colby jack cheese on top for the last five minutes of baking time. I'll be making this again soon!

I made this last night.  It's a good recipe, but I made some changes, hence the four stars.  First, I used red peppers instead of green, just for different flavor (and they had a great sale going on).  I doubled the mixture because these peppers were huge.  I ended up using an extra can of sauce which I mixed with a little water.  This made it easier to baste them. After about 1/2 hour I covered the baking dish with aluminum foil to retain heat and soften the peppers.  One of the other reviewers wrote that she layered cheese in the peppers, so I did that. They turned out pretty good!  They're even better the next day. Next time I'll blanch the peppers before filling so that they will be softer.  Good recipe, Thanks for sharing.

Good basic recipe which I tweaked to save time and preparation.  I used brown rice, uncooked, and did not brown the meat.  I mixed those together with uncooked chopped onion and garlic (to taste) along with the Worcestershire sauce.  I stuffed two red peppers and 2 small poblanos, which I sliced horizontally. I used 1 can of tomato sauce mixed with 1 can of diced tomatoes seasoned with Italian seasonings.  Pour enough of the sauce to cover the bottom of the pan (8 x 8) and the rest pour over the top of the peppers.  Bake for 1 1/2 hrs. covered, basting every 1/2 hour.  I uncovered it and baked it for an additional half hour.  They were very tender and flavorful with the additional cooking and the rice perfectly cooked with the basting.

My husband loves his mother's stuffed pepper recipe.  It calls for tomato juice laced with brown sugar for basting.  She cooks hers on top of the stove.  I made half of this recipe.  I made some changes: I added 2-3 T. of brown sugar to the stuffing, used crushed tomatoes because my local grocery store doesn't carry tomato sauce (the consistency is fairly close), used brown rice instead of white, put all of the tomatoes in with the meat and rice before stuffing, and covered the peppers with their tops for baking.  I wish that I had followed someone's suggestion of blanching the peppers first.  I didn't feel like the pepper was cooked enough which is why I gave this recipe a 4 instead of a 5.  My husband was satisfied with the sweetness of the stuffing with the little bit of brown sugar added.  The sweetness was pretty light actually.  I believe that sugar is added to tomato sauce, but not to crushed tomatoes, so what I added may have been just enough to make up the difference.  The ground beef that I buy is quite lean, so I never drain it after cooking.  I used some leftover rice that I had in my freezer, so I thought this recipe was quick and easy.  My husband (the dishwasher) was pleased that I didn't dirty a lot of pots in making this.

This recipe is good for a starting point. I used more onion and garlic powder than called for. I eyeballed my measurements but I used about a tsp of each. I also did not baste as there is not enough sauce as the recipe is written for basting. They are fine without basting and the sauce on top of each pepper. I also top with cheese because well, cheese makes everything better.

Please pre cook the beef/pork as I did a 50 50 mix of each.  Not done at all at 350 after an hour.I got caught up by the use of fresh herbs and real onion and garlic.  Giving it a rating of 4.

I browned and seasoned my beef along with sautéed onion and then added corn, tomatoes and Cayanne pepper to the rice mixture before putting it in the peppers. Made garlic bread to go with.

Made this for my family today and we really liked it.  My hubs and I both thought that the Italian seasoning should have been mixed in with the meat (that would have given it 5 stars for us).  We also sauteed 1/4 onion in a bit of butter, and added the ground beef to that (and omitted the onion powder).  I probably should have used fresh garlic as well--maybe next time.  And I drained the grease from the meat before mixing the beef+onions with the rice.  I topped off the peppers with Mozzarella cheese, and did not add the last 8 oz of tomato sauce.  Will definitely make again!!

These were great! I altered the recipe a lot though. I used crumbled veggie protein instead of ground beef and I added avocado and subbed steak sauce for the Worcester sauce (b/c I didn't have any).  I also only cooked it for 20 minutes because I was soooo hungry!  All in all a great lunch!

I really do like this recipe because it really is quite simple. I have added canned diced tomatoes to my rice and meat mixture which we like very much. I also tend to make mine meatier  since my husband isn't the biggest rice fan. Excellent taste with this recipe!!

This recipe was very basic and not very flavorful.  I also thought the amount of Italian seasoning in the tomato sauce was overpowering.  I will not make this again.

Loved it.  I made two green two red and two yellow peppers. Took some of the eatable part of the tops, chopped them with half onion. Then before put them in the oven I added some shredded cheese on top. 

Oh My God!!!!!!!

I add onions & celery which I sauté separate from the meat (I use turkey to make it healthier). I also split my peppers in half and fill them right in the pan. Like one of the other reviews, I cover when I cook and for the last 5 minutes sprinkle parmesan cheese on top. Really is yummy!!

I knew I didn't want 2 cans of tomato sauce so used one which made it perfect for us and only used half the amount of cooked rice. Followed the recipe otherwise. Lastly, I topped with sharp cheddar when almost done. I will use red peppers next time.

Great recipe! The only change I made was to blanche the peppers before cooking to soften them. Otherwise it was flavorful and a crowd pleaser. Next time I will add a layer of cheese to the peppers when stuffing it but overall delicious.

This recipe was very good. I doubled the stuffing recipe as I used my garden fresh extra large abnormal shaped peppers. I cut them on the sides as they lay nice and flat that way. I had extra mixture left so I just used the sliced side of pepper pieces and filled them with stuffing and ate them cold for a snack. Delicious. Tasty idea for an appetizer!!!

I added more spices to get more flavor and a little more sauce. I also added diced peppers and tomatoes to the meat+rice+sauce mixture to add more flavor and a little crunch. I also did a mixture of green, red and yellow peppers as each have their own distinct flavor so that each family member could have whichever suits them best.

I used ground hot-n-spicy sausage in place of the ground beef and eliminated all spices except salt and pepper. I used left-over homemade marinara in place of tomato sauce, and mixed it with the rice for the bottom layer. Add a spoonful of canned corn on top of that. Mix the meat, more marinara, extra rice and salt and pepper and spoon into the peppers. Cover, bake and for the last 5 minutes, uncover, add some mozzarella cheese and finish:)

I followed the recommendation of one reviewer to blanch the peppers and I sprinkled monterey jack cheese on the peppers during the last 5 minutes of cooking time. I used arborio rice instead of regular long grain.  They were delicious :) I am fairly new at cooking and this was easy for me to do.  My husband wants this to be one of our regular meals.

Absoulutely Delicious!  The whole family loved these, might even add some corn next time.  Added about 1 tbsp cheese to each one before topping with seasoned tomato sauce and the cheese melted down and made it fantastic.  Def a keeper.

This was big hit with my two daughters (4, 11) and my husband who said it was the best stuffed pepper he'd ever eaten!  I followed the recipe almost exactly - but I had started following a different recipe first (then learned it was using condensed tomato soup - 2 cans!? so I quit)...I had already chopped about a 1/2 cup of vidalia onion and cooked it while browning the beef...Then, I used a bit more than 1/4 tsp garlic and onion powder - I never measure that stuff...I just sprinkle around the top of whatever Im making then mix it in...Also, I boiled the peppers for about 3-5 min before stuffing them - bake time gets reduced to about 30 min. I also sprinkled the top with parmesan cheese after I poured the sauce/Italian seasoning over all the stuffed peppers, just before baking. I also forgot to baste but I don't think it impacted the taste or moisture level...Lastly, I did not discard the tops! I chopped them up (except the stems, haha) and put it in the freezer for tacos, soups, or otherwise...Enjoy!

Made it again tonight - added a chopped up fresh Roma tomato and a handful of spinach (that I allowed to wilt in the bowl after adding browned meat), and my husband and I like food with a kick so I chopped up 1 jalepeno pepper and added it to the mix (after stuffing the peppers for the girls). YUM

Needs more seasoning than indicated. I added cheddar cheese and parmesan. I also blanched the peppers before baking as suggested by others. cost is about $2 per pepper when finished. Good food.

I sauté onions and dice plum tomatoes as well (a good alternative if not using tomato sauce). I also added sharp provolone cheese in my mixture and used sausage this time vs. ground meat.

Made recipe as written.  Bland. Definitely needs more flavor.  And I read several reviews saying to thin out the tomato sauce that is poured over the top.  I did NOT do that as I was sticking to the original recipe. I SHOULD HAVE done that! It was too thick and started to burn on the bottom, so I had to add water to the bottom of the pan.  

I won't make this again.

I am going to try this recipe, but here's my changes: I'm going to cook the rice about 1/2 way done, because cooking it completely, and then cooking it in the oven for an hour makes me worry that it'll be overcooked, and overcooked rice is nasty. I'm going to sub half the ground beef for sausage, I'm going to replace the tomato sauce for a chunky, homemade salsa type mixture that I make. And then I'm going to blanch the peppers beforehand. I'm estimating about half an hour max in the oven will be perfect.

I agree in that there was not enough extra sauce to use for basting. I opted to use seasoned stewed tomatoes as extra sauce. Worked really well! Next time I will blanch or steam them first.

Easy and delicious!  I followed the ingredients list except that I used brown instead of white rice.  I also sprinkled some cheddar cheese on the peppers for the last 10 minutes in the oven.  (The recipe photo shows cheese on top.)  I baked my peppers covered which steamed the peppers as they were baking.  Will make again and possibly add mushrooms and actual onion i/o onion powder.

This is how I have always made stuffed peppers, except I use different colored peppers and leave off the italian seasoning.

Added an onion, garlic and Italian seasoning to meet.  Used Mozzarella and Trader Joe sauce.  Very good.  Probably would have been very bland without the additions.

Excellent.  I made this with red peppers, since I much prefer them over green peppers when cooked.  The filling was just the right amount with a little extra rice added in.  I didn't have the time, but I would recommend cooking the meat with garlic and onions mentioned in other reviews; my meat was a little bland.

Great starter recipe! I tweaked it a little to modify what I had on hand. Instead of tomato sauce I used tomato paste and half a can of tomato soup. I also added a whole onion while cooking the meat and fresh minced garlic, as others suggested. I used the remaining can of tomato soup mixed with water as the sauce to pour over the top. This cooked nicely covered with foil for almost a full hour. No need to pre-cook the peppers, mine came out perfect!

Very good!  Very close to my mom's version (she's on vacation, so I had to find a different recipe).  Dad and my hubby really liked it.  I didn't bake mine, I steamed them.  I also had to use a can of crushed tomatoes because that was all I had. :)  We always have fresh garlic and onions on hand, so I used those instead of dried.

This was very good! I blanched the peppers in boiling water first which reduced my cooking time to 30 minutes. I also used only an 8oz can of tomato sauce and about a cup of pasta sauce. I baked a separate dish of just the stuffing mix, because I knew my kids wouldn't eat the peppers. Topped with motzerella cheese and cooked for 5 additional minutes.

I used poblano peppers and substituted ground cabrito for beef and queso blanco for rice.  I skipped the tomato sauce and breaded and deep fried the stuffed peppers.  Love this recipe!

Great base of a recipe.  I modified it quite a bit.  I sauteed the onions and garlic until carmalized, then browned the beef, which added several spices to, INCLUDING CUMIN, which I think gave gave it more depth.  I mixed the tomato sauce with spices and more garlic (I love garlic! lol).  I added all the tomato sauce at once, then stuffed the peppers.  Cooked covered, then removed 10 min before finish, and topped with cheese.  DELISH!!

These were very good!  I used instant rice, a little extra tomato sauce, no onion powder or italian seasoning (did not have any).  I think next time I will use half the worcestershire sauce - I thought the taste was a little much and would have liked a more tomato sauce taste.  Also, I cooked these covered for about 45 minutes.

I really enjoy a basic recipe w/ no special ingredients.   This recipe fit nicely.  I substituted commercial marinara sauce for lack of canned tomato sauce.  I also added a little water to the bottom of the baking pan which helped moisten the pepper.  I hate to throw food away, so I diced up the tops of the peppers and sautéed them with onions to use in in another recipe.  When I prepare this dish again I plan to cook a slice of tomato tot he top.

This recipe is wonderful. For a different flavor profile, I use dirty rice (zatarans), and I top it with beef gravy.  You can also add red beans.

This is an easy recipe! I used instant rice to cut the prep time, and since I had no ground beef on hand, I used an angus beef burger patty that I cooked in the microwave for a couple of minutes then ground it in the food processor. I also used Italian sausage flavored spaghetti sauce. I will be making this simple recipe again!

I used the red peppers and did blanch them first.  Also, since they were long, cut them in half lengthwise.

Very good! My peppers were large, so I had to make up ;more filling the first time. Second time, I planned accordingly and just increased everything. They turned out fine. I used about 1/2 barley with the rice (I like barley) and spiced up the burger with a bit of beef bouillon. Didn't baste. Covered with foil during baking, and while the peppers were still a little bit crisp, they were tasty and good--we liked them that way.  I topped them under the broiler for a few minutes, after adding a good sprinkle of parmesan.  Will make more and freeze, for February (have lots of peppers).

these were really good! my family suggested that the peppers were a little tough so i don't know if the cooking time is too fast or if i just wasn't basting properly.  and the only other thing was that the call for peppers is more than what the recipe makes.  it makes about 3 overstuffed peppers.  but overall...FABULOUS thanks :-)

Good recipe. I substituted CHICKEN in for it and worked great! I had to change amounts of things though: I added more rice but by doing that I had to decrease the amount of sauce. I also didn't put any worcestershire sauce. I didn't wait an hour for them to cook but I recommend doing it if you want to avoid crunchy peppers. Overall, good!

Very good recipe!  I usually like a thinner tomatoe sauce with stuffed peppers, but it was good for a change!  I also added a little more rice, I used 3/4 cup jasmine rice.  Just a personal preferance.  It makes it a little bit lighter for a summer dinner.

Not bad. Instead of the powdered garlic and onion, I just added the real thing.  Forgot the Worcestershire sauce, but that didn't really make that much of a difference.  I also used tomato paste because I read the recipe wrong and just added a bit of water to thin it out some. Ground turkey was used instead of beef.  I'll make again.

I think that the recipe should call for the bell peppers to cook a little before you put the food in it because it seemed too crunchy.

I asolutely love this recipe!  I have been looking fo years for the right stuffed pepper recipe and I could never find one that we really loved.  I am so glad we have found it.  Too reduce cooking time I have submerged the green peppers for 5 minutes in boiling water and then put them in the oven for 35-40 minutes and the peppers are perfect.

Great recipe. Nice flavor. I learned from my mother-in-law that there is no need to pre-blanch or precook anything when cooking stuffed peppers on top of the stove. Just mix rice and meat; stuff the peppers and put them in a pot on the stove to simmer. As long as you have enough liquid (in which case, you do need to modify this to include more), everything cooks up wonderfully.

This is a good, basic recipe that will probably produce what your mom made in the 50's-60's.  The ingredients filled 6 medium sized peppers perfectly.  One thing I did differently was to lay parchment paper over the tops of the peppers and then cover with foil while cooking, so the peppers would steam. There wasn't enough sauce to baste every 15 minutes anyway.  The consistency was perfect and my husband and I enjoyed our dinner, thank you.

Good recipe. Followed it without deviating. Found that I didn't have enough tomato sauce at the end - only enough to pour a little on top of each pepper - certainly not enough to baste.

I didn't care for it.  There is definetly not enough sauce.  My 11 month old really liked the stuffing and my husband thought they were good which is what makes it 3 stars instead of 2.  I have made better peppers before.

Very good and easy to prepare.  I sauteed chopped onion along with the ground beef.  Also added fresh chopped tomatoes and fresh garlic to mixture.  Agree w/other reviewers that it needed a little more sauce. Will also blanche peppers next time as other review suggested.  Peppers came out with some "bite"...not bad, but a minute or two blanche would probably soften just a bit more "al dente".

I used ground turkey, red bell peppers, two cans of sauce (one isn't eneough),brown rice in a boil in bag.
(easier and healthier). I sauteed real garlic and onion first then added the turkey. I then added the oregano plus red (cayenne)pepper, oregano sauce,parmesan cheese and rice together .I wrapped them in one peice of foil befofre placing in roasting pan and
I only needed to cook them for 50 minutes. They were tender and delicious. my husband loved them.

hmmm... well this was okay as is. i made it a second time and since my family tends to choose maxican flavored foods i changed it for us and we liked it better. i cooked my rice then added it to the meat with some carne asada seasoning and garlic and onion powder. instead of plain tomato sauce (the first time we felt it was overpowering) i used mexican style stewed tomatoes that i pureed. i only put a little on top so it wouldnt overpower the meat and seasonings. it was good our way, but we didnt care for it the first time.

Absolutely delicious!! I added cheddar cheese on top and it worked perfectly with the dish. The next time I make this, I will put a little more cheese in the middle and the top of the pepper.

I added lots of fresh garlic, onion and fresh herbs.
I also used bulgar wheat instead of rice.  Very interesting, almost nutty taste!  MMMMMMM

A good base, but quite bland.  I would definately add more spice to it next time.  Also, it seemed like they were quite watery, I won't add the water next time.

Very good, the only thing I do differently is boil the peppers for approx. 5 minutes prior to stuffing and baking for a more tender pepper, and I add zucchini in.  After I brown the meat I throw some chopped up zucchini in.

Good stuffed pepper recipe.  Ive been spoiled with my eastern european mothers stuffed peppers...so it gets 4 stars. I blanched the peppers for 3 minutes...next time I will do it for five as i like the peppers soft.  I found that it also needs more sauce and seasoning.  I added shredded mozarella at the last 10 minutes of baking and it really was a nice touch.  Oh, and i also sauteed one small onion and three garlic cloves before browning the beef.  Definitely try that!! Leftovers tasted amazing the next day.  Will make again!

If your in a hurry a good way to prepare this recipe is to clean and cut up the peppers then cook them until tender in a microwave dish. Cook the rice for 20 minutes.  Cook the ground beef with worchestershire sauce and chopped onions, DRAIN and then mix all the ingredients together heat through and serve. I would add another 8 oz of tomato sauce or a can of diced tomatoes with liquid to this recipe. No need to bake in the oven.  Taste is the same.

Great Recipe - you will get rave reviews.  I would encourage a double batch of the sauce... it was very good.   I will plan on using this sauce the next time I make meatloaf as well.

These were good but nothing special. I felt like it needed more flavor.  I added real garlic and extra onion powder but it didn't really jazz it up like I hoped.  My husband and I ate them up and enjoyed but it just needed something else.

Wow! This recipe was a hit! I followed a lot of suggestions other posters had and the peppers were seasoned bautifully. I did the following:

used ground turkey instead of beef
sauteed one onion w/ garlic and added to stuffing
added some chili powder and paprika to the stuffing
doubled the worcester
used 25 oz of pasta sauce (1/2 in the stuffing and 1/2 on top)
used shredded cheddar cheese in the stuffing
baked covered w/ alum. foil and removed the last 10 minutes of baking

My husband loved this recipe and ate 2 in one sitting! He did suggest adding some cheese on the top. Next time I will probably do that in the last 10 minutes of baking.

Great starter recipe that you can play with. I used faux ground meat and as 25 oz. jar of mushroom pasta sauce, then added 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. basil, salt and pepper in medium bowl. I stuffed peppers and placed in crockpot and put tops back on. In separate bowl combined 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. basil, salt and pepper, and poured over stuffed peppers in crockpot. Heated on low for 4 hours, they are hot and tender when finished! Yummy vegetarian treat!

These were really good. I did add a some red pepper and paprika to give it some spice, and some diced onion for flavor (But mainly because I love onions). I also had some extra tomato sauce heated up to serve on the side. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was a really nice start since I have never made stuffed peppers before.  A little bland for my tastes, but I used ground turkey so that may have been part of the problem.  Next time I think I may try using a spicy spaghetti sauce instead.

When I have made stuffed peppers in the past, I have microwaved them, the chopped beef was raw, and the rice was Minute Rice.  I actually enjoyed this recipe, but I think I may go back to my old way....but thanks for sharing

excellent!!! the only changes i made were to drain the grease from the meat. I also used Rice-a-roni "spanish rice" instead of regular rice. it gives it alittle kick, and great flavor! when cooking the rice, omit the butter. I also cut up potatoes and placed them around the peppers and then poured the sauce over. it made a complete meal that everyone raved over!

Because I was in a hurry, I used a jar of Prego sauce instead.  I also steamed the peppers priot to stuffing to shorten the cooking time.  The family requested that I make this again soon.

Modified it a little to make it low-carb by skipping the rice and substituting it with a homemade stuffing mix.  DEEEELICIOUS.

I liked this recipe. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also used brown rice. Hubby loved it since it was his first time ever having this dish. I served them with bowties and homemade spaghetti sauce,and a tossed salad.

I should have read a bit more. I doubled the recipe and used the tomato sauce, but it wasn't nearly enough so I added a 15 oz of crushed tomatoes and there was still nothing to baste. After baking 1 1/2 hours the peppers were still tough and crunchy. I would definitely cover with foil so they can steam and hopefully give some sauce to the dish. My husband was pleased with the basic flavor.

Tasty recipe; I was more liberal with the use of spices... added fresh garlic and onions to the ground beef and red pepper flakes to the sauce. I also blanched the peppers beforehand per a previous reviewer, and only baked it for 30mins. It probably could have benefited with more time, but still an easy, tasty meal.  Bachelor friendly.

This wasn't my favorite. Even adding extra spices and fresh onions the meat didn't have very much flavor and there wasn't enough extra sauce to baste the peppers like the recipe suggested.

This was delicious.  I used red and yellow peppers instead of green and ground turkey instead of beef.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as is.  These came out great and I would definitely make this again.

These came out great.  I added a half a bag of frozen mixed vegetables which I threw in the frying pan after the meat came out, then chopped them up and threw them in the mix.  This way it was a balanced meal (with some bread and butter on the side).

I doctored things up a bit to enliven the taste.  Meat mix was half burger/half sausage.  Replaced half of the tomato sauce with salsa.  Yum!

These stuffed peppers tasted like stuffed peppers, so it was a successful recipe in that way. I blanched the peppers, and it kept them from being bitter. I liked the filling quite a bit, but did not eat much of the pepper... a filling meal, and one I would make once in a while. If you like stuffed peppers, you'll probably like this recipe.

I have a hard time rating this because I modified the recipe quite a bit... I boiled my peppers for 10 minutes or so to soften them and only baked them for 25 minutes to heat them through.  For the stuffing, I cooked Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice, browned turkey sausage, and mixed it up with my favorite pasta sauce (HEB brand, tomato and basil).  I didn't add a bit more seasoning, and it was just delicious.  With the frozen turkey sausage I usually keep in the freezer, pasta sauce and rice, the only ingredient I'll need to pick up from the store would be the green peppers.  Ingredients on hand + easy preparation + delicious dinner = a meal I will prepare often!

My husband and I love these peppers! Sometimes I substitute the white rice for wild rice, and I add a can of diced tomatoes. I always make sure to make plenty of sauce to pour over the top. I made these tonight and hubby says he can't get enough of them!

These peppers were really great - even better than my mom's!  I used ground sausage (sage flavour) in place of the beef and skipped the worcestershire sauce.  I cooked them covered in a dutch oven and there was no need to worry about basting.  The flavor was really amazing.  I will be making again and again!

My husband and I thought the taste was a bit off and on the bland side.  I believe it was off due to the worchestire sauce (first time we were ever cooking with it) and we didn't like it at all.  I think it's a good recipe and we would've enjoyed it a lot more without the worchestire sauce and added more spices/seasoning...will try again.  Thanks!

My entire family loved this recipe even my 3 boys that say they hate peppers.  The only thing that I did different was added the 2 8oz. cans of sauce and italian seasonings to the mix.  So then I did not bast the peppers every 15 min.

This recipe definitely tasted good.  Something for the whole family.  I used ground turkey instead of beef (less calories) and  added hot sauce into the pepper to jazz things up.

I sauted the top cuts of the peppers as well as mushrooms and onion and added them to the mix.  Doing this filled 5 HUGE peppers.

My husband really want stuff peppers and found this easy recipe but I didn't have tomatoe sauce so I used tomatoe soup and V8 which tasted good but I prefer a more tomatoey sauce so next time I will plan to have tomatoe sauce on hand.

My six year old LOVED this. since I made it she has asked for it 2 more times. It didnt "wow" me or my husband so I gave it only 4 stars, but it was kid friendly. Anything my daughter asks for more than once is 4 stars in my book.

This was just ok. I didn't change a thing. It was lacking a little something.  And the filling only filled 4 peppers.  I don't think I'd make this again.

I served this along side prime rib for a holiday meal. It was reaaly good. A bit runny though. Could probably use some bread crumbd to stiffen up the stuffing. But overall, the taste was wonderful.

I steamed my peppers until nearly tender then only had them in the oven for 20 min. instead of the 1 hour. A bit bland without the addition of a few more seasonings. A good traditional recipe.

This tastes great.  My only recommendation would be to use more tomato sauce to pour on top of the stuffed peppers.

This was a very good recipe.  The only thing I found was maybe to add some seasoning (Italian) into the meat mixture, but of course this is dependent on the audience.

I made this last night with a few minor changes.  I omitted the worcestershire sauce and added mozzarella cheese on top.  The peppers turned out very well.  My 4 yr old wouldn't eat them but she won't eat much these days.  lol  My husband really liked them and he's a picky eater.

I used this as a base recipe and altered it to be more mexican style. Seasoned ground beef with chili powder, cumin, etc. Mixed in corn. Served with salsa. Very good. thanks

We liked not cooking the Peppers so long. Only about 45 mins at about 375.

Peppers were cooked and still a little crisp like stir fry.

Very good Will cook again!!

Mediocre at best.  Funny taste. I should have saved my ground beef and peppers for something else.  Thank goodness I had a side dish and bread to save the meal!  Thanks though for sharing...

This is one of my husband's favorite meals now! It is a very forgiving recipe. Basting them is critical, it makes them so tender! Thanks!

This dish was very bland and my husband refused to eat it.  I ate 1 pepper and didn't like it much (needs more flavor!).

I made a few of the changes with this recipe as others suggested- such as using real onion and garlic instead of the salt version, I also parboiled the peppers.  This turned out to be wonderful!  My family doesn't usually enjoy stuffed peppers, but they were all very impressed.  My sister went out to eat instead, but after she tasted the leftovers she wished that she'd saved her money and stayed home for the peppers!

The filling was great. The peppers were too hard. They should have been parboiled before being stuffed. I will make it again only I will parboil the peppers first.
