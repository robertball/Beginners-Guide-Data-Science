I left out the cayenne, changed vinegar to twice the amount with lemon juice.
Big problem with method which I changed completely. Spices like cumin and paprika need to be fried in the olive oil to develop full flavour. So I did that and added garlic in at the last and fried 30 seconds. Added oil mix to lemon juice and added cilantro. Put al dente carrots in warm from the pot, draining the water first. Salad needs to marinate a few hours at room temp to develop full flavour. Will add some onion to dressing next time, about 3T minced onion  will go in with the garlic to the dressing.

Wow, I think these were the best tasting carrots that I have ever had! Extremely flavorful and such interesting flavors at that. I thought maybe with the cayenne and paprika that these might be too spicy, but they came out perfect. And while it takes a little while for the carrots to cook, it is so easy because a lot of the time is just waiting, and you can do other things during that time. My whole family loved these carrots so I know I will be making them again sometime soon. Thanks for the recipe, Malak!

Quite a winner with great balance of flavors and I love a new way to cook a healthy vegetable side dish that even my picky husband who doesn't like carrots but got 2nds of this and said it was a keeper.

Excellent!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I used 50% more of all spices.  When the carrots were almost cooked I removed them from the pan and then reduced the sauce.  Once the sauce was reduced I then turned off the heat and resumed the recipe.  Best carrot dish that many of us ever had.

Lovely!  That vinegar (I used apple cider vinegar) gives it such a cool kick.  I couldn't stop eating these!

I'm always looking for new ways to serve carrots and I'll happily add this to my rotation.  I overdid the vinegar (bottle slipped) so they were a tad acidic, but still quite good. Thanks, Malak!

I have made these about 10 times. The first time I made it, I tasted it and tasted it until it was gone! I have made them per the original recipe and with Carols suggested changes. I like the lemon juice and use it when I have it and have also used rice wine vinegar or cider vinegar. I use 1/4 tsp. cayenne and 1/2 tsp. salt. My friends have asked for the recipe. Thank you.

These carrots are fabulous. I was cooking an African dinner & needed a vegetable to serve. I cut the recipe in half because I was a little skeptical as to whether or not they would get eaten. The bowl was cleaned out down to the last drop. Everyone loved them. I used red wine vinegar, it was over powering, I will omit the vinegar next time.

I had a version of this at a Moroccan restaurant and was trying to duplicate it.  I made three mistakes, and will try it again as written.  First, I only had balsamic vinegar, which made the appearance darker than illustrated. Next, I accidentally dumped the vinegar in the mixture at the beginning of cooking instead of at the end.  Third, I found I didn't have ground cumin, only the seeds.  I tried to grind them in my mortar/pestle but it didn't work.  I decided to throw them in the cooking mixture as well.  It did take a lot longer than 20 minutes for the carrots to get tender and the liquid to evaporate, but I thought keeping all the ingredients was important so I kept cooking till the liquid was nearly gone - got to a syrupy consistency before the end.  All in all it was tasty, now I have to go back to the Moroccan restaurant and try the original to compare tastes.

Delicious! I may have over estimated my "pinch" of cayenne as the carrots were a tad too spicy. But, my husband and father-in-law thought they were great! I doubled the recipe and as another reviewer mentioned, should not have double the liquid. Not a big deal though, just emptied out the extra water that was left in pan after carrot were done cooking. Will definitely be making these again.

I followed one person's advice and bloomed the spices and garlic in the olive oil before adding the carrots and water. I might add just one cup of water. It also took only 10 minutes to cook the carrots until tender. I might also add the vinegar/lemon juice the last couple minutes of cooking, or use apple cider vinegar, the wine vinegar was way too sharp. But everyone liked it with the first couple changes.

These were pretty good but had a mild flavor in my opinion.  These were good but not great.  However, next time I might try it with Carol's recommendations.

I used this recipe, but omitted the cilantro and served it hot as a side dish for chicken shawarma. It was very simple to make and my guests loved it!! I will make it as a cold salad next time.

Pretty good and a nice change for carrots! I cut the recipe in half but kept the spices the same. I did add a bit of chopped red onion to the carrots ( I thought that would look pretty and we like onions ) I only had smoked paprika and used chili powder for the cayenne for personal preference.  I will totally do again!!! Thank you for sharing!!!!!

Made it as is. Loved it. My wife and I had this at a Moroccan restaurant  25 years ago and she loved it. This recipe was so close we could not tell the difference.

Amazing.... I'd never even heard of carrot salad before. The only thing I added was a splash or 2 of hot sauce.  Made the house smell heavenly

This was fantastic! But I altered the recipe. I boiled the carrots to al dente with only a touch of salt.  I made the dressing separately - heated olive oil in a small pan, added garlic and fresh ginger, added 1 teaspoon of the spice blend I bought in Morocco, sauteed all very gently. Added salt, pepper, and vinegar. Drained carrots, added dressing, tasted, added some Sriracha. Let this sit on the table for 3+ hours until dinner. Was MUCH better after sitting than when first made. Will definitely make again!

I reduced the liquid by 1/2 c. and also took the carrots out when cooked and reduced the liquid further. It was delicious but not overly spiced.

I had extra carrots from family party. I also had extra kale from another recipe that needed to be used or lost. So I decided to make this and "Garlic lentils with kale" by bolshevik. I call it a "free for all" meal and most times this type of dinner is a favor duel. However, the combination of the two blew my socks off. My mouth waters at the suggestion of another meal like that. The carrots were a tasty treat on their own and my husband, who is not a cooked carrot fan, has requested this be made again.

I don't really like cooked carrots, however the flavor was really good. My family loved it! I used whole baby carrots, therefore cooked them a little longer. Thanks for the delicious receipe!

Very good carrots! I reduced the cayenne since I knew my dinner guests aren't big on spicy, so I only put 1/2 tsp. I didn't have any wine vinegar figured we could just try it without. It wasn't really needed they still had great flavor.
