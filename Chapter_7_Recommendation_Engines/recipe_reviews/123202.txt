I was looking for a recipe to bring supper to a friend. This looked like an easy recipe. After reading the reviews to see if others had some suggestions, I browned the chops before they went into the pan, adding salt and pepper as they were frying. Instead of slicing the potatoes, I cubed them and they cooked faster and they got a little browner. I left out the flour, don't need the extra carbs. The house smelled yummy. The casserole was delicious and my husband said, that was a keeper. Hopefully my friend and her family will agree. I also sent along some corn and applesauce and for dessert it was a Mocha Chocolate Cake. Delicious. Thanks for the recipe and the reviews.

Very easy to prepare w/ most ingredients already in your pantry.  My husband, who is not always open to new recipes, said many times how good it was.  Definitely a keeper!!

I made this on the spur of the moment and only had 2 pork chops in the fridge.  I used the same amount of potatoes and a little less onion.  I increased the Italian seasoning and black pepper to 1/8 tsp each (putting 1/4 tsp on each side of the chops) and added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to the top of the chops.  I added some broccoli and cauliflower florets and some baby carrots (precooked the carrots in microwave for a few minutes so they would be finished when everything else was).  I increased the flour by about a 1/2 Tbsp due to the additional vegetables.  I would definitely make this again.  The pork chops were very moist and it was nice to not have a fried chop as I am on Weight Watchers.  This did not make a gravy - I thought it would due to the flour, but the onions were cooked to a translucent golden and the broth and the onions on top of the pork was very good.

This was pretty good.  I only had small new potatoes.  I cut them in half and they weren't fully cooked after 55 minutes and my chops seemed a bit over cooked.  They were not dry at all, but a little tough.  Maybe they needed to cook longer to be tender.  I'm not quite sure what the purpose of the flour is as it does not thicken the juices at all and there were a lot of juices!  The flavor of the chops and potatoes was very good.  I added salt, garlic and onion powders to the chops.  I forgot to add the butter, but didn't find it necessary anyway.  I will probably make this again, but will make sure I have the proper potatoes and leave out the flour.

Great meal!  My husband is very partial to chops fried in a pan, so it was a pleasant surprise when he told me it was delicious!

The potatoes were good. I think that I used to thin of pork chops because they got really dried out. I would have rather made those cheesy potatoes with the crushed corn flakes on top, as a side and then had regular juicy awesome porkchops on the side. I wasn't too impressed.

This was absolutely awesome!  Served with green beans.  No one spoke the entire meal, and I'll definitly be making this again!  I omitted the green peppers, simply cause I didn't have any, but I'll try it with them next time.

This is okay for a regular family dinner, but is way too bland for anything else.  I followed the recipe exactly and the pork chops were cooked through, but not dry, and the potatoes were exactly right.  I realize that this is supposed to be a healthful recipe, but it desperately needs salt!

I'm sorry but everything came out of the oven too pale. Nothing browned out. Chops, potatoes, and onions were all pale. I'll never make this again.

Pork chops tasted bland. The potatoes had a nice flavor to them. Had to cook for an extra 20 minutes. Probably will not make this again. Sorry
