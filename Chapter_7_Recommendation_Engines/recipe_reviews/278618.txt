I don't understand the low ratings for this recipe.  Yeah, the dough splits if you stretch it too thin.  So don't stretch it too thin.  I've made this at least five times now, and it's great.  I don't really like the peels left on, so I peel the apples now.  These are like mini apple pies, but better.  Ignore the people complaining about splitting and just make it.

Mine turned out exactly like the one he made for Michelle!  It was lovely at 50 minutes & I went to 60 & the crusts cracked open.  Now they look like big ol' dinosaur eggs.  The crust has a great hard glaze to it.  #ForkDon'tLie  They're cooling currently & once I get a feel for the doneness of the Fuji apple, I'll know if 50 minutes was the right time or not.

This came out great! I saved a bit of time by skipping the decorative leaves. Also, I highly recommend saving your excess sauce after baking. It becomes essentially an apple infused caramel sauce that can be used in countless desserts.

I made the dumplings with the pie crust recipe that is suggested here.  The crust was easy to make and very tasty.  Really added a lot of flavor to the dumplings.

4th time trying this. 4th time they broke apart.  Chef John needs to do something about this recipe, because it's an awful lot of work for a disaster.

I used the commercial puff pastry I had on hand instead of pie pastry.  The dumplings turned out nice and tasted okay.  I used 4 different types of apples, Envy, golden delicious, fuji, and honey bee.  After 60 minutes of baking, the former two types likely resulted in better texture.  The Fuji was a bit too firm for my liking.  The overall flavour could use something to give it more interest.  Maybe next time I’ll add a few Crasins in the apple.  The dumplings were not as sweet as I thought they would be even though the syrup itself was sweet.  I made 10 apple dumplings, but in hindsight I really didn’t need to double the syrup, because now I have nearly a cup of it left over.  This recipe is a good starting point.
