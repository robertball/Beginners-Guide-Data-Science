This is very good! I thought there was a perfect amount of dill. Next time I make it (and there will be a next time) I will add corn or salmon flakes.

Added a small cauliflower to all the rest and the result was FANTASTIC. Easy to make and delicious dish. Am tempted to add some fish next time :) Thank you!

The soup was delicious, except for th dill. 1/4 cup seemed like A LOT for a soup, and even a bit odd for potato soup. I'm not really a dill fan, so I cut it down to 1/8, which was fine for the first servings, but overnight it just got pretty powerful, and i couldnt eat it past that. Would definitely substitute that for something else later on. Otherwise was a good soup.

Used a little less dill as other reviewers suggested but I should have thrown in a bit more salt and some pepper too. I had some niblet corn leftover so I threw that in also.

This recipe was watery and the flavor was bland.  I will not make this again.
