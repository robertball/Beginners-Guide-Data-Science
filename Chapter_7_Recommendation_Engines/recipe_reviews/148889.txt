This recipe is great--it's almost impossible to mess up. I have never had red onion when I made this, so I have used yellow and even frozen pre-chopped onion, and both work fine. If you are looking for a little heartier recipe, you can add garbanzo or cannellini beans and even that doesn't mess it up. I have used chicken broth in place of the white wine too. The one tip that I figured out while making it is to cut the chard stems into pretty thin pieces so they will be tender--after the first time I cooked it, when my chard stems turned out a little tough, I started cutting them into 1/4- to 1/8-inch pieces, and that worked a lot better. Rainbow chard makes a really nice presentation, too. This is the first recipe that has ever inspired me to write a review on this site--I never knew my family would eat chard, so that alone makes this recipe a keeper!

A nice and healthy recipe for Swiss chard! For those who find it too bitter, try adding some heavy cream to the cooked vegetables.

Oh Man!!! This was GOOD! First time trying swiss chard, and there were no leftovers. Even the kids ate it! I fried up 2 slices of chopped up bacon with the olive oil/butter mixture and cooked the onions a little longer than called for in the recipe and the carmelized flavor gave it a nice depth. Also, I threw in about a half a cup of minced carrots with the onions because they were going to go bad in the fridge if I didn't. So I added the garlic after the onions and carrot were happy so it didn't burn. I will use this recipe again and again!!!

YUM.  The best chard recipe I've encountered yet!  It is said that chard is "the valedictorian of vegetables," because it's so high in so many nutrients.  I added about 1/4 c of golden raisins when I added the wine, and let them plump as they simmered.  The tiny bursts of sweetness were amazing with the slightly bitter greens.  I never thought of using Parm with greens before, but it was wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe - it's going into my recipe box!

For those of you looking for the perfect side dish to complete your Italian dinner, look no further.  I grew up with this stuff, love it, and was interested to try this variation of what I'm used to - the addition of white wine and lemon (the Parmesan being optional). I've always prepared this for the most part just as this submitter directs, occasionally adding bacon, and omitting the olive oil,  which I did this time. There's really no need to measure anything, just pop on some Dean Martin or Andrea Bocelli , have a glass of wine, and cook to your heart's content. This was delicious, just as Swiss Chard always is as far as I'm concerned....and I did love the addition of the white wine and lemon!

My 1st attempt at Swiss Chard as we don't get it in our remote area as a rule.  Very tasty recipe and I'll do this again.  I also may cut back on the butter.  I used just a tsp or so of lemon and it was fine.  Was a great combination with salmon steaks!

This is a quite nice recipe.  It's toothy and delicious.  I cut the stems into matchstick size pieces and simmered them for 10 minutes instead of five minutes.  I added a can of drained garbanzo beans (as was suggested by someone else) at the same time I added the leaves.  This helped round out and make this into a very satifying and tasty dish.  Thank you, DannyBoy.

I just made this tonight, and I agree with the reviews-it was excellent! I followed the recipe save for subbing shallot for red onion(like the flavor better). I wanted to try Swiss chard, but wasn't sure what to do with it. Now I know! I'm making it again tomorrow!

Since I was unable to find Swiss Chard at my local grocer, I used some fresh locally grown Kale. It worked great! I actually cut out the stems and just used the leaves, and was thrilled with the result. Very flavorful.

This is awesome. I had never cooked swiss chard before but got some at the market. I came home to find a recipe and found this! Totally yummy and had such a nice bite to it. I used lime juice and white onion b/c that's what I had on hand and it was scrumpious!

This is the only chard recipe my very picky husband will eat.  He even said it was "very good"!  I rarely have lemons on hand, so I have used white vinegar a couple of times with success.  I also always use dry vermouth in place of white wine, because the vermouth is shelf-stable and easier to keep in the pantry.  According to America's Test Kitchen, vermouth is almost always an excellent--or preferable--substitution for dry white wine.

Update: I have made this at least once a week for several weeks in a row, and my husband has yet to complain.  I'm even starting to look forward to eating this dish, and I'm not a vegetable lover.  Yum!

Not sure if it was the recipe, since it got great reviews...maybe chard is just not our thing. But this got a 0 from all five of us.

very good! My first shot at Swiss Chard, my son planted it in my garden! All the kids loved it and my mother in-law! I followed direction and added some yellow pepper because I had it. A word to the wise, a bunch of swiss chard does not go a long way, it shrinks to make small servings.

I have never been big on cooked greens, but after seeing swiss chard as a basket ingredient on a cooking show decied to give it a try.  I ran across this recipe and it is AWESOME.  Even my husband, who usually gives me grief about different foods, went back for seconds and thirds!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  BTW--this is my first rating on allrecipies after using this site for over 7 years.  Recipe was that good I decided I had to sign up.

Pretty good. Don't use too much onion or that's all you'll taste, and go easy on the lemon juice.

We are a swiss chard loving household, but I must confess to always cutting out the center rib and throwing it away along with the stems.  I was hesitant to use them in this recipe but I am very glad that I did.    Served with chicken and mashed sweet potatoes, this veggie stole the show.  The white wine and lemon seasoned the chard perfectly.  Even using less butter and oil than the recipe called for, the flavor was delectable.  I will definitely make this a healthy and delicious vegetable a regular at our table.

I have never cooked swiss chard before and because of this recipe it will be a staple in future.  Wow...tasty and so good for you!  I will cut down on the fats in future to make it more healthy as I don't see any need for 4 tbsps of oil and butter for it to work out.

What a wonderful way to prepare chard.  The technique of separating the stems from the leaf really helps to cut the bitterness.  The garlic, onion and parmesan cheese totally makes this crazy good.  My vegetable-phobic sons gobbled this down without an argument.  I will make this again for sure.

Delicious! So glad I tried it. This is my first review, prompted by how good this was. Although I did quadruple the cheese... I'm Italian. I also used grated lemon rind in addition to the lemon juice, and I used chicken broth instead of white wine, but only because I had finished the wine.

This was a really nice surprise!  Hubby & I've never had Swiss Chard before and werent sure how it would taste but this really won us over!  I made the recipe exactly as written and it was like we were eating something from an ellegant restaurant!  He was asking for more of this the very next night and well, that's never happened before!!  :-) Anyway, I'm growing beets and heard that the leaves can be used like swiss chard so since we cant really get enough of this new favorite, I'm thinking of throwing some in being that the chard does shrink and well, I just want more!!  Thank you Danny for a wonderful recipe that I'll be making very often!

If you have been looking for something to do with swiss card, this recipe is the way to go.  I always thought swiss chard was flavorless and boring.  Wow this recipe changed my opinion.  Now I'm hooked!!  The only changes I made were to make it healthier by cutting the fat.  I skipped the butter, and only used enough olive oil spray to coat the pan.  Have to say, it couldn't have been any more delicious!  The fresh grated parm really made the flavors pop.

Fabulous!  I have never used SC either but I will make this again.  I doubled the "sauce" ingredients and added a bunch of beet leaves as well, due to my recent CSA pick up. Thanks for the great recipe!

I picked-up some fresh Swiss Chard at the farmers market the other day, and was looking for a recipe that didn't have bacon in it.  Trust me I love bacon, but I just wanted to find something new.  This was perfect, and my whole house smelled wonderful while cooking.  I didn't need to change a thing.  This will be my new "go to" Swiss Chard recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

I have made this several times with swiss chard from my garden. Everyone in my family loves it. I substitute most, if not all, the wine for balsamic vinegar and find it's even better!

Great recipe! I've made it a few times and each time forget to buy the white wine- it's great without it! But one of these times I'll remember and try it.

Seems to me many people who 5-starred this recipe added cream, bacon, or more cheese.  That, to me, kind of defeats the purpose of a vegetable side dish.  Made as the recipe directed, my veggie-loving kidlet didn't like this at all, and now doesn't want to try this vegetable another way.  I wasn't crazy about the wine flavor in this (I cook with wine so that's not the problem).  Bottom line, I won't make this again.

This recipe makes swiss chard something that I may actually dream about.  We made a bunch last night, my husband and I ate the whole thing, and today I am wishing I had more in the house.  
I even cut the oil, butter and parm in half (just adding a bit more butter at the very end for a little more richness).  Try it!!!!

I've never had Swiss Chard before.  My family and I LOVED it, including my 5-year-old!  I made it exactly as the recipe says to.

I liked the taste,but my swiis chard was "stringy" I could hardly chew it. I chopped the stems and cooked alot longer than 5min? I don't know what I did wrong?I give it 5 stars because the taste was great!

Fantastic recipe.  Red wine vinegar is great instead of the wine and lemon juice.  But the recipe is also great as is.  I have used the basic ingredients for this recipe with beets and beet greens and it is fantastic.  I sautee the beets for a long time and then add the greens at the end.  Yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!  I just made this, using the Swiss chard from my garden.  I've never grown or cooked it before.  I did add a couple slices of chopped bacon, and it was so delicious!

I liked this one. (The Hubbs, not a major fan of veg in general, tolerated/ate it -- with, of course, his obligatory dab of mayo...to each his own...). Swiss Chard is my father's favorite vegetable, so it kind of "took me back".  Kind of hard to go wrong with fresh-from-the-garden greens (thank-you, Texas growing season...) I used chicken broth instead of the wine and added just a splash of lemon with the parm, plus salt and fresh-ground pepper at the finish.  Overall, a good recipe, and I expect to be making it again. Thanks!

Fabulous! I usually only eat chard because I know it's good for me. This, however, totally changed my opinion of chard.! It was so delicious I went back for seconds before even starting on the main course! Definitely a keeper!

Our favorite recipe for swiss chard, and even kale.  We receive an organic veggie bag weekly and were overwhelmed with greens this year.  We were desperate to find a few recipes so we would not get bored.  We stumbled on this one and now make it every chance we get.  We add red pepper flakes, and sometimes veggie broth and cook it down for more depth of flavor.

Swiss chard is versatile. I was looking for a different yet still easy way to prepare this mass of green leaves and stalks. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try, which I made as stated. Using a cast iron skillet, the butter, oil, garlic and onion aroma instantly made my stomach growl. Chard stems and leaves are quite fragrant as well, further enhancing my appetite once added to the mix. Parmesan, white wine and lemon juice add a light punch of flavor above the deeper tones of garlic and onion. Overall, the combination of ingredients made for an easy, tasty side dish that went well with marinated chicken breasts.

I am eating this as I write this review.  I'm trying to eat more greens and now I love Swiss Chard.  The recipe was quick and easy and I made it for one.  I believe the wine, lemon juice and parmesan cheese make your taste buds dance.  Thank you!

A good basic recipe. I left out red onion, white wine butter; used canola oil. However, I added Mediterranean olive salad (with capers and red peppers) to the minced garlic and stems. Tasted great with parmesan! Next time I'll try balsamic vinegar.

I just received a box of produce and it included a bunch of chard that I had no idea what to do with. This was my first time even tasting it and I am so glad I found this recipe to make it with. It was delicious and easy to make. I used chicken stock instead of white wine, because I was out. I will try it with the wine next time, but it was still great. Thank you! Even though I avoided it all my life because for some reason I imagined it would be too difficult to cook or not taste good, I am now a chard convert.

Delicious recipe! We added more garlic simply because we love garlic. The only thing I can add is to make sure everything is chopped and diced before starting to cook, it's a pretty quick dish to prepare after the chopping and dicing. Swiss Chard is LOADED with antioxidants so I'm glad we found a recipe we can eat often!

This is the best chard I've ever eaten!  I made the recipe exactly as written using fresh chard from my garden.  Thanks to all the fabulous cooks out there that share their recipes and  keep me from being in a food rut!!!
P.S.  If you grow chard and have an aphid problem (like me), soak the chard in some salt water, and that will remove the little devils:)

made as directed, but added the salt, just a little pink sea salt and it was too salty.. so I added fresh spinach to the pan and then added the rest of the veggies and cheese back into the pan. I also used bright lights swiss chard from my garden. THe colors were beautiful and it was delicious. I think the spinach was a nice addition. Thanks!!

This is the best recipe for swiss chard. I love swiss chard and made this to introduce my children and husband to swiss chard. I  made it two ways one with and one without the onion for the kids. It was so amazingly good. I could eat my swiss chard like this all day! It is super easy and quick. I made it as a side dish to some bbq pork chops. I actually served the pork chops on the bed of this swiss chard.

Very good!  The firm texture from the stems with the nutty flavor of the Parmesan gives it the heartiness of having nuts.  The lemon gives this nuttiness a good balance. I had considered adding bacon but opted against it and was glad I did not, it would have been unnecessary and redundant in this wonderfully textured, colored, and balanced dish.  I look forward to making this again. Next time I will cut the oil and/or butter. I did add a couple teaspoons of bacon grease so may omit butter altogether next time.   I added a bit more Parmesan as well.  Also was not sure how much a bunch is but happened the right amount this time!

We grew chard for the first time this winter and had no clue how to prepare it. This recipe is easy, delicious, and fast.  We like it so much, we will probably use it at least once a week until we finish all the chard in the garden!

I really liked this recipe. The only change I made was substituting chicken broth for the wine and about 2 Tbsp lemon juice; it was very tasty. I may try adding some toasted pine nuts next time. I had 1.5 lbs chard and, after trimming, it served three very generously and would easily have served 4.

This was sooooo good!  Prepared exactly as directed except substituted chicken stock for wine as suggested by others.  My husband and 9 yr old daughter even liked it (and they don't normally like greens of any kind)!  The three of us finished off a whole bunch of chard, now I have a way to get them to eat their greens!  Thanks!

Love it, I used a few squirts spray butter, 1 tbls evo, and a dash of splenda to the recipie. I also omitted the wine and used OM Bacon ready to use bacon bits (found by the other bacon bits a the grocery store) approx 2 tablespoons full. Very flavorful.

Excellent side dish and easy to put together.  Used soy cheese and skipped the butter. Also upped up the garlic and added a healthy dose of crushed red pepper.

Pretty good! For me it could have been a little more flavorful, plus I but in a can a garbanzo beans (as suggested) when I put in the leaves, but I should have put them in before that...they weren't too well-cooked. Very nice and nutritious side dish, I'll keep experimenting with it...I want to try with raisins too!

I have never made swiss chard before and am so glad I decided to try this recipe.  It was excellent!  I made it as a side to baked cod and brown rice.  I will definitely be making this again!  Great recipe!

I have been afraid of Swiss Chard since I was a kid and my dad would try to make us eat it.  Last year it came up in my garden in the middle of my lettuce, and it frightened me again, so I let it die.  When I got it in a basket of vegetables that I bought from a co-op group the other day, I decided to be brave and at least give it a chance.  This recipe was so amazing, that I ate every bite of it by myself!  I made it exactly as written, except substituted chicken broth for the wine.  Yum yum yum can't wait to make it again soon.  My dad would be proud.

Loved it! A repeat! Not a big fan of swiss chard, but wanted to add it to my diet for nutritional bennies. Now I know I will eat it more.

Excellent!  I added a little Pomegranate Infused Red Wine Vinegar in leiu of Lemon Juice and added Romano Cheese instead of Parmesan.  Really good. Thanks!

We loved this recipe. Even my 4 year old ate it happily!  I just left out the wine because I didn't have it on hand, but cooked the onions/garlic a little longer to caramelize it a bit.  Delicious, I look forward to trying it including the wine too.

I was skeptical about making this, as I don't think I have ever eaten swiss chard.  Oh my gosh, am I glad that I did!  I just made this as a side dish for my anniversary dinner.  I can not even being to tell you how great this was!  Rave reviews with the first bite my husband took.  We will be eating this quite a bit, since we have a ton of swiss chard in our garden right now.

Absolutely loved it - had a friend suggest cooking kale with garlic and onions but had some chard in the garden not kale.  Found this recipe when looking to see if there was something similar to the Kale suggestion.  I enjoy cooking though don't do so regularly and so I am less confident in making new dishes but this was delicious and easy.  Will probably try it with Kale as well.

We got Swiss Chard in our CSA shares, and this was the very first time we've ever had chard.  We didn't have red onions, so we substituted shallots instead.  Omitted the butter and added 2 tbsp of heavy cream to cut any bitterness out of the chard.  It was AMAZING.  Creamy, Sweet, and Salty.  A perfect compliment to a pasta dish!  If you are planning on making this dish for a large crowd get LOTS of chard!  More then you think you'll need.as the greens will cook down by more the half.

GREAT recipe! I didn't have wine but another reviewer suggested chicken broth as a sub and it was great. I think the wine would be better, which is why I'm still rating 5 stars. Other reviewers suggested bacon as an addition and I think that would be great, too! Will definitely make this again and again - SO SO good!

Really good. Tho this is the first time I have made swiss chard, it is one I will stick with in the future.  I just used chicken broth versus wine (none on hand) and it was great!  Recommend a good parmesan cheese for depth/flavor. tasty

Delicious way to prepare chard! I used chicken broth instead of white wine. Next time I will use less as the end product still had a lot of liquid.

Beautiful dish - great flavors. I used a sweet onion because it's what I had and it worked well. I used Parm shavings and just a couple squirts of lemon juice and it was wonderful. As I do with lots of leftovers, I threw them on top of a salad with other toppings and called it lunch. Great!

This was amazing! It was the first time I tried swiss chard, so was quite unsure about how it would turn out. In fact, I was prepared for the possibility I might have to throw the whole thing out if it wasn't good. Imagine my surprise when, with the first bite, I discovered that I LOVE it! Any recipe that makes you love something you thought you might hate deserves 5 stars in my opinion! The only change I made was to substitute chicken broth for the white wine.

I thought this was just okay.  I'm sorry that I didn't like it more.  It could be that I just love swiss chard all by itself.  Just steamed in a tiny bit of chicken broth.  It's a mild tasting veggie and I don't think it needed all these extra ingredients.  But that's just my opinion.  Obviously there are plenty of people who really liked this recipe.

This is a very easy, elegant side dish that would go well with anything except red meat. (The high iron in the chard would not compliment red meat's iron flavor). I made this per the recipe and also with red chard, both worked well.

This is a great recipe! I added butter beans, red bell pepper, and walnuts. I also used half a bulb of garlic, a whole sweet onion, lime juice and 4 Tbl. Low-fat Parmesan blend. Delicious & versatile. I will make this again. Thank you, DannyBoy.

Very tasty!  We used rainbow chard, white onion, and substituted mushroom/veggie broth for the white wine due to current kitchen inventory. I also tossed in some (veggie) bacon bits for a bit of a smoky flavor.  Delicious!  I think this would be great served with quinoa or a rice dish - will do that next time.

Oh my goodness, was this amazing!  I've never had Swiss chard before, but I've always ben curious to try it since I always see it at the supermarket.  I'm so glad that I gave it a shot!  I used rainbow chard for this recipe, and not only was it delicious, but it was very attractive, too.  I recommend this recipe!  I followed it exactly and was very pleased with the result.

I just didn't like this.  It was very bitter and there was too much wine and oil.

I was very excited to try this recipe but I wasn't thrilled with the results.  It was slightly bitter and otherwise just bland.  I like all of the ingredients so I may attempt again.

This is the best swiss chard recipe I have ever had. It was not the least bit bitter at all. Made my wife *very* happy as she has been trying a number of things with chard without being able to quite get the bitterness out. We also added some shiitake mushrooms. Mmmmmmm.

So delicious!
I added anchovies when the stems were sweating and added no extra salt. 
My husband didn’t want any at first, then he ended up eating the chard with his nachos.
I put it over pasta. So good!

UPDATE: I now use this recipe for kale, beet greens and spinach and even veggie-haters love it! :D ORIGINAL REVIEW: Delicious & low calorie way to prepare swiss chard. I always follow recipes exactly to give an accurate rating but with this recipe I used white onion instead of red and beef bouillon instead of wine because it's what I had. Great way to use the red swiss chard I have growing in my little backyard garden. 5 stars!

So good! I could have happily eaten a big bowl of it.  

I am growing chard for the first time, and this is the first recipe I've tried for it.  The only things I changed were to reduce the recipe since I'm harvesting leaves rather than whole plants, and I used scallions/green onions instead of red onion since that's what I had in the fridge.  I think this would be a great recipe for spinach too.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was great. The second time I made it without the parmesan cheese and it was just as good, I used sea salt instead.

I was worried that the stalks would be stringy or tough, but it all works out great.  The dish tasted very different than I expected: almost tomato-y, with a bit of an umami edge.  This is my first time cooking swiss chard, but definitely not the last!

Swiss Chard in the garden for the first time.  How to cook it? OMG!! This was the way!  The only change I made was to sub coconut oil for the butter and olive oil. Otherwise, all else was the same.  This is my new side dish until I have no more Chard.  YUM!!

First attempt at not only cooking swiss chard...but EATING swiss chard! This was delish!!!!! I made it exactly how the recipe states (except I did not have white wine so I used chicken broth). Loved, my husband loved it too. Definitely a keeper! Thank you! Just a side note, if you use chicken broth, it doesn't reduce like white wine does so use a little less. Unless you want to make this over pasta, then the extra liquid is perfect.

We have a garden full of chard and this is, by far, the best recipe I've found for cooking this veggie. The spices, herbs, lemon juice and wine blend together so well to compliment the natural flavor of chard. Not overpowering, but not too subtle either.  Perfect! We'll be making this again and again!

It was delicious! Did cut it up thinly tho.  Added some bacon bits and  put some  if fat in the garlic onion mixture before adding the chard. At the end I added  3  tablespoons of heavy cream and it balanced the acidity of the chard wonderfully.

This was so easy to prepare and delicious. My picky kids didn't lead me any. I will cook these at least twice a month now. I mixed Swiss Chard and Kale with lime and didn't use salt.  Wonderfully delicious!!

Loved this recipe but first....BE BOLD! Grow your own Swiss Chard! We put about three plants in our front garden bed among the flowers here in Ohio. It has such beautiful colors and it can feed you all summer long. It gets a bit wilty in the heat but lasts well into the frost season and requires very little maintenance. . 

On to the review part of things...We have been looking for a "favorite" chard recipe and have tried several.  We all loved this! I think the cheese really helped soften some of the sharpness/bitterness of chard. The garlic, butter and onion really brought it all together. I didn't have lemon so I used a lime just to add some acidity. What a healthy, nutritious dish that you can easily pull right out of your own garden with minimal effort! A winner!!

This was a very tasty recipe. We are "greens" lovers, and even our 10-year-old liked it. One suggestion: the greens are a bit tangy, on their own, so I might reduce the lemon a bit -- that was the biggest objection from my family. We also like to add a pinch of crushed red pepper whenever we cook greens, and that would be great here, too.

Linked this recipe to my blog post on growing and cooking with Swiss chard:

This was absolutely delicious!! I added the garbonzo beans as recommended by someone and it added a wonderful texture. I would make this over and over again! Thank you!

So simple and flavorful. This is my go-to when I'm afraid my greens are going to go bad. Works great with beet greens, kale, spinach... My greens-averse friends have even started requesting it!

Simple yet outstanding!! The recipe works for various other greens (including traditional Chinese greens) as well, yielding a gourmet Italian taste. The olive oil, cheese, wine, and lemon serve the same purpose as soy sauce or oyster sauce - a hit of umami/flavor so you don't feel like a cow grazing in a field when eating your greens. The Mediterranean and Asian diets were found to be the two healthiest diets for reducing hypertension and the common denominator was the large amount of fresh greens consumed. Both groups found a way to make these greens so tasty and this recipe is a perfect example. Thank you for posting.

Thought this was delish!  Only had a white onion on hand, so used that.  Followed the rest of the recipe closely, and thought it turned out great.  I did add a bit more cheese, and thought it all came together nicely.  I used a decent white wine that I had on hand, and a very ripe lemon.  I'll do this again!

Joined CSA an received swiss chard and had no idea what it was never had or saw it before.  Tried this recipe and I really liked it and so did my husband who is not big on anything different.  I will make it again.  Had no white wine so used apple cider vinegar and it was fine.  I will make it next time with the wine and hope I like it as much.

Delicious!! I used a yogurt/ vegetable oil spread instead of butter; more garlic and onion; lime instead of lemon (and probably more); fresh grated romano (more than was called for). My husband who in't a huge chard fan loved it.  I didn't cook it as much as the picture looks; it was still a brighter green.

Simple, attractive (especially if you use rainbow chard), and very tasty.  I reduced the oil and butter to 1 tablespoon total for 3/4 lb chard and all worked out perfectly, and saved a few calories to boot!.  Highly recommend.

Oh, boy! Was this so delicious! I was given two large bunches of organic red Swiss chard and was searching for a good recipe when I came across this one. Since I had so much chard, I needed to double up on the other ingredients. I also had to make some minor changes due to what I had on hand, and took the suggestion of one person to add some bacon. How could I go wrong there?!
I chopped about 6 slices of bacon, browned it, drained on paper towels, and reserved about 1/2 Tbs of the drippings. I added the drippings to the butter and EVOO. It made a heavenly concoction!
The only wine I had was a good quality dry Marsala. I used it and was delighted with the flavor. I added a heaping tsp of Chicken Base for flavoring.
Instead of Parmesan, I had a bit of freshly grated Asiago cheese.
The end result was so good, but the next day, I decided to toast some slivered almonds and add them in! Perfection!
I am so happy with the results, and there is sooo much of it, I decided to freeze it and contribute it as a vegetable side for Resurrection Sunday! I have a good feeling that the other guests will love this as much as I did! 
Danny Boy, thank you for this lovely recipe! It stands well enough on its own, yet it lends well to a little creativity and is forgiving if one must make substitutions!

Delicious. This swiss chard recipe is a keeper. Very fast and easy to make for a working mom trying to get her Family to eat more leafy veggies. The Lemon  juice brightens the flavor and the parmasan deepens the flavor. Thank you DannyBoy for posting this great recipe.

Excellent recipe. I used rainbow swiss chard, yellow onion, and shaved parmesan. After tasting, I added 1-2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar and then it was perfect!

Thanks for the recipe.  Swiss chard can be bland and this recipe makes it really flavorful.  I made it without the dry white wine, parmesan cheese, or lemon.  I cooked it under low heat to caramelize the onions and garlic. So good!

LOVE IT and have made this dish many many times!  I use red wine instead of white, since that's what I always have on hand, and it's fantastic!  I added some fresh grated ginger root once also - yummm.  Great recipe!

Delicious.  I was really getting tired of the green leafy veggies from my CSA until I found this recipe.  I haven't convinced my kids to try it yet (too many haven't been that great, they don't trust me, lol), but that's okay, more for me!

Absolutely Awesome!!! Loved it. I never expected to enjoy this dish as much as I did. I get a box of organic fruits and veggies delivered every other week. Yesterday there was a bunch of chard, which I don't normally cook with. I came on All Recipes and looked up recipes and decided on this one. I used veggie broth instead of wine and did add some cannellini beans to make it more substantial.Just before serving I added some fresh ground pepper.  When my DH tried it and liked it, I knew I had a winner on my hands. Will definitely be making again!!

This was our first time trying chard.  By personal preference, I did not use the red onion.  We liked the way it turned out, but felt there was just a little too much lemon.  I would reduce the lemon by half next time.

I make this at least once a week. It's a great way to eat chard. If you want to adjust it for kids, just substitute broth for the wine. It's still really good. Also: if you stir the parmesan in after you're done cooking and have transferred the chard to a serving bowl, the parmesan won't stick to the bottom of the pot---which it otherwise wants to do.

Great recipe,  when people say this is the best swiss chard recipe, they are telling the truth.  I did not add the onion and used romano in place of parmesan.  This is now my go to recipe for chard.

Love this sooo much! I grow tons of Neon Swiss Chard in my garden. My mom looked at me like I was crazy, but I made it for her this way, and she was hooked! I also use either really good Balsamic, or red wine vinegar in place of the lemon juice, and it tastes lovely as well! You just need to back off on the amount a little bit(unless you're me, and like it bitey!) Thank you so much for sharing!

I love this recipe; I have altered it a bit, using lime juice, and have omitted the wine.  Add pine nuts for a great flavor!

Wow, absolutely delicious recipe. The combination of flavors: white wine, lemon juice, and parmesan makes this dish incredibly tasty. Rainbow chard makes a beautiful presentation too. Thank you, DannyBoy!

Very good but felt the stems were still bitter.  Will probably try next time with Basalmic vinegar instead of lemon.  Cheese was nice.

Delicious!  I forgot to add the white wine and added couple extra garlic cloves. This recipe is a keeper and could be used with any greens.

I just can't say enough about how great this was. Chard tastes amazing with lemon and Parmesan! I used yellow chard and onions. Cut the butter to 1T and left out the oil. I didn't have wine so I used broth. It was delicious with the broth but I think the wine would really make it epic. I may use a mix of wine and broth next time. Which will be very soon!

First time eating/cooking chard.  This was really tasty.  I didn't have onion or wine, so I subbed dried onion and chicken stock.

Excellent!!!!  I didn't have any white wine, so I substituted vegetable broth.  Our family had this as the main course.  Didn't even need any meat.  This is a keeper.

This is an excellent dish even for those who aren't in love with chard (my husband). I didn't have any wine and used vegetable broth instead & sweet onions not red onions. No bitter taste at all & my husband even ate the stems! Will make again.

My kids hate most veggies but loved this with a generous serving of parmesan cheese.  I left out the onions since my kids don't like them but followed the recipe otherwise.  Next time, I'll try the variations with golden raisins and the one with cannellini beans.

This is an excellent, quick recipe for chard.  I used 1 t. of butter and 1 T. of olive oil and it was plenty.  It is also just as good without the parmesan.

Wow, first time I ever made Swiss Chard, it was so delicious and I was worried about my husband not liking it but he loved it so much and even kept dunking the bread.  I will definitely make this again.

So delicious....I can't believe how good this was, I could have eaten the entire thing, but I had to share )-:  I reduced the amount of oil to only 2 teaspoons and used only 1 teaspoon of light butter, and 1/2 the cheese because I am watching my weight, but it still tasted amazing.  I think I could eliminate those ingredients and it would still be great!

This recipe was excellent!! We have never had chard before & put it in our garden this year and I am so glad we did.
I followed this recipe exactly except I had no red onion and used yellow, no minced garlic and used garlic granulated, and did not have parmesan cheese and it was still  great tasting- husband loved all the different flavors going on.  Will definitely be making this a lot more. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was the first time I'd ever eaten swiss chard. I'd received it in a CSA box and wasn't totally sure whether to treat it more like kale or spinach. Made the recipe exactly as written (except halved the butter/oil) and really enjoyed it. Would definitely make this again, it was a delicious way to get some healthy greens into the diet.

Delicious! This was my first time making swiss chard, and it will be very difficult to get myself to branch out further after finding such a perfect recipe on my first try! I used green onions rather than red (because that's what we had), but other than that, I followed the recipe as written.

swiss chard is my most favorite food and this recipe is the best one i have used yet.   it mixes the piquancy of the garlic and the tartness of the lemon w/the natural sweetness of the chard.  just delicious!!!!

This was a great way to use the swiss chard from my garden. I added canned beans to extend it, because the swiss chard shrinks alot after it cooks. My kids liked it, and so I think it's a winner.

Thanks for such a lovely quick recipe! I love swiss chard, but many are scared to try it - everyone liked the dish, though only us die hard charders had seconds :)

I was so happy to have found this recipe as it was yummy.  I had just picked up a bunch of chard at our local farmer's market and was searching for a recipe when I discovered this one.  I followed it pretty much exactly as written and we both loved it.  Great recipe!

SO GOOD!!! I made this with red chard from my CSA, and used all olive oil (no butter), and it was delicious.  I like my greens well done, so after adding the leaves I covered the pan & simmered for 5 minutes - gives that traditional well cooked greens texture (of course, that part is personal preference).  Also looks pretty with a lemon wedge & sprinkle of parmesan on top as garnish. A winner that I will make again for sure!!!

This is better than creamed and another recipe that I have tried. I cooked enough for six and three of us cleaned the pot. I did change up the recipe a bit, adding a cup of chicken broth for the wine and two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar for the lemon juice. It was marvelous. As one commented, it is better than fresh spinach.

Yum yum! I didn't have white wine open so I skipped it and it was still the only swiss chard I've ever liked. Also, my chard loving mom said it was the best she's ever had.

LOVE IT - I have Swiss chard in my little city garden and can snip a few leaves to  make this quick and delicious recipe for lunch. I used the green onions from my garden as well and using the white part with the garlic and the greens with the chard leaves. I have made it with red wine too- just as good. I like the fact that it uses the stems. Sometimes I throw a few spinach leaves in just for fun.

This is the first time I've ever eaten swiss chard, let alone cooked it, and it came out wonderful!  Reminds me a lot of spinach.  I only used 1 Tbsp butter and I didn't have any onion, but the flavors of the garlic, wine, lemon juice and parm were perfect together.  This is a great recipe for swiss chard!

This is an easy, quick recipe. I didn't have white wine so I used 1/4 cup dry sherry and 1/4 cup chicken broth. Good, but I imagine white wine would be better!

Ran out to the garden and got the last of the chard after seeing this recipe.  Made it exactly like the recipe posted, including the suggestion by another reviewer to chop the stems to a quarter inch.  This was wonderfully rich and flavorful, and my husband and I shared the whole dish, which is supposed to serve 4.  Next time I'll reduce the butter to one tablespoon.  I'm going to make it again very soon.  Yum!!

My family would never eat swiss chard, or silverbeet, as its known in Australia, even though i grow it yearly. Tried this recipe, now finally my swiss chard is being eaten on a weekly basis. Great, thanks DannyBoy

Honest to goodness this was just terrible!  It had to be that we just don't care for swiss chard since I love every other ingredient.  Thank you for the recipe it was fun giving swiss chard a try but I certainly won't be making this again.

4 stars only because my other way of making chard is my fave (which I'll review separately).  I didn't measure and probably should have.  Used great northern beans which worked well.  Next time I would make these changes: * let onions cook down first, then garlic * then wine & stems, cover and simmer till softer * add beans & salt & pepper liberally & lemon and let beans absorb flavor and get soft * only at the last minute put in chard and let wilt lightly.  Salt again. * 2tbsp grated parmesan was way to little (I used a micro grater).  I'd way more than double that unless it was coarsely grated. * top with cracked pepper  Thank you Danny Boy!

Having a garden full of fresh swiss chard, I wanted to make something up quickly that would be a great accompanyment to my pork dish.  Unfortunately I didn't have any fresh parmesan on hand, so I can't base my review with that included but... it was still GREAT!  I also had fresh carrots so diced some of those into the mix.  The flavors blended so well - it was mellow and would be a lovely side dish to any summer dinner!

OMG.. This was awesome!!  I have never made chard but my whole family loved this.  Only thing I did differently was add some pine nuts because I looked up like 40 different chard recipes and when I went shopping I got the ingredients mixed up so I decided to add them and they were really good in this recipe.  My oldest son DRANK the pot liquor from the pot it was so yummy.  I will now make Chard anytime I can.

This was absolutely delicious!  I had never eaten chard before but my organics delivery included a bunch so I made this recipe and even my non-vegetable eating husband liked it.  I may have cooked it a little too long because some of the wilted chard turned an unappetizing shade of brown, but it still had really good flavor!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks DannyBoy!

Nice chard recipe, will make again.  It has a decidedly Italian flavor, so I suggest pairing it with Italian cuisine.

Loved this recipe!  I had never tried Swiss Chard before, but was given a free bunch at a local farmer's market and decided to try it.  I'm SO glad I did.  Great flavor ... and full of vitamins, iron, potassium, fiber, etc.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  I picked up some swiss chard at a garden fair today on a whim.  I have never tried it before.  Fantabulous results with this recipe.  My husband, and my 13 year old son loved it too! I didn't have white wine, so I subbed in chicken broth.  I will be making this again and again, and am considering adding swiss chard to my garden!  YUMMMMMMY!!!!!!!

Following the suggestion of another reviewer, I trimmed the stems down thin.  Otherwise, didn't change a thing.  It was great!

This is the best way I have ever had swiss chard.  It was delicious.  Since I am always trying to cut out fat, I think next time I will only use one tablespoon of butter next time.

I never fixed swiss chard before but I will again. This is a great side dish. I did not have the wine so I substituted chicken broth and it was wonderful.

I'm not sure if it was because it was red swiss chard, but it was waaaaay to lemon-y on first taste so I balanced it out with a teaspoon or so of red wine vinegar and added some black pepper that fixed it for me.

My first time cooking chard and eating chard. (Neighbours gave me a huge bunch from their garden) This recipe was sensational, even the fussy eater liked it! (I did add some chopped bacon at the beginning of the recipe) Won’t be the last time eating chard either. Thanks for the recipe

I never prepare greens because I don't know how to make them palatable.  This lovely recipe did that.  Thanks!  The lemon juice, the wine, the garlic and onions all helped with the odd flavor of the swiss chard.  Can't imagine it can do anything for Collards, though.  Collard greens are awful.

So good! I changed parmesan to Romano and dry white wine to sauvignon blanc just because those are the items I had. I sort of want to make this again tomorrow night! Cooking directions are spot on.

This is the best Swiss Chard recipe I have ever tried.  So yummy made last night and topped it with a grilled salmon fillet.  It was excellent.  I  am making it again tonight as I grow swiss chard so have plenty. Followed the recipe to the T .  Great recipe! I highly recommend.

This was fantastic! I found some gorgeous Swiss chard at the farmer's market, but I've never made it before. I found this recipe and I'm so glad I did. I hope they have more chard next week because I wanna make it again! I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.

I used Rainbow Swiss Chard, used Pinot Grigio wine vinegar instead of wine and left out Parmesan Cheese .  Delicious!

This was delicious!...the only change I made was to use 1/2 of the butter and olive oil in the recipe. Even doing that, still a little too oily for our liking. I'll cut back a little bit more next time.

Ridiculously tasty!  This was my very first attempt at Swiss Chard.  I added some chopped golden shiitake mushroom and a tiny piece of smoked pork (not necessary, but Hey, I had it on hand) in with the fresh garlic and avocado oil (my saute' oil of choice).  Do not skip the coriander and white wine-they are essential!  I can't wait to make this again:)))

I made it once about a month ago on trial basis with the red swiss chard that I found at the local grocery store. The colors and the smell totally got me in the mood for Christmas. I'm looking forward to making it again for family and friends. Definitely recommend adding the garbanzo beans. Also, I added about 2 times the suggested garlic.

Delicious and  easy way to cook Swiss chard. I used 1 T of butter and no oil in order to make it lighter. The flavor was still very good. I will use a little less lemon next time (personal taste).

I finally found something better to do with the chard we get from our CSA than throw it in the garbage! I used to hate chard because it tastes so bitter and awful raw. This recipe made it actually quite tasty and I'll be using it next time we get it.

I changed it slightly. My partner cant eat garlic so I used shallot instead, and I ran out (drank) the wine so I used chicken stock. It was great.

I had never tried Swiss chard before and we loved it!  I used about 3/4 cup fresh grated Parmesan to finish and although I had the wine, decided  to skip it.  The lemon gives it a fresh, bright flavor,  and it was a good mix of texture and flavor.

I made this recipe exactly as written and thought it was very yummy. I grew up eating Swiss chard, therefore I don't get it when people say it is bitter. With this recipe I can see the difference, the so called bitter is gone.
The only thing I would change next time is to cut back the parm cheese to 1 Tbs.... I will most defiantly make this again.

We got some onions (regular, not red) and a bunch of chard from the CSA this week. Whipped this up with my kids and everyone ate it up! Yum! Awesome since we had no experience with chard!

Have made this twice in the last two weeks - so yummy!  Made as directed except for swapping chicken broth for wine and finishing with a swirl of heavy cream - cuz why not?!  Delicious! Hubby would eat the entire dish as a meal!  If you want a "leafy greens" recipe, that is not kale or spinach,  this is the recipe!

This  is quite good, but much as I love garlic, I will cut it by one half next time. I have always blanched the chard before sautéing it, so I really liked skipping that step!

I made this last night to accompany lamb chops and it was delish.  However, I made a similar recipe a while ago that called for Feta cheese and I think I like Feta better than Parm with the Swiss Chard.

I thought it was delicious  but my partner would have preferred it without the lemon.

I have made this recipe about 4 times.  I LOVE it!  I serve it with a salmon dish.  Anyway, sometimes I don't need to add the lemon depending upon how dry the wine is.  Be careful with the salt.  

I think a nice addition would be to add a handful of chopped Pancetta  where it calls for the oil and butter, and decrease the amount of oil and/or butter.  Just if you wanted to have some added texture.  

Seriously, this is really good.

I substituted a splash of traditional balsamic vinegar for the lemon, and I didn't have any wine, but let me tell you, even my husband ate it, and he isn't big on greens.  I absolutely loved it, so it's a keeper!

The end result was delicious! This was my first crack at cooking  Swiss chard and I fully expected it to be a little off-putting and "beet like" with that earthy taste you commonly get with beets, but I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. I followed the recipe exactly, except I sautéed the stems a bit longer so they would be a little more tender. They still had a very nice texture after about eight minutes of sautéing. I taste tested them to make sure the texture was to my liking  and I got that earthy beet flavor that turns off many a diner. However, once I added the  lemon juice and parmesan, the flavor changed dramatically. This was a wonderful, wonderful dish, bursting with flavor and color! 
Having said all of the above, I will add that this dish it is a little time consuming because you have to wash the chard carefully and then dry it, so that takes some time. But, it is really worth it because not only is it delicious, it also makes for a lovely presentation and it is healthy to boot. So pleased I found and tried this recipe. It is a keeper for me!

I followed the recipe to a "T" but somehow the flavors just did not make it for my family, even with extra cheese added.  We have had recipes for chard we did like, so I don't think it was that we don't like chard.  Sorry!

I've made dozens of recipes on here but this is the first one I've actually signed in to review. OMG. This was so good! I've only ever had swiss chard in soup or in a lentil sweet potato stew that I make, so it was a really nice change to have all of these contrasting flavors. LOVED it.

Fantastic recipe. Limited ingredients so it isn't intensive to make. I used bottle white cooking wine with lemon, 1/2 small fresh lemon juice, grated zest from same lemon, fresh organic parmesan sheese. I followed the recipe as stated with my ingredients. Added a slight bit of salt at the table and it was divine!!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  The only change I made was that I did not use the chard stems because I misread the recipe.  This recipe is simple to make and has wonderful flavor. I did not add any extra seasonings at all.

Absolutely delicious, even my husband who is not a fan of vegetables gobbled this up along with my 3 kids.  It was a big hit, will be making this often!  It is good with bacon bits added as well.

Made it just now because I have been looking for vegetable recipes for my husband for health reasons.   Was expecting it to be 'edible' and just that but it was gorgeous.  The lemon and the cheese (used grated cheddar as I don't like Parmesan and never buy it) gave it such an extra kick and made what could have been a boring dish become delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

Very simple and quick to put together.  I used regular onion, as I had no red ones on hand.  Served with mixed grains, it made an easy dinner meal for six with some leftovers.  I liked the lemon/parmesan flavor.

During meal prep, realized I had too much chard for a future recipe. Needed to use up 1/2 of it. Had, unfortunately, already discarded stems. So prepared ALMOST as is (eyeballed what a "bunch" was) - sans stems. Oh, and threw in some toasted pine nuts at the end. SO VERY DELICIOUS!  Will take it to work over brown rice. Can't wait for lunchtime.

Made a double recipe, out of necessity of needing to cook two bunches of chard that were about to turn. The recipe turned out to have way too much liquid for us.  Not sure if the liquid was supposed to cook off, but it didn't.

This is our go to recipe for a quick week night veggie. I don't change much about it, except maybe cutting back a bit on the butter & oil and sometimes doubling the amount of swiss chard so we have leftovers. Super easy, and reheats well.

I added a split Conference pear that I warmed and browned in the leftover juice in the pan. I also grated some Pecorino Romano cheese as well as Parmesan. We thought it was very nice accompaniment to our Ziti Alfredo.

Mmmmmm.  This is wonderful.  Made exactly as written, but next time I think we will cut back on the olive oil and butter to one tablespoon of each. Be careful with the salt at the end- a little goes a long way since the park is also salty.

I have never had swiss chard before, but it was so yummy in this recipe. Make sure you have a good amount of swiss chard, because it really cooks down. Parmesan cheese was a good compliment to the flavor.

We added cayenne pepper and I also had some leftover specialty cheese that I added, I believe it was a type of havarti.

Tangy and delicious! I replaced the white wine with chicken broth since I'm not used to cooking with wine. This one's a keeper!

I used a tad less butter and oil and I put a dusting of freshly ground nutmeg.  This was outstanding and fairly simple to make.  Will definitely be making it again!

I harvested some rainbow chard from my garden to try this recipe.... it is a keeper!  I followed the recipe except  in a smaller quantity.  I did add a bit more white wine (Riesling).  This is a great recipe for those just trying chard for the first time.  It is very easy to make and wonderfully flavorful.  The Parmesan cheese at the end makes it perfect!  I will be making this again and again and again....

Omgoshhh this is so good. I subbed lemon juice for a little vinegar and orange juice since I couldn't find a lemon. Such a buttery savory flavor! Definitely making again.

This is excellent. I used 1 tablespoon of macadamia nut oil in place of oil and that was plenty with the butter. Next time I might omit the lemon juice just to see the difference. Thanks Danny

Simple, made with ingredients you would have for a last minute dish.  Taste is broth sweet and refreshing and Colorado remains good.  We paired it with fish, rice and beets.  Meal was great.

This was great. The only change I made was to use bacon grease to cook it in.  When I told my husband we were having swiss chard for supper, he turned his nose up, but he tried it and really liked it!

Delicious-  I was   happy to be able to  use the  chard from my garden.  I have only used it in a lentil soup   up to now and this was  very tasty.   I used the real parmesan and had only yellow onion  on hand.    I will make  again!

Loved this flavorful recipe for a highly underrated veggie! The only changes I made were to omit the butter and substituted the white wine (didn't have any) for chicken broth. Not only was this dish delish, but it was very pretty, too! We used red chard, and it kept its vibrant color.

Lovely recipe.Chard has a rather unique flavour and I think the lemon and Parmesan complement it very well. Also has a lovely presentation with the red and green, as the chard I used had red stems.Made it as written except subbed veggie broth for the white wine as I didn't have any on hand. Thank you for sharing this. It's keeper for me.

I think you can omit the lemon.  White wine makes it tart enough.  I added why more parmesan.  Why?  Because you can never have too much cheese (and it was going bad so needed to use it).

I followed the recipe exactly. I really liked it! I liked the chard better than sautéed spinach as it holds up better and didn't get mushy. The flavors went well together with the lemon and Parmesan being a nice finishing touch! Easy, quick and tasty!

Good recipe for swiss chard.  Don't add the garlic until the onion is almost tender or else it will burn.  Make sure you chop the stems pretty small and they will need to simmer closer to 10 minutes instead of 5.  Only cook leaves until wilted completely.  They don't need any more time.

This was the first time making and eating Swiss chard...this dish was WONDERFUL. I used 1 T bacon grease and 1 T of butter instead of 2 T of butter. I also added garbanzo beans which were perfect together. It did take about 10 min rather than 5 to cook the stems to tender. My husband and I both loved it. He went back for seconds. I will absolutely make this again.

I love this recipe... I've made it several times. I lucked out as this was my first attempt at cooking  Swiss chard. Loved the first recipe, so every time I get chard, I make this! The only thing I've gradually changed is that I no longer add the lemon. I think the Swiss chard already has a bit of a lemony taste, so I just leave it out now. Great recipe though! Thanks for sharing!!

This is THE best way to eat Swiss chard that I have tried so far. Delicious. Do the recipe right and you won't go wrong. Tastes similar to sauteed spinach if not, dare I say, better! The only thing different that I did was add a little crushed red pepper to give it some zing. It's delicious either way though!

I only used the leaves and subbed 1/4 c red wine, along with 1/4 c chicken broth and added some bacon as well. Hubby liked it, but 7 year-old DD and I weren't fans. I served it with baked chicken and wild rice. I mixed the chard into the wild rice and liked it better that way, especially the sautéed onions. This recipe won't be a repeat, but I enjoyed trying this quick and easy recipe.

Very good way to prepare Swiss Chard. The only changes I made were to add bacon to the oils, add more garlic & substitute red wine for white wine, because I didn't have white wine. A fantastic way to serve Swiss Chard.

This is great! My husband isn't big on the wine flavor, so I substitute chicken broth and leave out the lemon juice. I'll use different onion, depending on which type I have on hand and they all work well.

The wine and parmesan add just right the touch. I am not a fan of fall greens, but this recipe really was good... even my dad and husband liked it and they hardly eat vegetables.

My wife made this tonight. It was a surprisingly good - and quite healthy - side dish. We enjoyed it a lot! We were surprised at the taste and texture of the chard stems; my wife was tempted to leave them out! The only mod I might suggest is a little less olive oil and maybe make up for it with a touch more butter. But even that is a bit picky. Great find. This is a keeper!

My first time ever for Swiss Chard. It is not on the top of my list for something I want again, but that being said: the recipe is very clearly written, easy to make and it looks delicious. I did add a bit of precooked bacon (because it sounded good) and went to eating.

This is the best greens recipe I have ever made. Love the flavors, make this at least once per week even though the swiss chard is expensive (only organic available). I can't wait for growing season, Swiss Chard on top of my list this year because of this recipe. I also have only used yellow onion, I'll try it with red when I have some on hand. Always gets good reviews from my family and friends.

I bought some rainbow chard at Whole Foods the other day because I had been wanting to try it.  Not only is it beautiful, but it has a ton of health benefits, too!  This was the first recipe I found, and I happened to have everything on hand, so I gave it a shot. 

BLOWN AWAY!!! 

This will be eaten at least twice a week from now on.  Absolutely delicious!!  The touch of fresh parmesan amps it up to perfection!

First time as well having Chard and it was amazing. The 3rd time I made it, I used chicken broth instead of the wine (didn't have any) and it was every bit as yummy. I could seriously eat an entire pan-full of this myself. A few of my kids love it too. Haven't ever been able to get them to eat cooked greens before this. I usually triple the parmesan as I find the flavor of the cheese just really makes this dish and is so complementary with the lemon. I am making it tonight and adding some fried bacon. Don't imagine there will be any complaints with that addition. Make this!! It's delish!!

I had to substitute white vinegar for the dry white wine. Excellent flavor. It makes chard very palatable.

I bought a share with 6 bunches of swiss chard and had to get creative with the recipes. This was a perfect side dish to our meal - even my kids liked it, which earned it the 5 stars.

yummy! I substituted an orange champagne vinegar for the white wine since I didn't have any wine in the house and it gave it a little more citrus kick.

Very tasty!  Chard was not bitter, wine, lemon and parmesan cheese really added a lot.  Will definitely make this chard again!

This was really good!  I'll definitely cook it again.  I occasionally get chard as part of a weekly produce delivery and haven't yet landed on a "go to" recipe for it.  I think this might be the recipe!  I didn't have white wine and used red wine and it still came out great!  For any vegans out there, I used vegan butter and vegan parmesan and you wouldn't have known the difference.

I made this a week ago with rainbow chard we got from a neighbor's garden.  I bought some peppered bacon ends from the local meat shop.  Instead of sauteing the onions in olive oil and butter I used some of the bacon drippings.  I also used the lemon zest before squeezing fresh lemon into the pan.  I'm getting ready to make the same thing for dinner tonight.  Absolutely the best swiss chard recipe I've tried!

So I was worried about this dish but it's actually pretty tasty. I never worked with Swiss Chard before so this was my first time - quick and simple. I'm especially surprised because I'm not a veggies guy and hate onions, plus I had gotten mixed reviews on whether or not to keep the ribs, but I liked it a lot. It was a bit too sour, but that may have just been me (too much garlic or lemon?). Overall it had a cheesy, buttery, kind of sour taste to it, but still very delicious, I actually enjoyed it. The ribs and onions were really good, and the chard itself tastes just like spinach to me. I think the Parmesan was what really set it off. I wouldn't be averse to trying this dish again the future in different variations.

substitutions: 
vidalia onion instead of red, 
garlic seasoning instead of minced garlic
no white wine
no olive oil

Delicious. Great nutty, salty, sour flavor. We ate it on the side of bbq sauce covered chicken thighs from the grill. The flavor of the chard perfectly offset the sweetness of the bbq chicken. I didn't have white wine on hand, so I substituted rice wine vinegar, and found it an excellent variation.

I didn't have enough white wine so I used a little bit of wine vinegar and it gave it a slight kick. I do like this recipe and would make it again. It's super rich and savory so be careful that it doesn't overpower your main dish.

My family of 4 all wanted to finish the last scoop of this dish. And I'm including a teenager and a grader schooler. Who would have imagined we would really enjoy chard? Don't change a thing, great as written!

This is one of my FAVORITE ways to prepare chard. I've basically memorized this recipe because I use it so much. Sometimes I like to add cooked pasta to this recipe with a little bit of olive oil to make it my main dish.

The best thing ever, I loved it! I did make a couple of variations I used Rainbow Chard (all they had at the store) and a sweet white wine (It was all I had around). Easy to make and wonderful to eat!

Been trying to find a simple recipe , this was it.  Didn't change at all.  if you don't like greens this is not for you.  I'm trying the same recipe with beet tops but will add a little left over rice, similar to what my grandmother served.

We love this recipe!!  Tried this recipe after getting Swiss Chard in our coop produce basket...never had chard before.  My family loves it!  Even my daughter's boyfriend that hates veggies loves the recipe.  It is a beautiful presentation and delicious.  I've never modified the recipe, but make as is.  Simply scrumptious!

Followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed!  I ate the entire bunch of chard in one sitting, and was practically licking my plate clean!  I didn't need salt, though I usually prefer my food on the low-salt side.

OMG, I have had organic swiss chard before but not red kind, OMG this was delish.  This dish will be my cooking rotation for sure, i used white onion since that what I had and I used red wine since i was out of white and I didn't add any salt at all. just some peppercorn pepper.  Other than that I follow the recipe.  If you haven't eaten swiss chard you are missing out. 

PS. I ate a bunch by myself so you might one to get more than one if you are cooking for a family of 4.

So delicious. We didn't have red onion so I used a sweet onion and it was still so good. We ate this with fried eggs but I can't wait to have it as a side with a meat dish or mixed into pasta.

Just tried this recipe and it was actually REALLY GOOD. From what I see in the recipe I was so skeptical, and even when I was making this. But for all its simplicity it's actually delicious. I used shallots instead of onions since I didn't have any, and chicken broth instead of white wine. Next time I'm going to try it with all the original ingredients, already can't wait to make it again!

Fine, but a little disappointing. I usually make Swiss chard every week or two & love the bitter earthy taste. I think the wine dulls that flavor a little. I think this recipe might be better for people new to chard or that have to feed non-veggie eaters. But the lemon & parmesan were nice. I think this sauce would be excellent with asparagus, but won't make again for chard.

This recipe is wonderful!  It made me appreciate swiss chard.  I didn't have any white wine the first time I made it and it still turned out great.  My husband even liked it and has been asking me to make it again.

Wonderful, easy, and good for you. Cook as DannyBoy says and you can't go wrong. We have Swiss Chard growing in the backyard so a great recipe is a must.

My husband said this is THE recipe for swiss chard. It was really good! I used vermouth for the white wine, and a Vidalia onion, since that's what I had, and I added a diced carrot as another reviewer suggested. I plan to add a can of white beans and some broth to the leftovers for some nice beans and greens, as an encore.

I grew up hating swiss chard, but this recipe is amazing! The flavor is wonderful. The only change I made was to use white onion instead of red.

Just joined a CSA and swiss chard was in our basket this week.  I'm ashamed to say, I've never eaten it before now.  I gave this 4 stars because my 6 year old didn't care for it, so maybe it's not entirely kid friendly.  I, on the other hand, thought it was great.  Husband thought it was okay, but his hopes weren't high in the first place.  I didn't have red onion (yellow worked just fine) and I didn't have white wine (veggie stock seemed to work great).  Plus I used lemon juice from a bottle .  My guess is that this would be hard to mess up...and I like that in a recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Simple, fast and tasty!  First time ever cooking fresh swiss chard, and it was wonderful.  I used bottled lemon juice and cheap parmesan cheese powder, and it was still fantastic.

I have to say - I would have given it three stars, but my fiance really seemed to like it, so I'm averaging our opinions here. :-) The lemon juice with the chard just seemed jarring to my taste buds. I've not cooked chard before (I've always ate it raw in salads) but it seems like it would pair better with bacon. I'll try that combo next time. But like I said, my fiance LOVED this version, so perhaps you will too.

I used this recipe today using freshly-cut chard from our garden. Not having red onion, I substituted it with white onion and the result was still very good.  We have this dish with the main course that was red meat and they went together marvellously. I don't know whether the result would be this good if I didn't have fresh chard at hand.

very tasty and nice balance of flavors with lemon and wine and parm cheese. I used a tab of butter instead of 2 T. I used a little red onion. I loved this compliment side dish to my pork chops dinner. will use again!

This is really delicious!  I never thought I or my family would like swiss chard, but it went over very well.  I did use shallots instead of red onions (wasn't worth a trip to the store) and I will continue to use shallots, I think they helped make the recipe.  Excellent new vegi side dish, thank you!

This recipe is so delicious!  We're new to eating swiss chard, but after finding out how nutritious it is, I was determined to add it into our diet.  The only thing I did different was to cut the oils in half.  It turned out great!

I cook for some fussy employees at lunch time for a hotel. Chard is at a good price this time of year. Not only do I love this vegetable it is soooo good for you. I made this recipe, substituting chicken stock for the wine, and everyone loved it! Lunch lasts an hour and I would say all was gone in 15 minutes. A lot of the people had never eaten chard before and they thought it was great too. DannyBoy we love you!

My teenage daughter, husband and I all loved this recipe.  We had never eaten swiss chard before, and as such were a little apprehensive.  It was delicious!  I substituted lime for lemon because we had fresh limes, but either would work.  Try it - you may be as pleasantly surprised as were were!

Very delicious.  We love this as a side for fish; the lemon and wine compliment seafood really well.  No matter how good the main dish is, this is always the best thing on the plate.  I add a little extra parm.  Yum!

Excellent, first time I have ever made Swiss Chard.  I added fried bacon in small pieces to insure my husband would like it, and it worked.

Simple, easy and flavorful.    I didn't have white wine so I substituted 1/2 cup water and about 1 TBS of white wine vinegar.  Tasted just fine!

Don't make the mistake I made... I accidentally used a premade shortbread crust that came in a pie tin.  Came out too sweet, but still pretty good actually!  Next time I'll try a plain pie crust.  Mmmm.

I've never had swiss chard before, but I've always wanted to try it.  So when I found it at the farmer's market yesterday I brought home a bunch.  This recipe was easy and delicious!  I'll definitely be making it again!

Delicious! We are vegan so I substituted earth balance for butter and fake parm for the real thing. I got a bunch of swiss chard from a food co-op and didn't know what to do with it. This was amazing. There were no leftovers!

Really really yummy way to fix chard!  My husband eats anything I fix and is always appreciative, but this one he absolutely loved.  Said it was the best swiss chard we've ever had.  (and my eldest son is a heck of a cook and did swiss chard over the holidays for us.)

Tried this one after receiving some chard in our CSA share. Now our kids will eat anything, but I usually don't have the 9 year old stealing food off of my plate, and the 12 year old asking for a new recipe to be added to the regular rotation.  I did use a whole medium yellow onion instead of the red onion - we're an onion-loving family - but other than that, made it as written.

Made exactly as written an found it a little bitter.  I'll make again but probably cut back on the wine and add some buttermilk to mellow it out.

This is a great recipe!  I was always afraid of Swiss Chard until now!  I did modify a tiny bit, used the chicken broth in place of the white wine, added 3 slices of turkey bacon, a handful of sugar and drizzled maple syrup - near the end.  Served with Alfredo sauce over pasta - kind of like a carbonara!  Amazing!

This was pretty fantastic.  I had never used chard before, but it was delivered with a box of organic fruits and veggies so I thought I should give it a shot.  My husband doesn't really like meals without meat, so I added some chicken to it, but I would have been ok with just the veggies. It was a really nice dish.  I served it all over whole grain pasta.  What a great change from our everyday pasta dishes.  And it's good for you too!

My husband spontaneously commented that this was the best swiss chard recipe he's had and even my picky teenager said it wasn't bad.  (I made the recipe as written except I skipped the white wine because I didn't have any.)   The recipe was easy, tasty and will definitely be a regular in our home.   I made it with red chard so it was a colorful addition to the plates as well.

Excellent and simple.  I subbed vegetable broth and a little white wine vinegar for the white wine because we didn't have any in the house and it was still excellent.  Don't forget the lemon and cheese - they make the dish!

Considering Swiss chard is one of 11 super-foods, per a recent New York Times article -- I thought I better learn to cook it!  DELICIOUS!!!  and i didnt even use wine and onion (used extra fresh garlic though)  Next time I will make 2-3 bunches at at time - this amount is not much once cooked!

This was delicious!  It was a great compliment with an Italian chicken dish.

My family hates swiss chard.  I have tried cooking it several ways to no avail.  Tonight my husband exclaimed, "This is edible!  I can actually eat it!  It tastes good!"  Thank you for a recipe that they will eat and enjoy.

I hate"greens" but I couldn't quit eating this-- the only change I made was to add 1/2 cup of bacon bits in package- also all my ingredients were fresh from our local farmers market--also had fresh parmesean and with a 1/2 cup of fresh Romano-- I've decided to learn to freeze Kale and Chard because they are so nutrious and now I have some really good recipes other than "cooked grass in a bowl"  Love This!!!

This was surprisingly yummy.  I always expect chard to be bitter and this wasn't.  Even though the recipe did not call for it, I added a handful of raisins (to give some sweetness, thanks to the idea of another member).  I also gave it a healthy dose of cayenne because that's how the boyfriend rolls (with the heat).  Really good with swordfish and mashed potatoes.  Will make it again, and most likely, again.  Thanks DannyBoy!

This is a great recipe!  We never ate swiss chard before and my daughter and I loved this.  My husband and other two daughters didn't care for chard but it had nothing to do with the way it was prepared. It was fun trying something new!

This was the first time I ate swiss chard and I LOVED this recipe. I've made it multiple times and have had many people ask for the recipe.  Sometimes I've substituted white wine vinegar instead of white wine and have enjoyed the extra kick.

This dish is fantastic!  After 2 years of neglect and finally a wet spring we are swimming in swiss chard that has reseeded and taken over.  This makes eating it all a treat even after all these weeks.

I used this recipe for the first time I ever made (or ate) swiss chard, and I wasn't disappointed. The lemon juice, wine, and parmesan give nice flavor to a green that I suspect is not super flavorful on its own. This will be a repeat & staple side dish for me during the summer.

First time we ever tried chard. I didn't have any fresh lemon juice, so I omitted it. Also added some beans as other reviewers suggested and was glad I did. The lemon juice would be nice in it, hope I have some lemons next time. :) Capers would have been good too. I can't quite decide whether chard is 'earthy' or I just didn't get it washed off well enough. It was good enough to eat again, anyway. :)

This recipe really worked for us.  We have a ton of Bright Lights chard in our garden and I was ready to try a new recipe.  The kids ate every bit on their plates.  I'll probably use this recipe when I share bundles of chard with my neighbors.

I've never had chard of any kind before and I don't think I'd make it again.  Something about the texture is a turn-off for me.  However, I like every other ingredient in this recipe so I'm giving it 4 stars!  If you're a chard fan, this could be a 5 star recipe for you.  Worth a try, thanks for sharing.

This is a new favorite in my house!  I used the rainbow chard which adds beautiful color to your dinner plate.  I've also used this same recipe for spinach and broccoli rabe.  Works quite well.

I get Swiss chard monthly from my organic co-op, so I have tried it many different ways.  My teenage daughter would never eat it until I made this recipe.  She loved it and asked for a second helping, only there was none left. She said, "I can't believe I'm asking for a second helping of chard!" I will definitely be making this again.

A really great way to use all of the chard I get from our local CSA! This will be a regular dish. Substituted chicken broth for wine. The lemon juice and Parmesan add a great dimension of flavors.

I have tried many times to get a recipe that was really good.  This is really good!
I didn't have white wine so I used some broth from some pork I was cooking and it worked perfectly.

This was good, never had swiss chard before and am trying to get the kids to eat more veggies. I used about 1 1/2 T of butter and oil instead of 2 and only used 1/4 c wine. I also only had the can parm. I know it would be better with fresh. My 9yr old liked it!I would make this again.

This was great.  I wanted to branch out for new veggies this new year and will be adding this recipe to my go to list.  I served it for company no less and everyone loved it.  Tasted a bit like spinach which we love.  I did add too much lemon juice so will cut down next time.

I followed this recipe to a "t" and it was FANTASTIC!! The only difference was I used rainbow chard and white onion, just because that's what I had on hand. Not only was it gorgeous to look at, but it was absolutely delicious. I'm the type who eats vegetables because of guilt, not because I like them, and I just gobbled this one down. This is the best recipe I've tried in long time!
