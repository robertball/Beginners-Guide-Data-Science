These are the best brownies I've had in a very long time. I would have given the recipe 5 stars, only 1 small problem... the edges came out very burnt after only 40 mins.

This recipe is very good it is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I added chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  They were wonderful.

Too much sugar.  Not a great texture either.  There are much better brownie recipes on this site.  I don't recommend this one.

They are excellnt. You need to watch the edges because they burn quickly. The brownies are rich and very chocolaty. Excellent recipe.

Whoah - really intense brownies here.  They came out super heavy and dense, and I could only take about 1 square inch of them at a time.  I ended up taking them to the vultures at work because I didn't want my daughter having them either.  I would cut the sugar and the butter at least in half before I tried this recipe again. They did not burn, and were chewy in the very center, but not really enjoyable.

Don't use the whole 2 cups of sugar.  They are so sweet I have a headache......Incidentally I have a serious sweet tooth.  Nothing is ever too sweet for me, until now.

These were extremely dry.  The mix didn't pour into the pan.  I added the extra chocolate chips but it was still very dry.  I think I'll try it again but I've been reading on some other sites and it says to dissolve the cocoa powder into the melted butter, I think I'll try this to see if it makes it less dry.

I gave this one a two star because the picture doesn't come close to what the ingredients listed. Some of us are beginners and try to make it come out like the picture.

These were the worst brownies I have ever had. The consistency was dry and hard as a rock. There are definitely ingredients missing from this recipe: no baking powder and potentially not enough eggs. The taste was definitely rich, but that is the only positive thing I can say about it. I will never use this recipe again. It was even too hard to eat as cookies.
