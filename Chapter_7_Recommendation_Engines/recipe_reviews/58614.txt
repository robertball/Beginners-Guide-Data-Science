This was the best meatloaf I have ever made, but I did make a few changes.  First of all, I didn't use dip, I used a half cup sour cream and added a packet of beefy onion soup mix.  Also, I made my own gravy because my family prefers beef gravy.  It was very moist and flavorful and I will be making it again tomorrow.

Is the mother of invention sprouted sometimes from desperation?? lol.  I found myself w/out onion soup mix for this recipe...so going through my packets I found a seasoning packet from a box of stovetop stuffing (in which I had used the bread crumbs for another recipe).  This was the only change to the meatloaf recipe.  WE LOVED IT!  What a nice variation from having to use ketchup or tomato sauce, etc.  Will be a 'for sure' rotation in our dinner menus! Thanks for sharing this recipe w/us! :) The gravy was 'icing on the cake'..very creamy and yummy on mashed potatoes and the meatloaf!!  Ok, I'll stop gushing now lol. (honestly the submitter and I are NOT related lol)

Outstanding! Such a wonderful change of pace from the *sweeter* meatloaves I tend to make. This held together wonderfully and the flavor was out of this world. The taste reminded us of a mix between Salisbury Steak and Beef Stroganoff. I left out the celery and dill weed. I also cut down the bread crumbs to about 3/4 cup. This helped to keep it from drying out. My meatloaf was done in 45 minutes. So, I topped it with the sauce and baked it for another 10 minutes. I will make this again and again! Thanks, TRAVLEE! :o)

This recipe is definitely for the brave.  The flavors are bold and very strong.  I will be making some changes next time I make this dish because the flavor of the onion dip was to. overpowering; 4 oz. of onion dip, divided with 4 oz, of sour cream, divided.  I will also be adding 1/4 cup of milk to the gravy to thin it some.  Other than some tweaking, this recipe is a nice change from an ordinary meatloaf.

The older people in my family really enjoyed this meatloaf made exactly as the recipe calls to do. It is not spicy but very tasty. I think I would like it with the Creole seasoning added as well! Easy to make and freezes well without the sauce on top.  Add that later.

Terriffic meatloaf taste. I am tired of the tomato based meatloafs, this is a nice change. The sauce was a bit thick but I thinned it out w/ some chx stock. The leftovers were even better!

This is a fantastic meat loaf recipe!  The only thing I changed was, I added cream cheese and a little milk to the sauce as it was a little salty.

This was my first attempt at meatloaf... memories of my mother's meatloaf have kept me away for years. I really enjoyed this recipe but must say I subbed fresh thyme for the dill. The sauce definitely enhanced the loaf without overpowering. We served it with pasta. I will make it again, thanks!

Very, very good! Used sour cream and french onion dip. Very tasty, much better than tomatoe based meatloafs. The gravy was a very nice touch.

I really like this meatloaf! My take on the recipe was that it was sour cream dip (in the dairy section of the grocery store) and not just the dip mix.  Anyway, I used sour cream and it made a good loaf with the sauce.  This also makes fantastic meatloaf sandwiches the next day sans sauce.  I'll make this again and tweak it to my taste.  Thanks for a great recipe w/out ketchup!

The adults in the family really liked the variation on traditional meatloaf.  The kids, however, didn't love it. Ours was pretty soft and mushy on the inside, though, even though I followed the recipe exactly and used the meat thermometer to test if it was done.   In the future I would add more crackers or bread crumbs or cut down on the salsa a little to "firm it up."

I used celery seed and omitted the chopped onion, and subbed sour cream with onion soup mix instead of the dip.  This was tasty and easy!

Very easy to make.  My family really liked this meatloaf.  I loved the sauce, but my husband is not a "gravy" fan.

The meatloaf was fair at best.  The "gravy" was terrible.  As I tasted it while heating I knew I should've bought a jar of brown gravy as a backup.  Won't make either again.  Didn't throw it away so it avoided 1 star.

This has turned into one of the best 'personal specialty' dishes i have learned how to make.  I added Ranch to the equation also and i didnt use the celery, i used the onion soup mix and italian seasoned bread crumbs, and definately reduced the amount of breadcrumbs to about 3/4 a cup, i also used ranch in the sauce on top of it, and used 2 cans of the cream of mushroom soup, one can for the meat and the other for the sauce, next time i make it i might want to try cream of chicken.

Wow, I made this tonight & it was great! I just did a few changes mentioned earlier; I did not use Dill or Celery. I used scallions, onions, garlic, Sirloin Ground Beef, Mixed sour cream &  Onion soup mix. For the gravy I did use the cream of mushroom soup with the other 1/2 of the Sour cream mix & added like 3 tablespoons of Brown gravy. Added milk to thin the gravy just a bit.  Amazing with mash potatoes!! Thanks for this great recipe!

I love meatloaf with cream sauce, I moved to mexico over 3 years ago, and I converted my meatloaf to have a mexican flair, with the cream sauce, I add roasted pablano chiles and or chipotles in adobo. I also add diced roasted pablano chiles to the meatloaf its self. Every time I make it my house is full of people. thankyou for sharing your recipe. :)

Easy to make.  To Latino tastes, it comes across a bit bland. Next time, I'll take Travlee's advice and add spices.

Very tasty! Only suggestion is you may want to use sodium free cream of mushroom soup. It was an the salty side. My husband loves salty food but not me. Also, I used fat free sour cream and the  onion dip was still very delicious. Just a few suggestions to cut out unnecessary calories and keep all the flavor.=)

Very flavorful!  Delicious sauce - we put it on mashed potatoes as a side dish & it made a wonderful gravy.  I decreased the bread crumbs by about 1/3 cup - and it did take about half an hour longer to cook than shown on the recipe. We'll definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly. This is a nice change from the meat loafs we usually make. Even the picky eaters here liked it so it's a keeper.

Loved it. Nice to have a new comfort food with ground beef. Didn't have onion dip, so I basically made onion dip with 1 cup sour cream and 1/2 pkg of beefy onion soup mix. I let the flavors blend together for awhile before using. Otherwise made as directed. Thanks for sharing!

I made this meatloaf recipe for supper last night. It smelled great while it was cooking - maybe because of the dill. It was delicious. It was easy to make.  I had most of the ingredients on hand. I did use beef chuck instead of hamburger. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you. It is a great alternative to the tomato based meat loaf recipes.  I will definitely make this again soon.

This was pretty good, I left out the dill, just don't like it, and used garlic pepper.

Very yummy! I halved the dill because my hubs is a little "ehhh" about dill. I also used onion powder instead of the onions - after a long day of work and still unpacking from a move, chopping onions was not on my priority list.

I loved the sauce - it was even better the next day. Hubs ate it... they commented it would be good with ketchup (lol). So - I'll make again and lather mine in sauce and he can have some ketchup and we'll all be happy :) Thanks for the great recipe!

We really liked this!  It's a great recipe if you're trying to get rid of the Costco bin of mushrooms :  ).  At first, I thought the dip portion of the recipe was just calling for the dry dip mix---good thing I wisened up and realized it meant actual dip.  Mixed half of a dry ranch dip packet with 8 oz of sour cream.  Also, sauteed sliced mini-portabello mushrooms with a little bit of garlic salt to add to the sauce.  Only thing I wasn't such a fan of is the dill--think I'll cut back on that to 1/2 tsp.  We thought it was super!

This is a new way to have Meatloaf.  So far this is a winner in my family and as much love I have for ketchup, but no anymore for meatloaf.  Give it a try it is excellent.

This was very flavorful, however I did add approx four tablespoons of gravy (from a jar) to the soup and dip mixture. Baking time took about an hour and a half.  I used the full amount of bread crumbs because I don't like moist meatloaf. I didn't have an onion, so I used onion salt, also had to use part italian crumbs. The Dilll gave it good flavor.. I will make this again for sure, my hubby liked it too.

The meatloaf was great. I did have a problem with the sauce it was way to salty for our tastes so I thinned it out with a little bit of coffee and red wine, let it simmer until it thickened back up. It came out great. Used the extra sauce that I ended up with as a sauce for egg noodles. It was a great change from the Italian meatloaf I tend to make. I will definitely make this again.

I did not care for this. I followed the recipe to the tee, just to give a fair judgement of it. Bland, no flavor, and absolutely did nothing for the palate.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  Especially the gravy.  As an experienced cook I should have known that nothing makes canned cream of mushroom soup taste good as a gravy! No matter how I tried to thin it down it remained thick and gloppy.  Just awful.  The meatloaf itself was only OK.  I won't be making this again.

I saw a meatloaf with cream sauce recipe on TV and decided I wanted to try one -- and unfortunately, this is the one I tried.  Even with suggestions made by several other viewers, this was not good, and I think would only have been worse if made exactly as recipe states.  I'll stick with ketchup ones from now on.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe, but thought there was too much celery.  I will make this recipe again, only try cutting the amount of celery in half.  I served this with brussel sprouts and mushrooms from another recipe on this site and with egg noodles.

I made this in a batch to freeze for busy days when I return from teaching long hours.  Doubling plus the recipe, I used 3 pounds ground chuck and one pound pork.  One envelope of Onion soup, 4 ounces sour cream, 2 cups panko and 1.2 green pepper and 1/2 cup cup onion.  I whisked two eggs and 2 cans cream of mushroom together.  The sauce is as the recipe calls for, but I added sauteed mushrooms.

Definite keeper! My husband dislikes meatloaf but this was all I had in the freezer. It smelled good just mixing up the meat So I kept my fingers crossed. The kids even asked what I was cooking it smelled so good! Hubby came in and his first comment was how good it smelled. I was afraid to tell him meatloaf so when I did he made a face. He could not get enough! Had seconds plus ate every bit of the gravy too! The next night the kids even asked for it again!
Only change I made was I used sour cream and Lipton onion mix and when making the gravy added a little milk as suggested in previous posts.

I always test a recipe as written with no changes.  My wife raved about this for two days.  My son had it for lunch the following day and declared it the best meatloaf he had ever had.  I guess this will become my go to recipe for meatloaf.

there were a few tweaks i made, in reference to what other people had said and this turned out to be awesome! definetly make extra sauce. i never liked meatloaf before till i made this, the sour cream sauce makes a big diff. My husband loved it as well! i served it with butter noodles and a brocoli/cauliflower side dish. was a nice compliment. thank you1

AMAZING!  I have been looking for a meatloaf recipe for so long and I've finally found it!  I used half the amount of bread crumbs -- and I actually used corn flake crumbs because that's what I had.  I would highly recommend the sauce -- I ate it with and without and definitely preferred it with the sauce! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

This was something different from what I usually make....the "Rotel" meatloaf recipe.  It was great for something different.  I think I may have needed to add more pepper.  Thanks for sharing.
