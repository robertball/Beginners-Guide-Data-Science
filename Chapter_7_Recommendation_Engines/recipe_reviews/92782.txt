If you're looking for a restaurant-quality, fruited chicken dish, this is it! It's cherry season in Washington State, so I used 1 pound of fresh Bing cherries, halved & pitted them, then tossed with a couple tablespoons of sugar and let sit a few hours prior to making the recipe.  This made enough cherry juice to make the sauce later on. I also opted to bake the chicken in olive oil instead of pan-frying (I left out the flour when baking). When I was done making the sauce, I just poured it over the chicken in the baking pan and returned to the oven for 10 minutes.  It was absolutely delicious!

I'm merely a beginner to the culinary arts scene, and I screwed this one a good bit. I used boneless breasts instead of a whole chicken. I didn't heat the oil enough before I put the chicken in and the flour burnt to the bottom of the pan in a nice crispy sheet. I scraped it off and kept going, though, and the end result was sensational. The sauce was delicious; sweet, tangy, and thick. This was my first crack at an allrecipes recipe, and I will definitely be trying it again.

My daughter, who is homeschooled, saw this recipe and decided to make it for home economics.  I really didn't think it was going to be that great, but it was!   This has so much flavor and the combination of flavors is just wonderful!  My whole family loved it!  I told my daughter she should make it at least once a month!!  This one is definately a keeper!

Delicious.....even my picky husband gave it the thumbs up! Chicken was moist and had great flavor. The cherry sauce is to die for, and a great way to make this dish even more healthy. I did not have an orange, so I added a splash of orange juice. I will definitely be making this again!

This is a good basic meal, except for the orange; nobody can eat this recipe with all the orange peel cooked in it. If you chop the peel in larger pieces and then remove before serving, might work better. Also...there is not enough liquid. You look at the photo, the chicken is swimming in it.

This is Delicious, It's a dish that was a House Specialty in the Chinese Restaurant I ate at once!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's totally good if you use Marachino Cherries instead of the the other ones if you want SWEETNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was good but not great.  I used only 1 tbsp of olive oil to cut the fact content and used chicken breasts instead of whole chicken.  I also used fresh cherries from my tree, tossing them with sugar and letting them sit for a few hours as another reviewer suggested.  We just weren't crazy about it.  I probably won't make it again.

Good basic recipe and doesn't need a lot of sugar.  I don't eat meat so I substituted "Chikin Strips" from MorningStar's Meal Starters, reduced the sugar to 1 Tbspn., added 1/2 sliced onion, 1 shredded carrot, garlic powder and 2 Tbspn. oyster sauce and 2 Tbspn. cooking sherry before the corn starch mix is added.  I also used fresh cherries to reduce the sugar content, split with and pitted with a small, serrated pairing knife. It is a great way to use up some of those leftover summer cherries.  I served it with sauteed gnocchi and asparagus for a dinner entree.  Thanks for the inspiration.

Good recipe, but not great. Everyone liked it but no one said they were anxious to have it again.

This recipe was out of this world good.  I fried chicken breasts only in olive oil without the flour.  Like one of the other posters, I also used fresh organic dark red cherries and just put sugar on them after I pitted and halved them.  I used a small amount of water to mix in the cornstarch before putting in the pan to make the syrup.  The orange slices were a nice added touch to the chicken and cherries.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

Strong taste of orange, I might cut back on a bit of the cherries though. My husband LOVED it... he was also the chef for this recipe!

Very good, the flavors go well together. The almonds are wonderful in this dish. I used boneless skinless chicken breast and just used a little more oil. I served it with rice on the side and will make this again.

I had to abort the first attempt at making this recipe because I had never used canned sweet dark cherries.  After opening the can and tasting one of these mushy tasteless things- I was not about to ruin my chicken.  Second time I used dried cherries heated in water till slightly softened- oh sooo much better -more flavor acutually taste like cherries and a little texture-  FInished the recipe as written- using a half the sugar

This was delicious!  I used boneless chicken breast, pounded thin, and fresh bing cherries, halved, pitted, and soaked in about 1/4 c water and a tsp of sugar (used a little less sugar in the sauce because of this). Because I used breasts which didn’t yield much liquid, I added a little butter to the pan when I removed the chicken to sauté the cherries in the drippings.  Aside from these small changes, I followed the recipe exactly. A keeper!

I tried this but with a variation, I used pork ribeye instead of chicken, used more cherries ( fresh) & orange ( actually used mandarins instead) than the recipe called for. Also added some fresh herbs, some thyme, lemon thyme, basil & purple basil. Also added about 1/2 cup red mascato to the mix. Simmered for about 10 minutes, then poured over the pork, simmered another 10 minutes then served with rice. Yummy! Will try with chicken next time.

My husband and I loved this dish!  I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I used only chicken breasts and legs because my grocer doesn't carry cut-up chickens anymore (go figure).  It truly does taste like it's restaurant-quality.  I served it with wild rice and asparagus.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Totally awesome. Everyone went back for seconds 
The only modifications I made was (1) I dissolved the corn starch in orange juice, (2) I used thin sliced chicken, (2) I doubled the amount of cherries. Serving this over wild rice the extra cherry sauce made the rice really nice.
