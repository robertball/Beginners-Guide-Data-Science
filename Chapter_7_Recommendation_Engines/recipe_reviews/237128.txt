Flavour wise this recipe is great but the pancakes did not fluff up at all.  I believe that it has to do with the amount of baking powder.  When I checked other pancake recipes I have tried I found that for example one had 1 1/2 cups flour with 3 1/2 tsp. baking powder.  As a result I feel that maybe 4 to 4 1/2 tsps. should be used.  Will be doing again and will try this change.   LEJOYROTHE Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I added an extra teaspoon of baking soda and they were perfect! So delicious and so good tasting. Definitely saved to my recipe box!

Good flavor and visually appealing. I would add a bit more baking powder next time. They're a bit denser than I was expecting.

This has wonderful flavor but is a bit more dense than we're used to for pancakes.
