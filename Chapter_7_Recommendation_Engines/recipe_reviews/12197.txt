Just made this for dinner, it was great! I added only 1 1/2 cups milk because of other comments and cooked it about 40 minutes. It turned out excellent! Thank you for a quick dinner!

A good flavor, but a little "eggy" in texture. Could improve, I think, by using half-and-half instead of milk. Also, was watery, I think from the fresh spinach cooking (although it was quite dry when I added it). Do not top with the cheese till the last ten minutes. It browned too much! A nice recipe if I do some work on it next time.

This dish has a fabulous flavor!  However, it was very runny.  Next time, I'll use less milk and perhaps prethicken it with some flour.

I used colby-jack cheese and lightly sauteed the onion and garlic.  I did not scald the milk.  This pie was delicious and easy.  Will make this again!  A frozen deep-dish pie crust and ready-cooked bacon crumbles would be great time savers.  Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.

This as a nice side, but it could have used a little more jazz for our liking, although I admit  I sauteed the onion in a little butter  taking the bite away before adding it to the mixture.  I would reduce the amount of milk the next time.

I made minor changes: 
1 1/2 cups milk - (1 c milk +1/2 c. half &half) and about 2 c fresh spinach. I sautee`d the onion + 3 sliced sweet peppers (red+orange) in the bacon grease. Baked 25 min the let quiche sit 10 min. My husband raved, "it's the best quiche you've ever made!"

This recipe is great with a few modifications.  Like others said, do not use 2 cups of milk.  I used 3/4 cup of mile and 3/4 cup of half-and-half.  
I did not include bacon to make this a vegetarian dish.
I also modified this by sauteing (for only a couple minutes) the onion and garlic (2 cloves diced)in 1tbsp of olive oil.  I added the chopped and dried spinach to the saute for 2 additional minutes and removed from the heat.  I placed this mixture in the bottom of the pie crust.
I spinkled this mixture with about 1/2 cut of feta cheese to make this more of a great quiche.
I baked for 30 minutes and then added 1 cup of the shredded cheese and baked for another 10 minutes.  It got perfectly brown on top.
Since it seemed to still be alittle wet I made sure to let it sit for 5 minutes before cutting.  This allowed it to settled.
Served with a greek side salad and it was a huge hit!

Did some minor adjustments and was enough for 2 pies. Good stuff! Next time I might fry the onions before adding to mixture.
