It's a steak sauce, it's a mult-purpose marinade. It's a varnish stripper. It's everything real men demand of an industrial steak sauce. Forget A-1. This is the real thing. 

Warning: zip sauce needs to be used only by real men and real women. If you're in doubt about what side of the fence you're on, you're in for a rough ride with this sauce. This is not something you want to just pour on your polite little ribeye. It will refuse to be placed on anything less than a 1.25" thick strip sirloin-- butcher shop stuff-- forget Kroger. Whatever you do, do not put a California freakin' vegetable medley anywhere near this sauce. It'll chase it off the plate, and then turn around and come after you. About the only thing it will tolerate on the same plate is a baked Idaho potato.

A wine selection: screw the wine. This sauce demands Scotch, neat. Although I have heard of some folks doing this sauce with a stiff Manhattan. Make sure you do two good ones while the steak is grilling , and then gun down the third before your first bite. You'll be channeling Hunter S. Thompson and Rodney Dangerfield before you wrestle the dog for the last scrap of fat. After you pick yourself off the floor, THEN you can talk about wine.

Afterwards, sweep the dishes off the table and grab your partner by the hair and show her what real men and real women do. She'll understand and be ready.

Although tasty, this isn't the closely guarded recipe for zip sauce. I managed an Italian restaurant that served it and have had zip sauce at other Detroit area stores and it never had all these herbs and spices. As I said, the zip sauce recipe is closely guarded, so I don't have it, but it tastes more like a reduced beef broth, butter and soy sauce combination.

Nice flavor. I adapted the recipe a bit in order to make it into a gravy and I had to use beef bouillon granules because I didn't have any drippings. Despite those changes it still turned out quite well!

The only recipe I know of for Zip sauce is clarified butter, garlic powder (or finely chopped garlic) and Maggi Sauce.  It is not overpowering - it only enhances the taste of the steak!!

I've tried this recipe several times with no luck of it turning remotely similar to the famous zip sauces at the Detroit restuarants (Lelli's, Andiamo, Rochester Chop House, Red Coat, etc). I do have a friend who worked at 2 of the restuarants that serve the zip sause and he WILL NOT give out the recipe but he will make it at home when entertaining. The closest thing I've come to is actually buying the pre packaged Zip Sauce at the local Grocer, you can find it at many of the small Detroit Grocer's, mine Fresh Approach in Royal Oak. Although there are different versions of the recipe, one is gravy like and the other isn't, I perfer mine the thicker, gravy like version, I will add Wondra flour mixed with water to the Zip Sauce I bought, and mix until desired consistency.

The sauce is pretty good, but not quite the real thing. I actually work at that little Italian restaurant, and love love love their zip sauce. This was close, but there was some sort of spice/taste that was too strong.

Really, really good.  I put 1/2 tsp of salt instead of a full tsp.  And I use olive oil + a little water instead of beef drippings - it's very good like this too.

I have no idea what zip sauce is or what restaurant it's from, but I think this version is delish!!  Oh used fresh garlic instead of powdered, I just had too!  Served over a NY strip and it was beautiful :)
