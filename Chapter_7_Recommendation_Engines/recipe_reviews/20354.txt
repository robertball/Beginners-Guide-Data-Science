Wow! I made these for the craft ladies at my church. They LOVED them and even asked me to write down the recipe.  After I told my husband about them he asked me to make them when we visited his grandparents. There were a hit there too. My husband raved and raved about them so much that he had one of his co-workers over one night and asked me to make them for him. That's where my one bit of advice comes in. These cook better on a gas stove for some reason.  When I made them for the craft ladies I used a gas stove. When I made them for the grandparents I used a gas stove. But when I made them at home on my electric stove they either came out underdone or overdone. The reason for this is the electric stove cannot keep the temperature of the oil at a consistant temperature (when the dough is dropped in the temperature of the oil cools slightly).  To solve this problem my husband went out and bought me a deep fryer that has a temperature control just so I could make these for him at home. Now, if that's not telling you something about how good these are then I don't know what will. A BIG THANKS for sharing this recipe!

Update:  Before you start frying make sure your oil temperature is 375 degrees.

This was Great.  Easy and the kids loved to make them.  Best of all they are not too sweet and the honey that you drizzle over them is much healthier than sugar that is used on other treats for kids.  Also, I would make sure that I am using a teaspoon to measure off the dough before dropping it into the deep fryer.  We used a spoon and when they turned golden brown, I took them out.  Mistake!!! They were not done inside... too big and we had to tear them in halfs and deep fry longer.  Otheerwise, outstanding.

These were awesome.  I loved it as well as my 3 kids ages 2,4,and 7 and my husband.  After i let the batter sit i put it in a ziploc bag and cut the tip off and squirted in abt tsp increments into the oil.

Excellent recipe!  My grandmother used to make this when I was a kid, and I haven't had it since then.  This is pretty close to hers.   Also, someone else suggested putting the batter in a baggie and cutting off one of the corners to squeeze the batter out.  I tried this and it works perfectly.  Much better than messing with a sticky spoon.

The honey does it!!!!  Not only does it help hold the powdered sugar on but it makes you crave more and more!!!  I made them due to having extra ricotta cheese from making lasange and he held the plate as we shared them.  Better than any donut holes I ever had,...light airy YUMMY.

These were great! They were nice and light and fluffy! The only change I made was that I halved it and used 1/4 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. I didnt have any powdered sugar so I just drizzled on the honey. The honey definitely makes these great. Oh, also, I didnt let it sit for an hour I just fried 'em up and they turned out fine :)

I should have known just by looking, but didn't go with my instincts. 1 1/2 tsp vanilla is far too much.  Other than that the recipe is great.

Wonderful recipe! I had to improvise a little, but they still turned out delicious. I halved the sugar, simply because I prefer things less sweet. I was low on white flour, so I used half white/ half wheat. I was also low on oil, so I tried heating up 1/4" in a cast iron skillet and fried the batter that way. It did require a little more awareness and manual turning, but it worked out fine. Very fun to make and eat!

This makes way too many sfingi unless you are celebrating all the Josephs in your extended family. Cut recipe in 1/2 or 1/4. I've been making them for years, AND THE BEST TIP is to put the batter in mini-muffin pans and bake at 350 for 15 to 20 minutes. No nasty frying and light as air sfingi. Vive San Giuseppe!!

Good luck on getting these cooked all the way. Burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. In the trash.  Perhaps I will try again without the ricotta.

These are to die for!  I've made them several times for friends and family and they all rave.  Make sure you don't make them too big or they won't cook all the way through.

Kids LOVED them, like other reviews they ate the whole bunch still warm, and I have a PICKY 7yo who loved them too. I used a deep fryer , worked ok but stuck to the basket sometimes. Next time I'll try using the pan.

These were unbelievably good! They were so light and fluffy. I didn't alter the recipe at all. Though I did follow the recommendation of using the ziplock bag instead of a spoon to drop them in the oil and that worked like a charm.

Like a lot of others, I only made this to use up some ricotta cheese that I had left over. Because of this recipe, I will now be buying ricotta just to make these!!!

The only complaint that I have is that I ate so many, I almost made myself sick.

Didn't know what to expect, but this reminded me of funnel cake! It was simple, yummy, and a great way to use up ricotta cheese.

I remember as a Kid my Aunt Annie used to make these and no one had a written down recipe, when I found this I just wanted to try it.  These are as good if not better than my Great Aunt.....  She would be proud.

I have been looking and looking for a recipe like this!  As a kid, my mom used to make something very similar and I am SO excited to have found this recipe!  Through the years, we have lost the recipe we used so I'm really hoping these turn out as well as the ones I remember growing up!

Favorite family recipe:  the sfingi never get to leave the kitchen as the kids and adults stand next to the deep fryer and fight to eat them.  Variations include adding chopped apples to the batter and shaking in cinnamon sugar in a brown paper bag after draining.  Hint:  dropping these into the deep fryer using two teaspoons results in some "fingers" stretching out from the dough, which are my family's favorite crispy part.

These were really good and a great way to use up any leftover ricotta from lasagna.

I made a 4-serving version, using 3/4 cup of ricotta, 1/8 cup Egg Beaters, 1.5 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1.25 tsp baking powder, and 1/4 cup flour. I also used a medium sized cookie scoop to ensure they were all uniform and would cook evenly. They were delicious right out of the oil. However I cooked them the night before, stored them in an airtight container wrapped in paper towels and then baked them until hot the next day. Tasted perfect! Tasted like little donut holes!

I agree ....... The outside burns and the inside is not cooked. I have never used ricotta in this recipe before and  I think that is what makes these gooey inside. Not a fan of this recipe !

Very good, my husband liked it even better than the funnel cake recipe and he loved those...
I find it pretty easy to dump the batter in the oil with two teaspoons: fill one up and with the second push that content off with the second spoon.

These were fabulous when they were fresh and hot, but once cold were soggy and less appealing.  Eat 'em while they're hot!

Yum, yum, yum!!  I used ricotta fresh from Italy, and oh my goodness, they were good!  One thing - instead of piling them in a pyramid and drizzling honey and powdered sugar over them, I rolled each one in honey and powdered sugar.  Super good!

These were very good but I agree I think maybe some cinammon or another spice was needed to make them perfect. Hubby and cousin ate them all!! Thanks for a great recipe

Very simple to prepare and it was  really easy to fry these yummy treats up. Cinnamon spinkled with the sugar, made these even better!

Tastes great, lite and fluffy with a crunch.  Advise, lower  oil temp and cook longer to golden brown.  Otherwise, center is soft and outer appearance is dark similar to picture.

They were good. I've never used ricotta cheese, but my husband made gluten free ravoli and didn't use it up. Definitely new for us but very yummy!

loved them and so did my whole family !!  made them for Christmas.  were a tradition when i was younger.  everyone raved about them.  i did add a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter and served them w/ a cinnamon sugar coating rather than honey and powdered sugar!! will definitely make again !!!!

loved the recipe, but altered it a bit.  first, i used a cast iron skillet on an electric stove, and high heat was far too hot.  medium heat for the oil was just right.  the first batch was black.  also, rather than drizzling with honey, i used honey butter as a spread/dip.  i will definitely make these again.
