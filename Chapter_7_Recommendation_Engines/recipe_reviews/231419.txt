This is by far the best marinade I have found for venison so far. The Worcestershire is dominant but you can also taste all of the other ingredients too. I eat venison because my husband is a hunter but I've never cared for it much. Until this recipe that is. I took one bite just to taste it and ended up gobbling up the rest faster than I could take a picture. This will be my go to from now on. The only thing I might suggest is to go ahead and let it marinate overnight so that the ingredients have time to get acquainted. And, if you are sensitive to heat you might want to cut back on the red pepper flakes. Thanks for sharing Thorney!

This was excellent! My husband came in with venison steaks and never having fixed it before, I searched this site for a good and quick recipe. Most recipes I was interested in called for several hours to marinade which I didn't have time for, then I found this one. I had enough time to marinade it for a little over an hour and that worked fine for us. My husband and I loved the results! We will be doing this one again as there is more venison in the freezer!  Thank you!

This marinade made the best venison steaks! My husband is not particularly fond of venison, but he loved this! My grandson couldn't get enough of it! We will use this again for sure! I did add a little red wine to the mix.

Brother in law gave us three packages of venison steaks that he wasn't having much luck cooking due to the age of the deer providing a very gamey taste.  I tried smoking the first two with a bottled marinade which was not very good.  This recipe took the gamey flavour right out of the meat and really added unique flavours in every bite.  Even my wife who doesn't usually enjoy venison had quite a bit.

Great marinade!  I changed it a little--used equal amounts of Worcestershire and soy sauce and omitted the salt. (Soy sauce already has a lot of sodium.) Can't wait to make a sandwich with the leftovers!

Perfect.... but just to make it even more perfect i skillet fried it, meanwhile cooking a package of bacon about a little less than halfway and setting aside. As soon as venison was almost done but not yet cooked all the way(still moist and soft in the skillet), I took it off and wrapped the cut up pieces of venison in pieces of bacon accordingly and put a toothpick thru each one. Put it on a foil lined cookie sheet and baked it at 400 for about 10 mins or so (I have a convection) until browned and crispy on the edges and it was soooo good. The bacon seems to put the fat into what’s missing in the venison. Served with oven roasted asparagus and onions and my parmesan garlic red potatoes mashed my hubby adored ??????

Sorry but the soy and Worcestershire was WAY overwhelming. I was hoping for something enhance the flavor of the venison, not hide it.

We loved it but I messed up so I will have to make it again before I can give a 5 stars to it. I followed the recipe the best I could. I did not have dried mustard or red pepper flakes. I used regular yellow mustard and cayenne pepper in place of the missing ingredients. The second mess up , which was not mine, was the package of venison steak was actually venison stew. No problem just marinated the stew meat for a few hours. I put in a clay covered pot in oven on low for 2 hours. I think one hour would have been enough. The meat was a little dry ( I should have added some water or wine during the cooking to keep from drying out). The flavor was great. Loved the hint of heat from the cayenne pepper.  My husband kindly ate his dinner and asked for me to use the marinade again. I will definitely try again as we have a very full freezer of venison this year.

First time making venison steaks and this was fantastic!  I followed exactly.  I did defrost the steaks overnight in fridge in milk. Then, marinated steaks for 10 hours, flipping bag in fridge every so often.  It's a keeper!!!

This was delicious! I didn't add the red pepper flakes or the hot pepper sauce, but after marinating for only one hour, and then grilling, the steaks were very good.

Awesome.  I had never had venison steaks before so was a little nervous about the taste.  This marinade was so good and the steaks were awesome.  I didn’t have lime juice so I used 2 tsp 7-Up instead. Very good!

have an abundance of elk and deer in my freezer, i can't stand plain deer meat like i do elk but this marinade recipe is the best, it's my go to and i can't wait to try it with elk!! i like it spicy so i will probably add way more of the spicy ingredients because this recipe is pretty mild.

I’m really impressed! I backed off a little bit on the red pepper, but this is the best marinade I’ve made in 45 years.

Excellent!   Used it on a venison tenderloin exactly as written and received endless compliments.

Many longtime hunters in our mancave and lots of venison this time of year. I get volunteered to grill/smoke the meat on my BGE. I had 2lbs of backstrap but only doubled the marinade. Not overpowering and all the flavors whisped through the meat. Everyone said it was the best they ever had! Backstrap was cooked whole, not 'steaked' out.

I let the steaks marinate for about 10 hours.  They turned out excellent!  Others really liked it that it took out some of the "gaminess".  Was asked for the marinade recipe after the first try.

Absolutely amazing!  I inadvertently marinated for 48 hours (we had last minute plans for dinner out 2 nights in a row) and was a little concerned it would be too strong - no worries!  It was fantastic, made exactly as recipe specifies - thanks SO much, Emily!

Very nummy! I cut the salt in half and used it to marinate 2.5 lbs of venison steak. I doubled the recipe and used a 12oz can of Mr Pib to make sure all steaks were covered.  After I grilled them, I put the marinade on the stove, heated it up, added some flour and thickened it up for a sauce, spicy but good.  I've made this recipe 3 times and loved it every time!

Great! I used this (with these measurements) on 2 pds of cubed venison. Use 2 tsp mustard seed. Add 2 tsp of baking powder! The chemical reaction with the lime juice (the whole lime) and Worcestershire will help tenderizer the meat even more. Science is cool! And I left out the hot sauce but otherwise simply awesome!

The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to put all the marinade ingredients in the blender before adding the marinade to the meat.  I left it in the refrigerator overnight.  It was absolutely delicious, and is my new go-to venison recipe.

This may be one of the best, if not the best, marinades I've ever had - period. Super flavorful, little bit of kick. Hard to beat. I substituted dry mustard for a little Dijon mustard. So good!!!

Usually I turn my nose up at venison because of the smell and the taste, but this was awesome!  Marinated overnight and quick fried in canola oil.  Awesome!  A definite keeper.

This was super delicious! I was missing a few ingredients but was able to improvise. Instead of using dried minced garlic, I used powdered, and I was out of hot pepper sauce and did not replace it with anything. I used my little indoor grill on 400 degrees and cooked them for 5 minutes, they came out super juicy, tender and a little pink on the inside, the way I like it. :) The marinade took a lot of the "gamey" flavor away, which I don't mind anyways. I highly recommend this recipe! Next time hopefully I will have the hot pepper sauce to try it that way!

Dynamite!!!  I used this on doe fillets right out of the freezer.  I followed the directions to a T, except grilled them for about 3.5 minutes on each side.  They came out wonderful!

This review is based on my DH's opinion only.  He is the venison eater, I ate the grilled veggies and 'Grilled Baked Potatoes' from AR. He really liked the marinade and how it flavored and tenderized the steaks.  This was the perfect amount for two steaks.  I had to make two substitutions in the recipe to use what I had on hand - minced fresh garlic and onion in place of the dried.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Thorney.  Next time, I will marinade a steak for DH and chicken for me so that I may enjoy it also.

FIRST time I've ever LIKED venison!  The recipe was spot on, a bit warm for me although I'm bland when it comes to any type of heat.  Hubby, who is a Tabasco person loved it.  Everyone else at dinner LOVED it, many comments on the great taste.  This recipe has opened my eyes that there is such a thing as good venison.  Thanks for sharing!!

Loved the marinade.  Totally eliminated any "gamey' taste.
