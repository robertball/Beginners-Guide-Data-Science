Made this for Recipe Group and we loved it! I did boil my potatoes whole because I like the texture of them better that way. Also, all I had on hand was shredded cheddar cheese, so I went with that. I thought the amount of mayo was not gonna be enough, but I followed the recipe anyway and it turned out perfectly creamy and delicious! I prepared this the night before, so that I could just bake it when I was ready and that worked out very well. My oven is super hot, so it only took about 25 mins. to bake. I served it with 'slow cooker ham' fron this site, which was a perfect match. This was a BIG hit with my family, and I will be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing! :)

Recipe Group selection 10/22/11.  I have had and made hot potato salad in the past that wasn't well received, so I worried about this one.  I omitted the relish and olives due to personal tastes, but there was plenty of flavor from the bacon and cheese.  I used red skin potatoes so I didn't peel them and it worked just fine.  Thanks for a very nice recipe.

Made for Recipe Group. I did not add olives as I don't like them and used celery flakes instead of celery salt. I'm assuming they add saltiness to the potatoes, because without them they lack any salt. That is an easy enough fix. I like hot German potato salad, but didn't care for the pickle relish in this. Maybe it's just a mind thing. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious and addicting!  I was a tad skeptical about the relish and almost left it out, but I am so glad I didn't because IT made this potato salad.  There was just the right amount of creaminess from the mayo and sweetness from the relish.  I sprinkled extra bacon and cheese on top and the family couldn't stop saying how good it was.  This will be a definite keeper in my house

Made this for the Recipe Group.  We loved it!  I'm with Christina on thinking that the amount of mayo wasn't gonna be enough but it was perfect!  I didn't bake my bacon on top cause I thought it would over cook since it was already cooked perfect so I just sprinkled it on when the potatoes were done.  Tons of flavor and delicious!  Thanks!

Recipe Group Selection:  22, October '11  My husband took one bite and said "This is good!"  I had a bunch of leftover baked potatoes so I used those with the skins on for this recipe.  I was hesitant to use the sweet pickle relish as I am not a fan of it.  I'm so glad I used it as it really adds to this delicious dish.  I did omit the olives because we don't care for them.  The mayonnaise is just the right amount with the cheese cubes because when they melt it makes for a very creamy potato.  Thanks lutzflcat for sharing your recipe.  RG made a great choice!

This was quite good...I did make a few subs based on what I had on hand. I used baby yukon golds, shredded cheese, and bacon bits. Had no green olives, but don't care for them anyway. Topped with green onions. I really enjoyed it; hubby preferred it cold the next day. Thanks for sharing!

Fixed as written except used shredded cheese instead of cubed. The addition of the relish and olives give it a sweet/salty dimension that is a nice touch. Will keep in the rotation

I made this for Recipe Group: This was pretty good, a little different but pretty good. We smoked a brisket and had people over I had a few people ask what was in it but no one gave out compliments on it. I liked it though. I used shredded cheese and I did prepare ahead of time but other than that I followed it exact.

This was very delicious.  I've made it twice, once as is and then without the olives and with chopped celery.  The olives add a nice salty component but my family prefers without olives.  Such a nice change from plain boiled potatos or au gratin!

I was sampling even before I put it in the oven to bake, and the flavor is awesome!  I love the sweet relish and olives.  I was skeptical, but based on other reviews, tried it anyway...  I'm glad I did!

This was alright. My parents and (gasp) "picky" husband liked this, but I wasn't a fan. I was skeptical about adding sliced olives to my potato salad, but they worked REALLY well in this. The salty olives complement the sweet relish nicely. Unfortunately, this is about the only aspect about this that appealed to me (sorry!). What I couldn't get past was how my cheese melted. It sorta melted, but not completely (it appeared to congeal in spots). This didn't seem to bother anyone but me (it wierded me out a bit), so I guess it boils down to a matter of personal preference. Maybe this will float your boat, but it did nothing for me. I will stick with traditional potato salad from now on. Thanks anyways, lutzflcat. :)

Love this recipe. I tried a potato salad years ago and haven't found anything similar until now.
