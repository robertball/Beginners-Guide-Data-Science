It tastes okay, BUT it is not thick at all.  I did exactly what the recipe said (ingredients, timing, everything). and basically got thin mushroom soup.  I think the broth should be cut in half for the amount of butter/flour (roué) being made, and possibly there should be more flour put in since the mushrooms also give off moisture.  Either that, or cook the mushrooms in the butter until softened; remove from heat and keep warm;  Start the pan fresh with melting 2 TBSP butter over Medium heat; add 2 TBSP flour and create the roué.   Slowly add ONE (1) cup beef broth to the roué, stirring until combined.   Add the mushrooms back in, then simmer on Low heat 10 minutes to let everything soak in and thicken.  Add the half-n-half, and pepper to taste, simmer until dairy has heated up and everything is combined.  Turn off the heat and allow mixture to simmer another 5 minutes on the cooling burner.
