I added chopped walnuts but it never thickened which is how I actually like it.  Nonetheless  it was very tasty. The lemon added a nice tang to it. Will make again.

I used 1 cup of raisins,  1/4 cup of sugar or less to taste, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and only 2 cups of half and half so it would be creamer.  i used cinnamon instead of the stick ....tasted great and was every bit creamy.
