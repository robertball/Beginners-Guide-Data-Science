I made this for Christmas breakfast and my family loved it! We used tater tots instead of bread and bacon instead of ham otherwise I followed the recipe.

I made changes to this recipe, instead of 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup rice flour, I switch the two, two cups rice flour and 1 cup reg flour, (donâ€™t use any other milk besides dairy milk, I used coconut milk one time and messed it up) I use 2  1/2 cups of sugar , and I personally use brown sugar instead of white with cinnamon added on top.
