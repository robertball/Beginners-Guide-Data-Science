"Amazing" just about sums this one up! I have had this one saved forever, but kept putting it off because I have never been a big fan of olives.  Little by little, I think I've been acquiring a taste for them, plus many people insist they hate olives, but the love muffaletta sandwiches, and I know I love them too.  So, I made this to use in Muffaletta Pizza from this site, and I'm so glad I did! I could not stop eating it straight out of the bowl, and I can think of tons of ways to eat this wonderful concoction!  Only change was to use slightly less green olives (I had about 4 oz. left of a jar) and a large can of black olives, and ended up using 1 tbsp each of the brines.  Simply fabulous!  The salt and brine of the olives, toned down a bit by the artichokes, and the tang of the salad dressing go together perfectly!  Makes a fair amount, too, so I still have quite a bit leftover after using a cup for the pizza.  I can see this recipe being a regular staple in my fridge! Thanks for sharing, A.Z.!!!

This is the business! I loved it although I found the green olives to be a tad saltier than I like so next time, I'd probably rinse them. Thanks bunches! :o)

I just made this wonderful olive salad...now here's something...I put it all in my Ninja chopper.....and well it looks like a chunky spread. But that's okay by me. I followed the ingredients to a T and only added just a 1/2 tbsp more brine. And used Light Italian Dressing in place of regular...and wow!! yum. I put on some multi grain crackers and topped with a slice of cherry tomatoe...WOW I couldn't wait the 12 hours to try. So if it's wonderful now...12 hours from now it's going to be the bomb! TY AZ!!! this is so light and yummy and pack full of olive & artichoke flavor...it's hmmmm hmmm delish!

Boy - I so did not like this at all.  I love muffalatas - so I'm not sure what is up with this one.  Everyone else loved it - so I'll own it must be me.
