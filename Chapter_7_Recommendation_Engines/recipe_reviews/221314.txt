I used to make this from an old cookbook years ago and lost the cookbook after several moves across the country. Really happy to find it here on Allrecipes. Thanks, Jason. It is, indeed, a wonderful meatloaf...

I made your recipe last weekend and it was awesome.  I'm not sure how fine the onions, carrots and apple were suppose to be but I shredded mine in my food processor so they were still quite visible in the meatloaf.  It stayed together well and had a great taste.  Thanks for your recipe and this will be my go-to one for sure.

Tried this and Grandma was on to something with the apple! Has a different spin than the same old meatloaf. 
I know some Gaydos'es..

This is very similar to my grandma's meatloaf from about the early 1900's. I imagine it was made with kitchen staples at the time, so they had very little seasoning options. The difference in my recipe is that I make it with either bread crumbs or butter crackers, or a combo of them, salt, pepper, garlic & Worcestershire. Everything else is the same. Nothing fancy, basic comfort food from grandma. I've tried other recipes but always come back to this.

Wow. I really wasn't expecting much from this recipe, but it was amazing! I've been looking for a low sugar meatloaf recipe (surprisingly hard to find) and now I have to look no further! Due to my husband's diet restrictions, I substituted turkey for beef and used gluten free bread crumbs. Next time I think I'll double the recipe for more leftovers. Oh and bonus- my 17 month old ate his entire serving. I could see a little bit of sage being a really good addition. Thank you Jason!

I made this meatloaf last night and it was a huge hit! Tonight I sliced up the leftovers and fried them in a bit of butter. Yum! The two minor changes I made was that I finely grated the onion, carrot and apple, so my kids wouldn't pick them out, and I used a pink lady apple instead of a granny smith (what I had on hand). Will definitely be making this one again!!

It's become a meal we make often! I use Italian bread crumbs as well. What I've learned from the three times I've made this: use Italian bread crumbs for added flavor, I use 1/2 an onion (my household isn't a fan of onions), cut the apple and onion pieces to the same size, and watch your fingers as everyone digs in! I can't wait to try it with venison!

Even though Italian style bread crumbs were all I had, this recipe would benefit from the addition of some salt and pepper.  It has a nice texture, and I like the nutritional benefit of using a carrot and an apple.  Except for the crumbs, I followed the recipe and the method exactly.  I think it would also benefit from some kind of topping, or sauce.  Unfortunately, there aren't enough drippings to make a sauce, so I will have to wing it.  I don't prepare meatloaf very often, so I will probably go back to the way my mom taught me.

I was surprised at how good this was. I especially loved the carrots and apple in the meatloaf. Next time I will chop the carrots a bit finer. So good! The reason I was surprised was because I always think of ketchup in or at least on a meatloaf, but wanted something without sugar. This definitely hit the spot! I did add a few shakes of salt and pepper to it, but am sure would be just fine without. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Someone said this is dry and bland. My meatloaf is similar, but I add 1/2 C. (not 3 T.) of liquid, such as broth or milk or tomato sauce -- whatever is on-hand. It gets absorbed nicely into the the 1 C. of bread crumbs. I also add 1/2 green bell pepper and 1/2 tsp. dried basil. I like to use very lean ground beef in meatloaf; otherwise, it's greasy and difficult to slice. That said, a nice touch is to lay 2 or 3 slices of bacon across the top while baking for 75 minutes, uncovered. The bacon gives it a wonderful flavor! I bake mine in a loaf pan.

This was very simple and cheap.  Not a ton of flavor, but you can always add seasoning if you like a more flavorful meatloaf.

Very moist and holds together well as a loaf--not too crumbly. I also appreciate that it doesn't call for any prepackaged ingredients, as most meatloaf recipes I've seen do. I grated the onion, carrot, and apple instead of dicing. Husband said it's a keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe as written.  I grate the carrots to hide them from my kids, but it's great either way. Thank you for a delicious meatloaf recipe without catsup!

Very good.  I used ground Turkey because i thought that would compliment the apple and just added some salt and pepper to taste.  A winner for everyone.

Tommi and kids love this.  Tom is indifferent.  Goes well with sweet chili sauce as an accompanying condiment.

For a healthier meal I doubled the vegetables (carrots, onions and apples) and skipped the bread, but did all the rest following the recipe. It turned out ok, as good cold as warm but a bit blend. I cannot imagine what it would have been strictly as the recipe recommended ! So if I'm doing it again (as I liked the veggies idea) I shall try to boost it up with red wine, rosmarin and red pepper flakes).

The secret is the added moisture.  Also the breadcrumbs will soften the mixture.  There are a lot of meat loaf recipes out there, so try them all and see which one is the best for your tastes.

Generally I use beef pork and veal for meatloaf in equal amounts.  It suits me.

This was very good. I added salt and pepper and topped with some tomato sauce, because that's how we like our meatloaf. The addition of the apple had me nervous, but it worked. Will make again.
