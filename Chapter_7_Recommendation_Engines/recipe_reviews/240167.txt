Tasty and quick. This is more of a 3.5 stars. It was a nice change of pace. I wouldn't say this really screams eggnog. It tastes more like exactly what is is....spiced up cashew milk. Not a bad thing. Perfect for those who have dietary restrictions and much healthier than eggnog! Love the simplicity. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Amber. :)
