Wasn't sure about the cheese on Cod but it worked! The Orzo could use more salt maybe even a bit of chili pepper flakes..  a little bland for my liking buy Connie, my wife, first this out of her mouth after the first bite went in, was "OMG this is good!"  She gave it 5 stars I gave it 3... so we averaged it out to a strong 4 star recipe.

This is great.  I followed the other reviewer's advice and added some crushed red papper, and the little bit of heat was a nice touch.  Next time I will add more cheese over the top of the dish.  It melted nicely with the rice and tomatoes.  This is a very comforting meal.

It was the bomb!  I made as directed but added jalape√±os and Italian cheese.  Next time I make this I will add a layer of fresh spinach and a layer of sliced fresh mushrooms before adding the cod.  I could imagine I was eating lobster!  A glass of white wine will finish it off perfectly!  Mmmm

I always tweek anything I make whether new or old.  This recipe was a good foundation for what I made.  I didn't have cream of celry soup but I did have cream of mushroom soup and heavy cream.  I did finely chop a stalk of celry and put it in the recipe. I added two tbsp of lemon juice. I added a tbsp of old bay seasoning, I added 3 cups of frozen spinach. I doubled the recipe because I had a little over 1 1/2 pounds of fish. I have some extra garlic croutons and crushed them and added them to the top of the cheese. It turned out totally delicious!

Used risotto instead which gave it a smooth texture but a bit more structure.

My oven recently went out so I had to cook this on top of the stove. It turned out great! My husband is picky about his food so I cooked the pasta, sauce and fish in separate pans and prepared it on our plates. I thought the sauce needed a little something extra so I chopped up a chipotle pepper and it tasted great!

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I added some crushed red pepper like other reviewers suggested, and I really did not like it. The orzo was overcooked (even though I boiled it for less time than instructed), the stewed tomatoes were just too big and unappetizing, and the flavors (including the cheese on the cod) did not seem to mesh well. Probably just not the right flavor profile for me, but I will not be making this again.

Delicious! I've made some minor tweaks.  SInce I didn't have any stewed tomatoes, I've used marinara sauce. It worked out fine.  And I've used another one of Aldi's frozen cods for my fish. I'm not too sure about the browning part, since my fish broke in half. But it was filling nonetheless! I'll make it again for sure.

Was unsure about this recipe, but decided to make it after reading reviews. It was delicious!  I plan to try some of the suggestions in other reviews (add spinach, broccoli, etc.) next time.

Husband still doesn't think white fish and tomatoes belong in the same place. It was just ok.

I did not have any orzo pasta so I used elbow macaroni in the recipe. Will make again but will add more cod and pasta as there was too much sauce left

Very tasty and quick recipe! I used petite diced tomatoes, as I didn't have stewed on hand. I did add some Old Bay seasoning, and I used a 9x9" pan, as a 9x13" pan seemed a bit much. My husband enjoyed it also, so I will definitely make this again.

I made this as directed with the exception of the cheese. I left the cheese out altogether, and this was really a wonderful dinner.

This was a very good recipe. I used a quart of tomatoes I had canned this summer, added hot pepper flakes, and put a layer of fresh spinach and then Italian cheese. I will make again, but will use 6 cod fillets, as there is a lot of base, esp with the spinach!

I tried this tonight and all family members liked it. I added broccoli to the final three minutes of cooking orzo. I also threw in some whole cherry tomatoes. Tasty complete and quick meal. A nice change in flavours for fish.

Delicious!  I made a few substitutions based on other comments and what I had available in my kitchen -- no capers, subbed cream of mushroom soup for cream of celery, added chopped celery and chopped onion, used canned diced tomatoes with green chilies. The flavor was spectacular, I'd make it again.

Delicious dish. The stewed tomatoes I could find were sliced instead of diced, so it didn't look quite like the screenshot but still wonderful. Never had capers before and the only ones I could find were jarred like olives in liquid - add a nice tang to the flavor.

My wife though it was a five I though i was a three. OK but I think it would be better to use chicken. I did not have a small can of tomatoes so I used rotel.
