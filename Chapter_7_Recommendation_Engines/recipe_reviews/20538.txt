As someone who lives in Germany, this is the biggest holiday hit you can find!  It is available everywhere in towns and the popular christmas markets and this is exactly how to make it.  Although, I wouldn't add the water, but instead substitute orange juice to give it more of a zest.  Drink it while it's hot!

Outstanding!!! I made this recipe with two 1.5 L bottles of Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon. I quadrupled the rest of the ingredients and subsituted orange juice for the water. After simmering the juice mixture I transfered it to the crock pot set on high and added the wine. After it was hot I kept it warm. It happened to be Halloween and 30 degrees outside so I offered "to go" cups to the parents of the trick or treaters! They loved it! This is a fabulous recipe and one that I will make throughout the holidays! Thanks for sharing!

This was my contribution to a house party I attended. I used Merlot that I bottle myself and substituted 1/2 the water with Tropicana orange juice.  I also removed the simmering oranges from the pot, removed the cloves, sliced the oranges into thick slivers and returned them to the pot. I then transferred everything to a crock pot to keep warm.  It was a great hit with the guests and I will certainly make it again, and again.  Many thanks for this keeper.

I normally am not a wine drinker, but I was having guests for Christmas, one of whom is of German ancestry (my brother-in-law), and I wanted to serve something a little differentand special.  This was a big hit; even I loved it.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I substituted orange juice for the water.  My brother-in-law commented that it tasted just like his late mother's recipe.  Quite a compliment.

Excellent.  I made this using two tangerines, about 16 cloves, and half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  The citrus tends to get a bit of pulp into the wine, so strain it before serving if you mind pulp.  Also, if you're serving this to people who don't usually drink wine, I recommend using a sweet wine like Shiraz -- I used a (dry) burgundy and even with the sugar, the initial taste was quite tart when the wine was served hot.

This keeps well refrigerated -- just warm in the microwave when you want to serve it.

WOWEE!  This is good stuff!  We had this on Christmas and on New Year's Eve and it was a hit both times.  We used merlot and it turned out great.  The only thing is that I could never get it to the syrupy stage so we just added the wine after simmering awhile.  You won't be disappointed!

Made this recipe between Christmas and New Year 2000 and it went down a treat.  I'll definitely be making it again.  Advice... drink it whilst it is still warm; when it cools it's just not the same.

Fantastic! I used orange juice in place of water and reduced the sugar to about a 1/2 cup. I used 4 cinnamon sticks and even added a few dashes of ground cinnamon toward the end. Often, I like to add a few splashes of brandy. It makes it a bit more potent, which is especially nice if your wine got a little too warm and some alcohol evaporated. I've already made this so many times, I had to make sure I put my review in.

I'm not a fan of red wine and so I used blush.  I have also used white wine and it has come out great.  I also add 1 Tbls lemon juice, 2 sticks of cinnamon and no water.  Very good!

Cheap wine is the best!!! Seriously! My husband and I fell in LOVE with this drink while on vacation in Bavaria, Germany. We made this drink with an expensive bottle of Merlot, then did a second batch with a cheaper brand (Barefoot Merlot...$5.99 a bottle). The cheaper brand DEFINITELY had the RIGHT taste and smell! Reminded us of being at the Christmas Market at Marienplatz in Munich -after the following changes. The things I did different was scale back the sugar to 1/2 cup and used orange juice instead of water (and still used the whole orange) per bottle. Done this way...it's like you're getting the drink straight from Germany!

I've been looking for a recipe for this since I left Austria! I went there in 1996 to visit my friends who live in Vienna, and I had this in Krungel (a town where Badmitterndorf ski school is located) and it was great after skiing all day!  Thanks and we enjoy it!

I'm not German, and have never heard of this drink before.  But, just by looking at the ingredients I knew it would be yummy.  Sure, enough...I made it for all of my friends and now they're all asking me for the recipe!  THANK YOU!!

Absolutely great recipe for the traditional German Gluehwein! I served this just yesterday (12/20/03) and everyone loved it. I did add just a little orange juice, just because I used very strong homemade wine! Thank you for this recipe...will use it again next year!

This is amazing! I made a triple recipie of this for a party, using Tropicana orange juice instead of the water, and I reduced the white sugar a bit and added just a little bit of brown sugar. It did not get syrupy, but with that much orange juice I didn't expect it would. I tripled the cinnamon sticks, but still only used 10 cloves, and only one orange. For wine, I used 1 and 1/2 bottles of Sawmill Creek shiraz. I added 2 bottles while it was on the stove, and then kept it warm in the crock pot, adding another 1/2 bottle directly to the crock pot (the full 3 bottles wouldn't fit). The porportions worked out perfectly though. Very yummy, and very cozy drink.... will definitely make again!

Well, if we had followed the recipe exactly maybe it would have been better. It was way too sweet for our taste. We used orange juice instead of water, as suggested by many people. If you are a wine drinker, especially a dry red wine drinker, don't use orange juice. It makes it too sweet! I will still be looking for another good mulled wine recipe. The search continues...

I have made this several times.  I have substituted orange juice for water, an orange juice/pineapple juice mixture & an apple juice/orange juice mixture for the water. On all I used 2 cinnamon sticks instead of 1.  Fabulous!  I also substituted some of the white sugar with brown sugar.  Equally yummy.  I also tried it the original way, but added an extra cinnamon stick.  It is really good when you get the mixture thick.  I used local muscadine wine.  No matter how it is fixed, it is hard to beat!  A real crowd pleaser.

Sooooo good with a few changes.  Instead of boiling the water with sugar, I boiled store bought orange juice.  I did not push the cloves into an orange peel, I just threw them in at the same time as the cinnamon stick.  After 30 minutes I added the wine and then I added more sugar, orange juice and water to taste.

Yum!  We live in Belgium and have been going to all the Christmas markets here, Germany, and Holland.  Our favorite part of the markets is drinking the different Gluehweins.  I'm so happy you posted this recipe!!  Used orange juice instead of the water and it was wonderful!!  Will become a winter staple in our house now.

I am an American living in Holland and I make this recipe every year during the holidays.  I also add a splash of cherry liqueur (Kirsch) and place pitted cherries (NOT maraschino) in the bottom of the mug before serving.  Everyone loves it!

I even impressed my German friends.  I used OJ instead of water and used a ton of cloves. Because of being crunched for time I made the 'sauce' several days before my christmas party, leaving in the orange, cloves and cinnamon. Reheated, strained the debris and served ... AMAZING!!!

I have been making the recipe since it first made it's appearance on this sight years ago.  I make a double-batch, exactly as written, and it is always a hit.  There is nothing like the way it makes your house smell.  I am hosting Thanksgiving at my house and my guests have already checked to make sure we will have plenty of this around for those cold Michigan nights.

Yummy... and the smell is wonderful.  I always make this during the Holidays, and everybody loves it (even my husbands sister who thinks alcohol is yucky).  This is a staple in our house during the winter months.  I usually cut down on the sugar by 1/4 cup, and add and exra 1/4 cup of water.  We always buy the cheap wine for this.

I really liked this spiced wine - I think next time I will put a little less sugar in it (I think 1/2 cup would be fine).  I'll definitely make it again - my friends and I enjoyed it today after our wreath making session - it's very festive!

This was incredible! I left it on low heat for about an hour to keep it warm and it reduced down a bit to a sweet, spicy, rich nectar. So my mistake made it even better! I'm making it again tonight.

Quite tasty. Try to pierce the orange with the cloves before you cut the orange. It is quite difficult to pierce the orange skins after the orange has been juiced. Do not worry if you are unable to pierce the orange skin with the cloves; just place the cloves and the orange flesh/peel in the sugar water.  I strained the beverage as I poured it into the mugs.

This is an amazing recipe. It tastes just like what I drank while living in Germany. I made it for a bunch of friends for Thanksgiving and everyone really loved it. I kept getting compliments.  That said, I used 2 bottles of cabernet sauvignon by Yellow Tail. I then doubled everything else but may have added a bit more sugar since I didn't measure exactly. The only thing I changed was I used mulling spices that I picked up from the store. I just put those in a large tea ball and let them steep. I also combined all the ingredients at once because I wanted a good portion of the alcohol to burn off. Everyone I know loves this and I give out the recipe pretty much every time I make it.

I lived in Germany for several years and have missed gluehwein tremendously. I found this recipe this year and tried it using the recommended orange juice instead of water and a merlot for the wine.  Amazing! Just as strong and fume-y as I remembered it (you'll see)! :)  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Will be making this regularly during the holidays. Double this for sure - if you are having company. Kick it up with a shot of brandy when serving. Puts it over the top! I used an inexpensive red wine (zin) and it was perfect.

WUNDERBAR!  We loved this recipe.  I did cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, added an extra cinnamon stick, the juice of 1 lemon, and then strained the whole thing before serving.  Made it with a simple Burgandy wine...I bet a Pinot Noir or Beaujolias would be good too.  It was even better the second day after the flavors had blended more.

I had the pleasure of going to Germany several years ago, and this brought back some wonderful memories of that trip. This recipe is absolutely fantastic! My Husband is a diabetic, so I replaced the sugar with "Splenda Granular" and the recipe turned out great! Thanks for sharing your recipe Else!

This could be great.  Unless you're a sugar addict, I'd cut the sugar down to 1/2c.  Following some suggestions I used low sugar oj and still found this too sweet. For this I used Barefoot Merlot for the wine. Great start though :)

Orange juice instead of water and this is PERFECT. I am told by every German I know that this is the original recipe. Oh so good!!! Also yummy if Cherry juice is substituted for the water.

I made this for friends who were on a float in our town's Christmas Parade. I used brown sugar instead of white, and poured it into several insulated mugs with lids. Everyone wanted the recipe, and it helped them warm up after a night on a float. (I suspect it helped us all *float* home, too!) The only other change was that after the sugar/water/orange peel mixture boiled, I turned the stove off and let it sit while I did an errand. When I returned, the mixture had thickened. Since I used a small saucepan, I heated half of the wine in the microwave then added everything into a large thermos. My husband said he could smell it when the thermos was opened! Oh, since there was already orange juice in it, I also added about 1/2 cup of 
orange liquer for an extra shot of cheer. Will definitely serve again! Thanks for the recipe.

If I could give this recipe more stars, I would.  We simmered the sugar, water, OJ, cinnamon and cloves on the stove and then transferred  to the crockpot when it was time to add the wine.  We started with 2 bottles of Kendall Jackson Pinot Noir, and it was gone within about 15 minutes.  We actually had to go to the grocer for three more bottles of Pinot Noir!  It was amazing!

I wanted this "crockpot" style to stay nice and warm for the duration of the party. Well, just forget that! It was gone within 30 minutes, doubling the recipe just wasn't enough (for 16 people). Everyone raved as they downed this rosy-warm aromatic drink. Have back-ups pre-made. The trick I used with the crockpot was adding 2 inches of water, turning it on high with a lid while the oranges/cloves simmered in the oj mixture (not water) to get it nice & hot. So, instead of adding the wine to the stovetop pot, I dumped everything in the crockpot after the oranges were finished simmering. This worked great but I knew I was in trouble when it only filled it halfway. I used Yellowtail Shiraz/Cabernet as someone else suggested. Too good! Will make as often as I can.

This makes the best gluehwein!  I've served it numerous times now, and I think it does taste better with the orange juice instead of the water, and reducing the sugar somewhat.  I've also transferred it to my crockpot to keep warm, and used it while sitting around the firepit.  Fabulous!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Else!

Delicious! Like other reviewers I used orange juice instead of water. I put the cloves into a tea ball to steep instead of shoving them into the orange skin (it was too tough and I broke a few cloves trying).

We love this!  I am an Airforce wife currently living in Germany.  And let me tell you, this is WAY better than the stuff they serve at the German Christmas markets.  I made it for our Christmas party, but I used orange juice instead of water as the other reviewers suggested.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to make either.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  This will be a tradition in our home every winter...Thank You ELSE!

As many others have previously said, I too have fond memories of drinking Glühwein at many a Christkindlesmarkt when I was stationed in Germany.  I recall being so surprised that I liked it because I typically drink Spätlese and find red wines such as Merlot too bitter.  I made this with Shiraz, as a few reviewers suggested, to keep things on the sweeter side.  I also used orange juice in place of water as many reviewers suggested.  I think using a cinnamon stick and whole cloves are genius as ground versions would overwhelm it.  I have tried many other Glühwein recipes and been sorely disappointed, however, this tastes just like the  Glühwein I remember.  Thank you, Else for sharing!

This is really good! I did cut back the water and sugar to 1/2 cup each. Everything else the same. Since I am the only one in my family that drinks wine I had to put most of this back in the bottle after it cooled. I thought it tasted better after it sat in the fridge for a couple of days. I like this hot or cold. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!  I prefer white wines over reds but decided to try this after tasting a "Christmas Wine" at a local winery.  This tasted better than what they served!  My husband asked me to make sure that I double the recipe the next time and to please have some when his mom comes over for Christmas dinner!  I'll be serving plenty of this... It's gonna be a very Merry Christmas!  :-)

No need to buy mulling spices with this recipe (seriously, I picked up some mulling spices at the store and realized that the ingredients on the package were the same as the ingredients for this recipe). This was soooo good!  The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar, I used 1/2 a cup instead of 3/4.  I also tried this with apple cider and it tastes great.

Delicious!  The only thing I would change next time is to cut the sugar down to half the amount.  I used OJ as other reviewers suggested, for extra flavour.  Looks pretty too in the Irish Coffee glasses.

I used a big bottle of Cab/Merlot and used OJ instead of water like others suggested. I also cut back on the sugar. This was delicious and a big hit at my party.  Will definitely make again!

My husband made this exactly as stated. We used a cheap red table wine. It was delicious & tasted like what we've had in Europe.

This wasn't as good as I was hoping. I didn't really taste any of the spices, and I added extra.  It was just warm wine for the most part.  Took it to a Christmas Eve party and not many people drank it.

This is a bit sweet for me, but the spices are really great. I used a Zinfandel. Next time I may use something a little drier, just to offset the sweetness a bit.

I have never heard of gluehwein but was looking for a festive spiced wine something for Christmas.  My mother-in-law loved it, sister-in-law hated it and I thought it was pretty good though not what I was looking for.  I followed the advice of others and used orange juice which made it too bitter for me - for me the water would have been the better choice.  I enjoyed the spicy taste and thought it was more like a dessert wine.

This is one of my favorite things to make for friends and family during the holidays!  It is sooo yummy and spicy and sweet, it warms you to the bone.  I use orange juice instead of water for added flavor.  For parties, I get a cheap cask of red wine and quadruple the recipe.  It never lasts long!

We made this on a whim one night after a recent blizzard in the northeast. I was hesitant to dedicating a bottle of wine to the effort since the last spiced wine we tried was so overspiced that it seemed like cough syrup. But this was a great balance of sweet and citrus and spicy, all without overpowering the wine. I didn't have an orange on hand so I used juice instead of the water and it came out great, I've already gotten requests to make it again and can't wait to try adjusting levels of cinnamon, clove and sugar for mild variations on the theme. A definite winner!

I took other people's suggestions and used orange juice instead of water. I also doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup of regular sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It went fast! My guests were asking for more. I will be making this again.

I was in Frankfurt, Germany last year for their Christmas Market.  All you can smell is Gluehwein, there is a vendor every few feet.  It was the best thing I had ever tasted!  This recipe is extactly like I remember it.

Turned out really good. Though after reading reviews, had done some modifications. Added less water, and replaced it with orange juice. Also, added little bit of nutmeg, star anise and 1/2 inch piece of ginger while boiling the water (step 1). Thank you for sharing the reviews and this amazing recipe!!

Excellent! Just made it for 2014 Christmas. I wanted to surprise my siblings who joined us at our house since we are of German descent. Everyone loved it! since I make my own homemade wine, I have tried it 3 different ways. But my first batch so far was the best, using Cabernet & Concord with the original recipe. I am definitely starting a new family tradition.   WEEZ

I make this every year.  I lived for 2 years in Germany and loved the Kristkindlemarkt gluehwein.  The smell filling the house is WONDERFUL, and brings back memories of walking around the market with the sounds of the traditional oom-pah-pah band in the background.  Fantastic.

Wonderful spiced wine! Very simple not a lot of expensive ingredients. I followed the recipe until the end when I added 2 more cinnamon sticks while heating the wine. Nice, spicy, and warming.

I'm thinking about adding some black peppercorn next time to see if I can get a spiced wine with a kick

This recipe was good with the orange juice instead of water, however the orange flavor was a bit over powering I recommend making a balance between water and orange juice to suit your taste. Still in general it was a great recipe, defiantly worth a try.

I, too, used orange juice in lieu of water, cut back the sugar a bit and used a Shiraz. My boyfriend doesn't like wine at all, but absolutely loved this. What a great find. Thanks for sharing

This was a hit, although it was too sweet for me.  But people came back for thirds!  The smell was awesome too.  I did NOT do the OJ, but rather followed the recipe and moved everything to a crock pot.  If you have a crowd, I recommend doubling this.

Fabulous recipe!  I thought doubling the recipe to use two bottles of wine would be more than enough for my small Christmas party, but it went over so well I ended up making another "double batch."  Merlot worked well, and as recommended, I kept it warm in the crock pot.  I may try reducing the sugar next time as it is definitely very sweet, but in no way over the top.

This was great for a holiday party that I went to. I used OJ instead of water, and it gave it more of a warm sangria taste. Very good! I used merlot. This was easy and fast. I will make it again!

I served this at a dinner party during the holidays and it was very well received.  This is not a sophisticated drink - it's a good, flavorful somewhat sweet spiced wine that can be successfully made with an inexpensive bottle of red wine.  I cut down on the sugar and used orange juice in place of the water.  It was kind of like a winter-time Sangria.  Yum.

I wanted something different this Christmas, so I gave this a try.  I really enjoyed it.  I used orange juice as others suggested, and was worried about it being too sweet, but it was lovely.  I used an inexspensive French wine and sipped it while preparing Christmas dinner. Sehr gut!  Danke, Else!

My boyfriend is from a tiny village near Wasserberg in Bavaria.  He was missing Gluehwein so I made this recipe for him and his boss, who is from Regensberg.  They say that this recipe is actually what they call "Punsch", and that Gluehwein is heated wine too but a bit different.  I dunno, maybe this is known as Gluehwein in other regions of Germany.  Still, we enjoyed this recipe very much!

The only reason I rated this a five is that there was no higher rating. I made it using burgundy wine and followed the suggestion of others and substituted the water with orange juice. Everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this often in the future. Thanks, Else.

I'm rating this from a POV of someone who hasn't had Gluehwein before but was looking for a good mulled wine for a holiday party.  Overall it was good but the general concensus was that it was too sweet, so we added another half bottle of merlot.  I would probably make it again with the initial 1 and a half bottles of merlot.

What a nice blend of flavors!  I ended up having to use ground cloves rather than whole ones and I felt that their flavor was far too strong...next time I will be sure to use whole cloves as the recipe calls for.

This recipe was excellent.  I used local plum wine for the red wine, which made the drink wonderfully sweet!

This is a wonderful drink by the fire when you have spent the day out in the cool, brisk air looking for that Christmas tree:~)  It is one of my fondest memories of Germany....sipping on a warm cup, trekking through the Christkindle Markt taking in the sights and smells of Munchen!  If you can get the wine "Bulls Blood" in your area, (I believe it is a Hungarian red wine) it absolutely will make the best gluehwein!  When I make my Gluehwein, I slice the orange and place the cloves within the orange.  Everyone has there own way of making it though, that is just my preference.  Try this, you will LOVE IT!

I made it as written, but I quadrupled the recipe for large group.  After it was done I put it in a slow cooker on low .  There wasn't a drop left at the end of the party.  It was a great hit!!

Served 3 years in Germany and this IS what they sell in the Christmas Market :) Saved all our gluhwein mugs and this does them justice, love it! BTW, if you have a lower-sugar palet, don't make it with orange juice, stick to water :D

Tasted exactly like German gluwhein. Really pleased with it. Id change very little but found two cinnamon sticks were nice, a little less sugar and a little more water or replace the extra water with orange juice and it'd be perfect. After cutting the orange in half, put the cloves in the orange halves before squeezing the orange as it becomes much harder to put the cloves in when it's already squeezed.

I used brown sugar. And one more trick. You don't need to warm up a glass if you put a clean tea spoon in it while poring. Then just remove the spoon. Voila!

Absolutely the perfect winter drink! Delicious! The first time we made it with a very nice zin and WOW! The second time we used a cabernet and it was also fantastic! It seems that it doesn't really matter what kind of red you use, which is great. Makes it really versatile. We will definitely keep this recipe!

I am German and have had lots of Gluehwein in my life, funny enough I never made it myself, since you can simply buy it anywhere in Germany. Since I've been in the US for many years, I looked for a recipe and I really enjoy this home made Gluehwein, it tastes great and authentic and I like that I can vary the ingredients if I want to, such as adding more orange joice, or adding spiced rum.
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it brings a piece of home to me :-)

This was great - only a couple things I did different - substitute water w/ OJ, 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4, and 2 cinnamon sticks instead of 1.  What made it great was how incredibly easy it was!

It's great, but I tried following one of the other reviews, and changed the water for OJ, and it made it much too sweet.  It's perfect just the way it is.

This Gluehwein recipe was great, and so easy to make. My aunt from Germany makes this every year for the holidays, and this was my first time trying it for myself.  It still wasn't quite as good as Aunt Helga's, but still very tasty and I would definitely make this again.

I used up a couple of bottles of partly finished reds(one Italian, one French)  for this recipe. I used half brown/white sugar and orange juice as recommended by other reviewers. The kitchen smelt wonderful and everyone enjoyed it. I will be making this again for New Years to keep us warm whilst watching fireworks.

I made this for a Christmas party last weekend.  I quadrupled the recipe and all if it was gone by the end.  The only change I made was cutting the water in half and adding OJ for the other half.  A very good German friend loved it.

Always a party favorite, especially when it's cold outside. I also substitute water with orange juice, add green apple and orange slices and a little berry rum which adds a real flavor kick. Yumm!

Almost exactly like what you can buy on the streets in central Europe.  I used OJ and just a very cheap merlot--turned out great.

One guest asked if it was potpurri. It does smell wonderful, but too overpowering to drink - maybe less oranges/cloves would help. While I found it easy to prepare, I give it a low rating due to its unpopularity at parties. Sometimes simpler is better - i.e., red wine as is.

Wonderful.  I took the suggestions of many reviewers and substituted orange juice for the water, and think it's a great change.  I'll definitely make this again.

What a great recipe!  I was skeptical at first about using 3/4 cup white sugar.  I thought it would be way too much, but it wasn't.  When I sipped the Gluehwein, the sweetness was perfect and all those memories from visiting Christmas markets in Germany came back.  Wonderful recipe.....thank you Else!

I actually haven't made this recipe, but it's so similar to what my Mom used to make that I will probably be using it for a crowd.  I'm familiar with making individual servings, without the water/sugar/orange step.  Put some red wine in a saucepan, add some sugar, cinnamon stick, half orange w/ juice and heat.  It is soo yummy and warming.  Definitely gives you a glow, inside and out!  :)

Not sure what I did wrong, but this didn't taste as great as I had hoped.  A little too sweet and not enough clove/cinnamon taste.

I will never buy bottled Gluehwein again (it's so hard to find anyway)!  Just the smell of this takes me back to Munich’s Christmas Market (Christkindlmarkt) that I visited as a child.  Thank you so much!

Used this recipe for this year’s Christmas party and it was loved by all! Doubled all the ingredients since there were about 12 guests. Keep the evaporation in mind and accordingly add a little bit more water and wine.

Tasty! I used the juice of 2 oranges, omitted boiling the orange halves in the syrup, substituted 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves for the whole cloves, and used 3 cinnamon sticks. Made this way the recipe tastes like the beverage sold in the Chicago Christkindlmarkt.

Growing up in Germany I drank gluhwein every Christmas, and this comes very very close to the real thing. I just remember it being a little stronger, maybe they added a bit more "umpf" in my hometown haha

Just got back from Germany and wanted Gluhwein like from the Christmas markets.  This is very good.  I didn't even have whole cinnamon or cloves so I used my regular powdered spices and I could not feel any gritty spice in my drink.  I would use whole spices for company and nice glass cups but plan to keep using my giant economy size cinnamon for personal use this winter.

This was just like the Traditional Gluhwein I had Wiesbaden Germany at a Christmas Market last week. I made a double batch and added some allspice berries. It was not quite sweet enough so I added a little cranberry juice and it was perfect!

My mom is from Germany and she always made this for Christmas eve when we opened presents.  Unfortunately, she had gotten to an age where she doesn't remember  what the measurements were.  This tasted just like how she made it. The only thing different was she didn't add the orange but I am sure it is a nice touch.  Thanks for sharing and keeping our Christmas Eve tradition.

I use red velvet red wine.  I followed are other recommendations to use orange juice in place of water. Some of our guests commented that the wine actually tasted better on ice. I noticed it got sweeter towards the bottom. A reminder to give it a stir while serving it. I will be making this over and over.

Came out perfect! I didn't have any whole cloves and substituted them for 1/2 teaspoon ground clove and it worked great.

Tastes like I remember it. Probably would've saved an hour if I knew to leave the lid off during the simmer/reduction.

Outstanding recipe. As SERVANTMARA suggested, I replaced the water with orange juice for more zest (same quantity) and I used 12 cloves (instead of 10). I used a Bordeaux wine called Louis Eschenauer. It was to die for. I will definitely make this again on Christmas Eve with the family.

Super yummy! I first had Gluehwein at a German Christmas Market here in town and fell in love. This tastes super similar! I'm diabetic so I altered a little bit and doubled the recipe. For 1.5L of Chianti red wine, I used water and only half the sugar...however I used 2 oranges instead of 1 and half a grapefruit. I'm excited to keep experimenting with this base!

Outstanding recipe! My husband and I make our own wine, so. . . I decided I wanted to make a Christmas wine this year. We made a Beaujolais . After it went through its entire fermentation process and was ready for modeling, I then made this recipe to add to it. I multiplied the recipe, cut back a-bit on the oranges and added some of my own other spices!  The taste was incredible. After simmering the entire pot we added it to our wine and then bottled two cases for friends and family for Christmas!  Here’s hoping they love it as much as we do!

I followed the rest of the reviewers suggestions and substituted orange juice for the water and it turned out so much better than I could have ever thought. My only complaint is there is no point in making a single batch, its just too good.

Always a huge hit at family gatherings.  I use brown sugar instead of white and it never seems to get thick and syrupy but maybe I get too impatient to drink it, it's good nonetheless.  I double it and put it in a crockpot.

Fantastic! I've made it 4 times now and have even tripled the recipe. It takes me back to the Weinachtsmarkt in Deutschland and is a huge hit at parties, with family on Christmas and great for New Years too!  I make it in a typical pot on the stove and once the wine is added and heated, I strain it into a crockpot to keep warm. I use a Merlot from Gnarly Head. It tastes great and makes you feel so warm and fuzzy.

Awesome and easy recipe!  Also did not use water, opting for orange juice instead.  Overall amazing!  Felt like being in Germany all over again!  Next time I'll use less sugar and a less expensive bottle of wine.

This recipe is amazing! The only thing I did differently was use orange juice (no pulp) instead of water and I cut the amount sugar in half because I didn't want it too sweet. I also added 5 cardamom pods along with all the other spices. I made it with Cabernet Sauvignon. Everyone loved it and kept going back for more!

This is the perfect balance of  spices to compete with any Christmas market in Germany. I have made it for years and do not change anything. I make the syrup days in advance and mix it with the wine just before the party.

I used raw can rather than white sugar otherwise followed the simple directions. Unfortunately the orange lacked really good flavor so I did add a splash of juice. It was wonderful.

The flavor of this was great but it was slightly too sweet even though I love sweet wines and desserts....I suggest not replacing the water with orange juice as others suggest and cutting sugar back to 2/3 cup if squeezing the juice of the whole orange in.  I used Merlot.  Thank you for the recipe!

Things I changed: I used 7 cloves instead of 10.  I added 1 cardamom pod.  Of the 3/4 cup sugar; I split it 50:50 white sugar, brown sugar.  For the red wine: I used a red blend (Llano signature red: Cab sav, merlot, malbec).  I thought this was way too sweet.  Also, I had mini mandarins, so I used 1.5 of those instead of 1 orange. In my tasting, I thought some almond would be a nice addition.  I added a touch of amaretto to the mug, it tasted good.  When I make again, I would use 6 tbsp brown sugar and almond slivers, or 4 tbsp brown sugar + 2 tbsp amaretto.

I'm giving the recipe 5 stars even though mine took extra work to be drinkable! They didn't have either of the red wines I had hoped to use, so I got cupcake merlot. It was not at all like the spiced wine I had at a German restaurant, but I added honey to make it taste okay. I want to make it again with wine I like, because it was the merlot itself that did not taste good. I hoped the spices would fix that, but it didn't.

Delicious and cozy on a winter night. My hubby lived in Germany for a while and he says this is just like the stuff he had there.

Thanks for the recipe! I added another cinnamon stick & a few more cloves. This was perfect! I was missing the spirited German Christmas Markets we experienced last year. Your recipe helped bring some of the cheer to my home this year.

As the recipe stands, I give it 4 stars because I think it's too sweet. But that can be easily rectified by making the sugar syrup as in step 1, setting half of it aside, then continue with the recipe as written. When finished, add more of the reserved sugar syrup (or not) to taste. Forget Christmas, this is wonderful all year long! Oh, and to give this a Swedish twist, serve with raisins and/or slivered almonds in the mug. Absolutely divine.

Each time I visit Germany, I try to make sure it's at a time when I can hit a Weinachtsmarkt and drink glühwein. This is an excellent recipe! I didn't use sugar, but rather six packets of Splenda. I realized this was about 2/3 the sweetness that I would have gotten using the amount of sugar in the recipe, but I figured I could add more later, if need be. (6 packets were just right.) I did strain the glühwein before serving and then just put it back in the pot and set it on the kosher setting on the stove. After all, I didn't want the alcohol to cook off.

Excellent winter drink! Like others I used more OJ than the one orange, but otherwise made as directed. Our au pair from Austria says this is just like what they drink at home. Will be a holiday favorite at our house from now on.

I can understand why a lot of people would enjoy this-- for me, though, it was just too sweet, even after DOUBLING the amount of wine.  BUT-- it was easy to make!  And I found that allspice was a suitable substitute for the cloves, which I didn't have on hand.

I'd never heard of this, let alone had it before. I'm not a big fan of red wines, so I thought this was just okay. I drank the whole batch in two days, while it was snowing outside. Certainly, this is much better served hot; if you don't drink it quickly enough and it gets cold, it doesn't taste nearly as good.
I made this exactly as written. However, the sugar/water mixture didn't get "thick and syrupy" within 30 minutes; maybe it's my elevation (6200 feet), or maybe I didn't have my "simmer" set high enough. I hope that wasn't a crucial part of the recipe. I also didn't get all the juice out of the orange halves (squeezed by hand), but they were pretty large, so I got a lot of juice anyway. But thanks for an introduction to this kind of drink; perhaps I'll find one that will "wow" me someday. Oh, and the wine I used was a 2006 California Shiraz (by Charles Shaw).

Not very good. I made it for Christmas Eve, and I thought it tasted bad. Noone went back for seconds. I made it exactly to the recipe, but I did use cheap Merlot, maybe try to use a good, sweet red wine.

Maybe it was just me but there was something about this that I didn't care for. It could have been the brand of wine which I used (Black Opal) but the aroma of the warm wine made it very difficult to drink.

a tasty and spicy (and alcoholic) alternative to hot cider.  i used orange juice instead of the water and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup on a friend's recommendation--turned out great!  as he said, it's pretty hard to screw this up!

Way too sweet for me, but yummy just the same.
