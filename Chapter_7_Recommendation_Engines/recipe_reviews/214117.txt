I made this recipe as is. It was a little too sweet for me. I used four hamburger buns for the topping which totaled 6 oz. It is a rich and flavorful dessert, very tasty but next time I will change it a bit. I would double the rhubarb just because I like lots of rhubarb and like it less sweet. I also think it needs more liquid in the rhubarb, something to soak up the bread a bit. Overall  I think this recipe is a keeper and worth repeating.

Husband really liked this with French vanilla ice cream. I used just plain old hamburger buns.I thought a little too sweet, just me. Fast, easy, good recipe.

Delicious, a sugar bomb for sure, I used 3 cups frozen rhubarb and only 5 hamburger buns, I probably should have used just 4.  Will make this again!
