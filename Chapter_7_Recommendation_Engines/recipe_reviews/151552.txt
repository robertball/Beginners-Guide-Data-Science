Ok after making these 2 different times I'm ready to share my thoughts... The first time the cheese sauce was to much made it runny and way to sloppy for our liking. The taste was ok but felt the cheese over ruled the whole idea of a enchilada.... So here is what we did different that so made this a 5 star recipe and will be made often at our house again. First we boiled the chicken an shredded it, used corn tortillas(what we prefer over flour), and a can of enchilada sauce... What we did was mixed 1/2 the cheese soup (mixed the soup with only a 1/4 cup milk) with the shredded chicken rolled in corn tortillas, over the rolled tortillas we put the remaining cheese soup and drizzled the enchilada sauce over that...Finishing with a sprinkle of shredded cheese and sliced jalapenos. Also we had the salsa on the side with sour cream because not everyone in our house likes salsa. We finished off the pan from last night today for lunch as was just as good if not better then last night!

These turned out really good. I used Campbell's Fiesta nacho cheese soup since it's what I had and skipped the salsa. I chopped up a roasted frozen Hatch chile pepper for this as I didn't have canned. I also used corn tortillas because to me that is traditional for enchiladas. I wasn't paying close attention so I mixed the chiles and powder into the soup too rather than just the filling. It worked great that way and next time I will do it that way again. This was good but needed a lot more sauce and could have used double. I got 10 enchiladas from this. Thanks, I'll make this again, it was fast and easy. We topped it with a little sour cream and it was even better.

This turned out to be pretty tasty!  Putting it in the oven I wasn't feeling to sure but when it came out it was golden on top and it good good reviews from my family. My alterations:  Since I didn't have any leftover chicken to use I cut up 4 breases and cooked them in some mojo sauce.  I also forgot to buy the cheese soup so I made some cheese sauce from a recipe here on this site. I will make this again, possibly adding in some sauteed peppers and onions. Maybe some black beans.

I used a can of regular Cheese soup and a can of the Fiesta Cheese soup for the sauce. I also sprinkled grated cheddar on top.  I liked the filling much better than the sauce topping, it was too processed tasting.  I will keep looking for a better Chicken Enchilada recipe, this one missed the mark for us.  Not bad but not great either, just so-so.

Surprisingly good and easy to make.  I just used canned chicken and in addition to using the chili powder I used half a packet of taco bell taco seasoning.

I love this recipe.  My friend came over the other day, and I had leftovers, so I sent her home with some.  Next thing I know, my friend says she wants it for her birthday dinner.  I did make a few alterations.  I added shredded cheese in the mixture, and i put the green chiles in, but I also aded salsa in the mix too.  On top, I mixed salsa with the cheese sauce and poured it over the top, and topped it with more shredded cheese.  Thats the way i made it for my friend, and she asked me for the recipe so that she could make it for her husband.  Love this recipe!  It is now a favorite in my house.

I am just starting to cook. For me, this was a confidence builder! Easy to do and I got lots of compliments. I added lots of shredded cheddar cheese and less cheddar cheese coup.

Thought the cheese sauce was different. Would prefer something else but the rest was good.

My SIL gave this recipe to me eight years ago from one of her Campbell's cookbooks.  The original recipe called for 3/4 c. salsa, and no green chillies.  This is my husband's most asked for recipe (and the one he is most likely to help with!)  Our alterations are adding a little extra chili powder to the cheese sauce, to the chicken if you saute it, and to the base to taste.  Without the green chillies it is significantly milder.  It is great with Spanish rice and a salad.

I started with cooking the chicken in my crock pot with a packet of taco seasoning and a can of diced tomatoes.  12 hrs and it shreds very easily. I shredded 2 chicken breasts and had about 3 cps to work with. 

As others suggested I used the Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup and left out the green chilies.  I also got a can of enchilada sauce; half added to the soup and half on the bottom of the baking dish. I think the mix of cheese soup and enchilada sauce was perfect! Just the soup would be little to goopy and I've never been a fan of straight enchilada sauce. 

I added about a cp of the soup/enchilada sauce to the chicken and spooned the rest of it over the top of the enchiladas in the pan. I also added some shredded cheese to each enchilada. Oh, and I used corn tortillas instead of flour. 

With the changes I made we all loved this recipe and I will be using it a lot now.

I have made these several times now and shared the recipe with a few co-workers, and we all really enjoyed them. I like to shred the chicken instead of cubing it, add some peppers and onions to the filling, then top them off with more salsa, and sliced jalepenos, but over all, two enthusiastic thumbs up! :)

This recipe is great. Made a few changes though.  Instead of flour torts, I used corn dipped in enchilada sauce to male gluten free. I used nacho cheese soup to spice it up a bit. Then put shredded cheddar cheese on top before baking. So yummy!!

The only change I made was to put homemade hot sauce on top instead of the chunky salsa,it gave it a little spice and better flavor than the store bought salsa.But overall it was a great meal.

Very good! I made them with corn tortillas and left out the green peppers since hubby doesn't like those and he liked it! The kids loved it too. This one is a keeper.
