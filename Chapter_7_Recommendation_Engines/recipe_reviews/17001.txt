This is a great recipe!! I didn't have any mustard seed, so I used 1tsp of ground mustard instead. Because we love garlic, I used 4 cloves to kick up a notch, and it tasted great. Even the kids asked the seconds!!! Thanks!!!!

We stuck to the recipe ingredients, marinated it overnight, and cooked it in the crockpot with the marinade the next day for 8-9 hours on low.  It was delicious. It would also be good cooked with veggies and/or make the au jus into gravy. We boiled the leftovers in the au jus and they were even better.  I would like to try this on the grill as the original recipe states.  Thank you for this recipe.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!  Thanks so much... I guess what made it such a big hit with my husband, is that it was his first try at his new BBQ!  Next time I might cut slits in the meat and slide slivers of Garlic into it before marinating.  It also ended up marinating overnight... but didn't seem to be a problem.  Great recipe!  Thanks.

This was sooooo tasty and super easy to make. I didn't make a single change to the ingredients but I did put my roast (with all of the marinade) in a roasting pan with some potatoes and carrots and cooked the roast and vegetables in my oven at 350F for 75 minutes. Quicker and the pork steaks were the perfect texture. Cooking roasts in my crockpot tend to turn the roast into shredded pork. I heard my neighbors in the hall comment about how "something smells soooooo good!" The whole family loved how flavorful the pork was and I will definitely be making this again.

was a good marinade, I broiled the pork rroast at 325 for about an hour.  Came out tender and juicy.  I marinated overnight and scored the meat and added minced garlic inside.  will make again, but might cut down a bit on the worchestire sauce.

I used this recipe and it was to die for! I did however had to improvise on some of the ingredients. I had a 4# pork roast. I doubled the marinade,using a full cup of worcestershire, I used 2 tablespoons of Karo syrup instead of honey and used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar for the other part of the sweetness also to help brown the meat better. I used 4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons regular mustard.I used fresh garlic diced.Tripled the cloves. I didn't have lemon pepper so I used 2 teaspoons lemon juice and half teaspoon pepper. I added 2 tablespoons of rosemary leaves. I preapered the meat by washing and patting dry, scored the part with the fat and forked the rest of the meat all the way around. Marinated over night. Turning after 2 hours. I am a night owl. I put all of the marinade and meat in a roasting pan coupled with some vegetable stock about a cup added red potatoes with the skins still on onion, and carrots. roast uncovered at 325 for 70-80 minutes. Used the juices to make gravy, melt butter in pan add flour, (equal parts,) make a rue and let cook for about 1-2 minutes stirring constant. Add enough stock to make a nice thickness, stirring continuely so it doesn't stick. Med heat. Let cook about 5-7 minutes.. oh so grand!

This was SO VERY good.  The things that I did differently are, that I only had a small two pound roast but used the same amounts for the marinade.  That I used a squirt of prepared mustard for the ground mustard that I didn't have and that I put it on my Showtime rotisserie for about a hour and fifteen.

This was good, except I'd probably cut down a shade on the worcestershire.  I also didn't have cider vinegar and used regular white vinegar.   Not sure if that may have affected the recipe much.   Will probably make again.  We all enjoyed.

It was rainy the day I made this, so I roasted 2-1.5 lb pork tenderloins, which had been marinating for over 8 hours, at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes and they turned out tender, juicy and flavorful.  I can't wait to try this on the grill.

I'm not the biggest fan of pork roast but I ended up with one in the freezer. This was very enjoyable and actually makes me want to buy another roast so we can have this again. Very good flavor and was super simple to make.

This is a great dish! When serving, we added the option of bbq sauce for each individual. Instead of grilling, I slow-cooked it in my crockpot for 6 hours and the meat literally fell from the bone! Delish!

We enjoyed this pork roast.  It's so easy, I'll totally do it again.  Halved the Lea and Perrins, upped the mustard powder to 1t., omitted the mustard seed, and used a ton more garlic.  Put it all in the crockpot on low for 8 hours, and it was delicious.  We're going to make BBQ sandwhiches from the leftovers!

This was OK... I would recommend trying if you want to do something different, but not if this is your first time making a pork roast.

Very yummy, I had to bake it because we were out of charcoal, but if I hadn't overcooked it, it would have been perfect. As it was, it was still delicious. I used the leftover marinade as a stirfry for leftover cooked rice and lots of frozen and fresh veggies.

EXCELLENT!! Perfect marinade - I made accroding to original posted recipe- Just doubled it-  as I had a 2.5 lb pork roast.  I pierced the meat and marinated 5 hours. I grilled using my rotisserie feature on my outside grill for 2 hours. Basting with the marinade every 15-20 min or so.
Thank you!

We just were not crazy about the flavor of this meat.  It was very tender and juicy though.  For that reason I may try it again.

We use this the other day on a pork roast. The roast was moist and very tender and had a great taste. I will use this again.  Thanks for sharing.                                            Judyb

OK- made meat tender, didn't taste any ingredients other than worcestershire sauce, which I like but then why bother adding all the other things if I don't get to taste any of them? Marinated for 9 hours.

Pretty good. It just seemed to need a longer marinating time. I did omit the celery salt, because we don't like it. I also didn't have mustard seed, so I just doubled the mustard powder. Hubby liked it, but we both agree it needs to marinate longer.

The meat was fork-tender and pretty tasty, but my family was put off by the very strong vinegar smell while cooking.  I'm reluctant to use it again because I don't know if cutting the vinegar back will change the results.

Great flavor! We used this on a pork roast. I poked holes in the roast and marinated it overnight. I didn't have honey but it still tasted lovely. Then I threw it and the marinade in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours with halved potatoes and carrots. It ends up turning out more like pulled pork in the slow cooker but that's no biggie to me. It was even better the next day!! We will make it again for sure.

The Worcestershire sauce in this is unbelievable! My daughter could tell there was mustard in it, which shows what a fine palate she has! We sliced it VERY thin after doing a rotisserie on the grill for 1 hour 45 mins. Incredible!

This was a very good dish. We were planning on making another, but ended up unable to do so. This was a nice substitute. We did not have time to let it marinate for more than a couple of hours, which probably didn't give us the full flavor that could have been possible.

Marinated for seven hours and still wasn't happy with the lack of flavor after grilling.  I like a more bold flavor that penetrates all the meat rather than just the outside.  I might try to cook it in the crock pot next time hoping that would bring more flavor.  I did like the flavor, just wanted it to be stronger.

Made the recipe as is and marinated 8 hours.  The flavour was subtle and divine.  Next time I will marinate overnight for more intense flavour, but that is just me.

VERY moist, like a previous reviewer I would cut the Worcestershire sauce in half because it is a tad bit salty with the whole amount. We will definitely make this again and build on it.

As previous posts noted, it needs more marinating time unless you want just a mild flavoring then 2 hours is fine.  The smell of the vinegar can be strong but is not too strong in taste.

This was just ok for us.  The meat was very moist and tender however there was just something missing in the flavor.

This is a great recipe!  I was a little concerned with the strong aroma of the worstershire sauce (I'm not a big fan of it) but the outcome is great!  Will be sure to make this one again!

This was pretty good just too much worcestershire and not enough garlic taste for us, will try again with 1/4 cup worcestershire and replace vinegar with lite soy sauce.  Hubby smoked this and was very tender.

Mixed in a bowl and poured into a gallon ziploc baggie with a pork loin roast. Refrigerated overnight.  It turned out awesome.  The smell from the ACV as strong but it wasn't that way when roasting.  This recipe is a keeper!

We marinated this overnight, and the flavors weren't  very noticeable in the meat.  It was pretty much a "honey mustard" roast.  Not my favorite, but it was ok.

I would probably use again just not on a pork roast maybe a pork tenderloin. I'm not a big fan of pork roasts. Otherwise good flavor.

Double the marinade, and I grilled a pork butt instead of a loin. It just fell apart on the serving platter.  My new favorite thing to grill!

One of the best marinades I have ever used on a pork roast. Everyone loved it and I couldn't stop taste testing while I sliced it! The next day I used the leftovers in cuban sandwiches and that was terrific also. Next time I will buy a bigger roast. Can't say enough about how good it was.

For a guy who likes to BBQ but works graveyards this marinade is super easy and quick. It made a difference turning a simple, so-so piece of pork, into a 3 hours taste of grilling yum! Simple ingredient, easy prep and quick turn around to the grill, then plate.

this was absolutely delicious.. i used this to marinate three decent sized bone in pork chops.. i think i could have added one more pork chop and wish i would have b/c it was that good.. instead of 1/2 cup of worcestershire i used 2 T worcestershire and 3 T low sodium soy sauce.. i left out the honey.. added an extra T of cider vinegar.. i only had black mustard seeds so i used 1/4 tsp of it (as i've heard they're stronger tasting than the regular kind).. celery seed for the celery salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder for the fresh.. also added 1/2 tsp of red chili flakes.. i can't wait to make this again.. ty for the recipe

No leftovers!  I followed the recipe with slight modifications.  I didn't have mustard seed so I doubled the dry mustard and used apple cider vinegar.  I inserted 4 cloves of slivered garlic into the meat and marinated for 5 hours.  Next I cooked in the slow cooker on low for 5-6 hours then boiled down the liquid and served over the meat and mashed potatoes.  Definitely a keeper, thanks for sharing.

I made this pork roast tonight!  Delicious!  Roasted it in an electric oven at 325 dgrees for 80 minutes----just a little too long...think 70 minutes would have been perfect.  It was still wonderful, great flavor!  A keeper!

The  flavor was pretty good but the pork was dry.  I'll try brining it first next time.  Definitely worth tinkering with.  I made sure to stab the meat several times to help get the flavor in the middle.

I had a 1.5 pound pork tenderloin and doubled the marinade that was called for and added about 7 peeled and chopped potatoes and a bag of baby carrots.  I also sliced and poked the pork tenderloin so the marinade could seep through, and per another reviewer, I added minced garlic and lemon pepper to the slits in the pork and marinated for just over 1.5 hours.  I cooked in the oven for at 300' for a 1/2 an hour and kicked up the temp to 350' for the other 1/2 and hour.  Well, this was my attempt to slow roast the roast.  The roast was just about finished about 15 minutes before the timer was set to go off, but the potatoes and carrots weren't done, what to do???  It was already 6 in the evening so I added a can of green beans to it placed some tin foil on the cast iron and threw it back in the oven at 425' for another 45 minutes, this turned out perfect, completely tender, full of flavor, both of my kids gobbled it up, and the hubs said I could make this anytime!  Next time I will probably just put it in my slow cooker, and save myself sometime.  Give this recipe a whirl, you won't regret it!  Succulent, savory and superb!  My chef hat off to you, Denise Hummel, for an keeper of a recipe!!!!!!
