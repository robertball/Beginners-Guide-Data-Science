This is basically the marvelous chicken divan recipe I make regularly and is so coveted by my family. However, I add 1 c of sour cream to the soup/mayo/lemon juice/curry layer, and this is such a must! I can't imagine it without the sour cream.
I always add about 3 t of curry, since it is just so yummy and seems the perfect amount. 

Also, I never add the mushrooms, as I've never heard of chicken divan w/ mushrooms.

I also top this with a layer of buttered breadcrumbs and then lightly cover w/ a layer of Parmesan cheese. I think you will find the breadcrumb topping makes it so much better.

This is a family favorite by almost everyone who makes it!

This recipe is delicious!  I've made it several times with a slight variation:  1) I cut 4 chicken breasts into cubes and boil (while steaming the broccoli)until done 2) I spread the broccoli, cooked chicken water-chestnuts, and fresh, sliced mushroom in the casserole dish  3) I blend 1/2 cup Light Miracle Whip, 2 cans of Campbell's Reduced Fat Cream of Chicken Soup, juice of 1 lemon, 1/2 cup (or so) of white wine, 1/4 cup of chicken broth, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, and 1 tsp of curry powder  4) I pour the mixture over the meat/veggies  5) Stir the mixture together lightly  6) Cover the mixture with breadcrumbs and melted butter  7) Bake @ 350 until bubbly (30 - 40 mins).  Fabulous!

Ok, this is the Chicken Divan "Mamaw" used to make. Certainly not an every-day dish, but for me, perfect nostalgia/comfort-food. I use cream-of-mushroom instead of cream of chicken, which I think added a nice touch. I told myself I was making it a bit healthier by using fresh mushrooms, Campbell's Healthy Request soup(low fat & sodium), and Duke's Light mayo and it comes out beautifully. I don't think there's any other substitutions that can be made, though. I tried using low-fat cheese once, and it just made a yellow plastic shell that I literally peeled off the top of the casserole. I also add crushed Ritz crackers on top of it all to make a crunchy topping and I think it was an outstanding addition. (Well, that could just be my nostalgia popping up again; Mamaw thought everything was better with a crunchy topping.)

Anyway, and as to the too "saucy" that a couple people had problems with; you're not adding water to the soup, are you? Just add the condensed soup as a base, you don't add the water. Those fresh mushrooms I've been using should be adding a lot more moisture than canned mushrooms, but it's never been soupy for me.

I'm having friends for lunch on Sunday and couldn't find my old chicken divan recipe so I searched on All Recipes and, lo and behold, here it is.  My original recipe did not call for mushrooms, but does have one cup of cashews -- it's a wonderful additional "crunch" to the water chestnuts.  Also, I cut roasted chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces (shredded doesn't sound very appetizing to me!).  It's a lovely, easy dish served with rice and a salad.  It's always been a hit with my guests over the past 20 years!

*UN*believably tasty.  I made minimal alterations: I used one can cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken, and only about 3/4 cup light mayo -- think I'll cut that down to 1/2 next time since it had no shortage of creaminess.  I also used about 2/3 of an 8-oz package of fresh mushrooms -- didn't bother sauteing before hand, and they were great.  The water chestnuts really make it -- very nice crunch.  My only really issue was that it seemed like not quite enough broccoli/chicken for a 3-quart dish...  I ended up using a 2-quart dish and had sauce left over (although the dish had no lack of sauce).

4 stars because I really cut back on the creamyness of this dish. No soup used.I only used 2tbs mayo, no butter and used 1/4 cup skim milk & 1/2 cup light sour cream. I also left out the water chesnuts because I don't care for them. So I used 1 cup of rice. Overall I really enjoyed this dish and I liked the mushrooms which changed it up from normal chicken divan. I topped my casserole with french fried onions.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made it about 10 times already and everytime I make it for friends, they leave with the recipe in hand. I made this recipe for a cub scout gathering and had 5 people ask me for the recipe.
Easy, and not time consuming

Started making this before I realized - no soup!  So made microwave white sauce, added cheese, curry & lemon juice, left out mayo.  Cooked rice & stirred it in too (was making a quick trip to cottage & wanted one dish to carry for supper).  Result...Yummy!

I should have known better that 2 cans of condensed soup would make a rather gloopy meal.  Family hated it even though I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it was OK, which is good as I have lots of leftovers to get through on my own.  My son particularly disliked the lemon/sour flavor.

10 STARS!!!  I omitted the mushrooms and water chestnuts (didn't have them) and used cream of broccoli soup.  Delicious and easy -- definitely a keeper!

Not seeing my first review of this dish so re-doing it.  Sorry if it duplicates.  I didn't have water chestnuts on hand but would have used them if I had any.  Didn't have the soup either, so I made 1 cup of white sauce adding chicken soup base, salt, pepper, curry powder and cheese to it.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients for the sauce.  I added a bit more chicken to it then the recipe shows.  I also added the cheese on top, besides what I put in the sauce.  YUM!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made it so many times - I can do it by memory.  I have even added more curry powder and lemon juice.  They compliment each other well..  YUM.

My family loves this flavorful recipe!  It has become a regular in our fall/winter rotation.  We are a family of 5, so I use a large rotisserie chicken and the family size cream of chicken soup.  Like many of the others here, I also add extra curry and lemon juice because that's what give it such a tasty and unique flavor.  I have tried using the canned mushrooms, but prefer fresh and I just throw them in.  No need to sautee them first, as they cook up fine in the oven.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I changed it slightly, but it makes all the difference. After I put EXTRA sharp cheddar on the top, I then top with buttered bread crumbs and bake.  The crispy buttery topping really makes it!!

I think that this recipe is tasty. However, a bit on the saucy side as is. So, I doubled the chicken and the broccoli. Likewise you could halve everything but the chicken and broccoli.  Also, I found that the broccoli was a bit over down for my taste.  So, I steamed fresh broccoli separately and baked the other ingredients together. Then I arranged the broccoli on a serving platter and spooned the chicken mixture over top. Yummy.

Well, I definitely tweaked this recipe, but it was SO good!! I sauteed fresh broccoli in about 3 tbsp butter with a pinch of salt and fresh ground pepper, used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken, nixed the water chestnuts and lemon juice, used about half a cup of light mayo, fresh mushrooms and about 3/4 cups sharp cheddar cheese, and leftover chicken (white and dark meat). Threw in some rotisserie chicken spice, garlic powder, dried chopped onions, and some more pepper. Mixed everything together and then spread into the baking dish and topped with a thin layer of more cheese and french fried onions. Served over buttered egg noodles. OMG. One of the best things I have ever tasted. I will definitely be making this one again!!

This is a great and easy recipe.  I always buy the roasted chickens at the grocery store, but I can never eat all of the chicken and was looking for other casserole type recipes to use the chicken for.  This is a good one.  I did try the recipe with some white wine and parmesan cheese mixed with the soup.  Very good and very easy.

My husband raved about this and my 2.5 y/o picky-eater son actually ate all of his broccoli! Hallelujah!
My changes were to saute fresh mushrooms, omit the water chestnuts and butter and I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom soup. I also cut the mayo in half. It was still YUMMERIFIC!

I think this recipe is great as is.  Flavors remind me exactly of how Mom used to make this.  I stir it all together instead of letting the sauce bake on top, seems to cook more evenly.  I also serve over brown rice.  Easy week night meal!

Was great! Used 1 can mushrooms ( all I had) but it was enough. 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup of sour cream. Put herbed stuffing on top to give it some crunch! Fantastic way to use up left over chicken!

This was very good! Didn't have cream of chicken soup so I just doubled the mushroom soup! Also added curry powder and topped with French's fried onions (as suggested by others). Gave it a nice taste!

Good stuff.  I misplaced a recipe similar to this which omitted the water chestnuts and the cheddar cheese.  I use about 3/4 cups of butter bread crumbs in place of the cheddar cheese which reduces the fat and still taste great.  Used a reduced fat soup also.  The curry powder and the lemon juice are the statrs in this recipe, don't omit these two ingredients.

This recipe was definitley a hit with us. This rich, simple to make, will for sure be made again. We had it with a lettuce-less salad and  a multigrain mini roll.  Leftovers were great too!

This wasn;t good at all. My husband thought it was ok. I was only able to eat it with saltines crumbled on it, my husband put italian crutonson his. I don't know HOW people thought it was too runny, mine was almost like paste. It tasted like I was eating condensed chicken soup out of the can. To be fair, I've never eaten chicken dian before, maybe it's just not for us.

This was another good recipe. I did make it with the water chesnuts; however, no-one like the change in texture they added. So next time I will leave them out.  
Thanks again or another great meal.

I love the crunch the water chestnuts gave.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of broccoli since that is what I had on hand.  Also, I didn't realize we were short on mayo so I was only able to use 3/4 cup.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

So good! I added 1cup of sour cream and buttery bread crumbs on top, with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. I made a second version with a can of green beans and fried onions on top. DIVINE! 350 oven 40 minutes and put the onions 5 minutes before taking the dish out. I used pre-boiled shredded chicken. A new favorite! Even the kids loved it (1 and 2 year olds).

One of the first family meals I learned to cook from my mom as a kid! We never put water Chestnuts or mushrooms in it. I'll have to give that a try. I never use measurements anymore, but I always use at least 2 tablespoons lemon juice and a couple tablespoons curry, and cream of chicken soup instead. I mix about a cup of cheese in with the soup and mayo, then sprinkle more cheese on top. Brown some cornflakes in butter for a crunchy topping. Recently I've started simplifying by buying a bag of precooked frozen cubed chicken and cooking frozen broccoli. It turns this dish into a quick put together, and I haven't noticed any compromise on taste! Perfect over rice!

1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken, lots of fresh, sliced mushrooms cooked in the microwave and then drained.  Little less mayo (Hellman's Light) and YUMMY!!!  And as an afterthought, another couple cups of broccoli would make it even better.

I loved this twist on a simple recipe I ate as a child. I did not add mushrooms, but I used cream of mushroom sooup. I did not add the water chestnuts because I don't like them, and I substituted sour cream for mayonnaise. I added extra curry powder and it was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend told me it would never be as good as his grandmother makes (and it's his favorits) and after he tasted it he addmitted how wrong he was! I will definitly make this again!

We enjoyed this variation of chicken divan.  The curry and lemon juice gave it a nice taste; next time I may just add a little bit more curry.  Also, just out of habit I put some buttered bread crumbs on top.

Delish!!!  Doubled up on everything (no water chestnuts) for a work fundraiser.  The curry really makes it.  I was suprised that there was no call for onions or garlic... so I cooked my chicken in diced onions and used a cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup instead of one of the cream of chicken cans.  With or without changes or mushrooms, this is comfort food!!

This recipe was really pretty good.  I substituted one of the cans of cream of chicken soup for a can of cream of mushroom soup.  We weren't a big fan of the mushrooms that were called for, so next time I think I'll omit them all together.  Also, I think I'll mix the cheese in with the soup/mayonaise mixture rather than putting it on top.  But all in all, pretty good

I've never made this for company or for a pot luck without being asked for the recipe. This takes the traditional divan recipe and adds curry and water chestnuts, making the dish extra special for company but still a quick family meal. Probably our favorite.

The mayo flavor was really strong, and I didn't even use the full amount, I substituted about half of what was called for with sour cream. That was the only thing I modified, but I put bread crumbs on top. All in all, if I tried this recipe again I would use all sour cream, no mayo, and I would use a cheese soup, like Campbells cheddar cheese soup, instead of the cream of chicken.

We enjoyed this, but were not over joyed.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms (didn't have canned) and used one can cream of brocolli and one can cream of mushroom as that is what I had on hand.  Not sure if the cream of chicken would have made that much of a difference?  After reading some of the other reviews, I did up the lemon juice to about 2 tsp.  Didn't add the butter since I had sauteed the mushrooms in a butter/olive oil mixture and figured the cheese would add enough "oil".  Per others suggestions I did crumble Ritz crackers on top and am glad I did as it added a bit of a crunch.  I didn't use the water chestnuts (even though I love them!) because our granddaughter was here and I didn't think she would eat them!  I used about 3/4 cup mayo and about 3/4 cup light sour cream and added a good dash of garlic powder.  I'm pretty sure this tasted very similar to the original recipe as I didn't make drastic changes.  Maybe I am just not a big fan of Chicken Divan?  After all, this was my first time making it as well as eating it!  Don't think I would make again, but only because I am not a big fan.  If you like CD, I'm confident this would be a good recipe!  Thanks...

I thought this recipe was pretty average. Not a meal I would serve to guests. It was runny, & didn't hold much of a shape, not very nice looking on the plate, and the taste was just ok for us. Maybe I was expecting a bit more.

This is the same recipe I've made for years without the mushrooms and water chestnuts, and it's always a big success (although I avoid it when I'm serving folks who avoid "rich" foods).  I'm looking forward to adding the mushrooms and waterchestnuts next time.  This week I used leftover pork tenderloin instead of chicken and it was more delicious than ever!

This recipe didn't turn out for me and I consider myself a good cook.  It was almost a soup - I cooked it an extra half an hour to try and reduce it.  The water chestnuts added a weird after taste.  I think this recipe would be better with one can of soup and not cream of chicken.  My husban refused to eat it.  However, it did taste much better the next day...husband still didn't dare touch it.
For those of you who were wondering...I did not add water with the soup!

It is runny and has an obnoxious appearance.  It needs bread crumbs added to absorb the juices.

I made this exactly as directed and both my husband and I thought it was awesome. It was extremely easy and consists of ingredients I ALWAYS have on hand. The only things I will change the next time I make it is the addition of cauliflower and rice, but that it strictly personal taste, I certainly wouldn't cry if I did not have those on hand next time...

I thought this would be a pleasant change from the conventional Chicken Divan I've made in the past, so I made it for a family birthday dinner.  When no one offered complements, I knew it was not well received. Once I tasted it, I understood their disappointment.  I followed the recipe as shown without adding water chestnuts.  Sorry, but I will not make this one again.

My extended family has made this recipe for 20 years...with a few changes. We don't use mushroom or the butter and in the last 15 minutes of baking we add a layer of cheddar cheese or garlic croutons and top them with 8 oz of shredded cheddar cheese. The croutons make this dish, IMHO. DELICIOUS!!!

Great comfort food!  Cut this recipe in half since I was only making dinner for hubby and I (with some leftovers!).  I used fresh mushrooms and broc and did not have water chestnuts, so will have to try again as I think they would add great texture!  I only used 1/4 cup light miracle whip, added some white wine, juice from one quarter of a lemon, 1/2 tsp curry powder, a handful of fresh parm and one can of reduced fat cream of chicken soup.  I decided to add some panko crumbs on the top too with some reduced fat cheddar.  Served over brown rice and this made a yummy meal!

This recipe was very good.  I did not add water chestuts because my children do not like them.  I think about 1/4 cup of canned milk or half and half would make the sauce seep into  the chicken and broccoli better so that the sauce does not just sit on top. I will make this again!

I thought this was excellent..my honey thought it was pretty tastey too..my chidren are another story though..kids!  I altered the recipe for our tastes...I follwed someones suggestion and boiled and cut up the chicken..nice and easy that way..didnt use water chestnuts(will try them next time I wanted to keep it more basic the first time) didnt use mushrooms..noone likes them except me..I personally dont like curry..so I used season salt..I used one can of cr of potato and one can of cr of borcolli soup instead of cr of chicken..when I layed the chicken out I sprinkled pepper and some parmesan cheese on it, then covered it with the sauce..I truly enjoed this..I am very glad I have leftovers

I've been making this recipe for 3 years now and it's ALWAYS a hit!  It was even requested as an addition to Christmas dinner one year!  I have, in a pinch, substituted the grated cheese with Kraft processed cheese slices and it has come out just as delicious!  I add extra lemon juice and curry powder for extra tang and I also add torn up pieces of white bread on top for a crunchy addition.  What a winner!!!

Not sure what the other woman was talking about in her review when she mentioned this came out 'saucy'.  When I made it, it came out a perfect consistency and everyone in my family devoured it in no time!  My Mom asked me for the recipe too.  This one is a keeper in our house for sure.

Hey Beth! I love your new spin on an "old hat" recipe. The curry and lemon bring this old basic to life. I made two batches, froze one and took the other to church potluck yesterday. You're right...we all loved it, but the men scarfed it down like they had eaten in months. I guess its like an unspoken compliment to this dish hehehe! Thanks for sharing.

We loved this, changed the name to Chicken DEVINE!!!!!! I did have to do a little varying----thought I had a bag of frozen broccoli,  but it was a mix of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots! I carried on using them as I would have the plain broccoli and it was fine!!!! Also did  use a few tips and mixed half mayo and half sour cream. Loved the mushrooms and water chestnuts, and the use of French Fried Onions on top for crunch was the perfect finish. We will be eating this often. I didn't make rice, just had some pineapple on the side.

I cook a lot and take pride is serving great meals and plan to attend culinary school when I retire. I love seeing the recipes the wonderful home cooks post here and trying them out. This one was a big disappointment. My husband liked it, but he's never had it before and had nothing to compare it to. My 8 year old tasted it and stopped there and didn't eat it.  I followed the recipe. It was "okay" at best. Too bland, not enough flavor. I've had much better at corporate potlucks and had hope to recreate something special, yet simple for dinner. I threw it out.

I compared this to my grandmothers recipe and it's quite similar...but really needs tweaking!  Way too much juice for the ingredients.  Will cut back and try 1 1/2 cans of soup and only 1/2cup mayo/sour cream.  The lemon juice in my grandmothers recipe calls for 3tsp, and the curry for 2tsp.  That is what I did use instead of what this recipe calls for.  As for the cheese topping, not in the original recipe; it calls for dry stuffing mix.  I didn't use it this time but will definitely use it next time.  I also will leave out mushrooms (didn't use chestnuts) as old recipe didn't call for them.  Have to admit, it did bring me back to the taste of my grandmothers and moms cooking!

Yum, no soup? 4Tbsp butter,4 Tbsp flour roux, add 4 chix boullion boiling water to make 16 oz, then 4 oz. cream.  Fresh mushroom cooked in the butter good too.
A bit rich if you are living lean.

This is how my mom has always made it (there are varied recipes all over the place,) so when I made this last night it was like being taken back to my childhood. I used to actually ask for this for my birthday dinner when I was little!!! 

I made it last night with leftover turkey from a turkey we made this past week at a community Thanksgiving. It tasted exactly like chicken--if I hadn't known it was turkey I would have just thought it was chicken like normal. So this is a great idea for Thanksgiving turkey leftovers!

This recipe has amazing flavors to it. All of us were at the table trying to figure out how in the world all of the flavors meshed together so well. Not that this is a bad dish, but I think that it'd have been better to add something...more solid (?) to the dish. Like rice or pasta. Good dish to experiment with and make perfect to your standards.

I love this recipe but for a couple of changes. First of all I halved the recipe. I used steamable broccoli and instead of shredding the cooked chicken I quartered 2 chicken breasts. I used 1/2 cup of mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 can cream of chicken soup(do not add water)1 tsp lemon juice and curry powder to taste about 1T. We love the curry flavor. Mixed these together and layered the broccoli on the bottom of a sprayed 8" baking dish, then added the quartered cooked chicken breasts and poured the cream mixture on top and finally added shredded cheddar cheese to the top. Baked 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. This is so good. I can't imagine this recipe without sour cream in the mixture.

A wonderful recipe! Kind of a blast from the past! I made a half version and took into consideration some of the comments of others and they were good calls. Used 1 1/2 tsp curry powder and cut back on the mayo to just over 1/4 cup. Did not use the mushrooms or water chestnuts. Topped with some grated parmesan cheese (was afraid my reduced fat cheddar would melt into a glob) and then some buttered Ritz crackers. Baked about 35 min, and it was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe, Beth!  UPDATE 10/1/15:  I changed it a bit this time, and it was even better! I only added about a tsp of curry powder, a little garlic powder to cracker crumbs and sauce, added a  tsp of dry sherry, used a can if cream of chicken and mushroom soup, and also added about 1/2 cup of sauteed chopped mushrooms. Fabulous!

Yum!!!!  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 light sour cream, one can of soup, and doubled the broccoli & chicken..I also thinned the soup mixture with some white wine and chicken broth, so I could pour it over the top.  Next time I will NOT cook the broccoli and mushrooms ahead of time, as they were kinda slimy...definitely include the curry!!!  Such good flavor!

Same recipe my mom made growing up! I love it served with rice.  I do not use mushrooms or waterchestnuts.  But it's fabulous. Growing up we always poached chicken for this recipe.I really enjoyed the shredded chicken.  I grabbed a rotisserie, shredded the bird and it was ready to go. I will say this is a LOT of sauce.  It really does go nice over white rice.  Enjoy.

This was really good.  I used uncooked broccoli, chopped and worked great... still got pretty mushy without being precooked.  Served over rice.

this was tasty. But were I to make this again, I would change it up some. First off, i found this was so rich I needed antacids afterwards, so i would substitute sour cream or yogurt for part of the mayo. Also, I would double the amount of broccoli.

This is amazingly good! This is very similar to a recipe my mom handed down to me.  I love mushrooms but my kids don't so I only put them on half of the dish. My whole family just loved this and wanted to know when I will make it again :) If you are lucky enough to have any left over it tastes even better the next day!

Yummy!!! Husband had seconds and kept telling me how good it was.     I did not have mushrooms or water chestnuts but did add steamed chopped celery.  I used 12 ounces of cream of chicken and added about a cup of milk and 1/2 cup of Mayonnaise.   I doubled the curry powder.

Made 1/2 recipe but as written served with rice. ..."Men love this" you were so right. My hubby is not fond of chicken and he rated this a 4! Thought he would like it as I use curry in my chicken salad and he loves it. This is a keeper. Thank you!

I had tried a different recipe before and my hubby told me never to make CD again. This recipe had some new twists and guess what? The hubby and my little boys loved it! I reduced the recipe to 4 servings and everything had a good consistency and was wonderful with rice. It is definitely a keeper recipe for leftover roast chicken!

Love it! My father's new wife (married 1 yr) made this for me when we were visiting them. I substituted the Mayo with FAT FREE MIRACLE WHIP  and used low fat, low sodium chicken soup. It made at least 10 servings for us!!

I thought this recipe was great. I used about 3/4 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup of sour cream. I also used cayenne pepper (1 tsp) instead of the curry, because I didn't have any curry. Everyone loved how it turned out. This one is a keeper!

I only made one change to this recipe - I did 1/2 c mayonnaise and 1/2 c sour cream because I am not a big fan of the mayonnaise taste.  I served this over rice.  I would have given this 3 stars because it was just OK to me, but my husband ate leftovers without the rice and he said it was much better.

Wonderful dish.  The whole family loved it.  I used fresh brocolli and fresh sauteed mushrooms to make it extra delicious.  Thanks for sharing this great casserole!

Made some modifications to what I had on hand.  Used fresh mushrooms, some cauliflower (along with broccoli) and one can cream of chicken and one can of cream of broccoli with nonfat mayonnaise.  Omitted the water chestnuts, butter and cheese (wanting to lower the calories).  Used 1 1/2 t curry.  I made up the sauce and kept tasting it until the level of curry was right for us.  Maybe my curry wasn't as strong, I don't know.  I didn't have any trouble with the sauce being too soupy.  Served over rice.  Nice meal.

Great recipe!. The curry really adds a new twist.  Not, too saucy at all.  I like a casserole with more sauce.  Otherwise, it can be dry.  Especially, leftovers.

Found this recipe too 'saucy' and the brocolli overpowering.  I followed it to a 'T' including Water Chestnuts which my husband & I enjoy.  There was plenty leftover ... Certainly not a keeper.

Loved this dish. Tasted just like Moms.
Only difference I made  was mixing 1/2 cup Panko bread crumbs with a tablespoon of butter and mixing it in the cheddar cheese for a crispy golden crust.

I used short cuts.  I defrosted frozen chicken tenders, diced them, did not cook them first.  I put a layer of minute rice on the bottom of the casserole dish, added same amount of chicken broth, then layered with chopped frozen broccoli .  In a bowl, I tossed cream of chicken soup with mayo, lemon and defrosted chicken.  Put it on top, then added shredded cheese.  Need to stock up on curry, I bet that makes a wonderful taste.

My husband REALLY liked this!  I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand, so started by halving the recipe, except for the amount of chicken, and veggies.  I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo to add to the soup mixture. The only creamy soup I had was Progresso's creamy chicken with wild rice, which added an especially good flavor, I thought.  I also added just a touch of vanilla coffee creamer to the soup, which has become my new "secret" ingredient.  Like someone else,  I topped with buttered bread crumbs along with the cheese.  It is a great recipe for using up leftover roast  chicken, and the curry flavor was wonderful.

Delicious but I made a few alterations after reading the reviews. I used Rotisserie chicken, only 1 1/2 cans of chicken soup instead of 2 cans, substituted 1/2 cup of sour cream + 1/2 cup of mayo instead of the 1 cup mayo. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and 1 tsp of curry instead of 1/4 tsp (I might use more a little more curry next time). I also squeezed 1/2 of a juicy lemon. For everything else, I used the amount given. I topped it with french onion rings and served it over egg noodles.

I like it, but it has too much salt from the undiluted soup.  Next time I make it I will take some of the recommendations here and replace that second can of soup with sour cream, plain yogurt, and/or white wine.

It’s a great concept but too much heavy sauce. I’ll try again with more broccoli and maybe half as much soup diluted with some milk. The flavors are very good together and love the ease of 1 dish casserole. Just needs to lighten up.

If I’m making this recipe and going to simply “assemble” it and freeze it for later, how long would it need to be in the oven? Should it be thawed first and baked as in the original recipe? Or put in the oven frozen and baked longer??

This was not good.  The proportion of goop to chicken/broccoli was way off.  I even used extra of both chicken and broccoli but what I made definitely had more of the thick mayonnaise sauce.   I don't think I'll make this again, but if i come across anything similar in the future i will cute the mayo waaaay down.

We enjoyed the casserole. After reading some of the comments, I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream. I didn't find the sauce to be too thin at all. As a matter a fact, it was rather thick and had to be spread and not poured over the chicken. I used a rotisserie chicken from the store, so it had white and dark meat in it. I also cooked it in a 13x9 glass casserole dish. It came out very well and the family liked it.

This turned out wonderful! I only had 1can of cream of chicken soup, so my other can had to be cream of mushroom. I only had one jar of mushrooms too, but it still came out great and the meal was demolished by 3 people within 15 minutes. We loved it!!

I made this recipe exactly as directed.  I liked the flavor of the sauce with the curry, but I felt that the broccoli/chicken underneath was a little dry.   I've never had chicken divan before, so I don't know what it was supposed to taste like.  I think maybe it would be better if 1/2 the sauce were mixed in with the chicken and broccoli and the rest put on top.

Use less mayonnaise and 1 can cream of chicken soup. Too much sauce for ingredients.

I halved the recipe since I was making it just for 2 and had some left over for lunch the next day.  I made it on the spur of the moment therefore I did not have all the ingredients - namely the water chestnuts, mushrooms, and lemon juice.   Still turned out great.  The only other change was that I added some shredded cheese to the soup mixture before assembling the casserole,  in addition to the cheese on top called for in the recipe.    I would definitely make it again.

I adjusted the receipe for 3 servings and it was enough for 4. I would say I could have reduced the sauce a bit - it was very good but could do with a little less. I did add about 1/4 c sour cream to soup mix and buttered cracker crumbs on top of the cheese. Delish!!

I made this for my mom who is allergic to eggs so instead of mayo I used half sour cream and half yogurt. It did something odd and jelled up when I added the lemon. I had to thin it quite a bit using buttermilk bc I had it. The rest was like the recipe except I used fresh chopped mushrooms. It turned out really good. The water chestnuts were a nice crunchy touch. I topped it with French's Onions in the last few minutes and served it over rice. Noodles would be good too. It was great! I will make it  again.
Added on: I made it again with sour cream and no yogurt instead of mayo and I upped the curry a bit. Again it was awesome and easy. I served it with noodles and a green salad.

I have made this exactly as the recipe reads. It is very yummy and tastes a lot like a recipe I used to enjoy in a little local restaurant years ago. But I think the next time I make it I will increase the curry a bit and add the toasted bread crumbs, since I remember that restaurants having some kind of a crunchy topping.

I really enjoyed the recipe.  Pretty simple for a noted non-cook like me.  No changes to the recipe.
This will definitely be a regular for me.

When I make this dish I add a lot more curry. Basically double the curry. It's always a dish my entire family will eat and love.  Double the recipe for a luncheon. There will be none leftover.

My family could not get enough of this! I did bake this over a bed of rice (six cups) and used an eight-ounce block of grated cheddar cheese on top. Adding the rice gave us a large casserole plus an 8x8 extra pan that our grown daughter liberated after tasting our dinner. The only other thing I would add next time, because I added the rice layer, is third can of cream of chicken soup and a second can of water chestnuts.

Lose the shrooms and water chestnuts, and add marinated artichoke hearts, drained, 12-oz. Jar. Instead of cheddar as a topping, I use slivered almonds.

My husband is very picky, and he loved it as did I. The only thing I did differently was use mushroom soup (not condensed) as I didn't have the Chicken soup. It was a little soupy, so I just served it in bowls. Next time I think I'll incorporate a little cheese into the casserole instead of just having it on the top.

First, I don't understand why the intro to this recipe has to mention the sexes, people like chicken divan, not just men! Second, it is good but it does have a very processed flavor. I even used organic cream of chicken soup in an effort to minimize the processed flavor. I didn't have mayo so I used half milk, half whole-fat plain greek yogurt- so I omitted the butter because of the high fat content in the yogurt. It could use more broccoli and chicken. I used 1tsp of curry and I thought that was enough. I added chopped red potatoes to some of it and wide egg noodles to the rest. Next time I will use 1 can of cream of chicken and a mixture of more milk and yogurt to  compensate for one less can of soup- and hopefully help cut down on the processed taste (without having to make anything from scratch). Loved the chestnuts in there!

I've never used water chestnuts before (didn't even know where to find them in the supermarket!), so I wasn't sure I'd like this recipe as is. But, I really did enjoy it. It was quite simple. I did cut the chestnuts in half, and I think I will use a little less soup and mayo for the sauce as it was creamier than I care for. But, I look forward to making it again. It got a thumbs up from coworkers who also got a taste.

I about doubled the chicken and more than doubled the broccoli and still only barely had enough filling for a 3qt dish (the sauce was on the verge of being too wet, even with the added chicken and broccoli). This dish was a really yummy hit. I'll be quadripling the broccoli next time, for sure.

I put green beans (fresh frozen) instead of broccoli because I didn't have it at the time.  Make sure you run hot water over beans and pat dry before putting in baking dish.  If you put them in frozen, it will make the dish runny.  Scrumptious substitution.

This was delightful! I essentially boiled the chicken on stove top in a deep pan, half full of chicken broth, then used my Magic Bullet to shred the chicken. I loved the texture this gave the dish! I used a bit less of everything as I was only cooking for two, and only one can cream of chicken. Two seemed a bit excessive. 

I steamed the broccoli, mushrooms and added onion on stove top for about 7 minutes, and combined it with the shredded chicken. 

I also added double the curry powder, coarse black pepper, and sour cream to the cream sauce. I'd like to add white wine next time! 

The Boyfriend went back for three servings, so it must have been good. I paired with some twice baked potatoes. It was some much needed comfort food on a rough Monday. Enjoy!

On the positive, the dish was very pretty and easy to prepare. It was very bland, though. After I baked it and after tasting it, I added breadcrumbs, salt and pepper. It was runnier than in the picture.
I would definitely make this dish again, adding seasoning and breadcrumbs to the sauce before baking, and subbing sour cream, or something for the mayo (I didn't care for the taste in the sauce).

I was surprised at how much I liked this.  The ingrediants just seem like a strange combo.  I cut back on the sauce to about 1/3 of a cup of light mayo and one can of soup.  Was plenty.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for a dinner I was hosting and everyone loved it. I left out the curry powder (I didn't have any), opted to add sour cream, grilled the chicken and sprinkled fresh breadcrumbs on top. This is going to be my go to dish for pot lucks. Great, easy recipe!

Taste was excellent. I cut down the mayo to 1/2 cup, used 3 chicken breasts (fried), 4 cups of fresh broccoli and 4 extra large mushrooms sliced, 1 can each cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups. This yielded enough to accommodate the sauce perfectly and a 3 qt casserole dish was just right. The texture however wasn't very nice. Don't precook the broccoli, it definitely goes slimy as stated in another review. Also, let the dish sit a few minutes after it comes out if the oven, it thickened and the sauce was nicer. I served it with pasta. Definitely use the curry as it makes the dish.

This is really tasty!  My family was thinking about the dish after it was gone, wishing there were more!  I added a 13 oz.box of cooked of whole wheat penne, omitted the cayenne, butter, water chestnuts and used shredded Parmesan cheese due to our personal preferences.  I also added a good 1/4 cup of GOOD sherry (do NOT use cooking sherry as it's full of salt) and used the rest of a rotisserie chicken that I had.  My family requested this dish within a week;  it's that good!

This was great. I omitted the water chestnuts because I didn't have them. I also crushed some almonds and sprinkled them on top. Family enjoyed this...I will def make again!!

Good comfort food.  I added more curry and lemon juice.  Next time I will add some sour cream to cut the saltiness of the condensed soup.  Husband liked it!

We loved this!  I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom, and I had the chicken sliced thin rather than shredded, and it turned out great.  Will make again for sure.

This recipe was very good, but just a bit too salty and oily for me.  I used a whole tablespoon of curry and omitted the water chestnuts.  Next time I will decrease the amount of cream of chicken soup and the mayo.
