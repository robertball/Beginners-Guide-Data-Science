Ok......Well. I have a pretty good idea why this had 1 star. Um....the person that submitted likes it I am sure. I respect that. However, this was not even remotely "cajun." It tasted more like chili than anything else. The consistency was way too thick and it tasted like chili with way too much cheddar in it. Some of you guys may like it but if you want something CAJUN, do not even think about it. This was a waste of crawfish in my opinion. I'm sorry. We didn't even eat it. We are going out for dinner. Again, I'm sorry. I just did not like it. Nor did anyone else in my family.

I don't know why this recipe had only 1 star.  It's a 5 star meal!!!  I added a little garlic and adjusted the seasonings to fit our northern palate and served it as a stew.  We'll definitely do this one again.  Thanks Aimee!
