This method of coating with seasoned flour resting and then another coating of seasoned flour worked very well.  I placed the wings on a cooling rack instead of a plate  so the breading would stick to the wings and not the plate.   My 10 inch cast iron skillet held 10 wings at a time.  If making a bunch of wings, heat the oven to 275 and hold the wings in the oven while you do the next batch.

I made this today! Great recipe however, I modified it a little. I did not have the time to place it in the fridge twice. So I only did that once. Then added seasoning after in a plastic bag and rolled it around. Once finished with all my wings I threw the wings i  the oven to warm them up! I also placed the wings I different sauces to meet everyones needs. here are the final touches.

Made this for Labor Day and everyone loved. I scaled this up for about 40 wings and I didn't sauce them so they stayed extra crispy. Served with hot sauce and blue cheese dressing in the side. This is the only fried wing recipe I will ever make for now on! Thanks!

Great Wings..I followed the recipe as stated then added additional seasonings to the flour...about 1/2 - 1 tbsp of black pepper..onion powder..garlic..kosher salt..cumin..all spice..basically anything that came to mind..lol.
I refrigerated for 90 minutes..then refloured and another 60 minutes in the fridge then a last dredge just before frying..then coated them in Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce...they were awesome!!!

I doubled the recipe and nearly halved the salt.

The chicken wings came out looking beautiful, and their texture was pretty good, although I do feel they could have been crunchier. This may have been my fault though since the oil - especially during the 2nd batch, dropped in temperature to around 320 or so instead of 375, which I think may have contributed to things.

I ate most of the chicken wings without any sauce since I can't have too much sodium, and I felt they had virtually no flavour. I may make again in the future, being sure to keep the oil hot, and perhaps adding more salt, but I think I prefer baking chicken wings as deep frying is always so messy.

I cooked them in Peanut Oil  for 21 minutes (I like my chicken wings nice and crispy).  Also - I added a touch of cayenne pepper to the rub (used Lawry's Seasoning Salt).

Tried these  with Chicken Thighs as well - worked wonderfully!!  Next I am going to try chicken legs.

I also used a wire rack to drain and that really worked well. I salted the wings generously and let them dry brine in the fridge overnight and the flavor and crispness after frying was world class! That light coat of well seasoned flour is genius! Only half of our wings made it to saucing as they tasted that good alone. This would work with smaller drumsticks and thighs if you want better than take out fried chicken!

This was a great recipe. I used Moore's Buffalo Sauce for my wings. I diluted it with 2 tablespoons melted butter to 1 cup of sauce.

This was soo easy, and made the best wings I have had, and I eat wings at least 3 or 4 times a month. I followed the recipe to a T, except for some of the seasonings in the flower. They came out nice and crispy, with lots of flavor. I tossed some in BBQ and some in buffalo. Not one left!!

These were awesome and very easy, we had 14 whole wings making 28 pieces in total and one cup of flour was plenty. I always add extra spice I added probably one tbsp of garlic powder to the mixture. We don't have a deep fryer only a Skillet and using one cup of oil and frying one side at a time worked great

These were some of the BEST wings I have ever had. The double dredging in the flour is a great idea.  I did not put them back in the fridge for the second time.  I just started frying them. I also added garlic salt to the flour mixture.  I used peanut oil for frying. I made two cups of the flour mixture instead of one because we had a large amount of wings we were making.

I love the double dry batter process! It gave the right amount of breading. And I used my own sauces after cooked- buffalo hot & sweet BBQ. I kept the cayenne pepper out becuz I thought the wing sauce was enough, but the salt is crucial! I probably added more than needed. I will definitely make these again!!

They taste amazing but feel free to dredge a third time just before frying for more crispiness. Will definitely be making this again.

These are wonderful.  I do not like spicy so I left out the peppers, cooked them for 9 minutes in my fryer.  Then I tossed my husbands in buffalo sauce and mine in sweet BBQ sauce and we were both happy.

Very good recipe..easy to make.  I did pop the wings in the oven after tossing in the sauce to crispen them up a bit.  That is just personal preference though.  The recipe is great either way!
