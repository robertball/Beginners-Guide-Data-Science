My husband thought this dish was a hit.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I omitted the green onions, because I did not have any at the time.  I diced up 3 chicken breasts and sauteed them with 1/2 a yellow onion and a few cloves of garlic.  I added about 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes to the mixture. I added more than 1 cup of the picante sauce mixture to the chicken and had plenty of it to roll up 12 tortillas. Along with the remaining sauce, I also drizzled El Paso Enchilada sauce all over the enchiladas as well. I baked in the oven for 30 minutes, topped with the remaining tomatoes and drizzled a Mexican 4-cheese blend all over the top.  I added some additional sharp Cheddar cheese over the top and baked for the remaining 10 minutes. This was a real score with my husband, only next time he asked that I use more chicken.

I have tried many enchilada recipes, and this is my LEAST favorite. The mixture of soup, sour cream, and salsa is overpowering and left me feeling quite sick after eating this.  Not to mention that the dish just doesn't LOOK appetizing on the plate. It's all one big orange messy heap.

If you decide to try this, one tip. Go ahead and put the salsa mixture inside the tortillas, but leave it OFF the top. The only thing I think could have improved this recipe is to stick with plain cheese, tomatoes, and onions on the top, maybe some lettuce and beans. But not the filling inside AND on top-- it was too much.

Super easy and versatile!!! One thing I add here that the recipe doesn't have is milk.  Once I dump the canned soup in a bowl, I fill the can up with milk and pour it in.  I find it too rich and salty if I don't use the milk.  Sometimes I use the Campbell's Cheddar Jack Condensed Soup to spice things up.  I also add diced green chiles or Rotel mild mix (for the kids).  I also add canned black or pinto beans and rinse them off before I mix it with the chicken.  I also marinade the chicken before I cook it with McCormick's Zesty Herb 30 minute marinade.

We actually really liked this, and I was surprised, to be quite honest.  My husband even, who is quite critical, thought it was good even (usually I get an "its all right" if prompted.  for this, he volunteered that it was good, without my asking!).  I followed the recipe pretty close, only putting lots of extra cheese on top.  I had gotten some chicken breast halves on sale, and wanted to use them.  So I simply boiled with salt until barely done.  Then pulled the meat off the bone, and shredded it.  

I expected the mixture to melt down more (to be more sauce like), which it didn't.  But that was okay.  I had filling left and topping left over, so I would suggest either using larger tortillas, or making a couple more than recipe states (I made seven in this size shell, and could have made probably two more, even though I used a lot of filling in each one).

Fantastically yummy, really satisfied the mexican food craving; Only used 1/2 cup of sour cream, which was more than enough. Baked chicken breasts for 20 minutes at 400 then used fork to shred the chicken for the recipe, used 6 inch old el paso tortillas (more pliable than the Mission ones), heated some of the extra picante sauce and served over top the finished dish to cut some of the creaminess of the dish, served with chopped lettuce, refried beans, and made the Mexican I rice dish from the recipes here. Ahh, full happy belly. Oh, used home-grated Heluva good Colby-Jack cheese. The pre-shredded cheeses just don't melt as well, get kinda plastic-y when cooked

YUMMM!  We love these!  I usually don't make any changes to the recipe, but sometimes I do add some black olives and some jalepenos.  It just depends on what I have on hand.  I make these at least once a month. ***Once I substituted ground beef for the chicken, and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cr of chicken, but it was not very good.*** Stick with chicken for the enchiladas.

Absolutely DELISH!!! I've made this a number of times already, and it's a hit every time. I added half a cup of rinsed and drained black beans to the chicken mixture, and I sprinkle shredded cheese and fresh cilantro on top before serving. The cilantro-black bean taste combo adds to the Mexican flavor. Yum!

The recipe is really good and so easy to make. A definite hubster pleaser. I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe almost exactly. The second time I cooked this, I made some adjustments. I replaced some of the chicken with mushrooms and added half a diced red bell pepper. I also didn't put any cheese inside the enchiladas. I only sprinkled some grated cheese on top before baking. With this I managed to cut out a great amount of fat from the recipe. The taste was still great and we didn't feel overly full from eating it.

I didn't have any cream of chicken on hand so I mixed sour cream and cream cheese instead. I also poured a can of enchilada sauce on top before going in the oven. Also I added jalepenos and sour cream just before serving. Delicious!

Very good and easy!! I used pepper jack cheese to pep it up a little bit - 1c. inside and 1c. over the top.  This is also excellent with prepared spanish rice added to the filling - a great way to stretch the recipe, or you can make them burrito size!  Make sure to double the amount of the picante sauce mixture so it doesn't get too dry.

I followed the recipe exactly and was happy with the result. Tasty! However I would agree with other reviews that only half the sour cream is needed. Also, next time I will probably add another half cup of chicken and some rice. Will make again for sure.

why do people always feel the need to change a recipe and then review/rate it. Its no longer the same recipe after you omit this or add that.. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was very good.

This has been a family favorite for quite some time.  We make it according to directions, but we add a can of Green Giant vacuum packed southwestern corn to the mixture for added favor.  I have also substituted taco seasoning for the chii powder with no compaints!

Incredibly fast, easy and delicious.  The only thing I didn't do was to make the extra topping to go on top of the enchiladas.  I mixed the soup, sour cream, picante, chili powder together and used that for the topping and the filling. I kept the chicken separate from the sauce and put about 2 tbsp of cubed chicken and 1/4 cup of filling inside each one. It was the perfect amount.  I also added a little cheese inside each enchilada.

Not a bad start = but I thought it was way too saucy.  Also, my roommate and I thought it tasted a little sweet...odd.  I will probably make it again and put some cooked rice in the bottom of the pan to soak up some of the sauce and give a little texture to the dish.  But I feel like it needs something...

I have made this recipe a lot and have received so many compliments! My husband prefers the chicken, but I love just using fat-free refried beans in mine. I think the texture is better. We don't stir the chicken in with the sauce so that way we can make half with chicken and half with bean. If you like tomatoes, I would suggest adding more. Fantastic!

Made this dish for dinner last night and we really enjoyed it.  Full of flavor and easy to make.  I used one half regular white onion, diced and cooked in place of the green onion.  I also used two Roma tomatoes instead of one.  I added a can of Southwestern style corn mixed in with the chicken and cooked covered 20 mins, uncovered 20 mins.  Will make this dish again.

Save your time and money.  This was bland and mushy.  It was edible, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.   The filling was pretty good but without much spice...I'd use it as a dip for tortilla chips or nachos.  But put some fire into it!

Okay, so these aren't authentic enchiladas but with Cream of Chicken soup in them, you wouldn't expect them to be. They do, however, have a nice Mexican flavor to them but they are mild enough for the whole family to enjoy -- I use about half the chili powder because I have young kids. They are also creamy enough to qualify as comfort food.   Overall, this is an easy, yummy recipe. You can even make up the filling and the topping in advance for a quick weeknight meal.

Everyone enjoyed this and the leftovers were great also.  I have made it several times, and making it as written is well received.  It is quick and easy to use some canned chicken and you have dinner in no time.  However if you have some time, it is worth it to brown up your own chunked chicken breasts.  I seasoned with cumin, chicken seasoning, garlic & pepper, and reg. pepper.  I also dashed some lime juice on top.  I sauted it with green peppers and onions.  I also used a full jar of salsa, about 2 cups.   It was a great base but also nice to do your own thing for your own taste using whatever time you have.

Good.  Having the same sauce on the inside and outside of the tortillas was possibly too much.  I would love to retry this recipe and maybe add something to the half of the sauce that is placed inside the tortillas or outside the tortillas.  I would possible add some bell peppers to the chicken micture and make this more of a baked fajita/enshilada casserole.  This is a prepare again dish, but I will have to change it up some.

Notes:  I tried this recipe again, but instead of using salsa I replaced it with one can of Rotel.  I also sauted one chopped onion with the chicken meat before I placed it in the tortillas.  Dinner was fabulous this time around.  I prepared the meal as directed.  BTW, my husband does not like sour cream supposedly but he at double serving of this dish!!! ;)

An all time favorite in my house with 2 teenage boys, 2 girls and husband.  We love it.  I make this at least once a month.  Its quick and easy with all the practices we have to go to.  I suggest to double recipe and make an extra pan for company!  Even the neighbor guy comes over for this one.  I do think the sauce could thin down a bit on top though, so I suggest to thin it down a little with some milk before pouring remaining mixture on top.  Enjoy!!

These were my first "homemade" enchiladas aside from the sauce packet kind, and they were great! I loved the creamyness and cheesyness...my husband loved them too! So simple for something this tasty! Still in search for ones that match our fav mexican restaurant, but there are certainly not bad!!

I likea   more traditional enchilada recipe but my husband and toddler loved  it. So very  kid (big and small) friendly. I used canned chicken too and didn't have  the picante sauce so  used medium salsa by pace  and  just left out the   chili   powder.  I did use  the healthy request chicken soup because I don't want my toddler eating MSG if I can  avoid it. Still turned out  tasty. My  mom made it  exactly as stated and it was good too. Well liked by all.

I think this recipe is 5 stars BUT only when it's made with CORN tortillas!!! The corn tortillas hold together better and taste SO so much better. Try with corn-I think it's 100x better.

Loved this.  Didn't have Pace so substituted Peach/Mango sauce.  Didn't have sour cream, used plain greek yogurt . Both worked great.

Very easy to make and very delicious! I also added 1 jalapeno and half tomato, chopped, into the chicken mixture. I added shredded cheese on top for the last 10 minutes of baking. It also reheats well in the oven. Very yummy, my boyfriend also loved it. I will definitely be making this again!

I am generally not a big fan of sour cream, nor do I like spicy food, so authentic mexican food is not a big hit with me. When my friend told introduced this recipe to me, I was very skeptical.  After tasting this, I absolutely loved it! It has tons of flavor and is not one bit spicy, since the cream neutralizes it. It is definitely NOT authentic mexican food, but that is why I liked it. My husband (who does like sour cream and spicy food) considers it one of his favorite meals ever.  (One word of advice: don't overdo the sour cream. You can feel a little sick in your stomach if it has too much sour cream. When I tried the recipe again with the EXACT amount, it went over much better with the family.)  If you are looking for a delicious flavor, but don't like spicy food or authentic mexican, this is the best compromise and all of your guests WILL be pleased. If you are looking for a great, authentic mexican enchilada recipe, this is not the recipe for you.  I loved it and it is a new family favorite, and the 5 different friends (and their families) who tried this recipe also loved it. That's why I give it 5 stars all the way. My friends all have very different tastes, and they all loved it, so you know it's good.

This is a very good recipe. We added cheese to the top, then I diced a couple of plain tomatos. The key is to use plain tomatos or pico de gallo on top... make sure you use plenty so that the meal is moist. Using the full salsa jar can be a little over powering for some...

I thought this recipe was simple and quite good.  I used home made salsa which had a little more kick.  My boyfriend I plan on making this one over and over again.  I used large tortillas instead of the small ones, then cooked in a 9X13 pyrex pan. Worked great!

My husband really liked these. He said that they were a major improvement to my old enchiladas which tasted nothing close to mexican. The only thing that I changed was that I left out the green onion.

I made this a couple weeks ago and it was delicious.  The only thing I didn't have on hand was the cheese the recipe called for or the green onions.  I used Kraft Shredded taco cheese, which worked fine.  Next time I make it I will make sure I have the green onions, I think that would make it even tastier.  My husband loved it and it tasted even better the next day for leftovers.

these are so good.  they are a big hit.  I changed it a little if I make them with chicken, I use cream of celery soup  I also make them with beef and use cream of mushroom soup.  when it is about done, I will put another layer of cheddar on top and put it back in the oven.

I've made this recipe for years, I've never topped it with the tomatoes and green onion, since no one in my family is a big tomato fan; if I buy green onions to use, they are always bad by the time I need to use the rest of them.

Everyone has their own tastes, my family loved this from day one.  While married to my 2nd husband, his daughter and son-in-law LOVED it and I would make it for them any time they visited.  

It is pretty creamy, rich though?  Not to us!  My younger daughter was craving it yesterday but didn't have everything to make it, so it's our dinner tonight.

It's pretty simple to make and pretty darn tasty!  You can also heat it up by using a hotter salsa or picante and/or more chili powder.

I have made this several times. I even bought the Campbell's recipe book! It taste like it comes from a good restraunt, like Applebee's. If you want something easy and different try it. My younger daughter and her friends like it. I also add cilantro to be a little more authentic. You don't have to add so much into each enchilada, then you can have more. Enjoy!

Always a hit. I know it says chopped chicken, but I would suggest boiling the chicken in seasonings, drain and then shred. Makes for easy handling when filling the tortillas and you can use the broth for a nice rice side dish.

I made some changes to my recipe. I omitted the picante sauce and the chili pepper. I added Rot-ell tomatoes to the soup and sour cream and some of the taco seasoning. and I added the rest of the pack of taco seasoning to the chicken and onion. It was a hit!!!!!!!

I first made this recipe for a Super Bowl party in 2007.  Everyone loved it!  Admittedly, calling these "enchiladas" is a stretch - they use flour tortillas after all - but it is simple to make and very tasty.  A true crowd pleaser!  TIP:  Make a little extra sauce and put about 1/2 a cup on the bottom of the baking dish before adding the rolled up enchiladas.  This prevents them from become hard/burnt on the bottom.  Also, use cooking spray to make clean up fast and easy.

I love this recipe. I don't think it comes close to an authentic enchilada but it is a delicious, quick chicken recipe. It doesn't look as good on my plate as in this picture shown. Made this many times. I like to use more cheese on top and in the inside.

My dad says this is better than any enchilada dish he's had in a restaurant!  I have many people ask me to make this for them if I am cooking.  Can never make too much of this!  Fantastic recipe!  The only thing I changed was putting spiced canned diced tomatoes on top instead of fresh tomatoes, only because I am lazy.  :)

This is a great recipe! It's a bit time comsuming but well worth it. We add sliced pickled jalapenos with the tomato and onion on top.

My family LOVES this recipe.  It makes quite a bit!  I find that if I mix up some of the ingredients the day before it ends up not taking quite as much time to cook.  I cut my chicken into strips and boil them for this recipe.  After they're cooked, I shred them.  It makes them all soft, tender, and evenly cooked for the enchiladas.  The sauce adds great flavor!  AMAZING.

Was so easy to make. Wasn't expensive at all. I bought a cooked rotisserie chicken from the deli of my store to use in this recipe. I have a newborn baby and a 6 yr old and had no problem getting this made real quick before they hassled me

We make this recipe all the time.  It is so easy and the kids love it.  I use fat free sour cream, lowfat cheese, the lowfat soup and the high fiber tortilla shells to make it healthier.  There are never any leftovers on this one.

Great recipe! My filling only made 7 enchiladas, but that was plenty. Perhaps I filled mine a bit more than called for. I also added a can of green chilies. Will definitely fix again!

Fixed this last night and my family loved it!  I put my pace picante sauce in the blender first b/c my kiddos don't like chunks.  I made extra sauce and covered the bottom of the dish first.  My hubby said these are better than the restaurants.. and we live in Texas where Mexican food is plentiful!!

We all love these enchiladas! I do everything exactly the same but after I put the sauce mixture over the enchiladas, I put more shredded montery jack cheese on top with green onion and tomato. Its so pretty! and taste even better with extra cheese :)

I had these at a friend's house and they were sooo good.  They weren't very spicy, so if you like spice, use hot picante sauce.  She said she used 4 chicken breasts, which is more chicken that it calls for, and she used extra cheese.  I never would've thought something this easy would be so good.  Try them!  And don't complicate it by adding a bunch of other spices.  The fact that it's easy is part of why I liked it.

These were great.  My Father-in-law even asked for me to reheat some of the leftovers for him tonight.  I did make a change-Taco sauce-because that was the closest thing we had.  I agree with some that say it does not look the greatest when on a plate.  Maybe we should all have a lesson in how to roll and tuck.

I absolutely love this recipe!  The cream of chicken soup really makes a difference.  I use canned chicken instead of cooking any chicken, which really saves a lot of time, money, and still tastes amazing!  After I put them on the plate, I top them with the green onions and tomatoes.  Even my little brothers love this dish!

Excellent recipe!  Must admit that I made a couple of alterations.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast and sauteed it in about a tablespoon of margarine.  Then I added sliced peppers and onions to the chicken for seasoning.    Once the chicken was cooked through, I chopped the chicken, peppers, and onions smaller before adding them to the sauce mix.  I also added a cup of cheese to the topping.  The family loved it and voted the recipe a "keeper", which for my picky eaters means a lot.  Thanks for sharing!

It was delicious!  The enchilada filling didn't make enough for 10 tortillias, but I didn't have room in the pan for 10 anyway!  I also wasn't sure what the difference was between picante sauce and salsa.  After some internet searching, I went ahead and used the store brand salsa I had in the pantry.  It worked perfectly.  I'm a very inexperienced cook, and I found this recipe easy and yummy.

I have made this recipe several times.  It is great!  I have tried using larger tortilla shells vs. the smaller size the recipe recommends.  I would not do that again.  You lose a lot of the flavor and end up with way too much tortilla shell.

I give it 5 stars simply because it was tasty, everyone enjoyed it and most importantly....it was QUICK!  I have made several different enchilada recipes and while they are good none are as easy as this one.  Very kid friendly...my picky eaters even asked for seconds which is rare in this house.

If I have made this once I have made it a hundred times and the only thing I hear is why didn't you make more... By the way you can cook some ground beef and use it instead of the chicken or use left over chicken or stuff it with cheese anyway that you do it, it is still a hit every time

Very good.  I would use a little less soup next time.  I had some left after assembling the parts.  Everyone loved them.

These are great! Instead of Pace picante sauce i used enchilada sauce and rotel. When i rolled them up i added a little of the soup mixture, a little rotel and some cheese. I poured the rest of the enchilada sauce on top and they were so good. I will definitely make these again!!!

I've made this recipe several times and it is very good. I make small changes every time like a little less sour cream and soup mix. I never put tomatoes or onions in it. I'm getting ready to make it again and I'm going to try On The Border salsa instead of the Pace Picante sauce. It's good with Pace but it has a distinctive flavor.

This dish was delicious! I actually used cream of mushroom soup since that was all I had on hand and made my own Picante sauce (which was a snap) and I got raves from all my dinner guests.
This recipe is definetly a keep!

I made this with leftover Turkey from Thanksgiving. SO good as is. The only change I made was using red onions instead of green and baking them on top of the enchiladas the whole time to make them tender. Perfect leftover creation!!

Mushy tortillas, sloppy topping, and looks terrible!!  The filling was the only redeeming part.  I used a leftover grilled chicken breast and tore it into strips, mixed it with the picante and cheese and added fresh chopped cilantro.  I then filled the tortillas with it and should have just used a regular enchilada sauce and cheese topping instead of that unappealing soup topping, but I saw that there were a ton of reviews saying this was good and I'm staying in a beach house right now with limited kitchen resources so I used what was here....will not make this again.

My Husband thought these were great.  I used turkey instead of chicken as that was what I had on hand.  I also added some garlic as we both love it.  Will certainly make these again.

Wow. These were awesome! I ate all of the leftovers, which I usually never do. They were a bit too spicy because of a little confusion on my part. It calls for Pace picante sauce, which I suppose is more of a chunky mild salsa? I used Tapatio salsa picante, which is a thin hot sauce...I will try the Pace instead next time. I don't mind spicy food, especially when it tastes that good! Served with spanish rice and refried beans. Perfect!

I added black beans, and spanish style rice to the mixture. Really tasted authentic. We all loved the creamy-ness of the recipe. I served them with shredded lettuce, sour cream and avacado slices. Next time I am going to try adding a sauteed onion to the filling.

I've been making this for years, and it is one that my husband requests over and over.  Very creamy for when you want that.  I use larger tortillas, because I usually have burrito size on hand, and you can be liberal with varying ingredients and the amounts used.

My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this dish. He went back for seconds! I already had some store brand salsa on hand, so I used that instead of Pace. Other than that the only changes I made was to take it out of the oven after 30 minutes and add cheese. After baking for the last 10 minutes I added a can of Rotel on top instead of a tomato. I'm sure I'll be making this again.

Five stars from the kids!  I would have given this a 4, but the fact that all of my kids at all of theirs without one complaint, especially my very picky 7 year old who doesn't really like anything that's not pasta and dislikes most meats, earned it a 5 in my book.  She even asked for more...unheard of! Easy to make, and tasted much better than I expected.  I served it with enriched long grain white rice, and it was pretty yummy.  My husband liked it too. I didn't have tomatoes or onions, so we just had the sauce on top.  I only had raspberry salsa, and though I was afriad that woud make it gross, it didn't.  I'll keep this one and do it again.

this was a wow. , and i made a few changes. i used a hot picante sauce so i left out the chilli powder. i used more sour cream and picante sauce (about a cup and a half of each) and browned the chicken with onions. i used 2 green onions and two tomatoes, as i like a bit more of both.  also i took the cover off them about 10 min. before they were done. got raves from both of my guests. will make this again.

This is a keeper! Very easy and kid friendly. When finished baking I sprinkled cheese on top and then we put salsa on top when served instead of tomatoes. We had these with baked nachos and served sour cream and salsa on the side. Great Sunday supper! Thanks!

These were very good. My son had his doubts due to the soup factor, but he loved them and came over tonight for the leftovers. I will make these again. The only thing I did differently was add cheese to the top. *Upon eating some of the leftovers of this tonight, I agree with Georgia, I think I prefer a more authentic enchilada recipe to this one. This is ok, but won't make it on a regular basis.

This was okay, but nothing to write home about - a little too saucy for me, I prefer the more authentic Enchiladas.

These were yummy! I did not have chili powder, so used taco seasoning instead. I also baked UNcovered. I didn't want my tortillas to be soft/soggy. Two thumbs up from my husband!

I torn this recipe out of a magazine. A little different. Same ingrediants, different amounts.
Good Stuff! Not unique or gourmet but tasty and picky kid friendly.
I found the sauce was really thick and after 45 mins in the oven the enchiladas weren't hot in the center. We finally stuck them in the microwave for a couple of minutes. Next time I will thin the sauce a little. All in all a good dinner.

This is a very tasty dish! Though it's a little creamy.
