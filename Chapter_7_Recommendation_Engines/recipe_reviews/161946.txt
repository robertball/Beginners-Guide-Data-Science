INCREDIBLE !!!! I took it to a baby shower and at least 90% ov the women there asked for the recipe.  It is excellent.  i used less onion, but otherwise followed ingreds.  i find that the small papayas are better than the large Mexican ones.

The dressing makes WAY too much for the amount of salad.  Either cut down or save it to use all week long

This was a great way to use up my tropical fruit!  I gave it 4 stars because I wasn't sure if I liked the onion.
