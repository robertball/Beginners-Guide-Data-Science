Wow! I've made this several times and it is a MUST for your dessert collection--quick simple and delish. Because we have 5 in our family, I divide the batter between 5 ramekins and bake 27 minutes resulting in a lava filling which my family loves. Nutella was used for the hazelnut spread and the one person in my family that doesn't like Nutella had no idea--this fact will remain our secret! One was left at room temp until the following day and was like a dark choc pudding on the inside. Delicious hot or not :)

Very nice! Richer than the other pudding cake recipes i have tried. I added a little vanilla bean to the batter, and reduced the sugar slightly and substituted a couple of tablespoons of amaretto in the boiling water. If you lightly spray the ramekins before filling they will be easy to clean.

I adjusted the servings to halve the recipe, and baked it in two ramekins. I didn't have nutella, so used 1 tbsp melted butter instead. I used mini chocolate chips. I would possibly add a dash of vanilla or a smidgen of cinnamon next time, although it was thoroughly enjoyed as is.

They left rock-hard cake material around the inside of the ramekin. They tasted fine, but I would not make it again.
