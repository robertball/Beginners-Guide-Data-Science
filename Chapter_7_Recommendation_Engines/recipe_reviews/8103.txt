To avoid the "hole in the center" when the cream cheese tunnel doesn't hold up to slicing, add an egg and 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp. baking powder to the cream cheese mixture. Yummy cake!

This was delicious. I actually made two cakes: one as listed here and the second I used white chocolate chips. Everyone preferred the white chocolate center. Also, on the second cake I sprinkled the pecans on top instead of in it (in case someone doesn't like nuts), increased the cream used in the cream cheese mixture by 2 tablespoons, and made a white chocolate glaze to compliment the chocolate glaze. Yummy!

My coworkers and my husband loved this!  I'm not usually a chocolate lover, but it tastes like a chocolate cake with cheesecake in the middle. Yum!  I did add an egg to the cream cheese mixture before baking and it turned out perfectly.  I will definitely make this again!

This cake was fabulous!  We poured a raspberry coulis over each piece before serving.  Delicious!  I made this cake in a bundt pan, and it seemed like there was almost too much filling.  Next time I may cut the filling in half.  ----  Just made this for the second time, and used white chocolate chips for the filling and only 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese.  Worked great.  The whole cake dissapeared very quickly.  I suggest to serve this cake cold.  OH, I also omited the nuts.

This cake is to die for!  I didn't make the glaze; instead I melted some semisweet, milk and white chocolate chips (separately) and drizzled them alternatively over the cake.  I then put shavings of white and milk chocolate on top.  What a presentation!

YUMmy!!!  This cake is so good.  I served it at a cinco de Mayo party we had lastnight and everyone loved it.  I did not serve it cold but would recomend doing so, It's even better today cold, I can't get enough of this delicous, scrumptious cake and so easy to make.  I made it without nuts and substituted the coffee for choclate milk and put melted whhite choclate and dark cholclate chips, beautiful and tasty!!!

I brought this for a co-workers birthday today and everyone is raving about. I personally think the cake part is dry so will try cooking for a little less time next time.

This was a great cake for my husbands Birthday, I used a dark chocolate cake mix....I added an egg to the cream cheese mixture.....For the ganache I added 1 tablespoon of corn syryp and 2 tablespoons of butter so it became nice and shiney! I will use this cake recipe over and over and next time I think I will make a cherry cream cheese filling.  I figure this recipe can be changed in many ways with different fillings and different flavors cake mixes.

Good recipe!  I took the suggestion of another to substitue white chocolate chips for the filling.  It tasted very yummy.  Although, I wish that the cake itself was a bit more moist.

My family loved this cake!  I made it to serve to our new pastor and his family, and I want to thank the author for helping me make a great impression.  I only baked the cake for 45 minutes, and that kept it from drying out on the bottom.  I omitted the nuts and it was just as delicious!

Absolutely delicious.  I baked it for 45 min which was the perfect amount of time.  I also substitued chocolate milk for coffee.  The second time it overflowed the pan so I may use less cake batter next time.

Great tasting cake. I made it for a birthday cake for my daughter. I added the egg to the cream cheese mixture but I still had a little problem with the middle falling from the rest of the cake. Maybe next time I will add flour as some others have done. Also it was too much mixture for the size of the cake so I didn't add all of it.  But we loved the "cream cheese" on the inside. Thanks!

Holy cow.  This one is rich!  Made as written except subbed coconut oil for veggie oil.  Read reviews about cake being too dry so I took it out after 45 minutes.  Because the cream cheese mixture is chocolate- you won't actually see the "tunnel".  Made this with the help of my two boys- it was simple enough for them to do.

We LOVED this recipe. I did make a few changes though. 1st, I used the "Sunday Best Chocolate Cake" recipe on this site, instead of the cake mix. I'm not a big cake mix fan. I halfed the cream cheese mixture, because I olnly had 1 pkg of cream cheese. It turned out great still though. It actually may have been too cream cheesy had I used the amount called for. All in all, a wonderful recipe that my boyfriend called "Awesom!" This will be added to our list of faves for sure! Thanks for sharing this one :)

This has become "my" chocolate cake recipe. I made it for a potluck at my husbands work, and the plate came back empty with all the glaze scraped off. The only changes I made were I substituted water for the coffee (I don't like the coffee flavor) and I added a white chocolate glaze on top of the other for appearance. Divine!

This cake was rich and delicious, however, when I made the cake there was a large hole in the cream cheese part which made slicing difficult.  I am not sure what I did wrong.  Delicious, though!!!

Very easy to make.  Quite moist.  I used mini-chocolate chips for the recipe, and I had about 1/4 cup left over.  I sprinkled them on top of the glaze -  made a very nice presentation.

This is a great recipe.  I used my favorite chocolate cake recipe instead of the mix and it turned out wonderful!  An impressive -looking glazed cake, with the extra richness of cholate cheesecake; when you serve it with really good vanilla ice cream -- what can be better than that!?

this is really a good bundt cake, and somewhat surprising. I think the sauce is never to be looked over unless you want the cake to loose its moistness...

Flavor was fantastic.  Super moist and really fudgy; however, the tunnel part sunk and stuck to the pan so only half the cake came out.  I even followed other reviewers' suggestions but no luck.  It was fantastic dumped on top of ice cream;-)

I added the egg to the tunnel and saved 1/3 of the cake batter to gently spread over it before baking.  The topping was sweet but ok.  I made this for an office b-day and am being hounded to make it again already!  I would love to try a pineapple cake mix with pineapple/coconut filling, white chocolate/coconut ganache...yum

I was blown away by this dessert. It was one of the most decadent chocolate desserts I have ever had, it was as good if not better then fancy desserts you get in the high end resturants. You will be a hero if you bring this to your next gathering. I did add about 1/2 Cup water to the chocolate cake mix, it was a little to thick, and that extra water made it perfect.

Very easy to make and a huge hit!  I had a white cake mix, so I added 1/4 c. cocoa to the cake mix.  I made the following adjustments based on other reviews:  I used white chocolate chips with the cream cheese mixture and added an egg as well as 1/4 c flour.  I also let it cool 1 1/2 hours in the pan before inverting, and had no problems with the cake collapsing.  Instead of the glaze, I melted white chocolate chips, dark chocolate chips, and milk chocolate chips and drizzled on top.  

Next time, I will cut back on the cream cheese to 1 8oz and 1 3 oz package as I had extra this time.  Great recipe!

I made this yesterday for a friend's birthday party.  I was really nervous because i usually screw up baked goods.  But I just followed the recipe - the only thing I changed out of necessity was to use skim milk instead of heavy cream, and i didn't have any pecans, but this was delicious and I'm sure it would have been better with them. :P So many people commented on how good the cake was - thank you very much for the recipe! :)

Very good. I used water instead of coffee, and just one cream cheese. I will follow the advice to add one egg to cream cheese because it did not hold up to slicing. When I took the cake out of bundt it caved in. I put it back in pan, and took out again next morning. The cake was in pretty good shape. I only baked for 55 minutes, but will make sure it is VERY cool next time before taking out. I am looking forward to trying with the white chocolate.

Delicious!  The only change I made was to substitute water for the coffee.  Turned out great.

This cake is so good!  Very rich! I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  The cake is good without heating, but serving warm with ice cream....AWESOME!!! I would definitely recommend this:-)

This cake is very unique and rich.  I did like it but I probably won't make it again.  Everyone who tried it liked it but I prefer really moist chocolate cakes.  The cream cheese part is moist but not the actual cake.  Maybe it is the type of mix I use I'm not too sure but overall it is very unique and chocolatey.  It tastes really good with milk and really looks beautiful with the icing.

This is a great cake!!  Very rich, decadent and hard to stay away from!  I made one for my work Christmas luncheon using buttercotch chips for the filling, and one for my family using chery chips in the filling.  Both were out of this world!!

Made this cake for a birthaday.  Everyone from 2 to 86 loved it.....
I did find...when I removed the cake from the pan....it fall....the cream cheese tunnel was too soft to support itself....so I slipped it back into the pan...and served it from the pan...with the glaze poured over each slice....
Next time I will bake the cake in a glass loaf pan...and serve from the pan

This cake is the bomb!!!  It is the most decadent, rich, cake ever.  It rivals the standard Tunnel of Fudge, let me tell you.  This recipe is for all chocoholics (or cheesecake lovers for that matter)!

I only baked the cake for 40 minutes and the cake part is very, very dry.  Had I baked for the full recommended time, the cake would have been no good at all.  Maybe it's just me, but something about this recipe is off.  

I did however take the advice of others here and added an egg to the cream cheese mixture, that turned out great! But I don't think I will bother to make this again.

We baked this cake too long because the toothpick test does simply not work on this cake - probably because of the cream cheese tunnel. The cake part was a little on the dry side so I think we will try it again and not bake it as long. It was still excellent with ice cream, however!

This cake just didn't work for me. It should be baked in a tubepan so the cream cheese sinks to the middle and not on the bottom in a bundt pan when you invert it. The cake was quite dry and not a lot of flavor. It wasn't as WOW as I had hoped it would be.

Very interesting cake!  I think next time I will use 2 boxes of cake mix though (double the cake recipe) because it was a bit much fudge for the cake.  It was a yummy cake though, I will totally make it again!

I made this cake for the 4th of July and it was a big hit.The kids loved it and the adults too.I didn't use all the fudgy filling as it seemed like it was going to fall over against the sides of the pan if I stacked anymore in,but there was still plenty when the cake was cut.Chocolate lovers will be your friends for life if you make this cake.

The cake was DELICIOUS! I would recommend only making it for parties or if you have company over. I made it one day just because I was craving some chocolate cake. It was SO rich and delicious but I couldn't eat it all! I ended up throwing half of it away!

Awesome recipe!

This was the first time I really ever made a cake and it was wonderful. I followed the advice from everyone and added an egg and flour to the cream cheese mixture and my cake didn't collapse!  I'm cooking at high elevations, so I also added flour to the cake mix as well.

Better cold than hot:) Definitely worth your time.

everybody seemed to like it and the filling was good but the cake part was a little dry for me.  i'm not sure if it's the long baking time or if it needs more liquid/oil.  i don't think i'll be making this again.  but the icing was yummy!

Forgiving recipe. I can never follow a recipe without tweaking and this time, I also forgot several things. Then I totally left out the frosting but that is because I share our baking with the future in-laws and we try to keep sugar down. So the things I did different ... cream cheese layer; used only 8 oz cream cheese, 1 egg and 1/3 + 1/6 cup sugar, forgot the heavy cream and left out the choc chips. Cake layer; used only 1/4 cup vegetable oil and forgot the nuts. Got two 8inch (baked 55 mins) and one 4inch (baked 30 mins) loaves. Boyfriend and son ate one larger loaf between them in 15 mins. Rated only 3 because of the many changes. Will return when I follow the recipe exactly.

Very rich and good. A little goes a long way, so it is great for big crowds. I loved the combination of the slight coffee flavor with the cream cheese. The pecans make it perfect.
