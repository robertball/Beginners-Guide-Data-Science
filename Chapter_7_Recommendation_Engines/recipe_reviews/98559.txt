I had this once at a birthday party when I was younger. I found it to be creative and tasty. We also added green sprinkles for chives.

You can also use cocoa powder instead of hot chocolate mix. I too used green sprinkles for chives and cut a slit in the top of the "potato" to expose the inside. On Martha Stewart, they used butter to make butter pats as well, and served with chocolate sauce.

I did this for my kids for April Fool's Day.  I told them, "This is your dinner, you need to eat it or you can't leave the table!" (Mom mean voice). They loved it!!

When I make this treat,I use cinnamon with a bit of sugar instead of the cocoa drink mix,and I make a slit and put green sprinkles for chives,a lemon drop for butter,with a couple of dollops of whipped cream as well as shaved chocolate bar for bacon bits. A friend freezes caramel candies and shreds them to use as the cheese.

A yellow Starburst also makes a nice pat of butter.  Daughter loved this.  I served on April Fools Day along with a rice cereal meatloaf.

I made this for my kids for an April Fools Day Dinner Fake Out. I scooped the ice cream onto plastic wrap. Rolled the plastic up to fit the ice cream and squished it to form the potato. I put a valley in the middle of the potato and froze it until hard. Unwrapped the plastic and rolled ice cream in a bowl of Hershey's cocoa and some cinnamon sugar. Melted a couple tablespoons of marshmallow fluff and a few drops yellow food coloring in the microwave and stirred it all together for the "butter". Filled in the potato valley with canned whipped cream and topped it with the melty marshmallow fluff.  Kids loved it!

What a wonderful idea.  Company loved the idea and it was a great entertainment idea.  My 'off-brand' hot chocolate was a little gritty so next time I will sift the hot chocolate for a finer texture.  My kids thought it was great also.

What a clever idea.  My kids loved it.  Super easy and tastey.  I will certainly make these again.  My kids thought that it was so funny to eat 'baked potato' for dessert.  A kid pleasing recipe.

Okay, this is cute. I decided to try it out of curiosity. I didn't have a cocoa packet but I had a sugar free packet of Carnation instand breakfast in chocolate and 1/2 fat creamy vanilla ice cream. I thought it kind of resembled a baked potato. Obviously, a potato doesn't have a powdery substance on the outside though. I asked someone else what it was and they had no idea. I won't say what there one and only guess was. Either way, ice cream rolled in chocolate malted powder with whipped cream on top tastes pretty good.

I'm way to lazy to make 'em...but love to go see Chef Lou and Westside Drive Inn in Boise for the ones they make.  A wonderful Idaho treat from the land of potatoes.
