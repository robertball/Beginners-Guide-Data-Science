01-12-17 ~ Great recipe on a chilly January night.  School was canceled today, so it was a perfect day to prepare a delicious meal.  I did use fresh potatoes rather than store bought.  Otherwise, I kept the recipe the same.  I cooked it in my electric skillet and paired it with fresh fruit and a raspberry quick bread.
