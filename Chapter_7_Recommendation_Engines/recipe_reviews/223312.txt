I used one generous cup mini chocolate chips and an additional generous cup of dark chocolate chips in this recipe. Baked at 350*, these were perfectly done at ten minutes. I let them cool on the sheet slightly before pulling them off to cool on my countertop. After they cooled, they were perfectly soft with a wonderful chewy texture. BAKERY STYLE COOKIES. Seriously. The family was very impressed with these cookies. Eight thumbs up!

This is a great cookie! Soft, chewy, and most importantly chocolate-hazelnutty! The yield says it makes 2 doz cookies, but when my hubby made them, we got about 5 doz out of them, using a standard 1 oz scoop.
This cookie is definitely worth making though!

Just made these cookies, RAVE! reviews. Best cookie I ever made. Crisp outside delicious soft moist inside, so awesome. I read the reviews before making this one. I did not have chocolate chips or hazelnuts on hand. Therefore, I used 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup cocoa powder and 3/4 cup Nutrella and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Like one reviewer I rolled into 2 inch balls set timer for 12 minutes they were perfect, like a fancy bakery. Thank you so much for this recipe. It makes me so happy to see big smiles as they munched on these cookies.

These cookies are AWESOME!  Totally yummy.  I left out the hazlenuts ONLY because my son won't eat nuts.  I tried out a 1/2 batch and they vanished.  I'm making a double batch tomorrow to take to the PTA meeting.  Thank you for a super YUMMY recipe!  p.s. - don't overbake, they will set-up perfectly as written.

I added a cup of Nutella instead of a 1/2 cup and I toasted my hazelnuts for 5 mins in the oven first before adding to mixture and they came out great. Even my husband and father who don't care much for sweets couldn't stop eating these.

I would say these were...meh. Like other reviewers, I liked the texture- crispy outside and chewy inside. However, I just didn't think they were chocolatey hazelnutty enough. I might try again doubling the nutella.

We were fresh out of hazelnuts so I used chopped peanuts. These were a surprise for my husband and he LOVED them. Chewy, soft, a tiny bit crispy on the outside...basically, perfect. I made them with extra large balls (2" in diameter) and the 12 minute cooking time resulted in some gorgeous cookies. Yum. Yum. Yum. I am so glad we were out of peanut butter and I had to find an alternative recipe!

This recipe is simply exquisite. I made these cookies twice so far and there are never any left over! Really soft and chewy for about 1-3 days, then it gets a little hard but I just microwave them briefly and they go back to the original softness. I did reduce the sugar a bit the second time since I felt it was a tad bit too sweet for my preference. I also didn't have any hazelnuts o hand so I just used a tad more Nutella to compensate for that. Overall, I'm really happy I discovered this recipe!

We used a generous cup of milk chocolate morsels. We cooked them for 10 min at 325 degrees as our oven gets crazy hot.

Everyone who is burning these cookies, you are doing something wrong! These were perfect. I worked with what I had to instead of 2 1/2 cups flour I did 2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of oats. I didn't have chocolate chips or hazelnuts so that was my texture. I also only did half cup butter and substituted  half cup oil then 1 tbs vanilla and 1 tbs brewed coffee. Everything else I followed exactly including time cooked and they are delicious! Must try will make again and again. Thank you for the recipe Ms. Mechanic!

These were fantastic.  Left out the nuts and added some extra chips.  Requested for the next snack day.

As chocolate chip cookies, these are great. I agree with others though that the "nut" of nutella was missing. Maybe adding the hazelnuts or just a touch more nutella would help. Great cookie though.

They were pretty expensive, and while they were "OK," I didn't feel they quite justified the cost. They turned out really thin and crunchy, and without a whole lot of Nutella flavor. I will have to experiment with these...

Pretty decent recipe; I made some alterations based on what I had on hand: 
- I used 1/2 c vegetable shortening and 1/2 c coconut oil instead of butter and they ended up being quite moist...but not "crispy" on the outside and "chewy" on the inside like others have said, more just cakey. I agree, don't overbake--my first batch dried out a little bit. - Also, I decreased the flour by about 1/4 c and added a 1/4 c of the cocoa powder--because I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand but wanted them super chocolatey, which they were. Great flavor.
- Used only 2 teaspoons of vanilla, as 2 tablespoons sounded like a lot.
- I also added chopped walnuts instead of toasted hazelnuts, just because I had some around. But next time I think I'll do the hazelnuts (and the choc chips) as I think they'll be even better!

Strongly recommend you use a stand-alone mixer that can handle thick doughs without burning out! If you have only a hand mixer, you can melt the Nutella and the Butter instead of using room temp for a more watery and workable texture. The cookies won't come out chewy and will have a different texture, but they'll still taste good. 

Also, we don't really like nuts in our baked goods and didn't have chocolate chips, so we left those out. The cookies still came out really tasty, but were missing something. So we topped them instead with just a drizzle of melted Nutella and powdered sugar, and they were perfect. Simply divine! 

These cookies without nuts and chocolate chips really have a ton of potential and versatility. They will make an excellent base for all sorts of dessert toppings from fruit, to icings and powders, to dips and ice creams of any kind. They aren't overly sweet or chocolatey/Nutellaish, so get creative!

These were super easy and so delicious!!  I subbed finely chopped pecans for the hazlenuts because that was what I had, and after making 2 batches I've had to put the rest of the dough in the freezer so my husband can pull them out a couple at a time to bake... so I won't be tempted to eat the whole batch!

These are terrific cookies!! I made them for a college care package for a Nutella lover, and she's going to love them! I made these cookies almost exactly as written (I only used 1 Tablespoon of vanilla). I baked them for 10 minutes and used about 1 Tablespoon of dough for each cookie. The recipe made 4 dozen cookies this way. Chewy and soft on the inside - take them out soft and let them set up.

I would have taken a photo but they were gone before I had the chance.  Seriously, these cookies are soo good. I made them last week and I am making them again this week.  Very soft cookies and not super duper sweet. I didn't include the hazelnuts or chocolate chips because I didn't have them but the cookies were still delicious without! You need to bake these! I didn't have a problem with the cookies burning easily like another reviewer... I was skeptical that I could tell when to take the cookies out by them being "fragrant" but the smell of yummy nutella cookies told me they were done.  Mine only took 10-12 ish minutes (depending on the cookie size).

The edges got too crispy too fast. They are very easily burnt. And the flavor is only slightly Nutella. The saltiness and char wasn't pleasant. So I had another pan of dough ready, so I baked them in muffin tins, so they would keep a better shape. They came out like a brownie which was soooo much better. They were gooey on the inside and chocolatey. Still salty. Overly dense, even for a brownie. I topped it with Peppermint marshmallow frosting for Christmas and my family raved over the flavor combo. It really lightened the taste of disappointment for me. Everybody else loved them though. Next time, I'm trying something different. I would recommend a trial run before you take these to an event.

They were good but not great. Prefer traditional chocolate chip cookies. Made about 6 dozen using a 1-inch cookie scoop.

It was good but.....there was too much butter and too much salt. I could not taste the chocolate enough either. It’s  partly my fault, I’m not the best baker but I found that there was too much of some ingredients and not enough of others.

Changes I made:

Added chopped chocolate chunks, doubled Nutella, 350F for 11 minutes. Toasted hazelnuts in advance. Tablespoon sized round balls, spreads during baking. Refrigerate dough between batches to prevent flatter cookies. Makes about 4 dozen cookies.

So I made these twice hoping that without the added cocoa that I'd be able to taste the Nutella more.  The cookies in my photo show the two varieties---one with and one without the added cocoa.  Still they were just okay for me.  I need to get the okay from my Nutella lovers (granddaughters).   I will edit my review when they give me the heads-up!

I was on the hunt for the perfect Nutella cookie. As per another reviewer’s suggestion, I reduced the sugar and doubled up on the Nutella. I also used white chocolate chips as that was all I had on hand. Although we were disappointed that even with the extra Nutella they didn’t taste very “Nutella-y”, these were really delicious cookies. Using a 1 tbsp measure, this recipe yielded ninety (YES 90!) cookies. Will definitely make again, with regular chocolate chips, just to see if that was the missing link.

We didn’t have hazelnuts so we substituted peanuts. Just as yummy. And of course, we cut the white sugar in half and added a bit more brown. So good.

Great recipe, wouldn't change a thing!  If you preheat and pull them at exactly 10min, they retain their  soft chewy goodness even after cooling.  Definitely adding this one to my repertoire, thanks!

This is a very easy recipe for delicious chocolate chip cookies.  I omitted the nuts and used a generous 3/4 cup of Nutella.   The hazelnut flavor is subtle to non-existent.  However, these cookies are still delicious, with crisp exteriors and chewy insides.  Make sure to let them fully cool before removing them from the pan and/or eating them.  Also, 10 minutes in the oven is enough - they look not quite done when you take them out but they solidify when cooling.  I'd make these again.  If you want to be extra decadent, add a smear of Nutella on top as frosting.

These are delicious! Perfect for Nutella lovers. I did omit two things: the powdered cocoa and the chopped hazelnuts. I felt the Nutella on its own would provide enough of that chocolate hazelnut flavor and I felt they came out just perfect that way. They are basically a chocolate chip cookie with Nutella hints throughout. SO good!

Recipes makes a ton of cookies! I've made about 36 give or take. The texture is good (crispy and crinkly on the outside & soft and chewy inside) however they basically just taste like sugar cookies. Even with me using almost an entire container of 13oz Nutella... I opted out of the extra chips and we prefer no nuts. Maybe if I make this again I'll add more Nutella, less flour, and maybe find some Nutella chocolate chips if they exist! Lol

These cookies taste very good!   I'd probably rate them 4.5.   Not as Nutella-ish as I'd have liked,  but still are yummy.  Ended up adding a full cup of Nutella to try to boost the flavor.   Used pecans because that's what I had on hand.  They baked up perfectly and definitely satisfied my chocolate craving!

Really good flavor and texture.  I thought the dough would be too soft but it cooked up perfectly. (I also froze some cookie balls and cooked them regularly--turned out just the same.) Soft inside and crispy outside.  I used 3/4 cup margarine instead of the butter. I reduced the sugars and only used 1/2 cup of each and doubled the Nutella to 1 cup.  Will definitely make again!

I made the recipe just as it said.  It cooked in the time it was rated for.  So many of my cookies never cook in the time the recipe says.  It would be nice if they cooked up just a bit darker in color but they really taste nice.  The family loved them.

This may just be the best cookie EVERRRR! Certainly the bast I'VE ever baked, though I'm a very experienced & decent cook I'm definitely not a very experienced (or regular) baker. AllRecipes.com's contributors have consistently proven to be such a great, reliable resource I felt compelled to contribute my own (hopefully) helpful review.
I made these after searching online for a 5-star Nutella AND Oatmeal cookie. After looking over a few "easy," "no-bake" & other random interpretations, I landed on this one. Not an oatmeal version & certainly not a "4-ingredient recipe" but still "easy," thanks to not calling for any exotic surprise ingreds.
The only changes I made were to substitute a scant 1/2 cup of the flour w/ "old fashioned" oats, (T.J.'s, 5 min cooking, is that technically the 'quick cooking' kind?) & I used 1 stick each of salted & UNsalted cuz that's what I had on hand. I embraced the full TEASPOON of salt but cut back on the vanilla a bit cuz 2 TABLESPOONS sounded like a lot compared to Toll House Cookies, etc. (I also folded in a good amount of Benefiber, as I do to uassuage my guilt about eating sweets. Next time will sub Xylitol for the white sugar to lower the 40 grams!) Theses came out PERFECT. if making them with all unsweetened butter in the future I'll definitely add a bit more salt to achieve the same PERFECT BALANCE. 
Be warned: These are BEYOND addictive!

I was snowed in today and made these cookies. I didn't have brown and white sugar so I used evaporated cain juice for both sugars. Unfortunately I didn't have chocolate chips either. They were still really yummy the texture was great. They would be knock out with chocolate chips!

I changed a couple of things, I used only 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugars. I added 1/2 cup of cocoa powder. I baked at 375 instead of 400, and baked for 9 min instead of 12..They were soft and chewy.. Love these cookies...

I added an extra 1/2 cup Nutella and the cookies still didn't taste like Nutella. The hazelnuts don't taste good in the cookies either. Would not make again.

Just made these and they are delicious ! Can't wait to make it again. The chocolate chips and chopped hazelnuts are a perfect touch to the cookies. I love them

It was very good I did use a small container of Nutella and also browned my hazelnuts over a medium heat everyone loved them and gave them a 4.5 out of 5. I agree with another review I was able to get 5 dozen from this recipe and they are good sized cookies. They will be a staple for my grandchildren.

These cookies are amazing, my husband had 5 right out of the oven. I added some toffee bits because I did't have hazelnuts. I baked them 12 minutes exactly and they turned out perfectly soft in the middle.

I followed this recipe to the tee and it came out perfect! They seemed a little mushy/melted when I pulled them out of the oven after 12 minutes (used a small cookie scooper), but after a few minutes sitting on the pan, the outsides crisped up while the insides were chewy! 

I also didn't have hazelnuts, but chopped toasted almonds did the trick. Nutella taste isn't super obvious, however. Someone recommended doubling the Nutella -- I might try that next time.

My version included 2 bags (23 ounces) of milk chocolate chips. :-) I used the recipe for 2 dozen, but adding the extra chocolate chips ended up yielding me 4 dozen. My fiance liked them. He will be taking some to work, tomorrow. Next time, I think I will throw in some dark chocolate, instead of using all milk chocolate. I omitted the nuts because I am allergic. I baked them for 350 for 11 minutes; 1 minute to cool before transferring to a rack. Thanks for the recipe!

Texture was ok, flavor was ok. 2 tablespoons of vanilla didn't seem right so I used 2 teaspoons.

My 14 yr old daughter just made them and they're fabulous. Used sliced almonds and white chocolate chips because that's what we had.

Had a difficult time with these cookies spreading out. Tried cooling the dough and adding more flour. Just didn't work out.
