This was a great dish to go along with Jamaican Jerked Chicken. I used 1/2 coconut milk and 1/2 water to cook the rice. Just perfect taste to go along with the spicyness of the main dish.

mmmm, definitely briliiant. would keep this recipe. I used shrimp in mine, and also added a dab of salt and pepper. like other reviewers it is definitely a different taste, but real good.

Other modifications; i used basmati rice and steamed the rice first till done. Then stir fried the cooked rice with the other ingredients. I also used coconut milk in part to cook the rice.

I was very suprised that I liked this!  I only made it to go with the Jamaican beef patties, and I had all the ingredients on hand, but it was actually pretty tastey.  I wouldn't want it everyday, and I was scared of eating any leftovers because of the banana, but it was definitely a good side for the Jamaican themed dinner.

I was quite pleasantly suprised by this recipe. My first thought was GROSS, but then I read the reviews and pretty much, on the whole, they were saying that this was a perfect compliment to a Jamaican Jerk recipe. So I thought I would give it whirl. I'm really glad that I did...and it was a perfect compliment to Jay's Jerk Chicken from this site. Only one person out of the five I made it for didn't like it...and that was solely because she doesn't like bananas. We won't count her...LOL! Thanks for a really unique and delicious recipe that I had a lot of fun making!!

Quite sweet (for a dinner rice in my opinion), but I combined it with chicken cooked with the jerk rub, and the two complimented each other wonderfully.

We made this rice with the 'Spicy Salmon and Caramelized Onions' recipe found on this site.  We did not have curry powder so we used a mixture of cumin, chili powder, cayenne, paprika, black pepper, and cinnamon instead.  We also added garlic when we sauteed the onions.  It was different but delicious!  Went perfectly with the spicy salmon.

Sorry but I just didn't like this. Also the people at the Caribbean Nights dinner didn't like it either. I followed the recipe all the way too. IF I do try it again, I would leave out the curry completely and use white rice rather than the brown.

My rice did not come out well at all. I think I need to add more water but before I realized it the rice and apples had begun to stick. I tried to salvage the dish but it didnt go over to well. Ill try to cook this again.

Very good with Jamaican Jerked Pork - left out the coconut and banana due to picky eaters in the family, and substituted veggi broth for water.  Great as a side dish with the spicy pork, rave reviews all around.

Good recipe, although, I found that I needed about 2/3 cup more water, as rice never steams quite the same when not cooked in a steamer or deep pot.  I did vary the recipe some, ommiting the bananna, but adding the coconut to the cooking rice instead of over.  I also used Jasmine rice instead of brown and a teaspoon of curry paste instead of powder.  I would make this again.

Good overall, but I made some adjustments to suit my taste. I love coconut, so I used 1 cup of coconut milk instead of the water, but ended up still needing to add 2/3 cup water in addition to that, as 1 cup of liquid simply was not enough. It needed salt as well. In the end, I thought it was very good- if you like this sort of food.

This was delicious! The whole family loved it, including my 10 month old! I shared the recipe with all my friends on another website and they're all excited to try it. I'd like to add chopped nuts or beans next time.

Excellent Recipe.  It was very unique and great with Jerk Chicken.  I used chicken broth instead of the water and brown sugar instead of molasses.   Really unique flavors!

That was severely bizarre.  The first 3 bites were good.  After that, ugh.  No more.  I ate it along side some spicy chicken, as per the suggestion in the description (and to get rid of a banana).  Naa... while the coconut milk I cooked it in did help, it's not quite right with spicy.  It's more of something I'd serve at a potluck with the serving size being a sampling.  A sampling was all I wanted.

I was nervous about how this would turn out, but it was delish. I added a half cup of coconut milk since my husband dislikes the texture of flaked coconut. It took about 10 minutes longer took, but was worth it. I think a bit of cinnamon and ginger would make it perfect for breakfast, while diced chicken, salt, and pepper would make it a complete one pot meal.

Ok I made this for girls night, theme was Jamaican food. I used a can of coconut milk and water, brown basmati rice. Smelled good but tasted weird to me. Guess I don't like Jamican food.

I don't particularly like raw coconut, so I substituted a half-cup of light coconut milk for part of the water. It gave it a good flavor, but was a little heavy. I think 1/4 c would do it. The rice also wasn't quite done after 30 minutes, so next time I would add a bit more liquid and cook longer. I really liked the unusual flavor, though, and will try it again.

This was a delicious side served with the Carribean Seasoned Chicken. Very tasty and not the ordinary side dish. I wouldn't add quite as many onions next time though.

This was a great accompaniment to our jerk chicken last night.  Highly recommend it - do not let the unique combination of ingredients scare you. You will be happy to have tried this culinary adventure.  I was. And will def make this meal again.  Thanks for sharing.

Unfortunately this was not a taste we could handle. I don't think my family would care for it even with changes made to it.

This was pretty tasty. It's milder than I thought it would be, but I added a little brown sugar and more banana. It goes really well with other vegetarian dishes.
