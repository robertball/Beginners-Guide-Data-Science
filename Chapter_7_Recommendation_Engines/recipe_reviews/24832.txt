I love this recipe . . .it is simple, simple, simple and, for that reason, good for Thanksgiving.  For a "little something extra" -- add honey and fresh lemon juice to taste.  Zips it right up and transforms simple yogurt into a "dressing".  Toasting the nuts adds an additional dimension as well.

It's quite spectacular for how simple it is. It's a very easy salad. For a little variation, I added chopped dates, and switched the almonds out for hazelnuts or pecans. I also use Pink Lady apples with it because they are still tart, but a bit sweeter - they are perfect for this salad. I enjoy how simple it is and you can always do small variations by changing an ingredient or two by just a little bit.

Fantastic! A fruit salad without cool whip, cream cheese or mayo! I love this salad Rachel. Very tasty and unique with the sweet and tart going on. I, of course, added celery. But even without my tasty little stalks, this salad was great. LOL. Thanks for sharing.

I omitted the cherries because I don't like them and decreased the almonds to the amount I had on hand. It was still absolutely delicious. I can't make this too often because I doubt my ability to refrain from eating the whole bowl.

I have served this salad twice now to rave reviews.  The smoothness of the yogurt nicely offsets the tartness of the apples.  I added both raisins and dried cranberries and left out the slivered almonds because my kids aren't crazy about them.  Great with barbequed ribs!

What a great recipe to go with Chili or Beef Stew for an autumn supper! I used a honey Greek yogurt which is much creamier and thicker than a standard yogurt and added a drop of vanilla oil and a squirt of honey. I used 3 Jonathan apples and 1 Granny Smith. This was fabulous and even better two days later. I also added some lemon juice so the apples wouldn't turn brown.  07/08/11 I have made this numerous times since I first reviewed in fall 2010.  This is a great recipe.  I recently made for 4th of July picnic using 4 different kinds of apples (Granny Smith, Pink Cripps, Pink Lady and Fuji). I doubled the recipe for a large group and added vanilla to the plain Greek yogurt as I suggested in my first review.  So many compliments and there was no leftovers to take home.  I think the name Autumn Apple Salad is misleading as this recipe transcends the seasons.  Another reviewer stated that dried fruit is too expensive. Yes, it is, but small amounts are called for and really make this dish sing.  Especially the dried cherries.  Try some honey too, as I think that also adds to the flavor immensely.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was just OK.  It wasn't very exciting.  I like all the ingredients, but it didn't do it for the group. I probably won't make it again.

Everyone loved this and wants the recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly doubling it so I'd have enough.  I squeezed half a lemon juice onto the apples to retain color.  I was curious to see how the salad would hold up overnight and I must say the leftovers were even yummier!  There won't be any left to see what 48 hrs does to it :)

The apples used in this salad make all the differece.  I was in the U.S. so I could get Braeburn and Honeycrisp (my absolute faves!) and the salad was amazing.  Used banana/strawberry yoghurt rather than vanilla because it was what was in my daughter's fridge and omitted the cherries.  When I tried it here in Uganda, the only apples I could get were Pinklady and it just isn't the same.  Added more lemon juice and honey to perk it up.  Good but not nearly like the first effort.  I rated it 5 stars because the basic recipe is easy and so delicious.

I made this for Christmas brunch. I used red and green apples, and chilled overnight. Huge hit with everyone, but I love it for snacks, so now I am making it again and again.

It was very good! Originally I thought the vanilla flavor was too mild so I added a 1/4 tsp vanilla. I also used dried blueberries instead of cherries. Everyone loved it!

Yum!! I made a single serving with a small granny smith,  a handful each of craisins, dried cherries, and toasted almonds, and a dollop of yogurt. Great blend of flavors. Thanks.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I used jonagold apples instead of the granny smith so it would be a bit sweeter, and also cherry-vanilla yogurt.

With respect to the person who submitted this recipe, but this one was lost on me. It did have some flavor, but it just didn't "do it" for anyone that ate it. At our office potlucks we have a rule about trying each other's dishes.... honesty.  I made this exactly as directed (no variations)..and not even half was eaten. It tasted okay...but.... just OKAY.

This was very creamy and good.  I am eating it right now!  I had some leftover apples and mandarin oranges from a grilled chicken salad I made last night so I used those.  I used a bag of dried mixed berries, so it was cranberries, cherries and blueberries.  I did not have any nuts so I just threw in some grapenuts to give it a crunch and then vanilla yogurt and I think it came out great.  I will make this a lot during the summer.

The salad is good, but has to be eaten immediately. I tried to refrigerate some and the results wer not good. The cherries and cranberries swelled and the apples started to juice due to the yogurt.  Make certain you can eat it right after preparing it.

This was okay.  Not something I would probably ever make again.  Were I to do so, I definitely would follow the advice of one user and use fuji apples instead of green.  It was just too tart.

Although the salad had a good flavor and its very healthy, I wasn't crazy about it.  I did not peel the apples and used Yoplait custard style yogurt. I will try again with cherry yogurt as others have suggested.

This was the best apple salad ever! It's easy and sooo delicious! I used dried cranberries and cherry-vanilla yogurt-fantastic! It's a regular at our house now.I've also tried adding pineapple chunks and used 1/2 apples and 1/2 pears too-relly good also.

Good...just not worth the money (dried fruit is expensive).  Healthy treat if you like it though.

Lovely recipe - the taste is not quite as lovely as the fruit salad dressing I make with heavy whipping cream, lime juice and powdered sugar, but the fact that it is both tasty AND virtuous means it's a keeper.  It was quick to assemble (huge bonus), and it lasted in the refrigerator for several days (days, not weeks).  This an excellent example where fast food really can be good tasting and healthy food.

This is a good and healthy recipe. However you have to really like tart apples--my husband does and he loved this. My kids and I prefer sweeter apples so I think I'll use Gala or Red Delicious instead of Granny Smith next time.

This was sooo easy and great!  I took it to a church covered lunch and it was perfect.  I didn't chop up the apples until right before we left for church so that the apples wouldn't turn brown.  I was a little wary of the recipe because it just seemed too simple.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  The sweet vanilla yogurt really gave it a nice flavor mixed with the tartness of the apples.  Carol

I really wanted to like this salad, but to me it was  just "okay". I felt like it was just a little bland, it was missing something? I used nice tart apples...perhaps some sort of cheese cubes would have helped? Anyway this certainly wasn't bad and very nice and healthy.

Thoroughly enjoy this healthy salad! I use about 2/3 fuji apples and 1/3 granny smith - I just am not very fond of tart apples. I also use vanilla Greek yogurt. So much healthier than the apple salad I used to make with Snickers Bars (=

This was a nice change of pace for a side dish. I used green delicious apples and double the amount of dried cherries. The contrast of sweet and tart was delicious.

So easy to make with ingredients usually on hand.  I've made this 2x this year & people always go back for seconds & thirds.  I usually use 1/2 tart & 1/2 sweet apples and have yet to make it w/ the cherries so don't worry if you don't have them it's still just as good.   I've never used any preserver and my apples aren't brown 2 or 3 days later.  I think the yogurt helps preserve them.  Also, I like it better when it's made the day before.

Tasted great as written, made it a second time with red apples, pomegrante seeds instead of cranberries and cherries & I added a bit of lemon juice and sour cream. Just wonderful stuff, I am going to serve this the next time I make pork chops. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a quick, easy, delicious and healthy recipe.  I didn't have almonds so subbed chopped pecans and didn't bother to toast them.  My husband, 3-year-old, and I loved this.  Hubby liked it even better than my usual take-to-every-potluck apple salad recipe made with dried cranberries, OJ and cinnamon.  And this is easier to make!  Thanks for a great recipe, Daisy!

This salad is so yummy.  I only had gala apples, so I used those, and also added some halved grapes. (so good!)  I also strained my yogurt to get it very thick and creamy:  you just put the yogurt in a strainer lined with a coffee filter and set it over a bowl. Cover & let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour.  I love yogurt like this!  My husband loved this salad, and he usually doesn't get too excited about fruit.  I will definitely continue making this.

This was a quick and delicious recipe.  I used two Granny Smith and one Red Delicious apple which made it colorful.  I took another's advice and added a squeeze of honey and some lime juice which just kicked it up another notch.  So simple but we loved it.

Great recipe and very easy to make.  I added fresh strawberries which tastes great!  I would recommend only using three apples or add more yogurt if using more than three apples.

Four and a half stars, but not quite five. Really cool concept. Simple, fun and kid-friendly, but needed something more. I meant to toast the almonds as one review suggested, but ran out of time. I will try this again and tweak it into a five star. Thanks for sharing.

Amazing.  My roommates and I gobbled this up.  They don't have dried cherries or sliced almonds in Prague, so I used whole almonds and omitted the cherries.  Adding honey, lemon, and cinnamon to the yogurt dressing really kicked it up a notch!

Good salad as is but can be jazzed up more for company/potluck.  One reviewer said something about caramel yogurt, so I added a nice spoon full of caramel icecream topping--yum, yum.  I used rather small apples and had just enough yogurt to cover.  So if using large apples, you may want to use two containers of yogurt.  I knew I would have leftovers and hoped the yogurt would keep them from browning. The next day the apples were still perfect.

SUPER EASY! And tasty.I have upped the amount for a couple different potlucks.  Always a HUGE hit.  Especially for the college meal that my church did.  
Great for those last minute potluck.  The last time I made it (doubled), the apples were crazy expensive so I did 4 apples and 4 pears.  Also did one container of vanilla and one container of caramel.

Very good salad.  I used two Granny Smith apples and two Gala apples, and I tossed them with some lemon juice before adding the other ingredients.  I used pecans in addition to the almonds, and did not have cherries so only used dried cranberries.  Will definitely make again.

I used 2 Granny Smith & 2 Braeburn apples.  I made this ahead of dinnertime, so sprinkled the apples with 2T fresh lemon juice to keep them from browning.  I only had plain Greek yogurt so added 2T honey & 1T vanilla to sweeten and flavor it.  I toasted the almonds and topped the salad with a very light sprinkling of a spice called mace, which is part of the nutmeg seed; it has a wonderful fragrance and flavor; a little bit goes a long way!  This is a delicious fruit salad.  Thank you so much, Rachel!

Nice salad! I didn't use the dried cherries, I put fresh blueberries instead. Next time I might try using walnuts instead of almonds. I enjoyed it.

Very good, but tart.  Could try regular red apples or a sweeter kind.  Kids of course don't like the slivered almonds.  Cherry craisins are yummy!

did not care for this at all, I was excited to try it but very disappointed. Others at the dinner enjoyed it I thought it had a funny after taste. Maybe it was the cranberries, guess I would try fresh fruit next time.

Pretty tasty. I thought it needed to be a little sweeter, so I added some cinnamon and Splenda. I still prefer Cranberry Waldorf salad from this site, but this one is a close second.

So simple and very yummy! I did as others suggested and added half yogurt, half vanilla pudding.  I'm not a big fan of cranberries but they were good in this.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a great recipe! I took some liberties based on what I had. Gala apples, sunflower seeds and fresh blueberries. Sprinkled with cinnamon. Kids thought we were having dessert after lunch!

It was okay.  Add cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg, though, to make the flavors much more interesting.

Quick basic recipe. I did add about a TBS of lemon juice to help keep the apples from turning brown. Turned out great.

This was a good recipe for being healthy.  My concern when I made the salad was that the apples would brown too quickly, so I made the salad an hour before serving and the apples were okay.

Such a delicious refreshing salad.   I used Pink Lady apples fresh from the orchard.  Used walnuts rather than almonds b/c I had them and prefer them.  Omitted cherries and added celery.  I've had 3 huge bowls full in the past two days and my kids constantly beg for more.  Forget those fruit salads that call for cream cheese, mayo, or added sugar... this one is the way to go.  YUM!

This recipe was OK, especially considering how quick it was to throw together. It was somewhat bland. It tasted good but had no zing. I might try a couple of different combos to make it tastier, like lemon or flavored yogurt..

This was very good. The vanilla yogurt really helped to tame the tartness of the granny smith apples I used. Loved the cranberries and cherries, too - but the delicious toasted almonds is what made the dish something special.

I followed the recipe and I was pleasantly surprised!  I used 1 honey crisp and 2 macontash and it was just perfect.  I only used 3 apples because they were pretty large in size. The almonds really add to the flavor! I will make this again.  I didn't find that it lacked in flavor, however I've set a side a small portion and used strawberry yogurt (it makes it look more dessert like), other than that I preferred the original recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times in the past 6 months. For a Boy Scout covered dish dinner, and for my own birthday lunch. I used Granny Smith apples and pecans, dried cranberries, cherries, blueberries, and vanilla yogurt. I love it, very refreshing and healthy.

I don't like yogurt. But this sounded good. So, I replaced half the yogurt with fat free, sugar free vanilla pudding. I love this salad. It is very easy to make too. I also used chopped pecans in addition to the almonds.

This was good!  I used 1 Honeycrisp apple and two small mystery apples (I think they were McIntosh, maybe) but left everything else the same.  I did sprinkle the cut apples with lemon juice, to prevent browning, because I knew there'd be leftovers.  Mine was a little sweet, probably because my apples were sweet, not tart.  I used Nancy's non-fat vanilla yogurt, which isn't overly sweetened like some.  Great healthy recipe!  I loved the dried cherries and cranberries in this!

We loved this! And what an appropriate name...  this TASTES like autumn. I cut the recipe in half, used one granny smith & one gala apple & took CHAKAMUFFIN's suggestion to add a bit of lemon juice & honey (I added about 2 tbp). Good call! Also my yogurt wasn't vanilla (much easier to add the vanilla for a recipe that calls for it than it is to take it out for one that doesn't ;o) ) so I added a tsp. of vanilla. I didn't bother to chop my cherries & I forgot to blanch my almonds. This was a wonderful fruit salad...thanks Rachel! I can't wait til my friends try it!

Simple prep. I revised just because of what I had on hand. Used two colors apples from orchard. Used raisins instead of dried cherries.   Plumped raisins and cranberries. That was great. I should have used tarter apples or added a bit lemon juice. But many at the church potluck loved it as is. I will def make again and again.

Absolutely loved this and will make it again! I did alter to what I had on hand: chopped walnuts instead of almonds, plain Greek yogurt used with pure vanilla and Splenda to sweeten, no cherries, used 1 Granny Smith and 3 Fuji apples and a little cool whip. I made this for an Autumn picnic and everyone loved it!

Used Johnathan apples, dried cranberries, raisins  and dried dates.  Used apple corer and then cut into bite size pieces.  I just took another reviewer suggestion and used a splash of lemon juice on apples to keep them fresh.  Made this 1 1/2 hrs ahead and this was perfect!   It was even fresh  the next night.  This is a fast easy salad and the receipe for 6 (adjusted) was perfect amount for dinner and leftovers.

Great recipe!  Thought using all Granny Smith apples would be too tart, so I added some Fuji and red delicious.  I added both red and green seedless grapes, and used vanilla Greek yogurt. Unfortunately, didn't have any almonds, but I will add next time.  I think sprinkling toasted coconut on each serving would also be terrific!  Thanks for sharing.

I love this! I make it every fall now. I do use plain yogurt and add some honey and vanilla to it for a healthier version without refined sugar instead of store bought vanilla yogurt. Toasting the almonds is KEY and makes the flavor a lot better. I can't wait to make it again this week!

I loved this! What a perfect blend of tastes! I didn't have any almond slivers, so I used pine nuts instead.  The almonds would have made it even better.  I also used Vanilla Greek Yogurt instead of regular yogurt.  Very tasty!

I make something similar for a fall celebration or  other buffet situation that I've catered, this is very similar. Various apples and pears, red and green grapes, dried fruits, honey Greek yogurt and ginger, either ground, candied or syrup (simmer fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced or chopped in simple syrup for about 45 minutes to an hour and you have both. Just dry the ginger and toss with more sugar)
Doesn't really need lemon juice but could add for that flavor. Just dilute it a bit in water, and toss the apples and or pears in before adding  the rest. 
I didn't use nuts but toasting them would be a nice touch. 
I didn't use lemon and it still kept for a few days in the fridge.

Delicious. Made it as per recipe, except for leaving almonds out. Since we were having almonds in another dish, just didn't want to overdo. I'm sure they would add a great crunch, especially if toasted. I liked this so well, I made it again the next day to  take in lunches.

I loved it. I didn't have time to roast the almonds, but was still great. One of my kids said it was to tart so maybe next time I'll mix it up w/some others too. 
So easy- made in 10mins

So very easy to make.  It tasted great.  It was a different salad to serve instead of a green salad.  I served it as a first course before Thanksgiving dinner.  I put it in cute little berry bowls.  It was a hit.  Apparently my brother raved about this after Thanksgiving.  He is a man of few words so this was a really really big compliment.  It was a great substitute for a green salad which get sort of run of the mill after a while.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! I did make a few changes: I didn't add as much yogurt as this called for, since I didn't want the fruit and almonds swimming. I added a little over half of what it called for. I also added lemon zest and cardamom for a hint of earthy citrus flavor. It was the cardamom paired with the vanilla and apple flavors that made it so yummy. I had several people tell me it was a refreshing and delicious change from the usual Thanksgiving jello salad. Very tasty recipe, so easy, and fun to experiment with. Thank you!

This is a healthy, quick and easy salad to make!  I doubled it for a potluck and whisked grated orange peel and about 2 Tbl of 100% orange juice to the yogurt before coating the apples.  It adds the perfect holiday flavor!  Like others, I also toasted the nuts and added them just before serving.

We really like this.  It is much better than the waldorf salad Mama used to make which was drenched in mayo or even worse Miracle Whip.  I made it just as written except did drizzle the apples with freshly squeezed lemon juice just to keep them from browning.  Everyone ate it well, and there will be leftovers tomorrow for Mama's lunch.

Nice, simple, apple salad that takes less than 10 minutes to fix - start to finish.  Cheryl's Cooking Now! suggested this recipe, and I'm glad she did.  My DH and I really enjoyed the light taste of the vanilla yogurt.  I added the almonds at serving time because I knew we would not finish the entire dish and I wanted them to stay crunchy.  This dish went well with 'Pork Lo Mein' another AR recipe.

I loved it! I personally do not like cranberries or cherries. Every year at thanksgiving, I try to find a fruit salad in exchange for the normal cranberry sauce. I traded the cranberries for raisins and I exchnaged the cherries for purple and green grapes. It was very vibrant and pretty.

Not quite a wow, but really great for something simple and healthy. Hardly any more work than slicing an apple and a nice addition when we eat a lot of them in the fall.

Very good salad. I added diced celery. Omitted the cherries, but added raisins instead. Next time, I will add pecans instead of almonds (although they were good). I used low fat, low carb yogurt, and it was a success with my health conscious man.

This was just okay for me and my family.  I made it for a family get together and it was the only thing I had leftover.  None of the guest wanted any to take home.  I will not make this again.

Looking for an alternative to everyday salads I tried it, my husband went crazy for it.. From now on dried cherries, cranberries and almonds are on my shelf. ready to be tossed together.. Since I could only get 6oz. vanilla yogurt I added some non-fat vanilla yogurt with it.. Didn't hurt it a bit..

Very, very tart.  Good mix of flavors however, with the cranberries etc.  Next time I will either do half/half sweeter apples with the tart, or add vanilla pudding to take away a little bit of the pucker.  I thought the review of lemon juice and honey may be worth a try as well.

I LOVE this salad!!! I've made it a half dozen times to take to family gatherings and parties and it's always a big hit.  I like to keep all the ingredients on hand  to make single servings just for me.   

I recommend chilling the apples and preparing it just before serving, once made it's only good for about 24 hours. Also I like it better without the dried cherries.  Just double the dried cranberries and enjoy.
