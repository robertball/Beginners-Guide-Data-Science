What a refreshing treat after a long week at work! I splurged and had two. The first was on the rocks and then for the second I went with sparkling version and used club soda. Both were equally good so it really just depends on what you are in the mood for. My husband and I both loved the flavor combo and this is one I will make often this summer. Thanks for sharing!
