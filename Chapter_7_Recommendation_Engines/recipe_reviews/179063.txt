Made as directed except: used a can of diced tomatoes, store bought polenta and I used Venison Italian sausage [was looking for a way to use up a 'gift']. WOW!! I can't count the times my husband complimented this dush while eating it! Leftovers even better! Not spicy, but full of rich flavor.

This was my first time with polenta and fennel. I initially messed up the polenta to water/broth ratio, but it was an easy fix and came out well. The dish was great as a whole, but I would probably use something in place of the fennel next time - just a personal preference. The roasted peppers and tomatoes with the sausage were amazing!

I thought this recipe was great! Since I was really looking for a way to cook up Italian Sausage I had on hand, I altered the veggies a little - I used a regular tomato, cut, onions, carrots and radish instead of fennel and red peppers but even with the alterations, the juices and the way it all came together was great. I'd love to try it some time with the fennel and peppers, we love finding ways to cook up veggies so our four-year-old will think they're "cool" and this recipe did it! I only went with four stars because I don't quite feel right giving five stars when I didn't cook it the way the recipe is.

Yum! A new way to prepare one of our family's favorites, Italian sausage. I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

This was a pretty easy meal, and it tasted great too. This is only the second time my wife or I had fennel (the first we had it caramelized with onion, and the flavor practically disappeared), and we're big fans now. I think two bulbs would be overkill (maybe the fennel in Italy is smaller than that in the US), so we only used one bulb of fennel. As much as we try, we're just not big fans of polenta. Next time I'll probably add a bit of white wine and cornstarch to thicken the juices and serve with penne, although a risotto would work pretty well with this too.

My gosh, this is amazing!  The flavor is wonderful!  I used turkey Italian sausage to make is even more healthier and ate it as a soup.  Loved it!

We really liked this dish-it was quick and easy, but had lots of flavor.  I served mine over polenta-my husband does not like polenta so he ate it over rice and he enjoyed it.

Great taste-nutritious- easy...
 what more can you ask for? I used hot italian sausage and removed casing and also tossed all in a little olive oil before baking- I also served with couscous instead of polenta. Just a delicious recipe but do not leave the fennel out-- this makes the dish!

We love it. I use red and green peppers and onions plus use a can of diced tomatoes just because it's easier but the compliments on this dish are a complete rave. Fixing it for a 2nd time tonight. Don't use the polenta because the picky eaters in my family find that a bit much but with or without this deserves five stars. Thank you/

What a great recipe! I made the basic cheese polenta the night before (from a recipe on here) and then put all of the ingredients in my slow cooker before I left for church. It was so simple! I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I never had polenta before but I'm a huge fan now!

Wonderful and easy! I skipped the fennel and added onion wedges and quartered mushrooms. I let it roast about 5 minutes more for the peppers. For my polenta, I do cornmeal, fat free chicken broth, and 2% milk for a creamy polenta

This was great!  I roasted everything in a Dutch oven and after roasting cooked it on the stove so that the sauce would thicken a little more.  At the very end I added a little cornstarch mixed into some white wine, as one reviewer suggested, and it made the sauce silky smooth and delicious!

So I thought I really wouldn't like this recipe very much cuse i don't like cooked tomatoes very much, but i decided to give it a try cause i had most of the ingredients to make it. It's very yummy. It's fast to make and simple. I will be making it again.
