I didn't change a thing.  Quite delicious and very easy to make.  I love how crispy they were on the outside with the ooey gooey yummy center.  The pan I warmed the tortillas in was already heated to medium so when I was done with that, I put the oil in to "sear" the tortillas and it was too hot I guess and I almost burned them.  So uhm don't do that haha

This is more of a review of the process rather than the recipe, as I used a different filling. However, I made these tonight, and they were great! 

I sautéed the peppers and onions as directed, and then instead of using chicken I used ground venison and seasoned it to taste. I followed the video and let the mixture cool and added the cheese before heating the tortillas and filling them. I, apparently, did not let my pan heat up enough before warming the tortillas as the later ones were easier to wrap than the first ones. Using egg white to seal the tortillas really helped! 

I was concerned that the filling would not be warm in just 12-15 minutes, since I baked them several hours after I made the filling. However, that did not seem to be a problem, and they were warm all the way through.

I wrapped a few of the leftover chimis and stuck them in the freezer. I am excited to have a quick, yummy meal waiting for me next time I need it!

I created a different variation of this dish many years ago. This recipe is great for flavor, although I feel that there are few mistakes or shall I say time consuming steps in this process of preparing. I like to use chicken tenderloins because they cook faster. I broil the chicken until fully cooked as I am sautéing whatever veggies I choose to use or have on hand. After everything is fully cooked and cool enough to handle, I shred the chicken in a bowl and mix all of my ingredients together as well as my cheese and a homemade version of salsa. The salsa and cheese bind all of the ingredients together. I stuff and roll the tortillas and shallow pan fry in oil until crispy and done. This cuts out the need to bake and you get to enjoy a little sooner!

These chimichangas are fantastic! They taste as good or better than restaurant ones without the deep frying. My husband loved them and wants me to make them regularly. Make sure you brush the tortillas with egg white or they'll come apart. I served them with Chef John's Spicy Spanish style rice which was also very good.

Awesome!  Just one problem...it says the recipe serves 4 so I was planning on a meal of leftovers for my hubby and me!  I ate one...he ate 3!  No leftovers!  Plan to serve this again and try shrimp in place of chicken.  Has anyone tried freezing this?  If so, bake from frozen state? Thaw first?  How much extra baking time?

We had this tonight for Cinco de Mayo.  Although it's not an authentic Mexican dish, we enjoyed it very much.  The chimichangas were crispy and not fried!  I will make this again in the future.  I made it exactly as written with no substitutions.

My family loved this. I'll definitely make these again.  I made them nearly the same as the recipe stated.  Instead of putting them in the oven, I let them stay longer in the skillet.  This was a mistake.  They got a little too tough - hard to cut through with a fork.  Putting them in the oven would have been better.  Thank you Chef John, for another fantastic recipe!

Delicious. Make sure you double the recipe because there will not be enough for everyone unless you do. Also don't be afraid to substitute smokey paprika for the chipotle, and Colby jack cheese for the pepper jack cheese and omit the cayenne pepper to make a kid friendly version.

These were awesome. I might have had a little more chicken than it called for because I got five out of it.  To heat up the leftovers, I just popped them in my NuWave convection oven for about 10 minutes. It reheats them and crisps them back up without burning them. They lose the crispiness when kept as leftovers, so it's nice to have a way to get it back. I bought extra tortillas because I plan to try the same thing with smoked, pulled pork that I have in the freezer from an earlier smoking.

I've made this a few times now and LOVE IT! I like the idea of using venison as the other reviewer tried but for now it's my 1 Sunday per month favorite. I use roasted bell peppers and olive oil but easily becoming one of my faves

I made this for one of our first hearty meals of the fall and it was delicious!!  I made it exactly according to the recipe as I always do when making something for the first time and wouldn't change a thing next time.  

Chef John says this is not a Mexican dish but where I was raised in Southern California it would sure pass for one. Mexican food does sometimes have mushrooms. I did top them with all the suggested options and they made it exceptionally good. 

My mushrooms got a little chopped up as they cooked, rather than staying sliced, but that only enhanced the flavor of the filling.  I did fudge on one thing. I could not find Mexican Oregano in any of the stores I went to and since it was just a pinch I added regular.  Really didn't notice it or any difference since I am not familiar with Mexican Oregano. 
 
Really liked that it was browned and not fried. It certainly didn't need to be. 

Keep up the good work Chef.  I have yet to find one of your recipes that I don't like. My husband, who is a tough critic raved about this one.

This was SO good! I did everything exactly as written only I had to use a Colby/Monterrey Jack blend in place of the pepper jack, because it was all I had on hand. These were surprisingly easy to make, and soo yummy. Thanks Chef John!

These were terrific, and it was a perfect way to use up half a rotisserie chicken!  I used an Anaheim pepper because nobody had poblanos.  Also, couldn't find Mexican oregano, so I substituted marjoram.  Finally, a 1/2 cup of sliced fresh mushrooms seemed kinda skimpy, so I used half a 4-ounce package, or about 3/4 cup of the sliced mushrooms; next time I'll use the whole package because they shrink a lot when they release their moisture (and I love mushrooms).  Well done, John!

All I need to tell my husband when he asks what's for dinner is "It's a Chef John recipe". He doesn't even ask anymore  he just knows whatever it is, it will be fantastic. This is another winner!

I did not care for this recipe the first time I made it, I think I added too many mushrooms.  Since then I have made it several times, and it has become a family favorite.  I double the recipe and get 8 chimichangas and freeze any leftovers, they make a nice grab and go meal when in a hurry.  The only change I made to the recipe is I smother the top of the chimi's with green chili sauce.  Be sure to brush the tortilla's with the egg white's as this really holds the chimi's together nicely.  I really like the browning step before baking, as this helps to achieve that nice crispy golden exterior. These are delicious, and definitely worth the effort.  They also get easier to make each time you make them.

Made these last night - excellent!  And surprisingly easy to do!  The only thing I did differently was to cook my chicken ahead of time - shredded it and then added to the cooked veggies.  Also I could not find Mexican oregano so used regular and it was fine!

We loved the chimichangas! My wife especially liked that the chimies were not deep fried. The flavor was just right, not too spicy. Thanks for the tip to use egg white as a sealer; I had never tried,that before. ThIs one is a keeper!

I tried the tonight and was very pleased! I followed the recipe except that I did not add the chipole ground pepper because my husband has trouble eating spicy foods.  I would have used poblano peppers but the super market was out of it.  I ended up using fresh green peppers instead.  It was still delicious!!!

We loved these. I used chicken thigh instead of breast and added it a little earlier in the veggie sauté process since they can cook longer than the breasts.  Used half an onion and half a green pepper and eyeballed the mushrooms.  Super easy and flexible.  Really really good. Thanks!

I have never posted a review before, but this was so delicious I just had to. My picky husband even loved it. Didn't have grated pepper jack so I added mexican cheese blend to the mix and then topped with 2 thin slices of pepper jack when putting it in the tortilla. Also added cilantro to the saute part just cause I love cilantro. Again, this was fantastic!!

I did not have one complaint with these.  I made the recipe as is except I could not find 'Mexican Oregano' so I subbed for regular Oregano instead and only topping mine with sour cream (which pairs amazing with the flavors  that come from the filling).  One thing that that I did differently was shred the chicken a little so the pieces weren't as large.  My father did have a complaint that the pieces should have been put through the food processor.  All went well in the end though and I paired them with oven roasted russet potatoes, Lima beans, and cornbread.

Fantastic. I love that they are slightly fried. Less grease and they come out of the oven crispy. Great video, thanks John, mine turned out better the restaurants!

wonderful taste and texture. We didn't use the cheese due to dietary restrictions, and it was still wonderful. They reheated well the next day, too.

Perfect -- whole family loved them! I love Chef John! I found the video very helpful... and it helped me to not shy away from adding more salt and pepper than I otherwise would have. 
Thank-you thank-you thank-you!

This recipe was delicious. It wasn't the healthiest, but my family and I rally enjoyed it. I will definitely be making this again, but maybe only baking instead of frying.

I like the idea of making and freezing a great lunch item for later.  I used wild black trumpet mushrooms that I had harvested this summer (dried then reconstituted so added them toward the end of the first sauté) and my garden's poblano peppers. After frying just one, I felt it needed more cheese so I added some and (personal preference) thought it was better. I had forgotten the cayenne so the extra pepperjack cheese did not make it too hot, but that is  point to consider if going big on the pepperjack.  I kept the filling in the frige overnight and then warmed just the filling in the microwave while I softened the tortilla, and so I didn't need to bake it after frying the assembled chimi.   I didn't use the condiments, as I wanted the mushrooms to shine and I still found that these are really yummy.  I will post again once I try them out of the freezer.

These came out great. I used a small poblano  and a couple serrano peppers for a little more kick. Delicious! Served with Spanish rice and black beans.

These are the first chimichangas that I have enjoyed.  The flavor is wonderful and easy to prepare.  Do make double the recipe!  Chef John, very good, as usual.

Amazing! I left out the ground chipotle, but followed the recipe exactly other than that. I only ended up with three chimichangas - maybe I used extra large tortillas or just put too much stuffing in. Delicious and filling either way.

I loved this recipe & video by Chef John. The only changes I made were to use Green Peppers instead of Poblano and using Sargento Cheddar Jack Shredded Cheese (Unfortunately, my stomach can't handle spicy foods).

we really liked this recipe.  we like spicy foods but next time I'll separate a portion and not add the poblano peppers and chipotle. Mom is 98 and doesn't like so much spice.

This is the 2nd time I have made these and they are amazing! I made mine a bit differently, using leftover chicken (mixture of dark and white meat), added some adobo and chopped bell peppers instead of the others (because I didn't have them). I keep kosher, so I used Daiya pepper jack cheese shreds and Tofutti sour cream.

I made these tonight for dinner. They were very good, but much more labor intensive than I had anticipated. I could not find Mexican oregeno so Ijust used regular oregano, I did not notice a difference.
