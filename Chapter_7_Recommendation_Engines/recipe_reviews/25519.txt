I made this as an appetizer for a friend's gathering, but no one ever had a chance to try them.  After tasting the first one, my husband told me I couldn't take them to the party.  He sat down and ate the WHOLE tray, and I am not kidding.

Great idea for an appetizer. The only thing I changed was that I cut the bacon into thirds instead of halves so that they'd be more "bite-size". I also added lemon juice, and old bay to the crab meat and I cut some jalapeno peppers into skinny slivers and rolled them up with the crab meat to add a little extra bite. Aside from the duck sauce I also provided some Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce for a tasty, hot kick. There were NO leftovers.

I made this recipe for a party this past weekend and it was a huge hit!! I premade the crab rolls and put them in the fridge until right before the party, popped them in the broiler for 10 minutes and then wa-la! Very easy to prepare, easy to cook & easy to enjoy!

I love crab and I agree this sounded so good but I made it today and both my husband and I thought it lack something.  I followed the recipe and it was tasteless. I tried placing them on toasted baguettes rounds with duck sauce.Then I tried mixing the crab with cream cheese and some beau monde but it too was bland. Perhaps it was the crab itself.  I used non refrigerated canned. (The kind in the tuna section.) The next time I will try fresh crab.

these are good and Simple to make. I will not broil them next time as the crab gets to dark no matter how much you watch and flip them. great for a quick seafood appetizer.

I was so excited to try this recipe for a party I have coming up. I wanted to try it out before hand so I made them for my husband. He really liked them, I however did not. Maybe because of all the great reviews I had my hopes up higher than I should have. I personally was let down. My husband thinks they will go over well, but I thought they were disappointing. I love crab and bacon both so I was craving these ever since I came across the recipe. Now I don't think I will make them. I will say it's hard not to keep eating them, despite the taste.

This recipe is sooo yummy, my boyfriend ate about 20 of them before I told him he couldn't have anymore!  The only thing I didn't like was when the bacon was cooking in the oven, it got really really smoky in my apartment to the point where I teared up.  So have a fan ready!

I made this recipe for my mother's birthday, and it went over very well.  There were leftovers, but my sister claimed them.

My hubby and I really liked these. Easy to assemble. I used the Chicken of the Sea Crabmeat in the 8oz can because it's what I found at the store. Laid all my cut pieces of bacon out and measured the meat out evenly...just to make sure I had enough to go around. I did have to cook mine a little longer to ensure even-ness because the bacon just wasn't getting cooked at 10 minutes on broil, took about 17-18 minutes total. Other then that, they were tasty little morsels.

Ok I am doing what I really hate for anyone to do, I have not actually tried this recipe. I was looking for a recipe that I have lost but have made since the early 1970's. The one I was looking for is very similar and crazy tasty. The one I used,  used the imitation crab and also small shrimp, lemon juice, 1 egg, some BBQ sauce and seasoned bread crumbs shaped into a roll and wrapped in bacon and broiled. I serve it with home made cocktail sauce. Any variation of these ingredients make a wonderful appetizer!

Delicious! I actually had to use shredded, canned crab (which sounds impossible) and it still came out beautifully! The family is pestering me to make it again.
