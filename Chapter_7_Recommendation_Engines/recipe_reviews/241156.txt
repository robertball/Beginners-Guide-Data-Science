Made exactly as written and this turned out great! I was tempted to not soften the onions before adding to the slow cooker but I'm sure glad I did. The caramelized onions added another depth of flavor. Can't wait to eat the leftovers during the football game tonight!

Super Bowl dip hit. I chose it because the recipe is so simple, and I'm glad I did.

This brings back memories.   We used to make this on Christmas Eve when my boys were just little ones.   Everyone loved it.   Haven't made it in probably 40 years.   I'll have to try it again on our next get together.

Nade it exactly as the recipe calls for, and it turned out great! The only thing I might do next time is just add some of my own 80/20 ground beef, but i love beef, so just what I would want to do next time. Thanks for the recipe!

OMG!!!!! This is to die for! So rich and creamy. It was a big hit for my Superbowl party. 
You won't regret making this one.

Made it because as you said it was quick to put together !  Made as written except only added only 1 Tbsp of jalapeno.  It was a hit at SuperBowl party and that 's all i wanted !
