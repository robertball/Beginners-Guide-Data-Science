I've been making this recipe for a few years now. It's even easier if you have a bread maker. Just throw all of the ingredients into the bread maker, making sure to slightly beat the egg first. Run it on the dough cycle. Once that's complete, follow the rest of the recipe from step 3.

Great recipe!
I have started a baking/cooking business and I made these to go with shredded bbq beef for sandwiches.
After a few trys I got them exactly how I wanted them and they get rave reviews from the members of the social club I cook for.
After the dough is mixed and kneaded I do let it rise in a greased, covered bowl for about an hour. Punch it down and turn it out and cut it into 8 pieces. I form them into balls and put on the greased sheet and flatten. Cover them with a light dish towel and let rise again about another hour. After this rising I brush some egg white on 4 of them and sprinkle with sesame seeds then bake as directed.
I make onion rolls from this too. I just add 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion and 1/2 Teaspoon onion salt (decrease regular salt to 1 Teaspoon)to the flour mix (before the milk and eggs are added) and after the second rising I bursh egg white on them and sprinkle more dried minced onion on top and bake. The onion rolls in particular are fabulous with the shredded beef sandwiches!

Instant yeast conversion: 1 package instant yeast is about 1 Tablespoon; to substitute regular dry yeast use 1 tbsp + 1 tsp (4 tsp total).  Let it proof before adding to recipe, and use 2 rises. 

If using quick-rise yeast, use the same amount (4 tsp), add it directly with the flour, but omit the first rise; instead let it rest for 10 min.

I substituted 1 cup of white flour with: 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup oat bran, and 1/4 cup flax meal.  I also used sucanat (raw sugar) instead of white.  Gives a very different flavour and it's a bit heavy, but still very yummy and better than store-bought!

These are SO soft and SO fluffy! ***TIP:*** after kneading dough just plop all of it in a greased bowl, cover and let rise for an hour in a cool oven (don't turn the oven on). The yeast creates heat and placing it in the enclosed oven keeps it warm and it will rise fuller and faster. Then take it out, punch it down and shape them however you want (They make great rolls too) in a pan or on a cookie sheet. Cover them and place them back in the cool oven to rise another hour. Take them out, uncover them, brush with melted butter or an egg wash, and turn the oven on and let it preheat. Bake as the directions state. This bread is the softest most delicious bread I have ever tasted.

Also: I just threw my butter, water and milk in a bowl and put it in the microwave for a minute. If the mixture is really warm, but not too warm where you can place your finger in it and not burn yourself, it is the perfect temp. If the mixture gets too hot it will kill off the yeast and leave you with dense bread.
***1 packet of instant yeast is aprox. 1 tablespoon. I have a large package of yeast and do not use the little packets. So if you aren't using the packets either, just use a tablespoon full.

Excellent. I used my bread machine dough cycle and they came out perfect. I let the dough rise for an hour before shaping the buns. Then I let the buns rise for 35 minutes. The best!!

Overall this recipe was good, not as good as some of the reviews I read prior to making them though.  The rolls were a little heavier then I was originally looking for.  I did find as other reviews stated you need to let them raise allot longer then the recipe said, I let mine raise 2 hours.  I made 12 hamburger buns, but they weren't as big as I really like. Next time would only make 9 to get the size I really want.

These were easy to make, but a little on the dense side. I would try the recipe again with a little more yeast.

Okay, I admit, it could have been me, but these turned out really bad. It made 8 hamburger buns that were flat and dense. I was so excited to find this recipe but I guess I will have to keep searching for a good one. :0( Sorry.

These are so delicious! I just put everything in my bread machine on the dough cycle and followed the rest of the recipe.  My husband loves them and is requesting them all the time!  They are so much better than store bought and taste like they are from a fancy burger joint.  I don't think we will ever buy store bought buns again!  Yum!

no rating... but would like to respond to the gal whose buns turned out very heavy...my brother-in-law is a baker and he said that when this happens, it is usually because we have used too much shortening or oil...I have tested his observation and found it to be true!!! I have had such light fluffy bread since cutting back on the shortening, that I now use half of the measurement that the recipe calls for.... Hope that helps y'all out.

Great recipe.  We made these as burger and hotdog buns.  The texture was great.  We used shortening in place of the butter.  Turned out beautifully.  SO much better for the wallet than buying store bought too!

Oh my gosh, I felt like a professional baker!!! My husband even took a picture of them!  I halved the recipe then used my bread machine to mix everything.  I put 1 C of flour with the salt, sugar & yeast (I used 3/4 t of regular yeast) in the pan then started the machine. After it mixed for a couple seconds I poured in the milk mixture then half a beaten egg.  I then finished slowly pouring the flour in & let the machine take over from there. I rolled them up exactly like the directions said, then covered them with saran wrap (lightly sprayed with cooking spray)and put them in the oven until they raised to the size I wanted. Baked them and "wa-laa", perfection!  Thanks for a great recipe, I wish I could give it 10 stars!

I halved this recipe to make 6 and they turned out delightfully. I am the worst at breadbaking, most of my baking comes out heavy and leaden but these are light, fluffy, and HUGE. I didn't knead, just used a Kitchen Aid with dough hook for 8 minutes and gave it a 15-minute rise time. Yummy!

These got rave reviews from my kids and hubby!!  I followed recipe to a T and used my bread machine.  I got very confused about how much yeast to add, so I followed bread machine instructions and used 2 1/4 tsp.  Turned out perfect!!
I made small mini burger buns and large, "man" size buns and found that the larger ones needed about 2 more mins. to bake.  Highly recommend these soft fluffy buns!!

This recipe is SO simple!  I had made it before for hamburger buns and it was a success.  Last night I made hoagie buns for steak sandwiches-AWESOME!  The only thing different I did was use buttermilk instead of regular milk-I had it and wanted to see what it tasted like-DELICIOUS!  I used my dough hook on my Kitchen Aid mixer and I honestly didn't do more than 2 minutes of actual hand kneading.  This is a great recipe and It'll used from here on out!  I'm going to try it for breadsticks, next!  Thanks!

I only gave them a 4 because I think it is a great base recipe for buns. I seasoned mine up a bit because I can't just have a plane jane bread. I added garlic powder, onion powder and Italian seasoning. You could easily make these into onion or cheese buns !

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if even though my yeast was new it was not good, but these didn't rise at all for me.  They smell delicious but weigh a ton.  Perhaps I can throw them at husband if he doesn't behave, LOL.  Thanks for sharing, I'll try these again and if it works out I'll update my rating.

Nice recipe! I made one batch of Hamburger buns and a batch of hot dog buns. The hamburger buns were "prettier" than the hot dog buns but all tasted good! Will make them again! ***UPDATE*** I made this recipe again today. I needed hoagie rolls to put BBQ beef on. I just dropped the risen dough out of the bowl on to the floured bread board and just lightly flattened it out and left it in it's round shape. I cut it into 8 pieces like cutting a pie. I rolled up each "wedge" from the small end to the big end, and at the same time was pulling tension on the doughs surface. I let these roll up sit and rest for about 5 minutes and then rolled them out the length I wanted (about 9") I covered them with plastic wrap sprayed with Pam and let them proof about a half hour. Brushed them with an egg was and sprinkled sesame seeds on top and then made 4 diagonal slashes on each bun. Baked on a stone at 375* for about 12 minutes. 16 buns (double batch) and 7 adults for dinner, only 4 buns left over! Very good sandwich rolls!  Sorry for the long review, but  they were good!!

This is the best hamburger bun recipe I have found, but then again it is the only one I have found.  I give it a medium rating, because it is definitely lighter than regular bread, but still a little dense.  The hamburger buns do not rise very much.  I would try letting them rise for an hour.  I made this recipe both by hand and with the bread machine.  The hot dog buns did rise more than the hamburger shape.  I found the quantity accurate (six hamburger and eight hot dog out of one recipe.)

I have tried several recipes for hamburger buns, since I started using a bread machine 5 years ago. This is the very first that my husband really, really liked.  All others have been too dense.  Thanks for a recipe that I plan to use a lot!

You can't go wrong! These buns are delicious, easy, and FAST! I follow the recipe exactly, except for these changes: 3 cups of whole wheat flour (1 1/2 cups of white flour), honey instead of sugar, and coconut oil instead of butter. I mix and knead by hand, roll out the dough to about 1/2 inch thickness, then cut to the desired size of hamburger bun. (I make them smaller than the store-bought buns because who really NEEDS all of that bread?!) I let them rise 30+ minutes on a greased cookie sheet and then bake as directed. They have always turned out PERFECT ... rave reviews all around! We use them for pulled pork, hamburgers, tuna, lunch meat sandwiches, and even peanut butter and jelly! They are healthier, cheaper, and a million times more delicious than anything you'll buy in the store!

Great, fast and easy! I have made this recipe 4 times already. Followed the recipe exactly, except adding extra ½ cup of flour. I calculated the cost; .12 a bun.

This is the best burger bun recipe I've tried! I did let them rise almost 2 hours because I was gone, they were a nice size (I made 12) and stayed soft when I finished the last one 4 days later. They did have a slight buscuit-y taste/texture, but not a bad thing! Thanks!

I didn't use instant yeast, so I proofed it first in the warm water in one bowl, and melted the butter and milk together in a small sauce pot then removed from heat to cool slightly.  I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour.  I mixed together the flour, sugar and salt, then mixed in the milk/butter mixture, then the yeast/water, and lastly the egg.

I kneaded the dough for approx 5 mins, then placed in a lightly oiled bowl, covered with a warm, damp cloth and allowed to rise in a warm place for about an hour.  Punched it down, and allowed it to rise again for another hour.  Punched it down, seperated it into rolls, and flattened slightly on a lightly greased baking sheet, then covered with the cloth and allowed it to rise slightly for another 20 mins or so.

They only took me 10 mins to bake and they were delicious.

I am a vegan, so I used soy milk, Earth Balance buttery sticks, cane sugar and Kingsmill egg replacer, mixed per box directions, equiv to one egg.

These were great I gave them 4 stars because the recipe itself was a great starting place but I did make some changes. 
First I brought the eggs to room temp by placing them in warm water and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk so there was no heating needed. I proofed the yeast before adding the milk mixture to it and then added the flours (1 c bread, 1 c wheat, 1 1/4 c AP) to that. I used the other 1/4 c AP flour during kneading, which I did by hand. I took the advice of another reviewer and let the dough rise once (for an hour) before dividing it and then let it rise again. Half of them I flattened for buns, 3 I added oatmeal and sunflowers to (for breakfast roll), and 3 I added melted butter and garlic salt (for dinner). THEY ARE WONDERFUL! I've had one at every meal since I made them (great for making little pizzas on!) :-D (and the hubby loves them too!) Will def. make these before buying buns/rolls again. THANKS!

These buns are perfect!  I made them with half the amount of sugar and let the dough rise twice. Will always use this recipe from now on.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  Light and tasty and could definitely serve for sandwiches or on their own as rolls. I didn't go by estimated rise times - just looked at the buns and and popped them in the oven when they looked nice and big.
I have also made 24 mini-buns with these for my kids and they are always a hit.

Love these buns !!! Very good recipe, I just love the smell that this bread makes throughout my house when it's baking...yummmm! I mix all ingredients in my bread machine, then I roll the dough into balls on my baking sheet, usually one or two of them come out a little smaller than the others...LOL but I guess I just gotta practice my baking skills..lol. Thank you for this wonderful recipe! It's a keeper in my recipe book!

I've found the secret to making these great is to allow the longer rising time as suggested by others.  (One or even two hours is fine.)  I substitute 2 cups of whole wheat four for 2 cups of the white flour.  I add a tablespoon of gluten flour and let my bread machine do the kneading.  Then I shape the rolls and head off to church or take my son to a movie matinee while they rise.  If you let them rise on parchment paper, you can slide them onto a preheated baking stone without disturbing them.  Enjoy!   (Riverview, New Brunswick)

These turned out perfect after a made a few adjustments and alterations to the method. I used 4 tsp. of yeast and only 1 tsp. of salt. I also used 5 1/4 cups of flour. I also only heat the milk, water and sugar to 105 degrees not 120 as this would kill a lot of the yeast. I added the salt after the flour as salt also will kill the yeast. After I kneaded the dough, I greased it, covered it in a bowl and let it rise for 1 hour. I punched it down and then shaped it into 12 buns and baked them for 16 minutes. They turned out perfectly fluffy and not to sweet or dense. Next time I think I will add so onion or garlic powder for additional flavour.

OK, I let these rise for the 30-35 minutes mentioned in the recipe directions.  NOT RNOUGH TIME.  I figured maybe they would rise and puff up more in the oven, but they really didn't.  I was a little baffled that the directions didn't call for a first rise, then a second when shaped, like most breads...but I wanted to do it exactly as written.  Big mistake.  I should have read the reviews first, as I would have given them two 1 hour rising times.  The taste is great, it's just a shame that I ended up with small skinny hotdog buns.  Next time I'll extend the rising time twice.

Turned out really well.  The buns were a bit heavier than i would have liked so I may try letting them rise a bit more next time.  Overall they were excellent.  Will definatley make them again.

We LOVE these rolls!!  I have been using my mother in laws recipe which has to sit over night in the fridge.  These were so quick and easy.  they have a fairly dense texture and don't 'squish' when you eat 'em. Two suggestions...1)Only make ten rolls, if you make twelve they are too small for burgers and 2) When you put them on the pan to rise, flatten them out quite a bit, they really get 'poofy'!

These are excellent.  I just made them into hamburger buns and used my breadmaker.  Other than using the breadmaker I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Delicious!  Turns a simple meal into a gourmet meal.  I felt silly making homemade buns for sloppy joes, but I'm SO glad I did.  These are excellent!  I sprinkled a few sesame seeds on top before baking - cause I like 'em.

These were awesome.  I used 1 1/2c skim milk and no water and let the dough rise once before forming the rolls and they turned out perfect.

My husband REALLY likes these, and I'm a fan of anything that is not so full of chemicals! If you make the dough in the bread maker, you don't need to bother with heating the milk, and just put the egg in at the same time as the other liquids. The only thing I would suggest is make 10 buns instead of 12 to get the classic size.

Threw everything into the bread machine on the dough cycle and it came out perfectly. The dough was beautiful! I shaped them and let them rise once more before brushing with egg white and baking. Came out great!!!

tried and failed twice.  Dough didn't rise enough for the fluffy buns I expected, seemed more like a dinner roll. Taste was on point, though.  Maybe I'll try once more before giving up.

These would be totally over the top if I read some more reviews and did an initial rise prior to shaping. I let them rise for a little over 2 hrs post shaping. First time that I made hotdog buns and I must say did not turn out bad at all. The burger buns were exceptional. Painted some egg white  and added some sesame seeds on top. They were perfect and I could control the size. Some were larger than others per our preference based on the size of the burgers. Yowza these were outrageously delish! Definately worth making if you have the time. Will rise twice next time and put these right over the edge.
Thanks so much for another outstanding recipe on this site.

This is the best bread ever!!!!!!  Not just for burgers and hot dogs; but excellent for sandwiches.  We also make dinner rolls to surprise our guests.  We absolutely love them.  My husband let the dough to rise about an hour.  Then when he makes the buns, he let it rise about 20 more minutes; and then is perfect to go in the oven.

We have been making these buns for almost as long as the recipe has been here and we LOVE them ! We even use this recipe to make dinner rolls. We have adapted it to use half white and half freshly ground whole wheat flour.

These are great!! I mixed the dough in my Kitchenaid mixer.The only thing I did differently was to let the dough raise once before I shaped them, punched it down, shaped them & let them raise again. They turned out wonderful! Thanks for the recipe, Sally!

I forgot to add the egg at the right moment. I only remembered after I's already been kneading for a few minutes. I wasn't sure what to do, so I just added the egg to the dough and kneaded a bit more. I needed some extra flour on the board and my hands, but the buns turned out wonderfully! This is a super recipe. (I gave the buns an egg wash and added a sprinkling of sesame seeds with great results.)

Great recipe! Bread flour is key and proofing in your oven (heat to 100F with a bowl or dish of water and shut for 1 hr with oven off)  Many others use bread machine.  Just use a bowl and knead it.  Don't want to over develop the glutens.  Mine came out light and airy.  It takes some time to proof so don't rush them.  Patience will reward you!

I've made this several times.  In the past, the buns have turned out little and dense.  However, this past time they were AMAZING.  soft and fluffy.  I did a few things differently.  1. I actually followed the recipe when it says to beat in 1/2 cup of flour at a time (resisted the urge to speed things up) and did not add any extra flour.  I tried to be scant on the flour.  2. I gave it a double rise like most bread - once as a giant dough ball and again in little ball form.  3. I made only 8 hamburger buns and they turned out to be the perfect size.  4.  I flattened them down a lot before their second rise on the baking sheet.

Holy Cow!! These babies are awesome! I halved the recipe, used skim milk, one whole egg and still the two and a quarter tsp of yeast. Put all in my bread machine then went on to step three. The taste is just great and so easy to make! I used them for grilled burgers and had no problems with them not holding the burger. Just perfect!

I think these turned out great. I made them just like the recipe stated. I was concerned about only one rising, but they were actually bigger than I thought they would be and so easy. Will make them often, Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

These turned out light and fluffy but it seemed to have a sour taste to it- I added 1 tbsp of yeast, was that too much? hmmmmm....Also I did make this in the bread machine, then shaped baked in the ooven, they didnt brown- maybe I took them out too quick?

AMAZING! MARVELOUS!  FABULOUS!  I have been working and living in Japan for almost 2 years.  It is NEAR IMPOSSIBLE to find hamburger buns at supermarkets here.  The only hamburger buns you will find in here is at a McDonald`s kitchen...or a gourmet hamburger restaurant ( which are actually rare in numbers ).  I am not a big fan of hamburgers, but once in a while, you get the great desire and craving for it.  Armed with this recipe, I set to work and was amazed!  I followed this to a tee and it turned out fantastic.  It was slightly crispy on the outside, but very light and fluffy on the inside.  I do suggest a few tips though ;
If you are using whole wheat, it doesn`t rise up as much as regular white flour with these buns.  Hence, for those who want to use whole wheat flour, it`s best to add a bit of white flour to the mix.  I made another batch with 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular flour, and those turned out to be more like dense breadrolls ( still  delicious though! ).  This recipe is a keeper.  In fact, after I review this, I will make another batch for tomorrow`s dinner :  My boyfriend requested hamburger twice in a row bc of these buns!

Perfection!  Like some others, I used the good ole bread machine for the dough cycle, added in quite a bit of minced garlic as well as an extra rise prior to baking.  Thank you!

These were amazing.  Everyone loved them.  I did make two changes.  I used 1 1/2 cup bread flour in place of all-purpose.  I also let them rise twice as long.  They were not dense, but soft and fluffy.  Smelled amazing.

These were great! They do not taste like mushy white store buns, and kids may prefer that kind of thing, but my family (including kids) thought these were really good, and that they make burgers seem fancier. I have put sesame seeds, poppy seeds and plain egg wash on at various times, and they were all good.

I made these for a my kids' birthday party, YUM!  I love them so much I am now making them for a baby shower for about 20.  They are worth it.  I had to bring it down to only serve 9 per batch, I felt it was too much for my bread machine, mine is 1 1/2 pound.

These buns were great!  I was a little apprehensive about the hot dog-sized lumps of dough I got when I tried to shape them into hot dog buns.  They looked a little small, and I was afraid they wouldn't rise to be big enough so I made seven instead of the recommended eight.  Boy, was I surprised when I pulled these out of the oven!  They got huge!  The smaller ones turned out to be the perfect size!  I halfed the recipe and used the left over half of the egg for an egg wash.  I wouldn't recommend doing this because the tops stayed very pale and looked kind of funky.  I would definitely make this again.

These buns are the best!!!  I will never buy store buns again!  The only things I changed were:  I substituted whole wheat flour for 1 cup of all purpose, and I let them rise 2 hours (30 minutes wasn't enough).

Hi,
Thanks for this GREAT recipe!
Im a 32yr old male and even I couldn't screw it up. The buns were perfect, exactly 12 and even my wife was impressed!
I took some pics with my digital camera, maybe I'll post them somewhere sometime.
I tried a few other recipes and I usually ended up with either rocks, slosh or something else un-edible but this recipe was PERFECT!

These turned out great! I did notice I got two different results from the same batch baking them on different pans. One pan resulted in really light & fluffy buns & the other in flatter heavier buns. Experiment! Thanks for the great recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to make hamburger buns.  With all the trans fat/partially hydrogenated garbage in everything nowadays, I am looking for homemade recipes to substitute.  As easy as it is to just buy this kind of thing, making them wasn't that much harder.  Personally, I like the fact that I know what is going into my family/friends mouths.  Thank you for making this transition easier.  PS.  My husband ate them with butter and honey for breakfast, he really likes them!!!

Excellent for chili dogs.  I used a rolling pin to make the rectangles for the hot dog buns--it took a little time, but definitely worth it.  Can't wait to try the hamburger buns, and it'll be much quicker.

These buns are delicious and eay to make.  For hamburger buns I make only 10 because I like them large and I flatten them to about an inch high before the final rise.  They also make great sub buns.

USE BREAD FLOUR! Excellent recipe when you use bread flour instead of all-purpose. I have tried many recipes using bread flour and each time it comes out perfect. Whenever I use flour I just don't get the same results. With bread flour, this came out fluffy, soft and yummy. Perfect for sliders and lasts a few days and still yummy. I have learned that any bread recipe is better with bread flour. Also super easy to make with a bread machine using the dough setting. Also, I normally bake my breads at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes and they come out golden brown on top. When I followed this recipe at 400 degrees, the top was almost burnt but not too bad. I will stick to 350 next time.

The people who rated this low must have either been killing their yeast, not measuring the flour correctly, or both. I made this exactly as described and they were the best buns I've ever had. I've learned that you have to weigh flour because there is a big discrepancy between weighing and measuring. Measuring ends up in dense buns, weighing results in light and fluffy buns. I used my bread machine to make the dough, just put in the ingredients per the manufacturer's instructions and make sure to beat the egg a bit. The dough turned out pretty sticky, but i just put a little bit of oil on my hands to roll them into balls and flatten them. Worked like a charm.

What I love about this recipe is that it can be made in an hour. The first time I made the dough, I used a Danish Dough Whisk. It took minimal effort to knead the dough into a smooth ball. The second time, I use my Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer, and the dough kneaded in about 7 minutes. My tip is: turn your oven onto WARM for 2-3 minutes, then turn it off (while the dough is kneading).  This creates a proofing oven, where my rolls proofed beautifully in 25 minutes. I like to brush an egg wash and sprinkle with either sesame or poppy seeds. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I've made these several times now.
I've gotta admit, though, that my first attempt turned out a tray of bricks.
The problem was my active dry yeast.
Now I add 3.25 tsp active dry yeast to the Milk, Water and Sugar mixture that has been heated between 110-115F. Give it a stir and start getting everything else ready. The yeast needs around 10 minutes to activate with the liquid and sugar. (it'll start getting foamy)
For me that made all the difference!
Like others here I do 2 rises.
For consistency, I weigh dough balls when splitting them out after the first rise.
3oz for hamburgers, 2.5oz for hot dogs.

Last batch I used 25% wheat flour and they were awesome with some pulled pork!  :)

I'm lacking words to describe how good these are. I don't have instant yeast, so I use regular active dry yeast instead and let it rise twice, once after kneading the dough, and then again after putting the buns on the cookie sheets. I do not cover them, because for some reason they don't rise as much if I do. But I do brush the buns with buttermilk before letting them rise. It keeps them from drying out and gives them a nice color, and it doesn't affect the flavor at all.

I make them pretty much on a daily basis, they are so good they don't last long here. They are very versatile. We use them for burgers and hot dogs (they make burgers taste gourmet), we eat them for breakfast with honeybutter or butter and Nutella, and we eat them for pretty much any meal, or outside meals, with butter, Black Forest ham, and swiss cheese. Or whatever else we come up with. They are always delicious. Cream cheese and strawberry jam, yum! Sometimes I put sesame seeds on top too.

Anyway, these are absolutely perfect. I don't think there's any room for improvement.

I will be a chef soon and I do like to make bread and am always trying new recipes. I followed this one as is and was disappointed big time. The problem was with the proof time given. So I made them again this morning and allowed them to double in size before putting them in the oven. They were good. I did half as indicated in the recipe and I have the other half in its' second rise. i have a feeling they will be better. Hi folks!!

These were wonderful and really easy to make. They came out soft and light. It took less than an hour from start to finish for me, as I heated the butter mixture in the microwave  I used regular yeast and let the milk mixture cool a bit, then proofed the yeast in it then mixed everything in my KA, let them rise in a warm place for about 30 min and baked them for 11 min. Perfection. They also freeze well.

Very good buns, but I felt they were a little sweeter than I'm used to bread being. They were however consumed quickly by my family. :)

Did not rise up to an appropriate height for buns. I bake bread often so I am not sure why.

4.5 stars because using soley A/P flour - I wouldn't have been as fond of recipe. The measurements were just about spot on tho. I put together a little differently as to how I make dough. Used reg active dry yeast (1 pkg) which I proofed in the 1/2 C warm water with a tsp of molasses. I melted the butter with milk, 1tblsp of sugar plus some dried minced onion & onion powder. For the A/P flour I used: 1C WW, 2C's bread flour, 1/2C of quick oats and 1C of A/P mixed w/the salt. Added 2 cups to liquids ready in my K/A mixing bowl and added remaining in increments until it just pulled together but still sticky. I let it knead for about 5 mins. I used approx 1/4C A/P flour to knead by hand for add't min but dough was still quite tacky. I spray non-stick on my hands to keep dough from sticking. I let rise for an hour prior to shaping. I rolled the dough out to about 1/2" thick and used mouth of large funnel to press out 6 burger shapes. Balled up remaining, divided into 6 pc's for HD buns which I rolled out then rolled up into longer buns (I use Nathans beef HD's which are 6.5" long). I lightly pressed some sesame seeds on the ham buns and let all rise again add't hour b4 baking. I lined pans w/parchment to prevent over-browning. End result -light/fluffy but way better texture and taste than store bought. Will def go this route from now on. I would recommend 2 rises regardless what type of yeast used.

Did not rise well at all, and the texture was more like a bread stick than a fluffy hot dog bun. I successfully make bread from scratch quite frequently, so I'm inclined to think there's a fault somewhere in the recipe. Might read through the reviews and use other's tweaks, but I think it's much more likely I'll just stick with store bought.

Delicious, soft, fluffy burger buns.  Tips for those who had problems: 1 - Use rapid-rise yeast, which is meant to replace the "first rise" when making bread with regular, dry active yeast.  This recipe directs for only one rise, so likely means for you to use rapid-rise yeast. 2 - You likely need to let the dough rise much longer than 35 minutes, until it has risen to just over double in size, to avoid "dense" bread.  Rise-time is very temperature dependent and the size of the dough should be the gauge, not time.  Even in the tropics, I give the dough about 1 1/2 - 2 hours of rise time.  Follow those tips and you'll have big, soft, delicious burger buns!
Alterations I like to make:
-sub half the flour for whole wheat
-sub water for all milk
-add 1 T honey (in addition to sugar)
-add 1tsp each garlic & onion powder
-add 1/4 cup shredded cheese towards the end of kneading (Asiago or Parmesan work great)
-brush with egg wash (for beautiful browning) and sprinkle with whatever you like (herbs, cheese, seeds) before baking
Making these alterations, this is definitely my go-to bun recipe.  I won't ever purchase them at the store again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought these were great. Nice and light. I did use bread flour and vital wheat gluten (I do in all my bread) so I don't know if they would have been quite as good otherwise, but I thought they turned out perfect. Not too sweet like some recipes I've tried for buns.

Based on taste, these buns tasted fine. However, mine came out somewhat small and dense, though I believe that had to do with my methodology. The liquid was at 120* and I added the flour a half cup at a time, as well as stuck with the rising time, which resulted in a small (hamburger) bun.

LOVED THESE! I made them for grilled sausages and My Hubby said "Oh wow these are really good". I cut the recipe in half, and it made 4 large hot dog type rolls which was great as there are only the two of us. They were not fluffy and airy, they had some density which is exactly what I was looking for, I hate how store bought buns can get soggy, yuk!
I will continue to make and enjoy them.

Excellent flavor and texture! I used 3 tablespoons of melted BUTTER, 1 pkg regular yeast, and ran through the dough cycle before shaping and doing the final rise. I made 10 rolls. Of similar recipes for buns I have tried on this site, I like this recipe best.

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe. I've made a lot of breads, pizza dough, etc. over the years, but never hamburger buns.  What a disappointment and waste of ingredients.  The buns were dense with a coarse texture, not what I expected based on all the positive reviews.

I dumped all of the ingredients into my breakmaker.  4.5 cups of flour pretty much maxed it out...but eventually a nice dough was made. When all was said and done, everyone said these were the best burger/sandwich rolls they've ever had!!  It made enough for dinner, then lunch, and even a few breakfast sandwiches. Toasted them and put on fried egg, cheese, and Canadian bacon. Awesome! Thanks for the recipe.

wow!  if I could give 10 stars to this recipe I would!  I made 4 large buns, 4 smaller buns and 4 hot dog buns out of this recipe.  these are the best hamburger buns I've ever had!  even my husband said they were perfect because they didn't fall apart when we were eating our burgers.  the flavour is just right - a little sweet, but just the right balance of salt.  I made the dough in my bread machine, let it rise for about an hour, then formed the buns.  I'll never use store bought again!

I've been baking these all day and freezing them to use for son's 2nd birthday party next weekend!  We're having chopped bbq sandwiches and I wanted to make it extra special!  I added onion salt and onion powder to give them a hint of onion flavor and they turned out AMAZING!    2doz down, 2 more to go!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I made this recipe with soy milk and non-dairy margarine and it was great! Very good! I keep kosher and its easy to make parve buns now!

Also tried this recipe with the bread machine making the dough... did a GREAT job -- super fluffy!

I have made this twice now.  LOVE IT!!  The dough mixes up very simply.  I make smaller buns and larger ones.  Today I divided the dough in half and use it to make pigs in the blankets.  Then I made buns out of the rest.  They were very delicious!!  This recipe is so simple I can see myself making these for all sorts of family dinners!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

So easy and good!  Made dough in my bread machine, after first rise took out, shaped, and let rise for another 30-40 min.  Made 8 huge hamburger buns and two hot dog buns, will probably make a few more next time so they come out smaller.  Substituted 2 cups wheat flour for white, used bread flour for rest. Very soft and tasty, much better than store bought!

Wow, these turned out great.  I used my bread machine to do the kneading then pulled out and cut into 12 buns.  Let rise about 1 hour and baked for about 15 minutes.  YUMMMO.

My yeast was expired, it proofed, but I used a little extra just in case, about 1 tsp extra.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, using my kitchen-aid mixer to knead the dough, and got 16 big awesome hot-dog buns. Oh, one more thing, I let them rise about an hour, recipe says less than that for hot-dog buns.

I've made these before and kept forgetting to rate them  It took me way to long to rate this recipe.  This recipe is wonderful.  We are making homemade sauerkraut with the family and we are having a German theme day.  I needed miniature rolls of bread for the German beef and kraut that  I am serving.  I came upon this recipe again and decide to make the rolls like they were miniature loaves of bread.  Wonderful.    Held up very well.

These buns made my cheeseburgers so delicious!!! I found this recipe to be very simple.  I made a few changes to the recipe, as suggested by other reviewers.  1) I added another tbsp of sugar.  2) I used Bread Flour instead of AP. 3) I let the dough rise 1 hr before divided it into 12 pieces.  4) After dividing the dough and shaping into rolls, I let rise 60-70 min before baking.  5) Brushed melted butter on top while baking, to get a shiny coating.  These few changes helped me get a light and fluffy bun.  So yummy, will definately make again soon!

These are very dinner roll"ish" but, family loved them. Brushed the top with butter. Made in the bread machine until step 3. Saved me from running to the store, thanks! Next time I think I'll try bread flour.

I love this recipe! I used half whole wheat flour and half white, and I substituted 1T active dry yeast for the package of instant yeast. Then I mixed the yeast with the warm liquids and half the flour and let proof for 45 minutes. From there, add remaining flour and salt and follow the recipe instructions. Ymmm...

Fantastic! I added the ingredients as described in the recipe to my breadmaker. This also gave it a rising time prior to forming the balls, as other reviewers wisely suggested. Before baking them, I gave them an egg wash and sprinkled on poppy seeds (my husband wants a Chicago style hot dog). I took the original author's suggestion to make 16 hot dog buns instead of 12 but definitely will not do that again. I ended up with "hot dog buns" that might handle a small stick of beef jerky. I LOVE the taste of the bread, though, so will definitely make it again...maybe even tonight.

These were really very good! I have made these twice-once in my kitchen aid and the second time in my bread machine (with the machine, I used less flour than called for). On my second try (which is in the machine right now) I added 1 cup wheat in place of a cup of the white flour. They make really beautiful and big rolls :) Used them for sloppy joes and they were very filling!

These were not great for me.  I made as directed, except like another reviewer added 1/2 c of butter instead of 1/4 c.  I put the ingredients into my bread machine on the dough cycle.  When I removed the dough, it was gorgeous and easy to work with. I turned my oven on low until it warmed up and then shut it off.  I placed the buns in the oven for an hour to rise.  After rising, I baked them for 12 minutes at 350.  They were soft, but just not a lot of flavor.  Probably would not make again

The flavor was okay, but I found these to be too dry and dense for burgers and dogs. They kind of fell apart a bit when we tried to eat them, too crumbly.

The first time i made this recipe, the dough was very tough and hard to work with, didn't rise well, and made a very dense roll. I made these again today, and though again, the dough seemed a little too tough, the rolls came out great and tasted amazing!!! Thank you.

this is a good recipe as far as bread goes.  it tastes great!  however, it's a little sweet and dense for hotdogs.  thanks for the previous recommendations to let it rise longer.  i let mine rise 2 hours.  also, i halfed the recipe like another cook and made 8 hotdog buns like the recipe suggested instead of 6, but i think they'd be better bigger.  this is a great bread stick recipe- just brush with garlic butter or dip in cheese sauce.

I have made these several times, using my bread machine to make and rise the dough and they come out great every time. These are the only buns we use for hamburgers now - just takes a little more planning. I have also made them as regular dinner rolls by just making them a little smaller.

These buns are awesome!  Shortning can be used in place of the butter.  I always let the dough rise in an oiled bowl before I shape into buns.  After shaping I brush buns with and egg wash then sprinkle with sesame seeds (hamburger buns only).  After the final rise I bake as directed.  These are truely awesome buns and very economical.

I used my KA mixer.  Had to add 1/3 cup of additional flour.  I used dry active yeast.  My rise took about 90 minutes.  I got 13 hamburger buns --- they look wonderful!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow! I started the dough in my Kitchen Aid and before the dough was completely pulled together, we had unexpected company. I turned off the mixer and the dough sat there for an hour! When I got back to it, the dough had a dry crust on the outside. I decided to try to finish it anyway, so I started the mixer back up and proceeded.  They were great!  My family loved them!!!  If I didn't ruin them - no one can!

These buns are really yummy.  My whole family enjoyed them with our hamburgers (including my 2 year old).  They are super soft, but dense enough not to be squashed.

These make really great hamburger buns, can't wait to make hot dog buns.  Just make sure you make 12 buns like the recipe says. I made 6 and they got really big.  So unless you want to make really big burgers don't  do what I did.  I especially liked these because I could mix them up and let them rise while I prepared potatoes and the patties, then while the burgers cooked I popped them in the oven and they were done when everything else was.

I have used this recipe for pizza dough- I just throw everything into my bread machine and add 1 tbsp pizza seasoning.  I have also made the dough and used it to make braided bread.  This is fantastic and everyone raves about it- best bread recipe ever!

Hi.  Made this yesterday.  Love the taste and texture.  It is not sweet, soft, slightly chewy and had a bit of crunch (ate this still warm just few minutes after baking).

These can come out a little dense if you don't let them rise enough, especially the second time. You shouldn't bake them until they have risen to the size that you want them to be when they're done.

Love this recipe. Use it a lot for pigs in a blanket. My kids can't get enough. (Actually tastes like it would be good for a panettone base, too.) Of course being a rebel, I don't follow exactly: I mix all dry together, mix all wet together (sometimes don't even bother to warm liquids) and then mix wet with dry using my hands. Everything else is the same.

Since finding this recipe I refuse to buy buns. I usually only need 4 buns so I take the rest of the dough and make pizza "hot pockets" with it.

It is a perfect dough

Wonderful recipe, my buns turned out soft pillowy, tasty and perfect. I brushed a beaten egg over the dough right before the oven. Cooked 14 minutes turning the pan at 10 minutes. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I mixed this up on the dough cycle in my breadmaker.  I baked the rolls in my convection oven after brushing them with egg-wash and sprinkling some of them with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, and dried onion flakes. They were delicious!  Used them for pulled pork sandwiches.

Oh. My. Hot. Dogs!  I'm a beginning baker. This is, literally, the 2nd bread I've made. I was pretty loose with the directions (because I hate precision) and they came out fantastic. EXACTLY like the fresh-baked buns from our local supermarket that hubs normally buys at $3 for 8 buns. I didn't use all the flour, because the dough seemed to be pulling away from the sides of the bowl. I think I left out the last cup. I added quite a bit back in during kneading, as in the video. All else is as written. First rise was 1.5 hours, the dough was nearly triple in size. Maybe it's because it's May in Tampa and the house is a bit warm, about 75º. I punched it down, shaped it into 16 hot dog rolls, let rise on a greased baking sheet for another 35-45 minutes, then baked. They were perfect at 12 minutes. After they cooled, I stored them in the fridge in ziplock bags. 15 seconds in the micro and 4 buns were soft and room temp, ready to go. Some of them aren't very pretty, and the size is anything but uniform, but don't judge. It's my 1st attempt, and hubs and I agree this is a winner. I'll get the shaping thing figured out! Oh, yeah, we're not buying buns ever again.  I might brush the tops with milk or melted butter the next time, to get that golden glaze we love, but I swear it's not necessary.

Great recipe! I have made these for a while now. I have used water and oil in place of the milk and butter(had kids over with milk allergys) and they turned out really good. I do make them with all whole wheat too.

These are quite good--mine did come out a bit dense for hamburger rolls, but I've made lots of bread and I know that can be due to a LOT of factors. (Practice makes perfect!) I only needed 4 c. flour. Some of the reviews mentioned toughness, and too much flour will do that. The flavor is deeeeeeeeelicious--rich, buttery, YUM. Next time I'll divide it into 8 rolls instead of 12. Another thing I might try is a punchdown and a 2nd rise; it might give them more lift. Definitely a keeper though!

The ONLY thing I found that wasn't spelled out for the newbies is this:

EITHER 
Don't heat the liquid mixture until the butter melts or it'll be way hotter than 120 degrees- 
OR- 
Heat just the water and butter until it melts and then add the milk to cool the liquid.

Awesome tasting buns, very soft, and SUPER easy to make.

I made this recipe tonight for the first time. I did make a few adjustments to the original recipe. I used an additional 1-teaspoon of yeast, and I increased the sugar to 4-tablespoons. I used real butter, which added to the amazing flavor of the bun. I made the dough in my bread maker as suggested by another user. In addition, I want to share several tip to you make the perfect bun. (1) If you do not have a scale to weigh each dough ball, use a 3/4-cup to portion your dough. (2) To proof your dough (make it rise), use the “warm” setting on your oven. Before you begin making the dough, set your oven to warm on its lowest temp (mine is 145), when you get to the portioning of the dough step, turn off the oven, it will be the perfect environment for proofing for the 30 minutes required in the recipe. (3) After the 30-minute proofing time, take the dough out of the oven and preheat the oven to 400. (4) I put my buns on the top rack to keep them from burning on the bottom,. Allow them to cool and be prepared to make your burger as soon as the cool. My wife and son both said the never had a fresh hamburger bun and never want a store bought one again. Thanks for the recipe!

"WOW!" That's exactly what my husband said after the first bite. This recipe is GREAT. It was really easy. I followed the recipe exactly because this was the first time I made it. I did brush the tops with egg before baking, as a few people suggested. I made 12 hamburger buns, though they were kind of big. Next time, I might try 14 of even 16. The texture of these buns is NOT like the cheap Wonder Bread buns at the store. These taste fancier, more gourmet, like something you'd get at a nice sandwich shop or restaurant. They are NOT like the dense, heavy, brick-like buns I've made before. They were light, almost fluffy, but sturdy enough to hold a big, juicy hamburger loaded with toppings. I also waited until they were cool, sliced them all in half, and stored them in freezer bags. They thaw beautifully. About 30 seconds in the microwave, and they taste like they just came out of the oven. I will DEFINITELY make these again. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. Thank you, Sally!

First time ever to make hamburger buns and it was so easy and fun to do.  I got my 14 year old daughter and her friend involved to help me.  Any time spent with my daughter is a plus for me.  I think they had a lot of fun getting their hands in there to help.  We followed the recipe to a T.  I did brush with melted butter before I baked them and right after then came out of the oven.  I can't wait to try these with our burgers tonight.

About six months ago I got a bread maker and began scouring the internet, looking for a recipe that will make dough for SOFT hamburger and hot dog buns, similar to store bought with 'body' rather than air. After trying four or five recipes, I found this which produces exactly what I was looking for. These have just the right texture and softness. I can't praise these enough. Further, I made these a little bigger to use for sausage and peppers and today I'm about to attempt to use the dough for larger loafs for cold cuts.

I think I should have let them rise longer or more than once.  They were pretty dense.  The taste was good - just the texture was a little wonky.

I've made these several times and they're the family favorite! Store bought tastes like cardboard compared to these. I use a mix on (freshly milled by me) whole white wheat flour and all purpose. I also let it rise once in a greased bowl then punch down, form and put on baking sheet lined with reusable parchment paper. Then I brush an egg wash on them (1 egg 1 tablespoon water beaten). I top them off with a mix of sesame seed, minced onion, and garlic powder. Wowzers, they're delicious!! This time I substituted honey for the sugar; they're on the first rise now.

Followed the recipe just as written and the buns turned out great! Will never need to buy hot dog or hamburger buns again! Also used this recipe to make fantastic cinnamon rolls. They came out light and fluffy and baked perfectly. No more need to make a heavy sweet dough!

I made the hot dog buns and they turned out great!  I will make these again and again.

I did use my bread machine and read several others did too but I didn't see how they did theirs in the machine.

I heated my butter, water and milk on the stovetop just to melt the butter.  I didn't check the temperature.  I added it to the bread machine, then the egg and all other ingredients (that's the order my machine gets filled with liquids on the bottom).  I didn't have instant yeast so I just used my regular yeast, about 2 3/4 teaspoons to get me just over a package of yeast.   I only used 4 1/4 cups of flour, thought I would watch the machine and add more flour if needed but it was somewhat sticky dough and probably would have been fine with the full amount.

I did brush them with egg/water before baking.
I made 11 buns, some were larger for later in the week (thinking italian sausage and peppers) and the smaller ones were used for hot dogs.

Reading other reviews I was worried they might be "dense" so I added a tbsp of gluten to them and since I only had regular yeast a tbsp of that, they turned out wonderful! I was going to try a 1/4 of a hotdog (cause I baked them into the bun) and ended up eating the whole thing!  They were nice and golden brown too, I have another recipe for buns but this will take it's place.

Really good, especially right out of the oven.  I didn't have instant yeast so I used dry active yeast --2 3/4 tsp and I proofed the yeast first then mixed everything together and did 2 rises.  I made hot dog buns--they weren't pretty, but with practice, I'm sure they'll get better.  These can be used also as sandwich rolls.  Thanks!

I forgot buns at the store, so I tried this recipe -- it was fantastic and I plan to make my own from now on.  I halved the recipe to make 4 jumbo size, they were perfect and just firm enough to stand up to some giant juicy burgers without getting soggy.  (Some recipes in the past were more like light dinner rolls and didn't hold up so well.)
Thanks!

I made these 100% organic and dairy free...they are wonderful! I substituted one tablespoon of white sugar for brown and used gourmet sea salt. In the last 3 days I've made both the hamburger and hotdog buns. They are so fluffy!

This was by far, the BEST hot dog buns I've ever had, store bought or home made.  They were so soft, but still firm (if that makes sense).  I used my bread maker on the dough setting (using the entire cycle, so I don't know if that contributed to the lightness of the dough).  I too was also able to get 18 hot dog buns, but I'm pretty sure I might be able to get 20 buns as they came out big.  I'll try hamburger buns next using this recipe!

So much better than store-bought. Mine turned out a little dense, but that may be due to my technique rather than the recipe. Still, they were good. And maybe a denser bun was better, since they held up really well to our fully-loaded burgers!

These were delicious and very easy - I threw everything into the breadmaker on the dough cycle, then just formed the buns.  They got the thumbs up from everyone in the family.  This one's a keeper!

Easy to follow recipe and even easier if you use your bread machine! These were some tasty and light buns. I used 1 1/4 tsp salt and 1 3/4 tbsp and divided them into 10 buns which were just right for our burgers.  These will be a staple for our household now.

I read the reviews for this while the buns were rising (which took about 3 hours).  They were good, but I did find them to be a little more dense than I like.  Next time I try these I will, 1 - add less butter, and 2 - make sure my milk, water, butter mixture isn't too hot.  I am worried that some of the little yeasties may not have survived the hot liquid!

I made a couple of mistakes when I was making these. First I put in a full cup of water. Oops. And later I put in two eggs. Oops again. Needless to say, I needed to add more flour, but the dough was silky smooth, and I loved working with it. I rolled them into hot-dog buns, and raised them in the oven with a boiling cup of water for around 45 minutes. I only baked them for 10 minutes, and they were perfect.

Raising them to the right fluffiness was my only issue, otherwise I love the flavor!  Homemade buns must be used or freezed immediately. Without the preservatives they don't stay fresh long.

I just pulled these out of the oven a few minutes ago and they are AMAZING!  I make bread often and couldn't just throw the yeast in so here is what I did... melted the butter and milk together.  Proofed the yeast in the warm water, then added the sugar to that.  Mixed 2 cups of flour with the salt.  I added the milk/ butter mixture to the flour/ salt and mixed with my dough hook on my mixer.  Then I added the water/ yeast/ sugar mixture and mixed with the mixer again.  I added 2 more cups of flour and the egg to everything and let it run in the mixer until well blended.  I added another 1/2 to 1 cup of flour... just watching until it was the correct consistency.  I then put the bowl on the stove, covered it with a towel and let it rest for about 2 hours.  I came back to the dough, rolled it into balls and put it on the cookie sheet (only made 10).  I again covered with a towel and let rest for about 1 hour.  Then I baked them!   They came out soft and fluffy.  Perfect for the sandwiches we are having for dinner!  I will NEVER buy buns again!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

These were very good, though a little time consuming. I would probably make them again. I didn't have instant yeast, so I proofed my yeast in the heated milk mixture with the sugar before adding the flour. I also used half whole wheat flour. I made them a little smaller--got about 16 hamburger buns to the batch--and made slider style burgers.

For those who are having trouble with your density, the problem may well be not enough kneading and/or too dry dough. Dough should be tacky when you start and knead at least 10 minutes. Dough will feel like smooth skin when done and a finger pressed in will leave a dent that fills back in.

Excellent. Can't go wrong with this! You can actually get about 16 out of this, and not 12 servings, otherwise they are HUGE buns.

exactly what I was looking for. another reviewer said they used the bread machine, so I did the same thing. I heated the milk and water. I also used room tempature butter. ( I might have used 1/2c of butter.oops!) but they are wonderful and thank you.

Good taste and texture.  Before baking I gave the buns a little brush of egg wash on the top. Although these were very nice they're a little too bread filled for a "bun" this is very close to a dinner roll.

Perfect.  This is just what I have been looking for.   For just the 2 of us, I cut the recipe in half to make 6 nice-sized hot dog buns, a little bigger than store-bought.  I also used bread flour and 1-1/2 teaspoons of instant (rapid) yeast for a half batch.  Then, after kneading the dough for about 7 minutes, I followed the yeast package directions and let the dough rest for 10 minutes (in lieu of the first rise) before shaping the dough and putting them to rise on a greased cookie sheet for 1 hour.  I brushed an egg wash (whole egg whisked with a couple tablespoons of water) on them and then I baked them in my toaster oven (large enough for a whole chicken) with a convection feature, and baked them for 14 minutes.  I did brush a little margarine on them after baking to keep them soft.  They had a great texture, light and slightly chewy, great color.  Wonderful flavor.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

I have been relatively successful in my  venture into the art of  bread making.  It does take practice, working through what is really a lessen in chemistry. Terms like proofing, active yeast, instant yeast, rising.. What on earth is a gluten? These once sounded so daunting. I am fortunate to have a KA stand mixer & a bread machine which has  allowed me to slowly familiarize myself with how dough should feel and look. My 1st New Years resolution is to make my way through the mountain of saved recipes in my recipe box. This bun recipe has been in my saved items for more than a year and is now the first to be finally made. Made into sausage buns, they turned out to be as delicious as the sausage and sauce that filled them. I suppose  I can see where some reviewers thought them to be dense but I think the texture was very well suited for what I wanted. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It's a winner!

Wonderful recipe!  1/2 of the flour I used was whole wheat and I added my own seasonings...and they turned out terrific! My husband loved them...and then even more the day after!

I made this twice in the past two days. The first time, I forgot about the milk mixture for a second and it boiled over! I still used it. Let the dough proof in an oiled bowl for a few hours, covered in a warm place. I was worried, because I could still see little specks of yeast in the dough. Didn't rise super high. I then shaped into balls and proofed again until it rose a bit more then baked. They were heavenly!!! I served them with tuna burgers from this site. Soooo fluffy, and soo delicious! The second time, I kept an eye on the milk and did the rest exactly the same as the first time. Still see specks of yeast, did not bake yet, but can tell they will be just fine, and as delicious as yesterday. I will try to proof the yeast in the milk mixture next time before adding the flour, even though after baking no more trace of yeast. Perfect buns!!!!!(PS: ONE PACKAGE OF YEAST= 2 1/2 TSP ;) )LOVE THEM!!!!

We loved these. I made the dough in the bread machine and used a little less than half wheat flour and the rest all-purpose flour. These will be my go-to rolls for hamburgers and hot dogs for now anyway. Edit to add: For anyone who ends up with dense or flat rolls, my advice would be after you make the dough, let it rise for an hour or until about double. Then punch it down, shape into buns and let rise again for about 35 minutes. This is what I did, and my rolls were perfect.

I threw everything in my bread maker on the dough cycle, did not "proof" the yeast", shaped them after the 1 1/2 hours in the dough maker and let them rise about an hour in my rather cool house.  Came out perfect.  Easy enough for a beginner if you don't get wrapped around the details.  Just follow the original recipe, but let rise an hour after the first kneading and 30-45 minutes after shaping and you'll do fine.  Not heavy at all, in fact, I thought they were rather fluffy.  I won't buy buns again.

You know a recipe is good when you screw up and it STILL turns out great.  My mistake was when I attempted to proof the yeast.  I did so with the 1/2 cup of water and then forgot and added another half cup to the milk and butter to heat.  So I had to measure out a cup of the milk mixture, which threw off my ratio. THEN just as I was about to knead the dough, I had to take my daughter to softball practice.  Despite all of this, they came out beautifully.  I don't think my tastebuds could take it if I followed this recipe exactly.  Definitely a keeper and worthy of me keeping all the ingredients on hand.  Would make wonderful dinner rolls and perfect "slider" buns.

after reading this recipe and all the reviews, i had to try it out, however i did listen to others and proofed my yeast with 1tsp of sugar in the water then once it proofed i added it to the flour/sugar/salt before the milk/butter mixture.  i let the dough proof for an hour an then i divided it up into buns and placed in pan and let raise again for an hour.  HOWEVER I had an oven malfunction. so i was forced to bake my buns in the toaster oven 2 at a time. and turning them over to make sure they didnt burn on one side.  after this long ordeal, my buns still turned out fantastic, soft, and delicious. not even hard on the exterior.( which i was worried about being so close to the heat in the toaster oven)   i will definitely try this recipe again, once i get a new oven. and i bet it will be even better!

Good standby recipe. Made one or two more buns than recipe suggests. Used fresh yeast and proofed it first. The key to perfection is the rolling technique, stretching and smoothing the dough's skin for that flawless look.

I used my bread machine to mix the dough and let it rise. I did substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flower. I formed the buns and let them rise for 35 min. They turned out awesome. Best bun recipe ever! Thank You!

These are very good.. The first time I made these I used instant yeast and they turned out very dense, taste was good but too dense, could have been my mistake so I waited to review.. 2nd time I used traditional avtive dry yeast and proofed it and they turned out perfect!! I did do an egg wash on top.. Yummy!!

These had great flavour and were so soft when they came out of the oven I thought they were undone. Waited till they cooled to see if they'd taste as good as when they just came out and they were firmer but still fluffy and very soft. Very easy recipe and will definitely make again. I basically followed all the instructions except change a few things according to how I usually make bread. For those who ended up with hard buns they prob didn't rise because the yeast was killed when being mixed directly with the salt. I always mix the salt in with the flour and gradually add that in while mixing. I also let the dough rise twice.

These taste AWESOME! I feel compelled to rate with four stars for one reason though. The directions for making into hot dog buns were really confusing for me. Once they baked I saw what the submitter meant, but while reading the instructions I was totally lost and just hoping I rolled them right. Mine came out more like breadsticks, but at least I know what to do next time. Anyway, they are DELICIOUS! I used equal amounts of AP flour and whole wheat flour and upped the yeast to 4 tsp. Great taste, great texture. Thanks :)

Very good buns!  I increased the yeast to 4 tsp because when I use instant yeast, I seem to get better results with about 1 tsp of yeast per cup of flour.  I also substituted 1 cup of whole wheat bread flour and used white bread flour instead of All Purpose.  The buns are very soft and light and much better than store-bought!

Easy and delicious! We formed our dough into 7 hot dog buns for dinner tonight and made 9 smallish hamburger buns for tomorrow. Much cheaper than buying the 'high-end' products we usually use. Will definitely use this recipe again and again!

These were so beautiful and they held up very well to juicy hamburgers with all the fixings. So much better than store bought. The second time I made them I used 1/2 whole wheat flour. Another gorgeous winner.

This is a good recipe with some modifications to the instructions.  I used the ingredients mentioned, but used standard yeast.  I allowed the yeast to proof in the milk/water/butter mixture for a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I added the flour last.

After kneading the dough as described in the recipe I put it in a covered bowl and allowed to sit until double in bulk.  Then I punched down the dough and kneaded a second time before shaping into hot dog rolls and hamburger rolls.  The rising time of 30 to 35 minutes should not be followed for either rise as this will vary depending upon the temperature of your kitchen.  On the second rise look for the dough to be almost double before putting in the oven.

If you allow the dough to rise twice before baking these rolls have a great texture and a really good flavor.

These taste great and even after freezing, they are still excellent. I don't make these nearly as often I should - could eat them just as they are!

It took a lot of rising time for me to get good hot dog buns, simply because my kitchen wasn't warm enough. If I had taken them outside (in summer) to let them rise, the original time would have been sufficient and the buns might have been a touch sweeter. But I had plenty of time to let them rise and the other reviews suggested they might need it, so I wasn't worried. I made 16 hot dog buns. I weighed the portions to get even sizes, but I still ended up with a few that were too skinny, so they became breadsticks for dinner (coated with garlic butter, yum!). I used whole wheat flour for a portion of the flour (less than half). These were substantial buns, not the airy nothings you get from the store. I was pleased with them and my husband says he'd be happy to have them again. Half of them are in the freezer now to be used one-at-a-time for lunches.

Overall a very nice recipe. Better for hamburger buns, but in a pinch, or for those of us who really are sick of the store bought junk, good enough for hot dog buns. I do not use instant yeast so for anyone else who does not, bloom your yeast in the ½c water and add the sugar about 2 minutes before your ready to start mixing everything to get the yeast good and activated. Make sure your milk is good and warm as well. For hamburger buns the given directions were excellent. For hot dog buns tho, I cut the dough into 16th's (roughly), or by weight (0.076kg = 76g = 2.68oz). I then roll them around the counter in a cupped hand to form a nice ball, which I then roll out into a snake, like playdough. I tap the ends a bit to make them flat, then proof them for 30-35 minutes. If you flatten them much they tend to stay flatish. We actually poke a hole down the middle of the finished product and push the dogs in, instead of cutting them in half. I would like to thank Sally for submitting this recipe.

Easy and delicious! As per other's suggestions, I used bread flour and let them rise for a bit longer than suggested.  I also brushed them with clarified butter half way through baking.  They do not come out like the buns you'd buy in the bread section of your grocery store, more like the kind of buns you pick up at the bakery.  I will be making these again and again.  Thanks!

I have been making all of our bread except for buns for about a year now. I made these this morning and they are wonderful. I will not be buying any more buns. I do all my mixing and rising in a bread machine. This is a very easy recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

These were soo good.  I added about 2 T. minced onion, 1/4 t. garlic salt, to the first flour mixing, after I added the rest of the flour, mixed in about 1/3 c. finely shredded cheese, it like melted into the dough, and brushed the tops with melted butter before baking and put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven. so good , so easy love cheese and onion buns.

I do a lot of bread baking, but I cannot recommend this recipe.  These buns were dry, flavorless and tasted more like plain bagels than hamburger buns.

I used olive oil instead of butter and bread flour.  I'll make these again.  I let them rise almost 2 hours before baking.  Came out beautiful.  I also used my bread machine to make the dough.  Thank-you for this wonderful recipe

Easy and so soft and delicious.  I made them as hamburger buns only, but I can see how theyd be just as great as hot dog buns.  I used my breadmaker to make the dough.  For half of them, I brushed water and sprinkled on sesame seeds.  I will add these to my rotation for burgers and hot dogs.  Thanks!

I tried to make these today and it didn't work! I was so disappointed, but I know it wasn't the recipe, it had to be something I did. I am new at baking bread. Thats why I'm giving it 4 stars. So anyway, I'll try again hopefully with more successful results. *Update: I made these again yesterday and they turned out great. I did use all bread flour this time and made 9 hamburger buns. Very good! I knew it wasn't the recipes fault! :)

These are wonderful!! The texture is perfect,not too dense or too light to hold a hamburger. They were super simple to make with the bread machine. I will never buy buns again.

These were ok, I made hot dog buns. Mine didnt rise all that well, so I think next time I will use a little more yeast, might just be my altitude here. I will make these again.

These are unlike any bun I have had. If baked until *just* done, they will stay soft for the next day. We use these in place of bread for sandwiches on a regular basis. Sometimes I have to add a little more flour to keep it fom being too sticky while handling, and it will cause the buns to not brown on the top...but they still are VERY GOOD!! Also good results using oil in place of the butter. Thanks!!

These were pretty good! I doubled the recipe and made some hotdog buns and some hamburger buns. I used about 75% whole wheat flour as well, and gave the dough 2 risings.

I liked the fact these didn't turn out too sweet, as any other roll/bun recipe I've used in the past has been over-sweet, they were a touch stodgy in comparison to shop bought however I find that with any home made bread products. would definitely use this recipe again, the clincher being both my kids and husband loved them. In fact my husband said the buns were better than the burgers I made!

These came out good, but a little on the dense side for me.  Next time I think I'll dissolve the yeast with the liquid mixture before adding to the flour mixture.  I believe that is where the problem was with the dough not being airy enough.  The taste was great though, and the family preferred these to another recipe I had been using from this site.

This is the best roll or bun recipe I have ever tried!  I like a softer crust, so almost at the end of baking  I brushed milk over the surface for a softer finish.  It also made an excellent loaf for soups and dinners, just slightly longer rise and bake times.

These buns turned out great!  They were the perfect weight for hamburgers or sloppy joes.  I used half whole wheat flour and they still turned out light and fluffy.  I did let the dough rise before I formed the buns.  It was a little difficult to get the shape right.  I think the best way is to roll it out and use a round cutter.  I am planning on making a double batch of these to make PB&J sandwiches for school to stick in the freezer.  My kids loved the bread.

So frustrating.  I tried these TWICE, and I gave it two stars because they werent' terrible, my kids at them warm with butter and jelly, but by no means a soft, fluffy bun like I expected.  The first time I put it in my mixer, and followed the directions, etc., and they came out way too dense and bland.  So, this morning I tried again, and kneaded it by hand thinking maybe using the mixer had over-kneaded them, making them too dense.  NOPE!  Turned out the same!  The only other thing I will try is just using warm water from the tap instead of in a saucepan.  I usually make my bread with home milled whole wheat and maybe I am just used to the fresh, soft flavor.  My tougnue kind of rejected these.  Maybe one more go at it and add gluten this time?

These turned out beautifully as burger buns.  They were a little "bready" inside but will try to make them flatter when i set them out to rise.  Will make again.

Yummy buns!! This is the first time I baked buns or bread. Light and tasted very nice. When they were baking in the oven, the house smelt so good. I used half the recipe and made 8 tuna buns (rolls). After kneading the dough, I shaped them into 8 balls (slightly flattened) and let them rise for one hour. Then I made the rolls with tuna  filling, let them rise for another 45 minutes, and baked for about 20 minutes. My husband and I loved the buns. Thanks for the great recipe Sally.

Ver good and forgiving recipe.  I mixed it in my breadmachine and cooked the rolls in the oven.  I will need to work a little more to shape the hotdog buns.  Mine were too flat but that was my fault.  Still, the buns were fine.  I will definitely use this recipe often.

Good buns, I managed to mess mine up (I am a novice to baking bread), and they turned out too dense, but they still tasted good,. Am looking forward to trying again (hopefully with no mistakes!).

Very good texture and flavor.  I didn't have instant yeast so I used the regular and mixed it with the warm water and added it with the butter and milk.  Very easy.  I did let it rise twice.

Spectacular burger buns!  Dough is so easy to make...if you're intimidated when recipes call for kneading, etc...don't be!  They look and taste beautiful.  It does take time, but well worth it.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe! :)

Both my husband and I were very impressed with this recipe.  We used the buns for hamburgers and sandwiches.  I used my bread machine and regular yeast in place of instant yeast.

Great recipe! They are great for sloppy joes' and chili cheese dogs as well. Mine never seem to brown very well until they are over done, so do not wait! It may be my OLD oven though!

I made hotdog and hamburger buns today, and my husband and two kids couldnt believe I made them from scratch. They were so easy. I doubt that I ever buy buns again. I got 12 buns out of the recipe just like it said. Thanks Sally!

Excellent recipe - really good for dinner rolls, too.  They are soft and delicious!  I had to make about 8 buns out of the recipe to make them big enough for hamburgers, though, so I usually double the recipe and get an even 16 hamburger buns.  Haven't tried this for hot dog buns yet.

I had a lot to do yesterday so for the first time in a long time I used my bread maker instead of the stand mixer to make these buns.  But I forgot to add the egg!  I made 12 hamburger buns but I formed them slightly differently.  When I took the dough out of the bread maker, I deflated it and then flattened it out to about a half inch and with a glass, cut out rings and placed them on the slightly greased cookie sheet.  I had some dough left over so I formed it into a hotdog bun shape (that was all the room that was left on the cookie sheet).  The result was 12 beautiful hamburger buns exactly the right size for the burgers I made (they rose beautifully) and a great log bun which I had for breakfast this morning.  This was a great and simple recipe.  Oh yes, I froze the extras (there are 8 of them) and will use them when needed.

Thank you so much for your recipe! I made the heavenly hamburger rolls last night, my very first time and oh my stars they were so great! I do wish to ask you or any other viewer, Is there a way to make them a little lighter , not calorie wise but texture wise? Thanks again!

These turned out so good. I kneeded the dough in the bowl, why make a mess of you don't have to. I let the dough rise for about an hour, punched it down, made the buns, let them rise about 45 minutes brushed them with egg wash. They didn't Brown up like I wanted, but that is a issue with my propane oven. Next time I'll bust out the roaster oven. These are simple, fast, and delicious. I'll never buy buns again.

I use this recipe but I mix it differently and I use delayed fermentation to enhance the flavor of the finished product. 

I mix the the liquids, the yeast (I use 1/2 that amount of yeast) and all of the flour together just to the shaggy point in my KitchenAid mixer. Then I cover the mixing bowl and let it autolyse/rest for 30 minutes. Then I add the other ingredients and mix it on speed 4 until the dough passes the window pane test. Then I put the dough on the counter top and do 3 stretch and folds with a 20 minute autolyse between each stretch and fold. Then I put it in my proofing bucket and put it in the refrigerator overnight. That slows down your proofing and adds flavor. The next day I take it out of the fridge punch it down and final shape it and place my buns on a parchment lined sheet pan and cover it with plastic wrap so I can see when the buns have doubled in size. Once the buns have doubled in size I apply an eggwash (yoke only with a teaspoon of water) and some sesame seeds and bake them. 

These are technique's I learned baking artisan sourdough bread. This method takes exactly the same amount of "hands on" time but it gives you a much better tasting bun.

Turned a regular Sunday afternoon hotdog into a fun foodies meal!  I used bread flower (cause it's all I had) and it very rich full buns!  Also brushed it with egg and dusted with sesame seeds to put it really over the top!  Great recipe!!

I tried these today with a mix of White Whole Wheat and Unbleached Wheat flour.  They were so yummy my children ate a number of them without us even getting to the burgers.

Use this recipe all the time . I mix the flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat , and 1/2 cup rye , the rest is AP flour . These are delicious and freeze well . We have used this recipe for making two loaves of bread at a time , and it is great also . Double wrap the loaves with a plastic wrap before freezing, and it will thaw easily on it's own and be just as fresh when cooled after baking.

I LOVED THIS. So easy and my hamburger buns turned out PERFECT. I didn't change a single thing... except I let them rise for about 45 minutes or so. I used my kitchenaid to knead the dough *usually I do it myself* and it was still perfect. thank you so much!!!!!

Overall a good recipe. However, I used bread flour instead of AP. Also, I did two rises once after initial kneading for one hour. Then again after the buns were shaped for another hour.

I halved the recipe and make 8 hotdog buns slightly flattened. Made dough in bread machine then let raise 1 hour. Divided dough into rolls, then flattened and placed nearly touching on oiled sheet pan, covered with towel and let raise another 35 minutes. Baked about 12 minutes rotating pan 1/2 way through. Really good.

Great buns. Onky change I made was using 2 eggs. Gives them even better color. I use this for hot dog, hamburger and hogie buns. My wife no longer buys buns. Topping with seasame or cerely seeds is great. This is my go to bun recipe.

We really liked these!  They had good flavor and texture, a little denser than most store-bought buns.  Since they don't have added preservatives, plan on eating or freezing them within a couple days; that's about how long it takes for them to start drying out.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe.  I used the paddle attachment on a Kitchenaid for the first mix, the switched to the dough hook until the dough started "cleaning the sides" of the bowl.  I then hand kneaded a bit until it was very smooth & elastic.  I let it rise an hour, then benched the dough at 3.5 oz. & let rise for the 30 min. suggested, then brushed w/egg wash & topped w/poppy seeds & kosher salt.  They were beautiful & sooo good.  We will be making these for gourmet burgers at our culinary student's weekly restaurant.  They are that good!

Good recipe, just plain buns/rolls. I proofed my yeast and used less water. Let rise in oiled glass bowl first then shaped and let rise again on baking tray. Used a little coarse sea salt on top. This recipe goes a long way so I made some herb dinner rolls as well. These are easy and fun to make, I attempted square buns. House always smells so good when baking bread.

This recipe is a keeper for my family. I already have a special recipe for our hamburger buns, so I used this recipe tonight for our hot dogs. They were so soft and fluffy. Next time I will make two batches and freeze one for those easy weeknight dinners.

These rolls were amazing!! They are so soft and delicious- I will NOT be buying burger rolls ever again! This really doesn't take that long to make and you can make extras and freeze for a later date. I let my dough rise for an hour in the bowl, and then kneaded it, then made into balls, then let rise for 30 minutes after that. They came out perfect! Thank you so much for a great roll recipe!

Made these tonight using organic ingredients. They are absolutely wonderful!  Light, fluffy, and just what I was looking for! I will never buy buns again. I used my bread machine but had to add just a drizzle of luke warm water while it was mixing because the dough was a little dry.

This was a very easy and forgiving recipe.  I tried it for the first time but made a few adjustments due to the comments. I think a longer rest time will help increase success.

Using a stand mixer, I mixed the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.  I let the dough rest for 15 minutes before kneading. You could use the mixer to knead the dough instead of hand kneading. The dough was then divided into 12 equal pieces. After another 15 minute rest, I shaped the dough and placed them a a greased sheet pan. Let the dough rise for 30 minutes.  Make sure the dough looks and feels soft (like a marshmallow) before baking.  If it feels like playdough to the touch, then let it rise for a bit longer before baking. Brush with an egg and milk wash before baking for a nice golden brown top.

Just a side note..Don't add more yeast unless you like the flavor of instant yeast. One package of fresh instant yeast is more than enough for this recipe.

These taste great! If I would have read the quantities correctly, I would have had some awesome buns! I separated the dough in half, and tried to make 8 burger and 12 hot dog buns. Big dummy, they're way too small! Well, I've got some  tasty dinner rolls anyway!

These turned out great! However, I ended up needing only 3 1/2 cups of flour to get a light, non sticky dough with the perfect consistency. I guess that's why the flour is added 1/2 cup wise. I let the dough rise for 45 minutes, punched it down and kneaded it again before forming individual buns. I brushed the buns with an eggyolk, sprinkled on some sesame seeds and let them rise again for 30 minutes before baking them.
Will definately make these again!

I have baked so many different type of breads that i was growing skeptical i would ever find a great recipe, but this one is by far, hands-down the BEST bread/ bun recipe EVER!!!!!!!!! Truly soft on inside, with a thin outer crust. I put foil on top at the last five minutes of baking to keep the crust golden and not too brown.

Dear Sally,
my girlfriend and I were looking for a recipe for some classic american burger buns because we were so frustrated by the choice of burger buns here in germany. Finally we found and tried your recipe. We were or better we are actually stunned by it! The buns tasted amazing and they were wonderfully soft! We both think that your recipe is outstanding and we surley will recommend it to our friends. Cheers!

I have made these buns a few times and love them!  I don't really follow the directions though.  I put everything in the bread machine and let it run on the dough cycle (2 hrs for my machine).  When it is done I just shape it into whatever shape I want.  I don't like the way the hot dog buns turn out in the recipe so I don't roll them out at all.  I use them for everything.  Hot dog buns, hamburger buns, sub rolls etc.

Very good easy to make buns.   Probably a bit heavier than I'm used to, but still very good.   I made subs with this recipe.

If you are wanting plain bread with a soft and fluffy  inside and a bit of a crust on the outside, this is that kind of bun.  I just made these as rolls and served them with soup as well as some preserves.  My husband and kids loved them and they didn't take hours to make.

Just a tip, if you’re doubling the recipe for a party or something, I like to start off with 7 cups of flour, then if I need more slowly add in more, that way you don’t end up with too much flour and hard to knead dough.  I also substituted honey for the sugar. ??

My buns turned out great even so I forgot the egg - oops. Thanks for the delicious recipe! I did proof the yeast first in the liquid for about 6 minutes and then I added 1 cup of flour before adding the salt. Salt kills yeast, so you need to be careful and be sure you add some flour before adding the salt. After adding the rest of the flour (it was very humid today, so I probably used about 5 cups flour) and kneading the dough, I did put it in a greased bowl and let it rise for an hour. Then I punched it down and kneaded out the air bubbles and let it rest for about 15 minutes before shaping into the buns. I then let them rise for about 30 minutes. The first batch didn't bake as nicely because the oven wasn't hot enough at 400 degrees, so I upped the temp to 450 and they were perfect after about 10 minutes. I did put a pan in the bottom and poured in hot water at the start of the baking process to get a little steam going in the oven for the baking process. I also did an egg wash on the buns before putting them in the oven so they would bake up golden brown and shiny. They turned out lovely. Thanks again.

This recipe is fantastic!!! I used half all-purpose flour & half whole wheat flour. I don't eat eggs so I substituted 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce. I used my bread machine on the dough cycle & continued with step 3. They turned out light, fluffy & delicious! I won't be buying store-bought buns again!

These buns turned out amazing! They were light and fluffy, and tasted exactly like hamburger buns. Definitely could not make 12 buns out of the amount of dough. We ended up making 8 large buns, and had enough dough left over for a small bun. So one could probably make 9 regular sized buns, or just 8 super sized buns!

I am so NOT a dough maker. Seems that most every dough recipe I attempt I somehow fail at. Not this one though. I did heed the advide of other knowledgable reviewers and let the dough rise for an hour after kneading. It easily doubled in size. Then I punched the dough down, halved it, then made 6 burger buns with one half, and 8 hot dog buns with the other half. I then let them rise again for another hour or so. These we so light and delicious! What a fun recipe. Makes me feel a little better about my dough skills. Thanks!

They turned out tasting just like a regular commercially produced hotdog bun. Mine didn't brown as nicely as I wanted them to though. They also were harder to shape than the video makes them out to be. I made 8 large hot dog buns rather than the recommended 12.

The second time I let it sit overnight before baking ... and 5 star status buns came out of the oven. Definitely a keeper ...

I've tried several hamburger bun recipes and I always come back to this one. Very, very good. I use the dough setting on my bread machine. I add a bit of the warm milk, water and butter to the whipped egg, just to make sure my egg doesn't cook. Works great! Thanks for this recipe!

These were pretty awful. Way too dense, didn't rise well at all. I've made bread dozens of times, and it's never started out with a pot on the stove! I would like to try these again, but next time I'll proof the yeast (warm milk, heated in the microwave for about 45 seconds, with the sugar stirred in and topped with yeast - when the yeast gets foamy, it's good to go), and then add in remaining ingredients. I think the milk just gets too hot on the stove and made the yeast less active.

This is a great recipe - I made cheeseburger rolls with this dough and the texture is perfect. It rises beautifully and it has a nice, crisp top but soft interior. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Great baseline recipe.. the temperature is too high for the milk/butter.. keep to between 105 and 110 degrees, and proof yeast a bit first. Watch how your dough comes together, I didn't need all 4.5 cups.. used half WW and half AP. Used a 370ml can condensed milk with 1/3 cup melted butter, and topped off the difference with water, didn't have an egg.. still turned out pretty darn good! Took a LONG time to rise, but that was prolly the weather. Brushed with butter when they came out. Will use this recipe regularly!

Mine tasted delicious but looked more like rolls. Could this be due to using bread flour? Also mine were very small and didn't brown. Should I use some kind of wash?

I thought this was a great starter bun recipe. I didn't add the hot milk mix to the yeast and eggs because I was worried it might kill the yeast so I didn't warm the milk as hot. They turned out wonderful and they look great too! I did start with warm water sugar and yeast first to actavate the yeast then went on to do everything else as the recipe said except I did a egg white wash before I baked them.

Wonderful recipe. I've tried others, but this is truly the best Hamburger Buns we've ever made. The Burgers we've cooked were very juicy, no problem for the bun, it's the perfect bun for a special BBQ or for a dinner with that special something...5+ Stars from us!

Awesome, soft and perfect for burgers or hot dogs. They have enough stability to even hold a heavily laden chili dog without falling apart. So easy I don't have to buy the nasty store ones again!

Doubt I'm ever going to buy hamburger buns again! I accidently made these tonight (Don't ask...long story) but I'm glad I did!  Used my electric mixer to mix the dough until it got too thick, then stirred in the rest of the flour.  Let the dough rest for about 10mins after kneading before I formed the buns.  I actually had to let the buns rise for almost an hour and was sure I had done something wrong because they'd barely risen, but I popped them in the oven anyways and crossed my fingers. 15 mins later, the result was huge, fluffy buns that put the store bought ones to shame.

I followed the recipe exactly and had to add a few tablespoons of flour because it was sticky but that's normal since it's always humid here.  I let these rise for over an hour and they turned out huge.  They are light and fluffy and taste great.  For those that had dense buns maybe they didn't rise long enough.  I always use rapid rise yeast too.

These are really good. I really can't fathom some of the negative reviews at all. If you're having trouble getting them to rise, or if they're turning out too dense, your first step should be to try proofing your yeast. If your yeast proofs fine, then remember to mix the first stage of ingredients really well before adding the rest of the flour to give the yeast time to start munching on the sugar and making bubbles. Also remember that any bread recipe's suggested amount of flour is just that: a suggestion. If your dough won't take more flour, don't just keep dumping it in. I ended up only using about 4 C of flour total today, but in different weather or with different flour I might use more. Once you get the dough to the right consistency, knead it ONLY until it is smooth. Resist the temptation to keep kneading; overkneaded bread is dense bread.

I made vegan buns last week (ran out of eggs) that where better than these. The bottom half was dense and the top half had an air bubble. I was using King Arthur Flour and followed the recipe perfectly. I made a second batch a bit wetter for my dry climate and it was no different. Forgetting texture, it didn't even taste as good as the vegan buns... and I didn't love the vegan buns either!

These are amazing!!!!  I used my breadmaker which gave me perfect dough, the rise time is VERY important.  They need to look big and puffy before you bake them or you will end up with a dense bun.  I let mine rise for an hour and a half before I baked them, they were absolutely perfect, thanks so much for this great recipe!

I tried these hamburger buns and they turned out very small and heavy, I even cooked them for over 15 minutes and they were still sticky on inside. These buns I would recommend for chilli or soup but not hamburgers.

Fantastic! I used 80% whole wheat, 1 tablespoon instant yeast, and replaced the 1 cup of milk with a 1/2 cup of soy milk and more water. Also used margarine instead of butter. Just simply perfect, rave reviews, totally wonderful. I will be making these for my kids' lunches, much cheaper than buying them the rolls I was sending them to school with!

OMG.....never met you Sally, but I  love ya! This is a truly outstanding recipe for superb rolls - easy to follow/make, great crumb, taste, and heft. I am a novice @ breads, starting with the 5 minute artisan sourdoughs and progressing to partial mixer/partial kneading, and just recently got a machine. Actually, I prefer hand kneading, and this recipe gave me my first "epiphany"..... I finally got that ultimate "feel" of my hands on the perfect dough and it was heavenly! I opted to make larger rolls so I ended up with 9 baked for 17 minutes.....take a look, they are beauties! Thanks again Sally! And if I can create these, anyone can.

This recipe made delicious hot dog buns! We used half wheat and half white flour and they turned out wonderfully. We divided them into smaller balls, as suggested, and ended up with hot dog buns perfectly sized for our fake hot dogs. Next we're going to try them as hamburger buns!

Way better than store bought! I heated the milk, water, and butter as directed and added it to my bread machine. Then I put the rest of the ingredients in the bread machine and let the dough cycle take care of the rest. I followed the rest of the directions exactly except for the egg wash. They were a little dense but delicious!!

I've started using half whole wheat flour and they are still wonderful.  I also use 1 tbsp sugar, apprx 1.5 tsp truvia which I don't think changed the taste.  Delicous. The first time I made these they came out quite tall which made the burgers a little difficult to eat.  Flatten them quite a bit!  Sesame or poppy seeds on top are really good, too!

Great recipe!  Make sure you get a good raise on those buns. 30-35 didn't do that for me, I gave it twice that amount, I allowed the dough balls to double before placing them into the oven. A tip from King Arthur Flour -- when the internal temp of the buns reaches 200 degrees F, you are good to go.  Coat buns with milk and shake some poppy or sesame seeds on top before baking.

I cannot bring myself to buy store-bought buns anymore. This will really impress your guests and it's so easy to do if you use a bread maker. You just throw all the ingredients into the bread maker pan, select the dough cycle, once that's finished you shape the buns, rise them for about 40 minutes and bake as directed. I also like to brush the buns with beaten egg and sprinkle with sesame seed before baking. Your guests' jaws will hit the floor when they ask where you got these and you tell them they are homemade! Also, since it is just me and my husband, when I make these I put whatever we don't eat into a food bag, tie with a twisty tie and keep them in the freezer. Then whenever we want to use them we just take out whatever we need, reheat in the microwave or toaster oven, and voila! Just like freshly baked. They keep pretty well in the freezer for a couple of weeks.

Can't wait to make these again!! They are wonderful! I did have to let them rise longer than the 30 minutes, but think that next time I will let them rise before dividing them out into 12. Then let them rise again! Cooked them a few extra minutes also!!

Used this recipe last night and made hot dog buns. I used whole wheat flour in place of the ap flour. They tasted just like store bought buns except they were a little heavy, next time I will use less dough per roll and let them rise about a hour.

Didn't come out as I expected, good taste but not fluffy enough for hotdog buns. Maybe I did something wrong. Texture came out like garlic bread sticks so I threw in the freezer for the next time i make spaghetti.

Husband LOVED these!  We used them for pulled pork and they were awesome.  I did let them rise about 30 minutes longer and probably will proof the yeast next time instead......thank you!

These are just heavy rolls. I was looking for a light bun. They are only about half the size a hamburger bun would be, and very dense with a doughy taste.

This is definitely a recipe worth keeping. The buns are a bit dense, like a roll, but they're perfect if you like a lot of bread. I let the dough rise 1 hour, then divided and shaped and let rise another 35 min. I rubbed butter on them right out of the oven and sprinkled with sea salt. Delicious!

Uh yea... this didn't work out for me AT ALL.  I made two batches one after another.   They never rose, and my yeast is brand new.    They are as hard as hockey pucks and heavy.   My children have been threatened that if they misbehave they will be on just BREAD for dinner.  They all went scurrying to do chores!

I don't rate recipes very often but will this one. This is, bar none, the easiest bread recipe that I have ever tried. For those who have complained of it only making a limited number, not rising, etc, be very careful heating the milk the milk, water and butter mixture. I would recommend only heating it so 115 degrees . If your thermometer is not working correctly and you heat it to 122 or so, you will kill the yeast and the buns won't rise. Thanks Sally for posting this recipe!

Absolutely wonderful.  By using the dough option-on the bread maker machine --this step takes about 10 minutes, you can have the rolls in the oven in around 40 to 45 minutes.
This recipe is now my new and only burger bun.

OMG!!!  This is SOOOO YUMMY!!  Made it with a bread maker and follow the step 3 on from the recipe.  I devided the dough in half and made 6 burger buns and 9 hot dog buns.  I'll make only 6 hot dog buns with the half of dough the next time since the hot dog buns turned out to be a little too skinny..,.,

These rolls were alright, but nothing spectacular. But that could have been because I don't have a bread machine and I was using active dry yeast instead of instant. I may come back and edit my review after the next time I try out this recipe.

I tried this recipe... but it did not turn good at all, I know it was ME, all the reviews are great.  I used all the ingredients... I did 8 hot dog buns and they did not rise at all!  I used the instant yeast, and the result was hard compact bread... hard to eat!

Good buns, but a 30 minute rise is nuts. Mine took 2 hours in a warm oven. Other than that, the dough makes good buns!

My first time making hot dog buns! SO YUM! A big hit with my husband and our guests!

Just make sure your water/milk/butter mixture isn't too hot. Be kind to your yeast :) I was cruel to mine, but I PRAYED and God rescued them :) 

DEFINITELY a KEEPER! So different from regular store bought buns - WAY better than the big brands. And fresh out of the oven - they are GOLD!!! :)

Thanks for the recipe!

exceptional...just what i've been looking for. i'm cooking for 60+ people tomorrow. and for some reason i have decided to go with these fish sandwiches. not to go into the whole story it's just that I am very grateful for your nice, easy, effective approach to these rolls I really wanted. 
i have to do this often,cook for this many people, it's just for some reason today I feel like I'm on an episode of Top Chef in my mind. 
Thanks for a little relief.
Have a good day. I just made a trial version...magnificent! Thanks again!

These turned out sort of dense. They had a nice flavor but were rather dense and didn't rise much so they were on the smallish side too. Large enough for our quarter pound burgers but barely. I'm not sure what went wrong probably just my inexperience more than the recipe. I'll give it another try as they turned out nicely flavored just somewhat heavy, LOL, DH thought they were sourdough they were the same dense texture.

Such a wonderful taste.  I made the hotdog buns WAY too big and had to cut in half.  I used wheat flour.  I only used 2 cups white flour and 2 cups wheat.  I made some hotdog buns and some hamburger buns.  Thanks for the tip to egg wash the top of the hamburger buns and add sesame seeds.  Yum.

AWESOME!  These are really easy to make and taste fantastic!  These are the best ever.  No need to look any further.  My husband is head Chef at a restaraunt and is going to start making these for their burgers.  He was very impressed as was everyone I served these to.  They would also make tasty dinner rolls.  Just make them smaller:)  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these tonight for the first time and they were awesome!  I used my bread machine on the dough cycle then followed the rest of the recipe from step 3 on as suggested by other reviewers.  They are so good that we ate one of them tonight as a dinner roll - great texture and flavor!  I did use margarine instead of butter (I was out of butter), and I let the margarine and egg come to room temperature before I added them to the bread machine.  I beat the egg slightly, then put all the 'wet' ingredients in followed by all the 'dry' ingredients followed by a packet of active dry yeast.  Excellent recipe - I can't say enough about it.  Thank you so much!!

These buns really put a classy and gourmet touch to simple hamburgers/hot dogs.  Hubby and I both were very impressed.  Soft and flavorful...just like costly bakery buns, but inexpensive and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these yesterday and was sadly defeated ... but did it again today and redeemed myself! I realized two things the first go around. 1. Make sure the milk, butter, water mixture is the right temp. If its even slightly too hot it will kill the yeast. 2. Let is rise longer. 
The first time I used rapid rise yeast and the second time I used active yeast with 2 rises. I prefer using active yeast because I just think it always works better for me and is worth the extra rise time. I proofed the yeast in the half cup of warm water (instead of adding it to the milk and butter) and 1tbl of sugar. Taking into account I used 1 tbls of sugar for proofing, I only used 1tbl then in the recipe. I did two rises and it was perfect.

this is the first time I've taken the time to review anything, I used this for hotdog buns, followed the recipe almost exactly.  I didnt have enough AP flour so I used bread flour, and I used my bread machine on the "dough" setting.  Alittle work but worth it for Nathan's hot dogs or brats!  I need to practice my rolling, as they weren't very "pretty" but tasted fabulous!

Very good buns- nice and soft.  I made a half recipe.  I used half AP flour and half whole wheat pastry flour with good results.  I added and an extra Tbsp of sugar since I like a bit more sweetness and also a Tbsp of vial wheat gluten . Perfect!

I used only 1 tsp salt and 4 c flour with 4 tsps vital gluten, the dough was so dry that I had to add an additional 3/8 c of warm water.  After I kneaded the dough for 8 minutes I let the dough rise for 60 minutes since I didn't have instant yeast. I then divided dough into 4 ounce balls, got 13, shaped into hoagies for our meatball subs tonight.  I let the buns rise another 60 minutes, then baked at 350 for 15 minutes, it was perfect.

Made with active dry yeast, not instant and they were excellent. I do not know what the difference would be, the rise time was the same.

What an easy and tasty bun recipe!  I whipped these up as hot dog buns and hamburger buns in a matter of no time.  They are soft and hold up well to hamburgers with all the fixings.  This is definitely a keeper, especially when you forget buns!

This is an excellent recipe. I substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose flour and used an egg-beater equivalent of one egg. Everything came out great. Since this is so simple to prepare, I will probably stop buying hamburger buns.

Fab! Buns came out soft and not too dense. Make sure you kneed the dough long enough! I needed to feed mine a little extra flour as the dough was too sticky in the beginning.

I used this recipe to make hot dog buns and they were very good. A word of caution though... if u are scaling down this recipe, do not rely on the calculator provided here. For some reason it does not scale down all of the ingredients eg. the egg and the yeast amounts, which completely throws off-balance the relative proportions of the ingredients . So make sure u doing the calculation urself or you will have very hard buns to contend with!!

These rolls are delicious and super easy!  I put everything in the bread machine and then continued with step 3 on.  (I warmed the milk, water, and butter on the stove until the butter was melted first.)  They were soft, a little crusty, and melt-in-your-mouth tender - they made our burgers taste gourmet.  I will never go back to those tasteless store rolls again.  And I bet this recipe would be a great base for variations like onion rolls or cheddar rolls.

These were good - they were not huge as the recipe states, but that might be because I subbed in some whole wheat flour so perhaps that caused them not to rise as much. I made the dough at night, formed, and refridgerated then let sit at room temp for 40 min in the morning before baking. Good recipe thanks

Wow they are huge! I made hot dog buns out of them and they turned out much more plump than in a store. I did let them rise 2 times, so maybe that had something to do with it. I mis-read the directions and allowed them to rise 2 times, but they turned out wonderful.

Oh. My. Goodness. Followed the recipe exactly (almost) and came out with these little fluffy bread pillows from heaven.  The only thing I did differently was I let them rise for an hour then shaped them into balls then let them rise for 30 min then baked.  LOVED these!

Great recipe ! I've made it quite a few times, for hot dogs and hamburgers, and I must say it is great as is but perfect if you omit the egg (I forgot it once and they turned out better than the other times). Thanks Sally for this recipe, haven't bought buns from the store in ages thanks to you !

Did not come out fluffy at all. I think it was my fault- lack of experience working with dough.More on the dense side but they still tasted pretty good. I will give it another shot in the future.

The dough was great to work with, and the house smelled like I had walked into a actual bread factory! They needed more than 30 minutes to rise. I just let them have most of an afternoon for that, and popped them in the oven as dinner time approached. DH liked them better than another recipe I had been using, but I may try one or two more. If this one beats all others, I'll come back and add another star. Thanks for posting.

Good recipes.  I will use it again.  Bread turned out nicely.  I used 1 cup of wheat flour in place of 1 cup of the white flour.  It took a little over an hour to rise.  I punched it down after, shaped the dough and let it rise on the baking sheet for another 20 minutes.  Hot dog buns are perfect.  Hamburger buns were a little smaller than i had hoped.

Excellent recipe! I just switched around the method used to mix the buns, since I used traditional yeast. I had no problems with denseness- I always proof my dough and shaped buns in a preheated 115F oven and I used approx half bread flour and half all purpose flour. Bread flour is twice as expensive as all purpose, but it is worth it- it gives such a better texture to bread! I urge those who had problems with this recipe previously to try again with my suggested changes.

I followed the recipe to the letter, but these didn't come out like I pictured. They taste great, but they're way too dense for hot dog or hamburger buns. Maybe they should be allowed to rise longer, or rise in a humid area.   The recipe as written gets 3 stars.

This was a COMPLETE FAILURE! It was on my part because I was rushing to get to kidlet's ice skating class. The buns never rose and I told my husband to cook them anyways. I think I'll use it for bread crumbs. I'll do this recipe again and hope for better results and hopefully not kill my yeast. ***UPDATE*** Made this recipe again for Sloppy Joe's. So good and easy to make. Better than store bought!

I put all the ingredients in my bread machine with the liquids on the bottom and the yeast on the top.  (I also scrambled the egg slightly).  I set it for the dough cycle; and, when finished, I followed the instructions starting with step 3.  I also used a pkg. of Active Dry Yeast as it was all I had.  The end product could not have been better.  I will definitely keep this recipe as it was not only delicious but was very easy to do.

Great homemade buns....I keep extra ones in the freezer, pop them in the oven to get them a bit warm, and just as good as if they were fresh!

Honestly, this recipe did not work for me. Maybe its something I did wrong, but I've never had a bread recipe fail me. I followed the recipe to a T but it wouldn't even rise. I have this recipe a 3 because I'm sure I must have messed it up somehow. Oh well, I guess i'll try it again :)

Really wonderful flavor.  I did let the dough proof for two hours, punched it down, shaped into buns, and then let rise another hour.  But they could not have been better.  Then I baked at 350 for 12 min.  Almost a shame to put a burger on them, they are that good.

I mixed this recipe in my bread machine and when the dough cycle was done, I couldn't believe how high the dough had risen!  I divided it and pressed down slightly and then let rise again and they were HUGE!  I did have a problem when I went to let them do the second rise, I covered them with plastic wrap and the wrap stuck horribly to the dough which deflated it a bit.  Next time, I'll just butter or oil the tops when I'm letting them rise instead of the plastic wrap.  They were also too flat, so I will not do that next time.  They did come out good, but I might try another recipe next time.  Thanks!

I buy yeast in bulk, so I don't use packets, or "instant" yeast. I used the conversion listed in the other review (4 tsp), and did the following: I heated the milk, water and butter together until the butter was melted, then let it cool to warm, like the temperature of a baby's bottle. Then I added the sugar and yeast, and whisked it together. I let it sit for five minutes until it smelled yeasty and bubbled. Then I mixed the yeast mixture, salt and half of the flour, then added the rest of the flour. I did this in my food processor. Then I pulled it out and kneaded 8 minutes, formed it into a ball and let it rise in a greased bowl covered with a dishtowel for 45 minutes. Then I punched it down, kneaded for one more minute, rolled it into a rope, cut it into 8 pieces, rolled them into balls and put them on greased cookie sheets and let them rise 30 more minutes. I baked them about 10 minutes in the 400 degree oven, until they were brown on top. They turned out beautiful - huge! I should've done 10 or 12 - and are delicious! Great recipe!

I've made these twice now.  The second time I made them I used bread flour, and they were much better.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and then followed the recipe starting at step 3.

I'm so happy to find this recipe! I've never made homemade buns before and this couldn't have been any easier.  I used my bread machine through step 3 and then shaped them into buns and baked with an egg white wash and sesame seeds atop.  I followed the recipe exact with two exceptions:  used 1/2 whole wheat flour/1/2 ap flour and for the milk, I used buttermilk.  They look and taste wonderful!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I was so proud of how these turned out!  I used 3/4C of whole wheat flour, along with the white.  If you're using a stand mixer for this, I would add more flour at the beginning and make sure you beat the egg a little.  I wasn't sure if instant yeast is the same as rapid-rise, so I let it rise a little longer.  These smelled so good and tasted even better.  Perfect for our burgers.  The 12 buns came out rather large, I think you could easily make 15 out of this recipe and have them fit a regular sized burger better.  We froze the extra and I can't wait to see how they take to freezing.

I have just made these buns for hamburgers and they are GOOD! I made half a recipe because it is just my husband and myself. I also raised them in the oven. Before I started the recipe process, I turned my oven on to 200 degrs. When I was making the recipe, I shut the oven off to start cooling. When it was time to raise, I put the dough balls on a greased (I used cooking spray)sheet. I also sprayed plastic wrap with cooking spray and layed it over the dough so the wrap does not stick to the dough when you uncover them. I then put the sheet on the lowest rack. After 20 minutes I put the sheet of raised dough on the middle rack at the required temp and time. Took them out and brushed the tops with butter. Mmmmm, very good. Our burgers aren't going to know what hit 'em! I will use this recipe again and again. Thank you for sharing your recipe. Excellent!

I GIVE 4 STARS JUST BECAUSE DON'T WORK FOR MY FAMILY AS A HOT DOG BUN.  BUT EVERYBODY ATE THEM AS A REGULAR BREAD.  I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN AS A REGULAR BREAD.
LE DOY 4 ESTRELLAS SOLO POR QUE NO FUNCIONO PARA MI FAMILIA COMO PAN PARA HOT DOGS.  DE TODAS MANERAS SE LOS COMIERON TODOS COMO PAN REGULAR.  HARE ESTA RECETA OTRA VEZ PERO COMO PAN REGULAR.

My family LOVED these! I made these buns last weekend for grilled brats and knockwurst. I put the milk & butter in the microwave on low to melt the butter and tossed everything in the bread machine. I shaped the rolls & covered them for 30 mins. They rose quite a bit, so I could've made the rolls a bit smaller. I brushed them with a little butter instead of egg. We ate them with the brats and next day toasted the leftover rolls with a pasta dinner - I wished I hadn't cut the recipe down they were so delicious. Thanks Sally! I can't wait to try these with a grilled burger.

Very good and easy to make. I didn't have enough all purpose flour so I had to use some whole wheat too and I think it gave a better flavor. I will make this again:)

My husband LOVED these. This recipe is so quick and easy and almost impossible to mess up. This coming from a good turn out with two pretty major goof ups during preparation. LOL. With that said, I'll have to try them again (hopefully without the mistakes) and see just how fabulous they can become!

These were my first attempt at making bread. They were pretty easy. I had to guess at the temp of the milk because I couln't find my thermometer, but they came out pretty good. They tasted so much like the frozen Rhodes bread dough from the store, I was hoping for a different taste.

They didn't rise very much, but the taste was great. I made hot dog buns, and since they were kind of small, I sliced the hot dogs lengthwise, and they were great. I'll definitely be making these again

Halved the recipe to make 8 hot dog buns.  I got busy and distracted while these were rising, so I ended up letting them rise for one hour, punching down and letting rise for another hour before shaping them into buns.  The flavor was very good and made regular hot dogs taste like a treat.  I'll never buy buns again!

The recipe was great! I didn't change a thing. I've made it twice now, once hamburger buns and once to use for cheddar brats. Both times it turned out wonderful. They are on the dense side, but that just reminds me of when my Grandma used to make home made bread. This is the only bun recipe I will use from now on!

Thanx for a great recipe!! I've made these 3 times now (as hamburger buns) and each time they've been better. I find that one rise works just fine; I shape them into ten rolls, do the fancy razor blade slashes and brush with egg white and sprinkle with sesame seed. Mmmm, I'm getting hungry.... No more store-bought buns for this boy!

These were awesome.  I did let the dough rise first before shaping them.  They were great with BBQ Pork.  Even the next day they were great.  The recipe was so easy to make.  I just let my Kitchen Aide do all the work!!!!

This was a great recipe. I changed it a little bit. For milk, I used instant nonfat dry milk.For the egg I used Meringue powder as a substitute. I could taste the Meringue power, so I might leave it out next time and put a real egg.

Good flavor, they make excellent rolls, but a little too hard for hamburgers. Will make again though, just need to tweak it a bit.

I use this for all my "bun" needs - hot dogs, hamburger, and they are even good as dinner rolls.  I love this recipe because you can skip the first rising,as quick as homemade rolls can get!

FANTASTIC.  This was very simple and not at all time consuming.  Very quick.  These buns take a simple sandwich or burger to a whole new place.  Although i plan on having burgers for dinner i am hoping there are leftover buns for sandwiches tomorrow.  YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THESE!!

These didn't turn out for me as hamburger buns, but instead turned into really yummy dinner rolls! They didn't rise very well. I'm thinking I did something wrong? Oh well, they were still very good!

These make great dinner rolls too!  Opps, I used a whole stick of butter so they were extra rich and instead of sugar I used honey.  I've made this recipe 3 times in the last week.

These were great. Like others suggested, I let mine rise for a good bit longer, around and hour. It makes a very dense bun that held up well to a juicy burger. These will be replacing store bought buns whenever I have the time.

These hamburger buns were great!!  Very tasty, soft and easy.  I put all the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid and let it do all the kneading.  The only variation was that I had to let them rise for over an hour.  Next time I will add some seeds or dried onions to the tops of these buns.

Great recipe. Wonderful flavor. Next time I will try raising them once for an hour before shaping into buns, though. These were a bit heavy. I'd like to try freezing them ahead. Any hints?

I really love this recipe!!  It's so simple!  I used my food processor to mix and knead it and they have been light and fluffy each time.  I'm going to try 1/2 whole wheat next time.  This is the recipe I've been looking for!!!

Hmmm..something must have gone terribly wrong with this recipe.  My burger buns looked and tasted like little rocks of yeast.  I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm allowing for the possibility I did something wrong...very wrong by the taste of it.  Would definitely advise to follow others suggestions as I didn't.  Thanks.

Super great recipe.  I took everyone's advice and gave the dough two rising times, an hour each.  It was light and fluffy and tasted great with burgers.

HORRIBLE!  Could it be bc. I substituted 1 cup of wheat flour?  Mixed everything in Kitchenaid mixer, was SUPER careful that milk/butter was not too hot so I wouldn't scald the yeast, baked them on a cookie sheet -- and the results?  Hard, flat, zero-taste disks. SO disappointed.

ok I've never made bread before, and these came out really fluffy. Only thing is i need to shape them better next time. I modified the recipe by activating dry yeast in the warm milk first, and then i brushed the tops with egg white when they were almost cooked. Really nice dough, really nice bread. :-)

I rarely buy hot dog and hamburger buns now!  This recipe is quick and easy!  The flavor is much better than store bought too!!  I sometimes add sesame seeds onto the tops of the hamburger buns before baking.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

First, let me say that I am not the best cook for making bread. Now, the buns were delicious, I forgot to add the egg, and the hamburger rolls still came out fluffy! I had a hard time making the hot dog buns, but the family at them with butter instead. I would make these again, but this time add the egg :). Good recipie.

Thank you so much for this recipe they taste exactly like the ones you buy in the supermarket. Soft and fluffy with an amazing crust!
i will DEFINATELY be making these again. No more trips to the supermakket for hot dog buns.
They are more suitable for hot dog buns. Not so good for Hamburger buns.

I'm afraid the hot dog buns didn't work well for me, a little too textured and fell apart easily.  I think that it would have been better if I had tried the hamburger bun shape instead.

It tasted good, but i'm confused about the quantity part.  It says that it makes 12 buns, but I only got about 3 1/2 hot dog buns out of this and I added everything that was called for, very strange!  I will deffinatly make this again, but I will have to change the serving amount to 30 or more just to get the amount for 12 buns.

I made these buns to serve with barbequed beef sandwiches and they were delicious.  I can't wait to make them again.  GREAT RECIPE!

I patted the dough out and cut with a large cutter, then flattened slightly on the pan.  My boys now prefer these to store-bought!  Very light and flavorful.

Don’t know why these are rated so well, they didn’t rise at all and are super doughy... I don’t normally write reviews on here, but I had to make an account to let other people know not to try this recipe. Waste of time and resources.

I made the recipe - 6 hotdog style buns and 6 hamburger buns. They came out VERY DENSE and hard to eat. The flavor was great and would probably make a wonderful loaf of white sandwich bread. Looking at the pictures of others recipes it looks like they are dense as well. I guess it's all about preference.

I used quick rise yeast and followed the recipe.   they were fluffy,  golden and delicious.   No need for a second rise.  I was shocked.   Thank you for the recipe!  It's a keeper.

This dough would not come together. It was barely formable, but I proofed it twice (an hour, then a half hour) and I put it in the oven anyway. To my surprise the final product was great!  Great texture and taste. My husband loved them.  Unsure whether I'll make it again though.

I love this recipe but I made it the double rise way :let rise 45 min, punch down, make buns, let rise 45 min again, then bake. They are great with stews or soups as well as for hamburgers. Great taste!

Good buns! I have added various cheeses to the tops of these, and cooked them numerous times. SO much better than store bought buns and totally worth the small investment in time!

These are so good, it is highly likely I’ll never purchase/eat store bought buns ever again! They’re also incredibly easy to make, even using my mixer instead of a bread machine. I made these exactly as the recipe is written with one exception, the length of time they rise...I allowed them to double in size, which took about an hour. The extra rising time took them from dense to soft and pillow-y, Paul Hollywood would be proud. Also, when I started to smell them, I checked and they were a beautiful golden brown; it was only 18 mins but they were done so I took them out and separated them so they would cool faster and not steam. This isn’t really a change in the recipe but I used sea salt so the flavor was slightly deeper than it would have been if I had used regular table salt. I think I’ll try kosher salt the next time I make them.

Holy cow is this recipe good, I made hotdog buns out of it. Have you noticed that store bought hotdog buns never match the number of sausages in the packet! I'm so over that dilemma, this recipe is the answer.

Perfect! I have flunked bread making for 56 years. Never was very good at it but this recipe turned out awesome. Everyone ate 3 or 4 and admired them. They were easy, tasty, and seem to keep well. I doubled the recipe as written and the only thing I found was that on their second rise when they are in bun shape, they need longer to rise than stated. But, I was patient and they were fabulous!

This recipe is super easy and there's only 1 rise for 35 min. so it's not an all day bread-making project.
These came out perfectly.  Nice & soft.  They really puff up in the oven.  Will definitely make these again & again!

Great! Used Whole wheat bread flour for 3 cups of the flour. Made 10 large HD buns, perfect for smokies. Could easily make 12-14 regular hot dog buns. Brushed with butter when came out of oven. VERY SOFT!

Perfect! I left the dough to rise for or an hour and a half. It’s delicious.
I made this recipe like 4 times already. Use the same amount of ingredients and it’ll turn out perfect. 
I also leave it to rise for an hour or more first, punch it down, shape it and then leave it rise again for an hour or so.

Omitting milk and replacing that amount with water seems to yield perfectly good buns too.

These were great. I did what a number of folks did, I rose the dough for 20 min in a bowl and then rose it again for about 40 min. I also added some garlic & herbs into the rolls and the whole house smelled great.

Great recipe for hamburger buns! They were quick and came out a little sweet with the added sugar, which were great for the vegetarian burgers I was making. They turned out quite small though for 12 to the batch of dough, so I would maybe try 8 instead next time. Enjoy :)

This turned out great. I did not use them as hamburger buns. I use them as plain dinner rolls with butter, and the texture was perfect. They were very soft, but not so soft that they were compromised by stacking them in a bowl, and they had a very nice crumb. They were very slightly sweet, and tasted like, well, good white bread.

The difference is I made were slight. First, I could tell there was no way it was going to form a viable dough. It stayed as a batter, so I had to add between 1/2 and 3/4 cup more flour. I also used the stand mixer to knead it for 8 minutes. By the end, it had formed a slightly sticky dough that was only mildly difficult to work with, and was very Supple and smooth, springing back when I poked my finger in it. Just what you want to see with a good dough.

Next time, I will reduce the amount of yeast and do an overnight rise to develop a more complex flavor.

Definitely a recipe worth keeping.

Hubby prefers sandwich sized buns for work. This will be my go to recipe for sure.  I weighed my dough for 12 equal buns. 
I used my Kitchen aid heavy duty mixer not by hand.

It was good, but I would prefer them a bit saltier for my taste. I basted with egg wash and added dried chopped onion and esame seeds on some.

I like this recipe. I changed a few things. I activated the yeast with just warm water and the sugar and let it stand for 10 mins. And I added the milk in cold. I also baked the buns at 350 degrees for 25 mins because 400 is always to hot in my experience. They turned out great. Will make again.

Amazing. This has turned out exceptionally well and has fed my family ideally. One problem though for the serving number as 12 wasn't very exact. I could only make about 6 sadly. But thank you for the incredible and fast making recipe!

Used old fashion bakers yeast in stead of instant yeast, and may have put a little less than I should have. They turned out a little dense, but it was perfect for a side with my meal

I made these with my stand up mixer and very little effort. I was worried that i accidentally 'cooked' the yeast by heating the liquids too much but it still turned out alright! Than followed directions but mixing in the stand up mixer and very minimal kneading on the counter.

Restaurant quality delicious! Subbed 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, otherwise followed ingredients exactly (lactose free butter and milk used). I did follow other reviewers recommendations to rise for an hour, punched down and let rise for another hour due to schedule conflict and then let rise for 20 minutes after shaped. Brushed with egg whites and sprinkled with sesame seeds. They baked up light, fluffy and full of flavor. I was worried they would be dense and heavy based on the substitution of whole grains and then prior reviews  but they were perfect. Served with shrimp burgers and greens. Will be having again tomorrow with turkey burgers .

Great recipe for hamburger or hotdog rolls. Everyone loves them. I use the bread machine, then shape the dough and place on parchment paper to rise again, covered with light towel or saran wrap. Bake at 350*.

The most fantastic recipe! I also used the modification of letting it rise before dividing and shaping and I'd recommend that. I let the dough rise for only about 30 minutes and it was 3 times the size. Excellent recipe. Delicious rolls.

Made this recipe 4 times now and turned out wonderful each time. Will never buy buns again! Smeared butter on top of Hamburg buns, wrapped them in foil and heated in oven at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes and served them as rolls for dinner. Excellent recipe!!

Really good hamburger buns!  I used my bread machine which made it even easier.  From start to finish my bread machine is 90 min.  10 min less for recipe is better.  My husband grills the inside of the bun when he cooks the burgers and it’s the best finish!   Next step is to see how well they freeze so we can just pull out two buns at a time.

I prefer a nice fluffy bun that's slightly toasted. This is more on the dense than the fluffy side and can really actually overpower the burger. It got the job done though.

I followed the recipe exactly except I put a bit of sourdough starter in for extra flavor. The texture is very good. It makes 12 fairly small buns so I would suggest dividing it into 9 portions instead.

Long story short, we retired and moved to Italy. My husband is from NJ, and has been pining for Sabrette hog dogs for two years. Our cousin, The Saint, stuffed a lunch bag with ice packs and managed to get 30 dogs here, from OH, still icy cold.  After that act, I HAD to find the perfect recipe for buns.  This is the second recipe I've tried, and it's the last.  The buns came out great, thanks to the hot milk, water, and butter starter. They are soft and tender inside, and out.  I also made an egg wash, with milk instead of water, to brush on just before they went in the oven.  It's true, as said before, they do come out a tad big. I stayed around 130  grams, but will go down to about 110 for the next batch.  In my oven, 200 C was a bit hot, and left them light on top and very brown on the bottom.  So, I put the second baking sheet in at 200C, then turned it down to 180C after about 5 minutes. Perfect. My husband's reaction, upon his first bite was, "Oh, mmmm, mmmmmm." I was jealous.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were great!  It was very easy to use the bread machine on the dough setting to get these started.  Add wet ingredients first (slightly beat egg first).  I did heat up the milk, water and butter - not enough to make the butter all melt.  It was warm.  I decreased the butter oh so slightly (maybe just by a teaspoon or so) after reading a review that said to use less butter to achieve fluffier results.   Add dry ingredients and start the cycle!  After it had risen in the machine, I divided the dough into 12 equal parts, shaped and let rise for 1 hour.  They came out quite large!  I think next time I may make 14 buns (hamburger).  Wash with egg white, sprinkle sesame seeds and bake for 10-12 minutes.  Delicious!

It is important to note that this recipe calls for INSTANT yeast -- not active dry yeast. This will make or break this recipe. I didn't notice this this first try so mine did turn out more like a dinner roll than a bun, but it is still a decent yeast bread recipe -- I just need to try again using the correct ingredients.

These are nice and fluffy but need a little more salt.  Be sure to shape them appropriately before leaving to rise.

I made a batch using my bread machine to mix and kneed the dough.  Turned out so well my neighbor took a couple and asked when I would be making another batch.  The bread machine made it so easy!

Wow, I used a cheap stand mixer to make these and they turned out very well. I mixed wet and dry per the recipe and then used the mixer to do all stirring and kneading. I kneaded a few times out of the mixer, though. I also subbed half oil and half butter because I didn't have enough of the latter. I can't tell if that adversely effected the recipe.

A note: I made 8 rolls and they turned out humongous and very dense and heavy. They were absolutely delicious but hilariously large. Cannot wait to make normal, human sized buns.

This is my go to recipe for hamburger buns and the only change in ingredients I make is to use half whole wheat flour & half all-purpose. After reading the reviews I always leave the dough to rise for an hour or so before punching down and forming into twelve balls. I leave these to rise for another 30 minutes. Then, before putting in the oven, I do a light egg and water wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. My family loves these buns!! Thank you for the recipe.

OMG are these good.  I made them using my bread machine, divided the dough and shaped them.  Thought they would be small but boy was I wrong!  While proofing in my oven for 30 minutes they grew tremendously.  After baking and cooling a bit my husband and I were anxious to cut one open.  The texture was perfect and the taste was wonderful.  We will never be buying store bought again.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I made this according to the recipe and I must say, the buns did sort of work, but they were incredibly dense, heavy and the crusts were quite tough. From what I've noticed is, the people who praise this recipe, used a bread machine or a mixer, so might have something to do with the way I kneaded it for 8 minutes.

Outstanding! My husband and my father in law love these rolls/buns. I must say I was a bit nervous after the kneading, which I did with my KitchenAide, and then put out onto a floured surface. It was still kind of sticky, but elastic. It all comes together beautifully. Thank you so much! BTW I did make 16  a few were smaller for those who don't ear much bread but 16 really is the number. And the flattening is the best hint ever. Makes them just the right size.

Like other reviewers, I found these buns too dense for my preference, even after extra rising time. That said, they were soft, and edible. We used these to serve slow cooker venison and they held up well (I suspect it would be similar for pulled pork or BBQ meats). After feedback from others on size, I decided to make a double batch, with 8 pieces rather than 12 per batch, for a total of 16.

These are the best rolls I've ever made. They're so soft and fluffy on the inside...I had to test one as soon as it came out of the oven and put a little butter on it...they were intended to be hamburger buns but they may not last long enough for the hamburger to be ready. They're just simply delicious.

These rolls/buns are great!  I brushed with egg & added sesame seeds the first time.  I also let rise 30min after I kneaded, but before I shaped into buns.  And then I forgot to let it rise one last time after I shaped the buns, but before baking them.  They were very tasty that first time, but also rather dense and kind of gooey.  The second round I remembered to let them rise both times (30min each time) and skipped the egg/sesame seeds.  They were light and fluffy and absolutely delicious!  Make sure you knead the dough a loooong time.  That is part of the secret to light & fluffy bread. :)

PERFECT!   turned out just like the picture.    Note:  I followed advice from two baker's feedback
1)  be sure to use your mixer/kitchen aid to do the mixing/kneading. this puts tiny air bubbles into your dough - making your finished product light & airy - not dense.    
2)  be sure to let your dough rise for about an hour, before shaping into rolls.   
THIS IS A KEEPER!   I'm making my 5th batch today

Took these to a barbecue and everyone raved how good they were.
Used the last bit of dough for some fresh cinnamon buns great dough for these also.
Will definitely make these again & again.

2016.06.14 - I just stuck these in the oven.  I followed all instructions except that I used one tablespoon of rapid-rise (not bread machine) yeast (as opposed to the 2.25 tsp equivalent of a packet) and I heated my wet ingredients in the microwave (15 sec = 5 degrees for last adjustments).  Other reviews say to do two rises and let rise for much longer, but I found the instructions given (one rise only, and that is after shaping) made MASSIVE rolls in just half an hour when covered by a damp dish towel in an oven preheated to 170F and turned off.  I can't wait to see how these taste!  I made 10 rolls - 4 with 1/2 the dough, 6 with the other 1/2, thinking that maybe the 6-size would be too small for DBF.  It looks like 6-size would be perfect for him and maybe 8-size would be better for hamburger buns.  Wow! - ETA: DBF approves!  "This is really good bread."

The dough hardly rose at all and the author said the hotdog buns would be "very large" and so I could make 16. I made 12 and they are smaller than average. Won't make again.

I used 1 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and the rest bread flour. It was too much flour. Also, the dough should rise twice once before and after shaping the buns. Next time, I'll use my bread machine and use the dough cycle. Then, I'll shape the buns and let rise so more.

This turned out delicious but I didn't give it five stars due to reading many reviews and deciding that I had to use my own experience in bread making when prepping this dough.  I do not believe that following the directions as written would have yielded good results.  I kept the ingredients the same but found that I didn't need as much flour as the recipe called for, I used about 3.75 Cups.  After kneading I let the dough rise, covered, in an oiled bowl, until doubled.  I wanted large hoagie style rolls so I then divided the dough into 6 pieces that were 6.5 oz. each.  After shaping I allowed them to rise again until almost doubled (to allow for oven spring), brushed with egg wash and sprinkled dried minced onion on top.  These rolls baked for 20 minutes, turned out  absolutely gorgeous with a nice soft crumb, and they are totally delicious!  Posted a pic :)

Really nice recipe.  Used bread machine dough cycle to prep dough, then shaped and cooked in oven.  As per my bread machine instructions I added all wet ingredients first along with the butter cut in small pieces then the dry ingredients and finally the yeast (2 1/4 tsp SAF Gold instant yeast).  Had to add 2 T of flour extra to get proper dough consistency but thats not unusual.  The main thing is look at the dough while it's in the bread machine and adjust as it kneads. All ingredients were at room temperature.  Let rise for 1 hour after shaping covered with oiled plastic wrap.  Made 6 hamburger buns and 8 hot dog buns.  Turned out great.  Will definitely make again.

Note:  The bread machine dough cycle includes a rise, so if making by hand or with dough hook allow to rise before shaping  and then let rise again before baking.

I don't have instant yeast. So  I tried 15 grams of dry yeast.  It went good. The texture was not perfect but the taste was great.

These are perfect buns.  They are soft just like the store ones without that funky off-flavor. I needed to let mine rise slightly longer (about an hour), though I suspect in the warmer summer months (when I make these for burgers) the 30 minute rising time will be just right. I used mine for pulled-pork sandwiches. Very easy and worth the effort.

We fancied making some burger buns today and spotted this recipe.  Bought the ingredients from the local store in New Zealand.  My girlfriend has made bread before and informed me we needed "strong flour" rather than just plain.  With a fair bit of needing and allowing maybe an hour to rise - the buns turned out great!  We made 6 "normal" size buns, plus 2 big baps (1/8th dough each) and tried a hot-dog bun and plaited bun too.  Our flat mate enjoyed them too.  I've uploaded a collage of us making them too somewhere here.

This is a staple in our home now. Usually, we make rolls from the dough. The weight of the mixed dough is normally about 1200 grams, so we make 30 rolls at about 40 grams each. For breakfast kolaches, we let the rolls rise first. Then we use a small spoon to create a dip in the dough and fill with favorite pie filling. Great and flexible recipe.

I founs that sifting or aerate your flour before measuring you'll get a lighter, much nicer texture bun.

These are so delicious!  I will agree with others, they take longer to rise than the recipe said, about one hour, and the cooking time was definitely more than 30 minutes.  But they looked beautiful and tasted yummy, so I felt really proud of myself for producing these beauties.  Next time, I will try them in the bread machine.

DO OVER. I think I killed the yeast with my liquids being to hot.  I made tasty breadsticks but they were dense. I will give an updated review after I make this recipe again.

These buns are delicious!  I have made them a number of times.  The first time following the recipe.  The only thing I have changed is letting the dough rise once in a greased bowl until doubled.  The end product is a softer bun.

Made these in a bread machine on the Dough cycle following the recommended order by my bread machine. put the warmed liquids in first with the beaten egg then added the dry ingredients. Next I  sprinkled the yeast on top.  My bread machine dough cycle is 1:20 minutes and includes a rise. when done I punched down the dough, turned it out on a greased sheet. cut into 8 parts. formed 8 balls and slightly flattened them. I let them rise for 35 minutes. Then followed the recipe from step 4. Turned out Awesome! I was very impressed with the results and so was my family. This was worth the effort. I am freezing 4 of them so I will find out how good these freeze and update if possible.

I made a big mistake by making this recipe, now my family says "no way" to store bought buns. Unfortunately for me, they are correct.  These buns are awesome.  Works best for extra long buns for the extra long hot dogs from Howie's Ranch Market in San Gabriel, CA (best in CA). Thank you for the recipe, made just as listed...Sublime!!!

These where great for burger buns but for hot dog but I found them a bit to crumbly. I did the mixing/kneading by hand, not sure if It need more kneading or more rise time. Overall it was pretty easy and tasted pretty good.

I just made these today for my husband to take BBQ pulled beef buns to work. They are sooo good, I ate one by itself. When I took them out of the oven I brushed them with butter and let them cool.

Tried this recipe twice. First time, followed the exact recipe. Second time, incorporated several tips and tricks taught to me by a bread baker. Both times the buns never rose. If you're looking to make albino hockey pucks, here you go. If you want hamburger buns I'd try a different recipe.

So I tried this recipe using a gluten free flour mix and rice milk, due to gluten and lactose intolerance. Butter usually doesn't bother me so I kept that in my recipe. BUT I used a bread maker like everyone else on the Dough cycle who said it was so "easy" and my dough came out extremely sticky... I ended up having to a ton of extra flour to make them even rollable.

I really liked this recipe.  I also like other reviewers let it rise twice.
A few reviewers said it came out heavier than they liked... and that maybe they should have used more yeast.  I don't think that that is necessarily the answer.  If you have not used your yeast in a while you may want to proof it before you use it in your recipe.  Of course proofing means a teaspoon of yeast or so in a 1/4 cup of warm water(110 to 115 degrees) to make sure it is going to grow adequately.  You can even add a bit of sugar to help feed it along.  If your yeast is old your bread will not rise and become light.  Also I find if you do not add all the flour all at once you are better off.  Work just enough flour in so that the dough is tacky to the touch... not sticky...just tacky.  This will ensure that you do not add to much flour which would make your buns dry and dense and more flat.  This recipe has great flavor.  I will be making it again.

The flavor was great!  However, they didn't rise very well.  After the first batch, I did a second, using a little more yeast (yes, it was fresh-I checked this time!) and still flat.  I'm not going to give up though, I plan to tweak it a bit and see if I can get the beautiful buns that others have :) Will update when I get it right!

Best recipe I've found for burger/hot dog buns.  These are light, fluffy and very tasty.  Don't know if it made a difference, but I let my dough rise in a greased bowl for 45 minutes before shaping and letting rise for an additional 30 minutes.

I love this recipe.  I made them for the first time.  They don't look anything like the picture.  Haha they will look more like buns the next time.   I used salted butter instead and omitted the salt.

Great recipe! Way to impress guest! Absolutely gorgeous! The crum, inside, was they way a hamburger bun should be, it was light, flaky, and held up to my hamburgers. I want to cut the buns in half, instead of making a total of 12 I would make 24 mini buns, and do hamburger sliders for an appetizer at my husbands next football party! I let the Dough rise for about two hours ( I forgot to slightly press down). Also I activated the yeast with the milk, water and sugar for about 10 min. I also added the egg and melted butter to the flour and mixed with my stand mixer before adding the milk /yeast mixture. They came out great. I did add about 5 cups flour. The Dough was slightly sticky but easier to work with.

Everything you could wish for in a hamburger bun!  Light, fluffy, and delicious.  I used my bread machine for the kneading and let it rise for an hour instead of the half hour.  This is definitely my new go to recipe.  No more store bought for us!

Tried these today as hot dog buns, turned out very well except it took about 3 times longer to rise than recipe stated.  But I find that's true with all of the roll/bun recipes I've tried so it could just be me. Anyway, once I let them rise long enough, I baked as directed and they came out perfectly! I made them to serve with bratwurst rather than hot dogs and I think they are very well suited to brats, heavy enough not to fall apart on you but still light and only ever so slightly chewy! Also, while they do taste good on their own, they won't over power anything your serving them with (burgers, hot dogs, brats, Italian sausage, etc.) I only need six buns for dinner tonight, so I froze the rest, hopefully they'll stand up to the freezer because these were yummy!

This didn't rise for me but I think it's because I tried it with active dry yeast instead of instant yeast and I didn't proof it long enough. Going to try again because I'm pretty sure it was my bad rather than the recipes. Will alter rating/review once I do so.

I have made these a couple of times and they have turned out great.  I did things slightly different than the instructions state. Specifically, I proofed my yeast and let the dough rise for an hour before I formed it into rolls to rise a second time.  Good flavor and texture overall and I will definitely make again.

Awesome bun recipe.  I was able to make twelve good-sized hamburger/sandwich buns from this recipe.  The only change in ingredients I made was to use olive oil in place of butter as I don't have butter.  I made the dough, let it rise in an oiled bowl for fourty-five minutes before punching down.  Then I shaped twelve rolls, which I flattened slightly into discs about the size of a hockey puck and laid them out on waxed paper close together to rise for another thirty to forty-five minutes.  Once they had risen to the size I wanted, I brushed them with a mixture of milk and egg yolk while I preheated my oven and a pizza stone on the bottom rack in the oven to 400F.  Then I popped them in on the middle rack for eleven minutes - turning the pan around half-way through baking time.  They came out PERFECT!  I'll be using them for burgers and sandwiches this week.

These are so good, infinitely better than anything bought in the store.  The hour and a half time is also accurate.  Definitely making these again.

I had high hopes for these buns after reading the reviews, however I was quite disappointed. I tried to make them into hot dog buns, however the buns were extremely dense, had a pale color, and didn't finish cooking long after the recommended cooking time.

These where ok, not the flavor I was searching for though and a little denser than what I hoped (that could have been my fault though) over all it was good, thank you!

One minor tweek.  Use EGG WASH on the buns before baking for the sesame seeds & make sure you have some water in the oven so they get nice light and fluffy.  They need humidity.  If you have an old oven like me...these tips come in handy.

I had a few issues with these the first time I made them.  Usually I allow them to rise twice now before baking and this gives me more than the yeild but also a bigger bun.  My kids however, cannot get enough.  They're always asking me to make more.  I have 4 kids and a carb-loving husband, so these are gone as soon as they're cool enough to eat.

I tried this recipe , and was expecting soft and fluffy. What I got was dense bread like the texture of french bread. What did I do wrong? I followed the recipe to a T.

I made this hoping for a great Bun recipe but ended up with a pretty good bicuit instead. I may try it again and follow the procedure more closely next time. The end result I came out with looked nothing like the picture... then again, judging from all the other pics sent in by users, it would seem that no one gets the same result. Like I said, it wasn't what I'd consider a bun but more of a bicuit... at least for a biscuit it was a pretty good one... great with butter and jam and probably good for a chicken sandwich.

Followed the recipe exactly with all freshly bought ingredients, the only thing that was different was that I used whole wheat flour which I compensated time and used a little less flour. The result, the buns did not rise at all and did not fully bake through even with doubling the cooking time (probably because it was so darn dense!) Definitely not going to try this recipe again.

This is a great recipe. I use my bread machine dough setting & have changed the ingredients a bit to make it healthier. Instead of 4 1/2 c. All-Purpose flour, I use 1 c. Unbleached Bread flour, 3 c. Whole Wheat flour, & 1/2 c. Rolled Oats. Increase milk by about 2 T. & yeast to 2 1/2 t. I also replace the butter w/Coconut Oil.

Tip: place the dough in a bowl with a towel over it and set it on top of a hot water-bottle. The dough will rise better this way.

My husband was eating the buns even without the burgers in them.  I made a completely whole wheat version since that was the only flour I had.  I just sifted it so to help it not be too dense.  They came out perfect.  Denser but still a fluffy bun.

Wow these are good!!! I followed the recipe for the most part but used my food processor for the mixing and kneading (less mess to clean up) and I followed Camilea's advice and let it rise for an hour in a bowl, shape the buns then let the rise for another hour. I did this because I did not have instant yeast, it worked well.  These are wonderful, I can't imagine wanting store bought buns again.

Made these tonight.  Followed recipe and one reviewer that suggested putting dough in a bowl and letting it rise for 1 hour and then shape into buns and let rise another hour.  I never made bread of any kind before.  But these did come out very soft and taste good.  Next time I will just try the way of the recipe and see if shaping them and letting them rise for just 30 minutes makes any difference....I also had some dark spots on mine and my hubby said that was from air bubbles but I don't know...all the photos people posted here look perfect and no dark spots! I guess I have some more learning to do.  I will make these again!

120 degrees is where yeast starts to die. 140 and it is dead. DO NOT heat the milk that hot. The result will be bread that barely rises (since you have killed half the yeast.) 100 degrees is perfect. These were way too dense for hot dog buns. The dog squeezes out of the bun when you bite into it. There were great dinner rolls however.

These were okay, but a bit bland (an issue I often have with homemade yeast breads, so maybe it's somehow me). They were also a bit dense, but froze well, and looked beautiful. Might try again with more sugar/salt and a bit more yeast. Thanks!

I didn't really care for the taste of these. I used part whole wheat flour, but there was nothing special about them...I am not sure what it was that didn't do it for me...but it just seems to be an okay recipe.

This turned out great, like other people have said a little dense, but they turned out great, and everyone at my bbq loved them.  I only say dense because it was more like a bun than bread and people might expect it to be like light fluffy bread.  I did let the dough rise for about 3-4 hrs each time I made this and I think this helped a lot, and then after  I shaped them let them rise for another hour.  I made hot dog and hamburger buns, both were great. I also used slightly less flour than the recipe called for .

Thanks for this great recipe. I have tried many bread recipes but this is by far the best in terms of time, taste and texture. I needed the buns asap and I made it all within the hour. I guess I like the fact that by half an hour it had risen and ready to be baked. Although the buns feel heavy, they were so soft and scrumptious. Thank you Sally.

Best. Burger buns. EVER!!!

I have never made my own burger buns before, and these turned out beyond perfect. I was a little unsure on how big to make them as I didn't know how much they would rise, so the sizes were a little all over the place. 
I did not have instant yeast, so as someone else suggested I used 4 tsp regular yeast, proofed it and let the dough rise twice. It rose so fast I could literally watch the buns get bigger. Oh, and I also brushed them with egg white before baking.
They were dense, as so many others have stated, but not too dense. They came out so soft and fluffy on the inside that it didn't matter. And I found it nice to have dense buns versus the usual cotton ball store bought buns. I also did not think that they were too sweet. I thought they were quite perfect. And so did the kids and the hubby.

For serving I sliced them, brushed them with a little butter, then toasted them on the griddle until nice and golden brown.

I will never buy buns again, nothing comes even close to these. And they were incredibly fast and easy to make. I can't wait to try them for hotdogs.

(Btw, leftover buns are delicious with some honey butter.)

So yummy, so simple to make.  The only thing I do differently is that I let the dough rise after making/kneading in a greased and covered bowl-- once it has risen after about an hour I punch it down and then go onto step three.  After making this a couple of times I am finally getting the hang of shaping hot dog buns.  We don't ever bother purchasing hamburger or hotdog buns at the store now that I've started using this recipe.

Made a half batch using the portion adjustment option built into the site because I live alone and could never eat that many at once.

I kneeded them for the time it said to, and let them rise covered in a towel for 45 minutes.

After baking for 15 they still hadn't really risen. Very disappointed, guess I messed it up somehow.

These were very tasty. A bit dense, but still tasty. I would make them again. We used these for homemade turkey burgers. With the leftovers, we just warmed them in the microwave and ate them with our meals for the next few days.

I've been making these hot dog buns for years now and they never fail to impress. I use bread flour and just throw it all in the bread machine on dough cycle. Once I shape them I let them rise until nice and puffy and then bake for exactly 8 minutes. They are wonderful the next day for sandwiches. Although its hard to make them last that long since the kids and husband grab them off the cooling rack to eat plain!

These were a hit! They were stealing them before dinner time. I forgot to flatten them a bit, so they came out round and more like rolls, but they tasted so good, no one complained!

We were snowed in today and decided we wanted hamburgers but had no hamburger rolls.  I found this recipe!  I followed step 1 and then added everything to a bread machine and set on the dough setting.  Once that was done I followed the rest of the steps.  made 6 burger rolls and 6 hot dogs.  We will definitely be making these again.

My kids love sandwiches made on these buns.  I make mine with 1/2 whole wheat flour and  1/4 cup ground flax seed per single recipe.  Very easy recipe and the dough is wonderful to work with.  I let mine rise about 10 minutes before flattening.  Works great.

The taste is not at all like hot dog buns and they were very heavy and much thicker and denser than traditional hot dog buns. I made these by hand, not in a bread machine.

These are AMAZING!! My entire family, including 2 children under the age of 5 LOVED these. They were fantastic just by themselves as well as with the black bean veggie burgers I made (also from this site). I am a pretty experienced baker, but I am a novice bread maker. I used my bread machine's dough setting. My dough ended up being kind of sticky, but I added some flour to keep it from sticking to my hands and I was able to shape them decently. This must be a very forgiving recipe as they looked quite nice when they came out of the oven. There is a video tutorial on these, which I watched after making mine, and they show the butter as being melted. Mine was just softened butter, but they still turned out beautifully! This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is wonderful!!!  I heated the milk, water, sugar and butter in a saucepan and then added them to the bread maker with the yeast.  After 10 min I added the beaten egg, salt and flour (1 1/2 C bread flour and  3 C APF).  Ran the dough cycle, punched down and shaped into 16 hot dog buns.  Let rise until doubled, applied egg wash and baked.  Super light and fluffy with a crunchy exterior!  The best homemade buns yet.

Have made these now 3 times. Always they are perfect, soft and delicious. This last time I did a cold rise for a slower fermentation. They were even lighter. The texter was so soft! These are the best buns I have ever tasted. I also used some of my Amish starter (recipe on this site) rather than the yeast. Gave a depth of flavor they didn't have before. I added a half cup of the starter instead of the water and added it after the Milk and butter was at temp. The starter was added once the milk/butter was added to the first flour mixture. I only cooked the milt to 110 degrees, I was worried about killing the yeast. Our wild yeast here is more like a sourdough but the Amish starter uses milk and sugar so it is a nice sweet starter with a delicate yet slightly sweet taste. Gave the buns an incredible flavor.

I actually watched the video first and figured it looked easy enough.  I even subbed in 1 cup of whole white wheat flour. I forgot to add the egg and it still came out pretty good (not super soft). I also had to put the butter mix in the refrigerator to cool it down to 120.

So....I found that 120F is way to hot, and just might have killed my yeast.  Another reviewer also noted that if the liquid is too hot to touch, then it will kill the yeast.  Anyhow, this made decent cracker style pizza dough.  Also, the yeast fermenting might not create enough warmth.  So I was advised to turn on the oven at the lowest setting, and then turn it off.  The temperature should be between 80-90F when you put the dough inside to rise.  You should be able to keep your hand in the oven for a few minutes.  I will try again with new yeast, and update my review. Thank goodness I only made half the recipe.

This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as specified except I put in 2 teaspoons of salt. I put the ingredients in my bread machine and used my dough cycle. Once the dough had rested for 10 minutes, I worked it until it was able to shape it into rectangle and instead of forming balls of dough and flattening them, I just used a big round biscuit cutter to make each bun.  I let them rise another 1/2 hour and they came out perfect.  I did rub butter on them when they came out of the oven to keep the crust soft. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I have made this a number of times and I'm getting better at it each time. It’s great, my kids love it. Now they don’t want me to buy bread from the store anymore. Thank you.
Ps. Different flour has different taste and rise also.

These turned out great! I used my stand mixer with the dough hook and, per suggestion of a review, I added 1/2 tbs. more yeast. They had a great texture and browned nicely. I'll make these again for sure!

The bread didn't rise at all so they were small and dense.  My best guess would be that 120 deg. is too hot and after scalding the milk you should let it cool to 105-108.  The flavor was great though.  I might make this again and brush  them with butter and garlic for breadsticks.

Ok so I need advice...I tried these last night and they didnt rise? and when I baked them they were dense and dull....on the bright side I tried a little bit of the crust from the bottom (only part that cooked) and they were delicious. Help? what did I do wrong? I followed it to the T :/

They were delicious. The bread was dense.  So the mystery continues on how to make it less dense.  I blame that on my end, not the recipe.  I did warm up the butter and milk and added it to the bread machine.  The bread machine kneaded the dough for 55 minutes and it was a 1 hour rise in the machine.  I punched it, shaped it and did a 2nd rise for 1 hour.

Oh wow, this is definitely going to be my go-to recipe for buns! Having tried some other recipes, these are far more what I think of when I think "hamburger bun" or "hot dog bun": light, fluffy and flavorful! 

I'd have given a full 5 stars, except the recipe definitely needs a bit of tweaking: namely, a full double-rise will give much better results. 

Made a half-batch for hot dogs, followed the mixing instructions exactly (I did end up needing almost 1/4 cup more flour than recommended, even after liberally flouring my counter), and then set the dough in a greased bowl to rise for an hour. I punched it down, shaped it into hot-dog rolls, covered it with a paper towel and let it rise for 35 minutes more before baking. 

Absolutely worth the extra time, though: these turned out DELICIOUS!

Excellent rolls.  I followed advice of other review and did double rise.  I made the mistake of only making 8 rolls but that was good because my burgers were huge.

It's pretty amazing that I am able to review this recipe as 5 stars considering the mistakes I made. First thing I did wrong was to mix up the water and milk amounts. I added 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk. Then, I forgot to add the egg. I think what saved these rolls was that I had my liquid temperature right and I kneaded them thoroughly until elastic, as instructed. I let them rise for about 2 hours though. I wasn't expecting greatness considering my mistakes but the rolls came out pretty darn good. I believe if I had followed the directions properly they would be exceptional. Maybe next time I will let them rise a little longer too for really light rolls. This recipe is a keeper for sure- especially since I know I can make all sorts of mistakes with it. ;-) 

Thanks for sharing!

Love this! They came out great BUT you have to let them rise for longer than 30min. I'd say hour and half to two hours. Then they are PERFECT! I'd eat them without anything in or on them! :)

excellent buns.... turned out wonderful... I let mine rise a for extra time about half an hour in the bowl... divided rolled into balls flattened and let rise for another 45 minutes if you have the time i definitely suggested it..... i brushed mine with an egg white wash and sprinkled with sesame seeds and poppy seeds... great presentation... great texture.... great taste....

These were ok, I followed the recipe exactly and came out with buns that were too small for burgers.  I let the rolls rise for about 40 minutes and made 12 rolls.  I guess if I try it next time I will make bigger rolls and let them rise for at least an hour.  The rolls were good taste wise, but were very dense.  I was looking for more of a crusty style roll for my burgers, but this one was worth trying.  Would be great as a dinner roll.

I made this and they did look great but they were very dense. Not sure what I did wrong because I followed the recipe.  I am looking for more of a roll type bun. This was too heavy.

Made this for my house and my dad said he doesn't want store bought bread anymore!!!
Really great recipe, the easiest i have ever done for bread especially with yeast. Quick prep, all round easy to do.
I am a swapper though, so i used multigrain flour, 1/4 cups of diary milk and 3.4 of silk soya milk. 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil and 1 1/2 tbsp of brown sugar and it came out great :). 
Thanks for this recipe, it will be a weekly special for me from now.

These were pretty tasty, though the crusts on the bottom were slightly hard.  We ate these with brats, but they'd be great for burgers because they wouldn't get soggy.  Overall, the taste was good.  I did use bread flour instead of all-purpose, and that made the inside texture very fluffy.

These are unbelievably good.  I now use the bread maker to do a perfect proofing job on the rolls and let them do a second rise before baking for the 10 minutes.  They are astounding!

These are delicious!  My family just loves them.  Recipe makes 8 large hamburger buns or 12 medium buns.  Just make sure to flatten them before they rise as the recipe says, I forgot once and wound up with big round dinner rolls.  Delicious but not ideal for burgers.  They are equally delicious as hot dog buns.

I expected a little more from this recipe after reading so many great reviews.  I don't think these are as good as the other homemade hotdog/burger bun recipe I have.  The dough tasted great, but the actual buns are a tad too sweet and heavier/denser than I'd like.  If I were to try these again, I would probably round the yeast up to 3tsp and let them rise longer.  I might also substitute potato starch for some of the flour.  I'd also recommend watching them closely - my husband turned off the timer without telling me, so my first pan cooked a few minutes longer than I would have liked.  They were a rich brown color instead of lightly golden, and that made the crust rather tough (not what you want in a burger or hot dog bun).  The second pan came out at the right time and had a better texture to the crust.

These buns are fantastic.  I swapped some of the all purpose flour for wheat flour and they're still amazing.  Great recipe.  Can't go back to store bought after making these.

I just took my buns out of the oven!  They look beautiful to me.  They're not as light as I would have liked,  the flavor was mellow and nice. I did use 2 cups of bread flour/ 2 all purpose flour and I used my bread machine ! :)  Maybe that had something to do with it.  My husband and son really enjoyed them. I will follow recipe exactly next time. Thanks for sharing Sally

I ruined the first batch as the dough didn't rise.  I think the thermometer I was using for the liquid didn't give me an accurate reading and it was too hot.  I was more careful with my second batch and followed some of the reviews which advised to allow for a longer rising time.  I let the dough rise while loosely covered in the oven for about an hour and fifteen minutes.  The buns tasted great but were quite dense for hamburger buns.

My family ate the entire 16 hot dog buns in ONE day!  They were soft, delicious and just the right size for the kids.  My husband said he would love them without hot dogs, and a sweet glaze, like a doughnut.  I now need to make another batch for tonight!!

I was so surprised that these came out so well! So, so much better than store bought. They're so delicious, nice and soft but heavy (not dense!) enough for a good burger patty. I halved the recipe and made 4 good sized hamburger buns. I kept all the ingredients the same, but assembled it a little differently - I warmed only the milk and butter together and let it cool to lukewarm before adding it to the dough mixture. I proofed the yeast for 10-15 minutes in the warm water and added the sugar there to feed the yeast. I also let the dough rise for 2 hours in a greased bowl before shaping into buns. I'll definitely be making these the next time I have burgers!

Wow, these came out really well. I was afraid of the result since I made some substitutions. Even with the substitutions it came out yummy with nice texture. I used whey instead of milk, olive oil instead of butter, active dry yeast in place of instant and didn't have any eggs so subbed with 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 1 Tbsp water. The buns came out a nice golden color and the texture was heavy but not dense so holds up well once a hamburger patty and all the fixings are in it. I will be using this recipe again.

Easy, flexible, and fool-proof. First time I used it I followed the recipe exactly, except I let the dough rise twice, once before shaping the buns and once after. Fantastic result and so easy. Second time I used 25% whole wheat flour.  Again, a great result. Third time I replaced the butter with 1/4 c. olive oil (to reduce sat. fat) and used 50% whole wheat flour. The hamburger buns are still excellent, light and fluffy in spite of the whole wheat flour. I plan to use this recipe weekly for healthy sandwich rolls for school lunch.  Thanks so much!

Sally, I made these last night via my bread machine. I only added 1 tbsp gluten as a change. I let the machine do the mixing, kneading and first rise. Then I made hotdog buns out of them. Followed your advice and made 16. Perfect! They came out soft, chewy, and delicious! A keeper of a recipe, thanks for sharing! :) Alynxia

I made these for a BBQ party. Everyone loved the burgers, but they were blown away by the buns. These are great compared to the other bun recipes I have tried on here. They are surprisingly easy to make also, defiantly a keeper.

this recipe really isn't that great. First of all, the directions are wrong, it states that you should heat the liquids until very hot and that is false. the liquids should only be heated until lukewarm or else it will kill the yeast right away. Next, it needs more rising time. An additional hour before you shape them into balls is a good idea. Against my better judgement I made this following the instructions, I guess that's what happens when it's hot out and I try to cook.

I proofed the yeast and made this in my bread maker on the dough cycle.  I split it up into hotdog and hamburger buns.  I also used half wheat flour and half white flour.

Great recipe, I have made this regularly with perfect results.  I make it with half wheat and half white flour and use my bread machine to mix the dough. I just make sure to let it rise quite a bit before baking.

These buns are good, I've tried at both the hot dog and hamburger buns, and only succeeded in the hamburger buns... When the instructions say to ROLL the hot dog bun up, it really means to FOLD IT over :) I figured it out eventually!

These tasted great; the whole family enjoyed them.  They definitely smell good cooking.  I didn't need all the flour... not even close.  I worked in all but about 3/4 of a cup but that was more than I should have.  I was worried because I couldn't get them smooth but they still looked pretty good baked.  I'd make less than 12 next time... weren't quite big enough for a big burger.

These were super easy to throw together on a late Saturday afternoon on a whim.  I used whole wheat flour (mixed with a little all-purpose) and used my heavy-duty mixer with a dough hook, which readied the dough in just a few minutes (probably less).  I didn't time the rise, just let them get to the size I wanted (more like an hour than 30 minutes).  A quick bake and they came out perfectly DELICIOUS!! Soft and hearty but not too dense (always my concern.) It took our impromptu barbecue to another level, having the homemade buns give the burgers a more gourmet look, feel and taste.  I can tell we'll use these again and again!

I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and although they didn't rise as quickly, they were still delicious and easy to make.  Much nicer than store bought whole wheat buns with all the preservatives.

These turned out fantastic with a lovely buttery taste. I also used my breadmaker's dough cycle. The ones complaining that they are heavy and dense must have had a bad batch of yeast or something. These will be replacing store buns for our family! Each batch easily yields 20 buns for me.

I am eating these buns hot out of the oven right now. They are fluffy and I'm in love with them.It did take a long time for the dough to rise, and I did two risings. I used Winco bulk yeast and probably is why it took so long, next time I'll try a better yeast. But these are the best ever. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Great recipe for the breadmachine.  Proofed the yeast with the milk, water and margarine (didn't use butter); then added ingredients in order directed by the machine; Set to dough cycle and baked as directed in the recipe.  Will definetly make again.  Thanks
UPDATE:  Added 1/2 cup ground flax in place of 1/2 cup flour and added onion salt and flakes makes it a 5+ recipe

These turned out wonderful. They were light and fluffy.  I let them rise an hour before forming them and then a half hour after forming them.  They didn't make as many as the recipe said, I only got 6 hamburger buns and 4 hotdog buns out of the recipe.  This could be due to the altitude here though (5000ft. up).

Not a bad roll.  Not quite what I was looking for but decent enough.  I bloomed the yeast separately with the water and sugar before adding in as its what I'm more comfortable with and to check it was alive, but other than that I made them as instructed

I used the breadmaker to make the dough for these, as I had several other things on the go at the same time. I only used 1T of sugar and would go with that another time. As described the rolls were beautifully soft. Thanks Sally I will use this recipe again.

this recipe is a keeper, the freshly baked buns added a very nice flavor to my burger. they were very fluffy and tasty. I did`t change any thing except for waiting for the dough to double in size (it took one hour)and then I followed the recipe exactly. thank u for sharing this amazing recipe.

Nope. Flat, dense and heavy. They just didn't really rise (and I primed my yeast, too). While the flavor was okay, they just weren't buns. Also, the number of servings is way off, unless you like tiny buns. Just didn't work for me at all.

they were pretty nice, but they had this differrent taste than the store bought ones which doesnt make them technically bread but more tasting like pastries. i followed some of the advice in the reviews as i was using active dry yeast so i let the yeast proof with some warm milk and sugar first, mixed all ingredients let it proof then shaped it and proofed it again.

This really is an excellent recipe, one of the best roll dough recipes I have found to date... I did do a few substitutions which I will list here. that turned out wonderful... First in the 4 1/2 cups of all purpose flour I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour to ad just a touch of flavor and body... Instead of regular milk I used Silk soy milk.... Also I activated the yeast in the 1/2 cup of 110% water... Flour, salt into the mixer bowl.. as the milk, sugar and butter ( I used real butter )just melted the butter in a small sauce pan and the yeast activated... I beat the egg seperately... Mixer on low with the dough hook, I added the milk and butter  mixture to the flour, then the egg and finally the yeast... mixing it into a VERY sticky dough... I then took it to the counter and worked in enough flour to where it made a nice soft dough ball... I placed that into a greased bowl and let it rise in the oven... NO heat just the light on and a pan of hot water under it for an hour... Also I do not cover My dough when proofing it.... Not required. After that I punched it down and back at the counter formed my rolls .... absolutely wonderful... :)

I hate those of the shelf from the markets because it is too small! I like my patties big and thick, so this recipe allows me to customize to the size I like. The bun is nice and soft, and smells very good!!! Highly recommended for burger lovers!

These buns were spectacular. I confess that I switched to bread flour because that's what I had on hand. I tossed everything in the bread machine, let it go through the bread cycle, cut it into rolls and let them rise for a bit over an hour. Excellent, I'll make these many times.

These were excellent!  My boyfriend made a beef burger and I made a turkey burger and both went great with this fluffy bun.  I used half wheat flour and substituted the butter for applesauce and only used egg whites for a fat free and healthier bun.  They still turned out perfect.  I froze the buns that were not used.  I will never buy hamburger or hotdog buns again!

Perfect, not too dense, easy to make. I do not think I will buy buns again. We made one batch of 16 yesterday and I am going to make another tonight. I am also going to try it as a loaf, sub rolls, or dinner rolls, just perfect.

These worked out better than I expected.  I started the dough in the bread machine and removed it after an hour (from an hour and a half dough cycle) and then cut 12 roughly equal sized pieces and shaped them according to the directions for hot dog buns.  I found it best not to flour the counter when patting them into roughly 6 x 4 rectangles before rolling, so that they stuck together better.  I placed them on a prepared baking sheet and covered them with plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray.  They took another 1/2 hour to 45 minutes to double in size (and I had them sitting on top of a warm oven).  The four stars is because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the time estimate is much shorter than it actually needs to be for proper rising of the buns.  They baked up beautifully and were the perfect texture.  I will definitely make again, and maybe brush with butter and onions for onion rolls.  Yum!

Used white whole wheat flour (from King Arthur) and let it rise twice (ninety minutes and then thirty minutes).  These were good but not the best rolls I've ever made.  They were a bit too dense, but they had a nice flavor and froze well.

These have got to be the best buns I have made so far :)  I put it on dough cycle in the bread machine, then punched down and formed into buns and let rise again and baked them.  Delish hot out of the oven!

These turned out really well. I was afraid they'd risen too much but they were good.  Nice flavor. Held up pretty well to our burgers too.

Well, I killed my yeast on this one, so it started out bad, but I found adding the flour 1/2 cup at a time confusing and wished the recipe stated how many 1/2 cups you would have.  In spite of the fact that they were as heavy as baseballs, they still tasted ok!

I made half burger and half hot dog buns.  Not exactly sure what went wrong.  Maybe because I ran out of AP flour and so I used almost 1.5 cups of wheat flour and I used bread flour for kneading - my buns didn't rise as much as I thought they would so they were more like mini burger buns. The taste was o.k. They were not fluffy but not so dense like hockey pucks.  I'll try it again

I did a yeast starter with normal yeast (4 tsp) and then followed the directions otherwise exactly.  The buns were very light and fluffy and GREAT.  I only marked them down slightly because they really were more like a light dinner roll in consistency than a heavier bun, but they still tasted fantastic.

To dense to be considered a hotdog or burger bun. it's not terribly awful as a regular sandwich bread. all in all not my fave bread recipe but not the worst.

This is only the second bread that I have ever made. I did think they came out a little dense but I'm sure that's my lack of experience. My boyfriend loved them. So I will definately try these again.

These were the best!  I will never buy buns again.  The recipe was easy, and the end product was oh so yummy.  The only problem that I had was making the buns too big, but next time I will know how to do them right. Thanks for a great recipe.

These are the best hamburger buns I have ever made! They came out light and fluffy and they taste great. This will be the recipe I reach for every time. I did use bread flour instead of all purpose flour and I had to add a little more flour than it called for. Other than that I made it just as the recipe said.

My first attempt at making my own buns!  They were very good, but a little on the heavy side.  I didn't have any problem with them being too flat. I will make them again.  Hopefully I can get the "light and fluffy" buns that others got!

I made these for the first time today. They turned out delicious, but a little flat. I suggest ignoring the "flatten slightly" directive in step 3.

Also: Understand the difference between instant yeast and active dry yeast. This recipe calls for instant. It will need to be modified for active dry. Those who had bad results likely had yeast trouble.

These buns were GREAT. I used my bread machine, which made it so easy.  I made them a bit flatter them most buns because we do not like more meat then bun when having a hamburger. They did not get a bit soggy when we added all the wet condiments.  I will be using this for my hamburger and hot dogs from now on.

Don't know if I did something wrong... they were VERY heavy, not light like a hot dog/hamburger bun is typically.  Probably won't make again.

I stopped buying buns when I found this recipe. I use my bread machine and then add flour as needed but have found that the dough with less flour makes better buns. I also brush melted butter on them after cooking. I bake a lot of bread but once they are a few days old, I make them into croutons/bread crumbs. Nothing goes to waste!

This is a good base recipe for buns. However, it lacks the necessary procedures to get as close to store-bought squishiness as possible. To get that extra softness with the added dough enhancers and emulsifiers, a delayed-salt process is neccessary. This means that the salt is added after the first rise. This allows for better gluten structure.

Love this recipe!! It is so versatile, just shape the buns the way you want and bake. I've made sub rolls, hamburger and hot dog buns and even used this recipe to make dinner rolls. If I am making dinner rolls or subs, I use non-stick spray and coat between the buns. This keeps them from sticking together.

Based on other readers rave reviews, I'm sure it is just me and not the recipe, but mine came out really bad. I salvaged a few and just ate them with jelly, but they came out nothing like buns, more like hard biscuits and still weren't even cooked in the middle.

I used half whole wheat flour and they still turned out great! I brushed egg on the top and added sesame seeds to give them the authentic look. ;) Next time I will put the oven on a lower temperature and leave them in a little longer as the buns burned on the bottom but seemed barely baked on the top.

These were really easy and really good.  After we ate our sandwiches with them, we ate the rest as just bread rolls.  Yummy!  The only thing I would do different is maybe add a bit more sugar next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

They're good, but they taste more like dinner rolls than hamburger buns.  Still trying to find the perfect recipe.  These aren't bad, just not as good as I'd hoped.

My family gobbled these up before I had a chance to put a burger or dog in them.  A recipe I'll use again and again.

10 stars if you ask me. Never did I imagine that I could make hot dog & burger buns. I used my food processor w/ dough blade for the kneading. This required about 3/4 of the liquid. Other than that I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they came out beautifully. I divided the dough and made half burger and half hot dog buns. Thanks so much for this easy easy recipe.

This recipe was simply put: AWESOME!  Because I keep kosher I substituted the milk for water and the butter for oil.  I also squeezed the juice of half a lemon in.  I made it in my bread maker and then followed step 3 onward to spectacular buns.  I will never need to buy buns again.

Bless you! This is the 4th bun recipe I have tried, and they have never turned out for me until now! I brushed with egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds before they went in the oven and they looked/tasted totally professional!

These are fantastic! Nice flavor. These would also make great dinner rolls if you made them into smaller balls. I let it rise for an hour and then shaped them and let them rise again. I do that with all my bread doughs though. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

These buns were awesome.  I don't have much experience making yeast bread, but I had no trouble at all.  My kids didn't want to eat the burgers, they just wanted to eat the buns!

Warm milk and butter together and use warm tap water. In a big bowl mix 1 1/2 c flour, salt, 1 pkg quick rise yeast and 2 T sugar. Add warm liquids and mix. Add the egg. Then add in the rest of the flour 1/2 c at a time. Knead for what seems like forever. Don't make 6 huge buns anymore, go for the 12. Then let rise and bake.

If you follow the recipe to the "T" they are good dinner rolls. The rolls are very filling but pretty good. If you do what others have said about letting the dough rise for 1 hour before shaping them and another hour after shaping you would have good buns. I used my kitchen aid mixer b/c I do not own a bread machine so, results could be different with the use of a bread maker. I gave them a three because I intended to make burgers but, made spaghetti instead with the rolls.

Very Good!  My husband and I had chili cheese dogs with these buns and they were so good!  I followed the recipe to the T and loved how they turned out.  I did let the buns raise in a bowl after being mixed. The buns get really big, so you don't have to make very big dough rolls.  I loved the taste and the texture as well.

Yummy!  Why buy hot dog or hamburger buns again?  I mixed the dough in my bread machine and then formed into hamburger or hot dog buns and let rise and baked.  They were great.

I followed this recipe,I only changed  the rising time,I let them rise for an hour,they did'nt seem to have rised all that much however, I brushed with the egg solution and topped with sesame seeds they turned out looking perfect just like @lyssa's they did'nt really taste like any thing though. I do not know if I will be making them again,still looking.

Dad and Ron really like.  It makes 16 buns, not 12.  Allow to rise at least 20 minutes longer.

My hot dog buns turned out great.  I also did a first rise before cutting and shaping the dough.  They came out fluffy, smooth, and pretty.  Smelled so good that my dog stole one off the table even though she's usually so well behaved!
