I went out of town recently and for a family gathering I decided to make two of these chocolate chess pies.  They won absolutely RAVE reviews and several people commented they were the BEST chocolate pies that they had ever eaten.  I was impressed!!!

I made a couple changes to the original recipe.  First, I doubled the recipe and made only two 8" DEEP DISH pies from the doubled recipe, filling the unbaked crusts to the very top rim.

Second I baked the two pies for 12 minutes longer than the original recipe stated.

This recipe was very simple to make and it was also very delicious, however the texture wasn't so great it was a little stiff in a way can't really explain it but it wasn't as moist as I'd like and I also had to cook it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. But my family and I still enjoyed every bite of each pie.

I make these pies all the time.  Use a REGULAR sized pie crust.  There is not enough filling to cover two deep dish crusts.  You must use REAL butter, not margarine.  Make sure you follow the directions as printed.  Once the batter is mixed, pour into the two crusts very fast.  The batter separates very quickly due to the 4 eggs and large amount of butter.  Cook the pies a little longer than recommended to make sure the center is cooked.  When you cut into the cooled pie, you should see two layers.  The chocolate layer on top and the custard layer that settles to the bottom.  I had to make this recipe several times to perfect it, but I get raves everytime I make it!  Be patient and measure carefully when you bake.  YUMMY!!!!

Really good chocolate pie, but my Grandma always added 2 tbs of cornmeal to hers. Also this recipe didn't make enough for two pies I had to double the recipe. Other than that really good pie.

You can also take the unbaked pie crusts and place into a small casserole dish to be able to cut the pie into easy-to-serve squares! Great recipe!!

My 14 year old daughter made this for her end of the school year party. Everyone loved it & it was very easy for her to make all by herself!! Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was as easy to prepare as promised, but the texture after baking was disappointing.  Luckily, my husband is a huge fan of chocolate pie in general, so it wasn't a total bust!

made this pie recently and was very disappointed. it did not bake up like a chess pie. personally i feel that there is too much butter in this pie.  also if using deep dish pie shells you have to double the recipe and cook for 45-50 minutes. it was ok as far as taste goes but not a pie i will make again.

Just got through eating this pie. I think I should have used a mixer instead of a whisk like I do with chess pie. Since I did add pecans hoping they would rise to the top like they do with a pecan pie. Nope, I had 3 layers to my pie 1. More like a pecan pie filling 2. My layer of pecans and 3. A crunchy layer of chocolate. It was good, but nothing like the pictures.
