This did not turn out at all as I expected.  I've had store-bought bacon horseradish dip that I love, and this dip did not taste like that.  I did find another recipe online that turned out much better, which was: one small (8 oz?) container sour cream, 1/2 cup real mayo, 2 TBS prepared horseradish, 8 slices bacon, crisped and crumbled, dash garlic salt, dash onion powder, dash pepper.  Also good with Oscar Mayer real bacon bits.

This was delicious, however, I had to more than double the amount of horseradish.

This is a good basic recipe but to suit my personal taste I had to cut the amount of sour cream in half and add extra horseradish.  I also added some garlic, onion, salt, and pepper and used a whole pouch of Oscar Mayer Real Bacon Bits.

Absoutely the hit of the party every time. I like to totally overload it with bacon. It is always the first thing to go.

You'll never buy that store-bought stuff again once you learn to tweak this recipe!  I pulverized the bacon in my mini-chopper (used 8 slices, not 6) and added a healthy dose of Penzey's Bavarian seasoning. Delicious!

This lacked 'zest'.  I will try again add Worcestershire instead of lemon, garlic salt, and chives instead of parsley.

Made this without the bacon (did not have any). My husband loved the dill flavor. Can't wait to try with the bacon!! Delicious!!

It's okay, but nothing to write home about. It needs more complexity in the flavors - it is too one-dimensional.

This dip was a big hit with all family members during holiday get-togethers!  Fairly simple & easy to make and tastes GREAT with veggies, potato chips & crackers.  A simpler technique was to cook the bacon in the microwave instead.

I made this because I couldn't find it at the store without ingredients I'm allergic to.  This recipe is every bit as good, if not better than store bought.  I will definitely be making this again.

Way to much sour cream for the amount of horseradish.  I wound up putting more than twice the amount of horseradish in and it still wasn't enough.  I will not be making this recipe again. :(

This dip was excellent with grilled Tri-Tip.  I agree with previous reviews that the recipe is improved with TWICE the amount of prepared horseradish (1/2 cup).

Very yummy and easy to make. I did need to add some salt to it, I felt it was a little bland without it.

I added lots more bacon to this recipe as I made it for a serious bacon lover. Had requests for this recipe so it must have been good to others as well.

This did need a little help in the flavor department so per the suggestion of other reviewers, I added 1 tsp of granulated garlic and 1 tsp of granulated onion.  It didn't need additional salt.  I also had some smoked black pepper on hand and tossed a bit of that in too.  Its probably not necessary, but I did add a bit more bacon as well - everything is better with bacon!  This would make a good dip for chips or a great topper for a baked potato.

Probably will never make this again. Made the dip according to the recipe. Tasted like sour cream & lemon. Added more horseradish & garlic powder. Not much improvement. Added the bacon (2x what the recipe called for) & refrigerated (hoping the flavors would blend).  Not much improvement...and couldn't taste the bacon at all.  Very disappointed.
