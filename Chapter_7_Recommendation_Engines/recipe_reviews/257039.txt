So easy & delicious!  I had 6oz jars so each ingredient was 1/4 cup.  I also used vanilla yogurt & flaxseed.

Very easy and delicious!  I didn’t have vanilla yogurt so I used strawberry instead - yum! Also, I didn’t have jars to use so my plastic container did the trick.  I will definitely be doing this again.

I still like the idea of hot oatmeal so I often will microwave the oatmeal for 2 minutes after it sat in the fridge overnight. I put the oats in one of my soup cups with a handle and eat on my 45 minute commute to work. 
If you're going to microwave it, add a splash (maybe 2 tbsp worth) of milk after refrigerating overnight and before putting it in the microwave or else you will dry out the oats.
I also add 1 Tbsp of the powder PB fit for flavor.

Only thing I added was a teaspoon of honey to give it a little sweetness.

I added 1 teaspoon of honey and a dash of cinnamon and added finely chopped strawberries and used almond milk instead of regular milk.

I had made Signature Sweet 'N Low Pink Lemonade from this site and had 1 cup of thawed strawberries left over, so I decided to make this recipe. I used almond milk and added some stevia for sweetness. Great morning oatmeal with very little effort.

This was my first time making overnight oats.  I used frozen blueberries for the fruit, coconut milk instead of regular milk, and coconut yogurt.  They turned out great and most importantly, the kids loved it!!

This is so easy and tasted fantastic! When I bring it to work and put it in the fridge, my co workers are always admiring how pretty and delicious it it looks and a few have jumped on the band wagon. I substituted frozen organic berries for the fresh fruit and just 1/4 cup coconut milk instead of the 1/2 milk it calls for in the recipe.

love it!!! So filling and tasty! I also add 1/2 tsp of chia seeds for a protein boost and 1/2 tsp agave nectar for sweetness!
