I made this recipe for a large dinner party.  At first I was nervous about the amount of salt this recipe called for.  The primerib roast I purchased was well over $160 since it was 16 pounds. I did however, follow the SCALED recipe exactly. (I had the butcher cut away the bones but still kept them in place when he tied it up for me)  I can't say enough how wonderful it was.  I used every bit of the required salt (8 cups).  Through the cooking process it formed a very nice shell.  When it was time to remove the salt it was very easy.  The roast was not salty at all but it was super tender and juicy.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!  Every single guest asked me for the recipe.  I will never use any other recipe for primerib again.

I am an avid researcher before I even start a recipe.  I check the ingredients, steps, and of course, previous ratings.  This met all the criteria and figured I'd give it a go, since it was relatively simple.  The Prime came out AMAZING.  Top quality stuff.  You will be paying Big Bucks in a restaurant for this type of quality taste.  I do have to recommend that you get really good quality meat, or if the meat is of poor quality, the whole taste is a waste.  I would also highly recommend a meat thermometer.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  The salt doesn't stick on evenly on the sides as much as the top, but it did not seem to matter.  The salt scraped off nicely after cooking the meat and setting it aside for 30 minutes..  If you are a meat fan, THIS IS A MUST.  Do not skimp on the choice of meat, go for top quality.  It will cost a little more, but it is still hundreds of dollars cheaper with the amount of meals/servings you can have with a multi-pound meat, which would cost a fortune in a restaurant.  The meat was juicy and succulent and came out perfect thanks to the meat thermometer test at 4 hours, which registered about 145 degrees inside.  Thanks HOLLY!!!

My roast required a lot more salt (nearly a whole box of kosher salt) and I did spray the salt with water to help it stick to the meat.  I have not made a roast this size encrusted in salt so I was a little nervous about trying this.  I have to admit, it was a very good, very tender, roast!  Mine was a 5 pound roast and took less time to reach temperature than I expected.  USE A MEAT THERMOMETER!  That is the only way to make sure your roast is not well done.  The leftovers (I had to hide half the roast before serving dinner!) were so good in French Dip sandwiches, I am not sure I will ever get away with buying Deli roast beef again.  The salt tends to crack while baking, but don't worry it will still cook just fine.  Make sure you get ALL the salt crust off the roast before serving and it won't be too salty.  Great recipe!

Wow, who knew cooking prime rib could be so easy??  I took others suggestions (also glanced at the Rock Salt Prime Rib recipe on this site) and did mine this way:  I put down a layer of foil in the roasting pan, and also covered the bottom where the roast would be with the kosher salt.  Then I placed the roast (bone side down) on top of the salt (note here:  if you are using a bone in roast, you do not need to place the roast on an rack.  Just place right in pan - the bones act as the rack itself).  Then I slathered the meat with dijon mustard and poured the kosher salt on top of that - and yes, you must use kosher salt, table salt will not work with this!  Slow roasted at 250 (convection) and took exactly 4 hours to hit 143 for a 4 lb. roast.  Allowed it to rest for an hour, which was longer than I intended, temp. rose to 150 and then began to drop b/c the roast was cooling off! And the coolest part - the salt crust does crack right off, so don't be scared by the amount of salt - its needed to form the crust! The roast was medium rare in the very center branching off closer to medium at the ends, just the way we like it.  My husband was very impressed with our first homemade prime rib.  I can't wait to do it again, perhaps for Christmas dinner!

I don't know how anyone could give this less than 5 stars... it is unbelievably good!  I used a 12 pound boneless ribeye roast.  I rubbed it with olive oil, garlic, and thyme before applying the salt crust.  Mine too looked like a snowball!  I cooked at 425 for 15 minutes, then took it down to 215 for about 4 1/2 hours, thermometer read right between 145 and 150.  Perfection! Will definitely make again, great holiday meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have used a variation of this recipe for years. You can tell from the other reviews how good it really is. You must however use COARSE Kosher salt. I allow the meat to dry in the refrigerator uncovered (yes remove the paper/plastic wrapping) for two or three days (you must have a clean, odor free refrigerator). It will start to turn dark but should not appear greasy or slimy. Rub the outside of the roast with crushed garlic, pepper and rosemary before coating with a WET mixture of salt and water. It takes a little work to get the whole thing coated. When done properly the you will have to break the salt coating after cooking with a hammer and it will lift off in a couple of large pieces. Those who didn't like the recipe didn't use WET COARSE Kosher salt or they had a poor quality roast to begin with.

This roast turned out superb! to say the least, I have cooked several ribs and this recipe is the best. I did crush 4 cloves of garlic ,mixed that with the pepper and spread on top before salting. Also I used a 8 1/2 lb roast, which I believe the recipe should call for. Put it in at 11:30am done at 5:00pm perfectly medium. My kids could not get enough, This will be our Christmas tradition dinner.

Absolutely fantastic. The only change I made was that I thought the internal temperature at 145 degrees was too high and meat would be too well done for our taste. I took it out at 120 and it came up almost to 130 during resting and was perfect. Nice medium rare in the center and and medium with with just a little pink towards the ends of the roast. I carved the whole roast perpendicular to the ribs, then sliced that into 1 1/2 inch filets then seperated the ribs and served them along with the filet. I filet and 1 rib per plate. There was not a scrap left and everybody raved. Thank you Holly.

A simple, yet satisfying experience...definitely hands-off and yields exceptional results.  I did as follows for a 3.5lb Prime Rib with the bone(s) in:

Warmed roast to approx room temp.
Pre-heated oven to 500F.
Rubbed with season salt and pepper per recipe.
Rubbed in approx 3/4C Kosher salt.
Wetted with water and pressed on another 1/2C sea salt.

Cooked at 500F uncovered for 15 min.
Reduced heat to 350F for 70 min. (or until internal temp reaches 135F for med-rare).
Removed from oven and let sit for approx 20 min.

Very good, worth the wait.  I added a small amount of water to the salt so that it could be "pressed" to the roast.

We bought a 17 lb prime rib roast (7 ribs) for Christmas dinner and were very anxious as it was an expensive ($157) and large piece of meat and we wanted to have a great dinner.  I've never been happier or more pleased with a meal!  Here's what we did:  To start, we left the meat on the counter for two hours to bring it to room temperature before cooking.  When it was ready to go in the oven, I rubbed the meat with olive oil and then generously applied about a cup of minced garlic.  I then mixed a whole bottle of powdered steak seasoning with the kosher salt and added water to form a moist (not soaking wet) paste.  I molded the salt mixture on top of the meat (about 1/2 inch thick) and then put it in a 225* oven with a meat thermometer inserted in the middle.  I started the prime rib at 8 a.m. and by 1:00 p.m. the meat thermometer read 120* - it was ready!  I removed the salt in two large, hard pieces and then let it rest for an hour on the counter (covered with foil).  The meat was amazing - it was as good as the best restaurant we've eaten at.  BEST TIP:  USE A MEAT THERMOMETER AND DO NOT COOK BEYOND 120* for rare/medium rare.  BON APPETIT!

This recipe made our Christmas dinner so amazing! Like everyone else, I was afraid of covering $150 of prime rib with salt and ruining our Christmas dinner. Thanks to the other reviewers I proceeded with the recipe. I had a 14 lb boneless prime rib. I used 6 lbs (2 boxes) of Morton's Coarse Kosher Salt, mixed with 2 cups of water to make the salt stick. I made a "bed" of the salt mixture in the bottom of the roasting pan and placed the p.rib on it. I brought the meat to room temp. (about 2 hrs.), then coated it with olive oil, chopped fresh rosemary, chopped garlic, seasoning salt and pepper; inserted a digital meat thermometer, and packed it with the rest of the salt. Put p.rib in a hot 450 degree oven for 15 min. then turned the oven down to 225. It took 4 1/2 hours (approx) for the meat to reach 130 degrees. Let it rest 30 min. Perfection! Rare-Med Rare in the center. You have to trust the recipe and the digital thermometer (won't use reg. thermometer again)! Several guests planned to make their own prime rib this way for New Year's Eve dinner.

This recipe makes a perfect prime rib!  We always make our prime rib roast exactly like this at Christmas.  One important note is to ensure that the roast is at room temperature before you start roasting - believe it or not, it makes it even better.

I followed the recipe right down to the letter, but was left with a really really salty slab of expensive meat.  It didn't create a salt crust like I thought that it would, and scraping the kosher salt off of the meat was tedious.  After removing the salt, it was still really salty.

I read most of the 9 pages of reviews before I made this.  A few things to remember, 1.) take your rib roast out an hour or so before cooking and leave it unwrapped on your counter to come to room temperature, 2.) do not be afraid to season your meat before putting the salt crust on, 3.) use a salt paste to get it to stick to the meat (use course kosher salt, I used an entire 3 lb box), 4.)  use a meat thermometer and 5.) do not open your oven.  This was a wonderful recipe and everyone loved it!  Even my 22 month old daughter ate a ton of it.  I will definitely make this again.  I had read a review to use olive oil on the roast but I didn't care for the taste.  I did not season enough before hand because I was too scared but I will definitely use plenty of seasoning and garlic next time.  I had a 7.11 lb roast, put it in at 500 degrees for 15 minutes and then lowered to the 210 for 4.5 hours.  Very good.

Add me to the list of happy prime ribbers! This was one of the best I have ever cooked. I did add water to the salt and for fear of it being to salty(yeh i know I read ALL the reviews and yes it is not salty!) I took cheese cloth and wrapped it twice around the middle, this protected the end pieces, to get the salt to stick on the cheesecloth i put olive oil on it and the salt stuck perfectly! The top and the bottom did not have any cheesecloth and the salt made a perfect crust. When I removed it 125 let it sit 20 minutes, removed the salt crust and popped back in the oven at 350 for 10- 15 minutes, I prefer my prime rib warmer, It was cooked perfectly, everyone RAVED! took it out at 135 degrees medium rare perfection. When cooking prime rib YOU MUST USE A THERMOMETER!! period! it was tender juicy and had a wonderful flavor. I sprinkled garlic powder all over it before I put on the crust, for those disappointed on no ajus, just buy "Johnny's Au Jus" located somewhere around the BBQ sauces and ketchup in your local store, it is concentrated and is way better than Au Jus I can make and is 100 times better than the pkg mix!! Problem solved! Enjoy and try this don't be scared it is wonderful!!!

We made this for Thanksgiving and it was soooooo good. I will never cook prime rib any other way. I followed the recipe to the letter. It was so easy. I had a 10 lb. roast that I cooked for 7 hours at 220 degrees. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe turned out great.  I used considerable more salt.  For a 6lb roast I used a whole 3lb box of kosher salt.  
A Prime Rib trick is the unwrap the meat about 4 days before cooking.  Put the meat on a platter on top of paper towels and store in the refrigerator.  Every day flip the meat and replace the paper towels.  This will draw out extra moisture which intensifies the flavor of the meat.

This came out perfect. There were two pieces of advice that I believe helped this be the best prime rib ever. 1) make a paste out of the salt. This created a nice crust that just broke away from the beef so easily. 2) watch the internal temp. Ignore the time and just watch the temp. This beef came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

I had a 10 lb roast with the bone in. I used a 3 Lb box of salt mixed with 1 cup of water, and piled it on. I used the whole box and could have used more salt I think. This cooked almost 4 hours at 300. I took it from the oven at 130 on the meat thermometer, and it rose to 140 while standing which was a moist tender medium to medium well.
This was the most delicious thing I have ever cooked for a large group. (12 people). So easy to do. The end pieces of meat were a little salty, but other than that it was a huge hit and I will do it again. The salt turns brown and cracks but that is ok, don't worry. Almost foolproof. If you like more rare pull from oven at 120.

This is the best recipe for prime rib that I have ever found. We were extremely nervous about using it but after reading several pages of reviews we decided to risk it. If they publish the picture I submitted you will see why we were nervous; those two prime ribs looked like giant coconut-covered Twinkies with all the salt.

As others have said, the salt comes off in crusts and the meat is absolutely fabulous. Thank you Holly for a truly wonderful recipe!!

I have never cooked a rib this way but have always wanted to try. I was a little worried about the rib being too salty or that it would not cook in time for my event but all went well using a meat thermometer. A 10.02 lb. rib started cooking at noon and was out of the oven by 6-6:15 and was done to a very nice Medium rare on the thicker end and a nice Med on the smaller end.
 This was a flavorful, juicy and tender meal and I knew all was well when a room full of women bacame quiet....REALLY quiet! 
 My Ladies Night out dinner was a success and we all reccomend this method of cooking a prime rib!

When I bought my first prime rib ever, the butcher told me to slather it in mustard and coat it with Kosher salt. This is so easy and delicous, and the way we always cook it! Serve with creamed horseradish on the side.

I love this recipe in that it gives me the basic time and how much I need of what. I'm a cook that almost always adds stuff to a recipe.
1; use yellow mustard to "glue" on the salt. Truly, you will not taste it. I've always made it this way. I found this tip on another recipe, but their cooking time wasn't very good.
I slice up fresh garlic and then cut slits into the fat of the steaks and slide them in there.  Rub with montreal steak seasoning and let stand at room temp. till it's no longer as cold.  Rub with mustard and then the salt. Truly, promise, you won't taste any mustard!!!  I do let it set for 20-30 mins, but it's important that it's covered with foil and in a warm place or it will grow cold and that makes me sad.  The size roast you want is typically 1 bone per 2 adults.

I have been cooking this roast since the late 1960's with the following differences. Wrap the roast in cheesecloth at least two thicknesses, then place the roast on the layer of salt, completely cover the roast with salt top and sides with at least one inch or more of salt, I use a stainless steel turkey roasting pan. Place in a preheated 400 degree oven and roast for 1 hour, lower the temperature to 300 degrees and cook to desired temp using a meat thermometer (this roast is best served rare to medium rare),  When desired temperatureis reached, roast will be evenly cooked from outer to inner cut. Remember this roast continues to cook as it is setting. After taking in roast out of the oven, remove the roast from the salt, using two large kitchen forks, and remove the cheesecloth. There will not be any heavy salt that needs to be scraped from the roast. The roast is now ready to carve and serve.

I have purchased a 15 pound Prime Rib for Christmas dinner, I was a bit leary in spite of all the great reviews, so found a tiny 2 pounder and decided to give it a try. I followed the directions to the tee, and put it in the oven at 12:00, figuring, it would be ready in about 4 hours, WRONG, we went to town, and got back around 2:00 and I checked the temperature of the meat, it was right at 140, the temp for the meat to be rare as we like it, so, I took it out of the oven and let it rest while I prepared the baked potatoe and the salad, and then, I too, the crust of salt off and finished getting the reast off with a little pastry brush, it worked great, I then, sliced into the luscious piece of meat, and Yep, it was rare, probably too rare for some people, but, just right for us. My husband, who does not like much salt on his food, was very happy with it.I definately will go ahead and cook the Christmas roast with this recipe, but, will plan on a longer cooking time. I  increased the number of servings to accomadate a 15 pound roast, and the cooking time still showed 4 1/2 hours, I am sure, it will take longer, so I plan to put it into the oven around 6 AM and see how it goes! We may have to adjust our dinner time to go with the roast!

I followed recommendations from other members by moistening the salt in order to aid the crust formation. I also kept salt off the ends to eliminate oversalting those pieces. Furthermore I started with an oven preheated to 500 degrees, cooking the roast for 5 minutes before lowering the temp to 210 for 4.5 hours. 

The roast came out wonderful.

The next time I'll have it sit on the sideboard for a while at room temp. That seems to also help. 

All in all, a very good recipe and worth the effort.

I looked all over the internet for a good prime rib recipe - I chose this one.

The time seemed incorrect and other reviewers mentioned this (cooked in about half the time). So I figured from looking at other recipes that my 16 pound roast should take about 10 hours at 210 degrees - and it did.

I did add to the recipe 4 cloves of garlic that I crushed and spread with the pepper on top under the salt.

I was very pleased with the outcome and will reuse this recipe next time.

Although the prime rib roasted beautifully, my family really thought the flavor of salt on the outter edges of the roast was TOO strong.  NOTE: With all the salt in the juices, you could not even make au-Jus sauce from the drippings.  (Yes, you could remove big chunks of salt from the roast but NOT the juice!)

Mine didn't work.  Couldn't get it to stick properly (very hard to do) so the juices ran out and the salt ran in! lol.  But I can imagine it must be just wonderful if you get it right.  Won't be trying again without help though, thats for sure. $Cha-Ching!$

I read many reviews thoroughly before choosing this recipe. I rubbed the meat with a paste of fresh garlic before applying the salt as another member suggested. After researching on this site and a few others I started with a temperature of 425 and then lowered the oven to 250 for about 4 hours. I cooked it until the thermometer read 135 degrees and let it rest for 30 minutes. It was perfectly medium rare. I served this with au jus and horseradish. This was excellent, as good as any restaurant. I will definitely make this again.Update: I used the leftovers to make prime rib soup,a copycat of the one served at Harrigan's restaurant.My family loved it as well. I got two great meals out of this recipe. This will be a new holiday tradition.

We served this for Thanksgiving.  I took the suggestions from another person and had the butcher remove the ribbs but tie them on.  I special ordered an 11 lb roast and was VERY nervous about all of the salt and never having cooked a prime rib roast.  This recipe was EVERYTHING and more that everyone said about it.  I can't wait to have it again.

This is just like my mother made before she went to Heaven.  I was reading the reviews and the remarks about the cracking of the salt crust... when my mother mixed the salt and seasonings, it was ready when you could put some of the salt in your palm, make a fist and it retained the pattern of your grip.  Her crust always came out intact.

This may be the best prime rib roast I have ever made.  I was very nervous about making it for Christmas day, but I needn't have worried.  It was perfect! One thing, it is very important to make a paste of the salt with a small amount of water.  Otherwise, I don't think the salt would have stuck so well and formed such a nice crust that was easy to remove.  By the way, for an 8 pound roast roasted to medium (145), it was almost 6 hours at the 210 temperature...but certainly worth the wait. Thanks for a superb dish!

Oh my GOD if I could give this a 10 I would have - Slow cook this puppy and take it out with a meat thermometer reading of 130 degrees for rare, by the time you get the crust off it will be PERFECT, just like in a  five star restaurant.  It was the best rib roast I've ever made.

For the minority of people who didn't like the recipe I can only guess that the salt wasn't applied correctly, a meat thermometer wasn't used or possibly just a bad piece of meat to start with.  

For the meat thermometer, invest in one that I digital with a probe the inserts into the meat and a small heat-proof cable that goes to the digital part and allows you to monitor the thermometer without opening the oven door during the roasting process. Mine was around $25 and is well worth it.  Ignore the clock an pay attention to temperature.  

Second, there seems to be such an issue and debate with the salt and maybe this will help. Just remember back to when you were a kid and you would go to the beach.  Remember how the soft, wet sand felt?  Remember the consistency that made the best sand castles?  That's what you're aiming for here - get the consistency of your salt to the consistency of wet sand and then 'entomb' your meat in the wet salt.  I can hear it in the reviews - people are trying to rub it in or sprinkle it on and it's not working, the roast is coming out salty and that is why.  Hope that helps! :-)

For Thanksgiving we wanted to do something different...this recipe turned out spectacular.  I used a 4 lb. prime rib, coated in kosher salt (with a little water sprinkled on it so the salt would stick, cooked at 210 degrees (it took almost 6 hours) but was WELL worth the extra time, it was juicy, medium rare, and better than ANY restaurant prime rib we have ever had...served with au jus and horseradish mmmmmmm!!  Thank you Holly for sharing this recipe.

If you mix in a bowl kosher salt and a small amount of water, to make a paste to put on the meat your kosher salt will go much further.George

Temp is weird, my oven doesn't have a 210 degree setting, so I used 225 deg.  I didn't time it, I used a meat therm.  It had a good flavor, but I like to be able to use the au jus and you couldn't...too salty.

I was so intimidated at the idea of cooking prime rib -- who knew it could be so simple?  We have used this recipe for holidays & special occasions many times, and it ALWAYS comes out perfect.  For those reviewers who thought the results were too salty, might I suggest just using the salt on the base of the pan and not crusting the meat with it.  Instead use a good steak rub, and lots of fresh garlic cloves inserted into little slits in the roast.  I've made it as-written, and also with these variations, and the results are always fab!

I made this for our Seder meal at church and everyone just raved about it.  I was pretty shocked myself on how well it turned out!  I used a 15 pound roast and it was boneless and still only used about 2 cups of salt.  I also cut slivers of garlic and stuffed down inside the roast. It was amazing!!

Another great recipe MARBALET, thank you. I was worried a little about the salt method, but it looked interesting so I decided to try it. I did only about 1/8 tsp. of black pepper, but did everything else exactly. It was so easy to make, it cut nicely when done, and was so tender! I do like steak including primed rib at a medium well stage, so I baked the meat for exactly 6 hours. It was fine, because the temperature was so low. The only thing was I wished it would have had its own au jus sauce, but with this recipe it obviously couldn't work. For those who had to have it, I made the packet type. I thought it was too salty as is, so I added a tablespoon of flour to it. The prime rib was so good, I didn't want to ruin it with the packet au jus, so we used it for the potatoes. I plan to make again next Christmas as of now.

I also added a about 1 Tbsp. dried basil, garlic  and 1/2 tsp. each marjoram, onion powder
and thyme to the Rib Roast before coating with the salt. You do need to combine the Kosher salt with a cup of water to form a thick paste. Pat it on as thickly as possible, and the best tool to use is your hands!I put mine on a rack with a little water at the bottom of the pan.The steam causes the salt crust
to crack slightly, and makes it easier to remove (it really just peels away.) 
We have no leftovers!

Absolutely delicious!  Impress your guests with this restaurant quality meal.  Make sure you do not leave slices in the drippings, otherwise they soak up the salty juice.

Excellent! Number one, buy an instant read thermometer, then try this flavorful recipe. Do not be afraid of the salt; it keeps moisture in the roast while giving wonderful flavor.  I laid fresh thyme sprigs on top of the salt on the cooking pan, as well as on top of the roast before adding the salt.  I cooked a 5.5 pound prime rib roast, and it took nearly two hours to reach 135, resting until it reached 140, a lovely medium rare.  This is when the instant read can save your investment, don't cook prime rib without one!  I started the roast at 450 for 30 minutes, then lowered to 350 until it reached temp.

Oh My 10 Stars!!!!! This is wonderful! I used this recipe on a rump roast and it was out of this world! I had planned on making the roast for sandwiches; it was so good that we ate and ate and ended up not even making dinner. I used sea salt instead of kosher and sprinkled a little garlic powder on top. I used a crock pot, placing salt all over the bottom and placing roast in dry. It turned out beautifully. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Yes, even though I scraped the salt off it was still a tad bit salty, which we expected and enjoyed. The simplest recipes so many times turn out to be the best. Thanks for posting Holly :-)

All I can say is AWESOME.  I made this for Father's Day this year.  It was the first time that I had made a Prime Rib at home.  Juicy, tender and incredible flavor!!!  The only thing that was not accurate, was the cooking time.  We like our Prime rib medium rare, so it only took about 4 hours to cook to our liking.  But, It was EXCELLENT! Thank You,  Lili Osborne

I have been making this recipe for Christmas for the past four years...everyone raves about the meat. The salt layer under slow heat does form a crust that is easy to remove. One thing I have noted is that small end of standing rib roasts (while oh so great quality beef!) lack fat at the top of the roast or some butchers cut it down. I get a quality large end roast with a SMALL TO MODERATE (can't see the pink of beef shining through) amount of fat layer on the top and find it helps to keep the meat from becoming salty. The fat heats to form the crust layer with the salt. It and the fat peel back to reveal the most juiciest rib roast ever. Hope this helps. Making it again tomorrow....enjoy!

are you afraid? why are you reading the reviews then? do it correct and you will not taste the salt. i am really bad about following recipes, i cant even follow my own, but i do use them for a guide and this is an awesome guide. i peal and slice about 1-2 heads (yes heads, not cloves) of garlic and insert into meat (avg of 8-10lbs roast). generously coat with approx 1-tsp each dried basil, oregano, thyme, sage and chicken bouillon. leave uncovered in frig over night. set on counter early am and rest at room temp for at least 5 hours. lightly coat in olive oil (lightly!). mix +/- one cup water per 3 lb box of "kosher" salt, to make thick paste. cover all sides, including bottom and sides. quick roast at 500 deg for about 10-15min, turn down to 210 and cook till thermometer reads 10 degrees below desired doneness, will cook while resting. IT MUST REST REST!!!! the salt will lift off like a helmet and you will not taste it. if you want gravy, make with bouillon, the drippings are not good for gravy. i have made this recipe several times, it is by far the best.

FABULOUS, I'll never make prime rib another way again!  My roast was 5.08 lbs and took approx. 5 hours at 210F.  Like others had suggested, I made a paste with some water to make my salt crust.  The salt just breaks off in chunks after resting.  I allowed my roast to rest sitting in my microwave.

Amazingly perfect and delicious -- next time I will not put the salt on each end -- those pieces remained very salty tasting.  I cooked it to 135, and it was perfection.  Can't wait to do it again.

Wow, was this delicious!  This was my first time cooking prime rib, and I have to admit that I was a little scared cooking it with all that salt.  It came out perfect!  I can honestly say it was the best prime rib I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little water to the kosher salt to help it adhere better to the roast.  The salt formed a shell and popped right off when I went to take it off.  It did not leave a salty taste at all.  It was extremely juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender.  My roast was a little over 6# and I cooked it for about 5 hours.  It's imperative to use a meat thermometer because oven times can vary greatly.  I served it with a horseradish sauce that I found on this site and it complimented it perfectly.  Thank you for such a great recipe that I'm sure I'll use again and again!

I think this could have been great, but when I moved my roast half way through cooking, a lot of the crust cracked and fell off.  I made the mistake of adding more salt, which was a huge error.  It just melted right into the meat and made it so salty.  I almost ruined the roast and as it was I had to chuck a bunch of the one side.  The roast was still juicy and I really think it would have been great if not for my mistake.  I also did not like that I could not use the juices to make gravy because it was just too salty.  I will try something different next time, thanks.

This recipe is every bit as good (and shocking) as everyone else has said.  I cooked a 14 pound roast and used about 1 1/2 pounds of the koser course salt. I used the salt dry on top of the roast and wetted it for the sides which was a great move.  It stuck to the sides well and the water/salt combo made a better crust than the dry salt alone.  The meat was absolutely fabulous and everybody raved, even my critical sister said it was better than any restaurant.  As far as the quality, I found the least exensive place to buy at $2.98 per pound and it really didn't matter, it was superb!

YUM! I served this for a non-traditional Thanksgiving meal. This was my first time to cook prime rib so I was a bit nervous about the possibility of messing up an expensive cut of meat.  I did a 5 lb roast and followed the instructions pretty closely.  It turned out perfect! Better than any I've ever had in a restaurant.  My family loved it.  I can't wait to serve my friends this meal in the near future.

What a pleasure making this - picked up this recipe, so easy in preparation, and ever since have been making it at least once a month. Just keep watch of the meat temperature as it will easily overcook if left in the oven too long. My family love medium rare so between 135-140 degrees is the point to stop. Would recommend this to anyone.

The only way I cook a rib roast!!!
Tried this on my very first roast, (for xmas 2004) came out PERFECT. Very tender, flavorful, not salty at all (salt just brushes off) Perfect with horseradish sauce! 
Hubby's cooking it for me today!

Excellent! We used a 6lb roast and baked for the full 5 hours. It came out perfect. We also moistened the salt to a moist sand consistency so it would encase the meat better.

Awesome! Very easy. Wet the Kosher salt down a little to make it pack better. My cut was a little under 5lb and time was still spot on as we like a little more on the rare side of medium. Let sit covered with a towel loosely in the microwave for about an hour and the temp when cut was perfect. My first attempt so will go with a larger cut with more people now I have the confidence! Used a dry mix Au Jus sauce because you cannot make one from the drippings. Get a good horse radish sauce as well.

Amazing! I made another prime rib recipe years ago from this site that got great reviews, however I wasn't that excited about the outcome. This recipe, however, is the winner. It was so easy to prepare and cook - no needing to baste or do much prep work other than light seasoning and covering in salt. It also doesn't heat up your kitchen! Always buy the top grade beef you can afford, and you can't go wrong.

I have made this recipe about a dozen times in the last 2 years and do have a couple of suggestions.  For a 5 lbs roast I typically use 1 1/2 or 2 boxes of kosher salt.  I pour it into a large mixing bowl and add a little water until it can be formed into walls on the outside of the bowl and hold its own weight.  I do this so that I can make a cocoon of salt around the entire roast with no exposed spots.  Also when you place the salt on the roast use a metal spoon or spatula because your hands will stick to the salt and it will collapse instead of forming around the roast.  I also take garlic cloves and cut them into fourths and insert them inside the roast between the fat layers.  Also if you have the butcher cut the ribs from the roast and tie them back together the garlic fits well between the two.  After it is coated I place in an oven that is 500 degrees.  As soon as I place the roast into the oven I decrease the temp to 210.  This hardens the salt quickly and seals the roast inside.  Monitor with a meat thermometer and take out several degrees shy of your desired temp and allow it to sit in the salt cocoon and it will cook for another 30 minutes before cutting.  

Over all this is a great recipe and I use it all the time.

This is a wonderful prime rib,  Very easy to make.  Because of the long cooking time your kitchen is clean before the company arrives.  My mom, who states she doesn't like meat, asked for seconds.

I have made this recipe quite a few times and it has never disappointed me.  My rule of thumb is to totally cover the roast with coarse salt and cook it at 170ºF for 1 hr per lb of roast.  I usually use between a 4-7 lb roast.  I sell natural-raised beef for a living and have given many people this formula, even for rolled rump roasts and gotten good reviews.  If you think it's too salty, you haven't gotten all of the salt off.  Better than any restaurant meal if you use good beef to start with, not the store bought wet-aged stuff.  Go to a butcher and get dry-aged beef.  It's worth the extra cost.

The first website I go to for recipes is allrecipes.com as I have not been let down yet..BUT..this was TERRIBLE.  What a waste of a great prime rib.  All we could taste is salt, entirely covering up the taste of the beef.  It did come out very tender, but that was overpowered by the salt.  I would not recommend this to anyone and would not try again.  VERY DISSAPOINTED

I made this last New Years and it was the best prime rib ever. I will be serving this for Christmas dinner this year. I cooked one boneless roast and a bone in roast. Both were cooked to med rare and were good, but the bone in comes out better for some reason. (longer cook time = more tender roast?)
Me and my guests thank you!

Woderful and flavorful. A must try. Just so you all don't make the same mistake my husband made. DO NOT make gravy from the drippings, It makes for a VERY SALTY gravy.

Very, very yummy!  It was my first time making a prime rib and it turned out GREAT!!!  I made it for my daughters family birthday party.  Everyone LOVED it!  I think if I had turned my back for one second my nephew would have chewed the bone.
I followed the recipe to a T, and it was wonderful.  Wouldn’t change a thing.  I will defiantly make this again.  I think if I didn’t my family would disown me.

I tried this recipe for Xmas dinner and it came out to be the best prime rib I have ever made.  I made a few changes in that I rubbed the meat with seasoning salt and Lawrys Beef & Pork Rub first and then coated it with a salt paste (kosher salt mixed with water).  Also, after it reached rare, I turned up the oven temp to 375 and browned the salt for about 15 min.  My husband said that he had never had a prime rib as good but admitted he was nervous when he saw me lathering salt all over the meat!  This will become our only way of cooking prime rib in the future.

Fantastic taste - easy to do!  Did a 5.5 lb oven-prepared prime rib roast for Oscar night, seasoned the roast all over with pepper and a package of Lipton onion soup mix,then pasted on a mixture of coarse kosher salt, Montreal steak seasoning and water.  I roasted at 425 for 20 minutes, and then at 215 until the temperature reached 140.  I let it sit for 15 minutes, cracked/scraped off the crust, and it was perfectly medium, tasty and juicy!

Unbelievably juicy!! I'll never cook a prime rib roast any other way than this. I like it rare/medium rare, so I took it out at about 130F and let it sit for a half-hour. Was perfectly pink throughout.

The roast turned out great, but I made a couple of improvements.

I marinated the prime rib with olive oil and rosemary for two days prior to cooking.

Instead of black pepper, I used a dry rub of ground green and pink peppercorns and ground coriander seed. Just put all the dry ingredients into a coffee grinder. I also coated with a little bit of a vegetable-based garlic spread. That's easier than trying to make garlic cloves stick to the meat.

When done, I served with a basic gravy made from a dark roux (margarine & flour fried at high heat), beef broth, au jus concentrate, red wine, and juices from the roast. Everybody commented on how well the gravy turned out, despite the fact that I didn't have any beef drippings.

Best prime rib I've made.  Kept two digital thermometers in the meat while baking and pulled it out around 125-130 (thick-thin side).  Flavor was awesome, even better with custom horseradish cream and fresh grated horseradish on the side).  It was excellent and even the foodies at our dinner for 12 were pleased.

Turned out beautifully!  The salt crusted well and came off in great chunks.  Roast was done sooner than I thought it would be, but could be my oven.  I added garlic to the rub before salting and it was a good addition.  Juicy, tender enough to cut with a fork and full of flavor.  Will make this again.

Excellent!  Best prime rib I have ever made at home.  Got approval from everyone who tried it.  I highly reccomend this to anyone wanting to cook a prime rib.  Make sure you scrape off the salt layer.

This was super easy and the cooking temp/time was perfect, so tender.  I used a small roast (about 2.5 pounds) and think that using a larger roast might have been better as it was a little salty.  If I do this again, I will not cover the sides in the salt, just the top.  Most of the salt formed a crust, but in the area's where the salt was not thick enough (sides, due to falling off) the crust didn't form as well so the salt was more difficult to remove.  These area's were too salty.  Where the crust came off the meat was perfect and not too salty.  I do not want to give a bad review as the majority of the meat was absolutely delicious.  The recipe does say to be sure to remove ALL the salt before serving, and if this would have been as easy to do as stated this would be perfect, but the area's where the salt didn't crust (the sides, due to being thin from salt falling off) it was difficult to do.  I also took the suggestion of adding some water to the salt as I coated the meat to try and make the salt stick, this was very helpful.  I do plan on making this again, using a larger roast and leaving salt off of the sides.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic recipe. I altered it slightly to accomodate tighter time frame as follows - rubbed 4lb roast with some minced garlic first, then pepper and piled on the kosher salt (to anyone who found their recipe tasted salty - did you use regular salt or kosher? There's a BIG difference!!) Warmed oven up to 425 degrees, then put roast in and turned down to 250. Roast reached medium in just under 4 hrs. For reference - 140 degrees = rare, 155 = medium, 165 = well done. Let rest for 10 min, cracked off salt crust and served - perfect!

After I read all the great reviews for this recipe I had to try it. I made this for my family's Christmas dinner today and it was delicious! Everyone was blown away by the flavor and at how juicy the meat was.  The kosher salt kept all the juices in while flavoring the meat.The seasoning salt and pepper made every bite good, not bland at all. It was salty without being overwhelming. I recommend this recipe to anyone that is making a rib roast for the first time because it is a really easy recipe.

I was afraid to try this recipe with all the salt it asks for. And I dont like salt that much. But wow! it was so good. I got rave reviews on it and the meat was tender and very flavorful. I will make this every year now for the holidays. Thanks!

Reading the other reviews, I lightly rubbed the roast with OLIVE OIL (and added a little garlic powder because we love the flavor) before adding the kosher salt. Excellent Recipe. I will most definitely keep this on file.

I actually used MORE salt than called for here - 3 cups!  I made a damp paste of kosher salt and water and created about a 1/3" crust around the roast.  I cooked a 4.5 lb roast until it was 130 inside, then let sit (in the crust) for a half hour before simply lifting away the salt and slicing.  It was perfect and not salty at all!

Slow cooking and packing the salt on to the roast made for one fantastic xmas meal. Make sure to put in a meat thermometer so you can serve the roast to your desired liking...ie rare, med, etc

Flavor was great, but be sure to go by your own taste for meat, as far as when it is done. 5 hours brought my rib to being well done.

Way too salty.  I ruined a great piece of meat and our special Valentine's Dinner.  Don't try this one unless you want to waste $40.00!

SO perfect!  This recipe yields a perfect prime rib from end to end, be sure your thermometer is in the center, not touching a bone.   Also instead of the seasoned salt we use montreal steak seasoning and some garlic powder with the pepper, then cover it with kosher salt.

I tried this with boneless ribeye roast instead of prime rib.  Amazing!  My husband can't quit talking about it... he even picked up another roast this week so I can make it again.  He loves making sandwiches with the leftovers :o)

I had never heard of this tactic and was very reluctant but based on the number of good reviews I went ahead and gave it a try.  Low and behold it turned out fabulous! I used some of the recommendations of others and wet the salt which made it stick to the meat a bit easier.  It came out so good I am making another one just 2 weeks later!

My brother in law prepared this for Christmas - it's our first home-cooked prime rib and it was SUPERB!!! 5-star restaurant taste and quality! By mixing salt with water makes it easier to coat and prevents the crust from falling apart during cooking. He took it out from the oven at 140F and rested the meat for 30min. The meat was tender and juicy. Simple ingredients and straight forward method. It's a must have recipe for all prime rib lovers!

EXCELLENT. BEST MEAT I HAVE EVER EATEN. WE WILL DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN. I took it out at 133 F internal temp. Meat had been cooking for about 4hrs, 210 F and then at the very end--- 15 min 350F (I was cooking other stuff) I had a 4.9 lb rib roast. It rested for 30 min, it was perfect. medium! THANK YOU.....

This came out perfect.  It tasted much better than I thought it would.  I ended up using a ton more salt since just kept adding to the outside. I used a little water to make the salt stick better and when I was done it looked like a Roman statue.

This was excellent!  I made a 2lb. roast and had it in the oven for 2 hours - until the thermometer read 138.  I let it rest for 1/2 hr. and it was perfectly pink.  The only problem I had was with the salt.  I think since the cooking time was considerably shorter than the recipe called for, the salt didn't have enough time to form a solid crust.  I scraped off as much as I could, but the edges were still pretty salty.  Will make again though... maybe with a bigger roast.  (I also used "wet" salt.)

Awesome!  I had to use the whole box of kosher salt and I used some water to meld it together.  Be sure to brush off the excess salt after you pull off the crust.

Fantastic!  So simply to prepare and elegant to serve!  It was expense - nearly 5 pounds of Choice Rib Roast at $10.99 per pound totaled $54 - but we had 5 adults at dinner, everyone had second helpings and 2 ate leftovers the next day.  I followed the directions exactly and used a meat thermometer.  I served horseradish and au jus on the side along with Green Bean Bundles and Rosemary Red Potatoes (both on this site).

I rubbed my 8.2lb roast with evoo then added season salt, fresh garlic, rosemary, peppercorn. Seared my meat @ 500 for 15 mins and brought the temp. down to 210. I did everything else the same way. It came out so juicy, it was amzing. I have made prime rib every year for 8 years now during Thanksgiving and this time it was the best.

I have been making this from a southern living cookbook. Rub the roast in worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and then rub rock salt all over. It helps it to stick I use a kitchen mallet to crack the rock salt off the roast. What a great recipe!

I made this for Christmas dinner with a 12 lb roast. It was absolutely amazing. I made a paste of garlic, fresh rosemary, sea salt and pepper and smeared it on the roast when I took it out of the fridge to warm up. This gave the salt something to stick to and it added the most wonderful flavor that permeated the entire roast while cooking. It was in the oven for a total of 5 hours and came out medium rare and melt in your mouth tender.

Holy  was that good!  I followed this recipe to the "T" and it turned out perfect.  I received no complaints, but was a little worried about the salt factor.  The only thing I did differently was after the Roast got to 140 degrees, I wrapped it up and let the juices "settle" for half an hour.  This made for a small mess in getting the salt off, so I simply rinsed it under hot water for just a moment.  Voila!  Absolutely perfect prime rib roast.  This is the only review I have ever written, but it was that good.

Great flavor, but mine turned out dry.  I did not cook as long as it called for and it still registered 170 on the meat thermometer-Well done (probably why it was dry).  I will try again, but not cook near as long.

Try this...moisten the salt ( I used rock salt ) with some Cabernet then "stick" it to the roast. Pile it on THICK!  Don't be afraid.  This recipe was 5 star restaurant quality.  Very simple and juicy.

This was the best prime rib I have ever tasted!!!  I was a little worried about all the salt, but the salt crust fell right off and the meat was perfect.  I roasted it (a 12 pounder) in a roaster oven in order to free my oven for baked potatoes.  I also rubbed it with McCormick's Grill Mates for steak seasoning and dusted it with garlic powder before adding the salt.  Pure perfection!!  I've never seen a Christmas dinner devoured so quickly. This is our new Christmas tradition.  Thank you!

Wow, this was fantastic!! I made a 14 pound roast!!Christmas dinner for 16 people. My first time ever cooking prime rib, I was a nervous wreck as it was over $100.00 slab of meat! It came out incredibly good, everyone raved over it. Do use a good meat thermometer and take it out at 145, it seems to keep cooking even after you take it out of the oven! I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks!

Absolutely WONDERFUL!! I like others was very nervous with all the salt and over $100 in meat for our holiday guests, but we only had rave reviews and many requests for this to be an annual favorite. We rubbed the meat with olive oil and very heavily seasoned it prior to the salt crust. THANKS!!

Had to make a few changes due to oven space (or lack thereof). Used Allrecipes prime rib tips to alter cooking time. I used an 8 lbs. roast and seared it at 450 for 30mins. then turned heat down to 350 and cooked for an additional 2hrs (15min. per pound).  It was a boneless roast so I think it took another 20-30 min. So total cooking time was close to 3 hours. I took it out when it reached 135 on meat thermometer- was a perfect medium rare roast - the fam. raved.

Expensive yes,  but worth it!!!!  We had an 8 pound rib roast which served 6.  We stuck garlic cloves in for a little extra flavoring.  This was not salty at all.  This smells so wonderful cooking.  The juice mixed with red wine makes a nice dipping sauce. We had homemade sourdough bread, baked potato, tomato/zuchini salad, and red wine.  I will have this again, as much as possible!

I found that adding water to the salt made it easier to coat the roast. Because it is not browned first, the roast will look funky, though after it is carved, this will cease to be an issue. The key thing here is cooking it slow and at a low temp to get the roast as you want it- use a themometer-I went for 135 degrees and that was almost too warm for the medium rare that I wanted. I really feel that the shell of salt is unnessisary. I found the roast to be quite salty.

Amazing!  I am a foodie and this was amazing!  Best ever so far.  I just coated the Prime Rib with butter than salted the #$@# out of it.  And yes, like the other reviewer said, it does look like a snowball when you are done!  And yes, even though the recipe doesn't specify, you DO coat the cut ends with butter and your seasonings if you choose and then the kosher salt.  I brought the roast to room temp before I through it in the oven.  It was a five pound roast and at 215 degrees F it reached 130 degrees F in 2.75 hours with browning at 425 degrees F for the first 15 min.

The most amazing prime rib I have ever had!!!! I rubbed the meat with montreal steak seasoning prior to the salt rub. It added extra flavor! Super tender, melt in your mouth, restaurant quality results! This is the only way to make prime rib!

I served this roast for Easter Dinner a few months ago, and everyone LOVED it!  There is no danger of over-salting because the crust comes off after cooking and the meat is amazingly tender and flavourful underneath.  I bought enough to feed eight people (there were only six of us), and the entire roast was GONE...no leftovers!  I definitely plan to serve this recipe again.

I'v done the roast this way for years, except I sear the roast on all sides in a large frying pan first. I also, roast at 250 degrees, and take it out, when the temp. reaches 125 deg. rest for 45 min. covered in foil. I tie the roast between the ribs, so that it doesn't come apart.

I marinated my 8 pound plus prime rib for 2 days in an olive oil spice concoction.  I made my kosher salt snowball and baked it to 138 degrees.  My mistake was letting it rest for 20 minutes.  My family likes their meat medium rare, i.e. pink with no blood.  The thermometer read 150 and was more well done.  Like i said, my mistake.  If there is a next time, i will serve it immediately.  I felt as if i wasted $70.

add some fresh sage or rosemary while cooking(even better)fresh garlic will dry the meat out.

Have used this recipie for years, would not roast prime rib any other way. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to roast a prime rib.   I preferr rare and do not exceed 140 degrees in the oven. Roast will continue to rise in temperature once removed from oven. Very imoprtant to let roast rest at least 30 minutes once removed from oven, this helps set juices prior to slicing.

I cook prime rib like this every year at Christmas, except I use rock salt. It works just as well, and I use a disposable pan. I also rub my roast down with worcestershire before putting on the seasonings. There is never any left oversfrom this.

This didn't work for me. I am not sure what I did wrong or because the meat was small (about 2 lbs) but it did not crust except for the top. It was easy to remove there and the meat was moist and so good but every where else the salt didn't crust so I couldn't remove it. The meant was salty even though I tried to scrap it off. I think it is something I did and not the recipe so I don't want to give this a bad review. As I said, where I got it to crust (top) the meat was very good.

I had never made prime rib before and was so surprised at how amazing it turned out with such a simple recipe.  I did use a little bit of water with the kosher salt to make it stick to the outside of the prime rib.  I only made 2 pounds worth and it was done right around 2 hours after cooking. Great recipe, I will definitely be making this again!

Created a spice rub and rubbed it down the night before cooking. All the spices penetrated the meat and the salt crust made this so tender, even the most well-done pieces.

I have been making prime rib for 40 years and I am always willing to try new recipes for this delicious cut of meat.  I must say, this was the best I've ever had, even though I was a little apprehensive to put two cups of kosher salt on this expensive piece of meat.  It was absolutely awesome and I want to thank you for a delicious Christmas Day dinner.

To get the Rib Roast medium rare, 145 internal temp is WAY TOO HIGH.  Better off at 125.  Roast will still cook after taking off.  Cover roast with aluminum foil.  At 145 will make the meat medium at best.

I have made this for several years and it is just about the Best way to make roast beef!! This method does not make the meat real salty. It has a nice salt flavor and with added herbs such as rosemary, it is truly a lovely dish for Christmas or any special occasion. Thank You Marbalet! I will of course do this again and again!

Like others I was so skeptical of coating this expensive cut of beef with so much salt, but wow was this amazing! I didn't mix with a little water to make a paste but next time I will do this. There were a couple of pieces that I didn't get all the salt off that were a tad bit salty but nothing disgusting.  This really is an amazing way to cook prime-rib.  Also, DO NOT trim the fat from the roast...this is what makes it so yummy.

I cooked a 3-bone 5 1/4 lb prime rib.  To cook to designated temp. took about 3 1/2 hours.  It was pretty rare for my taste, but perfect for those that like their meat mooing still!  A quick run through the microwave with some of the sliced meat made it perfect.  I did coat the outside with dijon to help salt adhere as others had suggested.  Worked great.  I've wanted to cook a prime for years but was intimidated.  I'll do this again...soon!

What a fabulous recipe!! This is the best roast I have ever made. My family loved it. It was soooo moist and it had a wonderful flavor.

I preheated the oven to 500* as it stated in another review. After seasoning the roast, covering the bottom of the roasting pan with kosher salt and covering the roast with kosher salt I placed the roast in the oven for 15 minutes. I then turned the oven down to 325* unitl the internal meat temp reached 150*. I then turned the oven temp down to 275* until the internal temp of the meat reached 160*. I removed it from the oven,covered it with aluminum foil and allowed it to sit for 20 minutes. 

I used at 2.75 lb roast. My family likes both meat with red and meat with no red. We had plenty of both for everyone to enjoy. The cooking time was roughly 2.5 hours.

I will definatly be keeping the recipe and making this again and again.

2008 My family begs me to serve this often.  It is better than anything you can buy at the most expensive restaurants.
2015 Christmas dinner and I am still receiving requests for my prime rib for our family dinner.

The BEST prime rib recipe ever! I use a whole jar of minced fresh garlic and rub the whole roast (8-9 lbs) down with it to create a garlic layer. Then I add a layer of coarse black pepper. Then I drown it in salt so it looks like a giant snowball.... the more salt the better! Its a masterpiece- will never order in a restaurant again!!!

I just noticed I forgot to review this...  It was amazing!  So juicy...just thinking about it makes me want it again.  We made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it; meaning that there was nothing left that day.  The only thing we did different was that we cooked it on the grill.

Great!!  I served this on Christmas day and it was a big hit.  I was afraid that it was going to be too salty, but that was not the case.  Everyone loved the hint of salt taste on the outside.  I will be trying again.

Made this for Christmas eve dinner and it was fabulous.  Had some difficulty in getting the salt to stick on the sides, but I must have had enough to make it work.  I was expecting it to look like a cacoon.  I took it out a little too soon (135) - I thought the temperature would keep rising as it sat.  It didn't (low oven temp did't provide the extra heat,  I guess) and it was a little rarer than I like. Perfect for everyone else at the table, though.

This turned out great!  I did rub the roast with some dry red wine and crushed thyme before coating it with the salt.  I made a thin mushroom sauce on the side with some boxed beef broth and everyone said it was fantastic.  Will definitely use again!

Super Recipe!  We fixed this roast for Christmas Dinner, everyone raved about it.  The only change we made is that we cooked it on our Weber Grill at 325. Thanks so much we will fix our prime rib this way from now on.

This was a very tasty and juicy prime rib.  The salt keeps the juices from running out of the meat.  The only mistake I made was trying to roast potatoes with this roast, my old recipe where the juices basted the potatoes.  I'll keep using this recipe though.  I got my Prime Rib at Costco but it was boneless and cooked in less time than the recipe called for.  Also, I took it out at 150 degrees instead of 145 for medium and let it sit about 15 minutes, not 30.  It was delicious!

amazing!...i never cooked a prime rib before--was a bit nervous because when i told family how i was cooking it they seems leary with the idea of a slow roast but it came out perfect!!....i put slits in the meat and placed whole cloves of garlic in them to add some more flavor before placing it in oven....you won't be dissappointed!

this was extremely good/first time making prime rib which was very expensive but worth every penny.I cooked mine for 5 hours because my husband likes his meat well done but should have pulled it out after 4 1/2 still deliscious but I think 4 1/2 wouldve been perfect.Don't let the salt scare you-comes right off and doesn't leave the meat overly salty at all!!!Would make again easily.

I baked mine at a higher temperature, but ours turned out really good.  I coated the meat with kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper and fresh garlic and then wrapped the meat up plastic wrap over-night.  Would definitely make again.  I will also try this with other kinds of roasts.  It was a little salty on the ends for my parents, but otherwise very good. You've made me unafraid to make Prime Rib now!  Thanks for a good recipe, Holly.

Made this for Christmas dinner & it melted in our mouths!  I coated the roast in a mixture of garlic, thyme & olive oil and let it sit out an hour or so before crusting it with salt & baking.  To those who ended up with salty meat- perhaps you are using the wrong type of salt?  You cannot use table salt- it has to be kosher.  Awesome recipe!

I should have stuck with Emeril's recipe that I have used before. This was just too salty and trying to scrape off the salt crust did not work. It was a mess and still left the meat too salty around the outer portion. We had to pick around it and eat only the center. The cooking time and temp was way off after 5 hours I had to turn the temp up to cook the rib roast so we could eat. I will not make again.

As many of you know that follow me, I always try a recipe or restaurant at least 3 times before passing judgment on it. Such is the case here.

To begin with, I read all of the negative reviews and all but one or two were complaining about how salty this recipe was. Ladies and gents, that is NOT the recipe's fault, it is the cook's fault. Always make sure the meat is rolled and tied securely (if you have a boneless type) and ALWAYS, ALWAYS be sure to REMOVE ALL OF THE SALT before untying or carving the meat!!!

If you follow the directions of this recipe E-X-A-C-T-L-Y and remove all of the salt before untying or carving the prime rib, you will have a flawless result every time.

We purchased a much bigger roast....so baker be ware, cooking a 10 lb roast took us 8 hours. On the flip side everyone was so hungry that they said it was the best prime rib they ever had. I was a little nervous about the salt crust but be assured that it will literally peel off....no worries ;) LOVED IT

Terrific!! On the cut ends I coated with butter. And I preheated the oven to 450 and cooked the prime rib 15 minutes and then turned down for the rest of the time.

This was so moist and tender but salty!  I did scrape the salt crust off, but the flavor was still very powerful.  I will try it again with just the pepper and seasoned salt and see how it goes.  The meat almost melts in your mouth.  I used a round eye rib roast from Sam's Club for the meat.

This rub was delicious. I could see putting this on baked chicken too. The only ingredient I'll add less of the next time is the Kosher salt.

This is a very simple dish to make with a great teast to it.I cooked mine a little longer (only because my wife doesn't like the meat as rare as this) but even with that it came out great.I used a first cut meat (2 ribs cost about $50.00) and like others have said it was a hands off deal after it went into the oven.It does take more salt then 2 cup but when you brush the roast with ex-v it helps make the salt stick better and adds a little more taste to.Try it and you'll never cook it any other way

I used montreal steak and Jonnys seasoning salt hours prior to adding the salt over the top before cooking and it was great. Many butchers recommend montreal steak seasoning and now I know why.

This was superb! I won't need to go to a restaurant again. I had to add water to my salt to get it to stick to the sides. I used crushed garlic to season it. Excellent!

This was my first attempt at cooking prime rib and it turned out well.  Next time I will make the following changes:  1) mix water with the kosher salt so it will form a hard shell, 2) cook it to 150 or 155 degrees instead of 145 degrees, and 3) cook it in the oven (I used an electric oven).  The ribs on the bottom were rare in my opinion.  The ends/sides of the prime rib were medium well and as we worked our way toward the center the meat was medium and then medium rare.  I wanted a medium prime rib but overall the flavor was wonderful!  Most of my family really liked the flavor and doneness of the prime rib, but a few of them were really freaked out by the bright red meat on the ribs and in the center.  I will definitely try this recipe again and recommend it to others.  It was very easy to do.

Fabulous!  My first prime rib and I'm thrilled.  It will now become a Christmas tradition.  I added garlic powder to the Kosher salt and let sit in the fridge overnight.  Ours was a 8.5 lbs w/rib that took 5 1/2 hours to reach 145 temp - perfect.

Excellent.  I used a 6+ pound rib roast, and it cooked @ 4.5 hours to 145.  It was rare, and excellent.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Oh yea, I did add a little water to the salt to make a thick paste and the crust did pull right off at the end of cooking.  Yum!

Wonderful flavor! My husband tells people we don't go to the Outback anymore because my wife makes great prime rib at home! I start checking internal temp of meat at 3 hrs; has never taken 4 hrs but I do take meat out of frig several hours before cooking so it can come to room temp before hitting the oven.  I scrape salt off best I can but outside is very salty; I just tell people dont eat the edges. No one minds as the meat is fabulous! :)

We made this for Christmas dinner and everyone LOVED it.  Even one boy who said he hates Prime Rib went back for seconds.  We changed it up a little bit.  We added some thyme, garlic, and rosemary and rubbed that on the prime rib before we coated it with the salt.  It was so moist and juicy and delicious.  Will be making this again!

I prepared this recipe for Christmas dinner.  First time using this recipe but had to try it based on all of the reviews.  Very little prep time involved.  Followed the recipe for prepping the roast and used a meat thermometer to gauge doneness.  After resting the roast for approximately 20 minutes, I found that the salt crust on top of the roast was easily removed.  Roast came out medium rare, juicy and very tender.  I have shared this recipe with all of my family.  My thanks to Marbalet for sharing this fantastic recipe.

This recipe is excellent.  The only downer for me is that I cannot make gravy with the roast drippings because of the salt.  However, that small aspect aside, the salt gives you a perfectly moist and juicy rib roast.  Make sure you scrape off the salt crust before serving and do not skip the resting step.

I am not a steak person but we made this for Christmas Eve dinner - what a great decision.  I always thougth that the whole salt encusted thing was kind of a fad - but this is the way I will always cook prime rib.  We made it just as written with the exception that ours took a little longer to cook.  If you are worred about the meat being too salty - don't worry, it's perfect.

Some of the salt wanted to stick to all the lovely fat... which worried me. but it wasn't a lot and the guests LOVED IT. Even wanting some of the saltier bits i had tried to scrape off ;).  I had 8 guests with a 7 pound cut, with just a serving left for sandwiches. So juicy, yum! Easy i will do it again next year. can't wait :)

I've never made my own prime rib before this recipe. So far I've made twice and it is a new favorite for the holidays. The temp reading of 145 degrees was too rare for our family. I like it 10 degrees higher which seems more like medium rare to me. I also needed much more kosher salt to cover the roast.

This was delicious!  Raves from all!  I had a 7.5 pound rib roast ($112!) which I had at 225 for 6 hours - had to turn it up to 350 for another 2 hours at the end to get it to Med Rare.  I may have a slow oven - will make again!

I made this tonight for a New Years treat.  My husband could not speak because his mouth never emptied.  5 pound roast, 6hrs, perfection. I rubbed with garlic and pepper before covering it with salt paste. I was VERY concerned with amount of salt, but only the outside is salty, but still tastes great!!  Very juicy. This is the first time we've ever splurged on an expensive cut of meat and I'm so thankful I checked my favorite site before I tried to go it alone!!THANK YOU, and Happy New Year!!

Made this for my husband on his birthday.Used 4lb. Prime Rib Roast. Cooked it just as directions specified (especially since I have never made one before. He loved it so much he is still bragging about it to all his friends. I have since gave the recipe to several of my girlfriends. Cannot wait to make it again. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

Having only tried Prime Rib one other time, I was nervous to do this right for Christmas dinner. It was so easy and it came out so tender, juicy and flavorful! I will do it this way from now on. Yum Yum!

Hi Holly,  I just cooked a prime rib and went by your recipe and it was just wonderful.  It was a 4 lb prime rib, i cooked it at 210 degrees for 4 1/2 hours and came out medium to medium rare just the way I like it.  I was not salty at all.  I made a past of the kosher salt, but first sprinkled the meat with pepper, lemon seasoning, and put some olive oil on it and then the kosher salt.  Keep sending the great recipe's.  Thank again.
Cathy

absolutely delish!  Everyone ranted and raved about this roast! Not salty at all. The only thing I did different is stuff with garlic cloves and added more seasoning salt.  A must try and will be a regular at Christmas. I also want to try this method on other meats.  Thank you!!

I made this recipe 2 weeks in a row. The first week was a test run with my daughter and her boyfriend as my guinea pigs. That week I used a 5lb. roast. It came out as perfect as it could be. I followed the recipe to the letter. I made this again for Christmas eve dinner. This time, using a 11lb. prime rib, accompanied by a chessy squash casserole recipe I also found here. Again, it was perfect! The family couldn't get enough. No changes in recipe was neccessary if you watch your meat thermometer.

My first rib roast and it was easy. The salt really holds in the juices. I think the temperature is too low. I used 250 degrees for a 5.25 lb. roast and it came to temperature in 4.5 hrs. Lightly rub the roast with canol oil to hold the salt. Will definitely use this again.

First time I ever cooked prime rib was this way.  Roast was raw, the rest of the dinner was ready,  it was a disaster.  Meat so salty could barely eat it.

This is the worst recipe ever. Anyone who'd cook a Prime rib roast to 145 degrees needs to have their head examined. Anything beyond 120-125 is well done. Remember, you can always cook some slices more if needed but you can't reverse the process.

I only sprinkle the rock salt all over. a fair amount, then there is no taking it off, it's perfect and not too salty. Also, like some others, if you want rare/medium rare, then you only cook 115 to 120. it will rise another 10 degrees as it sits. if you want medium to we'll then cook longer, but that's kind of a waste for such a great cut of meat. There is another recipe on this site that is reverse seared prime rib. It's the best way and I  tried a few. you will love it

FABULOUS!  Followed the recipe to the letter.  After 4 hours in the oven, my meat thermometer read 150 degrees after done a 4 pound roast, but it was perfect!  Juicy and pink throughout... succulent!  My husband said it was the best Easter dinner he had ever had!  Looks like it'll be Prime Rib instead of a ham each Easter from now on!  Thanks for posting the recipe!

Made a rib roast before with another recipe and was sooo disappointed at the waste of money and time. Made this for Christmas eve family formal supper. 11.5lb boneless rib roast. Bought 4 10oz containers of kosher salt,  added water to make a "paste" of sorts and OMG...... This was the Bomb! Tender, Juicy, Flavorful and not salty in the least! My whole family adores me now, Thank you for an awesome recipe!!

Made this recipe for 6 people (3 bones ~9 pounds) had the butcher remove the bones then tie back on. Don't worry about the amount of salt used! Crust cracked off nicely! Since I was short on time I cooked it at 350 for 20 mins then decreased the temp to 270 for 3 hours until the meat thermometer hit 130. I removed it and let it rest for 30mins before cracking the crust off and slicing. It was a perfect med rare. Key element is to use all the salt the recipe asks for (I added water to the salt to make a paste so it would stick better) and follow the meat thermometer! the prime rib was soo juicy that the au jus I made on the side wasn't really needed. I won't look at any other recipe besides this. It was a success for my first time making prime rib!

Excellent way to roast a rib roast-does not have to be prime rib, works well with semi-boneless rib roast.  Did not use seasoned salt, has enough salt already.

Out-of-this-world-delicious!  Left-overs were even better.  I was concerned that the low/slow cooking method would take forever, but 6 lb rolled rib roast cooked perfectly in just over four hours - warm and pink throughout.  Meat was fork-tender,  juicy, and literally melted in my mouth .  Next time I hope to try additional herbs under the salt coating.  Salt on the bottom of the pan absorbed all the drippings, but clean up was as easy as rinsing out roasting pan.

Delicious.   Excellent easy recipe. I used this recipe plus put some garlic directly into the meat by slicing the cloves and inserting into slices made w/ a sharp knife.  Meat was incredibly tender and perfectly (rare) cooked!  Thank you!

I made this on Christmas and received rave reviews from the entire family!  I made an 11.5 lb. roast and it didn't take much longer to reach 145.  Excellent recipe!

Ok, so my entire family saw me take it out of the oven and they were REALLY concerned ... but this was the most tender, moist perfectly done rib roast I have ever cooked!   I did make a paste of the salt, as was suggested by several reviewers.  With the salt I added rosemary and a LOT of fresh pressed garlic.  Neither my husband or son like their meat rare.  When we cut the roast, it looked like it might be too rare, but it was not - the texture was so wonderful!  Mmm, mmm good!  Awesome!  My husband says we WILL be doing this again.

Ours  was a 3  lb roast and it  came out perfectly at 3 hours. 1/2 the roast was medium rare and the other half  was slightly more rare. Perfect how we like it.

Prime rib is great.  I'd allow for additional time as I was cooking by a meat thermometer and it just took that.

Wow! Happy New Year welcomes this recipe.
What a big hit. I can't wait for the next holiday so I can make this again.
I combined fresh crushed garlic,olive oil,black pepper,and seasoned salt and rubbed that mixture on the roast before heavily salting.Cooked it just like the recipe states. Came out perfect @ 145 degrees.
 Make sure you have enough for leftovers. I slice what's left into half inch pieces and put them on the grill to reheat. WOW!!!
Enjoy

I will confess to being hesistant to try this recipe; I had never cooked a rib roast before and this seemed a tad on the experimental side with all that salt.

I'm so glad I took the plunge!  The meat was very moist and flavorful.  I will certainly be making this recipe again in the future.

My only (slight) modifications were scoring the top layer of fat, topping the the roast with minced garlic and fresh rosemary (in addition to the seasoning called for in the recipe).

We have made this several times over the past few years and love it every time.  We've even frozen leftovers and then reheated months later to fabulous results.  This is the only way to cook a rib roast.

This was the best prime rib.  I made it for Christmas and my picky eaters even liked it.  They could not get enough.  I roasted the prime rib at 200 degrees for about 5 hours to medium doneness and did not change a thing on the recipe.  Very good.

This is the best prime rib I have ever had. I was very nervous when all the salt was applied to this very expensived piece of meat, but much to my suprise, it was absolutely perfect!  My guest raved, while I sat back and accepted their praises gracefully.  I've made this several times now. I use alot of salt. So that the whole thing is covered like at least a half of an inch. Don't worry. It's stupendous!

I made this roast for Christmas Eve dinner and it was very good.  I don't really understand why the recipe called for so much salt--about half never even touched the roast, and I used a 5.5lb roast.  We watch our salt intake, so some bites of the roast were too salty.  I will fix this again, but next time I will cut the salt in half and see how we like it.  I also used about 2-3 T of cajun seasoning on the roast rather than the seasoned salt.  It was good that way.  Overall, you can follow this recipe with confidence but if you watch your salt intake, this will probably pretty salty for you.  And make sure you use kosher salt--regular salt is even saltier and would probably ruin the roast.

This recipe is great!  It is very easy to make and does not take more than a few minutes to put together.  I used a 3lb Prime Rib Roast, and cooked it for about 3 hours until it reached 145.  Next time I will probably cook it until it reaches 150 degrees, it was a little on rare side for us, but we still enjoyed it!  Because of the cost, I will probably just save this for special occasions.

My rating has to be taken with a grain of "salt" (no pun intended). I did not use the whole 2 cups of kosher salt..even for an 11 lb. prime rib. I was too scared after seeing how much 2 cups of kosher salt was. Also, I did not use the whole amt of pepper and I added some thyme. The prime rib was good, but not great. I don't know, I guess I was just afraid to ruin Christmas dinner. Next time, I'll try with a small roast just on my immediate family and follow exactly. Also, I cooked at 425 for 15 min and then reduced heat to about 275. The 11 lb roast was done in 3 hours. One recommendation....if you want med. rare...USE A GOOD MEAT THERMOMETER...I didn't and mine was too medium for our tastes.

Turned out very juicy and yummy. So simple to make. The whole family loved it. Quite salty even after the salt was scraped off but I didn't hear many complaints from the family. No ooohh's and mmMmmmMm's but overall it was good enough to make again.

It came out waaaaay too salty.  Even after discarding the crust.  In general it was a mess and not worthy of such an expensive cut of meat.

It was good but a little salty for my taste. Others liked it, but I would put less salt if to make this recipe again.

I make this every year for Christmas and it always turns out perfect. I dry age my prime rib in the fridge for a few days before as well. Just clean and prep the meat and place it on a drying rack over something that will catch any drippings. Dry as best you can and cover loosely but completely with paper towels. Then put it in your fridge for up to a few days before cooking. It concentrates the flavor so much and really makes it pop!

the best ever!! Incredibly tender and flavorful. Only regret is that there is no "au jus" because the salt soaks it up-but really not needed.  ONe change--at the end, we blasted it at 425 for ten minutes

This is the first and most delicious prime rib I have ever made and tasted.  I have always been too intimidated to make prime rib.  I got a 6 pound roast and left it in the oven for 5 hours.  Never opening the oven door to check it.  When I took it out it was 145 degrees.  A little higher than I wanted.  So, I didn't wait the 30 minutes to cut it.  It was delicious.  I will no longer go to a steak house for prime rib.  I will make my own..

I've been making this for years. I worked at a high end restaurant in my younger years where they cooked prime rib this way. They used a spray bottle to lightly dust the top of the salt with water. Works every time. Do not cover the roast with foil or lid.

I want to make this but I have a question.  The recipe says to put the salt on the bottom of the foil.  But then it never says what to do with the foil.  Do you wrap it around the meat or do you leave the roast open?  Thanks!  Sorry, I had to leave a star rating in order to post this.  I left 5 stars even though I haven't tried it.

Make sure to use coarse ground salt.  I have been BBQing this with a whole tenderloin for  50 years.  Wrap in thick brown paper and throw onto the coals.  The salt crust just cracks easily and it is the best steak ever.

I have never cooked a whole ribeye, and I was pretty nervous about this, and worried I would ruin such an expensive portion of meat. It turned out absolutely amazing. One of the most delicious things I have ever cooked! The family loved it. Followed the recipe as directed. It was a thing of beauty :)

This is a wonderful recipe!  Do not be afraid to be generous with the kosher salt.  In order to form the salt crust, you must lay it on thick.  The  crust which will indeed break off easily once the roast has cooked and cooled down.  If you fail to add enough salt to form the crust, you will end up with salt saturated meat.  One minor change I made was to slather the meat with olive oil and chopped garlic prior to salting.  Excellent taste!

Served this for a small dinner party and received no complaints.  The meat was tender and juicy and only the end piece was "to salty" ( I did not get all of the salt off the posterior end area prior to carving ).  I did follow the recommendation to moisten the meat with water to get the salt to stick to the edges and sides, this worked really well to create a " total encrusting ."  My rationale for giving this 3 stars vs. 4 is that by using the salt encrusted method you do not end up with usable drippings for au jus. I made au jus from beef broth using another recipe and it was not bad, however, I do like using drippings for sauces and graveys.

Flavor was delicious, and meat was juicy and tender.  However, it needed to be pulled from the oven at a lower temp.  It continued to cook past where I expected it to, even using the meat thermometer.  I pulled it at 140F and it was medium rare.

I made this last year and am making it again this year, and will continue to make it because it truly is the best, juiciest prime rib! Sounds crazy, but it is delicious!  You have to make a paste with the salt then apply it to your prime rib and then gently put in the oven.  You don't want the salt to crack , then when done scrap off the salt and place on plate for carving.

This is the best, juiciest roast that I have ever made! Like others, I added a little water to the salt to make it more paste-like and I covered the roast in cheesecloth. I seasoned the roast with finely chopped garlic. I took it out of the oven when it reached 120 degrees, which was "blood rare." The end pieces were a bit salty.

This recipe is the BEST! The roast came out perfect. I unfortunately "over cooked" it which just means for us instead of medium rare it was medium. This is how I'll be making all of our prime ribs from now on. Btw I used a 7.5 lb roast

So easy and the flavor was amazing. I covered with Dijon mustard to hold the salt. Will insert slivers of garlic into slits in the beef next time like suggested. I went with digital meat thermometer. It says 145 degrees for medium rare, but I should've pulled it at 130 degrees. It came out medium well. But everyone still raved about it and there were no leftovers. Will definitely make again.

Amazing recipe and right on the money. Yes, it is a little on the salty side. However, the end results is a perfect, restaurant quality Prime Rib. Whether you sear it first, rub mustard on it, or add whatever you want to the rub mix, the low and slow cooking method on top of a bed of kosher salt leaves you with an extremely tender and flavorful roast. 
In fact, at one party where I cooked this meal a couple met and later went on to get married. Was it the roast or love at first sight? Who knows, but at their wedding reception they served Prime Rib :)

I have been using this recipe for a few years and the roast comes out perfect every time.  I do rub the roast with minced garlic and pepper, but that's just to add more flavor (not that it needs it) because my family loves garlic.

I thought I had kosher salt but I only had coarse sea salt - result was excellent - family loved it - tender and juicy. Salt brushed off easily. Will be making it again.

I’ve made this 5 times and it’s actually really amazing. Having said that, I did marinate it for 3 days in a vacuum sealed bag full of Traeger Prime Rib Rub, olive oil, minced garlic, and sage. I mix them all together and make a paste. Then I cover it in Kosher Salt. I use 4.5 lbs for 3 adults.

Forgot to add in my original review that I did tweak this a little, I added water to the salt and made a paste, which I then applied to the  roast.  This way after baking the salt little made a hard crust that I was able to break right off with no residue on the meat. Enjoy!

This recipe is amazing and easy!  I have made it 3x now, and it's always great.  One thing I did last time was to add a little water to the salt to make a paste and it came off easier.  You can't mess this recipe up ( unless you buy a cheap piece of meat, even then it may still be ok) Thanks for posting!

my aunt has a similar recipe using rock salt, but i never thought of using kosher salt. i followed the cooking instructions of this recipe, but prepped the meat her way: studding the roast with halved garlic cloves, seasoning with soy sauce, garlic salt, and pepper. if you like the outer portion of the roast pretty salty (like we do) you should try this. 

the roast came out perfectly med-rare when internal temp reached 140 F, after about 4 hours. the temp did not rise while resting, so i would recommend cooking your roast to how you like it done. the only thing i would change is next time i'm buying a better piece of meat to improve the tenderness.

An absolute family favorite, we have used this recipe for several years now.  Be sure to buy extra salt until you learn how much you need for your pan.

Perfect in every way, and so easy!  This was my first time to make prime rib, so I was nervous.  With this recipe, all you need is a meat thermometer, and it will be perfect.  The only alteration I made was to use my creme brulee torch on the remaining fat on the top, once I brushed off the salt, just for the sake of appearance.  Everyone loved it, my hubby said it was better than any restaurant, and he's picky about beef.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

At the request of family, I smoked my prime rib instead of putting it in the oven. I pulled it when the thermometer registered med. rare. This was an awesome recipe. The whole family loved it. I'll use it again for sure. Thanks!
