Great flavor from the variety of seasonings!  I served this for brunch topped with an egg.  My air fryer does not go up to 400F, so I cooked it at the 390F preset. At 10 mins, the bacon (1/2" pieces) was starting to burn, so I think next time I will add the bacon in halfway through cooking.  A nice change of pace from the usual hash browns at breakfast.

I make this a couple times a week for breakfast. I donâ€™t use sweet potatoes, I use baby golden or other kinds of the gourmet potatoes. I chop the bacon up into small pieces and in make the scrambled eggs in a skillet and combine the cooked potatoes and bacon into the skillet with the scrambled eggs. I warm my tortillas and throw cheese and red chili on top and enjoy!

We really liked this. I had to use cubed pancetta, which cooked a bit more than I would have liked but we still enjoyed it. I also increased the amount of bacon. Keeping the size of the yams in proportion to the bacon is essential. This goes very well with eggs. Thank you for the recipe.

The seasoning amounts were great. We did not use bacon and it took twice as long to cook in our air fryer.  Maybe next time I'll add a little water to increase cook time if we don't use bacon again.

Delicious - a keeper for sure! I doubled the bacon (we love bacon), and it still turned out really well. The seasoning is just the right amount!
