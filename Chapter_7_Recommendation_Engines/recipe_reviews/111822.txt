I work with quite a few avid hunters, though venison is rather new to me as a cook.  They all know I love to cook, so they keep bringing me in venison - of course they also know I'll make something with it, then bring it in for them to eat!  Anyway, looking for new things to try and found this - wonderful!!  Everyone loved it!  I made biscuits and gravy with this sausage and everyone came back for seconds....and thirds!!  Thanks for taking the time to share the recipe!

Excellent recipe! I was able to use up some venison roasts as well as make a more healthy breakfast sausage. I did add a bit more sage as that is my taste, I do appreciate the suggestion to try a sample before freezing. Thanks alot!

Terrific recipe, AmynJohn!  We have 3 hunters under one roof and using all that venison can be a challenge before the next season rolls around.  This will definitely help to use up the meat.  We used Adobe seasoning instead of the curing mixture since I could not find the Morton's one you suggested.

The entire family (even Grandma!) enjoyed our sausage gravy and biscuits this morning.

This sausage taste great. We couldn't find any of the Tender Quick so we added some bacon to the mix. Makes excellent meatballs by adding onion and bread crumbs.

We love ground Venison for Chili and the Breakfast Vension sausage.  Crumble and brown ground venison sausage, add 2 tsp brown sugar while browning.  Drain.  Roll out 2 pks of Crescent Rolls and spread with shredded cheese and the crumbled cooked sausage and roll up in a roll.  Pinch ends and seam and slice in thin slices, lay on non-stick sprayed foil lined cookie pan and bake at 375 until browned (you can spinkle more cheese on top before baking).  They a are fab and you won't know the diff. b/t trad sausage rolls and venison sausage rolls.  Mine were a huge holiday hit!

This is a great recipe. I spiced it up to suite out taste a little. Instead of ground pork, I used a cheaper brand of pork sausage that was mostly fat. It mixed in well and the patties fried up real brown and juicy. Thanks for sharing.

I rarely review, but I had to this time! I really don't care for game meat, but my husband is a hunter and I needed something to do with all the "venison burger" we have. This recipe is excellent! I did say I modified this a bit because I am allergic to pork. I omitted the pork and used a pound of ground venison we had frozen (I thawed it). I adjusted the spices a bit since the original recipe calls for more meat than I used. I also used some onion salt and fennel seeds ( a pinch). I used about 1/8 cup of brown sugar. I formed into patties (instead of freezing) and fried in a nonstick skillet with olive oil. There was no "game" taste to this and it is so tasty to me since I can't have typical pork sausage. Thank you for this recipe!!!

Love this recipe!  My husband brought home about 20 pounds of ground venison and we both wanted it made into sausage.  I only made a couple small changes.  I added 1 tsp. onion powder and 1 tsp. fennel seeds.  The recipe would be great without them but I love my fennel.  I think it's a bit spicy which is fine by me but I think I will cut the peppers in half for a mild version for my son.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'm making venison sausage gravy and biscuits tonight.  Mmmmm!

This is AMAZING! I have never reviewed on allrecipes before, but just had to as this is a fabulous recipe. I halved the recipe and it was perfect, we ended up making more. We find we like it best in very thin patties on breakfast sandwiches (eng. muffin, egg and cheese). It turns kind of red when it's done for some reason, but its still delicious! We have also used goose in place of the venison. It isn't as good as the venison to me, but my husband loves it just as well!
Thanks for putting up this recipe!!! We LOVE it!!!

Wonderful!  The perfect amount of spicy and yummy!  I absolutely hate venison but when it comes to venison sausage and jerky I am happy as long as it is seasoned well.  This stuff is wonderful and a keeper!  If you hate the taste of venison give this recipe a try.  Thanks for sharing.  We added 1 tsp of Caraway Seed to our sausage as well (hubby loves that stuff).

This is one of the greatest sausage recipes I have had.  We added 1 TBSP of fennel in ours which created a really great flavor.  Maybe next time we will add some cummin.

very tasty and juicy for venison.  I did use pork fat from the local butcher.  They will grind it for you or you can grind it. It didnt look very seasoned but when cooked it turned out great!!  Definitely making this next year.

I used ground mixed peppercorns instead of black peppercorns.  I shaped them into bigger patties, dipped the refrigerated patties in beaten egg and rolled them in Ritz cracker crumbs before freezing.  I've made pork sausage like this for a meat serving for supper.  I'm planning to lightly spray the skillet with cooking spray when I fry them as the patties were still a bit lean.

We  are first time venison cooks this year.  This breakfast sausage is GREAT just as the recipe reads.  I don't know what morton tender quick is, I used meat tenderizer hoping it's the same thing.  I mixed up this recipe, cooked all the sausages as patties, and froze them for breakfast sandwiches.  I did make half a batch in case we didn't like it, we'll be making a full batch next time!  Thanks!

Very good. I use elk meat. I added more red pepper flakes.  DO Not add fennel seed, unless you want Italian sauage. Was a little sticky, because of the brown sugar.  Helps to have two people when wrapping.  I will use this again!!!

I haven't tried this recipe, but I could find no other way to ask a question about it!  Do you have to add pork?  Would it be icky if I just used ground venison?
Also, I saw you are from Hanceville, AL.  I'm related to everyone there.  Seriously.  My dad grew up there and he's from a big family.  :)

This is an excellent recipe. Due to food allergies, i have only been able to eat eggs, chicken or fish for morning protein. I had to substitute ground lamb for the pork. Breakfast sausage! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Going up the middle as I have not made this yet but am pinning it for hunting season. (Fingers crossed!) It sounds divine!

For those of you that cannot find the Morton Tenderquick you can make your own. Use a ratio of 2:1 KOSHER (large grain) salt to brown sugar. I do this for my summer sausage since my tiny farmburg doesn't carry it either.

Excellent!  So glad I listened to the reviewers.  It seemed too simple to be delicious but this is a great way to use your venison.  We too like it more spicy but the recipe stands alone as terrific.  Stars should not be demoted because of preference but because of formula/recipe failure.

This is an awesome recipe!  I like the little bit of sweet the brown sugar gives the meat.  The only substitution we made to the original recipe was to use 1 1/2 lbs of bacon instead of the ground pork.  Thank you AMYNJOHN36 for sharing this recipe!

My first time making homemade sausage and I'm so glad I did.  I couldn't be happier!! This recipe is worthy of 10 stars!!  It's awesome.  I've saved the recipe and will be passing it on to the rest of my family.  My husband and his brother hunt we can't wait for next deer season!!!  Thank You AMYNJOHN36

I scaled the recipe to 32 servings, making 4 pounds to try before making a full batch. Definitely a keeper. We normally send our venison in for sausage but not anymore! This had just the right amount of seasoning for an excellent flavor. No need to change a thing. Thanks for a great recipe.

Cure quick or cure can be purchased directly from Morton Salt, go to their website to order. I use the sugar cure in the recipe. Purchase a fatty pork butt, cut the meat off the bone in chunks that will fit your grinder, grind it with the right proportion of venison. Mix in the spices and grind again. I roll into ~1/2# logs and freeze. Either vacumn seal or wrap in freezer plastic and then aluminum foil.

This is hands down the BEST breakfast sausage recipe for game meat ... and so easy! We've tried it with both elk and venison. With elk, we didn't even add any pork fat and it was wonderful. Other than that, we followed the instructions exactly and it is the best ... no need to mess with the recipe, just make it as-is. Make twice as much as you think you'll need ... trust me, you'll be glad you did.

I'm always looking for new and easy things I can do with my venison other than plain burger or roasts.  This recipe was very easy and tastes great.  I just mixed up my first batch and did a test cook of 3 patties.  I was very impressed.

Perfect. No changes necessary! Tender quick is hard to find in our local grocery stores, but they carry it in our hardware store, in the canning/jarring aisle.

I made this with a mixture of venison and rabbit totally lacked any breakfast sausage taste. I doubled the sage but still no taste. Won't be making this again.

Just didn't like it, since (to me) it was too unlike regular (pork) breakfast sausage.  I even increased the amount of pork (half pork, half venison), and it still had much more of a hamburger taste rather than sausage.  I know venison will never taste like pork (I process and cook plenty of venison each year), but this just didn't fit the bill.

A friend gave us some ground venison.  I tried this sausage patty recipe and it was fine, but my husband did not like it at all.  the next day I  tried to hide it in a breakfast casserole recipe and he identified it immediately and turned his nose away.  I ended up using it up in my own breakfast sandwiches layering the sausage patty, fried egg and cheese on a toasted bagel.  I liked it.

I backed off on the sage a little, just because I'm not a huge fan of sausage with too much sage so I was cautious. Did the substitution for the curing mix since I couldn't find it. Overall turned out excellent! Will make this again!

The seasonings were perfect on the first try! But I admittedly made some modifications and additions - I used equal parts venison and ground pork. I didn't have the curing salt so I replaced with equal parts salt and brown sugar, as reviewers suggested. I doubled the amount of sage called for, and added a pinch each of onion powder and cloves. Delicious!

I tried this last weekend.  I really like this recipe.  I halved all of the amounts, and it came out great.  This recipe is a keeper, and I'll continue to use it to make venison and pork breakfast sausage.

We absolutely love this recipe!!!! It's easy to make and addictive to eat. We'll definitely be making this again and highly recommend. It is a very mild sausage, so we added a little more sage and a lot more red pepper. Even with those additions it was still mild, but still very tasty. Thinking I might try using hot Italian seasoned pork to give it a little heat kick. Even without the heat, it's still very good! My husband likes it mild anyway. It doesn't taste games at all! We made it into large patties for sandwiches. It'd be great for biscuits and gravy or just breakfast patties. Soooo good! Think we might go eat a sausage sandwich now. :-)

Instead of ground pork.  I just bought some cheap pork sausage with sage in it.  50 cents a pound.  Mixed 50/50 with deer meat.  Then added this receipe.  turned out nice.  Wife loves it.  She doesnt eat link sausage, so we make a lot of pan sausage.  I also pre form patties before freezing, so I dont have to defrost them, when at the lease.

This is my go to recipe for breakfast sausage!  My family loves it. I have also used it with pork instead of venison. Both work really well. You will not be disappointed by this. As your mixing it keep a pan hot and fry some up so you can get the spices to your liking.

This was great!  The only thing I changed was instead of the pork, I used ground beef (73/27 - I think).  Kept the seasonings the same.  Definitely a keeper!!!  Thanks!

My first batch of this sausage came out great!  My family is not very big on sage so I used 1 1/2 tsp, half the called for amount.  It has a very nice sweet flavor.  I will try to add some additional pepper, both crushed red and black in my next batch to kick it up a bit.  Looking forward to making a big batch of sausage gravy with it and serving it over steamy fresh biscuits!
