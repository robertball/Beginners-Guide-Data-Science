Flora, you have come up with a cake mix winner in my book! In many of my reviews I've mentioned my general disdain for cake mixes, but I do love toying with them and occasionally I come across one that sets itself apart. I have never seen another recipe like this one, wanted to give it a try, and wanted to make it a Lemon Poppy Seed Pound Cake. I started by soaking 1/4 cup of poppy seeds in 1/4 cup milk for two hours. For the cake, I did use the lemon cake mix, but wanted to make sure it was good and lemony and, more important, didn't have that typical boxed cake mix taste. For the 3/4 cup milk called for, I replaced 1/4 cup with fresh lemon juice. I mixed it with 1/2 cup milk and let it set till it curdled. After mixing up the batter I added the poppy seed/milk mixture and the grated zest of one lemon. I finished the cake with a simple glaze of fresh lemon juice and powdered sugar. My, was this good! Finally, a cake mix "pound cake" that really has the dense, moist crumb of a true pound cake. And the cake is truly, refreshingly lemony. Simply excellent, and I can't help but think it would be just as wonderful with other cake mixes as well!

I made this cake as written, and it was very good, but could have been more lemony.  I did make a simple glaze of lemon juice, lemon zest and powdered sugar and that pumped up the tartness, but next time I think I will add some juice and zest to the cake, too.  I like cakes that start with a mix.  They are quick, easy, and usually turn out quite good.  Thanks for another one to add to my collection.

I just made this the other day and it turned out great. I followed the other reviewers suggestion by replacing some milk with lemon juice and it was yummy I did not do a glaze just dusted with powdered sugar could not have been simpler thanks for sharing such an easy recipe !!

Not very pound cake-y, but a keeper.  I did use 1/4 c. lemon juice to sub in for some of the milk as others suggested.  And I did use a white cake mix as that's all I had.  Will try the lemon cake mix next time.  Also, used a lemon glaze on top.

Made with an 1/8th cup substituted with lemon juice not milk and it was pretty good. Depending on my lemon craving I may want to increase to 1/4th. Not as heavy as i wanted but thats okay.

Very good, with great reviews from the people who ate it, although not as moist as I would have liked. I followed the recommendations by the previous reviewer, replacing 1/4 milk with fresh squeezed lemon juice, and using her recommended lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze. I made it as a 2-layer 9" round with glaze between layers. I will definitely make it again, maybe adding some additional milk or lemon juice.

I liked this recipe.  I made a few changes:  I added a box of instant lemon pudding mix, a tsp of lemon extract, and some lemon zest.  I then put a lemon glaze made of lemon juice, powdered sugar and butter.

Delicious and Moist. The cream cheese blended with the milk to a light mixture. I knew right then that this cake was going to be light and moist.

Very dry but it was helped by some vanilla icecream.  I used nonfat buttermilk and neufchatel cheese.  Baked exactly 42 minutes, done just right.

This was a really easy cake to make and wasn't bad although it certainly wasn't the best I've ever had. I followed the directions exactly and found that the cake browned too much so if I ever make this again I might take it out sooner rather than later.  It was also a heavy cake which I wasn't expecting (first pound cake I've ever made) but a few people commented that pound cakes are supposed to be heavy.  Who knew? I would prefer a lighter cake so I think I'll explore some other pound cake recipes.

I seriously enjoyed this! and so did everyone else who tried it. The thing is I HATE boxed cake and this tasted nothing like a boxed cake. I too put a glaze on it with Fresh lemon juice and powdered sugar (which was excellent). So fresh and light. Delicious!

This was a good lemon cake but not dense and heavy like a pound cake should be.  We couldn't tell that it had cream cheese in it.  Also after my family tried it, we decided it needed a lemon glaze to perk it up a bit.
