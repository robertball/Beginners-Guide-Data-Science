I owe it all to this recipe. This is the first recipe that I made from this website for a Family Labor Day Celebration 2 years ago. I put the cake down and sat down for a game of cards and turned around and wondered what all the commotion was about. I walked over to where the cake was (atleast what was left) and those people had scraped the platter clean. Since then I have made minor changes though. And they are still scraping the platter clean. Now I make 1-1/2 of the cream cheese frosting recipe. Please use the real key limes for the juice to go into the frosting, I know they are a pain to squeeze, but the taste is amazing. Don't be afraid to add another Tbs. of Key Lime Juice either. Then I make sure that I add atleast 2 tsp. of Meringue Powder for a firm icing. And lastly, I add atleast another cup or so of powder sugar to kindof work with the tart Key Lime Juice. But I like the sweet and tart to play off of one another. Enjoy!!!

I love this cake. It is very rich. I like to make my frosting with just a little lime jello mixed in it gives it a lovely green color. I also add chopped pecans to the frosting. We have topped this cake with cherries or strawberries for the red and green christmas colors.

This recipe is DELICIOUS. I made cupcakes with it. I did add the zest of a small lime and fresh lime juice to the batter, for some extra lime flavor. I also used 5 eggs and 3/4 cups of oil instead, as previous reviewers suggested. I tried one without frosting, it was moist and light and the flavor was delicious. I frosted them with "Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site (with lime juice and zest instead of lemons). I used fresh limes for everything. With the frosting, the cupcakes really do have a tangy lime flavor. Mmmm mmmm mmm, just what I was looking for!

This is a very delicious, easy to make cake. I'm giving it 3 stars because I'm an advanced baker that believes the recipe can be improved.  The cream cheese icing can turn out a bit runny due to the nature of cream cheese, not the recipe itself. Sometimes cream cheese is just stubborn to deal with. I suggest refrigerating the icing 20-30 minutes prior to iceing the cake.  Also, refrigerate it overnight before serving it if possible. This will help set the icing and the cake and will NOT affect the fresh factor.  Also, the cake is plenty moist with 1 cup of oil. Last I believe to bump this cake up to 4-5 stars, lemon pudding should be used in the place of the lime gelatin. The lime gelatin doesn't really do anything to flavor the cake anyway because of the orange juice. That's mostly for the color. You should be able to use a drop or two of green food coloring w/o it affecting taste to give it a light "lime" coloring. Using the pudding should make it more smooth tasting and will eliminate the grit and the crumbling of the bread some reviewers noticed. Using a fresh lime, I suggest you flavor the icing to taste. Fresh lime is strong and you will use less liquid which will help the icing stay firm. If you like a true, strong key lime flavor in the cake, some of the oj HAS to be substituted for lime juice concentrate. I'm trying it this way next time.

I have now made this cake probably about 75 times. I have become known for this cake amongst my family, friends and extended family and friends. People actually pay me to make this cake for them, especially when they are entertaining guests. Mostly I go simply by the recipe instructions. I don't lessen the oil at all as I've read some do. Yes it seems like a lot of oil. I've made this cake COUNTLESS times and it still seems like a lot of oil every time but it works! I don't add anything to the batter except the recipe ingredients. What I do change though is the lime juice. Instead I use True Lime packets which is real lime juice dried into a powder form. True Lime gives the frosting the PERFECT key lime flavor with the right flavor balance without adding liquid to the frosting. When I take this cake to a function I can never leave without giving out my number for requests. I gave out the recipe once and she lessened the oil and she said it was a horrible mistake! So I don't give the recipe anymore. Also I bake this cake at 325 instead of 350!!! 350 is too high, bake at 325 for about 35 to 40 mins, depending on your oven, let pans stand for exactly 10 mins, remove from pan and let cakes cool COMPLETELY before assembling.

Though I prefer "from scratch" cakes my family loved this recipe.  Very moist with a good lime flavor and bright green color which contrasted nicely with the white frosting.    My layers baked in 20 minutes and I had to double the frosting ingredients (except for the lime juice) to get enough frosting to adequately cover the layers, top and sides of cake. The frosting was very good with this cake, however, because it offset the cakes sweetness.   Overall, I would make this cake again.

I made this cake for a luau theme party this weekend and it was a smash hit. Everyone raved about it. Due to a two hour travel time to the party, I made it in a disposable alum foil 9X13 cake pan. I'm not sure if it was my oven or because I baked it in a thinner pan, but the cake baked much faster than the directions on the box.  I also had read the reviews and had noticed several people indicated the icing was very rich. So I cheated and bought a can of Betty Crocker cream cheese frosting and added the key lime juice to it. Absolutely perfect! I won the prize for best dessert at the party and believe me there were some good ones. Mine was the first one consumed down to the crumbs!

I made this for a shower with a "mexican" theme. It was a big hit, I had lots of people ask for the recipie. I loved it, nice flavor. I even used apple sauce for the oil to make it "lighter". This is an easy cake that tastes great!!

This is probably one of the best cakes I have made.  It was very simple but very delicious.  Thanks!  Adding a little lime zest to the frosting was really tasty.

First the good point: The icing was terrific and when thinned would be a great dip for strawberries. 
That said: This cake is too sweet; it tastes like a cake mix with lime jello in it; it looked horrible (ugly green color); it needs to be made as a sheet cake instead of a two or three-layer cake. I think I will just stick with key lime pies. The idea was nice but I won't be trying this one again.

Very good cake, liked by all.  I only put 2 Tblsp of the lime juice in the frosting.  That was plenty, it didnt need anymore, would have been way to tart.

Overly sweet, especially the icing. Sorry to say that the family would not eat it after their first bites, and I had to throw it out. Would not recommend!

I was looking for a recipe to make a key lime cake from scratch but could only find cake mix recipes.  Nonetheless, this turned out pretty well.  As other users suggested, I used 5 eggs instead of 4, reduced the oil to 3/4 cups, and I substituted concentrated key lime juice for the orange juice with a little lime zest added.  I also paired the cake with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site with walnuts mixed in.  Overall, everyone loved it!  Next time, I will probably try this recipe with white cake mix as the lemon flavor was somewhat dominant.

I have been making this cake for around 10 years.  Everyone I know loves it.  I make it in a bundt pan and replace most of the orange juice with rum.  Then I double the frosting and fill the center of the cake with the extra and surround the cake plate with strawberries to be dipped in the frosting.  oh I also actually slice the bundt into two layers and fill it with some of the frosting too.  Then just frost the top the best i can.  It looks great with lime twist on top and then the red strawberries around it.

This recipe is good however, I did make one change. I decreased the amount of oil to 1/2 cup. The first time I made this recipe I used the amount of oil it originally called for. The cake came out soggy with a wet texture. When I reduced the amount of oil to 1/2 cup the cake came out light and fluffy with a moist and tender crumb.

I made this a few years ago and took to a family reunion. Was a huge hit. I am now required to bring this to all subsequent family reunions. My adult kids love to watch and keep track of how fast it disappears. Just left a reunion today and my dad informed me that I would have to bring 2 next year. The only thing I do different is add lime zest to the cake and the frosting. I have used both key limes and regular limes. Can't tell the difference. Thanks for sharing this recipe and my family thanks you!

Didn't do 5 stars, because I have had to work to perfect it. So, here are my changes.
Instead of Orange Juice, I do 3/4c LimeAid + 1/4c Key Lime Juice. I only do 3/4c oil. For the lime Jello, I used the sugar free variety (there is already enough sugar in the cake & icing, so you wont miss it). Prior to making these changes, it kept falling on me (I think mostly because of the added oil), and it had an odd texture. An OK one, but odd. And, it was a little too sweet for me, which is saying something, because I like my sweets :)

Loved the idea, but wanted more true lime flavor and lower fat.  Used a white cake and egg whites only, applesauce instead of oil, zested 3 limes into the cake (1 into the frosting), no jello, used sweetened lime juice instead of orange.  Substituted neufchatel for cream cheese in the frosting.  Colored the frosting instead of the cake.  The lime flavor popped, cake was moist and not too heavy.  Neither the cake nor frosting were too sweet with all the modifications.  It was a big hit!

This cake is delicious! BUT I do NOT put lime juice in the icing. The contrast between the cream cheese icing & the lime flavor of the cake is what makes the cake. Lime juice in the icing was just too much.

This recipe is a great summer treat. I make it in a 9x13 pan to save time and for easy transportation. I also use fresh key limes for the lime juice and use my microplane to garnish the top of the cake. Pretty and refreshing too!

I read the reviews, and didn't use orange juice or lemon cake. Used white cake, 1/3 c key lime juice and dissolved the gelatin in the juice. Added 2/3 cup coconut milk and a 2 tsp rum flavoring with 1 c oil and 3 eggs. 

Super moist and excellent lime flavor. I also made a coconut rum thin icing to go over it and coconut on the outside. 

Yummy!

I thought this recipe was just OK.  I did some changes to get it where I thought it would better.  I only did 3/4 cup of the oil and added 1 more egg. I made a batch of lime curd and when I took the cake out of the oven I poke holes in it and put a layer of lime curd and refrigerated it. I made the frosting and added more lime curd to the frost about 1/2 cup and some lime zest. This changed the cake flavor all together and tasted so much better

Try the GLAZE recipe from Key Lime cake II--that was good. Somehow, this was loved by my fiance. He said it tasted like "Fruit Loops." Unfortunately, that was a very accurate description.

Made this as cupcakes and they were fantastic!  I had been craving lime cupcakes, and these really hit the spot.  The only change I made was to use key lime juice in the batter instead of orange juice.  The cake doesn't rise very much though, so to get the cupcakes to look right I had to fill the cups up to almost the top.

i just tested these to see if i would include this recipe for my daughter's 7th birthday party at the end of may. the flavors are definitely the perfect mix of sweet and sour to create the ultimate key lime pie cupcake. (and they are super simple to make!!!) i followed the recipe by the book (even though i thought twice about all the oil) and they turned out awesome. i would watch at the end to keep them from getting too brown, but all in all, these cupcakes have made the cut! i am making 2 dozen keylime and 2 dozen strawberry cupcakes to create an awesome variety of flavors that compliment each other really nicely. thanks so much for the recipe! it is definitely a keeper!

I always make cakes from scratch and haven't bought a box of cake mix since I was like 13 years old. That said, I wanted something festively-colored for Easter and didn't have hardly any time to make desserts since all my time was spent preparing the meal. I tried this recipe and it was pretty decent. It was almost too tender / moist as the slices would almost fall apart if you weren't careful and I had a helluva time trying to get the cake to come out of the pans (and that's WITH greasing and flouring)....the bottom layer ended up totally falling apart and I had to make more icing to patch it back together, but luckily no one could tell by the time I was done. I'd only make this (or any cake mix based recipe) again under unusual circumstances, but aside from the issue with it being too delicate, it was decent.

Delicious.  As other reviews have stated it is better with less oil.  I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. I have made it both ways and it is much better with the oil and applesauce.

It seemed like there was way too much oil in it.  It didn't hold together well and when you touched it, you had oil on your finger.  I thought 1 1/3 cup was rather a large amount, and it was.

Made this cake for my sister's birthday yesterday.  She deemed it great with a very limey/citrusy flavor.  I thought it a very easy recipe.  I did, however, need to add a bit more confectioner's sugar (about 1/2 c.).  Assembled beautifully.  Will make again.

This cake was a hit. My younger son,11, loves key lime pie but wasn't sure if he would like this and he loved it. I took the advice of some and used key lime juice instead of orange juice. It came out great. I used buttercream frosting with no lime and it was delicious. I will definitely add this to the collection!

Very amazingly easy and great tasting cake for spring and summer. I have made this several times now for parties using 3/4 c oil and 5 eggs, and adding lime zest into the batter and also the frosting for more of a lime zing. Several people have asked me for this recipe and rave about it.

In answer to the question about the oil.  My Key Lime Recipe is almost exactly like this one with the exception of 5 eggs instead of 4 and only 3/4 cup of oil.  Hopes this helps.  By the way, I didnot use this recipe as written.

D E L I C I O U S!  It wouldn't have been any better unless it was also healthy.  Guess you can't have everything.  I used only 3 cups powdered sugar in the icing- plenty sweet!  Any more and the frosting would have been less cream cheese and lime and more powdered sugar taste.  I also added about 2 tsp lime zest to the frosting and another bit on top for garnish.

I didn't use orange juice, just water like the box sad. I did however, added a lot of lime zest. And it still came out tasting very lime.

I haven't made this cake yet just wondering if the serving size is incorrect.  30 servings seems like a lot for using only one box of cake mix yielding an 8" triple layer cake.

This cake is very moist! I substituted a third of the oil for buttermilk and added two tablespoons of sugar. However, the cake is perfectly fine without substitutions.

I beat cream cheese into the batter and only used half of the lime jello. The cream cheese calmed down the "fruit loop" flavor, and muted the bright green color. Used store bought cream cheese icing as well. It was very good.

Great Recipe, I followed the 1/2 cup of veg oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce.  It was moist and delicious.  Made my own frosting from the Wilton website.

I was really excited to try this cake because I love key lime pie.. but I did not care for this cake. It turns out a pretty green color, but it didn't taste anywhere near key lime pie, my husband loved it though. I won't make this again.

This cake was relatively easy to make and delicious.  It was a big hit at the office.  One tip: try as two 9 inch layers instead of three 8 inch layers.

Five star only with suggested modifications...  Less Oil, use lime juice in the cake in place of some of the OJ.  Frosting was good but runny.

This cake was OK....I think there is WAY too much oil used for this recipe....1 AND 1/3 cups?!?!?  Made for a very moist cake, but you can almost taste the vegetable oil.  I used whipped cream for the frosting.  A cream cheese/butter frosting would have made for a big grease ball in your mouth.

I prefer "made from scratch" cakes but this cake is scrumptious! Very moist. I recommend refrigerating because it firms the icing. Also, I recommend baking the cake in less time than preferred on the cake mix box.

I made this recipe into cupcakes today and they came out AMAZING. I'm taking them to my in-laws for Thanksgiving and I'm having a hard time keeping my husband and son out the kitchen. They are super moist. The only thing different that I did was add a tblsp of lime juice to give it some "twang".

I didn't try to make the cake, because I am not a fan of orange juice... So I found another recipe for that.  However, I made the frosting for this because it seemed so unique to me.  Boy am I glad I did!  The frosting is fantastic!

The only thing I did differently to this recipe was add the zest of the lime to the frosting.  I made this into cupcakes for my son to take to school for his birthday.  Two of the kids raved about these so much that their mothers called me for the recipe.  These will definately be made again.

I love this recipe, it is gone in one day. To the viewers who said that there icing was too runny; try putting the icing in the frig. after you put the cake in the oven by the time your cake has cooled and ready for icing it will be thick.

I believe this is the best cake I've ever made. I took it to our church's Thanksgiving meal and someone even used the server to scrape the crumbs off the plate. I made extra frosting to give it better coverage; next time I'll add a cup of sugar and a cup of self-rising flour to the batter to make the layers a little bigger. Other than that, it was perfect!

This cake is pretty and has plenty of lime flavor for anyone who is a real fan of limes and lime flavored desserts. A great change of pace....Update; I didn't have any orange juice, so I used a 6 oz. can of pineapple juice. Then I topped it with whipped cream frosting sprinkled with coconut. Yum!

I love this recipe!  I made it for the first time last year for my family's Easter gathering and they've requested it for every holiday gathering since then.  I don't hink it tastes anything like a boxed cake.  And, maybe it's not "sophisticated" but who said that good food has to be?

There was only enough frosting for half of the cake.  I did not like the flavor of the icing-too cream cheese tasting-for my taste. I added in another stick of butter and 2 more cups of confectionary sugar, along with another few tbs of key lime juice, and liked the flavor and texture much better.

I think adding some almond extract to the icing as well is awesome. I put almonds around the side and cocoanut flakes on the top, it was absolutely a smash hit! I used real unsalted butter and the icing melted in your mouth. It made the cake.

This recipe is wonderful!!  I baked it for an election party. We had 7 homemade cakes including Italian Cream, Red Velvet, Strawberry, 14 Layer with Chocolate Fudge icing, Coconut, Caramel and my Key Lime.  I heard several people saying that the Key Lime was their favorite. I'm baking another one tonight to take to work. :)

This will be my second time making the cake. I had a box of yellow cake mix but added lemon flavor. I also used extra 1/2 box of cake mix to ensure I get three layers of cake. It was moist even with the extra cake mix. My family's begging me to make another one.

Made as is and was very moist! Great flavor. Icing was a little runny, so I had to put it in the refrigerator to harden some. I used 9 key limes to make the 3 tbsp of juice.

OMGosh! I just made this cake and its soooo good!!! I had to make a few adjustments because I didn't have any orange juice. So instead of orange juice I used lime (key lime & regular because that's what I had)...Then in the icing because I used most of my lime juice in the cake batter I only added about 2 tablespoons to the mixture. Still, the icing is delish! I will definitely have enough juice for the full 3 tbsp next time, but this cake is so light and tasty! I don't find it overly sweet, as mentioned by many. That is most likey because I used lime juice instead of orange juice. I also added a tsp of vanilla in my icing - my mama taught me that! :)...Any ways I highly suggest trying this cake if you're interested!

GREAT cake recipe! The cake is super moist and flavorful. However, I have to say the frosting was very runny. I was extremely messy and did not fit well with this cake. The first time I made this cake I used the runny frosting. The second time I used a thicker frosting recipe. I also baked my cakes in 2 9 inch circle cake pans lined with parchment paper so that my cake wont brown too much.

I made this for  my 12 year old niece Birthday today, changed oil to 1 cup and substitued the 1/3 with key lime juice, cake was flat and solid not fluffy at all. 1/2 inch thick. Taste is ok but I would go by the box directions and substitute the water for orange juice and key lime juice and maybe it will turn out ok had to add more lime juice to the frosting as well.

This is one of the best cakes I have ever made or eaten!!  Thank you Judy for the recipe!  I didn't have Key Lime juice nor did my grocer carry it (???) so I just used regular lime juice and it was awesome!  I made it for the 1st time this past weekend for a family get-together.  It was gone which meant I had nothing to take home to eat as a snack :( but everyone raved about it.  I replaced all of the oil with applesauce and it was excellent - moist, rich - just like cake should be.  Thankfully, I have all of the ingredients in my cupboard and plan to make another one for my family (and me) tonight!

Although the cake turned out the right color, when we put the second layer on top of the first layer, it crumbled into a heap. The cake was very moist but this caused it to deconstruct. We loved the icing flavor but the cake tasted a bit like fruity pebbles; still delicious but not what you usually want a cake to taste like. Would suggest adding a bit of meringue powder to the frosting to help it set more.

I have become popular at all the holiday parties from this recipe. I make them into cupcakes instead of a cake. And to give it a festive finish, I sprinkle a little green sugar fine sprinkles on top. The cake batter is very moist and rich and the icing is delicious! NOTE: If you make cupcakes, I would suggest you make half of the entire recipe, giving you enough to make about 24 cupcakes. Other wise you will end up making about 48 or more cupcakes with the full recipe. Enjoy!

This is an awesome Key Lime Cake recipe!!! No one in my family makes this cake and I found this recipe to try. I absolutely love it and so does my family. Once I make it, it never stays around the house longer than 2-3 days. Sometimes just a day if its a special occasion! Its very moist and very good. I give it 2 thumbs up!!!

This is a delicious cake. I made a few modifications to suit our tastes and preferences, to keep the moist light flavor and omit a good deal of unnecessary fat. I used a Betty Crocker lemon cake mix, 1 cup of water, 4 eggs and 1/2 cup of oil. The cake did not need 1 1/3 cups of oil, in my opinion, to be moist and tasty. I zested a lime and added it to the cake batter, then instead of a heavy icing, I used a simple lime glaze using the juice of one or so limes whisked with about 3 cups of sifted powdered sugar (lemon glaze recipes abound on this website). Baked in a 9x13" Pyrex dish, while the cake was still warm, I poked it with a fork repeatedly and poured the glaze over, allowing it to penetrate the cake. Simple, light, refreshing and delicious, it was not too heavy of a dessert for warm weather. It does retain a bright green color after baking, thanks to the lime jell-o. The finished product was delightful, with no errant crumbs left uneaten.

I made this cake for a dinner at work and everyone loved it.  So they asked me to make it again.  This time I cut the oil to about 2/3 and the rest water and didn't add the butter to the icing. It was still awsome.  Thanks for the recipe its a keeper.

Such a great cake - got very good reviews/feedback from it! I did add more lime to the actual cake mix, to make it even more tart.

This looked and tasted like Fruit Loops. I made it this past weekend for a friend's party. I rushed to prepare something else to take.  It was very moist, though.  But thats only b/c of ALL the oil.   I would not recommend this cake.

This was yummy. I'm giving it 4 stars because I could taste the orange in the cake. I would have preferred all lime flavor. I will make again and omit the orange juice and use lime juice. This was moist. What made it great was a fresh blueberry topping. I did use the cream cheese frosting on the sides and as a fence to keep the berries on the top of the cake. I cooked corn starch, sugar and water; boiled 1 min. and stirred in 2 c. blueberries.

Did I read this right, 1 1/3 cup of oil?  I used 1/3 cup of oil and it came out just fine.  I was afraid to go as I read it as I thought for sure I'd ruin the recipe!

I used this recipe for a family Christmas dessert (since it was green), and since then, I cannot come to a family gathering without one!  Everyone LOVES this cake!  To add a little extra kick to it, I add a little grated lime rind in the batter and sprinkle a little on the icing for decoration.

For a box cake, this was pretty standard.  The texture was standard box cake, that is, very soft.  The flavor was very sweet.  The cooking time was quite long because of all the liquid in the recipe.  The iceing was very wet.  I wish there had been a "from scratch" key lime cake recipe.  This was very unsophisticated.  I guess I just don't like box mixes.

This cake was easy, delicious, and moist. I’m giving it 5 stars even though I made some changes. My family and friends loved it and did not find it gritty or overly sweet as some reviewers stated. The icing/frosting was the best part.
From previous experience with box cake mix I knew one box would make two very small layers or one small bundt cake, therefore,  I used 1 box lemon cake mix and 1/2 a box of white cake mix. (previous reviews stated lemon was over powering and cake wasn’t lime enough, so that’s why I used white cake mix with lemon mix). I reduced oil to 1 cup and used about a 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed lime juice and 2 1/2 tablespoons of lime zest. I dissolved half package of lime jello in lime juice and the other half in OJ to prevent gritty texture. I used the 4 eggs, 3/4 cup OJ as the recipe stated. 
The frosting was a little runny even after putting it in the refrigerator.  I used 3tablespoons of fresh lime juice. So, I added about 4oz more of cream cheese and 1/4 more butter to help thicken it up. I also added lime zest for flavor. It seemed to bake fast, so I baked at 325 for about 25-30 minutes..

I followed this recipe exactly and I should have listened to my intuition, I think that is way to much oil and my layers fell completely flat. The taste was good but will have to retry using less oil and maybe another egg..

This was my first time making this cake (amateur baker) and this recipe is awesome with a few substitutions. I read some of the previous reviews and I used 5 eggs instead of 4. I substituted melted butter for the oil and I only used 1/2 cup. I also used instant lemon pudding for moisture with a few drops of green food coloring. I did substitute lime juice for the orange juice. It came out perfectly and was very fragrant. The icing was a perfect compliment to the cake (I only used 3 cups sugar). I received many compliments and the fact that the cake was gone fairly quick let me know it was good.

I made this for a potluck and it was a hit, but the frosting was runny (I added too much lime juice) and the cake wasn't very flavorful (or moist - perhaps I slightly over-baked it?). Anyway, I thought it might be better as a bundt cake ... AND I WAS RIGHT!!! Below is my revised recipe, served as a bundt. SO moist and creamy, and everyone RAVED about it. 



Key Lime Bundt Cake 

Ingredients
•	1 (15.25 ounce) Betty Crocker Super Moist Lemon Cake Mix
•	1 1/3 cups vegetable oil
•	4 eggs
•	1 (3 ounce) package lime flavored Jell-O mix
•	¾ cup limeade
•	1 fresh lime (cut in half)
•	½ cup butter (softened)
•	12 ounces cream cheese (softened and divided)
•	4 ½ tablespoons key lime juice
•	4 ½ cups powdered sugar
•	Finely crushed graham crackers (for garnish)

Directions
1.	Combine cake mix, gelatin mix, oil, eggs, limeade, 4 ounces cream cheese (softened), and the juice and zest from ½ a fresh lime. (Optional: Add four drops green food coloring and two drops yellow food coloring.) Pour into a greased Bundt pan. Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 45 minutes. Allow to cool. 

2.	To make glaze: In a large bowl, beat the butter and 8 ounces of cream cheese until light and fluffy. Add the key lime juice and powdered sugar. Mix well.

3.	Once cake has cooled, turn the Bundt pan over onto a cake tray. Then pour the glaze onto the cake. Garnish with crushed graham crackers and the zest of the remaining ½ lime.

4.	Refrigerate for at least one hour before serving.

I couldn't find a cake mix with those exact ounces.  I had to use one  about 2 ounces smaller than the recipe and I also did not use fresh lime juice. I used Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice.  The  cake itself was very moist and delicious and the icing was perfect!  So easy too! Will definitely bake this again!

I love this recipe. My family loves this recipe. I have tried it now at least 6 times and it has been a hit every time.  My mother has been asking for it for about a week and today I am preparing it for her. I lost my copy of this recipe, and thank goodness I was able to find it here!  I made a copy this time. I am extremely grateful for your site.

Love making this cake.  It's sooo easy. I used a tsp each of fresh lemon and lime juice in the batter.  Made it a little more tangy.  Always a hit at gatherings. Friends ask "why didn't you make two?"

This cake is loved by all! I always receive requests for this cake at every family gathering. It is moist with a delicious lime flavor. Most importantly, it is easy to make but tastes like you have spent all day baking in the kitchen. The color makes it great for Easter. It is also very festive during Christmas when layered with a red velvet cake.

I tried the recipe it was too oily tasting for me. So i decided to do 5 eggs instead of 4 and 3/4c of oil instead of 1 3/4 c. It was much better.. For the frosting i did the cream cheese icing and 3 cups of confections sugar..

I played around with the measurements for the liquids since the oil amount seemed high for what is typically called for in a cake mix. I used 1/2 c. oil, 3/4 water and 1/2 cup lime juice (instead of OJ). Cake had a wonderful tart bite and people loved it! I did not make the frosting.

I made the cupcake version for a potluck at work on St. Patrick's day. Not only did everyone at the office compliment the cupcakes, but the extras that I have in a tupperware container are still moist and yummy a week later!
I will be making this again for sure!

As the author said - this cake is very moist.  
I noticed the negative reviews complaining that the author did not tell them to grease the pan, but she did say bake according to the instructions on the box mix, which tells you to grease and flour the pan.
It seemed that the cake needed to be cooked a lot longer than it would if made as instructed on the box, so you'll have to keep checking on it until a toothpick comes out clean.  I thought the lime juice made the icing too runny and I would recommend using a little more powdered sugar to thicken.  Otherwise, easy recipe and served the purpose I needed it for.
I was out of OJ, so I zested and juiced a lime and then added water to make the 6 oz called for in the recipe - made a great substitute.

Mine turned out great. While I could only make it 2 layer, it still turned out nice. It could use a little more explaining, due to the extra contents in it. But over all, I love the flavor and taste. I look forward to making it again, so I can hopefully adjust some things to make it better.

AMAZING cake, a great twist on a classic. Of course there area  couple ways to healthy it up, and the frosting might be a bit on the sweet side. But it still has the tangy kick and is an incredible texture.

My cousin asked me to find her a recipe for a Key Lime cake and I ran upon this one.  As usual, we tweaked the recipe (Grand Marnier with the orange juice to equal the 3/4 cup and we added 1TB of Grand Marnier to 2TB of lime juice in the icing to help cut the tartness).  Excellent, excellent...easy, easy.

Well i ran out of orange juice, so i used lemonade instead, which turned out great! The only problem that i see with this recipe, is that it didn't rise as much as i thought it would. So if you're making cupcakes, make sure to fill the cups nearly all the way full. If you only fill them about two thirds full, they wont rise much higher than the top of the paper baking cups. Oh, and this recipe makes A LOT of cupcakes, count on about 2 1/2 dozen or so. great for parties :]

The flavor of this cake is great, but I don't think the liquid measurements are correct.  1 1/3 c. oil and 4 eggs makes the batter very thin.  My cakes fell apart as I tried to frost them and I had to make it as a trifle.  Also, the frosting should be doubled if you hope to cover the whole cake.   Like, I said, the flavor is great, but I would definitely lower the amount of oil and/or eggs.

I made this cake for Mothers' Day 2010. My mom loves citrus flavors and I was initially seeking a lemon recipe but ran into this.  I substituted lemon pudding for the orange juice. The cake was SUPER moist; peopole had NO idea that it was NOT made from scratch. I made the cream cheese icing and added key lime zest to it as well as to the cake batter.  It was awesome and so good that I only got ONE piece of the cake myself.  I did make it in layers but for the Memorial Day party this weekend I am going to do it in a sheet cake form. The key to it is using true Key West lime juice and lime like I did.

Very moist and delicious! I've made this a couple of times now and substituted applesauce in place of some of the oil. I didn't use the frosting listed, instead I used a homemade cream cheese frosting just b/c of personal preference. But this cake is great to eat by itself without any frosting. Happy Baking!

This cake was okay. I made some modifications. I used white cake instead of lemon because I hate the flavor of lemon cake. I replaced half the orange juice with key lime juice. I made a glaze of key lime juice, sugar, and butter that poured onto the warm bundt out of the oven. It set into the cake and made it very moist.

Eh, it was ok.  Nothing spectacular.  Still tasted like a box cake.  I guess with all the add in ingredients, I thought it wouldn't.  Oh well...we'll still eat it.  Still searching for a GREAT Key Lime Cake :(

This cake recipe turned out great. I made it for my DH's bday. He loved it as did our other guests. It is very moist. I made it in a 9x13 pan and it cooked more quickly than the box stated that it would.

This cake is so delicious!  A perfect cake alternative to key lime pie (though may taste a little more like lemon than lime, yummy just the same)  Super moist but it did fall quite a bit.  This recipe works the same with strawberry cake mix and strawberry jello (pretty for christmas with the two cakes stacked together!) As I saw from the other reviewers, the frosting wasn't thick enough so I only put in half the butter, let it set up a bit in the fridge and it was perfect.

Sweet, sweet, sweet...but very moist cake. Frosting wasn't thick enough to make a nice layer. Great concept though. Thanks!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe considering the accolades that it has received from so many individuals.  I think it is an okay recipe, if you are looking for more of a lime cake.  The frosting though,  is wonderful.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and an additional cup of powdered sugar to give the frosting some body.

My 10 year old daughter won reserve grand champion with this cake at our County Youth Fair. It was so simple to make and so good.  We melted almond bark & added a little green food coloring, then put in a squeeze bottle and drizzled over cake for color, then put 4 thin sliced lime twists in the middle for decoration!

I could not get this frosting to thicken at all and the cake was too moist.  I'm not sure if it was my error or just the recipe.  I have to say though, the flavor of each were good it just didn't work out for me.

I made this cake exactly as directed and, since box cake sizes are now smaller, I bought two boxes and measured by weight to 18.25 ounces.  I am an experienced baker and all three cakes fell.  I doubled the frosting to have enough to decorate the cake.  The taste is good, however, the next time I will follow others’ advice and add an egg while reducing the oil.  I did zest some lime into the frosting to add more lime flavor.

Overall, the cake was good. The only change I made, accidentally, was used 2 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 4. That was all I had and didn’t want to go back to the store. The icing turned out sweet enough with just that. I also added pecans on top which gave it a nice crunch. The lemon cake mix kinda battles with the lime but I would like to try adding more lime juice and less oj as a baker posted and  suggested previously. I enjoyed it for it being the first time.  I would definitely make this again.

Pretty cake, but the flavor wasn't very lime-y.  The icing was excellent.  I think if I try this again, I'll add a good bit of lime zest and replace the orange juice with Key lime juice.

WAIT! I know what you're thinking, that's a LOT of oil. No, it's not. This recipe came out perfectly! The ONLY thing I added was the zest from 2 limes, only because I'm making a pineapple filling & didn't want the lime over powered. The cake was delicious, moist, and had a nice crumb.  I baked at 325 for apx 40 minutes for 3 six inch pans.I will be making this again!!! I highly recommend giving this recipe a try!

I could never put that much oil in a cake so I subbed some applesauce.  My son likes it really tart so I added citric acid.  It was delicious.  Although he decided that he prefers adding pudding instead of jello.

This is my new favorite cake!!  Loved it!!  I did make a few changes.  Instead of the oil, I used only 1 cup of coconut oil melted.  I added 3 tablespoons of flour.  The icing called for 3 tbsp of lime juice, I used 2 tbsp. of fresh lime juice and a little lime zest.  It was perfect!!  Definitely making again.

This cake was delicious.  It reminded me of the "jello" cake I've made in the past.  The only change I made was with the frosting.  Rather than 4 cups of confectioners sugar, I only used 2 cups.  The frosting was very creamy and the lime flavor came through.  It will be a "make again" cake during the Summer months!

Have make it many many times and everyone just loves it. Moist and tangy. Only thing different is I had to add alot more lime juice then called for and it can make the icing thinner, going to try less juice next time with lime zest!!

My family loves this cake. My Dad requests it for his birthday and church functions on a regular basis. However, I did make a small tweek to the recipe. I use 1/2 cup orange juice with 1/4 cup lime juice to make it more tart.

For the frosting, Increase the 10X sugar to 5 cups and decreased the lime juice to 2 Tbsp.  Add 1/2 tsp. Vanilla.

This is my husband's absolute favorite cake.  He asked for a key lime pie for is birthday but I did this instead (because cake=birthday, not pie). The flavor is amazing and it's so moist!  I used a splash of lime juice in the frosting and topped of the decorating with lime shaves.  It was a crowd pleaser!

I used the reccomended oil, and it came out a little too dense. I would certainly use less oil next time, in hopes of creating a lighter consistancy. I also used lemon pudding rather than lime jello. Perhaps that added to the density, but I would take extra density to the gritty texture that others were reporting.

I had a hard time getting the middle to cook. I had to cut off the top and let the gooey middle cook through. It wasn't pretty, but the frosting covered it up. Perhaps it was the cooking vessle (a glass cassarole dish), or perhaps it was because it was on the wrong setting by accident. Who knows.

I added some extra lime juice and some orange juice. My boyfriend (the one who requested this cake for his birthday) loved the extra tart flavor. Of course, this is coming from a man who can literally eat lemon wedges without sugar. I found the cake a bit too tart for my liking. So if you're hypersentive to bitterness or you have normal taste buds, be careful not to go over board with the juice!

The frosting turned out perfect!

I made the cake and it was great but I did have a few alterations. I added lime zest and fresh lime juice to the orange juice for flavor. I reduced the lime Jell-O to one half of a pack and added one cup of pre-mixed vanilla pudding.  For the icing I added an eighth of a pack of lime Jell-O along with lime zest and lime juice. The cake was awesome it was eaten in no time flat and I had 5 orders for additional cakes.

I have made this three times and each time I have gotten great comments.  The first time I made it three layers,  pain in the butt.  The second time I made two cakes for two occasions on the same day, bundt cakes.  I think the icing is way too much for one cake so I divided it between the two and it was perfect!  The first time I used real limes for the icing but second time didn't want to mess with it so just used ReaLime and had the same taste.  This is definitely a keeper and I don't even like Key Lime Pie!

Good flavor...So-So Texture
I don't like "wet" cake... And this reminded me of wet, poke cakes.  The flavor was good, so I'm gonna try it without so much oil next time.

I think this is a pretty good recipe although I love love love ALL THE WAY HOMEMADE CAKES!!! 
I used my own buttercream icing recipe and flavored it with lime juice and a secret flavoring also.
Moist! I also darkened the color to make it a bit more green but still the key lime color.
I would make it again!

I made absolutely zero changes to this recipe, because it is perfect as is!  Made this cake, took it to a family gathering, never got a single slice of it!!! One suggestion for those of you who noted the icing was a little runny or did not stand up well...beat the butter and cream cheese until it is VERY fluffy, add the powdered sugar first, then stream in the key lime juice until you get a spreadable frosting.  P.S.  There is a key lime pound cake recipe on this site that is to die for, too!

Made this for mother's day last year and again this year for the super bowl party.  It was a big hit at both events!  One of the guys at the super bowl party made the comment as I was carrying out the empty cake plate "don't lose that recipe"!  Yes it is pretty sweet and rich, but isn't that what cake is supposed to be?  I love the combination of flavors - sweet/sour.  Will be making again.  

Just make sure your cake pans are 8" and not 9" because I did make that mistake the first time I made it, and one of the layers was a little burned on one side.... so I had to make another one.  That was my fault though, and not the recipe.

This shall be the only key lime cake recipe I use forever! This cake was everything a cake should be: moist, flavorful and delicious. My only changes would be to the icing because I love more of a cream cheese flavor than anything so I blended 2 bars cream cheese with sugar  and added water until it was my consistency.  If you are looking for a great key lime recipe look no further.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe for the cake to a tee and found it to be a little on the heavy and gooey side. The second time I used 1/2 a cup of apple sauce and 1 stick of butter instead of oil. I also separated the eggs and beat the whites(adding two more whites) with a little cream of tartar then folded that into the rest of the ingredients. The cake came out much lighter yet still moist, which I do prefer. It really does depend on your preference. This recipe as written is still quite tasty. I also used the recipe for whipped cream cheese frosting on this site, using lime juice instead of vanilla extract. Nice and light, just how I like it.

I absolutely love this recipe! Usually a big family hit! Ive only had one person say it wasn't for them...yet..that was my crazy picky sister who doesn't like pecans and prefers stove top dressing over homemade dressing! Lol! I usually love making it for large families in a bundt.

I decreased oil to 1cup and swapped the jello for lemon pudding mix and added a few drops of green food coloring. Also halved the sugar/butter/cream cheese in the icing recipe and whipped it together with store bought cream cheese icing (kept like juice the same). Everybody was begging me to make more!

You already have the fresh lime, so add a little zest to the frosting.  It provides just a little more "pop" of the flavor.
I have made this several times and it is always a big hit.

This recipe is ok but, it would be better if you use real key limes which are smaller with a more concetrated flavor.

Oh my these are the devil in green. Just iced them and before I knew it the entire cupcake was gone.  I wanted a little more lime taste to my  icing I added about another a 1/2 of tablespoon of lime juice, this made it perfect for me.

I made this as a sheet cake and it was great. I found this recipe in a magazine and All Recipes came to my rescue when I wanted to make it again and couldn't find where I put it! For the frosting, the recipe called for 3T powdered sugar added to softened cream chesse and folded into 12 oz cool whip. Made for a great cool dessert in the middle of summer. I added chopped pecans and garnished with zested lime.

This may have been just a personal error , but i could not get the cakes out if the pan without them falling apart and only the too half coming out. I greased with cooking spray and flowered the pans like the box cake mix said. I felt that 1 and 1/3 cups if oil was an obscured ammount, but went with it since I trusted this recipe. Not sure if this is much help, but it would reccomed maybe less oil

I have done this recipe on numerous occasions and find it to come out better and better each time.  Although one time I made a mistake by doubling on the recipe (poor measurement) so I can make two cakes which was a horrible mistake because it came out too greasy.  Next time, I stuck to doing the recipe one at a time.  I love doing this cake and everyone I do it for enjoys it too!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars for the cake! I usually do my own recipe for icing because I am so picky and don't like so much sugar. But this cake is requested every year by my father in law, sister and husband for their birthdays they love it so much! It is so tasty! I do think it could be improved. I usually just make it in a 9x13 and every time, it sinks down in the middle...haven't played around with the recipe enough to figure out the fix.

This cake was fantastic! I substituted lemon (cook & serve) in place of the Lime Jello, in place of all OJ & did half OJ & half Key Lime juice & only 1/2 cup Lemon olive oil. It was very moist & so flavorful.  The Frosting was excellent, not overly sweet but just really full of flavor. Dont be afraid to add a little extra key lime juice. Excellent choice, everyone one loved it.

Amazing! This cake is so delicious and super moist. It is pretty dense so one cake will go a long way. The only thing I think I will change next time is to add more lime juice and maybe less orange juice to give it a stronger flavor.

A lady I work with brought this cake in and it was SO good! I go to a local bakery just to get the key lime cup cakes and now I can just make this instead of paying a arm and a leg for one cupcake.

I'm a guy who had always wanted to take up making cakes as a hobby. I had heard of key lime pie but never cake. A lady at my workplace makes folks cakes for their birthday and once someone requested key-lime cake. I loved it and mentioned to my wife I'd like to try and make one so she found me this simple recipe. I made my first one at Christmas this year and then another one last weekend. My family goes through them quickly and I'm about to make yet another one. They are a huge hit and I'm getting better with my icing skills with each successive try. There does seem to be a lot of oil in this cake compared to the stock box cake mix directions but I haven't been brave enough to make alterations to the recipe yet. I just know this recipe is making me look good and I'm just a beginner!

I'm basing my review on the cake alone...  While it is very moist and tastes good, it doesn't taste like key lime. I made 24 cupcakes instead of a regular cake. I used 5 eggs and 3/4 cup of vegetable oil like one user suggested. I followed the baking directions on the lemon cake mix box, which stated 350 degrees for 18-24 minutes. My cupcakes were done in about 14 minutes, if I had left them in any longer they would've been too done... So make sure you keep an eye on them. Overall, a nice lemon/lime cake flavor just not exactly what I had hoped for.

This cake was overall really good.  I followed the directions exactly.  The only criticism I have is that the cake itself was just a bit too sweet (And I love sweets!) so perhaps using sugar-free jello would help?  I'll try again and see...

This recipe is great!  Though, I would only use 1 tablespoon of lime juice for the icing.  I used 3 tblspns, the first time around and my icing was very runny.  Otherwise, this cake is quite delicious!

This is absolutely the most delicious, moist, best cake I have ever had the pleasure to taste. A real winner!  
Once again, I would like to rave over this recipe. I had another one that called for 5 eggs and 1-1/2 cup of oil. I tried that recipe also.  It was good, but not as good as Key Lime Cake III.  Loved this one the most.

i made this cake yesterday for my best friend's birthday-key lime pie being her favorite. after reading other reviews, i made the following changes: used 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesause (stayed with 4 eggs), only used  1/2 of the lime jell-o mix to cut down a bit on the sweetness, added the zest of 2 limes to the batter and used lemonade instead of orange juice. for the icing, i used the recommended amount of butter and cream cheese, added the zest of a lime and added about 2 tablespoons of the the lime jell-o mix. i had PLENTY of frosting (i only made 2 layers) and even had some left over. it baked in about 25 minutes and t came out wonderfully moist and delicious! definitely a hit-thank you!

This cake is absolutely delicious! I made it in 2 layers because sometimes the 3 layer cakes, to me, lose a lot of the cake taste to mostly the icing. That being said, the icing was super rich so I would recommend only using the amount the recipe calls for. Don't double! I made this for a 4th of July cookout and it was the hit! People who normally don't have seconds had seconds. Its been requested again so I thought I'd do it justice and leave a review. TRY THIS CAKE :)

Just needs more lime flavor & I'd review higher.  Boxed cake is boxed cake though so don't hold your expectations too high.  The frosting was TERRIFIC as you can lime it up to your liking w/ the juice.

I took this cake to a family reunion and it was gone in a hurry.  My daughters laughed at the color of it, but loved the taste!  I have since made it with lemon jello in the cake, and lemon juice in the icing.  It makes a great tasting lemon cake as well. I've made it in round layers as well as in a 10" x 14" rectangular pan.  Works great either way.  It is a refreshing summer cake recipe!

This is the best cake. Really moist and delicious. Best served at room temp, but needs to be refrigerated. Very easy to make. Have made this recipe 2 times already will be making it again tonight for someone's birthday.

My niece asked me to make a key lime cake for her husband's birthday.  I checked Allrecipes, read all the reviews and picked this one.  They call it the Shrek cake.  It didn't last a full day.  They loved it! I did put some toasted, chopped pecans in the icing.  So good - already planning to have another one Easter.  Thanks for this terrific recipe!

I made this cake, turned out well, however, I desired more moisture to the cake.   At the time I did not have 8" inch cake pans, used 9".  Could that have been the reason for less moisture in the cake?

A great, easy-to-make cake! Note: we'd consider doubling the recipe for taller/more layers. It's a pretty short cake.

I made this cake for the first time for Christmas. It was a huge hit for my extended family potluck dinner.  It was moist and just the right sweet and tart.  The only recommendation (provided to me from my nephew who happens to be a chef) is to use 2 tablespoons of lime juice for the icing to make it a little more stiff for spreading.  My icing was a tad bit runny with the 3 tbsps.  I'm making it again really soon.

I had this at a friends Margarita Spa Party and it was great. I made it when I had my family over and now it is a request that I make it whenever we have family get-togethers. It is a must try. It is very sweet and I usually don't use too much of the icing.

WOW!  Soooo good.  Key lime cake is my favorite.  The recipe was so easy and I loved it.  So did my guest at the shower I made it for.  I made cupcakes.  So wonderful everyone asked for the recipe.

Very good. I had a key lime cake for my wedding cake that someone made that was better, but this is the next best thing. Thank you! :-)

YUM! Made cupcakes and moist they are... My husband calls these "Shrek Snot Cupcakes" because of the color. I didn't have any OJ so I just squeezed extra lime juice which made it extra yummy and not too tart. I frosted it with "Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site subbing lemon with lime juice, added extra lime zest to the frosting. MMMmm! Going back to the kitchen for my third....
