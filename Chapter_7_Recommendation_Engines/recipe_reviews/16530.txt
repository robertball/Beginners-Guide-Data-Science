I've read lots of the reviews under this recipe and have taken to heart a few things that really helped..first..this recipe for 4 servings needs an 8.5 x 11 pan to fit all the roll-ups into..and second...definitely needed more spice...so, what I have done to cut corners a bit is added 3/4 pkg of taco seasoning (I bet chili seasoning would work great too) and still added the garlic. I also added a small amount of corn, but next time will double it (I suggest about 1 cup). I also added lots more enchilada sauce--actually the whole jar! My husband's comment was, "You can definitely make this one again!" My daughter's comment was "Just a little too spicy"...but then again, she did eat it right up! :)  To go with this recipe, I made the 'Salad de Colores' found on this website--and the two go marvelously together!

I made some changes to the recipe and it turned out excellent.  I added 1 can of whole kernal corn, 1 can of creole style black beans, and about 5 spoonfuls of diced Jalepenos.  I had to use an 8x11.5 inch backing dish and also added a little bit more cheese and enchilada sauce.  Very, very good.  Would rate 5 stars with the changes.

I read the reviews so I added black beans and corn. I'm glad I did, because these were so good! I used small whole wheat tortillas and a big can of enchilada sauce. Yummy! I will make these again.

This is a good basic recipe that I have never even heard of before. It is a little carb-heavy, so I would definitely recommend adding other things to the potatoes. I added fresh spinach sauteed with garlic, and a can of black beans. I also, like another reviewer, made the "red enchilada sauce" from this website. It was all really good, but it makes a LOT of food! I took the extra leftovers to work the next day, and people were asking for the recipe! I think it would be especially good to use with leftover mashed potatoes, otherwise it is a little bit time consuming.

I made this recipe for Cinco de Mayo and LOVED it.  I made minor modifications that I gathered from the reviews.  I added both black beans and corn and also added taco seasoning.  I used a blend of fat free and reduced fat cheeses but I used way more than just one cup.  I bought hot enchilada sauce by mistake but it turned out to be a happy accident.  Great recipe.

This is a great recipe. I added one can of black beans, one can of mexi-corn and seasoned with half pack of taco seasoning mix. I still added the called for spices and it was not too much spice. I also added a little more cheese and definitely extra enchilada sauce.

These turned out very tasty.  My husband was skeptical but he loved them.  I thought they were just a touch too dry but it was nothing that cannot be adjusted.

This was good, but it was a little dry.  Next time I'll definitely add some more sauce as well as green chiles or jalapenos for some spice.  Onions would be good and I like others' suggestions for corn and black beans.

This looked ok, but I tex-mexed it up a bit, by using chunks of boiled potatoes,  sauteed with some jalapenos and cumin for a bit.  Using corn tortillas adds more flavor, too (and makes it more healthy).

Unlike many, I was not skeptical of these - I'll do about anything with a potato, and I don't need (or care to have) meat at every meal - it's easy enough to add protein like beans on the side.  I made this almost as is, except I didn't quite make mashed potatoes, but just sorta squished them a bit.  And I used burrito size flour tortillas and this seemed about enough to fill four.  Pretty good overall, but I agree that the potatoes can be a bit bland.  I think something that would help is simply putting some of the enchilada sauce in with the potato mixture so that you're getting it with every bit.  I think black beans is an interesting idea too, though haven't tried it.

I think maybe a little more cheese would be good next time, and definitely agree on the extra enchilada sauce. I think you could add shredded chicken to this too and it would be great. Really a hardy tasty meal. Will definitely make again! THanks!

Very flavorful, but check the mixture before you stuff your enchiladas, I had to double almost all the seasonings. Also, I used half sweet potatoes/yams and half regular white potatoes to give it an extra health kick, and added a can of black beans for the same reason. Very good with the 10 minute sauce from this site.

AHHH, Ash Wednesday...time to pull out all of those vegian recipes.  These were a nice, unique way for me to use up some left over taters (which were baked mashed potatoes, from this site).  I scaled the recipe to 1 serving, & baked it in my toaster oven.  I topped it with sour cream, and chopped green onion.  Thanks Jen!

These were terribly bland.  I choked down one serving but wouldn't touch the leftovers.

This turned out to be a pretty spicy recipe  and was a meal all by itself. I added corn, green pepper, and onion as one of the other commentors mentioned and that added a little more variety to the dish.

This recipe is a weeknight lifesaver!!!  I use a good quality boxed mashed potatoes to make the prep time less than 10 minutes.  My family really enjoys this meal.  I have started doubling this recipe just so that we can have a few leftovers.  Don't add meat and please don't use corn tortillas.  It's great just the way it is.

I prepared this recipe as instructed, but really didn't care for it. I guess I expected to taste the cheese more. I also didn't really like the texture. It was edible, but I won't make this one again.

This was a really hard recipe to rate for me. Something about the texture I did not care for. Although my hubby asked when I was going to make these again. I think I next time I will take another reviewers advice and half mash the potatoes. I did add the can of corn and taco mix but not the black beans, although that does sound good. Instead I made Puerto Rican rice which aleady has gandules, pigeon peas, in it. Also I think I might add some beef too. Used the red enchilada sauce recipe from this site.

My 2 year old LOVED these. I thought they were good... I agree that they're a little pasty and would recommend serving with more sauce.

LOVED, loved, LOVED these!  Did it a little backwards, since we realized last minute we had thrown away the baking dish we needed.  Turned into a layered, yummy meal in a quiche dish.  Really easy and delicious.  Making it again right now :)

I was feeling particularly lazy when I made these, and used instant mashed potatoes instead. Worked perfectly fine. I used a lactose-free cheddar/jack mix instead, and added just a bit more chili powder. The taco sauce that I bought to go over top was so-so, but that's not reflective of this recipe, just a poor choice on my part. Using regular salsa would be a better alternative. I will definitely make this again, as it is very very easy, and very tasty.

This was delicious, I changed a few things, and added a few things, I added some chopped onion, tabasco sauce, cheddar cheese and cliantro to the filling and also added some sour cream. I think next time I will also add a can of mexi-corn. Thanks, it was delicious.

Great recipe idea, but a few things needed adjusting... I added a lot more cheese just to improve the potato texture within the tortillas, and I also used much more enchilada sauce than is called for, despite the fact that I halved the recipe. Also, don't even think about using an 8x8 pan, it's way too small! All in all with a few changes a delicious recipe, my husband is a very picky eater and always skeptical when I try to cook anything unusual, and these won even him over.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe.  I did sautee half of a small onion and added it to the potato mixture.  I also added some chunky salsa to the enchilada sauce before pouring it on.  I will make this again....I am thinking maybe with some chorizo for a breakfast dish...we'll see! :)

Decent meal. It's not "bad" but its not "wow" either. I added a TBLS butter while mashing the potatoes and due to some bland complaints, added some chopped green onions, extra cheese and S&P to taste to the mix. Served over a bed of shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream on top.  Taste is okay and the idea is really good but it needs more spices to liven it up.  I might make again to play around with it but I'll otherwise pass as the recipe currently stands.

These were very good. I came and read the reviews before I made this and I am very glad I did. I added a can of black beans, increased spices by a lot and used medium spicy enchilada sauce.  The only tortillas I had were low carb garlic and herb, so I used those. This was great..nicely spicy. These would also be good with shredded chicken in them,

For the wife and I not being vegetarians [although we used to be] this was an excellent dish! I did take some pointers from others. For example I did put some chicken broth in with the water to give the potatoes a bit more flavor along with about 5 dashes of tabasco sauce...I incorporated about a 1/4 of an onion [thats all we had on hand] and a chili pepper into the potato mix...Also I used 5 potatoes instead of 4...I used a full cup of cheese in the potato mixture and just sprinkled some cheese on top of the burritos as I felt necessary...I used the entire can of enchilada sauce [10 oz] and used 6 [10 inch] tortillas instead of the 8 [6 inch] tortillas...was able to cook that in a 9x9 glass pan...

I diced my potatoes but did not mash (they were pretty mashed after stirring anyway).  Added a regular can of mexi-corn and a regular can of black beans in addition to a whole diced onion.  Upped cheese to 1 c. in filling and 1/4 c. on top.  Added a bit of sour cream to potatoes - started with 2 T and kept adding until the mixture didn't seem so dry.  Added a packet of taco seasoning to potatoes (start with 3/4 and go from there).  Didn't use much enchilada sauce but topped mainly with green salsa verde taco sauce.  Yum!  Filling!  One was enough for me with some Spanish Rice!  I filled 8 tortillas but still have enough filling for at least 4 more - we'll be eating this for lunches, too.  Great for the budget and the stomach!

Great base recipe!  I added some hamburger for the hubby (if there's no meat it's not a complete meal).  So I only used 2 potatoes and about 1 pound of meat.  I also  mixed in a can of rotell tomatoes to the meat and potato mixture.  Overall, this couldn't be beat!  It will be made again soon!

Yum. Yum. Yum.  I microwaved the potatoes in the morning and then just peeled 'em once they cooled.  Easier to work with and no pot to clean!  I rolled up the kids portions and then added some chopped fresh serrano peppers to the grown-up portions.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

If chicken were added it would have been better. Using the flour tortillas made the texture mushy. Maybe use corn tortillas? I had to use a lot more enchilada sause than was called for.

We used fat-free Cheddar so they came out a little spicy, but still delicious. Amazingly simple, but really great. Good job!

The whole time I was preparing this recipe, all I could think of was how horrible it was going to be and why in the world I chose this for dinner.  However, it turned out pretty good.  While I do find it a little bland, it is very filling.  I served it on a bed of shredded lettuce and topped it with sour cream.  Also a side of corn.  It was a good, cheap meal for tonight, but I probably wouldn't make it again unless in a pinch (most ingredients are always on hand).

Great recipe!  If you're looking to save time, my beau discovered that they taste just as good made with instant mashed potatoes.  To add texture, he has put corn and diced onion on top of the potato mixture before rolling the tortillas up.  Fantastic!

An "okay" dish, fine for a ordinary night, wouldn't serve it to guests. Just a little bland. I rolled some of the potato mixture into corn tortillas and fried them for potato tacos, and that was pretty good. Will try some of the suggestions in the review.

My husband and I cannot get enough of these! We just add black beans and corn and follow the rest of the recipe as written. I'm veg, so I use Daiya cheese in/on my enchiladas, then they're a delicious vegan meal. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really enjoyed these and so did my husband (much to my surprise.)  I added a dried red chile because I like spice. Also followed the other reviewers suggestions of adding chicken broth to the potatoes and used the entire 10 ounce can of enchilada sauce.

My hubs was very skeptical of this recipe but the whole family really enoyed it. I used a taco packet that was opened already and the minced garlic for the seasoning. I added some black beans that were opened as well as a dollop of sourcream to the mixture. My potatoes were on the small side so I used 5 and I was able to get 4 good sized burritos out of this. This was wonderful and I didn't have a problem with lack of taste or dryness. I used the entire can of enchilada sauce. I'll def make again when we have excess potatoes around for a quick and easy meal. Thanks :)

I have to say I was a bit skeptical about these, but I am so glad I gave them a try.  They were delicious and my whole family kept raving about them.  I did make a few changes per the other reviews.  I added much more spices so the potatoes were not bland.  I didn't mash the potatoes, but instead kept them whole and mixed them with black beans and corns.  They ended up getting somewhat mashed, but gave the burritos texture.  I did add a little more cheese inside the burritos to keep them moist.  I definitely suggest using a homemade enchilada sauce, because it makes all the difference.  This is a definite keeper.

The husband wants breakfast daily, so I'm always looking for new ideas.  I've prepared these several ways for breakfast. Favorites are the mashed potatoes with chopped ham and lots of shredded pepper cheese, with eggs and refried beans on the side; we also like the potatoes cut into small chunks (instead of mashed) with black beans, corn, chopped jalapeno, canadian bacon or browned chorizo, with cooked scrambled eggs folded into the mixture.  Serve with pieces of orange and grapefruit on the side and you've got a wonderful breakfast!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I have dabbled back and forth in the vegetarian recipes.  And living with a man who cannot live without meat, he absolutely loved this and his co-workers ask where I got the recipe from.  Thank you so much!  Oh yeah, the 5 year old loves it too!

Well, I added the corn, added an extra tsp chili powder and 1 tsp taco seasoning and these were still a little pasty and blaw.  It was a bit like sticking a spoonful of peanut butter in your mouth - only without the peanut flavor.  Two of our kids really liked them (the ones that like blaw food and Mac and Cheese is their favorite), but the other three of us could take them or leave them.

A little bland for my taste.  I boosted the cumin and chili powder and it was not as spicy as I'd like, so taste the potatoes before you roll them in the tortillas.  I added cooked chicken breast and corn to make it a main dish.

We will definitely make this recipe again!  i added jalopenos to the potato recipe but i think i would also up the spices for a bit more zing.  My boyfriend suggested black beans for next time, and i think i will add come frozen corn as well.  oh and i used salsa instead of enchiladas sauce.  it was great!  with a few "tweeks", this could be a fabulous vegetarian dish for ALL to enjoy!

I thought that these were really very good.  Since so many people said they were bland, I added some diced green chiles and doubled the amount of spices.  They were a nice change from ordinary enchiladas.

Added 1 can each corn and black beans, drained and rinsed, and 1 sm can diced green chiles.  Added butter to the mashed potatoes.  Needs extra seasoning and cheese.  Used 1/2 of a mild chili seasoning pkt and added some cayenne for some heat.  Used the whole can of enchilada sauce and sprinkled w green onions.  Baked covered for 10 mins and uncovered another 12.  Served w a dollop of sour cream. Tasty but heavy.  A salad would be nice on the side.

I added a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, black beans, and olives. I also added a dollop of sour cream on too of each. I found that the filling was kinda dry. I think next time I'll add some enchilada sauce into the mixture as well.

I think this is a decent starter recipe, but when I made it, I felt it really needed some help. So I added some onions, bell peppers and green chili's it is just the help this recipe needed. I also add refried beans and cheese to the burrito before I roll it up and bake it. Next time I am going to add some tomatoes.

I did mine in the slow cooker. I used 2 potatoes, 1 packet of taco seasoning mix, and 2 cups of cheese. Also used 2 cans of echelada sauce. Put the rollups in the crock pot as you make them, then add 1 cup of cheese on top and finally the echalada sauce. Cook them for a few hours until they are heated thru. Yum!

Would be much better with cubed roasted potatoes. Add black beans and corn to potato mixture.

Very good! Next time I will saute onions and add them to the potato mix. I used the homemade enchilada sauce from the website. Very heavy dish - you could very easily make half a recipe.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  I had a little bit of chicken, but not enough for burritos.  I also had potatoes to use, so I tried to find something that could work as a filler with the chicken.  This did the job perfectly and it tasted wonderful!  The spices added a nice flavor to the potatoes.  I added few things I like such as fresh cilantro.  Just be sure that the potatoes are cooked all the way.  Mine were firm and I thought they would soften as they baked.  Not so.  Some of them ended up tasting uncooked.  This is a great way to add a filler or to use up potatoes, or just have a nice vegetarian burrito!

I was skeptical at first, when I first made these I put to much potatoes in them and not enough cheese. The second time I put about half potatoes and half cheese making them even better.

I followed others' suggestions for this. I used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe on the site, and added some minced onion and more spice into the potato mixture. I also found the potato's were very dry when I mashed them up (could have been the type of potato I used) so I added some chicken broth before mixing with cheese and spices. They were great!

YUM! We were looking for a filling vegetarian meal and these burritos were great! I added a can of fat free refried beans and an onion.  Used a whole can of enchilada sauce on top. Will definitely make this again!!

We liked these. I had to add a lot more cheese and more seasoning (extra chili powder and some fajita seasoning I had on hand)so it wasn't so bland. Next time I will use the whole can of enchilada sauce instead of the amount specified in the recipe.

I give this four stars because it has the potential of being really great.  I love the idea of this.  It's similar to a side dish they serve at Don Pablo's.  This exact recipe was a bit too spicy for my family.  I'm sure the right sauce would really make this recipe better.  I will keep searching.

Made this one over the weekend. It was good but there are a few things I would change/add. First of all I used and HIGHLY recommend using the red enchillada sauce from this site. It is out fo this world. Secondly, when mashing the potatos I used a little bit of butter to moisten it up a bit, the butter did wonders. I also added some sauteed onions to the mix. And last, I didn't think to do this until it was too late but next time I will definatley use some sour cream. Overall though, it was fantastic.

Yummy! This recipe was a great starting point. With a few small adjustments, this turned out to be an excellent meal!! I followed the suggestions of others to add corn and onion. I also traded the chili powder/cumin for 3/4 packet of chili seasoning and topped with the whole jar of enchilada sauce. My husband and I both loved it!! I will definitely make this one again.

I thought this recipe was good, though a little dry.  Though I'm vegetarian, meat inside might help cut the dryness.  And to those who complained you would never see this on a Mexican restaurant menu, not true!  As a vegetarian I see this option often.

These were very good.  I added too much chili powder to the enchilada sauce, but it was still delicious!  These are very filling and "heavy" though.  Although these will probably not be in my regular rotation, I will be making them again!

This was good! I made the red enchilada sauce form this site instead of using canned. If I made it again I think I would leave the potatoes half mashed & add some corn or a can of black beans.

Really needs additions to the recipie to give it texture.  Corn, beans, beef maybe.  Almost seems like you have to come up with a whole new recipe.

Very tasty!  I followed other's advice and added extra cumin, chili powder and garlic.  I also threw in some onion for extra flavor.  I made half with chicken and half without because my husband thought that they would need some meat, but he agreed afterwards that they tasted just as good without meat.

I really enjoyed these burritos.  I made four burritos using the larger sized tortillas because that was what I had in the house.  I ended up using a whole 10-ounce can of enchilada sauce and a whole bag of shredded cheese!  Ack!  I will definitely make these again although I'll try to control myself with the cheese and I may try adding some beans as another reviewer suggested.  These are a GREAT comfort food!

We are not vegetarians, but this was a great dish!  My husband requested that I add some shreaded chicked to the potato mixture and it was a nice addition.  I will probably make this again.  Thanks!

We are not vegetarians, but we liked this recipe.  I added a can of whole black beans to the potatoes for some protein.  I also think it would be good with shredded beef added.  Like a meat and potatoes burrito.

This recipe was great.  My husband and I like our food on the spicier side, so I used hot enchilada sauce and kicked up the potato filling with onions extra chilis and about 3x the recommended chilil powder.  It was a keeper, however I found it took a little longer to prepare than noted once I peeled and boiled the potatoes.

I had a potato enchilada and potato burrito at a local Mexican restaurant. I kept looking for a recipe that would taste like that. This is so close! It was great! I added chopped onion (about half a large) to the cooking potatoes and mashed it up with it. Great recipe. Very good. Even for the nonvegetarians :)

It was a great recipe that my wife and I are sure to make again.  I added some small beef chunks and it was great.  We made half one night and let the potato mix to sit overnight.  We found that it tasted better, allowing the garlic to soak into the mashed potatoes.

I'd say these could use a little more flavor.  I added a can of black beans and half a bunch of spinach for some protein and added nutrition.

This is a really delicious dish.  It is good with either the red or green chile enchilada sauce.  I used 1-1/2 tsp of freshly ground dried Pasilla chiles.  It gave the recipe a bit of zip but not too hot, though I admit all of us at the silverwolf's den are lovers of spicy food.

I made this tonight. I saw the reviews that some felt it was bland so I cooked the potatoes in some leftover vegetable broth and water. I did add about a cup of frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe’s. I could have added more. I did use more cheese and a cup of enchilada sauce. I was very impressed how these turned out. This is on my list to do again.

this recipe has a lot of potential, but overall we found it too bland and with not enough variation of texture. we took others advice and added black beans and corn which were definitely a positive add. if I try it again, I think I will fry cubed potatoes instead of mashing them, maybe add cream cheese and some enchilada sauce to the filling, use more cheese, and possibly add onions and bell peppers to the inside as well. otherwise, this is just mashed potatoes wrapped in a tortilla with some enchilada sauce thrown in top.

Just not very good.  Very starchy and one-note.  It probably needs more veggies mixed in with it like onions, peppers, spinach. Would not make again as is.

I was pleasantly surprised with how this came out.  I will modify it next time to have more filling for the burritos as I wasn't able to find a 6" tortilla.  Added black olives to use some up & it still came out well.

This was so good! Very tasty, and I usually don't like spicy things! The only thing is that it's really messy, and takes a while to make. And I think I'm gonna use more cheese in the mixture next time too. I love this recipe though! :)

These are mashed potato enchiladas and Y-U-M!!! Mash the potatoes (or even better, use leftover mashed potatoes if you have some on hand) Add corn, black beans & canned chiles to the mashed, and use 3/4 packet taco seasoning instead of all the spices and definitely add lots more enchilada sauce than called for. Follow user review tips. Family requests often.

Delicious!  I made a couple of changes.  I added a small container of sour cream to the potatoes, because they seemed dry.  I used the entire can of enchilada sauce, and it could still probably have used more.

These burritos seemed dry inside and very dense and heavy. While the taste was okay, it seemed almost dry to me. If I make this again, I would rather do the potatoes differently. I think next time I would cut them into small pieces and bake them (covered) with the spices to cook them. Then I would put together the potatoes and cheese in the tortillas, but keep them on the smaller/lighter side. It also lends itself to adding other things, like beans, onions, olives, etc.

I found this dish to be very heavy. If I wanted to eat mashed potatoes, I would rather do it without a tortilla wrapped around them. However, as plain mashed potatoes, they were delicious. I just don't think this makes for a very good burrito. It just made me feel gross after I ate it for dinner. My husband, however, loved them. Too bad for him, because I won't be making this again.

My family and I really liked this.  I did not mash the potatoes but after stirring in all the ingredients, they were pretty mashed up anyway.  I added some cooked shredded chicken, but not much.  I will add more chicken next time. I also used the whole can of enchilada sauce (a little in the filling and the rest on top).

This recipe is a solid 4-stars! I used boxed mashed potatoes to save time. I'm a vegetarian and my husband isn't. I'm always looking for options that are "meals" for me and "sides" for him. This qualifies. He got chicken enchiladas with spicy, cheesy potatoes on the side!

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe.  The dish lacks flavor as its sole source of flavor is the spices.  It is basically mashed potatoes wrapped in bread.  The dish is inexpensive and filling, however, so it's not all bad.  After weighing the pros and cons, I won't be making it again.

this recipe is a fine launching point for your own tastes and creativity.  i like a lot of cumin, cheese, and assorted peppers.  but both my hubby and enjoyed the potato base.  this is a quick, cheap, and easy dish-just waiting for your own flair.

The idea was good, but the potato didnt match well.  I didn't like this recipe very much.

This was very tasty.  I did alter it a bit, by adding cream cheese, sour cream and parsley to the mashed potatoes.  In the future, I will play around with different cheeses, etc.  All in all this was great!

I added green onion and threw in some leftover veggies, peas and corn. Next time, I'll use a green enchilada sauce, though. My kids don't like the chili pepper flavor in the red sauces. Good recipe overall and very creative!

Definitely bland, at least I thought so.  My vegetarian friend liked them well enough, though.  We both agree maybe an addition of black beans would be beneficial.  Will keep checking for other addition ideas.

These were really good, but it took a while to get used to the texture.  Having mashed potatoes inside a tortilla is a bit strange!  We added some chipotle peppers and that spiced it up a lot. Pretty quick meal!

I read the comments first before I made this dish, so I sauted some onions & added them to the mix, as well as increased the amount of spices.  They turned out great!  I will definitely be making this recipe again since it was really easy.

This is a very good vegetarian dish.  I made it once for myself and offered to let my boyfriend taste one.  I didn't think he would like it because he is not a vegetarian, but he loved it and he ate a couple of them with a hamburger.  :)

Very yummy!  It definatley needed more spices as some of the other reviewer mentioned. I added about 2-3 times the amount of listed spices reccomened and it turned out great.  I used chili flavored tortillas as well which enhanced the overall flavor.  Thank you for this unique and yummy recipe.

Really bland.  I had to really dress them up.  My children did NOT like them.  Even my very easy to please teenager (who loves everything) couldn't finish hers and ate cereal instead.  Oh well, you can't win 'em all.

Not bad at all.  I think it would be a lot tastier with more sauce.  I spread the sauce on my tortillas before adding the filling.  Next time I plan on adding some chopped peppers to the sauce along with some sour cream.

I definately suggest adding beans and/or some other vegetable for more flavor.  Great recipe to add your own flair to.  Rather bland by itself.

Hmmm, this recipe had quite a good rating, so I'm very surprised that I really
didn't like it.  In all fairness, though, I did not have chili powder, so maybe that
made a really big difference?  Anyway, this dish was really quite a disappointement.

add lots more enchilada sauce than the recipe calls for and add 1 small can green diced chiles, mix in cilantro into the potatoes and this will taste even better!

I loved the recipe.  I have made potato burritos in the past and next time I would try to brown the mashed potatoes a little first because I love crispy potatoes.  Still, it is a very good recipe.

I think instant mashed potatoes could be used, cutting prep time considerably.  
My husband wanted some meat in his, so I added browned sausage which was 
very good.  I modified it for the kids in yet another way, using no peppers and 
american cheese.  They ate every bite!

I was very pleased with how these turned out. I think older kids may like them, but my 4 year old definitely did not. Suggestion: For the garlic-boil and mash 2 cloves of garlic with the potatoes-very tasty!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The kids thought the enchilada sauce was to hot, however, they liked the inside.  So next time I will try it with homemade enchilada sauce, that way I can make it really mild.  I will try it again because I really enjoyed it.

Yummy AND vegetarian!  I used a smokey chili powder and it gave it a real good ol western Tex/Mex flavor.  Don't have kids to rate it, but my boyfriend LOVES it!
