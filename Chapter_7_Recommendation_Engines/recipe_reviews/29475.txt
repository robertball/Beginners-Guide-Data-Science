I'm just calling this recipe feta shrimp.  I used chopped fresh tomatoes without peeling them & I think it tasted fine.  I guess you could use diced canned tomatoes instead as well.  I reduced the temperature to 400 degrees as I used cooked shrimp instead of the uncooked shrimp.  If you do this, you may want to experiment with the temperature & cooking time as you want to make sure not to cook the dish too long.  You want to heat up the shrimp but not have them rubbery.  I also left out the oregano as my husband isn't a big fan.  Next time, I think I'll try a flavored feta (garlic/herb or tomato/basil) for a little more of a flavor punch.

This was actually not so time consuming at all!  In fact, it was done quicker than we were ready to eat! I made some angel hair pasta to go with it and it was *very* tasty and delicious.  I may even make this for company!!  It's a keeper!

This was soooo delicious! I used fresh, unpeeled tomatoes also and they were just fine. I also used only one pound of shrimp and it was a good thing because there was just enough "sauce" to cover them. When I made the "sauce", it was more like a chunky salsa ... but absolutely delicious. I will be making this again ... soon!

Well...it wasnt much to "rave" over and seem to have that something missing from it.  Thank you for the recipe post; it was a dinner fix but I will keep my eye out for another.  My shrimp was already cooked so the oven temp was set at 400 and I left the dish in long enough to heat through.

I'd have to give this 3 1/2 stars...hubby liked it but my kids didn't like the wine sauce. I used garden fresh tomatoes, a mix of wine and chicken broth. I only had cooked shrimp, so I just put in the last three minutes of cooking on the stove and did not cook in the oven. Put the feta cheese on before serving.

I loved this recipe.  I made it using reduced fat feta and chicken broth instead of wine.  I also used half the shrimp since I was cooking for just two people.  I served it with a salad made from feta, a seeded cucumber, halved grape tomatoes, red onions, lemon juice and fresh pepper.

Simple recipe that was okay. It was much better the 2nd day once the flavors blended in together. Served with lemon pasta recipe found on this site. Perhaps some black kalamata olives would enhance this recipe.

Excellent Recipe.  You must follow the directions, you can't use dried herbs, you have to include all what seems to be an incredible amount of onions (scallions).  If using fresh tomatoes you have to cook them down otherwise too soupy as others have mentioned.  The sauce needs to be thick, really sticking to the spoon.  Remembering you are putting in raw shrimp that will exude juice.  I found worked for quick fix is Hunts diced tomatoes in sauce.  Great recipe if made right!

Wonderful meal. Didn't have onions so we omitted those and added some onion powder. Served with tri color rotini pasta. It was a meal that I would be happy with should I order it in a restaurant

I peeled the tomatoes (I let them sit in a bowl of boiling water for a few mins, then removed the skins), and I omitted the parsley as we don't like it. I added the thawed raw shrimp to the tomato/onion mix, let the shrimp cook through, then spread everything into a glass baking dish, topped it with crumbled feta, then broiled for a few minutes so the feta was melty. It turned out really good! Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic!  When making the sauce I wasn't so sure.  It didn't seem to be enough to cover the shrimp...and it wasn't.  However, it covered it enough to flavor the shrimp and that is all it needs.

I stuck to the recipe except for the shrimp.  I used 3 pounds of steamed, de-veined, peeled shrimp.  After cutting the tails off I had 2 to 2 1/2 pounds of shrimp.  It turned out wonderful.

This recipe was marginal at best.  We love Greek food and feta is a favorite.  It sounded wonderful, but both my husband and I thought it fair.

Amazing! I added a little extra wine to give the sauce more liquid, but I don't think I needed to do that. I also doubled the garlic, used reduced fat feta, and used dried oregano. This was wonderful!

Going to give 3 stars based on what was left in the dish.    I don't eat shrimp, but our guests did.   The sauce was perfect and full of flavor, but was told did not pair well with the shrimp.

I made a few substitutions based on what I had available...fire-roasted can tomatoes, sub fresh rosemary for the parsley and oregano, added Greeek Seasoning. Once the sauce was reduced to my liking I added the shrimp and cooked until pink, sprinkled feta overtop and broiled until the cheese was creamy. Yummy. Served with Rigatoni with Lemon Pasta Sauce (AR). We really enjoyed this.

Great Greek dish. Since people said the dish lacked something, I added some fresh rosemary and basil. I also added a 6 oz. can of tomato sauce because I didn't think the tomatoes were enough. (I also halved the recipe since its just me and the hubs.)

The flavor wasn't bad, but this wasn't for us. Fortunately, I didn't put the full two pounds of shrimp in, because then it would have been an expensive tragedy. However, because I only put in 1 lb. of shrimp, it was more like an oily soup. If someone wants to try this recipe, I have a couple of recommendations. 1) Halve the recipe--unless you are feeding a decent sized family (5+) you don't need all of it, and it doesn't reheat very well. 2) Don't use frozen shrimp, make sure that your shrimp is thawed because otherwise it oozes more liquid into the "sauce", and then you have soup. 3) I would definitely make sure your tomatoes are seeded and that all of the "goo" you can get out of them is gone--probably even wipe them with a towel, just to be sure, and AVOID CANNED TOMATOES!! Because, again, you don't want a funky soup. Thanks anyway MaryannG!

I made this for a dinner party and it was great.  Very light/mediterranean feel to it.  Great garlicly liquid to soak up with crusty bread.  I used more tomatoes than called for and served it over angel hair pasta.  Definitely will make again.

I guess I should have read the reviews before making this recipe! Not enough sauce and too much shrimp.  I used a 40/50 count shrimp, which were pretty large, and there were to many to cook properly.  I will make the dish again using pre-cooked shrimp, double the amount of sauce, and use half the amount of shrimp, and more feta since I like the added saltiness.  Perhaps you can't do this using convection heat??? Without stirring the dish it was impossible to see if all the shrimp were pink.  In fact, I had guests over and one of them, fortunately she's a good friend, pointed out that some shrimp weren't pink as she was serving herself. I had to bake this at 500 degrees for at least twice the amount of time indicated, not good when you have guests waiting!

OMG, this was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to use only 1 pound of shrimp. Two pounds seemed a bit too much if I wanted to have a sauce for my pasta. Served over angel hair pasta with garlic bread. Definitely will be making this again.

This was tasty, but nothing to rave over I guess? It seemed to me like it was missing something, but I don't know what that something is. The only change I made was to leave the tomatoes unpeeled, because I am supremely lazy and it didn't seem necessary.

I made this as written but only used 1 pound of shrimp.  It was fabulous.  Served it over angel hair pasta.

Pretty good - but lacking a bit of flavor. Added a few greek olives to try and zip it up a bit, but still a little bland. I make something similar to this with chicken or a mild white fish like cod, and I think I prefer that to the shrimp. They got a little lost in all the tomato.

I used one can drained tomatoes instead of fresh because I am a beginner and not proficient with a knife. The meal was wonderful and I would definitely make it again.

This was delicious and very easy to make! I used cherry tomatoes (about 1 1/2 pints and cut in half) and fresh mint leaves instead of parsley to bring out the sweetness of the tomatoes. I used frozen shrimp but next time I'll definitely use fresh. The sauce would be awesome on chicken as well! I'm definitely going to make this again; thank you for sharing.

Nice and easy. We love shrimp and we love greek food so this fit the bill. I like the other reviewer will add more feta next time. Was delicious over garlicky buttered orzo. Will keep this one.

Eh, nothing to rave about.  The dish was watery, lacking any real flavor and didn't impress anyone.  It was edible, but I won't make it again.

I have made this recipe several times and every time we all love it!  I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce, but other than that I haven't changed a thing.  I have substituted dried oregano and parsley in the past, but I wouldn't recommend it as the best flavors come out if you use fresh herbs for this dish.

We thought this recipe was lacking in flavor; there seemed to be way too many shrimp in proportion to the sauce. Loved the addition of the feta - we'll use extra feta next time for a little more kick and will double the sauce ingredients.

Absolutely positively delicious. All I've added to this is chiffonade of spinach leaves. As usual, I tweak it to make it lower in sodium and replaced the wine with no sodium chicken broth. This dish is absolutely heavenly.

I made this with the Spanakorizo on this site for a Greek themed dinner and it was amazing! I shortened the cokking time for the sauce and I accidently bought frozen pre-cooked shrimp and it still came out excellent! It has plenty of flavor that my family and even my boyfriend (who hates shrimp) and his brother loved! I will make it again.

This is a wonderfully hearty meal.  I added a little more feta cheese for the fun of it.  It gives it a great flavor.  I served this over lightly buttered/garlic orzo pasta.  Great recipe!

This stuff was really good! It's pretty healthy too, even though I probably ate about 4 servings. :) Next time I'll spend the extra money to buy the pre-shelled and deveined shrimp though, because preparing 2 pounds of shrimp takes forever.

The sauce was delicious and overall this was a very good addition to our Christmas Eve dinner.  I got a lot of compliments.  Followed the recipe instructions; the only comment is that I may have overcooked the shrimp -- I cooked them for around 13 minutes which was when the cheese began to brown, but I should have stopped at 10.  Thanks for sharing.

We were very disappointed in this recipe.  The ingredients for the sauce sounded good, but when combined and cooked for the designated amount of time, it was watery and tasteless.  The shrimp were hard when cooked in the oven as the directions say.  I will not make this recipe again.
