If you are looking for a rich, cheesey, bacon burger, this is the one for you.  My husband loved it!  I made the pimento cheese the day before with Best Foods mayo to allow the flavors to really meld.  We grilled our burgers, topped them with the cheese mixture,  bacon and sandwiched the whole thing in a artisan roll.  YUM!  Perfect for a summertime BBQ.

Great burger, no doubt about it - how can you go wrong with bacon on a hamburger?  On its own this red pepper-cheese mixture is wonderful!  I tried some on a crostini and heated it till warm and melted. So I was surprised when it didn't have the same flavor punch on the burger.  For some reason it just kind of got lost.  Still, the hamburger was quite good, and even Hubs said he'd like to give this another go around.  (We had these on pretzel buns which, if you haven't tried them, are just delicious)

Wow what an amazingly flavorful burger!  I made it because it looked so tasty and I'm glad I did.  Grilled mushrooms are good on this burger, but it's also great made just as the recipe suggests.  5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!

This was delicious!  I second guessed myself the entire time I was making this recipe, but it turned out amazing.  The pimento cheese had a little zing to it and it melted so creamy on top of the burgers.  The bacon added just the needed flavor to top the whole thing off.  We toasted our buns and did not add any other condiments (they weren't needed).  I also didn't add any seasoning to the meat, other than a little salt and pepper.  I don't think it needed it, either.  Make this and you will not be disappointed!

This was an awesome recipe! It combines all our favorites! We made the pimento cheese the night before and doubled the recipe for sandwiches the next day! This will become a regular!

This was SUPER rich, but very good! Made it just as written, aside from scaling the recipe back to 2 servings. I served these on pretzel buns. I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The pimento cheese adds a perfect zest to the burger.  I double the pimento cheese recipe and have plenty left over to make sandwiches for the week.  We make this very often.

Obviously it's not good for you.  I don't think anyone in their right mind would think a bacon cheeseburger is health food.  But it certainly is delicious.  Top it with sauteed mushrooms and jalapeno slices.

I made these exactly according to recipe, only using reduced fat counterparts and 100% whole wheat buns. EVERYONE loved them, even the littlest. Huge hit.

I made the cheese spread in the morning and we made the burgers in the evening. I followed the recipe as written and it was very flavorful and tasted amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

This burger was delicious.  I made everything according to the recipe.  The white/yellow cheddar combo is great!  The topping would be delicious on chicken breasts or in a grilled cheese sandwich as well, maybe with some tomato, spinach, and bacon.

Had company over last night, and they all loved this.  I used a small jar of pimentos and chopped them up a bit smaller, and I used a pre shredded cheddar and monteray jack cheese mix.  I wasn't sure exactly how much to put in so I just kept adding more until it was a could pasty consistancy that wouldn't fall off the burger onto my grill.  I also put the same salt, pepper, and cayenne seasoning into the ground beef.  Everything was wonderful.
