This was really good.  I forgot to use the mustard, but the crunch of the walnuts was wonderful. I also did not have fresh dill, so I used 1-1 1/2 Tb. dried. My 4 kids LOVED it and all had seconds.

My wife and I really enjoyed this, but I made a few modifications: I didn't have lemons, so no lemon juice or lemon rinds. I used lemon pepper seasoning, black & cayenne pepper, onion & garlic powder in the walnut crust mix (maybe 1 tsp each). I also seasoned the salmon filets with salt, pepper, store-bought italian seasoning and diced yellow onions and let it all marinate for about 20 mins. After baking for 20 minutes, I set the oven to broil for 2-3 minutes (watch carefully- crumbs will blacken). I will definitely use this recipe again to impress some house guests.

I didn't care for this. I was not a fan of the flavor.

It was so good! I used pecans instead of walnuts and made enough for only two servings so it didn't take much. I say if you have the Dijon use it! The flavor it added was wonderful, I even enjoyed the lemon even though I'm not much of a lemon and fish person.

So good! I did not bother to refrigerate this beforehand and I really don't think there is a need. I added a little lemon juice to the crumb mixture as well. This seemed so fancy for just an easy weeknight meal, I will definitely make this again, the taste was amazing!

I used two full salmon filet, skinned  and portioned before baking.  I thought the dill sounded strange with the walnuts so I omitted it. Six tablespoons of zest is a bit much.  I used 1 Tbsp zest (3 lemons) and  2 tsp lemon pepper. Added 2 Tbsp of dark brown sugar.  Grill the lemons for sweetness and squeeze over top at the end.  This recipe made twice as much topping  as I needed, but that is OK.  I will freeze it for another time.  Cold leftovers great over kale salad.

Delicious and easy to make.
I topped it with a simple cranberry glaze made from canned cranberry, onion and brown sugar and it really complimented the meal.
Made it for a Valentine date and it was the hit of the night.

The crunchy topping was really nice. I was only making a small amount so I had to adjust for that, but I love the flavour combo of the mustard, dill and lemon. I didn't do the rind, but everything else according to the recipe and I'll make it again.

This was great but since I don't like mustard I substituted with honey. I really loved the lemon zest, don't skimp.
The second time I thought to try almonds because walnuts can be bitter. I will make this a regular dish in my home. My wife who normally doesn't like salmon enjoyed it too.

I actually made this sans the salmon as a kind of low carb biscuit. It was FANTASTIC. Didn't even use the lemon.

Easy and delicious. Nice for a special dinner with a leafy salad and a savory, creamy pan-saut√©ed garlic-onion potato dish. Make sure the oven is preheated. In last 5 minutes, switch on broiler and closely watch the topping to prevent burning while it gets a toasty finish to the delicious crumb-nut topping.
