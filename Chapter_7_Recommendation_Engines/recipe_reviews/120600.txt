I have made this slaw twice now and it was a hit both times.  I did add a small jar of real bacon bits and also sprinkled some sliced honey roasted almonds atop right before serving-gave it a little extra crunch and a nice flavor.  I did discover the second time I made it that if you shred the cabbage and give it a little time to dry ( I shredded mine the day before and kept in a ziploc bag) then the dressing doesnt end up pink after you mix it all together. This one is a keeper.

Okay, so this was MORE than a hit.  My husband, who bemoans the lack of good slaw "up North" (GA boy in CT) absolutely LOVED this.  He was thrilled with the broccoli (which mama never used!) and commented repeatedly, which is rare.  I used Marie's cole slaw dressing, which comes in a 12 oz. bottle, so I had to scale back the recipe.  Wonderful.  But one warning ... I love raisins, so I sort of bumped those up a little.  Warning:  DON'T DO IT!  As great as this is, extra raisins sweeten the slaw a bit more than you will want it, so STICK WITH THE RECIPE.

I substituted golden raisins but really prefer to use dried cranberries (craisins), added small can of crushed pineapple, one can of real bacon bits, used red onion instead of white for more color, and would just as soon leave out the carrots with the other additions.  Instead of the bottled cole slaw dressing I prefer using the kind where you add 1 T. each of sugar and vinegar to l cup mayo.  It's a hit, everybody loves it and I take it often to potlucks or family reuions.  We like it just as well when using the pre-packaged brocoli slaw mix, which is also a good  timesaver.  With these substitutions and additions I would rate it five stars.

Wow! This is the best slaw I've ever had.  I didn't have four cups of broccoli but it was fine with only two. I also added 1/2 cup each of slivered almonds and raisins. I made my own dressing with 1/2 cup of mayo and 1 T each of vinegar and sugar. It wasn't too wet or overwhelming, and the flavors combine together really well. Even better the next day! Thanks for the 5-star recipe

I like this recipe. I did make some changes second time I prepared. I added one tablespoon of sugar to the dressing, and also added crumbled bacon for extra flavor. Thanks!

I fixed this for my mother's 50th birthday party and everyone loved it!  I prepared as the recipe states, however I added red onion and sliced almonds for an extra crunch.  Multiple requests for the recipe.  A welcome new recipe for family get togethers!

I really liked this recipe! I made it for company and it was a hit! I used the food processor "shredding" attachment to shred the cabbage, onion and carrot. It turned out perfect. I will make this again. Yummy!

I have made this on several occasions and by adding some fried bacon bits, sunflower seeds and a simple home made vinaigrette it is great. The bacon when combined with the raisins really explodes in flavour.

Made this with a bag of broccoli slaw mix, was looking to something with it besides add to salads.  Made my own dressing (light canola mayo, apple cider vinegar, & pepper), used dried cranberries instead of raisins because that's what i had on hand, and added some chopped apples.  SO good, my 7 year old loved it too!

Thumbs up! A rare vegetable recipe all my picky kids liked. I left out the raisins (only because I forgot them), and added bacon bits. I used homemade dressing.
