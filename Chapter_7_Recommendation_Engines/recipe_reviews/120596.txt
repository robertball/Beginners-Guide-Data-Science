I give this recipe 5 stars because this is exactly what I was looking for-a cute, bite-sized quiche. It was a little bland for me, even after adding hot sauce, but as other reviewers suggested, you can add whatever you like. Since it is a tad labor-intensive, I tweeked the technique.  Portion out the dough right into a 24-count mini-muffin tin so you can adjust to make them all equal.  After rolling into balls and cooling, smash each ball with a shot glass dipped in flour.  This  forms each ball into a perfect tart. Much easier than using your fingers.

These are great for any party and freeze extremely well!  I added some browned, crumbled spicy sausage which really boosted the flavor.  Delicious!!

These are delish!  I took the advice of several ahead of me...added hot italian turkey sausage (meat from 4 links)...sauteed that the day before w/ some green pepper in place of the chiles.  Also..added about 1/4 c parmasean and some coarse ground black pepper to the dough - made the balls the day ahead and refrig overnight. Made 12 in full size muffin pans (instead of 24 minis) sprayed w/ PAM...used the shot glass idea dipped in flour to shape dough into muffin pans - was a great idea!  Added 10 mins to bake time since using larger size.  Added 2 eggs to filling (so 4 eggs total.  They were really good.  Will definately do again...trying variety of fillings.

While this is a great recipe it is not really made in a mini muffin tin; With these recipe guidelines it fits better into a regular muffin tin.

I couldn't help but notice that the prep time calls for 20 minutes. This would be correct if you already had dough balls in the frig waiting to be used. There is prep and then 1 hour of chilling the dough, plus the cooking. I'm glad I doubled checked the instructions and didn't base my timeline on the 50 minute estimate. I hope they turn out great. * Update: I made this two weeks ago and the first comment I had from a guest was that at first bite she knew they weren't the frozen, store bought kind. They are very time consuming to make but they were gobbled up in no time. I decided to divide the batch in half making one vegetarian and one with spicy ground sausage. I tried the suggestion of using a shot glass to spread out the dough. This seemed useless. I really think the dough should be made in little rounds by hand. BTW, I made them 3 days before my party, froze them in a zip lock bag, and cooked them at the recommended temp for about 20 minutes. Perfect.

I made these today for my daughter's wedding shower, since it was 
cinco de Mayo.  I didn't make any changes, and everyone said "you made these?" Served with Amy's cilantro cream sauce, a great combo

Absolutely sensational! My party friends loved it! I added sausage...it gave it a nice extra flavor that my husband loved.
I will keep this recipe for life! The only down fall is that it's a little time consuming...but well worth it!

These turned out well.  Next time I would combine the cheese, peppers, eggs, cream, S&P then spoon into the shells.  I'd also use a stronger cheese, sharp or pepperjack.

Great for guests but for my taste, it really needs the spicy sausage that so many recommended.  Using the shot glass to spread the dough was a great suggestion.

This was a combination of 2 of the recipes that I had been wanting to try...so I gave it a shot.  I really liked the flaky texture of the crust, although it was a tad greasy.  I used a floured flat bottomed cup to press the dough out into thin circles instead of pressing up the sides.  I also omitted the chiles, due to the fact that I was cooking for a toddler.  These were super cute and pretty tasty, easily dressed up with some vegetables or whatever you like in quiche!

i made these for a party and they looked and tasted great.  i agree that they need a little extra flavoring (maybe cayenne pepper?), but this is a great recipe overall.

I thought these were great - made them for a Mom's Night Out gathering. Just a slight bit of heat from the green chiles but nothing crazy. Super easy to make - thank you!

It wasn't as dense as I had hoped for, next time I may try 3 eggs and 1/4 cup of whipping cream. I added a bit of spicy sausage as others suggested and was glad for it! That aside, they looked perfect, tasted great, and people were so surprised they were homemade! =D

I took these to our monthly game night and they were excellent.  My only complaint is that the recipe says it will be ready in 50 minutes.  So I allowed an hour.  This caused a little bit of a problem when I later saw it needs to refrigerate for an hour.

The recipe as written was just ok.  They are somewhat boring.  I made them once as written and a second time with the same base recipe but I added chorizo and green onions.  This was better but still not great.  We added some homemade salsa  and sour cream to the top after they came out of the oven which helped tremendously.  If you keep the crust thin, it definitely makes a difference.  Because they're so small, you need more filling and less crust.  I suggest using the larger muffin tins or even use four ramekins.

I used this as a base recipe adding bacon and cheese in the filling.  So good.  These freeze and reheat wonderfully.  I made them ahead of time for a brunch.

Great recipe!  Made a lot of different ways to see which I liked best.  The change I made to the dough was just to add 1/4 c parm b/c I had that on hand.  Dough came out perfect in both batches that I made.  These are the ways I made them (all with the mont jack): 1. hot turkey sausage sauteed with red bell peppers and scallions 2. Green chilis and red pepper flakes 3. Mild Salsa 4. Red bell pepper (not sauteed this time), scallions, and green chilis 5. Black beans and mild salsa 6. Black beans, red bell, scallions, and green chilis 7. Green chilis (recipe as stated)  So, I really honestly liked all combos but my husband and I both thought the turkey sausage took away from the other flavors so that the meat was all we could taste.  I think the recipe as it stands is pretty tasty.  The red pepper flakes added to it just give it a zip if you like things a little hotter.  The salsa was very easy to add and might be nice if you made half with green chilis and half with salsa if you wanted a Christmas themed appetizer.  The black beans were ok but didn't add a ton of taste.  My favorite was probably number 4, which is the red bell pepper, scallions, and green chilis.  Thought this was a great combo of prettiness and taste.  Does take a little more time to chop the veggies.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome and very easy to cook. Great for parties. I've made some adjustments- instead of cheese and jalapeno I filled it with mushrooms and onions sauteed together and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella cheese. It was VERY delicious!

Love this recipe, the crust is great and really easy to work with. I fill it with whatever I'm feeling at the moment, today is bacon & cheese and some with broccoli and mushroom. Hubby loves quiche, and the very picky kids even love this one. A little bit of Cyan in the eggs gives it a nice bite.

These were good, but fairly bland.  I did brown some bulk breakfast sausage (about 4 oz) per other reviews, but it didn't add much excitement.  I only used regular sausage, since I'm not into spicy foods and it already called for the green chiles, but it was still bland.  I think I would make this again and maybe add a little salsa to it, to make it more moist and give it a kick.  They did turn out looking pretty, as pictured.  The dough was easy to work with (tried the shot glass -- it didn't work too well, but I normally form these little tart shapes with the rounded handle end of an ice cream scoop).  They also traveled well -- I had to bring them to a brunch, and they didn't get soggy or crumble -- they stayed together nicely.

This is an excellent recipe.  I was worried because I made the dough the night before and pressed it into the tins and put them in the fridge overnight.  I thought that the dough might stick to the pans and the quiches would be hard to get out...but it worked like a charm.  The dough was delicious.  I did my own thing with the fillings and just added the egg mixture on top.  I will definitely make these again.

Very good mini quiches! I used mild salsa instead of the green chiles and brought them to a toddler playdate and the kids actually liked them. :)

These are yummy! I made them yesterday for a tea party. The only thing I would do differently is to bake off the dough a little bit before filling. Otherwise it was doughy. I didn't have any problem getting them out of the pans but I did spray them liberally before I pressed in the dough. I also think they would benefit from some cayenne pepper or maybe even some salsa mixed into the batter.

We really liked these. I followed the directions exactly on the crust. It did turn out a little bit greasy, so I may increase the cream cheese and decrease the butter next time to see if that helps. I made four different fillings -- jalapeno cheddar, bacon cheddar, green chili cheddar, and green chili pepper jack. Bacon cheddar was our least favorite. Green chili cheddar (a little bland) and jalapeno cheddar (jalapeno was a little overpowering) tied in the middle. Our favorite was the green chili pepper jack. I cannot imagine using Monterrey Jack cheese; I think they'd be much too bland. My husband mentioned that they should have some sort of dipping sauce, so next time I'll pull out the sour cream and salsa. Thank you for new, unique recipe!

I made these yesterday. When I took them out of the muffin pan the outside shell  was nice and crisped, but when I broke it open the dough inside under the egg was totally uncooked and was chewy. I had to take out the egg filling and discard the pie shell. If this happens to you I reccomend the next time baking the pie crust for a few minutes then adding the egg filling. I gave it 3 stars insteadof 1 or 2 because I think it could have been a really good recipe.

This is really awesome!  I made it twice today once completely as written (which is perfect for those who do not like really hot spicy things) and I made it with jalepeno peppers too.  I took them to work and they were the first thing off the buffet eaten up!!  I guess 40 people think they are great too!!!!  Crust is wonderful and easy to work with!!

I prepped this recipe for a bridal shower but ran out of time to cook them, so my husband and I used the crust and filling for a 9" quiche after the party.  It was delicious!  We cooked it at the same temp, but for longer, and filled it with the cheese along with sauteed mushrooms, onion, herbs de provence and sausage.  Delicious!  I look forward to making the mini versions next time.

Everytime I make these, someone always says, "I don't really like quiche" but they try one to be polite.  Then...they generally eat more of them than anyone else!!!  Everyone loves these, even quiche-haters!  I have made these several times.  I have followed the recipe exactly and got great results.  However, this recipe is very easy to play with!  I have added red pepper flakes, tony cachere's, diced jalapenos, etc. to make them spicier (which is how we like them best!).  I have also added shredded chicken.  Be creative with these, it's a fabulous recipe.  The only thing I haven't tried, is making one large quiche instead of the minis!

I'm only rating it 4 stars since I didn't actually taste these.  I took these to my church and they were gone before I had a chance to sample them.  I did get compliments.  It was nice to have a finger food for breakfast that was hearty and not sweet, like all the other things being served.

I love this recipe, the crust is awesome. Sometimes I use broccoli or spinach in place of the chilies and sub
cheddar cheese.

I made in regular size muffin tins - was expecting a real WOW and thought they were a little bland.  It is possible that the proportions were off and affected the overall goodness of the recipe? I don't see how you can go wrong with anything that has that much cream cheese - and i love green chilies...

My dough was a little buttery/greasy, so I may add a Tb or 2 of flour next time.  But what a great, quick appetizer.  Could use any filling or use regular sized muffin tins for a heartier snack.

I  have made these a number of times and they have always turned out well.  I am particularly fond of the crust, which I have used with other fillings as well.  They are great for showers and brunches.  They freeze well for quick snack or to make ahead for an event.

I made this for a bible study and it went over great! I am giving one less star because I think it could be better. However, it was as advertised.  First, the dough is a bit crumbly. Secondly, the jalepanos don`t give it much flavor. My mom made them and mixed cheese in the dough and the dough was softer. She also mixed everything with the eggs instead of the layering of ingrediants. I tended to like this better.  Once I formulate the changes I`ll post them here for everyone else :))

These were really good!  Could have maybe used a little more of a kick in flavor, but I think they would go great served with some salsa.  Fairly easy to make and i didn't let them chill for an hour in the fridge, more like 30 minutes and they turned out great!

These were REALLY good. I was looking for a mini-quiche recipe and this worked perfectly. I modified it slightly by using caramelized onions and gruyere instead of chiles and monterey jack. I also made it in regular-sized muffin cups, added two more eggs, and used half-and-half instead of whipping cream. I was afraid they would stick in the pan, but they didn't at all.

These came out very pretty from the oven, but lacked a lot of flavor.  Maybe some sausage or even bacon would liven up the taste a little bit.  The crust was great.

I made this as written.  I felt it was very tasteless!  Maybe made in large muffin cups so that you have more filling, but as mini quiches, there just wasn't enough filling.

This was wonderful! I made it for a work breakfast party and received nothing but compliments. I added spicy sausage to the recipe like many other viewers. It can be a bit time consuming to shape the dough, but well worth it! :)
