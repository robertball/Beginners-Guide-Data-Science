This recipe was perfect!  I did double the recipe for the crust I used 1 1/3 cup almond flour, 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon, 2 tablespoons of Swerve, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 5 tablespoons of butter.  This was suggested by another reviewer I also pre-baked it at 350 for 7 minutes.  I sprayed my muffin tin with coconut oil and that actually was an added bonus because you could have the crust with a hint of coconut flavor.

I almost shed a tear when I tasted these. Outstanding recipe! If I hadnt made it myself I wouldn't believe it was keto. I turned them into cheesecake bites using a mini cupcake pan and here are the changes I made:

Crust- I used 2/3 cup super fine almond flour, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of swerve,  1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract and half the amount of butter in the original recipe.  Once mixed, spoon 1 teaspoon into the wells, press down and bake (without cheesecake mixture) for 7 minutes on 350. Take them out to cool while mixing cheesecake. The super fine almond flour yields a crust similar to a shortbread cookie without the chewy, nutty taste you get with almond meal. Note: You'll need to double the crust recipe if using super fine almond flour to accommodate the amount of filling.

Cheesecake-  No changes made.

These are amazing!  I followed JOEYGIRLâ€™s suggestion and added 2 tablespoons xylitol and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the crust.  Truly unbelievable!  Will be keeping these in stock at home.  My husband luved them and we can tell no difference between it and real NY cheesecake!  Delicious!!

Thank you for this recipe.  The filling or the cheesecake is really good. The changes i made was to add some coconut flour, vanilla essence and sweetener to the crust.

I made these for Easter and topped them with berries I smashed with monk fruit sweetener. So,so delicious, nobody even knew it was a Keto recipe.

I love it. I added vanilla and Swerle to the almond meal. Thanks for the suggestions. And here is my additions. Whip cream strawberries and a drizzle of Lindt 90% cocao.
